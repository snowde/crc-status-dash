Cory D.,"Winchester, KY",5,8,3,3.0,5/19/2012,"The service was very good & the food was pretty good. I'm just not a big fan of chain restaurants, but as far as chains go this one is better than average."
Edward N.,"Waimanalo, HI",0,1,,3.0,12/23/2013,Quick meal...pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw n the house sangria w/a shot of Malibu Rum .  Salad was fresh along w/cole slaw. Pork was excellent and not drenched with barbecue sauce. Reasonably priced and a twist of elegance made a commitment to return. Waiter personable and very attentive.
Cynthia K.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",8,55,4,3.0,8/18/2013,I have three children who have all worked for this company in various locations and when I travel for work I find this to be consistent in quality of food and drink. This visit was no exception except for the service. It was very poor and unattentive. Even the manager who brought out my food did a poor job.  When you ask for condiments for your food you want them before you are finished eating.  I also asked for a salad which was delivered to the table next to me after all of us  eaten. I am surprised given the training most locations give their employees.
Linda R.,"Morro Bay, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/2/2014,"Get desert to go! The service is poor, the drink I ordered was not made correctly and asking for it to be remade was like asking for blood. I ordered pizza which was flat bread, with sprinkling of cheese and little pieces of spinach (I think) spread sparsely. Dinner was awful, but desert, a slice of Godiva cheesecake was amazing. After talking to other people I am convinced there is nothing to eat from the dinner menu. I will never eat there again, but I will buy cheesecake to go."
Ann H.,"Mt Prospect, IL",2,27,11,1.0,9/17/2011,"Visited 3 times in the last year, the 1st was ok, ordered drinks, pasta dishes and cheesecake.  The last 2, times was awful.  Pasta dishes were too salty on visit number 2, but we ate them because we were starved and had to wait so long to be seated.  Time # 3, tried wild mushroom burgers with sweet potato fries.  Both were over salted and cold.  Not worth the wait, the $, or the disspointing food."
Matt F.,"Saint Louis, MO",10,22,4,2.0,7/30/2013,"Atmosphere is ok. Decor is tacky-chic, I guess? We ordered three small plates, which were all pretty bland. I had a mojito which was tasty, but not 9$ tasty. If you're going to spend this kind of money, go somewhere better."
Monty M.,"Saint Louis, MO",38,47,11,5.0,7/19/2011,"Had the best waitress!!  Super nice, on time....made Cheesecake Factory a better experience.  Fish Tacos is always a great choice, fresh, tasty, excellent."
Marcus B.,"Saint Louis, MO",12,9,1,3.0,12/22/2008,"I must say that I love the Cheesecake Factory--the menu is comprehensive, its food delicious, and it's scene upscale. However, it's operation and management is not up to par. For example, food typically takes an excessive amount of time to prepare, and the service you receive could be better. Furthermore, I've opted for 'take-out' on 5 occasions in the past 6 months, and on 4 of those occasions, my order was incorrect and/or incomplete.  Great tasting restaurant with a lot of potential--just need some operational and management changes."
Careth T.,"Ballwin, MO",21,22,7,4.0,8/20/2011,"I come here when I want consistant, attentive, and excellent service. The portions are outrageous so, either bring your appetite or someone to share with. Oh, and be sure to save room for dessert, I've never had a bad one here."
Amy B.,"Columbia, MO",5,39,,5.0,8/20/2013,"Service is great, food is awesome.  I usually stick to pasta dishes and follow it with the best cheesecake around."
Liz Z.,"Los Altos Hills, CA",51,308,111,4.0,2/13/2011,"went to HH/dinner with colleagues last week and just had to comment on the service:  4-star treatment yo.  we had a ""regular"" waitress and a ""trainee"" as our wait staff, both very competent and kind, even if we just ordered HH specials at the bar. had my traditional go-to-dishes, tamales cakes and arugula salad. unfortunately, the cakes were a bit undercooked, but the arugula salad was still quite tasty.  as far as the cakes are concerned, please CF, don't disappoint me again."
Stephanie P.,"Oceanside, CA",60,41,27,5.0,3/8/2008,"There's a lot to love about the Cheesecake Factory.  From start to finish, it's one of the best chain restaurants around, with a HUGE menu that ranges from familiar (sliders and meatloaf) to fairly exotic (ahi tuna carpaccio).   Portions are always generous, and one dish can easily feed two people.  Even the bread that comes with the meals is great -- crusty sourdough or a slightly sweet brown bread.  Yum. The service is fabulous, and the decor is lovely.  It can be a bit loud, and the biggest drawback for me is that because it is SO popular it can be an hour-long wait just to get in.   But no matter, once you're in you're doing good.  The fruit-flavored lemonades are divine.  The afore-mentioned carpaccio really hit the spot for me when I wanted something protein-heavy and tasty.  Every entree I've tasted there has been great -- I especially love their presentation, which is always a little on the artsy side and very eye-appealing. But here's what I never knew: for a chain, they are open LATE.  Midnight-thirty on Friday nights, in fact.  AND the kitchen stays open along with the bar.  Awesome!   Speaking of awesome, their bar is fantastic.  A little on the fruity side, but they can make just about anything for you.  There was no bloody mary on the menu I got, so I asked, and of course I was told that they make them.  My well-mannered dirty martini didn't quite have enough olive brine in it for me, but when I mentioned that to the bartender he instantly went to grab it and fix it for me.  Hence, the awesome. I suppose it's not a Cheesecake Factory review without mentioning the cheesecake, but I'll be honest -- I am not a cheesecake lover.  What I've tried of that dessert, though, has been very good, and the cheesecake-lovin' man at my side seemed thrilled by the slice we got, as had every girlfriend I've gone with to CF.  Personally, I like the carrot cake cheesecake -- it's definitely worth trying if you like a little carrot cake with your cream cheese frosting. Price-wise, you can get out of there on the cheap if you don't go crazy.  But if you do go crazy, you won't regret it. All in all, a great place with a long wait, but there's a reason for that: it's worth it!"
Alex L.,"Chicago, IL",567,160,30,4.0,6/16/2008,"I've been here a couple of times, and I must say, I love the atmosphere. I frequent the ones in Atlanta, and I must say that this one stacks pretty highly among those in Atlanta.    The styling is very unique, and the low light setting is slightly too low for me, but it's not to the point where I stick my eye trying to put food in my mouth. There is a nice background fading effect there though. The lighting setup lights the people's faces at the table and drowns out everything else, I liked this effect.    The food there is not bad, and the price isn't that bad either.      It's the summer time and there's a patio outside for dining. It's a really nice atmosphere, and they have heat lamps for winter, but it's by a busy intersection for mall traffic, and I'm not sure whether that will be bothersome or not."
Liz A.,"Palm Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",30,106,1,3.0,1/20/2009,"This place is always so busy!  I wish that they took reservations, but I understand why they don't.   The food is SO... heavy.  And you have to be careful not to fill up before you get your food- which is hard because the aps are sooo yummy.  I love the stuffed buffalo chicken!  Yummy!  And the ""umbrella drinks"" are SUPER sweet and fun- but if you don't like sweets I wouldn't even try it. I usually get the herb crusted salmon here which has always been pretty good! And I've been ordering it since high school :)  I can't say anything about the cheescake because I actually hate cheescake but I hear from lovers that it's pretty good!  The staff is nice, but because they get so busy they can take a while sometimes, forget stuff, bring you the wrong bill, bring you the wrong food...  And everytime I'm here it's always SUPER loud.  Which can be a good thing, depending who I'm with. :)"
Kat V.,"Chatsworth, CA",188,988,32,3.0,5/20/2008,"I went here for lunch with my parents & ordered the miso salmon.  The salmon was very delish!  But after eating a major portion, my lips started to burn!  The miso cream sauce outside the mound of rice & salmon wasn't very good.  In general, I don't like creamy sauces.  After a while, my tummy was gurgling & tumbling.  Not good.  Needless to say, the food was delish but didn't seem to agree with my system.  The service was fantastic as was the bread.  We didn't wait that long for the food, and the appetizer that my mom ordered (I forget the name of it but it was spicy & had salmon rolled up in spinach & some kind of wrapper (I'm guessing egg roll)) was really good!  The waitress was kind enough to ask if I wanted water after I went to the bathroom to clean my lips so that it would stop burning."
Nancy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,8,,1.0,10/28/2013,"Run, don't walk, away from this culinary train wreck!  We should have left after being treated poorly by the rude and unprofessional hostess. Our next clue was a dirty silverware setting. The hostess turned her back and walked away before we could even ask for a replacement setting. Our waitress was nice, but she was more focused on selling three rounds of high end drinks to a neighboring table than taking our order. After we declined bread, she brought a bread basket anyway and disappeared. We waited a very l-o-n-g time to have our order taken, and then we waited 1/2 hour for our food. Unfortunately, things got worse. An overpriced order of Vietnamese shrimp and shiitake mushroom spring rolls was badly prepared. The real joy was that the dish contained ONE shrimp and ONE mushroom among the three rolls. The rest was shredded carrots and noodles! We tried to get someone's attention to send our food back, but it was useless. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed; the  ""manager"" was busy sweeping up broken glass. We thought things would improve with dessert, and we were wrong. Cheesecake with an upcharge for strawberries arrived with TWO small berries served in a shot glass on the plate. There was no strawberry sauce and no sweetener, but some wildly creative slicing to make the tiny glass appear full.  I intend to write the manager and the chain headquarters about this, but I doubt it will matter. Save yourself the effort and find some good Asian cuisine on South Grand or some fine Italian cuisine on The Hill, and then head to Ted Drewes!"
Stephanie B.,"Birmingham, AL",83,441,29,4.0,11/3/2010,"There isn't a whole lot I can actually add to my review that isn't already known. Food is good, reliable and huge portion sizes. They will do whatever you need to accommodate food allergies or desires. Since this is in a mall it's always busy and adheres to it's own rules of ""rush hours"" so beware and expect a wait."
Saucy G.,"Saint Louis, MO",7,244,8,2.0,1/30/2012,"Cheesecake factory!! It's a shame i'm always too full to enjoy dessert :( so this is a place where we eat pretty much eat at only when we're in the mall here or at chesterfield. This particular cheesecake factory though has been reduced to ""only come if you have to"" now. My sister loves this place and I had to get some quick Three Kings Day presents so she quickly turned it into a dinner reservation the night before. THERE IS NO POINT IN MAKING A RESERVATION HERE. It's a party of 4, 2 ppl show up to the front and are told to wait for an opening while the other 2 have already been seated. that's called lack of communication per the computer screen that dictates who is seated where. piss poor. i haaaaaate to wait which is why i make reservations everywhere, hence the whole damn point of a reservation!!! i expect the damn table to be ready and reserved for said time!! not wait! lol and what made it into an irritating situation that i felt compelled to sit down and type about it was the staff was piss poor sans our waitress. there was just a group of ppl waiting to be assisted by the hostess or the other 7 employees coming in and out of the front desk or hanging out there. i heard a whole conversation between two of the staff about plans for the weekend before the ppl two ppl in front of me were asked if they had been helped. piss poor. and no if my reservation is for 9, i'm there waiting in a line at 8:50 with other patrons waiting to be assisted. finally its my turn at 9:05 and told to wait??????? sorry i'll go the factory at chesterfield before i waste my time here again. oh yea waaay too much wax or whatever on the floor, easy lawsuit. otherwise the food was fine, huge portions :)"
Alexis H.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,78,84,4.0,6/7/2010,Heeeey! Not bad at all! Great lunch pasta!! I recommend Pasta Da Vinci (Penne cream sauce w/ Mushroom + Chicken. YUM!) and Spaghetti meatsauce! Both pretty good and the portion is gigantic! The place is very spacey and clean. Great service of the waitress. Not too expensive (if lunch). Great chain restaurant in a mall. I'm glad I tried! I'll come back again!
Melody L.,"Springfield, MO",0,14,,4.0,3/28/2011,Amazing cheesecake.  Service can be not so great at times when eating in.  Dinner foods are really good.  I go there mostly to pick up cheesecake for special occasions.
