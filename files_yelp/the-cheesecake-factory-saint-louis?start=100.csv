Jenifer J.,"Saint Louis, MO",65,2,,1.0,9/7/2016,"Let me start off by saying that The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. I dined at this location frequently. Upon my last visit, I was chewing on a buffalo blast and noticed an extremely long, straight hair in my mouth (my hair is curly btw). When I informed the waitress, she apologized and informed me and my party that the cooks had been messing up orders all night. When the manager came over, he seemed very annoyed and simply stated ""I'll get you a free drink"" and walked away. When my bill arrived I requested to speak to the manager again, and again he was annoyed. He stated ""I gave you a free drink, all I cam give you is a slice of cheesecake"". I decided to accept the cheesecake and let it go. But when I arrived home, I noticed that the cheesecake also had hair in it. I am beyond disgusted, and will no longer be dining at this location."
Elizabeth K.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,3,,5.0,5/4/2015,This was one of the best experiences I have had in a long time with service at a restaurant. Garrett was our waiter and he was fantastic. He had a very upbeat personality and helped pick some really delicious dinner entrees. He was very friendly and had a ton of tables he was helping but still made every one a priority.  The manager was also fantastic. A person at a nearby table had some alergies and was very rude about what she could and could not eat. The manager took her information and went back to look up each of the ingredients in the dishes she was interested in. She continued to be rather rude after this and the manager continued to be very pleasant and accommodating. Because of this service I will be back even though the price is a little higher than my college budget likes...as long as Garrett is there.
Jazz M.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,9,1,2.0,12/30/2015,"Way overpriced and over-hyped. Food is nothing special. The cheesecake is too sweet & loaded with fat, a day's worth calories in one meal! Greasy and overpriced. Not my style."
Eric P.,"Ashland, MA",0,6,,1.0,6/29/2016,I travel all over the country for work. Have always loved cheese cake factories because it's consistent. You always get the same service / reliability.  Twice in a row now I have come to this location and they are out of Tuna. Even better the staff crack fun about their their managers to me about how they can't seem to order correctly.  I won't be coming back. Sick of being disappointed.
Kathy H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,74,,1.0,10/6/2015,This review is for the bar only. We were at the Galleria on a recent weekend night and decided to grab a drink before we left. I ordered a cocktail and spouse a scotch. We didn't ask for prices but were aware that this particular scotch typically runs $15/drink - even at upscale establishments. I honestly don't think of this place as particularly high end.  Our bill for two drinks was almost $45. They charged $30 for one scotch! Even the bartender who checked us out (not the same one who served us) was taken aback at the price. I expect a mark-up on alcohol at a restaurant but not to this extent. I already stayed away from this place as a dining choice and now it's off limits for beverages too.
Susan L.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,41,21,5.0,6/7/2014,"I really do like the setting of the restaurant. Wait can be long, but it is nice that they give you a little device to alert you when a table is open, and they have seating right outside in the lobby area for the galleria. Not sure how much of a distance that thing goes, but I guess you could go shopping in the mall during the wait.  It is a bit pricey, but reasonable, because they give you big portions. I love love the bread they give you. I like the variety.  Service was ok. Seats are a little too close to each other though."
Bill W.,"Saint Louis, MO",49,34,2,3.0,9/19/2015,"Three of us came. Got in fast with early call ahead. Then, ordered and waited an hour for the food! Never waited so long here. My wife had to send back her dish with chicken as it was too fatty or something strange about it. We waited another 20 plus minutes for her dish she sent back. General the taste is great. Tonight, not so much. Anyhow, what's up Cheesecake? They also keep dropping out daughters favorite dishes.... The latest one was The Salmon Genovese, totally was outstanding and now gone. My wife thought 3 stars was way too many....  Hmmm Came back about a week later and again, the service has seriously slowed down. What's up CF?"
Sebele L.,"St Peters, Saint Louis, MO",127,11,3,1.0,1/27/2016,"Like how as a waitress is your personality flat as hell ? I just am over bad customer service, this makes me not want to eat At restaurants, it's not worth the damn headache. Today my child turned 12, our waitress Virginia had a flat affect the entire time and they passive aggressive attitude but nevertheless I tried to ignore it for the sake of my child. I asked her to bring the sundae that you get for your bday, she brought it out and walked away abruptly. I had just saw a waitress sing with another table while bringing her sundae. She never even told my child happy birthday, like what the hell. I tell her that I wanted to order a cheesecake with her name ""happy birthday Ayana"" on it . She comes back with a ""happy birthday to you"" plate and I'm like what happened to her name, she tells me when they are busy they don't write it on there and walks off again !! I ask for the manager. I spoke with a service manager Amy who again never apologies for her nice nasty employee and I tell her don't send Virginia over again. A service manager Mark waits on us the rest of the night and tells my child happy birthday. She was so excited for that acknowledgement and just told me when we got home that her feelings was a lil hurt because the waitress attitude and she didn't say happy birthday . Great , way to go, smh never again will I patronize them . I promise common sense ain't common no more and by that I mean that service manager Amy, how do you not listen to our issues and not acknowledge or apologize on behalf of your staff ?"
Katie B.,"Saint Louis, MO",185,10,5,1.0,8/15/2015,"Dining on a Saturday can always be a gamble,  but when you wait over an hour for your food,  order a seafood and steak dinner and get more mushrooms than actual meat,  and the shrimp scampi consists on exactly 3 shrimp,  for the price it's extremely disappointing. The only thing that's decent about The Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake.  This is the second very bad experience at this restaurant.  Lesson learned."
Marni P.,"Saint Louis, MO",23,160,15,4.0,3/22/2014,"Huge portions and lots of seating, the Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to take friends in the Richmond Heights and Brentwood area. The staff is always helpful and food comes out quickly and is always fresh. The prices are a bit steep but are completely worth it for the quality of the food. Plus it's worth like two or three meals since the portions are so big. For those who aren't fans of cheesecake the dessert menu has some killer chocolate cakes. Splurge on a piece as big as your head! Minus one star for the frequent long waits. If you can call ahead, do. If you can go at a non peak time, do that instead. The wait can extend longer than an hour on weekends or when there are events like prom and holidays."
Aimee K.,"Saint Louis, MO",3789,773,2544,4.0,10/13/2011,"Very rarely will I review a chain restaurant, but very rarely do I enjoy one enough to talk about it. I am in love with Cheesecake Factory's ""SkinnyLicious"" menu and make the most of it every time I'm at the Galleria. Sad, I do know, but TCF has the best veggie burger I've ever had, passing up even my favorite local joints. I'd still go with local if I had a choice, but while shopping at the mall, this place gets the job done.  Their veggie burger is made with brown rice, farro, black beans, fresh beets & onion, and it's the perfect consistency. It comes with a deliciously light green salad and is light but so satisfying. Another item to pay attention to off the SkinnyLicious menu are the fish tacos -- and these are all very reasonable when it comes to calories and fat. Major win. I know that kind of defeats the purpose of going to The CHEESECAKE Factory, but it works for me. Service here is always stellar, and our last server was hilarious and went through every menu item with reasons why we should order it. He then made fun of me for going low-cal, even though they have a whole menu dedicated to it... I liked his sense of humor. Chances are, with the holidays coming up, I'm going to be eating many veggie burgers here. Yay for the rare awesome chain restaurant experience!"
Joko S.,"Parma, ID",0,11,1,5.0,10/17/2015,This is a great family place to eat talk and have some fun!!!After you eat you can go shopping and have some fun. If you want to go for dinner I would go around 4:00 so that when you get there you can get your food very quickly
Teri D.,"Powell, OH",113,702,50,4.0,1/18/2012,"Ok, now they have their skinnylicous meals on top of the skinny drinks.  Not too fond of the skinny drinks.  They just don't taste right, but now they have an entire menu (small but still there) of skinny foods.  And they aren't bad! Right sized (for me anyway) and as a person who has never been fond of sandwiches or salads oozing with dressings to the point I have to dig through to find the salad or meat, having a sandwich now with a small enough amount to satisfy me - I'm good to go!  And if it isn't enough that's what asking for a bit more on the side is for. This could be my way of justifying desert now...hehehe."
Wisdom L.,"Saint Louis, MO",14,12,155,4.0,10/25/2013,"We always come there  after shopping in the mall. great service! Nice food, I love the idea of  Skinnylicious menu. But the desert, especially cheesecakes are way too sweet to me."
Joey W.,"Arnold, MO",946,286,74,4.0,1/7/2015,"I have never been to the Cheesecake Factory before. I kept seeing references to this restaurant in ""The Big Bang Theory"" (Penny was a waitress at the Cheesecake factory.) I also kept reading articles how this place served ginormous portions and is ruining our waste-lines.  I just had to try this place out, just once. I was not a bit disappointed.  So, we didn't have to wait long for a table. Maybe five or ten minutes and we were seated. The place where we sat was outside on the patio and it was near the door. We could hear the door opening and slamming shut, but that was the only negative aspect of our experience. There were so many choices in the menu, it was very difficult to make a decision on what to eat. I eventually chose their chicken and biscuits entree and my dining partner chose an enchilada. The prices were a bit steep, but you get a lot on your plate. We ended up eating half of what was on our plates and taking the rest home. My partner ordered one enchilada, but that thing was so massive, you'd think some Mexican giant dropped down from some bean stalk and made it for us. Yes, it was huge. We had to have cheesecake, because, why go to a cheesecake restaurant without having their dessert? I had Adam's Peanut butter cheesecake, which didn't disappoint either. I think the cheesecake alone was 800 calories at the bare minimum. My vote? If you want to get a great thanksgiving like meal, with enough food to last you over until tomorrow, this is a place worth visiting."
Laura S.,"Mt Vernon, IL",0,39,4,5.0,12/29/2014,"The Skinnylicious menu makes this a GO TO for me and my adult daughters because we are all trying to eat healthy but today we took my 6 month old granddaughter and they gave us a ""baby plate"" with sliced bananas and pieces of bread for her to gnaw on while we waited for out food. What a fantastic idea. It entertained her throughout the entire meal. Great service today as well!"
Leah H.,"Chatham, IL",6,46,7,1.0,7/1/2013,"I have visited this restaurant several times over the last few years visiting St. Louis from central IL.  I have gone twice this year, both times my protein was not cooked through.  In May, I ordered the chicken avocado club, and the chicken was TOTALLY raw in the center.  I will admit, once it was recooked, it was amazing.   Today I ordered the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta dish.  The menu said it was a popular dish and that it was spicy.  the dish was actually not spicy, just lightly warm on your tongue. The shrimp was not pink or warm at all! It was so under cooked that it was difficult to cut.   I won't be back!!! An old favorite stop... Very sad to see this go down hill due to the lack of cooking skills! I will comment on the service... Always great and impressive!"
Greg G.,"Peoria, IL",3,28,9,4.0,6/13/2015,Always good food. This cheesecake was up to standards of all others. Missing valet parking. Not much else to say. The CF is always a family favorite!
Harper Z.,"Saint Louis, MO",152,178,94,3.0,5/7/2013,"Shopping at the Galleria and don't want to leave for lunch or face the food court? Need hundreds of menu options? Well then the Cheesecake Factory is for you. Okay that probably sounded a little cynical. I like the Cheesecake Factory and have consistently been able to order things I liked.  Portions are massive and the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend coming for lunch and splitting an appetizer, entree and dessert.  Order the Vietnamese taco appetizer. I'm kind of an Asian food snob and I like these enough to order them each time I visit."
Steve B.,"Saint Louis, MO",31,224,81,4.0,2/12/2015,"Simply put, I over ate.  Now, the ""Skinny"" menu is actually great for me because I don't want 14 servings of something so the size of the actual meal felt more in line with what I could handle.  My mistake came during dessert, I mean how do you come here and not get a cheesecake?  Well, even splitting a peanut butter something or other proved difficult and the two of us still couldn't finish it and I literally wanted to barf or go to sleep for many hours following.  It's my own stupid fault.  Tasty though!  Very nice and attentive server I must say, very on the ball."
