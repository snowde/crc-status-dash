Mark M.,"Freeburg, IL",340,203,5224,5.0,4/4/2012,"The food is awesome, and the menu is like 50 pages long, if your in a hurry make sure to get your menu before you set down for dinner.  This will give you a chance to check everything out.  We sat out on the patio and the weather was really nice. The service was awesome and our server was great. The food was great also."
Tracy C.,"Saint Louis, MO",79,74,13,2.0,2/28/2013,"With over 200 items on the menu, you would think the Cheesecake Factory would have a fair amount of choices for the gluten-free eater to choose from. Not so. There is actually very little that is naturally gluten free (think steak or steamed fish with none of their sides) and even less that can be modified. I am told all of their dressings have wheat in it. They also have added wheat somehow to their rice and beans (say what?? Why on earth you need to...). I finally ended up getting a Cobb salad with a steamed chicken ( the seasoning they usually  use has wheat) and a very boring oil and vinegar dressing. Having a chain this size take no action to be gluten free, or educate their servers, is very discouraging for me. Sigh."
Jason S.,"Evanston, IL",0,3,,2.0,3/22/2015,"Usually the Cheesecake Factory would have a 5 star rating, we enjoy it every time. The service was fine, my kids pizza was not. The crust was doughy but burnt on the bottom. We stopped here on a trip and will not be back to this location."
McKenzie G.,"Dixon, IL",8,24,,1.0,2/22/2016,"If I could give 0 stars I probably would. This was my 1st time at this particular Cheesecake Factory location & needless to say I won't be back. We stopped by about 11pm on a Saturday night so I am assuming it was a busy evening however when we git there there were maybe 6 tables occupied in the entire restaurant. I immediately noticed the floor in tge restaurant was slick/greasy like & I about slipped multiple times on our way to our table and back & forth between the restroom. The restrooms were dusgusting, the 1st 2 stalls not even usable.  2 employees bussing tables across from ours were arguing about what section they were in. They were very loud & it was very rude. We ordered a pizza, cheesecake & drinks. My coffee was cold, but the pizza & cheesecake were good. It took a very long time to get take home boxes and our bill. Every other location I have been to has been impeccable in every aspect even during busy times. It was just uncalled for for this place to be so disgustingly unclean, such horrible service & rude employees."
Riana Elizabeth E.,"Saint Louis, MO",691,145,748,4.0,11/11/2011,"Going to have to break this review down just because I really want to rave about my wonderful server!  I'm picky and I could find no complaints!  This could've been a 3 star review without the impeccible service. Service: 5 Stars - Ask for Mike Abels (the bartender, so you may have to sit in the bar section) for your server.  He went ~absolutely~ out of the way to make sure we were happy.  He checked in with us frequently, but not so much we were annoyed, made sure we had all the little accompaniments we needed, and was just a friendly pleasure to be around! Food Quality: 4 Stars - Homemade dressings, very flavorful dishes, and a vast number of choices.  Try the tuna & avocado tartare appetizer! Value for the $: 3 Stars - Portion sizes were small for the price.  Some things, like the Cobb Salad, skimped on certain toppings, such as bacon and bleu cheese."
Russ S.,"Imperial, MO",0,3,,1.0,3/28/2015,"What a joke. Thinking about eating here? Move on! Worst wait time, worst service and the food is average at best. 3.5 hours of my life I can't get back."
Lizzy L.,"Durham, NC",125,343,230,4.0,9/20/2011,"We did the new call-ahead-seating about 30 minutes before we arrived in person, but we had to wait an additional 60 minutes before we were seated. Granted, we did arrive on a Saturday evening. Our waitress was awesome, but she told us that she had a meltdown near the end of our time there because of the chaos in the restaurant--we didn't notice any less attentiveness from her though! I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which was not as spicy as the menu stated (I did not want spicy, so this was good). It was really tasty and I loved the shrimp and onions.  The hubs got the Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes, which didn't have enough salt, and was really really creamy...too creamy! My father in law got Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane: DELISH! I liked his dish more than mine. The shrimp was crispy, and the mashed potatoes well-seasoned with just the right amount of salt. My brother in law got Chicken Bellagio, which he's gotten the past 4 times we came to Cheesecake factory."
Aria L.,"Wood River, IL",0,10,7,5.0,5/3/2014,"Besides waiting, everything is perfect! From the food, to the waiters/waitresses, even the bathrooms are spectacular! I ALWAYS come here on special events cause they are so pricey. Other than that, I get the Chinese chicken salad and if I'm feeling naughty, a piece of cheesecake!;)"
Erica B.,"Saint Louis, MO",39,30,48,2.0,1/14/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite chain restaurants and I give them props for making their menu more appropriate in terms of smaller plates and more nutritious foods, however when it comes to making food accommodations, it was a miserable experience.  The waiter we had was downright rude when I asked him to leave something out of my dish (shrimp) which appeared to be an easy accommodation for the dish I ordered. He presented as that not being on option and then insisted that I just eat the shrimp because it would still be vegetarian despite me not even saying I was a vegetarian. I could have very well been allergic to shrimp, but that didn't seem to matter as he was annoyed by my order and made it clear when he rolled his eyes at me.  This was an isolated incidence, but I was appalled at how inconsiderate and demanding he was when taking my order. My food preferences can and have been accommodated much better elsewhere."
Leslie S.,"Saint Louis, MO",278,740,1455,2.0,2/1/2011,"Great cheesecake and very modern, inviting decor...but outside cheesecake, there are so many things on the menu, how can they be good at all of them?  Or perhaps any of them?  I have a hard time trusting an entree on a 200+ item menu (with the exception of Asian menus). So far, any entree I have ever had here would rate a 2 or 3 out of 5.  Most items taste like they were re-heated from frozen in the kitchen and placed on a pretty dish."
J. K.,"O'Fallon, IL",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2016,"I will never go back to The Cheesecake Factory at the St. Louis Galleria or any for that matter. They have the worst management staff in the world. They are completely unprofessional and extremely rude. The entire time I was eating I had couples standing in between our tables hovering over us waiting for us to finish our food and after complaining to the management who did nothing about it the management turned the issue around on me and made us look like we were causing a problem. I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody ... they were rude from the moment I tried to call ahead for my call ahead, from the moment they sat me down and from the moment that I tried to have a manager to speak to about the uncomfortable situation"
Eliza H.,"O'Fallon, IL",0,6,,1.0,3/20/2015,"The restaurant was horribly loud with a floor so slick with nastiness I almost fell. The wait staff was incredibly rude. They yelled in my mom's ear, grabbed my dad's arm, and kept shoving us out of the way while carrying food through the waiting area to the tables. We waited for a long time and when the buzzer finally went off we had to stand there even longer after they took it along with three other parties in the same exact situation. The table they lead us to was covered in crumbs and was packed in way too tightly with the other tables. This is the point where my family and I chose to leave. Honestly you'd have a more enjoyable time eating at a fast food joint."
Shane D.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",1,4,,1.0,8/18/2014,Went with my wife and three month old for the first time in years. Food was great and the service was decent. Had the SW egg rolls and the chicken and biscuits. The problem occurred at midnight when I suddenly become very ill and projectile vomited and other things I will not mention. Wife was fine so I guess the chicken was undercooked which is a big no no in my book. Not a good way to start our first trip out of town with a newborn!
Mercedes B.,"Kirkwood, Saint Louis, MO",0,24,1,1.0,7/4/2016,"I have always been a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory but the last 2 visits have been awful. I will never eat there again!! We sat in the bar area/high top table.  My sister ordered the egg rolls - very greasy & awful. I had the chicken sliders - when I took a bite into one of the sliders -  I felt something hard and looked down at the sandwich to find a piece of plastic ... UGH!  When the waitress came back around I told her I found this piece of plastic in the slider - she commented that it was a good thing I was on the last slider and took my plate away.  Additionally, she mentioned it was probably just a piece of plastic wrap that got cooked into the piece of chicken ... So unacceptable!! She brought us the bill and walked away - not even sorry for the plastic in your chicken and charged me for the sliders. Upon leaving I asked for the manager - we waited a few minutes- then decided to leave - was tired of waiting. So, I called there on my way to the car - the manager eventually came to the phone - he apologized and offered me a free piece of cheesecake- Not interested in eating anything from there again ever -  so I declined. Waitress completely mishandled- she shouldn't have charged me for plastic in my food!! Be sure to check your food before eating there!"
Tanya M.,"Cahokia, IL",210,448,66,3.0,12/24/2012,"I decided to take my sister here for lunch. it has been awhile since we had a fancy place lunch.  the Carlton salad was very good. I wish it would have bacon in it. that would have made it spectacular. I liked the potato soup also. but i picked a bay leaf out of mine and half of the green onions that they put in. and again no bacon in the potato soup. the leftover salad was a bit wilty but still good.  lastly i got the red velvet cheesecake. the red velvet cake was good. the cheesecake was good. the red velvet did not have much flavor, but together how could you go wrong.  i really like the mint flavor of their green tea. it may be awhile before i go back, but it will still be the Cheesecake Factory."
David T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",59,168,16,5.0,7/22/2013,"This was the first time I had gone to a Cheesecake Factory for a meal, and I was not disappointed.  I first started off with the Ahi Tartare, which was small but very good. The Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce was amazing. Maybe ask for a little extra, as there is only a little at the bottom. Still,  the small size also has a small price. It is a nice appetizer to share with another person. As for my meal, I actually decided to go with the Cuban sandwich, as I didn't want anything heavy. While the sandwich is not authentic Cuban, it was good. They state that is was made with Cuban-style role, but it isn't. The texture of a Cuban-style roll is smooth, while this roll was very coarse. Also, it came with mayo which is something not on a traditional Cuban. Therefore, just ask for the mayo on the side if you want something closer to an authentic Cuban (as I just used my mayo to do my Utah-style fry sauce). But still, the lack of being authentic didn't take away from the flavor, which was absolutely amazing. To end the meal, I just went with a traditional cheesecake with strawberries, which never disappoints.  This was the first time I had a meal at a Cheesecake Factory and I will definately do it again."
Lee J.,"Lompoc, CA",12,49,38,4.0,4/24/2013,"Ahhh... Where do I start. I visit Cheesecake Factory whenever I can. If its local and I am in town. I am trying to make a an excuse to visit. Me: ""Since I am in town I am thinking we could do _______ at CF. You down?"" A. lunch B. brunch C. dinner d. All the above. Yeah, if you answered with anyone of those responses you passed this exam. What can I say its a great place to grab some delicious food meet up with friends and splurge on a date without being super formal. Oh yeah, save room for desert! The Red Velvet Cake and Dulce De Leche Cheesecake are my faves and will seriously have you down for the count. Yeah, the prices may get you down for now in this post recession economy. I mean I wouldn't hit up CF everyday for lunch but it sure is a great place to live a little. Finally, be patient because every single CF I have been to are busy. Perfection takes time people. You want it fast go to burger king. So bring some friends or bring a cool date that will give great conversation. Put down the iPhone and enjoy each others company. Why not check in with your Yelp! app while visiting. Tease everyone with the fact you're about to enjoy some CF awesomeness. So eat be merry and do it at Cheesecake Factory!"
Iris T.,"Washington, DC",55,383,412,3.0,12/8/2010,"It's been a while since I've actually had a meal at Cheesecake Factory. I used to be in love with Cheesecake, up until the point that Cheesecake took their amazing (and still irreplaceable) Chicken Pesto Pasta off the menu. Sad, but true.  But this past week, I thought I'd give it another whirl and see if I can find a different Cheesecake Factory entree to fall in love with. So I decided to try out their pasta with meat sauce -- simple and classic.  Their rendition of it was simple and classic in appearance but not so much in taste. The dish had a very generous helping of meat.. and with the salt as well. It was too salty for me to enjoy and couldn't finish the dish -- and I got the lunch portion!  On the plus side, Cheesecake has lunch specials, with their pasta lunch specials running from $6.95-$10.95. And there's always their cheesecakes.  Based on my most recent experience at Cheesecake, I say: life is short -- skip the entree and go straight for the cheesecake!"
Jessica B.,"Carterville, IL",20,114,2,4.0,9/11/2012,I know Gordon Ramsey would say so many mean things about this place....menu is expansive...it is literally a book. They make a ton of items but I don't know if other than cheesecake they really excel at any one in particular...this one seems like it's having an identity crisis too. I got their ziti I believe but it kind of tasted and looked like something from a frozen dinner so I was upset. Got the burrito next time and it was delicious and so big I had three days worth of meals off it. Of course the cheesecake is amazing. This place is so expensive though.
Sarah K.,"Ballwin, MO",0,13,,2.0,10/15/2014,"Just had an awful experience. Waitress was rude, half the table didn't get drinks till entrees came out.  We asked for a different waitress and the manager obliged, only the rude waitress kept coming back. They comped us two free desserts for the birthday girls (don't restaurants do that anyway?!) took cheesecake to go and that made our disappointed stomachs happy. (Each of our Salads were over dressed). Will only be back for dessert, lunch wasn't worth the money. Overall unpleasant experience."
