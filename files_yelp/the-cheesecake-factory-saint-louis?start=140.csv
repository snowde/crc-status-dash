Paul K.,"Naples, FL",324,560,602,4.0,4/21/2010,"I have read Chip K's (my son) review and Stephanie's (my bread pudding friend) and agree with what they had to write.  Only here is what I had going on.  This used to be National Secretary Day and now it has some PC name that I cannot remember.  Oh well age does that.  We had 10 people for lunch.  You can call ahead but only after 11am.  Since we arrived at 11 made no sense to call.  11am worked we just walked in and was seated FAST.  With 10 people and one server it could have been a disaster but our server David was a champ.  I don't think he did anything wrong and everything was done to the best of his ability he did not mail in his 18% guarantee.  I found a little extra extra in the pocket for David.  He had another group of high school girls right behind us.  He is going to be tired tonight. Appetizers were Mahi Mahi tartar, Calamari, Pot Stickers,   None of which I ate.  Trying to avoid the carbs.  No one complained about anything it was all good.  Main course was all over the menu from Steak Diane to Club sandwich.  Again praise for the goodness of the food.  Oh, I had a rib eye steak with a balsamic arugula salad.  The salad was fantastic as was the rib eye.  They marinate the rib eye for 36 hours and it was amost fork tender and cooked just the way I ordered.   Some notable dishes were the fish tacos, and the fettuccine w/alfredo sauce.  They looked great. Now onto dessert(did I spell that one right?).  Guess what everyone had except for me?  Cheesecake!  There must have been 9 different types of cheesecake on the table when everyone ordered.  I did get to sample a chocolate and Key Lime.  Very good.  Kudos to  Cheesecake Factory and to David our server!!"
Michael H.,"Columbia, IL",9,149,21,2.0,10/16/2012,"I used to like TCF quite a bit, as my past review can show. I'm not sure that I will be returning since we received raw chicken pot stickers, and were not compensated and barely apologized to... it is just one of those things you can't get out of your head."
Rebecca C.,"University City, Saint Louis, MO",8,60,13,4.0,3/18/2013,"I'm not sold on chain resturants, but they have done a tremendous job at upgrading the menu!"
Elgene C.,"Mascoutah, IL",1,7,,4.0,7/26/2012,"Big portions! No need to order large amount. Smaller plates will do THEN grab some deserts. My wife and I always get the red velvet cake. It's tasty. Don't believe the hype either, even though it's a chain restaurant, the food is still better than most around the area. Appetizers are good too. Try their stuffed mushroom, calamaris crab cakes, and soup of the day. I didn't even use to eat shrooms but this made me a fan.  For small plates, I tried their Vietnamese tacos and I really liked it. Also, I tried their sandwiches but can't remember which one ( might have been blackened chicken sandwich) and it was good but apparently not THAT good. HAHA. Bottom line, the atmosphere and their food is enough for me to give it a 4-star. Price is fair. The patio is the place to be on cooler days."
Natalie R.,"Lawrenceburg, KY",1,59,15,5.0,9/5/2014,"Love, love, love the Cheesecake Factory!!! I hadn't been to one in years. The menu has grown considerably, which I appreciated. Service was average. The food was delicious and arrived in huge portions. The cheesecake was perfection!! I had the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Yum!!!"
Mina I.,"Chicago, IL",570,150,154,3.0,1/11/2012,"This is your typical chain restaurant but I actually enjoy coming here for a meal or even just to get a dessert. They have a huge assortment in regards to their menu; such as over 9 different varieties of salads (I love their Cobb and caesar salad), different types of proteins, many to choose from their appetizers (I love their Mac and cheese bites), burgers (I just ate their bacon cheeseburger with fries last night - very juicy and delicious), and of course, their many assortments of cheesecake! I for one love to indulge in their red velvet, snickers and their Godiva chocolate cheesecake. They are all very yummy!"
Margo C.,"Saint Louis, MO",65,137,,4.0,12/31/2011,"2 p.m. New Years Eve Day I thought no one would be out...WRONG.  The place was a~ buzz. Wait time 25 minutes. Our mission was to eat big or go home.  They have some Skinnyluscious menu that we laughed at and threw to the wind.  The regular menu is quite intense. So many choices that you have to play the ""I've narrowed it down to this"" conversation. For an appetizer we had  the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls (4 large, crunchy, breaded, deep fried balls) served a top of Marinara sauce.  Winner! I ordered the lunch Shepards Pie which was a huge loss.  When the waiter inquired about  my satisfaction I told him there was probably nothing wrong with the dish ,but it was not a taste I was EVER going to acquire.  He brought me a  menu and took away the dish.  I opted for the Chinese Chicken Salad and lunch was back on track. My easy to please husband had the Fish and Chips. Nicely breaded crunchy filets served with hot crunchy fries and cole slaw.  We saved the best for last and shared a piece of the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. Rich , smooth and creamy with large glazed strawberries and whipped cream.  Hey, I am excited I had a 4 star experience on my last meal of 2011!"
Michael P.,"Hammond, LA",33,51,38,5.0,11/20/2012,Everything here is great!  The spicy shrimp and the crab Rangoon were incredible Keep up the great job!
Sara B.,"Wheaton, IL",12,1658,13,4.0,8/18/2010,Went here with a friend after s bit of shopping. The pasta was really enjoyable and I am not someone who normally gets dessert.  We shared a piece of cheesecake and it was so delicious. I can see why this place is all over. Amazing The menu is a bit overwhelming but just ask the waiters for their suggestions and they help out and direct you pretty well. Good chain restaurant.
Lupe D.,"Chicago, IL",158,431,427,4.0,7/9/2012,"I've been here a couple of times.  No complaints whatsoever.  I prefer to just go for a slice of cheesecake and some coffee rather than an entire meal.   The last time I went I had the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake. Um yeah - WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!  love it!  It was like eating a huge Almond Joy - if my heart could take it I would eat one everyday.   We only had to wait about 5 minutes, and this was on a Friday night.  On every visit, our servers were always very nice.    I know that there are a TON of great dessert places to frequent in the LOU, but I wouldn't discount this place just because it's a chain - their cheesecakes are really good.  If I am too tired after a day of walking around the mall, I would definitely just park it here and have a slice!"
Mandie M.,"Saint Louis, MO",233,559,348,4.0,8/21/2011,"Honestly since moving to STL I haven't been to many ""chain"" restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is one of my most favorite places to visit. The food is always delightful, but of course the menu is is almost always overwhelming to look at. Too many pages with too many decisions to make. This past visit I went with apps and dessert on my mind. I don't think I have ever had a complaint with the food.  Now this particular cheesecake factory must be on my ""do not visit again"" list only because I almost slipped and fell on my ass! The floor is so slippery and the heels I was wearing that night did not have much of a grip. I am thankful I was able to grab the wall to keep balance. Why must the floor be so slippery? I get that it is marble, but really? Maybe they should have signs or something to warn people. I was a little upset about having to slide my feet while walking to and from the entrance. Not cool cheesecake factory-Galleria Mall-Not cool.  Food=Win Atmosphere= Win Marble Floor= FAIL"
Doug M.,"Pekin, IL",0,13,8,3.0,8/9/2014,"Meal was good, but not worth the price. The menu was way to big, it was more like a short story than a menu."
Luke M.,"McKinley Heights, Saint Louis, MO",24,64,31,4.0,6/20/2012,I personally had never experienced TCF until this evening. I walked away stuffed and satisfied. The food was better than average quality for a chain.  The portions here are humongous so getting the smaller plates is a better deal. Tried the crab and artichoke dip with a Macaroni & Cheeseburger. Good lord. Didn't need all that.  Also a huge positive was a friendly server who was attentive and intelligent. Rare in chain restaurants!
Richard E.,"Saint Louis, MO",6,232,66,4.0,9/4/2013,"The menu here is big enough to beat someone to death with and the variety is staggering. Everything I saw being served looked amazing and the dishes I tried were all flavorful and well presented. The prices seem high, but honestly are fair for the food that is being served. The server was friendly and helpful in making menu recommendations. I have never had room to try the cheesecake by the time I finished my dinner, but one look in the desert case and I was convinced I need to start with  dessert next time!"
Mary S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,11,2,4.0,5/6/2014,"I'm totally obsessed with their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad. I order it every time, and it's always delicious. I also love love love their abundant selection of cheesecakes."
Sandy M.,"Melbourne, FL",148,455,41,3.0,8/21/2011,"Pretty good stuff for a chain and they've sorta addressed the enormous portion size issue.  Now they offer a dozen or so small plates for those who don't want to waste 2/3 of their meal and don't want to carry a bag around with them while shopping.  We ordered the potstickers appetizer, fried cheese and crab & artichoke dip.  That was plenty for two people to be not full but satisfied and ready to try on some clothes.  Of course then we blew it by ordering the hershey's chocolate cheesecake!  They still haven't gotten the memo on smaller portions when it comes to cheesecake.  The two of us ate half of one piece and then wasted the rest.  Such a shame! I'll definitely be back, but one of these days I'll remember to shop first and eat second so I don't have to waste the cheesecake!!"
Brian B.,"Saint Louis, MO",19,152,9,3.0,12/24/2011,"I have only been here a couple of times, this is one of the better chain restaurants but (if we are going to compare chains) it can't beat Brio's for overall experience and taste of food, except of course for the cheesecake! Went here recently with a group for lunch, I had the Pasta Marinara which was ok, the cheese Quesadilla appetizers were better.  I didn't get far enough through the enormous menu selection to see that they have a veggie burger, which my co-worker said was very good. We splurged and split several cheesecake options and I had the Peppermint Bark cake which was outstanding.  I still don't understand the interior decor but it and the overall building design is interesting (you don't feel like you are in a mall until you leave)."
Ks K.,"St Paul, MN",7,432,663,4.0,3/21/2012,"Tons of healthy & not so healthy options.  We had some of each.  Make sure to get some cheesecake to go.  (unless you plan better than us & save room for dessert to eat there.) Service was rocking!  Friendly, helpful & efficient.  Whatever they do to train should be exported to all chains, restaurants."
Sherri K.,"Alexandria, VA",667,1035,133,4.0,2/18/2012,"For a chain, I likey. What my son wants, my son gets. Well, not really, but...I think about it.  We were recently in the Lou for a mini vaca, long weekend, family thingy. We had about 40 minutes between events & he was hungry...again. So, we swept into the Factory for a quick lunch. Wings, fries & a coke for the kid. Ahi, salad & a pinot grigio for moi. Perfect service. Attentive & smart server. Good food. Bueno."
Kelti O.,"Kingston, Canada",6,34,12,4.0,3/16/2014,"Vegetarians can eat here! I only came here for desert, which was phenomenal, but the food looked good too. I took stars off for it being super crowded, loud and claustrophobic feeling. Service was good though and food was delicious!"
