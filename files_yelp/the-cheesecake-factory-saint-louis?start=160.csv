Nila J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,,1.0,6/21/2015,"I will NOT be back to this location again. I went there with my sister to eat last night and as usual, it was very crowded and we ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table. No problem. We were seated outside and our waitress appeared to be friendly at first until she had to help serve a large party that was seated next to us about 10 minutes into our meal. After that, it was hard to find her! When she finally did come back around to our section, we asked for napkins & she had an attitude. She disappeared and we didn't receive the napkins until we were almost done with our meal. The worst of all: my sister felt sick from the food and threw up later that night! The service and food use to be ok the previous times we dined there but never again. I would have rather ate at the food court."
Julie L.,"Saint Louis, MO",135,651,2,5.0,2/4/2012,"This has always been my favorite restaurant.  I really can't tell you why but it has been and I think it always will be. However I never make it to dessert if I eat dinner there!! They have a great selection of food and if you can't find something there then you are beyond picky than one can ever imagine. I love the ""romantic"" atmosphere with the dimmed lights and the cozy tables.  If I have to say something negative I do think they cram too many tables into the areas and that you sit too close to your neighbors if you're not in a booth.  Not always comfortable but it does allow more people in the establishment. My husband has now become a fan of CF as well.  Guess it runs in the family!"
Tim G.,"O'Fallon, IL",72,65,539,2.0,1/27/2012,"Obviously, there's not much I can say about The Cheesecake Factory, that hasn't already been said.  This place is a family favorite, especially for birthdays!  Our most recent trip however (25 Jan 12), fell a bit short of what I have come to expect (and love) about TCF.  Typically, I'd give TCF a 4-star rating.  But on this occasion, 2.5 at best. Let's walk through this chronologically... after being seated, our waiter took our drink order.  I asked what kind of single-malt Scotch they had, the waiter was clueless.  I asked him to please ask the bartender for a Scoth list.  No harm... I ultimately ended up ordering one of my favorites, an Oban.  However, it was brought to me in a brandy snifter!  Don't like drinks not properly served!   The Cheesecake Factory is known for it's liberal appetizers!  In most cases, the appetizer is usually enough to satisfy a moderate appetite.  I must assume the economy crunch and rising price of food has severely impacted TCF's ability to serve these appetizers, at a moderate price.  All of the appetizers we ordered were small quantities/size.  No longer a value for the price paid.  Just skip the appetizer and go straight to the entree! All of the entrees were fine, not remarkable, but fine.  My daughter ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp (her favorite).  Unfortunately, half-way though her meal, she found a hair on her plate.  Her meal ended there!  Now I realize, occasionally, things like this happen in every restaurant.  Not that they should, but the plain fact is they do.  But the damage is usually mitigated by the staff's response.  The waiter immediately brought it to the attention of the manager, who promptly came to the table, apologized, and offered to do whatever was necessary to make it right.  That's the response I expect, and that made the occurance less unpleasant.   My other daughter, who was celebrating her birthday, had the New Orleans Shrimp.  She liked it, but to me, it seemed to be a bit scarce on the shrimp/sausage.  This was hidden by an exorbitant amount of white rice (enought to feed the whole family) used to fill in far too much empty space on the plate!  My son had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and seemed to really enjoy it.  I had the Hibachi Steak.  Not bad, but way over-priced for the small cut of beef.  The shiitake mushroom/bean sprout/onion topping was exceptional, though!  It was accompanyed by tempura-battered asparagus.  That was incredible.  Unfortunately, it only came with two spears.  All things considered, our entrees were, well, satisfying. Dinner was rounded out with what else?  Cheesecake!  I mean why go there and not have cheescake for dessert.  Right?  The plethora of choices and trying to decide on which cheescake to have, is part of the fun.  Call me unadventurous, but I always get the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut!  It's my favorite, and in my mind the best!  But that's always a matter of personal opinion.  All of the cheesecake here is exceptional!  It happened to be my daughter's birthday.  The waiter brought her cheescake to the table with a candle.  It was beautifully presented with the words ""happy birthday"" written on the plate's border in chocolate syrup.  Nice. So, in the end, I'd characterize this visit to TCF as fine.  I'm disappointed in the reduction in portion size, though, as this has always been part of the TCF's niche.   I think I left this as a tip, but always do the 30-minute call-ahead seating.  Oh, BTW, they did remove my daughter's entree (the one with the hair), from the bill."
Kevin R.,"St Louis, MO",11,124,16,5.0,3/7/2013,I've always stayed away from this place thinking all the hype would let me down in my experience. Wow was i missing something. The Fettuccine alfredo is the best I have had in a long time sauce is amazing my sons chicken strips were great the breading is oh so good. My wife had some type of fish and I thought she'd never stop raving about it I believe it was the Thai fish special anyhow lunch specials til 5 pm make it a little more affordable but overall 65 dollars for us three with drinks money well spent.
Jake K.,"Littleton, CO",135,101,17,4.0,10/24/2011,"One thing you should know...I am not a fan of ""chain"" restaurants and I don't like that I'm even writing a review, but I want to share my experience. Fish tacos...pretty good.  Definitely above average.  They come in an order of four and are pretty tasty.   Cheescake...of course some of the best in the world.  I've tried a lot of places around the world and they do it pretty good. Atmosphere...very chain-like and often way too busy to feel like anything more.  I find that rather than wait for a table, if I head to the bar I can get a table and service immediately. Worth checking out, but again I say that as a non-fan of chains."
Beth B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,13,,4.0,6/26/2011,"My family recently visited this restaurant with another couple.  Its beautiful inside, and the atmosphere is open and friendly. I believe the primary drawback about this restaurant is the table spacing. They were all awfully close together! You just about felt as if you were sitting with the family in the table next to you.  The food was delicious and the cheesecake was obviously great! Our wait staff was exceptional! We were there with our 13 month old daughter and our waiter brought her a small plate of chopped up banana and soft breads to keep her pacified while we waited."
Mike M.,"Cincinnati, OH",195,314,64,2.0,12/12/2012,this place is so wildly overrated. the portions are too dang big and serve as an homage to gluttony and capitalism. yikes!  this is turning political.  but it's true. the menu is too dang big too and has repetitive options disguised as variety. the prices are too dang big. the decor is too dang gaudy. i am not a fan. is the food good?  it's ok.
Josh S.,"Mableton, GA",57,293,4,3.0,11/3/2010,"I love cheesecake, yet I was so full by the end of the meal that I didn't have any :( I don't have anything bad to say about the place, it just didn't stand out above the crowd. Our waiter was attentive and nice and our drinks were never more than half empty (or were they half full) .  As everyone says the portions are huge, enough to take some home for leftovers. That being said, their prices are indicative of the portions being large. The lunch menu offers smaller portions at a smaller price, but it would be nice to see them offer regular and small portions. Not than I myself would take advantage of the smaller portions, but I'm sure many would.  The food and service was A-OK."
Bea B.,"Scott AFB, IL",8,15,,4.0,2/21/2014,"Had dinner there today and our server Rica was exceptional! I ordered the veggie burger with a side salad which was  ok, my hubby & oldest son got the burger and the middle of the burger was raw!  They came back the second time around with the burgers and my sons was still raw! At that point I spoke to the MGR and he apologized and offered to cook something else for my son. And he also removed the burger from our bill. Other than getting the burger raw twice everything else was good."
Monsieur E.,"Saint Louis, MO",19,53,11,3.0,10/31/2012,Such a big menu its hard to go wrong. There is always a wait to get in this place which sucks and it lacks a little personal attention. I feel like I am just pushed through the whole experience.
Don H.,"O'Fallon, IL",0,13,1,5.0,1/1/2014,"My wife & I went to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate the New Year because we've always loved the food.  Had a great time; The food took a little longer than normal, but we didn't mind the extra time together.  Next thing we know, Jeff- the Manager on duty, comes over to our table... He sincerely apologized for the wait, and wanted to make sure we were truly taken care of.  He gave us each a free dessert, and at the end of the dinner, he thanked us for coming in...apologized again for the wait...and walked with us to the door.  Bothe he and our waitress Samantha went out of their way to make sure we had an EXCELLENT experience...and we did!  We'll be back.  Ps...Did we mention the food was amazing? :)"
Jeff H.,"Springfield, MO",2,35,4,5.0,9/15/2011,"This is my favorite place to eat in STL. My personal favorite dish is the ""Spicy Cashew Chicken"". Very friendly staff, always clean. I wouldn't change a thing. LOVE IT !!!"
Luke S.,"Jefferson City, MO",1,181,67,5.0,12/17/2013,Amazing cheesecake and fantastic pasta and Italian dishes. It's very clean the the staff is very nice. I go here every time I visit the St. Louis Galleria. If your looking for some premium food for a good price then The Cheesecake Factory is the place for you.
Sarah N.,"Denver, CO",37,81,8,3.0,7/30/2010,"This place comes with a lot of pros, but there's always a con to back it up.  Cheesecake Factory is expensive, but they give you enormous portions.  The food tastes pretty good, but it doesn't taste as good as it should for having no less than 1000 calories per serving.  The cheesecake is good, but once again, the typical slice will run you $8 (unless you had an awesome FB coupon for $1.50 like I did yesterday.. never eating cheesecake again) and has approximately 1400 calories. This place is always crowded, and the service is hit or miss.  One time I went and the waitress was great, the next time I don't think my water glass got filled once. If you're at all interested in being health conscious, avoid Cheesecake Factory.  If not, go wild."
Andie P.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,6,,4.0,8/5/2013,"Got the four cheese pasta with chicken and it was pretty good. Not too cheesy and had a decent range of flavors. The portion was great, got the lunch not dinner portion and was still too full at the end to order dessert. Not a bad place to eat but a little pricey to make it a daily occurrence."
Kelly B.,"Saint Louis, MO",551,809,2820,5.0,7/2/2008,"Coming from a person who does not like chain restaurants, I have to say I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I was addicted to it when I lived in California and unlike most chain restaurants, it has only gotten better with time. They have over 200 menu options including pizza, pasta, seafood, steaks, salads, sandwiches, burgers, and more. And they have over 50 delicious cheesecakes and desserts.  Menu choices reflect an Americanized fusion of ethnic cuisines from around the world.  They have done a fine job of coming up with creative items that please the masses.  They also have a large number of healthy choices.   I love the pear endive salad, avocado egg rolls, Thai lettuce wraps, shrimp with angel hair pasta and whole lot of other items.  They've got some great lunch and brunch specials too! You will feel  like you're in a cattle call once they give you a ""chain restaurant beeper"" to use while you wait for a table.  And the decor is Disney World meets rustic Bistro.  But, the food stands up."
Kathleen S.,"Nashville, TN",26,30,6,1.0,5/18/2010,"I've never been happy or excited by anything I've eaten at the Cheesecake factory. Overpriced, and funny that almost everything on their menu shows up on bad column in ""Eat This, Not That"" listings.  No but really. Overpriced. And their simple food is never good...probably because they can't concentrate on a handful of dishes because they offer 394853 menu items.  Yesterday I ordered fish tacos, and the fish was so hard and overcooked I was convinced I got the chicken tacos, and had to ask the waiter.  That's all. Just don't waste your money. There is better food in the Galleria food court."
Austin D.,"Saint Louis, MO",90,29,12,4.0,12/22/2012,Avacado Chicken Club sandwich and Red Velvet Cheesecake made an awesome lunch combination. Stuffed!
Julia P.,"Saint Louis, MO",37,146,3,1.0,4/23/2010,"Ew. Gross.  I've tried three separate Cheesecake Factories now and the last two attempts have been terrible experiences. It goes something like this: You go in and see the big, diverse menu. Score! Hell Yeah! Five stars! The service is okay at best, but I'm really excited about the food- four stars! The portions are huge! Holymother! But the food is just okay. Three stars. The cheesecake is amazing! Four stars. Then you pay your check- ""you want HOW MUCH?!!?"" three stars. You feel kind of gross afterwards and think, hm, I must be too full. You realize later that you will be spending the rest of your day in pain and or in the bathroom... but you still have all these leftovers that you think you should eat because you paid $20 for a lunch! One star."
Beto D.,"San Francisco, CA",149,128,13,3.0,3/13/2013,"The Menu was out of control...if you have problems making decisions - think twice about coming here because they must have over 200 options to choose from. So, here are my thoughts...our server was friendly & fast, our food was good, the vibe was good, and the restaurant for as busy as it was...was fairly clean. The prices were not too bad either. If you want an A-Ok place to eat, check it out."
