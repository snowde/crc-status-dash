Beatrice B.,"Belleville, IL",0,4,,5.0,10/6/2013,"My very first review on Yelp, and it will be the wonderful cheesecake factory! This is the first and only time I have ever been here (hopefully won't be the last) and it was a very good experience.  We got seated right away and the menu was very big, a little too big because it probably took me 20 minutes to decide what to get. I ended up getting the BBQ Pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. Oh man it did not disappoint at all. For dessert I had a cheesecake which I forgot what it was called but it had peanut butter, peanut butter cups and butterfinger in it. Probably a thousand calories but very delicious."
Carolyn C.,"New York, NY",64,198,1,4.0,12/30/2009,"OK, just in case you were in the dark like I was 'til last night: Did you know that Cheesecake Factory offers CURBSIDE TAKEOUT?  8:01 p.m. - Order placed via phone for a Chinese Chicken Salad and Spaghetti w/ Meat Sauce. 8:02 p.m. -  Girl on Phone: ""Would you like complimentary bread with that tonight?"" Me, thinking: Um, is Vogue the best magazine on earth? Duh.  8:03 p.m. - Girl on Phone: ""Would you like to try our curbside take-out tonight?"" Me: ""Does this cost extra?"" Girl: ""Nope, just call us when you pull up and we'll bring your food out."" 8:20 p.m. - We pull up in front of the restaurant and they bring our order to the car!  8:28 p.m. - Home eating our fab meal and gaining 10 pounds in the process. (Where the minus 1 star comes in - The portion sizes are out of control. Hello, obesity.) But, who cares if you are fat if you can skip the 1 hour and 45 minute wait bullshit and potential face plans in the slush of a parking lot!"
Leah D.,"Kittery, ME",72,143,34,5.0,8/18/2012,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory! This location is always busy with hungry shoppers and locals who just want some good eats and yummy cheesecake. I suggest getting there right when you're starting to get hungry. It takes awhile for food, but it is worth the wait. Can't go wrong with a strawberry lemonade or a good martini. Everything on the menu is delicious!!"
Stephanie S.,"Saint Louis, MO",107,705,28,4.0,1/18/2010,"I could have sworn I already reviewed this place! Oh well.  I know it's a chain, but like other reviewers have said, it's really good for a chain restaurant. I've been here dozens of times and have tried many things from the menu, and I've not been disappointed yet.  It's hard for me to recommend any one thing. Everything is really good. The portion sizes are HUGE. And the cheesecake is to die for. It's really really good.  The servers are usually very friendly. The only thing that has been consistently poor (for me) are the mixed drinks. Every time I've ordered one of their fruity, slushy cocktails, they just taste bad. I can't really explain it. Bad bartenders? The alcoholic drinks, in my experience, also take a while to come out. So I have to deduct one star for that.  Other than that, it's all good. So just go already!"
Eric Y.,"Nevada, MO",73,64,,4.0,6/3/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is great.  There is so much more to offer besides cheesecake.  The food is good, but the menu is too big.  Too many choices.  I have always thought that the menu should be made smaller (I think Chef Ramsay would agree).  Serving sizes are large, so I always have something to take home for lunch the next day...gotta save room for cheesecake so you can't get too full!"
Dave S.,"Benicia, CA",106,151,2,4.0,4/27/2010,"Yes. I'll start by saying this is the first time I have been to the Cheese Cake Factory. As one of the people in our work group has a horrible allergy to anything that contains soy, it was a safe bet since all of the ingredients that the Cheesecake Factory uses are in a database. This was a bonus since it meant a very low risk for me having to stab my coworker again with an epi pen.  Not wanting to have a bad experience, I kept it simple. Rib Eye, medium rare and salad. Rib eye came out exactly as I ordered, with a very good marbling and quality texture and flavoring. And the salad was very tasty too. It met my expectations of being good and simple. I stayed away from the ceasear's salad and anything with more complexity.  So, yes, the place is a chain. And anyone that knows me knows how adamant I am about chains, but they did pretty damn good.  Staffing was cool and service was prompt. Only real thing that was weird is they with the party of 14, we had to sit at two different table groupings and when the check came, they brought a check for each grouping. When I said, ""We should just get one check. Thanks!"" They said they couldn't because it would mess their tip up. I'm not quite sure how that would happen, and I'm not quite sure why that meant we couldn't charge it as one, but ultimately that was not a big deal."
Josh L.,"Normal, IL",22,59,10,4.0,11/20/2010,"What can I say.  It's an excellent experience no matter where I am.  If there's a Cheesecake Factory, it's going to be delicious! This time around I chose the Chicken Carbonera and it was yummy in my tummy.  My wife had the Lulu Salad upon recommendation of the waitress.  She was leaning toward an Asian Chicken salad (which sounded similar) but went with the recommendation.  She said it was delicious! For desert, and there is always desert because it's the CHEESECAKE Factory, we had Chocolate/Caramel-something cheesecake.  It had caramel drizzled all over it along with freshly made whipped cream.  So good!"
Rachelle W.,"Brentwood, MO",0,22,,1.0,8/30/2014,"I very much enjoy Cheesecake Factory everywhere I travel but I've given this location 3 tries and have been disappointed every time, twice food was overlooked, salmon was dry and not food in general not fresh, food badly seasoned over or under. I don't understand how they can be so much worse than the 6 other locations I have been to in 4 other states. They have never disappointed me until I went here and I gave it two more tries to see if it was just a bad day but was disappointed each time."
Michael B.,"Saint Louis, MO",21,102,102,4.0,9/21/2012,"Pretty good food, lots and lots to choose from. Not cheap but a great place to split dishes and enjoy the atmosphere."
Nichole H.,"Saint Louis, MO",148,7,,1.0,2/15/2014,"I had the displeasure of dining at the Cheesecake Factory in the Galleria this week. Let me start off by saying that while my server was training, this is no reflection of his abilities, but rather the lack of customer service on the Factory. I ordered the portabello mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries but was delivered just zucchini. No big deal, the server goofed, I can live. When my buffalo tenders came out sans the buffalo, I still said nothing. I ordered a side dipping sauce so that the server wouldn't get in trouble. Finally, I took a few bites of my caesar salad, only to pull out a hair. That was my final straw. I let the server that was training the new server know about what had happened. The entire time I kept a smile on my face. The manager came over and explained how ""these things happen"" and he was very apologetic. I asked for a new salad and then we ordered cheesecake. Our table was a $100 ticket and the manager decided to comp the $5 salad. I served for 5 years and in my experience, that was the worst possible outcome of how to handle this. I am not happy nor will I ever return. I advise you to not chance it as well."
Sylvester T.,"Saint Louis, MO",783,140,26,4.0,3/11/2012,Had a great time at this location .....I was with my friend and i enjoyed the atmosphere. The service and food was great. I had the Terriyaki Chicken and rice & a nice appetizer. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a nice restaurant on a Saturday night.
Haozhe Z.,"Richmond Heights, Saint Louis, MO",0,1,,4.0,3/24/2013,"Overall it's good enough, but the da Vinci pasta is not as good as I expected. The cheesecakes are brilliant."
Laura M.,"Saint Louis, MO",14,81,15,4.0,6/20/2012,"I typically don't write reviews about chain restaurants, but I went here for the first time last night and it was awesome! The menu is HUGE and so are the portions. We started with the crab artichoke dip which was really good, and I got the Thai Lettuce Wraps which were amazing!! They came with plenty of condiments (bean sprouts, noodles, carrots, cucumbers, chicken, 3 different types of sauces). My boyfriend got the Macaroni and Cheese Burger and said it was really good also. I'm not typically into cheesy, chain restaurants, but I will definitely go back here again!"
Chauna W.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,2,,2.0,7/23/2014,"I come to the cheesecake often on my break. This particular time, my waitress was so rude. She didn't offer me bread and had an attitude when I asked for new silverware. My wings came without the buffalo sauce and fries. I waited like an extra ten minutes for my fries. I love the Cheesecake Factory just didn't enjoy my time this time."
Daniel F.,"Lafayette Square, Saint Louis, MO",76,211,2,3.0,12/29/2011,"I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.  Archetypal chain place with encyclopedia-sized menu and noisy, bustling atmosphere.  But - the food is pretty good , service hit or miss depending on server and how busy things are.  However, there is something (or many somethings) for everyone here.  If you dine at the bar area during happy hour there is a special food menu that is VERY reasonable - just a tip."
Jay D.,"Saint Louis, MO",48,57,5,2.0,4/26/2011,"The following was an email i sent to them... Good day.  First I will say I think i might have visited CF for the last time.  In general the quality seems to be decreasing and the menu is too overwhelming.  But that is not the main issue I have at this time.  I visited the location in the Galleria Mall yesterday around 6pm.  Upon entering the restaurant, my companion and I almost slipped on the floor.  We both looked around and saw nothing on the floor and noticed the floor was just slick.  We ignored it and walked to get seated.  As we walked towards our table, my friend almost slipped again and I lost footing as well.  We talked to the waitress about this and she laughed and said they get daily complaints about the floor.  It's marble, but I am sure marble floor does not have to be dangerous.   During our dinner we witnesses no less than five people, servers and patrons, almost slip on the floor. That was just our little section.  So I can imagine what its like restaurant wide!! One server did slip and dropped some dishes, breaking them.  I was baffled that this is acceptable for the restaurant.  I assume a cracked skull on the floor will have to happen to remedy this situation.   My second issue was the drinks.  I ordered the Margarita and I am hard pressed to believe there was any alcohol in it.  It was overly sugary and tart. Just bad.  Horrible to be honest.  I did not finish it or return it as I was just amazed at how poor my whole experience was and did not want to waste my time.  The food was just ""meh"", Including the cheesecake and the icing on the cake was my silverware was dirty and had to be replaced.  .  We paid our tab and slipped and slid back to the mall where we could get sound footing.  I will be honest.  That floor is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  And with the multitude of complaints the waitress claims, it will be huge.   So I hope someone actually reads this.  I was about to try and do some research to get the addresses of management and corporate offices, but that would be a waste of time.  Jay"
joyce h.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,181,,4.0,5/4/2012,"The same as pretty much any other Cheesecake Factory, but less of a wait than in other locations.  The main reasons I wouldn't give this 5 stars: Parking and Noise. There are so many businesses in the Galleria that face Brentwood Boulevard; I don't know how the parking can be solved. It's pretty bad to walk out in the dark into this parking lot, esp. if it's raining and if you arrived at a busy time for the neighboring businesses and had to park far away. The noise level here is very high; again, don't know how to solve it, but maybe more privacy around the booths.  This is an attractive, well located eatery with a national name and claim to fame."
Evan L.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,3,,1.0,5/26/2015,DON'T ORDER THE PLASTIC TACO PLATE!   Tonight I ordered the 3 soft taco's for dinner.  There were two surprises that came with this order:   The first was that at my very last bite I was chewing on something that didn't seem to be taco related.  Upon spitting it out it turned out to be a plastic bread bag twisy.  The flat plastic thing with a hole in it to clamp the plastic bag shut.  Yum!  had I swallowed it I would have wound up in the ER.  I promptly told my waitress who rushed it over to the manager.  This leads me to my second surprise..... this manager NEVER came over.  I had to hunt HIM down.  I explained that I didn't know which was most disappointing.  Eating a plastic bread bag holder or his not caring enough to come apologize.  He began giving me a song and dance about his other woes in the kitchen.  It was truly unbelievable.  I can't fatham having his little plastic disc stuck in my throat and with no apology from him.  Bye Bye Cheesecake.  Nice doing buisiness with ya.
Benjamin D.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,14,,2.0,6/2/2012,"I have been here three times.  The first time was good, the next time was horrible, and the more recent time was closer to horrible than good.  I have a feeling my really good food the first time was a fluke. I have several issues with this establishment.  First, the seating arrangements.  You are either allowed to sit in an incredibly uncomfortable booth, or you are allowed to sit at an incredibly uncomfortable table with the next table practically in your lap.  The tables are so close that a guest at the table next to ours knocked our pepper shaker off of our table with his behind while he was squeezing between the tables. My second issue, is the music.  If the music is so loud, that even when yelling at the server they cannot hear you, it might be an indication that the music is too loud.  Just my thoughts. The food the last two times was just ""meh"".  This last time, mine was way too salty, and the time before that, my friend had to return his dish because it was even saltier than mine.   Admittedly, I have not tried the desert; the main course discouraged me."
Ximena C.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,1,,3.0,8/19/2012,"I have always had a good experience at TCF, the key word here being ""good"". Last night however, I ordered Davinci pasta, one of my favorites, and to my surprise they decided to also add carrots (not part of the meal) and another type of pasta as it had been combined with another type of pasta dish. I complained to the waitress to which she only said ""oh so sorry"" did not offer to change it, remove from bill or anything!  I'm very easy to please, and the way i addressed the issue to the waitress was very polite. I deserved a better answer. On top of that, my boyfriend was up all night with food poisoning even if there was nothing ""apparently"" wrong with is meal. Very disappointed, and upset with this restaurant."
