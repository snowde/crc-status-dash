Mike B.,"Saint Louis, MO",49,88,13,4.0,10/25/2010,"I rarely if ever eat at or highly recommend a national chain.... However, if you have a hankering for dessert, do not pass this place up because of its chain status."
Ashley L.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,42,18,4.0,3/16/2010,"The cheesecake factory is a good call if you're not sure of where to go. The menu is huge, almost to a fault because it's hard to decide what to order. The plus side of having a lot of menu options is there will be something for everyone. Certain menu items seem pricey, but the portions will make up for it."
Hans G.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",64,372,1,3.0,1/14/2006,"Decent food, gianormous servings, passable service.  Seems to me like the theme park version of a nice restaurant; this is fine dining the way that Epcot is international. Rarely is one gluttonous enough to have an entree here and still order cheesecake.  As you might imagine, the cheesecake is the reason to visit; so I recommend sharing food if possible. This would be 5 stars for a cheesecake bakery, and 3 for a restaurant."
Joe L.,"Fairview Heights, IL",11,6,,2.0,3/16/2010,"I do like the food at Cheecake Factory but the service staff and hostess leaves much to be desired especially in St. Louis, MO Galleria area.  Their call ahed sitting is a big JOKE.  I would recommend this place if it had better staffing."
Dawn Marie S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,15,,5.0,9/10/2012,Wonderful place to have lunch. Beautiful decor. Amazing food. Large portions. The cheesecake is soooooo good! Knowledgeable and friendly staff. All around great experience. :)
C K.,"Saint Louis, MO",64,228,3,3.0,10/3/2009,"Based solely on the food, Cheesecake Factory would get four stars.  I know, it's a chain restaurant, but it's really very good for a chain restaurant.  The menu is absolutely gigantic -- I'm not sure if I've seen a bigger menu, well, anywhere -- and I almost always enjoy what I get.  Their portions are in general pretty huge, and they have a ton of varieties of cheesecake. I do have one big complaint, however, that discourages me from going here (despite the fact that my wife would like to go more): The crowd.  This place is ALWAYS *really* busy.  It seems that if you go here during the dinner rush (which seems to last from 5:30 to 8:30, give or take), you're almost always guaranteed a 40-60 minute wait.  There are other good places around that don't take nearly as long. Oh, and as an aside, their iced tea is flavored and really gross. Anyway.  Good place to go to in general, but be prepared to wait."
Sherah B.,"San Rafael, CA",98,237,20,4.0,10/22/2009,"I'm not big on restaurant chains, but I do LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. I sometimes daydream about the fried macaroni & cheese appetizer..and the delish fried chicken sandwich sliders. Yum. My friends and I love going here. The prices aren't too bad and the food is great. Plus, there is a lot to choose from which makes it nice. Love it!"
Heather N.,"Brookline, MO",10,39,,5.0,1/1/2006,"If there were 6 stars, this restaurant would get it.  Huge menu.  Great food.  Huge portions.  Fabulous drinks.  Great services.  The downside is that there's quite a wait, but it's not enough of a downside to drop the restaurant a star. Smoke free, of course.  The cheesecake is take-home - almost mandatory.  It usually takes me three sittings to finish a piece because it's so rich.  Lunch is the best time to visit. If you can arrive before 11:30 a.m., you can avoid waiting. hln"
Victor M.,"Franklin, TN",0,22,,3.0,3/4/2012,"Slow.  Unfortunately we go all the time and it's always slow.  If they tell you 20 mins, it will be 45 mins.  Be ready to order cuz once the waitress leaves to get your drinks, it will be a while.   Once u order, the food will take a long time.  They just don't have enough staff."
DJ J.,"Waco, TX",25,93,,2.0,12/30/2010,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, how you disappointed me We came in and the waitress and host were very friendly. I decided to go with a classic fish tacos. Whats not to love about fish tacos!? Clearly you can't ruin fish tacos, so I thought. The tacos were an utter disappointment. Yeah, silly me for not realizing there is cabbage, but I can bare it. The tacos were not only grossly underseasoned,  they were bitter and dry.The beans and rice were just awful-- bland but with an ashy, crap texture. Being the punk that I am, I wasn't going to return it, but my friend suggested that I do-and I'm glad she did. I was hesitant but I told the waiter I didn't like it, and she told me I can get another sauce to help the dish taste better. The sauce made it worse. So I asked her to send it back and the waitress got an attitude with me, giving me a stern look and putting the menu right in front of my face when I wanted to order something else. REALLY?!?!?! The manager eventually came over and gladly replaced my dish. I got the four seasons pizza. No, this pricey pizza was not great by any means but I also didn't want to waste 40 minutes of my life waiting on a 8 dollar grilled cheese sandwich I could've made in 2 minutes. Carrot cake was awesome, but it surely doesnt overshadow the bad service I received."

Lee T.,"Washington, DC",4,7,,2.0,12/14/2008,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory today for Sunday brunch.  Was told the wait would be 5-10 but was more like 10-15, but we were seated in a booth which was better than the marble 2-tops that are too close to your neighbors.   I should say that I am picky on service and general cleanliness and the place scored well on both of those counts.  The low rating stems from the food itself.  I've eaten at this place several times and found the food about 3-star quality, but they always give you too much food.   Today I ordered the steak and eggs off of the brunch menu.  Since I work out and pay attention to what I eat, I was interested in swapping the standard potato side dish with some fruit, but the waitress said they did not have any fruit and all she could offer me was slaw, green beans, or fried onion rings.  I decided to stick with the breakfast potatoes.  When the food arrived, I was surprised to find the steak in pieces.  I just assumed the steak would be in one piece.  Bad assumption.  Instead, I got about 6 steak parts.  They were cooked to medium doneness as I had asked, but with them so small (about the size of small sausage patties) there was not much red to the tiny little insides.  Net effect was kinda charred.  Add to that that the potatoes were pretty black, the flavor was too far gone.  Eggs were good but just plain scrambled eggs.  No garnish.  Just some yellow and black on the plate.  The toast arrived on a separate small plate, too small to hold the slippery little halves of toast, so one piece slid overboard as the server put the plate on the table.  All they had was white toast.  Would have preferred wheat or multigrain and I hope you like strawberries jam cause that's all they had for toast.  So, all in all, for $15, I felt like I've had much better food for less.  I'll go back but will avoid the steak and eggs."
Justin K.,"Burlingame, CA",1,226,124,3.0,7/11/2009,if it weren't in the galleria it would get 4 stars but the people all look like thugs in the mall. The food is always high quality for chain restaurant cuisine and boy are the portions HUGE
Andrew W.,"Wheaton, IL",4,1128,,4.0,10/4/2010,"when i need a reliable staple, cheesecake factory is there for me. a couple in every city."
Luciana B.,"Chicago, IL",239,77,,5.0,9/18/2007,"I love Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, the service is fast, its not too expensive (if you do it ""split a lot of shit"" style), and the decor is great. I sometimes wish it was a bit brighter, but I guess that makes it fancy and mysterious or something ::shrugs:: I like this place for dinner or lunch just about any time. The one in Chicago at the Hancock Building is cool because the way the restaurant is set up, it makes you feel like you are inside a pie. Check it out."
Adam O.,"Saint Louis, MO",54,78,10,5.0,7/29/2007,"For a chain, this restaurant is fantastic.  Large portions, make splitting meals almost necessary.  The service is flawless--anytime any mistakes are made, the manager is at your side immediately to correct the problem.  The spinach and artichoke dip is fantastic--though sometimes it needs to be a little hotter.  The crispy chicken costoletta--amazing.  Two people can barely split this dish and finish.  If there is a line for a table--sit at the bar or the high tops near it.  You'll never have to wait."
