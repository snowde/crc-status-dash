Tamandra T.,"Saint Louis, MO",33,104,47,3.0,7/10/2016,"Ive never reviewed Cheesecake Factory as it has been around for years and it never disappoints. I havent been in a little while. This is the place you go when you have multiple indecisive eaters with you as they can pretty much satisfy any palatte with their 30 page menu. Im not going into too much detail because this place has been around for quite a while and if you havent been here before, it's def worth a try.  One of my fav small plates are the chicken samosas. They have changed the recipe since ive had it last and let me say that it was for the better. I love the new filling... now if they would just fill up the cup with the cilantro sauce that would be amazing, i mean the thing only holds like two tbsp anyways, why so stingy???  One of my favorite entrees is the chicken picata. I've actually not had good chicken picata that ive absolutely loved from even italian restaurants that taste better than theirs. I usually have to put salt and pepper on it which is fine but this time it was a little salty. They used way more capers than usual and didnt have a lot of extra sauce to go with the ton of angel hair pasta they give you. Someone else prob would have sent it back but a little excess salt doesnt bother me too much and i also like capers. My cousin had the fried shrimp platter which in all of my years of going to CF's no one has ever ordered it but those shrimp were huge! And cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese was pretty good too. My bf had meatloaf, he liked it but I wasnt impressed by it.  The food was great however service was def lacking here. Our waiter was so not attentive. We had to flag him down for everything. He not once just stopped through unless he was dropping something off. Not only that, our food was slow to come as well. I had ordered a bowl of alfredo pasta for my one year old to come out before our meals and it took forever. Once i asked the waiter about it, he went and got it and i could tell it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time as the pasta on top was a little dried out. One thing that never disappoints at CF's is the cheesecake. Thats the only thing ive found to be extremly consistent nationwide although i can say that most of their foods taste the same. But this location, they need to get some new servers."
Tashika B.,"Soulard, Saint Louis, MO",0,13,33,4.0,3/18/2016,"I always enjoy The Cheesecake Factory's food but not as much as I did 20+ years ago. However I don't enjoy the wait. For newcomers to the factory, you don't have to wait to be seated if you can find a empty high top table. A server will come and clean it if there's food ledt on the table.  The server was polite and patient as I looked over the gigantic menu. Today I had the fried zucchini with house ranch for an advertiser. They were in a word 'delicious.  I had the cajun jambalaya pasta without the chicken, but it has chicken and shrimp. It was good. My sweet tea not so good :("
Matthew W.,"Asheville, NC",32,160,328,4.0,11/22/2015,Great lunch. Nice atmosphere. Very quick too. Was in and out in 30 min and back to the office. The New Orleans pasta is excellent. Just enough spice but not too hot.
Yvette W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,19,20,2.0,3/10/2017,"UPDATE: Although I can't ""recapture"" a lost birthday celebration with out of state family I can appreciate @cheesecake factory attempting to make amends with a gift card to try them again. Now that I'm back in Vegas maybe I'll try a ""redo"" at the location I've never had a problem with my meal or service in Boca Park. Happy they followed up."
Hoogaelric T.,"Saint Louis, MO",144,105,1501,3.0,8/14/2015,"Classic chain restaurant and standard American food. My favorite starting whole grain bread, followed by a great variety of appetizers and entrees. Avocado eggroll, firecracker salmon for appetizers and herb crusted salmon filet, Hibachi/Diane steak or Miso salmon for entrees.  Have quit unhealthy eating for years so couldn't comment on their desserts and cheesecakes, but I'd assume they are awesome blasts of sugar and triglyceride.  4 stars for the food but the following mars the overall: The place can get very busy. People earnestly staring their buzzers, nourishing the hope that their intense gazes can accelerate the timers.  Sometimes meals tailed right after the appetizers.  The menu is awfully l-o-n-g like a book chapter.  Dinner sizes are rather small. Merely meager amount of food sitting lonely in capacious large plates. Once my Hibachi steak looked just hopelessly minute and helplessly hiding behind an intimidating pile of mashed potato, which however looked also minute and tiny in the boundless universe of the plate.  Or it's just me ravenous with an enormous appetite?  The plates are so big that sometimes I wonder if we are to eat the plates. Better yet, I may get some ceramic leftovers."
Dave L.,"Saint Louis, MO",10,11,,2.0,3/18/2017,"Not incredibly busy around 11.  Got a table in the bar.  Our waiter, Aaron, was friendly enough.  Seemed to take an uncharacteristically long time to get drinks, and once he got our order, also uncharacteristically long to get our food.  I got a breakfast omelette and the wife got a burger.  Wife is lactose intolerant, so she asked for her burger without cheese.  I also ordered my omelette with no cheese.  Both dishes came with cheese.  In addition to getting cheese that I didn't order, half my omelette ingredients that I ordered were missing.  It took awhile for Aaron to return, but he offered to have the food remade.  Since the wait was quite long, we declined... opting to just scrape the cheese.   I hope this isn't a trend.  This Cheesecake Factory  has been slipping quite a bit."
Lauren M.,"Mattoon, IL",1,1,,2.0,7/30/2017,"Absolutely horrid service on the patio. Ignored our table multiple times, forgot simple orders and had 4 other employees assist her with waiting on us. Besides the food being phenomenal and my extensive love for cheesecake, I don't think I would care to come back after this."
Greg S.,"Valley Park, MO",0,16,,3.0,3/27/2017,"Food is above average for the price, portions are big, the skinnylicious menu is a great option for calorie counters and people who have dietary restrictions.  The menu is very big  which means lots of options which is great, I recommend sitting in the bar area and be prepared to be there a while as this is a busy chain restaurant."
Stacie W.,"Saint Louis, MO",360,305,2526,4.0,8/17/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is classic. A great place to go to for drinks and dessert. My favorite dish is the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. The centres are hit and miss. The drinks and desserts are delish!!! The portion size for centres is large, more soo when you dine in then carry out. The draw back to this location is parking, especially depending on the time of day. I've been here on numerous occasions and it's a great spot for a romantic evening or casual meal."
Tyler Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/4/2016,"The waitress spilled water in my food and didn't offer to replace it, or even apologize."
Linda B.,"St. Louis, MO",0,3,,1.0,3/4/2017,Usually pretty good. Waited 45 minutes for room temperature food that was dry. Big disappointment today.
La N.,"Krąków, Poland",331,14,23,3.0,8/3/2016,"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday, waited awhile to have our waiter take our order. We ordered an appetizer and a meal to share for both of us. Thinking the appetizer would come before the sandwich. Unfortunately it did not so we received two huge portions at the same time! A little overwhelming. Before the food came out (we waited 20 minutes) our waiter asked us if we wanted bread. Everybody wants the bread at Cheesecake Factory it's what you eat! Anyways we got the bread probably 10 minutes into waiting for our food. The spinach and cheese dip was watery and lacked some flavor it should have definitely already have. But we really liked the Southwest Chicken Sandwich! The French fries that came with were just okay. Overall our waiter was nice but just confused why the process take so long when it wasn't a busy lunch time."
Caprice F.,"Saint Louis, MO",114,425,1309,5.0,7/31/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the nicer national chains that you can find. The menu has a lot of variety so there is something for everyone.  Not to mention they have a fantastic selection of cheesecakes.  You can't go wrong with any of them. They are all delicious! The bread is awesome, specifically the honey wheat brown bread! So good! The service is typically not bad. The prices are kind of high for the entrees ($10 - $20) and the cheesecakes (around $8 - $10 per slice), however they do offer a pretty nice lunch menu. The portions are large so expect left overs. My top pics: crusted chicken romano, godiva cheesecake, factory burger, old fashioned burger, santa fe salad, hersheys chocolate bar cheesecake, and key lime cheesecake. The ambiance is nice and romantic. They usually have somewhat long waits for dinner on the weekends so get there early."
Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1004,1629,3.0,4/13/2016,"I was seeing a 7pm show at Helium Comedy Club on Monday  night so I had about an hour + to kill at the Galleria because I decided if I went home after work I wouldn't make it back in time for the 7pm show. I decided to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. Why doesn't The Galleria have better dining options? I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken.  It was not spicy and the sauce was thick, corn starchy, and cloyingly sweet.  I realize this is The Cheesecake Factory and their target demographic isn't someone with an evolved palate but why does it have to be so bad? Why are they pandering? Oh well. Service was fair and I was never offered the bread basket. This is bad because clearly their wait staff is not offering the customers what they're entitled to but good because I didn't really need the bread even though I would have eaten some if it was there. I should have stuck to the White Chicken Chili, my Cheesecake Factory go-to."
Alyssa G.,"Saint Louis, MO",6,10,4,5.0,1/5/2017,"I always leave here happy! My favorite cheesecake is the chocolate mousse cheesecake, it is sooooo addicting. Love it."
Baby C.,"Chicago, IL",124,97,1018,4.0,3/28/2016,"Went for lunch, of course busy it was Friday, the wait wasn't bad about 15min or so. We got drinks at bar while waiting expensive $10.95 each total $37 not including tip. Our buzzer finally went off -we were seated, ordered our appetizers and more drinks which was good, and our food. Finally of course our CHEESECAKE!"
Shawn V.,"Scott Air Force Base, IL",26,2,1,1.0,4/22/2016,Horrible service and ordered sweet tea and was given sugared water. My kids macaroni wasn't cooked! Waited forever for service and food tastes horrible.
Shay N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",165,149,127,4.0,5/2/2016,I've came to this location several times. Staff is always friendly and the food is always good. Would try the smores cheesecake if you're unsure of what to get!
Jamie S.,"Merritt Island, FL",0,3,,2.0,1/18/2017,"We decided to eat here as we had a $50 gift card. Thank God we did, I would have hated to have paid anymore I did for this meal.  We wanted to make sure we used the card up so I let my kids get whatever they wanted. My daughter and I got a soda and my other daughter got a lemonade. It was $4. Seriously?  She had one glass. Anyway, my older daughter ordered a burger with a Gluten Free bun, nice touch. She can't always get that. My younger daughter got some bread appetizer with sauce to dip in.  My husband got appetizers as did I. He got a bowl of French Onion soup and some lettuce wraps. He said the wraps were good but was disappointed with the soup. It didn't come out like you think French Onion soup would. No cheese baked in a crock...just a big bowl of onion broth. Weird.  I got the Cuban egg roll things. They were so so bad. They said they had ham, pork, pickles and mustard in them (like a Cuban sandwich). They didn't seem to have anything but pork in them. They looked like meat wrapped in a roll. They had 0 flavor. I was happy the waitress noticed they didn't get eaten. And at the end she took them off the bill when I told her I wasn't boxing them up and I didn't like them much. I also got a Sausage Ricotta flatbread appetizer.  I ate one piece. Just no flavor again. What's the deal? We decided on sharing one piece of cheesecake. We got the hazelnut one. It was pretty good but very expensive.  Our bill was $70. That's after one appetizer was taking off. I tipped her $16 so after the gift card we still paid over $30. This meal was no where near good enough to pay that much.  I would never bring my family here to eat again. If they want to charge these prices they need to up their game. The food was no worth it."
Chris Z.,"Avondale Estates, GA",70,1334,858,2.0,3/27/2015,"Cheescake Factory is a good option with a group... their menu is obnoxiously extensive.  If you can't find something you like here, you need to stay home.  Inside the place is enormous, dressed up like a Tuscan palace.  But even with all the opulence, you're always reminded that this place is a chain.  Maybe it's the cheesy waiters, or the fact that they have a gift counter where you can buy shirts, teddy bears and other needless items.  Or maybe it's just that the place is located within the confines of a mall.   The food here is ok... but somehow something is always off.  I was served coffee without a spoon.  The server comes to take your order but they rely on food runners... so after you place your order your waiter has no investment in checking back in.  Our drinks were often empty.  My wife's medium burger was closer to well done... but she still really liked it.  I ordered chicken teriyaki... it was average, but served as a heaping portion.  It was served on a plate with grilled pinapple, a marachino cherry, and cooked banana.  But the banana was left halfway in the peel (like a boat), with a Dole produce sticker still on the outside.  Odd, and unprofessional."
