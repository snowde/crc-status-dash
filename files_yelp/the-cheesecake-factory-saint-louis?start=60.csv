Beth S.,"Fairview Heights, IL",115,19,13,5.0,11/29/2016,Cheesecake Factory corporate was quick to rectify the situation. Very pleased with the outcome. Will be returning.
Tam T.,"Kansas City, MO",0,13,,2.0,2/26/2016,"I was a frequent conesieur of The Cheese Cake Factory until I went there for Husband's 43rd birthday. Born and raised in segregated st louis I've been aware of the long  existed overt and covert racism.  I experienced it, been a victim of it, and actively speak against it.  On this day I was a victim of racism in this establishment.  I sat down before anyone was at the table before or behind me. I waited to be served. Nothing. Ten minutes later a white family came and sat in front of me and was served immediately. I waited. NOTHING.  Five minutes later another white family was seated behind me and served immediately. I was never approached. About 20 minutes later I approach the hostess request to see the supervisor and provided him the details. Apologetic he finds a different area and serves us immediately. He also commits to a dressing the server in our initial seating area. The Cheese Cake Factory redeemed itself. They resolved the issue immediately and committed to handling the situation.  However,  I never returned. My daughter reminded me that excellent treatment is an indication of great values  and principles. As such we we can't support establishments like The Cheese Cake Factory."
Kim D.,"Clarksville, TN",27,17,4,2.0,5/17/2016,I would say the food is really really good. Tho the service is slow and we needed to wait 1:30 just to get a table. So ask for a reservation of you are planning to eat here. If not you can always entertain your self in the mall just right by the door. Other than that the food is freaking great
Patt C.,"Chesterfield, MO",244,944,,1.0,11/18/2014,"After a movie October 12, my girlfriend and I decided this was a good place for dinner. There were so many people sitting and standing outside -- and inside --  I thought we would have a 30-minute wait. But we were seated immediately. I think it helped that we were a party of 2. My dining partner got the fried zucchini, which is an appetizer. I got two separate offerings: meatballs, and macaroni and cheese. I got three meatballs. I ate one. They were huge. The macaroni and cheese was sizzling and very tasty. UNTIL I took it all home. Upon reheating, the meatballs were awful, and I could not even smell them without retching. The macaroni and cheese was sooooo oily, I was unclear if there was ever cheese in the mix. I know there are some things you are supposed to eat right away when they're served. But I thought meatballs, and macaroni and cheese would stand the take-home situation. These did not. Which made me think they were crappy in the first place."
Kate B.,"St Charles, MO",498,736,507,4.0,9/1/2013,"One of my favorite 'chain' restaurants. Service can be hit or miss in terms of friendliness but overall, it's a place I'd return to again. I like the fact that the menus are large enough that both Sean & I can find things we like on them. I noticed they have a new ""skinnylicious"" menu (retarded name, IMHO) and honestly nothing sounded too good from it. It didn't help that they had to put the word ""skinnylicious"" in front of every fucking thing. (I am gonna keel over if I have to type that word one more time, rofl.) But I opted for the regular menu and strategically planned to only eat 1/2 of whatever I ordered so that I wouldn't have a massive stomachache and need to consume extra prescription drugs to manage my problems which ensue later.  I have always loved their herb encrusted salmon but I wanted to try their steak diane. To my delight/surprise they had both of these items available as 1 entree so you can try both. The salmon comes in a (very) buttery herb sauce and the steak comes in a mushroom-y steak sauce with onions. A wall of mashed potatoes separates the surf n' turf. The salmon was 100% perfect, loved it. The steak (medium rare) wasn't bad either but it was definitely a tiny bit chewy...not exactly filet mignon but hey whatevs. I think the dish cost about $19, which ain't bad for steak and salmon. Sean had a burger (as usual) and enjoyed it until he realized the bun had been grilled with practically a stick of butter. Urp. The dessert menu is freakin' massive, but I am not really a huge fan of cheesecake unless it's the plain, original kind (uh oh my inner Sean comes out!) although white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is pretty amazing too. Protip, though, if all you like is their original cheesecake, you can get it at Red Robin for cheaper, I am pretty sure, b/c they started selling it there a few months ago. ;) Linda's fudge cake at the Cheesecake Factory is pretty flippin' fantastic, but I am scared to look up the calorie content. Since I had opted for a glass of wine that night, I decided to pass on the dessert calories. But still, can't help but to drool at the case on my way out. I wish they'd open one of these in St. Charles.... Addendum: There is something to be said for the 'restaurant engineering' developed by this place.... they've gotta be running on Lean manufacturing types of algorithms.... Edit: I KNEW IT!  Pretty dope. If only all places had like resources for data analysis."
Sarah S.,"Saint Louis, MO",225,826,714,3.0,12/22/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a solid ""A-OK"" place. The wait can be quite long, but they do offer call ahead seating, which is a plus.  Their menu is HUGE and has options for everyone. The portions are also huge. Get the smaller portions and they are huge as well. Just expect to get a lot of food.  My favorite things are their cheesecake, fries and lemonade. The lemonade is house made and soooo good! Their fried cheese wedges are pretty good. My sister loves the veggie burger, but it's huge too.  Next time I come I'll definitely try something new and hopefully will find something that is more than just ""ok."""
Megan S.,"Sacramento, CA",52,244,559,4.0,12/9/2015,"Ahhh, Cheesecake Factory. You old friend. I am always drawn in by your terribly amazing high calorie menu and decadent cheesecakes. I mainly come here for the cheesecake, but I definitely have some favorites on the menu! Fried Mac and cheese balls, and fried Mac and cheese burger. Wow. So delicious!! Cheesy, salty, gooey, fried deliciousness. I also appreciate that they have a skinny menu. I have had the turkey and avacado sandwich, and it is really good. Piled high with turkey and has some bacon on it. I don't like that they have a pile of greens as their side with pretty much nothing on it. I feel like that could improve. It's really hard to eat plain. My absolute favorite thing of all time is their peppermint bark cheesecake that comes only during Christmas!! I anticipate its arrival all year!! I am such a peppermint bark junkie and this takes care of me like no other!! Creamy white chocolate, bits of peppermint, chocolate crust and loads of whipped cream. It's intense and amazing. You can't go wrong. Christmas in the form of diabetes! I also love the chocolate chip cookie dough, another old favorite! They always have great deals around the holidays too. Buy a $25 gift card get a free slice of cheesecake! Win win."
Karen O.,"Belleville, IL",9,40,3,3.0,7/9/2016,This place is a dam ripoff. To pricy rude servers n managers I went in today terrible.  My order was all messed up. I did not want to pay they told me to pay. Are else. Usually when food is gross. They don't make you pay.  For a bad order. Bathrooms were gross too bloody tampons were all over. Piss. All over. Toilet paper. Wet floors people can fall down.  Your talk in law suit if someone files. You need to hire a bathroom worker your place is slipping.  Instead of raising prices. You need a clean n beautiful. Restrooms.
Rita H.,"Saint Louis, MO",5,2,7,5.0,3/1/2016,Try the hibachi steak it's best in Saint Louis，Good environment
Jess P.,"Saint Louis, MO",271,105,654,5.0,1/26/2015,"I am obsessed with this place,  I've never been disappointed.  The menu is huge, it has something for everyone.  The drinks are excellent.  I always try something new.  It's a bit pricey buy worth every penny.  Don't forget to try the cheesecake!"
Jennifer C.,"Saint Louis, MO",112,421,790,4.0,11/10/2014,"My staple restaurant.  When I can't make up my mind for what I want to eat, I always opt for Cheesecake Factory and I can't go wrong.  I frequent the bar area because there is typically no wait.  I can't list out all of my favs here, it would go on too long, but I ways get the Boston House Salad regardless of my meal.  The Cuban Rolls, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Crab Wontons and Chicken Di Pana have been my most recently rotated meals."
Jasmine P.,"Chicago, IL",205,111,183,3.0,11/3/2015,The service was fast! I ordered the bbq ranch chicken salad but was disappointed after I realized the chicken was grilled and had no bbq sauce. As always there was not a wait and the chicken samosas were cooked to perfection. I was so busy talking I didn't realize why my salad tasted different until I was back at the hotel. Oh and I had no salad dressing in my to go bag.
Michael G.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,26,,1.0,10/24/2016,"Terrible experience - we called ahead, arrived on time, short wait, were seated. Service took a while to show, we knew exactly what we wanted. 45 minutes later a manager arrived and told us they were getting it out shortly - 5 to 6 minutes. We were on a tight schedule due to other commitments later on in the evening. Some time later another manager showed up and told us they could not get our food to us due to problems with the dough - we had ordered pizza, Flatbread, a burger and fries. So we left, no other food was offered, no other remedies provided. Place has been in steady decline and not just this location - see my recent review for the Cheesecake Factory in The Woodlands, Texas."
Sasha S.,"Saint Louis, MO",218,172,4,2.0,5/17/2015,"Evelyn, You were my favorite but no more. I hadn't been to any TCF in awhile and we were only here because we had a gift card. Walking in, the decor was cracking me up. It seemed Egyptian inspired-maybe?? I couldn't put 2 and 2 together as to why. Anyway the ambiance was fine and it was dimly lit which I approve of but we chose to sit outside because it was a beautiful evening. We were here on a busy weekend evening so there was a bit of a wait but not too bad. We started with drinks and the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls - Rice paper wrapped around asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, rice noodles, green onion, cilantro, and shrimp. Served chilled with spicy chili and peanut dipping sauces. These were actually pretty good. Fresh, flavorful, and rolled nicely. For our entrees the hubs had the Grilled Turkey Burger - Made with fresh mushrooms, garlic and spices. Served with Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato and he had his with fries. He said his was fine but I didn't try it. I had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta- Rigatoni tossed with broccoli, oven-dried tomato, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts. Now there are few chains where I have a fave dish but TCF had always done me right with this dish. Until now. The pasta was beyond al dente. Like tough, almost still crunchy. The veggies were salty and nothing was war. The dish was lacking olives and pine nuts. Evelyn, I am so over you. The service was so slow and mia that I didn't bother saying anything. I think our server knew it was slow and I'm pretty sure there was a mix up or kitchen issue or something because she was already apologetic and offered us free desert on the manager (and we hadn't said a word about anything). We politely declined the free desert and waaaaiiiited for our someone to pick up then bring back our check. We mos def won't be back anytime soon but it's not like we would avoid it like the plague or anything. Maybe next gift of a gift card."
Laura V.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,3,1.0,8/7/2016,"If I could do zero stars I would. Horrible service, manager was no help when asked to speak to him about the service I reviewed and the food quality he just looked at me and said nothing. When asked if he would provide this service to his own family he said ""no I'm sorry"" and that's it. Waited for over an hour to have our food come out. Once it did it was cold and very unsatisfactory. When we asked our server how long until our food came out she said ""we are very busy you might now see it but we are"" never coming here again."
Katie G.,"Florissant, MO",0,4,,5.0,8/6/2016,"Went here for the first time the other day and it was fantastic! I always have the worst luck with going out to eat: rude staff, horrible food, wrong orders, and just sloppy service. But here, was just amazing (how said is that, its amazing to find people who do their job) Our waitress was so funny and sweet, she got everything correct, explained the menu to us, let me customize my order. This place has great/amazing/can't get it better food! There staff is so nice and helpful! I will be back!!"
Eva L.,"O'Fallon, MO",22,14,7,5.0,8/9/2015,"Hubby and I chose TCF for our 1st Anniversary dinner, and it didn't disappoint! Though we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated (not surprising-we went at 6pm), our waitress was polite and friendly, and the food was awesome. We both got the 10"" Cheese Pizza; their blend is soo good! (Mozzarella, White Cheddar, & Fontina) DH got french fries with his(yes, I snuck some off his plate!), also fabulous, though 5-6 minutes after the rest of our food. I chose the Garden Salad, which was basically huge. Probably not intended as a side... Our waitress was super attentive, filling our glasses several times each. (We're heavy water-drinkers usually, and had just come from the St. Louis Zoo, but she kept up with us!) Though DH did ask for a pop refill when she stopped to check on us, we didn't even have to flag her down for the water. :) While TCF isn't an inexpensive dinner, it's definitely one of our favorite places. I know we'll be returning."
Brian K.,"Saint Louis, MO",43,3,,2.0,7/24/2015,"We have always had hit or miss experiences at this CCF. I will first disclose that I did open this unit and worked there for 4 years. This gives me a little more understanding of the processes of addressing issues.  That being said.... My wife and I sat at a High Top at the bar. It was empty at the time so no need to wait for the hostess to sit us. 5 minutes after sitting down we got our drinks and placed our order. We both got the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. When I was an employee I got hooked, and hooked my wife as well. Normally I would recommend this dish. This time :20 passed and the food runner came out and said that she dropped one of them. She said that they were firing a new one on a fly and offered to bring out the one that was ready. My wife was totally ready so I said to bring it on out. I know that this dish fly time is 5 minutes, so I would not have to sit there too long with no food. I understand that things like this happens and if they fixed it in due time I would have been satisfied.  When the first dish was brought to us it looked odd. It was very wet and the bowl was wiped bad. My wife stirred it up and I said we will kick it back. The cooks put extra cream in the bowl so it could sit in the window while they did the re-cook. Yeah, that is not the way to do it. So, now we have 2 re-cooks. :25 passed and we only seen our server once and the food runner once. At the :25 mark we went to the host desk and asked for the MOD.  Patrick, the MOD, came up and spoke to us. He tried the excuse that they are busy and it could take time for a re-cook. I asked him how long and he said :15 or maybe longer. I asked him again, and it was the same. I then let him know that I worked the first 4 years and that I opened Birmingham, AL unit as a trainer. I let him know that the dish re-cook should have been  5 minutes and if the station was fully loaded no more than :10. He then agreed. He did offer to bring the dishes out to us, but we only had 30 minutes left on date night. He packed it up and comp'd the meal.  The failure is that the outside expo didn't push for the re-cook, the MOD was not aware and the cooks pushed the re-cooks to the end of the ticket line. None of that should have been done."
Melissa M.,"Trumann, AR",295,260,1801,5.0,6/21/2014,I tried the Cheescake Factory for the first time on Friday and I LOVED IT! Everything was delcious. I wish there  was one closer to me.
Elizabeth N.,"Granite City, IL",27,2,5,5.0,7/30/2016,well worth the hour and half wait.  I had bang bang chicken and shrimp and it was amazing!  them had oreo cheesecake...another winner!  reasonably priced also
