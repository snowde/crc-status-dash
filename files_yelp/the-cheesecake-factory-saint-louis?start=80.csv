Pete W.,"Du Quoin, IL",0,4,,4.0,7/30/2016,"This is the third time at the Cheese Cake Factory, though very busy, they are very efficient and take time to make it feel cozy."
Scott H.,"Indianapolis, IN",65,389,2,3.0,4/4/2016,"Man, the bar was crowded for lunch on a Monday. Too crowded. Cheesecake Factory has good food (I went with four cheese pasta) and great service. I received my food quickly and a server brought complimentary bread while I waited. However, the food and drink prices are too expensive, especially for beer ($5 for a Bud Light bottle?!? Da heck?!?)"
Faith R.,"Imperial, MO",69,82,77,2.0,5/17/2016,"Six grown women shoved into a booth. I had to eat my sandwich with a fork because I couldn't lift my arms. Order took forever to come out. One dish came with mushrooms that had been requested to be omitted. After taking the dish back, the waitress asked if she had allergies to mushrooms or if they could just pick the mushrooms off. She asked for a new piece because she does not like the taste of mushrooms. The chicken came back too quick to have been remade and was swimming in gravy AND she found a mushroom. Even after five of us were served and one re-served, we still had one person who never got her SALAD! When the waitress was asked about it she instantly became very rude and said ""I'm working on it!""  It was a terrible experience. The two stars are for the chicken salad. It was creamy and very good. However, I will not return to this Cheesecake Factory."
Alison L.,"Houston, TX",113,159,49,2.0,7/26/2015,"With SO many food offerings in STL, I don't know for the life of me why people flock here in the masses. There is always a wait. Once you're seated, you end up almost on top of another table, where they can hear your conversation. There's nothing ""intimate"" about the experience (minus the very dim lights). The food is just average and my cheesecake has been served to me frozen before. Certainly an experience where you ask yourself ""is it worth this?"""
Allisa L.,"Roseville, CA",14,60,65,5.0,9/26/2015,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over 7 years. But we decided to go today oath family and friends. Although the wait was an hour for 7 people, everything else was wonderful! I got the Mai Tai drink to start, very very tasty!!! Tropical. Then I got the Chicken Madeira...which was overly delightful! I loved the sauce and their mashed potato are always yummy!! Server was very nice. We took the Kahlua chocolate cheesecake. It was good, but not GREAT. I think it's best to stick with the simple cheesecakes here. Over all, I'm very satisfied. :)"
Marci E.,"Madison, WI",319,172,110,5.0,9/13/2015,"I don't usually like chains, but I have figured out how to best enjoy CF. I like their light menu, especially the asparagus salad with the egg and the ahi tuna. Sometimes I'll get a salad to share. The staff works hard. I prefer coming at off times and sitting on the high stools. It's also a fun place to Come for birthdays (as long as friends are familiar with CF and don't feel Overwhelmed by the ridiculously big menu (don't know how their kitchen does it). What I also like about CF is that the staff is trained to make sure customers are happy and they will always fix orders when something isn't right."
Mary Kate A.,"Washington, DC",2707,1807,9419,4.0,3/24/2012,"Is there really any need for me to review Cheese Cake Factory? Probably not.... but will say a few select words: - I LOVE THEIR CHEESE CAKE! - I LOVE THE PATIO - The menu is over-hyped and overpriced but still you can manage to find virtually anything for even the most pickest eater.  - Server is usually pretty good even on packed nights. The only complaint I really have is that typically they have huge restaurants that feel they need to hold hoards of people which sometimes make the visit feel impersonal. Either way, that's not a deal break and I am a repeat offender of consuming their 'oh my god' cheesecake.... and other delicious desserts too."
Ryan H.,"Arlington, VA",238,65,49,2.0,1/25/2014,"My friends and I decided to dine here for a late night meal since the place is generally way too crowded at any other hour and always has an unnecessarily long wait. We got there around 9 and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated.  We were seated and then waited over 10 minutes for the waiter to arrive and then another 15 minutes for her to come back and take the order. We were there for almost 30 minutes at the table and then finally got some bread.  The food was way too salty in the avocado spring rolls and the kale salad was poorly seasoned and not dressed well. My other friend ordered the jambalaya pasta, which was salty and the pasta was way over cooked  (al dente was a thing of the past). I ordered a combo plate with chicken madeira and shrimp scampi. Shrimp were in a cream and salt sauce and the shrimp were breaded and fried. Salt on salt on salt. The chicken was decent, nothing spectacular.  I paid $4.50 for a strawberry lemonade, selling it at that price is probably criminal. And if you're wondering, no we did not order the cheesecake because by that point, I would have needed medical attention for the impending cardiac arrest from the overload of salt and sugar.  Overall, not the place for good eats. Menu is overwhelming and ambiance is really loud."
G X.,"St. Louis, MO",0,4,,1.0,6/23/2017,"Horrible service!  A group of us friends dined here together for a girls night out. There was one waitress attending to the whole row of tables on the side where we sat. It took a very long time over an hour for them to bring out our order. The waitress did not even bring us bread until along with the appetizers and the main course all at once! It was simply all piled on the table and we were left unattended until we were ready to check out. Finally, the manager was unable to follow our directions to split the check 9 ways for about a half hour and it still ended up being incorrect!  The manager commented that it was ""crazy to split the check"". If a restaurant manager does not know how to split cost 9 ways with a simple math, then he is quite simply incompetent. All in all I would never go back to this place for a dinner again. Save yourself some good time and experience by visiting some place else."
Rachel A.,"Edwardsville, IL",78,29,2,4.0,12/30/2015,"Chains are hard to rate, but I can say I really like the Cheesecake Factory. The food is always so good, and if you go to the Bar area from 4 - 6pm during the week, they have an Awesome Happy Hour! The pot stickers and Won Tons are a great starter! Also, the people are so nice there.  I have never had a complaint about the wait staff!"
Mary A.,"Springfield, IL",0,5,,4.0,5/29/2016,"The barbecue salad was amazing.  We got 2 pasta dishes.  The four cheese pasta with chicken was fine.  The angle hair pasta with shrimp was ok.  The fish and chips were fine.  We got one piece of cheesecake for four of us to share, which worked well because the portion was huge.  All of the portions were at least 3 times too big."
John D.,"Saint Louis, MO",41,5,,2.0,5/14/2016,"My family and I ate here on Friday and it was not a pleasant experience for me. I ordered the fish and chips and it was terrible. The batter was soggy and falling off the fish and the fish was bland and slimy. It was unpalatable. I let our server know and discussed the issue with the manager. He didn't seem satisfied with my complaint but he took the meal back to the kitchen and I ordered something else. I ended up choosing the thai lettuce wraps, but it took so long for the food to get to me that I just got it to-go. The service was lackluster and slow even after the problem with the food and to top it off we had several items from other family members on our check and our thai lettuce wraps ended up on someone else's check. I think I'll push to the family to go somewhere else next time we have a get together and they want to go out to eat."
Donna M.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,175,28,4.0,3/31/2015,"The fam and I ate here for dinner while I was in town on a recent visit. The GF options are extensive compared to other big chains, which is why I'm a big fan. I got the GF pasta carbonara, and it was fantastic as usual. We had a couple glasses of wine that our server recommended before and during our meal which was very enjoyable. Server (name escapes me) was really good, he made sure to check on us at the right times, didn't hover and didn't interrupt us too much throughout our evening as we were busy catching up. Fun evening!"
Mike C.,"Middletown, CT",9,187,4,2.0,5/12/2015,"The foods here are average at best.  It's always crowded here.  Average waiting time is an hour.  The decor is very nice.  Even when the foods sucks, you'd still it's think it's good.  Thinking that your taste bud is off?  Wrong!  Want your water refill is like hailing for a cab.  Maybe it's so busy here that's why the waiters has not time for you? So maybe I should be more understanding? Wrong again!  You are eating diner foods on a fancy plate with double the price.  My question is how come their cheese cakes tasted ordinary?  All this for that?"
Bill D.,"Saint Louis, MO",185,201,251,4.0,8/2/2013,"We decided to sit in the bar area for lunch. We arrived just after 11.  I loved the large glasses they use. Much less chance of running out before your meal is up.  First up was the bread to the table.  Two variety.  It come out nice and warm.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich. Scrambled eggs, bacon, turkey, tomatoes on Texas toast. It also came with potatoes on the side. It was delicious, however I couldn't eat it all. It was just to much.  Very happy with the lunch and next time I'm going to have some cheesecake for an appetizer."
Sadie L.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",509,223,131,3.0,1/12/2015,"For dinner, I ordered asparagus as one of my sides. It tasted fine - just okay, not great - but was literally $1+ for each stalk of asparagus. I get that it's a fine dining establishment, but damn! Cheesecake was great, as always. Even though the slices are $7-$8 each, it's a nice treat once in a while. The menu is insanely big, so everyone - even vegetarians - can find something they like. The service is hit or miss. They have never been overly friendly, but I haven't had awful service, either. One thing that bugged me about this last visit was that they serve espresso, but literally 5 staff members looked at me like I was speaking another language when I asked if they could make me an iced mocha. It's an iced mocha, it's not that hard. So, I proceeded to try and tell the girl how to pull a shot - she did it wrong, but whatever - and then had to walk her through the process of ... okay put ice in the cup... now milk.. no, more milk than that... yes.. okay now stir the chocolate and the espresso together... yeah... now pour it over the milk... therrrre ya go. Thank you.  The iced mocha ended up being alright. Not great but it's better than Starbucks or McDonalds.  P.S. Seriously, train your people on espresso. If I'm paying $6 for a drink, it needs to be good."
Willie C.,"Saint Louis, MO",9,6,2,4.0,11/10/2015,This will always be one of my favorite places to do lunch. Had the fish and chip enjoyed it very much. And had the turtle cheesecake for dessert as always.
Financy D.,"Columbia, MO",0,3,29,5.0,2/14/2016,Always great food at Cheesecake Factory St. Louis. The wait is worth waiting for. The molasses wheat bread is very good! See photos for more review
Alan D.,"Saint Louis, MO",23,114,58,4.0,12/4/2014,"Took the staff out for A holiday luncheon today. We had nine people at our table and had one server. He did a fantastic job of getting our drinks appetizers and taking our order in a very timely manner. All the food that came out looked fantastic. Food portions are enormous! I ordered chicken and biscuits, and was not disappointed. A huge helping of garlic mashed potatoes with multiple sautéed chicken breasts served and an assortment of fresh garden root vegetables with mushrooms; all served over a gigantic, fresh, homemade biscuit. The flavors were fantastic-I highly recommend. For having such a large group service went very well; refills were plentiful and the atmosphere was very inviting. They were accommodating to our group and we really enjoyed our lunch. I would recommend this for a family or for a large company luncheon."
Pam B.,"Alton, IL",5,40,80,5.0,4/13/2015,If you cant find anything to eat here your just plain not hungry!   They have a huge menu which takes awhile to look over and make a decision.  They also have a separate menu with all lower calorie selections which is also quite large.  The restaurant is decorated beautifully both inside and out with a large seating area outside.   The service was very good and the servers were very knowledgeable about their entrees.  The cheesecake was fantastic!  Prices are a little on the high side but its well worth it for an occasional night out.  I will definitely go back!!
