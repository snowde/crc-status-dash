Mike M.,"FOOTHILL RNCH, CA",77,130,749,4.0,1/9/2018,The wait was 45 minutes to get a table but Holly and Jessie were set on dinner at The Cheesecake factory so we waited. 30 minutes later we were seated.  I split the Madeira chicken and shrimp scampi combo with my daughter Becca and it was fantastic.  The bread was also delicious.  Our server was prompt and attentive.  I will be back.
Christine S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,7,1.0,1/7/2018,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. I have gone to several CFs in other states, but this one gave the well known popular restaurant a bad name.  I had a fairly large party and we were celebrating my brother in laws graduation. We understood reservations were not taken at a certain time and by the time we got there it was 8 pm. There was a high volume of guest and parties already waiting to be seated so our wait time was 3 hours. We decided to wait. After about an hour and a half we came back a checked with the host on the wait time and she stated it went down 30-20 mins instead. We were so relieved considering many of us were already so hungry.  Across the waiting area there is a dining room. As we waited the remaining time there was a large table that had not been cleaned for at least 30 mins. Once they cleaned it they sat the other large party ahead of us. Half our group are from Vegas and we were surprised how long they waited to clean the table considering that large party probably waited longer than us. At the CF in Vegas they would clean the tables right away. CF staff are quite known to be diligent.   Before we were seated my sister asked the host if our party was gonna be able to sit together or visible to each other and she said yes. Once we were seated we were taken to 3 booths. Two were right next to each other and the other table was four tables away from ours. You can imagine our confusion. I can understand if the booths were right next to each other but to have a third of our party sat on the other side of the section did not make any sense at all. My sister asked the host if there was any way for all of us to sit together and the host said, "" I don't know right now this is the best option "" and then walked away to attend to other guest. My sister asked another question and the other host kept saying, "" I don't know, I don't know..."" The responses were not helping at all.  We sat down and ordered our drinks. My sister who was very uphad to go up to the podium to speak to the host again about the table arrangements. Eventually the table that was very far from the others was moved to a much closer table. This also meant the servers had to switch. There were great confusion with the seating and our server already seemed flustered and irritable. My sister asked for a plate from the server and he yelled at her and asked if she needed anything else. They took one of the dishes from one of the guest in our party (who did not move at all) to a different table. This person had to watch us eat and when his food came we were already done. We tried to make the most of the dinner.  Although the dinner was not what we had hoped would be I appreciate the staff for trying."
Paul S.,"Reno, NV",1125,965,5321,4.0,12/26/2017,"December 24 2017 Sunday - 3:45 PM for Linner (Late Lunch and Early Dinner together) 3 Adults and a teenager Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Service - 5 stars Background - The plan was to shop for board games at the shopping center and find dinner.  Well the shopping center was closed so we went to dinner early. Atmosphere - A very grand looking Cheese Cake Factory Food   Drink - I had the Uinta Cutthroat Pale Ale.   Appetizer - Avocado egg rolls, they were tasty.   Linner - Stuffed chicken tortilla, my basically said it was enchilada without the sauce.  The meal also came with two corn cakes and black beans.  The black beans were a miss for me.  Loved the corn cakes but they were small, could have had four of them. Service - On point.  My garage parking ticket was validated at the hostess station as I left.  The garage gate was open so I did not need worry about it. Future - Sure."
Drew B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1251,466,3361,5.0,10/15/2017,"I hate to give way any of my trade secrets, but I will because I love The Cheesecake Factory significantly more than the masses, and I think Yelper criticism stems mostly from the long waits.  Here it goes: If you want to go to The Factory, and don't want the lines you'll often find, come for Sunday Brunch. We arrived today around 10:30 a.m., were greeted by a near-empty parking lot and a zero minute wait. That's right, all the yummy CF offerings, none of the crowds or noise.   To me, The Cheesecake Factory is the only national chain that is a Jack of All Trades, Master of ... All Trades.  They make great Saturday and Sunday Brunch-specific meals. I love the Green Chilaquiles with carnitas, slow-cooked pork (you can also choose chicken), roasted Poblanos, cilantro, tomatillo chile sauce, sour cream, cheese, onions, and corn tortillas. Their Monte Cristo is amazing .. the Monte Cristo is my favorite sandwich and only a few places in town make it right. The Factory's is my favorite. And the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict ... a Factory original mashup of poached and Hollandaise-covered poached eggs with deep-fried chicken strops on top of a Belgian Waffle. And their maple-butter syrup ... man, I could drink this glorious stuff.   On our most recent brunch, we cheated a bit and ate off of their lunch menu. We started with the Egg Roll Sampler: Crispy Cuban (AMAZING, my favorite!), Firecracker Salmon, Tex-Mex, and Avocado. They make epically good egg rolls.   For the main course, I got the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp. It's a little sweet, a little savory, and a lot of yummy. My wife got the Chicken Parmesan ""Pizza Style"": Breaded chicken covered with marinara and cheese; it has a big serving of angel-hair pasta with creamy Alfredo sauce.  Both are awesome, but my wife's Parm has the advantage of being real filling ... the lucky girl gets another meal out of it.   Oh, yeah, they make cheesecake! Faves are a matter of personal taste, but I've never had one that is meh or bad. I love them all, but the ones that have a special place in my heart are Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Reece's Peanut Butter Chocolate, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake, Tiramisu, and Peppermint Bark.  Again, go for Sunday Brunch ... a relaxing way to enjoy The Factory."
Mike C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",121,76,61,2.0,11/27/2017,"Disclaimer: I'm a happy person who is infinitely in love with food. That said, I'm falling out of love with The Cheesecake Factory. The CF has reached it's peak during my prom years and this will be forever where high schoolers take their dates to woo them into a false sense of grandeur. Let's highlight some good things. Service is always fast, friendly, and waiters/waitresses always have genuine smiles on their faces. The Cheesecake, I mean come on, it's the Cheesecake Factory and I will give it to them, still to this day the Dulce De Leche, Snickers, Oreo, essentially all their creations are delicious. And that's about it. Come on guys, I've seen some college publications shorter than the menu at CF. I somehow always manage to spend 30 minutes reading the biggest menu on the planet. Why? Why the need for so many options? Think of it this way. You're trying to impress a date. Would you wear a dashing tuxedo? or would you wear a tuxedo, a suit, your funeral suit, your wedding suit, your prom suit ALL at once. Why? What are you trying to hide? It's simple, their absolutely mediocre less than impressive food. It's really not that good. Just a lot of it on a plate in a dimly lit restaurant so you can't really see how bad it is.  However, what were we expecting? It's a chain, their focus is essentially the same as McDonald's, VOLUME. Their intent isn't making the best mac and cheese burger, or pineapple chicken and rice, or chicken curry, or the best spaghetti there is. They stuff you with volume and trick you into thinking it's the best thing you've ever had. Don't be fooled. Skip the tom foolery and go straight to dessert. No pretense, you can't hide a bad cheesecake (or maybe you can)."
Sandra S.,"Sandy, UT",99,47,7,2.0,12/26/2017,"Pretty disappointed in today's visit. Me and my boyfriend came here as a late birthday dinner. I ordered the chicken Madeira and the other dish ordered was the pasta with shrimp and sausage. The chicken Madeira, when I first tasted it, the temperature of the food felt like it was sitting out for 10 minutes or so. It was not even warm, and my chicken barely had the wine sauce. With the pasta, it was was undercooked and it came out with chicken instead of the shrimp so we had it sent back. I'm sure they took someone else ordered cause they said they made him a ""new"" plate but it wasn't even five minutes. I also felt bad because a couple next to us were here first before us and we got our food before then."
Dustin N.,"Logan, UT",47,25,5,4.0,11/16/2017,"So tonight stopped in to have dinner and of course during a very busy, upcoming holiday weekend only had to wait about 20 minutes. We were seated and introduced to Carson our waiter and got drink order started. After looking for a few minutes we ordered our dinner. It was perfect timing when our dinner was delivered and I ordered the Chicken Parmesan ""pizza style"". My dinner was undoubtedly the best chicken parm I have eaten anywhere. The Mac and cheese side dish was perfectly cheesy tasting as always. Carson was a little busy with bigger tables but he did he best he could that evening and was very nice. We then ordered our cheesecake to go and paid the bill and headed out for the evening. We got back to our hotel and munched down on the dessert and it was a perfect non-alcoholic nightcap."
Aiyana P.,"Clinton, UT",12,84,28,4.0,8/1/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because when I was here a couple days ago our waitress was not very good. Every other time it's 5! Sometimes the wait is longer than other days but it's usually not very long. There is a car valet service right outside so we used that for the first time and it was very inexpensive. 5$ and we tipped a little on top of that. I usually get the four cheese pasta here & I'd recommend that to anyone who likes pasta and doesn't know what to get! I also get the caramel macchiato which sounds like an odd mix with pasta, but for me it works. Delicious food, moderately priced. Love this location!"
Uyen L.,"San Jose, CA",85,37,24,2.0,6/22/2017,"I typically give Cheesecake 3 stars for the decent, high calorie food. However, this location deserves only 2 stars. I ordered a Mexican Tortilla salad from the Skinny menu. While the portion of the salad itself is huge like all Cheesecake portions, the amount of chicken was completely unproportional. There were 6-7 thinly slices of chicken breast. I was still hungry afterwards! The restroom is also tiny compared to the size of the restaurant. There was a long line for the women's room."
Jessica W.,"Henderson, NV",2,157,83,5.0,7/15/2017,"Don't understand the low reviews. It's a chain and it's consistent. Can't ask for more.  Food: chicken, mango and avocado salad, kids pepperoni pizza and crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp. Original cheesecake. All tasty and delicious.  Service: busy as expected on a Saturday night, so the wait was 1 hour. No surprise there. Our waitress was great, very attentive and met expectations.  Location: at one end of the City Creek Mall near the food court bordering 100 S."
Max A.,"St. George, UT",320,1,,1.0,9/8/2017,"I just wanted to let everyone know about the terrible experience I had at the City Creek Cheese Cake Factory. Our waiter was terrible. Fred (waiter) seemed disinterested, snappy, and irritable. He would leave for 30 minutes at a time, didnt want to answer any questions about the menu, and ruined me and my families night. The restaurant was also out of several things.  At the end of the night we left, thank god, but unfortunately i left my card there. So I come back and ask the hostess if she has seen my card to which she replies ""the managers need to search their office"". I waited for over 5 minutes with nothing. I presume that the office was so dirty and disorganized that they needed 10 minutes to even search for a card. I then see my waiter and ask him if hes seen my card. He replies with ""no"" and runs off without any further explanation. They tell me to call tomorrow because there is nothing they can do, even though I had told them I thought it was in one of the black check books.  Overall terrible experience, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know."
Chris B.,"Newport Beach, CA",243,8,13,2.0,9/21/2017,Party of one: I was sat at a table for two in a section of about 5 other tables. Once seated the waitress dropped off the check to the table beside me. She looked at me and walked off I figured she would return after closing their tab and greet me. When she came back to the table she dropped off their check and went to another table in her section checked on them and walked back out of site. Finally she returned to the section checked on one other table and then decided to make formal contact with me asking for my drink selection. It took a long 10 minutes to ever be waited on or atleast greeted by the wait staff then another 5 to get my drink. This being said it isn't a busy evening just a moderate Thursday crowd. Service thus far is very unimpressive. After the relief server came over to let me know she was now taking care of me the mood changed and she was very polite and helpful. Her service was a nice change to how the dinner started
Jenny B.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,2,1.0,1/2/2018,"My husband and I both got food poisoning from the food we ordered on New Year's Eve. The server did not follow the health code and our food was cold. Spoke with the supervisor, he is absolutely rude. Go to other Cheesecake Factory and stay away from this location. Horrible service and horrible food."
Vida A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",228,783,39,2.0,11/13/2017,"More like 2 1/2/stars.  Idk why but this location is not as crowded.  Maybe its the massive food court down the way but its easy to get a table.  I like this location better then Murray because how tall the ceilings are and it feels like Vegas.  Service is hit and miss.  Today Jessica was great and handled our salty soup problems.  For lunch I always order the Renne's Special.  It comes with half a sandwich, salad, and soup.  Today the soup was french onion.  It came out luke warm and like a bucket of salt had been dumped in to it.  Jessica told us it was her least favorite soup because of that reason.  Wanting soup real bad i was disappointed in lunch and for $35 without tip, I too should have gone to the food court.  I ordered a pizza for my son in which he didn't eat.  The pepperoni's are like linguisa and have a strong smell and taste, i could see why a 3 year old would have a problem eating it.  Jessica didn't ask how the pizza was as it hadn't been touched.  Im surprised a manager didn't come by and apologize.  I had 3 containers of food to go, obviously our food sucked.  Overall, this place isn't cheap, food portions are huge, but you never know service wise what your going to get.  If you feel like dropping some doe for average, this is the place!"
Veronica T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",184,113,546,5.0,3/15/2017,"Back at it again with 5 stars. I love this place. I go pretty often and it's just one of my favorite restaurants I can say. Yesterday I went with my brother and aunt. The service was quick, considering a Tuesday night at 6. It was awesome we were seated quickly and our waiter was so amazing. I can never complain about the service.  Now for food, I have to first mention... I LOVE THE BREAD here ! Like ugh, yesterday it came out so fresh and warm. I always want to eat like 5 loafs but the portions here at the Cheesecake Factory are huge so if I ever ate that much bread, I can forget about the entree lol. Now onto the real stuff.  My brother got the lemon chicken I believe. The portions came out nice with potatoes and a side of veggies. His chicken looked great. He told me that it's a great burst of flavor in every bite. So if you're a chicken lover. This would be a good choice, as long as you like lemon too.  My aunt got the pasta carbonara, but with shrimp instead of chicken. She really enjoyed it. Finished the whole thing faster than me and my brother eating. She said it was flavorful and the amount of food was more than enough.  If you love pasta, this is a good one to try.  I got the skinnylicious enchilada. Which I've had before, and I love. It's low in calories but tastes just as great. The side salad it comes with is just wonderful. I absolutely love the cheese and the amount of chicken they place in each one. I think it's a good healthy dinner if you're not looking for a basic salad. It's a must try.  We didn't try cheesecake but I'll have to next time cause it looks so great! I'll be back again !"
Jennifer J.,"Draper, UT",145,121,257,5.0,3/20/2017,"Sometimes getting a table at The Cheesecake Factory in a timely manner can feel as impossible as getting an audience with royalty. I didn't have high hopes that on the first night of FanX we'd be able to get a table in less than three hours, but they shocked me when they told us the wait would only be thirty minutes. I was even more pleasantly surprised when thirty minutes only ended up being about fifteen. I'm sure because of the event there was a lot of traffic throughout this establishment this evening, but have to compliment the entire staff for remaining professional and high on positive energy. Nothing but good vibes here this night, considering how many oddly dressed people (my party included!) might have passed through. As far as food goes, I've mentioned it for another location. I feel like there is something for everyone here; the menu is huge and can accommodate all tastes and even appetite sizes. And if you're looking for something to help you keep your waistline trim, they've got that, too.  My friend and I split a pasta dish that she selected; it sounded just okay, but was ridiculously tasty. The wine was really evident in the sauce, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The chicken was moist, too, and didn't taste veiny. Our server, Andrew, was extremely professional and rolled with the punches, even when presented with a very odd request. My friend JJ and I don't get to see each other all that often, and we both have seriously quirky personalities. We decided we wanted to recreate the scene from ""Lady and the Tramp"" after we were joking about our shared pasta dish and if we only had a meatball and one strand of spaghetti. Andrew graciously accommodated our request, bringing out one meatball and one strand of spaghetti so we could act the scene for a few laughs with our friends. I loved that he said in his ten years of being in the service industry that this was the first time he'd ever had anyone do this particular iconic movie scene. This is the type of service industry professional I've always attempted to be, and this is the type of server that I love having when I go up. Keep it up, Andrew!"
Tiffany F.,"Mesa, AZ",161,157,195,5.0,7/2/2017,Came here with my niece and nephew for dessert. The staff was very nice and presentable. I went during lunchtime so there were a lot of big groups because of the many businesses located nearby. My nephew and I went with the regular cheesecake with strawberries on top. So delicious and of course I ate too much. My niece had a chocolate flavor cheesecake. Our server was awesome. He was never M.I.A.  The managers were also walking around making sure everyone was doing their job. Tables were cleaned fast once the guests left. Overall great experience.
Didi R.,"Ogden, UT",50,97,191,2.0,3/27/2017,I was so disappointed with this place that I will make this short and sweet. Pros: Convenient location. Parking validation. Cons: Overpriced. Average food. Slow service.  Took 40 minutes to bring our food (which were lighter fare pasta dishes) and our waiter disappeared. Did he clock out? Did he take a smoke break? I dont know but we had to flag down a different waiter to find out if our food was ready.  Had to rush to eat our food in 10 min to make it to our show. Terrible experience.
Jason Y.,"Syracuse, UT",203,20,131,2.0,12/19/2016,"Great food, great service from the wait staff - Manager was passive aggressive. My wife and I stopped by the Cheesecake Factory on 16DEC2016 at about 2pm for lunch at the City Creek Mall in SLC, Utah. She had the chicken and couscous and i had the Kobe burger (which was outstanding). Our server was knowledgeable and promptly answered our questions about the dishes we placed under consideration before we ordered, and when we did order - they were out in a very reasonable amount of time. I never had to ask for a drink refill: Be proactive on this servers, and you will be well compensated for your efforts. During our meal, the manager came out to our table  and asked me if my 360 camera (that was mounted in a tripod and sitting on the table so I wouldn't kick or sit in it) was recording video. I told her it wasn't and she said that she didn't care...but corporate would. I found this odd that Cheesecake Factory corporate doesn't allow recording video inside the restaurant. One would think that recording memories and events would be encouraged. I assured her that I was not recording video and showed her that the camera was off by turning it on, showing her the blue LED's and then turning it back off. I told her that I could place the camera on the floor under the table or on the chair next to me if it was a concern. She said it wasn't her...it was 'corporate' that had the problem, and left. After this interruption by the manager, we went back to conversation and enjoying our meal.  A few minutes later, 2 of the waitstaff started taping pieces of paper on the glass separator (level with the camera sensor and lens) apparently to attempt to 'block the recording' that the manager had insisted I was doing. My wife got pissed off and grabbed the camera and shoved it under the table. The wait staff (a very nice young woman and young man) said they were tasked by the manager to, 'block the recording of how we cook our food'. That is paraphrasing, but she seemed embarrassed that she was tasked to carry out this objective.  To be honest - I was embarrassed for her. When I asked her (the wait staff) why the manager didn't object that the camera was on the table after I asked her if she would feel more comfortable if I placed the camera under the table, she said, ""Oh my God, the manager said you were trying to video record how we prepare our dishes, I'm so sorry!"" I had the Kobe Burger. It isn't rocket science how to cook a hamburger. You cook it, flip it, cook it then eat it. I'm not sure why Kobe burger flipping is a secret at Cheesecake Factory...but it was a pretty damn good hamburger. While we won't be coming back to Cheesecake Factory...it isn't because the food is bad, or the wait staff is incompetent.  It is because Cheesecake Factory 'corporate' hired a passive aggressive 'manager' that believes people are trying to record how the food is made, and is not genuine when interacting with customers. **UPDATED Monday Dec 19 (a few days after my last visit to Cheese Cake Factory)** I added +1 because as you can see below, CCF responded to my review. It is my opinion that CS on social media is an important part of the Customer Experience. This shows me that CCF's digital strategy team is willing to pick up the ball after it was dropped by the City Creek restaurant manager. I replicated my initial review on G+ (where they indicate they had responded) but I haven't read it yet.  Validation begets validation. +1 to CCF digital strategy for acknowledging and addressing my concern in a timely manner. I'll admit I was not expecting a response."
Ricky M.,"Spanish Fork, UT",55,6,4,1.0,12/23/2017,"Food was good, can out cold.  Waiter seemed very stressed and was not conversational.  Getting drinks refilled was a hassle.  Waiter said Brad was out, but tables next to us with different waiter had several servings of bread.  Bad service."
Tony R.,"North Salt Lake, UT",3,30,4,5.0,11/3/2017,Had a very enjoyable dinner at the cheesecake factory in the city creek this evening. Cody S did an outstanding job regarding service even in an extremely busy weekend environment.
Drew R.,"South Salt Lake, UT",64,378,897,2.0,7/31/2016,"Oh Cheesecake Factory...how wonderful your desserts are but your food is always surprising me every time. If you want a quick delicious dessert fix, this is the place to be. If you want to get it quickly...depending on the time and day you can be waiting for 45 mins for a seat or immediately seating...I don't think there was ever an in between for me. If you want just cheese cake I would recommend take out. The food court (or during nice days they set up chairs and tables outside) is near by so plenty of seating there and there isn't much of a wait for food court seating/out door seating. My coworkers and I came here on a Friday afternoon and there wasn't many people, so we got seated immediately. I decided to go for something new and ordered the spicy cashew chicken. Boy was I wrong to do that. It was one of the saltiest dishes I have ever tasted. After two bites I was just over it and I couldn't eat any of the rice. The brown rice I got soaked up every bit of sauce. I felt like I was putting spoonful of salt in my mouth. I picked some of the proteins off that wasn't covered in the sauce. Good thing they kept refilling my cup of water cause I was really thirsty with the saltiness of the food.  Another great thing was the bread. Idk if I was just hungry cause all I could eat was two bites, but the chocolate looking bread was delicious. The other bread was just meh. The saltiness of the food and all the water I drank I didn't feel like ordering dessert. I would totally recommend the desserts here, but do be careful on what you order cause of them are really rich and sweet. Food wise...it's Russian roulette. I had some that are good but a lot of them which horrifying. The staff here was friendly though..."
Jen P.,"Anchorage, AK",68,114,20,5.0,7/18/2017,"It was a 30 minute wait on a Monday night. We waited about 20 minutes. Not bad. Our server was training someone, so it took awhile to get our order in. We ordered drinks/food at the same time since we had so much time to look over the menu. The food arrived very fast. In fact, our appetizers and food arrived together which didn't bother us. All of our food was delicious. My husband said it was the best steak he has eaten in awhile. We had mango/keylime pie cheesecake. It was delicious. We are happy with the service and the food quality."
Lauren L.,"San Diego, CA",356,176,81,3.0,5/23/2017,"The food at this specific location and, the wait staff were mediocre to say the least... I thought well, maybe someone has called out or, maybe they aren't scheduled to the volume of customers they anticipated. I thought this until I noticed our server helping give hugs and creating conversation with several other staff members when, we were still waiting on items we kindly requested multiple times now. Disappointed I wasted a meal at this place. The food was also very ""off"" the normal flavors of the same items I have ordered at other Cheesecake Factory locations. All around just an unsatisfying experience. Hoping this turns around for other patrons."
Bob S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,5,,4.0,10/23/2017,"In town for business and found a yearn'n for dinner and cheesecake. I've been to this location before and was not disappointed. At 5:30pm I was seated within 5 minutes, and had bread and drink in hand in 10min. I went with the chicken stuffed tortillas for a first-time try. A very good dish indeed. Took my favorite slice of healthy super food Godiva Chocolate cheesecake to go as the entree' did me in and there was no room. Great hostess and server!"
Anthony B.,"Provo, UT",22,1,,2.0,12/10/2017,"First if all the cheesecakes are great, hence the name of the restaurant. I waited 2 hours to be seated which is reasonable because it was super busy. Once seated, I ordered a filet mignon. Keep in mind this particular filet is the most tender and most expensive as well. Our waiter was great, especially for the restaurant being so busy,  Basically the only reason I don't give this place one star. After waiting another 40 minutes just to get my food, my filet arrived. First of all, it was super burnt, cut in half, and not even juicy or tender at all!!! 30 dollars for what literally looked like a meteor that hit my plate.  Not even exaggerating.  First sign that the chef sucked was the filet being cut in half. Second sign was the fact that it was already easy to cook since it was cut in half but even then, chef manages to burn the filet still!  One half of the  filet was literally charcoal black. Even a piece I kept staring at because it was just so black and hard that even a starving child in Africa wouldn't even eat it, not even look at it! The other half of the filet was barely even edible but still dry and had a taste that was 1 dollar worth. Not to be mean but I would bet all my money on McDonald's, because hell I'm sure they can make a better filet and price it at 1 dollar. So not worth a 30 dollar price tag. I should have been refunded for this pathetic plate"
Travis J.,"Layton, UT",0,6,1,5.0,10/22/2017,"We always always enjoy this restaurant! Especially if you have a group with varied taste, there is something for everyone."
Charles S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",928,1298,1079,2.0,8/19/2016,"At least they're honest... this is definitely food that comes from a factory. There is nothing ""farm-to-table"" fresh about this place. Everything is mass-produced for the lowest common denominator.  I always get a queasy sick feeling after eating at CF. I guess I'm not used to eating 3,000 calories and 80g of fat in one sitting. They do have a few slightly more healthful offerings, but their bread and butter is super fattening, cholesterol and sodium filled, gut bombs. The service is usually fine.  The ambiance is fairly upscale, especially for a casual dining place. Prices are high, but portion sizes are comically huge, so I guess it's a decent value. There are at least 20 restaurants that are vastly superior to CF, in every way, within walking distance of this joint. It's beyond me why anyone would ever eat here. As for me... I won't... not again."
Robbin M.,"Santa Maria, CA",85,305,332,4.0,5/8/2017,"Well let me just start by saying this is a chain. With that comes both good and bad perspectives. Food is usually tasty and consistent here. Catch them at an off time but definitely not during rush hour. No reservations taken. Staff is friendly and pretty on top of things. Cheesecake as always......amazing. Definitely a huge variety of foods for every palate and diet. Valet parking a plus. Again though, it's a chain, so you get what you get lol."
Gina Brister S.,"San Diego, CA",95,14,5,3.0,9/24/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but I was a bit disappointed with this one. To be fair, we came during Comicon, & the festivities really put a damper on good service in a reasonable amount of time anywhere in downtown SLC. With that being said, the employees here seemed exhausted by anyone that they came in contact with. We opted to grab cheesecake  & some hot chocolate & return to our hotel given the long wait. Considering we had a flight the next morning, it ended up working out for us. Had we wanted to spend some time in downtown SLC, the lack of customer service might have been further disappointing."
Bobby S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",63,39,5,2.0,8/8/2017,"My family and I checked in to Cheesecake Factory at about 6:25pm. We were there to celebrate family members who were going away for 1.5-2 years, doing service work. The representative told us it would take an hour to get a table (on a Tuesday night), and it was fine. Our ringer notified us at about 7:45pm that our table was ready.  We initially asked for a table for 15, but ended up asking for 18. When we got to our table, it was pretty tight, so my brother cleaned a table and a few chairs and added it to ours (so we could fit). We ended up with 20 people. After this happened, one of the waiters came up to our table and told us that we weren't supposed to do that. Then, he told us how wrong we were to do that. He, then, went to tell a manager named Josh who came out and yelled at us in front of everyone. So embarrassing! He yelled, ""You guys said 18 and now there's 20! What you're doing is making another family wait longer! You're also taking a table away that should've been cleaned up for someone else!"" EVERYONE who was in the restaurant just stared at us. He was so unprofessional at handling a situation under pressure, and both of these guys (Josh and the male waiter with glasses) treated us like we had stolen money out of their cash boxes!  I sat there feeling uneasy about the situation, and I went to find the General Manager (Mike). As one of the managers at the restaurant, Josh should've felt good that we were bringing in business! We were buying dinner and desserts for over 20 people so we were paying for the service charge as well. Since I don't believe in paying people (or a business) to treat me like crap, yell at me, and embarrass me in front of other paying customers for a SERVICE (and the GM wasn't there), I went looking for another manager. I found Cindy and she was amazing! She told us we were ok to sit there. In fact, she cleaned up another table and moved things around so my entire family could all fit. Our waiter (Ethan) was truly kind and easy going. He was aware of the situation and did his best to make it better! He delivered the best possible service that a waiter could offer. If it wasn't for Ethan or Cindy, the night would've been HORRIBLE! Between the horrible interaction we've had with Josh and an unknown waiter, and the wonderful help and true customer service from Cindy and Ethan we're giving this restaurant 2-stars. UPDATE (2 weeks later 8/25) I contacted their GM (the next day) to inform him about Josh's actions, and he apologized and said he'd send a letter to me as a ""formal apology."" Well,  2 weeks later and still no word. Their customer service isn't about the customer. It's about their bottom line! Don't spend your hard earned money here. Their GM doesn't care so I can see why their manager wouldn't either."
Cody T.,"Kaysville, UT",32,129,92,1.0,4/24/2017,"I sat down and the first thing I noticed was my spoon had old food on it. Huge turn off and very unappetizing. Next, my cloudy water glass had a slow leak that started to make the table wet. Got my food. Food was fine but the sweet potato fries were over cooked and mostly little crumbs.  For the price of the meal, I can honestly say I was disappointed."
Doris D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,44,17,1.0,5/3/2017,"Service was prompt and good , I ordered filet mignon medium but I received an overcooked well done steak. If you serve steak and ask customers how they want it cooked then it should be done as ordered. Don't order steaks here, waste of money!"
Kay P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",521,279,823,3.0,6/9/2016,"The food is always good.  The hit or misses are the waiters.  The waiters here are like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get.  One week I can have an awesome waiter who is on the ball with refilling drinks, clearing empty plates and has just enough personality to make the conversation light and short without being annoying.  Another week you can have the worst possible service ever where your waiter disappears behind the cash register and you spot her eating food and on her cell phone when you've already asked for a refill. Three times.   Consistency in service here gets a C- but the food is always satisfactory.  I dislike change so I order the same things over and over again but I'm not upset.  Each dish comes out better than the last time I ordered it.  Drinks: tequila or Asian pear martini  Apps: firecracker salmon, ahi tuna tartar Mains: pasta lovers get the Pasta DaVinchi.  Carnivores: hibachi steak with garlic potatoes, tempura asparagus and a delicious sweet sauce to top it off.  Did i mention the meat is fork tender?  Dessert: the portions are so generous here that I hardly ever have room for a slice of delicious cheesecake but you can't go wrong with the classics like strawberry and turtle.  If you're feeling fancy and want a stomach ache that hurts so good, get the white chocolate cheesecake. Just don't look in the mirror afterwards bc you won't like the gut you've created."
Jenn V.,"Ogden, UT",14,2,,2.0,11/3/2017,"Would you like garlic with a side of noodles?? Then get the fettuccine Alfredo. The dish looked wonderful and the noodles looked fresh. Unfortunately, the sauce was so heavily saturated with garlic I could not taste literally anything else. I ate about 5 bites of my 16 dollar pasta and my stomach was churning from the pungent garlic smell. I love garlic as much as the next person, but I could not stomach this.  Why not tell the waiter, you ask? Because he rarely showed up. It took him 15 minutes to fill our drinks. He asked for boxes and I told him I didn't care for dish and I did not want to take home. He completely ignored my statement and offered dessert. I would have if my appetite and patience were still intact.  I have never received good service here. But I continue to go because most of the food is great. However, this just tipped it for me. I don't think I can return to this establishment."
Jake M.,"Layton, UT",75,20,1,5.0,1/13/2017,"Love this location. They have great service and the best chefs. I'm always happy when I leave. Definitely would recommend!  My only advice... Since it's such a busy location, the wait time sucks, so if you're going on a busy night, plan an hour or two as buffer. Worth the wait though!"
April L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",194,163,265,4.0,4/24/2016,"I had my birthday dinner here. There was a 30 minute wait on a Wednesday! If you don't want to wait, see if the round tables are available since those are open seating. Our server was great. We enjoyed our time there. I don't ever have anything bad to say except the wait times can be long. They are always so busy but the service has never lacked. They even sang happy birthday to me!"
Anna N.,"Carson, CA",695,256,1510,4.0,7/24/2016,"In comparison to the fashion place location, this location is much better. We were at city creek and craving for pasta so stopped in. They have a huge menu and I ended up ordering miso salmon instead. Before 5, they offer a lunch menu. I noticed it was pretty much $5 off the dinner prices. Miso salmon was very tasty! My boyfriend ordered chicken Alfredo, it was full of flavor compared to when I ordered it at fashion, which tends to be bland."
Samantha W.,"Cedar City, UT",120,81,37,5.0,6/9/2017,"So I'm giving cheesecake factory a 5 star solely because​ I love their cheesecake. I've eaten here on several occasions and haven't been too impressed with their food, but man, their cheesecake is perfect. At this location, their service is really quick and all the waiters and waitresses are friendly and on top of things. If I'm ever craving cheesecake, this is definitely the place that I go to."
Laura P.,"Henderson, NV",43,29,1,1.0,6/21/2017,Having to wait for a table for 1 at 9pm? Sounds strange but ok.. 10min to order ok getting irritated.. 20min for Burger and fries to come out only for the Burger to come out pink when I said Well Done!!  I'm done with this place.
