Emily J.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2014,"Came in with a group of friends around 5pm. The host upon entering rude and made us feel like we were a burden for entering the restaurant.  She may have been the manager come to think about it. Anyway, we were quoted 20 minutes. Five minutes into out wait and after seeing this same host/manager running back and forth from the front without smiling and continuing on with her bad attitude with others we decided to leave."
Howard V.,"Seattle, WA",87,10,,1.0,2/19/2016,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory all over this country and have frequented their other franchise Grand Luxe many times.  This,  by far was the worst experience I have ever had.  The food was horrible and the service was worse than the food. My orders were not complicated. According to my server,  the kitchen failed to adhere to my request for light sour cream on my order.  She stated that not only did they forget, the amount on the order was so much that she ordered me another and the manager comped the item. I did not complain,  or request any accommodation.  I had nothing to do and nowhere to go.  I was enjoying an evening with my daughter who has to have their calamari whenever we see a restaurant and I give the option.  The calamari was extremely salty but she enjoyed.  Back to my situation.  When the check came to the table I was charged twice for the items that were comped but only one item was deducted. Basic math suggests that 2-1=1. The tally for the messed up entree should have been 2-2=0. When I pointed this out,  the waitress promptly engaged in a back and forth that included every thing from the kitchen messed up,  to the manager messed up.  Somewhere in the back and forth this sorry excuse for a hospitality industry employee made the mistake of saying. ""Well you ate it...""  Zero to 100 real quick. Go get your manager.  Somewhere in there,  there was an offer to fix it and an admission that she had made a mistake by not reviewIng the check.  Too late!  You really messed up when you chastised me for eating the dish I came in to purchase that you charged me twice for after extending the offer to comp the item. Sadly the table next to me had a different problem with the quality of her order.  The waitress reordered the dish.  When the waitress looped back around,  the other patron explained she might just be interested in something else.  In a huff the waitresses tells the lady,  to basically make up her mind because if she doesn't want the replacement dish she needs to hurry up and cancel the order she submitted. Thanks a bunch.  On a first time trip to Salt Lake City and the state of Utah,  my daughter and I now have a miserable experience to remember. I tried to use it as a teaching experience. I explained to her that this young lady either was really bad at her job or was really having a bad day.  I went on to share almost by default I tip 20% of the check amount.  In cases where the kitchen messes up I don't penalize the server.  In this case I explained that on the little check we had of $30 and some change I paid $31. When the manager asked did I need change I said no.  #unbelievable We should have gone to IN and Out Burger."
Michelle B.,"Sparks, NV",40,17,15,5.0,6/23/2014,"We had heard how great Cheesecake Factory was but this was our first time finding out for ourselves. The food was as good as we hoped it would be and then some.  I got one of the Skinnylicious Salads on the supplemental menu and it was loaded with yummy beets, asparagus, goat cheese and healthy options. I was going to get the skinny balsamic too but the server brought my husband his ranch dressing early and I had to taste it. It had a stronger that usual garlic flavor, obviously homemade and was fantastic on my salad.  Hubby got the Skinnylicious Turkey and Avocado sandwich and he loved it! My daughter ordered the bowties, butter and Parmesan which she practically inhaled. From the fresh, soft bread to the end of the meal, it was all terrific. We unfortunately left no room for the actual dessert but that was okay.  Our server was also fantastic, quick to take care of our needs despite the fact that the place was slammed, gave us helpful information and where to go within walking distance and how to get there too.  We can't wait for the one to open in Reno now!"
Kevin S.,"San Jose, CA",41,4,,1.0,9/25/2013,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience I've ever had. I've been to half a dozen different Cheesecake Factory locations in California, and I've always had a positive experience. This location sucks. It took forever to get a glass of iced tea. Right when I was wondering what was taking so long with the tea, our server walks by with a half full glass of iced tea saying he's looking for more tea. A few minutes later he finally found some and drops it off at the table. As I'm stirring in the sugar I noticed dozens of black specks floating around in my glass. I assumed (and hoped) they were little bits if tea leaves. The glass was also dirty, it had bits of caked on particles.  Our server brought us bread, it must have been sitting under a warmer for hours because it was incredibly dry and crusty. No amount of butter could save it.  The main course was ok. I had a pasta dish, the pasta was very oily but it tasted ok.  The service was also incredibly slow. I think we were there over an hour just for lunch. Our server seemed to want to be our buddy and kept saying things like ""cool man"" and ""whatever you want man"". He even patted my husband on the back as he was leaving the table once. Not very professional at all.  We skipped dessert. Normally I love cheesecake, but I just wanted to get out of there ASAP."
Lex R.,"Farmington, UT",0,5,,2.0,8/28/2015,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory and I'm not typically a harsh critic but my server was an ass. He wouldn't refill any of our drinks, didn't get us more bread when we asked and everytime he came to our table he acted annoyed and we would try to joke around with him and thank him for everything and he wouldn't say anything and just kept a straight face the whole time. The two tables next to him were both talking crap on his horrible customer service skills as well... I got the chopped salad and it tasted horrible... And for dessert I got the Reese cheesecake and it tasted fantastic but I found something blue and gummy in it... (not sure what it was). Very dissatisfied."
Frank M.,"West Valley City, UT",497,781,41,5.0,11/16/2013,"I feel like the Cheesecake Factory's menu is far to big. But then again, that's probably why they are as popular as they are. But this location is really awesome. I hadn't been here before or realized how absolutely HUGE it is. The ceilings must be 30 feet high. It reminded me of being at a Vegas casino honestly. Our server was good. The food is above average like most Cheesecake Factory items. Large wine and liquor selection. Foot rubs offered in the bathroom. But they kicked my gay friend out because he was gay...I'm kidding, I just hear people say City Creek is judgmental and I don't understand how a building with a bunch of stores in it can be judgmental. In any case, there was no wait, we were let right in, and I'm impressed. I say come here if you're right between Fashion Place and City Creek, this will probably be a slightly better experience."
Allan K.,"Hillsboro, OR",234,295,47,5.0,9/27/2012,"this brand new location located in downtown Salt Lake is fantastic.  We started the evening with Chicken lettuce wraps, that would put PF Chang's to shame.  My main course was the spicy cashew chicken with the sauce on the side and it was delicious.  I am usually not a fan of chains, but I love this place"
Eric A.,"Olympia, WA",31,20,2,1.0,12/27/2013,"Don't trust their claims of ""a short wait"". That was over an hour. Not cool. The waitress was nice. But the servers helping put a ridiculously hot kids plate of Mac and cheese in front of my 3 year old. I had a burger, it wasn't very good.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the place. It's a good things it's relatively cheap."
Sten W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3,24,1,5.0,11/30/2012,"Delicious. Good service. Wide variety of food if your group cannot agree on one type of restaurant. Beautiful interior. Smooth operation. Yes restaurants do get busy people, what did you expect? Everyone from the hostess to the chef was efficient. And it was yummy."
Hannah V.,"Ventura, CA",3,60,7,3.0,9/4/2013,"I don't want to give this place a bad rating, nor do I want to give it a good one. Service is a lot faster than my hometown Cheesecake Factory, but that was pretty much the only good part. I got the soup and salad lunch combo, seeing as most of their portions are huge and smothered in buttery sauces. The texture of the tortilla soup was nasty, and the salad was just a pile of spring mix with a couple tomatoes floating around. Their blue cheese dressing is amazing, I'll give them that. I don't go to Cheesecake Factory very often and this was just another reminder of why that is."
Justin S.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,1.0,12/23/2015,"The service was horrible tonight and the food wasn't much better. We had a large group of 12 and only one person taking care of our table and she had several other large table to take care of.  When the food was brought to our table the wait person then just disappeared and 2 people hadn't gotten their food.  she never asked if anyone needed anything (condiments, missing food, drink refills). By the time she came back and realized 2 people didn't get there food, everyone else were almost finished with their meals.  One person in our group never got their salad and ice tea refills with no ice. there were 4 separate bills so everyone paying put their credit cards with their bill in the holder.  The wrong credit cards were charged for the wrong bills and we couldn't get anyone to come over to our table to sort out the mess.  Definitely wasn't worthy the hour drive to get there and the hour wait to be seated."
Laurie B.,"Wolfville, Canada",63,156,2,4.0,12/23/2013,"I know, I know. It's a generic, chain restaurant. Hate it! Burn it! Harass the staff for their negligence! Here's the catch to this review: I ordered to slices of cheesecake to go from their to-go counter by the door. The cashier was helpful and prompt, the slices of cheesecake were delicious, and I didn't have to wait that long even though people were overflowing out of the lobby to be seated AND to get to-go cheesecake. So, all of those add up to a very pleasant experience and positive review. Naturally I reserve the right to update if I ever dine in at the actual restaurant, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there."
Maestro L.,"Lehi, UT",26,938,1507,1.0,4/26/2013,Make sure you have your sneakers on before you get here because you will be running from here.  Hour and 1/2 lunch ?  Really?  slow slow ssllooww  ssslllooowww.   Food was slow slow..I mean so so..  Spend your hard earned money at many local better server eateries in the area.  This lunch was a sh*& show
Mich M.,"Ogden, UT",0,2,,5.0,6/2/2014,"My husband and I drive one hour to go to Salt Lake, for the past two years we have been going to this cheesecake factory every couple months, December 9 was a very important day for me and decided to bring some friends with me, the food is always excellent very consistent on the portion and the taste. However the service was horrible the server was not pleasant and she didn't do any efforts to make it better, so we decided to drive a bit further and to go to Murray, however tonight we needed to go to city creek  and I was craving for cheesecake factory. I am so happy we came back to our restaurant, William was our server he is very professional,  great recommendations excellent service, attention to details without being pushy, so glad. We came back and even decided to go back as early as  next Monday. Thank you for hiring such a great asset to your company. M&M"
Erin C.,"Nashville, TN",40,72,137,4.0,2/7/2014,"Pretty good and fast service. I came for a business lunch and ordered a fried chicken salad. It's lunch menu item but there was plenty of food and I actually didn't finish it all. Overall for a quick fix for lunch, not a bad choice."
Dave N.,"Kaysville, UT",12,14,,5.0,4/19/2014,"I've decided that for chain restaurants in Utah, The Cheesecake Factory (but only this location; the one at Fashion Place definitely plays second fiddle to this one) is #1.  Great food, great cheesecake, good service, and I've finally figured out that you can easily split an entree and a cheesecake if you want to save a few bucks;  yes, they give you that much food!"
Caitlyn S.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",361,11,6,1.0,6/25/2014,"Great food, horrible experience. My boyfriend ordered the Cuban sandwhich, his regular, but this time it was horrible. The bottom of the sandwhich was burnt black. So we sent it back. After waiting about ten minutes the new one comes out. Still burnt on the bottom but just a little bit better than the first. Still burnt though! Like seriously?! We were waiting for a new sandwhich so not only did they burn it again, but they could have taken it off the press and we could have gotten it faster as well and we would have been a lot happier. They didn't take the sandwhich off the bill, but I disputed it. First of all, the second sandwhich came out burnt again and we waited 10 minutes. Second, the manager never came to apologize. Third, they wanted to charge us and the waiter got all snarky when we wanted to talk to a manager about it. They ended up taking the sandwhich off but they were rude about it. Also, he said he took off the ""first"" sandwhich just not the second. He's all, ""so we took off one sandwhich now you want two sandwhiches taken off?"" it's like uhh we should have never had two to begin with if the cooks made it right the first time. So we order one sandwhich not two. A remake of a horrible sandwhich does not count as two? And if the second sandwhich that came out after 10 minutes of waiting was yummy and perfect -NOT BURNT AGAIN- then we would have nooo problem paying! But $13 for a sandwhich that came back bad again? No way. We used to love going here but never again."
Allie E.,"Roswell, GA",0,5,,4.0,3/17/2015,"The hostess with the platinum hair was rude and indifferent at first but got me seated quickly. The server was great, very attentive, and funny. I had the eggplant parmesan and it was really good. I'd have it again! The lemonade was homemade, really tart, but in a really good way."
Ivy S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",65,38,7,1.0,10/23/2013,"They get one star only because the cheesecake was delicious. That's it! I ordered a popcorn shrimp appetizer and about 3/4 the way through, I bit into a piece and it was basically battered and fried fish bones. No joke!! I nearly swallowed 6 bones! (Counted) the waitress walked up just as it happened to ask how they were ironically as I was pulling bone after bone out of my mouth attractively on our wedding anniversary. They didn't comp the appetizer but brought out something we didn't ask for and the manager came over to tell me that it was so ""weird!"" Uh... no shit. I wasn't there for any of that. I was there to spend time with my husband. Totally horrible experience."
Paul P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,9,,1.0,7/4/2012,"DISASTER EXPERIENCE FROM HELL Long insulting wait to be served Prepackaged not FRESH Food! We were so excited to go to the CF.  Well may I say this was my first and last visit! The greeting and seating!  We were greeted with pleasantly with ""we have immediate seating outside (outside temp 98) or it is a 20 minute wait for inside.  We choose to wait and were given a pager and about 20 minutes later the pager alerted us and handed it to the a hostess.  She took another party to their table and overhead the same greeting ""we have immediate seating outside..."" to a family that just walked in.  They choose to go outside but the hostess and our hostess now escorted us behind the new family.  To our shock their hostess said oh look we have an empty table and sat them at our table right in front of us!  Our hostess apologized and we stood another 10 min in the dining area waiting for a new table to open.  We ordered drinks including wine and they came to the table promptly.  We then placed our orders.  Ten minutes later the waitress comes back to inform my niece they just ran out of the small lunch pizza she ordered and said she could order the larger dinner version but it would cost more and would not come with salad.  What does this mean!  Two things come to mind:  1. if the really cared about us they would have just brought the bigger pizza after our disastrous seating experience,  2. that obviously they are serving frozen prepackaged food - otherwise if they had dough to make a large pizza then why would they not have the same dough to make a small pizza! The wait - it was over an hour after my niece graciously said she we would have something else off the menu that our food came and over 1.5 hours after we were seated before we were served!  No drink refills (we had to ask). The disaster!  We had a small catastrophe before we were served in that an ice tea glass was knocked over and broke and glass and ice tea were everywhere.  We managed to clean it up the best we could but sat there in broken glass and tea all over the place with no assistance (although two employees acknowledged the breakage - but did not assist - other than handing us a towel).  We piled up the larger pieces of glass and ice on a spare plate with the towel.  The waitress never took away the mess and we sat and had to eat our lunch in broken glass and water.  She took our lunch plates away but never took the mess away nor called for assistance.   Bottom line!  NEVER AGAIN!  The worst service ever!  Mediocre prepackaged food, long waits and totally insulting experience!   Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!"
