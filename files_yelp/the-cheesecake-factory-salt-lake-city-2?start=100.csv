Victoria M.,"Clearfield, UT",103,427,869,2.0,8/18/2015,"Not too sure what was going on, but this location didn't impress me at all. We came with a party of 20+  for a family dinner, but still, they should be used to tending large parties. Over an HR wait for our food, & then kept forgetting my cousin's cocktails. They were short staffed, I get it, but it still doesn't mean we have to wait forever for refills on bread/drinks, etc. Idk what was going on that day. Although our waiter was nice, they should have had 2-3 servers for our table."
Ray B.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,22,2,2.0,8/18/2016,The greeters in the front are especially rude here. But I'm used to it I go to the cheese lake factory in California. The wait staff is always nice and the food is always great. But those front people are always  nasty. If there is a long wait I get my name in and then leave. Maybe they don't get enough tips. I dunt know
Greg S.,"Tucson, AZ",5,74,26,3.0,7/11/2016,"Awesome selection of food,  but for the price paid,  the food, while good, wasn't all that!  We did love the cheesecake though."
Julia M.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,72,,4.0,12/6/2015,"It's just your regular chain restaurant but we had a really good experience here. Our waiter was nice and very attentive. I got a spicy Cajun pasta dish off their huge menu and a mojito and both were really good. I thought their food would be worse since it's difficult to make every dish superb with such a huge variety on the menu, but I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, the cheesecake for dessert (we shared a piece of peanut butter chocolate) was delicious, but who can really mess up cheesecake? Obviously there are more unique spots to check out in the downtown Salt Lake area but we had a good time at this Cheesecake Factory location!"
Addison G.,"Tempe, AZ",22,91,4,2.0,6/4/2016,"Pretty disappointed with this location. Typically the Cheesecake Factory is always at least 4 or 5 stars. But this one really disappointed me. We were seated in the most awkward location. It was just two of us, we were pushed up against a wall and one foot away from us was another table of 4 really loud and obnoxious people. When there was obviously plenty of other open tables. Next, our food was cold! I ordered gf pasta which is normally outstanding. What I think happened was it was made, and then left out. And it cooled, a lot. The only reason we kept it to eat was because we were in a hurry. Our server seemed like he didn't quite care, once we mentioned we were in a hurry he stopped making eye contact. We also did not get any bread before our meal. Not that I could eat it anyway, but my husband was missing it. Especially when everyone around us had some. Also, our check didn't come in a booklet. He just handed us this slip of paper and we were kind of confused why everyone around us got booklets but not us. This was probably the worst customer service we've ever received from a Cheesecake Factory."
Caitlin C.,"Saint George, UT",62,12,16,2.0,7/19/2016,"Wow!  What a poor experience!  The server was so incredibly rude,  interrupting our conversations to butt in and try to be a part of them,  thinking he was funny.  He asked a friend of ours if another one of our friends was drunk after one drink!  The food came out after sitting there for at least a half hour.  Crusty and overheated.  The service was slow and we ended up spending more than 3 hours there."
Steve M.,"Honolulu, HI",98,47,11,5.0,6/10/2015,"Aloha,  Visited Cheescake Factory on the way home form a yellowstone trip June 10th, 2015...It was crowded, and we decided to the 4 of us, My wife, Baby V and Son Dima decided to wait for an outside Table. When we finally were guided to our seats, we found our baby carriage couldn't be accommodated! We were upset, as we waited 25 minutes for the seat. The manager came, and introduced himself as Michael. He was super professional and accommodating. Listen, problems occur in life. It HOW they are handled that differentiate a good experience from a bad one. Michael is a professional. He was empathetic and got us seated in a location that would accommodate the babies carriage...What can i say. He solved our issue as best as could be done with minimal drama. The meal was fine afterward.... Mahalo Michael!!!"
Shauna S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",51,1108,595,4.0,10/12/2015,"This is a good place to take a break from shopping to eat and relax. There is usually a long wait since they don't take reservations. But their cheesecake and Parmesan crusted chicken Romano are worth it!! We usually fill up on their hot brown and sourdough breads with butter before our entrees, but we plan on taking some home because you have to get dessert too!"
Ryan F.,"Salt Lake City, UT",26,45,11,4.0,10/12/2014,"Last night we were told our wait would be 50 minutes. It turned out to be about 70. The manager apologized about that without us even mentioning it so that was cool. I do love their bread, and the fact that they refill it. I've had their pizza, nachos, burgers, and pasta in the past. This still I tried the macaroni and cheese burger. Just average. Buns were toasted almost to a burnt point. The meat patty didn't have much flavor or juiciness to it.  I think the main thing you gotta do is stick with the pasta dishes. I feel like their tastiest meals are on the pasta menu. Cheesecake is awesome."
Elle D.,"San Jose, CA",64,145,695,4.0,5/19/2014,"Had dinner here on a Saturday night. It took about 30--40 minutes wait. Pros: -pizza--chicken, delicious! -Cajun Jambayan pasta--3/5, could use a bit of spice. Chicken was tender and good -mushroom lettuce wrap--good -complimentary brown bread--reason why I went here--yay---coming back just for it.  -decor--inside and outside are great! -family friendly Cons: -wait was too long but they have a good system. It's next to a lot of shops so my friend and I went shopping while the rest of the team waited :) - 1 for the Jambalayn pasta--need more spice for it to be called Cajun!  Recommend this place for -dates-"
Crystal P.,"San Clemente, CA",46,55,5,2.0,12/13/2016,"I could not believe the wait we had AFTER our buzzer went off indicating our table was ready. We were a party of 5 hanging out outside, with my rambunctious and tired one year old, when the buzzer went off indicating our table was ready. We went in and was told to stand at the hostess table as we would be seated shortly. It was super cramped at the hostess table but we were expecting to be seated shortly so it wasn't a big deal. Unfortunately, that was not remotely the case! We waited another 20minutes while other parties (same size as ours, some larger, some smaller) were all seated. It was so incredibly uncomfortable. We kept getting bumped into by both staff and patrons. We asked multiple times when we would be seated and we kept receiving the same answer ""soon"". Mind you, we had already waited 45minutes for our buzzer to go off. Needless to say I was not very happy with any of the hosts or the managers who were foreseeing this fiasco with us and with the giant crowd growing inside at the host stand. However, the best part about our visit was our waitress. She was absolutely fantastic, I wish I knew her name so I could give her credit. She did an amazing job regardless of how busy she was. Thank you! Oh and the food was ok--some of us loved ours, others of us, not so much."
Chae H.,"South Jordan, UT",0,33,14,3.0,1/3/2016,"My family loves this place. The inside is very interesting. My husband only likes the filet mignon, which is actually really good, I'd choose this as well. I usually get the eggplant Parmesan which tastes really good, but it's pretty popular, so try to find something else just in case they don't have it that day. Even though their menu is big, there aren't a lot of good menu items. I've tried many things here, and I only like three things. Filet mignon, eggplant Parmesan, and super antioxidant salad. The flavors of the other items are pretty mediocre for how much the food costs. I suggest asking the server more detail of their food. It can be either really good or really disappointing."
Mickey D.,"Long Beach, CA",17,23,5,1.0,6/5/2016,Came to this location once before about two years ago and the service was horrible. I thought we would give it another shot and guess what? It's STILL horrible. The soup was brought out cold; almost as if they opened a can and threw it in a bowl. The food was SUPER bland and after waiting for about 30 minutes for some damn cheese.... We decided to just pack up our bland ass food and leave. Never again. (Not to mention the waitress kept dropping our silverware)
Michelle K.,"Park City, UT",67,194,2,4.0,9/7/2015,"It's been awhile since I've been to a Cheesecake and oh how much I missed this place.  I had forgotten how good the food is and the portions are humongous but you pay for what you get.  The prices are slightly steep at $12-$18/dish at night but you'll always have leftovers to take home. The cheesecake is what I come here for and never fails.  The only gripe (or two) are the wait is at least an hour on weekends and the bathroom gets dirty, fast!"
Umberto M.,"Dübendorf, Switzerland",8,4,5,2.0,7/22/2015,Food was average. Not really special. The cheesecake was also not special. We expected more given the name the place had.
Zach L.,"Orem, UT",260,237,166,4.0,2/25/2013,"My favorite chain.  I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for this stuff.  Great (albeit extremely caloric) cheesecake.  Huge portions.  The best veggie burger I've had at a chain.  Yes, long waits, huge menu, overpriced steak (for the quality).   I also don't get the fascination with the chicken madeira.  You can buy a good madeira wine from the liquor store for $10 and make several servings of the stuff.  Buy quality chicken and brine it and you're in business.   Anyway, it's not Copper Onion and certainly not Forage, but it's my guilty pleasure.  I do try to support the local places / Mom and Pop dives, but CCF has always been a favorite."
Christoph S.,"Williamsville, NY",10,127,399,3.0,7/28/2015,"We were there for a late lunch on a Monday. Service was very friendly and the menu is more or less the standard Cheesecake Factory menu  - no big surprises, well prepared good value for the money. We like also the new line with dishes below 600 cal."
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",992,1005,3062,4.0,2/7/2014,"I'm a fan of cheesecake. I have a few favorite items on the menu, such as the herbed salmon and baja chicken tacos. There is definitely a lot to choose from, and not everything (in my opinion) is good, but it is a good place to go to so everyone's palate can be satisfied!  At this location, Noah was our waiter and he was sooooo nice and friendly. I made sure to tell his manager that because he deserved it!  Since there are only two cheesecake factories in Utah there is usually always a long wait, so make sure to go during non rush hour times!"
Kyley S.,"Ogden, UT",11,14,2,4.0,4/6/2015,This is always a family favorite restaurant for large groups and birthday celebrations!! Tonight I had the turkey burger-gluten free and sweet potato fries. It was delicious and for our party the food came out fast and hot!! I always have to go with the carrot cake here although it is the cheese cake factory.... The carrot cake is very moist and flavorful that I can't switch from it!!!   Our waitress had a great attitude and was very personable!!
Ti D.,"Sandy, UT",273,76,99,5.0,7/24/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a great choice because of several reasons; nice decor, fun ambiance, huge selection for the menu and gigantic portions. We went on July 24th in the evening, we started off and ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer, Wow it was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside for 13.95 for 3 patties, it was justified. I had the Cajon jumbolya pasta and it was massive with plenty of seafood on top of a hearty pasta noodle. My wife had gumbo over brown rice, it was flavorful and plenty of authentic flavor the gumbo was chunky, full of sausage, lean chicken and spicy . Never would've guessed cheesecake would have good soul food. You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake factory."
