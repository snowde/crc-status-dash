Jenny B.,"Sunset, UT",64,2,,1.0,1/30/2016,"Horrible Service!!! We waited at least 45 mins to be seated then we sat for another 30mins before we got our drinks and it was 50mins from when we were seated before we had bread. Finally 30 mins later we had our food. The food was cold and multiple orders were wrong. When we talked to the manager all he could do was make excuses and defend his cook. Total lack of customer service!!! The manager finally took one item of our bill after a 10min discussion of why it wasn't his fault!! I guess they don't want my business!  I highly suggest finding a different restaurant that has good food, warm food and who cares about their customers!!!"
Greg B.,"Meridian, ID",48,10,,1.0,12/29/2015,This is the pinnacle of chain restaurant hell. I am humiliated that I have to eat here. No restaurant should be frequented that tries to serve every style food under the sun.
Jill K.,"Provo, UT",1,46,,5.0,11/13/2016,I've never gotten something from Cheesecake Factory I didn't enjoy. That was until last night. We told our waiter we didn't like our meal and he was very kind and quick to bring us something else. I've never experienced bad customer service AT THIS LOCATION. Cheesecakes are all wonderful.
Ruediger S.,"Houston, TX",3,62,,2.0,10/3/2016,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a Monday afternoon around 5 pm. While the place was pretty empty we were asked to wait to be seated. That process was extremely slow. It looked like one party was seated every five minutes. So we waited more than 15 minutes for a table in an almost empty restaurant. We asked for an outside table which we got. Unfortunately nobody had closed the sun umbrellas (there was no sun anymore), so getting to a table required some careful maneuvering for people taller than six feet (which included some of the waiters. The service was slow, the food was okay, but nothing special. Overall a very disappointing experience."
Gerard I.,"Pasadena, CA",501,806,351,3.0,10/16/2014,"I don't really like the Cheesecake Factory for regular food - just the cheesecake. We headed on over to this location, because we were walking round the fancy mall, and decided it was time for some sweets. I did order an appetizer of stuffed parmesan mushrooms, a long island iced tea, and a tiramisu cheesecake slice.  The mushrooms were good but I've had better and the Long Island was good but I've also had better. I topped off the meal with their ""elegant martini,"" which is another word for ""dirty martini"" and that bastard did not disappoint! It was strong, dirty, and tasty! Unfortunately I was so full that I could not finish the two blue cheese stuffed olives that were in the drink. I was annoyed but it was my own fault.  Oh, and the tiramisu cheesecake was to die for. Their cheesecake usually is.  I can go for a martini right about now, though."
Nicole G.,"Lehi, UT",55,32,15,1.0,12/20/2015,Second time here and terrible service. They were out of bread and understaffed for a Sunday night a week before Christmas. I used to be a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but my experiences with it in Utah have led me to the inevitable conclusion that they can't handle crowds. I chalk it up to management sucking big time. We weren't even given water until our appetizer arrived. I will probably never eat here again.
John L.,"Concord, CA",73,122,31,4.0,6/23/2013,"I love their cheesecakes!!!! Cons: Their menu is huge!!! Makes it hard to go through it all and decide what you want to eat. Their food is also a little bit more on the pricey side, but the food was delicious. I got the Smokehouse BBQ Burger, it was affordable and delicious. They come with your choose of salad or fries. A No-brainer decision for me to choose fries. Their list of cheesecakes are huge. It took me over 5 minutes to decide which one to get. Whichever one you decide, you will love it! But be warned... its about $7-8 a slice and its loaded with calories... I wouldn't be surprised if we are talking about 1000 calories a slice. But I love it!!!"
Jun L.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2015,"Honestly i would gave them a zero star if i could. please let me gave you a little background. This was Wednesday, 09/09/2015. my boyfriend and i went there around 5pm, the restaurant had some customers but not like dinner hours packed. Let's just start off with the server. We got a guy server, after we ordered our drinks and food he never came back to us for good 10-15 minutes. then a lady showed up say she's gonna be our server. I asked her to bring us some fresh bread because the ones that the pervious server brought to us was bit cold and hard to chew. She started to ""explain"" (in a harsh tone): "" all our bread are like that, i mean i could if you really want to but it's gonna be the same."" i was like, ""the bread is very hard and i would like to have some fresh ones. please do so."" She said, "" okay fine, i will bring you some!"" seriously, your job is to bring what customers want, not to argue with me how i want my bread!! Then we got our food, till we finished our food, she never come by refill water/check on us/ anything. few minutes after we finished, she brought us the dessert menu but we decided to just skip it and asked her to bring us the check. When my boyfriend got the check, he asked me, "" please tell me what does she mean?!"" he handed me the bill, the server circled the tips section and wrote a big ""thank you!"" right next to it. we both felt confused and uncomfortable, ""who would just circle the tips section? for what? to tell/ remind us that we need to tip her????""  so my boyfriend went to talk to the manager, the manager of that night was a hispanic lady, she explained that the server circled it because not everyone knows to pay the tips, they circle tips on every single customers bill. my boyfriend said, "" did you check? because i really don't think she will circle the tips section on American customers' bills."" by the way, my boyfriend and i are both international college students (asians) but i don't think there's any communication/ language barriers that we had with the server or the manager. my boyfriend said to her, "" well this is not a comfortable situation, i felt that she is asking and reminding me for the tips."" The manager just acted like it's not a big deal and said, ""oh sorry you felt offended, i will talk to her. you don't have to pay the tips if you don't want to."" We both live in the US for over 5 years, and this is the first time i learned that ""it's a common thing that servers circle tips section to remind customers to pay the tips."" We left the restaurant that night so upset and pissed, not only because of the server but more the manager. Just because we don't look like ""American"", so you just assumed that we don't know ""American culture""?!!!!!! WOW I AM SPEECHLESS!!"
Angela F.,"Orem, UT",3,10,2,4.0,10/17/2014,"Our expectations were very low.  We visited at 10 at night on Thursday and the only reason we chose CF was because it was one of the only places still open.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The service was great!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers: stuffed mushrooms, parmesan cheesy garlic bread, shrimp spring rolls, potato tots, Greek salad, and warm asparagus salad.    We liked all the dishes but the shrimp spring rolls which were a disappointment because we couldn't taste any shrimp.  The Greek salad was the best I've had and Greek salad is one of my favorites. The produce seemed fresh and high quality.  We also liked the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake we had for dessert.  Thanks CF for hitting the spot when we needed it!"
Trixie B.,"Arcadia, CA",42,533,306,3.0,11/6/2014,Consistently good food and service.  Am knocking down one star for their inability to seat a party of 8 together.  We are talking Salt Lake and Mormans and large families.  Took a group for lunch and without a reservation we had to sit at a table and a booth near each other.
Pattie T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,22,5,2.0,10/7/2015,"I will eat here but only if someone else is buying and I have nothing else to do that night. I always get the chicken madeira which is actually amazing, but the long wait times, very poorly lit and lout atmosphere, and poor customer service makes this place such a hassle. One of the worst things about it here is that they are constantly changing the menu. They will introduce really yummy entrees then take them away a few months later, and you dont know its gone until you have waited an hour for your table and have to ask the waiter why its not on the menu. The chessecake is good, and for that I would just order a slice to go and eat it at home where I can actually see what I'm doing and hear the people talking to me."
Fae L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",49,89,14,1.0,5/25/2015,"Inept service. Every table around us is waiting on something, a check, to go boxes, water, effing bread."
Riley J.,"Midvale, UT",0,3,5,1.0,8/28/2015,"We had reservations for a wedding luncheon at the Cheesecake Factory in City Creek. As we are waiting right now, the luncheon is supposed to start in five minutes and they haven't even started setting up. We have many guests coming and they don't even seem concerned! Never going through them again. So disappointed."
Jeeper W.,"South Salt Lake, UT",17,30,18,1.0,5/12/2015,"So my wife and I and some friends had a horrible experience at brunch here a few months ago. I thought to myself that I would never come here again...at least for brunch. After some time my memory of how bad it was has faded. Today we gave it another try and SURPRISE it has been awful, the service surprisingly has been pretty good but the food was horrid. My pancakes were runny doe inside that was discussing. Our server asked if I wanted some French toast instead and I agreed, the French toast was bad at best and then when he gave me the bill he told me he went ahead and dropped the French toast off the bill for us...I only got the French Toast because you offered it me to attempt to make up for the nasty pancakes....thanks for dropping it off the bill. Of course the cheesecake is always delicious and we will continue to come here for that tasty treat but as far as brunch goes...run away."
Erik K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",382,194,261,5.0,8/4/2012,"Wow. I think there are tons of people used to having their rears wiped by ""the help"" writing some of these reviews...  Let's be fair: this place is popular and has consistently tasty food and a menu rivaled by no other restaurant. They honestly have a little of everything you can imagine. Seriously, I challenge anyone to find a better spot downtown which has such a variety!  This is also a NEW LOCATION - which people obviously can't empathize with. Having served tables at three restaurants in my past lives, I can tell you that running a new restaurant location is super challenging - much less one of this size and magnitude.  I've been here several times since they opened and have had phenomenal service and wonderful food. Wait times for tables have been less than I was quoted, and service was fast and friendly. A hostess even recognized me from two months earlier. I mean, come on people..... If you want it fast, go to Crown Burger. Or better yet, the Mc Donalds inside your WalMart. Otherwise, give it another go and you'll be pleasantly surprised. I'll be back here every time I'm in SLC. Guaranteed."
Lily T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,27,3,3.0,2/1/2016,"I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory on State Street, Murray. Last weekend during shopping at City Creek center, my boyfriend and I decided to have dinner at this restaurant at City Creek. I ordered Steak Diane and my boyfriend ordered tenderloin steak. My food is yum but my boyfriend got a bad luck. There were a lot of fat in his tenderloin steak and overcooked for rare medium. It was expensive dinner and he was so disappointed. We won't come back to this location."
Michael B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",108,53,52,4.0,6/22/2014,"Very good experience, especially if you eat here on a Sunday! There was no wait and the service was efficient and friendly. I ordered the salmon special which was extremely good and reasonable for what you get. It had a sort of plumb glaze and was served atop a bed of rice with a relish of vegetables and a delicious chimi churi type sauce."
L V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,31,,3.0,7/12/2015,"Just OK. The food was generally speaking ok- not bad but also not good. The pastas we had mostly relied on cream for the flavor. I had to add salt to mine, which is the first time ever I had to do this at a restaurant. The avocado egg roll appetizer was the highlight of the meal. The drink I got was exceedingly weak. The dessert was not that amazing either- got the tower cake. It tasted like a cake mix cake. My husband's cheesecake was good. The service was good but the timing of bringing dishes to the table was off- everything was rushed. Overall- overpriced for the quality."
Tayler T.,"Kingsville, TX",0,10,1,5.0,7/25/2016,"We experienced the best customer service ever last week while visiting this place. We got there and realized we needed to leave quick so we didn't miss the train home. We asked the server to just box our food as it came out for a to go order.  The manager swooped in and helped and made it happen. They were so nice and even threw in some free cheesecake and free extra bread! I'll continue to come here every time I'm in town and in city creek! Thank you to the server with ""t Rex"" arms and to the manager that night!"
Marci P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,5,,5.0,1/20/2016,McKay is the best waiter we've ever had! We've eaten at Cheese Cake Factory's since my daughter was 3 all over the country and we came here for her 18th birthday.  BEST BIRTHDAY DINNER EVER! Thanks to McKay! He went above & beyond by far!
