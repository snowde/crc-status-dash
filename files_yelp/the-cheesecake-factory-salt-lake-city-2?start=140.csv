David E.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,2,1,3.0,11/19/2015,Decent spot. My waitress was real nice and I had the Jamaican pepper shrimp and the red velvet cheesecake. I would have made the sauce spicier and served the shrimp over a bed of fried plantains and mango salsa instead of rice and beans. I would have made the bottom layer of cheesecake red velvet instead of chocolate.
Nichole A.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",541,149,560,2.0,5/13/2015,"This review is tough because I actually love cheesecake factory. This location is just sub par compared to other locations. Ordered takeout last night while passing through salt lake city. I ordered the chicken Madeira and a goat cheese and beet salad. Everything was just ok....bland and soggy. About 3 bites into my meal, I found a curly blonde hair....yup....wrapped around the asparagus. I completely lost my appetite and threw everything away. I wouldn't come back."
Laura H.,"Draper, UT",48,9,6,2.0,6/25/2016,"Nasty dirty glass and hair in my food. They didn't comp my food. I've worked in restaurants and never seen that before. Went to celebrate my sons bday, but our waiter wasn't the most attentive and felt like we were waiting a lot more than necessary. Not a fun place to celebrate a bday. Nothing special done. I would give 1 star but our cheesecake was good. Food was good before finding hair."
Jared H.,"Provo, UT",0,6,,2.0,7/16/2016,"I've also been to the one in Murray, and my experience from this location doesn't compare, to say the least. I've only gotten cheesecake-to-go on two occasions, and both times, my cheesecake was frozen. Not quite frozen solid, but frozen enough that the middle of it was icy and kinda ruined it for me. Maybe they have a different standard for cheesecake-to-go, but I don't think I'll ever do to-go again. Dine-in is a better experience."
David P.,"West Jordan, UT",33,56,86,4.0,5/8/2013,"So I went to the Cheesecake factory but didn't try any cheesecake. It was Valentine's day at about 4:30pm. When we went in, there was about a 5 minute wait. As time went on, I was sure that became at least a 30 minute wait. It was getting packed! Anyway, I got the filet mignon. This was actually the first filet mignon I've ever had. It was delicious! Such a tender and big cut of meat. It was well prepared. The service here was excellent. Our waiter kept on constantly checking on us by filling our drinks and just asking how everything's going. This place was pretty pricy. I think I'd save it for more special occasions. But I know when I do go here, it'll be well worth it!"
Jeff G.,"American Fork, UT",170,77,76,5.0,9/26/2015,Tried their steak tacos for the first time and they are unbelievable!!! I would definitely suggest you get those !!  I really didn't care for their food that much and that I was a little overrated for the weight but the steak tacos would definitely be worth it!!  If you take a seat at the little round tables (the bar) you don't have to wait.
Don S.,"Lompoc, CA",1,24,,2.0,7/12/2014,"We always enjoy CF when we have the chance to eat at one... Especially with the kids.  Everything started off great until we ordered, then the wait began. And we waited... Waited... 20 minutes later our drinks arrived. Another 20 minutes went by, and we called our waiter over to inquire about our starter. ""Oops, I forgot to put it in"". ::sigh:: ""Ok, forget it we will wait for the mains, but can you put another drink order in for us?. 20 minutes later the mains show up and the drinks have not come yet. Oh, and the kids food was forgotten as well. ::sigh:: guess we won't try to wait for dessert, which is half the reason we came. Let's go hit the frozen yogurt stand instead so we can get to bed before sunrise."
Andrew L.,"Ogden, UT",10,72,5,1.0,6/18/2015,A laughable attempt at upscale chain dining in Utah.
Shannon A.,"Wake Forest, NC",221,759,357,4.0,3/5/2014,"Not a fan of chains, but while in the City Creek Center area, we were starving and decided that this looked appealing so we ventured in. If you've been to Cheesecake Factory before, you've been to this one. The one addition I will add that was a plus was that it had more of an elegant atmosphere, less family style atmosphere, which I can appreciate.  I had the veggie burger, which I had not ever ordered from Cheesecake before. It came with a side of fries, and I ordered a margarita which were all wonderful! The veggie burger was firm, not too mushy, but perhaps the best part of it was the side of spicy mayo that came with it. Holy crap, this was like crack in a ramekin!  Our server was awesome, on top of his game, without being pushy or cheesy. We got cheesecake to-go to eat later at the hotel. I got my fave, the Godiva cheesecake, but there are a million options to choose from. I've never met a cheesecake I didn't like."
Darla T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,2,1,2.0,5/23/2015,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory, the one located in Fashion Place Mall. The waiter had such a horrible attitude the entire time & rushed my husband and I to order.  The food we ordered was decent, but I decided to tip the waiter in cash instead of on my debit card. To my dismay, the next day when I checked my bank statements, the waiter forged an extra $30 tip on my card. I was absolutely appalled that he would do that, when I called the manager she was not pleasant either. I am not a very hard person to please, but the way the entire situation was handled was a complete joke. Not only what he did was illegal but it was almost worse how the manager dealt with it. No sympathy and gave me a $30 gift card for a meal that was $85. I will never return to this certain location again and I will most definitely be following up with further charges for that waiter."
Marisol M.,"Austin, TX",1,7,1,5.0,10/19/2015,Really good!! We had an awesome server and food was very filling!! And the best part was having that big piece of cheesecake with some Sangria!!
Felipe Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",372,449,48,4.0,7/23/2014,"I'm pretty against chain/franchise restaurants... But I can't be against something that is legitimately good, and tasty, and SO MUCH FOOD IN A PLATE. Their location first of all is gold, with not only perfect downtown location, but also in the City Creek Mall. Good deal to go there after shopping, or walking around downtown. Their service is always great. Their food is always well prepared, and always impressing with their cheesecakes, which truly are a joy to any human being that likes cheesecake (Which should be everyone). I love their nachos with the chicken. The presentation for the nachos is great, but the flavor, the texture... the toppings...! the actual chips!!! Thick and crunchy, but not annoying. Great Guacamole, jalapenos, cheese, creamy cheese, onions. sour cream... and the chicken. SHIIIIIIIII. The chicken is so well made. Perfect seasoning, perfect texture... ahh... I'm pretty in love with these nachos. One nice disclosure: They do not validate parking for City Creek. So don't expect to get your parking paid. They do have a good valet system right beside the restaurant. Also, lots of seating, and nice outside seating too. Chessecake Factory is always a safe choice, since their menu is HUGE. And their quality is pretty good for the most part. But it's not a magical local experience. Or an organic heaven. It's a multistate establishment, like chili's and restaurants of that sort, with a bigger menu and ""nicer"" food. ALSO, I would definitely stay away from their lemonades/limeades. They are extremely terrible. But that's it. Also, Chicken Bellagio is quite the plate."
Marcos K.,"South Jordan, UT",26,18,14,5.0,6/13/2015,I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta. It was cooked perfectly with the right amount of heat.   The hostess and waiter was great.  No complaints here.
Teresa G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,4,,2.0,5/6/2014,"The nachos tasted were good and then I felt sick for 2 1/2 days, the Kobe burger wasn't good either, ordered it medium and it was bloody and very red. Ordered 1/2 sweet potato fries and 1/2 regular fries,  5 minutes after the burger came out the regular fries arrived and were really, really bland and boring and the sweet potato fries kept ""being almost done"" but never came. Won't go back, we had a gift card and even for a free meal it sucked"
Michael C.,"Canton, GA",4,9,4,4.0,9/25/2014,"Typical CCF,   but an awesome location ...  Right next a great mall.  Great layout and helpful polite staff"
Beth S.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,71,6,5.0,9/17/2015,"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.  My family and I were visiting my sister for her college graduation back in 2014 and we all decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for celebratory dinner. This was my first time and I was really excited to go.  It's in downtown Salt Lake and was PACKED, but we got in pretty quickly. Our server was phenomenal. She was very friendly, funny, didn't have a problem explaining menu items to us newbs, and everything came out quickly, considering the rush.  The food was spectacular. The Steak Diane was probably the best steak dish I've ever had in my life. It was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were AMAZING, and the flavor just can't be duplicated (I've tried, thanks Pinterest). Their coffee is superb as well. I nearly stole my hubby's caramel macchiato because it was THAT good.  Of course, the cheesecake is to die for as well. I mean, it better be, it's the CHEESECAKE factory. The hardest part is picking which slice to go for. My all time favorite is the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. It is really rich, so pair it with a latte and you have found heaven.  I can't wait to go back."
Al B.,"Orange, CA",36,26,12,3.0,2/17/2015,"Went with a friend and our three kids. Had good service. Waitress was amazing. I had the shrimp tacos. Although I enjoyed them, I didn't like that there was very little shrimp, and small chunks of chicken in the mix. Also, I felt like the lighting was to dark and made the environment somewhat unpleasant."
Tyler A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,14,1,4.0,4/5/2015,Amazing food bread is good and the cheesecake itself is good.  I do some problems with a long wait and some of the waiters at times can be pushy.  Other than that I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys some good food and cheesecake
Matthew B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",34,141,7,2.0,4/13/2014,"When she told us 45 minutes to an hour wait, she meant to say ""we have no clue when you'll be sat."" this place was good back in the early 2000s. seems like a fancy applebees. i wasn't impressed. I have a hard time blaming the servers, because I understand how difficult that job can be, and those servers are BUSY! Too busy to give great service, but not too busy to give mediocre service. i'll come back for a takeout slice of cake."
Brenda P.,"Rigby, ID",51,10,,5.0,7/26/2015,"As always excellent cheesecake.  Slav our waiter was awesome. He was attentive, efficient and pleasant."
