Megan C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,3,,2.0,7/18/2015,"Went there with my husband for our 1st year anniversary...definitely not the greatest impression for my first time at any Cheesecake Factory. It started out ok because as for any nice restaurant on a Saturday night we had to wait about 25 mins to be seated. Our primary waiter was nice & took our beverage order & followed though in giving us time before coming back while we decide on an appetizer & any other beverages we may like. It all went down hill as soon as the server who brought us our appetizer came by. The table was really small for 2ppl & it was already crowed from our large menus & bread basket & two side plates. This particular server, whom I didn't catch the name of, was obviously in a rush & discourteous as he kept telling me to move the items around to accommodate the large platter so he could put it down. He even was telling my husband to move the items as well. I was trying to tell him that without sweeping the plates & beer bottle off the table that I had no where else to put the items id already stacked & scooted to the side. He hastily plopped the platter down & took off, but not before I had asked him to take the beer bottle to toss as I didn't want to accidentally knock it off & shatter it. He yanked it out of my hand & said, ""yeah, it's that kind of a night."" I work in customer service & that was just uncalled for! When our original waiter came around to take our order we placed our order to go- he was a bit surprised. We explained we did not want to spend our anniversary in an already crowded place if we were just going to be treated like that. My husband said that in the many times he'd been there he's never had service such as that. The manager was informed & very apologetic & even went as far as paying for our entrees and getting us dessert. I appreciated our original waiter & the manager, Tyler. I feel bad that one servers customer service skills were lacking & that it effected the waiter, so we left a small tip anyhow.  Overall it was a sad evening for dining out. Too small of tables, too loud & crowded & the menu is SO big that it takes quite some time to review & decide- it has way too many options. And they really should accept reservations on the weekend. Although it was a rough first experience for me I think I'll give it some time & try it again on a weekday with a reservation."
K Lo ..,"New York, NY",2,56,,3.0,1/2/2014,"As a generic name, they have nothing special to offer.  Includes the same dim lighting, same cubicle like seating, trying-to-be-chirpy waiters and their long wait lines. On the flip side,  Service was fast, portions enough for 2 meals, pricey ( dinner for 2-$50).  Will be a long time before I go there agin. May try, if this is the only place that is open and you are starving for a week. At least you feel a sense of satiety for sure."
Jason W.,"Lehi, UT",92,31,11,3.0,5/2/2015,"The food here is good, but pricey. You could probably find cheaper, better food at lots of places nearby."
DbCooper ..,"Orem, UT",0,325,32,3.0,9/13/2014,I need new friends.  Friends that pick places besides Cheesecake Factory to celebrate their birthday.  That way we can spend 3 hours eating food that's actually enjoyable with waiters/waitresses that won't be put out and are probably spitting in our food.  The one consolation of having to eat here is I can skate across the greasy tile and feel like a kid again.
Mateo P.,"Palmdale, CA",214,2,,4.0,8/1/2015,The service was fantastic and extremely helpful.  Well done Scott!  Food seemed slightly undercooked but probably rushed because we arrived late in the evening.  Great experience overall.
Joy B.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",810,93,181,1.0,8/25/2014,"If you're traveling in large groups you may want to chose another restaurant who could handle your party. We were celebrating a birthday and unfortunately for both us and the staff they do NOT take reservations. Obviously this put everyone in a bind. Are party was to large and  clearly they were understaffed. We  had two waiters waiting on us. One whom was pregnant and looked like she was due any minute. Her attitude was not the nicest, but this is to be expected when your 32 weeks and assigned to a party of 40. Clearly my heart went out to her b/c she simply she was struggling. The other waiter seemed overwhelmed and you could tell immediately he was not up for the task. He was all over the place. The drinks, food, checks got mixed up and at the end he was just so rude and not once apologized for all the mixed up. Finally it was dessert time and when  the dessert came out it was placed in a togo box without our request, we knew that was a hint. Lol! Thankfully everyone had a good time and didn't care about the crappy service we received or the empty drinks that were never refilled, or the snappy waitress who looked like she just wanted her baby out NOW. I was hoping to expect more this time, but yet again I was disappointed with Cheesecake Factory. Sometimes you have to let go and move on.  P.S. Our wait time went from 1 hour, 1 20 mins to 1 hour 50. This is why you do reservations to eliminate this. Tip: Don't come in large groups because they don't do reservations. Better yet go to BRIOS next door."
Amy M.,"Honolulu, HI",347,456,1951,3.0,2/22/2014,"I had arrived at the Cheesecake Factory with my co-worker around 9:30pm. There was a good amount of people waiting to be seated. Luckily for us, since it was just two the wait was 10-15 minutes. I eyed the massive deserts and thought I had died and gone to heaven. The hostess seated us and the waitress greeted us warmly. She brought  warm pumpernickel bread which I gobbled quickly with butter. My co worker ordered the fried chicken sliders and I opted for the chicken Tucson. Grilled chicken with tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli doused with balsamic vinaigrette. The taste was lovely and the flavors married well together. The meal was quite massive for an entree which is normal at the factory. When his order came out he looked surprise as he picked it off the appetizer menu. It was a decent size for an entree ha ha. Any way we left there happy and stuffed. Did not have room for any dessert, and I have a huge sweet tooth:)  I will be back the atmosphere and ambience of the establishment was immensely inviting!!!"
Janet P.,"Tustin, CA",34,22,7,4.0,12/17/2013,"So I was looking for a good place to eat but found everywhere to be up the ying yang busy. The cheesecake factory wait was 10 minutes! Fantastic if you ask me.  The staff was great. Very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Mexican chicken lettuce wraps. The chicken was grilled, it had diced tomatoes, avocado, sour cream and salsa. The food was fresh and delicious.  Very good especially because it is a chain restaurant."
Danny B.,"Lusk, WY",113,280,175,2.0,7/31/2013,Dessert was good. I really do not think the 45 minute wait was worth the entree I had.
Candice S.,"Bountiful, UT",268,195,247,3.0,11/15/2013,"I kinda laugh at the notion that Cheesecake Factory is unique fine dining, but I also laugh at the thought that CF is the devil incarnate.   The pros: Beautiful atmosphere Conveniently located Excellent waitstaff Huge portions The cons: Menu is too extensive Horrible hosts Quantity rules over quality Tables are too close together in certain sections, making private conversation impossible To me, CF is on par with Chili's or Applebee's. It's just there, I never crave it, and it's simply not worth waiting more than 5 minutes to be seated."
Dereksen B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,5,,3.0,5/28/2015,"The food in general is pretty good here, but the service is always less than I expect. I definitely wouldn't say awful, but the seating and food wait times can be ridiculous. In most of my visits, all my waiters say they'll be right back with something and it takes close to 5 - 10 minutes, even for something as simple as getting me a steak knife. It might be that they're always understaffed, whatever it is, it's frustrating. I tried the Ribeye last week, and after sending it back once for being extremely overcooked, it came back undercooked and it just wasn't that good. I'll probably give this CF another try, because it's right there at City Creek and is convenient when you're they're shopping, so hopefully it turns out better."
Jeremy T.,"Roy, UT",31,54,17,1.0,9/27/2014,"The manager was less than accomadating and kind of rude. The service was slow, but the serving staff was friendly at least"
Dillon M.,"Key Largo, FL",1,9,4,3.0,11/21/2014,"Very crowded location with too small of a waiting area. Even at 5:00pm there was already an hour wait. Dim lighting makes it hard to read the menu. The restaurant is 1 floor with the highest ceiling I have ever seen. Seems like they could have made a second floor for more seating, and to increase the size of the waiting area. Tables are all very close so there isn't any privacy. Good variety of food as is at any Cheesecake Factory. My wife and I shared and enjoyed the bang bang chicken and shrimp. It is made with curry so it has a mild spice to it. Unfortunately there is no raspberry chocolate cheesecake option (only white chocolate which we don't prefer), so we went with lemon raspberry with fudge on the side. It cost a whopping $9.90. The piece was pretty small and wasn't anything to smack our lips about. My wife can make way better cheesecake at less than $10 a slice."
Tyler B.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",52,19,12,5.0,12/12/2014,"Who doesn't love cheesecake factory? Bang, bang chicken and shrimp, crispy chicken costoletta, cajun pasta jambalaya, and the cheesecake... I could go on. Something for everyone here. If you've never been, I recommend it."
Che B.,"Provo, UT",0,25,4,5.0,1/3/2013,Wonderful service and great food. We had the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. So far the best thing I've had at The Cheesecake Factory. Great dining experience. Tons of food for the price. Cheesecake (Adams PB & Chocolate) was to die for.
Brenna D.,"Bountiful, UT",5,73,9,2.0,6/27/2013,"After a 2.5 hour wait, my food sucked and the waitress didn't offer to do anything about it. I took one bite, didn't like it. She asked me how it was, I said I didn't like it and she said, ""oh, okay."" This entree was only chosen after I was told that my first choice was sold out.  My husband's entree, on the other hand, was awesome. Good thing the portions are huge because I ate half of his.  Not worth the wait for sub-par food."
CJ M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,5,9,5.0,4/16/2014,"Thank you for being true to the Cheesecake Factory brand! I had such a bad experience with your Murray location that I stopped going to Cheesecake Factory unless I was out of town. But I had a really good experience at city creek and will continue coming here. Beautiful decor, very different from the others ones I've been to. Excellent service, fast friendly and attentive. Even your curbside to go was great. I've been here a few times and will continue driving all the way here because of it. My favorite dish is the factory combination chicken Madeira and shrimp scampi. My husband loves the steak Diane. Bring back the crispy taquitos please! Great stuffed mushrooms, sweet corn tamales (minus the spicy sauce), orange chicken, banana cream cheesecake, red velvet cheesecake, sourdough bread, fried Mac & cheese. I can go on and on, I love this place!"
Joseph R.,"Lehi, UT",159,37,7,5.0,11/7/2013,"I had a great experience here! The staff was friendly and forthright. As always, the food was delicious. I ordered a drink that was god awful though. It was some strawberry thing that sounded good on paper, but looked (and tasted) like my little pony princess vomit. The manager came over, apologized, and got me a different beverage! All and all I was super satisfied!"
Jessica F.,"Springville, UT",78,10,1,5.0,3/27/2015,"Great food and atmosphere,  we did have to wait a little while before being sat down. Other than that love it here"
