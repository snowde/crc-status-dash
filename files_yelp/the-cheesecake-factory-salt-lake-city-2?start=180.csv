Wolfy W.,"San Francisco, CA",182,346,293,3.0,8/17/2013,"I normally try not to dine at many large food chains if I could help it. But being invited to one, you can't avoid not going but to make the best of it. With a party of about 10, this particular Cheesecake Factory was near a newly builded shopping mall in downtown Salted Lake City. Actually a Very Nice shopping mall in fact. The waiting was average for our party, but we enjoy the out of town guest and in no time, we were seated. I know that almost all entrees are serve in very large portions as well as being high in calories.  I decided to just stay with the small plates and snacks instead. The Santorini Farro Salad was just right as it had fresh chunky tomatoes, cucumbers, beets, red onions, farro and feta cheese in a vinaigrette. A healthy choice and was to my liking. My second small plate I had was Parmesan polenta fries. It was a decent order of about 9 crispy fried polenta sticks. I didn't care for the luke warm marinara sauce. I also just share  different cheesecakes between 4-5 other guest. Overall, not bad service, attentive and refills constantly."
Angie H.,"Bothell, WA",258,184,127,3.0,3/29/2013,"Do you like to read?  The Cheesecake Factory Menu is lengthy...I mean pages and pages of shit.  It's hard to believe that they have a zillion items on their menu, and people actually pay to advertise in the menu.  You feel like you are looking at a magazine, and cannot decide what to eat. I have been to the Cheesecake Factory a number of times, I always order something different...and it's always mediocre.  It tastes as if it's pulled out of the freezer and thrown into a microwave. With that said, they have a vast array of mixed drink options. Today we decided to order a number of appetizers - Crab Artichoke Cheesy Dip, Fried Zucchini, and Firecracker Salmon.  My favorite was the Crab Artichoke Dip.  They rest tasted mass produced and not made ""to order"" My husband ordered a Blueberry Mojito, and our kids both had lemonade. 3 appetizers, a mixed drink, and 2 kiddie lemonades cost around $40.  Not bad.  But, I could have easily picked up a few things in the frozen section of our grocery store, and made drinks at home for less. - And it probably would've tasted better too. No kiddie menus (not with crayons, etc.) - and a 55 minute wait.  For whatever reason I continue to eat here...and I am always disappointed when I leave."
Jake C.,"Morgan, UT",0,6,,4.0,1/23/2016,Awesome food and we had a great waitress she was amazing!! The only reason it is not 5 stars is because the lighting was terrible it was so dark we could not see the menus we had to use the flashlights on our phones to order
S N.,"Pisgah, OH",0,26,15,3.0,12/20/2015,"Cheesecake Factory food is always good. But the waiter ignored me the entire time and directed his attention to my two colleagues. Even they noticed. When the food arrived, mine came out about 20 mins after my colleagues. Mine probably should have been the first since I ordered only a salad. Anyway, the manager came to our table to personally deliver my food, apologized for the delay, and said it was on the house. The waiter still came back with the check. LOL! But my colleagues explained to him since he was ignoring me. I would have given it a 1 but the 2 additional stars are for the manager."
Stuart B.,"Pasco, WA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2015,Service was poor. Moments after we sat down the waitress tried to hurry us to order  without giving us time to look at menu. She stated there was a huge table next to us and wanted to get our order going. Order a salad without tomatoes and a chicken dish. Salad came with tomatoes and chicken was super cold. I let them know and the took it back to heat it up. Instead of new plate they tried to just heat up my plate but was still cold on bottom.  Attitude of staff was poor and food was terrible.
Nathan B.,"North Salt Lake, UT",7,3,3,2.0,6/21/2014,I love the food at Cheesecake Factory! This review is more about the service. I give the service 0 but the food 4 so this is in between. We were seated about 6:45 last night and we honestly didn't have a waitress even talk to us until about 7:15. That's ridiculous. The manager needs to do his\her job and train these kids. I will not return to this location. MANAGER TRAIN YOUR STAFF! I should be asked for my drink selection within a couple minutes of sitting down not 30.
Chelsea F.,"Kaysville, UT",7,2,,1.0,4/30/2012,"From reading the Reviews I knew a Saturday would be crazy busy.  I set it up to show up, Put our name down at 3pm.  At that time I was told there was a 2 and a half hour wait for a table of 12.  I totally get it. Our group showed up at 5:45.  Still not ready for our group.  Even down sized our group from 12 to 7.  We waited for another 45 minutes before we were seated.  Leaving our wait for 3 and half hours.   We sat We decided what we wanted to eat.  We ordered.  1 hour later everyone in our groups food comes.  1 HOUR.  Still leaving 2 people in our group with out food. We had to wait another 20 minutes before our sever showed back up to see how the food was and get the rest of our plates. Which one of the plates were for a Pregnant woman.  You don't come between a pregnant woman and her food.   As we ate we not once saw our server.  The food was amazing.  Our drinks were empty we had to stop the manager just to get water. she finally showed up 45 minutes later asked how our food was and if we wanted dessert.  We ordered a cheese cake and a birthday celebration cheese cake and asked for the checks.  She showed up with the birthday celebration cake and the full cake 10 minutes later (good timing due to the rest of the time was way to long) We then waited for another 40 minutes for our checks.  We almost walked out due to the time it was taking to just get anything.  As we sat there we looked around and noticed tables that were seated after us were leaving before us.  in some cases we even saw tables that were seated for the 3rd time.  We had a prior reservation for 8:30 and we lost that due the time it took there.   I grabbed the manager and told them of how I felt my first experience was there and all he said was Well I wished you grabbed me sooner.   I do not recommend this place at all.  The food might have been great but the wait and service was awful!!"
Chris S.,"Riverdale, UT",0,2,1,3.0,1/9/2015,"A little overpriced, but still a good meal. Only suggestion I could make would be to fix the soap dispensers in the men's restroom."
Trisha M.,"West Jordan, UT",0,1,,1.0,5/9/2015,We were told 45 minutes and we have been waiting for an hour and a half. Saying they gave our table to someone else and we have still be waiting 20 minutes after they told us that. I would comment on the food but I haven't had a chance to get close to it yet. Ridiculous.
Grason R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",150,175,37,2.0,5/2/2012,"I've never been a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I had to try the new one at City Creek. We went on a Sunday morning and decided to get brunch. I was actually pretty surprised with the prices. With a drink we were looking at just over 20 which from what I was used to from their dinners, was pretty fantastic. I got a normal breakfast with eggs bacon and toast and my gf got lemon pancakes. The lemon pancakes were pretty good, but didn't come with anything other than 3 pancakes. My breakfast was nothing to rave about, but it was fine. The server was brand new and had no clue what he was doing. Can't really give him to hard of a time as we all have to start somewhere. I'd recommend trying the brunch if you are downtown on a Sunday, but there are better places in the area."
Scott C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",7,11,7,5.0,6/5/2014,Haters be hatein.  This place is always a classic fall back. Always good. Great Food. Big portions.  Delicious cheese cake. Stop complaining its a good time.  Go early on weekends long wait times!
Phuong B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",24,71,61,4.0,4/6/2012,"Word to the wise...show up BEFORE 11:30 for lunch!!!  I showed up right at 11:30 and was able to get a table immediately.  Within 10-20 minutes the whole restaurant was full with a line out the door!  YIKES! Ambiance --  It looks like every other CF that I have ever been to.  Nice decor, warm and inviting throughout. Food -- I wouldn't say that they have the best food but it is consistently good and pretty quick for a sit down place.  The Red Velvet Cheesecake is always a standout for me.  It is insanely good! Service --  Our server was Jarret and he was honestly one of the best servers I have ever had!  This is a high compliment considering the amount of times that I have dined out!  He was sincere and attentive without being intrusive.  He cleared plates and refilled drinks frequently throughout our lunch.  Bravo to Jarret for doing such a great job!"
Karsten B.,"Dallas, TX",43,71,7,2.0,8/20/2014,"The cheesecake is pretty good, I'll admit. But that's where it stops. Generic chain food in a shiny package. Also, they accidentally erased our order while we were there so that we had to wait about an hour for our food. Luckily we got free cheesecake."
Barbara H.,"Herriman, UT",3,12,,4.0,7/13/2012,Lunch was amazing! I had the avocado egg rolls and a heavenly piece of lemon-raspberry cheesecake!  Tip: Take a seat in the bar area to avoid waiting.
Marlo A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,15,,1.0,12/7/2014,"Do you like tasteless, overpriced food and shitty service? Then Cheesecake Factory is the place for YOU! Run, don't walk away from a potentially horrible experience!:)"
Kerrie C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",86,113,177,3.0,7/29/2014,"I have dined at numerous Cheesecake Factory Restaurants across the U.S. and the service has been consistently good and the food has always been of the highest quality. This location was another fine example of the well-developed Cheesecake Factory brand.  The location of this restaurant was great, right in the middle of the pretty shopping mall and the restaurant itself had beautiful high ceilings and low ambient lighting. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but the weather was nice and we enjoyed a bench near the fountain.  Our server was a top-notch professional who quickly greeted us and took our drink order. Thankfully, we know how large their portions are and skipped ordering an appetizer. Unfortunately, they ran out of salmon so I couldn't enjoy my favorite Miso Salmon dinner, but I stepped outside my comfort zone and was pleasantly surprised by the Oven Baked Herb & Lemon Chicken. I would've preferred a green vegetable instead of cooked carrots but the Mashed potatoes were yummy and our drinks from the bar were really good too. After dinner, I decided to splurge and order the Strawberry Shortcake a la mode and a cup of coffee. I expected a moist slice of cake but it was more like a biscuit topped with berries, whipped cream and ice cream. The cake was a little on the dry/hard side but still yummy. Perhaps I should've stuck with cheesecake, Lol.  This is where things got bad, hence the 3-star rating. I added the cream and sugar to my coffee and used my unused spoon to stir it up. I then took a sip of coffee from the spoon and licked it, only to discover with my tongue, chunks of dried food on the spoon!!!! YUCK!!! I politely told the server about my surprise discovery and his reaction was honest and professional. He acknowledged the problem and immediately apologized. I asked for a new coffee and he promptly returned with one, along with the manager who also apologized and offered anything to rectify the situation. I'm really not one to try and get free stuff or discounts unless something is really really bad, so I just accepted the apology and finished my coffee. The server returned and once again apologized, and seemed visibly upset about the whole situation. He said that if it were him, he wouldn't have been as nice as I was.  He returned with the bill and said that he just couldn't accept my reluctance to ask for compensation, and in order for him to feel good about it, he insisted on at least comping the dessert. What a nice gesture.  We enjoyed our dinner and the truly professional level of customer service from the server and management, but I guess the dish washing and table setting staff members need to pay closer attention to their jobs.  Thanks to this experience, I will now closely inspect my silverware before digging in at any restaurant."
Dana D.,"Tyrone, GA",117,37,26,4.0,9/25/2014,"Great service, great choices,  the Cajun pasta was awesome and enough food for multiple people. Cheese cake is a must have although you will prob take it to go"
Deano G.,"Farmington, UT",135,569,124,3.0,7/11/2012,"WOW...a ton of negative reviews....  But as far as chain restaurants go... I liked it.   The food did come out a little slow, but the server informed me that they had a party of 75 upstairs and it was taking a little longer that expected.  We didn't mind, we had time (and the manager did come over and inform us as well). The crab cakes could have been cooked just a little more (not crispy enough).  The pasta was yummy and I am glad that we have a cheesecake factory closer to my home. It won't be a destination restaurant for me, but when I'm kicking around the mall it will always be one of those places I consider... just because you know what you will get..."
Scott R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",69,404,11,3.0,3/24/2014,I think I have just burned out of this place a long time ago. I really don't like to wait for an hour or more just to eat at a chain restaurant. But you really can't go wrong with one plate of food that could feed a small family. I will never understand anyone that eat a huge piece of cheesecake after that much food. But you can definitely get it to go. I am sure I will be back at some location.
Frankie C.,"Joshua Tree, CA",171,208,30,5.0,7/6/2014,"This CF is on par with the chain. If you like CF in general, you will not be disappointed. Wait staff is top shelf!"
