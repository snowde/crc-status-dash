Bryan C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",7,2,,2.0,12/15/2013,"Pros: - nice atmosphere - good location - open Sunday Cons: - parking difficult on Sunday - service was delayed My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory culminate in epic failures on the most basic entrees. This experience ordered fried Mac and cheese balls, they had a burned fry oil taste. The entree fet Alfredo was lacking any flavor (butter, garlic or cheese).  However the cheesecake was excellent."
Lisa F.,"Alameda, CA",0,62,398,4.0,7/21/2014,"First of ALL, I want to say that the managers were SUPER accommodating and was soooo nice to cook my son's special metabolic diet food for us both days (thats priceless). Our other children's food that we ordered were PERFECT both times. However, my pasta was still half raw not cooked yet the first day, of course they comp that dish, but it seemed as though our server didnt care for us, I had to take my pasta togo because it took soooo long for new pasta. (My husband's burger was cooked pefectly). On second day, my husbands chicken burger was soooo burnt, he couldnt eat it. Our Server didnt care much about us, they did finally cook us another one but forgot the sauce to FLAVOR the Chipotle chicken burger (hahaha). He ALSO took his burger togo, because it took sooo long (even though resturant was empty). But, all in ALL, the kids were happy, they DID cook my son's special food for us (much appreciated) and THE avocado rolls were super yummy. Still 4 stars. ;)"
Mr V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",26,49,23,1.0,4/5/2012,"Called for take out and was put on hold for 10 minutes.  Called back and was once again put on hold for 8 minutes.  Called again and told them I had been holding with no answer, and the girl walked over to the bakery to let them know someone was holding.  Finally placed my order.  Received a call back 2 minutes later and missed the call.  Tried calling back to see if everything was fine with my order and they once again put me on hold for 8 minutes.  Called AGAIN and asked to speak to a manager and was on hold for ten minutes.  FML."
Deb D.,"Park City, UT",460,315,1132,3.0,4/3/2013,"Generic.  Formulaic.  Same in all Cheesecake Factories.  Decent and plentiful food portions.  Pricey slice of cheesecake.  You know what you get before you  go in, and I guess that's good.  Not a place for gourmands or those wanting an epicurean experience.  More for younger crowds wanting to go where younger crowds go."
Christopher M.,"Manhattan, NY",130,153,40,3.0,6/19/2012,"This place is good, they have good food. They also sever cheesecake it is not just a creative name. My big issue is they make their waiters and waitresses wear white shirts. When serving food all day I cannot imagine the stress of worrying about all my tables, the kitchen, and staining my shirt. It is too much. However if you are looking for a good place to eat it is a good choice.Eat the egg roles you will love them."
Chuck M.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",51,112,69,2.0,7/4/2012,"Very nice decor, poorly run.  The hostess was quite full of herself.  They told me it would be a 20 min wait.  I was fine with that, so my cranky daughter could run around outside for awhile.  They called us in 5 minutes...  And made us wait by the hostess stand for 10 minutes, with 7 other parties, ""waiting for tables to be bussed."". Meanwhile, my daughter was screaming.  Stuffed mushrooms were dry, server was good.  The food was just mediocre.  The Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks, CA spoiled us, I guess...  Much, much better."
Jesse F.,"Everett, WA",73,224,9,4.0,5/16/2012,"Just stopped in for a slice of the original cheesecake at the dessert bar. Friendly service, restaurant wasn't too full, and cheesecake amazing!"
S T.,"Saint Louis, MO",18,202,228,1.0,11/18/2012,"Not wasting my money here again. Service was so slow it was insulting. It's a MONDAY night. Orders were wrong. Took forever to get acknowledged by sever, even longer to order food, get food, get the wrong food and wait for a new order, try to get a drink refill, try to search for server, wait 20 minutes for a check, LEAVE! Ugh. Seriously, I'd rather order my food at a checkout counter and pick up my own food. Cuz you know I didn't leave a good tip on this shitty visit. Ugh."
Clark P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,11,,3.0,3/10/2013,"Updating review. Months later I tried the chiliquiles  again and they were adequate. I will apologize for being so hard on him the first time Previous review: I used curbside to go today,  and ate a few bites and threw it away =Chiliquiles=. It was obvious the man didn't know how to assemble them"
Coco L.,"Irvine, CA",292,292,71,5.0,8/17/2012,"Love, love, love the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish- Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Absolutely amazing. Now if I am trying to be good I go with the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad which is also amazing and a very generous portion (my husband and I usually split it). The new location downtown is fantastic because it has a lovely outdoor patio - perfect for the summertime."
Mars A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,22,3,1.0,5/9/2014,"I indicated that I wanted seating for eight. I was told this was a large party and that I would have to wait for a manager to ""negotiate"" for a table. We were kept waiting for nearly ten min (while five other groups were allowed into the queue, one which was for six people) until she arrived at the front and promptly ignored us. When she finally saw fit to acknowledge us there was no apology for the wait she simply curtly asked if there were any children. When I indicated no she replied one min and began ignoring us again. We walked out and were promptly and politely seated at Brio moments later."
Andrew N.,"Bedford, NH",12,3,,1.0,10/7/2013,"This place is over rated. I've had three meals at three different locations and I've always been disappointed. The food is over priced and the service is marginal. I never complain about food when I eat out and have never sent food back, but I did this time and I will not give this chain a forth try. They have struck out with me."
Justin C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,1,,1.0,10/23/2012,"It was a nightmare! The service is good, but the food is intolerable! First, the shrimp scampi was deep-fried, my first-ever deep-fried shrimp scampi! And shrimp was not processed well, it tasted like shit still inside. For desert, I ordered tiramisu, it came with Five cream flowers, Five! They are much bigger than tiramisu itself. For tiramisu, the lady fingers were soaked up, probably because it had already been made millions years ago."
Jeff T.,"Pocatello, ID",1,4,,5.0,10/11/2012,"Love this place! The cheesecake is soooo good! You can walk in to tables they have set up, seat yourself, and get a piece of cake!"
Heather B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,11,6,2.0,7/16/2012,"I like the location and ambiance but every time I come here I leave disappointed in the food. It's just not that good. This is the place to go for a late-night cheesecake and coffee, but the entrees are entirely too bland."
JT V.,"Ogden, UT",1,4,,5.0,4/5/2014,"This place was great! The food was great, the service was great, the environment was great. They were taking a little longer than usual on my meal so they gave me a complimentary soup. Then 2 minutes later, my meal came out and that was complimentary too! I'll definitely be back!"
Beann P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",50,85,178,5.0,8/31/2013,"I have to say that I have never been disappointed in this place! I went about a week ago for a friends birthdays dinner at the Murray location and now came to the City Creek for my own birthday dinner with my husband and son! We were seated fairly quickly on a busy Saturday afternoon and the patio view was perfect on a cloudy, but warm day! The waitress was super nice and friendly and we received our orders in perfect time. I always order the avocado egg rolls appetizer cause with the tamarind-cashew sauce they are just to die for with the perfect amount of flavoring. I also love the ahi tuna tartare which has the perfect mix of tuna and avocado with wonton crisp used as a chip. My husband got the hibachi steak which is made up of certified Angus steak and shiitake mushrooms, onions, bean sprouts and wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus will make your Mama drool! To celebrate my old age, I decided to take to-go the Blackout Chocolate cake with a side of Carmel sauce because it has almonds on the outside and I must say I was impressed by how rich it tasted! (And it was a huge slice to share!) love this place!!!!!!!"
Boom P.,"Layton, UT",5,75,12,2.0,6/18/2012,Didn't care that there is always a wait for tables. Cheesecake a bit pricey and didn't care to much for it some to sweet and the price for one eh... I can go to Marie Calenders for better cheesecake! An okay restaurant! Cheesecake was a small serving!
Grace S.,"Santa Clara, CA",22,187,35,3.0,9/18/2012,"I enjoyed my first visit to the City Creek Cheesecake Factory. We ate lunch here around 1:30 pm on a Saturday and there was a 20 minute wait. The server was slow to take our order and slow to bring our check, but the food came quickly and it was prepared well. I enjoyed the cold summer rolls which contained shrimp and asparagus in a rice wrapper as an appetizer. I ordered Sheila's cashew chicken salad (lunch size) and it turned out to be a very large portion. I wish they used more salad dressing, but the quality of chicken strips was very fresh and tasty. I liked the amount of cashews in the dish. My husband ordered two excellent alcoholic beverages--a mai tai was his favorite as it was large and boozy. The second drink, a margarita, was ok but the mixer tasted of artificial lime powder. I enjoyed a strawberry lemonade, which was decent, but nothing special. My husband's entree, the lunch-sized shepherd's pie was too salty. Tasted like it was made with french onion soup mix. We took home half and diluted the leftover with more potatoes so it was more edible. Otherwise, the ambience was nice and we enjoyed the outdoor seating on a warm fall day. Also, beware that Cheesecake Factory does NOT validate parking."
Priya K.,"Alpharetta, GA",5,109,,3.0,7/16/2013,Typical Cheesecake factory fare. Quite a few veggie options. The veggie burger was OK but fries were quite good.
