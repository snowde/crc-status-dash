Tom B.,"Suwanee, GA",0,51,3,1.0,7/20/2012,"Visited SLC on business recently, and a group of us went to the cheesecake factory for dinner. What a horrible experience that turned out to be! First off, they bought 2 of us at the table, the wrong order, and then when it was corrected, I found a rotten lettuce leaf in my salad! I pointed it out to the manager whose response was, ""Well it's only the tip of the leaf that was rotten"". Really!!!!! What about the rest of the salad I had already eaten! I don't normallt go to chain restaurants like that....and certainly wont be going back there at all!"
Fern H.,"Pocatello, ID",0,13,,1.0,8/11/2013,"Factory food is so accurate! Everything here looks and tastes like it came from the factory to the microwave to the table.  The ridiculous menu is too long; a give away that almost everything is prepared somewhere else and re-heated on site.  Frozen TV dinners probably taste better and cost  a hell of a lot less.  Trying to avoid the microwaveable menu my wife and I ordered egg dishes for lunch.  Her omelet looked like ""something special"" from the Costco frozen foods section, only it wasn't as good.  My huevos racnheros also had the unmistakable  texture and taste of a frozen meal.  The over easy eggs might have been cooked on site but the corn tortillas went straight from the package onto the plate and the black beans tasted like they were over microwaved and turned into rabbit pellets.  Our son-in-law had a pizza that was obviously underdone.  Service was marginal.   Never again."
