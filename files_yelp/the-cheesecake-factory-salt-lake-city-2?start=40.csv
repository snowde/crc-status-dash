John H.,"Holladay, Salt Lake City, UT",0,11,2,1.0,3/7/2017,Eating here right now and the service is AWFUL!! The hostesses were rude and non-communicative. Definitely not a great first impression. Then the waiter has the personality of a grinch. I wish I could ask for a new one.  I wouldn't come back to this place even if it was free! Too bad because it's my daughters b-day. What a HUGE disappointment....
John C.,"Sandy, UT",405,613,3994,4.0,7/25/2015,"Lots of negative reviews, we must have came on an off night. The server was awesome, so attentive, drinks, appetizers, meals all came out very fast and tasted delicious. We even got some cheese cake to go. I think I like this location better then the one at Fashion Place mall."
Nhi P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",182,17,22,3.0,7/27/2016,"Went on a date here. We usually wouldn't go to places like cheesecake factory, because honestly, the food is only decent but greatly overpriced. We only came because my boyfriends mom gave us a $50 gift card. If we didn't have the gift card, we'd most likely not eat here. It's just not worth it for us.  It's supposed to be a fancy restaurant with amazing food, but my food has never been more than just alright, at any location.  What I do love about this place is I've always had good service, and my Pina colada is always consistently  delicious.  The restaurant's appearance doesn't please me. It's too dark."
Jeffrey E.,"Fairfax, VA",0,53,9,4.0,7/21/2017,"Had lunch here with my wife. We are regular customers at our nearest CCF back in Fairfax, VA. Seated promptly. Ordered the raspberry lemonade. Even with the sugar coated rim it was too tart for me but my wife liked it. I switched to Coke. We split the Lunch Green Salad with mixed greens, tomato and cucumber. I love their balsamic vinaigrette dressing. She ordered the Chicken Bellagio one of her favorites. It was perfectly prepared. She took half home. I ordered the lunch spaghetti carbonara. A little more saucy than I like it but tasty. We were so full we skipped dessert. Will go back."
Cheri E.,"Rose Bud, AR",20,19,82,4.0,5/28/2017,Food was very good. 7 people in our party and we each had a different cheesecake and they were all delicious. The only issue was the homeless gentleman sitting next to us who kept begging for our food.
Edwin A.,"Glendale, CA",0,47,71,4.0,6/10/2017,"Really long wait even after the buzzer went off. Even people after us were seated before us. This is such bad service. Someone should look into it. Manager change possibly? Update: so initially I gave one star, however I think the employees are just having a hard day. Let's bump this up to 4 stars and give them the benefit of the doubt. Our waiter seems like a nice guy."
Bryn M.,"Midvale, UT",8,72,14,2.0,4/10/2017,"I used to be a fan of this restaurant, especially for a chain. My last few experiences here have been disappointing enough to want to write this review. We went around 8:30 on a Friday night with a larger group (5 adults and 5 kids, two of whom are smaller). We were told the wait would be 45 minutes, which makes sense on a Friday night. We told the hostess we had a party of 10 and needed that to include two high chairs. They gave us our number and we waited....and waited.....and waited. Finally after an hour an a half we asked the hostess how much longer it would be. She told us we were getting close and that a certain party had to leave before we could be seated. All this would have been fine if the service and food had been decent. When we were taken to our seat we were short both chairs and high chairs. The person seating us said our booking had been listed for 8 people. We told him we couldn't all sit and he shrugged and walked away. We had to flag someone else down who told us we couldn't scoot the open table next to us over because they were about to use it. They wanted all 10 of us to sit around two four tops scooted together. We finally were able to get someone to allow us to move the additional table and then they had to go pull two high chairs out of a storage closet to get our kids seated. The waiter then brought us water and we ordered drinks. He shorted us a water for one of the kids so I asked him for an additional water and we ordered drinks besides that. We had enough time during the seating wait to know exactly what we wanted to order, but it was almost another 25 minutes before he brought out the drinks and bread and at that point he still forgot the water for the kid he missed in the first place. I asked him for it again and we were able to order our food. We were on two checks and just on our check we ordered well over 100 dollars worth of food (more like $150). Of that only one of the dishes was even half decent, which was the Buffalitos. We ordered factory nachos and they took so long to come out that the entire plate was soggy and cold. We also ordered Chicken Bellagio and one whole breast was nothing but fat and gristle. There was also some weird colored fat on the prosciutto, which is usually quite good. The worst of the meals was the Factory Burrito. It was old and dry and tasted like it had been made and then sat for hours under a heat lamp. The food took so long to come out that this could have been sitting for a long time. The others who were with us also ordered Apple Juices for their kids which came out after two reminders and once we had ordered dessert. The cheesecake itself we took to go because it was so late. The 30th anniversary was half frozen and put into the wrong container so that it was completely squished. Overall what should have been a fun night out that we saved to splurge on was stressful and disappointing. I actually contacted the restaurant directly about these issues before posting my review on yelp. I wanted to give them a chance to respond directly, but this was the second time in a row we've had a poor experience and I haven't heard a word back despite reaching out."
Veronica S.,"Centerville, UT",8,2,,3.0,7/2/2017,"I got a slice of the Chocolate and hazelnut cheesecake. It was really good, especially with the Nutella on top!  My California cheesesteak was instead really really dry...I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. The place is nice and elegant, but I think that they are really overrated and overpriced. $27,87 for a piece of cheesecake and a cheesesteak?!?!? C'mon..."
Alex D.,"Provo, UT",96,96,44,4.0,4/17/2017,"Great! Service was good, atmosphere is fun, and the meal is always yummy; I think I get something different every time I go, and I'm always impressed with what I ordered. AND UM LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE CHEESECAKE. The best around town. I am a huge fan of the white chocolate raspberry and their peanut butter one. Seriously y'all, it is the best. It's fun to just go for dessert or both dessert and dinner. But mostly just dessert;) My only complaint is the times I've had reservations, they hardly ever seat right you at your reservation time. When I check in 10 minutes prior to my reservation, often I still have to wait 20-30 minutes from that check in point. So make sure you reserve earlier than you think you'll need, especially if you have somewhere to go after! It's also nice that's it's so close to Temple Square and other popular destinations in Salt Lake. They validate City Creek parking!"
Dubs Y.,"Mercer Island, WA",109,74,149,5.0,4/27/2017,"JEN thanks you for all tips where to hang out, cause I can't hang out here all night with you. Awesome service. No bar but you can go down to the high tables without waiting in line for 1 hour"
Justin D.,"Magna, UT",14,51,31,5.0,9/15/2016,There is something for everyone. No matter what you want they have a little of everything. They excel at cheesecake but don't forget the fried mac n cheese. Easily the best food they have. Tuxedo cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake.
Cody B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",12,84,38,4.0,4/11/2017,The chicken Parmesan sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever partaken of!  This place is pricey - but a good change every once in awhile.
Charlie L.,"Roseville, CA",245,249,273,5.0,12/1/2015,"This visit was probably the best experience we had. My family was visiting Utah and we decided to play it safe with dinner. The wait on a Saturday night was 65-85 minutes. Thankfully I suggested we eat at the bar area since it's first come first serve. Our waiter Ron is the highlight of my review.  Ron was very professional,  observant,  and had a great personality. We enjoyed his jokes and his suggestions.  The hibiscus lemonade was ""off the hook"" as Ron said. During the service he made sure all our drinks were filled. He checked on us when we were eating and also had time to share a few things about himself. We can not wait to go back to cheesecake factory in utah! It was definitely worth the long line."
Jessica T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,21,4,5.0,4/9/2017,We went for dinner before a concert and had a great experience! Our meal was delicious and the service was exceptional. The restaurant was extremely busy but our server McKay was very attentive and friendly.  We placed our order and a short time later found out that the kitchen was having trouble with one of the ingredients in our dish. McKay was very nice and explained it to us. He gave us some great options and even Discounted our meal for the trouble. He was one of THE BEST servers I have ever had. We'll definitely be back. Thanks for making it a great evening.
CJ M.,"West Valley City, UT",1,89,105,1.0,12/26/2016,"My last two times dining here have been terrible. This location is going downhill fast! I wish I took a picture of our food, the portions were so small! It was pathetic. AND our waiter was the worst, very bad at his job! I need to call in about him, because I did not get his name. I used to love Cheesecake Factory, but now I will have to stay away :( I am sad about this, but I guess now I can explore other restaurants instead of always choosing this restaurant first."
Caspere L.,"Singapore, Singapore",8,169,356,4.0,12/15/2015,"We were visiting Temple Square, dropped in to have dinner. The Q was 20mins and the dinner took a little while to arrive. They have good crowd in there.  We ordered the Herb crusted salmon, pasta chicken scampi, and a meatball spaghetti. The salmon is slightly plain, but the pasta chicken scampi was surprising good. The 3 meatballs were pretty good.  On the whole experience, the food was good,the service was prompt and cheery. The price is reasonable for the location and ambiance."
Kent M.,"Clearfield, UT",0,5,,2.0,8/31/2017,"Disappointing chicken n biscuits... biscuits over cooked, skin on the gravy and a crunch on top of the mashed potatoes.  Flavor was ok but the strang part was the server kept reaching over the wall"
Fred N.,"Midvale, UT",0,12,,1.0,4/15/2017,The most awful place to go to.  The host was rude and dishonest.  I do not recommend you to go to the city creek location.  It is not the same experience I had in fashion place. It was much better experience.  I will never ever ever come back.  I wish you chapter 11.
Daniel M.,"Draper, UT",0,1,,2.0,4/14/2017,"TL;DR  *Service 5/5 *Atmosphere 4/5 *Food 1/5 This may have been my last time. Went last night. My date and I came hungry. In fact we planned on going to another restaurant but the power was out in their area so we decided on the Cheesecake Factory. *Service was great, 5/5 We arrived a little after 8pm and despite seeing several large groups waiting in the lobby they were able to seat the two of us in just a couple of minutes. Our waiter was there when we needed and allowed us space to talk and eat. *Atmosphere was good, 4/5 Our placement wasn't the greatest but I can't complain. It would've been nice to have a little more room between our table and the other patrons. The dim lighting was on the dark side, but I can see that they were setting it up to be more of an intimate dining experience. *Food, 1/5 The free bread before the meal was better than the chicken carbonara. Before I ordered I asked our waiter to weigh in on a couple of dishes I was deciding between, they recommend the chicken carbonara. The presentation was bad. Before I even tried it I could tell it must've been sitting in the window for 20min. It's possible this was ordered by someone else and sent back. The dish lacked flavor, was stale and old, lukewarm at best, and extremely oily. Even if the food had come straight from the kitchen it wouldn't have made up for the lack of taste. Nothing about the food was fresh, from the pasta to the peas. *Wrap-Up I've been several times before, generally with a big group. Usually I'm excited to go back and try something else, but this time I left thinking it was my last. It was bad enough that after getting home I hunted for food from the fridge and cupboards. What happened to the quality of food? Where did the freshness go? Where are the spices and flavor?"
Rick And Julie B.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",149,111,4,1.0,12/3/2016,"Two hour wait and I can't  order a cocktail... No bar and can't order from anyone to make the wait a little more enjoyable. Yeah, will never ever come back here."
