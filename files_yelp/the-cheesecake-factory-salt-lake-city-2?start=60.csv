Nettifer W.,"Bountiful, Salt Lake City, UT",47,331,812,4.0,5/30/2016,"We love this place. You can't go wrong with anything you order plus hello the cheese cake is awesome. We only give it 4 stars because of the price. We feel like it is a little over priced. But we love it so much we keep going back. This time we got burgers. Americana burger, skinny licious burger which I love everything on the skinny menu and 2 kids meals. We shook it up a bit and got a chocolate moose cheese cake instead of the Godiva one."
Malanie L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",386,116,132,5.0,9/3/2015,"Probably say this TOO often but this place is at the top of my list. If you know me, I like plenty of options and this place offers quite the variety. First time at the City Creek location.  They're pretty busy during lunch time.  Outside dining is an option on a nice day just like the Murray one.  We were a group of about 15 but the service was still quick and attentive.  My choice was the Bistro Shrimp Pasta ($18.95). Holy, flavors.  Shrimp was small but great.  Spagettini noodles, Mushrooms, basil, tomatoes, all included.  The sauce was a basil-lemon base which I really enjoyed.  Something I would definitely order again.  I've tried almost all of the pasta dishes they offer and I don't remember disliking any of them.  Chicken Piccata and Chicken Bellagio are also some of my favorites. Don't forget to end your meal with a cheesecake!  It's a generous slice of sweet-goodness. I usually go for Red Velvet or Dulce de Leche.  They also have no problem with packing it for you to-go."
Kate S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,2,,2.0,4/1/2017,I've been to this location multiple times and I'm always disappointed. Tonight I order curbside to go. Ordered an appetizer and the shrimp and angel hair pasta. Was about 5 minutes away when they called me to tell me that they were out of the appetizer and offered to make something else which was nice. I get there and food is ready. I get home to find out the pasta was way over cooked. I decided not to suffer through it and I had to make dinner. Looks like I paid 18 bucks for 5 pieces of shrimp and some bread. This was the last time I tried this place. The quality of the food is not worth the price. Gave it two stars because the girl working there was nice and helpful.
Shareen K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",265,244,80,4.0,9/10/2015,"I really like the location of this restaurant, minus the parking!! I don't know anyone who likes to park in that area,right?!  The customer service is always great at this location, I have always had a great experience at this location.   Food wise, I am a big fan of the Chicken Little's, although the portion they put is not so little, but who is gonna complain about them putting too much food...NOT me!!! Leftovers are great!!  I have tried different pasta dishes that they have, and I wasn't wowed, but the chicken little's always wins with me. The chicken is cooked well, yet moist which wins a lot of points with my belly. haha"
Nichole D.,"Lehi, UT",126,108,180,1.0,4/8/2016,"I am sorry to do this but I feel it has to be said. This was one of my worst dinning experiences I have ever had. My husband and I went to this Cheesecake factory with his parents and man did things go horrible awry. First off, I want to point out that we are big fans of the Fashion Place Cheese Cake Factory (will review later) so we have come to expect a level of service from this franchise. Our dinner started off with an extremely long wait to be seated (to be expected at any Cheese Cake Factory) the major issue was the fact that the restaurant was not very active the night we were there (Sunday). After finally being seated we were shoved into what seemed to be the back of the restaurant. The lighting at our table was extremely dim and we were hardly able to read our menus. All things up to this point were forgivable.  Things went terrible down hill when our two year old son was playing with his drink. The cup he had seemed to lose its integrity as he was drinking it and decided to give way all over the table (not there fault). Dripping with drink we began to try and scramble to find some type of help from the service at the restaurant. This is where our nightmare continued. After many failed attempts at gaining the attention of multipule waiters and waitresses. I decided to ask the help of a waiter and his response was that he would come immediately after he finished the table he was working on. But after completing the table he completely forgot the promise he had made and even after our attempts to draw his attention he acted as if we were invisible. After he left I tracked down a bus boy who finally came and helped us clean up our table. Next, I feel because we were stuffed in the back of the restaurant our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us. He never seemed to come and check in on how things were going and even after we complained about our lack of drinks his remedy was to bring each of us triple drinks to make sure we were satisfied (which took up to much space on our table and created a new problem with our two year old) the best part was he brought us the wrong drinks.  Lastly, the time on the food took an exuberant amount of time longer than expected. Normally I would plan on one hours worth of time but our food took double (solidifying the feeling that we had been forgotten). I know that there is more that I have forgotten but I truly have to give this Cheese Cake Factory a thumbs down. I will not be returning. I recommend you save your money or make the extra drive to Fashion Place."
Lucy G.,"Orem, UT",236,78,68,4.0,4/4/2016,"I don't like paying $30 for a meal, but it was for a birthday dinner. I decided to splurge and get the orange chicken dinner ($16) and Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake ($8).  Service: We had to wait awhile for our whole party to arrive, but our waitress was very patient in filling our drinks and bread while we waited to order. Overall we were there a little over 2 hours - 30 min waiting for our party. About 90 minutes waiting for food, eating, getting to-go boxes, getting the check, and paying. I'm not sure about the procedure for getting to-go boxes. but we all could have done it ourselves. It took awhile for our waitress to package up 6 meals. I think she did fantastic job making sure our drinks were full and checking to see if we needed anything else.  Food: I didn't expect to have 3 meals on my plate.  The chicken was crunchy and flavored fantastically alongside a huge scoop of rice (option of white or brown) and veggies. There was literally 3 servings on my plate. I ate as much as I could that night. Then had it for lunch and dinner the next day! I usually opt for a pasta dish at Cheesecake factory but I heard the Orange Chicken was good so I gave it a try. NEVER GOING BACK. It was definitely the best meal I have eaten there."
M David M.,"PINE VALLEY, UT",128,4,1,5.0,2/6/2017,Other than being a popular place with a little bit of wait at times we loved the experience and the food and had great service.
Grace H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",584,487,380,2.0,7/22/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most overrated restaurants. If you are going simply for the cheesecake, there is no better place to go to. If you are going for dinner, there is a plethora of better options downtown. Any restaurant that has a nearly 20 page menu can't do any of those dishes phenomenally (except of course their cheesecakes, I've had many and all have been excellent). As far as actual food, this place is very overrated. None of the entrees I've had have been that great. They do have some really good appetizers though. The Asian lettuce wraps are really good, but messy. I also really love their grilled artichoke. I always get the artichoke to share with friends when we go here because my friends seem to think this place is really great, so we go here with a certain level of regularity. I came here the first time ever on Sunday for brunch. I ordered the brulee french toast. I will say that that was done very well. My service on Sunday though was not great. My server kept the water full, but he was not a good listener when we asked for things and he didn't take my leftovers to box them like they always do here. When my boyfriend took me here for my birthday, our server was phenomenal, so it was frustrating not having great service on a very slow morning (think, it's City Creek, which is closed on Sundays, so not busy at all), compared to the very busy night we went a few months back for my birthday dinner. If you have a large group with different tastes, this is a good place to go because they have everything, but nothing is top  notch here (except the cheesecake)."
Ryan S.,"Morgan City, LA",38,20,5,5.0,1/22/2017,The chicken madeira is exceptional. With all the variety of food on the menu I wish I could try everything but I feel as though I am cheating on perfection if I choose something else!
Jesse S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,39,,2.0,3/8/2017,"Everyone raves about this place, but it's not that great.  The service isn't that good - when my shrimp came out it was frozen, so they brought me out some more shrimp that was just nasty.  I'm not going to lie, some plates are delicious.  I just think it's over-rated."
Tom W.,"Midway, UT",115,48,34,4.0,4/8/2016,City Creek Cheesecake factory has great food. Enjoyed their service. My daughter cannot have gluten and it's frustrating trying to find a restaurant that works for us. Their menu is great for that. It shows all the Gluten Free items.. Great choice for us!
Kevin P.,"Ogden, UT",4,85,18,4.0,6/26/2016,"Great selections on the menu. Food was good, I got the Fish & Chips and my wife got the Chicken Avocado Sandwich. The fish was cooked well, but the breading was pretty greasy. More so than what I've had at other places.  The White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake was great. My thoughts summed up: Good place to eat, maybe $2-3 overpriced per plate. But I'll definitely go again."
Randy E.,"Makati, Philippines",96,34,138,5.0,6/30/2016,"This is one of the nicer Cheesecake Factory restos out there. Staff are nice and courteous even if they're not the ones assigned to your table. Food is excellent. I had a burger with mushrooms and it was delicious. Appetizer salad was huge. Fish taco was yummy. I like how it's not dark in the restaurant during lunchtime. Bathroom was super clean, too."
Leanne A.,"Milton, FL",145,222,119,4.0,5/10/2014,"I think the cheesecake factory is delicious. Their bread is soft and tasty and every cheesecake I have tried has been to die for, my favorite is the lemon raspberry. Every meal I have had had been good, not out of this world, but really good. My favorite is the chicken bellagio. The raspberry lemonade is also one of the best drinks I've had with free refills. We have always had great service!"
Erika E.,"Smyrna, GA",43,181,6,3.0,10/31/2016,"When you have been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all, but I did have a nice dinner experience here on my last night in Salt Lake City.  All of the staff members were polite, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time given it was a Saturday night, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  I would visit this Cheesecake Factory again if I were in SLC."
Michael N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3,5,1,2.0,7/27/2016,"Wife and I go to this place occasionally. As an European I must admit it is one of the better restaurants with an wide variety of choices. One day my mom visited and we thought it will be nice to introduce her to the cheesecake factory. She had a good time, until the moment came we asked for the bill. Well we all know how tipping works. Tipping is an American culture. My mom did not understand that as well waitresses really want tips. The point of this is. That out waitress got into a discussion, educating an very smart intelligent person. That she need to tip because that is how they survive. I was so embarrassed for they way my mom got treated. Please don't get into discussion that you need to be tipped cheesecake factory, that is very low behavior.  Hint: we did leave an tip, but much lower we planned after that incident."
David T.,"South Jordan, Salt Lake City, UT",51,16,,1.0,2/16/2016,"This is by far the worst cheesecake service I have ever had and possibly the worst dinning experience ever.  Waited 15 minutes for a table on a Tuesday night no big deal. Waited another 15 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge we exist. Still no big deal.  Finally ordering. My partner 23 ordered a blue moon and he has a HI drivers license. The waiter examines it quite thoroughly and hands it back saying thanks and ""I'll be right back with your drinks.""  Cut to 10 minutes later the waiter returns saying that he needs to take my partners id because he honestly has never seen a Hawaii dl and his manager now has decided they need to verify his id. We hand him the id and he disappears.  Add another 5 minutes on that when he returns to tell us he is sorry it is taking so long but his manager is verifying the id in a book because she needs to make sure it's not a fake id.  I then at that point told him ""No! no she don't. Go get the damn drivers license now we are leaving."" Not 2 min later here comes the manager with the id. I honestly couldn't make out half of what she said but something to the extent of ""what's the issue here? I'm the manager"" I told her there was no issue and asked her name as I gathered our belongings to leave. Fire this person now because she is costing you business.  We had before tonight eaten at cheesecake often. This was the last straw I don't believe that we will be returning for some time."
Louis M.,"Panaca, NV",1,17,4,5.0,12/12/2016,"Went on a Friday night close to Christmas.  Fagettabout the Line.  Way too long of a wait.  I hear it is typical on the weekends at this location so we went elsewhere.  Since we were staying at a hotel at City Creek we tried again on Sunday.  One of the only restaurants downtown that was open.  No line!  We were seated promptly and had a great server.  The meal was to die for.  I had steak and chicken that was incredibly delicious. Mashed potatoes oh soooooo good.  You can't leave the place without having a slice of cheesecake.  The best on the planet!  Server, Gabriel is outstanding!"
Stephen L.,"Boise, ID",233,193,1324,4.0,3/28/2014,"We only came here for the desserts after shopping in the City Creek mall. The location is nice, which is very closed to the mall and when we came, we requested to seat in the bar, as we're only getting desserts. The waiter provided us with bread and butter, which is OK and serve our drinks. As I came here before, I knew that their ""Deuce de Leuce"" (something sounds like this, basically, it is caramel type) cheesecake is delicious, so I ordered this ... we also added with Tiramisu cheesecake. We like the caramel one better (5 stars) ... it is just tasty & delicious while the Tiramisu-one is average (3 stars), nothing really special. Their service is good and attentive, she made some short conversation that entertained us."
Angie L.,"Long Beach, CA",31,424,2762,3.0,7/19/2015,"i went shopping with my mom at city creek and she was getting hungry so we came here for lunch.  i was worried it'd be packed at lunch time, but surprisingly we were immediately seated.  it's a large restaurant and they also have outdoor seating which is nice.  our server was okay and i wasn't too impressed.  i felt like he was rushing us the whole time and he didn't come back to check on our food.  he also brought our bill out immediately without even asking us if we wanted dessert or needed anything else.   the food itself was okay.  we got the guacamole and herb crusted salmon salad to share.  the guacamole was okay and there was no kick to it at all, very mild.  i don't even like spicy, but this guacamole was boring and very bland.  it needed at least more lime juice.  the salmon salad was also just okay.  it was a good portion for two people, but the flavor didn't really stand out to me.  vinaigrette dressing was too oily and we didn't even finish our salad.   overall i'd skip this place next time.  there are lots of places to eat downtown and next time i'll convince my mom to go eat outside of city creek."
