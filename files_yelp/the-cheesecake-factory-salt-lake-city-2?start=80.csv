Gregory R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",25,1,,4.0,12/21/2016,"Very good service. We had a party of 26(ish) and they were all very attentive, and we got our food (allacard) very very quickly. They even put my ice cream in a separate to-go container so I could eat it then and for easy accessibility. Very,very good and friendly service."
Sandra R.,"Alameda, CA",0,17,8,3.0,11/6/2016,"We went to dinner with friends and always enjoy the decor and atmosphere is fine, except it is always crowded and loud.  Make sure to request a booth as the tables are so close to each other it would be hard to have a halfway private conversation.   Our server was pleasant and attentive.  The menu is so extensive and they were able to accommodate my special requests with food choice.  I think for the price, there are many other local restaurants that deserve your business.  But after a day of shopping with the family or a few friends, this is a good choice.  Just go early and put your name in as a typical wait time after 6pm is 45 min on the weekend."
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,3.0,4/10/2016,"I've been to Cheescake Factory so many times, I've lost count.  This, however, was my first visit to the Salt Lake City downtown location at City Creek.   As with all Cheesecake Factory's, the setting is nice, the food is good and the overall experience is relatively positive.  I would have to agree here too; however, the service here was below average.  Overbearing waiter at first and then he disappears.  Some things forgotten (i.e. dressing with the salad).  Service issues could definitely be addressed here. Also, minus a star for discontinuing the Salmon Genovese on the menu....that was my favorite thing!  I can't believe they got rid of it.  Bring it back now!!"
Quinn N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",229,115,142,2.0,4/30/2015,"The food is really low quality at such price, aweful customer service and i still have no idea why some people like it."
Andrea B.,"Lahaina, HI",6,12,1,3.0,8/19/2016,You can always count on cheese cake factory to do all the things right. Staff at this location is always really nice!
Katy B.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",31,157,11,5.0,12/24/2014,"I've been here three times and love it. I didn't have high expectations, since I felt like it was probably overhyped. True, it's pretty dang expensive ($15-30 per person, not including drinks or dessert) and the wait is often bad but the quality of food has made it worth it on special occasions. The chicken and biscuits are my favorite, but also loved the steak diane and shepherd's pie. (Get something with mashed potatoes, because they're great here. And trust me, that is not a recommendation I usually make.) There are SO many choices, I'm not sure you can go wrong. Well no, I take that back. Though I haven't had anything bad, the artichoke dip and raspberry lemonades were both forgettable. The main dishes, however, have yet to disappoint. Portion sizes are massive and your caloric intake will be through the roof, so plan on getting a doggy bag.  I'm not typically a fan of cheesecake (which is bizarre, since this place is called the Cheesecake Factory) but this place does it right. I honestly just stick to the original, plain jane cheesecake, so I can't vouch for the others, but it was really good. (The first time I got it, an employee scoffed at me for not being more adventurous and it was kind of rude, but that was an anomaly in otherwise pleasant service.)  My only other complaint is that it's pretty dark in there. The guy next to me was using his cell phone as a light to be able to read the menu. It's annoying in Hollister and it's annoying in a restaurant, too. Overall though, five stars. If you have plenty of time and a wad of disposable income and you're starving, go here."
Cassidy J.,"Orange, CA",161,327,573,3.0,11/3/2015,"I have eaten here more times then I would like to admit...and I have had so many different experiences.  I will just start by saying that for the most part the food is always decently good. I had the best lettuce wraps I have had here one time. I also had one of the worst cheesecake factory salads I have ever had at this location.  But what has been really hot or cold has been the service.  On a recent visit our waitress was hardly a waitress at all. It took over 10 minutes for her to come and introduce herself or give us water. After about another 10 minutes, she came by again and said ""Sorry I don't have any time I have other people I have to help that are very needy"" so... maybe the Queen of England was also there and we were just chopped liver compared to that? Not really sure what that was about because we were paying customers too.  OH WELL. We finally ordered. I ordered a lunch size chicken salad... well they brought out a huge salad and I asked if it was the lunch size and the girl who brought it out assured me that it was the lunch size. Well they forgot the dressing, and it took another 5 minutes to flag down a worker to get dressing. So okay I was a little upset but I got over it. The salad was fine, nothing amazing. I have had better at other locations. Well fast forward to the bills... and they had charged me for a full dinner salad. I told my waitress I only had a lunch, and she said that they gave me a dinner size. I protested and said it was unfair to charge me for something I didn't order. She eventually agreed and only charged me for the lunch size, but it wasn't without a big hassle and without her making me feel like I was the most demanding person in the world. I really just wanted to pay the price for what I ordered. So that experience wasn't good.  BUT the next time I came a few days later, I had one of the nicest workers serving me ever. He was so attentive and checked on me the perfect amount of times. He made sure I always had water and that I had all the things I needed. I had the mushroom chicken lettuce wraps and they were simply delicious, fresh, and a great deal. It was about a 100 times better experience.  OVERALL..... I mean I think the food is pretty good or I wouldn't keep coming back. It isn't the best food ever, but it is open late, and there is a huge menu so it pleases pretty much everyone you come with. I just have trust issues because of the variety of experiences I have had here."
Thérèse HC W.,"Draper, UT",105,97,569,3.0,1/3/2015,"I would say this is a very decent place for a chain. Great atmosphere, good food. However, this place is always packed, so I recommend you to avoid their busy hours. I went here on a Saturday noon, waited for about 10 min for the table. What I don't like about this place is that the space between each table. It seems to me it's getting narrower each time I came here. The service were pretty slow that day, it seemed our waiter had forgotten us from time to time. That's why I didn't give it the fourth star.  I got the lunch pasta-Evelyn's Favorite, and lunch favorites- Famous Factory Meatloaf. The pasta was a bit tasteless at first, without chewing with the sundries tomatoes, it was flavorless. The meatloaf was enjoyable. It was tender and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I love how they put onion on top of the meatloaf to bring out even more flavor. We ended our meal with the Limoncello Cheesecake. It wasn't as sweet as the other. I always think that their cheesecakes were too sweet, but this one was unlike the rest, it had a freshness taste in it. I would recommend this cheesecake to those who want something lighter than regular cheesecake."
Craig M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,9/1/2016,Vomit in the urinal. I watched a table stay dirty for 15 minutes after guests got up. Male host was incredibly rude. I left.
Bryan J.,"Layton, UT",27,118,5,2.0,9/15/2016,"For almost $90 for three of us I would have liked the meat (Black Pepper Chicken/Shrimp) not overcooked and fried plantains to be plantains, not bananas. (The sauce was tasty.) And the Steak Diane not to be served overcooked (from med-rare level requested) with a proper dijón-forward Diane sauce--not a derivative of a basic mushroom wine sauce. And the third dish (Asian-style fish) we ordered was so-so. Maybe I'd try again if just making a dessert visit. We liked both cheesecake styles we tried. (German chocolate with vanilla layer and macaroon crust; and a mango key lime.)"
Kelly J.,"Charlotte, NC",0,29,1,3.0,5/6/2017,"big portions, mediocre food. nice staff, had us wait for a table even though the place was empty at 5pm on a Sunday! I can't believe they use plastic cups for water, cheap plastic mugs. come on, I'm paying $17 for an entree. good cheesecake of course."
Stephen K.,"Ogden, UT",0,7,,5.0,4/1/2017,"Just love the cheesecake factory went there yesterday to city Creek in Salt Lake. Very glad they have valet parking, just wish we had one up near Farmington Utah"
Julie E.,"Spanish Fork, UT",1,4,,1.0,10/6/2016,Wow talk about bad service. Our waiter checked on us once but checked on his buddy sitting at the next table about 20 times. Never got a refill on water or bread and waited 20 minutes to get our check. Oh wait we didn't we had to snag him when he was talking to his buddy and just give him our card with no bill. Talk about ridiculous
Angela H.,"Sandy, UT",27,17,,2.0,10/6/2016,"Food was great wait was awful. We were seated quickly, but wait for our food was almost an hour. Then another hour after we were done eating to get our cheesecake slice (which was to go by the way) and ch"
Monica V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",661,516,1252,3.0,10/23/2015,"As much as I love to support local restaurants, sometimes I just can't help going to a mega chain like Cheesecake Factory. Don't judge me. Is it worth the 30 minute wait? Not really... But when you're feeling kind of basic, the ahi tuna tartare small plate is always a good go-to dish for me, and the cheesecakes are always yummy. Plus, their vast cocktail menu is full of fruity and deliciously sweet options if you didn't get enough pina coladas on your last vacation."
Jack G.,"Moses Lake, WA",27,3,5,1.0,5/19/2016,"I normally love Cheesecake Factory but our experience at this one was maddening. We went in at about 4:30 or so today (Thursday). We had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though it was not busy at all. But that was no big deal, it was only a few minutes.  After being seated in an area where the were no other customers we waited for a server, there were plenty around and, like I said, it was not busy at all.  Anyway, we waited...and waited...and waited to be at least acknowledged. But nope. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Tried to politely get someone's attention, but it was like we were ghosts.   I'm usually pretty patient but this was ridiculous. As I said before, the place was not busy, there were plenty of servers walking around or chatting with each other. If someone would have at least acknowledged us in some fashion, we wouldn't have been so infuriated.   But we were.  Finally, we just got up and left, mentioning that we had been ignored.  No excuse for such bad service."
Curtis C.,"Lehi, UT",162,429,81,2.0,9/14/2014,"It's average food, way overpriced, and way too busy to wait in line for.   Seriously, has anyone seen a wait under an hour?  Even on weekdays it's awful.  I'm not sure why the long wait either.  The food is decent, but not great.  Obviously the selection is good, but if you can narrow down your selection then pick one of the local, non-chains that have way better food for less of a cost and no wait. I don't know what else to say.  I guess if you've still decided to go, go for the Chicken Bellagio dish.  The Factory Burrito isn't very good.  Cheesecakes are good, but when have you seen someone mess up a cheesecake? I would take any local place around the town over this, and maybe some gelato for desert.  You can do both in less time than it will take for you to get a seat here."
Ty B.,"North Salt Lake, UT",0,10,3,1.0,1/20/2017,"We have gone to this Cheesecake several times and not had too many issues. We like the food and the Cheesecake is an obvious. We haven't ever had amazing service though and tonight was the straw that broke the camels back. We were waiting in line to sit in the self seating bar area behind 2 other couples. One of them got a table after about ten minutes. The couple in front of us continued waiting for a while. Then we noticed 2 girls that had walked in front of us all and looked like they were going to sit in the bar area so the gentleman in front of us let them know that there was a line for the tables and they told him that the restaurant had told them there is no line and that it was first come first serve. I then stepped in and explained that yes it is first come first serve but we were all there before they were. They said they weren't looking for a fight and it was ok. When a table came open the couple in front of us beat the girls too it. So the girls sat at a table where two people had not even stood to leave yet. I asked the girls to allow my wife and I (who were holding a baby this whole time) to have the table because as we discussed earlier we had been waiting for a good half hour longer than the girls had. They refused to move and told me to talk to the restaurant if I wanted anything to be done. So I talked to a server who basically said tough shit to me and I asked for the manager. Manager came out and said although he agreed it wasn't right that the girls did that there was no way for him to ask them to wait and that the ""corporate"" policy was whoever sat in the table first got it. I asked if he really wanted people acting like animals to get tables and he said no but there is nothing he can do about it. Preceded to tell me how I was in the wrong and when my wife realized they were about to kick us out for ""making a scene"" we ended up just leaving. The management could have done a much better job and should have some sort of ""line"" for the area they are going to let patrons self govern. I never thought they needed that before because I didn't realize people would be so indecent but manager acted like it was normal and happened all the time."
Natalie H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,15,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"Ok first off, I understand that super big restaurants like this can get super busy especially on the weekends. Me and my husband came in on a Saturday night at about 7 knowing it would be crowded, they said it was about a 50 minute wait and we were totally fine with that. We went shopping, came back 50 min later, and they sat us around 8:15. Our waiter was HORRIBLE....I get that it's busy and a weekend, but cmon put in some effort girl. She took about 10 min to even come give us some water, we ordered, food came about 30 min later and my rice was not cooked at all and the chicken was pink. So I waited about 20 min for her to come check on us and I returned the meal and got something else and yeah just overall really bad service."
Eileen W.,"Melbourne, FL",38,54,12,2.0,9/5/2015,"I try to avoid ""chain"" restaurants when on vacation; but a member of our party wanted to go here, so I caved in.  And was so sorry later.  The best part of this place was the personality of our waiter; however, when the fried shrimp I ordered came out BURNED, he said ""Yes, I saw that coming out"".  Okay, if you saw it, why did it come to my table.  After it was taken away, I went to the restroom and the others in my party said the manager came and offered a soup or salad complimentary.  Thank you, but no, I wanted shrimp.  By the time I got it, the rest of my party had almost finished their dinners, so I didn't finish mine.   This just reaffirms why I avoid chain restaurants."
