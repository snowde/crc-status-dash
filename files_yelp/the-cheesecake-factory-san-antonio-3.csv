Rebecca L.,"San Antonio, TX",145,135,87,4.0,12/12/2017,"Every time I ate here, it was someone else's choosing... So this time it was my bf choice since he had never been here before. I was dreading it because of all the bad experiences I had for getting mediocre food from this chain restaurant.  It was Saturday night, super busy. Since it was just him and I, we were able to sit at the bar to eat very quickly. My bf got the fried fish tacos and I got the orange chicken. My gosh, both were so amazingly good! The fish tacos had so much flavor in every bite and was cooked perfectly. I noticed it was on other lists online for best dishes to get at this restaurant.  Of course the cheesecake is always the best! We got a caramel one to go.  If you order the right things, this place is actually really delicious. My bf loved it for his 1st time."
Jerry M.,"Boerne, TX",252,145,77,4.0,11/8/2017,I have eaten lunch here three other times and still haven't made it thru the menu. The food is so good I'm determined to get to the last page. I started with onion rings that are freshly made and will blow your socks off. They feed four of us   I ordered Orange chicken and wife ordered Truffle honey chicken. My chicken was fried perfectly with crunch on the outside and tender juicy on the inside and so flavorful. I may not make it thru the menu an just order this time after time. I would eat some right now if I had it.  The truffle honey chicken was devoured by wife and her brother who left his club sandwich on the table after trying hers. We all had a very enjoyable brunch. We will go again. See you there.
Shannon B.,"Olympia, WA",3,52,54,5.0,10/23/2017,"Everyone was super nice! From the hostess, our main server (Shelby), those who brought out our food, and everyone else we encountered.  We were greeted promptly and Shelby was really attentive. He made sure we had everything we needed and went above and beyond for my son. He brought out bananas cut up in a shape of a butterfly for him!!! Ask for Shelby if you're here! He's kind, efficient, and attentive. Great server! Our food came out at a normal time and was piping hot. The chef even made sure to change out my son's hot plate so he wouldn't hurt himself. It's this type of detail that keeps me coming to the same restaurants. Food was great as usual! Great experience. Will return again soon!"
Peter S.,"San Antonio, TX",17,63,153,4.0,10/19/2017,"Firecracker salmon rolls $12.95  These egg rolls were so good. Crispy wrapping perfectly portioned to the salmon filling. The sauce was sweet and salty. Unfortunately, it's so expensive for the amount you get. Four half sized rolls on shredded purple cabbage bed. Very aesthetically pleasing.  Fried calamari $12.95  Too breaded for my taste. Just a standard calamari. Portion was a bit better.  Louisiana chicken pasta $17.95 The chicken was made perfectly. Nicely breaded and moist. Sauce was too oily, but I still enjoyed the dish. A lot of color and flavor.  If you don't have to ask for a water refill, then the service is spot on. :) Although, there needs to be some work on friendliness. But that's just being nit picky. Love the brown bread over the white (maybe sourdough?) that they give while you wait. The white is too hard."
Viviana G.,"San Antonio, TX",34,141,233,4.0,10/15/2017,"We came Friday for a late lunch around 1pm.  We sat in the bar area which was not busy. We were served by Nicholas who was so helpful, sweet, and attentive to not only our table but all of his. He helped guide us with our choices since the menu is so large. We had the egg roll appetizer which gave us 2 of each. We shared the spicy chicken chipotle entree small portion was just enough for two. The sauce was actually way too sweet that we had to add a lot of salt to balance it. We ordered the Chris outrageous cheesecake to go. It taste exactly like an almond joy but much more rich.  Sharing appetizer, entree and cheesecake between two people still had us very full.  We a had a wonderful experience and would be back but order a different pasta next time."
Sandra V.,"San Antonio, TX",38,88,95,4.0,11/30/2017,"After shopping around al La Cantera, we decided a cheesecake was in order. The factory does not disappoint! The establishment is clean and the customer service is is great! Our server was chatty and friendly making some good recommendations and making sure our drinks were filled throughout the meal. We shared the pizza salad meal and finished it off with a slice of turtle cheesecake. We enjoyed every bite and didn't even feel guilty- since we still had a long walk back to that car."
Ashley W.,"New Braunfels, TX",11,52,82,4.0,1/1/2018,"Meet up with family  for a new years dinner. There was a bit of a wait since they don't offer reservations. That being said, the wait wasn't ridiculous-maybe 15 min. The service was really good considering the crowd. Bar drinks were made well. Had the Long Island. Ordered Steak Diane -med rare- and it was fantastic. The beef was very flavorful & tender. Hubby ordered the Hibachi steak however after  sharing a bite, his was noticeably tougher &I wasn't impressed with the overall flavor. Finished things off with the turtle praline cheesecake. Great evening!"
Nora G.,"San Antonio, TX",7,79,5,4.0,1/1/2018,"Today I had lunch here and boy was it busy!  I hadn't been here in over a year mostly because there is always a ton of people and I have to wait about 45 minutes every time.  Aside from that,  the food is pretty good.  I normally order the meatballs and spaghetti plate.  It is pretty tasty and the bread that they bring to the table is delicious.  My friend ordered an omelet with bacon,mushrooms, cheese, & spinach with a side of potatoes.  He was not disappointed with his meal.  I would like to go back but for Sunday brunch because they have something on the menu that sounds scrumptious.  I can only imagine that it is a popular, busy time.  My one complaint about this place was the bathrooms.  Both the men's and women's were dirty. Plus I strongly dislike that in an establishment this size with this amount of business that they only have 2 freaking stalls!!!!"
Parsa Y.,"Northwest Side, San Antonio, TX",8,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,"I had three times of visit there two of which were extremely awkward by seeing giant cockroaches crawling on the ground. That place should be called ""Cockroach Factory""."
Alexis A.,"San Antonio, TX",42,107,438,4.0,10/19/2017,Cheesecake Factory has a new cheesecake--Celebration Cake! It was very good if you like birthday cake flavor.
Vanessa K.,"Shavano Park, TX",206,18,4,5.0,12/11/2017,Had the pasta da Vinci and lettuce wraps. Everything on the menu is good and they are always consistent.
Paul P.,"San Antonio, TX",53,499,2051,4.0,6/23/2017,"Update: June 23 Anna was cute but she was so absent. Also, Anna, when a customersays ""thank you,"" say ""you're welcome,"" not ""no problem.""  Our food was DELICIOUS! Honestly, if America was competing in a world wide competition for best chain from each country, we would send Cheesecake Factory.  My Cobb salad was huge and so satisfying, definitely worth the $15.50 price tag.  The burger was delicious also.  The servers appear stressed out and nervous.  Also, the glass case where they keep the cheesecakes was not very attractive with so much condensation on the glass.  They should have wiped it clean before guests arrived.  My previous five star review from 9 mos ago: This location is better than Park North. It is larger and more accomodating. Parking is so ridiculous at Park North and the place is overrun with hoodrats. So I went the extra distance to La Cantera because I had a sudden urge for a big salad and Cheesecake Factory has one of my faves, the Cobb. I also ordered a medium well filet mignon which we shared. OMG the filet was outstanding! Completely did not expect it but honestly one of the best filets I have ever had, up there with Flemings and Capital Grille! I do not generally eat mashed potatoes but one bite and I was hooked. They were so good and you could taste the freshness of the potatoes with chunks of well season tater goodness."
Gary C.,"Bothell, WA",0,13,,5.0,12/31/2017,Just a great place to eat. Most everything on the menu is tasty and the portions are generous.
Didi M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,47,24,1.0,10/11/2017,Came for my birthday lunch.. great avocado rolls... delish.  Great service but they've gone way down  with their food.   I Ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken .. yuck!  White rice was hard and stuck together like a sheet and had a odd flavor...sent it back and ordered their world famous meatloaf... ugh that was worse. It tasted like the sauce from the dish I had sent back. I was also given two ends.  It was rather disgusting.. it was the two left over ends from the week before!! not world famous they advertise.. see picture... does that look like meatloaf???? Not!!  Of course their cheesecakes are delicious so probably will come here for only  dessert!
Julianna B.,"Dallas, TX",149,42,74,4.0,11/5/2017,"We came in on Sunday around 11am. We were seated immediately for a group of 6 and a baby. Our waitress can quickly and was attentive. We took a little time deciding on what we wanted to eat since they just started their brunch menu. I had a mimosa and it was pretty strong, just how I like it. After we ordered we got our food pretty quickly. I ordered the brunch combo and substituted the pancakes for French toast. I was a little sad that they ran out of the brioche French toast even though they just opened. Everyone enjoyed their food. The eggs for me were a little under scrambled and the bacon was cooked to a dark crisp. My mother had one complaint that she requested no scallions in her omelette but it was filled with scallions. Overall we had a good experience and the food tasted amazing. Since this place is very close to my parents house I'm sure we will be back again."
Pinkey P.,"San Antonio, TX",273,49,56,1.0,7/16/2017,"After building up an appetite at La Cantera windowshopping, a friend and I decided to come by and have a few appetizers due to our love of avocado rolls. Bad decision, should have just gone to BJ's at the rim. The avocado rolls we received were cold and not crispy at all and the dipping sauce was not on par this time.  Due to this, I decided to order some ranch and the ranch was also extremely sour and tasted like it had gone bad. We also ordered the spinach dip with chips and salsa, and the salsa was more like a pico de gallo, which is fine except it was extremely watery. Ther server was not there and she only came to take our orders.   Overall disappointed with this location... why you gotta fight with me cheesecake? I love to go there"
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,950,1677,4.0,3/21/2017,My husband and I came in one night after dinner to get a dessert to go. At 9pm there were people everywhere waiting for a table. I heard the hostess say it was an hour wait. Lucky for me there was just a short line at the to go counter. I ordered the smores cheesecake. They have a board that lists all of the cheesecake flavors along with price and calorie count. Dont expect to find one under 900 calories (so worth the extra time at the gym). We waited less than 2 minutes before our cheesecake was out.  Overall a great cheesecake. There was melted marshmallow over the top of the cheesecake. It was very rich. I only managed to eat about 1/3 of it. But it was amazing. With tax the total came to around $9. The cheesecake slice was pretty big. Plenty for two people to share!
Adriana G.,"San Antonio, TX",133,311,268,4.0,3/4/2017,"This is my second time to The Cheesecake Factory, the first time I went was during my birthday. I recently came to celebrate my friends birthday which by the way if you tell your waiter it's your birthday you get a free cheesecake any kind! Since we went on a weekend the wait time was about 15 minutes but it felt longer than that. We finally got seated and our waitress was very friendly and helpful when ordering. We ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which you can share because it is a huge plate and ordered a shrimp bites appetizer. The food took awhile to come but it came out hot and fresh. In fact so hot the crust on the chicken was falling apart! As far as appearance and cleanliness goes, it is very clean and they take pride in that. Waitress took awhile to come back and forth checking on us."
Anastasia H.,"San Antonio, TX",179,287,165,3.0,4/4/2017,"Sooo my food review is slamming, but my overall experience was not 100%. Our waiter was really nice, and patient to wait for our fourth party member, but he was not attentive to drink refills and I only got more water as I asked for my check ( my first refill).  I had wonderful, tastylicious tamale corn cakes which were slathered with sour cream, pico , and avocado. They were soooo moist and tasteful on their own I will order with sour cream on the side to not hide the deliciousness of the cake it self. a friend let me try a slice of her eggplant parm, and it was thick and hearty cut of eggplant with a thin lair of breading and drizzle of sauce- I would reccomend BOTH for the veghead and meaty alike.  Like always their bread was warm and served with butter. Which my table devoured.  Outdoor seating at this specific location is very nice ( may not during the heat of summer but oh well- ill enjoy it while I can)."
Tuan T.,"Dallas, TX",694,282,200,2.0,4/1/2017,"I came here on a Saturday around noon and was seated promptly. There was not a wait as I expected but the place looked spacious and packed. The restaurant seemed very clean and had nice decor and furniture for dining. The bar area looked quite classy and had a lot of seating available. A little early for drinks right? We were seated and the waitress shortly came by after. She asked what we wanted and I got 2 water with lemons and a diet coke with lemon ($3.00). She brought by the diet coke with a straw but I was surprised not to get any or be even offered straws for the water. I know its kind of picky but its the small details which reveals how your going to be served. I also asked my waitress on any recommendations which she listed some things off really fast but her menu knowledge was really lacking. I understand the menu is huge at this location, but at least recommend me a few favorites of yours unless she doesn't eat the food here which says a lot about the place. One of my big gripes was that every other table got their bread with butter and we didn't. I got a tab of $50 dollars in the end after 2 cheese cakes and 2 entrees. I was disappointed of how the skinny chicken pot pie came out. It was kind of soggy although I didnt really express my disappointment to the waitress. I don't really want to be the guy that complains unless I am really offended. The cheese cakes came out pretty decently which is why I bumped up this place to a 2 star. If it wasn't for that, I'd give it a 1 star because the sandwich, soup and salad I got also known as the Renee lunch special was not that fantastic especially for a whopping price of $13. The Renee special which allows you to either get a turkey or chicken salad sandwich, soup which I didn't get to pick or was told what kind of soup it was and either regular garden salad or a dollar more for the Caesar which I opted for. The soup was okay, which was a cream of corn with a little bit of bacon. I've had better soup while on a Navy ship. The sandwich is something I would ever crave or desire again and the salad was really less than spectacular. It lacked flavor and any amount of salt and pepper I tried putting on it didn't help. I was less than impressed with this Cheesecake factory especially with it being my first one.  Overall: I already heard bad things about this chain and my visit here only confirms it. It disappoints me more than ever since this chain is from my home state of California. Do not recommend is the final verdict."
Grace L.,"Austin, TX",151,218,1542,4.0,3/23/2017,"This location is fabulous! Had so much fun shopping with my daughter at thus beautiful La Cantera outdoors mall and being able to stop in for lunch here. Great part of town, next to Six Flags. Actually dropped hubby and little ones to play so we can have some big girl time.  Food is fabulous as usual. Started out with yummy house bread. Love both their hard sourdough and soft brown bread. This time we shared an appetizer of fried mushrooms, avocado and zucchini. It was so filling. But oh so good.  I had to order my usual spicy chicken sandwich with sauce on the side. I love their sandwiches here because they gone with the best crispy thin fries. Otherwise I would order dishes :) We were so full. Their portions are so big always. Worth the higher dollar amount. Highly recommend this location. So convenient for fun shopping dinner or lunch break! Courteous waiters and not overly crowded like other locations."
Anthony H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,3,1.0,9/25/2017,First let me start off by saying when you think Cheesecake you think hmmm how could this be bad? We'll let me say that for one the food menu has way to many items on it which only proves that there's nothing fresh it's all frozen! YUK! The food was horrible and the service was way to slow we received our bread with appetizers. I think the only thing that was fresh was the cold beer I drank. My wife had the mai tai and it tasted like a 11 dollar glass of simple syrup. You would think that at least the cheese cake would be delicious right? Frozen!!!. What sad is people keep coming in this place so nothing's gonna change until y'all wise up and learn what fresh should taste like. Thank you for your time.
Gerald R.,"Alexandria, VA",15,23,4,4.0,11/13/2017,Carla was my. She was amazing and made my first time Cheesecake experience everything. The people at the door didn't say bye to me on the way out. Hurt feelings...but the experience there was nice. Food was good. I don't eat meat..the veggie burger was great. The fried zucchini was AMAZING!!!!!
Ashley T.,"San Antonio, TX",64,11,6,2.0,9/12/2017,"Everything started off good with the fried macaroni appetizer but everything went down hill from there.. for almost $18 I expected a better looking plate than this. I mean look at all that grease in the middle  Chicken was dry, green beans were over cooked and very greasy, and mashed potatoes didn't have much flavor. This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory and it will be the last.. very disappointed.. only giving two starts cause of the service and appetizer"
John T.,"Manchester, CT",0,10,4,3.0,9/11/2017,This place has great food and desserts. There's a huge selection on the menu and lots of delicious cheesecake to choose from. I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich and my girlfriend had the orange chicken; both were delicious. The service was great as well.  I give it a 3 because the seating was really tight.
Chris S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,28,1,1.0,6/20/2017,"So disappointed in this visit at this location as I have dined at Cheesecake Factory's from coast to coast and this was the worst experience I've ever had with the chain. Lucky for them I've had enough experience to possibly try another location in another state. I will say that this poor experience was greatly do to the poor service by our waitress who seemed to be bothered by my party very presence. She did listen or pay attention to most of our orders including but limited to asking for water with lemon slices.  The was no smile to be had and again, the visit was a disaster. My Son comes in to town to have dinner with his dad and this made that matter infuriating!"
Lady R.,"Austin, TX",10,270,79,1.0,4/8/2017,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, We preordered five frozen whole cheesecakes. When a small lady came out with them she carried the boxes on their side and slammed all of them on the counter All of the crusts to the cheesecakes were cracked or completely broken off. Dents were also in the Cheesecakes. Completely disappointed for spending a couple hundred dollars on something your servers completely did not care about.  So disappointed."
William S.,"Port O'Connor, TX",0,5,4,5.0,8/3/2017,Just got appetizers but so far our server Jennifer is freaking awesome! Really understanding with my wife who is not at all decisive!!
Stephanie B.,"San Antonio, TX",86,36,62,4.0,6/16/2017,"My youngest daughter's favorite restaurant. With a cheesecake for every taste, it's hard to choose! We decided on Salted Caramel which was decadent. It was similar to Dulce de Leche. The large interior shows a ""modern rustic Italian"" type decor. Sitting in the bar area made talking a little challenging due to the echos and noise. The water feature in the entry/front door is impressive. Nice options on the "" skinny"" lunch menu. I recommend the chicken salad sandwich."
Melissa S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,59,22,4.0,7/31/2017,"Let me start off with how I love this restaurant. Came here today for lunch and ordered my favorite BBQ chicken salad. The lunch portion is HUGE! My son ordered Pepperoni pizza off the kids menu and let me tell you, the kids pizza is pretty big and it was delicious. I also love their pumpernickel bread with butter.  Today, the restaurant was still doing half off cheesecake, so of course I had 2 slices of our favorite Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake Togo. My server (Mr. David) was also very nice and always made sure we didn't need nothing else."
Utauk2me P.,"Arvada, CO",0,2,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Everything here is usually very good. Ordered a steak med-we'll and it was sent out charred. It was bad.  I would NOT recommend you get steak.  Otherwise, the service was great."
Janice K.,"San Antonio, TX",0,41,,2.0,5/2/2017,Very disappointed. Both of us each got appetizer. Mine was 4 little triangles that taste like pizza rolls 6.95. His was 11.95. Worst meal I've had in ages.  Wait staff was awesome. Very very expensive. Won't go back. Save your money.
Randy E.,"Monroe, LA",62,3,5,3.0,7/28/2017,Food was delicious and server was the best... waiting was long due to high demand for cheese cake
Michelle M.,"San Antonio, TX",160,131,397,3.0,2/11/2017,"This place knows their crowd - everybody! Not sure that's the excuse for the excessively long, small printed menu, yet the options can be overwhelming. On the other hand, they have a variety of cheesecakes. The garlic, cheesy bread was great, yet the two dips that came with it lacked any real favor. The avocado egg rolls were good, yet not great. The dipping sauce was on point, yet the actual ""avocado"" portion was gross processed gauc wrapped in a delicious, crispy wonton shell. Thank God for dipping sauce. Soon the meals came out, yet not before two very poor renditions of ""Happy Birthday"" or whatever celebration song the staff sang. A New Orleans Jazz Funeral would have had more pep than the flat, uninspired vocals that announced that a birthday boy or girl was among us. Just before the meal, we all agreed that if they attempted to sing this cringeworthy song for my sister whose birthday we were celebrating, we would politely decline (and we never faced the awkward decision). The meals came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, my sister - the Crusted Chicken Romano, and my hubby - the New York Strip. His plate was stripped like a sad casino showgirl - so much lost potential. On the other hand, he said the steak was perfectly cooked. My sister loved her Chicken Romano, yet took half of it home since the lunch portion was huge! I did the same with my Chicken Bellagio (which I just finished eating 6-7 hours later, without heating, and it still tasted fabulous!) Let's get to the part where this place really shines - cheesecakes! My sis opted for Red Velvet (her personal fav). My hubby went healthy with the low carb cheesecake with strawberries. We learned it's made with Splenda. I opted for the Fresh Banana Cheesecake. I attempted to finish it, yet I was full from the meal and most of the cheesecake. Are they the best at customer service or singing? Heck no, yet they know how to close the deal on a meal - with the Baskin Robbins of cheesecakes. It's always packed, and most people I know love this place."
Carol B.,"San Antonio, TX",70,33,4,5.0,9/26/2017,"My friends and I try to go here about once every three months or so!  Never, ever been disappointed!!  Today, Monica was our server and was great!!  If I could give more than 5, I would!!"
Alex C.,"San Antonio, TX",92,37,8,3.0,3/21/2017,"I've had wishy washy service here many times. For instance, one time we visited and just wanted to get a few appetizers and some slices of cheesecake. Everything was going smooth until the cheesecake part. An hour before close they kept telling us they were out of a variety of cheesecakes we kept choosing and they weren't going to get another one out etc. After saying we'll just go get ice cream somewhere else instead of doing cheesecake the waitress left to go get the check and came back saying the cheesecakes we were wanting they had just found one slice of each (random...). That whole ordeal took longer than it should of, yes we ended up ordering the cheesecake but we haven't been back to this location since, and probably won't. Service just isn't up to par with what you expect from Cheesecake Factory."
Shaylyn C.,"San Antonio, TX",2,8,,2.0,8/1/2017,"Very disappointing experience last night.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to locations all over, but this is the worst experience I've had at one.  I gave two stars because the food tasted good, but the service was a mess. It was during national cheesecake day so it was very busy, and our server was obviously flustered and seemed new.  She did not have familiarity with the menu, and when I asked for a recommendation between two items she didn't know what I was talking about.  I have celiac, so asked for GF bread along with the bread basket.  They brought it out 10 minutes later, still frozen.  I ordered a pasta dish as my entree, with GF pasta, and when they brought it out there was regular pasta mixed in with it.  I'm glad I noticed, or it would have made me seriously ill.   They brought me a new dish, and my husband was already done with his meal before they brought it out.  The server did nothing to make up for the mistake. Those with celiac should be careful- clearly the kitchen is not being cautious about cross-contamination."
Adrian B.,"Irvine, CA",173,7,1,5.0,9/4/2017,Monica was great! We got a few drinks with the Ribeye. Get the caramelized onions on the steak!
Rebekka P.,"Maumelle, AR",0,9,16,4.0,4/25/2017,"Great atmosphere. Truffle butter chicken was amazing. The rib eye was a little over cooked, but didn't have much flavor regardless."
Patricia V.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,3,4.0,9/11/2017,Great food and service as usual. Had a late lunch here on Saturday. 15 min wait so had a drink at the bar. Quick service and drinks were very tasty. Sat outside since it such a pretty day. Ordered garlic shrimp dish from the skinnylicious menu. I would definitely get this again.
