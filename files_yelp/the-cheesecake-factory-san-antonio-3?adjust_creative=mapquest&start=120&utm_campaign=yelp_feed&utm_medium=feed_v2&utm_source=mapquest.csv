A R.,"Victoria, TX",0,15,,5.0,9/8/2016,Red Velvet cheesecake is to die for!! I've never had a bad dish at The Cheesecake Factory. Love this place!!
Hollyanne S.,"San Diego, CA",947,297,211,4.0,6/24/2014,The location is great. I love this shopping center. The portions here an fantastic.  Prices... you need a shiney penny..very shiney. The wait staff was very friendly. We just ordered cheesecake and drinks. The cheesecake was seriously amazing.. so rich and creamy. The bar drinks were decent too.
Billy W.,"South Padre Island, TX",3,4,1,1.0,7/19/2015,"The food was not great, but the service was awful. They came out twice to tell as sorry, then came out to tell they had to recook something. We got done eating and wanted deserts, but could not get the waiter to helps us. I will not be coming back."
Maggie W.,"Dallas, TX",420,136,460,4.0,10/17/2014,"Service was a little slacking, but you could tell she was new.  Food was great as always!    Love that there's no wait for lunch."
Donna H.,"San Antonio, TX",123,258,317,3.0,5/13/2014,"What's to say... Their menu is huge and portion sizes are extravagant. I could do w/o a text book of choices, it makes it difficult to choose anything.  I always take home leftovers... I ask for to-go boxes as we order our dinner. I get some strange looks but I don't care. I can't eat 2 lbs of meatloaf plus 3 cups of mashed potatoes.  Wait times are hit or miss. Go on a weekend and expect an hour or more... Duh. Go on a weekday and you shouldn't encounter more than a 30 min wait. They do move swiftly though so you probably won't have an actual hour wait.  Staff is decent - typically friendly and prompt with drinks/food... It's just so busy we feel rushed to eat and pay.  They are okay for a chain- husband went for his first time and said ""they should stick to their name"" (hinting that they should only do cheesecakes)."
Samantha S.,"Saint Louis, MO",238,77,60,2.0,7/15/2015,"It's been almost 2 weeks since I've been and I still can't get over how bad this service was! The ONLY reason it is getting a 2 star is because I love this company. Every location I go to; doesn't matter if it's in STL where I currently live or in NJ/NY when visiting family.  The food is always good.  Now let me tell you about this visit. Honestly this was the worst service I have ever had. We paid our bill and went across the street.  We were on vacation. Talking about moving out there within the next year. We were at 6flags earlier that day then stopped by to do some shopping. (He had showers at the hotel so we're in cute dinner clothes. We didn't come straight from 6flags) anyways.  Most reviews were negative towards the host. However all 4 of them were welcoming and friendly. One day us at a little two top. We waited almost 10 minutes before a server came and we both asked for water for now. We both had a headache. Probably from being in the sun all day.  I wanted a cocktail but she had someone else drop off the water. Okay no big deal. So we came by for our order and we still weren't felling that well. So I told her we realized we aren't THAT hungry we are just going to do some apps. We ordered 2 and I asked to keep the 1 menu.  (We were going to order more but never got the chance). I guess since we said we weren't that hungry, that meant we weren't worth her time. I'm in the industry. TRUST ME I would have been worth her time. (Her name was Melody, Mellie, or Melanie) we had to ask a busser who barely spoke English for more water. She walked by and dropped off our check. Clearly she didn't want us to order more.  We ended up doing next store to get cocktails and food and dessert."
Pete S.,"Lubbock, TX",60,667,1647,4.0,9/25/2015,We love the Cheesecake Factory. We like to come to this location when we're in the area. The store is always clean and the staff are very friendly. We've had most everything on the menu and it's all been very good. We'll continue to return.
Hilary S.,"Leander, TX",5,12,,4.0,11/1/2015,The service in the bar area is awesome. So are the bloody Marie's. I forgot to post my review the last time I went. But I definitely recommend this place.
Daminique A.,"San Antonio, TX",5,22,21,5.0,5/12/2014,Louisiana pasta is now my new favorite !!! It has the perfect balance of spices the noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. I had a water and a Georgia Peach who  is not like me to order drinks but this one was beyond perfect... The customer service was great as well !
Connie N.,"Pasadena, TX",10,30,46,4.0,9/15/2014,"First time at The Cheesecake Factory, I went with the American classic Spaghetti and Meatballs. I thought the noodles were hard, but i overlooked it because I was distracted but the flavor of it. Spaghetti was spot on delicious. I would give it five star but the whole dish was served only with TWO meatballs. Come on man, wouldn't hurt to add in a few more."
Samantha F.,"Spring, TX",468,183,87,5.0,9/13/2014,"We were a party of 6 adults and 3 toddlers/babies.  Our waiter was fast, semi observant and nice. Upon arrival we were seated on the patio quickly and with the cool front that moved in it was quite nice.  We ordered drinks and then our meal.  Everything tasted yummy. My biggest PROBLEM which is actually more feedback is that the highchairs are old and need to be replaced and/or a good scrubbing.  We had 3 highchairs at our table in which all 3 were dirty.  Like when we wiped them down they came up brown :-( All in all I still gave them 5 stars as this is an easy and quick fix that I hope they observe."
Brent L.,"San Antonio, TX",256,706,1301,4.0,4/11/2012,"I've only been to Cheesecake Factory twice, and only once to this location.  Service was superb and so was the food. I had the lunch portion of the Thai Chicken Pasta, which is basically Phad Thai.  VERY, VERY good!  Even though I ordered the lunch portion, I had enough to take home for dinner and just finished reheating it and eating it.  I can tell you it only got better! A bit on the pricey side, but the menu is QUITE extensive.  If someone in your party can't find something that peaks their interest, there is something wrong with them. Oh yeah, the cheesecake?  I've been twice but was so full from my meal I didn't have room for the cheesecake."
Emily J.,"Austin, TX",122,47,,1.0,3/12/2015,"My friends and I came here for a girls night, desperate to fill our hungry stomachs after waiting an hour and a half for a table at Whiskey Cake and then being told it would be another 40 minutes. Otherwise, normally I avoid low quality chains such as this place. I definitely learned my lesson at the Austin location many years back that Cheesecake Factory is extremely overpriced for very poor quality and low flavor food. But I figured I'd give it another chance, especially considering how hungry I was.  The only good things were the warm molasses bread (which I do admit was delicious), and the nice ambiance. Other than that, none of the food ordered by my group of 6 tasted good by any means. I ordered the Da Vinci Pasta which was extremely sweet, and I was turned off by the large amount of oil and cubes of sauteed chicken. My other friend ordered the Chicken and Biscuits -- overall very bland. Our waitress was nice but the food took a while to come out, as well as our checks. In the end I paid $18 for lackluster pasta that I totally could have made better with a jar of sauce at home.  I will definitely never return to Cheesecake factory again! Fool me once, fool me twice... Well, you know..."
Josh J.,"San Antonio, TX",0,25,,2.0,4/28/2015,Cheesecake was great. It better be its in their name. Our waitress sucked. Had family in for a vacation and iur waitress was blah. Never smiled looked annoyed. Had to ask numerous times for silverware and refills. Also just noticed others on here got food poisoning. ...well so did I! That explains it now!  Only if others request but not going to eat on my own
Laura G.,"Houston, TX",43,78,48,5.0,6/22/2015,Had an amazing server and the classic cheesecake was delicious! The recommended pasta was excellent!
Santina W.,"San Antonio, TX",31,29,18,4.0,3/23/2014,"Belgian Waffle ""Elvis"" Style for $9.95 at the Cheesecake Factory. I had never tasted a dish so yummy. Every Sunday, The Cheesecake factory serve brunch. I have been a few times to the North Star location (nothing to yelp about.). So I decided to try the La Cantera location.  My mouth watered as I read Belgian Waffle with Peanut Butter Cream, Fresh Banana, Bacon and Maple-Butter Syrup. They usually sprinkle the bacon on top, but I made a request to have it on the side. Service was relatively fast. Once I was serviced I eyeballed my plate and wanted to take a photo before eating, but I could not help myself. I devour those waffles as a fugitive that was on the run and this was my first meal out of the joint in 40 years (Jail House Rock, get it? Ok I am corny.). I had made Elvis style pancakes before even try to recreate the famous sandwich nothing comes close to how good this plate was (was meaning two minutes after me eating it like a ""Hound Dog""). The Peanut Butter cream was nice and creamy even melted when the hot pecan tasting syrup touch it. The Bananas was, in fact, fresh with no brown only brown was the Maple-Butter Syrup.  Sorry Yelper, I wouldn't be able to tell you the cleanliness of the place, couldn't tell you how nice or mean my waitress was. All I could do even as I write my review is sing ""Don't be cruel to a heart that's true, hubby hubby."" This plate for now on will be my favorite breakfast item, ""I Am in Love All Shook Up."" Ok, I will stop, I' am such a ""Hard Head Woman,"" I kid I kid!!! The Elvis Waffles alone= five stars.  Note to self stay away from the Strawberry Lemonade, $4.00? Really? Too much."
Natalie P.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,5,,1.0,2/28/2015,"Been to Cheesecake Factory many times but this time was really disappointed. My husband ordered 3 drinks, but was charged for 5. We explained to the manager of the typo but he would not agree with us. He said the waitress would not charge if the drink was never ordered. We told him that we had to tell her a few times about our drinks before it was brought to our table. He took off just 1 drink instead of 2.  My husband and I were so tired and didn't feel like explaining ourselves again that we just ended up paying for a drink we never ordered."
Jasmine H.,"Uvalde, TX",0,5,1,5.0,4/26/2016,"My friend and I came in today for dinner, and we were blown away by Hannah. She is honestly hands down the most genuine server out there. My friend is difficult when it comes to eating out and she handled everything with ease. Ask for Hannah!"
Jeremy K.,"San Antonio, TX",36,97,33,4.0,4/30/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is on par with most chain restaurants such as Olive Garden or Johnny Carinos.  The service is superb and the food is good but nothing mind blowing.  The environment was somewhat crowded, however the waiters and staff were extremely apologetic and courteous if even a tad bit of delay occurred.  Overall this is a nice place to come and have a decent meal served by great staff!"
Michelle D.,"Houston, TX",54,9,13,1.0,1/5/2015,"The worst CCF I have ever been to; this place needs new management quick. The Evelyn Favorite Pasta is so simple how could you mess that up? The avacado eggrolls, please make them to order dont dish out old dry food...wow. Truly disappointed in the quality of the product and the service of location. They swiped my card on an incorrect bill and they didn't realize it until I said, ""this is not my check"". And the bathrooms were a mess. I'm done."
