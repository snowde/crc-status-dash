Derek P.,"San Antonio, TX",0,28,,4.0,8/6/2014,"We went on National Cheesecake Day so naturally the place was packed but surprisingly the wait wasn't that bad - just 15 minutes for a mid-afternoon lunch. I like eating outside: it's quieter, brighter and usually the weather is good so it's nice.  I ordered Renee's Special and boy does Renee like to eat! Soup, salad, sandwich that could easily feed two and not to mention the bread which is to die for! Finally, the reason people go to the Cheesecake Factory: cheesecake. The newest flavor, lemon meringue, was beyond delicious as was the classic chocolate mousse. My only complaints were the price (for two people it was nearly $45) and the fact they brought out one order first and made me wait another five minutes before the other one came. But overall this place satisfies everyone and is the go to destination at the mall for lunch/dinner!"
Chike A.,"San Antonio, TX",326,10,2,4.0,9/21/2013,"A friend of mine was wondering where a good place for cheesecake would be... I stale-faced the mess out of her.... This has always a swell Factory. I usually love dark ambiance, but the table we were seated at felt like the bulb was going out lol. I didn't mind after I got my dessert... you need to order they're Smores cheesecake! Our waitress was good help, and I tipped her nicely."
Sarah R.,"San Antonio, TX",93,10,19,3.0,3/29/2015,"This is one of those places where the appetizers and desserts are wonderful, whereas the entrées are just kinda eh."
John S.,"McAllen, TX",2,36,17,3.0,12/23/2014,Cheesecakes were great! Four sets of utensils were filthy! They had old food and one had hair!
Nery S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",93,1,,2.0,4/3/2016,"If you're looking for casual or semi casual just go across the street to Yard House. Better made drinks, a variety of beers and better food. The bread we got was stale, the food I got was okay, but a little too much salt on my fries. My friend asked for no avocados and because our server decided to go off of memory and not write down our orders he brought his food with avocados. The enchiladas that my other friend got weren't really good he didn't even finish them, and the last meal was the burger and he said his was pretty good. Our server however was not very attentive he forgot about us at least 4 times. He would say he'd be right back with our food in a few moments, and those moments turned to long minutes. I went an entire meal without a refill on my water. Luckily I had a secondary drink to keep me hydrated.  Will probably not come to this location again and I do not recommend this location to anyone."
Jack K.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,2.0,4/1/2016,"I had high hopes for this location, but it missed the mark. The outdoor seating was nice and comfortable, but the quality of the food just isn't there for the price they are selling it at.  The tuna appetizer was pretty good, but very small.  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, with asparagus.  I received a well-done steak with green beans.... wish I just ordered a cheap burger for them to overcook.  My wife got the steak diane medium rare and it was equally overcooked crap.  She ordered the broccoli and it tasted like frozen broccoli from the microwave.  The saving grace was the cheesecake, so maybe just go there for dessert."
Renee G.,"Austin, TX",28,151,,5.0,2/15/2014,"This place never fails. The cheesecakes are divine & you can't go wrong with their blue cheese burger.  You probably cant handle a regular meal & cheesecake though, so pace yourself. :)"
Allison M.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,10,14,1.0,3/15/2015,"Went here for lunch today, and will probably not return for anything other than cheesecake. Our original nameless server got our drink order while her hands were full of dirty dishes from the table next to us, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizer(which was brought out by another nameless server), which were okay in flavor, although as our table was set with no knives, we had to ask a passing server for some. Our nameless server took our food order, then told us the evening shift was starting and we would be getting Jessica as our new server. Our food was brought out by surprise! Another nameless server. Presumably Jessica checked on us about 1/4 of the way into our meal asking if it was okay. Since I'm a server and was trying to have a nice day I didn't complain, however my salad tasted like wilted dirty lettuce and the grilled onions on the burger tasted like dirty fryer, we should have. The only good party of the meal was the Godiva Cheesecake. We have decided that Cheesecake Factory is a dessert only stop for us."
Carolyn J.,"San Antonio, TX",18,115,7,5.0,1/6/2015,"Love eating here and have never ever had bad service or a bad meal at this place.  Sometimes the wait is long because everyone else loves the place, too!  The 'Black-out' cake is so delicious!!!   I try a different dish each time.  The food is so beautifully prepared.  The staff will treat you like royalty.  Enjoy@"
Regina S.,"San Antonio, TX",7,24,,2.0,2/28/2014,The service is good but the food is nothing special and WAY too overpriced even with a gift card. Will not return.
Eric A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,,5.0,2/16/2015,The service is excellent and the food is delicious!  The ambiance is soothing and very clean environment. What more can I say? Highly recommended!
Mike J.,"San Antonio, TX",0,12,24,1.0,9/3/2016,"Terrible customer service. This place never has it together. They either run out of food or make it wrong.  My wife ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and the waitress came back and said they were out of it. So then we both ordered the hibachi steak medium. When it came out it was missing some ingredients and the steak was burned beyond well done. The waitress said the manager would come out and she would put in another order to replace the item. 30 minutes later and still no food. We asked to speak with the manager and a person named Scott came out. We explained to him everything that happened and that not only had it been 30 minutes but we still didn't have bread. He said he would look into it. We finally got our food. At any other place the management would take care of their customer but when we got the bill they charged us for everything without a apology or anything. The service is terrible, inventory management is bellow par and the kitchen crew doesn't have it together. I would rate my overall experience of this place a two thumbs down. What a waste of 2 hours of my evening."
Troy K.,"San Antonio, TX",352,28,5,3.0,8/10/2014,"Had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a corn mix. Food was pretty good, service wasn't bad. Did take a little longer than expected for the food to come out, but the restaurant was packed. Have had better cheesecake before though. Which is kinda sad being that the place is named Cheesecake Factory."
Jessica R.,"San Antonio, TX",28,47,20,3.0,7/19/2014,Bad start! Waitress plainly complaining to be seated again and so she just doesn't come by. Waited 10 minutes before asking the host to find us someone that can do their job.
Jason R.,"Cedar Park, TX",45,14,1,5.0,9/28/2012,"This is definitely one of my favorite places at La Cantera! First you have cheesecake.  Keep in mind this is not MY reason for coming but everyone that I've come here with (ranging from my wife to cousins to groups of friends) are always satisfied with their nightly choice of cheesecake. Secondly, the serving sizes.  I've you're concerned with not g etting what you pay for just dispatch that from your mind immediately.  Their lunch portions are good enough for dinner portions and for the most part, their dinner portions are enough for 2 meals (I'm lookin' at you meatloaf.) Third, SIT OUTSIDE.  Actually only do so if it's a good day outside.  If not, feel free to sit inside it's equally as good, however this is one of the only places where the patio is decently covered and not excessibely loud or distracting (or HOT). Lastly the staff is on their game.  I've never had a bad thing to say about anyone that I've come in contact there. I even once left my 'doggy bag' at my table and walked away.  They bussed the table and I came back and it was :cringe: gone.  I was able to speak to the manager about how excited I was to eat my leftovers the next day and lo' and behold he gave me a 25 dollar gift card to come back at our leisure and enjoy their services all over again.  That's about as good in customer service as it gets. I can't say anything in comparison to the North Star Mall location as I've never been there but definitely give this one a try if you are in the area."
H G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/1/2016,"I went with my 4 guests very recently. I always go to Cheesecake @Northstar mall and have good experiences so far, but this last time at La Centara it was the worst dinning out experience.  Long story short, we ordered burgers, waited 15-20 mins, waitress came back and said they are out of patty. Okay then we decided to go with something else.  And waited for an he to get our food. After that at deserts time, we order blackout cheesecake their ""Special menu"" item, again 15-25 mins waitress came back with answer we are so sorry that we are out of it too !!! We decided to go to Bj's since it's close by and apparently serves better, so we asked to get our check. And the worst part of the story was our empty headed waitress put two burgers and cake in our total bill that was not even with them and wasn't served to us ..... !!! I asked for her through other waitress since she never showed up after, waited for another 10-15 mins for her to come back and correct but she never showed up ... Horrible service and empty headed waitresses with full of attitude ! They charge you for the item wasn't served. I don't know was it a honest mistake or something suspicious in their business. Never coming back at this location"
Alecia Y.,"Stafford, TX",3,15,7,5.0,9/1/2013,Best Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to! The Miso Salmon with white rice was delicious. The Pasta Di Vinci saw savory and the Fish and Chips melt in your mouth. We ordered the Crab and Artichoke Dip as an appetizer and were NOT disappointed. They have excellent service and everything was piping hot. Will definitely dine here again!
Vicky M.,"San Antonio, TX",1,7,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Ordered orange chicken, for the price, horrible! So disappointing I was hungry."
Heidi K.,"San Antonio, TX",95,105,,4.0,9/11/2012,"First off, the North Star Mall location is WAY better. Second off, the food is consistently delicious and so much variety. Third, the cheesecake is way too sweet for me and I've had better. Over-rated."
Erik G.,"McAllen, TX",14,32,23,2.0,11/22/2014,I was so excited to come and visit this location. The surrounding area is very fancy and expectations are higher here. I was disappointed to have to wait almost three hours for a table of 15. Manager was not very cooperative and was a little rude. I ordered the chicken Alfredo. It was almost 20 for the plate. And not worth it. If your coming with a larger group don't come. Very disappointed. My ticket was over 30 for that and a micro piece of cheesecake.
