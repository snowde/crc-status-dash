Melanie J.,"San Antonio, TX",191,324,974,5.0,11/4/2012,Jonathan really took care of us for dessert!  Red velvet cheesecake wasn't thawed out so they let us take it home to have when we got home and let us have another one already thawed at the restaurant.....thank you for the generosity and great customer service!
Rajul V.,"San Antonio, TX",1,7,,4.0,1/9/2016,I went here on 12/24 at around 7pm. We had a great meal and never felt rushed. The waitstaff was very accommodating.  A number of diners at other tables were also dining after we left. The desert was delicious enough to necessitate myself wearing stretchy pants the next day since I wasn't sure my pants would fit as before!   The drinks were awesome as well.
Manuel Y.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2015,"Honestly... Food is awful and tasteless if you want to go with your family here, just don't I spend 240 just for nothing"
Sara G.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,121,41,5.0,10/20/2014,"Hands down, the BEST happy hour you can get. $5 apps and $5 cocktails including a Cosmopolitan, Long Island, and wine. You have to sit in the bar Mon-Fri from 4-6 for HH. No kids. Nice atmosphere. Lots of choices. Bartenders are friendly."
Mindy B.,"San Diego, CA",3,146,10,5.0,8/20/2014,"Come on, it's Cheesecake Factory! It's all over the country and the food is consistently delicious. I have had probably 25 things off their menu and all but a couple are really yummy. The menu is huge. There is something to please everyone. The wait is always long but that because it's so good."
David H.,"Houston, TX",19,19,2,5.0,1/20/2015,"Absolutly delicious. Many variations of cheesecake you can try. But if that is not your thing, you can buy burgers, pasta, steak, and more here. Low prices, from $6-$25. A bit for everyone to try and it keeps you wanting to coming back because its that delicious."
Lorraine W.,"Southern Pines, NC",83,185,370,3.0,8/8/2014,"As expected, a 35 minute wait at 730 on a Thursday but hey, its Cheesecake Factory, expect a lot of good food. When the host tried to seat us, in a very narrow area that would create issues for servers to walk by, I had to ask to be moved to another table that had ample space for a stroller. Normally I wouldn't have brought the stroller to the table but our toddler was sleeping after fighting naps all day, so we were;t gonna mess up a good thing.  Our server was very nice and attentive to all our needs so I would give 4 stars to her. However, don't order chicken piccata from this place. The chicken was cooked wrong, it was terrible. Then the sauce was almost like a soup with green stuff floating all over and scarce capers. I love capers and thats a huge reason why I order this plate, but I guess the price of capers these days is up there with gold. I gave one of the three pieces of chicken to my husband who likes to vacuum up my extras like an anteater but even he didn't like it. In all, I think I ate one piece and had a few bites of the pasta.  My husband ordered the Ballagio chicken I believe, its lightly fried and crispy, very thin, topped with arugula and prosciutto. As I looked at his plate in envy, he devoured it and claimed it was glorious.  Our son had bow tie pasta with meat sauce, it looked good but they were holding back on the sauce, so he didn't finish it.  I would suggest as far as cheesecakes go, the lemon raspberry is incredible. No military discounts are offered here, boo on you Cheesecake."
Gilbert T.,"Tucson, AZ",7,250,62,5.0,7/23/2014,"Very nice restaurant at La Cantera.  The wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and had a pleasant time.  At first I was a little worried, since it was Saturday night and the place was completely full.  At the cheescake factory's in Arizona, this would be a sign for slow service, but here we got seated fairly quickly and our server was extremely nice.  The food was excellent as well and overall it was a pleasant experience."
Amy S.,"San Antonio, TX",73,34,81,3.0,1/5/2012,"Open since 5 December 2011, the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant known for their gargantuan portion sizes. The NW side of San Antonio is teeming with chain restaurants and the Shops at La Cantera is no stranger to embracing them. It's unfortunate San Antonio chefs and chef owned restaurants are lacking on this side of town.   Nonetheless, our party of four was seated promptly and courteously.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  I personally ordered a child's portion meal which was more than enough of portion to satisfy me. The husband and guests were pleased with their menu selections. Always a good place to eat to take home leftovers for your next meal."
April M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,2.0,8/19/2013,WORST WORSTWORST!!!  I defiantly prefer the cheesecake factory at NORTH Star I've gone twice to this location and both times have been horrible.  I went this past Sunday. I had no idea who was my waiter. I had 3 different waiters. Their pasta is never done correctly. The service was just horrible. the serving portion was for lunch and they were charging for the full menu price.  I gave them two stars only because they change that.  I had to go to the host to ask for my waitress.  The people next too us had been waiting over an hour for their food  they had children even their son fell asleep from waiting. I will NEVER RETURN despite how close it is too me.
SM N.,"Rigby, ID",2,14,,5.0,8/25/2015,"Fantastic GF options on main dishes.  With there were more options in the cheesecake department but Hey we can't have everything.  Staff was great, atmosphere was great and options for the kids great. Love the location as well!"
Chand Z.,"San Antonio, TX",23,7,2,5.0,8/23/2014,"I don't think I'm able to use complete sentences (tired and full) but here is my review-- Menu: huge, appetizing, beautiful  Servers: polite, pleasant, beautiful  Silverware, plates, and cups: cute, creative, match feel to restaurant  Food: yummy, pretty, satisfying  The place has a pleasant atmosphere but my mom made me wear a dress so I was uncomfortable DX"
Don R.,"Boerne, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/12/2014,"Nothing worse than being disappointed by a old friend. We visited the Cheesecake Factory in the La Cantera Mall for a late lunch. We were made to wait a short time although the restaurant was but half full. After another wait at iur table, our server Beth greeted us with the usual request for drinks. We had sufficient time to read the menu fore and aft, so we were ready to order drinks and meal. Beth took the order with my wife ordering a chicken marsella, I believe and my order of their most costly item a Ribeye with French fries and a dinner salad in addition.  I instructed our server to substitute Caesar dressing for their standard vinegarette. Beth brought our ice teas and I asked for a tea spoon to add equal to my tea.  After about 20 minutes, I stopped Beth as she passed us for the 4th time and asked her for my tea spoon. She said, ""They haven't brought me one from the back yet!"" I told her that twenty minutes was unreasonable to wait, whereas she brought my wife and I fresh napkins with silver as she mumbled that she had to do it this way!!!???. Then she delivered a half hour late the bread and butter that us customarily provided at the drink service. We waited for my salad for another 20 minutes as Beth finaaly had the facilitators deliver our meals NOT as ordered but without french fries and a substitute salad with vinegarette and Caesar dressing on the side. I told the facilitator to take the salad back where she decided to tell me that I had ordered it thst way. My wife's meal appeared to be as ordered, I got a plate with a 1/4"" ribeye, over cooked and a butter knife to cut it. This $27 steak I didn't expect to be of Barn Door quality but I did expect it to be better than a Dennys $12.95 steak. As i truly struggled to cut this piece taken from between the horns, the manager came to rescue our experience. We sat and listened to him bad mouth Beth's mistakes, I began to feel sorry for her having to work for this guy of little managerial experience. Aster another 20 minutes my steak and my wife's chicken were both swimming in a coagulated slime of excess fat. The manager returned with the steak knife and began again his excuses where at I asked him, "" just let us finish and thank you."" Now make believe you a manager of a nation chain who business model strives for consistency in food and service nationwide.  You have 2 early retirees very displeased; what would you do? Well this is what they did... Beth shows up with a dessert menu and asks, ""Will you be ordering cheesecake? She know the answer as she flopped the bill on the table turned on her heals and went where she disappears to. I opened the portfolio and what do you think I saw? Now you're the manger, what would you do to 2 regular customers who are exactly the demographic any restaurant is looking for. Well, your wrong, they charged me for everything including what I didn't get!!! I gave her my credit card and much later as usual, she brought me my receipt and very cheerfully said the manager took off the French fries you didn't get! How about the salad I didn't get and the boot leather steak and the lousy service."
Vivian Q.,"San Antonio, TX",144,199,729,5.0,12/13/2013,"Food is so delish had their meatloaf, mash potato and fresh corn and the salmon with asparagus. Of course I saved the best for last CHEESECAKE. But I am so stuffed so it's to go lol. Ordered mango key lime, white chocolate raspberry and original (I mean there's tomorrow and the next day)"
Kellie B.,"San Antonio, TX",3,4,,5.0,7/8/2014,"I took my daughter and her friends there for her birthday. The service was great, they brought her cheesecake with a candle to blow out and sang happy birthday. Not to mention the unbelievable cheesecake! I had pineapple upside down cheesecake. Amazing!"
JMayMay M.,"Chico, CA",119,165,32,5.0,11/27/2013,Absolutely amazing deserts!! I shared a slice of macadamian Carmel cheesecake with my sis and it was so delicious. This was my first time and I have to say this is a beautiful place to take anyone..
Winston U.,"Cibolo, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Originally wanted to eat at Z Tejas but they were closed so we opted for Cheesecake Factory next door. My wife and a friend of ours ordered food, our friend and I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, my wife got miso salmon... She was the lucky one. Halfway through my drive home my stomach starts rumbling then a heavy urge to hit the toilet. Needless to say I had liquid runs when I got home. I figured it had to be the food with how fast it hit me. I text my friend and told her the Alfredo tore me up and she says ""me too!"" Though we laughed about it this is pretty serious. That's the problem with such a large menu, freshness suffers... I bet either their walk in freezer is a mess or the cooks are just plain careless. Either way, this is people's lives you're playing with and needless to say neither I nor my family friends will EVER visit this location again. You're lucky we didn't end up in the hospital or I'd sue your @$$ for this."
Emmett C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,1.0,3/8/2015,The service here is really bad......I had to talk to the mgr three times just to get drinks. It took over an hour to get our good and the orders were wrong
Patrick A.,"Boerne, TX",25,85,146,4.0,11/30/2012,"As with all Cheesecake Factories, upscale atmosphere, huge selection of good quality entrees.  We just dropped by for the Cheesecake this time and it was great.  I had the Red Velvet cheesecake... worth the $7."
Kate K.,"San Antonio, TX",19,221,,3.0,10/30/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is what it is.  Yes, their cheesecake is good, but it's your typical run of the mill large US chain restaurant.  Their food is somewhere between decent and mediocre, depending on what you have.  I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant to have your mind blown, but it's a decent place to grab a meal while you're shopping."
