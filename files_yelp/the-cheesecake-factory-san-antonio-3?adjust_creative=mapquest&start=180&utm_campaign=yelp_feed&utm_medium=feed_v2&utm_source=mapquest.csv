Marilyn P.,"Hollis, NY",0,14,,3.0,12/14/2014,The food is always good especially the appetizers which are large enough to make a meal of!  Highly recommend the Buffalo wings and Avocado Rolls super delish and the dippings that accompany them are very tasty and compliment the flavors. The negatives are the noise and the long wait to be seated. The 20 minute expected wait turned into almost double that time. Just too long! Would have given higher rating if not for that
David R.,"Austin, TX",11,111,,1.0,3/14/2012,"My wife loves CF so I took the family there for her birthday. We spent a decent amount, had alcohol, appetizers, food, and dessert but you would think we were scum. The waitress would not make eye contact so that we could order a second round of drinks, we had to get the manager to give us a wine menu and to order our 2nd round. The waitress would move as fast as she could to avoid eye contact. When I paid I was going to ask for a box for the cake and she dropped it and ran as fast as she could. Having to call the manager over twice, I would have thought he would have corrected this or offered something like a coffee or some sort of token, but no. So I won't be going to this location again."
Maura K.,"San Antonio, TX",27,11,,2.0,3/16/2012,"We went to The Cheesecake Factory on Monday.   It was crowded but we were seated quickly.   The service was great.  The problem was they were out of Kobe Burgers and Steak.  The menu is robust so it was not difficult to find something else.   Then when it was time for dessert, they were out of original cheesecake, apple streusel cheesecake and Oreo cheesecake.  How can they be out if original cheesecake??? I asked to speak to the manager, his response was even more disappointing, he stated he just had the same conversation with another table....  He didn't offer to take anything off our bill or a complementary dessert for next visit.  He only offered worthless excuses.   We spent a lot of money on a disappointing dinner."
Courtenay C.,"San Antonio, TX",18,36,2,5.0,4/11/2013,Been to this location several times and never been disappointed. Good servers and decent food at a mid level price sounds good too me. Cheesecake is always good but expensive. Had a problem once but manager and server made sure it was fixed promptly.
Amati P.,"San Antonio, TX",36,37,13,4.0,1/13/2013,"Love, Love, Love The Cheesecake Factory.  I don't know a lot of places you can eat at the has something for everyone on the menu.  From All-American to Asian inspired options, you will almost always fine a tasty option.  I had the Oreo Extreme Cheesecake and I have to say it was great, can't wait to get home and finish it tonight."
Justin M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,9,,5.0,8/23/2014,Wonderful atmosphere awesome food little pricey but definitely worth it. We have never left disappointed or hungry.... always kid friendly and the staff is very helpful...
James R.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/14/2014,"Typical Southern Texas service...extremely nice but clueless.  Late afternoon lunch on a Thursday at 245 pm, only a handful of table/eaters....waitress extremely nice and friendly but forgot to put in all of the orders...lunch delayed an hour.  Offer for free dessert not taken...can not buy my time back.  Will not return for the really poor service alone. Go somewhere else...."

Kurt C.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,9,,1.0,11/23/2012,"I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory many times - but never this location.  I typically find The Cheesecake Factory a plesant experience - but certainly not this location.  I should have known early into this meal that there was going to be problems....  As Sara B. was confused on what drink I ordered - but she didn't ask for clarification - but brought me 2 vodka martinis when I ordered 1.  Did she actually think I wanted to drink 2 martinis at once?  She took back the 2nd martini and stated she'd subtract it from my bill - like she was doing me a favor (!).  My friend and I started with hot edaname and chicken lettuce wraps.  The edaname was fine - but arrived late.  The lettuce wraps took FOREVER to arrive.  When they did it was like they ran out of the condiments and grabbed the bottom of the barrell (e.g. carrot slices and chinese noodles).  The chinese noodles were actually frozen.  I realized the delay was due to someone back in the kitchen trying to come up with another serving of condiments where there was none to be found!    When I had to point out this OBVIOUS issue - the waitress (Sara) looked at me dumbfounded and stated she'd fix it.  After 10 mins she returned and told me they ran out of chinese noodles and ""would have to make some"".  Approx 15 mins later she returned with chinese noodles that looked like a pile of goo....  Didn't poor Sara realize the problem she tried to correct got tremendously worse.  The amazing thing is this gal didn't understand the problem.   I called for the mgr who arrived and asked me what the problem was (shouldn't have had to explain the obvious).  She told me she'd take the item off my bill (duh?!) asked me ""if I wanted a piece of cheesecake"".  My response was ""I'd just like my meal"" (at that point I had waited 1 hr and had only been served my edaname and martini).  The mgr (oriental gal) didn't really understand how badly they screwed up my meal.  The incompetence was so bad that it caused me to just want to leave vs. wait for my food.  When my food (hibachi steak) eventually arrived it was good.  The waitress and mgr then stopped by and asked my how my steak was - I replied ""fine"".  They both just wanted to hear from my mouth ""fine"" so that they could go onto something else.  BTW: I ordered cheesecake and paid for it myself.  I was too exhausted from this experience to talk to the mgr/waitress any longer. Very disappointed and I'll NEVER come back to this place."
