Natalie M.,"San Antonio, TX",1,12,,1.0,12/1/2016,"Went for our team luncheon & my review is on the food, definitely not wait staff. Ordered the Pit Beef Dip with French fries. Couldn't even eat 1/2 of it.  The meat was so fatty it was disgusting. I can't believe for almost $15 I couldn't get good quality meat. Wanted to warn others DO NOT order that. If I had been there on a regular lunch I would have complained but considering it was with my team of 15 ppl & it was prepaid I didn't want to cause a scene."
Bridget W.,"Milwaukee, WI",116,265,300,2.0,3/15/2015,"Food: I always wince when I see huge menus. Too many options, not likely anything is fresh. I've come here a few times with friends and always disappointed by the food. I'm not a cheesecake person, so I wouldn't go out of my way to get one from here. When I do get them, I think they taste fine. Service: The service I've encountered has always been friendly on the food service side. Hostess wise, I feel like they don't really care most of the time. But they're professional at least. Location: This is one of the few restaurants in La Cantera that's easy to spot. It's on the southeast corner of the mall and has a parking lot nearby. It's near Yard House. If you see B&N, you're nearby! Just keep heading east. If I ever do go another time, I'll stick with a salad. Everything else is just a lot of wasted calories. Overall, I just don't get the hype. I'd give it 1.5 stars if I could."
Xinyao X.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/22/2017,They overcooked my steak without giving me any compensation. I told them my steak was overcooked and they just smiled and went away
Elizabeth H.,"San Antonio, TX",10,16,1,1.0,11/29/2015,"Usually, this place is great when you want to eat ""nice looking"" food and when you're trying to stay on a budget.  Pasta and salmon is pretty good and the price is just right.  This story was from June of 2015, and i never ever went back. Unfortunately, the useless and empty headed hostesses can really make your life so much more complicated. I had a hostess give us a 30 min wait time and when finally got called, she sat me and my 3 friends, only for us to order drinks and her come back and tell us she accidentally gave us someone else's table and she gave our table to someone else, so we had to wait another 25 min or go sit outside (when one of our guests wasn't able to sit outside for health reasons).  So we sat outside and sure enough our waitress was the worst server i have ever encountered. She brought things out late, cold, gave us attitude and never gave us refills, not to mention we rarely saw her. It wasn't even busy and we realized people who were seated way after us had gotten their food already.  When we were wanting to order dessert she had rolled her eyes because she had our ticket ready, so we told her to forget it and I gave her my card. Later she came back and put the bill on the table only for her to pick it up again and circle something very harsh and vigorously at the bottom of the ticket. When she places it in front of me, i look at it and noticed she circled the gratuity percentages. Um? i can read. The ticket was torn due to how harsh she circled, and that did it for me.  I am known to leaving nothing less than 20% tip when i go out. I love tipping because i love making others feel like they did good work. But this girl? Hell no. So i left her $0.01 as tip and wrote ""I can read for myself, hope the service gets better next time."""
Glen H.,"San Antonio, TX",13,104,39,4.0,4/3/2015,"Yay for gift cards.  A little more spendy than our usual fare.  However the waiter informed us of the lunch portion meals, less cost and they SAID less food.  The portions were still huge.  Had the meatloaf, interesting flavor, not sure what the seasoning is they used but it was good.  They use brown gravy on it and the mashed potatoes, SCORE!  And then there's the cheese cake.  Tuxedo chocolate something, don't remember the exact name.  If you like chocolate don't pass this one by.  The wife had the red velvet, it was terrific also."
Beverly R.,"Boerne, TX",1,11,,2.0,10/27/2016,Ordered pick up and had to wait 15 minutes after they said order would ready. Counterperson was rude when I asked about  drink holder. She did not offer but had to be asked to repeat order to me to make sure it was right.
April H.,"Austin, TX",5,36,11,5.0,8/31/2015,I have loved the cheesecake factory since I was a child and continue to be a huge fan. I love how diverse the menu is and continue to try new things and enjoy every bite! Love the mac and cheese and the avocado egg rolls!!
Gene B.,"Queen Creek, AZ",28,231,125,3.0,1/10/2015,"Server Victoria R was great, food was great. Only complaint is that the hostess / greeters are totally unprofessional. When we went it was very busy and cold/ raining outside so everyone was inside, girls were in and out of some cabinet, which is fine, but were very rude each time, like the customers were annoying and in their way. Other than that, everything was great. Update.. Not nearly as busy when leaving, same girls in front, no thank you, no have a nice night. I know this isn't a super expensive place but very tacky for sick a nice place and everyone else was great."
Christina S.,"San Antonio, TX",45,27,8,5.0,8/3/2016,"The boyfriend and I constantly visit this location at least once a week. We enjoy everything on the menu including drinks, dessert, and food. It is nice to be welcomed and remembered by all of the staff. It is a busy location but definitely worth visiting."
Tina B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2015,"Our friends decided to have her baby shower here so we called ahead of time like probably 3days prior. This place made us wait for 2 hours in the lobby, an hour to order and other hour to get our food! Waste of time, money and energy!  Not coming back."
Jennifer D.,"San Antonio, TX",42,151,447,5.0,12/20/2014,Stopped at The Cheesecake Factory last night for a quick bite. I had to have some cheesecake. I ordered the key lime pie....It was DELSIH!!!  My hubby ordered the tiramisu cheesecake. He loved his as well.   Our son ordered a club sandwich. It looked yummy and he enjoyed it. I'm thinking that'll be my lunch next time i'm there. Nice evening and of course i'll be back :-)
Allen U.,"Odessa, TX",10,175,580,4.0,1/24/2016,"Famous for their cheesecake, I paid this Cheesecake Factory a visit on a Sunday afternoon for a bite after hours on the Interstate needless to say the wait wasn't bad at 10-20 minutes around 4:30pm, not bad. We were seated and I personally am not familiar with the food menu (just cheesecake) so I asked the server what he would recommend. He recommended the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was good but not too exceptional. He assured our needs were met and made sure our beverages were adequately filled. All in all it was a good visit, we tried the Dutch Caramel Apple cheesecake which was a bit hard to my surprise. Overall, I do recommend for the experience, menu is high price, entrees are ok, always ask for cheesecake!"
Kristina B.,"Laredo, TX",1,46,61,1.0,8/7/2015,Not good! The food tasted like a fast food chicken nugget dipped in cold sweet n sour sauce. The service was slow and waiter was not attentive. The cheesecake I ordered was okay. This place has def gone down.
Ann H.,"Denver, CO",149,459,451,3.0,8/14/2014,"3.5 stars this location is always jam packed. if you have a party of more than 2, expect a decent wait, especially on weekends! the great thing about cheesecake factory is that there's something for everyone. prices are average and food is usually pretty good. my only complaint is that the last two times i went, my bbq chicken salad had really wet lettuce... and it was kinda bitter-tasting so i had to drench it in dressing, which i normally use little to none of on my salads. also, their entrees are all huge! not something to complain about, but i never end up having room for dessert haha. service can be a little hit or miss. the servers always seem to be running around and sorta stressed out and it can be awhile before they come back to your table to take your order or check on you. don't come here for a quick meal, but if you have time and need a break from shopping, it's a great spot.  p.s. if you have at&t, service inside the restaurant is basically nonexistent. that's saying a lot because i usually get service everywhere!"
Sarah F.,"San Antonio, TX",26,223,7,2.0,11/19/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory multiple times, but this time was not great. Our waitress was nice and very helpful. I got a pasta dish with roasted vegetables. It was alright. The pecan pumpkin cheesecake was good. On the way home my stomach started hurting. I will never order that dish again!"
Jade M.,"San Antonio, TX",204,644,1575,4.0,7/31/2015,"I went to Cheesecake factory yesterday afternoon with my mom to celebrate National Cheesecake Day (all slices were 1/2 off, which was awesome). We sat in the bar area (the bar tops and actual bar are first come first serve) and the service was very good despite the bartenders being busy. Their happy hour has a nice selection of food for $5.50. We ordered the warm crab and artichoke dip (AMAZING) and the happy hour burger. On previous occasions I've tried the avocado egg rolls (super good!), the sweet corn tamale cakes (very flavorful but they fall apart easily) and the spinach dip (just okay). On this visit we also tried the Greek salad for $6.75 (it was pretty disappointing - very bitter arugula and too much dressing), next time we'll just get the regular salad. The cheesecake was delicious as always and to our surprise on our receipt we received a survey offer for a $10 e-card to use on our next visit. We will definitely be back. Thanks!"
Leonard E.,"San Antonio, TX",1,10,,5.0,4/24/2016,"Had lunch after church, there was a short wait because the place was packed. The waitress was very knowledgeable and really knew the huge menu. Needless to say she was great and kept our glasses full.  The food tasted great and the portions were reasonable. My wife picked this place and we are definitely going back."
Nic V.,"Montgomery, AL",0,25,,5.0,7/17/2016,Had dinner here and the service was excellent!  I normally go to the one by Northstar mall and that one is good as well.  I would probably go to this one again. I love the outside eating option and although it was crowded the wait wasn't that bad.
Helena C.,"San Antonio, TX",12,12,1,3.0,7/28/2016,"I love the location! The cheesecake factory has always been a great place to eat, with exception of the prices. Though, this most recent visit was just a bit disappointing. My waitress rarely checked on my table, and even forgot to put in my order! I still love the food, and will probably be returning soon."
Melissa S.,"Rockport, TX",0,2,6,1.0,2/4/2017,"Horrible!! Fettuccini Alfredo noodles were over cooked and stuck together. The manager asked if I wanted to try it with an ""easier noodle like spaghetti"". Nope, just want  traditional fettuccini Alfredo done right!! Not sure what's ""easier"" than pasta?! Veggie burger was requested, twice, without Mayo or cheese. Showed up with cheese. Took it back and brought  back a patty that was so uncooked it just fell apart when my guest lifted it to eat it! The rice in it was not done. Gross! The bun was wet and soggy on the bottom. Needless to say, after 2 hours of waiting for a table and gross food, we left. $16.50 fettuccini Alfredo and they can't cook it correctly. Didn't even want to give it one star."
