Lisa A.,"San Antonio, TX",65,2,,1.0,10/11/2016,"Only giving this establishment one star because I can't give ZERO stars.....The service here was ok, then when are food came everything looked delicious...but my plate which was a spaghetti and meatball plate was DISGUSTING...the meatballs were undercooked. I took a big bite of one of the meatballs and it was raw....when we told the waitress, she questioned me...she said verbatim ""which meatball was it?"" and followed to question my statement. As I pointed to which meatball it was, she said if I wanted to get a fresh plate of just meatballs by itself, and I agreed thinking I was going to get a fresh plate, but moments later the manager Kim came up and said that if I wanted she could just take the old meatballs and ""warm them up"" not even offering my new meatballs, let alone a fresh plate of pasta. At this point I was starving so I agreed to the suggestion of warming up my meatballs. So on a dirty bread plate that was on our table, I continued to place the meatballs on the plate. Kim grabbed the dirty plate with my undercooked meatballs to the back. I waited for 15 min and still no meatballs...so I proceed to eat what was left of my cold spaghetti....meatball-less....finally the waitress came back and was like ""oh you still haven't gotten your meatballs?"" And I said ""NO"". Because I had already ate all my pasta I didn't see a point in still waiting for the re-heated meatballs. So I cancelled my order...she left for a few minutes and came back with the manager Kim and said they were only going to charge me for a spaghetti and marinara sauce for the inconvenience....My friend Jackie complained to Kim again because she felt it was ill from their part to still charge me for a plate that I didn't even get to enjoy because of the undercooked meat. They were just giving us excuses of why it took so long. Finally they gave in and took care of my check all together after a few arguments...I will never come to this establishment again. I'd rather drive 30 min to the Cheesecake Factory that's in Northstar Mall than ever coming to this location again, which is only 7 minutes away from my house."
Teofila R.,"San Antonio, TX",99,176,2033,4.0,8/11/2014,This place is always packed no matter what time or day it is. Luckily they have a nice bar with good cold drinks! They have a great menu with big and small entrees. Of course the selection of cheesecakes is heaven.
Ariel D.,"San Antonio, TX",18,17,35,5.0,5/3/2015,"Came here for the first time with my husband as a date, we had the cheese sticks (triangles) they were the best we ever had. I got the Angel hair pasta with shrimp and he had the Mac and cheese burger and we loved them both. Our server was great and attentive and it was a very calm atmosphere. If you haven't been here at least try it once. I need to come back to eat the cheesecakes"
Mister D.,"San Antonio, TX",51,479,137,4.0,4/14/2015,"Environment: B (+0.5) We met here for a business meeting/luncheon. It was a nice day so we decided to sit outside on the patio and the seating was excellent (little padded benches that were really comfortable). The only reason there was a -0.5 was because the hosts/hostesses sat a large family with a dozen kids next to us. When a customer tells you they are there on business, be mindful of who/where you're seating people around them (and for reference they have a massive patio so this is not a completely unreasonable request). The end result was while we were trying to talk, we had random kids running around with balloons chasing each other and screaming.  Food Quality:  A (+1) Everything looked and tasted great. I had the fish tacos at the recommendation of the server and they came out great. I usually hate black beans and rice, but both were surprisingly good. Selection: A (+1) The menus are actually books with pages after pages of food items. I'm not sure how often food items get updated here, but I imagine they have seasonal items.  Don't let the books fool you though - there are ads throughout the menu books, so while they are long, this makes them seem much more extensive than they really are.  Service: A (+1) Our Server was Julian and he did an excellent job. He had just the right amount of attentiveness to where he wasn't nagging but he wasn't neglectful either. Drinks stayed filled and he made excellent recommendations for us all and we were thoroughly impressed with his service and knowledge of the menu.  Value: A (+1) For the food quality and level of service, I felt as if the cost that I paid for my meal was more than justified. It's also important to consider the location - being inside the mall around other premium restaurants (like Perry's Steakhouse and Yard House), Cheesecake Factory is actually competitive on pricing, all things considered."
Chelsea M.,"Raleigh, NC",224,211,431,3.0,4/2/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory was a late night decision when not much else was open. This is a nice location, the staff is friendly and the service is pretty good. I always only order small plates from the lighter fare menu. I don't want to even attempt the calorie count on some of the main dishes, I'm glad they have ""light"" options. This is certainly a ""cheat day"" restaurant. I really enjoyed the warm asparagus salad. The grilled artichoke is done well, the marinade separates it from Yardhouse's grilled artichoke, a nice flavor. I like the summer rolls, but no shrimp here. I think I saw one baby one, don't expect more than that. My date got sliders, they were sort of piled on the plate. Overall a good experience."
Gastón S.,"San Antonio, TX",106,19,6,2.0,10/5/2015,"There is so much I can say of the cheesecake factory but I will summarize it in a few sentences. Quantity of options over quality. I don't think you can point out to one specific item in their menu and say, ohh, this is a must have. Most of their options are over priced and the food is not fresh nor flavorful. The service can never be predicted. You either get a really good waiter, or you get one that doesn't really care and is passive aggressive  (the worst kind).  It's usually packed with people that couldn't think of a better place to go.  The cheesecake is the only justifier  for the two stars in the rating."
Raed M.,"San Antonio, TX",20,18,1,4.0,6/28/2016,So I went there absolutely hungry . Hadn't eaten the entire day and I dragged my parents with me because I thought we'd bond over food . So we sat close to the bar which I hoped wouldn't be too loud and guess what? It wasn't! Our server was very nice I forgot his name but his service was fast and efficient . He refilled as soon as my glasses were empty which I couldn't stop appreciating and being hungry I underestimated the quantity. Oh my god it was a lot of food! Had to make it to go because I couldn't finish it and neither could my parents.  The strawberry sauce cheesecake was my favorite duh and I was impressed with the brewed coffee. I take mine black no milk and no sugar but their blend was actually pretty classy. It wasn't bitter at all like a good black coffee. I can't stand the coffee at ihop so I was a little nervous ordering coffee here.  I would come here again but maybe mainly for desserts since the ambiance service and the sweet stuff were my favorite bits. I might try to explore the menu more but I think it's best to stick with the cheesecake and coffee because I like to play it safe. Keep up the good work! Oh and i took away one star because the desserts didn't come with a dessert spoon and we could have used more napkins . But overall pretty good !  There's always room for improvement !
Roxy R.,"Houston, TX",11,121,65,5.0,7/30/2014,The food is always pretty good except once with the fried Mac n cheese but they did try to fix the problem.  The combo of chicken meidera and steak Diane is always a great choice and what I usually always order.  As for the cheesecake my favorite thus far is dulce de leche. Try it you don't be disappointed.
Timothy O.,"San Antonio, TX",15,29,,2.0,5/21/2015,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factories in multiple states and I've been pleased/content with them up until my visit to the La Cantera location yesterday (5/30/2012).   There was so much wrong that I'm wondering if we should even give this place another chance.    Usually, after a bad restaurant experience I will still go back a second and perhaps a 3rd time so long as I view the cons as possible one-time occurrences. First, I wonder if I happened to be assigned the same waitress as  another reviewer (David R.).   Although we were not treated nearly as bad as David seems to have been, our waitress seemed disengaged and ho-hum about her job.  She made us feel like she really didn't want to be serving us and she didn't have a welcoming demeanor about her.  My wife's choice words were, ""stuck up"".    The next negative point is one that really got to me from the get-go.   As I was reviewing the menu I happened to look down at the fork that was sitting in front of me -- it had an old lettuce leaf plastered to it, yummy :)."
Yvonne G.,"Yuma, AZ",38,6,18,3.0,6/19/2016,"I really dislike that I have to give this place 3 stars, because I love the food. It is as always, delicious.  We had the loaded tater bites, spaghetti and meatballs and the Lemon Mer. Pie Cheesecake.. No complaints what so ever.. However the bathrooms.. Positively atrocious. Firstly there are only two stalls, and only one with toilet paper.  It took me chasing down 3 different employees while there was a 6 person wait. Add that to the fact that the stalls were filthy.  Come on now Cheesecake Factory. You're better than that!"
Dixie B.,"San Antonio, TX",77,111,303,3.0,5/3/2014,"We killed at least six gnats at our table here today.  They were nice enough to comp my husband's cheesecake, but the gnats sure took our experience down a few notches.  The waitress assured us they are working on the problem.  I sure hope so!"
Kristen B.,"San Antonio, TX",12,41,150,1.0,1/1/2016,"Walked in before the crowd, specifically requested a TABLE for four people, because one in party cannot sit into booth...was told it would be a ten minute wait.  Then, several parties who came in after us were seated before us...at tables.  Hostess called my name and lead us to a booth.  I politely reminded her that we needed a table and a high chair.  We were then put to the end of the list, and told it will now be a 15 minute wait (after already waiting 15 minutes originally).  We love this place because the food is good, come here all the time, tip generously, but today, the front-end service SUCKS.  I plan on speaking to the manager."
Tracy R.,"Portland, TX",10,4,6,4.0,9/25/2015,This was our first time here. There is a lot to choose from on a big menu.I chose the chicken Ceasar salad .I was not dissapointed at all. The portion was huge  and great tasting .My husband chose the spicy chicken sandwich .He loves it and it also was a great portion. For desert we had the caramel turtle cheesecake .Delightful is a fitting word  for it . It was our anniversary  and our waitress decorated  our cheesecake plate and put a candle . We will definitely return!!!!
Sara M.,"San Antonio, TX",28,2,,1.0,4/18/2016,Good not good. Tastes just like your eating at a chilis or Cheaders but paying 3 times the amount! Very disappointed
Teresa H.,"San Antonio, TX",11,46,10,2.0,3/23/2016,When your bill is $200 you expect a good meal. The 4 cheese pasta was undercooked and the white rice in the spicy cashew chicken was hard. The Manager did remove the 4 cheese pasta from the bill. We sent it back so that was the least she could do. She charged us for the pizza we ordered as a replacement (which came out at the same time desserts did). Our waitress was friendly but the manager did not meet nor exceed our expectations tonight. I guess my expectations were too high. We were not thrilled with our experience.
Daniel L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/10/2015,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! Found pieces of metal in our omelet. We decided to go here for breakfast but had a bad experience. Me and my friend decided to share the Chicken Chorizo omelet. After a few bites in I found a piece of metal inside of my omelet. Thankfully I spotted it before I ate it. I immediately stopped eating my breakfast and showed it to my friend. She was shocked and I was going to let our waitress know. Before I had a chance to, my friend took a few more bites of hers since she was hungry and started to choke. She coughed up the food and another piece of metal was found in her piece as well. We had to fill out an incident report. Even though our food was comped it was still a bad experience. Do not eat here. I repeat...DO NOT EAT HERE!"
Summer A.,"Austin, TX",213,178,110,3.0,9/29/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what do you expect? A meal consisting of 2,000 calories that is completely flavorless and overpriced. We received nice service which is always great but I mean, I have never eaten food in San Antonio but I am sure there is better options"
Jack K.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,,2.0,4/1/2016,"As a friend I had from college would say, ""yea right."" Finally went to this place after years of holding off. We ordered different steaks, asked for medium rare, got medium well. Ahi tuna snack plate was tasty, small portion though. Wife ordered asparagus side, got the stock green beans and was still charged for asparagus. Ordered the Splenda cheesecake, was actually damn good, but couldn't make up for dropping 60 bucks on overcooked steak (filet and steak diane).  Our waitress was very nice, a few simple tweaks (get a cook that can make a steak) and this was a good experience. At the prices they charge though, no room for a 30 dollar dry steak.  Best bet is to try somewhere else or just go for dessert."
Sonja B.,"San Antonio, TX",29,344,1,3.0,8/5/2014,"I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in a very long time; however, we were out at La Cantera doing some shopping and got hungry.  1. If there is a negative -- it's that the menu will overwhelm you. I appreciate being able to find all types of food genres, but...this was nuts!  2. The wait staff was top notch. They were better than some high end steakhouses that I'll not be naming.  3. The food was good. Really good. I would have easily had another meal if I could have taken the leftovers home.  4. The location is nice and large.  5. Strollers -- They have an area to leave your stroller in the restaurant. The problem is that it's where everyone is trying to walk through (or so it seems) -- and then I know I saw at least one other stroller just like ours. It made the entrance seem more crowded than necessary.  All in all -- a nice afternoon lunch while shopping."
Valerie H.,"Houston, TX",99,328,97,5.0,10/13/2013,"I never have anything bad to say about cheesecake... It never disappoints!  I've been to so many locations in so many different cities and states, and they are all equally delicious.  The family and I were visiting from Houston, and out of all the different places near our hotel, we stick to what we know!   On a Friday night , the wait was maybe 20 mins, went by fast, and we were seated promptly on the patio. Plenty of fans to keeps us cool in the humid night air. Our server was so exceptionally nice. She was fast and friendly, and made us feel at home. Everything on the menu is good, and I've have almost all of it. Oh, and the 'skinny' menu is actually pretty good. Not the diet tasting stuff like you've probably had before. Anywhere I see a cheesecake, I'll be headed in that direction! FYI, s'mores cheesecake dessert is the way to go!"
