Jenn L.,"Austin, TX",63,96,162,3.0,10/10/2015,"Went on a Saturday night to get some cheesecake. There was no room at the bar to sit at for a quick slice of dessert, so we ordered it to go instead. I ordered the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake ($9), which was delicious, but the two swirls of whipped cream on top were unnecessary, so I removed those.  My friend ordered a Regular Cheesecake (~$8), which also had too much whipped cream for her liking. Overall, a tasty slice of cheesecake, however I do not think the value is worth it. If the cheesecake cost less, I might consider going there more often."
Khristian K.,"Waianae, HI",339,39,29,5.0,7/31/2017,"Definitely worth the wait. Actually they said it was a 30minute wait and there was 4 of us and they got us in before 30. We sat and the service was great. Everyone here is friendly and dressed proper. The manager even delivered our cheesecake which felt like a big deal. He even mentioned how it was national Cheesecake day and suggested some for us. I love seeing high management work side by side with their staff. Our waitress got nervous because we were talking with the manager, but really he was so friendly. It's so good we decided to come back the next day for another half off Cheesecake. Super glad we came to this location!"
Brandy P.,"San Antonio, TX",60,23,10,1.0,10/30/2017,"My family and I tried to visit this location to celebrate a birthday. Needless to say we were treated rudely by both the manager and hostess on duty the night of 10/26/17. After being awkwardly stared at the hostess (who apparently was not pleased she had to end her conversation with another employee) finally walks up to me and asks how many. She walks away looks around the restaurant for a bit then speaks with the manager. This man then comes to tell me all the big tables had just been sat and that he would have to split our party up. It was a Thursday night and dead in the place, empty tables everywhere and staff standing in corners. Our party was 6 adults and 2 kids. I've worked in the industry. I know why the manager came up with the sorry excuse as to not seat us. NEVER giving this place my money again. We went next door to YARD HOUSE instead and ended up with great service and an amazing server. This location's food isn't even that great just tried to take my little brother here since he likes it. Thanks for giving us all a reason NOT to come back."
Annie M.,"San Antonio, TX",205,40,26,2.0,6/13/2017,"Disappointed that I ordered breakfast pancakes to go and got no syrup and after Calling and speaking to a manager who insisted that he would contact me back regarding this issues, has still yet to contact me...."
Sarah G.,"San Antonio, TX",17,75,64,5.0,1/8/2017,"Wow I can't believe the hubby and I don't come here more often. We came with a large group of 9 and were told the wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes or we could be seated immediately on the patio. Normally I would love sitting outside but this was a ridiculously cold SA night and we waited for inside seats. We were seated in about 45 minutes and the manager was really good about keeping us updated on our wait time. I don't remember our waiters name but he was very good! Great service. They did get one persons order wrong (they brought out a club instead of Cuban sandwich) but they comped it. We had three appetizers the sweet corn tamale, avocado egg rolls and mac and cheese balls. They were all amazing! Really surprised by the tamale and definitely a MUST try. The cheese balls are a sophisticated grown up version of a kid favorite. I had the bacon bacon burger and the bacon was crispy and so thick and flavorful. I got the sweet potato fries and they were delish. I had suggested the place in order to use a holiday gift card :P but it was a total hit and we will definitely be back with friends soon!!!"
Rudy D.,"Medical Center, San Antonio, TX",14,4,3,2.0,12/9/2016,Worst experience ever. What was supposed to be a 20 minute wait was an hour. Waitress was ok but never around. Ordered some apps and they didn't get our nachos right. Then brought them with our meal. Who wants a meal and app at the same time! Then my 5 year old bit down on some wood from the spices they use in her spaghetti. We got comped the spaghetti but she could have really hurt herself. Oh and they gave her a scoop of ice cream for her mouth to stop hurting. I will never come back here!
Veronica A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,2.0,8/9/2017,"This review is not directed at the food, but to the ability to make reservations. Their website states, ""Large parties can reserve for an early lunch immediately after we open (11 or 11:30AM) or for dining during quieter times such as weekday afternoons (3 - 6PM) or after 9PM. "" Last I heard Fridays are considered a weekday. Wanted to reserve for 15 people for my daughter's 19th birthday on a Friday at 5pm. I was told they only took reservations the for the first hour they are open. Very disappointing."
Sherry M.,"San Antonio, TX",9,14,6,5.0,4/6/2016,"What a great last minute date I had with my honey of 40+ years. This place is amazing! Not only is the menu massive but the proportions are as well. You can easily share a plate with your date. The catfish is like no other catfish you've had. The breading is like fried chicken. All I needed was a waffle! The size of the fish isn't those skinny little filets. They are fat and moist! Are you hungry now? The corn that comes with this plate is very delicious. The green beans are as well, but I wish they were cooked a little more. I like a little crunch, not a lot of crunch. And the Cheesecake? Well I don't want to go there because you will need to clean up your drool. The only little disappointment was we never got our bread nor were we ever offered it."
GiGi B.,"San Antonio, TX",93,19,12,4.0,7/16/2017,Few probs but so satisfying when the manager takes an honest approach!  Food and drinks always spot on!
Tammy S.,"Decatur, MS",40,5,3,2.0,7/30/2017,"Only reason for two stars is... the cheesecake is worth a ""reasonable"" wait. Not 30-45minutes.  I had to use the ladies restroom during this wait and it was stylish, but not enough to hide the fact that it had not been attended to in several hours. No proper products to use.  Not fun when you're subjected to using a seat tissue cover as a quick fix. I am glad I noticed the floor as wet before I stepped in. I at least did not have to drag my linen dress across the questionable floor.  I went inform a manager, but he was too busy ""holding court"" to let me advise him of the facilities conditions.  This particular CF is in an area of the stores such as Tiffany's, Stuart Weitzman, Neiman Marcus, Rolex, and many others that command excellent service to capture the prices marked on these items.  Very disappointed with my experience at this iconic restaurant."
Kirk M.,"Decatur, MS",0,13,1,1.0,7/30/2017,Excellent cheesecakes but the service is lacking. 30-45 minute wait for a to-go slice of cheesecake is ridiculous. Additionally no toilet paper in their filthy female bathroom. When your wife has to use a seat liner....unacceptable. It seems the staff cannot handle the customer flow which is an indication of poor management. This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have been to in more than a dozen trips across the country.
Dominique S.,"Fort Worth, TX",72,15,12,4.0,7/6/2016,"Nice location in the center of the shopping center.   The service was great and speedy. We sat outside on the patio, and out of nowhere, it begins to pour!! The hostess was nice enough to find us a new DRY table inside.  The food was good. For all my vegans, they have a nice selection of options. I got the Vegan Cobb salad and swapped out veggies for some of my favs. My drink, the Georgia Peach, was amazing. Frozen goodness."
A C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,3.0,2/8/2017,"Had a bad experience at North Star and thought to give The Cheesecake Factory a second chance at this location. PRO:  Seated as soon as we arrived in a clean booth with clean utensils this time. Waitress came promptly to get our drinks and food orders. Food came fast. CON: We had a waitress come to take our drink order, then a waiter showed up a minute after to take our drinks and when we told him someone else had already taken it, he walked away saying ""Wow, that's great..."" sarcastically. Husbands pork chop was dry and mashed potatoes were bland. Ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps since there was no chicken parmesan, would be nice to put in the menu that there is cilantro (I can't eat this stuff) This is what the menu says ""Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew."" Had to carefully make sure I picked out each piece big and small. MORE OF THE OK SIDE: I was really excited for the chicken parmesan pizza style, only to find out they were all out, I understood since they said this was a ""good dish"". Ordered a Tiramisu cake, it was good, but for $9?  Overall, not what I expected from ""The Cheesecake Factory"" that everyone talks about. This would be a very occasional eat for me."
Amber S.,"San Antonio, TX",14,125,49,4.0,3/20/2016,"We love the Cheesecake Factory but rarely go because the one at Northstar has horrible service from the second you walk in the door, and this one is in a direction we don't often head towards. Today, however, it was our daughters 10th birthday and she wanted Cheesecake Factory.  Upon arrival we were told there would be a 25 minute wait. No problem. Except... The wait turned into 40 minutes and the hostess seated a party before us with the same amount of people as ours that checked in 10 minutes after us. When I asked about it they said no. They were here first. But being my daughters birthday and all I let it slide. That was the worse part. Let's just say the hostess doesn't need to be in the customer service industry. At least have the guts to admit you messed up. Lying to me, or any customer, is not cool. Especially when I was sitting right there the entire time.  Now for the service. Our waiter was phenomenal!!!! He was friendly and very good with our kiddos. The drinks were refilled promptly and he made sure my little boy had his food first while we enjoyed appetizers. He was just overall a great server.  The 4 stars are all about him. ------The minus a star... All for the lying hostess.  Will still go back tho. Great service counts."
Kimberly R.,"Houston, TX",3,22,,1.0,4/6/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory. I go often in my hometown of Houston. This Cheesecake Factory was very bad. We were seated very quickly but the server was very rude. So much so that we ended up leaving without ordering.
ShaNele F.,"Richmond, TX",191,74,77,4.0,11/10/2016,Stopped here while I was out of town for work for dinner. And we were excited for the happy hour but we had to order happy hour in the bar :( and walk back to our table. I ordered the bistro shrimp which was amazing!! I got the shrimp grilled not fried! Very light and fulfilling :)
Robin Y.,"San Antonio, TX",13,32,2,4.0,5/3/2017,"I know I should review the service too but the hell with that I came here for the Cheesecake, there are none of these back in Detroit so, I kind of went wild. I ordered the salted Carmel, yes, yes, and hell yes. The key lime cheesecake was so good that I know that I am going straight to hell because I just had my slice of heaven on earth, lol. But the star of the show was the Carmel pecan, turtle cheesecake, OMG, so rich and dense, and just perfect, every bite was worth whatever price my husband paid, just divine."
Valentina M.,"Montgomery, AL",28,25,48,4.0,11/16/2016,"My husband took me to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday. We just moved to San Antonio from Italy where he was stationed with the military so this was my first ever cheese cake factory experience and I really liked it. I like the way the restaurant look, it looks like an expensive restaurant in a way when it's actually really not. Our server was super nice and I enjoyed the appetizer and the dessert. I can't say I loved my entree though... I go the eggplant parmesan... and I have to tell you a secret: it's nothing like the real Italian eggplant Parmesan, it's a greasy mess in comparison to the real deal :D other than that I wish they had more vegetarian options on the menu but I'll for sure come back because I loved this place for its ambiance and for the amazing super long cheesecake menu!"
Dominique E.,"Round Rock, TX",2,21,26,3.0,3/2/2016,Love the food. I have a problem with the waiters. I am in my twenties and I feel the younger you are the worse they treat you.  This is not Jaspers It's the Cheesecake Factory treat customers fairly.
Adiel R.,"San Antonio, TX",93,10,31,4.0,4/21/2017,"Food is as expected, very good.  Great atmosphere excellent server! Wait time for a Friday not bad at all."
