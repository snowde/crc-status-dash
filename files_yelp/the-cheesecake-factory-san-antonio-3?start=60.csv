Jeff K.,"Boerne, TX",23,27,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Terrible service here. Me and my wife visited this location on a night that was not very busy and we received extremely slow service. The table we were sat at wasn't cleaned well but I didn't say anything only because I didn't want anything done to my food. Each time the waitress came to check on us she gave us rude stares and every time I said thank you when she brought our refills she didn't acknowledge and just walked away. I was mistreated the waitress seemed to have feelings of entitlement because she was super angry when she wasn't tipped well for her poor, slow and rude service. This place has a track record of hiring criminals, shortly after my visit my car was vandalized by the staff here. I received a private message from a waitress here on Facebook telling me that's what I get for not tipping well. They talk bad about their customers as soon as they cannot hear. Don't go to this location ever if you want a nice meal with good service. They will take too long to bring your order the food doesn't even taste fresh. I've never in my life been to any restaurant less professional than this one."
Trisha S.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,5.0,9/16/2017,"Janessa is the best server in the whole damn Cheesecake Factory chain! My cup of lemonade was never close to empty. She is the sweetest damn person in the whole place too. Great service, she was fast and super efficient. If I ever come back to San Antonio and go to this cheesecake factory I hope I get here again."
Kourtney D.,"Harker Heights, TX",0,11,1,3.0,4/25/2017,"When my boyfriend and I first got there it took 35 minutes to get bread ( mind you it wasn't busy) and we were starving. The first dish I got ( shrimp Alfredo) was horrible. The shrimp was over done. Not to mention the server was talking to my boyfriend and I like little kids. ( we are both 20 and we were all dressed up for our date) when I told her about the food I just told her not to worry about it and I would eat the pasta, instead she snatched my plate and decided we could play tug of war with my plate. So then I called the manager, Jeff I believe?? He was super nice and understanding and instead ordered me a entire different dish which was delicious and the only reason I can rate this place 3 stars."
Karla S.,"Georgetown, TX",3,22,20,1.0,3/15/2017,"Our dining experience was less than enjoyable because of our waitress. The entree portion sizes are huge so we asked for the leftovers from our two dishes to be boxed. When we ordered our deserts, our waitress said she was going to bring them out in to-go containers. I told her twice that it wasn't necessary but she apparently didn't listen to me. Another waitstaff brought our to-go deserts to the table boxed and bagged and it was a bit embarrassing having to un-bag them and eat out of a to-go container. Their cheesecakes are good but not worth the embarrassment."
Angela F.,"San Antonio, TX",493,464,1669,4.0,9/17/2014,"We've been in a happy hour rut lately so my friend suggested Cheesecake Factory since once upon a time he loved their mai tais. Great happy hour, but, pretty sparse crowd... I enjoyed quite a few $5 cosmopolitans....yum. My friend tried just about every other drink offered on the hh menu: Long Island iced tea, margarita, some kinda spiked lemonade, & one more that I'm forgetting. The cosmo was the clear winner, in my opinion.  Selected apps are also $5 each....we started with the avocado egg rolls. Good, but the cumin in them tasted out of place...and I love cumin. The fried mac & cheese was amazing...be sure to dip into the delish vodka sauce on the plate! The tamale corn cakes were also sweet, moist & yum...I honestly could've done without all the topping and just eaten the cake. Finally, the mini corn dogs were good (we had an odd craving for corn dogs?!). The bad: screaming, screeching KIDS. Ugh. Two at two different tables made everyone miserable for at least a few hours. Not the restaurant's fault or control but c'mon parents. After a while, we wished a tumble onto the marble floor (yes, we are terrible people....but I'm sure we weren't the only ones...)"
Amber G.,"Lubbock, TX",40,56,21,3.0,7/29/2016,Really good bread. Seems busy a lot. Our server was great had such a good time I got a chicken dish that came with broccoli and mashed potatoes.
Jessica T.,"San Pablo, CA",89,103,48,5.0,8/5/2016,"This is by far one of my most favorite cheese cake factory. Every thing was perfect. Our server, who I regrettably forgot his name was awesome!!! But I do remember it was his birthday the night we came in on July 28th.  It was him that made my whole experience enjoyable. I felt disappointed for him that he was working on the night of his birthday, but he didn't seem to mind it one bit. Through out the whole night, I saw him helping and checking on his guests with smiles and enthusiasm. As always, I order the Louisiana Pasta. The pasta itself is always a hit or miss depending on locations and who happens to be chef that night I guess. But at this location, the service was a hit and the food was a hit!"
Mike F.,"San Antonio, TX",2,78,15,1.0,12/30/2016,"One  star is generous for this location.  Restaurant is overly busy and very crowded with people waiting for tables almost everywhere in the lobby and through the entrance doors.  Staff were plentiful but seemed to congregate in groups laughing joking and being overheard talking about the last nights ""adult festivities"".  Look we are all adults, but I don't want to hear your romantic details as I'm eating because I happen to be sat next to the server station and computer.  I was sat quick with a party of two but that is about the only glue that held this trip together.  My individual server was nice, smiled, and had a friendly demeanor however, she seemed ultra busy and sadly like  she was one of the few selected to actually work and not congregate.  I had an issue with food coming out near a raw state.  The waitress took care of it immediately but the manager stood looking at me and my table and didn't even greet us nor address the kitchen problem.  The gentleman seemed like he was too busy to address any of the staff or customers.  Several employees went to speak to him and he judging from what I heard and how the employee reacted, just brushed them off.  Now to the quality of food-  cheese pizza was the greasiest thing I have seen.  My dining guest stated ""it's like they just put a block of cheese on the bread it's way too much for a cheese pizza"".  The pizza wasn't even cut.  The second entree was a $15 hamburger it came out slightly cold and super red.  It may have been seared on the outside but it was raw from the point on.  The burger was sitting in so much grease the buns were soggy and could no longer soak up the grease.  The burger was sent back and recooked.  What they did was shocking-  they used the same rAw burger recooked it repositioned it in my plate same soggy bottom  bun.  I had cut the burger in half the kitchen repositioned it and replaced the top bun so as to not appear to be the same.   I passed on eating it really but we ordered two slices of cheesecake which were good.  Then again is t this the Cheesecake Factory?  For $7.95 the slice of cheesecake from the cheesecake place should be good.  That doesn't wipe away the fact that the whole dining experience at $15 for a hamburger and fries was not even given with the level of service McDonald's would give.  Overall the bill was 60-70 bucks after a tip (yeah I paid for the once raw secondly refired and soaked in grease burger) but I certainly will not return.  The sad thing is, I had never been to this restaurant before.  I was a first time diner.  Since I eat higher end places frequently I could have been a multiple time diner."
Derek M.,"Seattle, WA",4,100,1,2.0,6/29/2016,"Gotta say I was a bit disappointed with my visit at this location. Been coming to Cheesecake Factory most of my life, ordering the Chicken Masala each time, and it's always been one of my favorite 'treat yourself' meals. Getting it at this location though...it was just all very soggy and bland. Lacked seasoning and didn't have the same savory flavor I've had dozens of times before, and the noodles were very overdone and mushy. I was pretty hungry so I continued eating it, but halfway through it really started feeling pretty gross. Kind of expect more for a $20 entree."
Steve O.,"Northwest Side, San Antonio, TX",0,5,2,1.0,6/9/2017,Well to let all CHL owners know they have recently added a 30.06 and 30.07 sign. For that reason we traded to a different restaurant this evening. All 7 of us.  They cant protect me and won't allow me to protect myself and family.  For this reason this restaurant will be taken off our list of places to eat.
Jr G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,31,2,5.0,3/10/2017,"I've been dining at this location since it opened about four years ago everything here is really good I've been dating at cheesecake factories all over the United States for a long time and I continue to be a loyal client some of the reviews on here are from petty petty individuals just nit picking ...The food quality is usually 9of 10 !!! Love the food,the staff do a good job Katie and Jennifer are the are the most pleasant and knowledgeable about food menu."
Haley H.,"Salado, TX",13,5,389,2.0,7/31/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory but this was a terrible experience. Were told we had a 25-30 minute wait, but ended up having to wait an hour & 15 minutes. Also, we ordered French toast off of the Sunday brunch menu, but they were out of French toast. Disappointing because the one day they actually serve French toast, they're out."
Leslie M.,"Killeen, TX",0,10,2,1.0,1/13/2017,SERVICE IS INSANELY SLOW..... 45 minutes for lettuce wraps. Wtf.......... sitting in the restaurant and debating walking out. My waiter hasn't even offered more bread. He just looks at our table.
Ed R.,"Houston, TX",1,191,573,3.0,6/23/2016,"Good place to celebrate with appetizers or share family style as portion are very big. Usually very busy with tourists visiting the mall or amusement park in the same nook so if your a local know that it gets loco. Staff very good but they are very overwhelming with the demands so they spend very little time on being personable with you and it comes across as bad. We like to get appetizers and salads and share ending with cake of course. Decor a bit on the Trump side but very clean of course they can focus on keeping it crisp if they can learn the art of the restaurant deal""Team!""."
Josh M.,"Tomball, TX",109,22,9,3.0,1/17/2017,"Came here for my birthday party with some co-workers. We asked for a large table and the manager was very quick to tell us it would take ""2 hours"" to get a table. (It's a Tuesday night at 7pm the restaurant is not crowded) not wanting to leave and reorientate the group we sat at different tables around the place totally killing the birthday vibe. I do want to commend the waitress on being very friendly and even going the extra step on getting me a candle and the posse to sing happy birthday. There was just 0 attempt to let us sit together, nor any hospitality for our large group aside from our waitresses."
Neil L.,"Winchester, VA",49,42,38,4.0,6/25/2016,"Our server, Jazz, was great. I had the bacon bacon cheeseburger and it was really good. This is my 2nd visit here and this dining experience was better than the 1st. Restaurant was clean. Good was a bit pricey but worth it."
Renata S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,5.0,1/29/2017,"This was our family's first visit to the Cheesecake Factory and it was an outstanding experience! The menu selection was out of this world. As a vegetarian, I found many veggie options. I chose the avocado egg rolls and they were warm and delicious! They came with a dipping sauce that was just right. My husband had a chicken avocado mango salad with a wonderful dressing that was delicate and complimented the dish nicely. The complimentary bread they serve is superb! The server was very informative, pleasant, patient and very helpful. Beautiful experience for a Sunday lunch. We highly recommend it!"
Desma G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,39,,5.0,6/26/2017,"Service is great, out seating is very nice, food is so good,we can't forget about the cheesecake, a dessert so many of us know and love. But let's talk about the cocktails, strong but still really good. What's going to bring me back here time and time again are the martinis. I tried a few different ones and they are intensely fruity yet you know you are having a cold strong martini. The Orange is intense like zest but perfectly sweet. The pear is aromatic and of course the lemon drop. Can't wait to try more flavors. Probably not safe to try them all in one sitting but I will be back to try the strawberry and cosmopolitan"
P. D.,"San Antonio, TX",35,20,6,2.0,3/30/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory has a nice atmosphere and fits well within the upscale Shops At La Cantera.  Service was good and like all other locations, there's a full bar.  The problem?  The beef dip sandwich.   It looked good when it was placed in front of me.  But the ""beef"" in question was about 70% meat, 30% fat and gristle.  I repeatedly had to take chunks of fat out of my mouth while trying to eat.  The aus jus added flavor, but was useless with such a gross sandwich.  It was painfully obvious that this was made with deliberately inedible beef.   I was a guest of a friend, so I chose not to complain.  A mistake on my part in retrospect.  So instead, I thought I'd spread the word that this restaurant is just fine with serving poor quality food to its customers.  I won't return, but I personally recommend going somewhere else nearby for lunch or dinner, but coming here solely for dessert.  That's the one area where they probably won't go wrong."
Bader A.,"Irvine, CA",2,12,5,5.0,1/10/2016,This is a restaurant to go to when you are a party with different taste for food they are truly have an international menu. Love their Sunday Brunch and wish they would have it everyday. Their cheesecake is by far the best cheesecake ever.
