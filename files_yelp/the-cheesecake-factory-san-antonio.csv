Dennis S.,"San Antonio, TX",201,112,1421,4.0,1/4/2018,"The cheesecake factory is all about decadence.  Yes, it's a chain restaurant that's located inside a mall, and yes, there's normally a 30-60 minute wait depending on the day.  But the food portions are all about the ""WoW"" factor.  The average plate is priced between $15-20, but two people can honestly share one dinner plate and all its high calorie, salty, and fatty goodness.  Chicken Madeira was for dinner tonight and it was delightful. The wine based sauce, button mushrooms, and mozzarella. Ending the dinner with a piece of cheesecake is a must! The hard part is deciding which to choose from the wide variety of choices."
Cathy C.,"San Antonio, TX",229,22,24,3.0,12/29/2017,"One of my most favorite restaurants ever, but the Korean fried cauliflower is a bust.  I  cauliflower but all I can taste is greasy batter & Korean sauce. The sauce is amazing. The dish isn't.  Waiting on the Thai Lettuce Wrap, now that's a winner!!"
Santiago G.,"Houston, TX",1,6,,2.0,12/17/2017,"This was at the North Star mall location. Well where do I start. Took over an hour to get seated. Finally did get seated and took about 10 more minutes to get our drink order. Food was great but what good is it if you can't get seated. Been to Galleria location and Woodlands. And have never had any issues. Get it together guys. You have a reputation to uphold in all areas. So, the Cheesecake Factory Representative replied to me and suggested that I go eat earlier or later than lunch time on the weekend. We got there at 1:40. I know this because of the valet text. I don't think the reply was intended to be rude, but it did come across as such. I was told 30 minute wait. If I would have known 1 hour 15 minutes. I would have eaten at the food court. I eat out everyday as part of my job. In establishments as good as or better than this one. It's all the same to me. I Never had these issues at the Galleria or Woodlands in Houston, and they are always flooded with guest."
Bailey N.,"San Antonio, TX",54,240,82,3.0,12/2/2017,"Not the best experience last night, but a very nice lady (assuming a manager) saved it.  About 7p, seated at a small table in the bar area (not the quiet little table you hope for, but I digress); it was getting busy.  Took too long for our waitress to even make initial contact. It went downhill from there. Ordered calamari appetizer and our meals.  Noticed people seated around us, and around the same time as us...start getting their food, etc. A good 20min post order, the manager (I'm assuming) came over. We were about to call her over anyway.  Seems our waitress ""dropped our order"" (put it in computer?) LATE....it was going to be another 10 or so minutes. Oh, and the calamari order? Never even made it.  I would have been totally pissed had the manager not taken control and done her best to make it right. She ended up giving us the calamari free.  Then, my gal ended up with a meal that included a potential allergen we feel should have been made clearer on the menu (don't worry, we are contacting corporate). The manager was understanding and she took that meal off our bill as well.  Although our waitress was MIA most of the meal (we saw the manager lady more), she did apologize to us, but we had the feeling she stayed away out of fear we were super pissed. Mistakes happen, but GOD don't hide from them! Had it not been for the Manager's intervention in our evening...this would have been a hellacious review."
Tori E.,"San Antonio, TX",15,37,103,4.0,10/3/2017,"I've been to this location a couple of times & have tried many things off the menu. I'm not a big fan of their food, but their cheesecake is amazing!  The service is pretty good too, when it gets packed, patience is key. The majority of the waiters/waitresses are very kind & have great customer service skills. Whenever I am waited on & have exceptional service (even in cases when I don't like my food) I always make sure to tell the manager & give the servers the credit they deserve ESPECIALLY when it's busy. You have to appreciate their hustle!  As many other yelpers have stated the Cheesecake Factory is overhyped & over priced, but they do get their cheesecake right. It's the only reason I'm rating this place so high. I am a classic soul & stick to the plain cheesecake, I don't like steering far away from what I like, but on one particular visit I was recommended trying their coffee cheesecake... All I can say is WOW! It was so smooth & tasted exactly like coffee.  I will keep returning to the Cheesecake Factory specifically for dessert purposes!"
Linda F.,"San Antonio, TX",17,63,343,4.0,6/28/2017,"The wait was totally worth it! We went Tuesday evening and according to the staff this is one of their busiest days of the week. We were entertained by the beautiful photos of various menu items displayed on two large TV screens just above the Cheesecake counter. This was actually extremely helpful because seeing all their sensational dishes displayed so prominently helped us decide what to order before we were even seated.  We also noticed the plethora (love having the opportunity to use that word) of Gluten Free menu options available on both their traditional menu, Skinnylicous menu, and the KIDS menu. Hoooooray!!! They went far beyond chicken tenders, hot dogs or mac and cheese too which impressed me.  We ordered the Grilled Salmon for our GF toddler, which included carrots and their famous mashed potatoes. It was a tough choice for our son who wanted to order everything on his little menu. They accidentally prepared the Grilled Chicken but we opted to keep it, and it was thoroughly enjoyed by one very hungry 4yr old. We added a side of Gluten Free French Fried that were also great to have as an option.   My Husband ordered his usual Chicken Madeira dish which is highly popular and for good reason.  I had my heart set on the ""steak cauliflower"" which was a vegetarian option and mostly because I was curious to see what a steak of cauliflower looked like. Unfortunately they had sold out of this dish...wow it must be good...so we asked Kery to recommend an alternative. He suggested the Eggplant Parmesan and shared that he is not a fan of eggplants but this was an amazingly delicious meal he often enjoyed.  SOLD! He was one hundred percent correct. The huge portion served eggplant cut into small discs and included a generous portion of their angel hair Pesto pasta. Delicious! Not too salty or greasy or crunchy.  We truly enjoyed our meals and had plenty to take home. I look forward to trying the cauliflower steak next time but am glad that though it was in absentia, I was able to try another entre I probably would not have chosen otherwise. We also plan to get the GF grilled Salmon for our son next time.  L."
Sabine F.,"Cibolo, TX",89,428,1265,4.0,9/9/2017,"This was my second time at the Cheesecake Factory. I had the turkey burger and my nephew had the burger. The portions were large and we left full. We also took home a cheesecake, the original. It was ono delicious."
Nydia G.,"Brownsville, TX",2,28,45,4.0,12/13/2017,"First time coming here and wasn't dissapointed! Steak is great and juicy, and the chicken Alfredo is great as well! The Cheesecake was amazing!! Definitely coming back"
Blair M.,"San Antonio, TX",31,43,208,5.0,8/30/2017,"We tried this location as a quick, convenient way to gather friends for a pre birthday dinner.  I ordered a breaded buffalo chicken sandwich and added a macaroni & cheese ball on top because I'm extra like that. I ordered white wine and piña coladas to go with it. Yummy as always, and they were very accommodating for my large party of 14 (2 more showed up later, so 16!)"
Kay J.,"San Antonio, TX",569,281,658,5.0,1/20/2017,"Came here tonight to celebrate my son's new job - just for cheesecake.  Yummy!!! We shared three pieces amongst 4 people and even brought some home, the slices were huge!  Our server was also so sweet.  My daughter had just come from 4 hours of dance and looked exhausted- our server brought her a basket of bread to lift her blood sugar while we waited for our desserts and was so nice to her. We ordered:  1. Vanilla Bean- AAmazing!! Like vanilla ice cream but cheesecake!   2. Chocolate Tuxedo- Rich, fudgy and delicious!   3. Lemon Raspberry- Cool, Refreshing and sweet! So yummy!"
Ken O.,"San Antonio, TX",46,2,,1.0,1/7/2018,"First of all we had to wait your and half for a table. They put all of us in separate booths.  But, the main thing was the Ribeye.  Here was a nice size Steak, but maybe an eighth was edible.  The rest was not edible. I ask to see the Manager.  I ask for them to adjust the bill.  They refused.  We went round and round, kept refusing.  They did not want to discuss it, and finally I decided that my combat PTSD was about to be affected, I decided it was not worth it."
Steph B.,"Katy, TX",213,345,1541,3.0,12/12/2016,"Uhg Great service and ambiance. Really nice location in the North Star Mall. Demo, why is the food so bad? Are all Cheesecake Factories like this? I do not eat a Cheesecake Factory often but recall they had good burgers, salads and of course ... desserts.  Service from the hostess station through checkout was exemplary. I recommend asking for Taylor to serve you. She was pleasant and helped my wife narrow down what she should try for lunch. Our food came out timely and well served.  It is unfortunately the food that was disappointing here. We started with our traditional calamari appetizer. That was served with tarter and cocktail sauce. I quickly asked for a side of marinara sauce. I never liked cocktail sauce. The calamari was obviously fried in old oil and maybe pulled out of the deep fry early. So it was mushy and had a multiplicity of flavors, none of them becoming.    Sandwiches were not better. My crispy shrimp sandwich was served on an obviously burnt and scraped bun. Oh well, I try not to eat bread any way. It wasn't long before I discovered why the calamari tasted off. Certainly they fry the shrimp and maybe chicken in the same oil. And the adjective ""crispy"" is an unfortunate miss.  My wife's steak sandwich was also sad.  Well we ordered side salads anyway and both started in on those. Hey, this is just lettuce with one tomato wedge!   Without protein in our system we both chose to skip dessert.  On departing I realized that I was happy that we only spent $50 on a lunch that we didn't eat and that at least I don't feel like I over ate. So that pleasant thought and the great service bumped Cheesecake Factory from. 2 to 3 star rating!"
Maria R.,"North Central, San Antonio, TX",46,48,135,4.0,9/27/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory!! There are so many different dishes and cheesecakes, there's something for everyone. Today I came in with a friend who got out of work early, the place was pretty empty because of the hour. We came in right before happy hour which kind of sucked because I didn't even know they had happy hour, although the prices don't seem too different. I didn't any pics just one of our appetizer, loaded baked potato tots, Sandy loves potato tots so this were perfect. They were really hot but inside there was some creamy cheese with some bacon and on the side it came with cream and some sort of spicy mayo. Sandy had the pasta napoletana and I had one of my faves, steak Diane. We didn't have any space left for cheesecake so we decided to come another time only for the cheesecake. Overall we had a good lunch, it would've been better if I knew there was a happy hour, but that was on me."
Amanda F.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",178,18,,2.0,12/1/2017,The food was okay. It wasn't exquisite. A bit pricey. I found a hair in my food and was disgusted! Especially since I was feeding it to my one year old! They made me another one but didn't discount it or anything....this Cheesecake Factory disappointed me in many aspects. I won't be planning on eating here again.
Steph C.,"Sugar Land, TX",264,227,970,5.0,9/20/2016,"I had a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory! I was my first time so I was excited to try it. Everything was delicious and the service was great. The wait was super long but me and my boyfriend got lucky to find a table in the bar area where there is no wait sometimes, you see a open area you can  take it.  For an appetizer we had the fried calamari and the firecracker salmon. The firecracker salmon was so unique and different I wanted more! The calamari was a little salty but still good.  For my meal I had the tomato basil pasta.  It was so fresh and delicious. You can taste all the ingredients in the pasta. One of the best pasta's I have had. My boyfriend loved everything as well.  I also can't forget about the dessert, I had the fresh strawberry cheesecake. Not bad at all.  I was so stuffed by the time I left but it was so worth it! I will definitely be back!"
Susan C.,"San Antonio, TX",200,472,759,4.0,9/1/2016,"Tried the stuffed chicken tortillas. Think really big soft tacos.  Three overstuffed corn tortillas filled with seasoned shredded white meat chicken. Topped with a savory cream sauce and pico de gallo.  Comes with black beans and corn cakes. The cakes are really good - made from corn masa and slightly sweet. Tasty. Also offered as an appetizer.  Elisa our server was just the right amount of attentiveness, despite being pretty busy. Our drinks never went empty. A good night."
Tony L.,"San Marcos, TX",12,5,,5.0,12/2/2017,Let me be 100% upfront here -- this review is ONLY for the lemon raspberry cheesecake. It is amazing! We've had it a dozen times and it's the only reason we go to CF. :)
Amber D.,"Anchorage, AK",105,118,68,4.0,8/31/2017,"I always find this place awesome. Atmosphere is nice and quiet, and I find the prices reasonable for a huge chain restaurant. I got the herb crusted salmon and it's always good. Salmon was cooked perfectly and so were the asparagus. I'll come back for sure."
Allen G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,35,3,1.0,8/11/2017,Service was terrible. Food had no flavor. Our waiter did not pay any attention to us we had to flag him down with everything we needed. I wonder if he needed help we have 8 in our family and he had a few more families. At the end of dinner we had to go look for him to close out our bill and i saw 3 other families standing waiting for him to close out their bills. I hear him tell one of them that I went to  your table to see if you were ready for me and you said no. The man said I am ready now and the waiter turned towards me and rolled his eyes.  And the cheese cake was the only thing good from what my kids tell me. I was done with being at this restaurant after the long wait for those cakes. I will not recommended this restaurant to my family and friends i just hope if they go they have a better experience.
Paul S.,"Town Lake, Austin, TX",29,119,303,3.0,3/15/2017,"Decent American chain restaurant food, salty, savory, mmmm.  If you're looking for something heart stoppingly rich come here.  This location is showing it's age and cleanliness leaves a little to be desired but otherwise okay, just okay."
Amanda C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/21/2017,"This was the worst experience I've ever had dining. I ordered the California guacamole salad and asked for no corn. When I received my salad 20 min later they gave me corn and no black beans. The manager came and said he'd have another made and expedite my salad. After waiting an additional 10 minutes I get a salad back that was just lettuce tomato and the avocado dressing. The manager brings some of the salad items and when I mention it was missing all of the items he asked me, ""what do you want me to do??"" I said to forget it since my party was already done with their food. My server, who was very nice, offered me a slice of cheesecake for my troubles which I declined. The manager never came back to apologize."
Mitch E.,"San Antonio, TX",318,159,265,3.0,2/28/2017,"Tucked away in North Star mall, this Cheesecake Factory is cozy with lots of seating. The service is a monotone friendly if that makes sense. No one moves with a lot of urgency though the servers are attentive to the table. The crab wontons were quite excellent. I was disappointed in the chicken nuggets because they were incredibly salty and I couldn't finish them. The cheesecake was delicious! I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if the calorie count wasn't next to every menu item. I mean, seriously, why would I buy more if that's on the menu?!! It's Cheesecake Factory not Guilt Factory. Anyway, it's Mardi Gras and I'm glad I got to be glutinous here."
Brittney D.,"Dallas, TX",172,100,127,4.0,8/15/2016,"Always a great experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Reservations are encouraged but not required. (I'm always seated within 10 mins, w/o reservation.)  Bread lovers, definitely give their bread/butter a try. So yum! As for dinner, the only entree I can vouch for is their Steak Diane: mashed potatoes, angus beef steak, covered in black peppercorns & a rich mushroom wine sauce. It's the only plate I order with a side of grilled asparagus. Unfortunately I never leave room for dessert.  I'll have to stop by to pick up a slice or two of cheesecake to-go one day."
Anna K.,"San Antonio, TX",44,76,51,5.0,6/6/2017,"My mom and I decided to dine in this past Sunday afternoon. There was a 25 minute wait, so we were smart and decided to sit at the bar! So glad we did. We had excellent service from Charlie and Corina. I had a glass of wine but my mom went for the mojito. It was delicious, freshly muddled mint and lime and not too sweet - perfect taste. We were going to get the grilled artichoke as appetizer, but since it is a seasonal option, it was unavailable. But our bartenders got us extra fresh bread and butter out. For dinner, I had a bone in NY Strip, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My mom had a small Greek salad and the Cuban Rolls. I didn't try the salad, but the rolls were amazing! I will definitely order those as an appetizer in the future. Our food was out fast and we were in and out in about an hour. Very great experience altogether."
Sawyer J.,"Arlington, TX",1,7,,3.0,12/21/2017,"There's something for everyone, the menu is a bit too extensive in that nothing is really mind blowing but everything is pretty good."
Cassandra C.,"San Antonio, TX",83,70,151,4.0,6/17/2017,"Yes it's a chain, but you can count on the quality every time.  The only issue is it is always so crowded - hence four stars.  Tip - head directly to bar area and see if the high tops are free - open seating and great service!  We had Dorothy as our waitress and she was amazing!!!  I was never without tea!  She was also very helpful with menu suggestions.  We came in for dessert but told her we love the bread too, so she brought it to us while we waited for our Linda's Chocolate fudge cake!  She told it was the most decadent!  It is indeed.  We also asked her to split it for us - and it was more than enough for us.  She even split the bill for us without us even asking!!  Top notch service, decadent Choco cake, tea always full, and freshly brewed coffee just for us!! Thank you Dorothy!  Great experience!"
Felise F.,"San Antonio, TX",99,107,181,3.0,12/18/2016,"I'm a little back & forth on the rating for today's experience. 3.5 feels more appropriate. We went to try the Sunday brunch menu around 11:30 and were seated quite promptly. Our waitress was nice, but not as attentive as I believe she could've been. We only saw her twice after receiving our food from somebody else, and that was when she wordlessly plopped down a newly filled cup of coffee and continued on then returned later to see if we were ready for the check. The coffee was on point and the mugs are fairly large. My fiance ordered the Crab hash, and while he enjoyed the hollandaise sauce, eggs, & potatoes, there was hardly any crab on the plate at all. I figure if a plate's name features a particular ingredient/food it should have a good amount of it. Other than that disappointment, what WAS on the plate was good. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs. LOVED the pancakes! Not an overwhelming lemon flavor, but the touch of powdered sugar with the strawberries all made it a bite from heaven! My eggs on the other hand were bleh. I don't like when people's version of scrambled eggs is more like a smaller burnt omelette. It seemed like somebody let the eggs cook too long and failed to keep stirring it in the pan.  So there were a few oddities on this visit, but overall decent experience."
Giselle C.,"Hewitt, TX",56,3,,2.0,8/8/2017,"I got their chipotle chicken pasta. It was bland and so dry. I expect if I am paying 10 dollars or more the plate better be somewhat good.  I ate at the bar and their selection of draft beers was pretty disappointing with only three, and two of the beers were mainstream. I am guessing they don't get the crowd necessary for a bigger selection.  Their only saving grace is what they're known for, cheesecake"
David C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,54,1.0,6/30/2017,Well just like that a place like Cheesecake Factory that's known for large portions is not what we had today.  My kid ordered as well as another adult the chicken slider meal.  Not quite a meal.  I could of got nuggets from the clown in the mall and had more than what was served.  Not a happy person right now.  And to top it off after I brought it to the attention of the manager he only comp'd one order. My wife ordered the chicken Romano and it came out so soggy that we had to send it back.  We all finished our meal by the time the correct order came out.  Not even a sorry or any apologies from management.  Who's running things here.  Here's a pick of our McNuggets slider. When I asked the mgr that I had to go track down cause he passed us 5 or 6 times without acknowledging us he told me that he's only taking care of one order.  I'm not here to try and get free food.  I'm just letting you know that I paid for something that wasn't up to par.  Sad Second picture was pulled off the web
Sylvie R.,"San Antonio, TX",12,5,,1.0,10/25/2017,"I should have paid attention to the previously posted bad reviews about the Cheesecake Factory @ La Canterra.  Their food is overpriced for the mediocre food offered on the menu.  That being said, I spent a great deal of my visit there exploring the novel-sized menu.  Because I cannot have anything with any kind of seeds, I also asked a lot of questions about certain items and made the waitress quite aware of my sensitivity to seeds.  The 2nd waitress that took her place at end of her shift, was also made aware.  I ordered crab bites which came with a tasty sauce that I didn't recognize and only after I was halfway through the sauce, it was apparent that it contained large mustard seeds.  I addressed this with the Manager, whose name I will not disclose, but will be calling Corporate about.  His response to the situation was ""well, would you like another sauce""; I informed him that the damage had already been done.  He offered no other recompense.  And if this incident was not enough, one of my toddler grandchildren (there were 3 of them, all under 4 years of age) broke a small plate when we were still awaiting our order; it wasn't until we were well into our meal and almost finished that they cleared the bigger pieces of glass shards from the floor.  My oldest grandchild had, in the interim, dropped her napkin and while recovering it from underneath her seat, scooped up a handful of smaller broken dish fragments and handed them to me. I'm not sure how this business keeps its doors open.  But I will be calling Corporate about both the manager's blasé attitude, and, the waitress lack of training. ADDENDUM:  Our total bill was $120.00, of which I left NO TIP, as one was NOT deserving...first time in my life I've ever done  this...it saddened me to be this mean."
Mrs G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,9,4.0,7/28/2017,"Went here around 9:30 on a Friday night.It was   pretty busy when we got there.We were told it would be about a 20-25 min wait and it was exactly 20 min when our pager buzzed.We were seated in a nice booth on the upper area of the restaurant.Hope was our waitress and she was awesome and super sweet! I would like to give her 5 stars.Not only was she attentive to us but was also serving a large party and seemed to be just as attentive to them.We both ordered the shrimp scampi with steak Dianne combo.My husband ordered his with mac and cheese which he really enjoyed.I ordered mine with mashed potatoes...I gotta say our meal was pretty good.The only downside was the portion for the price otherwise, we went home full and happy :)"
Amber S.,"San Antonio, TX",14,124,49,4.0,12/7/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's not bad. It's actually really really good. That's a no-brainer. The only reason I'm taking away a star is because the servers rarely have a personality. They are so dang serious all the time. The hostesses absolutely hate their jobs and it shows in the way they greet you.  Now with that being said, this does not mean the table service is bad. It's not. It's just plain. But it will not stop us from coming back."
Paul P.,"San Antonio, TX",53,499,2051,5.0,6/7/2016,"Omg the menu is so dirty. Need to do a better job of wiping them down. Disgusting. We arrived at 10:20; they close at 11:00 but we sort of feel they regret we walked in. Selection of food however keeps us coming back.  Love the Cobb salad. Clean the menus! They nasty!! Update: Tues Lunch June 7. Ok so I have been back four or five times since my last review. I like the new app to pay my bill so I can pay and get the hell out. Servers are really good except when they get a bigger table expect to be ignored if it is just the two of you. Cheesecake Factory has such a broad menu that there is something for everyone and everything is well presented and satisfying if you pick things with ingredients you like. I did not like that one of their employees criticized me on my previous post on Yelp, stating that they clean the menus ""every night."" Ok, so you are admitting that the menus are only cleaned once a day. That is disgusting."
Jillian B.,"Cibolo, TX",3,20,1,1.0,10/15/2017,Ate there earlier and I am now sick of my stomach (only place we ate at today).  Didn't see our server much and when I complained about the overwhelming amount of gnats flying around and trying to fly in my food she didn't seem too concerned. Seemed like something she hears about all the time. Disgusting.
April M.,"San Antonio, TX",16,36,38,1.0,4/27/2017,"We frequent cheesecake factory often. I practically know the menu. Every anniversary, birthday or celebration my family, friends and I come here. I have never had a bad experience... Before today. And honestly let me say that even today, the food was delicious. Our server Brittany was friendly and the environment clean. Cheesecake has always been consistent... Not today. We placed our order, started munchin on the bread & a few minutes later our server informs us my entree wasn't available (tuna titaki salad). After that, the substitute entire i wanted wasn't available in lunch portion. OK, I can't fault them for that part but it just added to my annoyance at that point. Nevertheless, it's my friends birthday, the show must go on. Our food comes, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp (excellent by the way!! I must give kudos where it's due) Afterwards we order dessert. You guessed it, the cheesecake i ordered is not available.  One thing after another. Now don't get me wrong, no one died today and the quality of the food served was great. Here's the kicker, (the reason for the 1 star) At this point the manager has been informed of the numerous inconveniences. I never asked to see the manager, but our server told them what all happened. I would think there would've been a discount or a comp on my bill, (keep in mind it is a birthday as well) but no. $80 tab comes I pay it AND STILL TIPPED my server 20% with a smile on my face. because I'm a good sport & it's not her fault. I didn't ask to see the manager because Im not lookin for a free meal. But I AM EXPECTING customer service. There are too many other restaurants in town and there's nothing magical in your food you don't make a steak any different than anyone else. What has set you apart is your attention to quality & of course desserts. But i'd happier spend my next $100 where my patronage is appreciated and it's valuable to you. I shouldn't have to suggest to you how to makeup for difficulties during my dining experience. So I'm not going to tell you how to manage your establishment. If you're a manager, you should know. And THAT is my complaint. NOT that you were out of ingredients or discontinued options... It's that you were aware of the multiple dissatisfactions & didn't take the time to even come by our table and extend an apology let alone comp a drink. Nothing. Bad show Cheesecake. Not happy."
Matt B.,"Schertz, TX",0,7,,2.0,12/15/2017,"Every time we go there is a wait. I understand that and especially on a Friday night. But the wait here is horrible. They are not designed to handle any large parties, 1 hour plus wait at 930 pm. Maybe it is time they start taking reservations. We will not be back."
VaNae M.,"Northeast Side, San Antonio, TX",104,8,2,4.0,4/21/2017,Our waitress Eileen was excellent. She was very attentive and on point. Food was served fresh and was delicious.
Steven V.,"Uvalde, TX",1,18,31,4.0,6/11/2017,"My family and I eat here whenever we are in the neighborhood. Always very good service and even better food. The garlic cheese bread is wonderful, and the fish, or steak tacos are always delicious.  My wife had the avocado toast, and my daughter enjoyed the fettuccini alfredo. We were checked on several times during our meal by our waitress and the prices are reasonable."
Janelle H.,"Far North Central, San Antonio, TX",21,5,,4.0,10/6/2017,"Consistently delicious!! Our waitress was amazing very friendly, attentive and gave great recommendation. Love this place"
Chloe R.,"Converse, TX",70,10,1,5.0,9/14/2017,"We love coming here purely just for the food but this time was way different. Over servers names is Pedro and he did amazing! We didn't have to ask him for anything! For example my girlfriend asked for an I sweet tea and he brought her just that with lemons, and sugar and a spoon! He anticipated all over our needs! If you go to this location ask to sit in his section!"
