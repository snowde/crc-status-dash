Sandi M.,"Seguin, TX",0,2,,2.0,4/28/2016,"Not the best experience! Been wanting to try for years so my daughter and I go on a Wednesday night about 6. Pretty busy but was seated right away. It took a bit more time than should to be greeted and drink order taken. (I worked in the restaurant business for several years in Nashville) I ordered a draft IPA. Waitress came back with a bottle of different IPA and said draft machine was broken. No big deal! The bottle beer was great! Coming back from restroom I see another waiter with my beer, half empty, taking it from the table and said ""you were served the wrong beer."" Okay, so why not leave the beer I half finished and bring the one I ordered in the first place to the table too or comp it! Our dinner took an unusually long time and we were told a couple of times by the waitress and a then a manager that there was a mishap in kitchen and apologized for taking so long! They wanted to bring out my dinner as it was ready but not my daughters which is a total no no in the restaurant biz. I know things can happen to orders or whatever but at least comp the late meal or offer a free dessert or something! With those prices I would like to think that they had better customer service! Food was okay nothing to rave about! I do not think I would go back to that particular restaurant! Too chain like and not enough attention to quality of food and service! It all comes from the lack of good managers and good training of all staff. The Cooker Restaurants in Nashville were incredible with training staff and managers! We comped meals and always put customer first! We knew if people left unhappy they more than likely would not come back and would tell other folks of their bad experience! This was long before Yelp!"
Jasmine L.,"San Antonio, TX",77,27,4,3.0,7/16/2014,Food was delicious and its connected to the mall to get some shopping done because valet parking is free if you eat at the resturant.
Karen M.,"Biloxi, MS",152,5,,5.0,9/23/2013,The waitress made this 5 star!  She paid attention and saw that I was alone.  She wasn't overbearing but just perfect.  Thank you!
Ivanna H.,"Kyle, TX",58,127,123,2.0,5/6/2011,"What makes America the fattest country?? Uhh, Cheesecake Factory!! The portions are obscenely large, which makes this a great deal I suppose. However, no one should eat as much as they serve here. I've never been able to finish a meal here and everyone I ever go with is the same. What's the point of serving so much to just end up packing it to go, or worse throwing it out? I'm sure you get the point... The service at this location was terribly slow. In the middle of our meal a new waiter came up to my table and said the other waitress had to leave so he'd be taking over. He was even slower than the girl, taking absolutely too long to bring the check. The food was brought out rather quickly, so I was happy about that.  I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pasta which is served with peppers, sweet peas, asparagus, and tortilla slices on top. Too many ingredients in my opinion, so I asked for no peppers. It was a good dish, but nothing spectacular. I did enjoy it however so I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for some spice.   Overall, I'd say this is a nice place to come and SHARE an entree. If you're still hungry afterwards I'm sure their cheesecake can fill you up. Otherwise you'll have lunch and dinner out of one meal here. Don't expect quick service however, even on a slow day."
Tom B.,"Redding, CA",1,23,3,4.0,3/7/2014,"I was pleasantly surprised!  After opening the menu of way-too-many items, I managed to find a nice appetizer and main course.  Service was great and very friendly and attentive.  Food came quickly, even though they were quite busy.  Food was also decent, great selection of beers.  And, of course, the cheesecake was heavenly!! SOOOO good!"
Amber M.,"San Antonio, TX",1,28,12,4.0,5/2/2014,"The food is pretty typical, but they have so many options, its hard not to please everyone. The salads are fresh and tasty options, and the pizza is decent. Sounds weird, but I love their mashed potatoes! Usually, the family gets a bunch of appetizers like the avocado eggrolls and stuffed mushrooms. Nothing to write home about. Milkshakes and cheesecake are delicious and again, they have so many options! Mostly this is a clean, novelty restaurant with unique decor and an outrageous menu. Love to stop by every now and then but the food doesn't really keep me wanting more.."
James G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,4.0,11/25/2012,I've eaten here at least 30 times and I've never had a bad experience.  The menu is huge so you can always find something tar hits the spot. My only complaint would be the tables are close together so we always ask for a booth even if we have to wait.  You can also seat yourself at the bar or the tall tables in the bar area.
Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",254,195,228,2.0,12/4/2011,"Still overrated. Been here so many times back during my college days (different locations: NewPort, Pleasanton, Walnut Creek) and food is still okay. Over priced like the cheesecakes. Even the cheesecakes are $$ for the slice and not that yummy. Had better cheesecake. It's good for big parties. I give the service a 4-5 star. Every time I've been I've had really good service."
Katherine T.,"San Antonio, TX",91,508,37,4.0,10/27/2013,I really don't want to like Cheesecake factory but I have to admit that it is consistently good and there is no better end to dinner than cheesecake! My favorite is the Oreo but all the cheesecakes are so varied and fun. The pear blue cheese flatbread is the perfect size for a light bite and very refreshing.
H P.,"San Francisco, CA",18,75,74,3.0,8/30/2011,"Do you have a small army you need to feed? Come to the Cheesecake Factory! If you are getting any of the food (ie not a slice of cheesecake), be prepared to eat for an entire day. I usually get the ""lunch"" portion of the salads, and never, ever does my hungry tummy have enough room for the entire plate. It is reasonable pricing for all this food but, most of the time I am more disgusted than satisfied. And the environment is kind of weird too, although I am weird (I admit). The decor of large columns and wall paintings is too much for this type of joint. Too over the top. If it weren't for the clients who choose this as their lunch location for my meetings, I would probably only get a couple of cheesecake slices to go.  The cheesecake, now, that is a different story. The selection of flavors is great, especially for someone who does not get along with bland flavors. Although a bit pricey, a slice of cheesecake is the perfect way to tell myself that I did a great job."
Tina E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",114,291,348,4.0,7/30/2013,"The food is good.  As far as service, I always feel like it's so busy that we're ""just another table""."
Donna H.,"San Antonio, TX",126,200,33,3.0,6/13/2013,"Wow! Finally had a so-so meal here... The white bean hummus was flavorless and the bread it came with was some undercooked, doughy disaster. I did love the kale salad and the service was great."
David F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,,5.0,2/17/2015,"The food was great. I had the lunch portion of the Chipotle chicken pasta and not only was it very delicious, it was very filling. The avocado egg rolls were so good, especially the dipping sauce that came with the order. I'd definitely go back again."
J.R. R.,"San Antonio, TX",6,30,,5.0,11/12/2010,"This is the first time I've been to this CF.  Went to one in Indianapolis a couple of years ago and loved it, especially the service.  I wasn't disappointed this time!  I had lunch special (chicken fettuccine Alfredo) with a frozen Mango smoothie-like drink (excellent).  The bread was half-n-half home-made sour dough and dark wheat (looked like rye or pumpernickel but didn't taste like either of those).  Very tasty! Heard a woman tell a customer they change their menu every six months.  Not sure which part of the menu.  Guess I'll go back in the spring to see.  My food was excellent.  Brought a piece of strawberry cheesecake home.  Server bagged it up and included napkins and four plastic forks."
Joey H.,"Orange County, CA",0,42,4,5.0,7/20/2013,I went there with my girlfriend and when the food came to our table they had my order messed up. They were very apologetic and offered me a free soup or salad while I was waiting for my order. The waitress was really trying to make my experience a good one and the manager also came by to apologize as well.
John D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,2,4.0,8/18/2013,Would get 5 stars for food but wait staff is disinterested and just something they have to deal with.  A little better attitude would go a long way for future  visits.
Jacob W.,"Austin, TX",264,25,,4.0,7/5/2012,"If you have the opportunity you should definitely give this place a try. Great service, great food and great cheesecake (shocker I know). Unfortunately last time I went there I made the rookie mistake of not saving adequate room for dessert and was only able to finish half of it, but life goes on. Once again would strongly recommend it, seems like a great date spot too."
Abigail L.,"Cibolo, TX",306,576,1050,2.0,9/24/2010,I have been to Cheesecake Factory in other places.  The bathroom was so dirty!!!!!!  It was so gross.  There was this lady in there and I don't know what she was doing but she was using up all the paper towels.  I finally figured out that she didnt work there when she talked to me.  The food is ok.  too much on the menu to look at.  Lunch prices are so much better than the dinner prices.  Free valet parking if you eat there.  Other than that I give it a 2 because of the bathroom.  I wonder what the kitchen looked like if that bathroom was like that.
Dawn M.,"San Antonio, TX",7,19,4,3.0,1/4/2012,"Okay, I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but how and why the hell does it take 20-30 minutes for these servers to get cheesecake out to your table?!?! I called ahead before my last visit to make sure they still had peppermint bark cheesecake (it was the day after Christmas); the guy who answered must have been too lazy to walk and actually check... he told me yes.  I arrived a mere 10 minutes later (parking was crazy) and the waitress said they were out.  OMG!!! Talk about one upset 9 month pregnant girl!!! Then after the disappointing news it took her almost 20 minutes to bring 2 pieces of cheesecake! UGH!"
Grace G.,"San Antonio, TX",73,190,368,4.0,8/5/2010,"The 1st time I went, I went back 2 other times that week. Lunch and dinner menu are good. Expect to pay $13-$30 per plate. The servers are on top of everything. Breakfast isn't all that, stick to Denny's or a taco shop for that.   I recommend the 30th Aniversary Cheesecake. Don't forget that you can park in valet for free. Just show them your receipt. It is a good place for a date night or celebration."
