Erika B.,"California City, CA",0,4,2,3.0,10/29/2016,"My first time here. Very noisy. Bar and drinks are excellent. Appetizer: crab cakes. Wonderful. Shrimp on Angel hair pasta: worst I ever had. Totally overcooked. Bad. I did send it back.  My server Hannah B. Excellent. On the ball, checking and re-checking. Give her a raise. Promote her. Very pleasant.  ( I really wanted that shrimp and angel hair dish. Looked great but...)"
Raed M.,"San Antonio, TX",20,18,1,5.0,7/6/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is the same everywhere tbh but Melissa L was a terrific server. She knew we don't like alcohol in our food and she informed us the second we placed the order . Her service was very fast and she kept our drinks  filled to the brim . I felt that her service was more personalized than any of the Cheesecake Factory I have been to any other state or country. So thought I'd mention that . I used to be a server but I'm not sure if I could have been that efficient.
Amy M.,"Austin, TX",143,189,420,4.0,1/19/2016,"Every time I go to the Cheesecake Factory I have the same dish. ""Chicken chipotle pasta with angel hair pasta not penne and extra sauce"" literally order it like that it's BOMB! (Unfortunately this dish has crept it's way up from $14.99 to now $16.99. Not sure why the size doesn't seem larger and there are no new ingredients listed in the dish) It's spicy, saucy and has caramelized chicken with asparagus, peas and red peppers. Anyway this instance they didn't make the chicken right it came out soggy and you could tell it was not caramelized. For a $17 dish that chicken needs to be made right. Cheesecake Factory has good service they always aim to please and made it right for us, but by the time the fixed portion came out we were full from the avocado egg-roll appetizer and little we ate out of the original plate.. They did send it home with us. Server was apologetic, and never had an ounce of attitude. Would I come back? Yeah sure it's cheesecake factory. One of the few chains that I like."
Patricia V.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,3,5.0,4/23/2017,"Came for dinner, sat outside, service and food was great.  We ordered the eggroll sampler and our favorites on the sampler were the cuban and salmon ones.  For our main course I had the skinnylicous chicken pot pie and it was so good.  My favorite dish that I've ordered here, very flavorful and just the right amount of food.  Hubby had the chicken tacos and said they were very good, would order them again."
Teofila R.,"San Antonio, TX",99,176,2033,5.0,12/31/2014,This is always a busy place. The menu is a book! I had the stuffed mushroom! They were so good! I also had the Samosas with Chicken and they were good too! I told the waiter that we were celebrating a birthday and for him to bring a cake to my friend. He recommended a slice of caked topped with strawberries! The cake was Devine! They decorated the plate with chocolate swirls ! He brought a couple of other staff and we sang Happy Birthday! My friend had a hamburger and fries and I got to taste the fries and they were so good and hot! Our lunch was special thank you to our waiter Noah!
S G.,"San Antonio, TX",32,29,18,4.0,7/27/2016,Good was amazing.... Great service.... I was having me some alone time for the day..... enjoyed a perfect lunch..... delicious caramel macchiato... loved it... just didn't like my seat..
Michelle H.,"San Antonio, TX",45,820,6542,4.0,4/21/2013,"Cheesecake Factory - 4 stars.  Service that night - 1 star. Wait was 35 mins---pretty typical for a busy night.  Hostesses were friendly.   Our blonde server, however, never had a smile on her face.  She rarely stopped by our table---but she did at the other tables around us.  Each time she walked by she never once glanced at our table.  Our waters were completely empty, with no refills the entire time we were there.  Rough night? I  don't care.  Suck it up & do your job.  Don't your tips depend on it?   Anwayyyyyyyyyyys,  I had the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic w/ bowtie pasta.  It was good, except it was ""sweet?""  Thought that was odd.  That ruined the overall taste for me.  They did give you plenty of chicken chunks (meat).  My bf had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane (factory combination plate).  His dish was actually good.   I like their cheesecakes, but were too stuffed to order dessert---and we just wanted to get outta there after the lack of service.  Oh yeah, the tables being so close was a bit of an issue since they sat us right next to some loud ladies who talked nonstop about their drama and who they hated.  *sigh*   Maybe we'll try another night---and hope we don't get the same server and get a booth!"
Juan E.,"Fullerton, CA",325,209,5053,4.0,12/2/2015,Brought my brother here for his birthday. Came here with his daughters and his fiancé. We also brought our mom. Everyone ordered their favorite dish. Not one repeat. All different. Our waitress was great in the beginning. Food came out great and we even got our picture taken of the whole family. Everything went great. My girlfriend sat next to my mom. And they barely knew each other. The only reason I took a star away was the ending. I bought a cheesecake for him with happy birthday on it. But it took longer to get than our food. And when I wanted to pay for everyone. She took so long that my brother came up to see what was going on. After I had told her early about it. But since the food and our time was great and my brother says they go often and they love it. I only took a star.
Jeniffer I.,"Palm Springs, FL",2,18,6,3.0,12/18/2015,So I went to the cheese cake factory today for dinner to eat the buffalo chicken blast and like always they were delicious but I was craving something else and I ended up ordering the fettuccine Alfredo and was so disappointed bc it was mostly butter and no cheese. Mind you the server put parm cheese on top and still could taste any of the cheese. I took my left overs home and still no cheese even when I warmed up my food. Never getting fettuccine Alfredo from the cheese cake factory again.
Ezequiel S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,5.0,7/29/2016,Love this place even though it's super busy we didn't have to wait long for table or appetizers our food was fast never had an empty glass of tea food is just wonderful the red velvet cheese cake is a must try
Jimmy A.,"San Antonio, TX",5,11,2,5.0,2/20/2016,"I love this place, my family and i enjoy all varieties of foods they server. The deserts are awesome"
Z M.,"Long Beach, CA",13,25,1,5.0,12/6/2015,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. It was a Saturday night so the wait was super long and we had been waiting longer than the wait time we were told. Eventually we were told that we could sit outside so we agreed. We were a party of about 13 people.  When the host took us to the outside seating, he said we couldn't put the tables together because they'd break. Which meant we would all have to sit at separate tables and that completely defeated the point of a group birthday dinner. The birthday girl was very upset because she had made it clear that we were all supposed to sit together.  So off to a bad start and we were ready to leave...  But when our server Ivan came out, he saved the whole night. He allowed us to move the tables together and made sure we all had a good night. He was great, helpful, fast and overall a great server.  Eventually the manager came out and told us that the birthday girl's dinner was gonna be on the house.  In the end, I was very pleased with how the situation was resolved, and again, Ivan was amazing. Thank you!"
Jesse B.,"San Antonio, TX",165,2,1,1.0,8/20/2016,"Tonight staff sucked, food was late to much conversation with customers and no service. Waited 25mins. for bread, I hope they are not looking for a hefty tip. Seriously fix this problem."
Ollie T.,"Harvest, AL",0,23,8,1.0,6/18/2015,"Abysmal! I rarely eat at The Cheesecake Factory mainly because there's never been a location within 100 miles of where I've lived.  I remember going twice in the past while traveling, but not within the past few years, so we (my husband and I) decided to give this place a try while in San Antonio.  We were at the LaCantera mall the previous day and decided to eat at P.F. Chang's instead of The Cheesecake Factory there.  This was probably a mistake, as I didn't enjoy our dining experience at the San Pedro North Star Mall location! We arrived around 7:30 on a Wednesday evening (last night).  We gave our name to the attendant and asked for a booth, and she told us there would be a fifteen or so minute wait.  Fine.  Twenty minutes later, our thingy buzzed, and a different woman showed us to our table--which was dirty.  The table itself hadn't been wiped down, and there was food on the seats.  We pointed this out to the hostess, and she just looked at us.  We stood there, the three of us, rather awkwardly, and she finally wiped at the table and seat.  But it was still dirty.  She asked, ""Are you going to sit there?"" My husband flagged down a busboy, and he wiped the table and seat off with the same rag he'd been wiping everything else down with.  The seat was left wet, so I wiped it off with a napkin. At this point my husband called for the manager and asked him why we would be seated at a dirty table.  Also, when the busboy wiped the table down, the silverware and napkins had to be removed (yes, they'd set a DIRTY TABLE), and when the bread was brought out by our waiter after we finally sat down, we didn't have anything to use to butter it!  The waiter didn't even seem to notice that he'd brought us bread, butter, and we had no utensils. After bringing us bread the waiter took our drinks order and brought me the wrong thing.  I asked for Dr. Pepper and I received a Diet Something.  He said he would try the other side of the bar, and took my drink away.  He didn't bring it back--roughly twenty minutes had passed--during which we ordered our meals--before I got the chance to ask him what happened to my drink.  He disappeared and brought it back to me a couple minutes later.  Really, should I have had to ask for him to bring my drink back? Shortly before our food arrived he did replace our silverware, but we had to ask him to.   I ordered the Romano Chicken and my husband ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combo.  They cooked his steak wrong.  He asked for well-done as always because neither of us enjoy raw/undercooked meat, and half of it was pink inside.  He said it tasted ""oily"" and lacked flavor.  My Romano Chicken was tasteless and super unimpressive.  The noodles were way too greasy!  My husband once again complained to the manager about the poor service and food, from the silverware situation, to my drink situation, to the steak being undercooked.  The manager, a Hispanic fellow, basically acted like he didn't care, but he did comp us on desert (which ended up being unimpressive as well--I've had better tasting cheesecake from the frozen dessert section of the supermarket). It will be a long time before we go to another Cheesecake Factory!"
Jesse D.,"Del Rio, TX",0,3,,5.0,2/12/2017,"Awesome place. My wife and I enjoy eating here whenever we're in town. This place offers and abundance of menu options. If you feel like eating pasta, burgers, a steak, chicken, virtually whatever you want, they have it. You can't go wrong here. Also, try the cheesecakes."
Nina M.,"Little Rock, AR",0,4,,4.0,8/14/2016,"The food was good, and the service was good. It was just the hour long wait that knocked it down the star."
Andrea S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"Very disappointing experience. The hostess is not only  condescending, but very disrespectful. No one deserves to have eyes rolled at them, by a simple question as to why after waiting an hour and 15 minutes we are being seated in the worst table in the restaurant. You better make sure that you dress in a suit and tie if you want to be treated like a human being. Was considering having my rehearsal dinner there, that will never happen. Lost a loyal customer for life. Too bad it took 15 minutes for a manager to even respond over the phone. What has happened to the customer service it is a lost art. What a shame. These employees want to collect a pay check without treating people decent. Shameful."
Brian S.,"Tecumseh, OK",65,156,66,4.0,7/16/2016,It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's solid food. I got the chicken and biscuits. Always good. Only problem I have with these guys is that menu is too big. I need and hour just to get down to my top 3 that I want to order.
Cristal T.,"San Antonio, TX",94,43,4,5.0,1/4/2016,My husband and I came here on Sunday right before I took him to the airport. The hostess stand was so friendly and everyone did a great job! The food was delicious and all the servers make it a point to help each other out. I was really blown away that I got such great service! We will be back!
China E.,"San Antonio, TX",29,4,6,3.0,10/29/2015,I come here all the time and never tried their chicken Alfredo pasta. I must say it is creamy and delicious!! I would recommend to any and every one. The rye bread is also great!
