Jason M.,"San Antonio, TX",1,9,,3.0,7/13/2016,"Not always a huge fan of chain restaurants. It's a good place to eat and of course, the cheesecake is good with a wide variety but the menu for regular entrees is too busy and usually hard to navigate. It's great to have choices but there are too many choices (this goes for all Cheesecake Factories). The service at this particular location is average but nothing special."
Tamara G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,1,4.0,1/24/2016,"For a Sunday night, only a 30 minute wait for our party of 8. I had the Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta. Very good and a lot; took half home for lunch the next day. It did take about 30 minutes to get our food. They didn't seem that busy but maybe because there was 8 of us."
Carrie M.,"San Antonio, TX",29,9,2,1.0,2/28/2016,"Very disappointed. . We were told on the phone this location offered "" many vegan options "" on their ""new menu"".  We get there, are told it will only be about 15 minutes wait, it was actually over 30 minutes we waited. We were given greasy, dirty menus, and nasty silverware with food caked on it. When I showed it to the waiter and quietly requested clean silverware, he tried to convince me it was ""hard water stains,"" said they would ""wipe it off "" for me. We left before they could bring drinks, after being told they only have one vegan option.. Never going back. If I could I would give NO stars.. bathrooms were nasty as well."
Jorrel B.,"Selma, TX",51,2,3,5.0,10/7/2015,Came in at start of business and was seated immediately. Waitress was glad to serve us and checked with us every so often. Food was amazing (had the chipotle pasta). Would highly recommend the pumpkin/pecan pie if still available. Will definitely come back!
Stephanie M.,"San Antonio, TX",157,179,37,4.0,12/24/2013,"I was a bit nervous when my boyfriend and his niece wanted to just drop in to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at the North Star Mall without a reservation... It was nearly 8pm on a Sunday, and I thought we would wait half a lifetime to be seated at a table.  Thankfully, we were seated immediately and the food came out relatively quickly... although all without the hostess giving eye-contact as to where we would be seated--- I realize all the info is on the screen, but I feel our presence wasn't really recognized; just an odd feeling when first walking into a restaurant. Get here EARLY if you have a large group... And you need at least half of your people present at the restaurant before they will seat you.  And even though you might get lucky, I would still put a reservation in before attempting to eat here. Food has always been melt-in-your-mouth good here.  We recently tried the grilled artichoke from the ""skinilicious menu"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it... I think the mustard/type sauce it was drizzled with was not necessary, as the garlic aioli was plenty flavorful for the artichoke. The niece ordered her favorite spaghetti with meat sauce--- has a good spice to it that she enjoys.  Boyfriend ordered the garilc pasta and he enjoyed it too.  I had the pasta carbonara with the chicken, and it was SO good!! Not your homemade carbonara, but a great carbonara-inspired dish. Also, your life will be so much happier and carefree if you just don't even look at how many calories their regular-menu items are.  Enjoy every bite! Celebrate!!"
M D.,"Cibolo, TX",29,4,1,3.0,9/14/2015,"Not great! This place used to be a great stop (since opening in San Antonio 10ish years ago), with a little something for everyone and not to mention, impressive desserts! My past few visits have been mediocre at best. It's become another one of those places that taste like the rest of the Sysco supplied chains around town, just with a high price tag. Ordering a slice of the chocolate tower layered cake was the saving grace of my most recent visit."
C S.,"Ocoee, FL",1,51,1,5.0,4/22/2016,Just had carrot cake with an IPA sitting at the bar. My wife had chocolate cake with ice cream. Didn't have to wait to sit and eat at the bar. Great tasting food and good atmosphere.
Mark R.,"San Antonio, TX",16,4,2,1.0,6/2/2016,Hair in two of our dishes! Obviously couldn't eat anything afterwards even though manager offered  to replace meals. Check your food folks.
Krystal T.,"Irving, TX",0,35,10,5.0,7/26/2015,Trying out the new egg roll sampler today! The avacado egg rolls are always amazing. The new salmon and Cuban ones are pretty good too. However the TexMex rolls lacked flavor in my opinion.
Mike H.,"Weslaco, TX",57,13,6,4.0,8/4/2015,This was the second time I have ever eaten at this location and it did not disappoint. The service was fast and the food better than average.  The meatloaf is hearty and the flavored robust. The mashed potatoes and the corn succotash really complete the meal.
Ana C.,"Houston, TX",1,15,5,5.0,4/13/2016,Been coming for years at this location. Always had great service. The banana cheesecake is to die for. Totally recommend it if you're a newbie to The Cheesecake Factory. Everything that I have ordered has always been great. Love the portions!
Mish F.,"Schertz, TX",0,11,7,5.0,7/12/2015,"The Monte Crisco sandwich on the Sunday brunch menu is to die for! Service was prompt and attentive. Not sure about lunch or dinner, but Sunday brunch is a must. Definitely going back"
Amber L.,"Huntsville, TX",20,8,,4.0,3/12/2016,"We dropped by the Cheesecake Factory just for dessert. We were seated promptly. The restaurant was very busy. My son ordered the Banana Cream Cheesecake and my husband ordered the Reese's Cheesecake. They said they were wonderful. I ordered the low calorie strawberry cheesecake, but they were all out. Very disappointing! I settled for appetizers (fried zucchini and Cuban rolls) instead. They were really good; however, I truly wanted cheesecake. The waiter was attentive and very nice. We will be back if we are in the area... I'll just make sure to get there a bit earlier."
Gerardo C.,"Laredo, TX",33,3,4,5.0,7/30/2015,"First time at the Cheesecake Factory and I LOVED everything about it.., but the wait. It was too long of a wait then again I really didn't care because the food was so good and who can you blame when you have so many people that want to go eat there? It's amazing!!"
A D.,"San Antonio, TX",3,26,5,5.0,2/10/2016,We went there for dinner on Saturday night. There was an hour wait for a table so the host suggested we sit outside. It was cold as hell outside but they had heaters in the patio area so it was cozy. We had the calamari appetizer which was excellent. And the house Chardonnay they served was awesome. I ordered the Chicken avocado sandwich. It was just ok. The toasted bread it was served on could have been better. Otherwise the service and everything else was great! We will definitely come back.
Stephanie A.,"San Antonio, TX",91,103,316,2.0,8/27/2015,"I cringe when I a friend or family member decides to have their special occasion at this establishment. Not because the service is bad, or the restaurant is dirty, but because this establishment is sincerely overrated. Here's why: - 99.9% of the regular menu has at least 1,000 calories or more, per dish (even a waiter confirmed this).  (They recently implemented a skinny menu, which had 600 or less calories per dish. *sigh of relief*).  -The cheesecake packs a strong rush of sugar that made my hands swell and pulsate (is that normal?). Once again, add another 800 to 1,000 worth of calories to your dinner... you may be close to ingesting 3,000 calories with an appetizer, meal, alcoholic beverage, and dessert if you wish. I have had better tasting cheesecake elsewhere, it is not all that great....seriously. -The dishes are very much overpriced for the quality and taste that is served. $12 for a small Happy Meal sized Turkey Burger and side salad. I honestly have had better tasting food elsewhere. I don't mind paying a shiny penny here and there, but I expect quality and good taste.  -The parking is horrible at North Star Mall to begin with, and the parking lot in front of the restaurant is always packed. May be due to half of the parking being occupied by Valet.  -There's normally a wait to be seated. This place does tend to get packed during lunch and dinner.  Now let me just say, the interior has a very palatial and relaxed ambiance. Dim lighting and relaxing chairs. Felt very cozy. The customer service was good, but the staff seem to be very busy helping multiple tables.  Overall, I would not recommend this establishment. You can do better!"
Brandon A.,"San Antonio, TX",43,6,,5.0,4/17/2016,Nice décor. Huge menu. The wait was a little long but well worth it. The gumbo was excellent!
DeAnna R.,"Converse, TX",51,47,58,5.0,11/23/2014,"Such a cool place.  I was happily surprised by a few of my peeps.  The food is great & I love the fried mac n cheese.  Huge menu joke is real come to find out - who knew LOL.  The staff handled out huge table with grace and ease = Kudos!  So, perfect for large or small events.  Uh oh, somebody's fabulous!!!"
T M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",22,147,,2.0,10/14/2015,"Ripoff.  I ordered some hot wings and cheesecake, no drink and it cost me $22!!  The wings were nasty, soggy and huge like turkey wings.  The cheesecake was tiny sliced with minimal cherry topping and that itself was $8.  The place itself is nice and tries to come off as some fancy place in Beverly Hills.  But what is the point of being in a fancy building serving food when you can't cook?  Also, security was placing something on peoples cars, I'm not sure what.  But you have to be careful where you park in this upscale area."
Cathy C.,"San Antonio, TX",3,14,5,1.0,3/26/2016,"Wasn't impressed. I've only been to Cheesecake a few times and I keep returning bc every time I order a dish I have the feeling, I ordered the wrong thing- but today is likely my last visit unless someone else is buying! Customer service is usually pretty good. Just that today I received plastic in my salad to which they didn't charge me for my food at all. Our waiter was kind and the manager was helpful. The turkey avacado club sandwhich I had was ok and I'm thankful my meal was on the house (due to the plastic) bc the sandwhich- I could have made better at home- and I will just do that next time- make it at home. The cheesecakes are good though. Go there only for cheesecakes and the service! Don't waste money on the food though."
