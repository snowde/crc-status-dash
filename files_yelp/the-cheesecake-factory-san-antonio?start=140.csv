Hannah G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,4,4.0,9/20/2016,"Cecia was extremely rude but thankfully Mark took care of it by changing our server to Danielle. She was complete opposite, very sweet and attentive (and was pregnant!) Kuddos to Danielle who deserve a raise!"
Renzo M.,"Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA",8,81,92,5.0,1/18/2015,Food was amazing great taste and flavor.  The size of the portions were great as well.   We had Cajun jambalaya pasta and bang-bang chicken and shrimp. The only recommendations would to let the tomatoes in the jambalaya pasta to stew more to add flavor to the tomatoes and remove the peas from the bang-bang.  Can't wait to go back.
Heidi S.,"Humble, TX",116,396,29,4.0,8/25/2015,"The price may be a bit much on some stuff, but they know what they are doing! My vanilla bean cheesecake was so off the chain I was in heaven!  I couldn't even tell you what I ate for lunch! haha Service was good even though it was packed."
Jim M.,"San Antonio, TX",16,15,,4.0,1/13/2016,So my family and I went here last night for our 25th anniversary. I have eaten cheesecake factory in other locations and the food was on par with every other one. The service however was top notch. Our waitress was always checking in with us to see how we were doing topping off drinks etc. I wish all waitresses were like this. Food as I said before was on large and I do enjoy it. The price was also good for the value. I recommend it over the one at the Shops at LaCantera.
Ruben B.,"Brownsville, TX",27,36,60,5.0,12/6/2014,"I could never have anything bad to say about The Cheesecake Factory, everything on their menu is amazing. Chicken Madeira is mind blowing. I've had Chicken Madeira at about 4 different restaurants but none have ever compared to CF's. The avocado egg rolls are heavenly, the wild mushroom soup was magnificent, and of course a trip to the CF wouldn't be complete without a slice of White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheese Cake. This meal was shared  between 2 people by the way."
Laura M.,"San Antonio, TX",4,45,16,3.0,12/16/2015,"Picking up a cheesecake.  Restaurant is always clean and decently kept, customer service is poor, with little I contact , no one cares everyone's in their own little world. But the cheesecake is amazing! At the end of the day that is all that really matters"
Wes M.,"Austin, TX",178,134,40,3.0,10/29/2015,"It's a chain. You know what to expect. The service here has typically been sub-par for me, so unless I'm really feeling one of their 2,000+ calorie dishes, I'll go somewhere else. The food is good and consistent, though. So I'll give them that."
Staci B.,"Fayetteville, AR",25,39,10,2.0,6/27/2014,"Just average. After waiting they tried to seat us as a party of 8 at a table for 6, then had to wait longer and get reseated. I think we had a waiter that was high or something. We got and ate our appetizers before we were able to order our entrees or even got the drinks for the kids in our party. They comped us two cheesecakes an two bowls of soup though. I had the skinnylicious grilled salmon with dill sauce and veggies and it was very good. We also split the Hershey cheesecake and as always very good but super fattening."
Irene E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2016,"Went there with my daughter to celebrate the end of her final exams. We ordered our food while a couple other tables were being seated around us. About 35 minutes later (after people who were seated  after us received their orders) a manager came  by to tell me that there's no more tuna left for the ahi tuna salad that I ordered. He asked if I would like something else (with an impatient tone) and I told him I would need to see a menu again to decide. I asked that my daughter's order be brought out since  we had been waiting a while and she was very hungry. She ordered  a luncheon special of pizza and a salad. They brought out her pizza after another 10 minutes and then her salad about 15 minutes later. I ended up asking for my order to go because we had already been there well over an hour and had  to be at an appointment that afternoon.  When the waiter gave me the bill, there was an additional entrée on it and that had to be resolved. Overall, the manager was arrogant and customer service with us WAS NOT a priority."
Alan R.,"Midland, TX",17,45,,4.0,9/10/2014,"We have been to this location two times now, and each time the staff is great, friendly, and always prompt to tending to customers.  Food is great, always on par. Our waitress, we had both times is excellent, a very generous tip to her!!!! And my hat is off to you!  So many items on the menu it is impossible to choose my favorite!  Always a must have whether alone, with family or friends or maybe a special night out with that special someone.  Always take the time to stop for ""The Cheesecake Factory""."
Juan A.,"McAllen, TX",1,5,2,5.0,10/25/2015,"Never been to the CheeseCake Factory. This was my first time and boy was I not disappointed. I would consider this restaurant to be in my top 5. The wait is a little long but totally worth it.  I ordered the chicken madeira plate. Wow! I was blown away. The flavor was all these. My fiancé ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken. I tired some of hers and it was good but still preferred my plate. Of course you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting cheese cake. I ordered Chris' outrageous cheesecake. It was not bad, just a lot to handle. It most certainly lives up to the name. Oh and not to forget service. Our waitress was a delight to have. She had a smile on her face and was very friendly. Cheesecake Factory knocked it out of the park. I will be back!"
Kerri D.,"Deming, NM",0,23,,5.0,11/21/2015,This was just plain yum!  The avocado egg rolls started us off with our dinner date. The sauce is amazing!  Then our dinner entrees came.  No room for cheesecake..  Had to take them to go of course. Must try the pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake. It is just wow!  The service was exceptional and it must be cultural. They all actually like working here. Great date night. Highly recommend.
Laura H.,"South Side, San Antonio, TX",5,60,2,4.0,5/14/2014,"I have a major cheesecake problem so this place is like heaven to me. I haven't tried the entrees yet so I cannot attest to those.  Good- The cheesecake was amazing! I got the Reese's peanut butter cup slice and it was delicious. My only complaint is that it was not 100% cheesecake. It had regular cake mixed in. That took away from it. I was with a group of 3 other ladies so I tried all of there's and they were so good! They had the red velvet, original and raspberry truffle. The red velvet was the absolute best Bad- I never like it when a restaurant does not list the prices of the drinks and deserts on their menu. Don't be shady! The cheesecake is 8$, which is a lot but on the other hand it really is that good! Although, don't forget my afore mentioned cheesecake problem. My friend got a mixed drink that was 10$. To me that is crazy, but to each there own.  Next time I will try to get in for a whole meal."
Amy R.,"San Antonio, TX",369,585,55,4.0,6/9/2012,"I've always had fantastic service here at this Cheesecake Factory location (except for one time, but I've forgiven and forgotten)! Like I said, I've been here plenty of times and it can be expensive, but it's totally worth it. I have always gotten the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I never branch out, because the wraps are just amazingly delicious. There's nothing better in the world. Plus it never fails because everything is cold except the chicken and that's pretty hard to fail. I LOVE that when you go with a small child they bring out a child plate immediately when you sit which usually consists of apples, bananas and slices of bread. Keeps baby happy and keeps family happy because they don't have to deal with screaming, unhappy child. I LOVE the ambiance of this place. No matter where you sit, you don't feel like you're next to people, especially if you sit in the booths. If you sit at a table, you are close, but you don't have to - just request a booth. ;) It's really fancy and all the servers are dressed professionally and are usually really accommodating and friendly. I LOVE that there is valet parking outside of the mall. I hate shopping (check out my yelp posts, I really do hate shopping) so going to the mall for me is a freaking nightmare. I try to avoid at all costs. But sometimes you just HAVE to go, and if I ever go to Northstar Mall, I always treat myself to getting Cheesecake Factory so therefore I park in the valet (since it's free, you only have to tip the valet driver!) Bonus! Cheesecake is my favorite desert and I just love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. It is quite expensive for one slice but it's 100% worth it. I'd recommend to get the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake (mmmmmmmmm, I so want some right now). I just recently went back and had an excellent experience from our server, Esra G (what it says on our receipt). I even emailed Cheesecake Factory afterwards to compliment her and make sure she receives recognition for her outstanding service. You go to a top end restaurant and assume you'll be getting top end service, which is exactly what we received from her. Probably one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!! Would definitely recommend, if you haven't been, you must go and GET THE THAI LETTUCE WRAPS (yum)."
Brennen L.,"Seattle, WA",41,97,41,2.0,5/5/2015,I'm a regular at the Cheesecake Factory in Seattle. The Pasta Da Vinci is my absolute favorite. Something about this location just seems different than what I'm used to. The service is excellent as always but I seemed to have tasted different ingredients in the food than what I'm accustomed to.
Clarissa M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,47,,1.0,11/19/2015,"Went here late night after a spurs game and the food was anything but appetizing. First we ordered two appetizers, the ""dynamite"" shrimp was tiny and there was nothing dynamite about this shrimp. Second, we ordered some crab bites; they were lacking flavor. For our dinner we ordered the bowtie pasta with creamy garlic sauce. I really think either the chef put the wrong sauce on the pasta or he spilled the pepper in it. All you could taste is pepper. It was awful. Oh and to top it off the floor was so dirty and greasy we were sliding when we walked, gross. The only thing good about this evening was the waitress was very nice and attentive."
Kayla G.,"San Antonio, TX",11,13,34,3.0,12/21/2015,"It was my cousins first time at the Cheesecake Factory and she was a bit undecided on what to get. Our waitress was a bit rushy but was very helpful and asked about what she liked or preferred and recommended a couple of dishes to her. She ended up loving it, the waitress was outgoing and friendly throughout our visit. Food overall was great."
Angela D.,"San Antonio, TX",21,60,6,5.0,4/18/2014,"A great little work lunch with a great friend/employee.  We arrived on Thursday at 12:45pm and there was no wait. Service was prompt, thorough, attentive and helpful. Started with the Salmon Firecracker Rolls which are simply amazing.  The sweet and spicy sauce is a great twist to this little appetizer. I had the lunch portion of the Miso Salmon and my friend had the Fish Tacos.  The salmon was rich and tasty.  It was a large portion...too much for lunch.  I found that after having 6-8 bites it was too overwhelming in richness...but the flavor is unreal. His came with 4 large tacos, black beans and rice and it was another massive portion. He stated it was missing spice but he really enjoyed it. Ended with carrot cake to go...holy smokes!!!   Great experience!!!"
Derek G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,22,6,1.0,12/13/2015,Seating area sucks especially if there is only 2 people your stuck sitting next to everyone. Very uncomfortable. Won't  be coming back for sure.
Jessica S.,"Rockport, TX",0,2,,4.0,6/23/2016,"They welcomed us with opening hands, didn't reserve a table for 12 people and they worked on that right away. Great food and cheesecake, very fulfilling. Place is great, clean, and friendly."
