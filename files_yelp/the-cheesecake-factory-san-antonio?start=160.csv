Henry C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,,1.0,8/7/2014,Take out order is a nightmare Always getting order wrong Dishes incomplete and portions much smaller  The aggravation of having to drive all the way back to correct the order is insurmountable  Most of all it occurs with every takeout order over the last 3 years
Mr R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,32,,1.0,3/22/2015,"This review is purely on this location. I've been to the location by The Rim and that one was great. This location however had one major problem, waiters just not knowing what was available. I had my waiter come back three separate times after we ate when we ordered our cheesecake, to tell me that every choice I made for cheesecake was out and not available until I gave up and decided to not get any cheesecake, which was the entire purpose of going there in the first place. Waiters needs to get themselves in order and have constant knowledge of whats available so no ones time is wasted. I rather go to the other location, which always has what I want."
Nikki I.,"Dallas, TX",192,86,25,5.0,12/8/2013,"I truly enjoyed my experience here at Te Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time to go to one in SA but I have visited one in Dallas. We waited about 10 mins to be seated and this was around 9:45pm. Our waiter was so nice she had a great personality and continuously checked up on us. We ordered a bottle of wine to start off our meal. When our waiter brought it out she let us try it first and then poured us full glasses. We ordered fried cheese for our appetizer, when they were brought out they were cold. Since that was the last batch of fried cheese out waiter compensated us with these delicious fried Mac n cheese balls.....AMAZING! I ordered the Spicy Jamaican chicken and shrimp. I couldn't be more impressed with a dish..it was perfect but the shrimp could've been cooked a little longer. I ended with a wild berry white chocolate cheesecake which satisfied my sweet craving! I loved this experience great for a date or just hanging with friends!"
Theresa H.,"San Antonio, TX",90,341,35,3.0,1/26/2014,"We got a gift card so we went to check out the Cheesecake Factory for a weekend lunch. The place was packed but we were seated quickly and greeted by our very friendly and attentive server. The menu is huge with so many things including some more health conscious fare. I ordered a burger off the ""skinny"" menu or whatever they called it. It was simple and good. My table mate got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. He said it was tasty.  We ordered some cheesecake for the road which was finished off later in the evening.  The place is a little pricey given it's a chain and situated in a mall.  AND the parking can be a little wonky but they have valets out front to help with that problem."
Vanessa M.,"Winsted, CT",248,452,1098,4.0,1/2/2012,"Ok. let me start by saying I have hated you for so long (since before 2000), because I had a god awful experience at your Vegas location. Rude staff, rude management, soup spilled down my back, my friends foot was cut by a plate shard which a server had dropped and dirty bar rag was provided to clean the bleeding wound... That kind of AWFUL. After a near 2 hour wait and the aforementioned disaster, the awful experience ended with a blah meal to top everything off. So even on top of my seething hatred for the company, the food was less than good.Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory since. Until now. Service was excellent. My guest nor I were never in any danger of being covered in our own entree or cut with dinnerware. PLUS. But what really won me over was the Baja Hash. It was off the charts good. Your corporate should be made known that you have redeemed your company's name and reputation."
April L.,"McAllen, TX",0,5,5,3.0,8/4/2015,The lunch specials are fairly priced. I had the chicken salad sandwich with salad and soup. It was enough to share. The service was very mediocre and it took a long time to get our food.
Melissa D.,"San Antonio, TX",89,80,12,4.0,12/31/2013,Very consistent and aligned with the national brand. We eat at this national chain regularly when traveling with family as they have a very diverse and large menu which makes everyone happy plus a solid kids menu.  The service is good (although it can be on the slow side because the food is prepared fresh and it is a large facility) and it is a very clean location considering it is within the mall.  My only concern is that both of the last two times I have eaten in this location we have been spilled on. This last time a busser tried to carry way too much from a table and she dropped an entire pitcher of iced tea on the floor. The only table they seemed to be concerned about was the one directly next to the spill... we were within the splash zone and weren't even checked on.
Carissa C.,"San Antonio, TX",65,28,198,3.0,4/15/2014,"In all honesty.. I would solely go just for the free bread and butter. And some cheesecake for dessert. Other then that I don't really care for their menu. The jumbalaya is pretty good. Everything else I have tried has been a disappointment. Meatloaf, eggs Benedict, goes on.. I would probably pick a pasta if anything."
Heather B.,"San Antonio, TX",60,88,107,5.0,4/27/2014,Food is great! Came with fast friendly not over bearing wait staff! They had the appetizer and meal spaced out perfectly. Prices was good for the amount of food. Dinner for two with appetizer and 20% tip cost $82.
Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",314,372,371,2.0,11/23/2013,Nothing high end about this high end restaurant... Very disappointed and this was not my first time at a Cheesecake Factory. I will write this review in bullet format... - Price.. $7.50 for a slice of cheese cake I feel is a little expensive. But to each his/her own. - The main issue I had at this location was the climate. It was 37°F is San Antonio this night and someone thought it was a good idea to continue to pump cold A/C into the restaurant. By my second bite into my hard pasta it was cold. It was so cold inside that we cut our dinner short and got our food to go.  As I am shivering trying to enjoy myself I look around and other people are still wearing their jackets bundled up. (i just wanted to make sure that I was not the only one) - The food.. My food was not hot to begin with and top that with the cold air and you might as well serve dinner topped with ice chips. My pasta was hard completely under cooked. If you are going to charge $20 for some noodles then it better be prodigious.  - Server.. Our server was good. I just don't think she knew how to handle my concerns. But that's what Yelp is for. Also out of all the higher end restaurants I have ever eaten at this is the only on that DOES NOT box the leftovers for you.  PS. If any body with power at the Cheesecake Factory reads this. Please bring back caramel chicken.
Clarence J.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",60,1219,82,3.0,1/25/2014,"Yes, it's a chain, and one that covers a massively wide assortment of food, but the taste and atmosphere entertain me and I keep returning for more than just the amazing cheesecake.  I went to try the cheesecake long ago and have been going back regularly ever since to try more and more of the food.  I haven't gone wrong yet . . . and have occasionally even finished a whole plate. (Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers. (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . but I'm not that nice.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal unless you hit the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise it can be a study in controlled chaos, noisewise -- the most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  That said, as with all The Cheesecake Factories, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the atmosphere warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. My only wish is that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have become extinct, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed."
Amanda T.,"San Antonio, TX",113,30,9,4.0,7/30/2013,"Had a meetup meet here today (for Cheesecake Day 2013), wherein all cheesecake was 1/2 the first slice per person and they debuted a new type of S'mores Cheesecake as well.  This is just my newest time coming here, for this reasons. I come here a lot with my roommate. Sometimes for meals, but most of the time for cheesecake by itself. Because there is a reason for the name and them cornering the market on it. My roommate when he goes out with others, will even bring extra slices home as a gift, just because.  The food here is amazing. I've almost always loved the service I've gotten. I'd definitely recommend it more as a dessert place, than a dinner place, but you really can go all out for everything there."
Liz R.,"San Antonio, TX",4,152,12,4.0,8/22/2015,Long wait. But the service and food is great. I recommend the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic Shrimp dish.
Sarah L.,"San Antonio, TX",40,190,30,4.0,6/7/2013,"Love it here! I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. I usually always get the same thing, The shrimp and bacon club. It's soooo good! I have had other things but always go back to that.  I have had some horrible waiters there like others have but I try not to let it ruin my time there.  Of course if you go you have to get cheesecake. Seriously. Even if your are full take some home. I love the red velvet cheesecake. Thats my go to flavor. They have a ton of great one's as well.  If you haven't been, It's definitely worth going!"
Tracer A.,"Great Falls, MT",0,23,32,5.0,7/10/2014,"This place ROCKS! We went for happy hour and the service, atmosphere and comfortable setting led to a special experience!  Ordered the Avocado Spring Rolls and Chicken Pot Stickers. Had a fancy Moscow mule with a twist of pineapple.  Dinner was delicious Pasta Cabano and Pretzel Crusted Chicken.  The evening ended with a delicious and hard to pick from the many terrific choices of cheesecake ""Key Lime"" bottom line try it out casual but fancy place to enjoy company with friends or that special someone."
G D.,"Bigfoot, TX",14,50,26,5.0,2/13/2015,Wonderful chicken tostado salad!  Ask for Stephanie to wait on u. She is exceptional!!!
Tyesha W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,10,2,1.0,2/9/2016,"Cheesecake Factory here gave me and my colleague food poisoning. I got the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps and Jambalaya. Cheesecake Factory use to be my favorite place to eat... Until Sunday. I became violently ill two hours after consumption. Vomiting, heavy diarrhea, stomach cramps, chills, and kidney aches. Completely awful!! There is a food handler there that needs to be fired."
Marcy M.,"San Antonio, TX",69,40,77,4.0,1/17/2013,"This place is nuts! Delicious but crazy packed. Every time I've gone it's been a minimum of a 30 min wait..at least you can wait inside the mall and kill some time. I thought it was dumb though, to buzz us for our table Saturday and the crappy attitude hostess just takes the buzzer and tells us to listen for our name...ummm....whyyyyy even buzz us?? And it's crazy loud in there...Just buzz us when it's ready to go.  We were a 3 person group and they first gave us a table for two..when I reminded her we are three she gave me this look like ""ughhhh reallly""? Walks away, guess I'll just folloooow her...I forgive her though..Lol We all have bad days. The bread basket is soo good..sourdough mmm I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger, very yummy. My favorite was the calamari appetizer...I will be going back juuuust for that!! My dude ordered moroccan chicken..that's a must have as well. Overall the experience was great and I will definitely be going back. The food is totally worth the wait!"
jesse g.,"San Antonio, TX",3,15,2,2.0,10/3/2014,"Good food, awesome server.  The silverware,  however,  was still crusty with uncleaned food. For as much as they charge,  the utensils should be sparkling like King Arthur's sword.   Must be difficult to find good workers nowadays.  Oh, and the menus were greasy and had drops of food squished between the pages. Hope their other location is doing a better job of cleanliness. Wife had the the chicken de pana, I had the spaghetti and Italian meatballs.   Appetizer was portobello,  mushroom, avocado,  zucchini fries - with a surprise extra of 1 piece of calamari and a cheese stick.  For dessert,  carrot cake cheese cake,  pineapple upside down cheese cake,  and pumpkin cheese cake.  Nap time! Total spent $72, but got plenty of take home for dinner."
Giselle C.,"San Antonio, TX",346,232,355,4.0,6/10/2013,"I had a gift card to Cheesecake Factory, and decided to splurge on lunch during a solo shopping trip.  Long story short, the chicken lettuce wrap tacos were delicious ( I had the Mexican ones), and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake that I took home to share with my family ( I managed to get 1 bite...awesome) was amazing!  I'll be going back soon to get a slice of my own!"
