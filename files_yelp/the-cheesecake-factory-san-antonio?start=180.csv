Tamara G.,"San Antonio, TX",1,3,1,5.0,3/15/2015,"Food great as always and for a beautiful Sunday afternoon,  the wait was not long at all. Must be good saw two other families from church, enjoying the good food."
Roei T.,"Houston, TX",6,20,7,3.0,11/12/2013,"We ate lunch here on a beautiful winter day, the weather was perfect, the food not so much. What I did not like: my Pit Beef sandwich was one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had in my life. The beef was virtually inedible, fatty, tough to chew, and had no ""char"" flavor at all. The horseradish sauce was flavorless. The cheese was not melted. The total sandwich was nothing short of horrible. They need to remove this item from the menu or learn how to make it correctly. I also did not like the fact that I was upsold to the largest size beer without my knowledge. Usually, the customer is asked what size he/she wants.  What I liked: the wife's Chicken Bellagio was delicious--the chicken was moist and tender, really good flavor. The accompanying pasta with pesto was a bit oily but overall it was a good dish. As usual, the portion is enormous.  The winner of the meal was the cheesecake; we got a plain piece and it was so good that we could have made a meal of that alone. It was light, airy, and very flavorful. On the strength of the cheesecake I am giving this place 3 stars."
Carlos V.,"San Antonio, TX",3,25,6,4.0,7/10/2014,"I was so impressed with the layout of the restaurant,  when I first walked in the building. The staff was completely curtious, our server Valerie did an outstanding job taking care of us as well as my grandmother.  The food, for lack of a better word, was excellent!  Everything was wonderful and we all had a great time."
Rozzi P.,"San Antonio, TX",1,11,1,1.0,2/27/2015,Waited 20 minutes for a table then got called and was told we had a table then they said oops! Going to be a bother 20 minutes. Then started taking group sizes of 3 the same as us to tables and said the tables were assigned and there was nothing they could do. Come on. Give me a break.
Jessica H.,"Cibolo, TX",1,6,,1.0,1/22/2016,"**** I am just seeing that this review was kicked back and never posted. I am reposting it now because the service was that terrible!! **** Our experience there on 08/22/2014 was HORRENDOUS! We were there for my daughter's special birthday lunch. We got there, got seated and then sat waiting for 10 minutes. It was busy, but not that busy. Then the waitress took our drink order and disappeared for another 10-15 minutes. This was at 3pm in the afternoon, fully staffed, busy, but not extremely so. We had 2 hungry preschoolers and no one even brought them bread. We got up and started to leave when the waitress intercepted us and started being really pushy about us sitting back down. She kept saying, but I have your drinks! I told her we'd had enough and started to leave again. The hostess then asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. At this point I was so angry that I said yes. The manager came out and begged us to stay, insisting that he would make sure that we were taken care of and promising my daughter that he would make her birthday special. We sat back down and were promptly served by a very nice waitress. She was the best part of a bad experience. We got our drinks and then ordered. The manager came back over and was extremely pushy about us ordering an appetizer that we did not want and didn't even get until after our food arrived. The food was ok. The salads were inedibly drenched in dressing. The kids didn't even want to eat anymore because everything had taken so long. And NO ONE came and sang Happy Birthday or brought my daughter the promised dessert or anything. DO NOT LIE TO MY CHILD ON HER BIRTHDAY!!!! After all of that, the only things comped was the appetizer that we didn't even want. We WILL NOT be back! And nor will our friends or family!"
Alexis S.,"Bryan, TX",1,11,2,2.0,1/18/2015,"Not at all satisfied! Our waiter is the only reason we didn't get up and leave. After my husband's burger came out incorrect I gave him my pasta and I ordered a salad instead for myself. then my salad came out with chicken on it when I ordered a regular Ceasar salad, got that off but then the salad was dry, then it took 14 minutes for me to get some dressing for my salad. although all of that happened, I was please that they had great customer service, and took care of us enough to where we will give them another chance!"
Amber S.,"Sugar Land, TX",244,311,44,4.0,7/10/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory was great! The hostess was very pleasant and the server was amazing! I'm afraid to say that I do not remember his name but he had just moved from Boston. His customer service skills were amazing, he was very courteous and he was very respectful.  Mrs. S and I were extremely surprised and overwhelmed with the lunch portions because we both couldn't come near to finishing them. We ordered the pizza and salad lunch combo, for those who are wondering. Mrs. S advice to the people who plan on going there is to split the meals! Save your self some cash and still feel content when leaving. -Mr. S"
Benjamin B.,"Englewood, CO",6,22,,1.0,3/14/2014,"Came to San Antonio with my family (4 others) and some have never been to the Cheesecake Factory. Waited an hour and a half for a table (typical for any restaurant on a Friday night in San Antonio), was at our table for an  hour and half before our food came out, we didn't even order anything but pasta! All together we spent 4 hours at the restaurant (mostly waiting), got our cheesecake to go frankly because we just wanted to get out of there! Got back to our hotel, they forgot to add a cheesecake. Called and told them to deliver one to the hotel immediately, spending over $100 on a meal you would expect better service. Cheesecake arrived at our hotel 3 hours later...and they brought the wrong one. Never again Cheesecake Factory, not spending my hard earned money on your laziness and carelessness."
Nicole P.,"Hartford, CT",14,65,19,3.0,6/28/2014,"Dinner was good, not outstanding and service was ok - usual far at Cheesecake Factory.  Cheesecake was awesome as I would expect.  Probably give it 3.5 stars!"
Kelsi A.,"Fort Benning, GA",0,24,3,3.0,8/11/2015,It is good food - great cheesecake but it is not some where I would go to over and over. If you don't go early you will have an hour + wait. But the original cheesecake was the best at our table - the tuxedo was second - and the resses peices was not that good (way too much going on).
Crys M.,"San Antonio, TX",1,24,7,2.0,6/25/2014,"The server ruined my lunch date :( He (Tony) took forever to come by our table, I had to wave him down each time to simply get ketchup, my desert, and a refill, all while I watch him laughing w/ his buddies, and smiling and attentively serving our neighboring tables. The check was the fastest thing i got. I was so pissed off, I still tipped him, not as much as it couldve been had i gotten better serv, I was told I shouldn't have tipped at all, but still, i wrote him a short note as well!       I  rarely come here anymore, but the food is usually really good. The avocado egg rolls are so delicious! I've tried the étouffée here and it wasn't to my liking, also to my surprise I had a couple of elbow macaroni in my dish :S .. The salmon was yummy:) the Juevos rancheros is decent, the biscuits and gravy or what not is horrible! Eww .. The ahi appetizers are very appetizing,.. They have a flavored passion tea, and it's really good fresh, I don't even add sugar to it."
Matt C.,"San Antonio, TX",9,49,91,4.0,12/8/2012,"Did someone say cheesecake? I've been to this Cheesecake Factory several times.  I enjoy coming here as the selection is vast and allows me to try something new on every visit.  In my experience service can be a little slow due to the size of this place however it's worth the wait.  Dishes that I enjoy include but are not limited to Chicken Parmesan Sandwich, Stuffed Mushrooms, and crab cakes.  Although the cheesecake is shipped in it is still delicious.  This place isn't cheap however I feel that given the quality of the food, and portions that it's a decent value."
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",308,1266,1214,4.0,8/8/2010,First time at one of these. It was pretty good. Huge menu. It took forever to finally zero in what I wanted. Our server was really nice and outgoing. Place was packed and food was good. This one was much better laid out then the one in Milwaukee.
Angela F.,"San Antonio, TX",493,464,1669,4.0,5/6/2010,"I could care less about the Cheesecake Factory with the exception of one fantastic, dream-worthy menu item: the cream of chicken and mushroom soup served on Saturdays only (soup of the day). OMFG, it is fantastic! They tend to run out around lunch time...yes, it's that good! I ask for a giant to-go container of it and they're reluctant to give up the goods cause it's so damn good/popular. Haven't had some in forever, think I'll make a special trip cause it's that make-me-happy delish. Otherwise, the Asian Chicken Salad is crunchy, tasty, jazzy, and fresh.  Love the atmosphere....very commercial, yes, but I enjoy it. Comfy and cozy. I heard they ship in all the decor/columns/etc from Italy. Not sure what the truth value to that it...."
Christine N.,"San Antonio, TX",23,153,88,5.0,6/19/2012,Who doesn't like this place!?!?  What's there not to love. I don't think i've ever had a bad dish here. The menu has so much variety sure to please everyone and let's not forget the endless assortment of cheesecakes to choose from. If you haven't been you need to go!
Kristine N.,"Denver, CO",506,1041,58,4.0,6/8/2012,"White bean chili and buffalo ranch chicken salad were big portions and really good. Only got 4 stars because it took about 10 minutes before anyone noticed us after we sat down, and it wasn't even our server but he took care of us anyway. Our real server took over when it was time to present the check."
Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,4.0,7/14/2012,"Our waiter this evening was Cory. He provide my family and myself with very good service. The Cheese Cake Factory may be a ""chain"" restaurant but the provide a highly reliable place to always get a very good bit to eat. Today was no exception! My wife and daughter ordered the sweet tea, which is consistently good, not great, but good. I ordered a traditional on the rocks Margarita. The taste was solid, but the presentation and portion for $8.95 was lacking. It was served in a cocktail glass I'd expected to see a piña colada served in, not a margarita , plus they used regular table salt and not drink salts. I will say the reason they also did not earn a full 5 stars is I always find that unless you're at the bar. It takes long between drink orders. Now the food, I ordered the always delicious Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad! I was not disappointed again , the flavors and the freshness was outstanding! Their portions can be and are often big enough to share. Not this salad. My wife had th Renee special with chicken salad sandwich, clam chowder and side salad. This too was a great choice as well. The chowder had great taste and the chunks were not rubbery. The sandwich had a solid chicken salad mix in that was just right. The kids food was so good the parents had to sample the chicken fingers. By this point we got to full for their madden array of awesome desserts. When I'm back in this area, I will stop in again, but I'll go during non- peak hours , the waits can be long. Love the bananas fosters style cheese cake!"
Aaron G.,"Ripon, CA",2,3,1,4.0,11/22/2013,I ordered the tamale appetizer and it was amazing. Also the steak Diane was good but not great. But the mashed potatoes were really good.
Brandon R.,"San Antonio, TX",25,67,43,4.0,3/28/2014,"I have a love hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory. On the one hand, I think their menu is WAAAAY too big and pricey... who needs that many choices?! That being said, some of their stuff (not all) can be really delicious. Today I tried the Santa Fe salad and was very pleased with the presentation, portion, and taste! I've tried the Avocado Egg Rolls in the past and they are okay, but I think it's the potstickers that I really like. The cheesecake isn't bad, but once again there are too many choices. It makes it very easy to think you might like something only to be disappointed when you get it. I have a piece of red velvet cheesecake waiting for me at home, so I'll update my post once I try it."
Juliana P.,"San Antonio, TX",551,124,46,3.0,4/13/2012,"It's a chain. A ridiculous chain. I'll eat here when someone wants to but its never my first choice. Luckily they do have a gluten-free menu which is pretty solid. The kitchen needs to realize when they are making something gluten-free though and still make it gluten-free!! Duh!  For what it is, it's pretty great to be honest. Solid and friendly service. For a quick lunch while at the mall it's also really convenient (unless you have to wait an hour for a table).  Eat the cheesecake and enjoy it on my behalf- no cheesecake for this gluten-free chica."
