Tina B.,"San Antonio, TX",223,89,158,5.0,8/14/2012,If you want some yummy dessert like chocolate cake try Cheesecake factory Linda's fudge chocolate cake ....you won't be disappointed!
Adam G.,"San Antonio, TX",250,259,349,4.0,8/10/2009,"I normally try to avoid places with 500 items on the menus or who are known for desserts but also sell food.  Marie Callenders and Village Inn come to mind, but whenever discussing restaurants in mixed company invariably this place finds it's way into the conversation. My wife and I decided to meet for lunch here a few days ago and see for ourselves or perhaps that should read, taste for ourselves.  I had just learned ,that day, that Cheescake Factory tries to uphold it's lofty standards by only opening one unit in each marketplace.  That fact certainly shows in the cathedral like setting of pillars, murals, planters, marble and hell I was expecting some stained glass windows and candelabras to genuflect before to pray to the God of cream cheese. One thing is for sure, the staff is very clean, well dressed and attentive like individuals who know they work for a reputable restaurant and maintain a level of professionalism that is lacking in most moderately priced chain institutions. The menu reads like a Tolstoy novel but if you have an idea of what you are in the mood for you can skip to that category and choose something in that vein.  Based on what we had I would think that whatever you choose, it would be very good. We were there at 3pm or so, which if you don't know much about restaurant culture is the best time to get in and out quickly, and there was no wait.   Being there for lunch my wife had there soup/salad/half sandwich special for about $10.  The clam chowder was very good and loaded with clams.  Her chicken salad sandwich was delicious and kept simple with big chunks of chicken and not a lot of filler.  The house blue cheese was nice and tart and perfect for the field greens.  This platter was huge and could easily be shared by two people.  I ordered the Navajo sandwich which was simply fantastic.  The combination of chicken, avacado, very ripe tomato and fried bread tasted like a southwestern version of a puffy taco without all the mess.  Also for about $10 not a bad deal for a lunch that we easily could have shared but being our first time we wanted to sample a couple of items and take the rest home. Now where your ticket average goes up is by succumbing to the $8 pieces of cheescake.  I personally don't care for cheesecake or any dessert that is heavier than the meal but we wanted to take a couple of slices home for the kids. I have heard many rave reviews of this place and have to admit that upon my first visit I was impressed and will definitely return to navigate my way through the labyrinth of menu choices to try something new next time. All and all two very enthusiastic thumbs up, great holiday fun."
Juan G.,"McAllen, TX",43,13,128,4.0,2/26/2011,"Girlfriend got us some tickets to the lakers vs spurs game on Dec. 28 so we made a trip to San Antonio. She suggested we go to the cheesecake factory as I've never been there before. The place was packed, we had to sit in the bar area which was nice. We ordered the sliders (mini burgers) for appetizer, which were good. For the entree, we both ordered the four cheeese pasta w/ alfredo sauce instead of marinara sauce. I wasn't to thrilled with what I had ordered, it just tasted like regular pasta which I've had at other restaurants. Huge restaurant, lots of seating. I was to full to order me some dessert. The next time I  frequent this place I'll order some cheesecake which looked very appealing....."
GtrWizrd A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,1.0,7/31/2015,"Prior to last night's visit I loved this place. I don't plan to go back (to this location) for a LONG time (that means probably at least a year or so). Yes it was busy because it was half-price cheesecake day but that's no excuse for a supposedly semi-classy place (ie, not Jack-in-the-Box) to have floors that are so greasy that you can barely walk in the aisles going to and from your table. Also when I left the mall-side doors were locked and the greeters kindly led me to another exit that put me into the mall where I was locked in and couldn't get out to the parking lot. So I waved my flashlight, got the managers attention, complained that the greeters should have asked me where I was trying to get to (or just automatically pointed me to the parking lot), to which he smarted off to me, saying well I'M telling you. What an ass (short, reddish hair, sort of Irish-looking). He's lucky I don't post his name up here."
Shauna J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",4,22,6,1.0,11/16/2013,omg!!!! the mac and cheese was 2 cheesy!! i hated the mac and cheese.... and they took 10-20 mins to get are drink order! it was so bad i wanted to puke!!!  bad horrible! the worst cheese cake factory ever!!!!
Samuel L.,"San Antonio, TX",16,28,,3.0,2/11/2014,"So I like to really REALLY give places a shot when it comes to rating. Whelp, unfortunately there is only so much I can say about Cheesecake Factory. First off, there aren't any reservations...what the hell is up with that?! So decided to go with my girl for an early dinner, and it was a mistake. We planned and had hoped to be eating by 530 for a possible movie after. Nope nope nope! We didn't get seated until about 6 something. As we are waiting we notice the bar area/high tables are a free for all for whomever wants. Well we are waiting behind a couple who were there before we were and it wasn't a big deal. Well these snobby ass people come and just choose to stand by the bar and in between the tables...and then proceed to make people eating uncomfortable enough they leave quickly. They then continue to take seats at an uncleaned table and wait. I wish this was policed better because I was about to crack some heads and make a mess of the place at that point. We FINALLY get seated and open the menu to see that this restaraunt doesn't know what type of food it wants to serve. It had EVERYTHING. With the risk of not specializing in a special type of food the food then becomes just mediocre. Many restaraunts have an identity, its what they make and what they are good at. Cheesecake does not know what it wants to be. After choosing a pasta dish and getting through that the only thing that was worth saving this review was the cheesecake. What would one expect since the name of the restaraunt IS THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. As we expected the cheesecake was great but not at the cost of an OKAY meal that is kind of pricey."
Melissa M.,"San Antonio, TX",61,88,37,3.0,1/13/2012,"The food can be very good, and the menu is extensive, so for big groups with varying tastes, its a great place.  The prices are reasonable for the atmosphere and the quality of food.  I love their pink lemonade cocktail, and the avacado egg rolls, and they make all their pasta dishes with fresh pasta.  But in the end it's still a chain without alot of local feel.  I'm also not a huge fan of its location (attached to the NorthStar mall) as i try to avoid malls at all costs :)  The service is typically good and its clean."
Sarah D.,"Castle Hills, TX",1,29,,3.0,9/9/2012,"This place is overpriced and overrated. They have one dish that I really like, but it's not enough to make me come back again and again. The entire place is dark and usually cold, making me feel like I'm in a cave, and it's always packed, so it's difficult to have a conversation with someone.  I understand its appeal, but it's just not for me."
Jennifer H.,"McAllen, TX",55,340,144,4.0,12/4/2011,"Review solely on cheesecake. This place at the mall was packed! We decided to just get dessert to go. It is pricey but very well worth it. Beware, it is like a million calories per slice, very thick and packed with flavor, so plan on sharing the slice of heaven. Any slice will bring you joy, my personal favorites, original, dulce de leche, and nite the 30th anniversary cake. It was layer chocolate cake and cheesecake, with crispy crust and a dollop of chocolate on top. A lot of whipped cream, too much! They packaged it very nicely and it kept nice and cool during the ride. Must have once a year experience lol, work out the next 8 months!"
Alexandra A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,4.0,10/13/2012,"This place is so good! and the location is very nice. The servers are just right, they only come around when needed and make sure your drinks are filled.  it is a little pricey but the food is well worth it. and the cheesecakes are yum!!!"
Marissa G.,"Killeen, TX",20,192,37,4.0,12/3/2011,We went on a Sunday afternoon and we were able to get lunch specials. So that was awesome.  Our over all experience was fun. So many menu options I never know what to get.
Gracie R.,"Houston, TX",12,62,22,1.0,2/10/2009,I agreed with Jai B. One of the most overrated places of all times!
Jer R.,"San Antonio, TX",15,52,52,3.0,8/7/2008,"Can I please have the Cheesecake... You can keep the overcrowded restaurant, the noise and the scary white uniforms the waiters wear around like nurses in a mental institute. (Do you have to order those all white shoes on the Dr. Scholl's hotline, because that's what I want to be for Halloween this year?) Honestly... would this restaurant even exist if it weren't for the cheesecake? (The name assumes not... claiming to be a factory where cheesecake is made...) And I think I'm gonna hold true to that assumption, and go one step further, and say, all the other food that comes out of this place is the byproduct of cheesecake production... ""Excuse me, Nurse...  I'd like to order some byproducts to spoil the taste of my perfect cheesecake.""  Sheesh! no wonder it resembles a mental institute... if you're crazy enough to ruin the taste of the cheesecake with the other overpriced food they serve, you belong at the Fruitcake Factory. Cheesecake = 5 stars Restaurant = 1 Star Overall Average = 3 Stars"
Jai J.,"San Antonio, TX",447,1391,1366,1.0,6/30/2008,Another overrated and over priced place.  Slow servers.  Rude hostesses.  No one gives a hoot about the customers.  Food - I have no issues with but I drop everything when service is horrible.
Melissa R.,"San Antonio, TX",39,29,29,4.0,6/22/2011,"had my first visit last night here.  Had a shiner at the bar and may i say it was as a beer should be but at times isnt.  Especially Shiner needs to be ice cold, and delicious going down especially after a long day.  Bread is spectacular both the brown and sour dough? Hard to keep from eating.  We had fried cheese which is one of my faves which i always order, that was mediocre.  The roasted pear, blue cheese and arugula pizzette appetizer was different but delicious, and especially because I normally dont like blue cheese.  The combination of the salty blue cheese with sweet pear and fresh arugula made my taste buds dance.  I ordered the meatloaf but to my surprise had mushrooms in it and the sauce!  Did I mention I am allergic to mushrooms, thank god I only had a little bite with hardly any gravy.  I made sure that it didnt state mushrooms on the menu before bringing it to their attention, and it was not on the menu like most of their dishes do have ""mushrooms"".  They were quick however to get a new order in and defintely redeemed theirselves with ""the Cuban""  crunchy outer bread, soft on the inside with cheese ooozing out.  Pork was defintely slow roasted and tender, perfect amount of mustard, pickle, ham and roasted pork.  I worked in a cuban restaurant in Tampa where we specialized in cubans and this is the best one in SA so far and so surprising to find it at cheesecake factory by accident.  To end finished it with a pina colada cheesecake with a coffee.  Coffee was devine, pina colada very light flavored and fluffy, couldnt taste the cheesecake though.  Over all I will be back to try new dishes, despite the flaw of mushrooms in the meatloaf it was bittersweet. P.S.  Had a taste of pasta carbonara from which I had first hand in Italy before.  This was an americanized version as to they put eggs in the italian version but not safe in the US.  It was so creamy, with smoked bacon flavor will defintely be back for my own plate, and not many Italian restaurants have it glad this place does."
Jamie K.,"Lake Dallas, TX",997,757,160,1.0,4/15/2008,"So the fact that I absolutely L.O.V.E. their cheesecake should automatically give this place 5 stars. But I have to admit I wasnt that impressed the 2 times I ate here.  My first experience was a little better because our server was ok and my salad tasted pretty good. We were also in a group of 25+ and they were timely with our meals. But the 2nd time I came here with my husband truely pissed me off.  First off the food took forever and we have a 2 yr old....so you can not leave a family with a toddler with no refils of drinks or bread for over 40 minutes. By the time the food came I was over it. I put the pizza in a TO GO box and we left. As we were leaving we noticed my husbands hat was missing from inside our stroller. He asked several hosts if it dropped or if someone grabbed it. After a few people gave him the run around he left. Furious as I was I went back in and asked for a manager since all 3 hostess insisted that only a manager could open the lost and found cabinet. After I patiently waited for almost another 15 minutes with still no manager...I quickly stopped another hostess and asked about the hat. She gave me a dirty look and then reached under the register and pulled out the hat. It was shoved up behind the plugs and was covered in dust. Obviously not in the ""locked"" lost and found cabinet. She apparently knew where the hat was all along. The hat wasnt even expensive. It was a $20 hat from American Eagle. But she insisted that a manager was the only one who could check for me when she knew where it was all along. I will never return to this location...PERIOD"
Chris S.,"Arlington, TX",11,36,5,3.0,7/11/2011,Who doesn't love Cheescake?  although they don't just serve cheescake. They serve lunch and dinner and even a Sunday Brunch . I always get the hibachi steak.  the restaurant is always clean and staff is very polite. Atmosphere is romantic  with candles on the tables.  Great for a date .
Brenda R.,"Schertz, TX",5,41,,5.0,6/4/2013,"I've never been disappointed eating at The Cheesecake Factory; it had been awhile since I've eaten at one.  I selected the avocado rolls as an appetizer, the lunch-size portion of the four cheese pasta with shrimp and a slice of red velvet cheesecake.  Heaven on earth.  The service was excellent; thought the 18% gratuity that was automatically added in was a bit much, but we did have a group of about 20."
Emily R.,"San Antonio, TX",2,7,4,4.0,6/22/2011,"Have been several times and was just there last night. If you are looking for a quick bite this is not the place to come. There is always a wait but once you are seated the service is good and the food is delicious! Everything I have ever tried has been delicious! Several times I have asked for waiter recommendatins and they are always great.  The Chicken Madiera is lightly crisped and topped with mushrooms and asparagus and has a wonderful flavor. The Cuban sandwich was probably the best I've had since I was in Florida. The bread was deliciou, the meatwas tender and juicy, the cheeses was abundant and melted perfectly. I've had teh Pasta Carbonara and Pasta Da Vinci which are two of my favorites!!!  I just tried the roasted pear and blue cheese pizzette and it was delicious!! I am not a big blue cheese fan but I loved this appetizer. My husband loves the Farmhouse burger that comes with a piece of pork/bacon and a fried egg on top of teh patty. The portions are definitely large but I always know when I eat there that I will have leftovers for another time."
Miss M.,"San Antonio, TX",10,24,5,4.0,3/20/2010,Then enviroment here is so awsome!  The food is okay and the beer is delicioust!!
