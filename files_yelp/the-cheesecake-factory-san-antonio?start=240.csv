Dolph M.,"San Antonio, TX",19,305,360,2.0,12/13/2007,"Atmosphere, as with any Cheesecake Factory, is cool. Assuming you can swallow the ridiculous prices of the cheesecakes, that's all you should get. They're pretty good... but avoid the rest of the menu. It sucks. And ticket times are RIDICULOUSLY long."
Nichole N.,"Austin, TX",1,19,,4.0,11/16/2009,"I'll admit this place can be a pain when it's busy (weekends, holidays, special events) but the cheesecake is fantastic and the food is on par too. I've always had a decent waiter and though when it's busy the service lacks a bit, I have always been taken care of if something went wrong. In my opinion, it's not overpriced because the quality of food here is simply better. If you're looking for cheap and predictable head over to Chili's but if you want something a little more creative, stick it out because the food is delish!"
Javier L.,"San Antonio, TX",26,59,,3.0,5/6/2010,"I've been to the cheesecake factory many times (you know girls & there cheesecake), and found it average & overpriced.  I almost gave it 2 stars, because if you go on a weekend, you will have to wait forever to be seated, and the food is overpriced.  The reason for 3 stars is if you go on a weekday (not Friday night), you can get seated pretty quick  and get pretty decent service, and you will avoid all the Kelly's (that's what me and my friends call underage highschool kids).  If you are over 21, and want to take a date to this place, I say pass and go somewhere less expensive with better food."
Joyce R.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,,1.0,11/30/2013,"This place is terrible. As a single adult when I eat out I tend to eat at the bar. I enjoy being able to watch football and have a meal. That being said, when a restaurant has a bar it should always be a kids free zone. If you have to be 21 to order a drink you should have to be 21 to sit there. I was watching college football drink in hand and ordered a salad to start when a couple came in with a child of about 4. This kid immediately starts pulling all of the beverage napkins out of the holder and strewing them all over the bar. Did I mention that the parents sat the kid in the stool directly beside me. They could have at least put their ill behaved child in between them.  The mother then pulls a sharpie out of her purse to let the kid color on the napkins and the bar. At this point the little paper napkins are all over the bar the floor and practically in my food. I'm sorry i don't want to eat in a trash pit so i finish my salad and pay my bill. Before heading to the door I ask the manager on duty why this small child is allowed to sit at the bar and allowed to interrupt my meal while the parent ignore the child. Don't you have a policy about small children and the bar. I was clearly told that since the state of Texas doesn't have a law that prohibits children at a bar they leave it to parents. Well Mr. Manager you and the parents of ill behaved children can have you bar because I won't be back. To other who are reading this, I am a mother of grown children, and a grandmother I would not let my children or grandchild sit at a bar until they are of legal age because it is simply inappropriate. The conversations at bars can be lewd and during sport event foul mouthed. Not something a small child should be near."
Daryl T.,"Waukegan, IL",47,92,58,4.0,4/17/2009,Why is there soo much hate for this place! I have been here plenty of times and the hostess and waiters seems to be doing a pleasant job. Food seems to take some time but the portions are big and hefty and friggin awesome. The pasta dishes are pretty good. Better than olive garden since there prices are pretty expensive too during dinner. Besides all these damn one stars are just for the service. Were are here for the friggin food guys....come on!!!!!!
Shawna E.,"San Antonio, TX",13,18,,5.0,8/15/2006,One of my favorite restaurants for any meal.  Love everything on the very detailed menu and the decor and service are excellent.
Kristy S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,25,,3.0,1/13/2011,Yummy cheesecakes and the avocado eggrolls are delicious! But I've never had an entree I was really wowed by.  Also pricey. Good for a date night but wouldn't recommend for families.
Jennifer E.,"San Antonio, TX",12,120,26,4.0,6/30/2008,"wow, some people hate the cheesecake factory.  honestly i think their food is awesome.  yes its ritzy, long wait time etc, but shit the damn place is in northstar mall for gods sake.  i would start off with a strawberry lemonade to drink, they bring it with sugar around the rim and its sooo fresh.  for appetizer try the spicy tuna ahi roll, OMGGGG, bad ass sushi roll, or the buffalo blasts, which is like this chicken cheese empanda style treat.  also, the fried macaroni and cheese ?  out of this world, brought to you on a plate of marinara sauce, yum!  for entree i stick with what i know, either the ""tons of fun burger"" or the ""big five"" pizza, with either, a huge side of their ranch, that ranch is addictive.  the tons of fun burger is a double meat burger with this awesome sauce, (you should share this beast, you'd have to be homer simpson to eat this whole thing), i never really ever make it to the cheesecake (sadly) though yes, they have amazing cheesecake (pretty much a given)"
