Rachael T.,"San Antonio, TX",1,15,1,1.0,1/27/2017,"Just got back from my lunch break here, & I can honestly say that I just had one of the worst service experiences I've ever had...in my life. Sad, because I've enjoyed their food, just at different locations.  To begin, my & another coworker got there at 11am when we were pretty much the only customers there. Ordered our food around 11:10-I also got a salad to come out before my meal. I received my salad at around 11:50, & we received our food a couple minutes after. & let's not forget that our food came out separately. Seriously? There was only 2 of us. I'm unaware of a place where it takes 45 minutes to cook pasta & a sandwich.  We barely saw our server, so she wasn't of any help. To top it all off, we had to get back to work so I literally got to eat the complimentary bread & that's it. Our server sent the manager to our table, but she was literally of no help. Useless. We took our food to go. Yay--I paid almost $20 for a plate of food that I get to not even eat, & just take back to work with me."
Christina T.,"San Antonio, TX",12,93,21,3.0,4/5/2017,"Usually their food is good. I'm giving them 3 stars because half of the $122 order was correct and tasty. The egg roll sampler comes with avocado egg rolls, southwestern egg rolls, cuban ones and salmon ones. I substituted the salmon ones for more cuban ones and they tasted like tuna fish. They were also cold, greasy and the acocado was brown. Plus they forgot one of the sauces.  My stuffed chicken was just a casserole. It said on the menu ""stuffed corn tortillas"" with chicken. These were just laid in there with a bunch of stuff on top and was cold as well.  I spoke to the manager and he didn't offer my money back nor to come pick up fresher food. I only wanted the egg rolls refunded or fresh ones and my chicken plate made fresh. I go there all the time and they do make mistakes, but not usually cold food."
John R.,"Fredericksburg, TX",221,16,2,2.0,7/22/2017,"This restaurant is so damn loud!  We've been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories and even the one at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas is more quiet!  They tried telling us that seating us in the bar area was considered a dining room.  When asked to be seated somewhere else, we were told we'd have to go back on the waiting list.  That's crap!  We love Cheesecake Factory but will NEVER come back to this location."
Javy G.,"San Antonio, TX",1,9,1,2.0,8/13/2017,"Today's was just eh.  If it wasn't for the food being on par as always, then I'd probably have more say about the challenges between service and the kitchen.   First we got sat like sardines as a 4 top next to two 7 tops with both of the extra chairs squeezing us in.  Secondly,  my wife's order had her side messed up and was overlooked (sweet potato fries and we got regular).  Water cup was empty for 10 minutes and the beer I order between apps and lunch came during dessert and it was warm.  The frosted mug wasn't frosted and it's 3:40 on a Sunday.  Disappointed"
Muñeca J.,"Converse, TX",0,4,1,3.0,4/30/2016,"I have been to this location several times before and I've always been pleased with the service and the food.  Yesterday was a different story. I had a friend visiting from out of town who had come up to her son's graduation at Fort Sam. We went to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate after his graduation. I ordered my usual Spicy Cashew Chicken (which I love). Only to find that the chicken was not thoroughly cooked. I notified my server, who had the manager come over. The manager proceeded to tell me that the chicken was cooked... although the chicken was PINK!  I was so upset not because the chicken wasn't done, but because the manager treated me like an idiot who does not know what cooked chicken looks like. He could've just apologized. The only reason I'm giving three stars is because of all the other positive experiences I've had at this Cheesecake Factory."
Shanita M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,1,1.0,6/4/2017,"I have not eaten at the Factory in over 3yrs. Decided to revisit a few reviews to decide which location was best. Neither locations had the reviews I look for. Settled for the location nearest home.  Arrived at the restaurant and luckily, we didn't have much of a wait. The place was pretty busy. While sitting, we waited only 5mins and then our server arrived. I am not new to CS, and have been extremely disappointed by the lack of it in restaurants. He took our drink order and left for 10mins. Upon our wait, we noticed the table who was seated after us were receiving bread. We did not get that. We asked the lady server if everyone gets bread, she said yes. We then asked our server, Eric R, if everyone was supposed to get bread. He confirmed. Did not apologize for not offering nor did he offer after I asked, just asked me if I knew what I wanted to order. I noticed Eric would move around us and tend to the tables next to us more than our and when he made eye contact with me, would act as if he did not and walk away. Eric did not come back asking us about anything. One time he stopped and poorly refilled our drinks. Reaching over my food to poor ice from one cup into my cup and then tea. I don't know where that cup of ice came from because he did not come directly to my table with those items.  Every time we mentioned something we needed he would replay with an annoyed demeanor and not giving us undivided attention, answering while walking away. Disgusting. I give this a one because I am huge on service. Yes the food was good but the restaurant industry needs to better train. Where is the hospitality? I will not be eating here again."
ZGabbs T.,"San Antonio, TX",91,5,4,1.0,2/22/2017,"I almost always order the Louisiana Chicken pasta with spaghetti noodles as a substitute to the bow tie pasta.  It has been pretty consistent in the past, but sadly that all ended today when I got home and realized all the noodles in my dish was over cooked times 2 and the presentation was sloppy! I even found all sorts of other types of noodles in my food.  It looked so terrible I couldn't even fathom the thought of eating it.  Called the management and all they could offer was to mail me a gift card. I suggested that I could go by tomorrow and pick up a fresh dish, but he declined that.  I really just should be given my money back because after this ordeal I don't want to return to use this gift card."
Anneli K.,"San Antonio, TX",1,17,3,2.0,5/26/2017,"There is ZERO excuse for two slices of cheesecake to go to take 25 minutes from the time I was rung up to the time I had my order. The only reason I got my take-out order that soon was because I went back up to ask where it was. In those 25 minutes, servers and management were around and behind the counter screwing around as though they didn't have customers still waiting. If it weren't for the fact that their product tastes good, this would have been a 1-star review."
carissa t.,"Scott AFB, IL",1,30,,2.0,4/29/2017,"After being out of the country for a few years, I was super excited to bring my family for their first-ever CCF experience (also my son's birthday). What a huge disappointment when compared to my last visit years ago....the menu has changed and not for the better; our food all came out at different times, leaving the birthday boy sitting for about 5-10 minutes while all the rest of the table had their meals; the food itself was ""meh"" at best. I had crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp; I've definitely had better-tasting dishes from a frozen box. Not only that, I nearly choked on what I thought was a piece of pineapple, but turned out to be a pineapple-chunk-sized piece of ginger. Ouch. My son's kid-sized pizza and our buffalo strips also looked and tasted like they came from a freezer. I have no problem paying for good food, but this wasn't. The 2 stars are for the drinks (Long Island actually had some kick to it and milkshakes were huge and tasty) and service. We had 2 different servers due to shift change (Christian and Juliette, I think?) and they were both very attentive (not their fault the kitchen couldn't get their timing together). Overall though, I don't plan on coming back anytime soon, if ever.  If this is an example of what CCF has become, it's no wonder Penny wanted to quit"
Laviana H.,"San Antonio, TX",10,68,5,5.0,3/11/2017,Went to this jewel today . I haven't been here in a long time & I'm so glad that I decided to stop by . I ate @ the bar . Corina was my bartender. I hadn't been to the cheesecake in  10 months . I used to go twice a week . She still remembered me . I had the edamame has an appetizer. Yummy !! I had the chicken avocado club . Double YUM . The portions are huge . The prices are more than reasonable for the quality & quantity of food you're receiving . I'll definitely start coming back more often .
Bethany B.,"San Antonio, TX",70,10,4,5.0,7/16/2017,"My husband and I came for lunch with our three month old. Danielle M. was our waitress. She was very prompt and super polite! The food was amazing! Was slightly surprised how much my Moscow mules cost when we got the check, but they were delicious. We don't come here often, but love it everytime we do. Parking was a bit rough, but overall, great experience!"
Elliot P.,"San Antonio, TX",73,12,,5.0,6/13/2017,"I brought my wife here after we got her nails done down the street for a couple slices of cheesecake. They have so many to choose from it's ridiculous! Great service by the waitstaff, clean bathrooms, great atmosphere. You can't go wrong eating here even if it's just for desert."
Hoa L.,"San Antonio, TX",128,341,596,4.0,6/22/2015,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory a few times, but this time must be the best in service and food. I came with a friend and we ordered the Chicken Madeira and Thai lettuce wraps.  Both came out superb in flavor and portion size. I enjoy the flavor of the chicken and also the fact that it is not too heavy and comes with a warm side of mashed potatoes. Definitely, the definition of home cooked meals and comfort food without the extreme calories.  The lettuce wraps are a bit messy, but I like how they use the butter lettuce. It gives a softer flavor and wraps better. It's also a great portion size.  We also ordered a slice of cheesecake, which is definitely a must-do when going to The Factory.  Our service was great and the waitress continued to offer us water and service even when we were done eating and just chatting away. Surprisingly, it was not too busy around 7pm on a weekday."
Mario A.,"San Marcos, TX",18,5,,3.0,5/13/2017,"The host was very pleasant upon arrival. I enjoyed the scenery and designed. The menu is vast so it does take some time to order. I ordered a combination dish ""steak Diane"" with Salmon which the price is decent. However when I tasted the food, I was a but disappointed. The steak sauce is superb but the steak was bland and needed much more seasoning. I wasn't pleased with the Salmon sauce as it was a bit sour and Salmon was bland with no flavor."
Lori B.,"San Antonio, TX",65,25,10,1.0,5/13/2017,"The worst customer service ever. Sat at the bar open seating ,ordered, then a bigger table opened up and we moved within the bar then was notified the low tops are not open seating and we needed to move right when our appetizers came out. The manager cancelled our food and sent it back only to say she would get us another table and reorder our food"
Patrick M.,"Hewitt, TX",0,4,12,5.0,6/25/2017,"Last night 6/24/17 I was stupid and had not eaten that day before dinner and also had neglected to take my medications for Type 2 diabetes.  My blood sugar dropped very low and I almost passed out while waiting on our table.   I had never experienced that before and honestly it was pretty frightening.   Somehow I had the presence of mind to walk over to the bar and blurt out my situation and ask for a coke.   A very astute young lady who worked there quickly recognized my plight in the middle of a busy night and hurriedly requested one for me from the bartender.  I downed the soda and the moment passed.    If anyone there knows who this young lady was, please pass on my most sincere thanks for not dismissing me and providing assistance when I was in need.  It may have seemed like a small thing, but it meant a lot to me.  Thank you."
Anna R.,"San Antonio, TX",109,99,1209,4.0,3/2/2015,"What an amazing dinner we all had together! I will start with a very small negative and move on to our 5 star dinner. We must have been seated under the speakers at our table for 7. The music was too loud to carry a conversation without having to elevate our voices in order to hear one another. Food=wow! I love that there were several at our table who ordered salmon and all 4 of us had a different salmon dish. I ordered the Salmon Genovese. This was prepared pan seared with tomatoes, green beans, roasted artichokes and a hint of lemon. Under the salmon laid a nice portion of couscous and it was surrounded by a moat of basil almond pesto sauce. I am a pesto maker and I know good pesto-this was prepared with almonds which had a unique and wonderful taste. I will order this again!  Everyone was raving about their food. We passed around the chocolate tower dessert. Several ordered coffee. Love this place!"
Nicole L.,"Converse, TX",34,5,3,1.0,12/31/2016,Customer service is bad. They charge us something that we cancelled. Manager isn't helpful... never go back...
Jacqueline J.,"San Antonio, TX",437,168,935,5.0,2/14/2015,"I Thoroughly enjoyed my Valentine's Meal at the Cheesecake Factory today.  I slipped into the bar and ordered the orange Chicken and Banana Cream cheesecake off of the lunch menu.  As I expected the line was out the door, so a quick peak at an empty stool had me zigzagging to the barstool.   I was served rather quickly and my meal was incredible. To top it off for 12.95, the portion rivaled that of my favorite PF Changs. After shopping on a hectic Valentine's Day, a wonderful meal at one of my favorite establishments made my day~ Now off to see 50 Shades of Gray to Complete this Fabulous Weekend!!!"
