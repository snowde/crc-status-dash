Virginia A.,"Houston, TX",264,9,,2.0,3/14/2017,"Please save your money and skip this establishment. Overpriced. Overrated. And under appreciative of their guests.  Visit started with arriving around 8:30pm and told a 30 minute wait. Our buzzer went off roughly around 30 minutes later, great. Hostess took our pager and told us to step to the right and wait - no specific area - just wait to the right... where everyone waiting for a table is standing. We proceeded to wait for another 15 minutes with still nothing, confused if we had been overlooked since we were just standing in the middle of a crowd. The whole time I am making eye contact with the hostess and nothing. I had to approach the hostess to figure out what was happening. 5 more minutes pass and then she gives us some story about some other person had claimed our table because they are calling out names (then why the pagers???) and we would be taken to a booth. Arrive to our table and it's a small 2 top. Okay....  needless to say, the rest of the experience went downhill. Our waiter, despite being very nice (1 star) was more concerned with the larger tables around us than us. Appetizer was very good (egg roll sampler - responsible for other 1 stars). Our entrees finally came out after a long time and were barely warm at best. Neither my boyfriend and I were impressed (he got one of the combo steak and chicken plates and I got the herb salmon plate - do not recommend either). Refills took forever and despite our entrees, we were going to order a cheesecake because, surely, they couldn't mess that up. But of course, our waiter disappeared for 20 minutes caring for the table of 3 who was drinking next to us and never stopped by in the 3 times he came to their table while we had gathered plates and napkins on the table. We decided once he had come to us to not get dessert as we lost the desire to spend more money.  If you are going to spend good amount of money to eat here - they need to work on their customer experience. I will not be back and I'll be sure to let friends and family know to save the money."

Melissa T.,"San Antonio, TX",287,121,64,3.0,11/27/2016,Can't ever go wrong with tuxedo cheesecake. Service is lacking and food is average. Tuxedo cheesecake is the ONLY reason I come here.
Camille M.,"San Antonio, TX",63,18,4,4.0,1/4/2017,"I had caesar salad, macaroni and cheese burger, and strawberry short cake. Loved everything  except the salad the dressing was very bitter. I recommend the burger with all the sauce on the side like I did. I was very grateful for it too. The cheese sauce that was supposed to go on the burger was nasty cheese like the kind you put on concession stand nachos. I had a lovely waitress named Melissa and she did a great job."
Jennifer S.,"San Antonio, TX",56,121,251,4.0,11/30/2015,Always leaving happy.  Ordered Irish coffee and was delicious.  Ordered fried cheese and was great for sharing.  Ordered lunch portion of spicy chicken chipotle pasta... Hubby ordered this not sure I would like but it was delicious !!! Perfect to share !! Bar staff super nice !!!
Robert M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,,1.0,9/4/2017,You have probably lost a customer. So frustrated. I called and specifically asked if I could purchase a celebration cheesecake for a birthday. No problem come on over the person on the phone said. Get to the restaurant. Oh. I'm sorry we don't have enough to be selling a whole one. We can sell you 10 slices to make a whole cake but would need to charge you for 10 individual slices. WHAT?! Not going to be buying a cheesecake from here again. Went with another cake. Screw this place.
Gil C.,"Spring Branch, TX",172,68,143,3.0,8/2/2016,"If you like a wide variety of choices this is the place for you... over 300 items on their menu!  Including their fairly new skinylicious choices. They have a full bar if this is your thing.  Nice selection of breads while you wait.  Nice appetizers and of cource, cheesecakes!"
Gabriel R.,"Dumas, TX",11,18,10,1.0,4/24/2017,I do not mind paying for good food BUT when food is expensive and the food comes out cold ( mind you im not one to complain to the wait staff ) i get very upset and i will no longer eat at that restaurant.
Crystal G.,"San Antonio, TX",29,23,10,5.0,2/12/2017,I absolutely love this place. There is nothing I haven't tried that was not delicious. My favorite  this is the Chicken Madeira and the Chicken Bellagio. Must trys for sure.  And don't forget to leave room for dessert.
Brittany R.,"San Marcos, TX",96,1,,1.0,4/18/2017,"First time here. We were seated quickly so that was nice. Service was slow though. Waitress was friendly but she forgot our waters we asked for along with our teas. My utensils were disgusting and had dried food on them. We ordered, food took awhile to come out but I mean they were alittle busy it's dinner after all. I found pieces of foil in my food so they took it away and brought me another, again food took awhile to come out my boyfriend was pretty much done with his meal by the time I got mine. By then I was already full from the appetizer we had ordered and the bread at the table so I only had a few bites. Cheesecakes was good! I just wanted to take my boyfriend to a nice birthday dinner since this is the first we've celebrated together and it was not a great experience. Unfortunately we will not be returning."
Rello R.,"Chicago, IL",1,33,7,5.0,4/7/2017,"I love this place. Even though I know I shouldn't eat cheesecake that red velvet cheesecake is a must have. It's like a little piece of awesomeness in every bite. The food is really good. I have been exploring the menu now and everything appears to be good. I haven't had one thing that I did not like yet so far. The service is always outstanding and the servers are pretty at this location!!! Can't beat good service, food, and looks!!! What more can 1 ask for. Great spot for any occasion go try it if you haven't!!!"
Stephanie C.,"San Antonio, TX",21,16,7,2.0,1/28/2017,"This location has really gone downhill. We were seated in the bar this time and it smells like stale mop water and filth -- not like delicious food.  The drinks, even a Long Island iced tea, were watered down.  The food on a busy Saturday is still great, but bread comes late and our waiter was v e r y  s l o w.  Not worth the price of the check, for sure.  Good thing they peddle the best cheesecake in the city.  Two in the pink, one in the stink folks!"
Jay R.,"Cypress, TX",0,13,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Terrible experience at dinner on a Monday night, we arrived at 630 pm to a mostly empty restaurant. We were seated at one of the small tables that have the shared bench and the hostess pulled one of the small tables over to make room for 4. I noticed immediately that there was a significant amount of food debris that was uncovered French fries, green beans, some large brown smashed bits what appeared to be the remains of some long gone chicken fried steak. The mess appeared to be several days old and not just left over from that day's lunch. The hostess didn't seem to recognize it or was not bothered by it and I was willing to overlook it thinking they would simply clean it up before our drinks arrived. Sadly the food and mess sat on the floor, to watch the entire ordeal we went through that night. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and my coworker, a fried catfish plate. The food arrived quickly and looked pleasing. However I checked my fish and found it to be roughly 10% cooked and very raw. I asked our waiter to have the kitchen manager come to the table so I could educate him on the quality of food leaving his kitchen and I showed him the undercooked fish and he apologized and said he would send the server back to take my order for a replacement. Fast forward 15 minutes, or server never returned, we sat there empty drinks on the table my coworker finished his meal and finally flagged down our server who appeared to only have 1 other table. It was at this point asked to speak to the restaurant manager. He was apologetic but seemed to be very uncaring about the problems with his slow inattentive wait staff, unclean floor in the dining area and poor quality of food coming out of the kitchen.  The catfish dinner was comped and we walked out to never return. If you go for dessert you might be safe but they are not cleaning the dining area I'm almost afraid of what the kitchen looks like."
Sean T.,"San Antonio, TX",104,252,255,5.0,11/28/2015,"Bring on the calories! I read a previous review that said the place isn't that great, everything has more than 1000 calories... uh yeah so... eating out mean enjoying your food and calories are a part of that. The place isn't dirty...I've had the privilege of going to 4 different establishments in different parts of the country and first hats off is to the consitency, despite a very large menu.  For those seeking less calories, go with the skinny menu, don't eat the bread or stay home.  Everytime the service has been prompt, friendly, AND despite being as busy as it always is I get what I need in a timely manner.  Everytime they quoted a time to be able to sit and wait for a table they have had us seated sooner than expected.   If you are in a rush, try dining during the week.  I also recommend figuring out what you are craving prior to looking at the menu, chicken, salad, pasta, seafood, theres quite a remarkable selection.  I have had the Mahi Salad, coffee (superb), Asian salad, vegetable salad (organic) , burgers, steaks, spaghetti, meatballs, and a different cheesecake every time.  The wine selection is as good as anywhere as well.   Overall a definite 5 stars.  Cheesecakes are delish, with a cup of fresh coffee hard to match. Price/value - quality and quantity coupled with quick and professional service.  Negative reviewers must've had a bad day."
Celeste B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,4,1.0,7/15/2017,"Service is great, BUT the apple crisp is absolutely HORRIBLE! Not sure how it's on the menu considering everything else we've had with all previous visits are very good. I wish I took a picture to share. Nevertheless I gave it a try. It tasted like 5 pounds of sugar over canned apples, served warm with cinnamon and oatmeal thrown on top; and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. You could go into a diabetic coma with just a few bites. Extremely disappointed with this dessert. Please take it off the menu and don't rip people off!"
Jason J.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,1,1.0,2/7/2017,Over rated and over priced for all you mr.krabs out there the cheapest meal and appetizer is $13 kids meals are 7.50 so save your money and don't come here UPDATE: 02/07/2017 I came back once more to give them a redemption but yet another fail by them we arrived at 6 and got sat down immediately we ordered at 6:15 and we got the food literally one fucking hour later I'm pissed tf off the waiter hardly came to us and to top it if the bread was harder then my pecker  and harder then my wife's nipples before we fuck and my burger was burnt af
Lauren D.,"San Antonio, TX",6,9,160,5.0,3/22/2016,"Huge menu, it's all great too from their skinny menu to burgers to fish to pasta to dessert to coffee, yummmmmm!!"
Mandy O.,"Edinburg, TX",0,21,12,5.0,7/9/2017,"I stop by when I am in town and have yet to be disappointed. My main complaint....too much food! It is so good that I want to finish the whole plate, but I end up way too full. This last time I tried the Tamale Cakes and really enjoyed them. I also wish the two seat tables were not so close together. One side shared a long booth seat, so all were close together, hard to hold a conversation. All and all, they were busy, but the food was great and for that I can overlook the seating issue."
Iz S.,"San Antonio, TX",1,119,12,5.0,6/15/2016,"Took the family to celebrate my wife's birthday and we were not disappointed.  After reviewing the 20 page menu, we decided on fried mac n cheese,  4 pasta dinner, chicken avocado sandwich and cheese/herb chicken. All was delicious and the service was fast. Naturally,  we ordered dessert (to go), as we had no room in the tummies. There was no wait to be seated (lunch) and the waiter was great! A definite must if you haven't been."
Deztany F.,"Canyon Lake, TX",0,21,10,4.0,2/15/2017,"I've been to cheesecake before and such good food! Last night i went for a Valentine's dinner, and every steak they were out of! I can't blame them, it was Valentines day and 9:30pm. Our waiter Josh took good care of us, even other waiters walking by checked on us. I'm pregnant and all i wanted was a steak so we ended up leaving without eating an entree, but not mad! We understood and thanked them :-)"
