Joshua G.,"Dallas, TX",315,66,20,4.0,3/20/2016,"While having my vehicle serviced nearby, I was dropped off at North Star Mall and stopped in for lunch. The wait time was a bit long, hopefully the soon to be opening restaurant across the hall will help relieve this strain. I ended up finding a seat at the bar, which was fine since I was alone. A delicious flavored mojito from the friendly bartender was made quickly, and tasted fresh. I was looking for a light and quick meal, so i chose the Ahi Capriccio. For the price, I was a little disappointed in the portion size. Yes, it fills the plate, but it's paper thin. I feel like a tad more would be great, and still qualify for their ""lighter fare"" menu. Unfortunately, I did not sample a dessert this time, but hopefully my next visit will include one of the many mouth-watering sweet  options I saw being served around me."
Danny M.,"Spring Branch, Houston, TX",41,7,5,3.0,6/30/2016,Arrived around 9pm after six flags. Waiter did not offer or bring any bread. Ordered grilled pork chop and he also forgot to bring us steak knives and napkins. I was half way done when he brought them.  Food was good so i gave 3 stars due to service.
Terrius W.,"San Antonio, TX",37,55,128,5.0,6/27/2016,"Absolutely the best menu ever. Tons of different dishes to choose from. Every one that I have tried was perfect. Cocktails are a bit pricey, but worth every cent. Sunday brunch was a surprise! A pleasant surprise. Appetizers are fast,hot, and fresh. I like the shrimp and the fried portobello. And what is in that amazing sauce? The desert???? Magnificent"
Gil G.,"Brownsville, TX",2,59,37,1.0,10/10/2016,Sever took way too long to show up and all the  silverware and plates were obviously not washed well.  Old food was stuck on every piece on my table and on the silverware on the table next to me as well. Walked out.  You have to assume all the cookware is cleaned and used in the same manner.  Not even for the cheesecake. GROSS!!
Mark D.,"San Antonio, TX",1,42,29,1.0,6/23/2016,Disappointed is all I can say. I ordered a sparkling water as my drink and then another. My waiter took it from our table before I was even done. Didn't wanna make a big deal being that we were with my mother in law. Little did I know that her eggplant parmesean was over cooked and be for we got a chance to mention it our check was on the table.  My wife with half a plate left and my mother in law with a whole plate. Not a very good experience for such a great restaurant.
Jason H.,"Kyle, TX",167,22,1,1.0,10/17/2016,"I didn't even want to put one star. I went in there yesterday and almost didn't even eat there. I have a service dog and it is against federal regulation and against the law to badger someone about having his/her service animal. The manager Michelle, came up to me and asked me if he's a service animal, which is already against the law, but even after saying ""yes"" she requested to see a certificate. Which I don't know who would carry around a plaque with their certificate in it. I would never eat here again!"
Julie G.,"San Antonio, TX",370,322,1891,3.0,3/30/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a decent last resort for anyone looking to overpay and get sketchy service.  We come here every once in a while during lunch to share their fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and a Greek salad. I really like that their lunch specials carry on until 5:00pm. Of course, my favorite part about coming here is enjoying the warm sourdough bread before your meal. The fettuccine is consistently good and the sauce is not overpowering, try it. The sandwiches are decent, meatloaf is OK, chicken picatta is nothing to brag about and every time I've ordered the salmon I left with a tummy ache. When I do decide on splurging, I'll go with the fresh banana cream cheesecake...YUMMY!  The staff are not personable and they definitely don't care for people who share plates, my goodness the portions are HUGE. Almost every time we've come here they've treated us differently when we say we're sharing and the table next to us gets smiles and constant drink refills.  Parking is chaotic in the mall area and valet is even riskier. Make sure to save your receipts after your meal to show the valet guys for your free parking. The last time I visited they were doing construction on their valet parking area and my parking anxiety was in high gear because people were honking and waiting in long lines to get their car parked.  If we're really craving pasta then we'll come to Cheesecake and tolerate their service. Yo, Cheesecake Factory people, spread the word that customer service needs to be revamped and the prices need to stop being tampered with."
A C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,2.0,1/26/2017,"I moved here a little over a year and I love trying new restaurants that we don't have back home (I come from a US territory) so I was excited for the ""CHEESECAKE FACTORY.""  We (party of 2) were so disappointed. We were sat at the same time the couple next to us were. First thing we noticed was the silver ware was all dirty each and every piece, I thought to just wipe it, but it was chunks of food. So we asked for plastic utensils instead. We ordered one appetizer each and one entree each and told the waiter this all at once so he wouldn't have to come back for our entree order. Well we received our appetizers same time as the couple next to us, but then they received their entrees and we waited a good 30 mins, which then turned into 1 hour. The couple next to us got their bill, we were still waiting for our entrees, two noodle dishes). Our waiter finally came back, but not to check on us, he went to get the other couples check from the table. We flagged him down to ask about our food to which he gave an attitude after we asked to have it to go (since we waited an hour for it). He came back with the food prepared to go and gave us the check. I opened the containers to see the food, I touched the noodles and they were cold as if they had been sitting.  Sad thing is they weren't even busy."
North C.,"Nuevo Laredo, Mexico",5,53,158,4.0,9/2/2015,"This review is for dinner for one at the bar on a Tuesday night. service Good bartender, attentive without hovering.  Knowledgeable about drinks and menu. bar Only three beers on tap: Blue Moon, Dos Equis and Independence Brewery's Stash IPA.  The IPA was exceptional and kudos to Cheesecake Factory for having an interesting craft beer available. I watched dozens of fruity and blender drinks going out into the dining room, so Cheesecake Factory must have big business on those drinks. food I was slightly frightened to find something called the Super Antioxidant Salad on the menu. That just sounds scary.  Instead, I ordered shrimp summer rolls and chopped salad.  Shrimp summer rolls were very good.  They had asparagus in the summer rolls, which was new and interesting?  The chopped salad was exceptional.  Beautifully made and wonderfully dressed. details Plenty of parking, as the restaurant is in North Star mall.  Bar is a little too nice and clean for my tastes!"
Shannon M.,"Reno, NV",385,1,,1.0,8/5/2016,"My daughter graduated boot camp today and turned 18. We made the server aware of how special the day was today,  she totally spaced it.  When we complained to the manager,  it was all but blown off.  Way to treat our service members.  Shame on this place!!"
Mike N.,"Clarksville, TN",65,376,517,4.0,3/31/2016,The Cheesecake Factory. It's good every time. Good service and food. I enjoyed my flatbread for lunch.
Adam E.,"Greenville, TX",45,49,58,5.0,10/7/2016,"First off, service was top notch by Cameron. Drinks never went empty on his watch and I was cared for throughout my meal even though I was dining alone and the place was busy on a Friday night. The fish tacos were delicious and the mea closed to perfection with the Raspberry Truffle. Would highly recommend this location!"
Stevie K.,"East Side, San Antonio, TX",0,10,,3.0,6/20/2017,"I absolutely recommend going to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert but not so much for a whole meal. I was not at all impressed with my dinner, luckily that kept me from getting too full for dessert because the cheesecake did make it worth the trip. Considering the bill at the end of the evening., I think next time I will skip he disappointing meal and just stop in for dessert and a drink."
Lena L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,20,5.0,11/12/2015,Peach Bellini - incredibly good! Spicy Chicken Meatballs - tasty and not too spicy From the Superfoods - California Guacamole Salad - I took to it like a shark in a frenzy!  I've never eaten a salad before like it was pizza.  I was completely stuffed from mostly greenery - what a good feeling.  Did not have room for desert.  Couldn't even finish the meatballs.  Will absolutely return to try the rest of their Superfoods menu. Service - the best!  Very attentive and friendly waiter.
Tiffany B.,"Waipahu, HI",102,32,6,3.0,5/16/2017,"So my friend and I went here for dinner and we had the tacos and the pasta with chicken and bow tie noodles that was supposed to be one of the ""favorites"".  It wasn't very flavorful or impressive. The cheesecake however, was absolutely delicious! The atmosphere was pretty nice and the waitress was wonderful!"
Isai A.,"San Antonio, TX",38,14,7,3.0,10/16/2016,"I've only been to two cheesecake factories (this one and one in Austin). Wait times weren't too bad to get seated only about 20 mins. Both times the food took forever (It's understandable since they have a lot of people and not a lack of service from the waiter.), and I never get to finish it cause we get there around 9 and they close at 12 so I take it to go. I do want to say that their food is really good, it's a bit pricey but it is a big plate. I got the Parmesan grilled sandwich this time. Our waiter was a bit stressed/rushed throughout our time there and would dash off on us. Before we left it took him about 45 minutes to check us out, which he then proceeded to give us some excuse that may or may not have been true. Overall, the price is worth the food 4/5, however service 2/5 is a hit or miss and time 3/5."
JenVen T.,"Park City, UT",4,95,,5.0,9/21/2016,"Had lunch here today, only my second trip to Cheesecake Factory. We had a terrific waitress named Taylor. The food and service were excellent. My mother-in-law has mobility issues and they were very considerate of this when choosing where to place us in the restaurant. I really appreciated that little detail."
Daryll B.,"San Antonio, TX",455,480,2805,3.0,10/30/2014,"Came with a party on a birthday wish (not my wish). The place was packed on a Thursday night with middle class ladies wanting cheesecake, young people in short dresses and heels, and mall hoppers. We started with chicken potstickers and fried mashed potato tots. These appetizers were just okay and wayyy over priced for their quality. For my main course, I got the chicken katsu $14.95. The portion was huge, about 10-12 oz of panko fried Japanese chicken over brown rice with roasted veggies with a white miso sauce and a katsu glaze. My partners both got shrimp scampi with huge grilled prawns. The grilled shrimp were very good, but the portion size of the pasta was very small, especially considering these dishes cost in the $18ish range. For deserts, we got a lemon meringue cheesecake and a dulce de leche one, both were fab. The service was slow and the restrooms were filthy. Eats: - chicken potstickers - overpriced, dumpling mushy, chicken curiously loose - breaded and fried mashed potato tots - overpriced and simple - chicken katsu - excellent, huge portion, great flavor, panko breading: light and crispy Crumbs: - cheesecakes $8; sodas $3; average entree $ 17ish. - bring your gold card. - service super slow - food quality just doesn't justify these prices - men's bathroom filthy and stunk of urine   I would not come back here on my dime. The look of the uniforms and the style of the building reminded me of Copeland's of New Orleans, which is no longer here. Although these prices are high because of the location of the mall near Castle Hills, this place is packed every night by the upscale masses who may not appreciate the diversity and food quality that a Yelper seeks."
Brandi C.,"Oak Harbor, WA",63,38,9,5.0,9/2/2016,I always love the cheesecake factory. Its one of my favorite places to eat. Everywhere i go the restrarant is uniform. Great service and the food is amazing. They offer so many options. Delicious
Terrell C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/23/2016,"We just picked up family at the airport, and we decided to stop at The Cheesecake Factory because they were just about to open at 11 am.   Right away, we were seated, which was good.  After this, we figured all was good until we noticed the utensils were all absollutely disgusting!   So the waitress, apologized and returned with some clean silverware a few minutes later.  But it gets even worse, I noticed something on my daughters plate and it was uneaten chocolate cheesecake from the night before.  Upon further inspection, three out of the 6 plates all had leftover food on the plates, that had never been cleaned.    After all of this, we asked to speak to the manager, and the assistant told us he would only give us a 10% discount.  He said the head manager didn't want to talk to us...guess we weren't good enough for him!!!  So, I politely got up and found him...and I have it all recorded.  Please look for my video online today.  And DO NOT go to The Cheesecake Factory on San Pedro (North Park Mall), San Antonio Tx."
