Mitch B.,,543,303,1,3.0,1/10/2018,HUGE dining room and patio seating. Aaaand there's the plusses for CF. Downtown drink prices and the standard CF fare made this a 3 star experience. IF YOU GO- Gigantic menu. The amazing part is how they somehow make all the food taste the same. Go for the cheesecake. And get it to go.
Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",259,813,3193,2.0,1/7/2018,Being a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory this time I had the worst experience. My nephew was in town and wanted to go to the cheesecake factory. So we decided to come to the cheesecake factory. When we arrived we where told the wait will be about 20 minutes. Sure enough an hour goes by and we where finally seated. After being seated a warm bread basket arrives. As we already knew what we wanted we ordered couple minutes later. So our server took are oder.  I noticed the service was way too slow. It took almost 40 minutes for are food to come. When the food came to the table it was cold. It was the first time I ever had an experience like this at any cheesecake factory. I informed our server that the salmon was cold.  It was to the point the salmon was not even eatable. So instead my nephew had cheesecake for dinner. Our server deserves 10 stars. When you have great customer service is great. End of the day the food experience was 1 star. I will return for a second chance. Overall the location is in the heart of Downtown San Diego. For me the customer service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave was excellent. Too bad the kitchen did not do a great job.
Jon B.,"Oceanside, CA",38,10,1,2.0,1/4/2018,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory in San Diego. Service took forever. Waited 30 minutes when there were plenty of vacant tables. Once seated the table was missing settings and didnt have any table napkins. Our table was also super dark. Had to use phone light to read menu. The waiter Wesley was super friendly. We ordered a salad, a small dish, kids pizza, and 4 plates. Didnt have kids pizza and 1 of the plates was a wrong order. Our order took a while to come out.  Meatloaf and shrimp dish were salty. Salmon was bland. The chicken was the wrong order so we had to wait again. Wesley gave a free soup for the wait. In the end. Wesley removed the meatloaf from the bill and we got 2 cheese cakes that were delish. Over all pretty bad experience. 1 star for Wesley 1 star for the Cheesecake."
Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",214,194,93,1.0,12/27/2017,"Wow- this place has really gone downhill. Showed up on a weeknight of all times, to find complete and utter chaos. Total lack of management oversight, lackadaisical attitude at the front desk (""yeah, like it's over an hour wait or something...""). Trip to the bathroom revealed urine on floors, trash and toilet paper overflowing onto floor (see photo). This place  really was well run when it opened a few years ago, but now? Complete lack of leadership, and it showed glaringly when the staff was confronted with a mild crowd. Food? Cold Factory Nachos, cold Coconut Chicken, cold 4 cheese pasta. Shameful. Needs a tune up, and I will  most likely not be back to this spot; Eastlake and Mission Valley are quite good still, and I really hope they get a grip on this spot- Cmon guys, it's downtown!"
Debbie S.,"Vista, CA",423,266,2622,2.0,12/6/2017,"Stopped by last night for a late snack. Because sometimes you get the munchies and it was next door to the hotel. But ""no cheesecake for you!"" They didn't actually say that but that's how it went down.  We were seated within a few minutes but after 10 minutes still no server. It wasn't very busy. :( so we ended up buying 2 $25 gift cards for future use (gotta love their holiday special - buy a $25 gift card, get a voucher for free cheesecake) and bailed.  The gals at the cheesecake counter were attentive and very friendly. Thank you nonexistent server for preventing me from eating thousands of calories."
Court K.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,34,3.0,1/4/2018,"We wanted a place within walking distance from the Convention Center, that also served lunch specials, and this Cheesecake Factory made the cut.  It may be one of the largest locations I've ever been in; there was ample seating inside and outdoors, and STILL about 6 groups ahead of us. We were given a timer for 15 minites, but after about 5, it buzzed. I ordered ""Renee's Special,"" which included half a chicken salad sandwich, creamed chicken soup and a side salad.  The salad was tasty (nothing too special); the soup was amazing, but it was barely warm (which was weird for me, as I thought restaurant soups were made in big batches and simmered until served), so I asked our waitress if it could be heated up.  The soup was returned piping hot, and still tasty; I saved the sandwiches for home, and they were just okay.  The only other issue we experienced was the dirty table; like, REALLY dirty.  I'd return again, since the service and soup were bomb, and just ask for a cleaner table instead of ignoring the mess."
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3294,1439,1446,3.0,10/11/2017,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory in General but this location is just okay. I prefer the one at Fashion Valley over this one.  I've been here twice already, most recently two weeks ago when I was staying with my friend at the Hyatt for my birthday weekend we had dinner here one night with one of his co-workers.  I love the CF crab wontons but they don't have it at this location :( booo. I ended up ordering the carbonara along with an iced caramel macchiato. FYI don't get the macchiato iced, in fairness the waiter warned me it's supposed to be hot, but I wanted to try it iced. The caramel ended up being solid and hard. The carbonara was okay.  Our food took a long time to come out but the manager came out to apologize, nice of her. Overall, just a so-so location."
Jakiya J.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,2,5.0,12/25/2017,"Went last night and the service was great!  Issac was our waiter and was so friendly, amazing and super helpful. I ordered a full Caesar salad and quesadillas and a mojito and they were all really good :o Also I recommend the celebration cheesecake ! Also our wait was about 25-30 minutes on a busy night. Definitely worth the wait for the great service."
Catherine O.,"Palmdale, CA",75,19,1,2.0,1/2/2018,Honestly I never give less than 5 star review to any restaurant. I'm a food server myself and I always try to make my guest feel loved and appreciated and like family. However. At this location I would think that the people they hire would be kind and warming. But the waitress that we were first with was very rude. Our section was completely empty and she was very forgetful of us. so my family and I requested to speak to a m anager 10 times. And 10 mins later the manager came to our table. She was a very nice lady.  She showed us good customer service and gave us a new waitress. H.r. look up on your people!!!!!
Kevin K.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",68,11,13,4.0,12/31/2017,Menu is crazy.  Took 10 min trying to find what to order.  Finally decided on wine and beer.
Cheryl S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,603,22,4.0,12/27/2017,"I had the Skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad and it was great!  Service was a-okay!  Nothing remarkable about this location, other than the fact that it was near our hotel.  I will remember that salad when I next visit a Cheesecake Factory!"
Fatima F.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,20,,3.0,1/9/2018,"The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the cheesecake. The food is average and overpriced, expected it to taste better."
Jasmine C.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,2,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to!!  So, first I will say I am a very picky eater which is why I don't like to eat out often, and when I do eat out, I always choose the the same restaurant and opt for the same meal. Boring I know, but It usually saves my tummy some disappointment; however, that was not the case this time.  I ordered the lunch size Pasta Di Vinci as usual because that's always my go to item on the menu and my favorite pasta! When it came out I was pretty disappointed because there were three tiny pieces of chicken on my entire plate! Three! Again, I don't eat out often, and I especially don't eat pasta often, but today I told myself I would, so when there was three damn pieces of chicken. I was pretty annoyed. I don't like to complain so I didn't say anything. I thought to myself, well, I did order the lunch special.. maybe that is why. So I ordered another one to go. Well, when I got home to open it, there was literally no sauce on there at all!!!!! I would have brought it back if it wasn't a 30 min drive!  On top of that, the waitress was really rude. My Husband still had food on his plate and a full beer when our waitress brought the bill which was pretty rude. She even had the nerve to come back and say ""I'm going to be leaving soon."" because we hadn't paid yet. Did it ever occur to her that we hadn't paid because we weren't done. She could've introduced us to the next waiter who would be taking over her section. That would be the professional thing to do   Overall, this place is garbage and I'm pretty disappointed because this has always been one of my favorite places to eat! Worst $90 I ever spent! Don't waste your time or money here. I wished I would've looked at the Yelp reviews before coming here.  I hope the management team does something about their terrible reviews!  Btw. The mashed potatoes here are garbage as well! Seems like they recycle them all week and just add milk to them each day to smooth them out. Your'e better off making them out of the box."
Marie D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/27/2017,We had a great experience. Was a little worried from reading some of these posts but I'm pleased to report that we were pretty much happy with everything.  Wait time 20 minutes during a busy holiday season Table was clean when seated Waiter was kind and attentive  Meals came out in 10 mins from ordering Food was great!
Amanda R.,"El Cajon, CA",62,16,5,1.0,12/18/2017,I came in here and order their Louisiana Chicken easy spice. I order this every time I go to the Fashion Valley location and have no issues. This location brought my order out and it was heavy spice. It was so spicy that I couldn't breathe after i took a bite. They came over and took the food back and fixed the order. The manager came over to say how sorry he was.  That still didn't take away from the burning sensation in my mouth. They didn't even bother taking it off my bill either. I will never be returning to this location again
Mansour S.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",119,220,1008,4.0,8/7/2017,"1st time in this location , i really loved it the place was busy and nice , you get to feel the busy and beautiful San diego here , i ordered chicken marsala & mushrooms! It wasnt anything special it lacked wine sauce as it was little so i had to ask my host to bring more & after she brought it the whole plate was great but not 5 star great more like 3 star , dynamite shrimp this time wasnt as good as i had order it before in different location , my favorite cheese cake is white chocolate macadamia cake its my always best option and it worth 5 stars, Service definitly worth 5 stars which made my rating to be 4 stars , i had other plates and for me burgers is what they only do good beside cake!  Again service was beyond expectation and the girls showed real hospitality"
Advocate M.,"San Diego, CA",25,25,24,1.0,12/22/2017,"Food was okay, fries too salty, and loud guests. I sit in the patio to make sure it's not too loud; but, these guests are super loud and acting like fools."
Emily P.,"Lafayette, CO",92,106,323,3.0,6/23/2017,"Okay - this is going to sound odd - the lighting in here hurts my eyes. I know I'm supposed to be reviewing food and service and ambiance.  I'm sitting here feeling like I've got cataracts - who says THAT on YELP?  But the lighting goes beyond ""mood lighting"". Onto the food etc etc.  we ordered a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Pretty good. Mango avocado salad - extremely light on the avocado.  Service was friendly. Prompt. That's all folks!!!"
Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1362,5.0,4/4/2017,"Personally, The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants because they have amazing food, reasonable prices, great customer service, and the perfect ambiance. Happy hour, casual lunch or dinner, a birthday, whatever occasion it is--this restaurant is perfect! (Unless it's an extremely special occasion, of course, I go somewhere ""expensive."")  I've always wanted to go to this location because I like the area, so while at my stay at Embassy Suites, my boyfriend and I decided to go here for a few appetizers a few hours before our dinner reservations. We were confused because we went through the wrong entrance, so when we reached the table where the hosts were, we realized how long the line/busy the restaurant was. Luckily, we were able to grab a high top table within minutes because we just wanted to do appetizers, like I said. The sliders were good, but this segment is dedicated to the avocado egg rolls. THEY ARE THE REASON FOR MY EXISTENCE. I love avocado, but in egg roll form? The best. The sauce that they paired it with made it even better. I was honestly shocked at how good they were.  Our waitress was really sweet! She managed to check up on us often, and was not very overwhelming. The only issue I had was that there was a table with a drunk girl (I'm assuming because her head was on the table), and a worker stood guard at the bathroom door because she was in there. Also, a police officer had to escort another drunk gentleman out. So, the crowd can get a bit too rowdy at this specific location."
Beetle B.,"Granville Island/False Creek, Vancouver, Canada",47,20,21,4.0,11/11/2017,"The food is really good. We ordered the ahi tuna, Diane steak and salmon factory combo. They taste really good. There was 20 mins wait time but just use the time to check out the toy store next door. The seat beacon will still work."
Tara R.,"San Diego, CA",11,95,43,3.0,10/27/2017,I love love this location. I order to go here often but from time to time the service isn't the greatest and my order is wrong when I get home. I typically get the angel hair shrimp scampi but recently it didn't come with angel hair but regular spaghetti noodles. It may not seem like a big deal but I'd would really like to get what I ordered. I do believe the type of noodles make a big difference with certain dishes. They have a new hazelnut cheesecake that isn't the greatest. Other than To go orders this place is not that bad. You have to pay for parking if you park in the lot.
Lewil A.,"Sparks, NV",161,2,,1.0,10/22/2017,"Entered and asked if the bar was open seating.  Yes she said.  saw a high top but it' was dirty,  so we waited probably less than 5 minutes but close, for someone to clear it.  No luck.  Sat at one of the regular h eight tables in the bar..... And waited.........and waited....... And waited.  Left.  No one noticed or cared.   cheesecake factory had good service once upon a time.  What happened"
Kerry V.,"City Heights, San Diego, CA",336,49,91,2.0,10/1/2017,"My boyfriend ordered me a honey truffle chicken for take out and we just received the chicken... I really wanted to try it for the honey truffle part but I just received plain fried chicken. Food tastes ok overall, but I'm disappointed in their lack of attention to the simplest details. We could've spent $17 + tip at KFC and gotten more for it if we had known we'd be getting plain fried chicken."
Kate C.,"Vancouver, Canada",44,72,207,3.0,1/7/2017,Dropped by for lunch while in the area.  Had the Mango key lime cheesecake & a cup of coffee. It was mediocre. I'd stick with their classic cheesecake options. My choice lacked key lime flavor and the mango flavor was too sweet. There wasn't a balance between tart/sweet.
Robert D.,"Irvine, CA",0,52,88,5.0,7/29/2017,"Love Cheesecake Factory. The only negative, too many choices. The food was great and the service excellent. The price is on the high side but you do get a good amount of food. We did not have the cheesecake on this visit but having it before I. An say they have flavored never though of before; all good.  I recommend especially the one in San Diego at the Seaport Village."
Irene P.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/25/2017,"Worst restaurant experience ever, customer service was horrible and management is no better. My husband and I had to make jokes about how terrible the service was, just so we didn't get mad. This place has gone from great to mediocre in just a few years. Being from san diego and living walking distance from the Cheesecake Factory, I can honestly say I would rather pay a bit more and go to McCormick and Shmicks, customer service is above and beyond and the food is great."
Lindsay C.,"Santee, CA",135,21,35,1.0,9/17/2017,"Had an absolute horrible experience at dinner on Friday and now it's creating an even more terrible experience days after.  (Major ordering and delivery details removed to shorten review - will discuss with corporate regarding order delivery a spouse didn't receive food until 30+ minutes after we received ours) A woman named Lizette (who is now harassing and having her friends harass the customer - see attached photo) came by and put the plate of food down in front of my spouse. She then asked if everything was okay and my spouse promptly said no. She asked why and my spouse stated the party was half way done with their meal and he had just barely gotten his. Lizette then laughed at my spouse and with a passive aggressive tone her attitude changed and she asked if we wanted to speak to a manager. I stated no that we would just like to eat. When she began to redundantly repeat herself ""are you sure?"" Each time getting more and more sarcastic, turning her face and directly staring at me, ultimately tearing me like a child. Call it what you will, but I'm not oblivious or ignorant to aggressive demeanors. I sternly said no one final time and she stood there for roughly 3-5 seconds and just stared and me then walked away. It was enough for the other members of the group to be alarmed and mention something. Once she walked away, I then felt compelled to speak to someone about her attitude as I felt if I would have addressed her any further - confrontation would have occurred.  (My review was too long so I'll spare the dinner details for corporate( No one was pleased so we opted to get the manager. This is when the above agreements and information was relayed.  I personally brought up the issue regarding the food runner who had talked to us so rudely, the manager said she had left. When she was literally feet behind him running food. When we asked how we could complain about our service and this woman specifically - the manager told us we would need to contact corporate and complain against our server. Despite my complaint being against Lizette the food runner.  I took upon myself, since your management seems to be okay with this type of behavior, I took it upon myself to find Lizette and let her know she cost the table and server tip with her attitude. And immediately I was met with the same passive aggressiveness and a walk away.  Lizette, sweetheart.... we're taking this to corporate now that your friends are harassing honest reviewers AND paying customers. I told you passive aggressiveness gets you no where. Well neither does harassing. As for the manager, you stated it was your first day on the job. Advice - you have angry or upset customers... get them quickly out of your establishment in a respectful manner. You made us sit there for 38 additional minutes. We spent nearly 3 hours total at your establishment for a 1 hour dinner. Tops. You need more training apparently.  Calling corporate tomorrow morning - kept my receipt. Table 101 Server Edgar Q. (0551g) (Edit - still being harassed by the employee's friends)"
Thuong T.,"San Diego, CA",1536,1224,3075,5.0,11/10/2016,"CHEESCAKE!!!! Just stopped by here for some dessert after eating at another place next door. They have a good variety of cheesecakes to choose from that is ready to go. I chose the Snickers Bar Crunch Cheesecake and my friend got the original Cheesecake with Strawberries. I like that they add whipped cream on top of the cheesecake, as well as more whipped cream on the side for you in the take out box with the cakes. The Snickers cheesecake had a lot going on, but was thick, creamy, with a slight crunch of chocolate and caramel. It was delicious. And you can NEVER go wrong with the original cheesecake either. Love this place."
angela l.,"San Diego, CA",0,296,1952,3.0,7/5/2017,"Came with a group of friends to this downtown restaurant on 4th of July to watch 9pm fireworks display in the harbor. Bad idea on a day like this, especially for a group of 11 because no reservation allowed. The wait time was ridiculously long! I had my favorite Cajun jambalaya in the past( have not been to a Cheesecake Factory for many, many years!!) and was totally disappointed! Both the medium sized shrimps(5 in total) and the cubes of chicken were over cooked. Don't think I'd come back again even though the server was pleasant."
Christy W.,"Los Alamitos, CA",57,2,,2.0,9/24/2017,"I would have given the food a higher rating if they had gotten our order correct!  We visited Saturday night around 630 and sat on the patio.  Two people in our party ordered the vegetable salad with beets and they didn't get the order correct and also brought one salad with chicken that we didn't order.  To say the least, several things were wrong with both salads.  The runner was SO RUDE insisting we ordered one with chicken and wanted to argue rather than correct our order.  We love cheesecake and frequent other locations often and never have had such horrible service.   In reading the reviews before mine, it looks like you have issues with customer service.  Bad service leaves a bad taste in ones mouth and ruins one whole meal!  Would not recommend your location to friends!"
Danielle R.,"San Diego, CA",880,736,702,4.0,4/5/2017,"Adam and I came here on a busy Saturday evening and left very happy with our experience.   We were told we would have about a 20 minute wait to get a table and that is just about how long it took for us to be seated. We stated we would sit in whatever was available first, inside or outside, and we were very happy to have been seated inside as it was chilly out.   During the time we waited we took the opportunity to browse the menu but we already knew what we wanted. The Cheesecake factory has a very large menu so if you don't know what you want ahead of time I highly suggest doing this so you can keep things moving along.   When our waitress came to take our drink order we also ordered our food. We ate our delicious bread and butter and our meals came shortly after. Everything tasted amazing and the portions were super large, as usual.   Our waitress was great all throughout. She was helpful in making sure we had everything we needed but didn't overcrowd us. She was great.   In the end we were in and out in less than an hour and we left beyond happy. We will be back."
Michelle V.,"Hamilton, OH",10,135,77,5.0,10/3/2017,"Very consistent with other chains. I ordered my usual, the veggie burger made protein style with no cheese.. I placed order to go, the food was prepared in the time they promised. The location was perfect and is a great location for anyone staying close to district. Will choose again in future. No complaints!"
Jenna H.,"Chula Vista, CA",818,295,1232,5.0,8/22/2017,"Prob the best Cheesecake Factory in San Diego. Service was spectacular! Even though it was a big party of 7, our waitress Tina (Christina?) was very attentive, sweet and fast paced. And our food was very delicious.  I ordered shrimp scampi with steak diane. My steak was over cooked and slightly burnt. But, they fixed it :) it was really good."
Shena R.,"Imperial Beach, CA",177,146,242,3.0,6/18/2017,"My sever was very polite. I really only came here for a drink and dessert but decided to order the fried macaroni and cheese balls. Honestly, the food at the Mission Valley location is much better than this location and you have to pay for parking here : / but my Oreo cheese cake was still delicious."
Karina C.,"San Diego, CA",61,35,62,4.0,4/14/2017,Husband and I went in for a casual lunch since Flour & Barley unexpectedly closed on us. Let me just start with their front desk/hostess area needs some serious training. They are sooo unorganized and one can get quickly frustrated with their lack of organization. We quickly seen 2 other parties who arrived after us be seated first. Hence it was just two of us. But we survived and were seated. We had the bacon truffle grilled cheese sticks OMMMMMGGGG! SOOO DANG GOOD! wouldn't mind coming back for those and a yummy drink. He ordered the pasta and I had the pizza and salad. His pasta had pepperoni and sausage over cream of pasta. Oh my god! Full of flavor and delicious. The small pizza and salad were your traditional flavors and nothing too fancy. Another annoying thing was that their silverware is soo poorly handled. I don't think they have lemishine for their dishwasher :/ The view from the patio is amazing! You really soak in downtown!
Jamesha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,5,1.0,11/19/2017,"Taking a trip to San Diego and stopped at the Cheesecake Factory in downtown San Diego. We had to wait maybe 5 mins for a table and once seated the server seemed to be in a rush . She literally stood at the table while we overlooked the menu, while we looked over the menu we asked for water, she brought it and continue to stand and hover over us which made us uncomfortable as if she was rushing us . And we never received our complimentary bread that the Cheesecake Factory is known for. Next time visiting San Diego we will not be going to the Cheesecake Factory .. we will keep it local ."
Alice L.,"Toronto, Canada",400,343,984,4.0,8/31/2016,"Not sure why the negative reviews, but I had a great experience here, especially compared to my past exp in NYC. Food was good, my tuna was not super fresh in my opinion, could have been better. But the rest of us all loved the food. We also ordered the red velvet cheesecake (upon our server's suggestion), and it was mindblowing. Loved every last bite of that thing. The biggest issue we had was with the table behind us. They had a party of 4 with a child with them (between the age of 4-6 ish?). The kid was VERY loud (reasonable), but the (assumed) mother did nothing about it, and tried to talk over the kid... in our area, there was my family (we speak pretty quietly), and two women in their 80s. The other side of the restaurant was half empty and much louder. They could work on their organization. Other than that, this location deserves a 5 star."
Madelynn F.,"Tucson, AZ",44,71,16,4.0,8/13/2017,Only decent place in the area open past 9 on a weekday when we visited. Closed at 11pm. Sat at the because their was a 20 min wait for a table. Drinks were good and so was the food. And of course the cheese cake was amazing!
JC C.,"Springfield, OR",2,23,96,1.0,6/29/2017,This place sucks!!! My friend and I walked in on a Thursday night to get two pieces of pie to go and they took more a 1/2 HOUR to get them!!!  Ridiculous! I would never go there again!!!  We place order and paid thinking we soon leave but we watched others get their stuff before us!!!  We stepped up and asked for the manager and it comes out that she was the one who made the major screw up!!  The service was horrible and the person behind the counter didn't care and didn't apologize! As a matter of fact she smiled and said my manager is right here and knows we screwed you!!!! Sad!
Dee P.,"San Diego, CA",35,86,221,5.0,8/22/2017,"Food - 5 stars! Customer service, another 5! I've been on this location a few times. It's quite unbelievable that this location is the total opposite of the Fashion Valley location when it comes to customer service. Maybe because it's a tourist spot? Or are they just plainly trained better? Hopefully they keep up the good work. I think our waitress was Shannon or Alisson? (Oops) She did a great job! On top of everything.  Will definitely come back! High five!"
