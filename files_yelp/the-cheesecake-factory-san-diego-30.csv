Justin K.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Don't waste your time here. The only good thing about this place is leaving when you're done. I've been a huge cheesecake factory lover all my life. I've visited the Fashion Valley, Chula Vista and various- out of San Diego- locations on multiple occasions: to each I have zero complaints about. However, my visit to the Downtown/Seaport Village location was probably the worst experience I've ever had while dinning out, ever. Seriously.. Ever. I'd have gotten better service from a local Wendy's.. Probably better food too. To start, when we were seated, our ""Silverware"" wrapped in napkins only had butter knives. No seriously, just butter knives. Zero problem for smothering butter on our bread or opening junk mail, but that's about it.  When we placed our drink orders, it took almost 20 minutes for our drinks to come out. Now, granted, of the 6 people seated at the table; 3 of us ordered Martinis. I expected those to take a moment. No complaints there. But over 20 minutes for Tea? Seriously? Oh and we had a toddler with us that we ordered Apple Juice for. That took over an hour for them to bring it to us. Were they out pulling apples off the tree to freshly squeeze them or something? Hell, George Washington could of cut down his fathers favorite Cherry Tree and Squeezed us some fresh Cherry juice faster than they brought us a half cup of Apple Juice. Now, on to the food. Both my brother and I ordered our steaks, Rare and Medium Rare. You know what that means? It means you really don't have to cook them that long.. at all. What did we get? 3 little bite sized pieces of Well-Done Recycled Tire Rubber, each. I don't know about you guys, but unless I'm ripping and tearing up the streets in my non-existent Sports car, I'm not really a fan of Burnt Rubber. Save that crap for the Tracks, not for the Plates. So, I kindly requested to speak to a manager. 15 minutes later, the manager ""Ramiro"" shows up. He was actually kind enough to fix the mistake that the Chefs made. ""Awesome!"" we thought. Hopefully there's no Spit/Saliva on these steaks-- but hell, at this point we were so hungry from the long ass wait that we didn't care. We ate the steaks with no problem. As we were eating our steaks, our waitress comes up to us and states, ""My manager said that if you guys order dessert, he'll take it off the bill.""Ok! cool! That's even more so awesome!! but hey, we still don't have the Apple-Juice for the toddler!"" So, we do what people do when they are at the ""CHEESECAKE FACTORY"". We ordered CHEESECAKE!! We do what we normally do, we eachl ordered a slice for ourselves. Everyone orders a different flavor Cheesecake and we all share bites with each other. That's just what family does, am I wrong? The cheesecakes were great! They really were!! They always are! I mean, we had to ask for SPOONS because they failed, at the start, to even give us silverware, but when those spoons FINALLY came out: we grubbed those cheesecakes like no other! Damned Good! But then comes the bill. Now let it be known-- Tonight was, ""Half off the price of any cheesecake"" night. What did the manager do? He removed the price of ONE cheesecake,. Looking at the bill, the cheesecakes came down to $4/5something a pop. Down from the normally $8-10 a slice. But... As I recall... Our waitress specifically said that dessert was on the manager.. But he only removed a single $5 slice of cheesecake? Wait.. Are you serious??? After all the things I brought to his attention, he gave me a $5 discount? Really? This was the straw that broke the camels back. What a complete insult to my family and myself. We brought our 85 year old Grandmother out, with what little energy she had, to enjoy a wonderful dinner with us after we hyped the place up to her, and this is how they treat us? That's just down right insulting. Ramiro, if you're reading this. As I told you when I handed you the bill: You're a Piece of Sh*t. I'm going to contact Corporate HQ tomorrow morning and tell them how crappy of a person you are. I hope they fire your ass and replace you with someone who actually cares for customers. I've never met such a cocky and pompous manager in my life. If you want to act like that, go be a manager for Walmart. You'd fit right in."
Christa M.,"El Paso, TX",46,379,672,2.0,4/25/2015,Service could have been BETTER since it is The Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress never refilled my drink even though I asked her for a refill. Never asked us if we needed anything and she never came around. Two other employees brought us our food over cause who knows where our waitress was at.  I definitely get better service in Arizona at The Cheesecake Factory.
Yesenia F.,"San Diego, CA",16,51,17,2.0,8/31/2016,"I've been to other cheesecake factories before but this probably has the worst table service, it took very long till we got our drinks and our server seemed annoyed. Although the food was very delicious but our $8 cheesecake slice was very small."
Eun L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,1.0,11/23/2016,Worst Cheese Cake Factory ever since I have visited other locations many times.  Garlic Noodles was not as good as other locations.  Cajun Jambalaya was so watery. Shrimp with Angel Hair was over cooked. I will never visit here again. I do not think this location follows recipe properly.
ada s.,"San Diego, CA",8,10,,2.0,11/20/2016,"The food was ok but it was too dark.  I couldn't even read the menu and had to use my phone  for extra light.  I asked the waitress about extra light but she said that is for the ""ambiance"".  Ambiance??  I get it, but you should still be able to read your menu. Parking is too pricey.  Better to go to a different location."
Frederick H.,"Encinitas, CA",10,57,23,5.0,4/22/2016,This place has it all. Fantastic waitstaff. The food was perfect. Especially the mint tea. Brand-new fresh patio with a great view of San Diego down by Seaport Village. I'll be coming back.
Jim E.,"Oakland, CA",42,207,102,4.0,2/1/2016,Great service and this meat loaf is off the hook yo over eating once again!  Great cheesecake as well!!
Russell L.,"San Diego, CA",177,14,34,4.0,4/10/2016,"I have very mixed reviews about this restaurant. On one hand, the food was very good. But on the other hand, I felt that the service was somewhat lacking. I do not mean the customer service and the attitude of the waiters, because the waiters were nice. It was just that the wait was somewhat long and when we were wondering why, we noticed the waiters taking selfies in the back. Despite this, the food I ordered was very delicious. I ordered the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was cooked very well, it was juicy and delicious, as opposed to the dry overcooked chicken that I'm used to eating at home. My girlfriend's shrimp, on the other hand, was incredibly overcooked. It was tougher than she wanted. When I tried it, I said that it tasted like chicken. In conclusion, my review on the chicken Madeira had the biggest influence on my overall experience."
Louis L.,"El Cajon, CA",29,35,5,2.0,10/17/2016,The server was nice. Our seating was not. We were very cold and we asked the server to reseat us and they wouldn't. We informed them and told them we were cold and needed to be reseated and they said we can't. We looked over and saw 3 or 4 booths open. I told them that my girl was cold and needed to go by the heat and they didn't. So I took my girl paid my bill and left all the food on the table and left.
Liz D.,"Vail, AZ",35,71,28,5.0,3/20/2016,"It's cheesecake factory: they do everything well. I love the variety, it makes it so easy for my picky kids with different tastes. What sets this location apart is the fantastic service. The wait was short for a party of six on a Saturday during spring break. The patio seating was chilly,  but the heaters fixed that quickly. Our server was phenomenal, very friendly, fast and helpful. The only hiccup was that they were out of kids' pizzas, but our kiddos had no problem switching to the mini burgers,  which they raved about. The fish and chips were light and crispy,  not greasy and heavy. Great coleslaw,  too. The Chicken Madeira was delicious, and my teenager raved about the Bacon Bacon Burger."
Sparky F.,"Sacramento, CA",10,99,717,2.0,3/24/2016,"Enjoyed dinners of perfectly cooked Salmon and  Tuna, --I would not have guessed to come to the Cheesecake Factory for fish! Enjoyed patio dining with our dog, good service, happy campers! Two nights later we returned for round two and were told no pet dogs on the patio! SERIOUSLY? y'all need to figure out your policy and stick to it!"
Amanda N.,"San Diego, CA",570,241,68,5.0,5/9/2015,"Cheesecake Factory was love at first bite many years ago and still hasn't changed. Last night I found the most amazing combo, it's like heaven in your mouth. Pair a Godiva chocolate cheesecake with a raspberry martini and you will not be sorry! I love this location, right by seaport village! Parking can be a nuisance but I've never had too many issues."
Pete B.,"San Marcos, CA",5,41,48,4.0,10/3/2016,"Great service at the cheesecake factory tonight!  Food was great as well.  Buffalo blasters were a good start, followed by the chicken Madeira / steak Diane combo.  As usual, too much food but everything was delicious.  Rounded out with the chocolate mousse cheesecake and all is well.  I usually go for the Godiva but wanted to try something a little different.  Either is a great choice!"
Paulsegal ..,"San Diego, CA",558,523,389,4.0,3/17/2016,"its everything you'd expect from a typical Cheesecake factory. There was a wait, even though the restaurant was half empty. the food was very descent and there was lunch specials for the budget minded. service was very good. TIP: We said forget eh wait, we went for the HIGH chairs in the bar area that were empty but you could go and sit there  and be served the full menu"
Angelica C.,"San Diego, CA",118,4,6,3.0,6/17/2015,"First off. That menu of their's is GINORMOUS. It would of taken me like 20 min if I actually read everything. Anywayssss I ended up ordering the herb crusted salmon salad, which was pretty good, nice and light. Not worth $15 in my opinion but I'm just a cheapass. Umm Customer service was just fine.  Overall it was just more average than I expected. :(  come here for cheesecake though that's for sure :)"
Danielle A.,"Lancaster, CA",51,18,1,5.0,5/19/2017,"First time eating at a cheesecake factory.  Food was awesome, service was awesome,  & the cheesecake was to die for! Our server kept the drinks full &  recommended good choices."
Alaina K.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/18/2015,"We waited a hour on a thursday night for a table. Then we were sat down to a dirty table, dirty to the point that there was food still on it.  Waitress comes over 15 minutes later. We tell her, it's another 10 minutes to get it cleaned. Here we are 25 minutes in and just now got a clean table. Another 15 minutes to get drinks ordered. Drinks were okay, but wasn't worth the wait. We finally got to order food about an hour into sitting at the table. An hour? To ORDER food? A little ridiculous but it was my SIL'S birthday and that's what she requested.  The rest of the dinner was terrible. 2 out of the 5 of us, didn't get what we ordered, and the guy that was adding cheese completely skipped over one of my party even though she looked him in the eye and politely asked for some.  Me and my husband LIVE  here in San Diego, I'm not sure of they gave us bad service because they thought we were tourists, but ""The Cheesecake Factory"" has completely lost our business. Completely dissatisfied in the service and the food here at this San Diego location!"
Anibal O.,"De Bary, FL",11,83,38,1.0,9/14/2016,"I have been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories this is by far the worst experience ever... Food took for ever to come out... I almost choked cause they took my drink for a refill and took 10 mins to get back and the only reason I got my drink back was because I had to aggressively flag down my waitress... The entree was under cooked overly salty with water in the bottom of the dish the chicken on top was good... What pissed my off is that my waiter seemed to be interested in other larger tables... In my life have I never ever left a place without tipping.. This was my first.. I still feel a bit guilty but after what I went through, it doesn't feel that bad.. Oh I went for cheese cake.... Lol never got it my anger overwhelmed me and since I want asked I forgot about it..  Didn't see a manger and didn't bother to ask."
Christine K.,"San Diego, CA",53,6,,5.0,11/10/2016,Used Door Dash. Excellent in every way. We like the people and the food. The Uber driver was nice. Recommend highly. Decent pricing.
Serena S.,"San Diego, CA",5,20,71,5.0,1/12/2016,"My husband and I absolutely love this place. We live downtown and are very well acquainted with the area restaraunts, but this one is one of our favorites for date night, or really, any night! We usually get a booth, but have lately been enjoying the bar and watching the games while we eat and have a couple of drinks. This place is A+! Many different options on the menu, great drinks, amazing customer service, and a prime location. What else can I say, we love it here. Would definitely recommend to all. Come and enjoy."
