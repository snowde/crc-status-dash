Jasmine B.,"San Diego, CA",8,16,6,5.0,5/16/2016,"On this past Thursday night, me & my fiancé decided to come here for dinner. Let me tell you, we were impressed.  We chose to sit outside, didn't wait long at all for our server. I wish I would have remembered his name. He was very sweet with helping us choose our appetizers & entrees. Since I'm a very picky person, it was nice to have someone go over a handful of items with me to help me decide.  We loved the vibe this past Thursday so much that we will be coming back for future date nights. Also thank you to the super tall blonde Machine gun kelly look alike guy who served us !! (:"
Alan R.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",9,23,1,2.0,7/29/2017,"Meh. Server spilled drinks on us. Several orders came out incorrect. Appetizers came with the meal, not first. Plenty of better places to spend your money on in 92101."
Pauline S.,"San Diego, CA",31,47,13,1.0,4/19/2017,"THE WAIT AND THE STAFF= TERRIBLE We decided to have a birthday dinner here for one of my closest friends. Something intimate and sweet.  We put in our request for a table for 7 inside or outside. When the buzzer finally buzzed (not a long wait) we went to the hostess stand to wait another 15 minutes to even be acknowledged. When we turned in the buzzer we were told ""you're next""...then so was the next group..and the next..and the next... I said to the hostess ""when you are telling these customers they are next they are going to think you will be calling their party next, instead of us all getting frustrated at you.. you should say you'll be with us in just a few minutes"" as there was much confusion to many groups being told they are next.  She was the rudest hostess stating that ""just because you are hungry don't take it out on me"" she was very lucky I was NOT actually hungry and that it was my friends birthday and I didn't want to start a bigger issue. Especially when someone who has been there and done that is trying to give you constructive criticism rather than yelling at you and making you look like a fool. They couldn't even get our number of people correct. Our waiter was very nice and very personable but it took about 20 minutes for us to be addressed at the table another 20+ to get our waters 1hr to get our food...20+ for dessert and 15 for the check...we had two kids there as well. It was honestly the worst experience ever. We regretted driving down to the harbor to go to the Cheesecake Factory when we could've went to the fashion valley one. If the hostess at the beginning wasn't so damn rude and the wait wasn't that terrible we may have enjoyed it..but to be there for 3hrs is ridiculous for dinner ESPECIALLY having kids."
Cameron H.,"San Diego, CA",2,24,1,1.0,7/4/2017,Been waiting for 25 min to get our table cleaned. Unbelievable. I understand it's 4th of July but your acting like your not even a restaurant....tell us it's dirty and you can't clean it or something. Terrible service. Empty tables everywhere. Get it together
Carolyn B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,16,1.0,9/16/2017,Upset with the cook here pops order was to salty and why did the cook leave this big ass Bay Leaf in the Baked Potato Soup
Raquel R.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/15/2017,They were out of everything we wanted. Drinks took forever. Ahí tartare was good. Forgot the dressing on the side for our salad. Avocado spring rolls were good. Servers were super loud behind the scenes.
Ana M.,"Montara, CA",19,26,12,3.0,7/15/2017,"Typical chain restaurant, nothing too special. The wait to get seated was 20 minutes on a Friday night @ almost 10 pm. The time it took to get our food, even longer.  I do love the fact that they added some healthier choices. Maybe they've had it for while. Idk. It's been a long time. Loved their Mexican lettuce tacos (220 calories, yay!). I'm not a health nut and definitely doesn't count calories everyday but after a day of pigging out, you just know you need to slow down. Lol. Overall not a bad experience."
Regina J.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,7,2.0,2/9/2017,"We recently ordered from the Cheesecake Factory through a delivery service and unfortunately one of the meals didn't live up to the usual CF greatness.  I love the CF so it was very disappointing.  I ordered the tomato basil pasta meal that comes with grilled chicken but there was barely ANY chicken, just two small pieces (see picture).  I also requested to add broccoli and they only added two pieces, so basically it was $16 for pasta.   On the other side, the chicken madeira entrees we ordered were delicious, as always!  Easily our favorite meal from The Cheesecake Factory.   I hope this was just an off night for them because we want to keep ordering from there but chicken entrees really should have chicken in them.  :)"
Yumi K.,"Santa Monica, CA",368,202,314,4.0,8/11/2015,"This place is hyped up! Came here on a Friday night with my friend because we were very excited to try this place out. It was pretty crowded that night, but our wait was no more than 30 minutes for two.  We both ordered Eggplant Parmesan because we don't eat meat. I would say it is fairly priced at around $13/14 considering it is Cheesecake Factory. But it wasn't breathtaking. I've had better eggplant parm from Olive Garden which is priced at around the same amount, yet has more to offer. Still, I would have to say it is certainly the best vegetarian option here.  For dessert, we knew we had to try some cheesecake so we went with White Chocolate Macadamia nut. It was excessively sweet, but superb. Probably won't be back for food, but will be back to try the other cheesecakes!"
James M.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,7,10,1.0,5/18/2017,"Staying at Embassy Suites across the street.  Ordered $60 worth of takeout for my fam, including Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya on rice.   After walking back to my room, I discovered their so-called ""jambalaya"" didn't hardly have any sauce.  My rice shoulda been swimming in sauce, but it was just chicken, shrimp, & veggies cooked in sauce, then laid on top of rice without sauce.   Also, they didn't include any napkins, even tough I specifically asked.  Annoying b/c I gave her a tip even though it was takeout.  So I walked back there. They gave me some BS that their jambalaya isn't saucy.  My thought: then don't call it jambalaya.  They were nice enough to make some sauce, although I waited about another 15 min.  More drama than I wanted before eating my dinner.  Jambalaya was really good though.  Meatloaf too."
Michael P.,"Yuma, AZ",42,23,3,5.0,2/17/2017,"I had the Baja Chicken Tacos, recommended by my Waitress, and they were AWESOME.  My wife's food was to salty and they removed her meal from the bill.  What I liked best about this place was the Staff.  It seems like they all work together as a team.  We were asked if we needed anything about every 10 minutes and by 4 different people.  Also, my kids destroyed their meals as well.  Thank you everybody and thanks for those tacos!!!  I'm still full."
Alberto H.,"National City, CA",36,1,,5.0,8/11/2017,"Awesome on EVERY level, and Superb on any type of taste pallet.. My waitress (Shannon Vinson) in particular was OUTSTANDING and her GREAT service was definitely worth a return. Not to mention she was drop dead GORGEOUS."
Leslie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,1,,4.0,12/20/2017,"I am a frequent customer of the Cheesecake Factory and when I travel if one is nearby I will order my usual Santa Fe Chicken Salad. While in San Diego (near the Harbor across from the Hyatt), I called to order the lunch size salad (due restrictions) during the dinner hours. At first I was transferred from the front desk to the take out desk, then put on hold for a manger for over 6 minutes. After explaining to the manager my restrictions he honored my request. Everything is good....I received my order walked back to my room to open my salad to find out there was no chicken. Who fixes a Santa Fe Chicken Salad with no chicken. At first I was going to let it go, but I couldn't. I called back to the restaurant and talked to the manager. He was very apologetic and offered to make me another salad; I declined because I was too tired to walk back and get the replacement salad. The next day I realized my flight left later in the afternoon so I called back to the restaurant and talk to the manager on duty explained what happened the night before and asked could I pick up a replacement salad for lunch, the manager again was apologetic for what had happened the night before and honored my request. When I got to the restaurant my salad was waiting, the cashier verified with me that there was chicken on my salad and sent me on my merry way. Thank you to both managers ( I didn't get their names) for being accommodating. I guess the only thing that would have made this a five star review if they would have thrown in a piece of cheesecake. All in all I was a satisfied customer and my salad was delicious!"
Gris E.,"Tucson, AZ",16,12,,4.0,7/22/2017,"Fetuccini pasta was really good, wings were crispy, tender and spicy, they were delicious, ahi tuna was a bomb, Asian tacos were just ok,  rib eye steak was perfectly cooked, chicken sandwich was good as well... we would come back definitely."
Steven B.,"Sandy, UT",66,13,11,4.0,3/3/2017,"Jeremy le, our bartender, was the best thing ever. They were out of a couple things and he was so honest about it. My long Island was amazing"
Jessica B.,"San Diego, CA",36,32,121,2.0,4/3/2016,"Dined here lastnight and I was really surprised at the service at this location. I have dined at other Cheesecake Factory locations and never really had a problem. Saturday nights are busy. I get it. But our waitress rarely checked on us and I had to flag her down when we needed things. Twice for refilling our water glasses!  Our ceasar salad was a huge disappointment. It was a watery, wilted mess. It didn't even taste like ceasar salad. There was not one hint of parmesan on it. My daughter got 1 crouton in her salad. I got about 8. But gave her mine. I asked one of the servers (who came by to pick up dishes) if what we ordered was ceasar salad and she said, ""That's how it is.""  My nephew didn't have dinner, he came along just for the dessert. When we placed our order, I told the waitress to bring out his dessert when our food came out. Sure enough, he didn't get his dessert until we flagged the waitress down yet again. She did say she would bring the cake in 2 minutes but at that time we were already almost done with our dinner.  Seriously disappointed from that experience. I was going to give only 1 star but I am giving 2 because the hostess up front was nice and our food (other than the salad) tasted okay."
Tony S.,"Santee, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/26/2016,"I have to pay to park to eat here, the lighting was too dark to see my food, the bathroom smelt like hobos had an orgy using mayo as butt lube, and there's a ton of douchers in khaki shorts and Polo shirts. Also pricing sucked for food quality.  If you wear Polo shirts with khaki shorts and your wife eats zanacks all day while you go golfing then this is the place to go."
Lindsay B.,"Cypress, CA",6,19,20,1.0,6/25/2017,"Got food to go and they forgot to put the sauce on both the crispy chicken costalettas we bought. Didn't go back, but we sure didn't eat much of our meal. Not going back here again."
Robert D.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,121,8,5.0,8/4/2017,"My fiance and I came here for lunch, and were not disappointed. Surprisingly, this was one of the more affordable selections in the area, but was still a bit expensive. Nevertheless, the food was amazing, the atmosphere was great, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The waiter even dropped off coupons for a free slice of cheesecake for when we have future visits! Will definitely be back!"
Diana H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,2.0,6/5/2017,"The food was delicious! But the service was horrible. I had a server name Taylor who only took our order, dropped the check off and that was it. She never came by to ask if wanted refills or sauces or to see how our food was. She kept passing our table. (Rude) Not to mention we waited 10 mins to order. She was very attentive to the tables in front and back of us, but not to my boyfriend and I."
