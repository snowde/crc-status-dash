Michael N.,"San Diego, CA",5,42,23,4.0,6/23/2017,Wow this place is great looking just like most other Cheesecake factories. Ample parking and good service. When it gets busy they make mistakes more often than expected but they mean well. Always have polite and attentive staff and clean bathrooms. Cheesecake consistent with every other Cheesecake Factory I have been to. Not much to brag about here but the stand out is the patio seating that's where you want to be.
Glaser M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,14,,2.0,5/18/2017,"Our server was very sweet and seemed genuine. Then I noticed everyone who came out after us getting their food... apparently the ""system went down when our server put in our order"" which really means she pocketed our ticket and never put it in... we waited 45 mins for our food. Manager did not care whatsoever! I couldn't believe how little she cared about our experience. I was never offered anything to fix the issue. The manager just gave me some half assed apology which I could tell she didn't even want to do. Manager Ashley needs to get some serious training on how to handle different situations. Then once we get our food the rice is undercooked and crunchy. I expect much more for a 20 dollar plate of orange chicken."
Sanjay D.,"Irvine, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/4/2016,"Poor service. The waiters treat you as if you are a dead weight on them. We requested couple of tables for 9 people and they wanted to fit us all on a table meant for 6. Upon asking for 2 tables, the manager seemed to be furious with our expectations??? I would not come to this place with my beats and dears when enjoying a vacation.  Good luck to this place.  Management wake up and train your people to respect the customers."
Randy T.,"Corona, CA",6,7,1,2.0,6/13/2017,Very disappointing. How can a whole restaurant chain run out of steak medallions. Really?
Cami G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,9,1,5.0,7/21/2017,"I've never had better service at any restaurant EVER. Our waiter, Matthew was honestly the best. Pls give him a raise"
Sherly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/3/2017,Worst service. Very rude and inconsiderate manager. And bad customer service. Not like other Cheesecake Factory!!! Unprofessional and worst customer service
Brian M.,"San Diego, CA",3,5,,1.0,4/21/2017,"We live right across the street ... they have a beautiful patio for eating outdoors but they refuse to adequately staff the patio. The inside was empty when we arrived. At least 10 empty tables on the patio, but there was a 30 minute wait for the patio.  Its very disappointing to have to eat indoors on such a beautiful day just becaude management wont check the weather."
Jared Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,40,,2.0,6/30/2017,I feel like this cheesecake factory sticks out amongst the others as the loner. The food is very subpar (either undercooked or under seasoned) and the portions are smaller. The only good thing about this place is the service but I still think food trumps service when writing reviews. I would stay away from this particular Cheesecake and go to the one in Fashion Valley.
Lauren G.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/12/2017,"Typically, going to The Cheesecake Factory is enjoyable. The food is usually good and the service is as well. This afternoon, we got seated shortly after arriving since it was not at all busy. Our waitress was kind and brought us our first round of sodas and waters quickly. She said the bread will come out shortly. We ordered an appetizer, the summer spring rolls, which came out unappealing. They were loosely wrapped and sloppily presented. We ordered our entrees- buffalo wings, avocado toast, and teriyaki chicken. The bread finally came out 35 minutes later. The avocado toast and buffalo wings came out 30 minutes post ordering. However, the teriyaki chicken came out one hour after ordering. Instead of our waitress apologizing for the wait, she said, ""saved the best for last."" Ironically, the teriyaki chicken was lukewarm and had a consistency of gelatinous fat. We immediately asked for boxes, as we had already been at the restaurant for an hour and 45 minutes. We hoped our waitress would ask how to food was, since that's usually wait staff protocol. She didn't. She brought us boxes and our bill. 20 minutes passed and she hadn't returned. We brought the bill to the hostess and asked for the manager. Instead of comping at least the teriyaki chicken, she replied with, ""must just be a lackadaisical Saturday."" The weekends are the busiest days for restaurants, especially in a high tourist spot such as Seaport Village. Quite unfortunate."
Anastasia S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Got seated right away in the back, EVERY SERVER walked by our table and never acknowledged us nor offered us beverages for a horrible 15 minutes until we decided to get up and WALK out. I get better service at Applebee's."
Nancy H.,"San Diego, CA",214,493,1045,5.0,7/30/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory location is just as delicious as the others. The one thing I love about this corporate style restaurant is the organization, reliability and consistence among the different locations. Both with the food & the service.  We visited on National Cheesecake Day so even during lunch it was very busy. We were seated quickly & greeted by our awesome waitress Dawn. We had the factory Nachos with chicken and the buffalo blasts to share. Flavors were great, portions were huge. We enjoyed every carby, cheesy bite."
Iqra K.,"Folsom, CA",109,37,,5.0,7/17/2017,"Food was delicious wish they had more vegetarian options, but overall okay. The Oreo cheesecake was well made and fresh! Would comeback just for the Cheesecake."
Jennifer B.,"San Diego, CA",81,14,2,1.0,6/14/2017,Worst service!!!! Server was so slow and and it took almost 3 hrs to get served and eat. Would not recommend this location. The staff here is not helpful. Fashion Valley location is better!
Eve E.,"San Diego, CA",32,43,13,1.0,9/6/2016,"Tried to do a call in order and was placed on a 10 min ""brief hold"". Person comes on and ask ""how can I help you?"" I say ""I would like to place an order for pick up...""  Person ""oh did you order..."" Me ""no I haven't placed my order yet...""  Person ""oh ummm oh ah what do you want..."" Me ""I have cake pay..."" Person ""oh that doesn't matter..."" Me ""oh my order doesn't matter?... done.""  Really this is the customer service I get someone who doesn't care or listen... hmm. No thanks chain."
Lucas B.,"Kula, HI",251,92,271,4.0,1/24/2016,"Hmm Cheesecake Factory right next to my work is a dangerous thing! They know what they are doing with their cheese cakes and their tapas! A few must tries: fried Mac and cheese balls! Bomb! Stuffed mushrooms are quite Delish! The Thai let us wraps are absolutely to die for! Things to steer clear of: Shepherds pie was bland and overpriced for a helping of potatoes. The nachos... Those were just down right not good! No flavor and nothing that stands out at all! A great idea is to call in a pick up order because they are normally pretty busy. They don't take payments over the phone which is honestly a good thing.  Julie(I think her name was... If not I'm sorry) was absolutely amazing! She helped me pick the perfect meal for the office team and was overly ready to make my day a good one with a single interaction! Made me feel appreciated for the business. All in all I would give it a 4.5 star rating if I could, the major downfall is their menus, it's just too big! Pick a few items and keep it simple and perfect those items!"
Sarah E.,"San Marcos, CA",236,15,74,2.0,1/18/2016,"First time at this location and a last. Service: it was okay... The only great part was how quickly we were seated (party of 5), how quickly the food arrived, and that the server came by often to check-up on us during our meal. Keep in mind it was a Monday night and they weren't too busy. Probably had 3 different servers throughout our dinner. They forgot our appetizer... And when did they stop giving complimentary bread before the meal?! We saw other tables around us either being served with it or without it. Major downgrade not serving free bread to EVERYONE, who doesn't like the free bread at cheesecake?! Cleanliness: very poor for a Cheesecake Factory. Our booth smelled like used dirty rags. Utensils were all placed on top of this rag-smelling table with finger prints on them. I always thought they wrap them in clean napkins? Oh, and I can't forget the appetizer plates that had food stains, I could literally scratch that stuff off! It was so disgusting, so glad I didn't use those plates. Very low lighting and dim that anyone might overlook the lack of clean plates and utensils. The ladies bathroom was okay. Went twice and both times, they didn't refill their paper towels (I prefer the air dryer but it's something I noticed). The floor was wet too. Food: the grilled chicken avocado tasted good according to my sister, but a bit messy due to the small pieces of lettuce falling out. My chicken Caesar salad was delicious besides the croutons being a bit stale. My parents enjoyed their salads but unfortunately forgot the names of the meals. My brother ordered a ribeye steak that was overcooked. Don't bother mentioning it's your birthday because they WILL CHARGE YOU for your birthday cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake was room temperature and the Oreos were stale. Total bummer!!  Pros:  - Server came by often to check-up on us, she was nice  - Got seated right away for a party of 5 (on a Monday night)  - Strawberry lemonade was DELISH as always  Cons: - DIRTY - charged for birthday cheesecake  - not completely satisfied with our meals  - forgot appetizer  - no complimentary bread"
Kimberly S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,12,11,3.0,6/28/2017,"I will usually give 5 stars to places that have top service and food. The food at Cheesecake Factory is always good. The service could use some work. They should really take the suggestion to use open table for people that like to plan ahead. Those who just walk in with no plans can wait. The Cheesecake Factory does not take reservation so you almost always have to wait at this location even if you plan ahead. The hostesses need to learn how to estimate time better. I get there and they quote 20 minutes which I thought was reasonable. It was more like 45+ minutes and this happens every time I go to the harbor location. You have to go here to love the food, the wait will upset you. Plan to be there a while to get your seat, food, and your  check to leave."
Xiang L.,"Stow, OH",43,10,34,1.0,6/28/2017,The server was polite and doing a good job. I've been to different cheesecake factories in different states and this one had the worst taste among all of them. Orange chicken and pineapple chicken were both terrible. So maybe something else may be better?
Jewell C.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/7/2016,"I am very disappointed with this location. I wrote a wonderful review on this location before but after my last visit, a few days ago my opinion has changed.  To start off my brother ordered a Cuban Sandwich and apparently they were sold out. We did let the manager know but all he said was ""sorry its very popular and it takes a long time to prep"". This was the 3rd time that's happened. The waitress was nice but wasn't attentive.  When the food came out the lettuce that came with my boyfriends burrito was old, you could tell due to the discoloration. The spicy chicken sandwich was too fried it was burnt, I peeled it off and only ate half. i didn't complain because the first response that the manager gave me was enough to make me believe that he wouldn't be able to do anything for us.  MY BOYFRIEND AND I COME TO Cheesecake Factory AT LEAST 7 TIMES A MONTH FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. we go here or to the Fashion Valley location.  I would expect this from the Fashion Valley Locations because they are always packed and always busy. This location on the other hand isn't as busy, most times we don't have to wait to be seated and the food quality doesn't compare, its sad and it makes me not want to come here anymore due to the lack of food quality."
Christa S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",8,12,1,5.0,1/6/2017,"Wow! The last time I visited the Cheesecake Factory was as a child. Since then, I've heard many things about this chain, that it's tacky, only good for its cheesecakes, etc. Imagine my surprise when I decide to try a dinner here and leave very satisfied. We were served by Juan and Julia; both of them were polite and quick. I appreciated their quality service. Now the food...AWESOME. I had the Roadside Sliders. Mmmm. Simple yet delicious, just the way I like it. Got a Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake to go. Also tasty. Overall, I feel I must give this restaurant 5 stars for an impeccable night. The shining star of my vacation in San Diego. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
