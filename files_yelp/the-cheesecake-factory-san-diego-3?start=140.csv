Omid B.,"San Diego, CA",66,47,24,2.0,4/28/2017,"i have expected better service for sure and quality they really need to work on this location (management wise) as much as i love down town and harbor area to hang out, i understand they are very busy no matter which one you go to,  but that shouldn't be an excuse to not pay attention to details , bringing out warm margaritas , or cold food , or more is not accepted at all , not from cheesecake factory that i know"
Karie W.,"San Diego, CA",15,4,,1.0,6/25/2017,"The food was terrible, we were extremely disappointed. I couldn't believe we paid $60 for spaghetti that barely had sauce on it, a cheese steak that was fatty and greasy with the hardest bread, and artichoke dip that was like slim. The only think that was somewhat decent was the bacon truffle grilled cheese but it's pretty hard to mess up grilled cheese. We won't be back."
Mark H.,"Riverside, CA",2,47,,2.0,4/2/2017,Food is average. Nothing out of ordinary. Service below per. Waited 3 min for  mikshake after dinner.
Noel I.,"San Diego, CA",222,205,213,1.0,7/30/2016,"I've have eaten at Cheesecake Factory for many years. I've never eaten at this location and wanted to try it. This location is very popular being in the hotel and shopping district of Seaport Village nestled in Downtown San Diego and along San Diego bay. Next door is the Hyatt and Marriott hotels with the Gaslamp Quarter just beyond that. This complex was built on an abandoned Police station and jail. The restaurant's decor is beautiful and reminds me of the main dining halls of the classic cruise ships. Beautiful place.  Now on to my experience.... This place is busy! The hostesses handled the very busy job of turning and seating tables down to s science. The wait staff was much to be expected...The food was good but when the service doesn't match your environment, then you are not getting the full picture. We started off with the MEATBALLS, RICOTTA AND GARLIC CHEESE BREAD...this was absolutely amazing and a meal in itself. We also had FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE, these I will not order ever again. The coating taste like it was burnt and the Mac and cheese inside had no flavor. My entree was the CHICKEN DI PANA which I later realized wasn't. Our waiter gave me a Chicken Piccata instead. I had no idea that she gave me the wrong entree until writing this review. According to the online menu, Chicken Di Pana came with Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes. I got chicken with mushrooms, lemon, capers and a side of pasta. Not realizing that I was eating chicken piccata, I said to my spouse, ""this taste like chicken piccata."" So BOO on our waitress for bringing me something that I didn't order. My spouse had the CHICKEN MADEIRA. He said it was ok. The portions are huge and the prices are a bit on the higher end. The service was ok and would if been better if they hadn't gotten my order wrong. Oh well...."
Sam M.,"San Diego, CA",14,11,8,2.0,8/23/2016,"Very disappointed today. Been coming to cheesecake factory for what .. . 20 years now. Always enjoyed it. Today my wife's long island ice tea came with added protein, a fly. They of course replaced it, but I am shocked. Shocked because they didn't offer to do anything to 'make up' for it as the better restaurants usually do. Case in point, came to another cheesecake factory, the meal was late. Manager came out, we hadn't said anything and provided whole table cheesecake. The manager here IS NOT customer friendly. Haven't even started to begin about the other issue we had at the table. Another thing to add. They just brought me a cheese cake and what do you know, they brought a fly with it. Making me sick now just thinking about it."
Lulus N.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",0,14,,1.0,5/16/2017,"Very bad service this is the second time we come down and request to be seated out side and they tell us we have 30 min Waite ,but is you go out side they have about 10 tables open . They have one waitress  taking orders this is the second this happens to us .not coming back at all there food is not that great to sit and Waite for 30min."
Curtis K.,"San Diego, CA",50,260,271,5.0,4/20/2015,"Great service every time I come. The waiters and waitresses are always attentive, polite and friendly. This has been true for the otay ranch, downtown, and fashion valley locations. Their menu is full of great food that I plan to order again. Some of my favorites are the Cajon jambalaya pasta, the Mac and cheese, and the vinegarette salad. But they have loads more that are great too. If you drink, their cocktails are really delicious. Especially the froo-froo ones. This is pretty much the only place I go to that I order cocktails. This probably since they don't have any decent beer options, which is ok cause I don't feel like this place is a beer type of place. Thus far in my life, I have yet to try cheesecake that is better than theirs, so let me know if I'm missing something. I've had many of their cheesecakes and I have never been disappointed, so pick one that sounds good and just go with it."
Mina M.,"Irvine, CA",15,3,,1.0,5/29/2017,"This the worst cheese cake factory I have ever been to. The waiter was terrible, he brought the bread with no butter saying there are no butter.  A few minutes later we asked another waiter to bring us butter and immediately she brought out a full plate. We also asked the waiter to validate the parking ticket and when we went to pay, we had to pay $24 instead of five, he obviously never validated it it. Worst experience ever!!!!"
Ahmed A.,"San Diego, CA",122,39,19,3.0,4/20/2017,"I like the Resturant them food  good but it talk long time for food come also waiters not organize , I spend more then 40 minutes to get my food !!"
Janaya M.,"Yuma, AZ",6,58,14,5.0,7/17/2016,"Love this place their outdoor seating is very comfortable night or day. The brown bread is a must have with lots of butter. The sour dough has great flavor but it's a little hard on the teeth. You must try the loaded potato tots I think they are called. They are like loved mashed potatoes made into a tater tot and fried, we love them. The Cajun pasta is very good and Parmesan chicken with white sauce a must have. Also for an appetizer order fried macaroni. You will get 4 large balls of macaroni in a batter that has been fried. So yummy.  I recommend the original cheesecake with cherry topping for dessert."
Henry V.,"Arnold, MD",0,9,5,5.0,6/14/2017,"A great restaurant! A short wait for our food but we sang Disney songs to pass the time. When the food arrived, it was delicious. I had the Kid's Pasta with butter sauce and parmesan cheese. We did not get dessert as we are staying in the area and went back to the hotel market/shop for dessert but if we did get cheesecake it would be delicious! It was great even without the dessert. We do enjoy this restaurant and it is highly recommended but only if you want a sit down meal. 5 stars."
Kevin H.,"La Habra, CA",58,25,48,4.0,9/4/2016,The food was great but it was to dark and to loud I give 1 more because they sang my son birthday song thank you omg the steak was so good 5+++ on the food
Melissa B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",197,253,92,4.0,7/13/2016,"I came with a group of friends after the Reptile Super Show this weekend and the wait was quite long. We waited just under an hour and when our buzzer went off we went to the front to be told it was a mistake and would be about another 45 minutes. We were bummed because we were super hungry, but we decided to stay.  Once we were seated our server was excellent and on top of everything. All of us loved our food and desserts. The coconut cheesecake was one of the best sweets I have ever had! I asked my server between that one and the smores and he picked coconut. He was right!"
Lisa W.,"San Diego, CA",2922,1852,5900,3.0,12/3/2014,"Inexistent customer service... I hate big corporate restaurants like Cheesecake because their staff doesn't care about that great customer service, it's not like a 2 or 1 star at Cheesecake Factory on yelp will deter you (or anybody for that fact) from coming here. I get it, just like how much we hate Walmart it won't keep us from going there.  Oh Cheesecake factory. What more can I say? It's just a big chain restaurant. Food is decent. Big portions, you know it's not made out of love from the owners or mom and pop, but you know, you get all that big portion for the amount you are paying. I got the lunch special, the chicken pasta with some lemon slices. It was decent. Need some hot sauce or some love, but it was decent for lunch. Our service on the other hand...was nonexistent. Our server didn't really come around. And when she did everybody tried to get whatever they needed in. It took forever for the bill and even to get some cheesecakes for to go/dessert. I'm not a fan of big establishments but I must say they are good for big groups and the portions are great relative to the price."
Ndial K.,"Tustin, CA",7,26,47,5.0,8/26/2016,The food is so amazing every time I eat at this place. I love the calamari and the kids enjoy the kids meal The portions are super big. Try the stake with wasabi  My kids don't want to leave this place....
Kiki T.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,162,1393,1.0,7/20/2016,"For the service!! After being seated...NO ONE came to our service for 15 minutes!!!!! Servers were just walking back & forth by our table & not ONE acknowledgement!!!! Finally someone ask if we been helped!!! I don't think he was even assigned to this section. UPDATED: I asked our replaced server & he said the other server quit, because it's Comic Con day!"
janice t.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,23,31,4.0,4/17/2016,"First off, I dont know why this is my first time to write a review for cheesecake factory when this is our go-to place for weekend lunch or dinner either on this location (downtown) or otay ranch mall in eastlake.  Well today we got a calamari for our appetizer. Its crunchy, tasty matches great with their two sauces, mayo with garlic and sweet and sour sauce. Yum! For our entrees, husband and myself both ordered their lunch special, with soup, salad and chicken sandwich and bow tie parmesan pasta from kids menu for the little one with a free drink (juice, milk) . I remember there was one time a manager came up to us to apologize for the delay of our food, other time we ordered miso salmon with white rice and rice was undercooked! :-( No drama today as food came out fine considering that its sunday and its lunch time! Our server, Angelica, was polite and attentive. Gracias, mija!  ."
Eric C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,3.0,4/29/2017,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factor, this one was very standard with the typical menu. Our party was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, but we ended up waiting closer to 30 minutes. Having worked in a restaurant for a few years, I can say that the group of hostesses working that night need to  step it up in terms of organization and promptness. Other than that, our server was overall quite attentive and the food came out as expected. They have outdoor seating which heat lamps which was quite nice. Would come again simply because you know what to expect food-wise at any Cheesecake Factory, although this one could be better run from a management perspective."
mike g.,"San Diego, CA",6,38,287,1.0,1/29/2017,Gave them another try and failed again. Service is non existence. You better order what ever you want the first and only time you see your server and ask them to bring out your food asap instead of letting it sit under a heat lamp. All the negative reviews are for service and food not being consistent. For such a big franchise I have no idea way they are letting this location fail.
Chris A.,"San Diego, CA",16,1,,5.0,5/1/2017,I order a Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken and it was delicious ! The service is great and the staff is so friendly. I will be going back soon.
