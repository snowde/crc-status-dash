Lupita C.,"Norwalk, CA",0,6,4,1.0,8/3/2016,"Horrible, waited for almost 45min. Then my daughters spaghetti was very oily, dry and hard pasta for being  a long time under the heater, I order the spicy chicken chilpotle pasta also very dry, my husband order the classic burger no flavor, he ask for sauté mushrooms they were raw, sweet potato fries, omg. You can count the fries, very little and ice cold.  There was no manager to tell about our food, until the end"
Rick M.,"Newark, NJ",76,29,,5.0,3/25/2017,"I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it was a bit busy. I was pressed on time, so I ordered the fish tacos to go and sat outside while I waited. 10 minutes or so later, the employee brought the food out to me with a smile. The fish tacos were delicious!"
Ivy R.,"San Diego, CA",624,223,59,2.0,11/18/2015,"I ordered the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken. It was way saltier than how I am used to having it. Waitress didn't serve us any bread. I had asked for some and she never came back with it. This was on a very slow night, must I add. Positives- I feel like this place isnt as busy as the other Cheesecake Factory locations.  Won't be back at this location. Would rather wait at a busier location for accurate service."
Andrew L.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",258,134,23,2.0,2/12/2016,"This location is ALWAYS busy. With that said, prepare to wait and then wait some more for food. Everything about this cheesecake factory is the same mediocre chain restaurant you'll find in another city and I have been fine with that up until my visit last night. My party of 3 sat in the bar area with a pleasant, but slow server. Seems like a theme here... 15 minutes after sitting down, we get menus. side note- Though my $12 Sangria was delicious, it was definitely 70% fruit juice. Thats an expensive glass of fruit juice.  My friend ordered a chinese chicken salad (normally great) which came out within 15 minutes of ordering. After waiting a few minutes with the other food not anywhere in sight, she gave into temptation and started on her salad without us. 10 more minutes pass by and the server awkwardly says that her salad is for the next table over. I look over at the family next to us and the entire family is enjoying their meal... except for the mother. Whoops.. guilt trip. The server explains that my friend was eating a skinny salad instead and that her normal chinese chicken salad would be out soon.  15 minutes pass and  YAY! my Thai lettuce wraps have arrived. Again, my two friends entrees are nowhere in sight for another 15 minutes. The server notices and does a mini-freak out behind the kitchen (we could see from our high top table) and wah-lah.. magic! The other two entrees come out another 15 minutes later. By this time, I was done with my lettuce wraps and my mini shrimp tempura plate, my friend with the salad was already full from the other half salad she ate by accident, and my other friend was pissed because they forgot about the meal. If you did math from the numbers above, the meal was over an hour and a half. Now that would've been fine if I was actually enjoying the time there, but in all seriousness I couldn't wait to walk across the street back to my apartment. I think a to-go order would've been a better experience."
Brad B.,"San Diego, CA",4917,964,1518,3.0,9/9/2015,"Yeah, three stars sums up this location pretty well as my experience here was ""A-OK,"" nothing less, nothing more.  Seeing that I was dragged here for a little work meeting I can't complain too much, but the major bummer comes in the form of some less than stellar service. The life has been sucked from the staff and their unhappiness is served to the customer with every slice of the Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake. Can you imagine having to suggest that countless times throughout the day? Oh boy. I actually opted for the grilled chicken tostada salad even though my dad bod has officially made it through bathing suit season - healthy options, bro! I must say, it was an interesting choice, which is odd because this salad was described to be piled high with everything I like. Something was off though... what can it be? The cooks mistook parsley for cilantro! Weird, weird, weird, but I was hungry, hungry, hungry and in a hurry, hurry, hurry. Terrible? No. More than interesting... in a bad way? Yes.  My final gripe is the check being dropped before we were done eating and then realizing that it wasn't even our check. It was actually another table's closed out credit card awaiting signature. Whoooops! Good thing we're some honest peeps or I'd be walking home with a new pair of Ray-Bans and a full tank of gas.  Want to know how to do things right, Cheesecake Factory of San Diego? Read my review of Cheesecake Factory of Anaheim: "
Robert Z.,"WARNER SPGS, CA",148,359,3420,2.0,5/16/2016,"05/15/2016 Our family of six visited this Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch after attending a graduation ceremony on the USS Midway.   First off we have eaton at many Cheesecake Factories here in California.  All were 4 Star Plus for Food, Quality, and Service. Sadly This Place DOSN'T fit that description.  Our family all voted this Factory A Generous 1 1/2 To 2 Star Rating.   First the service. Even though our server was nice and polite she kept disappearing without bringing what we asked for.  One of us ordered a salad and never got her salad dressing till everyone else had Finished there meals.   Now The Food. I ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger. I have ordered it an other locations and loved it.  Sadly this time the quality was an extreme letdown. The Strip Bacon was just barely OK but the Pork Belly was so over cooked it was dry and hard like beef jerky and only two tiny chips of it. Very Very Disappointing.  It's a great burger a other locations. The salad were just ok.  The shrimp tacos were not to bad off the skinny menu.  Nothing to write back to Mexico about. The French Toast was good and tasty but it's a small order. The Best Thing We Had was The Chocolate Milk Shake.  Tasty. We did stop at the Cheesecake Counter to get some to go home. I'm sorry to say the girl behind the counter was extremely rude to all the customers and acted like we were bothering her by ordering some cake.  She stead to my wife,  ""So What Do You Want""  and not in a nice way.   The only good thing was the Cheesecake was Fantastic as usual. I've written over 200 yelp restaurant reviews.  This is one of the saddest ones I've Hade to write.  We Will Never dine here again nor will any of my Yelp Followers.    I Hope Corporate Management Reads This and Has A Word with This Particular Store.  Their Giving The Cheesecake Factory Brand A Bad Name."
Missy K.,"San Diego, CA",176,186,160,2.0,6/3/2016,Other then the noise and the long wait the food Just took an eternity to get here! Then their was a beetle in my husbands salad so gross because he wasn't small! Poor guy died in a freaking salad! Can you imagine?!!! Your having the best time of your life wild and free and someone tosses your ass in a salad!
Carolina A.,"San Diego, CA",336,40,88,4.0,10/25/2015,"Normally when I go to Cheescake factory, I leave unsatisfied and feel like I could have had a much nicer dinner experience else where. Ps. the only reason I return, is I literally live right across the street from this location. This location for some reason is always overly crowded with extremely long waits. Last night however, I actually really enjoyed my dinner! :) I ordered the chinese chicken salad, (basic I know) but it was a really really yummy chinese chicken salad! My wait to be seated was actually pretty short for a Saturday night and my server was friendly and attentive. I may have changed my mind about Cheese cake factory......but just for the Chinese chicken salad."
Julius M.,"San Diego, CA",17,7,,1.0,12/23/2016,"This place has the worse customer service they don't even acknowledge customers. Terrible service, must be a company thing because the one in fashion valley is the same thing"
Janet C.,"Warner Springs, CA",8,1,,1.0,5/15/2016,Your service at the counter stunk .  I had to ask for help  The girl behind he counter was down right rude ! What happen to customer service !  Without customers you would not have a job  Not coming back
Jasmine L.,"San Diego, CA",2,34,1,2.0,7/31/2017,The worst cheesecake in San Diego. Service is slow. Portions are smaller and people who work here don't know how to answer basic questions. Never coming to this location again.
Asso M.,"El Cajon, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/2/2017,I just felt sooooo bad because I went to that location the service was so bad with delays for everything it was my daughter's Birthday and invited the whole family but never was happy because of the server any way I decided never to go there ever.
Eutropia M.,"San Diego, CA",186,91,189,4.0,1/2/2016,This is one of my favorite restaurants. The chicken madera is always consistent and my fave dish. It is chicken breasts smothered with mushrooms & asparagus in a lightly sweet sauce and the best mashed potatoes. I also really enjoy the pasta devinci. It consist with a wine sauce with sliced up chicken and mushrooms. Of course you cannot leave without trying their famous cheesecakes. My personal favorite is the macadamia nut cheesecake a-la-mode.
Jeanette T.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,22,8,4.0,9/1/2016,"The waitress was very nice. We came in a big party and wersat quickly, the only thing was that we didn't get our drinks or that yummy bread until like 15 minutes later. There was a party of 4 right next to us they were helped right away drinks and bread ready to go that was the only thing that I was really not satisfied with in the beginning. Overall had a great time at dinner with my family."
Dee E.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Let me start off by saying I love Cheesecake Factory BUT this location is by far the worst experience I've had at any restaurant! I don't recommend coming here... this is why : I came with a party of 10people on a Thursday night Checked in at 7:30. We didn't get seated till 10pm. (Had to stay because we were there for a bday). Upon my ordering I was disappointed to find out that the one thing on the menu I have ordered for years was off the menu.... the birthday girl also had her entree removed from the menu.. what the server recommended was NOT anywhere near what  I wanted... we had to rush our dinner because the place closes at 11... finally I asked the server if he could ring me out first since I needed to leave sooner than anyone else., he then proceeds to ask everyone if they too would like separate checks and I'm stuck waiting around for another 20min while he is giving 10people separate checks and boxes to go! At this point my baby was fussy and crying and I rushed out of there forgetting to validate my car and ended up paying $35 for parking which happened to be more than my meal. I ended up paying about 60$ that night. For a less than an hour dinner. This place is horrible and I will not be recommending it and def won't be returning!"
Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,2.0,7/23/2016,"Unfortunately, this was one Cheesecake Factory location which needs help on a number of aspects to their operations. For one, sat outside in the later part of the evening around 8pm and the patio was dark. They don't offer above lighting, but you may get lucky with near by lighting on the sidewalk or around the business. They offer a candle at the table, but the cup it's in is dark brown or black therefore, the brightness won't fully display. Expect to be in the dark and to not be able to see your guests or menu. Used my iPhone light...had too.  Upon sitting down, our server came within minutes and provided us with drinks. Once order was placed, the server advised bread was baking in oven. Order arrived of BBQ salad and spaghettini and meat balls. Salad tasted watery. As if, it was drenched in water, not wiped down and just served. Not cool.  The taste of the salad was ruined even though it also had avocado, corn and black beans. I couldn't believe such a salad would be served.  Server was advised and supervisor came over to talk over the salad.  Advised server for plates, salad dressing and side of onion strips which were originally ordered. The supervisor didn't understand what watered down meant so had to explain in different terms, but he offered to make a new salad. At this point, there was no point as my meal was half completed.  The spaghetti and meatballs were okay. There wasn't much taste to meal. Dish only also included 3 meatballs. There was tomato sauce surrounding it,  but sauce didn't provide any further flavor. While almost done with our meal, the sever never did offer bread. Had to ask the server after flagging her down as she seemed more focused on a larger group over us, but she did eventually bring us what we originally asked for in our order. In the end, the bread never came, didn't finish the salad as I became disgusted with it and was disappointed in the overall experience. The salad was $13 and the spaghettini and meatballs $16. Not worth the price, experience, lack of quality or sitting in the dark on a patio. Their salads are as much in price as their entrees. They do however get stars for getting me in earlier than they said on the wait time, from 50 minutes to 30 minutes and for their supervisor who came over and listened about the salad issue thus, offered to bring out a new one. In my opinion, they need help on service, quality of food preparation and taste and customer service along with recognizing customer needs."
W C.,"Irvine, CA",5,133,25,1.0,7/4/2017,"First of all, any Elite Yelpers giving 5 stars to the likes of Cheesecake Factory and saying the food is ""amazing"" should have their Elite status revoked. On to the review...Service at this location is God awful. Hostess was less than accommodating with a simple request for a table by the windows. Even though we walked by 6 that were available. I don't care what your system generated seating strategy tells you, but when customers request a table and it's available, you give it  to them. So of course those 6 tables were filled up 15 minutes after we were seated. We then had the good luck of a server that looked like she just hated her job. No smile, no nothing. Rude and took forever just to bring the drinks. She was then replaced by another server who was OK. Turns out the lady server was just covering our table until the server for that area clocked in, so she was just in a ""I don't give a shit it's not my table"" attitude."
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,3.0,5/30/2014,"Of all the C-Factories, this one has to be the most ""tourist heavy"". But that's understandable, considering the downtown location.  As a rule, if you want a booth or table you'll need to put your name on the list and wait, typically 30-45 minutes or more. Don't believe what the gals at the front tell you, if they say 15-20 minutes, it's a LIE.  But, if you're willing to take a chance and need to eat almost immediately, grab an open stool table near the bar (or sit at the counter). You'll also get to watch the game on the big screens above the bartenders. This will usually work for groups of 4 or less.  Service is typically friendly, quick and efficient. There's no let down in quality or attentiveness because of where we were sitting.  There was extra care to how my slice of banana cream cheesecake was presented.  I'll be back."
Natalie T.,"Ann Arbor, MI",300,90,744,4.0,6/7/2015,"I'm not ashamed.  I will always have a special place in my heart for the Cheesecake Factory.  We visited this place twice while in San Diego on vacation.  I know what you're thinking...when you're on vacation, why would you go someplace that you have back in your city?  And the answer is that sometimes, you just have to go with what you know.  You know what to expect, you know they have options, and you know that you'll enjoy it. We started out saying we'd only try placing that were unique to San Diego and that we didn't have in Michigan and we started out the first part of our trip that way but then my eating companions got really turned off from a place the staff at our hotel suggested.  We asked around about some other well-known, really good spots in San Diego and tried those as well.  They were okay but nothing to write home about.  And so, we ended up at the good ole' Cheesecake Factory, which has never disappointed me. This location set-up is like the typical Cheesecake Factory.  They had a nice outdoor area in the front of the restaurant as well.  The menu is so large.  They pretty much have anything you could possibly want.  Some may find this overwhelming and intimidating.  Like my eating companion complained that the menu was too large.  I love options though so you won't hear me complain.  It does take me quite a while to determine what I want though because I have to determine what I'm in the mood for. We actually ate here twice in one day :-)  It was that good.  For lunch, I had the grilled chicken BLT with avocado and a side of fries.  It was so good and they give you nice portion sizes.  I also asked for my bread to be switched to another type because I didn't want the regular white bread the sandwich comes on and it was really tasty!  I got honey mustard and BBQ sauce on the side for dipping, which made it taste even better.  (I'm definitely a sauce girl!)  When I came back for dinner, I got the fried shrimp basket with fries and a side salad.  The shrimp were a really good size and fried perfectly to a crisp, golden brown.  The side salad was a really good addition as well because I felt like I was lacking in the greens and live veggie department while on vacation.  It made me feel a little less guilty about scarfing down another set of french fries that day.  They give you a nice bread basket that comes with a few varieties of bread and butter.  And for dessert, I had some of my friend's chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips on top and whipped cream on the side.  I'm not a huge chocolate on chocolate fan but it was pretty good, I must admit. Our service during lunch was excellent.  Our dinner service left something to be desired.  Our waiter was not good at all.  I understand they were a lot busier at night but he could've done a lot better.  Even still, it doesn't subtract from the love I have for The Cheesecake Factory.  It will always hold a special place in my heart."
Andy M.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2,18,98,2.0,7/16/2016,"Great food, average service, 2nd visit, very busy with usa graduations June 2016, waited an hour for table, another half an hour to sit down, good atmosphere despite wait, would go again but earlier, not at weekend, when less busy"
