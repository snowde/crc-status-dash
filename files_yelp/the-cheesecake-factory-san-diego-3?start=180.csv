Ran K.,"Gardena, CA",1,4,10,1.0,7/24/2016,"There was already a big crowd of people waiting at around 4:30 P.M., when my party and I arrived (Comic-Con is happening this weekend). A host in the front told us we could seat ourselves at an open table around the bar area, so we did. A couple minutes after, a waiter came to our table and told us we had to move and that there was another party coming to sit there soon. Confused, we got up and put our names in again.  I went outside (keep in mind that it's about 90°) and waited to be called. I just so happened to see Tyler Posey (from MTV's Teen Wolf) walk into the restaurant. Pretty cool! About twenty minutes later we were seated on the outside patio, in the direct sunlight. I felt like I was literally burning, considering the table is metal. After about fifteen minutes, we still weren't taken care of by a waiter or waitress. At that point, someone from my party went to the management and explained the problem. But the worker just brought out a random waiter to take our drink orders.  We got our drinks a few minutes later, but by a completely different waiter, or should I say waitress. She seemed a bit frazzled because of the hectic nature of the restaurant, but was professional and helpful. She even got an extra umbrella for our table.  If it hadn't been for our waitress coming in and saving the day, we would have probably left. Food was good as always and people-watching cosplayers from Comic-Con was entertaining."
Dave H.,"Lakewood, CA",4,14,15,1.0,12/29/2016,It has three stars and I should have not gone there! Josh the manager is rude and this place is run so bad. It is dirty and the staff needs a lesson on customer service. Avoid it at all cost!
David R.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,10,1.0,3/6/2016,"Have always been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory - have been to roughly 15 of them!  Tonight was the first time I was disappointed - which then led to frustration/anger/laughter after front desk and then manager Joshua Shurmet completely failed on the service level.  Ordered with Door Dash (have done this before) food arrived within 45 minutes, nice and warm.  I ordered extra cashews in the spicy cashew chicken (one of my guilty pleasures).  Unfortunately when opened there were only 7-10 cashews (being generous on my count).  Confirmed receipt had extra cashews.  Then opened my avocado egg rolls only to see 4 of the 6 were brown/grey on avocado.   I called the store, told the hostess - she did not even say ""so sorry"" or anything, instead ""K"" and then put me on hold. What is wrong with this cheesecake factory I thought? Well, the answer picked up roughly 7 minutes after being put on hold. The problem - Joshua Shurmet.   Please sit down for this because you may fall over when you read what Joshua said about the low count of cashews: ""Maybe the delivery company ate them"".  Seriously. No it gets better, after highlighting how ridiculous this response was - it was like he doubled down and nearly insisted the delivery company ate my extra cashews - there was no way, just not possible that the cook didn't put the extra cashews in the dish.  I thought this guy was so hilarious I HAVE to get him on my radio show (Every Tuesdays at 7pm).  Unfortunately, Joshua refused.  I didn't want to further discuss the brown/grey avocado's in the rolls, he would have probably said the driver must have spray painted them or something.  I will not go to this location again, at least as long as this manager is there."
Rob W.,"Irvine, CA",1,17,,2.0,5/2/2016,"My buddy and I were in town for business and decided to go there for lunch. After being seated, it took about 5-7 minutes for the waiter to come greet us. By then, we already knew what we were ordering.  After ordering, the food food took longer then expected. My turkey sandwich was bland and they forgot the avocado. I think the waiter visited our table maybe twice during our visit.  We won't be going back for the rest of the week we're visiting."
Dan R.,"Spring Valley, CA",9,13,,1.0,5/15/2017,"First and foremost let me just say that I have dined at this location prior to this recent incident and the service has always been piss poor to say the least. Today however I went in with a friend during our lunch break. We stayed this to our server she replied with no worries. We sat down placed our order 20 minutes later we received our meal grilled pork chops and a pizza salad lunch combo. The food was brought out all except the salad that goes with my pizza. I asked them for it and was told it would be right up and it wasn't. I waited and ate my pizza my coworker was having trouble eating her very dry pork chop so she spoke to waiter who then produced his manager Gabriella Uribe who after trying to makeup for the lackluster food with a slice of cheesecake, then offered to remake the food which we had no time for. So after a lengthy passive aggressive lecture she agreed to discount the chops. She left to what we thought was to rectify the bill and never returned. During the wait I'm attempting to get the attention of a server or team member but they were all congregating by the main entrance talking and laughing. I see a member walk away and say excuse and raised my hand to gesture to him but he walked by nose up in the air ignoring me. So I said excuse me loudly and he turns to look at me with a look of disgust and anger as he walks towards me I can see the rage on his face. I ask can I have a to go box please. He stares me down and walks away. He returns and says you didn't have to yell. I said no one was paying attention to me so I had to speak up to get someone's attention since I had not seen my server in quite some time. Mind you I have no salad still. So the guy is still being confrontational and when I ask to speak to the manager he says to me ""I am the manager"". I say you find your behavior to be that of a manager? He replies you didn't have to yell! Seriously! Seriously! If I'm being ignored and am on a time crunch should I inconvenience myself and walk to you to get a box??? Am I in a fast food grease trap??? No!!! I expect the service that comes with the level of food and cost that I am paying for!!! I the customer!!! So George Habashy so called Sr manager I will be reporting this! And your poor penmanship won't deter me from reporting your full name.  And I will be placing this review on many social media sights!"
Dawn S.,"Mesa, AZ",51,53,1,2.0,4/17/2016,"Ate here with a family of 5 on April 16. Items Ordered: -(adult) Chicken alfredo -2 kids chicken alfredo -pina colada -2 cheesecakes -iced tea TOTAL: $78 plus tip PROS: -Location is great -Outside seating at night looked beautiful, very relaxing -Cheesecakes were great - as always CONS: -Was told the wait would be 15 minutes, we ended up waiting 30 minutes -Waiter was not very good - we had to remind him to bring us bread and a few other things he had to be reminded of This is experience was a big letdown. We frequent other locations in AZ pretty frequently and always had a great experience with food and service so this location surprised me. We'd probably try it again, but maybe for dessert only."
SMay M.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,10,,2.0,4/30/2017,"Gone downhill.  Everything from service, food to the bathroom. I am not sure if it is the chain or this location.  1.) Service took way too long.  We were asked for our order - it took 25 minutes, Then, we ordered and many couples received their appetizers AND lunch before we even got a salad I had hope to share with the table. 2.) The salad comes after the entree. The orders we floating in sauce and 2 of the plates looked like they sat in the heater- while they made pasta again. Never apolopized- but said - Hey, you ""got an upgrade- do you want chicken in your Alfredo?"" 2.) The server was obvious to anything- we did have a wonderful""server"" who delivered the food- he asked if there was anything wrong- and he tried to fix it. We had asked the waiter for hot peppers 1st- then server- the server brought it to us in half the time. He said"" I saw it just sitting there."" 3.) The bathroom was dirty- towels everywhere. Toilet paper on the floor- it was 1:00 pm.  They still had a long day ahead. In short, I am thinking that CCF is going downhill in food quality and service. Too many other options."
Amanda H.,"Bellingham, WA",0,3,2,1.0,11/1/2016,Tuesday night at 530pm was absolutely the worst service I've ever had. The manager came out and gave some b.s.  apology and said we'd only been waiting 18 minutes. Sorry but I have a watch and am not a total idiot. Will not be returning here.
Jordan J.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/16/2017,Nothing but quality. It was really nothing but quality. I could not believe how much quality there was. Really no other place has this much quality. I only go to restaurants with the best quality. I'm all about quality and I make sure to only hangout with other homies who are all about quality too so we have lots of quality.
Aisha N.,"Escondido, CA",37,72,1352,4.0,5/5/2016,"Even with an overcast day, the outdoor seating was exquisite. The decor is just perfection. Very comfortable and with umbrellas in case the sun is beaming on you. We arrived at 11:45a. They open at 11a so it was a great time to order/dine because the food came out in less than 15 minutes. My only gripe was with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They weren't as flavorful as I remember them being. I liked the Asian style wraps much better. Overall it was an amazing meal, just wished I would've enjoyed a margarita since its Cinco De Mayo! Lol! We ended with a delicious Salted Caramel Cheesecake. It was think, rich, and definitely enough for two people. We parked in the Seaport Village Parking lot which is $4 for 3 hours with validated parking. I wasn't sure if there was any other location to park for a cheaper rate and within walking distance."
Meiko H.,"San Diego, CA",305,292,278,5.0,8/25/2015,"This is a 2 visit review because I just realized I never finished my review I started a year ago. DOH!  1. For kiddo's Birthday Month last year, her godmom and I took her to lunch and it was delish! We ordered a couple of small plates - Crispy Cuban Rolls and Loaded Baked Potato Tots. Both were great, especially the Cuban Rolls. It was like a Cubano sandwich in an egg roll wrapper. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, kiddo ordered the Buffalo Burger and godmom ordered the fish tacos.  I don't remember anything being bad so let's just say everything was really good and we had some good laughs and quality time together which was even better. 2. The 3 of us were supposed to come back together on the anniversary but godmom couldn't make it so it was just lil' mama and myself which is always fine by me! It looked pretty crowded when we got there but fortunately the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Our server Michelle was great and helped me decide on an entree - Chicken Bellagio. I had told my daughter how I used to get the grilled pork chop a lot and she opted for that. We asked for our comp brown bread w/butter and we were happy campers until the food arrived shortly after. Daughter's chop was cooked perfectly w/mashed potatoes, green beans and applesauce to accompany it. I used to love taking a bite of chop and then a bite of applesauce but when my kid tried it, she almost gagged! Haha, she wasn't expecting something about the texture of the apples and warm applesauce flavor so let's just say she didn't love that part as much as I do! Other than that, her meal was on point. My chicken was 2 crispy cutlets served on top of basil cream pasta with prosciutto/arugula salad on top. It was really good and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  For dessert, she got the Salted Caramel cheesecake and I got the Chocolate chip coconut cheesecake(Chris's Outrageous, I think it's called). Either way, they were both scrumptious. We took our leftovers home to devour the next day. Well, kiddo ate the rest of her cheesecake that night but I'm still working on mine. She hasn't learned the art of savoring foods yet. Plus, you don't gain weight if you space out your high calorie eating, right? Right."
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,4.0,2/14/2014,"Cheesecake Factory strikes again! I love the new location located at Seaport Village. Its tucked away in quaint mini outside shopping center that shares space with the likes of Puesto, a Mexican eatery, Seasons 52, and Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse.   This is another great date night location. My description of this charming San Diego gem would be 'intimate with a small town village vibe'. Parking is convenient and plentiful...as long as you're good with paying $5 when you let Cheesecake Factory validate your ticket. Not a bad deal IMHO. Just pay the $5 and be done with it folks. There are also meters just in front of Vic & Anthonys at the courtyard entrance to the Cheesecake Factory. Meters run all day at cost; they are $1.50 per hour with a two hour max:( There is a public lot just across from the meters before entering Seaport Village. The public lot is free after 6pm.  I'm a professed shopaholic, so the fact that I could burn through some cash at Lolo's Calisto's and then proceed just a few doors down to buy beach attire for my upcoming vacation...AWESOME!!!  Like most people, I give Starbucks a monthly allotment. So, it's nice to have a Starbucks location straddled amongst all the eateries. It's just perfect for that after dinner pick me up.  Dessert at Cheesecake Factory is always a treat, but, when you're in the mood for something sweet, but on the lighter side. Not to worry, head out of Cheesecake factory and grab yourself some gelato in the courtyard.  We arrived for dinner and were seated promptly. This blew us away. Never thought I'd see that happen at a Cheesecake Factory. Service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly and attentive.  My pineapple mojito was wonderful as usual. This is a great drink if you look sweeter cocktails. The food was also delicious. We ordered the loaded baked potato tots as an appetizer. Oh boy were these good. The gumbo and the salmon special (just ask, it's not on the menu) were also divine.  Way to go Cheesecake Headquarters! We'll be back to see you again real soon!"
Cl S.,"San Diego, CA",16,37,2,3.0,6/5/2017,No line. Now I know why. Filet Mignon was medium rare and perfect. Green beans were cooked just right but so loaded with black pepper that I could only eat 2 bites. Ate about half of the mashed potatoes because that was all of the salt that I could handle. Danielle was efficient and friendly but please don't interrupt conversations in mid sentence. Turn down the music a bit to facilitate conversation. Pass on this location. The others are worth the wait.
Laura W.,"Olympia, WA",0,8,,1.0,4/10/2016,VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not what I expected from a Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was very nice and doing the best he could under the circumstances. Getting our food was SLOW. Keep in mind it was about 2:00 on a Friday afternoon and they were not busy. To compensate our waiter kept bringing out more bread. You can only eat so much bread. We wanted our food. When I asked when our food was coming the manager came over and was VERY RUDE. Our whole party was very taken aback by it. My salad was TERRIBLE and honestly kind of gross looking. Wet wilted lettuce and MISSING KEY INGREDIENTS.  We were planning on ordering desert but skipped it because we all couldn't wait to get out of there and try and forget the whole experience.
Melissa T H.,"The Woodlands, TX",274,465,2054,3.0,2/12/2014,"If you don't find great street parking, just valet for $15.  Since Seaport village parking is $3 for 2 hrs WITH Village validation (apparantly the Minimum is $10 purchase) and $8/hr with no validation, it adds up fast and you are better off just valet for $15.  I forked out $24!!!  The service at this Cheesecake was good.  We were a big party split over two tables.  The food took a little while to come out, but to be fair, the servers were awesome and let us split the checks, which justifies why the food didn't come out at the same time.  I enjoyed the Cobb salad ok.  There was nothing wrong with it, and it was a generous portion for sure... while it was nice to try something different, I wouldn't order it again since it wasn't spectacular.  I'd definitely suggest the beet/goat cheese salad any day."
SoCalReviewe R.,"San Diego, CA",0,38,,4.0,1/1/2017,Dinner was very good. Employees delivered excellent service. Meals were very good. $5 for a glass of lemonade that was 90% ice is a bit much.
Julie K.,"Santee, CA",107,6,7,2.0,7/31/2016,"I normally do not post reviews but in this case I have to. We went to the Seaport Location for the first time last night and the service and food were not very good.  I ordered the fried zucchini as I always do. When they came to the table they were cold and thin like fries. Nothing like they are normally made at every other Cheescake Factory I have ever been to.  The biggest pet peve I have is if a server does not clear the dirty appetizer dishes before the main meal dishes are served. Sure enough...the dinner came out and was plopped on a table full of dirty dishes! To make it worse, our server walked away without taking them! What? He had to make room between the dirty dishes to put the meal dishes down! Then a female server brought my husbands plate and said ""oh let me clear these dirty dishes"". She wasnt even our server and noticed that the table was full of dishes that needed to be cleared.   I ordered the Tuscan Chicken dish that I love, with extra farro and easy tomatoes. When the dish came it was cold and the tomatoes still looked like then were not cooked. There was barely a full tablespoon of farro! Then the waiter came and handed me a basil sauce that is normally already on the dish to add to my dish! What! When I asked him for more farro he seemed annoyed! I ordered it that way, why was he getting annoyed?  It took so long for the farro to be broght to me that i asked for a box to take the whole meal home as it was Ice cold by now. Ugh. When we asked for more hot water for our hot tea, the server grunted! Why? We are having a dinner out and wanted to enjoy the evening! To have such terrible service and food was so disapointing from a restaurant that we normally know will be amazing! This location needs to get it together!"
Deniz D.,"San Diego, CA",12,7,1,4.0,12/8/2015,I tried original cherry cheesecake and I love it. We shared one slice with my husband and it was enough both of us after having dinner.  The ambience of restaurant was really cool and waiters are so friendly.
Jordan L.,"San Diego, CA",0,129,,3.0,12/2/2016,"Had dinner there yesterday with a good friend.  didn't have to wait too long for a table which is unusual for cheesecake factory but again it was a week night. I didn't order any appetizers but my friend had three small plates, some kind of spring rolls and flatbread and something else all of what she likes. For drinks, I had The JW lemonade with raspberry liquor, it wasn't good I wouldn't get it again.  My friend had a red sangria, which she said tasted diluted.  Then she got a blood orange martini which she liked much better. For entrées she got something with chicken. I got the chicken Bellagio which was OK. For dessert we cut in half a banana cream cheesecake which of course was delicious"
Daphne L.,"San Diego, CA",1382,1153,1103,5.0,1/17/2015,"I am and will always be a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I love the salads and the cheesecake. I also love the Chicken Piccata. I highly recommend lunch at The Cheesecake Factory because the lunch prices are very affordable. I really like this location because it's right next to Seaport Village. After lunch or dinner, you can take a walk at Seaport Village and support local businesses! The only downside is parking. Parking is basically whatever street parking you can find or pay for parking nearby."
