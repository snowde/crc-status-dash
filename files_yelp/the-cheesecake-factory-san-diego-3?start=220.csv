Dennis B.,"Inglewood, CA",123,112,197,4.0,4/4/2015,"Sunday morning I always get the Buttermilk Pancakes, they are very delicious. They come hot and golden brown. The only problem is that they freeze the butter and makes it kinda hard to spread on the pancakes."
Rakhi B.,"San Diego, CA",51,126,3,5.0,9/15/2016,I am a big fan and have been going to this place since it had one location in san diego.  This location is a must to check out as it is bigger and you can walk around sea port after eating all the yummy good.  I am so glad for the skinnylicious menu and it was so delicious as well.  OF course cant complain about the drink and bread as well.
Chandler G.,"Core-Columbia, San Diego, CA",152,7,2,5.0,5/2/2017,Love the food this place is awesome! Not to mention the amount of cheese cakes they offer hence the name. The service at the Cheese Cake Factory is most always on point.
Hazel S.,"Ontario, CA",0,65,5,3.0,10/23/2015,"Normally the service at other cheese cake factory locations is great. But today was beyond slow and the restaurant was only half full. The orders came out in a random order at varying times and our entire meal took almost 2 hours. It was an unpleasant experience. I hope the issue can be resolved for other guests, seems like servers dropped the ball.  The food did taste quite great though, and their cheesecake is great!"
Cris M.,"Temecula, CA",1,7,1,1.0,4/28/2016,"I decided to write a review after tonight... Not the first time we have an issue with a hostess / manager at this location. We walk in and are taken to our booth right away, everything seems great until we sit down... The floor felt slippery so we look under and it's absolutely filthy. Pieces of meat, water, straws...its was unacceptable and I was shocked they took us to our table and expected us to be ok with it. I pointed it out to the hostess and said "" oh, yeah, I'll see if someone can come sweep it... Or you can have another table, your choice"".... She walked away, left us standing in the isle... Nobody came so we walked up to the front and asked if we could just have another table. She didn't seem very concerned and said ""ok, your choice"" and then told us the next table would be ready in 45 minutes (restaurant wasn't packed, it's a Thursday night). My husband asked her to just have the place cleaned, she replied with ""well, there was someone already on their way but you said you wanted another table"". To make a long story short, my husband spoke to the manager who never came and checked in on us as she said she would, until we called her and pointed out a piece of meat still left behind, across from our booth. She didn't seem sincere or truly concerned. She was  oblivious. Never returning to this location.... Otay Ranch is definitely better and has better service.  By the way, our server was actually super good. It was the hostess and manager that are lacking. Don't recommend this place anymore. They just don't care."
Pilar K.,"Bonita, CA",6,103,,2.0,7/20/2016,"My husband and I decided to have lunch here on July 19 before noon.  It was empty and the hostess seated us one table away from a woman that was by herself.  Our order was taken and I excused myself to use the restroom.  When I returned there were two women seated next to us.  I thought that was odd since there were so many empty tables!  Then two more women were seated on the other side of about 5 minutes later.  Now this didn't make sense to me.  Why was the hostess seating people next to each other like sardines when the place was empty, that didn't make sense.  I could see her doing that if it were crowded!!  Other than that the food was delicious, and the service was adequate, but I feel since it was still early in the day and there weren't that many customers that the hostess could have done a better job of spacing the customers apart."
Bryant G.,"San Diego, CA",13,26,,1.0,10/1/2016,"I use to work for the cheesecake for almost ten years total and I am not sure how they lost the service standards. I use to train employees at our Seattle location and know our steps of service. we took pride to achieve all of the steps and provide excellent guest service. Since they no longer have secret shoppers maybe?  My experience was at the bar on a Wednesday night with a gentleman and a lady behind the bar. It was around 8pm and not exactly crazy busy. The guy bartender asked me what I wanted to drink after about a ten minute wait. Where is the minute check, no specials (fish), soup of the day, didn't mention his name, didn't offer bread (he said sure and came at the end of my meal), didn't offer water. I went ahead and ordered my appetizer. He then dropped the check in front of me and never did a two minute check back, never offered dessert or coffee. He didn't even mention the name on the card or tell me to have a nice evening. What a huge disappointment! There is no excuse for terrible service and definitely not at the Cheesecake Factory."
Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,4.0,10/1/2014,"This is a typical Cheesecake Factory, which means it's a good option. We got exactly what we expected here, and that's a gigantic menu, sparkling clean dining room, consistently prepared food, and great service.  Another plus to this particular CF is the super easy parking. The valet isn't worth the time or money, but anywhere else in the area, especially the meters on the side, are great. Oddly enough, we don't go here for the cheesecake. It's good, sure, but because we aren't frumpy, we generally will head down the way to get gelato elsewhere in that same shopping center."
Alisa R.,"Winchester, CA",2,130,25,2.0,3/29/2017,"Not the usual service or welcome that you usually get when you eat here.  We were sat in a section by ourselves (probably due to the fact that 1 of our parties was in a wheel chair, & we also had a baby with us).  Great, no complaints, nice & quiet.  It took our waitress Ashlee about 6 minutes to come over to us, probably because she was busy standing behind us chatting with 4 other servers.  We immediately felt like we were annoying her from the start....probably because we all ordered waters to start with, and I informed her that we were there for desserts only.  (It wasn't rush time either, it was about 4:15 when we arrived).  Asked for straws, didn't get them from her, finally had to get up & ask another employee for them.  We ordered the Korean Fried Cauliflower, which was very different, but tasty, as well as 3 cheesecakes, and a Tiramisu.  The cheesecakes were devoured, but the Tiramisu only had 1 bite out of it, and not once did Ashlee ask us if everything was ok.  She simply gave us the check and that was it.  The Tiramisu was ok, but not great.  Overall, the food & portions are well worth the visit, this particular server---not so much."
Jason D.,"San Diego, CA",12,211,56,4.0,10/29/2015,"Good mix of food, I would definatley recommend the skinny menu, good choice for low calories   Also they have a great happy hour from 4:00-6:00 M-F in which you can load up on bar food for $5.00 a plate, and drinks are very reasonable also. If your trying to lose weight I would skip the cheese cake although that is hard to do."
Samantha M.,"National City, CA",60,9,1,1.0,10/12/2016,Had a bad experience and was messaged that I should contact their service and let them know what happened. I contacted them 3 weeks ago and have yet to be called back... that's not helping at all cheesecake factory
Ken T.,"Grayslake, IL",3,106,,1.0,11/22/2015,"First we asked for a table outside and They said we have a table it will be Five minutes then another party walked In and the gave our table to that party. When we were seated the server came To the table and it was down hill from That point on. It was by far the worst Service we have ever had. The server Ignored is thru our our meal. I  It appears the restaurant does not Care about good service. Kthunholm"" The person that commented on my Review should first know the full story Before she opens her mouth."
Christine C.,"Aptos, CA",19,2,,1.0,4/6/2017,Had dinner here last night and was so disappointed.  Service is absolutely the worst!  If you want your food still frozen and a server who brings you your food and disappears go here.  When she finally came back  I told her about the parts of the food still being frozen she took it and  brought it back stating the manager said they come that way.  Nobody eats their food frozen!
JENNIFER V.,"Cypress, CA",45,16,,1.0,3/11/2017,Horrible service. Horrible uncooked food.  Party of two. Took 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by our waiter. Another 10 for drinks. Food.. ordered a burrito and a burger. Waitress brings burrito and says burger is coming right out. Another 15 minutes still no burger or even acknowledgement that my food will be coming even though the waitress passed by several times during the wait. By then the burrito that was brought out was obviously cold which turned out to be a good thing because it had uncooked chicken and rice and an almost rotten red sauce smothered all over it that was not listed as an ingredient on the menu. The burger was rare when I ordered it medium well and the cheese was not even melted. NO APOLOGY for it being served 15-20 minutes after the other persons food was brought out. They are lucky we had to hit the road for a very long car ride or I would have refused to pay the bill. We basically paid $40 for two diet cokes. Oh plus an extra $15 for valet which isn't their fault on the parking but we only went to seaport for Cheesecake Factory. Worst restaurant experience of my life. They literally got not ONE THING RIGHT!!
Maria P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,5.0,9/7/2016,Not sure why this place had such bad reviews. Our waiter today was Dustin J and he was awesome! Very quick and attentive. The food here is always good and fresh!
Kelly M.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,1.0,3/27/2017,"I have never had a worse customer service experience than with this Cheesecake Factory location. The staff is incredibly poorly trained and unprofessional. I love the food at Cheesecake Factory, but I will NEVER be back to this location."
Don F.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,57,4,3.0,2/17/2017,Lettuce Tacos are good and healthy!  Service was excellent at the Bar.  Perfect location
Leslie G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,23,13,5.0,8/6/2016,"My visit here was amazing! Matthew, our serving, was very attentive and anticipated our needs."
Sara S.,"Chicago, IL",1,62,1,4.0,3/17/2016,"Came here a few times for friends' birthday dinners.  The inside gets incredibly dark... I could barely see my menu at one point.  The food is always good! Drinks are well made.  I love their outdoor patio. Very cozy, and love the heat lamps, because it definitely gets cold once the sun goes down. Perfect location for people watching. Parking available in the lot. This location is always busy -- call ahead to make reservations!"
Ivonne M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,6,3,1.0,5/15/2016,"First I off I thought long and hard if I should of even taken the time to write this, but I read a review that was written 6 hours ago (I was there maybe 3 hours ago) and I have to agree with this person, the girl behind the counter was SO rude. Her name is Ana. My gosh, manners people! I totally understand that the place was crowded and there were lots of people she had to help but geez she had such an attitude. Will I stop coming here? No because they have delicious cheesecake. But will I go back and order at the counter, probably not. I wasn't expecting her to greet me and ask to hear about my day, but the way she took my order and proceeded to talk to me was unacceptable."
