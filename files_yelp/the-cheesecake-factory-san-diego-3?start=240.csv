Alison M.,"Temple Hills, MD",28,21,29,2.0,2/8/2015,Came in around 2:00  pm on a weekday. Slight 10 minute wait for outdoor table. Ordered  Pasta. Didn't really taste the way it was explained on Menu but we are it. Red sauce felt too watery. Ordered Shrimp sandwhich to go and asked for Avocado. When I got home.. No Cado :(.
stephanie m.,"Chula Vista, CA",55,9,6,5.0,5/8/2016,This was one of the best experiences I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to take my mom out for a nice super unplanned mothers day brunch. I walked in and was immediately seated. Our food was AMAZING but our waiter Cory made our visit a million times better!!! He was hilarious!!! Great sense of humor and of course great customer service!! I will for sure be coming back  Btw try the cheese caaake pleaaaseee!!!
Tweety B.,"Spring Valley, CA",20,84,6,3.0,7/25/2016,"Food is great, server was good , hostess sucked went out of my way to go there for husband birthday asked if they did anything for birthdays. She told me so I filled out the pink card and made a point to tell her which number meter I had since there was a wait .  Nothing ever happened for birthday when I left made it a point to mention to her what happened and she ignored me."
Fuad D.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Recently had dinner there. Service was horrible. The food was burnt. The waiter did. If check on us as she should have. We did not get any of our drinks refilled. It was my worst dinner experience. We had to call the waiter four times. My friend wanted an item from the menu that was sold out. He complained to the manager and the manager did not accommodate anything for us. The manager replied ""Its a popular item, when it's sold out its sold out."" Furthermore, I would rather go to the Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Valley, even though it's a long wait. The service is better there."
Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",120,851,1991,4.0,7/14/2015,"great patio dining area! this was the primary reason for our trip down here. came on a busy Thursday night on the 4th of July weekend. surprisingly fast turnover and we got seated in about 10mins, AT THE PATIO! mind you the weather was awesome so we were pretty impressed with how long it didn't take. food was standard Cheesecake fair. nothing outstanding. service was excellent, nonetheless. our server and busser were on top of everything. seating options at the patio were also nice. very homey and was perfect to look out and people watch. will most definitely come back here."
Lewis H.,"San Diego, CA",3,6,,1.0,7/22/2016,Stopped by to get food to-go while at the convention center. Staff seemed friendly but they forgot the fries we paid for that came with the sandwiches. We even paid extra for sweet potato fries. Not worth the$70 for 3 entrees and dessert if you can't even provide the food. Expect better for the price.
Shouka S.,"San Diego, CA",128,312,197,1.0,8/5/2015,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!  I came here for dinner after a long train ride hungry. I made it easy for the server and ordered our appetizer and entrees all at once. I usually order the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps from other locations and it's a perfect portion. I wish my phone wasn't dead so I could've taken a picture of theirs here. It was ALL crispy rice noodle. There was barely and chicken or mushroom and it was chopped up so finely, it was difficult to separate the good stuff from the rice noodles. Before our appetizer even arrived, we waited nearly 45 minutes until it arrived. If the restaurant was packed, I wouldn't have minded, but they weren't even busy. I looked around and I could see other tables looking around hangrily trying to hunt down our server, who was MIA the majority of the time. By the our appetizer came out, our server said our food would be out shortly. My boyfriend and I weren't even half way done with our appetizer and our entrees were out at our table.  Our server never came to ask how our food was, our drinks were empty for a long time before she came by to refill them, and she even took about 20 minutes to come back with our check. It didn't take long for her to drop off our check but it took her a long time to come back with our change. When we left, I looked at the restaurant and they were not busy. You would expect them to be fully packed with the ridiculously slow service we received."
Jessica B.,"San Diego, CA",40,117,91,3.0,12/3/2014,"Definitely kid friendly here.  I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  Pro is my kids never complain about wanting more because their portions are double the size of any other restaurant portions. Their food is always a hit here.  At this location, the service is horrible.  Their wait times are too long for seating.  The location is beautiful and they have loads of outdoor space.  Make sure you go with time on your hands because their hostess staff and waiters are very slow.   As an appetizer my favorite are the stuffed mushrooms and the ahi tower.  As a dish the shrimp scampi is delicious.  You can't miss with the chocolate cake tower and the strawberry shortcake for dessert. I like to bring my kids here, sit outside on the patio and enjoy San Diego's amazing weather."
Craig W.,"San Diego, CA",502,1129,650,5.0,7/8/2014,"Same great Happy Hour as the other locations. The knock on this location seems to be the spotty service and it's status as a chain. We had a new waitress who was a trainee. She was generally attentive but somewhat nervous and robotic, but unlike most Yelpers, I'm willing to give a hard working person a little slack. And, yes, it's a chain, with very good and very unhealthy food and drinks. It's a huge facility and very attractive. I'd return in a heartbeat for HH or dinner, if I ever feel like eating 2,500 calories at one sitting."
Jeff S.,"San Diego, CA",32,213,122,5.0,6/19/2015,"Ok, I still can't believe that The Cheesecake Factory is only getting an average 3 star review on Yelp.  Where are all of these people coming from who are giving less than stellar reviews?  I don't even know where to begin, the Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the greatest restaurants EVER!  They've got the biggest menu (by far) of any restaurant I've ever been to!  Want Kale?  Quinoa?  In the mood for Asian?  Italian?  Steaks?  Seafood?  Comfort Food?  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch?  Vegetarian?  Vegan?  Meat lover?  Drinks?  Desserts?  They've got it all covered, and they do it all right!   Food is always delicious, freshly prepared (nothing out of a can or frozen here).  Huge portions.  Reasonable prices.  3 kinds of freshly brewed iced tea.  Awesome, amazing bartenders (shout out to Heather, Nadine & Rudy)!  Oh, and they did an excellent job designing this place, very impressive, cloth napkins, even the silverware they use is top quality!   My favorite dishes here are the chicken nachos, miso salmon (best salmon I've ever had anywhere, I get this all the time here), Renee's special (soup and sandwich combo), Cajun chicken littles, chicken and biscuits, and their turkey burgers!  Love this place, started eating regularly at the CKF when they first opened in Fashion Valley, but this location is closer to me and always outstanding!"
Alfredo G.,"Austin, TX",104,53,68,5.0,7/19/2016,"Everything was good on this visit to cheesecake factory. We ordered as an appetizer a pear and blue cheese flat bread. It was perfectly done. Then, we got a spicy chicken chipotle pasta and the pasta was on point. Then, we got velvet cake cheesecake. I like the overall flavor, but the velvet cake part was squeezed. It was missing fluffiness. The service was great though, that's why I'm still rating this 5 stars."
Mike R.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,,5.0,2/11/2017,Adam G and the waiter before him gave us excellent service. Wasn't a fan of the double IPA and they replaced it with a Stella no problem. Don't normally Yelp (or complain about beer) but was very happy with how they handled it. Thanks.
Christina M.,"Anchorage, AK",42,75,329,3.0,4/13/2016,"It wasn't busy, service was great, but the crab-artichoke dip was not as good as we had it at a different cheese cake factory.  Overall, it was ok."
Carolina E.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,78,89,1.0,12/29/2016,My family and I decided to go to this location after the San Diego zoo. We expected a wait just like any other Cheesecake Factory got to this location and they said the wait was 1 hour so we waited. So after more than an hour passed we got seated yay we thought we will finally get to eat we placed our order. I had my two daughters and my niece all hungry and sleepy we waited for 1 hour before we even said hey where the hell is our food the waiter said well it's busy today okay so we spent two hours at this location and nothing we asked to speak to the manager and wala the food came out cold tasteless and honestly so disappointing my potatoes were cold and stale my daughters spaghetti was hard and looked like I have no idea what hard like they left it boiling for a long time my daughters burger was disgusting even my fiancé food was so bad. We told the manager and she offered to have it all re made so why the hell would I spend another hour waiting for food. Honestly if you're going to have your customers wait for so long for food make sure it's good. I been to so many cheesecake factories and never have I asked can we just leave. After the manager saw our food she said yes we can leave without any issues she offered to box the disgusting food for us and charge us for it no thank you I would not want that even if it was free. This completely ruined our night ended going to McDonald's this is my honest review for my visit to this location not all cheesecake factories are like this one. At the end we left hungry spent a bit more than 2 hours at this location with no one checking up on us until we said something.
Michelle D.,"Riverview, FL",16,114,20,1.0,6/28/2016,Definitely below par!  Food if prepared correct taste good.  It may take more than twice.  Service below par as in rude.  After speaking with the manager I understand why this restaurant is below standards.  I expect good if not great food and service like any other Cheesecake Factory.  I read the reviews and thought by chance they weren't accurate.  This is not your average chain.  I'm opting for local next time.  It has to be better than this experience was.
Frank C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,13,,2.0,1/28/2017,"We have been going to Cheesecake Factory for years, and it has, to my recollection, always been a good experience... Good food, decent prices, good service and very interesting decor. With this location, we have had good experiences overall, but I think they are slipping. I think corporate needs to send in an emergency management team to get this location back into line. Our food took 45 minutes to arrive and looking around it seemed like others were having the same problem.  This location is very busy because  its close to the convention center, to Seaport Village and surrounding hotels. It if you are going to operate at this location, Special Forces need to get this place back in line it will hurt your brand."
erika s.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,11,6,1.0,7/3/2016,They repeated the order on the phone and at the restaurant but when I brought the food home my child's beef sliders were chicken sliders with NO fries.
Frida Sofia R.,"San Diego, CA",258,117,87,4.0,7/2/2014,"Specifically because of the fact that there is even a happy hour in this specific CCF I believe they deserve four stars! The service is always great, I never had to complain about anything. Happy hour is great, good prices, great amount of food, and choices! I love how this one is never as crowded as the one in Fashion Valley. I adore the fact that I can literally walk there from home. Anywho, I do wish they had more drinks listed in the happy hour menu, but at least the mojito was decently big, for 5 dollars! If you go for happy hour, Buffalo Blasts, man! The flavors will just make you explode from the deliciousness! Tried the S'mores Cheesecake, I felt like I was in a campfire each moment I took a bite, absolutely fantastic! Oh and take out is very fast, so convenient if its too full."
Francesca H.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,6,4,4.0,7/10/2016,I've been here a few times and I really do enjoy it every time. There's such a large selection of food to choose from. I enjoy this location especially for their patio seating at night. As far as their service it's ok but can't complain too much because I'm usually seated fairly quickly.
Keith W.,"San Diego, CA",14,75,43,1.0,4/1/2016,"Waited 45+ minutes for 4/5 dishes ordered. The 5th came 10 minutes after everyone else had already received their food. Everyone could tell their dish had waited under a heat lamp (most likely waiting for the last dish?) multiple managers apologized for the food being late. One of them, George, got an attitude with me because I was unhappy with the lack of compensation they provided on the original check after promising us they would ""take care of"" multiple dishes/dessert. Guy has no business being in food service if he can't handle me being upset about what happened. Not coming back to a place that can't get the basic customer SERVICE piece down."
