Natalie N.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2016,The worst experience ever!! Do not go here if you have a large party! The manager is an idiot who tried to blame us for not telling him how to do his job! I will never step foot here again! We waited for 2 hours and I was so upset I had to leave! Mind my children waited the 2 hours for nothing as well! I would give no stars if a I could! Such a big beautiful restaurant but ridiculous how a big party can't make a reservation and be set aside for smaller groups!
Kevin C.,"Modesto, CA",261,400,68,4.0,10/20/2014,"Im always a fan of the Cheese cake factories Great outdoor seating fast service food was great, server was a little off but thats ok its a little touristy area so i expect that."
Aliya A.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/6/2017,"I re-downloaded this app just so I could leave this review. A friend and I came in tonight at about 10, didn't look too busy. Stood by the hostess stand for a solid 10 minutes, while multiple servers walked by without even looking our way. A line had even begun to form behind us. We didn't receive a nod of recognition, an apology or anything. I didn't feel comfortable spending my hard earned money at an establishment with such poor service. So we went across the street to Kansas City BBQ and had some of the best BBQ, best beer, and best service I've had in a long while. Busy (y'all weren't busy) or not~ train your employees to acknowledge guests."
Heather M.,"San Diego, CA",4,36,14,1.0,8/2/2015,"My family and I were strolling around Seaport village when we noticed that their was a new cheesecake factory. We decided to stop in for a ""quick"" bite, little did I know that their was a 30 minute wait to eat at this dump! When we were seated, the waitress took 30 minutes just to take our order. I ordered the the skinnylicious asian chicken salad and my husband ordered  the chicken  bellagio. It took and 45 to get our food, when I received my salad it was completely  dry! It looked like rabbit food! I quickly asked the waitress  to return  and cancel my order.  As for the chicken  bellagio, it might as well be called, ""chicken with grease"" I can't believe people actually wait in line to eat at this one star restaurant.  Never again will I return! here!"
Bob M.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,3,,5.0,4/4/2016,Terrible. As in its really bad. Food aren't good. It smells very bad. And it looks weird.
Amy R.,"San Diego, CA",87,117,130,3.0,5/31/2016,"Came here as a party of 4. The location is convenient and pretty central. Right by the water, stores, and nestled outside of the Gas Lamp District. Our wait time wasn't bad considering it was Friday night. The patio was warm with fire/heat lamps. The waitress was just OK. Not personable and slow. Two of the entrees came out, 5 minutes later she comes over and goes you didn't get your fried cheese (the app we ordered that never came)? We said no, and the other 2 people haven't gotten their food. She didn't seem to concerned about our food but came right back with the fried cheese. She went to set it down and stopped herself stating ""do you still want it or I can take it off your check sine your already eating"". We were like, I guess we will take it?!? About 3-5 minutes later the other two entrees came. They also never brought a sling for my friend to set her baby carrier in, which they said they were going to bring one when we first set down. She kept filling our drinks up with Root Beer instead of Coke but ran off before we had time to tell her. The dining experience was kind of long, but the food was pretty good."
Anaheeta K.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/30/2016,"Cheesecake is a great restaurant and you can certainly find something you will like.  The only problem is they don't have a dog-friendly patio, even if the dog is on-leash.   Funny thing, we went to the Cheesecake Factory in Otay Ranch and they allowed our dog.  The staff even came out to pet him as he was a puppy at that time, but a good 25 lbs.  I guess each Cheesecake has it's own set of rules."
Melanie V.,"Mesilla Park, NM",15,10,2,5.0,6/26/2015,We  would definitely give this the highest score !  There was no waiting on Friday at noon and we were given exceptional service!  The food was awesome - angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken and the other order was chicken Alfredo with scampi sauce !  The desserts we ordered were lemon meringue and strawberry cheese  cake and they went well with freshly brewed coffee. We can't leave out the bread - honey wheat !!  Sweet waitress too !  Now we can walk off the food as we stroll Sea Port Village.
Deana M.,"San Diego, CA",26,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,wait was way too long. got here at 5 waited two hours and they told us the table we would be at and they had us sit outside after they gave our table away. it's cold. like no thanks . and my food was undercooked and not that great. sorry one star from me!
Arthur N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,35,13,1.0,6/15/2015,"Disappointed with the service . 20 minutes after being seated in a restaurant not nearly half full, I was introduced to my waitress and ordered a water. 20 minutes after the water, the food showed up.  Sorry, CKF - Not good enough for lunch."
Mariam S.,"San Diego, CA",60,3,1,3.0,6/14/2016,I usually go to cheesecake in fashion valley and I am satisfied most of the time but I went to this one for the first time and ended up having 3 hairs in my food. Hair was in the chicken and sauce/dip. I was starving and it ruined my appetite. The lady still tried to charge us for the items even after showing her where the hairs where. The manager there was very kind and told us he was sorry and didn't make us pay for the food.
Jennifer M.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",45,17,5,5.0,10/10/2015,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory numerous times. And in several different cities. This by far has been my best experience, with THE BEST customer service. It was the most enjoyable visit.  Although we had a few minor mishaps during our dinner, both the waiter and the manager were kind and fair during our meal. Afterward, when we wanted to order dessert we had a huge surprise!  The manager went above and beyond what we could ask for when a part of our meal came late and one dish was unsatisfactory. He comped many items and was sincere when he spoke to our table. He made us feel like important and valued customers and I couldn't have asked for better service.  I would highly recommend this particular location and I have told all of my friends go visit here if they want to dine in  seaport village.  Thank you for making our dinner wonderful!"
Joe M.,"San Diego, CA",99,382,56,4.0,8/18/2015,"It's always fun to go down town. This place is located in the former police station of San Diego. Great place, super busy. My Salmon Salad was great. Thanks guys."
James A.,"San Diego, CA",20,4,,1.0,6/1/2015,"I ate at the cheesecake factory today. We sat on the patio, the hostess turned the volume down like we had requested which was really nice. We ordered a drink and the avacado egg rolls as an appetizer which was really good.  Then I ordered the salmon and steak combination plate. After a few bites I discovered a hair on the steak. I politely pointed it out that I had discovered the hair in my food and sent the plate back. The waiter was polite and asked if he could replace the dish or a desert which I was completely uninterested in.  Later the manager came over which was appreciated and I continued to be polite expecting him to inform me of what the restaurant would do to make up the mistake which never happened. When I checked the bill I was unhappy to see that over the course of the meal I (and my female friend) spent $70.00 to have an unsanitary dish served to me. I have been in the food and beverage industry my entire life, I am not giving a 1 star rating because of the hair in the food. I understand accidents happen. My issue is with management for not even making an attempt to correct the disgusting misunderstanding. Paying for alcohol is one thing but charging for food after finding a hair in your dish is unacceptable. I will not be eating at a cheesecake factory again and I hope people reading follow in my boycott."
Julie W.,"El Cajon, CA",19,40,30,1.0,4/1/2016,"Alright, let me start off by saying I love Cheesecake Factory. Great food great service and all, but.....BUT, this one was just horrible. First things first this place is in a great location at seaport village and the patio is great especially summer nights. Here is where the real problem is, the service is absolutely horrible. Came here for a birthday dinner, 5 people total. Got seated quickly even though it was 6:30pm on a Friday evening. Hostess said ""oh yeah for some reason we aren't busy today"" alright.  Then put our drink orders in. Took an extra minute or two to order our food. Ordered all of our food and then waiting. The waiter came back after 10 minutes white chicken chili was ""out of stock""? Hmmm okay? We'll order something simple chicken Alfredo. Okay.... 45 minutes went by, manager comes over apologizes for the wait says our meals will be out in ""3"" minutes. 10 more minutes pass by our food comes,with the plates scorching hot as if they were under the plate warmers for a while. All meals came but one, chicken Alfredo. Mind you this is what the birthday girl ordered. So we waited for her food to come so we could dig in. 2 minutes pass then 5 and birthday girl told us don't wait for her just eat, we started eating. 10 minutes, the manager comes apologizes gives us the whole ""this is worst case scenario sorry for having you watch everyone eat..."" With no Alfredo in his hand. This guy serious? Dude we just want our food. 10 minutes later... Hooray here comes the Alfredo!  While the rest of us is half way done with our plates. Not looking good. So manager George comes over and says cheesecakes and Couple of meals are comped. At this point we were just fed up. Ordered our 4 cheesecakes to go because we have been there for almost 2 hours now and just wanted to LEAVE. Then the check came. Okay, look here, we don't care about price or money, they said ""we will comp a couple of meals and all dessert"" so it's all about the principle do what you say say what you do right? We get the check only two cheesecakes were taken off and the Alfredo, not the birthday girls drink mind you that (Shirley temple).  Ummm okay we proceeded to tell the waitress the manager said he would comp the desserts and a couple of meals she said oh of course let me take care of that for you. The manager comes back (with an attitude) ""alright what's wrong with your check?"" We told him you said you would take care of some things and he said yeah I comped all of your dessert see here on the receipt? Lol at this point my husband got fired up. The receipt was new and all the desserts were comped, my husband told him this is a different receipt and called him out. The manager George started to become confrontational and asked ""well what else do you want me to do?"" We shouldn't have to ask, things need to just get taken care of, the last thing we want is a manager being an ahole for something that was their fault, second you tried to lie and slip in a new receipt saying here I took care of it in the first place why are you not happy? The first receipt did not have what you said and now you come back with an attitude and a new one almost calling us liars??? Wtf? Uh no we saw what we saw and you tried to play it off as we wouldn't notice. Also, asking us what else we want? No, we are not like those annoying customers who find any reason to get a free meal so we won't ask for more, you need to offer it. He didn't offer it snatched our receipt and then we paid our dues.  We were there from 6:30pm to 8:50pm. Waited for our food for an hour and 15 minutes and just too much drama. The other reviewers are right service is horrible probably one of the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. I'm sad about this because the location and ambiance is great but service is horrible with bad management and food is subpar. No thanks I'll take my money to Puesto next door."
Paige B.,"San Diego, CA",121,12,22,2.0,12/21/2016,"Ravi our waiter was good but the bread plates were dirty. I told the waiter who brought our food (didn't catch his name)  took them and agreed. He said he would bring more plates and he never did. My friend's spaghetti was salty! I thought he was being picky but I tasted it and was very salty. My pasta was good. My friend's drink had strawberry seeds in it but he got a Sprite. It got so bad that we stopped sending things back. We didn't want to keep complaining. The dessert was great though! If you are going to go, go to the one in Fashion Valley!"
Jacqueline F.,"San Diego, CA",92,41,119,4.0,3/13/2016,"I went to this location yesterday afternoon, it's at a prime tourist spot in downtown SD so we made reservations. My party was seated promptly in a back corner table and we were eager to eat.  Once we ordered our drinks we looked at the EXTENSIVE menus. I felt like Gordon Ramsey on his restaurant makeover show because he would not approve of the endless pages and options. They even had a separate 'skinnylicious' menu for those that wanted a healthier alternative. There was also a nutritional guide that listed every item on the menu, I get it, but it's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY after all. After seeing that some entrees were over 2100 calories, I realized I would make it my cheat day.  I ordered the fried shrimp sandwich with no tomato and fries. The sauce that it was served with was nice since the sandwich lacked flavor or any type of intensity in heat. Oh, and it came with tomatoes.  My mom ordered a medium Caesar salad. I can honestly say I'm glad she didn't get a large, even though she thoroughly enjoyed it, it was the biggest salad we have ever seen in our lives. The portions are huge here.  Others in my party ordered the beet salad, salmon, a burger, and my toddler got the kids meal chicken strips with fruit.  Her strips lacked flavor but she ate them, since she is a toddler, wouldn't recommend an adult ordering them as they would be disappointed. Her 'fruit cup' was diced into teeny tiny bite sized pieces, I wish I would've taken a pic, the fruit was so small that she could barely pick em up and that ended up being a fail.  The cheesecake though.. The cheesecake was an epic success. We ordered the red velvet, key lime, Oreo Dream, and the lemon raspberry cream editions. They were heavenly to say the least. We left around 7 pm and the front area was packed with guests waiting to be seated. I highly recommend getting a reservation as they do get crowded on the weekends.  I will definitely come back just for the cheesecake."
Robert D.,"National City, CA",38,8,53,4.0,1/2/2016,Great food! Great feel! Great service! Awesome place! It hits the mark of a good dessert place because of the wonderful ambience and location.
Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",811,680,1769,5.0,2/10/2014,"Yikes! Two Cheesecake Factory reviews in the span of two weeks. I'm officially a fan, I guess.  {don't judge).  This time, I visited the new Cheesecake Factory that opened up at The Headquarters, the new shopping/dining center right off of Harbor Drive and Kettner Blvd. I love its convenience because it's within a doable walking distance from my building. My dining companion and I dropped in here on Sunday night and secured a table within a matter of minutes. I'm not going to be as detailed as I was in my previous CF review, but I was equally pleased with my selections this time around. I had the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with french fries. The bread was fresh and pliable, the spicy sauce gave it just enough heat so as not to be overwhelming, and the chicken breast had a delicious marinade and seasoning. Very pleasing. This time, I wasn't going to leave without dessert. I chose the Banana Cream Cheesecake. The cheesecake came adorned with fresh slices of banana and a generous amount of whipped cream. The texture was light and fluffy, and it tasted like a decadent banana pudding, but in cheesecake form. I swooned in delight.  I fear The Cheesecake Factory will be quickly transforming into a new personal obsession."
Kara M.,"Merced, CA",0,10,,2.0,12/13/2016,"Food was ok, but my server was a condescending jerk. Switched tables and the next server was super sweet. Obviously the place has serious management issues - the manager couldn't even be bothered to stop by after I complained."
