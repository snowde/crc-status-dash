CK B.,"Lake Forest, CA",152,76,6,2.0,5/1/2016,"I was so ready to give this location a 5 star review just based on our customer relations experience,  but then... we got our order. :/ My husband and I ordered take-out and apparently my ""no cilantro"" instructions didn't quite make it to the food preparer. It was obvious that cilantro had been topped on my fish tacos originally, and then scraped away before serving it to me. There were still little trace pieces all over ... which just sucks. Then my husband payed extra for his side of fries to be substituted for sweet potato fries. We realized we were missing the fries altogether when we got home!! Super sad. We had even asked for extra ketchup for them before we left, ha!"
Courtney W.,"San Diego, CA",71,52,29,5.0,4/11/2014,"Cheese Cake Factory is the perfect place if you are looking to wine and dine someone without breaking the bank. It has all the ambiance of a 5 star restaurant without the heart attack when the check comes.  Our server, Ammiee, was great! She recommended the smores cheesecake when we couldn't decide and it was clutch!  There is food for any craving you might have.  There is no free parking in the area so just a heads up there! Cheesecake Factory does validate so its $3 for the first two hours and $3 every half hour thereafter. Very pleased with this dining experience :)"
Lila P.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,60,79,3.0,11/25/2016,"This is the first checking in on Yelp, but third eating at this slow, slow service location. It was my grandsons request because he wanted cheesecake as dessert.  The first time we came was on opening day, and it was horrible! Today wasn't any better. Service was super slow, and it wasn't really busy. The burgers were great, the angel shrimp pasta, ok, average meal for A pricey meal."
Kevin M.,"Carlsbad, CA",135,7,5,2.0,1/30/2015,"First things first, if you get Ashley as your server, immediately ask for a new one. I was really excited to come here because the first time I went to CF it was an amazing experience; I had great service and everything was on point, then again it was not at this location. When it came time to take our order Ashley didn't seem too happy to be there. Not only did she roll her eyes to one of my friends, but she strongly corrected my best friend on the pronunciation of one of the steak dishes. I understand coming in 20 minutes before closing isn't the best, but growing up in the restaurant business, and having well over 10 years of experience, every customer should be served the same even if it's a minute before closing. We started off with a couple mojitos (props to the bartender for those, they were excellent) and a water for our DD. No refill was offered on the water. We had to ask twice for our bread because she had forgot the first time (the place was dead, I don't understand how she would forget; it's routine to serve bread and refill the water). When our food came out she didn't even seem to know if my shrimp was the correct size. I had to order a different steak because they were out of the fillet minion and on top of that, my entire dish was at room temperature. When I let her know about my cold plate she asked me what she wanted me to have her do about it, and offered to warm it up... Umm, how about offer a fresh off the grill plate?!  Honestly, I don't think Ashley should be working at a restaurant where high expectations are set, because of what she did provide of the service was not great at all. We didn't think twice about tipping. The manager came out and asked if everything was okay, I let him know what happened and he took care of my plate along with the shrimp. I wasn't trying to get my plate taken care of, but every other worker that was there spoke to us with such great tone of voice and excitement. I hope this will never happen again because my first visit to CF still holds a 5 star rating."
Ashley H.,"Castaic, CA",2,29,,1.0,6/11/2015,"No wait which was nice and after eating here I know why, customer service sucks!!!! I have been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and this is by far the worst in customer service and food. I know all locations have the same menu but the food was not good at this location. I ordered a California omelette and substituted the mushrooms for asparagus. The dish came out and the potatoes were overcooked and not really edible and when I tried to cut through my omelette, I couldn't cut through the asparagus. The BBQ pizza was no good, not worth eating or taking home. Our waitress only checked on us once, she was supposed to bring us a refill and it never came. Of course when the check came she was quick to get that out. I wanted to ask for a manager but didn't have enough time to wait for him/her.  I will NOT be back to this location and would not recommend it to anyone......unless I don't like that person Almost forgot***bathrooms were disgusting, trash overflowed to the floor and food on the floor. It was so bad that I had to take my 2 month old to my car to change him. Terrible!"
Kait O.,"Wenatchee, WA",60,3,,2.0,12/28/2016,"I have to say, we were so looking forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory, and had it not been for the staff we would have left.  Twice our food or appetizer showed up with hair in it.   In addition, though it was about 830p, when we placed our order, we were then told they were out of French Fries as well as Peanut Sauce for the meals and appetizer.   We can imagine running out of peanut sauce but French Fries?  Really,  then to have a expensive meal and the side of bread show up with hair in it makes me wonder what the heck???   Thank god for our waitress, she would be the reason we would return and give it another try."
Isaac B.,"Tallahassee, FL",15,53,96,3.0,7/29/2015,"- The host was nice and courteous. - The waitress was terrible.  She left our table unattended for a LONG time, before we could order.  She refused to divide the checks more than three ways.  When someone in our group told her how we needed them divided (in three ways), she again emphasized she would only do it three ways and not seven.  If she was listening, she would have heard exactly how we needed them divided, into the three ways she had already offered to do.  Out of courtesy she got a decent tip, but she doesn't need to handle a large group again. - The portions were huge. - The outside seating was great. - The location couldn't have been better."
SoCal C.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,59,2,2.0,9/17/2016,"Very disappointing quality; family gathering Friday night, so yes, it was busy.  However, the low rating is due to the poor quality of the ingredients in my wife's beef dip sandwich.  The meat was so fatty and full of gristle that she had to eat it open face after carving the meat!  I would have hoped for better than cast-off meat from Wal-Mart at CF prices.  Suffice it to say no one in my family will return."
Gloria E.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,15,6,2.0,9/27/2015,"Unfortunately, this wasn't the best experience I've had. I was told there was no waiting to sit out on the patio and waited 25 minutes to be seated. The hostess that sat me appeared to have just rolled out of bed and smelled of booze.  My server was great but everyone around me had terrible service and all I heard was complaints."
Erika L.,"Normal Heights, San Diego, CA",23,76,145,3.0,4/15/2015,"The food is good but nothing special really. I think you can find anything like this anywhere else and maybe better. The best part it's dessert so I would just go for that. Their menu is soooooo big and ehh it's not worth it. This specific place was okay, the wait was long and the lights were sooo dimmed it hurt everyone's eyes because you had to focus well enough for your eyes to adjust. I don't think I will be going back for awhile."
Frank S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,,1.0,12/21/2016,Wow!  I ordered the sliders without ketchup and when I got them of course they had ketchup on them. The bartender reordered them and this time they were loaded with ketchup!  Will never go back to this location again!
Joseph N.,"El Cajon, CA",4,71,25,5.0,2/12/2014,"I've never really had a bad meal from the Cheesecake Factory. Even went to the one in Atlanta Georgia when I was out visiting family. Went last night and enjoyed the classic cheeseburger.  The only thing I recommend is to add cheddar and bacon with a side of 1000 Island! Best burger you will ever eat. I'm not kidding! I prefer the classic from here over Hodads, Rockys in PB and even In and Out....okay lets not get crazy. In and Out is neck and neck. Overall, very impressed with the new location."
Joshua R.,"Yuma, AZ",72,6,1,2.0,12/18/2016,"This place was crazy packed which is understandable , we ordered our food no issue , then the manager comes out and says every one else in our parties food was done except mine it was going to take longer .. no problem it happens .. about 10 to 15 mins later I get my food .. cold like it was sitting around .. overly salty and looking nothing like how i have had it before .. F for plate presentation .. i bite into it it doesn't taste right .. take another i taste that it is overly salty .. I have my wife try a bite she immediately spits it out says send it back since I am on a low sodium diet .. I have to wait another 10 mins or so for the manager to waiter to walk by , then another 10 mins for a manager and he offers to take it off the tab and make things right .. no problem he asked if I wanted another meal I said no he asked if we were ordering anything else I said yes desert .. he said ok we will get it taken care of .. assuming maybe I would get desert comped or something .... NOPE .. my server said the manager was going to bring us our bill and come talk to me .. nope I get handed the bill where the meal was taken off but no comp on the desert .. I don't want anything for free that's not what I am complaining about I think after spending $100 on a meal for my family where I didn't even get to enjoy it 15 bucks in cheese cake comped would have been acceptable .. I will never eat at this location again ... I'm lying I probably will since it's in a nice location just not happy with the poor customer relations from the manager"
Malcolm J.,"Arlington, VA",5,187,18,3.0,7/31/2015,"Went for HH on National Cheesecake day 30July15 Madhouse (should have known), but the service was still pleasant and prompt.  Nice work CcF. **HH Pricing** Avocado Eggrolls ($5.50): good portion, quality avocado, well cooked, good dipping sauce. Pretty much exactly what you would expect.  Just not enough other textures for my taste, I think it would have been much better with some corn in there. Roadside Sliders ($5.50): meh, nothing interesting or noteworthy.  very skip-able imho Chicken Pot Stickers ($5.50): well cooked, but they had these tiny ground chicken-like balls inside and they were swimming in a sauce with waaaay too much garlic for my taste.  I won't order these again. Fried Chicken Sliders ($5.50): 4 decent sized sliders, definitely a good value at HH price.  light, crispy, with a reasonable sized piece of chicken under that batter.  Not bad, just a little bland in the favor department. I might get this again when i'm in the mood for something fried.  Skinny Cosmo ($5.50): fair price and it must have been pretty good because BGH had 2 of them. Stella ($4): good price"
Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,4.0,12/14/2013,"I have never experienced a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory, and today's visit was not any different. I was very hungry because I had not had breakfast, so I ordered a sausage and ricotta flat bread for $6.50 and their Turkey Burger for $9.95, both of their Skinnyliscious menu.  The flat bread offering, although small,  was quite tasty and delicious. ( ) The ricotta fluffy piles of creamy and smooth goodness with great flavor. ( ) The sausage was tender and well seasoned, but it would of been nice if it had a well developed fennel flavor. ( ) I enjoyed the garlic crumbs, and herbs that were sprinkled on top. Nice touch. The flat bread was ultra thin, but firm and crispy and enough to hold up to the ingredients, ( ) but please make it a little bigger. My grilled turkey burger came with a side salad, in lieu of fries. My choice. ( ) The turkey burger was very good, one of the better ones I have had. It came with a pile of tender sauteed onions on top ( ) and a flavorful garlic mayonnaise with bits of parsley, which I spread on a golden toasted buttered bun. ( ) The mayo was good, but the star was the turkey grilled patty. The patty was mixed with Fresh Mushrooms, Garlic and Spices and then sprinkled with coarse black pepper. The results was a great flavored and a juicy patty, helped along by the high moisture content mushrooms carry. ( ) A smart preparation if you ask me. The sesame bun was moist and a little sweet. It was well toasted and a good vessel for the turkey burger. ( ) The tomato slices were fresh, and they gave me chopped lettuce instead lettuce leaves. I enjoyed the burger very much. My server Niya was great. Her service was appropriately timed and very friendly. At the time, I was to full to even consider ordering a slice of cheesecake to go, but now I am hungry and regretting my decision. The place provides plenty of seating inside and out."
Sergio C.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",198,8,4,5.0,5/6/2014,"Came in here last Sunday for dinner with my lady, brother and mom for an early Mother's Day dinner. Let me break down my visit. Service: GREAT. Our server was very nice and knowledgable about the ingridients in food, and on the cocktails/ beer selection. Very attentive and always had a smile on her face even though she had 4 other tables. My only regret was not getting her name to give her a shout out. food: we started with a few appetizers. The buffalo wings, tamales, text Mexican rolls. All of which was amazing. We shared a steak with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and the fries that came with the steak. Ordered the red velvet dessert, and pecan cheesecake (only course I was able to take a picture of). All in all: service was great, food was excellent, and dessert well, take a look for yourselves. I will be coming again."
Tiffanie A.,"Los Gatos, CA",89,194,265,5.0,6/22/2015,"I had an excellent experience here. I wish I took pics of the inside and the patio, it was different from the robotically same old Cheesecake Factory decor. The inside had cool swirly long lanterns lining the ceiling and the patio had a really nice set up with a long fire place decor thing, can't really explain it in words. It was nice to see something different at the Cheesecake Factory. Also, for the first time EVER, my bfs family and I got seated RIGHT AWAY with out one second for a wait, during dinner time, but the place was still full of ppl seated!  The service was good. I always get the chicken bellagio now and it was the best at this location. I wish all cheesecake factories were like this one"
Charlene M.,"San Diego, CA",68,13,29,3.0,2/15/2014,"Let me just start off by saying that The Cheesecake Factory is one of my all-time favorite restaurants! No matter what state or city I visit, if I'm near a ""Factory"" I dine there.  So I was exceedingly happy to find that I was lodging across the street from one during my stay. I dined the first night and vowed I would not eat there another night because I was terribly disappointed in the food (it was awfulx2).  I went back the second time out of convenience & hungry children and was SOOO SATISFIED!! My dinner was 1000x BETTER!! It reminded me of why I love the Factory!"
Meagan M.,"Temecula, CA",0,27,2,5.0,12/14/2016,Service was excellent. We went there after looking at lights.She was so helpful and was chatting with my kiddo and she even started to sing
Alberto B.,"Chula Vista, CA",172,1,,4.0,11/15/2015,"Honestly, this place had great food and amazing service. Only problem was that i was seated next to the bathroom. lol  Mashed potatoes were spot on and so was the amazingly tender chiken.   Had the toast and s'mores cheesecake. Super strong chocolate but the marshmallow part killed it."
