Dane H.,"Sulphur, LA",5,11,1,2.0,9/1/2015,"The ""ribeye"" tasted more like a skirt steak, very thin and fatty. Plus there was so much pepper you could barely taste the steak. The cheesecake is obviously the main draw and was good, but I would not go back. Just not a very good meal for the price you pay. Drink: water Entree: ribeye meal Dessert: tuxedo cheesecake Price with tip: $44"
Sunny D.,"La Puente, CA",116,215,982,4.0,6/20/2015,"The service was good we were sat down quickly I ordered the Kobe beef burger and wow I underestimated this one. It was delicious sautéed onions , mushrooms. This is my new go too meal here. Sweet potato fries were great also. But the Kobe beef burger was the high light."
Lisa N.,"San Diego, CA",265,255,163,3.0,4/4/2015,"This place was okay, the only cool part was the outdoor patio. The staff wasn't as nice and chipper as the one in Fashion Valley, which is fine. But geez learn to smile a little? Everyone looked so serious, no customer - server interaction. It was basically just like Hey here's water, okay figure our what you're going to order and I'll come back. Don't check how you're doing, don't recommend any dishes or anything, that's fine I suppose.  On to the food, my dish (Louisiana chicken pasta) was okay until you started eating the rest and realized that the consistency of the pasta was off. Some was perfectly cooked, others was on the harder side. It wasn't appetizing after awhile. I ate what was important and it was the breaded chicken. That was the best part of the dish. I tried forcing more down, but that wasn't happening. All in all, it was alright. I probably wouldn't come back here. I just wanted to try it out, because it was the newest location, but my experience fell short. So no, i'll pass."

Elvin D.,"San Diego, CA",121,157,581,3.0,3/27/2014,"Came here on a Sunday for a birthday dinner with a party of 13. This place is really new in a little center called The Headquarters (it's next to Seaport Village)  To make a long story short: Pros          1) new clean restaurant           2) great location           3) food was tasty           4) outdoor dining looks awesome compared to other Cheesecake locations with its multiple fire places thingys going on inside a glass case         5) it's across from Dunkin Donuts Cons          1) Waitress gave us 3 baskets off hard bread that she just tried to warm up ( cause you know you want that sweet soft brown bread with melting butter in yo mouth!!!)         2) Slow service as always, took like 45min -1 hour for our food         3) Parking sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Conclusion I would come here again, I give this place a 3.5"
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",480,1448,1175,3.0,5/6/2015,"Sometimes I like going to chain restaurants. I always pretend to not like chains but I secretly enjoy the cheesecakes at the Cheesecake Factory. This restaurant was right next to my hotel so I couldn't help myself from coming here. The floors are slippery by the way, I was wearing 4 inch heels and almost slipped. The portions here are huge, perfect if you are hungry.  I love the bread basket. One of the breads looks like its made of whole wheat, yet is sweet with a slight taste of honey and oats. I could eat that for days. There is a healthy menu but I opted for the non-healthy menu. I had the jambalaya which came with rice. The jambalaya had a nice spicy kick to it. MMMM.  Of course I was full after eating all that food, but I still had a slice of red velvet cheesecake. Layers of red velvet combined with some amazing cheesecake, what more can you ask for? I was in a food coma after that but it was worth it."
Greg D.,"San Diego, CA",119,16,12,4.0,3/18/2015,"The wife and I ate at the cheesecake factory to ight and it was good food, good setting, but our server Richard was excellent he really made the experience. He was attentive but not pushy, never let us run out of anything  and was very personable. Food is usually good here but Richard gave us an experience and made us feel like we were his most important table."
Lisa H.,"Seattle, WA",236,192,44,4.0,12/7/2013,"Had a great time here with my gal Shanel S.! The service was awesome and the food was DELICIOUS! The only thing I hate about Cheesecake Factory is the hostess stand. Even when it's not that crowded, it gets really congested with people waiting to be seated and people ordering to-go from the bakery. It took a whole for the hostesses to figure out what was going on, but that was the only downside of the visit. I got great service while waiting for Shanel S. to get off work, being offered bread and butter and having my drink refilled promptly. Once Shanel showed up, the waitress came right over and took our order. The food came out GREAT and the service was prompt throughout. Definitely will return!"
Donna S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",16,3,1,3.0,4/11/2016,What I really dislike about he establishment is that the silverware was dirty and place on a dirty table
Bianca S.,"El Cajon, CA",4,20,15,5.0,10/23/2016,My first time coming to this location was a great experience! It was busy yet the wait surprisingly took less than 10 minutes! Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Our waitress was the sweetest and was always making sure everything was spot on! I loved coming here and prefer this Cheesecake Factory over the one in mission valley.
Amber E.,"San Diego, CA",686,1475,2306,4.0,12/10/2013,"So, the new Cheesecake Factory by Seaport Village has now been open for 2 weeks (located in the old police station), and just had the chance to come check it out. My favorite Cheesecake Factory experience has to be the first one I visited in college many years ago in Marina Del Rey, right on the marina - great view, fun atmosphere, generous portions.  This one is at least closer to that atmosphere than the Mission Valley one -- right in Seaport Village, w/ plenty of paths to walk off the meal you just ate and enjoy the view.  No surprises; the same menu, and similar feel you'd expect from a chain CF.  But I did appreciate the Skinnylicious menu, which I guess has been around for awhile -- lots of options under 590 calories or less (not too skinny, but better than the alternatives), and cocktails for 150 calories or less.  I tried the Tuscan Chicken from the Skinnylicious menu, and it was surprisingly great - generous portion, lots of flavor - tomatoes, capers and articokes, over just a touch of farro.  My friend had the lemon shrimp w/ angel hair pasta (also from the Skinnylicious menu) and said it was really good, too.  The cheesecakes, of course, are wonderful, and tempting, but passed on them by this time.   Parking: is either valet, or park at Seaport Village and they do a partial validation (it cost us $3 to park for lunch).  A welcome addition to the downtown/Seaport Village scene."
Rico S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,79,29,5.0,10/7/2015,Food is always great! I Love to eat here because of the huge variety on the menu. Service is fantastic especially at the bar. Richard the Manager is very helpful and nice with customers.  Salads are always fresh and delicious!!
Amanda A.,"San Diego, CA",117,204,3,3.0,5/4/2015,"Went a few weekends ago. Pretty nice - the decor was beautiful. We didn't have to wait to be seated. The waitress could have been a little warmer of a personality and she was WAY off in the way she described the taste of BBQ sauce (she said it was a Carolina BBQ sauce and would be tangy/mustard like, which I was looking forward to, but instead I found it to be sickeningly sweet). Otherwise, it was a lot of fun at a beautiful location and I was satisfied. Will I be back? Meh, maybe."
Jessalynn C.,"Mount Hope, San Diego, CA",45,22,26,1.0,3/18/2016,Sooo only one star yes! The food was great .... but our service Sucked and I think part of the experience of going out is the service. :( booo
L P.,"San Diego, CA",1,40,8,5.0,4/30/2016,"Placed an order to go and staff was nice, place was clean, and getting busy.  Ordered grilled cheese and falafel salad and I am happy with both."
Chris K.,"Lakeside, CA",0,18,,4.0,5/16/2016,Had a great dinner here on Sat evening.  We were seated quickly.  Our burgers came out fantastic and the cheesecake was awesome especially the Chris' Outrageous!  Waitress was very nice.  Only complaint was the wait time on our dinner was a little too long.
Kieanna C.,"San Diego, CA",4,18,9,5.0,12/18/2014,Love it love it love it. If this is a place your date takes you they care for you. The food is a bit pricey but its worth it and if your not that hungry just a piece of cheesecake and coffee works too. And you can always wslk it off because there is small mall in the area and a historical land mark but i want spoil the fun you have to check it out for yourself.... cheers
Roger P.,"Honolulu, HI",81,27,36,4.0,3/8/2016,I ate in the bar as several of the other Yelper's recommended and had a great experience.  Good service and food.  Thanks
Fahad A.,"Evansville, IN",2,2,,1.0,1/4/2016,Worst Cheesecake Factory ever! Bad service and the food was not hot enough. For sure am Not coming back to this one again.
Sheena I.,"Walnut, CA",2,23,10,5.0,1/23/2016,"Food....good! Cheesecake....good! Service....EXCELLENT! Thank you JENNA for being so attentive and anticipating our needs. So impressed at how she takes care of her customers. Give her a RAISE! I ordered the chicken Madeira like I always do, and it's always BOMB. My husband got the chicken bellagio and it was so good!!! Got my cheesecakes to go. But I already know those are good. It was the white chocolate raspberry truffle and the Hershey milk chocolate."
