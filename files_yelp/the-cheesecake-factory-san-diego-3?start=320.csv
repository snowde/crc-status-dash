Monte W.,"Spring Valley, CA",1,8,7,2.0,11/20/2014,"First impression was nice place. Friendliness sucks. Waitress brought us to an unset table. Cool they have a kids menu but no crayons or anything. Pricey for crappy service. 15 minutes to get ranch dressing. The ""cold apple cider"" is just apple juice. My cup has been empty for 20 minutes now..."
Yelana R.,"San Diego, CA",4,85,24,4.0,3/10/2016,awesome for happy hour! $5 long island ice teas are the best! sliders are awesome. and the Linda's chocolate cake is delicious! (the slice is humongous so great for sharing!) I've also tried but wouldn't recommend the mac n cheese balls and dumplings
Bobby R.,"San Diego, CA",1,5,3,5.0,8/11/2015,I give this place 5 stars just for the cheesecake it is so amazing!!!!!! This is my first time here but it definitely definitely will not be my last.
Alexis B.,"Fresno, CA",224,239,12,1.0,10/26/2015,"I'm normally a big cheesecake factory fan.  I've been to several ones in CA and even in NY.  This is by far the worst one I've ever been to.  The quality of the food was terrible.  I usually order the same thing everywhere I go - Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  I know what it's suppose to taste like - this place had it wrong, wrong, wrong.  The noodles, shrimp and chicken were all overcooked.  and the sauce was way too watery. This place definitely needs new cooks. Service was slow.  It took us forever to get our food.  Our drinks were consistently empty. Our server wasn't particularly friendly (but she was not rude).  This place is in a prime location so they'll always have a good flow of people. But if you're expecting the usual from the cheesecake factory, you won't find it here."
Carie T.,"San Diego, CA",61,78,5,3.0,8/19/2016,"Seeing the reviews now and thinking of my visit from last night. Yes a solid 3 stars. I probably won't return to this location specifically with the busy atmosphere. Went here with our 4 year old to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We both got the combination dinners. His with the Steak Diane with Chicken Madeira, and mine Steak Diane with Salmon, both meals came with mashed potatoes. Best part of meal were the potatoes, which is sad. I've has the same meal at the fashion valley location and it was phenomenal. One of the main reasons why I wanted to come here for our family friendly anniversary. Our son got the corn dog meal. I really don't understand why they use small skinny kebob skewers for the corn dogs. All three fell off of their sticks. I just felt like it was a let down and a waste of money honestly. Our waiter was kind though. He offered to validate our parking ticket for us and check up on us enough, brought the bill on time, left us alone enough to enjoy our family outing. I mean he's the reason for the extra star."
Melissa E.,"Mesa, AZ",49,49,5,1.0,3/6/2016,"Came in on a Sunday afternoon about 2pm... 5 minute wait and we were seated.. 20 minutes after ordering we  received our $12 drinks... yay... our waitress finally came back! I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap tacos he got the monte crisco sandwich.... waitress comes back... sorry mam we are out of lettuce for the wraps... she recommended a chicken avacado mexican salad..  30 minutes later.. I have a plate of lettuce, a soggy tortilla, and 6 pieces of chicken that are about 1 inch.. this salad is $17!! I stir it up to see if maybe the chicken and avacado are playing hide and go seek but nope! Save your money... go literally anywhere else.."
Linda S.,"Lakewood, CA",56,172,18,3.0,2/15/2015,"We ate at the bar and the service was 5 stars. The food was hit or miss, but mostly misses, hence the 3 star review.  The grilled artichoke was ok, The avocado egg rolls were good; the sauce was sweet and a bit of kick.  The bread was fresh and hot and tasty - probably the best thing we ordered. The nachos - well, these were almost inedible. Chewy chips, weird cheesy substance, the smallest dollop of guacamole. These were sad. I'm even sadder that I ate half the order because I was so hungry."
Kim V.,"Placerville, CA",60,211,86,2.0,12/4/2014,"I was super disappointed in this place. I have been to Cheesecake Factory tons of times and have always had a pretty good experience, but it was bad from the moment my party and I walked in. We waited for almost an hour just to get seated. Once we were at our booth (no menus or water or silverware) we sat for another 10-15 minutes before anyone greeted us and gave us menus. We ordered and while it didn't take incredibly long to get the food, our server brought out everyone's meals one by one so that everyone was waiting and awkwardly eating. I was the last person to get my food, the cashew chicken salad, and when it finally came out it arrive with neither the chicken or the cashews.... it was just lettuce and wontons on the plate. Eh. There are so many great places to eat in San Diego, I definitely will choose to go somewhere else before I come here again."
Miguel V.,"Rome, Italy",173,12,,1.0,5/24/2016,"This review is based solely on randomly chosen items on the menu. The service, for all intents and purposes, was fine for a chain restaurant. Ambiance and locale, perfect for a cocktail or lunch menu if there is literally no other place to eat.  Complimentary bread/butter: A bread yes, definitely not edible without tons of cheap butter, no.  1. Dynamite shrimp: Frozen shrimp of low quality taste fishy and gummy regardless of proper frying or seasoning/batter. I like to eat my shrimp, not chew! 2. Chicken costoletta: MASSIVE serving, I'm talking 3-4 proper servings. Unfortunately for Cheesecake Factory, large portions don't make up for lack of fresh ingredients, dry chicken, and horrible smashed potatoes- if you can call them that. Recommendation, skip.  3. Chicken club avocado: At first glance a brioche bun topped with decadent grilled chicken, fresh sliced tomatoes, and avocado/bacon sounds out of this world. However, brioche? From what planet? Well toasted bread swimming in butter, maybe margarine or oil flavored butter? Horrible. Chicken is tasteless, no salt or seasoning to be had. Bacon, how can you mess up bacon, well if you make lots of it and leave it sitting in a warmer, that's how. Better yet, frozen bacon that's reheated! Avocado, ripe. Tomato, fruits are supposed to be sweet, wholesome, and that unmistakable acidity, nope! Instead you get a sorry excuse for a tomato adding to the soggy bread. Fries, lord, stale fries of all things, at least frozen fries taste good, not here folks!  4. Red Velvet cheesecake: Frozen, pre-made, massed produced cream cheese muck, compact/flavorless/oily ""red velvet cake"", and whipped cream? HA! Canned.  Real bread, try Bread and Cie, you'll die. Want real pasta? Try Parma Cucina Italiana on Hillcrest. Pizza/flatbread? Cafe Calabria. Tempura shrimp, take your pick at any Japanese restaurant on Convoy st. Chicken club? Easy, try any gastro pub/American with a reputable source of bacon, say Draft Republic in UTC. Cheesecake? If this is your definition of good cheesecake? Leave this review and eat at the Cheesecake Factory. If you'd like to try something worthwhile then try Extraordinary Desserts on Union st., yes, this one and not the other near Balboa park.  Best part about this, I didn't pay a dime. Gift card. Worth it? Sure, if you like cheap, greasy, no finesse/culinary sense, and a nice ambience to which to impress your date. Otherwise, steer clear and try the delicious option our epicurean San Diego has to offer."
Ron C.,"Pleasanton, CA",151,632,102,3.0,12/4/2013,"I really can't bag on The Cheesecake Factory. They make no bones about being a chain nor hide the fact that their food has a calorie count that's as high as the moon! Still, while traveling with my diverse and picky family, this spot has more than enough variety to meet the needs of all involved. They were happy, and this food snob...well, I can find a beverage or two that will meet my needs just fine. I'm sure we'll be back!"
Joe T.,"Chula Vista, CA",89,200,449,4.0,2/21/2015,"We came here for a late Valentine's dinner. Meaning we came about a week after Valentine's Day. First of all the Decour in this place is beautiful. It used to be the old San Diego Police Department headquarters. It's about one block from the San Diego Bay and right in front of Seaport Village. Also it's a couple blocks from the entrance of the Gaslamp. My wife and I were really impressed with the inside. We were seated with in five minutes! Keep in mind this was a Friday night at 9 o'clock and it was really busy. I was shocked on how fast we got seated. The meal was really good. We ordered a freaking huge burrito and some pasta. I forget the names of the actual orders. The meals came out rather quickly except we forgot to ask for chicken with our pasta. I wish the server would've asked us if we wanted chicken or not. But she was able to make a couple breast of chicken within five minutes and send it out to us. Our server's name was Kimora. She was really friendly and very helpful. I only wish she would've offered us water and come to check on us at least one more time. She came by once to drop off our meal, once to bring the forgotten chicken and once for the check. Overall she was great. The atmosphere was fairly quiet and the people were dressed casual. I was really impressed by the large menu, I didn't expect to have so many choices to pick from. We are definitely going back because I want to try those fried macaroni balls. We had the crab bites and they were delicious. I can't wait to try something else on the menu.Until next time....."
Emily R.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,19,2,1.0,3/25/2016,"one star strictly for service!!!  I go to the Escondido Cheesecake Factory with a group of friends almost monthly, we love it so much. Came to SD with the same group of friends to drop off a friend at the airport and we were over an hour early, so we decided to stop at one of our go-too restaurants (Cheesecake Factory). We came in around 2:50 pm on Mar. 24th and had planned to leave the restaurant by 4:00 pm to get her to the airport on time. We thought no biggie of course because it was such a weird hour and wasn't very busy inside. Our server was training a new server and none of us thought twice about it because we are all servers as well and have all been there before. But our server was absolutely AWFUL. We put in our order right away when he came to us for drinks and all ordered either a salad or a sandwich with nothing that had to actually even be cooked, which is why it absolutely shocked us we hadn't gotten our food 45 minutes into waiting. We got one basket of bread out of our server and no water/ soda refills in that 45 min as well so we were starting to get really frustrated. We ended up waving down the trainee and having her ask the guy who was our server to close out our checks (even before the food came) because it was taking so long and we were on a time restraint. 3:50 pm comes around and everyone at the table has gotten their salad BUT me... I had to wave down our server again after 5 min because he didn't even come over to check on us or tell me why mine was taking forever, and after having to ask him what was the deal with my Beet Salad he gave me the excuse that he didn't think it looked good enough to send out so he had them re make it? But he didn't think he should have to tell me it would be awhile longer while on a time crunch. Got my Beet Salad to - go without even looking at it and was forced to eat it two hours later with it wilted and disgusting. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. The four of us left so annoyed we talked about it for the next fifteen minutes."
Rana D.,"Foothills Park Plaza, AZ",1,31,,1.0,2/23/2016,"2 stars because Cheesecake Factory is consistent no matter what location you go to. However, this locations service was garbage to say the least. I came here with my fiance and there was a 25 minute wait, which is understandable because there was a lot of people. But you would expect them to take at least our drink orders right away after waiting that long. Guess again. We waited about 15 minutes for the server to come and take our drink orders. Then we waited another 15-20 for just our APPETIZER to come. We were obviously annoyed a this point and our server noticed and instead of her trying to reconcile, she gave us attitude and was cold toward us. For instance, we would say thank you and she wouldn't respond. Avoid this location!"
Nicole A.,"Boston, MA",215,102,28,2.0,10/28/2015,"Rubbery chicken. Nice waiter, but took forever to get out or check, even though the place was dead. Just, odd. Cheesecake has gone down over the years for certain! Last resort type place. Just not great."
Eric M.,"Lexington, KY",3,90,3,3.0,7/19/2016,"Standard fair but at least the menu has a wide-range.  I need to stop getting pasta dishes that cost of 10 bucks... we all know the cost of pasta which is why we make it at home for a simple cheap meal.  The portion was large enough to keep me from cheesecake... which is the reason we went there in the first place.  Well really we choose the Factory because nothing really grabbed us down near the water and the shopping village. The Loaded Baked Potato Bites were great, but I think Arby's has something similar but cheaper.  Things got a little strange when talking to our waiter, the conversation moved to where his home was, then somehow onto a tattoo he had on his back.  He wanted to show us but we denied him the chance.  He was a charismatic person but not the right time to offer that to our dinner.  We also had just left a conference and pretty sure all those people walked down so the inside was a bit humid and sweaty."
Daniel O.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Cheap-sake Factory San Diego does it again, this time with jagged plexi glass in the stuffed mushrooms.  About the size of a dime and twice as thick, jagged edges buried in the mushrooms.  Fortunately I bit into it squarely and realized this was not edible.  The managers on duty seemed happier that I was not going to sue or make too big of deal.  Foolishly I thought they may offer a draft beer on the house, but NO! not even that much.  Merely a removal of the mushrooms from the tab.   That's all.   In my experience with items such as the above, where non-edible, dangerous items appear in the food, a proper restaurant manager goes above and beyond to ensure the patrons leave with the most positive feeling that they can.  Clearly that is not the interest here.  The restaurant was loaded with tourists that are likely a one & done and bottom line, not patron satisfaction or safety are of top concern.  Bad job Cheesecake Factory!   As a former tourism official and worker, I highly recommend tourists to spend your money somewhere else, your experience there is not their top concern."
Hoa T.,"Grand Prairie, TX",159,11,19,1.0,11/15/2015,"Just come across experiencing the ""policy"" that YOU can NOT order anything soft while waiting to be seated! Either WAIT to be seated and take order thru a server OR choose the togo order and LEAVE (thats what the host told me regardless my friend is going ill hungry)  ! There is no such thing as order some soft cake to eat while waiting to be seated ! My mind gone CRAZY over this rule thinking are they afraid of me ditching them or doing that like cutting the line ? Or sth else? ALL me and my friends wanted was just some drinks n soft food while waiting for the table( does NOT have to be COMPLIMENTARY , just for the sake add to the table bill !? we can wait for table and certainly can pay lolssss ) !!!Big BOO to cheesecake factory ! Urgh the experience is horrendous :("
Adnan F.,"Chula Vista, CA",117,184,177,1.0,2/2/2016,Sadly to say I dislike this location they never have good customer service and managers don't have patience with customers . This is my 3rd visit ever since this place opened and will be my last as much as I thought they would change but never did. Their food is not good and can't perform what customer service is suppose to be .
Judith G.,"San Diego, CA",8,9,,2.0,9/30/2014,"Over rated and to expensive. The ambiance is nice, food is alright but the price is a bit absurd. I ordered a martini and I think it was like 10.00 or something which is super high. The waiters are also a bit unprofessional not sure if mine was in training or not but they slipped and spilled a bit of my drink on me so that got me a little angry. I felt as though I should have been comped something for this mess up I mean I was wearing my best dress that night. The food isn't bad but the price isn't right. I can't justify going here again with the mishaps from the waiters. I was expecting a bit more."
Carolyn D.,"San Diego, CA",29,32,,5.0,12/18/2015,"Don't really want to love a chain restaurant, but I love them. Don't know how they do such a huge menu and always spot on. Huge portions, creative food, best calamari I have had in SD. Hip decor, an eating event by the time you plow though apps, main course, and of course cheesecake. My fav is the lemon meringue. Have only been at lunchtime."
