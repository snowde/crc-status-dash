Cindy S.,"San Diego, CA",54,33,2,4.0,10/4/2016,"First time their usually go to Otay ranch, we were downtown so why not. Stephanie was or waitress, she was very nice and awesome. Will go back and very kid friendly !"
Laura D.,"San Diego, CA",284,223,362,4.0,11/23/2014,"This is yet another Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure all of you by know are more than familiar with their encyclopedia of a menu and the fact that they take dim lights very seriously. This review is solely going to be focused about this location and not the menu because that's the same at every Cheesecake Factory across the country. This is the newest Cheesecake Factory in San Diego and it's a great location if you want to avoid the craziness over at the Fashion Valley location. You'll get seated relatively quick at this location, even during dinner time in the weekend. The restaurant has plenty of small and large tables and booths to accommodate any party. There's also a nice bar area and plenty of outside seating. I would recommend to sit outside during summer nights because you might be to catch the firework show. Overall this is a great location, definitely one of the best Cheesecake Factories in San Diego. If you want to avoid the large crowds  and not drive 15-20 minutes east of the 805 to get to the Otay Ranch location, then this one is great."
Yvette C.,"San Diego, CA",6,21,66,5.0,2/27/2015,Get the steak Dianne. The combination of the sauces with their mashed potatoes is absolutely delicious.
Rob G.,"San Diego, CA",54,3,,3.0,4/2/2016,"Arrived a little late for dinner (8:30). Line was long, but they seated our party of 4 in less than 30 min. We had a Skinny Caesar salad (average), Chicken Parm sandwich (pretty good), Lettuce wrap tacos (average), and Spicy Cashew Chicken (flavor was good, but seemed reheated, so was a little dry). Server was nice, but very slow. Very average experience."
Kelly D.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,5,4,4.0,3/29/2016,My first time at the Cheesecake Factory!  The menu is more like a book because they have just about everything.  They bring warm bread and it is tasty! The food was great. I had the Chicken Madeira pasta and it was cooked perfectly. The best part of the meal? Cheesecake of course!! We opted to take a slice of lemon meringue and vanilla bean cheesecake home.  Wow- it lived up to our expectations.  Outside dining in the front of the building and you have to pay for parking in a lot out back.
Sarah F.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,17,1,5.0,10/5/2015,"I dined at the Cheesecake Factory last night with my family. We were a decent sized group of 7, and were ravenous after a weekend of travel and the prospects of a late dinner. The Cheesecake Factory was obviously busy, and the wait was 20 mins, we were thrilled when our pager went off. We had my 95 year old grandmother in tow and they were quickly able to seat us and accommodate for her handicap, this included finding a cozy spot for her walker to sit near our booth. We were waited on in no time and had food at our table quickly. Near the end of our evening, my father had to shift out of our booth requiring me to scoot over. When I went to move my leg, I realized my pants were stuck to the bottom of the booth. Upon further inspection, I found a giant wad of chewing gum that had been carelessly deposited on the bottom of the booth had fused to my jeans. We were quickly able to flag down our waitress who called in back up with ice and clean towels to remove the gum from my jeans and the booth. Shortly after, the manager stopped by our table to offer his condolences and offered me a free trip to the dry cleaners on the house. I was able to clean off the gum on my own, so I didn't need dry cleaning, and he quickly offered me a desert of my choosing. The staff acted quickly last night and turned a sticky situation into a successful family outing, and I am deeply grateful. Thank you to everyone who helped us last night! PS- the pumpkin cheesecake is fabulous!"
Charicki E.,"Bonita, CA",0,18,5,1.0,8/17/2014,"Unimpressed. The service was poor, no one greeted my daughter and I at the host station or the table other than to ask how many? The server did not greet us and his only words were, do you know what you want to drink, do you want to order now, can i see your ID, do you want to add to your order, can i get you another glass of wine, and would you like to see the cheesecake menu? No greeting, no smile, no check on how the food was, no offer of refill for my child's drink or an alternate beverage for myself. No goodbye, thank you for visiting-I wish I believed in leaving no tip because this was truly poor service.  My daughter's chocolate milk was made with some kind of thick dark chocolate syrup that was chunky in the bottom and I sent back the first time to add more syrup because the milk was still almost white. The burger bun was soggy with meat juice and disgusting looking. And the server didn't even stop by to ask how was everything or else I would have mentioned the bun's-imagine both buns soggy with grayish pink meat juice-yuck, usually they are toasted or plain. No offer or question whether I would like condiments either. This location could use some service skills...oh yeah and walking in, instead of the servers stepping aside as we the guests walked to our seats, they rushed by almost fighting for space while i held my daughter behind me so she wouldn't be trampled. And on the way out the larger men who may or may have not been employees stood in a triangle of three talking while I had to say excuse me loudly for the one on the right of the path to at least take an inch backwards so I could pass.  Plain poor service, and I have been to many CCF's, but I expect at least a minimum level of service and a fake smile at least."
Dana R.,"El Cajon, CA",118,283,189,4.0,12/31/2013,"We visited this location during the craziness of the Big Bay Balloon Parade. There had to be over 100 people in line before they opened at 11:00. The wait for our party of 14 was 40 minutes. We were told the wait would be ""a little bit."" We were expecting a shorter wait.  Once we were sat, our team of waiters was efficient and friendly and very patient with our party of three adults and ten children. The food, mostly burgers, was excellent. The cheesecake was decadent.  We will go back for sure. My only suggestion to management would be to provide water to people waiting outside. For a newly opened restaurant with a newer wait staff, I think they did a great job handling the one hundred plus people that rushed in their doors this morning."
Christina A.,"Miami, FL",102,208,344,4.0,1/4/2015,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience! Great food, expansive menu, and awesome cheesecake! We love the Thai lettuce wraps, Cajun chicken littles, and marble cheesecake! One less star for the server rarely checking in on us, and rudely correcting me after I put in a request for no mushrooms."
Coco B.,"Denver, CO",106,224,45,4.0,12/27/2013,"Their martini is so delicious they stuff the olives with fresh blue cheese and it is my favorite i have found anywhere the perfect balance! we only got appetizers which was fun and playful we got fried mac and cheese OMG delicious so rich and just amazing i ate 3 and he ate 1 hahaha also the artichoke dip was super gooey, cheesy and delicious! we got the calamari it was okay i have had better for less $$! The wait was a little long but it was 8 on a friday night the service was good and we just waited at the bar for our table so it wasn't bad at all. I would go here again if i was in the area"
Nicole M.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/27/2014,"I have been to Cheesecake Factories in Colorado, Virginia Beach, Chicago, and California. Usually the food is pretty good, though I avoid going because it is a chain and there are so many other great restaurants to try in new cities. After going to the Cheeksecake Factory on Harbor Dr today (had a gift card I needed to use), I decided I really am never going back. I ordered the pit beef dip, which was $14 and probably the worst sandwich I have ever had (the meat was literally all fat). I had a lot higher expectations, especially for the price! The fries were also cold. I haven't been to one in awhile and today realized how much they have raised the prices, granted you do get a lot of food but it is nothing special.  I recommend going just for dessert, don't bother with paying a ton of money for their entrees."
KC S.,"San Diego, CA",2,5,,1.0,9/5/2015,"Not worth to pay $60 plus $11 tip for a greek salad, pesto pasta, grilled artichoke and 2 pina colada. I was very hungry and usually if you are hungry, everything should taste so good. But well, their food did not. I was not impressed at all with the taste. Service was slow when they are not even that busy. One star just because its a beautiful restaurant but the food is not great. There is a better restaurant where i will pay the same price but the taste is way much better. Yes, i should have gone to that place instead but i just thought to give CheeseCake factory a try... I regret it! Not sure if it i will give them another try next time."
Alejandra V.,"San Diego, CA",102,38,4,1.0,7/17/2014,"I wanted to love this location, I really did - next to Seaport Village, close to my apartment, and I really like the Fashion Valley location. However, the wait times here are absolutely ridiculous. We came here on a Tuesday night that didn't seem crazy busy for my mother in law's birthday. Getting a table didn't take too long, but overall, we were in the restaurant for a good 2 1/2 hours. The entrees took FOREVER to come and by the time they had arrived we had already lost our appetite eating bread and appetizers.  What really bothered us was that we didn't so much get an apology or acknowledgment from our waitress until my husband returned his entree. While management did attempt to make things better, we had been waiting far too long at this point and didn't really enjoy our experience. I don't know if it's a lack of staff or a slow kitchen - but something needs to change at this location. Unfortunately, until that happens, we won't be back."
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,4.0,12/2/2013,"This location is WAY better than Fashion Valley and so conveniently located right next to where I work. I'm not sure if this place is great because they just opened and really want to impress their guests, or if they're just going to be better in general. I mean don't get me wrong, you have a few waiters/waitresses that you look at and say ""I'm really glad they're not helping me or else I would be starving"", but ours was on top of it as well as everyone else we encountered. This whole new shopping area is worth the visit. It's a great addition to Seaport Village and business in Downtown, San Diego."
Kali H.,"San Diego, CA",8,42,17,4.0,1/25/2015,Came here with my mom for lunch.  The staff was very helpful and understanding on my food allergies and not cross contaminating. As always the food is really good here. We ordered the Herb crusted Salmon and Fish and Chips. Outdoor seating was absurdly comfortable. My own complaint is the loud trolley and car traffic.
Sandra O.,"National City, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/7/2015,"I had a great experience at this location. We usually go to fashion valley and decided to go here; this location has great service. Our server's name was Paul C, he was not your average waiter. Paul made sure that our needs were met and went above and beyond to give us the best service. Also he wasn't invading our time by coming to our table every second. He new exactly when we needed something. The food was delicious and the atmosphere great. I would definitely recommend this location to everyone.  P.s if every waiter/waitress was like Paul the restaurant industry will be so much better. Thank you Paul (:"
Ed P.,"San Diego, CA",60,173,109,5.0,11/25/2013,Firing on all 8! The best people brought in for the opening we had Dawn from Tennessee and she rocked. Best Louisiana chicken pasta. No waiting since it was a soft opening; I am glad I'm not the competition in this plaza.
Esmeralda S.,"Imperial Beach, CA",9,34,13,4.0,1/8/2015,I went to eat dinner with my boyfriend and the service was lovely ! There was no waiting for a table but then again it was a wednesday. The food was delicious and our waitress was super attentive ! Definitively will be back ( :
Tiffany J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,15,6,2.0,3/1/2015,"Called in my order so I wouldn't have to wait a gazilion years for my food.  The hostess told me it would be 25 minutes.  Great!  No surprise bc it was a Saturday night.  When I arrived at the restaurant the to go cashiers were completely overwhelmed.  The cashier who was there said she couldn't help me bc she didn't take my order...hmm, ok?  When the cashier who placed my ordered arrived, she was carrying over 7 to go bags!  Her counterpart wouldn't even help her!   They ran out of bread; if I wanted any I would have to wait an additional 20 minutes!  Not to mention, they did not have any to go cutlery - forks.  Needless to say I was not satisfied. Oh my noodles were cold and stuck together..."
Tresa P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/10/2016,Don't go on Saturday. They have plenty of tables available but not enough staff so you wait forever.
