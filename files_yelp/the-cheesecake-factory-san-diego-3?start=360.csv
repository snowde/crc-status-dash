Mayra M.,"Potrero, CA",1,7,1,5.0,8/20/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is soooo gooood! I went in on wednesday night around 8 with 3 of my friends. It was a little busy and we got handed a buzzer and told that it would be around a 20-25 minute wait. it ended up being close to 7 minutes and we were seated. Our server Amanda came right after we got seated and asked what we wanted to drink, took our order,  and came back with bread. Me and my friend both got something like Eggroll Sampler? It was alright. my other two friends got the Chicken Madeira which was AMAZING! I think it's my favorite thing i have ever had at a restaurant! Amanda checked on us during our meal, kept our drinks filled and made sure we were doing okay. she came back after to ask if we wanted dessert and recommended a new cheesecake that had nutella on it which was also amazing! The food was great, the atmosphewe was awesome, and the service was superb! Definitely comming back. Definitely recommend this place!"
Bob L.,"Cardiff, CA",841,24,3,5.0,9/13/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always good, but they the BEST HOSTESS Ever! I have been in the food and beverage industry for years, Georgia hands down, without a doubt,  completely treats you like you can to her house, and she owns this place. I listened to her seat many guests in our section, engaged everyone uniquely and always with a smile. Georgia will do very well in life, you are lucky to have an outstanding person on your team."
Anthony G.,"San Diego, CA",3,3,,5.0,3/20/2015,"I have yet to experience any issues aforementioned. Great service every time. The wait is proportional to how popular and busy the place gets. The crowds come in waves from conferences and such, so if local, plan accordingly!  The food is great as well. I've now been ordering the same thing, and they have yet to let me down.  I highly recommend the chicken sliders tossed in buffalo sauce to add some spice. Amazing."
Robert B.,"Las Vegas, NV",111,81,7,2.0,8/2/2014,"This place isn't worthy of three stars. My family and I are staying across the street and called in a to-go order. It was simple: two caprese pizzas and one side salad.  The lady tells us it will be ready in 20-25 mins... Maybe sooner. So... This is where it gets fun. We head down and get there 25 mins later. The food isn't ready. My baby is getting a little fussy after another 15 minutes. We finally get the food and they only gave us 1 pizza. And they also gave us a full sized salad... At that point, there was no way my baby would be fine with waiting another 45 mins to get the second pizza. We just made it work. Good food, but service sucks..."
Bonnie F.,"San Diego, CA",1,124,13,3.0,11/1/2015,"BEWARE:  Glass of sangia is $11.50.   Ridiculous, full of ice, lacking spice.    You can get a pitcher of sangria at the Prado for the price of 2 glasses here, oh and there's no ice in that pitcher.  Good grief.  The fried chicken sliders were awesome, highly recommend, 4 plump sliders, on soft toasted buns, fixins on the side.  Great to share as a light meal. One more thing, the ghetto dingy plastic mugs for water, tacky.  Can i get my ice water in a glass please?"
jessica c.,"Seattle, WA",12,220,,2.0,9/8/2014,"After a day of travel and eating during off hours, my boyfriend and I found ourselves hungry at about 10:30pm on a weeknight and staying next door at the Hyatt. We found that everything closes up shop in that area around 10p or 11p and we didn't want to pay for overpriced room service, so we booked it across the street because we knew this place closed at 11. We walked in at about 10:45 and I acknowledged we knew they were getting ready to close and asked if they were still accepting tables. The bar was already closed otherwise we would've grabbed a seat there because I realize it's super annoying to show up at a restaurant when all the workers want to do is wrap it up for the night. The 2 hostesses reluctantly and with an attitude told us they sat people until 11pm. They then whispered to themselves and when the girl started to walk us back to the table the other one replied, ""don't do it! you can't!"".  The seated us in the very back corner of the restaurant away from all the rest of the tables of people still there eating. 10 minutes go by and no waters, no silverware, nothing. Finally a server that had walked by a couple times asked us if we had been helped and when we told her no she apologized, said that was horrible service and that it wasn't technically her table but that she would of course help us. She got us waters, took our order, and then came back and said even though their bread was supposed to be done for the night that she found a different type of loaf and heated that up for us if that was ok. About 10 minutes later the lady who was supposed to be our waitress showed up and apologized and advised she was on her smoke break and that no she had no idea that anyone had been seated in her section. That explains what the 2 hostesses were whispering about. We appreciated her apologizing as I'm sure it was not entirely her fault and it seemed as though the 2 hostesses threw her under the bus by putting us in her section when they knew she was on her break. She was fine the rest of the time and the other lady who had stepped in to wait on us also came by to check on us again. Really disappointed that I don't remember her name because that's an example of a great worker who takes on a table that isn't even her's at the end of a night."
Veronica W.,"Chino, CA",72,9,11,1.0,8/23/2015,Service sucked! Waitress and manager were rude as hell! After ordering our food they came to tell us they were out of fries which I thought was crazy!! Both manager and waiters were pretty much like we don't have fries either u pick something else or nothing else we can do!! We ended up leaving! Totally rude staff!! Will never come here again!!! I would have gave them no start but didn't have that option.
Isaias Z.,"Norwalk, CA",0,7,4,1.0,8/4/2016,Very bad place to come to. Why? Because service is slow and the food is prepared incorrectly they literally gave my friend raw mushrooms and a tasteless burger that was missing some features written in the description. As for the place not worth it
Erica M.,"National City, CA",0,3,4,2.0,1/31/2016,"We were seated right when we entered on a weekday and by first impression the restaurant had a nice ambiance. The menu is humongous so be prepared to be overwhelmed by their selection of food. We started off with complimentary bread but aside from the sourdough, the bread was literally rock hard! Total turn off. Then I noticed the utensils were on the table. Gross. At least place it into napkins. I ordered the Renee's Special which comes with soup, salad, and a sandwich. You can never go wrong with salad. But the soup was not as hot. And then the sandwich... The bread was rock hard! I literally could bang the bread with my utensils or on the table and it would not dent or break! How can anyone possibly bite into that?! There's no way without breaking your teeth! Overall the food was okay. It's decent. It's always a hit or miss with their entrees. But in retrospect, I would rather eat elsewhere. The food quality and taste for the prices that they charge is not worth it. My advice would be avoid their entrees and just order desserts."
carol f.,"San Diego, CA",92,18,,2.0,8/21/2016,"My experience right now was not the greatest.   Three of us came to eat.  Two orders were for steak, they got the cooked preference wrong.  Two of our party ate and we waited for the third steak to arrive.  An hour later they brought out a rare steak, which was supposed to be medium.  They took it back and I asked for the manager.  At a minimum he could have offered cheesecake or a discount for our troubles.  Maybe he thought we are tourists and won't be back.  Well we are local but I doubt that I will return to this location. The frustrating part is when the manager came out he basically said it was our fault because when he brought the first steak back which was well done not medium, they temperature checked it and it was a perfect medium so they purposely cooked the next one rare.  So of course they took it back and reheated it.  Meanwhile my daughter and I say and watched him eat, guys it was only fair since he had to watch us eat.  Again how hard would it have been to say we are offering you dessert on us or comp the steak.  We no lie waited an hour for the meal."
James H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/9/2015,"It was a busy night and we sat at the bar to save the wait.  The waitress took 10 minutes to bring drinks and bread.  It took another 10 minutes to bring silverware with a promise of plates and napkins.  We gave up on the waitress and finally asked the bus boy for napkins.   The food took about 45 minutes.  My orange chicken was slightly undercooked.  My friend complained her chicken was over cooked and dry and noodles were slightly undercooked. The desert was to go and the waitress brought it on a plate.  She took it back and dumped the cheesecake in a normal to go box.  As we were leaving I hear the guys next to me say ""that was supposed to be to go."" I don't know if this waitress was just having an off night or what but if you see the skinny blond with glasses in your section save the frustration and just leave."
S K.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",1,3,2,2.0,12/27/2013,"I'll start by saying that The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant of all time!  That being said, this location is a poor representation of its normal service and food quality.  The waitress blamed everyone else for its short coming, a little awkward.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad with the dressing on the side. It came out with everything covered in dressing. AND they forgot to put the avocado, which was a determining factor for ordering.  Their normally delicious complimentary sourdough break was hard as a rock. I wouldn't complain normally since it is a free item but it's a signature of this place to serve delicious squaw and sourdough bread. When I flagged down another employee to have it replaced since our waitress was. I where to be found, the girl told me she would bring us another but that they were all that way?!! Crazy! Well she never. Roughy us the replacement rock bread so I have no idea if all the bread was the same. Their squaw bread was delicious as usual.  They also didn't have lemonade. The waitress was baffled as to why that was and blamed the kitchen.  1 star because the food still tasted good. Another star because the place is beautiful and in such a great location! The portions here were very sad. You pay those higher prices because you know you're ordering food that is shareable in size or at least substantial. Here the portions are subpar compared to the Fashion Valley location.  A avoid this location if possible. Hopefully management reviews it's operations and makes changes to restore confidence in TCF."
SH K.,"Singapore, Singapore",3,250,,5.0,9/30/2015,"Nice and quiet if you want a place for lunch at 12pm on a weekday. There is an outside area which is good when it is cool / windy out.  I missed the pumpkin cheesecake by 1 day (I guess it's an October thing)... dang! Got the carrot cake cheesecake instead, which was nice too! Now I need to run 5 miles today..."
Sherrie M.,"San Diego, CA",20,9,1,4.0,1/20/2016,"We live close, and have been here a few times and have had the pleasure of having Matthew serve us before in the bar area, and as always very great server.   We were seated quickly, were waited on quickly and the food was served promptly and hot.  The hamburger is one of the best happy hour deals going and is a great burger.  Tonight especially felt that Matthew deserved acknowledgement because he does a great job and does so consistently !  We will return and ask for his table!  Thanks for a nice evening and the salted carmel cheesecake is amazing !"
Jazlynne W.,"Santee, CA",29,20,1,4.0,8/15/2014,"The food is good and the deserts are great. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because of how the staff treats kids.  First time taking my daughter when she was 6 months old, I was very nervice on how she was be. When we first sat down she started to get a little wiggly. Our waitress came over and asked if she could bring over a baby plate of toast and fruit, no charge. She was so nice to us and was so welcoming to us having a child there.  Same thing the next 2 times we went there. The staff was great with my daughter, making sure we had everything. This is a kid friendly place."
Captn C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,21,1,2.0,5/17/2015,"I have been here a few times now.  Each time, my food has been excellent.  The one thing that consistently lacks here, however, is the service.  This time, food AND service was terrible.  Slow to be waited on, slow for food to hit the table, and slow to present the check. Today, I sat politely as I watched another patron with his wife spoken to by the waiter very rudely.  It was so embarrassing, had I been them, I would have walked out on principle.  It was either a Samoan or Hawaiian waiter who works out of the bar area. He also waited on me.  He was polite during our exchange, but after ordering a not so pleasant meal, he made the observation that I had barely touched the plate.  I never complain or ask for anything, but he took notice, apologized, and reassured me he would waive it from the bill (without a peep from me!).  I was taken aback, as again, it was his observation, not my complaining.  I was impressed, but this was soured shortly later when he returned and stated ""the manager refused to take it off"".  Two things:  1) If you're not empowered to make a situation right, then don't offer to resolve a situation you are incapable of resolving.  That resulted in a HUGE let down for a customer 2) I'm OCD.  I notice everything.  I actually watched as you merely walked your lying self to the register, stared around a bit.  Noticed me looking at you, then returned to the table with check in hand.  At no point did you speak or ask assistance from a manager.   You're attitude and lack of any concern for any and all customers is costing this business money and repeat customers.  I truly hope someone addresses your employment there. Cheers"
Valerie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,1.0,6/14/2015,THE MANAGER SUCKS! He talked to us like we were 5 and had never been to a restaurant before! Worst customer service of my life! My waiter was either high or hungover from the night before! Took forever and disappeared after taking our order which took him more than 15 minutes! NEVER COMING BACK!
Jon B.,"San Diego, CA",8,86,30,4.0,9/9/2015,"Me and my fia fia just ordered delivery from here through the app door dash as we had recieved a coupon in the snail slot from them.  I was never a fan of ccf but I think their mushroom swiss burger changed my mind.  They screwed up by only giving me only one small friend onion.  Seriously did the driver snitch some?  But, even seriouslyer the patty was seasoned quite well.  I wish I could say the same about San Diego.  French fries were a little soggy but you gotta expect that from delivered fries. Duh."
Jimmy K.,"San Diego, CA",199,142,22,4.0,10/1/2014,Another late review. I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory!!! Couldn't help but enjoy having brunch with my parents while they were visiting. My only downfall is that we were seated near no one else and our server was strange. Not sure if he didn't want to work that day or if that was just his personality but kind of awkward. That didn't stop us from enjoying everything. My parents particularly loved their Oreo cheesecake.
Norma O.,"San Diego, CA",32,109,21,4.0,10/23/2015,Id give this location more stars if the service that evening was better. But the guy at the cheesecake counter the next day was super helpful and very patient while we chose our delicousness. The food is decent but I wouldn't make a special trip for just dinner.
