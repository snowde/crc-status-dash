San Diego rocks A.,"San Diego, CA",2,152,13,1.0,5/9/2014,"- Worst service. The guy didn't bring water for 15 minutes, just left us waiting for a long time. Another guy dropped the entire tray of glass cups on the floor and made a big mess. No one bought us the breads and when we asked another waiter, she gave a look by saying breads are brought only if asked. We see other people getting breads without asking.  He had no clue when we asked what is the best cheesecake and requested to give some information about a particular cheesecake. He seems totally uninterested in the job...damn there are a lot of folks who doesn't have a job, just give it to them and move away if you are not interested. Very unfriendly atmosphere - even makes me think that people are treated based on who and where they come from..."
CFM C.,"Petaluma, CA",0,34,32,1.0,5/18/2015,"Okay, let me start by saying I normally enjoy dining at The Cheese Cake Factory and have never had problems. Our family was visiting San Diego for a college graduation and staying at a nearby hotel so we thought of ordering a Cheese Cake for our celebration party.  I called a week ahead of time and ordered a 7"" cake for a pickup at 1PM on May 16, 2015. I also stated that I needed a precut cake which the girl over the phone confirmed wasn't a problem. We arrived on time for our pickup only to find a waiter talking to the two bakery counter girls asking for a cheese cake (or plate itself) to be inscribed with chocolate writing for another graduation party group that was dining there. The two girls flatly told the waiter ""We don't do that!"", even after the waiter begged a second time in order to keep the dining customers happy. This waiter left in discuss. At this point we were next in line and knew we were dealing with very unfriendly and uncaring employees. Sure enough, we told the girl we were here to pick up a preordered cake and she gave it to us. At this point I reconfirmed that the cake was precut like we had ordered so that we didn't have to deal with cutting it in the hotel room. At this point she SNAPED back that we don't cut cheese cakes here! and went on to say that when ordering cakes we never agree to cut cakes!  Even after asking nicely, she refused to cut the cake for us in a nasty tone. After asking she finally gave us a plastic knife to cut it ourselves in the hotel room. Of course when we returned to the hotel with our $30.00 Cheese Cake, the plastic knife did nothing but make a mess of the cake and wasn't strong enough to cut through the base of it. We returned later that day to get the name of the two girls but of course they had already left for the day. All in all, a very bad experience and these two girls have no business working in a field they hate so much. We had ZERO customer service."
Sally T.,"La Mesa, CA",0,17,,1.0,8/6/2016,Today was the first time that I was so unsatisfied with their service and attitude and if I could I would give no stars. I came with 3 of my friends and 2 of them went to park the car so I came in with one of them and we said table for 4 people. But when the 2 of us got to the table she only brought 2 menus anyway she had a bad attitude but she did bring the other 2 menus. We ordered 4 waters and 2 of them had something dirty in the cup so we asked for it to be replaced. We ordered our food and when it came only 3 of our dishes came and by the time we told the waiter my friend was already full so we canceled her order. I usually have better experiences and I am very disappointed at the service today and I won't be back soon until there is better service and attitude.
Daniel N.,"Kennebunkport, ME",7,40,9,4.0,8/24/2014,"Dessert central hands down, no bad cheese cakes. Their menu is infinite and varied, with dishes from the most popular cultural cuisines: Asian, Latin, French, Italian, etc.  The cocktails are tasty and properly strong. Good place for groups and intimate dinner alike"
Matthew C.,"Chandler, AZ",923,106,,3.0,7/4/2014,"We are staying at the Hyatt Manchester and decided to meet family that lives in the area here. It's a beautiful, lovely restaurant in very good condition. Our server was fairly slow, especially when it came time to pay the check. This may be the result of the restaurant being understaffed, but none-the-less will reflect poorly on the restaurant as a whole. Our son ordered the fried shrimp platter, which was devoured quickly. Wife had skiing long island iced tea, which was good. I had the skinny chopped salad - nice volume. Wife had the turkey & avocado sandwich, which she enjoyed. Tab was $60. Yeah, I know it's San Diego, but was a little bent out of shape to see this kind of tab for 2 adults and 2 kids . 50/50 chance we'll eat here next time we're in town."
Lindsay D.,"Las Vegas, NV",221,152,9,1.0,3/25/2014,"RUDE RUDE RUDE!!! The food is great per usual at cheesecake factory, but go to fashion valley. I live downtown and the Harbor location is beautiful and more convenient, but I will gladly drive to the Fashion Valley Location next time. Overheard our server talking SH**T about me to another server at the cashier stand as I got lost going to the bathroom. I could NOT believe it and confronted him. When I was in the bathroom he gave a huge speech to the rest of my friends at the table that he would never talk poorly about a customer, without even apologizing or trying to clear anything up with me! I will never be back no matter how much this location pays me. However, because I have experienced nothing but great service and food at the other locations--they will be getting my business from now on. Shame on you management--looks like you need to train your servers better. SEASONS 52 next door is fab everyone!!! go there instead of wasting your precious time here!"
Maj M.,"Imperial Beach, CA",2,18,42,4.0,8/31/2014,First time I had ever been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant! This place is definitely big and busy ( but not too bad)! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. The food is definitely worth the money. I'll definitely recommend
Candace R.,"Santee, CA",4,16,,4.0,12/31/2015,"Love Cheesecake Factory so good.... The wait to get seated sucks, but it's okay for food that good!"
A F.,"San Diego, CA",396,77,22,4.0,5/28/2014,"Happy Hour makes everything better.  Drink specials and appeteasers that aren't so teasing.  A good girlfriend of mine and I sat in the bar area and quickly greeted by three different people in a five minute span.  Because it was their grand opening week, the crowd wasn't as big as we were expecting for the location. As an avid visitor of Seaport Village, it was nice to find a place to sit and eat without paying for something that was just ""okay"".   I was easily impressed by how attentive everyone was with filling our water glasses, replacing our lap napkins and making sure that our food was good.  Our server (I can't remember his name, but when I return, I will make sure to seek him out to give him the right praise on yelp) was nice enough to offer us warm towelettes to wipe our hands.   Happy Hour prices are reasonable.  I ordered the ""skinny"" chicken tacos: grilled chicken breast with lettuce and salsa on the side, which came with three.  My friend ordered the thai chicken lettuce wraps.  I've had the wraps before and enjoy all of the flavor options they give you with the different sauces they have on the side.  The only disclaimer is that it gets messy, but you can live with messy with this delicious ""salad"" option. Our bill came out to less than $25.00 including tip for the both of us."
RedSrt007 R.,"El Cajon, CA",11,68,5,2.0,5/4/2014,"Uhg, really wanted to love this place. I'm going to break it down: Service - waiter was great, super attentive, always checking in, and great personality.  Cleanliness - wife's water cup was super dirty and had to send back, my cup had a floaty that the waiter caught right when he dropped it off and nicely replaced. Then my son had a fork that still had good stuck to it that was dry and crusty.  Food - I ordered the Diane's steak, and it was good. Wife got salad but unfortunately had a hair in it. Did not mention because she did not want to seem like she wanted anything free; just stopped eating it. Son ordered burger which he said was good but couldn't eat the fries as they were too salty. I tried them to confirm and they seemed double salted. (Maybe mistake??) Did get a slice of cheesecake and was good!! So unfortunately I have to give them a low rating based on the cleanliness and the quality. Would I go again? Probably not, but who knows...."
Tiffany R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,2,1.0,7/5/2016,"Why won't you answer your phones?  I called tonight at 7:52 pm, told the person who answered that I wanted to place an order for pickup, was told I'd be transferred but you guys are a bit busy, and then was put on hold.  I gave up after 17 minutes on hold with no answer.  Very disappointing customer service."
Ella A.,"Irvine, CA",1,45,24,3.0,8/13/2015,"We were around 3:00 pm there but it seemed they were short handed. After we sat, the service was good except that we received the bread after we start eating our food. We ordered chicken piccata and chicken maderia. Actually the test was some how different from what we've tasted before in Vegas! Chicken piccata was more creamy in Vegas."
Marco E.,"San Diego, CA",28,13,75,5.0,6/6/2015,"The reason this review is a 5 star is because of the wonderful service my party of 10 received on June 2nd. Our waiter was named ""Matt Q"", if I ever go back I will always request him for my table. My group had ages from 3 to 55 and he took care of all of us with professionalism and a funny personality to compliment. I also did enjoy the atmosphere of the place and the music, the food was on point along with my drinks. I would go back! :)"
Holly P.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,91,5,3.0,8/18/2014,"Food was great here as it always is at any other Cheesecake Factory. Hostess was not very friendly. And our waiter kind of ruined our experience. I heard him talking to the next table over. He told the pregnant woman it was ok if she ordered alcohol because ""his gf is pregnant and she drinks all the time"" and ""he wouldn't tell anyone"". Wow! I know u want a big tip but isn't that kind of a dangerous and unethical thing to say??? I hope Cheesecake Factory doesn't support this kind of behavior. We'll be back, but not to this loction."
Stephanie G.,"Lakewood, CA",4,23,5,3.0,6/27/2015,"I came here for dinner on a Friday night, it was a busy night but I was lucky enough to get seated within 15 minutes. The menu has a lot of options and everything sounds so yummy. I ordered a pasta and it was really tasty! The only down side was that our waitress had an attitude. She must of been having a bad day and took it out on us. I believe her name is Jillian. It was my first time here I loved the food I just wish I didn't have such a bad experience with our waitress."
Damian V.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,57,1.0,6/20/2016,"Horrible service from the start. Tried hard to enjoy the family trip to San Diego, but this server was horrible!!!! If you get Juan h. Ask for another waiter. He forgot everything, no bread until ask after 25 min. Never ask if everything was good. Needed all drinks refilled, and took him 20 min as well to refill. Horrible service by this individual"
Valerie S.,"El Cajon, CA",7,10,2,4.0,6/27/2015,"Here we go Cons :The menu is too long, there's not one theme of food so it makes choosing something more tedious than it should be.  Pros:The meals are great and the flavors are even better. I absolutely love their red velvet cheesecake. I could probably never get tired of eating this!"
Brian K.,"San Diego, CA",57,565,44,5.0,3/7/2014,"i thought ger-ger was crazy wanting to go here.  my last recollection of cheesecake factory was in fashion plaza where the menus had the calories displayed so i basically had this salmon salad that was disgusting. this time, the menu seemed different.  no calories listed, but at least it seemed they had more healthy options.  not a bunch of grease laden dishes like before.  did they change their menu? i had the flat bread for appetizer.  very good.  perfect amount of food. i had the chicken sandwich (like southwestern or santa fe or something).  it was very good.  nice big portion.  bread was tasty and fresh.  amazing chipotle sauce.  i had mine with sweet potato fries and they were yummy! i had red velvet cheesecake and gerger had the banana cheesecake.  they were delicious.   prices were not too bad.  service good. very nice option for good ol' american restaurant food."
Alondra G.,"La Mirada, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/22/2015,"The food was really good and worth the price, and the service was decent. However, when it was time to pay the bill, our waitress tried to rip us off. I payed with a large bill and the exact coin change, and she came back with the same coin change and no bills. My friend payed with a $20 bill and the waitress tried to deny that she received one.  We had to talk to the manager; it was a mess. This restaurant is nice and all, but I do not recommend anyone going here, because who knows how many times this has happened. I recommend going somewhere else."
Amber B.,"San Diego, CA",1,67,10,2.0,9/4/2015,"Usually I love this place, however ever since they took away the fettuccine alfredo with  sundries tomatoes I've been disappointed with ever other dish I try.  This time I tried the chipotle chicken pasta and it wasn't very flavorful.  My boyfriend got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which is actually pretty good."
