Hans K.,"San Diego, CA",15,39,27,3.0,5/21/2017,"Calorie Nightmare, but tasty! Now that restaurants are showing calorie counts... Good lord this place is unhealthy! Even my wife's salad was over 1000 calories! Took us a while to be seated on a Saturday afternoon when it wasn't that packed, felt like it was kind of unnecessary. Waitress was professional and nice, always kept our drinks topped off. We ordered the Avocado Spring Rolls as our app, and it came out within 5 minutes of us ordering it (again pointing at how long it took us to be seated and yet food came out quick as heck). Wife ordered the Falafel salad and I ordered the Breakfast sandwich, both of which are over 1000 calories. My sandwich was good, nothing spectacular. And wife liked her salad, I really do think we were kind of thrown off by the calorie counts (we were overseas for several years, still getting used to this new law) It was an okay trip, nothing special, but also nothing glaringly wrong."
Osito B.,"San Diego, CA",3,28,9,4.0,11/20/2017,"I'm a fan of CCF but this time I just went for cheesecake take-out. This is the first time I've been to this location and I purchased 2 slices. Considering how many times I've been to CCF for dinner and dessert, this is the first time I've had such small slices. It just didn't justify the price. The packed everything and I wasn't paying attention because I received a phone call. It wasn't​ until I wss home that I noticed. All that written, the cheesecske was delicious!"
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,3.0,7/29/2016,"Pros:  Located at the seaport harbor. It's walking distance from the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Outside patio seating is nice during the warm summer months. Cons: Worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The hostess and waiting service were terrible. Food was not as good as other franchises, by far. I was highly disgusted by the tiny slice and stale taste of red velvet cheesecake. This is the only flavor I buy at every location. None have ever tasted bad like this one.  Management needs take serious action asap. Lots of tables were open. We had a good 20+ minutes wait before being seated. Another 20 minutes passed before a waitress offered us water! Another 10-15 minutes passed before water was brought and our orders were taken. After food came, we nearly forgot we had a waitress. She disappeared until we flagged her down for the bill and to-go bags. Horrible dining experience..."
Seetha G.,"San Diego, CA",145,179,738,3.0,7/30/2016,"Pretty disappointing experience-  We were seated promptly upon arrival but found that our corner booth was cleaned very haphazardly ... The kids menu was fabulous- extensive and had such a wide variety of options, I loved it!! My son tried the grilled salmon with carrots French fries and a lemonade! He was so happy and we were even happier to see he had a nutritious and tasty kids meal. My husband had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The dish was presented beautifully but was pretty disappointing. The pasta was not in the least bit spicy and the Cajun flavors were coated heavily on the seafood only and not the pasta... My mom tried the Chicken Bellagio. It was good - crunchy chicken atop a bed of Basil linguine served with a generous portion of creamy sauce.  I tried the Hibachi Steak - it was cooked perfectly as requested, however the side of ""wasabi"" mashed potatoes had NOT the slightest hint of wasabi and was extremely under seasoned. The side of tempura asparagus was drenched in oil and left little pools of oil on my plate. We then proceeded to salvage this visit with some cheesecake.  We had the Hazelnut Crunch, Pecan Caramel Turtle and the Mango Key Lime cheesecakes, which were thankfully delicious.  I doubt we will be returning here unless it is solely to grab dessert.  Our server was quite distracted and we had to wait for quite long to catch his attention whenever we wanted to make a request."
Alexandra T.,"Fort Worth, TX",74,57,8,2.0,4/17/2017,"I had occasion to come here twice in one day. The first was for lunch: Dining in with friends, we'd all just landed in town and gotten checked in to our local hotels. I shared a falafel salad, which was okay. The service  was friendly and pretty quick. There were a couple of order mix-ups around me, but I didn't pay it too much attention, as we were told the runners were in training.  I was on the go all day, so when I was heading back to my hotel for the night, I figured I'd go for a sure thing and pick up my usual (Shrimp with Angel Hair) to take back to my room. I ordered at the counter, where I was told it would be ready in about 15 minutes.  15 minutes passes. Then 20. 25. It was busy, but by the time I realized more than half an hour had passed, I asked for an update. Turns out, my food had been placed on a shelf without anybody saying anything to me. I was assured it wasn't cold, but the young lady asked if I wanted​ them to make another. I had absolutely no desire to wait another 30 minutes (if I'd wanted to be there that long, I'd have dined in), so I took my food and left.  When I refer to this dish as ""my usual,"" I mean that I've been eating this at CF locations around the country for over a decade. Cold - which it absolutely was - is one thing. This was also undercooked (the noodles were not only underdone, but stuck together as if insufficiently stirred during preparation) AND bland. This is typically an entree that is so deliciously garlicky that you have to plan your day around it. I'm not even sure there was garlic in it at all.  So. The forgetfulness, I could have chalked up to them being busy. What's the excuse for the subpar food? I won't be back to find out."
Melissa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,148,132,1.0,10/20/2017,"I have been meaning to call a manager about this one! SMH - I started off stuffing my face at the bar for happy hour - service was great & the food was good! I had the sweet corn cakes (which are loaded by the way; avocado, sour cream, sauces) and avocado roll - YUM!  but when I finished I had to move to main dining area because we were celebrating a birthday. I was kinda full so only planned to order something small & a drink. My something small was a roasted cauliflower dish that was AWFUL! a ton of sauce, super salty and tasted more fried than roasted. In fact, there was so much on the vegetables that you couldn't even taste the cauliflower. After trying about 3-5 and having my cousin at the table try one to see that my tastebuds weren't off - I called the waiter and sent them back! I asked for a menu to order something else because they were awful and our server FROSTY obliged. Long story short when he brought me my bill at the end of the evening and told me he was charging me for the cauliflower because he had someone in the kitchen taste my food & it was made correctly - um WTH!?! I asked for a manager - whom he never brought out & miraculously took the cauliflower off my bill. He then proceeded to keep the change from my bill which he must have assumed was his tip! You guys KNOW how I feel about service! HORRIBLE YO! Just horrible here!!!"
Mayra C.,"Murrieta, CA",68,3,,1.0,1/3/2018,"One star is OVERRATED for the horrible experience I had at this place! On Christmas Eve, my family and I, a party of 20, decided to go to your location after looking into a few restaurants in the area. Biggest mistake ever, we had a terrible night. When we arrived, we were told that the wait to dine inside was 2-3 hours compared to a 50 minute wait to dine on the patio. We had kids with us and wanted to have dinner before it got late as they wanted to go open their christmas presents. After an hour and a half wait, only half of our party was called in, we were told that the rest of us could go join them when our tables were ready in about 15 minutes. When the rest of us were called and guided towards our table, we realized that you sat the rest of our party inside. If we would have wanted to have dinner apart, we would have stayed home! The staff had no initiative to help with the organization of our tables, so I asked for the rest of my family to be brought outside. After the chaos, we sat and were unattended for about 10 minutes, our waitress came to get our order but we had not even been given the menus yet. To top it off, the warmer near us was not working, we were all freezing! We waited about an hour to be served, and not everyone was served their dinner, my brother in law never got his soup, and my son NEVER got his hamburger ( would have gotten it faster in a drive thru). My sisters pasta wasn't well done, it was tasteless and undercooked. Your patios should not be offered if your heating system is not working, we were all freezing to death! We decided to deal with everything because it was Christmas Eve, a special celebration, but we shouldn't have. The only person I cannot complain about is our waitress, she did her best to accommodate us.  If you can't deal with a party of 20, let people know, there are plenty of options in the area. Don't ruin peoples celebrations!"
Nick M.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2017,"IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS THANKS TO ERIKA EDWARDS (the shift ""Manager"") I WOULD!!! here's what happened: A party of 15 and I went to this specific location on 12/17/17 for a Secret Santa party. We were greeted and seated in the outdoor section of the location and one of our guests with us happened to be a part time worker with the cheesecake Factory (for another location in San Diego). After 15 or 20 minutes into our visit, the shift manager, Erika Edwards, pulled our friend who works for the company aside and proceeded to curse at her in a very unprofessional manner because she claimed that we were being ""too loud"". My entire group overheard the shift manager saying such verbiage to our friend Jucelle (the one who works for the company as well) and we did not appreciate the level of respect that was given to her whatsoever as we felt it was VERY unprofessional especially coming from a management standpoint. she was saying to Jucelle (about the rest of us) that ""they are being 'Fucking' ridiculous"" and she ""doesn't not give a 'Shit' who we are, she will kick us all out"". After hearing these comments (when she claimed that we were being too loud), many of the members of our party became disgusted and did not want to eat at the restaurant. I tried to diffuse the situation myself by getting everyone to stay and eat at the restaurant as it was late at night and it would be difficult to find a reservation elsewhere. Some of the members in our group asked Jucelle if she could speak to the other shift manager on duty. The gentleman showed up and listened to what we had to say, then Erika came back and began defending her case by saying that we were ""being loud"" once again. We explained to her politely that we were seated in an outdoor environment and it should be expected that our party might be a bit louder than others if you consider the fact that we are a party of 15 rather than 2. She then proceeded to claim that we were ""Harassing"" other guests. We all called her a liar for that because we asked a couple seated directly behind us (not even 3 feet away) if we harassed them in any way, the gentleman of the 2 simply smiled shook his head and replied, ""no you guys are fine"" in front of Erika as well. We asked politely if we could at least get an apology for the situation. We said we will try our best to satisfy Erika's needs and we were willing to comply to her accusations, but she refused to even apologize for her own actions towards our friend and kept blaming us for the situation. All in all, we chose to leave the restaurant after this terrible experience that was gifted to us by Erika, making her name to us all very memorable as none of us have ever been asked to leave a restaurant or have we never left a restaurant by own will after a souring turn of events. I am a manager myself and I can truly say the skills of Erika on handling this situation were very distasteful and are not of management quality. You should NEVER curse at an employee lower than yourself especially if she is on her time off and is a customer of the company at that point. If Erika had a problem with us from the beginning she should have addressed the issue by coming to all of us and asking us all politely to lower our voices if we were being of a disturbance at all. We would like some sort of action to be placed against Erika Edwards because her hospitality was not professional, and her words were definitely not up to par as well. We went out and carried our Secret Santa Party at another restaurant, and as a loyal Cheesecake Factory guest I will sadly say that I will never visit that location again after my experience at this specific location."
Kat T.,"Alexandria, VA",72,109,207,1.0,1/14/2017,"Very bad service overall!  From reserving a table to the actual service.  Horrible!  Robert (our supposed waiter) Took our order and vanished.  Typically, a heads up that they are going on break and so and so will take over but no, we didn't get that courtesy.  It took awhile to make eye contact with another waiter for even a refill.  I love Cheesecake factory, but this location is horrible.  I hope the Manager will do her job and train her staff accordingly.  From customer service to promptness...this location needs help!   Things that need help:   Took long to get seated, waiter vanished without a trace, food took very long to be served (other tables were served before us), no refills as it should have been, took awhile for someone to even  check in on us, bill took a longer than normal time to come.  Patio heater did not work, food was mediocre and not hot, heck not even warm.  Shouldn't pasta be warm?  The seats outside was damp.  The Manager almost seemed as if she had an attitude when I told her about my service.  Great way of keeping your customers!!! I used to always rave about Cheesecake Factory, however, I have nothing good to say about this location.  I mean look at all these poor reviews from fellow Yelpers!!!! CORPORATE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT."
Kristen L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",106,26,12,4.0,7/26/2017,"It probably seems a shame to eat at a chain like Cheesecake Factory in San Diego, but during Comic-Con, I end up eating here a lot because we stay in the Hyatt across the street. During Comic-Con, the place is of course a madhouse. We generally don't get there before 9 p.m., and the wait for a table is still ages and ages. And so we always eat in the bar, which is actually super fun anyway. Even given the context of Comic-Con I've never had a problem with the wait staff; everyone has always been as quick as possible, attentive (bread while you wait?) and friendly.  It's become a Comic-Con tradition, and one I plan to continue. Because, really, how do you go wrong with Cheesecake Factory?"
Sandy C.,"San Marcos, CA",40,85,50,4.0,1/14/2017,This place it's great to come with your family and friends. Food taste is good and they give you big portions. Service it's pretty good. They are attentive and you don't have to be chaining  the servers. Price wise it's ok- Parking can sometimes be hassle !!  Overall it's a great place
Justin C.,"San Diego, CA",321,6,1,1.0,8/8/2017,"First time at this Cheesecake Factory location. I frequent the Fashion Valley location often, as I work in that mall. Service was the worst I have ever seen in any restaurant. 2 of the members of my party received and finished eating their food before the other half of my party was served. Waiter never made an effort to explain what was going on, offered to refill our water once in the 2 hours we were sat, and would frequently forget things he was asked (ranch sauce, bread, straws).  I do not plan on returning to this location anytime in the future and highly recommend any different location if anyone is interested."
Joy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,72,111,4.0,8/17/2017,"Great location. Always consistent, always good, but super expensive. I guess that's the price you pay for standardized service, food and atmosphere. No matter where you go, you can count on CF. #kidfriendly #familyfriendly"
Felix G.,"La Mesa, CA",80,41,74,3.0,3/2/2017,Food was delicious and the server was great. We got the avocado toast and the pizza lunch special. I wish the pizza had a thicker crust so it wouldn't  end up soggy. Other than that we got two slices of cheese cake to go.  I suggest the lemon raspberry cheese cake.
Natalie M.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,1.0,9/2/2017,"Ordered from doordash. Margherita pizza was burnt, dry and hard. Completely disgusting. Mozzarella looked like it was tossed on the top and not melted. If I was at the restaurant I would have returned it. Shocked they would even send it as it was. I don't think they would have sent this out to a customer at the restaurant. Very disappointing."
Frank N.,"San Diego, CA",86,162,469,4.0,1/2/2017,"This is one of my favorite places for Cheese cake. We had appetizers, buffalo wings (great) , Dinner then our prized cheese cake. We code the Mango Keylime cheese cake with black coffee. The cheese cake was so delicious as you took a bite it was a slice of heaven.  Great place for dinner, drinks and Cheese cake. You can't go wrong at this beautiful location"
Rachel B.,"Bremerton, WA",36,4,1,1.0,9/16/2017,"This was probably the worst birthday experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. The whole point of going for your birthday is to get a Cheesecake and have the whole birthday experience right? Well first off my shrimp angel hair pasta had barely any sauce and it just tasted like bland noodles with some tomatoes on top. Even my friends order was missing the sauce on her meal and her chicken was dry. My other friend had to wait on his burger almost 30 mins after we all got our orders because apparently they forgot about his order and tried to lie about it. We were all almost done by the time he even got his and to make it worse the girl (whose name I originally left out but after her friend left me nasty messages on here I'll say it LIZETTE) brought out the plate just laughed about it which was completely rude and unprofessional. Then, my friends had told the waiter it was my birthday so we were all waiting for him to come back so we could put in our cheesecake orders but they never even asked us if we wanted Cheesecake but instead they come out with a little tiny glass filled with pudding and whipped cream on top. Now I have been to a Cheesecake many times before and they ALWAYS ask if we want Cheesecake according to their policy but they never even gave us the option. We told the manager who claimed that was normal but we have all had birthdays at different locations before and that's not normal. So if you're looking to go here for your birthday think twice. We ended up just going to extraordinary desserts downtown and I wish I would have just gone there in the first place. Worst ever. Also, don't dare leave a negative review because the servers friends will send you nasty messages!"
Alicia F.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,4,1.0,9/17/2017,This place is garbage. I've always gone to the one on Friars and will not be coming back to this one. They can't make the signature dishes to save their lives and who messes up pasta!? Plus they have this extremely facetious and rude waitress (maybe just a food runner because there is no way they allow her to interact with customers willingly) named Lizzet. The managers are also unaware of corporate rules. When I called corporate they concurred that our situation was handled against what they have in their rules. Please don't waste your time or money here. Go to the Friars road one or hell even travel as far as the Eastlake location!
Megan M.,"Monrovia, CA",2,20,54,4.0,9/25/2017,"I think the food is your generic sit down chain food. But I love the cheesecakes. I got the vanilla bean cheesecake and the chocolate chip cookie dough one. The vanilla bean is excellent, as always, and even better the next day after freezing it. The cookie dough cheesecake slice was alright. But nothing spectacular."
Crystal M.,"San Francisco, CA",60,49,23,3.0,6/28/2017,"I found a gift card in an old wallet (hello, random) and used it on a lazy day. Specifically, Wednesday around 6PM, this place is PACKED. I sat outside on a bench (there are plenty of benches, they've learned since the early days) and heard someone joke/complain about waiting in line to put their names on a waiting list. I don't know if they take reservations, but make one or get there early. The food is good. The Jamaican shrimp is not spicy. The very sweet girl I ordered it from had no idea what it was, which is not surprising given their ridiculously long menu.  You really don't need a review for a chain, so the punchline is THIS PLACE IS POPULAR."
