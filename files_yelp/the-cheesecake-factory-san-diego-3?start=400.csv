Ching-Yun L.,"San Diego, CA",205,262,1795,4.0,2/10/2014,"Wow! What a lovely Cheesecake factory. My go-to Cheesecake Factory of choice used to be the one at Fashion Valley, but not anymore! This one is brand-spankin' new, the service was wonderful, the decor fresh, and there are heaters out on the patio. And, of course, most importantly, there are lots of new menu items too! As in, an actual separate menu of ""new"" items...just when I thought their menu couldn't get more extensive. It's a book...like literally it's 20 pgs with over 50 different cheesecakes. Yummmm... My friend and I both took a glance at the menu, went over to the ""Brunch"" section, and for SOME reason, ended up picking the exact same thing, and that was the MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH. And I guess that's one of the reasons we are BFFs (Brunch Foodies Forever...oh you thought it meant Best Friend Forever? Pssshhh. We're not in 5th grade anymore okay, people. Grow up. Gosh). Anyway, what was I saying again? OH YEA. O-M-G. Did I read the menu right? Last I checked I was at Cheesecake Factory...an establishment known to ""play it safe"" with the menu, or so I thought! Boy was I mistaken. Please accept my apologies, Mr. Factory. Here are the ingredients. I have listed them individually for more emphasis.   -Crunchy french toast STUFFED with  -Bacon, -Grilled ham, -Scrambled eggs, - & Melted swiss cheese -Dusted w/ powdered sugar - & Served with Strawberry preserves (this last ingredient I didn't really need). -AND you get to choose a side! You can get potatoes/french fries or if you feel guilty like me, you can request fruit. We were both pretty pleased with the ""sandwich"" as we both can get indecisive about whether to go sweet/savory during brunch. Problem solved. Best of Both Worlds, right? Back me up here, Miley/Hannah Montana! Whoooaaaa. So that might have been my entire recommended caloric intake for the day...but hey, everyone gets a cheat day right?! Shhhhh...! Just wear your gym clothes next time & immediately go for a run around the scenic Seaport Village area. On second thought, maybe do it before your visit to the delicious Calorie--I mean, Cheesecake Factory."
Paul L.,"Riverside, CA",7,7,2,1.0,6/20/2015,"oh my god.

Gary N.,"El Paso, TX",42,42,7,4.0,7/11/2014,"What can i say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said. This review is for the one located at Seaport Village in San Diego, California. Huge selection of menu items to choose from. Our very friendly and knowledgable waiter Nick. One star for service and three stars for food. My wife and i were there for lunch we both had salads; i had the bar b q chicken salad and she had the tostada salad. Ingredients were fresh and delicious. No dessert can you believe it. Great lunch no complaints."
Brent J.,"Turlock, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/28/2016,"Terrible experience (5/28/16). We arrived and they told us it would be a 25 minute wait, no big deal and in 30 minutes our pager went off.  When we got to the counter with our party of 3 they informed us they had only put us down for 2 and we would have to wait just a little longer but they would give us the next available table to accommodate 3. They seated two other parties of 3-4 before us but we did get seated after that.  Service was poor with no bread offered or given. Then we ordered and when the food came out, guess what? Only two of our three orders came out. More apologies etc but by now we just want to get out of this place.  My wife's pasta was under cooked and flavorless, I ordered tacos but partially blame myself for ordering tacos at a place named The Cheescake Factory, but they sucked none the less. My sons steak that arrived late was actually pretty good as long as you don't mind watching everyone else eat and then have them watch you eat later on as they can't get the order right. Overall it was a good way to throw away just short of a hundred bucks."
Felisha L.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/2/2016,Amazing service...we had something wrong with our food nothing huge just salsa (friend is allergic) but the manager came out said sorry and offered something to eat while she waited very nice love this place no matter what location we go to we always have a nice time
Brittany P.,"San Diego, CA",38,5,1,1.0,6/11/2016,"I'm giving this location 1 star because of the waitress (Jazmine Z. AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE!! The epitome of bad customer service!!! not location, I love it!!) my friends & I had just gotten back to the states, so of course we did not feel like cooking. Even though we all live 15+ miles from this location, it is our favorite! We get there & we are told we can have patio without waiting. We said sure because otherwise we would be there for 30 mins waiting for a table. I ask before going outside was there heaters. I was told yes so I agreed. We sat outside for about 10 mins and we realize it's windy & the heater is not working very well. Our server offer to take us inside to sit. We thanked him & he moved us (BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!) this young man tells the waitress we need to move from outside. She looks at us, rolls her eyes, & walks away! Doesn't greet us, tell us her name, nothing! We had ordered our apps, drinks, & food with our original server so no biggie. I was thinking maybe he told her & she is in the weeds (oversat). Again, no biggy I worked my way through college serving so I get it. She passes our table for the next 10Mins without speaking or really making eye contact. Our apps came out but brought by someone else so she gave us everything we needed. 5 mins pass; no, how is everything, drinks went Unfilled for another 10 mins. I ask another server what her name is. She tells me & I call her over & ask if she is our server to be sure. I didn't want to say hey, wave, or snap at her so I made sure I had her name. Maybe she was having a really bad night & it wasn't personal I thought. I didn't want to return the rudeness to her. After I asked her She says ""yea"" with an attitude. I smile & ask her can she refill our drinks for us. She comes back 8 mins later with our drinks. She walks to all her other tables talking refilling drinks, etc. our main courses come out, again brought by others. We start eating & regardless of her lack of service, still having a good time & reflecting on our trip. Another 10 mins go by she hasn't check on us, seen how anything was going, etc. A nice young lady in the section ask if we are ok and can she get anything for us. I ask her was her co worker always like this with people. She looks at her, rolls her eyes, looks back at me smiling while asking did I want to talk to management? I told her that it's ok, there are a lot of people in here. It's busy, I'll talk to him another time. I did tell her our service was horrible! She apologized and asked again did I want to talk to management. I tell her again that I don't want to make a scene, but I will chat with him later. I asked her to get our waiter for me though. Our server (Jasmine Z.) comes over & says yes. I asked her for the check & boxes. She immediately walks away but stops at every table she has, refills drinks, gets napkins, etc. she finally comes back and sets the tab down & leaves. She comes back 5 mins after, collects it, drops the boxes off, & walks away. There was not enough boxes & she didn't ask us about how we wanted it split. She opened it & seen cards, walks over and asked ""how we wanted it."" We told her just divide it, it didn't have to be to each order. She comes backs then walks to the front.  We pack up, shake our heads, & begin to head out. She ignored us the whole time but stood by he manager, smiling, & telling us have a good night. The young lady that actually  helped us was standing there disgusted. I was not going to bother but this has literally be the most disrespectful experience I've ever had. I was a server for YEARS!!! If I don't have enough to tip at least 18%, I DONT GO OUT TO EAT. PERIOD. She treated us horribly & was one of the most uncouth human beings I've ever experience!!! Do yourself a favor Cheesecake Factory, LOSE JASMINE Z. Before u lose loyal customers. I making an appointment  with management today. She thought when we left it was over! It's not about the money. I don't want any of it back! It's not the corporation fault, the kitchens fault, or anyone's but HERS!!! I will be calling management today to see if He will be look at surveillance!   I don't want to money, I WANT HER FIRED!!!!!"
Andrew M.,"San Diego, CA",305,9,6,3.0,11/6/2015,"3 Stars because Cheesecake Factory is normally consistently awesome.  Love bringing my east coast friends here that haven't been to one.  My first visit to this location though left us with an undercooked Salmon that left my girlfriend (visiting from the east coast) not feeling well.  When I approached them to have the situation rectified the offer was a free slice of cheesecake or more salmon, neither of which sounded good to my sick girl.  After pressing the manager he gave us a much better option that satisfied us.  They would get 1 star for this but the manager took care of us in the end."
Stefanie O.,"San Diego, CA",41,55,31,3.0,5/28/2014,"It is all at once comforting and disappointing to eat at a chain restaurant.  My dining experience here at the Cheesecake Factory at the Headquarters was no different.   The menu is online so I won't go into any of that, but rather speak of this location.  I work down the street and we walked over to a great outdoor patio that kept a patio feel.  They use comfy couch like booths for the tables and it is directly on the street where the trolleys go by.  There is a view of Kansas City BBQ and a bit of cab/pedicab watching on a slow day.   The staff is attentive and positive.  Great overall dining experience and is probably a wonderful addition for the convention crowd.   I am still getting over the fact that I was eating at a mall restaurant when I waited a year to see what they were putting into the renovated police station. Come on!  Give us something authentic, original and with a bit of San Diego history to match the location."
Donovan C.,"Tuba City, AZ",1,1,,1.0,10/27/2015,"This place is so disappointing! I've always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory whenever traveling. In Phoenix, for example, there are local dishes on the menu.  I came to San Diego to the harbor to enjoy a fish sandwich. I mean, this is even where they sell fresh fish daily. They don't even have that on their menu.  The service and experience all-around was lackluster. Dirty silverware, no sugar for the day-old stale overbrewed coffee, and prices for the food doesn't match the service we received. I love San Diego when I visit, and this is a great area--it's disappointing to experience such bland careless service and food. :/"
Maxine R.,"San Diego, CA",749,108,190,1.0,1/22/2014,"Terrible service.  I guess their redeeming factor is their cheesecake. Yay for cheesecake! You would think that a big name like this would have their marbles together, especially for being in the heart of tourist town SD, but alas...they don't.  Came here for my dad's birthday (party of 5).  Slow service. Took our food about 30 min to come out, and our cheesecake about another 15 minutes after we waited for our food to be boxed (another 10 minutes).  Server was oblivious.  Tried to get her attention plenty of times with no luck.  It wasn't like they were slammed either... I don't think I need to really review the food? I mean...it is Cheesecake factory."
Helen G.,"San Diego, CA",82,142,326,4.0,2/9/2014,"As someone who isn't a fan of breakfast foods which include eggs, I was pleasantly surprised by the Monte Cristo Sandwich (from the Sunday brunch part of the menu). The strawberry preserves also added a nice touch to the sandwich. Seating outside is perfect depending on the weather. Chairs were comfy and service was great."
Joe B.,"San Diego, CA",194,44,16,3.0,8/3/2014,"Expect to spend over two hours here on a Saturday night, if not even more.  The service was extremely slooooooow.  We were seated within 30 minutes, and that was the quickest part of the evening.  Two of us tried items from the seasonal menu and they were really good.  However, one of us had to wait an additional 5-10 minutes for the food arrive after everyone had theirs.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, but I think that it was slightly overkill.   Oh, yeah, the cheesecake was alright.  Just kidding, it was the best part of the meal,"
Xtyn C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/25/2015,Took so long for the staff to even asked us if we want any drinks. The fact that we waited a long time for our table is enough to ditch this Cheesecake Factory branch.  I had to call the manager and asked if there's anyone assigned in our table to wait.
Noel S.,"Roseville, MN",36,25,39,4.0,8/18/2015,"After waiting for an interminably long time at another trendy restaurant, we ended up at the CCF because hey had no waiting. The kids were exhausted and so were we. CCF was like an America. We were the tired, huddled and hungry masses. We didn't see Penny. But the food was decent and the drinks were cold. It came quickly, the staff was efficient and it was satisfying. Can't really give higher praise than that. Thank you CCF."
R H.,"Castaic, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/29/2016,Terrible. Chicken Avocado salad has two small pieces of chicken and NO avocado...despite asking for double. Nachos were soggy/very bad as well.
H L.,"San Diego, CA",23,91,228,4.0,8/10/2014,"We came here on Sunday when Comic Con was over.  The place was packed and there was half an hour wait.   The food is consistent with the other locations.  Service was great as always.  Just know that parking for the ""Headquarters"" complex changes according to what is going on.  I was here two weeks prior and parking was only $8 for several hours. This time it was $8/per hour."
Melissa H.,"San Diego, CA",30,50,52,1.0,1/1/2014,"Happy New Year's!  Okay so my daughter and I went here for a New Year's Eve meal, it was not what I expected having been to Cheesecake Factory all over the US.  This one was the worst!  When we arrived we were not greeted, instead we listened to a bad rendition of happy birthday being sung by like twenty servers to one server while I helplessly waited to be acknowledged.  Then the girl who helped us was very unprofessional, she looked around like she would find someone to help us and then she decided to get a couple menus and help us herself...what a novel idea!  Unfortunately she was still trapped behind the birthday girl and her posse who blocked the girl in behind the host/hostess area so she could not seat us...maybe this was a fire hazard?   So the girl (title is unknown) walks us to a table where she seats us and profusely apologizes to my daughter for not having another New Year's streamer blow deal (clearly I do not know the name of this contraption, but it makes a lot of noise.  It should be called a noise maker but I digress).  Eventually we reached our table and our server Scott showed up, took our drink orders and disappeared.  Apparently at this Cheesecake Factory they really get into the ""spirit"" of the occasion because I turned around just as a gang of what appeared to be servers and chefs loudly counted down the ball dropping in Times Square on the tv.  I didn't watch it, I've seen that show and I know how it ends.  About ten minutes later Scott returns with our drinks, lemonades and takes our food orders.  My daughter has to go to the restroom.  We excuse ourselves to the restroom, leaving our drinks, silverware, my daughter's coloring book, and whatever else we can to let them know that hey we just sat down and now we're just going to the loo.  When we return the table is completely blank:  no silverware, no glasses, beverages are missing...I think we've been robbed.   By this time I see Scott and ask him to change our order to a to-go order since it's taking a while still.  I don't even finish my sentence before another server comes out with our food, a cheese pizza for the princess and shrimp scampi for me.  My shrimp scampi was $19.95 with several pieces of large, seasoned shrimp and a big ball of molded pasta in the middle of the plate.  The pasta was so disgusting.  I guess anything is supposed to look better with parsley right?  Well maybe olive oil would have prevented it from sticking because it was stuck together like a ball.  I literally sat there like a kid trying to get the pasta unstuck, to onlookers appearing as if playing with my food.   To make a long story longer Scott messed up our dessert order of a red velvet cheesecake and a lemon pie for my daughter.  I should have been suspect when he said ""do you want lemon cheesecake or lemon pie"" and I said lemon pie.  He returned with some type of lemon confection that was not lemon pie.  I was surprised anyhow that CF would have lemon pie since they specialize in cheesecake.  But they also have apple crisp and other non-cheesecake items.  Anyhow it was a horrible NYE/NY experience.  The only thing that made it worthwhile was enjoying it with my daughter who only cared about her missing coloring book that they somehow stole and ""couldn't find"".  It was a mess, a lovely mess and if I do not go to this CF location again in 2014 it will be too soon! I tried to make it comical because in reality it was anything but funny.  It was really a horrible experience and it just happened to be on NYE/NY 2014."
Gem B.,"San Diego, CA",18,98,9,4.0,3/15/2014,"I am consistently impressed with not only the sheer size of the menu (if you can't find something you like here, you just can't be taken anywhere!) and the quality of the food on such a scale. Definitely chain-y and a little corporate, but not Olive-Garden-y or greasy or bland.  I've lived in Seattle before and I'm glad Ivar Haglund isn't alive to hear me say this, but: the VERY BEST clam chowder I've ever had was from The Cheesecake Factory.  This place is a great choice for large groups because they have the room for you, they're clearly trained for large groups, and the menu is enormous and varied so everyone can find something. I've seen this place in my travels before but I never ventured inside because I detest cheesecake and that's right in their name, so, y'know, why would I? I was mistaken. I still hate cheesecake, but they have much more than that. I've had the clam chowder (it was an announced feature, so it might not be there all the time), loaded baked potato tots, the Mai Tai (I cannot ever resist a Mai Tai), the Americana cheeseburger (superb!), and the shrimp and chicken gumbo. My friends/guests/whatever have had the Flying Gorilla (ice cream/milkshake cocktail), meatloaf, and a couple other chicken dishes that I can't remember because I didn't order them. :) One friend also had a piece of the dulce de leche cheesecake and said it was very good."
Mia D.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,,1.0,2/15/2014,"Allow me to start off by saying I love the Cheesecake Factory.  But I do not care for  the service at the Headquarters by Seaport Village.  The first time I ate dinner with a friend and our server was Joseph's was indifferent  and acted rude  by acting like we had interrupted his time and didn't care to serve us..  Today while exploring the new Headquarters' my husband and I  felt like some cheesecake to take home. I walked up to the area "" to go "" and  I had Kasandra E (29) service me. Yikes, it was the same, but  she was more  rude, I think she must have  picked the wrong business to be in. When it was my turn to order she  curly asked if I needed help,  not in a friendly manner. Maybe I am cutting in on their  break time.  There are  other restaurants in this area I think I need to try instead of here. I will  save the Cheesecake Factory for Fashion Valley or North County Fair.  I am not sure why I only have this problem there. I have eaten at other  Cheese cake Factories around the country.  The Greens in Ohio, Henderson, Anaheim , Palm Springs, Miami.  And always the service was wonderful and welcoming."
Shai A.,"Yokosuka, Japan",35,49,84,4.0,5/16/2014,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever!!!! So, we head to the Cheesecake Factory for some lunch... I order the grilled fish tacos, hold the tomatoes and onions (hey, I'm watching the acid reflux)...get my food and voilà...half cooked fish.  Our waitress was very sweet and took care of getting my food back to the back, but being that it took forever to get it back out to me, I opted for it to be placed in a togo box. The manager came and was very apologetic and offered me a free desert (I gladly accepted). Turned out my entire meal was free! :) I must say that the mishap sucked but all worked out in the end.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory for the great customer service!!!"
