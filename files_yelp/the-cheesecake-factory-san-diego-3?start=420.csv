Suzy G.,"San Diego, CA",134,75,17,3.0,5/14/2014,"Location is downtown at The Headquarters (old Police station). Drinks were pretty good, but my Luau Salad was kinda soggy. Also, they must of had a plumbing problem because there was an odd smell that on the outdoor patio. On the plus side, the front patio is great for people watching. Our server was very speedy considering the place was packed. It was also fun to walk around after dinner and check out all of the shops. Parking was tough though, the line to get out of the parking lot took about 20 mins. All in all, my experience wasn't bad. I've never really had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory. It just wasn't great."
Tammy L.,"San Diego, CA",23,9,20,5.0,5/17/2015,"I had the Cuban sandwich.  Super  yummy!  The lettuce wraps were vertu tasty! Loved our server,  Stephanie. Always great to go into a restaurant and see the staff smiling.  We will definitely return and ask for the same server!"
Carole D.,"Oceanside, CA",72,8,5,1.0,3/15/2016,"I have always loved the Cheesecake factory, but not this night. We arrived around 8:30pm and it was quite busy. The hostess when I asked how is your day going, replied... ""Quite stressful"" well, that is a very welcome greeting. ;0(  Server Juan, came over to introduce himself after a bit of waiting, his eyes were nearly closed, and looked as though he could hardly keep them open. Hmmmm? I thought this is interesting. He proceeded to give us very slow and unattentive service. My husbands Beef Dip was mushy. When Juan finally made his appearance to our table we asked if this was the way it normally is served his response to my husbands uneaten dish was...""yeah, we have been having issues with that and I hope they do something about it soon"". Not... would you like me to get you something else I see you have not eaten your meal? The check took forever to arrive and then yes you guessed it, he took forever to come back to pick it up so we could pay and leave. This was all together a poor experience. I don't know what the management is doing there, but they are really not paying attention to what is going on with their staff or the guests."
Mukund B.,"San Diego, CA",10,3,,4.0,7/18/2015,I have been to this Cheesecake Factory multiple times and this is a fabulous place to have meals when you visit seaport village. They have big patio sitting and that is amazing. My personal favorites are avocado egg rolls and 4 cheese pasta.
Kyle F.,"El Cajon, CA",11,277,92,1.0,12/25/2014,"Ugh. Another horrible experience. Our waiter was non existent again. I got one glass of water to drink for the whole stay. Saw him maybe three times. We explicitly told him several times we didn't want our food boxed to go. So he picks up the dishes, puts the dirty ones with our food, then comes back with it boxed to go! It's not that hard. Come on Cheesecake Factory get it together."
Lynn H.,"San Diego, CA",1,39,9,5.0,4/26/2015,Great and convenient location. Easy to park and there's usually not a long wait. Always great food and courteous and friendly service.
Kalyca B.,"San Diego, CA",10,22,2,5.0,12/5/2013,"Oreos, Reeses and S'mores Galore, Strawberries, Cherries, Pineapples and More! I am determined and destine to try every single one of those cheesecakes!  Come to this beautiful location and see the even more beautiful servers hosts and bakers bartenders and bussers.(managers too) Gorgeous building, delicious food (and drinks), friendly smiles and decadent desserts"
Amy R.,"Brighton, TN",16,14,3,4.0,8/3/2014,"My husband and I met friends to celebrate a birthday, and our friends were told the wait was 40 minutes - they waited for 16. Our server (I wish I knew his name) was great. He was attentive, kind, answered all of our questions, and never left us wanting for anything.  I ordered the Asian chicken salad, and it was delicious. I do wish there was a bit more chicken on it, as it kind of got lost in the salad, but seen as it was on the skinnylicious menu I suppose I can't complain! Either way, it was yummy, and I will order it again. Upon our servers suggestion we tried their new lemon merengue cheesecake and it was heavenly.  My husband ordered the ahi tuna carpaccio- AMAZING! just had to share that. :) oh and I loved how the nachos stayed crisp through the entire enjoyment of them and even the ones under everything were not soggy. Major plus!  No one in our party of five (youngest: age two) had any leftovers (aside from the kids side of fruit) and we all walked away happy.  Speaking of the children's side of fruit, I don't know if the apples were cut with a knife that had previously been used for onions, or if onions were somehow mixed in with the apples (??!) but we learned very quickly why my son wouldn't touch his apples - and he loves apples! We didn't remedy the issue because he was full, but we were all a bit surprised to taste oniony apples. Yuck.  Amazing food, great service, didn't wait long for anything, and all on a Friday night!  We'll definitely return."
Mindy F.,"San Diego, CA",3,69,7,2.0,3/15/2014,"Came in for a drink and appetizer. The people next to us got their food and appy at the same time and no less than 4 people including the mgr came over to apologize then comped their appy and boxed it up for them. How awful for them to be so put out like that, all their food brought out together.  Meanwhile our appy arrived and the cilantro was not washed and had dirt all over it, so we mentioned it to our server.  The mgr replaced it and it came out 15 minutes later.  We sat there as the people next to us enjoyed their lunch and their free appy boxed up for later.  When our bill came the server made a point to tell us they weren't charging us for the first appy with dirt on the food that took 15 minutes.  Gee thanks! But we got charge for the second one.... Shoulda been consistent and gave us ours free too since we were the ones who has to sit and wait! Odd experience. Won't be back!"
Nic L.,"San Diego, CA",102,117,69,2.0,3/17/2014,First time at DT location; awful service.  Had to ask for bread & water with our meal. Waiter was not attentive. Food was good except for the Mac & cheese bites. Too much breading & overdone.  Slowwwww service.  .......Balsamic vinaigrette dressing is bomb though :)  Won't be back to this location off sure ... Will stick with mission valley.
Anne G.,"Chula Vista, CA",83,13,,3.0,1/19/2015,"My experience was okay. I went with a party of women on Saturday around 2:15pm.  The food was delicious but the service wasn't all that great. We had a male server on Saturday who was okay at first but started to become rude when we asked him questions.  The ladies in my party wanted him to wait on us and then leave him no tip but I did not want to deal with a rude or bi-polar waiter for the duration of our lunch.   I decided to switch to another server or waitress and she was fantastic.  I do not know her name but she had a tattoo on her wrist and had brown curly hair. She was helpful, sweet, and was very accommodating.  She made the rest of our Cheesecake experience wonderful. Since our receipts had our original waiter on them, we decide to pay our bill with no tip to our original waiter.  Instead,  we handed our wonderful waitress a 20% tip. She deserved it!"
Keith P.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",69,13,2,5.0,10/3/2014,"So I decided to eat here last night with my sister. We couldn't find any ""free"" parking so we paid for one. Overall my experience was as expected. I have been to the Cheesecake Factory before at other locations.  The service was good, food was great with plenty to choose from. I ended up choosing the combo with steak and chicken maidera. The chicken maidera was excellent! After the meal we had ordered cheesecakes. As a cheesecake lover I was not disappointed :)"
Isabel H.,"National City, San Diego, CA",156,10,25,3.0,6/25/2014,"I know I know, three stars isn't a great thing, honestly I'm just rating the cheesecake which is what we were there for since the place is called The Cheesecake Factory. I have to say that I did not enjoy my cheesecake much but I think I just picked the wrong one this time since I usually enjoy anything I order there. The cheesecake was overly sweet and I couldn't finish it. I loved the staff, all friendly and very attentive to customers. Kudos to server Matt who was very patient and helpful in recommending a wine and describing the cheesecakes for me and my friend. Ambiance and noise level were perfect for an intimate dinner had it not been for the tables so close together that it almost seemed like the people next to us were listening in on our conversation and we felt we were in on theirs. Other than that we had a good experience."
Veronica V.,"Corona, CA",0,4,11,4.0,2/18/2014,"Excellent service, there is a long wait for a reason :) my favorite Here are the fried macaroni and cheese balls. All cheesecakes I've tried have been scrumptious!  Raspberry truffle, banana creme, key lime, cherry. Great ambiance."
Cammy L.,"Santee, CA",269,267,171,4.0,12/30/2013,"Decided to check out this new location this past week. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. I have never been a huge fan of the fashion valley location. It is just awkward and too busy. We came here for lunch on a busy Saturday. Being next to sea port village we had a couple of options for parking. There was no free street parking left so we opted for valet. It is a little steep at $15.00 however if you plan to make a day of it down there it would be worth it.  Stepping into the restaurant I was absolutely in love with the details, color scheme and overall sleek look. It was a beautiful day but we were seated inside.  To eat I ordered a cheese burger and fries. My boyfriend had the club sandwich and fries with a Green flash ipa. My first fries were a little cold so our server brought me new hot, fresh fries. My favorite! The burger had such great flavor and was moist and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend said his club sandwich was delicious too. Our server was super nice and accommodating.  I would come back here in a heartbeat over fashion valley at least for lunch. The dinner madness may be more than I would brave."
Horus G.,"San Pedro, CA",0,10,1,1.0,11/23/2013,"'' I SHOULD HAVE WENT TO TACO BELL OR JUST TRIED THE CHEESE CAKE '' Great downtown location! Completely Superficial! The restaurant and servers look nice on the outside but when it comes to organization and dealing with large groups they were under trained. The servers were confused about who the orders belonged to and resorted to asking the diners. It took an hour to get our food and one order was forgotten. I had to ask two servers to bring a straw for my drink which took over 11 minutes. By this time appetites were ruined to the point where some of my friends just asked for a bag to go because they got full off of the bread, soup of the day and drinks. In addition, the food taste like medicine! I HIGHLY recommend the owner of this place invest in training these servers and new cooks if they want great reviews, if they are really desperate take the time out and learn from Robert Irvine in Restaurant Impossible. Great Show by the way! :)"
Rosalie V.,"Albuquerque, NM",32,23,1,3.0,8/3/2015,"Food was ok, somewhat overpriced but that's expected. I love the cheesecake though and our waitress was incredible! I wish I remembered her name, because she was just awesome! The bang bang shrimp I think it was, was actually better than expected!"
Jackie L.,"Enumclaw, WA",23,48,,3.0,5/14/2016,"This place is very popular during dinner hours so either go early or expect a wait. We luckily got a seat at the bar so we did not wait long. However, the food was amazing and the waitress was there to help whenever asked. Very good food."
Thuy C.,"San Diego, CA",85,152,186,3.0,2/9/2014,"The location is nice because it's right next to seaport village but it's a pain to park!!! Pull into the seaport parking and the Cheesecake Factory will validate it for you up to 2 hours for $3! Or you can valet for $15 but why would you when the self park is right behind the valet! Service was really slow even though tons of servers so service would get a 1 and I would prefer the service at the Fashion Valley Mall over this one! However, the food is much better at this location for some reason and the presentation is better as well! They made my husband's bday very nice by extra touch on his cheesecake- that was much appreciated!"
Kimzo A.,"Oceanside, CA",16,40,244,5.0,3/16/2014,Super nice restaurant.  I went with my friend and I was impressed. The service was great. I order shrimp scampi... super delicious!  My piña colada drink was one of the best I have ever tried.  I will definitely return. .. I was too full or else I would've tried their famous cheesecake!  Next time for sure! (;
