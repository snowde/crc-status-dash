Thayne L.,"San Diego, CA",330,295,43,4.0,12/31/2013,"Went tonight for some apps and loved the layout.  Beautiful inside and out.  Service was probably a 7 out of 10 (Which is great for a chain, usually chain's are 3-5).  Only gripe I had was our calamari sat in the window for a while as the plate was scorching and the actual calamari was cold with the breading falling off  All in all though, a good meal.  The ahi tartare was very delicious as was the crab cake bites."
Janel A.,"El Cajon, CA",1,15,4,2.0,4/1/2016,"was seated very quickly but food took almost 50 minutes and claimed the kitchen was ""backed up"", the manager was rude about it when we confronted him that we were upset and gave attitude the whole time as if it was our fault that the service wasnt great. the food was sort of cold and obviously looked like it was left on out for a bit, assuming because our food took so long. and now i have food poisoning."

Michael G.,"San Diego, CA",15,3,3,5.0,6/15/2014,"Perfection. In this location, the saying holds fast, ""The early bird gets the worm.""  Arriving promptly at 10:00 a.m., we (this is including my Father, Mother, Grandpa, and myself) are greeted with a small crowd and very happy waiters and waitresses. We are then seated promptly and the most helpful and courteous waitress is here to take our order with a happy smile and skip in her step. She catered very well to our orders, memorizing all of them down the to spot and she made sure that our cups were full, but she always asked before filling. Her is name is Dawn. She not only gave us excellent service but she also lead us to the exit and directed the way to the jail cells left in the courtyard. I have never experienced better service. Now that the service is out of the way, we can get to the food. The food itself was excellent. Everything tasting fresh and flavorful plus getting all of out food in a rather quick amount of time just upped the entire experience. I myself ordered an omelette with Goat Cheese, Spinach, Bacon, and Mushrooms. It was cooked perfectly with everything tasting great. My mom ordered the Monte Cristo and said it not only looked tantalizing but tasted very good. My Father and Grandfather ordered the chilaquiles and it was presented beautifully with a taste to match. If you're worried about them being spicy, they weren't (this is coming from my father who has a rather low tolerance for spicy foods). The atmosphere is rather pleasant. If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory you've pretty much been to them all. Some may say it has a tourist type feel to it but it's to the contrary. Once inside it feels like you could be in any of their many locations.  Overall, this restaurant surpassed our expectations. BUT we have only been here during these opening hours. I cannot say that the service and food quality we received  will continue throughout the day."
Asad A.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,44,9,5.0,6/14/2015,"Great staff, food, good environment. Family friendly and right by San Diego Bay!! It's in a very good location. There is paid parking meters available also."
Wade R.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,42,,1.0,10/11/2016,"We definitely will not ever be coming back here to eat.  We were seated in a booth by the kitchen, so throughout the entire meal the banging of pans & dishes and the yelling from the cooks & busboys serenaded us.  We tried the calamari as an appetizer.  They were overly soaked in oil.  I guess they forgot how to drain the excess cooking oil prior to serving it.  It came with this small container of cocktail sauce they was not enough for even half the order.  I ordered the fish and chips.  Disgusting!  Once again the fish had an excessive amount of oil in it.  Since the fish was on the chips, the oil naturally was transferred to them.  I could not eat even half of the meal it was so bad.  The server was dreadful.  They kept forgetting to bring items, refill our water and tea, validate our parking ticket.    Here is a big hint.  If it is between visiting here or going hungry, Go Hungry.  You will thank us in the long haul."
Ivan F.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,15,12,4.0,7/5/2015,"Food was good, service was good, wait wasn't too long. Had the jambalaya was very good, nut nothing special."
Sarah F.,"San Diego, CA",4,8,5,5.0,6/4/2015,"A captain and two deckhands walked in to this cheesecake factory after a day on our boat and all we wanted was cheesecake. What we got exceeded our expectations. We shared the tater tots, which were little explosions of flavor, a red velvet CC slice, a s'more CC, and the key lime CC. All were fantastic, but what really made the experience was our waiter Cory. He had us laughing like crazy and truly made this visit on Saturday the best Cheesecake Factory experience any of us had yet enjoyed. Thank you, Cory for making it awesome and for helping the girl who is personally responsible for the drought in CA to get a sip of water."
Yaseng Y.,"Seal Beach, CA",114,132,28,1.0,8/6/2014,"My family and I went on Monday 7/28/14 after a terrific visit to the Maritime Museum and before the USS Midway.  We got there at 1:02-ish, got seated in 12 minutes, got to order in another 15 minutes or so and the food arrived about 40 minutes beyond that.  We left at about 2:50 PM--bad choice for lunch, it turned out. I was dissuaded by the waitress from ordering salad as that would take 20 minutes.  I didn't see the logic of that after we waited over 40 minutes for food.  The waitress said they were trying to recover from the weekend.  Wish we had been told that when we were waiting to be seated.  We would have grabbed some quick grub on the Midway instead and saved some pretty penny, and time. Asian lettuce wrap and herb crusted salmon were great.  Grilled steak medallions was short on steak, unlike at the one we are used to in Huntington Beach, about half the thickness. And overdone when we asked for medium.  No zing neither.  Sigh, went the crossfit fanatic husband. The Chicken pasta was undercooked with chicken overcooked and dry; kids did not care for it, which indicated a big thumbs down.   The worst was the Pecan Turtle cheesecake--ick, ick, ick!  I've had bad dessert at CF, consistently.  This chain does not live up to it's name for dessert, me thinks.  My whole family agrees unanimously on this, even the kids.  They need to whip up some fresher, healthier, tastier desserts.  Until then, pass on bad dessert, and this location."
Lalo I.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,5.0,10/26/2015,"went in to eat the other day with my girlfriend and i gotta say the atmosphere is on point. we decided to eat in  the patio area which was nice with the beautiful san diego weather. we had a server named jimmy who took care of us ( he has a pretty awesome mustache) he was good on recomending some appetizers and dishes. we ended up getting what he recommended which was the warm crab artichoke dip, cant complain it was good. although the food took a bit it was worth the wait the jambalaya was good. my girlfriend ended up trying the pumkin cheesecake that jim suggested and was very satisfied overall good experience. hard to find places with great food and great service. will definently come again and request the same server. good job cheesecake!"
Jared D.,"San Diego, CA",102,68,33,3.0,3/20/2015,"The ambiance is spectacular. It's elegantly decorated and very warm inside. Views of the city are great, food is fair to moderate. Recommend it if you're traveling to the city."
Kenneth C.,"San Diego, CA",11,13,,3.0,4/20/2014,"I came here late on a Saturday night. I've never been to this Cheesecake Factory. This one is located right around the corner of Seaport Village. I'll start off with the parking. I didn't really find designated parking for this place. I found side parking right around the corner and just paid for parking. Almost every parking in downtown is paid parking so that didn't really bother me. This place is actually located inside a marketplace alongside other restaurants and stores. The first thing I noticed when I walked in is the ambient lighting inside. All of the Cheesecake Factories I've been to have this distinct lighting. This gives the restaurant an upscale look from exterior to interior. There is also outside seating to enjoy the San Diego view. If this place is your first time, you will notice that there is an area where you can actually order their famous cheesecakes in full pie sizes if you want. It's been a long time since I've actually had one of their cheesecakes but from what I remember, their cheesecakes tasted pretty good. Now if you want mind blowing cheesecakes, then hit up Extraordinary Desserts, but that's another story to talk about later. There is also a bar located inside with several TVs that display sports. We were seated right away. The restaurant didn't look too packed late at night. The menu list is full of variety. They have sandwiches, burgers, pasta, specialties, cheesecakes, and etc. I didn't find anything too expensive. Most meals averaged around $14 - $16. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms for like $17.50. After you order, you are served 2 loafs of bread: sourdough and some kind of brown honey oat. The brown honey oat bread usually tastes fantastic because it's sweet tasting. I was actually a little disappointed this time because both loafs of bread felt a little stale and tasted dry. The waitress also didn't ask us if we wanted more bread. After we finished the bread quickly, we sat there and waited a good 20 minutes for the food to be finished. Now if you ask me, 20 minutes is a bit on the longer side unless you're ordering the perfect lobster or filet mignon. Once the food arrived, I was actually a little surprised. The plate was actually filled. My meal had like 3 pieces of thinly sliced chicken breast on top of a good amount of bow tie pasta and mushrooms. The meal tasted really good, and I managed to eat it all. I was left pretty stuffed. An average person probably wouldn't have been able to finish the meal, and yes I do eat a lot of food. The waitress was a nice lady. She was persistent is asking how our meal tasted. The only big thing that made this review a 3 star instead of a 4 star is the amount of time it took for our food to arrive at our table. It took a little longer than usual. Other than that, I would come here again in the future."
E A.,"San Diego, CA",0,39,6,5.0,3/27/2016,"What a great experience. Dinner and dessert was delicious. I did not expect such quality and service at this super busy restaurant near Seaport Village. I had pasta and chicken, along with a carrot cake. My only complaint is there are too many choices on their menu. Ok, I'm really not complaining."
Linda C.,"Santee, CA",0,23,,2.0,12/6/2014,"I am only giving this restaurant a two star only because our waitresses was great with us. Other then that it would have gotten only one star. We went in with a party of 25 to celebrate my brother in-law bday. We waited an hour and a half to be seated. Everybody ordered their drinks & food then we waited another hour until our food came out. By the time the food came out my kids was tired, barely ate, & one actually fell asleep. I HiGHLY recommend they start considering taking reservation.  I ordered garlic noodles with shrimp, close to a $20 plate & it was horrible, very bland , no taste or flavor at all. It was not worth the money. I could of cooked up something better at home."
ALISHA C.,"San Diego, CA",5,15,3,1.0,1/8/2014,"Went last night for my brother in laws birthday. From the second we got there it was already a bad experience.  First it took 30 minutes to even be greeted by our waiter, then once he brought out the bread he disapeared and another waitress (who was very attentive and helpful)  took our drink order and food orders. Before our food came the waiter came back saying that the waitress was off, and he was back to being our waiter.  By the time our food came it was another 30 minutes for our party of 6 to all get our food. 3 of the 5 orders were wrong. My husbands pasta had no sauce, my sisters 5 cheese chicken pasta had the chicken barely cooked and my sister in laws cheeseburger was missing the bacon which took the waiter another 20 minutes to bring. The whole experince at this location was bad.  Not to mention the waitress who our waiter said was off, was not off she ended up being there and came over to tell us bye. Will only be back to any Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecakes."
Jack L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,49,8,2.0,1/6/2014,"Dining here with my  GF on New Years Day.  Disaster Alert!   From the moment we arrived just about everything that could go wrong, did!   Quoted 15 minutes for a table.  That took 45 minutes.  It was obvious that the kitchen was backed up and messed up, but it took awhile longer to figure out how badly it was messed up. After finally being seated we ordered appetizers and entrees.  We asked for bread at least three times but that never arrived.  After no less than 45 minutes our entrees arrived.  About 5 minutes later our appetizers arrived.  The pasta was disgusting, the salad overdressed and missing several ingredients.  The pasta was cold and the salad was warm.  Whoops. Needless to say, the server was frustrated but offered us nothing in exchange for this .  It seems to me that she should have comped the entire meal?  Am I wrong here?  Finally, we received the bill, tipped 20% (not really her fault) and left. It's a ""factory""  alright, but most factory's have at least modicum of quality control."
Mary K.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",540,703,1410,2.0,2/25/2015,"Not a fan of anything here. Everything is bland, tasteless and easy to make at home. There's nothing special about the Cheesecake Factory. I get no flavor in any of their food. It's disappointing because the resteraunt itself is so beautiful. But the food is a complete thumbs down. I've tried the cheesecakes as well and those are also nothing that special. For the price you're paying, take your money somewhere else and get some real flavor in your food. They should call this place the bland factory."
Sue S.,"San Diego, CA",8,131,,5.0,12/8/2013,"What I get is always good, as are the staff and everything else. But the winning factor here is that we did not have to wait! Yay."
Donna B.,"Temecula, CA",12,42,12,5.0,7/8/2015,"Great night at CF!  Our waitress, Jenna, was perfect. My teenage daughter told me I should let her manager know. I tried but couldn't find him or her. This is second best~ she was really sweet, fast, and went above and beyond. Our food was good and it was a beautiful night out on the patio. We decided we are moving here :) After dinner, we walked around the harbor. For dessert, we took home banana cheesecake. It was really good, of course."
Cassidy J.,"Orange, CA",161,327,573,3.0,2/21/2015,Well it was the typical Cheesecake Factory. Food was good. I had the chicken mushroom wraps and split the shrimp gumbo. Both were very good! Service wasn't great though. The waitress acted completely uninterested in us. The experience would have been better if the customer service was improved.
