Mike M.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",4,15,2,1.0,8/18/2014,"This is another hostess complaint bad attitude no smiles no greeting just shoveled me off to a table didn't even give me a menu. Mahi-mahi for 2195 was overcooked broccoli was undercooked. The only thing good about the experience was the waiter was absolutely outstanding.  I was not going to post this but then I left and got extreme diarrhea. I always wondered why this happened at restaurants sometimes so I got this from live  ...... Dining at restaurants might be an enjoyable way to eat your meals, but experiencing diarrhea afterward can leave you with a foul odor. Diarrhea is frequent, loose and watery stools that contain more water, minerals and salts than normal stools. Eating certain restaurant foods can increase your risk of diarrhea, particularly if these foods are contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Consult your doctor about the reasons why restaurant food gives you diarrhea."
Koral I.,"Nevada City, CA",0,8,,4.0,4/3/2016,"Friendly staff. Vegan Cobb salad was delicious and plentiful. Vegetarian burger was so so. They used to have a beetburger, which was much better. This one was barley and brown rice based, which didn't hold together very well. Service was good."
Anthony M.,"Antioch, CA",282,31,3,2.0,12/10/2014,"Service at the tables in the bar area sucks, very disappointed. Love the food and drinks but dont think I will be back"
Jo Y.,"Oceanside, CA",0,60,5,1.0,9/19/2014,Worst Chicken Fettuccine I've ever had. The sauce was so soupy and salty.  I asked the waitress to send it back & I ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  Another mistake.  The shrimp wasn't deveined.  Gross!  I lost my appetite.  Won't be coming back to this place.
Mack B.,"San Diego, CA",8,23,,1.0,6/11/2014,Parking is not free here. It will cost you $17.00 to park. Waited 30 minutes to be seated. It was 5 pm and they doing shift change. Lots of seat were empty at this time. Waitress very slow and never around. Food came cold and took one hour to get it at our table. If you buy booze and cocktails you get first class service at the bar. If you are a family and buy no booze. You will get very lousy service here.
Garrett S.,"Vista, CA",0,14,4,4.0,4/18/2015,The Grilled Rib-Eye was really good and would definitely go back for another one! The outside seating was nice/ comfortable and they have heaters that are decent if you sit close enough to one of them
Denise T.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",8,19,8,5.0,1/16/2015,"Nothing different from any other Cheesecake Factory. Good food and great service! I come to this Cheesecake Factory during Lunch time very often and all I gotta say is that they are AMAZING!!! Not packed at all during early lunch which i LOVE cause there is no wait so u get a table as soon as u walk in.  However,they do get busier as day goes on, specially during dinner time. They have a patio sitting area, very comforting. Ive had different servers and they are all friendly and efficent. Food is always good and it comes fast. They have a HUGE selection of entrees, apetizers, drinks, and of course DESSERTS! Luv it, period."
Toya H.,"Houston, TX",0,22,6,5.0,2/14/2015,"The wait time after ordering is AMAZING!!  We were here on Saturday evening around 5pm Valentines Day, and got our food within 20 minutes of sitting down and ordering.  Fabulous."
Joey S.,"Seaside Park, NJ",13,3,7,1.0,4/11/2015,The artichoke and spinach dip was soupy and the steak sandwich I ordered was almost all bread.  It was busy and loud.  I did not like it.
Nicole B.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,94,,1.0,9/6/2014,"We had a really bad experience at this Cheesecake Factory. We were seated quickly. Our server arrived shortly thereafter and took our drink and appetizer order. Unfortunately, it took over 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Our nacho appetizer arrives before the drink and all the chips were charred/burned. We asked them to remake it. Thereafter, we ordered our entrees. Our meals came out fairly quickly. However, my friends pasta was cold and my vegetarian dish came out with chicken on it. We sent them back and had to wait a significant amount of time before they brought out our food. At that point, we just wanted to leave. We did not have an enjoyable experience like we usually do at other Cheesecake locations. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location."
Derek N.,"Vallejo, CA",0,24,2,5.0,9/19/2014,I ate here twice in a one week period while I was traveling on business. Both times I was pleased. First time I had the jambalaya pasta it was very flavorful and good. The second time I had the grilled ribeye and Mac and cheese it was also great. Steak cooked perfectly medium rare.
Glen M.,"El Monte, CA",59,83,19,3.0,10/8/2014,"Went here 3 times during my Comic-Con Trip, I tried going somewhere else but places closer to my hotel were so busy so i had to walk. From the places I found this place was actually the cheapest. The food options are huge! It took me a while to read the menu, it was like reading a book! I had to take breaks, maybe that's why i came 3 nights in row so I can read the whole menu. Any ways I order the Cuban sandwich once and the Kobe burger another and the shrimp gumbo last visit. I thought the food was good but not great. I can't imagine the chef perfecting one plate over all the items in the menu. The best part of all my nights was desert. First there selection in the cheesecake category is huge but they are called cheesecake factory. All my selections were great but my favorite was the Snickers Cheesecake. Price was a little high but in the end I give this place an A-ok."
Tom R.,"National City, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/24/2014,"Awsome experience... fantastic service by the server named Tory. I ordered the warm crab and artichoke dip which was amazingly delicious, it was served with perfectly toasted, oiled, bread slices. I highly recommend this place and this dish to everyone!!!"
Dulce M.,"Oceanside, CA",40,229,18,2.0,8/6/2014,I concur with the recent 1 and 2 star reviews.  I came last night at 8:15 for some late night munching.  There was still quite a bit of a wait but we were able to snag a seat at the bar.  The bartender seemed annoyed that we weren't ordering drinks..just food. The bartender forgets our bread and to put our order in. The manager comes over and apologizes and gives a lame excuse that they were backed up with food orders in the kitchen.  Ummm...not the bartender forgot. Can we just be honest??? The food was mediocre and seemed rushed.  We were also give a mole type sauce for the avocado egg rolls. gross! I much prefer the Fashion Valley one. The service is lacking and the taste of the food was not very good.  What is wrong with restaurants these days???!!
Katrina R.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",25,6,1,5.0,8/13/2014,Had a quick lunch at the bar. The bartender Rodolfo was very helpful and fast taking my order. He provided amazing service as well with everyone else in the Bar lounge area.
Alexa L.,"San Diego, CA",0,217,316,3.0,9/23/2014,"What is there to say about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said a thousand times before? While this is a newer location, it is just the same as any Cheesecake Factory you'll find in any mall, shopping center, city, etc.  Same menu, same huge portions, same waiters in all white and same huge waiting times. If you are a die hard Cheesecake Factory fan then you will enjoy this location at the Headquarters. Take a stroll through the shops or down by the water while you wait.  But if you're looking for a stellar dinner option, there are so many amazing and unique non chain restaurants within blocks of this place."
S H.,"Redding, CA",200,79,13,5.0,1/14/2015,Always wonderful service and wonderful food.  The atmosphere is great.  Prices slightly higher than the average chain restaurant but doesn't stop us from going.  Outside seating is beautiful
George R.,"Montclair, CA",23,5,,5.0,2/7/2015,Great atmosphere on the patio accompanied by great customer service! Thank you Richard G our waiter! Very attentive! We were satisfied customers!
Crystal U.,"Escondido, CA",10,39,,5.0,10/9/2014,Perfect! No complaints! Great food & excellent service!! Love it would definitely recommend! :)
Adam S.,"San Diego, CA",1644,761,174,3.0,7/31/2014,"This is a very nice location for Cheesecake Factory, even better than Fashion Valley (though you have to pay for parking which is a joke).  First off, this is one of my favorite national chains, the food is always amazing and it's one of the few places I go and don't really care what I get because I know it's going to be awesome!  And the cheesecake selection?  Even better!  However, this location really lacked on service.  When our waiter did make it to our table, he was attentive and courteous, but those moments he was at the table were far and in between, which is inexcusable when you have a 15+ party during lunch where your section is not that crowded.  I want to give this location an even lower rating but like I mentioned before, when our server did come to the table, he did a good job, it's just the overall service that this location was lacking.  There was even a point where the manager just stared at our table, like a creeper standing in the dark at the bar.  I would have expected him to come in and ask how things are going considering we were the biggest party in the restaurant at the time, but hey, maybe it's just ""his thing"" to stare at patrons, who knows.  But of course, I couldn't ever give low rating to a cheesecake factory, they just have too much to offer and is truly one of the premier restaurant chains in the US.  The atmosphere, the quality, the quantity, the selection, it all works, which is amazing because their menu is all over the place, so kudos for that.  But compared to other locations, this one falls short."
