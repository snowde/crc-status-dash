Bryan C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/5/2016,"This place was great. Came in on a Saturday night with some friends, and even though it was pretty busy, we got seated quickly and our drink orders were taken sooner than we thought. The menu offers up a wide selection of entrees, drinks, apps, burgers, and desserts, so you really can't go wrong. The food came out pretty quickly and the service was awesome. The prices are definitely worth it, not to mention the cheesecakes are fantastic."
Nagel C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",21,16,8,5.0,1/3/2015,We had a group of 9 walk off the street and when every one else's wait was an hour or more they got our group in 25 minutes our waiter Cory was super awesome and funny and made our night. Our food came super quick probably in 20-30 minutes or less. This was a very enjoyable experience right before we had to go work at the Hyatt. Thank you :)
Becky K.,"Fairview Heights, IL",133,136,11,4.0,10/10/2014,It's cheesecake factory! I love their apps and cheesecake. This location was particularly lovely and the service was great. I got a blueberry mojito which was amazing!
Holly S.,"Englewood, CO",14,65,3,3.0,8/11/2014,"Update: The Cheesecake Factory corporate has followed up with us, offered a sincere apology and $100 gift card for the incident."
Jason M.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,18,2,1.0,6/25/2014,Just waited an hour for 2 burnt shrimp entries. The manager did not even come over until the end to address the poor quality food when we complained. They took it off our bill and provided a slice of cheese cake. Somehow they think this was good customer service.  I will be sure to let their corporate executives know of our dissatisfaction in Calabasas the next time I see them. But now I need to find food somewhere else in the area.
Jennifer G.,"Poway, CA",52,98,40,3.0,11/16/2014,"As always a lovely atmosphere, and service was on point (at first) as we only waited 2 minutes to be seated. Great selection and options for Cheesecake, they definitely live up to their name. The grilled cheese and fruit on the kids menu was good. We had a lovely time hanging out as a family on their large booths that seat 7-8ppl. The lemon meringue cheesecake was amazing as well as the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Just be careful when you switch servers because our bill had an extra wine on it that the previous server forgot to remove. When I told our waiter she questioned me as if I were lying (not cool) and that cost a star but overall it was good. Love this new little area too! Can you also make it a little cooler in the restaurant, it was a little warm."
Allen C.,"San Diego, CA",146,22,7,3.0,11/27/2014,I ordered the Cuban sandwich is was delicious.  The pork and ham was thinly sliced with just the right amount of mustard.  I also got the chicken tortilla soup which was pretty nasty.  The soup was really thick like a puree with loads of leftover rice inside.  My coworker said the soup may have been super thick because it wasnt properly heated.
Ric B.,"San Diego, CA",55,73,,4.0,4/12/2015,"Compared to other CF locations, this one is similarly large and always busy.  The food is consistently great and the service is typically very good, although sometimes it does feel understaffed."
Andrew K.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/12/2016,"Excellent management!!  Manager noticed our food was taking awhile, and as soon as our food came he apologized and offered us a free slice of cheesecake.  Great atmosphere and friendly servers.  Definitely will go back!"
Lisa S.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,,4.0,9/6/2014,Second time to this location.  Last visit we waited over 40 minutes on a weekend at around 700 so we went earlier on tonight (a Saturday) at 6 pm and had no wait.  It was packed and there was a wait for tables when we left at 7:30. Great and friendly service. Very attentive.  Our drinks and appetizers came out quickly.  A little bit delay with entrees.    I tried the new Salmon dish with couscous.  It was delicious.  Calamari appetizer had too many small pieces but good.  Very generous slice of Smores Cheesecake was delicious.  Only complaint - our booth smelled like bug/ant spray.
Jacqueline P.,"Malix, Switzerland",3,9,,4.0,8/20/2014,I liked the quattro fromaggi pasta i ordered. The size was huge which was great for a students appetite and budget. I will go back.
Goory AndFrank R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",41,7,5,4.0,11/9/2014,"Great service here! We had brunch here today on Sunday and was very good! Dinner was excellent as well, food was served in 5 mins!"
James B.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,24,,2.0,12/27/2015,"Okay, I have really tried to like The Cheesecake Factory...really. Being popularized by the show The Big Bang Theory and the fact that the original restaurant was developed by a couple from my hometown-Detroit, I really did want to like it. However after trying the San Diego restaurant twice, Las Vegas at the Forum in Caesars twice, and Downtown Salt Lake City twice, I've come to the conclusion that The Cheesecake Factory restaurants are just a pretty place to go for a piece of cheesecake and a cup of coffee - that's about it. There really is little to no substance to these restaurants. No soul as some may say. The food is always less than mediocre, and service is hit & miss. To add insult to injury, you then end up paying a fairly hefty cost for a less than mediocre experience. My suggestion is if you are craving Asian food, go to a good Asian restaurant, Italian, find a great Italian place, hamburger - the same. As well as seafood, Cajun, Mediterranean, and breakfast... You'd be better off finding a local restaurant that specializes in these cuisines."
Madison B.,"Phoenix, AZ",10,3,9,5.0,10/27/2014,"Came here for my two year anniversary with my husband an Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint! Excellent service from our hotty waitress, Jillian and the food was delicious! We love seaport village and we love Cheesecake Factory!"
Tomas D.,"San Diego, CA",0,56,,5.0,6/26/2014,"Dinner for two at the bar.  It was during happy hour, every seat was taken (the whole bar area, not just the bar). Yet the service (Heather and James) was SUPERB.  Remember, it was VERY busy!  Makes you realize how crappy the service is at other places and what we often settle for as being ""good"".   We couldn't have been happier and will return often.  The food was delicious.  We ordered two full meals, but the HH apps (all $5) were being served around us and all looked great and not skimpy on the portions.   To put things in perspective, we've lived downtown for over 10 years, eat out average 3 times per week.  We've experienced almost all places downtown, as new places have come and gone.   I know it's a chain place, and I don't even like Cheesecake, but this place is awesome!"
Yisel F.,"Orange, CA",0,96,261,1.0,7/7/2015,"I went here a couple weeks ago and was very disappointed. Not only with the food but the service as well.  I don't get it,  I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times to quite a number of them across Southern California and I've always been extremely satisfied with both food and service.  The location is great, I'll give them that. We came in after a very long day from the zoo and I picked this place because the food is always good. Well, walking in we decided to dine in the bar area since there was seating right away. We had to wait about 10minutes before someone that was working that area came to get our drink order. We then waiting another 15 minutes for the server to come back and take our order. We ordered the appetizer shrimp and that was bland. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and that was extremely bland, no flavor. The shrimp on this plate was a little hard and our food was tepid. That there told me that the food was probably sitting on the counter for awhile because it took forever to get our food.  We didn't complain because we were starving and figured it would take forever to get another plate. I will not be going back here in awhile if at all. Such a disappointment.  I remember in the past always walking out of one of these restaurants with a smile on my face and an overall satisfaction with my food and service."
Phantom Era ..,"San Diego, CA",71,55,38,3.0,11/16/2014,"Wow amazing cheesecake . Definitely every fat kid's dream! Great service for the most part except for a accidental charge on the bill , & the waitresses horrible attitude when the situation was identified . Oddly enough the temperature in the facility was somewhat hot . Bring a good crowd with you , because the service is not up to par . Overall, it was  a gorgeous venue & a great location in respects to the area for a date or family get together."
Charles C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/1/2014,"Worst service ever.   From when we were seated (at opening) we were not served our food for another 55 minutes.  A child serving came out 30 minutes before that.  The manager comped a cheesecake and the child's meal but the most annoying aspect was the waiter provided no update on the food delivery delay, or any check on our table. After the manager had apologized for the delay the waiter later proceeded to explain that 45 minutes from taking the order to food delivery was 'acceptable' within their food service policy.  SERIOUSLY!!!"
Kristine D.,"San Diego, CA",13,35,1,1.0,10/2/2014,"This location totally SUCKS! The service is terrible and so is the food. Next time I'll drive up to Mira Mesa. We came here on a Sunday evening, they weren't extremely busy, and the service, food, and drinks were still off. I think maybe the staff is over dealing with all the tourists at this location. Management and corporate: time to reevaluate! Send in some ""secret shoppers""."
Alexandra Linette S.,"San Diego, CA",128,108,321,5.0,4/22/2014,I love the location! It's perfectly a block away from where I live! (Near embassy suites) I always call ahead to skip the lines that they normally have. However when I did  eat at cheesecake it's always busy ... However the staff does a great job keeping up with the craziness. I recommend the buffalo blast ! Amazing!!!
