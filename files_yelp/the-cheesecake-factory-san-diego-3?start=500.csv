Nina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,407,1100,3.0,9/16/2014,"The waiter was just plainly not in a good mood, his service was just off and for some reason he kept insisting on starting a conversation 10 feet away  from the table"
Leila A.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,20,4,5.0,10/2/2015,I'm sorry but I know there's so much people ratted on this fab restaurant but YOU GUYS ARE FAKE! Yeah I see you eating there and enjoying their complimentary freshly bake breads....hmmmp and you guys even ask for more. So don't complain and just give this place 2 star. I love love Cheesecake Factory. They serve big portions and usually I can only eat a third of it...so it's good as I can bring home my doggie bag for work the next day. Oh yeah that mango cheesecake is just fab! It's hard staying kinny on this place but I would trade this place in a heartbeat for any restaurant that serves 2 tablespoons of main entree; art or not my tummy will be going home sobbing in bed of starvation. So pls DON't come acting like you don't like the place as I see you guys can't even walk to your car of tummy fullness; ahaaah.. I hear it too: blowing gasses off as you exit the back door. Pls spare my appetite! Rudeness gracious. That bulges I mean above the bulges obviously showing how much you love the place. If you're in denial! You either suffering from amnesia or going demented; better start taking Aricept  it might help. So Ciao
Alison K.,"San Diego, CA",289,28,15,5.0,10/26/2014,"Amazing time! Today, there was absolutely no wait tonight and although service was a little slow, it allowed my family and I to have many good conversations. My first experience was well worth it."
Tere J.,"Bonita, CA",50,5,1,1.0,5/3/2014,The customer service is horrible and the wait is long to get your food. Literally 2 hours! Don't come here if you have a life you want to enjoy.
Maria H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,2.0,7/9/2015,"So let me start by saying I have always been a big Fan of the Cheesecake Factory. While visiting San Diego 7/7/2015 we walked across the street from our hotel to this location. We sat outside, simply lovely. Our waitress was supposed to be the very attractive platinum blonde lady  (don't know her name ) Well lets just say she acted as if we were invisible. She passed us several times and never greeted us. She assisted everyone else around us and continued to ignore my family of four. Finally about 20- 30 min later another waiter by the name Arturo felt sorry for us and assisted us. The food was great as always And Arturo was AMAZING. But the experience had me wondering if the problem was due to the fact that we are an African American family and she felt she was not going to be tipped well. Anyway Arturo received a  $30 tip and our thanks."
Scott O.,"Rochester, MN",3,60,31,4.0,10/21/2014,"A typical experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  Despite other reviews suggesting service is terrible, our party of 4 had an outstanding server.  The patio outside offered a great ambiance.   Food is typical and reasonably priced for the portions (which continue to be quite large).  Cheesecake options aplenty and did not disappoint."
Linda K.,"Ontario, CA",66,28,5,1.0,3/23/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory but service here was horrible! Cold bread, food took awhile, appetizer was burnt, food came out incomplete and requested more sauce and brought it our after I finished my meal. It's closing so this place is not packed at all for all these issues to come.... Not sure what happened but this is the first time I've ever been disappointed by Cheesecake Factory.... Smh...."
Brian R.,"Chino Hills, CA",90,38,49,4.0,8/16/2014,"menu is cool. and its always nice to go some place a little fancy looking. Food is good and even if the get it wrong or food not hot enough they fix it with a smile. so always tip your waiter, they never try to ruin your meal on purpose! lol"
Paul W.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/20/2015,"My wife and I ubered to the harbor island location fom PB with $100 in gift cards in hand.  We've never been.   Saw good reviews so thought why not.  We ordered drinks. I got a Stone and the wife ordered a Margarita.  Turned out to be the best part of the meal.  My wife ordered the Scampi and Steak Diane combo and added a side salad.  I asked how the Ribeye was and our server said it was excellent so I went with that, medium rare, but subbed the fries for a side salad. 15 minutes later our server returned to inform us that they had no greens and if it would be okay to make our salads with just romaine.  We said that would be fine as we had been there quite a while already.  10 minutes later she arrived with one salad.  The other would be there soon.  5 minutes later the other salad arrived.. They were both decent but hard to f-up a salad.  Our meals finally arrived.  My Ribeye was tiny and WAY overcooked.    The texture was similar to my Doc Martin.  Aweful!  My wife liked her Scampi and the potatoes were decent, but the Diane was really bad.  Probably could have used the steak medallions as ninja stars.  They were that tough and flavorless.  CHEESECAKE FACTORY-Don't sell steak if you suck at steak.  Stick to the overly sauced chicken BS. Good thing it was basically free.  Won't be back."
Blake H.,"San Diego, CA",145,2,,5.0,6/13/2014,"EXCELLENT customer service! Katherine was our server and Gabriel, the manager, I think.. Were so amazing and nice. This place strives to have excellent customer service and they have succeeded."
Stephanie O.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/15/2015,SUPER UNPROFESSIONAL service. The waiter was a complete asshole. Came back questioning us about the tip and then went off about the amount he received. The management didn't really care about his rudeness. Won't be going back there ever again. OMG
Nina V.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2015,"There was hair in our food, lipstick on the tea glass, the pizza was nasty, the sugar was nasty and there was a waiter on his cell phone that looked like he was recording us."
Chris M.,"Redding, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/16/2015,Phil was a great server!hansome hilarious very modest(almost shy) ;).thanks for the laughs and great food!
Julie B.,"Corona, CA",9,15,,4.0,8/2/2014,"Server, Erin D redeemed our visit. At first we were told our party of 8 would need to wait 20 min  for our table because they were clearing it and cleaning it for us. They took all 20 min to do so, it sat there cleaned for about 10 of it though. We then were seated finally, asked for bread right away and that came right away and we waited for about 10-15 min for someone to come. Finally Erin came and apologized profusely for having us wait, she wasn't on yet. Of course the manager didn't tell us that. That would have helped. Our food and service was great after she came. The manager came over at the end of our meal and offered us a couple of pieces of cheesecake for having to wait. I told him in the future maybe he could tell people when a server isn't on yet and he told me oh no that wasn't it, she was on. Ok whatever, the visit was redeemed altogether."
Jessica H.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,4.0,3/28/2014,"For those who are surprised by there being no parking, really?? It's downtown, there is no parking anywhere. So don't come here from the suburbs with your giant SUV then complain that you had to pay for parking. Take the trolley and walk.  This Cheesecake Factory is just the same as the one in Fashion Valley, but less of a wait on the week nights, which is nice. Good food, nice staff. Had to wait a long time for brunch once, but no biggie- and we got our pancakes comped. :)"
Carmenlidia D.,"San Diego, CA",39,9,,1.0,9/26/2015,"all the food is nasty! we were a table of 7 none of us were satisfied with our food, waste of money! only good this was the costumer service."
Ashley L.,"Spring Valley, CA",5,17,,5.0,1/19/2014,Great Happy Hour!! Food was delicious and service was awesome. Love the new location! Would go there again in a heartbeat.
Sean C.,"San Diego, CA",57,192,11,3.0,2/26/2014,"It's The Cheesecake Factory. Okay food, mediocre service, large portions and fair prices. If looking to cram your daily caloric intake into 3/4 of 1 meal, this is your spot."
Juan V.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",17,3,,5.0,7/12/2014,We love coming to this location cause the waiting for a table isn't to long. Service is always great. Food is good.  We are definitely coming back again.  The only thing that sucks is the parking.
Daniel M.,"San Diego, CA",31,47,28,2.0,12/12/2013,"First, I will say the building remodel is beautiful.  The whole complex has been basically rebuilt and it looks great.  We went there on a Tuesday evening, around 6:00pm.  We got right in without a wait, and then we sat.  And sat.  And sat.  Finally our server came over, took our drink order, brought our drinks out to us, and then we sat.  And sat.  And sat.  It wasn't busy at all, so I'm not sure why everything took so long (about 45 minutes to get our food once the order got placed).  But the biggest shocker to me was THEY DID NOT OFFER US DESSERT!  Our server dropped the check, told us to have a good night, and he was gone.  Hello....cheesecake please!  This location has a LOT of work to do on their service.  It feels like they rushed to open before their staff was fully trained.  I'll give it another shot in a couple of months and maybe I will be able to give more than 2 stars."
