Jenny N.,"Riverbank, CA",0,8,3,4.0,7/5/2014,Food was delicious. Staff was friendly and attentive. There was a long wait (30-40 min) but in my opinion the wait was worth it.
Tonia M.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,6,1,4.0,9/13/2015,"Busy, but fair service. Bar was slow. Actually, Dan was good. Salmon and scampi was excellent."
Cyn T.,"San Diego, CA",171,94,14,5.0,5/3/2014,"Best location ever.Staff members are very friendly (Dawn, Dustin) I will be asking to sit in their section my next visit!!!"
Fred L.,"San Diego, CA",47,100,144,4.0,4/16/2014,This was a great place to stop for desert. I had the Mango Key lime cheese cake. It was the perfect choice. Although I saw some really interesting plates go by. It makes you want to try everything. The ambiance is wonderful. I think it my favorite of all the other stores. They really put some thought and pride into designing the dining room. You really can't go wrong with any choice you make. A true dining delight.
Yogi S.,"San Diego, CA",22,62,26,4.0,5/15/2014,Great variety in veggie options.  The service was bad mainly because the waiter was pretty rude.
Kat N.,"Chula Vista, CA",51,5,3,2.0,9/13/2014,"First of, let me just say that if you're looking for good service, then your best bet is to go elsewhere. The hostess and servers have no customer service skills whatsoever. With that said, the ambience at this location is the same you'd find at others from this chain - which is nothing special despite it's great location. We started off with fried calamari. The calamari was decent but the sauces were straight up from a bottle. That ""garlic sauce"" was definitely tartar sauce and I'm pretty sure they carry that same brand at my local grocery store. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, it tasted like soy sauce and was really gross. My husband had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. He complained that the chicken was over-breaded but otherwise moist and tender. The portions were both large. I also had a glass of Moscato, not generously poured. My husband had Hennessy on the rocks and was given a pretty good amount. Overall, we won't be visiting this location again, nor will we be ordering the same entrees.  2 stars for location."
Jessica G.,"Chula Vista, CA",87,27,130,4.0,6/6/2014,"Ok the restaurant is crazy packed and a long wait even during the week...food was good BUT the calamari was better than most restaurants I've ever tried it at!! delish fresh, crispy and tangy"
Marilyn W.,"El Cajon, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/16/2015,"The Cheese cake factory by seaport village can not do ""Keylime"" cheesecake well at all...it was loose and didn't taste like a cheesecake at all. If you have a taste for Keylime Cheesecake, go to COSTCO!!!!!!"
J S.,"Las Cruces, NM",3,71,,2.0,5/3/2014,"Mediocre at best. Food: average to bleh.  Atmosphere: FREEZING.  Service, inattentive and slow, albeit friendly when he did stop by.  But the food was nothing special at all.  I wouldn't go back, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
Angela P.,"San Diego, CA",8,105,31,3.0,3/23/2014,"I've always loved the menu at The Cheesecake Factory and strive to try something new each time.  This is our first visit to the HQ location and the restaurant is just as beautiful and laid out well as the others. We got there a little past lunchtime, around 1230 pm and only had to wait for about 10 minutes to be seated.  We received our drinks and bread right away and the waitress took our order in a timely fashion.  The problem is that the food got lost somewhere...45 minutes later, we were hunting down a manager to find out what was going on.  It wasn't the waitress' fault and she apologized a couple of times for the delay, so we didn't give her any grief.  But it was a business lunch before a meeting and we didn't think it would take so long.  By the time the manager brought out the food, we had to get the check so we didn't have to wait on that as well.  We only had 15 minutes to scarf down our food (which was great, but about lukewarm in temperature, which led us to believe it had been ready but sitting for awhile).  The manager was nice enough and comp'd our drinks, which saved us about $8, but it was disappointing to not be able to sit and enjoy the food at a slower pace. We told the manager we would return and we meant that.  I believe in giving people second chances, including businesses, so I'm certain I will eat at the this location again."
Scott H.,"Escondido, CA",23,7,,4.0,7/25/2015,"Food was worth the wait for a table.  Great menu.  Everything from pasta to seafood to steaks.....etc.  On yeah, the best cheesecake in San Diego.  Pricing is very affordable for this quality of food and service.  Our thanks to our server Ashley for helping to make our experience an enjoyable one!"
Lissette G.,"Imperial Beach, CA",47,47,50,5.0,3/4/2014,"Excellent location! wonderful service! Michelle was my server, she was on top of everything thank you for the plesent expierence. Parking in that area is always an issue,  park in the Seaport Village parking lot, they will valadate your parking you still pay to park but not as much."
Bells E.,"El Cajon, CA",5,12,1,4.0,7/20/2014,"I went here last for girls night. I loved mostly everything about this place. There was a wait time but I got there when we were getting seated. We were seated outside and I loved the ambiance. The food was amazing, really big portions which I appreciated. Our waitress was friendly.. not the best but overall it was pretty good service."
Ant B.,"San Diego, CA",211,7,,2.0,12/22/2013,I was expecting the same great service as I have received from other locations but it was totally opposite from this location.  Let's just say we came to this place expecting to leave happy but we left upset about our service.  Not looking forward to eating at this location again.
Bob C.,"San Diego, CA",0,65,,2.0,12/21/2013,"All of my previous experiences at Cheesecake Factory in other locations have been positive. Two experiences at the new location have not been as good. Not sure if there's a learning curve at this new location or if they hired too many new employees without balancing the staff with experienced employees. The service on both occasions was very poor. Both times were not very busy yet we experienced very long waits for ordering, food delivery and closing out the check.  Additionally, the food was good, but not the usual standard. I am hopeful the management makes the appropriate changes to improve customer service and food quality."
Gerald D.,"San Diego, CA",13,71,30,4.0,3/2/2014,Love this new location next to Seaport Village called the Headquarters SD. Friendly service and the food is what you usually expect from Cheesecake Factory.
Mina P.,"San Diego, CA",4,15,47,2.0,3/26/2014,Parking. .. what parking. .. food was ok... not like the fashion valley location... on the plus side the cheesecake was delicious like always.
Kathy W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,44,,2.0,5/16/2015,This Cheesecake Factory has the worst service ever! They are very understaffed.
John N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/11/2015,"I went here couple months ago and was literally forgotten. After I ordered my food, I noticed that there was no one at my side of the restaurant. It must've been about 45 minutes before I saw someone pass by and they looked at table with a surprised look. The waitress then said the food was on the way and I waited another 30 minutes. Absolutely terrible service and shame on the entire staff for not even noticing they had a customer after the fact that I ordered my food. This place is an absolute shame to the Cheesecake Factory franchise."
Giovanni M.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,2,3.0,5/9/2014,"This place is not as I good as I thought, it's  good, but not as much as it is expected, the service is great the cheesecakes are exquisite. Not a bad place to go, but the good is not as good as it's price."
