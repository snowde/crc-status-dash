Monica C.,"San Gabriel, CA",139,25,3,1.0,4/9/2014,"Went there this evening...I was not impressed at all! The Tex Mex egg rolls were  deep fried to the max, my bistro shrimp pasta was tasteless,the pasta was hard not even al dente, and the kids chicken strips were also way over cooked and to top it all off we saw a huge RAT cross our paths into the guests in the outside patio...Parking was not a problem :)"
Cristina P.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/14/2015,"There were more flies at our dinner here than I've seen during hikes in the woods. I counted 10 flies in a 45 min period and I know they were different flies because my boyfriend kept killing them... I ordered the fish tacos and the tortilla was so tough it was uneatable. I always drink margaritas and I didn't taste any alcohol in my drink...it just tasted like plain margarita mix. The desserts are good but if there are that many flies in the restaurant I wonder how many are in the kitchen. They keep the lights low and the flies are tiny, so you don't see them until they are right in front of you....but it was gross and I won't go here again...I was extra disappointed because the prices were really high."
Yen S.,"Little Italy, San Diego, CA",279,9,31,1.0,3/30/2014,We were excited that they opened a downtown location but surprised that they don't allow dogs in their patio seating area. All restaurants in downtown have patio seatings to accommodate pets. We went to Puesto instead.
Robin P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",24,10,,2.0,12/15/2013,"The food here was fine. I've had better at other Cheesecake Factories, but I've also had worse. There were a couple of key issues with our visit, though. First of all, while waiting outside for our table, the smell from the natural gas heaters was so foul that most of our group was covering our noses. The bigger problem, though, was that the waitstaff had so much trouble splitting our bill among six credit cards that it took an hour and 4 tries running the checks for us to get out of there. I wouldn't go back with a group."
La Toya K.,"Menlo Park, CA",4,29,6,3.0,2/27/2015,just OK...wouldnt go back because of the price and the quality dont match! service was nice and the people are friendly
Jessica L.,"San Diego, CA",5,5,2,2.0,3/15/2014,"This was our first visit to the Seaport Village Headquarters location. My husband & I are big fans of The Cheesecake Factory and frequent other locations. However, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. Let me start by saying thay I was a server for 7 years and have a lot of empathy for people in this line of work but this was just too much. First, I order the 4 cheese pasta with alfredo instead of marinara sauce. This has never been a problem before but he tells me they can't do it. He tries to explain but he's not making sense. Maybe there's something I'm missing but the only ingredients are cheese, sauce, and noodles, seems pretty easy to modify.  Anyway I tell him no problem, I will have something else instead.  Cut to 25 minutes later and we have just now been offered bread. Moments after he sets it down our entrees arrive. But wait, we ordered an appetizer, where is that? Wouldn't you know another 2 minutes go by and it shows up but we tell them we are already eating our main courses and don't want it anymore. They come back and offer to wrap it up to go and take it off of our bill, we say thank you. Next the manager comes up to apologize. He's very nice and we explain that we know it's a new location with presumably new servers and that everything is fine. And it would have been except things continued to go downhill. Neither of our drinks were refilled the entire time and when we finally paid our bill he ran it for the wrong table! Now I will be carrying a balance on my credit card for a couple of days until the void goes through. My husband and I smiled and didn't cause a fit because we both worked in customer service industries for a long time and didn't want to drag this poor kid through the mud BUT after getting home and seeing my take out (picture below) I had to write in. Granted, someone else packaged our appetizer (Thai lettuce wraps) and went we got home I noticed the sauces leaking ALL OVER the bag and onto the floor of our car. Well I open it up to see that instead of putting the sauce in plastic to-go ramekins they just threw the ones from the restaurant right in there with no lids! Who does that?! That's a huge cost for the restaurant and I'm SURE that's not the way they are supposed to package their to go items. Needless to say, we won't be going back. We were having a great day and as trivial as it seems, this put a damper on it. When you're hungry and spending money you at least expect average service, this fell far below that."
Ben S.,"Washington, DC",431,125,24,4.0,12/12/2013,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and this new location really hits the spot. It's a great addition to the Seaport Village area and it's big enough to never be crowded!  We took a party of 20 here for a work lunch and they had a TON of servers waiting on us hand and foot.  The only gripe I have about this place is that my seared ahi salad took the longest to come out.  It's literally raw vegetables and nearly raw fish. ZERO preparation time but yet I waited 30 minutes after the first dish arrived? Weird.  The cheesecake menu kind of made up for it though with the carrot cake cheesecake (half carrot cake, half carrot cake cheese cake, mixed together. cream cheese icing. HEAVEN).  I'm sure once this place picks up and the staff gets more comfortable everything will run smoothly.  I will just have to keep checking back to make sure!"
Eric H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/3/2014,This was the worst experience I've ever had. It took us a party of 2 an hour for a table. The service was shitty. They run out of food on their menu. When we got our food they forgot my GF fires and the food was below average
Gerg P.,"Border, CA",1,139,11,1.0,9/30/2014,"Not the first time we've been to a CF, but first and LAST time at this location.  We came here for a cheese cake take out.  Sure no greeting at the door, looked like mass confusion inside, made our way over to the cake display case, picked out 2 flavors and went to the counter, no greeting there either, waitress gave us the cold state until we askeD if she COULD HELP US!  GHETTO!    Stated the two flavors, and the waitress went over to another ""fridge"" and started to take out some ""older"" slice all by itself,  we asked why not the ""FRESH CAKE""  inside the real display case, her reply it's all the same.....OH SURE!!  We stressed, ""no we want the fresh cake"",  waitress was reluctant, we were about ready to demand our payment back, and waitress gave in, DUH GHETTO!  Cake was crappy, dry, no flavor, almost like it was previously made and frozen then defrosted, hey maybe it was!!  Anyway this place is GHETTO!"
Mychal L.,"Long Beach, CA",379,189,464,4.0,1/28/2014,It's your usual Cheesecake Factory in terms of food. No surprises. The location is really nice and the atmosphere is nice as well . Parking is plentiful even though they charge . You can get your parking validated which saves you a few bucks . I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and was surprised to find no sauce on it which was weird but it still tasted good .
Jeff F.,"San Diego, CA",16,66,39,4.0,12/15/2013,"This establishment deserves 4 stars!  Everything I order here is undeniably palatable. My favorites are the catfish, Tex Mex egg rolls, miso salmon and white chocolate cheesecake. The servers are very attentive and friendly."
Kevin L.,"San Diego, CA",49,3,5,4.0,3/23/2014,This place never lets you down! Amazing food amazing desserts great service friendly staff. The one downfall is you still have to pay for parking to go to this place even if you validate your ticket you still have to pay $3 to park. I think that should be fixed. Absolutely off the chain delicious! Not nutritious but awesome!
Fran H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,8,,5.0,4/26/2015,"My granddaughter and her friends from San Diego State University went there last night to celebrate her birthday.  We're in Florida so we arranged the dinner with Richard, the manager.  We called him every day for a week t make sure everything was going to go smoothly.  He checked on them throughout the evening, gave them a wonderful server who also goes to SDSU, joked with them and made her birthday even more enjoyable!  She couldn't say enough about him when I spoke to her this morning.  Of course, the food is always excellent at The Cheesecake Factory, but Richard made the evening a lasting memory.  Thank you so much, Richard.  We're looking forward to meeting you when we visit San Diego and dine at The Cheesecake!"
T K.,"Durham, NC",0,27,7,3.0,4/18/2014,"Are lunch here with a client... Typical Cheese Cake Factory, nothing special other then the patio out front. Too much noise there with all the traffic and construction."
Steve C.,"San Diego, CA",1,9,1,1.0,7/17/2014,"Today, I took a few guys in my office to The Cheesecake Factory on Harbor Drive. We arrived and were seated within ten minutes. Thirty minutes went by after we ordered our meals without food. At 45 minutes, our waiter asked if we wanted more bread and suggested we should order soup. After ONE HOUR AND TWENTY minutes, our food arrived. I had ordered the chicken enchiladas; they were cold when they got to me with a hot plate underneath them as if that was going to heat up the food. I called over the waiter and asked him if he could heat them up. He took the plate to the kitchen and 15 minutes later brought out what appeared to by my food except it looked like someone had eaten off the plate as the rice and beans were mixed together; mind you that I didn't even take a bite of those items. I was pretty aggravated and walked over to see the manager. The manager (Sean) stated that they were better than this and he was having a lot of issues with his servers and food preps. When my bill arrived, they had removed the chicken enchiladas as I refused to eat them but still charged me for the ice tea. I spent almost TWO hours there without food! This is absolutely the worse Cheesecake Factory. I also noticed several tables of customers who didn't have food. When my party arrived there were less than 20 people eating at the restaurant. DON'T GO THERE!"
Peter D.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,5/16/2014,"To my 35,000 neighbors who live downtown: Do yourself a favor and avoid at all cost going to the new Cheesecake Factory at the Headquarters at Sea Port Village. This location is a poor representation of The Cheesecake Factory. I live downtown since 2003 and on Thursday May 15, 2014 at around 5:30 pm my son, grandson, granddaughter and I went to this place and our experience was horrible. We walked in, told the front person party of 4 please and were told it would just be a minute. We were giving a pager and found this to be odd as the place was just about empty. After waiting about 15 minutes I went back to the front desk and asked why we were not been seated as there were lots of empty tables. Their answer was that they did not have enough servers. After waiting a few more minutes our pager went off and we went to the front desk hoping to be seated now. But no luck, we were told the pager went off by mistake. We complaint to the manger on duty, Ruben Paraza, Executive Kitchen Manager, and found him to be worst manager I have ever seen. He was very rude, unapologetic and had poor social skills. We decided to spend our money somewhere else and walked out."
Joshua A.,"Escondido, CA",0,20,2,5.0,2/21/2015,"My wife and 2 boys and I ate dinner here last night around 6pm.  The parking was interesting, but it is the Seaport Village.  Our server (Erin), was FANTASTIC!  She was on spot with everything.   The food was really good, and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake was a delight.  She even heard my youngest son mention it was my wife's birthday, so she wrote happy birthday in chocolate on the plate and added sprinkles and whipped cream.  We had a fabulous time and the staff was great.  My return to the United States has been highlighted by our dinner at this restaurant!!!"
L N.,"Ogden, UT",0,2,,2.0,3/29/2015,Food was ok. A bit greasy. Service was horrendous.  We were there 30 minutes and didn't even get bread. Had to chase our waitress down to get refills.
Colleen C.,"San Diego, CA",0,292,8,5.0,11/14/2013,"What a pleasant afternoon enjoying the Training Session for this successful chain.  The location is superb and outdoors on a nice day is a must (indoors is so noisy).  Granted, soft openings bring out more smiles, accommodations, bending over backwards.  Avocado Eggrolls were rich and had a yummy dipping sauce.  Loved the Luau Salad.  Portions, as anyone who has been to a CF, are beyond enormous.  OK, have to say that my French fries were not extra crispy, as requested.  All the positives (including our very personable server, Tatiana) made this minor and I didn't even complain.  Everyone left with bags (that is plural) of leftovers.  With the Convention Center, tourists and CF fans, this will be a major winner!"
Sonia L.,"El Cajon, CA",0,8,7,1.0,3/9/2014,"The food was OK the salad needed more dressing the sandwich took around 40 minutes to arrive overall the service was bad I think the waitress dirent like us because he wasn't being very nice to us I had to ask for the complimentary bread an his answer was that he was waiting for it but the table next to us did got some an we were there before them , well I will never go to this cheese cake factory again"
