Amanda H.,"University City, San Diego, CA",17,9,2,3.0,12/6/2013,The location is great and the actual restaurant is very pretty. Food is decent. Menu is way to big and overwhelming. Service was horrible! Our drinks and bread came out at same time as food. Soup was cold. Also you have to pay for parking even after validation. I will not be in a hurry to return here. Really disappointed since this restaurant seems to be so popular.
Bryan R.,"Fullerton, CA",52,2,1,2.0,8/16/2014,"My family of 5 visited here on a recent trip to San Diego. We were told that the wait would be 25 mins., but we were sat after only 15 mins. We arrived at our table and my wife went to sit down and there was water spilled all over the floor so we asked to have it cleaned. Our waiter finally came by and took our drink orders and said he would bring out some bread. We waited about 15 mins and got some bread, no drinks. We ate all if the bread and still no drinks. The waiter came by and said they were out of glasses because they were in the dishwasher. My son ordered a hamburger well done and was told that would be 20 mins. We said ok. It came to us with red in the middle. My everything pizza was missing onions and peppers. The drinks were served in their water mugs. And the waiter only one time refilled my wife's iced tea. None of us got refills. We complained and were offered 2 free cheesecakes. Whoop dee do. This place doesn't serve good food and service is terrible."
Lisa B.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",0,1,,4.0,1/1/2014,"I had to comment on the customer service. My family took an order to go to eat at our hotel. When they arrived with the food, we realized one of our cheesecakes was missing. I called the restaurant and the person who answered was concerned. He asked where we were and personally delivered it to the hotel. That is the kind of service that you always hope you receive. Thank you to the manager of that restaurant."
Vanessa G.,"Beaumont, CA",0,6,2,5.0,1/30/2015,"Great location! The patio is amazing,  especially in the summertime. The food is great. Our waiter named Robert was especially attentive and friendly.  I will definitley keep coming back."
Zack H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,,5.0,7/27/2014,We're from Phoenix and don't eat at The Cheesecake Factory too often but were starving after making the drive into San Diego and it was the first restaurant we came across being right next to our hotel. Dawn was our server and surprised one of us with an awesome seafood dish which I don't remember the name of. Service and food was excellent! Being that we always stay at the Hyatt - we will most likely return to the Cheesecake Factory again and hopefully have Dawn as our server again as well!
Art M.,"San Diego, CA",0,47,,3.0,12/5/2013,"Visited the new Cheesecake downtown. Very nice location and one of the coolest Cheesecakes i've been at, but service was very poor. The waiter wasn't knowledgable at all and un aware of the beer and margarita prices. It seems very odd that the menu has no prices on beer or alcohol drinks except for wine.  We asked for pricing and the waiter said to us""I'll check if this is a deal breaker"". After dinner we asked for some coffee with and he said it was getting freshly brewed. We waited and it never showed up and we finally just paid and left. This establishment needs some fine tuning!"
Carlos L.,"La Jolla, CA",3,16,,1.0,6/7/2014,"Worst experience ever, I've been here before and everything taste the same and it's overpriced for the fast food like food quality. We'll I was with my family and I ended up here again. We ordered and after 40 min waiting the waiter came up to our table saying it was gonna take longer so he offered us soups for everybody, I said what soup options do you have and he said just baked potato soup, I didn't feel like that so I asked for a salad instead and he said No, I was like Ok, a few minutes after he served the soups to the rest of the party he came with a salad and said here you go so you can be happy. We kept waiting and waiting and nothing, my dad got upset and said let's just go, so I tried looking for a manager to briefly explain and ask for the check (me and my dad had one beer each) the manager said we can get the food right now if you want it's actually ready (after 1 hour) we just really wanted to go and I said that to the manager so he brought the check for the beers $14, my dad paid for them and said ""If this was a nice restaurant a manager won't even let us pay for the beers after what just happened"" and he didn't care. We paid and left. That's it. Never coming back!"
Junemy P.,"San Diego, CA",86,69,72,4.0,8/5/2014,"I never knew there was a Cheesecake Factory in seaport village! Goes to show that I'm always hiding in my cave. Can't complain about the wait time here. Since all cheesecake's make you wait forever and a day. It would be much better if they did reservations. We waited about 30 minutes and it was a good thing there were shops close to the restaurant to kill time. Did outdoor seating on a beautiful day, wasn't too hot, and the view of the harbor and skyscrapers are a plus. Really makes you feel like you're dining in San Diego. The service was awesome. Our server Christina (I hope that was her name) was super friendly, knowledgable, attentive, and such a happy person and a joy to be around. I really like those type of servers. Makes me feel like they really care about doing their job and giving their diners the best service. So you go girl! I usually get the chicken bellagio but I decided to try something new and I'm so mad that I didn't try the chicken Madeira sooner!! It's so damn good!!!! Better than the bellagio. Where have you been all my life?! Christina said it's very popular. It has 2 sautéed chicken breast with asparagus, melted mozzarella cheese covered with Madeira sauce, mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Words cannot describe how delicious everything was. Highly recommend this. If you haven't tried it, try it now. To end it all, I got the fresh banana cream cheesecake. I love cheesecake and I'm a huge fan of banana cream pie so I had to get this in one. It's amazing. Every bite was cherished. It's topped with a huge amount of Bavarian cream and sliced bananas. Made me go bananas."
Antonio R.,"San Diego, CA",5,5,1,5.0,2/16/2014,"Every time were at this mall we try to eat here and it's well worth the wait even when there busy, PF Changs gets really boring and at Cheesecake Factory you have a way bigger menu to choose from so there's something for everybody to pick. Me and my girlfriend shared a BQQ chicken salad and a ricotta flat bread which was bomb dot com! Our server was very helpful but forgot to mention dessert! It was all good we just walked to the bakery on the way out and I'm glad we did we ended up getting 2 desserts a lemon cello cream torte and a piece of carrot cake the cashier Kassandra E was extremely friendly and highly recommended the desserts since those were her favorite and I'm glad she did they were amazing! She super informative and gave us a good idea of what to try next time we eat there. She had us a "" Red velvet cheesecake "" yum we will be back soon  =)"
T B.,"San Diego, CA",3,23,2,1.0,12/12/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is just as bad as the rest. The food is TERRIBLE and the girl who greeted me at the door was just out right rude. I visited the fashion valley location 6 years ago and walked out because the service was so appalling, bad idea for trying it again. I would rather go have dinner at one of the restaurants in seaport village on the water with decent food and nice servers."
Tara H.,"Perris, CA",11,13,7,4.0,5/13/2014,"Had a really good experience here, a nice spacious restaurant.  Food was good as always.  We had the Bang Bang chicken with shrimp.  The service was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and made an effort with my 3 year old.  The only negative was the that the complimentary bread and butter were both cold...never understood why restaurants serve cold bread and butter.  Cold butter is hard to spread..."
pauline w.,"San Diego, CA",8,37,,2.0,10/20/2014,"Came here for breakfast on Sunday.  Waited about 15 minutes before anybody came and took our order.  The bottle of bubbly we ordered must have taken at least another 15 minutes to arrive, and then another 15 minutes or more before the food!   Very disappointed and don't think we will be back in a hurry.  I am surprised (with all the complaints on here about the slow service that mgmt. have not done something about this)."
Keara O.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",2,41,14,2.0,5/23/2015,"Where do I start? The fact that our bread arrived with our entree or that our entrees were cold and salty? To be honest, those issues would have been completely overlooked and forgiven if the manager actually cared when I complained about the BIG issue. We chose to sit at the bar which we know is not going to be a fine dining experience, but we did expect a comfortable dinner, at least. It's a Saturday night, jam packed and there's one empty seat at the bar. A couple comes up, the woman sits down and her date/boyfriend stands behind her. She tells him to grab a chair from a table and bring it to the bar. He does. . . There is literally NO extra room at the bar and he is now squishing me in between him and my boyfriend who is not a small guy (6'4). . . I couldn't even move my elbows to eat. Not only am I cramped, I have to listen to their inappropriate conversation for the rest of our dinner which consisted of their sex life and the word ""fuck"" in every sentence. I also had the pleasure of watching them makeout at the bar since we are conveniently seated across from mirrors. I complained to the manager and he gave me a half hearted apology. We are absolutely done with the Cheesecake Factory."
Richard H.,"Frisco, TX",0,10,,2.0,11/22/2013,"I expected more and I got less! This restaurant needs to improve in the kitchen dramatically. The service and the atmosphere was outstanding but the food was awful. My table waited over 40 minutes to get our food. I ate it in respect of the good service and tipped 20%. I might come back and have drinks at the bar but that's it. To run a successful restaurant, hire chefs not cooks from TJ."
Ali K.,"San Diego, CA",2,22,,1.0,2/11/2014,Ok first time here we just came to have cheese cake n some drinks we order tea and coffee wanted to sit at the booth they told us the section was closed I infested to sit they asked the manager said no it already started off bad anyways I ordered 3 cheese cake we only got two and I ordered tea hot water came  tea came after 5 min then I asked for 4 more honey they brought one and asked more never came back so im sorry but  service sucks here!!!
G C.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/15/2015,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for over 8 years and I love it, I always take my family and friends for their bday since the waiters always brings a giant delicious cheesecake on a big plate with happy bday written on it with a cantle on top where your waiter and a couple others come to your table and singe happy bday making it really special.  Well this didn't happen  tonight when I brought my boyfriend for his bday. We both had a delicious dinner  together, when we were done eating we ordered some cheesecake. After that I was starting to get  really excited for the happy bday surprise ""Cheesecake Factory style"", I even had my camera ready. Well when our waitress Monica J. got to the table she had his cheesecake on a regular plate with nothing written on it with a candle that she lid in front of him said a unsincered happy bday and left. I was in sock, really didn't know what to say or do. Even my boyfriend mentioned something about it. Monica really ruined his bday and our special night together. I'm not writing this review to tell you not to go to the Cheesecake Factory in Downtown but I'm writing to tell you that when you are going to celebrate a bday tell the hostess not to sit you in Monica J's sections."
Chris N.,"San Diego, CA",5,10,1,1.0,5/29/2014,We live in the neighborhood and this was the last HQ restaurant we tried since it is a chain but we have liked experiences at other CF's. This place has bad service and bad food. And management doesn't care. Won't come back.
Elise J.,"San Diego, CA",5,43,,5.0,12/7/2013,"Im shocked to see some of the negative reviews here! All I can say is I WISH it wasnt good!! I WISH I could say its just another ""PLASTIC"" restaurant...Because it is across the street from me and ...well, its the dang Cheesecake factory! We went for Happy Hour..the margaritas were nice and tasty..not much to rave about there but I ordered just one appetizer, the sweet tamale cakes. It was so huge I had to take the rest home ..Who takes their appetizer home??? But It was absolutely delicious! My husbands artichoke was unbelievable and huge!! These are only $5.00 at happy hour...get it while you can folks..they arent going to do this forever! Food is great! Service is perfect..love the nice easy music..lovely surroundings...its an A plus all around!"
Quincey Q.,"San Diego, CA",1,34,,4.0,4/28/2014,"Awesome place, great food, good service. Extremely customer service based and helpful."
April M.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/3/2014,"First off Cheesecake factory doesn't take reservations which is inconvenient to no end. So when my sisters prom rolled around and they decided to go to cheesecake factory we tried to make reservations. Well first we were told that we could only make reservations between 11:00 am and 11:30 am the day of. So we called and attempted to do just that. But when we spoke to them we were told that they do not take reservations. So on the day of, we got to the cheesecake factory  at 5:00 pm and the group was not seated until 6:45 pm. And then the waiter not only brought out several dishes that were not what was ordered but at least one of the kids in the group was not able to eat before prom thanks to their inability to properly serve their customers. Over all based on this experience I would definitely not return to this cheesecake factory location."
