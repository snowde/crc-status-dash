Landis S.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/2/2014,"Came here last night for date night. As always, The Cheesecake Factory was packed! I ordered the salmon special with capers and my boyfriend got a steak. The food took longer than expected, but our server David C kept us updated and informed of the progress so we never felt like we were forgotten about. When it came out it was well worth the wait and our heffs ""with a hint of banana flavor""(David said it was his favorite)kept us happy in the meantime! Of course the meal was huge, leaving us no room for dessert, but David  had our mouths watering when he described the pineapple upside down cheesecake...we had no choice but to indulge! Next time we come we'll make a request to sit with our same server again :)"
Den Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,,3.0,3/10/2014,"The food is great and therefore we visit the place often. The waiting times are outrageous so the estimates they tell should be doubled, combined with overloaded staff, totally ruining the experience."
Michael Q.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",12,46,2,5.0,4/8/2014,"last night was my second visit and i had a great time again!  i was sat on the patio (didn't know they had one) and it was really nice and quiet.  tina was or server and she was really cool, helpful, funny and help guide me to a decision.  kim & jenna delivered the food and they were super cool as well and even helped me when i made a mistake ordering.  i will definitely go back and ask to be sat with tina again.  keep up the good work guys!!"
Monica H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,2,1.0,4/7/2014,"Some of the poorest service I've ever seen. The waiter was good, however the manager was the worst I've ever seen. Unapologetic and poor social skills. Please don't promote Sean McGrath. Horrible horrible manager."
Veronica C.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/12/2014,"went to this place the other day and by far had the best service I have ever had all the years I've been going, i had a young man serving us with a cool mustache his name was jimmy. we asked him about his beer selection and he offered us one that he highly recommends  as well as some appetizers and entrees, gotta hand it to him he was on point!!  the guy has knowledge of the items which I find to be an important quality in a waiter the food did however take a bit long but we knew it wasn't his fault since he doesn't cook it, but he made up for it for constantly making sure we were good. he was funny kind and I will definently be back and asking for him as should everyone else plus u got a wicked cool mustache to look at. good job cheesecake in hiring this one, u need more like him"
J P.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/12/2014,"Our daughter wanted to come here for her birthday. Trust me, there are alot of great resturants in that area. But, it was her choise. For statrers 8 buck an hour to park. We were told a 45 min wait. Hour later, we were told few more minutes. 30 minutes later we were told there was 5 tables ahead of us. As we were standing there, the girl told someone else that there were 5 tables ahead of them? When we asked her about the 5 tables excuse, we got blown off. We were there waiting for 2 hours, paid 16 bucks for parking. I know its a tourist trap, but dont get taken in. There are some great places to eat around the corner. If you must eat there try Dennys, same food, no waiting."
Legion X.,"La Mesa, CA",21,6,4,1.0,2/24/2014,"Well i went here and the service was dookie. :( waited for a table for about an hour, told us our table was ready so we walked in and waited another 10 minutes to actually get seated. Asked for that famous bread that no one seems to get right away. We had to ask for it like 5 times and still didn't get it from our server. We had to ask another random lady that brought us our food if she can bring us bread, she brought it in like less then a minute. Let me also say that our food took forever to come, the lady and little daughter next to us got their food, ate, and left before we even got our food and we got seated before them. One of us asked for a refill of water, the server took the cup and never came back. Didn't have a drink for the rest of the meal. So we reminded him, where the refill was?? he acted confused, but finally brought it. At the end we ordered cheesecake to go. One of us was gonna pay for the meal, the other for the cheesecake. he ended up switching the cash and the card so the one who was going to pay for the cheesecake ended up paying for the overpriced meal, and the person who was gonna pay for the meal ended up getting the cheesecake bill. And might i add that he blamed us, said we messed up and put the cash in the wrong one. When in fact we made sure we didn't do that. Overall, he blamed the bad service on him having to wait on over 8 tables by himself. Poor guy, manager said he could've asked for help if he really needed it. Ended up getting the cheesecake for free, but please get more servers on the floor."
Chris E.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/30/2014,"We walked in on a Sunday at 530pm and were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. 35 mins later, (and no table)  we inqured and were told they had paged us already but we didn't show (which is not true, begin the experience by blaming the custmer, good call) we were than seated by a rude waitress who acted like it was an inconvenience for her to do so. 10 mins later when the server arrived we had to ask for water (must be because of the draught in CA huh?) We ordered and waited the usual 20 mins for food (after the appetizer came to early) only to have them bring the wrong thing for one of us (party of two, whew its a tough thing to get right) waited another 20 mins before the (Im guessing GM, Josh) came and had to save the day by apologizing and (after another 10 min wait) comped both our entrees. I appretiated him making it right, but the damage has been done. Overall, very poor experience,  not on par with the norm at other Cheesecake Factory's, poor service, long wait times and not really worth anyones time with the other great restaurants right next door. I will be passing on this location until service is up to par, and unfortunately can't reccomend this location to others. 2 stars because the food is good, but everyone knows that."
Matt B.,"San Diego, CA",6,61,5,1.0,12/29/2013,"Reached my limit tonight.  Called to place a to-go order and ""can I put you on a short hold?"" turned into over 10 minutes of a ""short hold"" before I gave up entirely and went somewhere else.  This sort of thing has happened to us at the Mission Valley location as well about every other time we try to place a to-go order. If you don't have the infrastructure to support to-go phone ordering, then just don't offer it.  After our gift card is spent at some point, I think I'm totally over Cheesecake Factory.  Love the food but the crowds and waiting and their inability to deal with it are just too much."
Andrea D.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/8/2014,"Had my husband's birthday dinner at this new location thinking we would receive a great experience but instead EVERYTHING went horrible since we walked in the door we waited 30 mins before even being offered a glass of water or even a HELLO! ! Second we had 6 different waiters which never introduced them selves,  third one of the pastas that we had order they forgot to add the Alfredo sauce which we waited 25 for our hamburger they also forgot the bacon and the 4 cheese pasta with chicken the chicken was raw and cold from the inside!!! I rather wait for a table at the other cheese cake factory and receive BETTER customer service and food that is made correctly and fully cooked!! I would never come back to this place ( 2 out of 7 people woke up with diarrhea)"
