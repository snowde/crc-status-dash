Jackie G.,"San Diego, CA",23,22,3,2.0,9/20/2017,"Came here about 2 weeks ago. My husband and I spend our date night's here but this last visit would be our last. My husband ordered the pepperoni pizza. He stopped away for a moment and the food was brought out. The pizza was Burnt! Like the pepperoni slices were as hard a chips. I requested it be taken back and be remade as my husband wasn't going to eat it that way. To my surprise, the server brought me another burnt pizza! I requested the manager who never introduced herself by name. She questioned if we have ever ordered pizza here and I politely explained to her that we had come to this location on several occasions and never did the pizza look so horrible. She just said well I'll take it off the bill and walked away. Idk what has gone wrong at this location but it's definitely not what it used to be."
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,4.0,4/12/2016,"Located at the Headquarters shopping Center of Seaport. I arrived after happy hour and was seated at a table nearby the bar area. I had a family next to me that came later with several younger children which was irritating. Started off with the stuffed mushroom appetizer followed by the chicken, shrimp and sausage  gumbo which were satisfying and yummy. I ordered dessert to go - White chocolate, macadamia cheesecake which I actually didn't care for. To rich and the crust was chewy - prefer the traditional graham cracker crust. I would stick with the regular cheesecake in the future but other then that all was positive. Service was solid from my waitress and I would  return to this location in the future. Definetely think I'll sit in the bar next time around to avoid the little ones."
John S.,"San Diego, CA",345,527,93,4.0,10/14/2016,"I don't really like reviewing National chains like Cheesecake Factory, but it's one of those places where you can take a large group, go on a first date comma take someone special comma and not have surprises about how the food or service is going to be. I'm local to this Cheesecake Factory comma but I realize that this one is there a tourist area of San Diego.  Typically when I travel I like to eat eat the food of the area so I avoid chains. But sometimes I don't want the adventure and I go for something that I know. The prices are predictable Venture one you're pretty familiar with the menu so you probably already have your favorites picked out. It also comes in handy when you're with a large group like a family picky eaters. Everyone will find something that they want and dessert is always awesome. Good place to go when you have a large party and or not sure what will suit the entire party."
Rebeca A.,"Oceanside, CA",1,39,11,2.0,9/15/2017,"This location really needs to get it together!!  the last time we came to this location, our appetizer arrived to our table COLD. This was 6 months ago. We decided to give this location another try and boy did I regret that decision. Next time I'm going to suck it up and drive to the Escondido one. Not once, not twice but three time when we tried to order food, they were out. Our kind and amazing waitress Stephanie apologized multiple times and brought us a list of foods they were out of. That list was TOO LONG. The hostess should've warned us about the shortage. This is just so unprofessional of a restaurant to pull. And our food wasn't even tasty. My crab dip tastes like nothing! I had to practically pour salt all over it to get it some flavor! The only part we enjoyed were the drinks! Besides that, were never ordering food from here ever again!"
Julie G.,"Imperial Beach, CA",17,5,,1.0,9/10/2017,Ordrered the shrimp scampi for $20 and got 5 shrimp over done. What more needs to be said...rip off
Jack J.,"Ecublens, Switzerland",0,25,,1.0,8/27/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have visited in So Cal.  I suspect many of the patrons are tourists or convention center attendees who either don't have the time to complain about the poor customer service, long wait, and poorly trained waiters or will ever visit this place again.  This terrible experience happened to me one evening in late May 2017 with a business colleague from overseas from Singapore who had heard about the famous Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  Seating - don't get stuck in back corner.  It was so dark we used the flashlight from the phone to read the menu.  No biggie.  We asked if they could turn on few more lights or bring more candles.  The waiter responded, ""this is the way it is..."".    She clearly could see that other patrons were having the same issue we were experiencing with poor lighting. Food - didn't live up to expectations.  Under cooked rice, overcooked shrimp.  None of us (party of 5) finished the food.  We left in disgust to go back to Hilton Bayfront hotel restaurant and bars.  Waiter - poor trained and zero personality.  If can't put a smile on for customers than you shouldn't be in customer service business."
Michelle K.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",160,15,6,1.0,9/3/2017,"I won't be coming back to this place. I ordered a beer, Caesar salad, fettuccine alfredo. My salad never came and when my pasta arrived, it was plain w/o alfredo. For being in the heart of downtown/ seaport village, this Cheesecake Factory isn't worth going to."
Ina G.,"San Diego, CA",28,43,3,5.0,10/7/2017,I came in today with my son. We stayed outside and Patty( Patricia) took care of us. The food was good as always and customer service was excellent. We will definitely come back here.
Walter C.,"Garden Grove, CA",52,54,16,5.0,10/9/2017,"Customer service is what its all about and we had a waiter that was on it! Even though the line was out the door, we got seated quickly and our food was hot and we were well taken care of. Another great location, and close to the water too!"
Sierra W.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,"The people giving this place 5 stars must have the patience of a saint!!! Me and my husband tried having a nice dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, we we're seated and waited to be helped. There were two servers in our section and we watched them pass us 15 times (that's not even a joke, we counted) and not once did they even look our way. The table right next to us got to order their food/cheesecake and the table in front of us even had their water topped off. Realizing that we were being ignored and feeling a little embarrassed, we got up and spoke to the manager. She was really kind and apologized, but we will not be returning."
Nirosha G.,"San Diego, CA",30,2,,1.0,9/1/2017,Not stroller or child friendly.... waited for 45 minutes ... and now have to wait another 20 minutes since my baby is sleeping in the stroller and cannot really leave the stroller behind  oops
Allyson M.,"Seattle, WA",189,669,394,3.0,10/3/2016,"My in-laws treated me to dinner here last night. We went to this location because my sister-in-law and her kids were staying at the Embassy Suites across the street. I thought perhaps it was just a rough night for our server, but based on the previous reviews, I guess this location truly is awful. - Lighting (or lack thereof): I'm happy to live in an age where practically everyone has a cellphone. Definitely came in handy when perusing the menu. - Messed Up Food Orders: My MIL is picky and usually has some complaint, but this time her complaints were truly legit. Some veggies were missing from her salad and the extra bowl she requested (she was splitting it with my FIL) took FOREVER to get to the table. My SIL ordered some fish tacos. Upon inspection  (using her phone, of course), she found there was no avocado in them. A small container was brought out before her kids graduated college. *Whew* - Rice: My MIL ordered a dish that came with rice; I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya but subbed pasta with rice. I noticed the rice in my jambalaya was dry, hard, and sticky. It was like the yucky stuff from the bottom of the pot. I was somewhat OK with it because my dish had sauce. My MIL, however, complained that the rice was not fluffy like she had had at other locations. The server came back with an equally unappetizing clump of rice. He said all they have is sticky rice, but he could swap for brown rice, mashed potatoes or veggies. The manager came out and apologized. She comped 2 slices of cheesecake for my MIL and SIL. Despite everything that went down, kudos to the servers for remaining friendly. I'm sure it must be tiring dealing with tourists and locals alike."
Sevitha N.,"San Mateo, CA",6,43,129,4.0,10/23/2016,"First of all, our server was excellent! The ice cream was very good. Those 2 are the only reasons I am giving 4 stars. The food was average! Nowadays, we don't expect much from places like Cheesecake Factory. Such an extensive menu but everything tastes average. And what is with the light menu? It has pretty much the same items from the regular menu but less of them. I ordered the lemon butter shrimp. But it came w the same amount of pasta. I am not a healthy eater but why offer them when even the portion size are the same! God, what is with the noise level!?!? It has to be 5 bells! Also, the freaking lighting! Why the heck do the restaurants think the dimmer the better?!? Anyway, I am happy they are around when we can't find anything local To eat for the kids."
Andrew P.,"Orange County, CA",509,711,317,4.0,6/1/2017,A very busy location. Located in downtown in between all the major hotels and walk from the convention center. Just like any other cheesecake factory however busier than most others because of the location. In spite of the busyness the service was still good and you got your food in a reasonable amount of time. The quality is consistent with all other locations. I would recommend this one.
Stephanie G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,140,145,3.0,5/31/2017,Ok so the food is great and the service is good. It's located near Seaport Village with plenty of other surrounding restaurants. It has a different vibe than other Cheesecake Factories. The service is friendly and genuine.
Roselvy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,55,91,5.0,10/14/2016,Came to this restaurant bc it was across the street to our hotel which was very convenient. Outside seating which was create bc it was a warm evening. We just had appetizers and drinks
Ryan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,70,13,1.0,3/5/2017,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  We came in for a table of two around 730pm on a Saturday.  We were told it would be a 35 minute wait and it was.  When we were seated, we waited ten minutes until we were forced to ask for our server, which turned out to be Theo.  Another ten minutes goes by until Theo finally addresses us.  It was at this point in time that we realize this was the same guy that had passed us at least 5 times without a simple ""hey there I'll be right with u"".  We were being ignored and we were annoyed.  We asked for the brown bread.  It was in the oven.  Another 25 minutes until we received water, bread, and wine. The chicken enchiladas were not good as it has a red sauce that is the opposite of tasty.  I ended up getting sick from these enchiladas. However the most annoying experience from this awful decision to go to this cheesecake location was waiting 30 minutes to pay the bill.  We asked Theo for the check.  15 minutes later, another server gives it to us and splits.  I even had my credit card ready and he still split.  I tracked down another server to pay and he runs it.  Instead of bringing us back the check, he tries to track down Theo to return it to us.  Another 15 minutes goes by until Theo is found. When somebody starts to waste my time, I get mad.  Because I've been a server for 8 years, I conjured up enough sympathy to produce a tip.   I will never be back, and I would recommend Theo to receive more training.  Most restaurants require a table to be approached within one minute of being sat.  I understand it was a Saturday night, but to have passed us 5 times while being ignored, was not only annoying, but completely unprofessional. I will never be back to this location.  I will recommend that every friend does not go to this location either."
Jennifer L.,"San Diego, CA",0,45,2,1.0,8/19/2017,"Placed a Postmates order for takeout; they gave me Shrimp Scampi/Steak Diane instead of Shrimp Scampi/Chicken Madeira combo. They forgot my pasta. They gave me the wrong cheesecake. Overall every single thing was wrong in this takeout order. What a horrible experience. I worked for this company years ago and their level of service was once phenomenal; a manager couldn't even be bothered to pick up the phone when I called about my order. I don't know if it's the location or if the entire company is going downhill, but with so much competition in the market you would think the company would be trying to stay on top."
Scott M.,"San Diego, CA",73,26,,1.0,10/27/2017,"I took a group of 10 colleagues here on consecutive days for a business lunch.  The service was excruciatingly slow, even though we arrived at 11:30 a.m.  No complaints with the food, just be prepared to wait a long time for water...order...iced tea...food...dessert menus...desserts...the bill.  Way, way too long.  My guess: understaffed because the restaurant is struggling in this location.  And bad service will seal its fate.  Will not be back.  Life's too short."
Adam S.,"Escondido, CA",86,200,135,3.0,2/13/2017,"Don't let the three stars  dissuade you from coming here.  It is ""A-Ok"" as far as a corporate, family friendly with a predictable menu restaurant goes.  When compared strictly to other Cheesecake Factories it is easily 4 stars.  On this occasion, we went because it was as close as it could get from our lodging and as usual, we had a gift card.   We sampled a cheeseburger, chicken lettuce wrap tacos, garlic pasta and the club sandwich.  All of the dishes appealed to my dining mates, with no complaints.  We did take a cheesecake to go which was big and delicious Service was prompt and professional, with an actual experienced adult catering to our needs.  Wait time for a seat on a Saturday night was about 20 minutes.  The place was packed but the staff expedited well. I would return again if someone else was paying but it probably wouldn't be my first choice if it were asked of me to choose."
