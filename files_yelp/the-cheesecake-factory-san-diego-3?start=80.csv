Adriana R.,"San Diego, CA",9,29,63,1.0,10/31/2017,"I've been here twice and I came again, only to give it another chance,because the first time my husband and I came the people at the door was very rude and we wait forever for a table and it never happened so at the end they told us that the only place for us to seat was at the bar, but with an attitude :/ so we stayed and had dinner, there was one waitress and we order a drink for each other obviously and she brought mine but she totally forgot my husbands drink, he had to go and get his beer from the bar tender and she fight with him because she said that he don't suppose to be serving drinks to someone is being seat and helped by a waiter when she wasn't even helping! Anyway, last night we decided to go after church with another couple (first time for them) and the waiting list was 25 minutes but since the beginning the ""manager "" was being mean and having an attitude, it seems that they get paid for giving HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Because the guy at the door was the same! so we wait another friends showed up we asked for a bigger table because our group went from 5 to 20! So we wait for an hour plus. That's ridiculous because they had a lot of empty tables . The food wasn't good the only persons who were nice was our waitress and her helper, this place is expensive and because of that MANAGEMENT should be a person who delivers great customer service and is supposed to be there to solve problems look for QUICK solutions and keep customers happy! Mostly if is a big group that is going to spend a lot of money there. I am very disappointed and I feel really bad because out of the 20 me and my husband were the only ones who knew the place and everyone else was disappointed  and we were the ones who came with the idea to go there. Never again! You guys might not really care about loosing 20 customers because you have a lot. But we are locals and we are not going again nor taking friends or family either obviously . Now I am updating and uploading a screenshot with an email that someone sent me , where they are basically telling me that I was hungry and that's the reason I felt frustrated! WHAT??? This only shows what kind of customer service they have and that I am not the one who is wrong! CHEESECAKE FACTORY restaurant sucks! That's not an apology that's a ridiculous excuse to a horrible service and management. I wish I could give -0 stars!"
Jackie B.,"San Diego, CA",116,134,542,1.0,7/31/2016,"Don't really leave negative low review, but the establishment is so deserving. The only good thing about this location is that it's near Seaport other than that it's all BAD! So came here after a great night of watching the San Diego Symphony at the embarcadero. Craving some cheesecake. So figured we should end the night by having dinner here.  First off, it was around 9:30pm and there was a pretty long wait. 20minutes for a Sunday night. Our buzzer went off and we rushed to the hostess. When we got there one of the hostess was on the phone and told us that now we have to wait to have our names called out. OK. Then when we were finally walked to what we thought would be our table, it was not clean. She preceded to tell us to walk back to the front to wait for the table to be cleaned. After waiting for a few minutes the same girl told us. Sorry but your table is now outside. We were confused, but so hungry so retreated and followed her to a very dark outside patio. Like so dark everyone who was looking at their menu had their phones out with the flashlight on. So needless to say no pictures were taken.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and Tim ordered the Chicken and Biscuit. The bread prior to the meal came 10 minutes after he took our order. Then the food came like 20 minutes after that. My pasta was cold and bland. Seriously lacking in flavor. It's like someone dump pasta in a bowl and added some shrimp and chicken and ""sauce"" that was made for 1/3 of that pasta. It was dry. And Tim's Chicken and Biscuit was lackluster. Chicken was ok. But the biscuit and mashed potatoes was also extremely bland.  So to say that we were unsatisfied is an understatement. I only had a few bites of my food before we had to wave for another server since ours seems to be MIA to ask her for our check. Tim was going to pay cash and she said she couldn't take the payment because it's not her table. But she could if he was paying with a card. So he did since we did not want to stay a minute longer. It was a ridiculous wait after wait for food that was not good at all.  We both have dined at other Cheesecake locations and we can both say we would never come back to this one again. Save yourself some trouble and go for a few minutes drive to Little Italy which we should have done. Lesson learned."
Alison H.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,9,5,5.0,5/24/2017,"Tina our server for the evening was wonderful! She was friendly, professional and attentive---the food was great as usual and the Cheesecake excellent!  My Husband thought The Steak Diane although slightly different than what he is used to at the Otay Ranch CF was still great the sauce was much thinner but the meat was still tender with excellent flavor.  The Chicken Picatta was very good it was  the first time I've tried it and was very pleased with the flavor and tenderness of the chicken , our sons ordered The Bellagio and Chicken Alfredo and were also very satisfied with their choices.  Of course the Cherry and Turtle Cheesecakes were amazing. The portions were huge so we had plenty of leftovers.  ALSO, I accidentally left my wallet and didn't realize it until a few hours after we left the restaurant at exactly 11pm (the time that they close) luckily JOSH still answered the phone  and was so unbelievably kind and understanding --I was able to get my wallet back that night with EVERYTHING in tact!!!  Thank you JOSH!!! And thank you CHEESECAKE FACTORY for hiring IMO some of THE best people to represent your brand!!!"
Jamie C.,"Arcadia, CA",23,5,,1.0,8/8/2017,Terrible service. Party of 4 and 2 of our party finished their meals before the other 2 meals even came out. And it took 20 minutes for the first 2 meals to come out. Asked if we wanted more bread then never brought it out. They knew they messed up and then still gave crappy service. Asked for ranch and the server forgot. The server said the manager would be out to see us and never showed.
Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",352,821,2768,4.0,1/10/2016,"Met a high school friend, who I haven't seen in like a gazillion years, here.  I was not sure what kind of food she liked or what kind of ambiance and I figured, large menu choices and there's always something for someone.  She was actually excited because she likes CCF.  I can't say it was a friendly greeting when I walked in, only because a former student of mine was one of the hostesses...so I naturally became one of those rude and demanding customers just to give her a hard time....in front of other workers as well...LOL!  I was actually hoping she was serving so we could sit in her section and really give her a hard time...yeah, that's how I roll with former students...LOL! We took a table out on the patio.  Granted it was in mid December but the sun was out and they had heaters since we were in the shade.  Friendly greeting from our server who told us to take our time.  He was very patient as he came back a couple of times and we only ordered drinks.  Catching up with friends usually does that.   Jules ordered the Skinnylicious tacos which looked really good and came with a side of steamed or sauteed veggies, I couldn't tell.  I thought it was funny that she didn't eat them.  I ordered one of my favorites, the Cajun Jambalaya pasta which was perfect on a slightly chilly winter day.  What I like about CCF is that they are consistent with whatever you order at any location.  I also like the Chicken Madeira, which I always ask for extra sauce for my potatoes.   We were extra good today and didn't order cheesecake.  Trying to cut back on sugar!  But when I do indulge, I usually get the lemon raspberry cheesecake.  I feel like I'm not being so decadent.  Again, our server was friendly without being intrusive and let us take our time.  My only complaint would be the screaming child.  Dang, take that kid to the car and crack the window...LOL...just kidding, but you were thinking it.  This is a great place for families and out of towners.  I would definitely come back by."
Gordon E.,"Tempe, AZ",4,168,238,4.0,4/11/2017,"You really can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is located in Seaport Village, San Diego, California.  It's within walking distance of everything downtown. The food, drinks, service, and atmosphere are exactly what you would expect from a high-end Cheesecake Factory. Try a West Coast Green Flash IPA on tap! You will not regret it.   Enjoy!!"
Joy M.,"San Diego, CA",428,426,9110,5.0,6/13/2016,"Everytime I think about Cheesecake Factory my mouth is either watering or drooling. Deliciousness !!!  We've been here before and our dining experience is always amazeballs !!!! Hands down to the best America's favorite casual dining restaurant. TGIF wine and dine with fambam. Drinks and starters: Chardonnay for hub and Reisling for me.Salute! It was a beautiful night unwind from all the stress at werk werk werk ! I love their Skinnylicious menu it was perfect for late nights low calories So I ordered the fresh beet with goat cheese (with baby arugula pecan and vinaigrette it was fresh and perfection. And a small plate of Skinnylicious salmon rolls. Must have! It's spiced fresh salmon rolled in spinach fried in crisp wrapper. It was delish and I wanted more. But wore my tight pants I can't overeat lol! It was all 590 cal or less what a perfect portion. Hubby ordered the super antioxidant salad. It's a healthy delish salad blend of salad greens spinach kale avocado broccoli grapes and roasted pear. It's obviously a super power food. He also ordered an entree which is a steak Diane and salmon served with mashed potato & veggies. this combination is hell yeah ! It was Bombilicious!  Daughter ordered the burger with bacon it was a huge portion regular menu a glam burger served with fries they used certified angus beef. Heavenly deliciousness she said tender and juicy medium well. Lastly time for Cake o'clock we agreed to share the mango key lime cheesecake ! Rich and creamy ! Mi amore ! It was too pretty to eat it and deliciously topped with mango mousse on a vanilla coconut macaron crust ! Yum ! I'm drooling right now ! It was paired with a black coffee. Hmmmm ;)  Overall it was a delightful dinner on a fridaylicious night. CS was very friendly our waiter was very attentive. Modern Ambience, good vibes good music and dim lights. Relaxing atmosphere. They have a nutrition menu if you're super conscious and watching calories. Very good menu over 250 dishes made fresh with quality ingredients. You won't feel guilty!  Yummy!!! This location is at the headquarters in Seaport village they will validate your parking ticket and I think you only pay $3 or $4 for the first 2 hrs.  I can't wait to come back here again. Must wear my fat pants lmao ! Ciao ;)"
Beatrice T.,"San Diego, CA",12,30,106,4.0,6/13/2016,"The only reason I'm giving this review 4  because of our waiter! He was absolutely amazing; great funny personality, attentive and had good energy! It was pretty busy as it was Saturday afternoon but we go in quickly and we were able to sit out side and people watch.  We ordered the pear, blue cheese and caramel iced onion flatbread. It was tasty but not that big, if you're there with a bunch of people you'd need 2. We also had the Southwestern salad, it was by far the largest pile of salad I've seen. It has two tostadas on the bottom so that you can just pick it up and put it all on your plate. It wasn't mediocre at best.. And one of the cats from our group had the rib eye. It must have been good cause it was all gone! All in all its a great place to come check out and enjoy the bay. Walk over to Seaport Village and check out the shop."
Theresa V.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,6,1,4.0,9/15/2017,"We sat outside and there was a strange manure smell. We ordered a Glamburger and a Margherita Pizza. The pizza was great and the burger was good as well. Nice waiter, great location. Will return!"
Danielle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",697,664,403,3.0,12/22/2016,This place is packed on the weekends. And it's pretty dark in here during the night. We were off in a corner by the bathrooms. It's hard to flag down your server for refills from here. I know they were busy the weekend we went and we did wait a while for our food. Good thing we had bread for the kids. They do have a good selection and an extensive menu.
Yassine B.,"Canoga Park, Canoga Park, CA",0,13,,3.0,9/3/2017,This cheese cake factory has its up and downs the food was good but my dad ordered a burrito with no bacon and a long time later are food come out and instead of no bacon it was no beans so they made a whole other one and the food took forever. So that's it. Have a great day!!!
Dareen N.,"San Diego, CA",291,10,8,5.0,3/26/2017,Ah-maaazing Cheesecake experience today because of the most pleasant and professional server named Adam Gates! The food was also pretty darn spectacular and probably the best food we've tasted at any Cheesecake Factory. The menu is updated and you will definitely be able to find something ur pallet desires. I ordered the vegan Cobb salad and it was bomb! Adam though is golden. What a fantastic asset to this corporation. Glad we were able to celebrate my cousin's arrive to San Diego with an epic experience. Here's a family photo!
Marla D.,"San Diego, CA",100,247,398,2.0,9/26/2015,"With the many great restaurant options downtown, skip this place. It's just a great location and a reputable name but this restaurant is a disappointment.  Saturday evening, 5:30 and its dirty! The booth I was seated at had two used straws left on the ledge by the table. I grabbed my fork to eat and it was crusty. My lukewarm 30th anniversary cheesecake was served on a chocolate fingerprinted plate. My usual favorite chicken piccata was so disappointing! Thin dry chicken breasts in watery piccata sauce... Ugh waste of money but thank God it was a gift card!  Classic test: the bathroom was super dirty and not stocked! Stalls were out of the important tools if you know what I mean!"
Shaun F.,"Glendora, CA",30,57,7,2.0,7/24/2017,"I feel sorry for the wait staff at this restaurant. This location is seriously understaffed and thus each waiter/waitress has to cover way too many tables and booths. My waiter today had a particularly hard time today after being seated with 3 large groups plus my row of booths. Needless to say, the service was horrible but that was not the waiter's fault. He tried his best but there was way too much work for one person. The fault lies with management and the hostess for giving him such terrible assignments. When a restaurant tries to cut costs by cutting staffing it is always the customer service that suffers. Avoid this place during popular holidays or busy conventions because the franchise owner is a cheapskate when it comes to staffing."
Shea O.,"Chula Vista, CA",82,53,38,1.0,11/19/2016,"Good: The food was good as always Bad: The vibrating thing never vibrated. And when we were skipped a few times before we were seated after we complained. They're out of the items we wanted from the menu. The waiters seemed like they were ignoring us. They kept forgetting to ask my friend for her order. They gave her the wrong drinks each refill, it was just tea!  I never got my change back. I didn't even get a receipt!  Our server was Lawrence W."
Alyssa M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,5,4,3.0,9/3/2017,"So my experience here a few weeks ago was very good up until the end. I had been waiting to see if anyone else would write about this issue but nobody has so maybe it just happened to me and my boyfriend. So while we were there the food and service was excellent, this is our favorite restaurant and we've never been disappointed. Even after this incident we would come back but we were put in a very uncomfortable position by our server. When we received the bill the area towards the bottom where it indicated the tip percentage was marked with a heart. Now I work in a restaurant and I have for the past 5 years so I completely understand how important tipping is, it's what most servers live off of, so I could see why she may of done it but I'd still never do that. So we gave her the card and when she came back the next copy of the bill was marked in the same spot but this time boxed. I felt so uncomfortable and so judged because I assume she did this due to our age, and she thought we didn't know how important tipping was. It really made me upset and we were already planning tipping 20% but after that we left her still 15%, in my opinion after really thinking about this she may of deserved 5% for jumping to wrong conclusions. I thought I'd share just in case other people my age have had to deal with this at this restaurant or even by this server so they know they're not alone in feeling uncomfortable."
George M.,"Escondido, CA",0,28,14,4.0,4/1/2017,"Not sure why the rating is so low, I have only had one problem which, they remedied quickly.  We were seated quickly  NOTE: For the tourists, be nice you'll be amazed how far it will get you. Good was great but, one fish took a bit longer than expected. Shannon (server) and Josh (Manager) were much more concerned than I was and made it right. I'll definitely continue to come back."
Christopher J.,"Yuma, AZ",93,275,645,4.0,8/4/2016,"During an afternoon during Comic Con weekend, my co-workers wanted to eat at Cheesecake Factory. I imagined long lines to get in there, but the wait was only 20 minutes. Once seated and settled I decided to get something completely different than usual, asked our server Jacob (both friendly and intuitive) what's good.  I ordered Tex-Mex egg rolls, steak Diane, raspberry lemonade and for desert the Chris cheesecake.  I wasn't disappointed!  Everything was delicious, and though the restaurant was crowded our meals arrived like 20 minutes after we ordered. We left a nice tip, and walked off in the Comic Con madness outside. Worth the wait."
