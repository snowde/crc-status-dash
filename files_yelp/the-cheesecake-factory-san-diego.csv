Sam B.,"San Francisco, CA",284,109,31,4.0,12/28/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always amazing. I've never had an unpleasant experience.  This location specifically had an accurate wait time, a sweet and attentive hostess, amazing food, and friendly service.  We ordered the oriental chicken salad and the salmon special-herb crusted and it was delicious!  We also ended with the white chocolate raspberry and the celebration cheesecake. Both were amazing!  My only concern would be the wait time for food. There were a lot of tables open, so we were surprised by the wait for our food with such a big location... it was a little ridiculous...we've got shopping to do! But overall a great place, as always."
Danielle T.,"Irvine, CA",36,72,46,1.0,1/1/2018,"This place is a JOKE. There are so many other restaurants at Fashion Valley mall so just don't waste you precious time at this ridicules cheesecake factory location.  I'm way over disappointed with the bad experience I had.  We first came in at 8:15pm on MONDAY night. Asked for table for 6 (4 adults and 2 kids) told me to wait 10 minutes and will be sited, thought okay, 10 minutes it's ain't bad. Unfortunately the 10 came out to 20 minutes.  After we got sited it's took the waitress 5-7 just to come and even talked with us and than 5 more minutes to get some bread.  The silverware we've received were dirty I told that to the waitress he didn't even care about it. Asked for plastic utilities (which I didn't received; I needed to asked 3 times before I got it).  The waitress first took our order at 8:50pm. More than 30 minutes after we first came in!!  We ordered avocado egg rolls, 2 burgers, grilled salmon and edamame. Nothing complicated right? Lol. Not for cheesecake.  We waited more than 45(!!!!!!!!) minutes and even didn't receive all the dishes together.  First we received the grilled salmon, which was extremely salty and the mashed potatoes was COLD then after 3-5 minutes the two burger came out with NO fries, the fries came out only after 10 minutes. After we finished the burger.  But even after an hour the avocado egg rolls didn't arrived. We saw 2 other tables around us getting avocado egg rolls but for our table, nothing.  After asking the waitress couple of times about the egg rolls he didn't know what to say and just called a manager.  The manager also said he doesn't know and he will check this situation.  After 10 minutes came back said they run out from the egg rolls and he's sorry about it. Lol. 2 other tables (that set after us) received avocado egg rolls.  The reason we came to the cheesecake was because the avocado egg rolls and a cheesecake.  The waitress didn't inform us they doesn't have avocado egg rolls, the manager said they run out of it. I literally saw 2 other tables with the same dish at the table.  So the manager is a liar! He thought that if he will take if some $10 burger from the bill all will be okay. I didn't complained because I wanted my money back. My time with my dear family means the world to me. Because of the Cheesecake Factory this evening was ruined and we left without even having a desserts.  BTW dear manager, the $10 you took off I added to the tip so you can see it wasn't about the money. Even that we received a service that doesn't worth a penny!"
Christine S.,"Carlsbad, CA",229,563,390,3.0,12/28/2017,"It's a cheesecake factory. No more, no less. The menu is huge, the portion sizes are big, the site is loud with big crowds, and very dim in the evening. (I watched them turn down the lights till you needed your phone light to read the menu) I used to love coming to TCF for work lunches- a great place where everyone can find something on the menu they like. And it does offer creative twists on american standards. But honestly, I don't think it's changed in 20 yrs. Somehow I keep expecting to find something different each and every time and keep getting disappointed. So if you want a solid, old standby, this is the place."
Melanie M.,"San Diego, CA",275,117,263,4.0,1/5/2018,"Huge menu!  Big portions.  So much to choose from but every time I shy away from my usual order, I'm not pleased and regret that I didn't get the usual.  My go to meal here is the Miso Salmon.  I absolutely love it.  I could eat it every day but I'd also probably be 700 lbs.  The salmon is cooked to perfection in a sweet buttery cream sauce with snow peas.  So delicious!  My favorite cheesecakes are the red velvet cheesecake, the new ultimate birthday cake cheesecake, the vanilla cream cheesecake and banana cream cheesecake."
Audra H.,"San Diego, CA",66,234,361,2.0,12/20/2017,"Blah. We wanted to enjoy this experience. We really did.  Upon arrival, I went to the front reservation desk and spoke with the hostess. I said, ""table for two"" and she replied ""15-20 minutes,"" and handed me a device that would light up/vibrate when the Table was ready.  My wife arrived shortly after parking the car. 20 minutes pass. My wife suggests we ask about time. We saw other people getting seated and we knew the 20 minute timeframe had passed. So....I go up and ask about our reservation. One girl says, ""let me check,"" and touches the computer screen. The hostess sees the screen, taps it once and says, ""it'll be 5-10 more minutes."" Confused, I walk away. Later on i realize I think somehow the first girl messed up and never activated our device for the table...boo. 5-7 minutes later we were seated.  However, not before hearing a hostess pick on our last name. She showed it to the two other girls from earlier that I had asked about our reservation and then proceeded to laugh and ask them, ""how do you say this?!"" One girl, (the most competent of the bunch in the time we were waiting) repeats how to say our last name clear as day, and correctly. The other laughs and says something about the show ""Stranger Things,"" and proceeds to come over to us to show us to our seats. What a crappy way to start our dinner. Laughing about a customers name? Shameful!!  I wish I could saw it gets better, but it doesn't. My wife orders Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style from our server (who was kind enough, just very busy). I order pasta and meatballs. Content, we close our menus and wait. About 5 minutes later, our server comes up and says, ""we're out of the Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style in the Kitchen.""  Wow. Strange. Do they freeze their food or something? How can they be out of chicken, Parmesan, etc.?! Does it come in a frozen package or something and that's why they're out of it?! I mean, we're at an Italian restaurant. It was disappointing to say the least.  My wife ends up ordering Crusted Chicken Romano.  The pasta and meatballs I ordered was just alright. The meatballs had plenty of flavor, (but were kinda hard in places--maybe they sat to long in a warmer, oven?) pasta was luke warm and not hot. Not something to call home about.  I tried my wife's dish. The crusted chicken was decent but the pasta was flavorless and it had very little sauce so this contributed to the lack of flavor.  I've been here before and the food was average--AT BEST."
Peter T.,"San Diego, CA",302,835,382,3.0,12/18/2017,We all know what Cheesecake Factory is about so I'll keep it brief. Things I like about CF and you should too: 1. If Chili's and BJ's is 5/10 quality Cheesecake Factory is an 8/10 and the prices are only 5-10% more. Value value value. You can ball on a budget at the Cheesecake Factory. 2. Their protein-oriented combo meals are an INSANE value. Choose from Steak Diane / Herb Salmon / Shrimp Scampi / Chicken Madera. served with mashed potatoes and some great sauces. $22.50 as of Q4 2017. 3. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Cheesecake Factory is rare. Rare in that you can shorten your lifespan by about 2 months in high caloric delicious meal for under $30.
Gloria T.,"Vista, CA",383,144,219,3.0,10/17/2017,"I love that more and more places are starting to offer Vegan friendly items. Makes for a happy party. If you look up ""How to eat Vegan at Cheesecake Factory"" on google, you will find a list of your options. The Vegan Cobb Salad is HUGE! It has: Crisp Lettuce Topped with Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Farro, Almonds and Sunflower Seeds. I called and asked about their veggie burger, if it contained egg (because of said list stated above). I was told that the patty does NOT contain egg but it DOES contain a chicken base........... Super misleading but I guess since it's called a ""veggie"" burger and not a ""vegetarian"" burger they can kind of get away with it? I don't know but that was a bummer and I am super glad I called and asked. We went to dinner on a sunday and only waited about 25 min which wasn't too bad but we did wait a little while for our food. Service was cool, no complaints there. While everyone enjoyed their cheesecake, I walked over to True Food and got myself a Vegan Squash pie! Talk about a win win!"
Deborah S.,"San Diego, CA",401,178,707,4.0,9/28/2017,"I never realized the Cheesecake Factory had such an amazing happy hour until recently. My husband and I were going shopping and decided to stop for a light meal. It so happened the Cheesecake Factory did not have a line and it was happy hour.  We decided to order the following appetizers the happy hour Burger, chicken sliders, avocado egg roll and the crab and artichoke dip. What we didn't realize was everything was the full portion size. When all the appetizers arrived it seemed as if we were eating for four people. Oh my goodness everything was so delicious. Avocado egg roll had a tantalizing tamarind dipping sauce. I swear if they sold this dipping sauce in the store I would buy gallons and put it on everything.  Next I moved on to the crab and artichoke dip which was rich, creamy and amazingly full of crap meat. The chicken sliders were juicy tender and came with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Last but not least was the happy hour double burger. The burger was very large and juicy packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.  My husband and I enjoyed every happy hour item we had and left with a very large to go bag. I highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour."
Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",83,603,431,4.0,9/17/2017,"So my husband and I came here a week or so ago. We go to Cheesecake Factory all the time but this previous time was the worst. I have never walked out of a restaurant before but we did due to the service. It took over an hour and a half for our food to come out and we would have been fine if our waiter had checked in and kept us updated on the status but unfortunately, he avoided us! Not accidentally but blatantly avoided us. We would make eye contact and we were try and wave him down but he walked the opposite direction. We did speak to the manager Medi, who was very understanding and offered us some cheesecake or a meal on his next time we came. So a week or so later, we came back yesterday back because my mom chose it for her birthday dinner.  SERVICE - We asked for Medi and he remembered us. I have to say, Medi is a perfect example of a caring and kind manager. Someone who truly shows he cares about his patrons. He really apologized for our past experience and asked us how we were doing with our current experience. You could tell he was very genuine and wanted to ensure our experience was absolutely perfect this time around. Our server was TJ, who was awesome! He was witty and funny. He was fast and made sure we were taken care of. Even filled up our water before we asked. If you happen to have the pleasure of having TJ as your waiter, ask him to sing J Biebs and do a dance!!  FOOD Chinese Chicken Salad - Always our go to salad because it is so fresh with so much flavor. I always love the little tangerines in it giving it a juicy bite.  Louisiana Chicken Pasta - The fried chicken was very bland and dry. It was thin pieces of chicken so it could easily be over cooked which it was. The pasta noodles and sauce were just okay.  Honey Truffle Chicken - The chicken was well breaded and very moist! It had a very light taste of honey though. I wanted more flavor because the honey was too faint.  Fried Shrimp Basket - This was a solid dish. The shrimp was nicely fried without being overly greasy. The fries were perfectly crisp and salted.  Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken & Shrimp - This dish was slightly on the salty end this time around. My parents typically get this dish but it was saltier that usual. The white rice was very dry as well.  When it came time for the bill, it turned out Medi took care of our entire meal (including my parents and brother). We were not expecting that at all! We were taken by surprise but were also very appreciative. He even took the time to come out before we left to check if everything went well and said happy birthday to my mom. What a stand up guy!  Overall, Cheesecake Factory typically has good food! This time, it was just mediocre but I feel like it's not a normal occurrence.  3 STARS FOR FOOD 5 STARS FOR SERVICE"
Danielle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",697,664,403,3.0,11/21/2017,"This place gets packed on Sundays. We thought we were being slick and went in shortly after 3. Nope. They were still busy from Brunch Hours. Thankfully our party of 6 was seated in 20 minutes. We came at just the right time because when we left the wait was over an hour.  There are definitely not enough servers for the amount of people that come through here. The manager did his best and interacted with the patrons, but it was still a madhouse. My husband's food came out way before everyone else's. I would have preferred to have the kids food come out first, but it didn't.  It was our first time at this location and I could see that being in a mall was why they were busy. The good part about this chain is the variety of entrée items on the menu. There is literally something for everyone. And I haven't had a bad meal from a Cheesecake Factory that I can recall.  Oh yeah, parking here is a nightmare. If you can, try to park in the structure. The lot parking has some small stalls. It was hard to get in and out of our car without banging the car next to us."
Nik E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1345,303,502,3.0,8/20/2017,"#52 (2017) Overall rating here I'd give them a fair 3.5. (At the moment, the average rating this restaurant has on Yelp) Had a party of four on a Saturday night @8pm. We came in and we're given a buzzer. Thirty two minutes later our buzzer buzzed and we were seated promptly.  The food that was ordered was good -Trufle-Honey Chicken -Bistro Shrimp Pasta -Shrimp Scampi -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta The Trufle-Honey Chicken was yummy yummy. Good flavoring especially having a pinch of sweet from the Honey oh man. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The Bistro Shrimp Pasta was yummy yummy too. It was a very large portion and flavorful. Spaghetti noodles were on point. Mushrooms and shrimps OH MY! The Shrimp Scampi seemed like the smallest portion of everything! Lol it is the perfect dish if you love jumbo shrimp and dislike pasta. Angel hair pasta in a nice and creamy garlicky buttery sauce and surrounded by 6! Jumboish Shrimps.  The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is my first time ever eating Jambalaya with a pasta. It's a bit tomatoey. And with the old bay seasoning you know it's about to be legit right!  It had an ok amount of shrimps. Decent amount of chicken all sautéed with some good ol veggies.  For the birthday celebration you had to purchase your own dessert. They will decorate the plate and sing for ya.  When we were seated the table was a bit dirty.  We were also separated by trash all around and under the table.  Brandi/Brandy served the party well. She was upbeat and just very proper. Very cool. Thank you! :)"
Errin S.,"Santee, CA",56,30,41,4.0,11/26/2017,"For an upscale, but unpretentious dining experience, or even a few rounds of drinks with a date or some close friends, this is as well rounded as it gets.  It does get quite loud if you're seated inside, so either ask to sit outside or be ready for loud conversation. There's a full bar and a menu that covers just about every genera of food, all of course Americanized, but infused with flavor, presented with class and served in proportion to the price you pay. That price is a bit steep, so be ready to spend over $100 if you're going for appetizers, entree, drinks and dessert for two. I've often come and just gotten appetizers and drinks, which usually enough food for a small meal. Especially if you fill up on the fresh baked bread & butter they serve up complimentary as you wait. No matter what day of week or time of day you show up, there's always a wait and they don't take reservations, so be prepared.  If you don't have a large party, keep in mind that the bar (and a few tables in the vicinity) are open seating... meaning just stalk (politely and from a distance) someone who looks like they're finishing up and make a mad dash for their seats as soon as they're vacated.  Concerning their namesake... yes the cheesecake is amazing. I don't know that I've found anything to compare it to other than it's own internal competition... there are many varieties and all that I've tried are delicious.  Overall, the food is great, the drinks are strong and the service is nice. I've been here many times and I'll be back many more I'm sure."
Daniela S.,"El Paso, TX",20,112,218,2.0,10/9/2017,"This visit made me regret leaving the restaurant next door to come here.  I've never been so disappointed at any other location. Service was slow... slower than what I had figured to be normal in California.  No wait to sit. We did take forever ordering but I noticed parties who arrived after we placed our ordered, received their entrees before we did. The kitchen was ""slammed."" Almost an hour later we got all out food.  Maybe that's why my waffles arrived barely warm and raw. Raw.. The chicken they use is definitely not what I expected from cheesecake, it was hard to cut into and over seasoned.  Not one of us finished our entrees. The best part about our meal was the warm bread.  When our server Arman, asked how our meal was we informed him all our entrees were below par, since our previous CF visits have all been great. He quickly offered an ""I'm sorry. Should I bring the check?"" When everyone's entrees are barely edible, there is definitely something wrong. This made sure we never step foot in a Cheesecake Factory again. I should've trusted the Yelp reviews."
Richard M.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,,1.0,12/30/2017,"We went out with family to this Cheesecake Factory in fashion valley mall in mission valley as we were waiting for our table we saw two men holding each other making out passionately in front of my two little boys and they just kept on kissing and tonging each other without a care in the world who was watching, even in front of other children waiting on the couch just staring at them, they should have did that behind the bathroom stalls or in a car, but what can I say hillcrest is just up the hill from the fashion valley mall, and btw these sissy's do have the right to go and be anywhere, they should have been a bit more discrete not to confuse little children of what they really are, we won't be coming back to this cheesecake Factory ever! (Caution Not 100% family oriented atmosphere) If you disagree maybe Contact the affirmative action league or Vitit   "
Kathy S.,"San Diego, CA",79,223,567,4.0,6/10/2017,"My family and I have been coming here for many years now and we definitely enjoy it. While the wait can be quite long during peak hours on weekends, we usually like to eat a little earlier and get seated within ten to fifteen minutes of adding our name to the list. One of our favorite things is that until 5pm, the menu has a ""lunch special"" page that is offered. You can choose from a wide variety of items and they are not only discounted prices, but also a smaller portion which is something we like. I always feel like the regular portions are just way too big... But maybe that's just me! My go-to dish is the chicken piccata and it is offered during the lunch hour which is nice. It comes with angel hair pasta, chicken breast, and a lemon caper sauce with mushrooms. While many people may think I'm crazy for what I'm about to say next based on the fact that this is a review of The Cheesecake Factory, I make a couple modifications to the chicken piccata to make it a little healthier. I ask for rice instead of the pasta and, most importantly, for the sauce on the side. It's just as delicious and I never feel weighed down after eating it. This is definitely a fun place to eat with a great vibe and staff that are always super friendly. They have something for everyone to enjoy!"
Akshatha K.,"Austin, TX",0,1,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"This is one of my favorite places to eat but today, I had the worst experience @ Fashion Valley location. Angel hair pasta was undercooked and nothing was done about it. Didn't expect it from Cheesecake Factory. They just lost a customer and will lose many more if they continue the same..."
Sheltiemomm S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",61,110,28,5.0,1/2/2018,"YELPers, not often I stop eating 2 YELP; buttttt Markus was extraordinarily skilled, friendly sans saccharine nor pretense. Helped me w/the myriad selections here. Must get Factory Chopped Salad w/simply grilled salmon, incredible! Deference paid 2 Scoutie, my Service Dog; ur welcome!! Everything wasüber fresh, including chopped apple/avo/crisp bacon! If ur lucky you'll get Markuz as a Server: he puts, 'service' in Server......."
Kiara C.,"San Diego, CA",343,199,260,2.0,9/29/2017,"Cheesecake, fan-f*cking-tastic! Location is nicely put next to fashion valley mall. Parking sucks. Customer service is not up to par. My waitress gave off an energy that was angry, the host seemed aggravated that he was at work and was very short when speaking and spoken to- sorta like a stuck up attitude.  2 stars because the cheesecake was dynamite and I will go to a CF but try a different location.  I suggest some trainings for both individuals."
Rachel P.,"Seattle, WA",164,7,,5.0,1/3/2018,I love this place because I love seeing the gays make out! I hope there will be more kissing in the lobby:-)
Astara B.,"Burbank, CA",452,101,156,5.0,12/16/2017,I came here with my family. They had never been to CF. Everything was delicious and the ambiance is perfect. We really enjoyed sitting outside by the heaters.
Alonzo T.,"San Diego, CA",72,29,102,4.0,11/16/2017,"I only come here for the cheese cake. My top three would be the red velvet, turtle and raspberry white chocolate. It is usually crowded at this location, especially on the weekends."
AM D.,"San Diego, CA",2,6,,5.0,12/7/2017,"Went for happy hour lunch a few days ago. I sat inside where the bar is, but in the booth. It was just me so I could just relax. It was early evening-ish/late lunch and it was pretty busy. I had the nachos, which was a BIG portion for the happy hour price!!  Drinks were okay, but weak.  My server, Dan (glasses, real nice guy) was so attentive! He was quick, friendly, and just on top of his game!! He engaged with all the tables and people he had with no problem.  Will definitely be coming back and looking for him! I love that they have seasonal cheesecake. Mmm."
Mariana C.,"San Diego, CA",53,1,,2.0,11/29/2017,"I ordered a chipotle pasta  It was so so salty, tasted like tomato pasta with a lot of salt.  My original server was so nice and until she went to take her break everything was great.  A new server was in charge (white girl short hair). This girl drop the food and she left for about 3 minutes she come back and She ask everything ok ? And she left right away, she never wait what I was going to say.  She come back and I told her my food was salty, she said sorry to hear that, but she never ask me if I want something else instead or try to solve the problem.  She drop the check and she left. The only good thing was my strawberry lemonade."
Kayli R.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",227,2,1,5.0,10/4/2017,"We went in for my birthday dinner and sat out on the patio. John was our waiter and he was incredibly attentive, despite being in charge of the entire patio section alone.  We made some modifications to our meals, and everything came out perfectly! We ordered the four cheese pasta, spaghetti and meatballs, and a chicken parmesan sandwich. For dessert, the classic Linda's fudge cake. All of these were delicious and we definitely recommend.  John went above and beyond to make sure that we had everything we needed and more; he even had the plate for our cake decorated with sprinkles and ""happy birthday"" written on it.  Overall, great experience tonight! Thanks John and we will definitely be coming back soon."
Nicole Y.,"San Diego, CA",10,111,103,4.0,7/2/2017,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory, but one thing to note is that wait time is actually not too bad! Although I suppose it depends on when you go. I came with a party of three and we were sat within 15 minutes.  Our waitress was incredibly helpful and patient with my party. She was knowledgeable about the menu and any questions that we had about whether or not things had gluten. My mom had ordered a salad that she accidentally put salad dressing on that had gluten in it and she's allergic, and our waitress was able to bring her a new salad without hassle.  I really appreciate the service that my family and I received. We will definitely return to this location the next time we come back to fashion valley. There is really just so much to choose from on the menu everyone can get something they like. Even though I can't have the cheesecake, it sure looks delicious!  Hurry up and make a dairy free/gluten free cheesecake!"
Scott D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",88,137,142,2.0,11/20/2017,"We stopped by on our way back home from a weekend in San Diego.  We were hoping for a quick meal.  Wrong.  We walked in to see there was no wait, however the temperature inside was in the 60's.  Colder than the outdoor temperature so we chose to sit outside. We were seated, drink orders were taken and we received our drinks as expected.  We ordered our meals, and our food took over an hour to get to our table, and only after we chased down our server.  I never saw a manager during our stay.  I walked around and looked twice, when our server was MIA.  Anyway, the food was great, and the only reason for the 3 star rating."
Andrea H.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",4,2,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Worst experience I've had at this chain. My party was a total of 15 people and were told we couldn't get a reservation. So we got there at 6:30pm and was told it would be a 2 hour wait. By 8:30pm, we still had not been called and the host said they were waiting on 2 parties to leave to get our table ready. 9pm and still not seated. 9:30 and one party of 3 was still there preventing them to move our tables together.  That party was already done eating and bill paid. They were just chatting. I didn't expect them to kick them out or anything but asked the manager why couldn't he ask them to move to a different table if they still want to stay and chat. He said, ""I don't want to ruin their experience"". So our party was split into 3 tables surrounding this group who didn't look like they were leaving anytime soon. We got seated at 9:45pm, over 3 hours from when we got there! Most of us were hangry by that point.  I had to talk over the table to ask my friend a question and the server told me ""don't talk over the table"". So I couldn't talk to people in my party? Then right before we were about to order, one of the ladies in the party of 3 (who was sitting next to me) takes off her shoes and socks and starts massaging her feet! Who does that in a public restaurant? This really disgusted me! Two people in our party got the same dish and the noodles in the pasta were hard! They offered to comp those two dishes as a solution.  When they first sat us down the manager had apologized to us for the long wait and offered to comp us some cheesecake. We thought great we could all get some cheesecake for dessert at least. When dessert time came, turns out he could only offer us 3 SLICES of cake. 3 slices for a party of 15? That's crazy.  I understand that this situation was out of their control but they could have handled it better and their apologies didn't seem sincere. I have seen people being asked to move to a different table to make room for a bigger party and they didn't even bother to take that suggestion.  They kept repeating, ""we don't want to ruin their experience or yours"". But honestly, they were so worried about ruining an experience of 3 people that they ended up ruining an experience of 15 people."
Oli J.,"San Diego, CA",99,82,149,2.0,3/29/2017,"I am genuinely surprised I'm leaving a 2-star review for this place because I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's usually reliable, and cheesecake, am I right? No, skip this one! We came for an early dinner and got sat relatively quickly at a smaller table on the patio. We ordered drinks and appetizers. At this point, everything was fine, good even. It was an hour into our stay when we still hadn't gotten our entrees and our server said he had ""just checked on them,"" that we noticed something was wrong.  So when our food did come out, salad and pasta, by the way, we were happy to finally have our entrees. Except the quality was not as good as other CCF I've been too, though. Now, we were there, trying to recover from waiting an hour for subpar entrees, when the manager came out and asked the table right beside ours to move so they could make room for a 30 top group, and can you believe it, it was a group of teenagers! Not a foot away from us. The table that moved got a larger booth and free desserts, us? Suffer.  We got boxes, skipped the cheesecake (usually my reason for going here), and got out immediately. Our bill was over $100 for two people and I left 18% because I'm not a monster, but I do think the server forgot to ring in the order. Anyway, yes, I tried to be happy, but it was a terrible experience."
Lydier H.,"Pasadena, CA",329,186,499,3.0,11/13/2017,Not the top of the place I'd go for food due to I have strict diet. But I have to admit after a long haul shopping day coming here to recharge isn't a bad idea at all. In a matter of fact I can always refer to the calories shown on the menu and I appreciate their gesture by listing all of the food ingredients. So no excuse on my end if I ended up eating too much calories densed food.
Bethann S.,"Santee, CA",7,51,,2.0,11/13/2017,"I go to the cheesecake factory often, so I was very surprised and disappointed on Sunday when I went to pick up a cheesecake that I had special ordered.  when I went to pick up my order, the hostess said she did not have anything for me.  mind you I am buying a whole cheesecake, (which isn't cheap ).. with a lot of back and fourth I finally got my cheesecake. but when I brought it to my event, they hadn't put any whip cream on the top - typically when you order a slice at the restaurant there is whip cream on the top and some on the plate, nope not on take out. so I had to go to a store and buy a can of whip cream.  will go back but next time will MAKE SURE who takes the order, etc etc etc."
James L.,"San Diego, CA",1,11,,2.0,11/13/2017,"Food is already great no debating that.  But last couple experiences (last 4 visits) have been awful. Longest food has taken to get to my table since order has been 55 minutes (waiter forgot to put in the order). They always run out of the Chicken Parm Pizza Style and they also ran out of Turkey Burger. Staff is friendly but they aren't attentive. Took them too long before drink ordered was taken, food order, bread to brought out.  It's tough cause I love the food but these past experiences make me want to drive to a different further location just to get better service."
Ian M.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",219,9,,5.0,12/21/2017,"Today was my first time trying this place out and I have to say as a former server myself, this staff went above and beyond to ensure our very large party was taken care of every second. The manager was very good at getting us a table that fits more than 20+ people and our servers took such good care of us in every detail possible. They were so attentive, accommodating, and had pleasant attitudes even during all the stress. I know for a fact I WILL be returning very soon!"
Ann C.,"La Jolla, CA",50,15,14,2.0,10/29/2017,"I'll do The Good, The Bad and The Ugly: The Good: the sourdough bread and dark wheat bread are both very good. They are served fresh and warm. Also the strawberry jam with Monte Cristo is very good, 5. The Bad: the Monte Cristo (only avail. on weekend brunch, so we had to wait until I had a weekend off) was served with cold eggs and soggy French toast, like it had sat out for 15-20 minutes before coming to our table. One bite and I couldn't believe it; I waited a long time for this and it had been so good on past visits. I just asked if I took out the eggs if they could bring a hot replacement, they did, so all was OK there. They brought a very large portion of eggs too. They tried, so 3.5 - 4. When placing the order I had asked if we could swap out the ham for a veggie, and they brought a large plate of spinach. It was good except there were two pieces that were obviously black and rotten. ???  2. At the end of the meal, while putting away the left overs, I saw there was a short black hair under the breakfast potatoes, sigh... 1. The Ugly: having been here many times I know the restroom is never in good shape, even early in the day, which is when we arrive to try and minimize wait time. Well when I went in today, the two stalls I looked in were so unbelievably gross (to be nice and not speak in French!) I just turned around and left.  0. I understand this is a high volume restaurant, but as that IS the status quo here, it would be great if operations could be evaluated and improved to uphold quality standards with the food and facilities. As one of our servers was very friendly, attentive and had a can-do attitude, my husband still left a generous tip."
g k.,"West Covina, CA",165,15,22,2.0,11/9/2017,"I felt I had to review this one. I've never ever felt the need to alter food to be able to eat it. I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. It literally tasted like tomato with pasta and added boiled shrimp with pepper. The kids got the kids spaghetti dish, which had more flavor then my dish.  Reply to guest services- yes I did let the servers/waiter know. They went and got me a bowl of marinara sauce."
Samantha G.,"Poway, CA",6,4,,5.0,1/1/2018,I don't write reviews often but I have to say i was very impressed with the staff here! We had a party of 17 with 6 of those being children and our service was phenomenal. The waitress was very patient with all of us and our drinks were always filled and the service was very fast for New Years Eve! I do wish they would consider taking reservations for larger parties!
Jojo B.,"Richmond, Canada",0,3,3,1.0,11/12/2017,This is one of the worst Cheesecake restaurants i've been to. I don't know if it was just because of the busy day or they always have this rate of service. 1 - Cutlery was dirty when we got to the table. Waitress ended up changing all of them as we requested. 2 - Noticed my son's mini burger was raw in the middle. We questioned it and the waitress said they ALWAYS serve them that way. Rare in the middle. Really? Wow.
Xavier P.,"Julian, CA",125,97,965,3.0,9/1/2017,"HOLY MENU! If you don't know what you want to eat Do or Don't come here. This place will either make you happy because it has everything or just make you even more confused.  The food here is good and improved over the years but I can feel like life span shrinking with each bite i take. The amount of salt, butter, and calories, I might just have a heart attack and die here.  Parking here is horrible but thats because its in a mall.  The seating is great, indoors, outdoors, or bar.  Service is great and of course the wide selection of cheesecake."
Adam S.,"San Diego, CA",1644,761,174,3.0,12/13/2017,"As mentioned before, you can never go wrong with eating at the Cheesecake Factory. This location is still by far the busiest I have ever been too. Unfortunately, I find customer service to be very hit or miss nowadays. I have had plenty of great servers but I have also had horrendous experiences where it makes me reconsider why I bothered coming in. There is little consistency with my experiences here anymore. I have even complained a few times, sometimes resulting in extra food, or partial comps or, nothing at all. Yes, nothing at all. I cannot express the need for such a busy store to have their best displayed and working here. It is because of the lack of consistency in service which is why I now go to other CF locations instead. I really hope they can fix that here but considering the revenue they probably get from this spot, it does not matter as much. Overall, if you want a great meal, Cheesecake Factory is a great spot to go. However, this location is not the most ideal one to go to in my opinion. Very busy and popular due to its location for sure though."
Victor G.,"Camp Pendleton North, CA",64,3,,5.0,12/28/2017,Even though the place was very packed we were seated quickly and attended fast. Also there is very friendly staff.
Daniel M.,"San Diego, CA",24,13,6,1.0,12/29/2017,"Got there at 5:45 PM and ordered appetizers.  Our server, Amanda, was very friendly and the service was great.  She then took our dinner orders and we were waiting for our dinner to be served.  At 6:30 PM the manager came to our table and told me the meal I had ordered was out and they wouldn't be able to serve it.  He then brought a menu over for me to choose a new meal while my guest had already been served his meal. I ordered a new meal and he told me it would be out soon.  Fast forward 20 minutes and my guest has finished eating and I still have no meal. Amanda kept checking on me because she felt terrible.  Finally at 7 PM we had to cancel the meal because it still wasn't out and we had to make a movie at 7:30 PM.  The manager never came over to apologize or even offer a small discount or a comped appetizer.  The gesture alone would have been appreciated.  So much for dinner and a movie..."
