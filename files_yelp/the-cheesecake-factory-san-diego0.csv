Justine H.,"San Diego, CA",1514,221,2468,3.0,1/12/2016,"First off, f*ck salad and secondly, why tf would anyone pay $14.50 for a Cobb salad? This is your typical, overrated Cheesecake Factory chain. There will always be a wait during peak dining hours, there is an extensive menu with the nutritional values to ruin the fun, the portions are huge, and the food is overpriced for being mediocre. However, if you are a restaurant snob like me and you avoid American chain restaurants (unless someone else if paying), the Cheesecake Factory, out of all the chains, is superior only because it is a step up from a Chili's, Applebee's, or Friday's. This ultimately makes The Cheesecake Factory the Walmart of fine dining. It's just aiight, people."
Celina A.,"Woodbridge, VA",171,7,,3.0,6/3/2017,"This use to be one of my favorite restaurants but I'm losing interest. The plates are not as tasty as they use to be. Then the red sangria use to be on point but today it was not. Finally, the restrooms were not cleaned. It's disturbing to see that from an establishment like this. It will be a wile before I could see myself going back."
Jesse R.,"Monterey Park, CA",215,84,39,4.0,4/23/2017,"One of the better places to eat in mission valley.   The service was great. Thank you John     The food came out in time will cooked, delicious,  and well presented.    Highly recommend The chicken Marsala and their house wines.   My  small party enjoyed them selves and look forward to coming back"
Stephen W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",191,134,169,3.0,3/27/2017,"I am a regular at this Cheesecake Factory, and it is also my favorite restaurant chain. I think this cheesecake is probably the best of the ones I regularly visit.  To start, my party and I ordered the chicken potstickers which were very good. I also shared a Caesar salad with my girlfriend which was also great. For her main dish, my girlfriend ordered a flatbread. She said it was okay, but the tomatoes on it were not that good. I just ordered an appetizer of loaded baked potato tots which I get all the time. Those were very good as always. My dad, however, got chicken Parmesan pizza style. He expected a pizza with chicken parm on it, with pasta. But, it turned out to be all chicken, pounded into a circular shape, with a lot of cheese and then noodles on top. Very interesting concept, but also misdescribed entirely on the menu. It was okay, not great. Our server TJ was very good and attentive, and when he asked my dad what he thought of the chicken parm dish, my dad was honest with him and said he did not enjoy it because it was not what he expected. TJ took it off our bill immediately without us even asking. He also sent the manager over, and the manager was very nice and listened to any feedback, especially because that chicken parm dish was a new menu item.  Overall, I think we just ordered the wrong things, but the service was amazing. I'll definitely be back there."
Tareq S.,"San Diego, CA",22,2,,5.0,6/8/2017,"Really its change my personality, first I was enjoyed in places that serve hookah and alcohol, but after the first time I eat in cheesecake factory and really enjoyed the meal and place, i change my mind and the first thing come to my mind when I want to hangout is to go to Cheesecake Factory to try a new meal."
K G.,"Escondido, CA",1,13,,1.0,7/10/2016,"I'm disappointed to write this, as the food here is not bad, but the service I experienced on yesterday really put a damper on my dining experience, and has caused me to rethink patronizing this business.  I was literally the first person to walk into the restaurant, right at 11 when it opened. We had a party of 5. I asked the hostess for a table, and she said, ""We just have to wait for the servers to come out."" Perfectly fine with me; we stood and waited. Not even two minutes later, some white guy barges past us with his guest, walks up to the counter, and the workers begin to grab menus. I glanced at the hostess to see if she might say, ""These ladies were here first,"" or something of the sort, but she said nothing. What a deflating feeling.  I didn't appreciate the second class treatment I experienced. When we later spoke to the manager, he had many excuses. So sad, because I've always said that Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants, but I won't spend my money in a place that causes me to feel second best."
Amanda W.,"San Diego, CA",1,20,3,4.0,10/1/2017,"Food is pretty tasty, just a bit pricey. Only complaint was our Buffalo Wing appetizer came out cold even though we ordered them fried hard so they'd be crispy. Not sure why since they came out pretty quickly after we ordered. Shared the ribeye steak & the mashed potatoes were awesome. Added a side of mac-n-cheese which was okay. Too much mozzarella with their propitiatory cheese sauce. Best thing about our meal was the service we received. They sat us quickly & moved us easily to the outside after we saw that looked like a better option to enjoy our meal on a Friday night. Megan F. Was our waitress & she is a very sweet, attentive southern gal. She kept our waters filled, bread loaded, & condemns on point (blue cheese dressing is amazing by the way). Morgan took over while Megan went on a quick break & didn't miss a beat. What a great pair. Sure we'll be back, most likely for the great lunch deals. Like to try the brunch. Know we'll be requesting Megan's section:)"
Lucy A.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",19,104,23,5.0,4/22/2017,This place was amazing everything was delicious for the first time the wait was only 10min the food was bomb drinks were amazingggg great staff...
Diana M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",3,181,284,3.0,5/16/2017,Cheesecake Factory is a consistent brand. A little disappointed that one of the orders was incorrect and correct pizza came to the table as the rest of our party was finishing their meal. Surprised manager didn't offer anything in exchange only an apology. Have had better luck at other locations.
Minah K.,"Murrieta, CA",1,18,2,1.0,9/9/2016,"Totally disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory. I get it, Friday night is busy but how do you mess up angel hair?! I ordered shrimp scampi and the shrimp wasn't seasoned. No salt what's so ever and I had to drown it with Tabasco. (Mind you this is after a 40 minute wait for food.) My pasta was undercooked, too and honestly I just wanted to eat and freaking leave. I'm pregnant and if I didn't have something in my system I get nauseous. Hire another chef if you care about quality. Idk if the guy was overwhelmed or whatever, but not a fun night."
Taura G.,"San Diego, CA",5,81,12,5.0,2/21/2017,"Perfect night of dinner! Perfect server, Jessica L. Perfect food and dessert! Tried the new Truffle-Honey Chicken (comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes) and my daughter had the dynamite tempura shrimp and the side of mac n cheese; all very delicious. The oreo milkshake was delicious to my daughter. We took 2 pieces of cheesecake to go. Our server was great and she was totally sweet. Glad that we didn't go to Stacked restaurant after all."
Kathryn B.,"La Mesa, CA",51,31,10,1.0,7/6/2016,"IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH YOU WONT EAT HERE !!!!!! This place gave me and my four friends food poisoning!!!!!! Never in my whole life have I gotten so sick from a restaurant .. Cheese cake factory what's going on ?! I used to be a long time fan ! I have never ever given a one star Yelp , but when a restaurant is putting me health at risk it's the only choice I have !  Came in last Thursday for a light dinner with some friends , we all shared the Ahi poke stack ,  the deep fried tatter tots and some Chinese chicken lettuce raps .  We shared a piece of strawberry cheese cake .  I also had a side Caesar salad . The next morning all four of us woke up viciously sick .    I am not sure what food item gave us the food poisoning ( mind you I only had one tiny bits of the ahi so I don't think it's that ) . Can't complain about the service but I will do my best to warn every human on the planet to take great precaution when eating at this establishment . I am absolutely horrified !!"
Angel M.,"Saugus, MA",76,33,2,5.0,5/2/2017,Always have one or 2 dinners here when I am in the San Diego area visiting my cousin. I am a Cheesecake Factory junky...although I would have to say they disappointed me with the Caesar Salad. The lettuce was limp and old. Otherwise happy.
Joe K.,"San Diego, CA",387,131,112,1.0,1/1/2016,"The short and sweet version. Go for take-out cheesecake. Skip the sit-in food.  Now the long version.... Me and a friend went in for some grub and were seated immediately...which was nice. Then no one checked on us for a good 10 minutes. A server finally walked over and introduced herself, we placed our drink orders and she repeated it back to me incorrectly 3 times. Headed down the wrong path already. It probably took a good 15 minutes for the drinks to show up. My friend's martini was made wrong. I had a mojito, it was mediocre at best. Then no server again. We're starving at this point, she finally passed by and asks if we need a few more minutes...I thought to myself, yea if you give us any more time we'd probably pass out. We place our food order, friend gets the fried mac and cheese, I order the chicken scampi. Then another server come up and introduces herself as the replacement as our original server went home. I will include a picture of my dish. It was the most bland, under salted, diluted dish I've ever tasted. I asked the service very politely if I could get a side of Alfredo sauce, and to my disappointment, that was completely watered down...it looked like some milk in a bowl and tasted as such. In the photo you can clearly see how the sauce doesn't even coat the pasta, it was dry, chicken was pale as a ghost...looks as if they boiled it or something. Overall huge disappointment. Server showed absolutly no concern for whether or not we liked our food. I took two bites from my dish, and the server asked if I wanted a box dryly, I refused and she brought us the check. Nothing else was said. I don't think I'll ever return or recommend anyone to this location. There are plenty of other nice food choices in the mall."
Candice S.,"Temecula, CA",18,18,1,3.0,4/29/2017,Unless you like really sweet mole sauce don't order the nachos! Yuck! Everyone else enjoyed their meal.
Walter R.,"Bonita, CA",0,1,,3.0,5/2/2017,"I have being going to this location at least one time a month for the last couple years.  The service is very good, food is good but I have notice that the portions are getting smaller,  and smaller, specially the soups."
Amber E.,"San Diego, CA",686,1475,2306,4.0,6/16/2017,"So, our favorite Cheesecake Factory is the one that we first went to in Marina Del Rey.  One of the best aspects was the incredible location and great views, right on the water.  Many Cheesecake Factories do have those great water-front locations.  This one, unfortunately, is just in a Mission Valley mall parking lot.  Nonetheless, for years it had crazy lines and waits.  However, the good news is that it's a lot easier to get in now.  Other pluses: good happy hour until 6 pm; good ""Skinnylicious menu"" with lower calorie food and drink options, plus nice kids menu.  My favorite always used to be the jumbalaya (with shrimp, beef and chicken over pasta, generally shared), but now I like several of the salads, small plates, Tuscan chicken or lemon shrimp w/ angel hair pasta (all on the ""Skinnylicious"" menu). It is really crazy how many calories some of the other entrees and items have.  And if you order a small plate or share a meal, you might just have room for a few bites of cheesecake - last time ordered the lemon raspberry and Godiva chocolate, and they were both divine!"
Michelle N.,"San Diego, CA",159,157,598,4.0,1/20/2016,"Have not eaten at Cheesecake Factory in forever, just because they're a little pricey for me to eat on a regular basis and their calorie count is crazy ridiculous. Me and one of my besties were boot shopping, decided to come here for dinner. We found 2 seats at the bar, thank goodness because the wait was crazy busy. The bar staff was amazing that night, compliments to you for keeping sane despite how busy it was.  We started with the egg roll sampler, four different kind. It was an awesome way to try the different appetizer egg rolls on the menu. I have always loved their version and BJ's version of the avocado egg roll. The firecracker salmon egg roll was also excellent, will definitely re-order these. The other two egg rolls were good, but didn't stand out like the previous two that I mentioned.  We also decided to split a salad for an entree and my friend has been craving buffalo chicken strips. The fresh vegetable salad is out of this world good, loved all the components in it, the perfect mix of veggies. I placed portions on my plate the way it was plated and ate across, slowly eating each element and not just tossing it all together, sooooo good. The buffalo chicken strips stayed nice and crunchy, even with the buffalo coating.  Of course my friend ordered dessert, she always needs that touch of sweet at the end. I rarely order dessert here because it's super decadent and I'm usually way too full because of the portion sizes, but then she started talking about a mango cheesecake and I was in to try it. Thank goodness I brought my Lactaid pills, otherwise it wasn't happening. It ended up being a mango key lime cheesecake and it was heavenly. I loved the taste and ended up eating most of it. My friend only had a few bites and was done."
Jodie L.,"San Diego, CA",982,126,202,3.0,6/12/2016,"This is my very first time ever trying this place. And that's only because I've had this gift card for like 2 1/2 years... I realize now why it's taken me so long. The venue is huge, they have about 30 servers working on a Thursday night. The outdoor patio area is very nice, well lit with fire pits and heaters.  All I can say is - go for the cheesecake. Nothing else.  The food is mediocre at best and the drinks are much worse. Can't say much for the service either. We had one of those servers where you ask them for a recommendation and they say ""well I don't like bacon. I haven't tried those. I don't eat meat."" I'm asking for a recommendation, not for a personal preference. Another note is how incredibly dense their menu is - so unnecessary. Cut it down, there's no reason to have a 12 page 100 item count menu. Will not revisit."
Deniz A.,"San Diego, CA",29,304,12,1.0,11/28/2015,"The server who took care of me today ruined my visit. Before dining, I asked whether my European card would be approved, because it usually goes through. Then he sounded nice to acommodate me with the inconvenience by saying: ''I don't want you guys to leave without eating.'' I took the offer, and told him to leave a phat tip, and he seemed cheered up.  Anyhow, once we were halfway on our meal hear slightly threatened us to pay the bill with my outstanding total. My disagreement was huge, but I decided to not argue and find a proper place to get my dollars out of my European card. Once I arrived, the server took my mone and didn't offer me the RECEIPT! Right after this transaction he tried to seat me at another table. Therefore, my doubts are strong that he put the entire bill in his personal pockets."
