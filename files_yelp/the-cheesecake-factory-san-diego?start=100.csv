Aileen C.,"South Hill, WA",347,143,1879,5.0,12/18/2016,"We came here with a family  of 11 for our nephew, the Marine graduate. Our first check in here. It's always a pleasure to eat here. We love the variety of dishes offered. The service was excellent as always."
Lashawn R.,"Riverside, CA",1,64,4,1.0,5/14/2017,This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. My daughters graduation was yesterday and she wanted us to have dinner here. We understood that it was busy and agreed to wait the 2 hours to be seated. After 2.5 hours we approached the front to find out what's going on they tell us 30 more minutes.  But after another hour we're still not seated. We waited 3 hours to be on the patio. The waitress took our order for a party of 15. One waitress but okay. She was very nice. By now it's 10:15 and still no food.  We waited 4 hours for nothing and my daughters graduation party was ruined and all the manager kept saying was I'll see what I can do. This was unacceptable and unprofessional on the establishment 's part. Will not recommend this place.
R P.,"Temecula, CA",0,10,1,5.0,12/16/2017,One of the best Cheesecake Factory Restaurants. Santa Fe Salad was excellent and so were the Fish Tacos. Service was excellent...smiling and attentive staff.
Dee P.,"San Diego, CA",35,86,221,1.0,8/21/2017,"Very rude when you call and ask for information, this location at least. Downtown was better."
Alex G.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,105,5,1.0,8/11/2017,"This location of Cheesecake Factory has managed to totally break my love of this restaurant.  I will never give them another cent of my money for their poor service. For some reason I always have the ""luck"" of being sat in this one horrible waitress' section with my family.  She is the WORST waitress.  She never fills our drinks and never gets our food out to us in a reasonable amount of time.  As a waitress, your job is to make sure your tables' orders are progressing.  You shouldnt always have your appetizers come out after your entrees.. or forget items.. but last night was the final straw.  I should have asked to be moved but I had no idea I was in her section until our original waiter took a break right after he took our meal order 35 minutes after we sat down. I have children and they ordered the most simple item on the menu.  Bowtie pasta with butter and cheese.  Doesnt get much easier than that, huh?  Why seat me if you cant even take my drink order for over 20 minutes and it takes 35 to even ask me what I want for dinner?  Why offer to place the children's orders first if you are going to bring out my child's order 22 minutes TWENTY TWO FREAKING & MINUTES after the rest of our table.  CF cant boil an entire new batch of pasta in 22 minutes?  What kind of restaurant doesnt have childrens bowtie pasta which makes up 60% of the childrens menu ready within minutes??   So after almost 2 hours at the cheesecake factory I ended up with a completely lost appetite because my food was cold by the time my child's was delivered and I wasnt going to just sit there and eat in front of my very hungry child. Woohoo they comped her meal, big whoop.  The manager was almost as much of a joke as the waitress.   Done with this location and the cheesecake factory."
Lorel W.,"San Diego, CA",28,29,28,4.0,10/3/2016,"We arrived at 11:50 and there was no wait. They tried to seat us at table 13 that wasn't clean. I pointed out the oil on the table and asked for the table next to it. I had pointed out that mess on the first table but no one ever came by to wipe it down. Our servers attitude was great!!  Asian chicken salad was good, but not great. The rice noodles are okay, but some were not puffed so it wasn't the best. The shrimp sandwich was okay but the shrimp were a little chewy.  The service was great!  Lemon raspberry cream cheesecake is my favorite although I didn't get one this time around."
Emilio B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/25/2017,"This establishment brings mustard in little bowls, this usually means that it will not be enough mustard for the table, but it worked out.  The service and food were great. Availability - 4/5 Attitude - 5/5 Speed - 4/5 This restaurant passes the mustard"
Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",917,1167,5947,4.0,2/25/2016,"""CONSUME MASS QUANTITIES!"" That quote from Coneheads best describes how I feel whenever I stop by The Cheesecake Factory chain - large portion sizes from a menu that has almost every type of cuisine so loaded with calories that you need to walk your @$$ around the block a few times afterwards to burn it off.  But, when the food tastes that good, it's almost worth it! We came here a couple of nights ago to treat our mom to a belated Valentine's Day dinner.  While there's no same-day reservations offered, it's a good idea to have someone get here early to get a buzzer before the rest of your party gets there (which is what I did, seeing how I work relatively close by).  After about a twenty minute wait, we were seated and eventually made our choices (as I mentioned, that menu has almost everything but the kitchen sink). My mom ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, my brother went with the Pit Beef Dip (similar to a French Dip with au jus), and my choice was the Kobe Beef Burger.  While my mom liked the gravy with her dish, and my burger was pretty juicy (the grilled onions and mushrooms helped... even though the dressing was on the side, my burger didn't really need it), my brother was kinda disappointed with his sandwich.  Even though he finished it much to mine and our mother's surprise, he thought it was a bit on the dry side.  The tableside bread that we got prior to our orders also helped fill us up - it was pretty warm with a chewy crust, though I felt that the sourdough was better than the wheat. And of course, the dessert.  If there's at least one good thing that The Cheesecake Factory does really well, it's the myriad of cheesecake choices to choose from.  My mom went with something simple - the classic cheesecake with strawberries - and after one bite from each of us and the realization that it was very rich and sweet, we were done.  What's left of the cheesecake slice is still in the fridge, tempting us... Though the music was a bit too loud (even when the dining room emptied a bit during dinner service, it seemed like it was at full blast), the ambiance is surprisingly comfortable.  Our server did a great job checking on us, bringing us our orders, and refilling our water glasses.  Interestingly, The Cheesecake Factory has its own merchandise; while the stuffed animals seemed a bit cliché, the pins had my interest piqued. As there's a happy hour between 4-6pm (where hopefully the fried calamari is a $5 app option), as well as a Sunday brunch where the Crab Hash is calling my name, think I'll keep this chain in mind for next time."
Tammie B.,"Lakeside, CA",3,23,28,4.0,5/4/2017,"So filling. Eat your dessert first maybe, loaded tots are rich don't eat them all yourself, belly ache... zucchini was good, the ranch dressing was, too. We had two appetizers two sodas and 3 cheescake tax and tip 55.14$ hoping I feel like having my banana cheescake in a couple hours?! We also got Oreo and pnut butter fudge drizzle to go... tasty!"
Victor G.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",53,55,30,2.0,9/24/2017,It's the cheesecake factory... Chain place so nothing particularly special. We ran into a rude employee at the cake dessert area. Other than that pretty basic.
Chris H.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",109,267,766,5.0,5/11/2016,"My rating scale for this one is based on a chain restaurant mentality. If I was rating it based on all restaurants and food it would probably be more like a 3 BUT for a chain restaurant, you don't get much better than Cheesecake Factory. The prices are pretty gnarly. They're definitely over priced, but that's what happens when most of their locations are in or near a mall. Other than it being expensive, I can't really find too much to complain about. The service is always good, the bread is top of the line and the portions are large!  If you're in the area and you're looking for a sure fire restaurant, cheesecake is a solid option. Mission valley doesn't really have the best food and restaurant selection, so this is an easy go to pick."
Anson Q.,"San Diego, CA",2,14,10,4.0,6/26/2017,"Came here for date night and it was your typical dimmed down nice looking restaurant. Started off with the Calamari, lightly fried pieces of heaven and the sauce that paired with it was excellent. My girlfriend opted for the shrimp scampi and it was plated beautifully. I myself got the farfalle and it was delish. The portions were huge we could barely finish! so we ended up taking most it takeout. We couldn't just end our meal at Cheesecake Factory there so we got the dulce de leche cheesecake and that was hands down one of the best i've ever had. Overall, it's a fun place to go out once in awhile but is a little on the pricey side for me."
Olga Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,3.0,10/17/2017,"This place seems to be popular, based on the never ending lines and long wait list, but I honestly cant figure out why. The food is unimaginative and is generally very caloric. If I'm going to indulge and consume million of calories, I want them to come from a creative dish that tastes amazing. Which is far from what this restaurant has to offer. The menu is too eclectic and has everything from thai/Chinese to Mexican and burgers. I would prefer if they figured out their culinary identity, found what they might be really good at, and focused on that instead of making dozens of mediocre dishes.   Another issue is that they seem to be understaffed. Our server was friendly, but we it took a very long time for us to get our orders taken and get couple of things we asked for.  This specific location had a cozy outside patio, though, which I enjoyed."
Shayne B.,"Long Beach, CA",2,10,2,1.0,3/22/2017,I come to this one at least once a month. The food is usually always great. Tonight we checked in at 7:15 they told us 30 minutes for a table was almost an hour.  The we waited 45 minutes for the food to show up and it was cold.  The manager Cynthia came around and gave some fake apology. She didn't offer to fix anything. I really do enjoy the food here but the service is always terrible at this location.
Shannon B.,"Mesa, AZ",107,216,137,4.0,8/19/2016,I order the same exact dish everyone. Pasta da Vinci no chicken extra mushroom and extra sauce on the side.  This location had a wonderful tasting pasta da Vinci and the sauce was flavorful. The service was great for our large group!
Stephanie M.,"San Diego, CA",6,39,42,4.0,2/17/2017,Always good service. Foods good but very high calorie! They do offer a skinny menu. They NEED to start providing crayons for kids. They have  kid menu and A LOT OF families come here to eat so it doesn't make sense why they don't have coloring stuff like every other place
Ellie G.,"San Diego, CA",1,79,220,3.0,8/19/2016,"Im not a huge fan of this place...but when you get out number and don't have a choice...I guess. Anyways, I had a green spring salad - not bad...decent size. The edemame on the other hand...let me tell ya. I asked for no salt & yet they still had salt on them. I think it was sea salt because I could see the grains. I asked for a new batch & it was like if I was asking for a free meal ...C'mon people. Anyways overall my experience was just ok."
Mari F.,"Indianapolis, IN",19,139,254,3.0,10/29/2016,"This place is always crowded, so I was surprised when our party of 3 was able to get in without a wait on a Thursday at 6 for dinner. The menu is huge, so I hope this review helps you with your decision. If you like buffalo chicken wings, get them, they're really good! The grilled chicken and avocado club is SUPERB. The skinnylicious Tuscan chicken was not very good. If you're looking for something low cal, I'd say chose something else from the skinnylicious menu or just have a cheat day and enjoy your meal!"
Haley K.,"San Jose, CA",499,405,720,4.0,3/7/2016,"This is one of the best Cheesecake Factory restaurants that I've been to! It's not overly huge, there is decent parking around (free parking in the lot and structures surrounding the mall) and friendly staff. I've come here multiple times during the weekend for lunch and always been seated pretty much immediately.  The server we had last time was amazing! She was one of those that didn't write down the order. That always makes me nervous because I'm that person that requests a lot of changes or substitutions, additions, basically a lot of requests.  She remembered everything correctly and our food came out quickly! She also brought extra brown bread when she noticed we were running low and same with our drinks. Love that kind of service where you dont have flag down your waiter."
Lindsey F.,"La Jolla, CA",66,22,7,1.0,8/12/2017,"Called for curbside and waited on the phone for over 5 minutes with no answer. Called back and told the person I had been waiting for over 5 minutes to place an order but no one answered and asked if someone else could help me. He simply said ""name? Phone number? And your order?"" No apology for the wait and he was very rude and blunt. I ordered but feel super uncomfortable because I hope he doesn't mess with our food. What is it with customer service? There's a million people looking for jobs so it's surprising when people ask like then don't care about their job. Makes Cheesecake Factory look bad."
