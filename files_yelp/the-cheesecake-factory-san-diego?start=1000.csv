Mandy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,79,52,2.0,12/30/2012,"Let me start by stating that my 2 star rating is not for the food or the server, both of which kept me from rating it even lower.  We arrived on Saturday night, December 29 around 7:20 pm and waited an hour an 45 minutes before begin seated. No problem, we were willing to wait. We spent the time waiting for our dinner table in the bar area. Our bartender was Tracy, a very personable and helpful bartender, 5 stars for him. We then were seated at our table, our waiter was very attentive and nice. The food was great. We ate our entrees, ordered dessert and that's where the experience goes south.  We were seated at a 2 person table with a four person table to my right and a 2 person table to our left. As we received our dessert, the apparent manager on duty seats a partial party of 8 on either side of us with the remaining 2 diners from the new party left hovering around waiting for us to leave. The tables on either side of us are now having conversations over us as we eat our dessert. We didn't even have our check yet.  One of the waitresses serving the area actually points out to the manager (dark brown or black hair wearing a maroon dress shirt and I think they were grey or khaki colored slacks) that it is not right to seat this party while we are still eating, and he yells at her. SHE WAS RIGHT. The manager is having this conversation with the concerned waitress directly behind me, offers no apology for the fact that we now have 2 tables of people talking over us, pushing for us to leave, never mind the grown men a few feet away leering at us as if we are in the wrong. It's unfortunate that the last 15 minutes of our evening ruined the experience, but it is an honest assessment and deserved based on the poor judgment exercised by the manager, perhaps he should receive some more training."
Jay Jay M.,"San Diego, CA",302,126,1,5.0,1/19/2011,I've been going to this cheesecake factory since it opened at fashion valley and it comes through everytime! They have a great staff and although there's a wait at times you have an option to sit out in the gorgeous patio or inside. I love their spinach dip and you can never go wrong with their alcoholic drinks. I prefer their Mango rita thats blended. ITLL CRUNK U UP! I always go with the Chicken Madera for my main course.  It comes with a great slab of boneless chicken with an awesome caramelized sauce with mushrooms. It also comes with a huge serving of mashed potatoes and 2 asperaguses or however you call it. haha Their Dulce De Leche Cheesecake is to die for with the whipped cream and I always get it to go. You must go here if your in fashion valley!
Rianne D.,"Chula Vista, CA",732,531,1090,4.0,7/31/2008,"I'm craving dessert and what's a girl to do?  I'm froyo'd out.  Just say no to RiteAid ice cream!  31 (not even!) flavors?  Too far!  But, wait...the Cheesecake Factory isn't too far away. When Cheesecake Factory first opened in Mission Valley, it was the cool place to meet up and have dinner with friends.  Then, EVERYONE and their moms found out about the place.  The wait line turned from 30 minutes to 2+ hours.  Screw that!  So, I gave up going to CF. Four years later, open the Cheesecake Factory, in Chula Vista. Unbelievably, dinner wait time during weekdays averages 20 minutes.  Weekends are about 45 minutes.   Not bad, unless you were me yesterday and happened to show up for their 30th anniversary. I ran into a wall of bodies jockeying for $1.50 cheesecake slices.  1 1/2 hour wait to order and get your buck fitty cheesecake slice.  Average 45 minute wait for a table for four.  Party of 8?  75 minutes...luckily, that wasn't my party.  Definitely unusual for a typical weekday...but it wasn't really typical, was it?  Conveniently, there is a mall to walk around, if you don't want to hang out with the crowd and make some new friends. Despite the overall madness of crazy people wanting their slice of the pie, we were still promptly seated, within the 25 minute time frame.  Wait staff was quick and efficient.  (I always wanted to ask how they try to stay so clean, wearing their white uniforms.)  The decor is beautiful, but it is a bit dark, especially around dinner time.  (Does anyone else notice that?) More lights please!! Favorite dishes include the chicken marsala with mushrooms, the Chinese chicken salad or the lemon-herb roasted chicken with mash potatters.  Double-thumbs up for the dulce de leche, chocolate raspberry truffle or kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake.  Large enough servings to put this healthy (insert sarcasm here) eater into a food coma.  And, even though on the average cost of food is a bit pricey, it's still a great place to go to and enjoy.  If price is your issue, there's always happy hour!!   Even with all the chaos, the staff was on their toes and we even scored on the $1.50 cake craze.  Gotta appreciate that, especially when the average slice costs $7.  The Cheesecake Factory is a cool place to go to, even if it's just once in a blue moon.  Definitely, can't go wrong, when you got a sweet tooth to feed."
Jason K.,"Paris, France",8,6,1,4.0,8/10/2014,"Been to this Cheesecake Factory about five times and four times I've had a great experience. The worst experience became the time that we waited for 15 minutes straight without even being offered the menu or a drink, and when we had asked to be placed in a different section with another server, we waited exactly 10 minutes before we complained again and were then offered drinks. This whole experience became very dissatisfying and after complaining to our server (forgot her name, but a nice older lady) who explained the problem to her manager, we were complimented the cheesecake. Might have been an off day with the hosts that day, but nonetheless great service most of the time!"
Roxana T.,"La Mesa, CA",0,25,,5.0,1/13/2015,"we had a great experience at cheesecake factory last Saturday even though the wait was long.The food was delicious, the dessert was awesome.The manager Mehdi was so professional,he apologized for the wait.Our waiter Mike and Chris were so polite and caring.Thank you again for your service."
Megan B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",23,33,1,2.0,10/28/2013,"I am quite disappointed in our visit last night. Previously, we have visited the anaheim and riverside locations and they weren't anything to write home about but they also weren't awful either.  On to this location: we were seated right away even though the lobby looked full. I'm guessing those guests were waiting for the cheesecake line.   We were sested at 4:10p. We had a party of four that ordered soups and salads off of the lunch special meal. Apparently, when you order a salad, you should just expect lettece, tomatoes, and dressing. Nothing else. I was pleasently surprised with the size of the soup, I just wish the quality was equivalent. Canned soup. Yay.  My husband ordered the pizza and he hated it. It looked like a tombstone *frozen* pizza. Plain, greasy. We ordered 2 cocktains and they were just as much as our food but about the size of a low ball. They make sure to add lots of ice so it gets watered down and can fit in a bigger glass. 11.95 for a long island, but 8.95 for soup and salad?!  We left at 6. On a sunday afternoon it should not take almost 2 hours! Never again.  Ever. I'd rather make my own cheesecake or support the local bakeries before I would ever go back here again."
Carlo R.,"San Diego, CA",86,212,70,3.0,11/30/2011,"A bit too busy.. hard to get attention of the staff.. but the food selection and quality is superb! If you want a loud place with a lot going on and great food and drinks this is a fun restaurant for that.  always a line though, FYI!"
Noel J.,"San Diego, CA",360,377,3,5.0,12/15/2008,"Big Corporate Restaurant Chains are usually not that good.They are just conveniently there when your out and about and when you eat at them you soon regret it.  I have to say that the Cheesecake Factory is one of the few exceptions.  The food is really good, and they have a lot of selections.  You want some Chinese? Done. Craving some New Orleans style jambalaya? Got it here. They have pretty much everything here and its really good.  My newest craving is the Miso Salmon, which is glazed with God Sauce and sits on top of a bed of rice. Its fucking good, and pretty healthy.  Oh, and then comes the cheesecake. There has to be about 50 different kinds of awesomeness guaranteed to get you laid by your date.  It gets really busy sometimes so there is a bit of a wait, but its well worth it."
P H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2110,1595,4321,4.0,3/15/2011,"*Review is for the cheesecakes* Came here with Yelpers: Candace L., Sam B., and Rory C. Decor: 3.5/5 -Same as all other Cheesecake Factories -wash your hands after using any menu, it's dirty Service: 3/5 -pretty average -had to hunt her down for the check Cheesecake: 3.5/5 overall -Pineapple Upside Down: small bits of pineapple. Not a cheesecake but this was perfect. Not too rich and creamy, the cake was spongy and flavorful. My favorite of the night.  -Fresh Strawberry: I was expecting NY style cheesecake, this was different. I'll give this another chance in the future.  -Lemon Raspberry: this would be great with just the lemon cheesecake alone. The raspberry syrup was too sweet I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory so I rounded up to four stars."
Alex D.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,5.0,1/26/2015,"My favorite restaurant!  Always great service and the best food.  They get u seated fast even when they are busy and really aim to give u a great service.  The dishes i get is the fried calamari,  and ribeye steak.  I also recently tried the raspberry lemon cheesecake and even though my girlfriend and i don't really like sweets we ended up finishing the entire slice since it was so good!"
SunnyCali Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,82,14,2.0,1/31/2013,"I think this place has a good rep because of the array of menu choices and the ambience. The golden lighting is very sexy. But the food, including the CHEESECAKE, is just ok. Nothing special. I actually think Jack-n-the-Box's cheesecake tastes better."
Erin C.,"Keller, TX",254,357,161,3.0,12/4/2012,Ok service and expensive. On occasion it's fine but nothing special. $90' for 2 people? Hmmmmm
Jeff P.,"San Diego, CA",14,11,,2.0,2/17/2014,My first time at the Cheesecake Factory.  We waited 1.5 hours to be seated.  Not real impressed.  The food was less than OK.  My wife's pasta was hard.  We were served bread but I had no setting.  I had to request a setting 3 times.  Hard to butter the bread without a knife. The restroom was filthy with overflowing dirty paper towels.  It was filthy. I won't eat here again.
Michelle Z.,"Bonita, CA",9,37,12,1.0,11/13/2015,"Extremely annoyed with this particular location and staff. I constantly dine here so typically I would speak of it positively but not after what happened recently. My mom and sisters had dinner there, but I stayed home so they ordered take out for me. I only wanted a salad, which apparently took them 30 minutes to bring out. And they forgot the dressing. I ordered the kale & quinoa for the first time, which should just be called the kale salad because that's all that was in it. I was already in a bad mood from being hungry so forgetting to add the dressing only made me angrier. I decided to call and let them know, and they transferred the call to the manager. I couldn't be bothered to remember his name but he seemed frustrated that I didn't know the receipt/order #. My mom paid cash - why tf would she keep the receipt? He proceeded to ask me a million & one questions, where I tried to answer the best I could (since I wasn't there). I even told him what my mom and sister ordered for dinner. He said he would try to figure out what he could do for me and get back to me. This obviously shouldn't take days. All I wanted was a simple apology. And when restaurants mess up they'll usually comp your meal (or send a gift card if it was take out) not pound you with unnecessary questions then lie about doing something about it and never reach out. So unprofessional, I'm very disappointed with the management here. The two other locations are way better."
Paola R.,"Honolulu, HI",201,401,80,4.0,6/20/2011,"Best cheesecake ever!!! Highly recommend the Kahlua Cheesecake and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Really, I don't think you can go wrong with any of their cheesecakes, but these are my favorites.  The service is alright. This place is always really busy. All of the entrees I've had have been good, but nothing special."
Shannon S.,"San Diego, CA",18,27,39,5.0,2/24/2013,"went here last weekend with my bf and it was really tasty. downfall we sat outside, there are heat lamps but it wasn't as warm as i hoped it would be.  i ordered a pasta that was sausage and brocoli, had asparagus and tomatos, with penne noodles and buttery sauce. the portion was huge, took it home for leftovers and still was good the next day!  dessert: peanutbutter banana honey milkshake, it was very sweet and huge, downfall: the shake was not thick at all.  great waiter, believe his name is darren, very attentive and nice. he deserved his tip"
Audra W.,"Chicago, IL",35,76,224,4.0,7/11/2013,"Great attentive service! The appetizer and the alcoholic drink ( if you get one) will make you full. The entree is huge and the dessert is what you come to enjoy. Our wait time was moderate, 20 mins.. not very long."
Tracy B.,"San Diego, CA",10,68,2,4.0,10/6/2013,Always good food! The wait is long even on weekdays but that says a lot. We order curb side take out to avoid the wait. Good place to eat!
Naree D.,"San Diego, CA",6,13,,1.0,4/29/2013,Again bad service again The food taste good but very slow. Service is the worse ever.
Houtan Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",412,104,5,3.0,7/1/2013,"This place is always packed for whatever reason, but we go here because we love the Fried Mac n Cheese balls mainly and if we are being really bad, the Chicken and Biscuits entree (which were taken off the menu for a while then brought back).  The main reason we come back is because the food quality is pretty consistent and the service is usually above average.  Another reason we come here is because the majority of other non-franchise restaurants we go to in San Diego just do not live up to our expectations."
