Jessica L.,"Fair Oaks, CA",108,96,69,2.0,6/21/2011,"I like how the two stars basically said it right, ""Meh.  I've experienced better"".  Cheesecake factory is a chain so I totally understand that their food would not be the best or freshest in San Diego.  The free bread that they give out is good, but usually served cold and their food sort of seems like it's all pre-made stuff that they microwaved or just threw in a pan to heat it up.  I'm always satisfied with the food because the portions are HUGE but omg their calorie content is mostly over 1,000 per meal! While this usually doesn't bother me, I still don't like to consume over 1,000 calories if the meal is just meh.  I love their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake but for just one tiny sliver of a slice and the price we paid for it I think i'll just try to make it myself at home haha. Their service is most of the time great and are helpful at times, refilling my waters when it was running low. For their price and the type of food they serve there are definitely better non-chain restaurants around."
Melanio F.,"San Diego, CA",991,798,314,3.0,7/23/2008,"To me not being a Cheesecake lover and knowing a restaurant in a mall is going to be busy, Cheesecake is A-ok.  Let me start out that timing is the key.  Going on a Weekend is a no-no since the mall is already crowded.  Weekdays, better be hungry btwn lunch and dinner to avoid crowds and even be seated outside on a nice day. That being said.  In my opinion the food is ok, some are better than others, portions are plentiful as well as choices.  This is the place to go if you have a group with varying appetites and all want a nice sweet dessert to end the meal. My experience after having a bloody mary for appetizer is this, service is fine for a busy and crowded place, seating is comfortable and menu can be overwhelming but not bad when you are drinking. Recommended for families and large groups.  Not recommended if in a hurry. Bloody Marys: Available - 1/2 star Condiments - 1/2 star Taste - 1/2 star Strenght - 1/2 star Total = 2 Stars ( wasn't expecting much, did not get much!)"
Lisa N.,"San Diego, CA",265,255,163,3.0,5/30/2013,"I love coming here, I love getting the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta. Its one of my favs! So I came here the other day with two of my friends. Service was ehh. Our server did not look like she liked her job. I believe her name was Kristin. She doesn't smile. She has this straight angry look at all times. She isn't even friendly either. When she cleared our tables, well obviously my friend is done. But if you're going to ask someone if they're finished with their plate, let them respond before you grab the plate. She was grabbing the plate as she was asking the question! Unacceptable service. I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times, and all the other servers are nice and friendly. Makes you feel at home. This on the other hand, I couldn't get any more ready to leave. But food was good as always. Also had their Peach Bellini cocktail, a must try!"
heidi t.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,1,1.0,2/22/2013,"Warning! EGGS EXPLODING ON FACE!!!   I'll make this short - ordered the crab-hash off their brunch menu over the weekend. For my eggs, I like ""hard-poached"" so ordered it as such.  Eggs came out runny and not poached hard so sent it back.  Food came back after about 15 minutes - I dug my fork into the eggs and the eggs EXPLODED!! Yes, HOT eggs got in my eye, clothes and all over face including the splatter getting to the table behind me.  It was the most bizarre/dangerous and very disturbing restaurant experience of my life.  Luckily, I didn't get too hurt and didn't seek medical attention so this won't be turning into a huge lawsuit for these guys.  Apparently, if you cook eggs in the microwave, they explode - when I sent back the poached eggs, they must have just microwaved it and served it right up!"
Tam B.,"La Jolla, CA",6,59,27,2.0,7/29/2013,"I usually love any cheesecake experience but this time it was slow service, I asked for the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (my favorite) without the chicken, when they first brought it I showed them that there was in fact chicken in there and I asked them to take it back by the time they brought me my plate my food was cold and not satisfactory."
Tracy C.,"Dallas, TX",782,371,115,2.0,2/17/2013,"Every now and then, I will get an itch to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. Then I will go and remember the long wait to be seated and the extensive menu to choose from. While an extensive menu might be viewed as a good thing, I don't. Shorter more refined menus mean the chefs have learned to perfect and improve upon the meals. Long menus mean factory ilke environment where cheap and easy is the goal.  But with factory in the name, I guess the bar is set pretty low. The food was just that... fairly low. I just hope I remember that the next time I get an itch to return."
Silvia K.,"El Cajon, CA",74,37,20,1.0,1/16/2011,"The Cheesecock Factory is just that- full of dicks.  Management is rude, the food is overly unhealthy, the wait is atrocious, and the whole company is a gluttonous wreck of obese monsters.  They overwork their employees and are so ungrateful for the long hours they spend tiring away in their establishment.  Labor laws need to be enforced in that place! If you plan on eating there, you should read on: If you even knew how many grams of fat were in their food and cheesecakes, you would just die.  However, I don't know what you would die from first:  The sheer shock of the nutritional data or the trans-fat that is about to clog your arteries.   I know these things because I used to work there...and yes, I gained about 10 lbs while working there b/c we were forced to try all of the menu items at least once.  That place still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Gross."
Eddie V.,"Long Beach, CA",13,32,2,4.0,1/23/2011,Food is usually pretty tasty. You have to save room for cheesecake! BUT the downside is it's usually jammed packed with between a 30 min and 2 hour wait. UGGH
Keri Y.,"La Jolla, CA",3,3,,1.0,12/3/2011,"Romantic date spot? Most likely. But for Grandma's 95th birthday? Maybe you should think twice. For anyone who plans on making party reservations, please read this first. We were set on coming here for our friend's 21st birthday dinner. The day before the event, we called to reserve a space for our 20 guests, but were told, by the hostess herself, that reservations could only be made the day of and starting 30 minutes after the restaurant opened. So, as per their instructions, we called the following day, maybe 40 minutes after it opened?  And what  were we met with? The host, a different one this time, tells us that reservations can only be made WITHIN 30 minutes of opening. We informed him that it was THEIR staff who told us otherwise, but they refused to make the reservation, and told us instead to have someone show up 1 hour before our dinner so they can save the space. Can someone explain to me why they prefer a 1 hour notice over the SEVEN that we were giving them by calling? The summary of the explanation he gave afterwards was that you can't make reservations for the nighttime because those are their busy hours. I understand that this place gets very packed, but that was the point of our reservation. Their website says ""we can accommodate parties of up to 40 people"", but they've made me feel like I have to work everything around them. I'm sure this restaurant is amazing food-wise, but their service leaves much to be desired.  These other yelp reviews about their service are definitely true, but i'm impressed that they're able to extend this to customers they haven't even seen yet. I have yet to step into this restaurant and I'm already turned off."
Chris W.,"Memphis, TN",84,139,32,4.0,5/28/2011,"I just don't get the Cheesecake mystique.  I wanted to give three stars because of the ridiculous lines that seem to be omnipresent, no matter which Cheesecake location you go to in any state.  I don't want to spoil their ratings just because I'm impatient.   But I guess I'm just not sure 'why' these people feel the need to wait so long for average food.  From my experience, the drinks are weak and the loud atmosphere tends to agitate me.  Service is adequate as long as you don't get a server who's about to go on break, which seems to happen to me more than it doesn't.   That's about it for the Factory from me.  Not really worth more discussion in my opinion.  This I know.  I will never be the Duke of this place.  I don't want to waste so much of my life waiting in those lines!"
Charlene C.,"San Diego, CA",8,10,2,5.0,1/18/2011,"I really can't help but love this place. The food is tasty (the brown bread!), full of calories, and a bit pricey, but I always have leftovers and don't come here often so its ok :) The Buffalo Blasts are so good and I am continually fascinated about how the delicious chicken, buffalo sauce, and wonton wrappers work so well together! Ordering these was just reason enough to come here. I always used to order the Crusted Chicken Romano, but my new favorite is now the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic with extra sauce. The sauce itself is so tasty and as much as I've tried to replicated it, Cheesecake Factory certainly does it right. My bf ordered the Shrimp Scampi which came with pretty big and flavorful shrimp! The accompanying pasta was good too. Even though we both didn't finish our dishes, we ordered the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. It was good, however I will never forget the Triple Chocolate Chip Cheesecake that used to be my favorite until it was discontinued.  We came on an a Monday around noontime and there was no wait. Our server was pretty nice and prompt, which made the progression of our meal efficient and not lengthy at all."
Janel L.,"San Diego, CA",429,58,32,4.0,2/24/2011,"This place is always a hit or a miss when it comes to the service.  So far I've had more of an issue with the hostesses than the servers/waiters.  The hostesses just seem to want to get you out of their way and to move onto the next party waiting.   Went here a few weeks ago with the family, and had the most AMAZING server.  It was a 20-something tall brunette, and she was absolutely wonderful.  I wish I remembered her name so that I can give her proper credit.  Not once did our water cups go dry, and not once did we have to flag her down.  She was consistently coming back to our table making sure everything was good.   Biggest downside to any Cheesecake Factory restaurant is the wait time.  It's ALWAYS crowded, ALWAYS busy, ALWAYS a long wait.  If you wanna cut some waiting time, ask to be seated outside on the patio.  It's fairly nice outside, more intimate and not as hectic as it is inside, and the patio's loaded with heater lamps anyway. 4 stars to the waitress who provided the best service i've ever experienced.  0 stars for the hostesses and their lack of enthusiasm and connection with their customers."
Alexandria H.,"Poway, CA",59,11,1,5.0,8/15/2013,"Favorite restaurant in all of San Diego! I have loved the Fashion Valley location since I was little and the avocado eggrolls are so crispy every single time! It never let's me down and even if the wait is over an hour and they don't take reservations (at least they did not used to, things change so they quite possibly might have them now) I am more than happy to walk the mall and do a little shopping while i work up and appetite to eat the well portioned, best quality, great atmosphere that I will gladly call my favorite place to go to on a variety of occasions! I was surprised to see  one in North Carolina at their very upscale shopping mall that our Fashion Valley mall had not a darn thing standing in comparison."
David J.,"La Jolla, CA",24,179,7,2.0,8/14/2013,Food is ok. Nothing special.  Looks cool outside... but the food is mediocre.  And the service is pretty bad.
Alberta N.,"San Marcos, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/5/2015,"Good food, long waits. Try herb crusted salmon. Yum"
Kevin E.,"San Diego, CA",124,231,15,4.0,2/19/2013,Years I have been giving them my money...   Extensive menu and good quality.  But DANG...  Watch the drinks... They can really add up.
Michael G.,"Yokosuka, Japan",202,125,163,5.0,1/26/2013,I love me some CCF!!! Def recommend this one. We have never had a bad time or dish here.
White R.,"Marana, AZ",12,202,5,4.0,6/2/2013,"This place has plenty of seating, plenty of menu options, and great cheesecake. The food was delicious, the drinks were pretty good, and overall it was a great experience. My only complaint was that on this day the service was extremely slow, but being in with family it gave us time to catch up and talk. I'd definitely come back here again sometime."
Rayanna S.,"San Diego, CA",1,19,18,5.0,1/3/2014,"If you are craving a yummy meal and a delicious dessert, The Cheesecake Factory is definitely the place to go! A variety of all different types of foods from salads, burgers, pastas, to steaks, seafood, and tacos. They have it all! And after a delicious meal, save room for a piece of cheesecake! You will not be disappointed - my favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the 30th anniversary (not too chocolaty, in my opinion). I've never been disappointed here, and also the complimentary bread and butter is delish - keep it comin! LOL. Mid-ranged priced but definitely worth every penny. Ahhhh craving a piece of cheesecake right now!"
Jonathan E.,"San Diego, CA",391,347,53,3.0,11/30/2012,It's the standard Cheesecake Factory food. I had a turkey burger which was pretty well cooked considering it is on the healthy menu with calories being under 550. Definitely filling. The Oreo cheesecake that I had with my girlfriend was too rich for my tastes. I wish it wasn't so pricey though.
