mike l.,"Fremont, CA",41,59,,4.0,9/10/2010,"Cheesecake factory always hits the spot. Aside from the 30 minute wait, everything else was on point.  Friendly waiters, yummy food, fair prices. We ordered... Crab cakes as appetizers. They were ok.. Not great, not bad, just ok. Bistro shrimp pasta, absolutely amazing. Large portion size. The shrimp was lightly battered and fried, the sauce was creamy and had a little zest to it. I plan on ordering it the next time we visit cheesecake factory. Strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Simple, sweet and just the right thing to cap off your dinner.  4 *'s!"
Christopher J.,"Glendale, CA",207,253,299,4.0,4/26/2011,"==The Cheesecake Factory== Hmmm. I know the location is near the mall so parking is always an issue, but this side of the mall there is never any parking in their tiny little private lot near the place. You'll end up driving up and up on the parking structure next to the factory. So don't expect to find parking right up near the place. Ambiance is nice, yet very loud. Low lighting and very spacious inside. They also have nice outdoor seating areas which is pretty relaxing on a fine San Diego day. The cake slices are way overpriced, but the portions of the actual food are HUGE. You can feed two people with one dish. I'm so serious. Very good helpings for the price that you pay. This place gets pretty crowded around dinner time so, there might be a 15-30 min wait  for parties larger than two.  ==The Food== I ordered the chicken tenders and boy were they tender! Make sure you get a dipping sauce. I believe it comes with two different sauces and it comes with fries too. I also had a Caesar Salad which was very fresh and cold. Even the plate was cold. How it should be. I was craving a cappuchino too so I got one of those and it was actually pretty tasty. Although, I wish they would add a hard candy stick as a stirrer like most french places do :)  -_- The Breakdown -_- PROS:: 1] Very huge portions on the dishes 2] Great ambiance and very spacious 3] The food is good American Quality CONS:: 1] Expensive cake slices 2] Parking is a nightmare"
Roseann S.,"El Cajon, CA",84,81,6,4.0,4/25/2011,"I've been here 3 times in the past 3 months..yes I know..that's too many right? But honestly I'm in heaven when I get my order of Ahi Tartare! I also really like the Miso Salmon with Brown Rice. I don't really eat brown rice, but the mixture with the miso salmon was just perfect. I also get my regular order of the White chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I recommend the fresh banana cream cheesecake. It comes with fresh bananas on top with whipped cream. The place gets really busy and reservations is non existent. You will have to have your whole party there in order to even put your name on the list.  It is pricey, but it is well worth it. The food is just so good to even notice the price.  Wait time is ridiculous long but definitely worth it. Especially for the cheesecake"
Brian B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",426,698,43,3.0,7/24/2010,"Had dinner here the other night and it was mediocre, actually didn't come out right and had to be sent back. Second time it was nearly perfect, but with 2 tries I would think it would be perfect.  There are many diverse things to eat off the menu, the real problem is narrowing it down. The second problem is that the portions are so huge, that we shared an entree and still didn't have room for cheesecake. =( The restaurant is in a huge mall, depending when you go the parking lot can be a challenge to navigate and park."
Mark B.,"San Jose, CA",2,15,,2.0,5/27/2013,Long wait time for everything and food came cold last time I was there.. Typically average at best food. I'd rather go somewhere else. I seriously doubt I'll ever go back.
Brianna M.,"San Rafael, CA",2,44,9,2.0,5/25/2013,"The wait took forever. 45 minutes just to get a table to eat over priced food is a bit much for me. The food was delicious but what got me was during the dessert time. It was my friends and my birthday. Our waitress said that we should order cheesecake to celebrate but we declined because for one we are obesely full and second its overpriced. Once our waitress knew we declined it, then she gave us free ice cream with a candle. I'm sorry but don't push your overpriced cheesecake on us when we have already spent a lot of money on food and wine."
Katie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",892,411,31,4.0,9/6/2012,"I had a great experience here! There is a large crowd and normally a long wait but Cheesecake Factory does there best to accommodate their guests! The crowd is not their fault but would suggest adding onto to the restaurant! I ordered the corn fritters, chicken littles, Louisiana pasta, and cookie dough cheesecake and enjoyed each meal. Drinks are good I likes the peach Bellini and tropical mojito. Drinks are a bit expensive especially since you are not at a fine dining restaurant. We paid $11.00 for a mojito which I found ridiculous !"
Jared G.,"San Diego, CA",40,169,7,5.0,3/29/2011,"I know giving 5 stars to a massive chain restaurant like cheesecake factory might make people question the integrity of my rating system but after much thought i just had to give this place 5 stars. Ill try and justify why i would give 5 stars and YES this is the only mass chain restaurant i would give 5 stars too. For me coming here satisfies everything i look for in a restaurant- Nice decor, Great customer service, clean facility and bathrooms, a dish i never get sick of (chicken madeira), and a dessert that is amazing! So based on all that i have to give it 5 stars becasue i always leave feeling satisfied. i have been to a cheesecake factory over 50+ times in my life and on every single occassion except 2.... i have ordered the chicken madeira. This dish is amazing. Its tenderized breaded chicken breast covered in madeira mushroom sauce with asaparagus and cheese topping it off. Served with a side of Mashed potatoes my mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I have recommended this dish to several people and have an overwhelmingly positive response to those who have taken my advice. 2 times ordered a different meal to try and venture out and explore the menu and both times in the end i was kicking myself for not getting the chicken madeira. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert so im sure that helps me further justify my 5 star rating. I recommened the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I have tried the red velvet cake cheesecake which is part cake and part cheesecake and it is really delicious. However the red velvet cake cheesecake weighs in at 1500+ calories.... so keep that in mind all you gym rats and calorie counters. The white chocolate raspberry is a little more user friendly at around 700-800? i cant remember exactly. Still a lot but atleast you can split the cheescake because chances are your stomach is full from all the food. The portion sizes are huge and sometimes i even pass on dessert because i just couldnt fit it in my stomach. Ok thats my take on cheesecake factory and yes i love this place a lot!"
Abe P.,"San Diego, CA",5,9,,4.0,4/22/2010,Always great food and great service.  I love their pumpkin cheesecake; too bad it is only seasonal.   The Con? Prices are high.
Monica R.,"San Diego, CA",64,37,7,4.0,1/18/2013,"Wow! I have lived in san diego for 36 years and have never been because i hate cheesecake... Little did i know the food is amazing!! Huge portions, fresh, and delicious!!  Omg i cant wait to go again!  Two things i would do different though: go before 530 pm... Wholly cow this location is wayyyyy busy and an hour plus wait after 6pm... But sooooo good... And second, sit inside if its freezing outside... The heater lamps are nice but really cold at night in the winter.  A couple of tips to the place: 1) make your bar area larger by taking away some of the patio or something... Wayyyy too small at night.  2) get more ovoerhead heaters on the patio and dont use the stand up ones that dont work well :). But seriously the service and the food rock!!"
Kaylee H.,"San Diego, CA",21,188,41,3.0,8/8/2012,"Cuz and I went to the CF for lunch today as kind of a special ""lunch before she has a baby and her life is over"" kind of thing.  The last gasp, as it were. I have to preface my review by saying that I really do not like Fashion Valley.  The stores are overpriced, the people working in said stores and snotty beotches, and there is NO PARKING.  The only time I venture to this devil's den is to go to PF Chang's and The Container Store.  My love of PF Chang's trumps any issues I have with this Faux Beverly Hills Mall.  As does my love of organization.  But I've never had trouble finding parking when going to PF Chang's or The Container Store, because they're on the fringe of the madness I guess. So after driving up and down and up and down the aisles of the parking structure (silly me, I thought we'd be able to park in the covered lot so the car wasn't hot as the surface of the sun when we returned), I threw in the towel and parked on the top deck, in the sun.  Should've brought a brisket and left it on the front seat, I wouldn't have had to cook dinner tonight. We walk over to CF.  And let me just add here that, the architects of the parking structure (on the north side of the mall along Friars) didn't take into account that people might want to walk from the structure to the restaurant, and not directly into the mall.  To get to the restaurant (or PF Chang's or The Container Store) one has to walk across the busy street and walk a bit and then cross again to the other side when the sidewalk finally begins, or risk one's life by walking in the street.  And hey, even though it's a small street inside the mall parking, people drive like it's Indy for crissakes.  And it's exacerbated by the valet parking doods who figure it's worth risking their lives and the lives of men, women, and children to get a good tip.  Whatever. We enter CF and it is packed.  Here's what I am thinking:  Don't these people work???  Surely they can't all be spoiled unemployed wives like Cuz and I.  Happily though we were seated very quickly.  Unhappily, the tables are thisclosetogether.  If you're into privacy (and being able to actually hear your meal-mate), forget this place.  The reason I give this place three stars is for their ""Skinnylicious Menu.""  I LOVE IT.  I love eating at restaurants that go the extra mile for the odd duck who wants to eat healthy (me).  The menu is long and has lots of yummy, and relatively low caloric, appetizers, entrees, and even cocktails.  Gotta love that!  I had the Skinnylicious Pear and Endive Salad, with Grilled Chicken, Endive, Radicchio, Arugula, Butter Lettuce, Roasted Pear, Blue Cheese, Candied Pecans and Tomato Served with a Low-Cal Vinaigrette.  It could've used some larger pecans but I know they're trying to stay under a certain calorie count.  Cuz had Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos.  We both had iced tea which was very refreshing on this stinkin hot day in August. The waiter brought us some bread and here's where points are deducted from the initial five-stars:  Bread that is not warm, with cold hard butter.  What am I supposed to do with that?  This country doesn't know enough about how wonderful bread is when it's hot and the butter is smooth because if they did there would be rioting in the streets to correct the injustice and shame of cold bread/frozen butter.  Either warm the bread, or serve whipped butter.  Come on people. Waiter was fine, not great, just fine.  Service was not speedy but not an unusually long wait. Bottom line:  I would return to eat at CF if they had locations other than this mall, but the mall, the parking, and the wait all add up to:  Probably won't return to this one."
Skyler W.,"La Jolla, CA",0,9,,4.0,9/23/2011,"Came here yesterday with my friend Ryan. Haven't seen one another in almost 5 years-lots to catch up on! We went at 2pm-no wait (for once). Ordered small plate of the crab cake bites (6 minis)-yum!!! Ryan ordered a Louisiana bowtie pasta dish. A little spicy, but good. I ordered a lunch version of a cobb salad? It had yummy avocado, apple, bacon, chicken. Came with balsamic. I got ranch on the side tho. It was really good. So, I always get some piece of cheesecake with chocolate in it somewhere. But today I thought I would be different and get the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Before doing that I asked the waiter-what is your fav? He pointed out-Banana Cream Cheesecake! Hmmm.... I was daring and it paid off! Super yummy!!! Light & fluffy. Thanks waiter. I didn't catch your name (very tall, older gentleman). Only problem-I didn't want to go to work after a meal like that.   :("
Andrea K.,"Poway, CA",12,30,,4.0,1/3/2011,"The good and the bad (From recent visit): Good: Service, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Pineapple Upside Down Cheese Cake (I love it b/c it isn't too sweet), Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Brown Bread. Bad: Cobb Salad, Always busy, Gaining 10lbs"
Maggie K.,"El Cajon, CA",0,42,,5.0,12/16/2014,Never a bad dish at this place!! From presentation to quality of food it is always spot on. Tried their chipotle chicken pasta..A MUST HAVE!!
Felipe G.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,4,4.0,7/30/2011,"National Cheesecake Day at The Cheesecake Factory Today!  Went With Some Friends To The Cheesecake Factory Today With The Intention of Only Eating Cheesecake But I Somehow Ended Up Eating Chicken Fettucini Alfredo Which Was Delicious But Pretty Pricey At 17 Dollars. Anyways Back To The Cheesecake. I Ordered The Carrot Cheesecake And One of My Friends Ordered The Oreo Cheesecake For Me Since He Wasn't Going To Eat Any. They Were Both Really Good! I Cheated Really Bad On My Diet Today With The Fettucini Alfredo and Cheesecakes But It Was Well Worth It. So Far I've Tried Reese's, Original, Oreo, Banana, Red Velvet, Brown Sundae, and Carrot and Liked All of Them! I would've given them 5 stars but the waitress completely forgot about my friends Georgia Peach Drink until she reminded her 10 minutes later."
J H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",2,47,1,5.0,6/13/2011,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory?  Seriously, I've never met a person who didn't like this joint!  The cheesecake selection is fantabulous of course, but their food is just as excellent and worth having even when you're not in the mood for dessert. I have never ordered anything from here that didn't taste great, and there is a large selection of food for almost any taste. We usually go here for special occasions, because of the price and calorie count, but it's always a must when visitors come to town too.  Can't keep all that cheesecakey goodness to ourselves...plus once they know how amazing it is we can rub it in their face when we go there after they've went back home. Muhahaha!!!"
Rich M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/14/2014,"This place is awful!  I would rate it zero stars if I could. The wait times are extremely long to get a table. Once you get a table now you have to wait for a waiter more waiting,.. 1.5 hours to eat seriously...   I only went there because it was a friends birthday and that's where they wanted to eat... The food is not that great people, prices are terrible too, Spend your money elsewhere there are far better restaurant out there."
T S.,"San Diego, CA",12,307,,1.0,2/22/2013,"Just a review of their curbside service. It's terrible, slow and inefficient. I've been twice in the last week.  Both times, i've waited12-14 minutes between the time i called and was curbside to the time my food arrived.  Plus a couple years ago, i waited so long that my car battery died. It's 2013--get a mobile credit card reader like all of the food trucks have.  it would make the process a lot faster."
Kelsey O.,"Portland, OR",178,12,,4.0,5/9/2012,I was personally contacted by the manager after posting this review and leaving a comment on their website. He apologized for the incident and offered to send a gift card for a future visit.
Cat A.,"Orange County, CA",1340,412,3739,4.0,1/10/2010,"I know what you're thinking... 4 stars for Cheesecake Factory? Yeah, so...I love the place!  Wait time is an hour you say. Eh, sure, go ahead and give me one of those buzzer thingys. We can just scope out the bar and see if we can slide in on some peeps that are leaving.  (Eyeballing tables to see how much food is left)  Oh there's one. Nope. Well, let's see if we can just order a cocktail then.  Drinks....damn, not cheap and not strong. But alright... tick tock...  Now I am freakin' starving.  I can't go over everything I've ever order. I've been going to Cheesecake forevAr. The menu hasn't (really) changed and the portion and taste hasn't either. I must admit my faves are the following:  -Artichoke and Cheese Dip: Oh so creamy. Filled with artichoke and full of warm, gooey, cheesy flavor. -Calamari: This is one of my favorite grubs anywhere. They do well by it here.  -Thai Lettuce Wrap: Messy but somewhat healthy and filling. Lots of dipping sauces that I'm a fan of. So.... maybe it's not so healthy. It's enough for a meal and not just an appetizer.  -Shrimp and bacon club: Big and plentiful pieces of sweet, tender shrimp and smokey bacon. Oh, their fries, me likes. Absolutely perfect meal for lunch or dinner.  -Chicken piccatta: Sautéed chicken breast with lemon sauce, mushrooms and capers. Served with angel hair pasta. Enuff said.  -Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp: A thai dish that is a bit ""americanized"" but still full of curry yumminess.  -Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken: C'mon... I heart rotisserie chicken and I heart this. Really juicy, savory chicken. The mash potato is something I stay away from not because it's not tasty, but because it'll fatten me up in two bites.  -Salads: You can't go wrong with whatever meat/topping/dressing combo.  Anyway...let me stop there. Obviously I've tasted quite a few things...several times over. And to say that you'll have leftovers, is an understatement. And regardless that it's a chain, I have never frowned at anyone when they mention wanting to eat at CF. I know there's other places to try but I don't ever mind ending up here. It's pretty cheap for all the food you get and I have always enjoyed each and every meal.  Basically, you come here knowing you'll have to wait. Service has always been friendly and professional at this location as well as the others I've been at. They are always running around, but will make sure they get your food to you as soon as they can and will come back to check on you thereafter. So all is good on that too. CF has just given me many years of wonderful memories of good eating with good company that I needed to give it some love. But I have left the best detail for last.....  Ahhh,  .- At the end of it all, a bite of you and all that coffee-ish, cocoa-ish creamy goodness, is what solidifies this eating journey's worth it's wait. OH,  HOW I LOVE YOU!"
