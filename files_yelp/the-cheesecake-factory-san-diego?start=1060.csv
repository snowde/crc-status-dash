Shanah C.,"La Mesa, CA",16,432,61,4.0,11/28/2012,"Ok, this is one of my favorite places, so I don't understand how I've never typed a review before today??   I'm a HUGE fan of cheesecake, so that in itself will get me every time!! But the menu is SOOOO huge, it almost becomes impossible to make a decision! They have apps, sandwiches, salads, pastas, seafood, pizzas... and over 30 flavors of cheesecake!!! Of course you're always too full for desert, but you can always order it to take home (Believe me it's worth it!!!) I have never ordered something here that wasn't delicious and the portions are HUGE! They don't take reservations and it seems like no matter what time of day or what day of the week you go, there's gonna be a wait... but here's the secret... the high top tables in the bar area are open game, so you ""stalk"" someone and watch to see when they are getting ready to pay the check, then ""linger"" near their table so you can JUMP on it as soon as they get up! Otherwise expect to wait 30 minutes to an hour!!"
Cathy H.,"San Diego, CA",2,33,,4.0,3/18/2011,"The food is really not all that great. But it's mediocore. What I really like is the environment (particularly the interior decor). I like the seating arrangements.  The staff is also great. Very friendly and very fast. I LOVE THE CHEESECAKES.  Love that it's located in Fashion Valley Mall...very convenient. It's a fun, nice place to go to especially when you just want to have fun with your girlfriends."
Brian C.,"San Diego, CA",4,31,8,2.0,4/14/2013,"The place was packed when we got here.  We were seated in about 15, they stated 20, so thats good.  Wife had Georgia Peach drink, which she really liked. we both had burgers.  I would say they were good.  Service was above average.  We sat outside on the heated patio, which is why they get 3 stars.  It smelled like Bourbon Street in New Orleans it was horrible.  DONT SIT OUTSIDE!!!!!!"
Gabe H.,"San Diego, CA",677,610,811,4.0,4/9/2010,"Had lunch today with the BF. I had the Cuban sandwich and he had the pasta da Vinci. Also I had a bowl of vegetable chicken tortilla soup. Overall I would say it was a good meal. Nothing bad but nothing to write home about.  We were sat right away which I thought was pretty cool.  If you know anything about the Cheesecake Factory, you can wait like forever for a table.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  My drink was refilled regularly.  Overall it was an ok experience that renewed my faith in the chain."
Troy P.,"Palo Cedro, CA",35,57,13,4.0,4/7/2013,Great food and great service if you can find a parking space good luck.
Krissy M.,"San Fernando, CA",9,60,,1.0,5/24/2010,"I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory until I heard the horror story from my friend today.  It's sooooo disgusting that I had to share it.... So, she had lunch today and ordered grilled artichokes...her favorite.  She's eating it and enjoying it as she always does there, then BOOM....a maggot and what looks to be some larve!!!!  Not even kidding.  I'll try to post the picture of it if I can. She gets the manager, Tony, and he apologozies and asks her if she wants another.  Yeah right, who could eat after that!  She's so disgusted that she has to leave so she asks for the bill.  Tony doesn't even comp her lunch!!  She basically makes him and this is what he says about the maggot, ""Artichokes grow in the ground and there are worms in the ground.  These kinds of things happen"". WHAT????  I'm pretty sure a food establishment shouldn't have maggots or worms in their food.  It sounds like a case of employees not doing their job.  Tony, I'm pretty sure the health department would give you an F.  Maggots come from flies and we know what flies sit on all day.  GROSS!!!!! So yeah, I will NEVER eat there again...or at least not until some serious changes are made."
Rachel Q.,"San Diego, CA",279,584,46,3.0,2/5/2011,Chicken madiera.. yum.. yum.. yum! Service was sloooooooooooooooow here.. and it was 2pm!!  It wasn't even during a major meal time..  Our wait time to get a seat was about 10-15 minutes.. and getting our drink orders was pretty quick.. but getting the drink took forever.. and getting our food took forever.. They are lucky that I like Cheesecake Factory.. and the food is good enough that I can overlook the slowness..
Sirinda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,558,52,2.0,1/7/2011,"Ugh, I should know better than to keep returning to the Cheescake Factory for their food.  Every time I've eaten there the food is bland and greasy.  Their menu is huge but unfortunately everything on it is equally mediocre at best.   However, I will return happily and as often as possible for their cheesecake.  They have an awesomely huge selection of flavors and each is utterly delicious.  So, I gladly give 5 stars for cheesecake.  The Tuxedo is my favorite."
Thao N.,"San Diego, CA",28,61,1,4.0,8/4/2014,Love this location! Their spicy chipotle pasta is my favorite dish and I highly recommend the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. The reason for four stars instead of five is because they don't accept reservations and their wait time is really long.
Meg M.,"Los Angeles, CA",959,170,138,4.0,7/26/2007,"My love for the Cheesecake Factory began when I was young.  Growing up in Agoura Hills, the Original Cheesecake Factory was right down the street from us in a commercial area ... BEFORE they served food....hence the name, The Cheesecake Factory. Soon, they added a cafe type menu and were only open for lunch, usually only seating MAYBE 20 people at a time.  I used to love leaving my high school campus for lunch to get the Lunch special BBQ chicken pizza, salad and a piece of cheesecake.  Now years later, it never ceases to amaze me how much the restaurant chain has grown, and how insane business is.  Now, I usually stay away since the lines waiting to eat there appear longer than a marathon race.   Today, was different.  A friend of mine and I hadn't eaten all day, so we decided to head over early for ""Linner"" figuring 4:30 shouldn't be too busy.  We were seated right away on the patio and handed the novel they now call a menu.  What a difference 15 years makes! HA! Being that I wanted to save room for CHEESECAKE, I decided on the Lettuce Wraps... they were so yummy!  HUGE portions, 3 different sauces and a bunch of different additions to the marinated chicken make this appetizer a meal!  Light and refreshing, even with romaine lettuce instead of ice berg, the lettuce wraps were a perfect answer to linner. ;-)   And most importantly, I had plenty of room for cheesecake... (well, 1/2 of one) It took me another 15 minutes to go through the dessert menu, and I finally decided on my old stand-by, T he Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake..also known as HEAVEN. Layers of our Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate make up this decadent delight that dances on my tastebuds (nice alliteration, huh? lol) The perfect ending to a great memory of my youth and I still have a 1/2 a piece of heaven in the fridge!"
Dung N.,"San Diego, CA",147,51,16,4.0,10/9/2012,"Came here on a Friday night around 9ish and it wasn't too long of a wait. Maybe 30 mins. The service has always been on point for me. Waitresses always smile and are welcoming. I've tried about 20% of the items on the menu and have not had a complaint. If you go to the cheesecake factory, I feel like it's a must to have a slice. They definitely have a wide variety of cakes and I am pretty sure you'll find something you like. Oh yeah they close at 12 am on fri-sat so that's always nice."
Tina F.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,14,14,4.0,7/27/2011,This is one of my favorite restraunt!  I love their raspberry lemon cheesecake and chocolate cheesecake! My favorite dish is Jamaca shrimp!
Yelp U.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/16/2014,"Great food and location. I come here about once a month and considering the location, I think the service here is phenomenal!!"
Antonio C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/17/2012,"This location is perfect. Love the food here, vanilla bean cheesecake for the win!! Service is hit or miss but then again I'm not really coming here to make friends."
Tania H.,"San Diego, CA",4,17,,5.0,12/5/2014,I'm a huge fan of chocolate and loved the Oreo cheese cake so much!  My waiter was very nice and tended to all my needs! I'm a happy regular at this wonderful restaurant.
Richard W.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,,4.0,7/26/2012,"Wow, I see that huge mingling crowd of people outside the door as I drive into Fashion valley and have always passed by thinking ""at least an hour wait""  A friend and I gave it a shot last weekend and found a wait of less than 10 minutes.  Sat adjacent to the bar at the high tables with 4 chairs.  We had excellent and friendly service from Richard. The food exceeded expectations and the shared Coconut chocolate cheese cake was very good.   The cheese cake is a bit overrated(once you've had the best NY cheesecake  anywhere else is hard to beat) however the CC Factory versions are  decent.  Try the ""Skinnylicious"" menu--for relatively lighter fare. I will return and I hear a rumor that July 31 they are giving away half price pieces of cheese cake. Whoaa...imagine the lines out the door for that one."
Trey B.,"San Diego, CA",146,15,11,4.0,3/12/2010,"** Visited Tuesday 3/8/10 around 3pm. ** Let me first say that I am a cheesecake whore. WHORE! I would do ungodly things for the right cheesecake. So, suffice to say, if there is an entire factory for said divinity, you are likely to find me in front of said establishment trading sexually explicit and lascivious acts for mere crumbs. I've been to the locations in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace a couple times each but this is my neighborhood Cheesecake Factory. I went with my room mate Sarah on Tuesday between lunch and dinner (linner?) and it was one of our greatest foodventures! EVER! She started off with a Typhoon Punch, which was tastey and deceiptively alcoholic. I had a Sprite. For starters, Sarah ordered a full Caesar Salad and I ordered the Pizzette Margherita. The server recommended we down-size to the appetizer portion of the salad and we're glad we did! Even the smaller portion was HUGE and more than enough to share between the two of us. Sarah ordered the Chicken Madeira. She has her own entire review about it. I've had it before and decided to branch out with one of the seasonal specials, Chop Salisbury Steak. Per.Fec.Tion. My steak came burried under a mound of perfectly caramelized onions with fresh hand-mashed potatoes and baby spring green beans in a light butter garlic sauce.  I tackled the green beans first and was suprised at how a vegetable could be so light and rich at the same time. The potatoes were lumpy and delicious, as always, with a savory gravy made from the drippings of the steak, not the usual cream or dairy-based heavy stuff. The Salisbury Steak was also cooked perfectly. It was seasoned well, but not overpowering and all the components on the dish complimented each other extremely well. OF COURSE THERE WAS CHEESECAKE !!! (see first paragraph above) We ordered the Stephanie's Cheesecake to share for dessert. Two layers of red velvet cake between two layers of original cheesecake plus one layer of sourcream frosting equals five layers of cheescake orgasm! Our server was attentive without hovering. And the portions are enough to fill you up and still have some to take home for another meal - or at least a heavy snack - so you don't feel bad that the entrees range from $12 - $20 (up to $40 for steak entrees). We spent $100 between the two of us, but that includes a refill on Sarah's Typhoon Punch and us each having a full course meal with enough to take home, two large appetizers and a dessert to split. You could easily get away with $20/person if you're a little more cautious. But I had just received my tax return and this was a FOODVENTURE! The only thing I could ever hold against Cheesecake Factory is how self-important it is. I'm not sure what rustic Italian Renaissance-esque decor and 30' ceilings have to do with cheesecake, but I always feel like I'm eating in a museum. A little better than fast casual dining, to be sure, but I could do without the gourmet posturing. I will say that we have used Cheesecake Factory many-a-time for Birthdays and group events, but we usually get shunted out to the patio. They are pretty good at handling large parties as long as you don't want to sit inside. It would be much more convenient if they accepted reservations. If you're gonna be that posh, at least give me the illusion that I can secure a table ahead of time. Mos def one of my favorite places to eat, especially if you're going to indulge! ***** for the aMAYzing food, form beginning to end -*      for the stuffy ambiance. Seriously, I've worn a tie here before and                still felt under dressed."
Shelly L.,"San Diego, CA",115,185,34,4.0,1/7/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is fantastic! I like this location. The service is so so because it is located right outside the fashion valley mall. The menu is huge and everything always comes out on par.
Mama S.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",17,21,6,1.0,7/10/2014,"Possibly the worst service I've ever received. As I sat down and got my silverware out of the napkin, I noticed my fork had a big piece of food stuck on it. When I told the waiter, he didn't apologize at all, just got a new set and next thing you know, we didn't see him for a good chunk of time at our table, as he kept on serving other people. Food was deplorable. My boyfriend $29 dish had overcooked steak and dried up salmon. Mine was ok, except the server forgot my side and when I told him, he failed, once again to apologize for the poor service. Our drinks were often empty and he never offered to refill them, and he didn't even bother asking how our food was. I had never done this before, but I left a $0 tip. Thus was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in my life."
