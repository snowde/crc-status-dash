Jessica R.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/7/2013,"It might sound like an overstatement but there's usually no place I'd rather be than at the Cheesecake Factory. They have splendid dishes varying from steak to fettuccine. Every time I go there I always order their legendary cheesecake. My particular favorite is the S'mores one  which is absolutely delightful!!! Even though the line is usually quite long, it honestly is worth the wait."
Christy H.,"San Diego, CA",12,307,1,1.0,8/26/2012,"Ordered curbside and it was disastrous. Called 15 minutes ahead of time while I was still shopping at the mall. When I got to the curb side parking, it still took almost 45 minutes to get my food. I called the manager of the store 3 times to complain about how long it was taking. I'm not even sure they actually gave me a manager when I asked to speak to one. The real kicker is...all I ordered was one piece of cheesecake to go..."
Jacquelyn Q.,"San Diego, CA",180,155,17,2.0,11/24/2009,"This is, by a landslide, the most overrated restaurant in San Diego. I understand that the location in the middle of the insanity that is Fashion Valley Mall provides for a ton of foot traffic and I guess having a ridulously-lengthy menu would work best for big groups because there truly is something for everyone, but the truth is that the The Cheesecake Factory does not deliver good food or great service -- both are just ""meh."" I have been to this location at least a dozen times in the last few years for family functions (my husband's mom loves this place for some reason) and most recently for the anniversary lunch of a co-worker. Each time I am annoyed beyond belief at the insane parking situation, the masses of people standing in line like they are at Disneyland waiting for a table and the general feeling that I am in the middle of mayhem.  The employees are ice cold, look overwhelmed and apathetic to the fact that you may have waited an hour for a table or had to ask five times for a drink refill. Especially with a large group, the service suffers the most at The Cheesecake Factory. Good luck getting their attention, because your server may not be back for half an hour...  Regarding the food, it is OKAY. I have had many of their entrees and, while they have never been horrible, for the price (around $20 each entree), I guess I have higher standards.  If you insist on eating at a chain, walk across the packed parking lot to PF Chang's and have some lettuce wraps and Mongolian beef for half the price and ten times the taste. The Cheesecake Factory should have just stuck with making cheesecake -- because that is clearly their saving grace."
Christine D.,"Escondido, CA",32,138,93,3.0,2/19/2011,"After a long day of shopping with the fam we usually dine here to save us the hassle of going back home to cook. For dinner they are usually busy, but the wait is never too long. At least 10-15 minutes at most. Service is usually slow around dinner time, but I guess the food makes up for it. Everything here is great! My favorites are the shrimp bistro pasta & the spicy cashew chicken. All the portion sizes are huge. I'm sure you would have 2 people finish an entree. Remember to not finish everything, save room for dessert. All the cheesecakes are to die for! I prefer the red velvet cheesecake, white choc macadamia nut, & the kahlua. Mmmmm everything is sooo mouthwatering."
Lisa N.,"Los Angeles, CA",689,710,179,4.0,11/2/2009,"i've never really had anything against chain restaurants, and i still don't. i've always loved cheesecake factory. the pasta dishes i order rarely fail to please me. sure, it's a bit on the pricey side, and it may or may not be authentic (i wouldn't know), but i don't care..it tastes good!  i was here about a week ago for my friend's birthday..ordered the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. good choice. a bit sauce-y, but luckily, i love sauce-y! haha generous portion (for $15, it better be..), i even had enough leftovers for another meal. pancetta, garlic, chicken, mushrooms?! can't go wrong. i also tried my friend's pasta da vinci, and mmm...that was really good too.  other things that made this an enjoyable experience? the complimentary bread and butter! haha i love the brown bread they provide...to hell with the atkins diet. i also tried my friends pumpkin pecan cheesecake? pie? IT WAS SO DELICIOUS..and i don't even really care for pumpkin.  also, usually, at chain restaurants..or any restaurant having to serve a party of like..12, i'd expect some crappy-mediocre service, since they know they'll get gratuity anyway. i was pleasantly surprised to receive EXCELLENT service here, all thanks to our server, paul? that was the name on our bill..asian dude, long, wavy hair..haha he was super patient, attentive, friendly, etc...which is hard to do when you've got 12 indecisive girls trying to decide if they want to stick with something safe because they were unsure of how to pronounce ""farfalle...."" (ok, that was just me). haha he was kind enough to pronounce it for me and reassure me that everyone had trouble with that word (might be lying, but that's ok, because i felt better)!  if i didn't feel like this were overpriced pasta, i'd definitely be back more often.."
Kevin L.,"San Diego, CA",55,9,,4.0,3/6/2011,"Another lovely experience at cheesecake factory. =D The service was great! And this time only 10 mins wait... woohoo... I heard a lot of ppl complain why there's always an hour wait... Hm... I went there today at 4:30pm for dinner... it's only 10mins wait, and you can still order food from the lunch special menu!! I ordered four cheese pasta, it's not bad, but not cheesey enough. My favorite dish is mini crab cake... yum..."
Foodie L.,"San Diego, CA",1,30,,4.0,6/17/2012,"4 stars for the cajun jambalaya pasta, sunday brunch and free refill for ice teas! The cajun jambalaya pasta portion is huge! it has both shrimp and chicken. the chicken is flavorful and tender and the shrimp is pretty good too. nice presentation and perfectly cooked pasta the sunday brunch is fun. i've had the giant belgium waffle and the crab hash with eggs Benedict.  i'm not a fan of the avocado spring rolls- they are mushy/soggy the service is hit or miss/but for the most part ok they have free wifi"
Mohamed A.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",5,5,,5.0,5/29/2013,"My favorite restaurant on earth, although they used to have on the menu the prime ribs which was extramazing was so soft and tender but for some reason it's not there anymore. But they do have the 1- Ribeye steak the one and mostly amazing piece of rib eye accurately cooked to your order. 2- One of the best fillet minion ever And definitely must try the cheese cakes with different flavors and tastes. 100 % would recommend this place for everyone although it might be challenging to get a table."
Vicky L.,"Palo Alto, CA",812,1621,112,4.0,9/11/2006,"What amazes me about this place is that I can drive by Fashion Valley at 330 PM on a Wednesday to go shopping and there is a line outside Cheesecake. I think the only time I don't see a bunch of people out there is in the middle of the night! I swear, people are there ALL the time.  The food there is moderately priced, except for the cheesecake. It's outrageously priced. The Ralph's in La Jolla carries their cheesecakes for a fraction, same with Costco. But I guess having a slice at the end of dinner or lunch is part of the whole dining experience.  They have definately done very well in standardizing all of their dishes. I have visited multiple locations and the food generally is excellent and tastes exactly the same everywhere.  Appetizers are ingenious, and the entree's are very large. Salads are quite creative too.  Arrive early, the wait can be horrendous. My ex took me there for V-day a couple years ago and we stopped by at 4pm to put our names down and then wandered in the mall for awhile, to come back in time to eat at 7! I absolutely love cheesecakes. Don't get me wrong or anything, but I haven't quite figured out what the hype on their cheesecake is, aside from their 30 different variations on it. Their cheesecakes are GOOD, but don't really stand out in my mind."
Ruben A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",68,251,192,4.0,10/24/2012,Had a slice of Oreo cheesecake.  VERY GOOD AND sinfully delicious.
Nena V.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,4/3/2013,"Our family's been here several times before & our experiences have been pretty good with the food but the highlight is always the cheesecake which we absolutely love.   Our most recent experience on Easter Sunday was just so-so because of the service.  The sun was shining very brightly on half our table.  When we asked the hostess if there was a sunshade, she said no.  My daughter and I decided we could handle the sun because we didn't want to wait for another table.  Later found out that there is a sunshade which our waiter lowered for us but it only comes down to the top of the booth - pretty poor design.  It did block some of the sun providing us with a bit of relief. Our table was sticky & it took forever for our food to come out.  Our waiter seemed like a pretty nice guy - said he was embarrassed about the wait so he had the manager bring our food out himself.  The manager never apologized or explained why there was a delay.  We took our cheesecake home to eat later.  It was great as usual.  For the money we paid, I wish our time at the restaurant had been more satisfying.  Probably should've eaten dinner somewhere else & just picked up cheesecake to go."
Jonathan T.,"Queens, NY",77,30,2,3.0,7/3/2012,"Long lines, good food, average service. Another location in San Diego would help."
Ala A.,"Sunnyvale, TX",0,5,2,4.0,9/4/2013,came for desert and ended up ordering salad and shrimps and cheese cake. I will go there for the cheese cake which was amazing
Jenny M.,"San Diego, CA",59,65,25,2.0,8/15/2012,"It's a chain,what can I say. I come here for the standard chopped salad and a half priced super-sized beer during happy hour after experiencing the HELL of fashion valley. Then I feel better."
Sarah L.,"El Cajon, CA",4,18,,2.0,10/30/2011,"Normally we love the Cheesecake Factory, but our last experience here may have turned us off for a while.   We ate dinner here on a recent Saturday night.  Things started just fine.  We were put on a wait list, called within the amount of time quoted to us and given a little table outside.  After that- everything changed.   Our waitress arrived at the table sort of distracted.  As she was taking our drink order another member of the wait staff came by and dropped off bread at the table.  It was more of a drive by bread drop than anything.  There was no butter with the bread.  Not a big deal, but a little strange.  We never say anything about this, but it plays into the rest of the meal.   We order our food and about 15 minutes later my entree comes but there is no sign of my husband's.  The waiter who delivered our food asked if my husband was eating.  He told him he was and what he ordered and the waiter says he will look into it.  I proceed to wait for them to deliver the other entree.  Ten minutes go by and our waitress comes over and asks if my husband enjoyed his food (I suppose she saw no plate and assumed he had finished and it had been cleared?!)   We told her the food had not come and she said she would look into it. Another ten minutes go by and the waiter who delivered our food comes back and says there was no record of my husband's entree but he put it in and it would be out shortly.  Five minutes go by and the manager comes over to apologize.  Mind you, he still does not have food, and I am waiting for him to eat.  His food finally arrives and the burger is cooked wrong.  At this point my food is cold, but we're hungry and are really not complainers, so we just eat.   The bill comes and we were sort of expecting a free slice of cheesecake, or a comp entree or something for the giant mix up, but there is nothing.  In fact, they have charged us TWICE for his entree.  It takes another 15 minutes to sort this out.  I give them my card to pay and butter is delivered to the table.  Mind you at this point the plates are cleared the bread is gone and we're totally turned off of the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley."
Charles H.,"Oceanside, CA",52,50,9,4.0,12/5/2012,"OK so my friend and i wanted to do something special and i said why dont we go to the cheesecake factory. At first i was going to go to the one in the OC but then i thought well i have never been to the one down south so ill go. Well we drive there and we get there and the parking situation was a MESS, be prepared to drive around looking for a spot and marvel at all the people outside waiting to be seated (UGH) So anyways we get there and we ask for a table for 2 and they say its a 30 minute wait, cool because i have never been down there and wanted to windowshop. We windowshopped and then decided to come back after 25 minutes and still had to wait about 10-15 minutes more. Sat down and i had the shrimp and bacon club(best thing on the menu) and the fried macaroni for an appetizer The food is delicious and i used to think it was expensive but in reality for the quality of food it is not. I love the franchise but this location is just too crowded for me."
Ryan D.,"Acton, CA",1,132,1,5.0,1/30/2013,"Certainly one of the nicest locations for a Cheesecake Factory. Our wait to get seated was well over an hour, but I was the one with the bright idea of coming on a Friday night at 6:30! Service, Food, and Atmosphere were excellent though... As usual."
Leah R.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,,1.0,10/7/2014,"*This review is for to-go/curbside ONLY-their dine-in is fine. Two terrible experiences with this particular cheesecake factory and their to-go team: 1st: So I used to work in the mall, and everyone knows how precious each minute is for lunch time when you are hourly. As a fellow service member, I have so much sympathy for food service and understand how tough it must be to please people when they are hungry. So i come in ordering two slices of cheesecake for myself and a coworker and it was pretty empty on a weekday. I was the only one in line for to-go, and everyone else was waiting to sit in the restaurant. I order my cheesecakes with Guy #1, and Guy #2 starts prepping for them. Guy #1 then turns his back to me (which is fine) and starts gabbing about his date to his other coworkers while Guy #2 makes my cheesecakes. He finishes in about 3 minutes and sticks them on the counter. Guy#1 is still turned around and does not see these cheesecakes are done. I'm still standing there waiting for him to realize they are done. I could have reached for them, but seeing as I'm only 5 feet and their cheesecake display counters are high I couldn't reach. I finally got them after another 5 minutes of Guy #1 chatting about his potential Friday night plans. 2nd: I called in my order on a Tuesday night at 6:52 (saw the receipt) and knew I would be there in around 10-15 minutes for curbside. Once again, I ordered 2 cheesecakes and some bread thinking these things were already made and just needed to be in place in to-go boxes and bagged up. I arrived at 7:04 and called them informing Erica I had arrived and was waiting outside. In between calling and FINALLY getting my food, two cars already got their order which were hefty family orders of appetizers, entrees, and cheesecakes. I kept thinking what the heck? I just ordered 2 cheesecakes? Finally, this girl comes out at 7:23, but she had to ask me for my name as she brought out the wrong order. She took my $20 and said she'll be back with the change and the correct order. It took her another 10 minutes to do all that. I finally got my food at 7:30. The whole process took 40 minutes for 2 cheesecakes (and they forgot the bread). She also didn't even give me the correct change, just breaking my $20 asking me ""what would you like back?"" In my head, I'm thinking...""all my change!!!"" But, I had to settle for 3 dollars back since this girl didn't understand the concept of breaking my $20 with change and everything. (I didn't want to tip her at all, but i settled for $0.36 when I was planning on just giving the whole $20 if they had given me my stuff on time).  Anyways, don't do to-go or curbside if you want a LOOOOOONG experience."
Amy L.,"Lake Forest, CA",331,377,286,3.0,10/3/2010,"Love how its right by the mall, but the food is just okay. I definitely go to cheesecake factory more for their desserts and cheesecakes as oppose to their food. There appetizers may actually taste better than their actual dishes. Cheesecake factory has a myriad of tastes and choices, you can get something Asian inspired to Italian pasta.  I love their avocado eggrolls, its definitely enough for lunch if you want something light.  Dishes: jambalaya pasta: disappointing. I ordered this and there was no sauce on it. It was dry, they put sundried tomatoe in it and it was still hard and inedible.  They do however, give a good portion for a good price. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends who has different tastes and preferences. This is always out default restaurant when we can't make a decision."
Sofia S.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,4.0,6/17/2013,WOW!  I love this place so much.  Great meals are served by the friendliest of employees.  I think they have great food but the dessert menu is the best.  my faves are of course the cheesecakes and brownies.  I DEFINITLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT FOR EVERYONE!
