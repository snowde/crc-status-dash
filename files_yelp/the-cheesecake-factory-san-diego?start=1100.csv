Jenni Y.,"San Diego, CA",134,213,393,2.0,3/25/2010,"I ordered Evelyn's favorite pasta thinking the last time I ordered a pasta, it was only oily because of that particular pasta, I was wrong. I despite it being a veggies type of pasta, there was still oil all over it. It was gross. Another thing was that their pasta hadn't been cooked long enough so I was eating hard oily pasta."
C F.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/11/2011,So as soon as we were seated at our table the waitress gave us rules because we were such a large party. After this she was very rude and never checked up on us. When it was time to bring out the $60.00 cake i custom ordered she had already stuck the candles in with out asking . Instead of asking how old the birthday girls were she stuck 24 in and failed to figure out that they were turning 17. On top of that I could not even take a decent picture of the cake with the candles spread out in no order. As i asked for her manager he came and laughed about the whole situation and say i cant do anything about it. When i then got make check she said she wasn't going to charge us a plating charge in which we didn't even ask her for and that that was all she could do. HORRIBLE place would not recommend to anybody! The service is embarrassing for such an expensive restaurant!
Sarah T.,"Washington, DC",130,111,12,4.0,1/22/2010,"This is actually a 3.5 (Yelp really needs to give us the 1/2 option..) However I'm rounding up because they did make me happy in the end!  I have lived in San Diego on and off for nearly 10 years (give or take 6 months or so..) and I had never been here before. (I'd eaten a slice of their Cheesecake here once with an ex who didn't want to eat inside.. So we got it to go and ate it on a bench outside.. Yeah that's why he's an ex... Anyway..) It was good but I didn't feel I'd experienced The Cheesecake Factory well enough to say I've been there before.  Last night my BF was determined to have me eat here. He called to find out if they had any specials or happy hour, the host wasn't very helpful.. Simply put: No. When people call you to ask why they should go to your restaurant, it's your job to tell them why and make them WANT to come, the guy on the phone was very short and curt with us. MINUS ONE.. We decided to go anyhow, because my BF knew I'd love it.. We went 6 different ways to get here and all were flooded.. Ick, eventually we completed our mission and arrived.  When we walked in I overheard the hostess bitching to another girl about a couple wanting a booth.. That girl rolled her eyes and said ""Of course they do..."" Snobs, who cares if a couple wants some privacy while they enjoy their meal. The hostess greeted us and took us to a table.. shared by about 5 other groups (One long bench with several tables in a row...) I'm sorry but I didn't want to sit next to a bunch of strangers while I gorge myself on their massive menu. I ask for a booth and the girl looks like she might slit her wrists. ""We don't have any booth's available currently..."" I respond with a huge smile, ""It's okay, we'll wait."" She nearly stomped back to the front and I see the other girl roll her eyes again. MINUS ANOTHER ONE.  We were seated about 4 minutes later (Seriously, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and when I came out our table was ready...) It was a booth right by the kitchen.. (Ugh, better than the first option.) We sat down together and I couldn't believe how uncomfortable the bench was! I mean, I've got some serious junk in the trunk but my padding wasn't helping at all! I felt like I was sitting on nails it was so uncomfortable. MINUS THE THIRD ONE I hate uncomfortable seating, it makes me feel unwelcome.  Our server came over and things finally started to get better. He was much friendlier than the girls at the Hostess Station. We ordered a bottle of wine the Pinot Noir Mark West & my BF got a beer. For our appetizers we ordered the Avocado Egg rolls w/ Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce and Stuffed Garlic Rolls. The egg rolls were phenomenal and that sauce so amazing! I will go back here simply for this item! PLUS ONE! Unfortunately the Garlic Rolls came out cold (easy fix though, they took them back and brought out some new ones). They were tasty, the cheese on the inside was mediocre & I didn't taste enough garlic.. MINUS HALF OF ONE (how do you mess up a cheese, garlic, & bread combination?) For our entrees we ordered the Crispy Chicken Costelleta & the Farfalle w/ Chicken & Roasted Garlic (substituted penne pasta instead) When our food came out I was SHOCKED at the portions! My plate of Chicken alone could have fed a 3rd world country! Both dishes were delicious! The pasta had huge slivers of garlic and was so full of flavor! The Chicken Costelleta was so tender & juicy with such a great crispy exterior (oh and the lemon sauce they serve it with is mouth watering!) Neither of us finished our plates, YAY for leftovers!! At this point I didn't know if I could manage a slice of cheesecake, but my stomach surprised me when I took a look at the menu.. Kahlua Cheesecake or Coconut was the decision.. It all looked good but it came down to those two. Coffee won out and I picked the Kahlua... OMG it was so decadent! Absolutely delicious, after three bites I was satisfied and knew it would be going home with me as well. The manager was nice enough to check on us after our Garlic Roll mishap and when my BF asked, he gladly had them comped from the bill. (That made me happy!) PLUS ANOTHER ONE.. So all in all for a hundred bucks we got: A good bottle of wine, 2 apps (one comped), 2 entrees, a slice of cheesecake, & leftovers for the next day! 3 1/2 Stars! Food was great, Server (Thomas) was friendly & honest while giving recomendations, but the Hostess Station Sucked.."
Flora K.,"Corona, CA",32,117,29,1.0,10/10/2009,"So mediocre and overpriced with unecessary huge portions. I have also experienced problems with service here.  Obviously, if a restaurant menu has EVERY type of cuisine on it, you know that they probably aren't really good at cooking any one of those things. The Cheesecake Factory is not a Mexican restaurant, yet they have mexican on the menu, likewise for asian, indian, and italian cuisines. I ordered a plate of chicken enchiladas. The plate was huge and had tons of food, yet everything tasted so mediocre. I found a disgusting curly HAIR poking out of my enchilada. I told the waiter and he told me that I was wrong, it was not a hair, and it was actually from a corn husk. Yeah. RIGHT. He then offered to get the manager for me, because I was not satisfied with his explanation. The manager came over and told me the same thing. She offered me a new plate, but obviously why would I want a plate of the same thing I found a hair in, or any type of food at all. My appetite was gone. I declined the offer for a fresh plate and she did not offer me any type of discount. Both the waiter and manager still would not admit it was a hair. Seriously?"
Marie T.,"San Diego, CA",4,17,6,2.0,10/8/2012,"Really disappointed. This restaurant used to be in my top 3. Went here recently, excited that they had my favorite dish (it had been a year since I had last been here, and they ran out of it when i tried ordering), the lemon herb roasted chicken. My goodness, that thing was dry. Also, if you want top notch service, it looks like it is a must to complain. Our table was very neglected, but that just might have been our server. Too long of a wait with subpar food...I think I'll pass and go somewhere else next time."
Carol M.,"San Diego, CA",0,22,3,1.0,5/16/2013,AWe had a family gathering Herr on a busy Saturday.  The waitress seemed very helpful when I explained my lactose intolerance.  She offered me a bunless hamburger which I specifically ordered medium.  Five of us got their meals but my cousin and I had to wait st least seven minutes for ours.  Unacceptable.  When my burger arrived late it was burnt on the outside.  Never again for me: lousy service.
Kevin S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,32,1,2.0,3/13/2013,Service is poor. Staff have lack of friendly customer service (attitudes). Food is OK. The average to below average customer service is consistent with this location.
ES L.,"La Mesa, CA",7,61,25,4.0,11/2/2010,"Lunch special:  Stuffed Mushrooms, Crispy Crab Bites,  Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, and Chicken Pot Stickers, all were good and tasty. My favorite are the Pot stickers and mushrooms.  The Crab bites are bites, I wanted more...  The waiter not so good, just spacy. overall the food is good"
John T.,"Plano, TX",2,12,1,3.0,9/23/2009,"Cheesecake is my weakness...how can I not like a place called ""Cheesecake Factory""?!? Ah, Cheesecake...even if you don't go for a meal or drinks, it's worth your time just to sample the *C*heesecake with a capital *C*. Try the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake if you really want to reward yourself. Mmmmmm! The food is rather tasty as well, with a large variety of different dishes; seafood, American, Mexican, etc. The menu is twice the size it should be, due to the advertisements on the left-hand side of each page. That's what kept this review from being a 4-star versus the 3-star I gave it. I look at a menu to decide on food, not decide on advertisements. Bad move folks, bad move. Pricing is not too bad given the quality of food, service and consistency. I've been to this establishment in four different states, and they have all been worth the visit. Well, worth the Cheesecake anyways! =)"
Ray B.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,49,7,1.0,1/6/2013,"The Monte Cristo sandwich isn't one. Do I want old scrambled eggs on my sandwich? Do I want cold greasy hash browns? Do I want to bite into soggy, dried out ham, tasteless cheese, and have the horrible tasting grease run down almost to my elbow? Oh, sorry, forgot,  the Smuckers strawberry jam, the whole tablespoon I got, was awesome. And STOP putting straws in my water glass!! Where the hell have those things been? My last trip there. Oooooh, and they took my sandwich off the bill. Gee thanks manager that didn't show up for 20 minutes."
Jennifer B.,"Temecula, CA",18,29,6,1.0,10/14/2012,"So not very happy with the service, takes us to a dirty table, then didn't get our food for a long time, then got hair in my ranch dressing. The manager then comes out and says must be a bad batch sorry and said he'd be right back and doesn't even come back. Nothing else. Was said. And no compesation."
Lex N.,"San Diego, CA",447,8,1,1.0,8/1/2011,first off how is the cheesecake factory out of oreo cheesecake? isnt it the factory?! but seriously i will never go to this place again.   1. my friends food was incorrect 2. his food came out 15 mins before anyone elses 3. it took asking for Tabasco sauce 3x to get chalula (sp?) 4. my friends wife had to get up and get it for us. 5. the omelet i ordered was missing the sour cream on top ( never got it) 6. the salad i ordered didnt come with dressing and i had to ask 2 people to get it b/c the other person forgot.  7. also took asking 2x to get my fiance ranch with her chicken ( 10 mins later) 8. only one of our drinks ever got refilled( the entire time) 9. they screwed up the check / it was supposed to be split up (between the part of 4 into - 2 and 2. Overall I will never recommend going to this place. They had plenty of staff available and half of them didnt know what customer service was. Even after the manager spoke with us the service didnt get any better. this place is horrible.   my crappy experience was on 7/31/11 at about 1pm
Nalinee P.,"San Diego, CA",31,4,,5.0,3/31/2014,"We were seated out on the patio quickly on a sunny day our waiter Steve moved some umbrellas and then it was perfect, he accommodated our family and brought the drinks and food out quickly. Always impressed with the quality of food when we come! THANK YOU for the great experience!"
Orlando R.,"San Diego, CA",16,60,69,2.0,3/27/2010,"I have been here many times and enjoyed it but as for my last time I was here..2/14/09 ya valentines day. I vowed I would never go back and stuck by it, haven't been back since. They have great service when it's not a really busy day, quite the contrary when it's bust there food and service sucks. That's bad for a place with such a high rep. Well I went here with my x for valentines day and what a mistake that was. First we waited almost a hr and a half then when we got seated it took for ever to get service..  put it this way, we were seated there was a couple next to us getting ready to leave. They left, their table got cleaned and four new customers sat there and received their drinks and desert before we even got a hi hello I'm your waiter...then we order, the manager comes out to tell me oh I'm sorry it's gonna take a while longer to get you food out we ran out of mashed potatoes..meanwhile the guests next to me that came after were halfway through there on tray by now.  my food finally shows up, only to dig into my mashed potatoes to find a half of a potato uncooked and not mashed, and my carrots hard and my x's veggies over cooked..so I nicely asked for a new plate only to have my waiter spill food on me....and what I get from all this a freaking 12 dollar gift card lmao take that shit and shove it all I gotta say you guys suck"
John D.,"Anaheim, CA",12,43,69,3.0,10/9/2012,There's no doubt that it's a safe choice.  It's a chain and the food is reliable and pretty delicious.  It would be 5 star if the place wasn't so freaking busy!
Tammy P.,"San Diego, CA",8,21,10,3.0,11/2/2010,"We always go to this place, when it is not a time to eat for everyone else! I know that it is always busy, and they don't take reservation (yea, they are that good, huh?). We arrived around 5.30, so we were seated right away.  The service was great. Everyone is very helpful. The house breads are awesome. We ordered Chicken Salad and Alfredo Pasta. Their prices go with the portion. It is a hugh portion that leaves us another meal for the next day. The pasta has too much garlic. The salad was okay. Nothing very spectacular.  I love their key lime cheesecake. It's good, but not the greatest. I may go back whenever we have a crave for a quick cheescake or we just get hungry while shopping there."
Dayvia N.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",205,26,,4.0,12/14/2012,"Love the Cheesecake Factory. This was the first time at this location. The wait on a weekend was over a hour long and it was crazy busy. We were seated outside and it was perfect. The heaters were a help and not to hot or too cold. I ordered the belagio chicken which was amazing! The server was very attentive. We had the peanut butter cheesecake, also great! My only disappointment was when I paid partcially with a gift card and the waiter came back and announced the entire check total to the table. It was very unprofessional. I understand that he wanted me to tip him on the total amount and not what was charged to my card but the total bill should never be announced. PS I wrote this review originally in Feb but just got realized it was just a draft."
Cookie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,157,5,4.0,8/24/2012,"I typically don't like chains but you have to acknowledge when they do it right.  This place is consistent - no matter which restaurant you go to in the country, every dish is always prepared exactly the same, is excellent quality, the service is prompt and friendly (although some locations do get very busy but we go later at night so it isn't a problem) and their portion sizes are the same (usually very large for most dishes).  Their menu is HUGE.  My boyfriend ALWAYS gets the Chicken Maderia which the chicken breast cooked to perfection, the rich sauce with the mushrooms and cheese is perfection and the asparagus are slightly crunchy with nice mashed potatoes with the skins.  I can see why he has difficulty trying anything different.   Me on the other hand?  I love to experiment and, so far, love everything I have gotten here.  This time I got two items off of their SkinnyLicious Menu.  The ahi tuna tartar was amazing.  $7???  Seriously?  I have paid twice that for something half as good!  It was a divine serving (about 1 cup size) in the middle of 4 asian crackers.  It consisted of exquisitely tender small pieces of raw tuna mixed with avocado and a soy-ginger sesame sauce.  OMG, that dish could make me never want to try anything else again (and in fact, I have gotten this the last 2 times!).  I also got the Lettuce Wraps Asian Style.  These are very different than what you get at other location.  They come out in the metal holders standing up like they are tacos.  They are FULL of a wonderful blend of fresh vegetables like carrots, cucumber, bean sprouts,  rice noodles a sprinkling of cilantro and drizzled with a spicy peanut sauce.  They were so fresh and flavorful, you didn't need either of the 2 sauces that cames with it (one was a chili sauce and I can't remember the other one).  This dish was also very tasty. I always swear next time, I will leave room for their cheesecake but am always so contentedly full that it doesn't happen..  One day, I will have to go just for dessert."
Gary W.,"San Diego, CA",105,22,4,2.0,5/20/2011,"I have decided to give this one a Two, only because i have eaten here before and had no problems...it should really be a one. I went today for lunch and had my usual cob salad and strawberry lemonade, about 3/4 through my salad i found a big long blonde hair...and as you can see i have no hair. So i waited about 5 mins to try and even find our server, she took it away and the manager came over, all sounds ok but then he procedes to ask me ""Is there anything he could do for me"" I replyed ""no its ok"" he then asked if he could get me another salad...i refused. All sounds ok but then when the check comes they have charged me for the salad and we had got a dessert and nothing was comped or taken off. I was so shocked i like a fool payed it. Is this the standard practice nowadays? I work in the industry and i know it is a given if something is wrong with the food the customer is not charged...is this there way of getting around it by him asking me... ""is there anything i can do for you"" Next time i will say ""YES DONT CHARGE ME FOR MY SALAD WHEN THERE WAS A HAIR IN IT & I WOULD LIKE A DESSERT ON THE HOPUSE PLEASE..."" Actually i am so furious i probably wont go back to that location. Although the more i think about it i am just as bad i paid the bill... stupid me... Very dissapointing Come guys sort it out.."
Melissa H.,"Renton, WA",59,72,30,2.0,1/4/2010,"The parking, or lack thereof, put a bad taste in my mouth to begin with. We finally found a parking space so small that everyone had to get out before we pulled in just to get in - about 1/2 hour after we arrived. Luckily we got there when we did because when we left there was a line out the door. I can only imagine the nightmare for those people who not only had to find a parking spot but then had to wait for an hour to be seated. (Which I refuse to do anywhere.) We walked in to the cavernous, beautiful restaurant. This place has really high ceilings, wrought iron, marble and brass fixtures giving  the impression that we're in for a classier dining experience. However once sat down, it's really run like all the other corporate chains out there with that machine-like churning out customers as quickly and with as little service as possible. We went with my parents, visiting from NYC for Christmas, to celebrate my mother's birthday. We chose it because, during Christmas week, it was the only place we could find a birthday cake for her.  I had Steak Diane, ordered medium. It came out brown on the outside and raw inside. I sent it back requesting a whole new plate as i hate reheated beef. The waiter looked at me like I was from another planet. My father cut into his pork chops, they were also raw. Raw pork can make a person very, very ill. We sent that back. My father was so turned off by the sight that he went without dinner.  The waiter was very unapologetic, which prompted me to call over the manager. I mean, 2 out of 4 dishes were raw and my father's drink had hardly any alcohol in it as well. The manager was pretty much equally as unapologetic. He offered to replace the meals but that was it. I would expect some kind of comp on the bill, especially since they knew it was a birthday celebration. No such luck.  A restaurant that tries to pull itself off as a upscale bistro type place needs to treat its customers as if its a bistro type place. It was not intimate, friendly nor was the food out of the kitchen good (even once it was cooked), or even edible . And the place is LOUD. VERY LOUD. I give this joint one star for decor. It gets one more star for the incredible Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. It must have weighed 50 lbs and we paid 50 bucks for it. As far as I'm concerned, The Cheesecake factory has no restaurant. It's a bakery worthy only of my visit for coffee and desert. My theory that restaurants with menu's as huge and varied as this place's are not capable of turning out high quality. My theory still stands."
