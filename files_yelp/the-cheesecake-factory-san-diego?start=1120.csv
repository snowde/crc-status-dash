Daniel A.,"San Diego, CA",31,15,,1.0,8/14/2015,"I've been eating at the Fashion Valley Cheesecake Factory for years. The food, service, and selection have always been first class. Not anymore. My last three visits were memorable experiences because the food was awful, the service horrible, and overall, I walked out the door feeling totally unsatisfied. And just for the record, the various people who joined me for lunch or dinner agreed with my assessment; each had encountered substandard service and unsavory food. Considering how pricey their menu is, the food and service should be superb. I won't bore you with the nitty-gritty details, but I had ordered the chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and bacon. First of all, I don't know how they have the nerve to call this a chicken sandwich when 90% of the sandwich consists of bread, lettuce and tomatoes. The microscopic chicken on this sandwich was about a half inch thick, so overcooked that it was as tough as biting into a dog's rawhide chew, and it had no flavor whatsoever. After two bites, I called the waitress over, told her why I was very unhappy with my sandwich, so she took it away, asked me if I wanted something else, and surprisingly, deducted it from the bill. I spoke to the manager afterwards in a very polite and calm manner and explained my experience. He, of course, couldn't apologize enough. However, he tried to justify the situation because he had only been manager at that location for a few weeks and ""There were many issues he needed to address."" Well, that may be the case. But job one is quality control. If the food isn't good, nothing else matters. I wish the manager would have given me a reason to come back. But he didn't. Needless to say, I'm scratching their name off my restaurant list."
Hunter L.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,46,,3.0,5/28/2009,"Man oh man.  Where to begin? This is the sort of place you would hate for foreigners to visit.  It sort of sums up the gluttonous nature of our great country.  Everything at the Cheesecake Factory is BIG.  Big menu, big venue, big customers, and big portions.  Nothing here stands out at all; it isn't bad, it isn't good, but there's a lot of it.  Most chain restaurants post nutritional information for their menu items on their website.  Thankfully, Cheesecake Factory does not.   I used to live across the street from one in LA and out of laziness I kept waddling over and getting food to go.  Every time I went there I would order something different, come home, plop in front of the TV, and stuff my piggy little pie hole.  After finishing I would swear off the place and vow never to eat there again.  That promise to myself would usually last a week.  What's the definition of insanity?  Doing the same thing over and over expecting different results, right?   Shoot, writing this has given me a hankering for some tex-mex eggrolls and some chicken and biscuits... I so, so, so hope Purgatory is like the Cheesecake Factory."
Glenn E.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/5/2013,Love this restraunt.... Always good food with great services!
Kristina M.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,4,2.0,3/4/2013,"I came here a couple weeks ago with some girl friends on a wednesday night later in the evening..    Our service was extremely SLOW. I understand they were busy at the time, but it was so slow I could have walked out without paying my check and no one would have probably noticed.   There was three of us and our food came out one at a time over a period of 15 minutes. our drinks were not kept full... Our server was nice, notoverly friendly but thats fine.     I am a server so I am pretty picky but im also pretty understanding, but the end of the night I was FED UP. After a very long wait of holding us hostage with the bill the manager came over to apologize we expressed we were in a hurry for a movie and they still took their time.. The did offer desert to make up for it, but we truly had to go and declined.   As it is a chain, Im sure I will go back, espeviaally for desert, but I have had a slow experiance before as well, so I will make sure not to go when i have ANY sort of time restraints at all.."
Heather G.,"San Diego, CA",10,22,,1.0,1/26/2014,"First let me preface with, I'm a Cheesecake Factory supporter. While they do not represent culinary revolution,  it is usually consistent and good... oh but not today, this one is not good. Chicken was so sadly overlooked it was an affront to poultry and chopped salad was brownish and over dressed in a bad balsamic concoction.... How do you mess up salad? We thought they might just have a pinch hitting, bench warmer, chef filling in on an off night, but it might be more about quality control and branch management because despite needing to send back two of the four dishes they didnt comp anything and then the bathroom was so dirty it looked like a gas station. We try to be sports and not send things back but had to send two things back, yikes. The waiter and manager were decent about it but not the kind of ok you would want after having to send back most of what you ordered.  On the positive side, the Margarita and fried macaroni appetizer were the normal good you expect from this solid chain. This wouldnt make me never go back to a Cheesecake factory just last time at this location."
Zach G.,"Hemet, CA",47,16,4,2.0,8/19/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, generally. This experience left a lot to be desired. They were fairly busy, for a Tuesday evening, but, we were seated quickly. Our server, Angela, greeted us, and took our order, then we sat there, for more than half an hour waiting for our food without a word from our server. All the tables around us got their food relatively quickly. By the time we got our food we were really to leave. My wife's steak was under cooked, and my daughter's pizza was thin, and cardboard like. My salad was good, but the chicken lacked any seasoning. All in all, it'll be the last time I go to a Cheesecake Factory for anything but cheesecake."
Yesenia P.,"El Cajon, CA",73,7,,2.0,8/2/2014,"The only thing good about my entire meal was the sangria.  Very disappointed.  I mean how difficult could it be to make a simple fettuccine Alfred!? I'm Vegetarian and I am pretty easily pleased with a simple plate of pasta. That being said, when your meal comes out and you find pieces of left behind chicken and a random piece of shrimp I tend to not be so excited about the meal. I was just disappointed in the lack of attentiveness."
Priscilla R.,"Oceanside, CA",43,166,37,5.0,6/14/2012,The best lemon chicken I've ever tasted! No matter what flavor cheesecake you cannot go wrong
Alex S.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/29/2013,"Really Nice place, super clean and nice on the inside. Loved their food and their service, definitely coming back here again no doubt about that. Plus their bar was not that bad also a definite plus."
Foster B.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2/6/2013,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge CF fan. Their restaurants typically have wonderful food and ambiance for group gatherings. Which is why I wanted to bring a group to the one in San Diego. We were attending a conference nearby and I was hosting a late night gathering. I called 1.5 months ahead to find out how to reserve a room since they state, ""We can serve groups up to 40.""  They asked me to call back 2 weeks before the event since ""We don't take reservations."" Reasonable request. I did so and that time they asked me to call back a few days before the event because, ""We don't take reservations."" Again - reasonable request. I did so ... again.... and they said that bringing a group of 15-20 at around 9:30 pm wouldn't be a problem and ""We don't take reservations.""  When we arrived at 9:30, we encountered a mildly irritated staff. When I tried to explain that I called ahead to alert them so make sure they wouldn't be put out by a large late-night group, I heard one more time... ""We don't take reservations."" (They must cover that point thoroughly in the Cheesecake Training School.) The food was mediocre and the service was okay. What was suppose to be a celebratory gathering was dampened by the sense we were unwelcome business. All this to say, if you're planning a large group gathering at this Cheesecake Factory, do so with... reservations."
Mitchell N.,"San Diego, CA",5,111,18,5.0,5/30/2012,Ribeye with grilled onions and horsey.  Steamed broccoli with mayo.....  Can't beat it... The  food always tastes better with excellent service (thanks Danielle) and yes we will try the mango smoothie next time.
Liz F.,"San Diego, CA",4,40,3,5.0,7/22/2010,"How can you not love this place?  The food is consistently good and the menu is so large and diverse that even the pickiest eater is sure to find something they like.  PLUS, the cheesecake, yum...the cheesecake! Yes, parking at this location sucks and the wait can be ridiculously long, but that just goes to show how solid of a restaurant it is....or that it's located next to a popular mall!"
Paul G.,"San Diego, CA",16,35,8,5.0,6/28/2013,"Why would anybody go to the Cheesecake factory for a burger?  Because they have great burgers, that's why.  The Mac-N-Cheeseburger is the bomb.  If you like just cheese and meat, they take one of their Fried Mac-N-Cheese Balls and slam it top of the burger and cover it with even more melted cheese sauce, d'lish.  And any place that cooks a burger to temp is okay in my book.  Be prepared on the menu because it is BIG, pages, it even has advertising in it so it feels like a fashion magazine.  Most places would never survive a big menu but this place has it all, something for everybody.  I would suggest checking the online menu before you go in there and figure out what you want because it's a read.  The Avocado Rolls are incredible, highly recommend and don't leave there without a slice of Oreo Cheesecake, they'll be happy to send you home with one, they also give you a nice dollop of whipped cream too."
Lucy B.,"San Diego, CA",339,137,684,4.0,4/19/2010,One of my fave restaurants. I love that there is now a small plate menu.. My faves are the crab bites and bacon wrapped dates. I love the crispy calamari w/ the garlicky aioli. The mac& cheese balls are a genius idea dipped in ranch. The ranch isn't that good though which is a bummer!  My favorite entree is the chicken picatta & carbonara dish. Fave dessert: banana cheesecake & red velvet cheesecake.  The service is great but the only downfall is the wait time. Don't bother going here hungry 4-6pm Mon-Fri.
H S.,"San Diego, CA",2,18,,4.0,8/10/2012,"We went here for dinner and the food was pretty good. There are very few veg options, so if you are a veg like us, then better to see the Menu online before going. We got free house bread. The white bread was OK but the brown bread was awesome. I even asked for a second helping. We skipped the Appetizers and ordered the roasted veg pizza (the only veg option). The size was medium and was more than enough for 2. Good that we ordered only one entree and shared it else it would have been very filling. For dessert we had the Hersheys Cheese Cake which was awesome!  The price was not too high compared to the big portions they give. The waitress at our table was very good and smiling the full time and was very friendly! The service was very good. The only thing was we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got a table. but it was worth the wait."
Wilmar D.,"San Diego, CA",462,333,175,3.0,3/25/2009,"I had no complaints with how the food tasted.  I got the shrimp with angel hair and it was spot on.  Nice and tomatoey, shrimp cooked perfectly and full of flavor, and a decent sized portion.  Their bread they start you off with is also always good. The Long Island iced teas that I got came in a pretty big glass and was refreshing and not too alcohol-ey.  And the cheesecake?  Well, it's Cheesecake Factory.  Their cheesecake, at LEAST, has to be decent. I did not appreciate the prices though.  I dished out over fifty bucks.  $9.50 for a drink? Do you know how many McChicken Sandwiches that can buy you??"
M P.,"San Diego, CA",26,87,10,2.0,9/17/2012,"Okay Cheesecake factory, I gave you two chances and you blew it, both times. Two visits. Two bouts of some sort of 'food illness'. No more ahi tuna for me. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
lelyfay b.,"San Diego, CA",50,21,12,4.0,5/30/2010,"Always a fave but they definitely need to expand their venue. We were there last Thursday to celebrate a friends bday and waited for over an hour! There was 6 people in our group and we kept getting bypassed to seat the smaller parties. We were starving by the time we got seated! Our appetizers came out pretty fast but the wait in between before the main course was served took forever! We barely got to enjoy our dinner as our stomach has settled. Although the food is wonderful taste-wise, the customer service should be worked on. Also, expand the dang restaurant out to the lawn area to cut the wait time."
Right A.,"Del Mar, CA",0,65,,1.0,1/1/2013,"I am a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, except for tonight.   Our waitress was unfriendly and not very personable, barely uttered any word, barely checked on us.  We got seated, took her awhile to say HI to us, drinks took forever.  The bread came but we were not given plates.  Took her awhile to get out order.  I can understand this restaurant is always busy but we have never had this kind of service, ever.   2 out 3 of our orders came out, about 5 mins later she tells us they are out of the 3rd order.  Really???!!!  Why wait that long to tell us they are out of something.  So now our 3rd person has to wait for the new order.  During the entire meal, she never came back to check on us.   Time to order dessert, we figured it was best to take it to go!  She comes back with it, in a small bag, never mind we have other  to go boxes to carry out.  And I had asked for extra sauce, it never came, she never came back, we got tired of waiting for her to come back.   Safe to say I won't be coming back to this CF for awhile or any CF for that matter.  Plenty of other restaurants around."
Jenni N.,"San Diego, CA",2,4,,3.0,5/8/2014,"The food at this location is a hit or miss. Sometimes, the food is good. Other times, the food is ok. The last two times I been here the food has just been ok. What bugs me is this location is ALWAYS CROWDED. You usually have to wait at least 15 mins before you get seated. The food at the Eastlake location is better. THE CHEESECAKE IS ALWAYS DELICIOUS, THOUGH."
