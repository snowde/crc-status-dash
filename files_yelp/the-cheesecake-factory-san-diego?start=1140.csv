Rory L.,"Bloomington, IN",37,140,6,3.0,7/15/2011,"This place is crazy crowded and the wait is usually ~1  hour and there are only like 2 benches, so you end up standing arbitrarily on the street corner forever since the pager doesn't let you go further than 20 feet outside the restaurant. I sat outside on the patio, so I didn't get to experience the dim ""mood-lighting"" inside.  I had the white pizza with a whole host of cheeses I can't remember, spinach and garlic. It was very tasty and so big that I took home more than half as leftovers (which they package for you and put in a fancy plastic bag, by the way...). My friend had the Shepard's pie, which she says is one of the better ones she's had and tastes more legit than most Irish pubs. Cheesecake and I aren't friends...in terms of digestion. TMI?...so it's expected that I didn't try one of their 50 million different varieties of cheesecake. My friend and I split the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae, which was very decadent and something one shouldn't accomplish alone, unless you a super ambitious--we're talking a boat of ice cream, brownie, and whipped cream.  The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. No complaints there. BUT all the hostesses I've ever met when I've gone there are super biotch-y.  Can I say that on here? They've all been very snarky....NOT APPRECIATED!  Didn't explore the bathroom, but I heard it was average."
Mark H.,"San Diego, CA",77,193,70,3.0,4/18/2010,"These guys make some of the best lettuce Thai wraps.  The pasta dishes, though, have been hit and miss during the past couple of years. In particular, the chicken fettuccine has been great to bad. One time it's too salty; other times there is little salt. Or, the sauce is extremely thin or the sauce is thicker than syrup. It's got to the point that I stay away from this location months at a time.  The service is also consistently inconsistent. Wish people actually enjoyed their jobs. Some do; some don't. As a result, service is spotty.  I also wish that Cheesecake Factory would let you call ahead and get on the list. Unfortunately, it does not, which means that you're rolling the dice if you try to catch dinner around 6-6:30pm on a Friday or Saturday night. You never know if you're going to catch a 20-minute wait or a one-hour+ wait."
Paula D.,"Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego, CA",258,421,58,5.0,4/26/2009,"Today was my daughters 13th birthday and we had lunch at the Cheesecake factory.  The service was amazing, truly outstanding in every way.   The food was excellent.  My husband had the salmon and it was wonderful, the bacon salad was fabulous.   We sat at a separate table from the birthday table and all the girls had a great time and said the food was awesome! Great food, great service....can't get any better :)"
Edelisa C.,"San Diego, CA",553,210,417,3.0,2/22/2009,"I've been to this place a few times over the years. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for the dining experience!  First of all, use some common sense. Don't go on the weekends if you can manage that. Its located at the MALL for crying out loud! To get the best out of your dining experience, go EARLY! Go on a weekday during lunch to ease up on the wait times or early weeknight before 5pm if you can.  The food here is decent. I've always had great service here. My fave dish here is the Chicken Madeira. YUM! I highly recommend this dish. Of course, the cheesecakes."
Alexandria N.,"San Diego, CA",6,253,86,3.0,4/25/2012,They need to take reservations. I understand why they don't want too but seriously.. the wait gets to be too long. my friend and i even left and took our business to PF changs which is across the street. The food at the cheesecake factory is 'ok'... the drinks are better and so is the dessert. Somewhat pricey for such an item... Happy hour is decent... If i'm starving I wouldn't go here but if someone is taking me out.. then yes I'll go.
Brenda e.,"San Diego, CA",4,14,,5.0,11/23/2011,I've had the pleasure of dining here on multiple occassions and hve always felt they were underrated. Across the way is a PF Chang's that in no way can compare to the cheesecake factory. The dessert menu is so extensive you will most likely be in shock and awe. Staff is always friendly and expect a 15 minute wait if your eating at peak times.
Tanya P.,"San Diego, CA",119,148,11,4.0,6/23/2012,Went there for a graduation dinner and a wonderful option for vegetarians. Pleasant and the only thing is that it is very popular so no reservations by the phone.
V M.,"San Diego, CA",3,45,2,1.0,6/20/2014,I will make sure this goes to David Overton.This is the only Cheesecake Factory that has smaller portions... Honestly you have changed for the worst. It used to be a pleasant experience and now it's all about eating your way smaller portions (because of a raid they had a couple of years ago with illegal immigrants chefs being kicked out by the Feds) and horrible service . I choose the one in downtown because it's way better and the portions are way bigger and guess what??? The price is the same. I am filing a BBB complaint because that is just not fair business practice.
Sarah V.,"San Diego, CA",182,145,24,4.0,10/18/2009,"I ordered the Chicken Madeira (Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes) and a Typhoon Punch (Stoli Raspberry Vodka with Passion Fruit, Pineapple and Orange Juices) is DELICIOUS. It didn't taste like it had much alcohol it in at all but after two of them I was pretty buzzed. Top it off with some strawberry cheesecake and I'm in food heaven. Regarding their other foods.... a lot of forgettable blah stuff. I'm talking mainly about their pastas. The atmosphere is nice. There's always a wait though so get someone to show up early. ^_^ Some of the other reviews complain about the service here but I've had nothing but good-great service here. The waiter we had when our group of about 20 people was awesome. We didn't have any food mix ups and he kept the drinks coming. I don't think anyone ever had to sit there for very long with an empty drink. So to sum it up... Food: 3.5-4 Stars Cheesecake: 5 Stars Service: 4 Stars"
Contessa S.,"San Diego, CA",348,110,54,5.0,4/19/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the only chain restaurants that I'll happily promote. First of all, who doesn't love that soft, warm brown bread...pumpernickel, is it? Last time we asked if we could purchase a loaf before we left and instead our fabulous waiter brought us two complementary loaves. Now that is how you get extra tips!  Yes, the portion sizes are a food coma waiting to happen. Yes, you'll probably have a long wait if you go on the weekend. But it's so worth it! The Luau Salad is the best salad I've ordered anywhere. It's perfect. Trust me, if you like salads with a hint of sweetness (it has savory pieces of mango and a lightly sweetened vinaigrette dressing), you will not be disappointed. I also recommend the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Chicken Madeira and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (it's bangin'!). I've been switching between these dishes for several years and my love for them has only grown deeper. I have ventured out to try some other dishes, such as the Pasta Da Vinci, Cashew Chicken and Grilled Chicken/Avocado Club, which have all been good, but I always find myself going back to the ones I love.  My favorite cheesecake is the pumpkin, but it's only offered in the fall/winter so that's usually the time of year when I'm frequenting Cheesecake Factory. The Godiva brownie sundae is good, but it's extremely rich (and huge) so only get it if you're sharing with a few people. I'm also a fan of the peach bellinis.  Random thought - has anyone else noticed they have extremely slippery floors??"
Jenna T.,"San Diego, CA",9,31,,5.0,6/2/2011,"Just about every time I drive by here to go to the mall, you'll find folks waiting outside to be seated and you may be questioning if it's worth the wait and YES it is! Their menu is awesome, endless and diverse! Just give it a attempt, they have some dishes on here you often don't find anywhere and I've tried various of them and they had been all wonderful! Massive portions, so plan on taking some leftovers property, particularly if you want to leave some room for one of their delicious cheesecakes. A have to! They began labeling the calories, don't look at that, just order what sounds the most scrumptious and get pleasure from it!"
Julia C.,"San Diego, CA",277,131,46,1.0,2/2/2009,i've been to cheesecake factory at least 5 times already and not by choice... i personally really dislike their food. It sits in your stomach like a huge boulder.... the food is not tasty AT ALL... i've never enjoyed my entrees... not even ONCE.  this place is WAAAAAAAAY overrated! i don't get it.
Sean D.,"San Diego, CA",6,16,2,3.0,8/27/2009,"I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory twice in my life. I lived in San Diego for 8 years before going my first time because it was always so damn busy. After I got old enough and waiting around wasn't a big pain like it was when I was 9, I went, and was really underwhelmed with the experience. Part of the big draw of this place beyond the cheesecake is the enormity of its menu, and it's true, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the kinds of food they had despite their narrow title matter. I can't remember what I got the first time, but the second time I went I got shrimp with angel hair and it was really nothing to get excited about. I asked my family if their food also seemed lacking and we all seemed to agree that it wasn't up to standard. It kind of put into question to me whether a diverse menu was really worth ooh-ing and ahh-ing about if all of it is really pretty mediocre. Of course, it's the cheesecake that's the title player in it all, and damn, the selection of it put my tendency to be indecisive in the spotlight. I got the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake and it was pretty freakin' delicious, and taking a forkful of it followed by a forkful of my sister's Kahlua Cake (any chocolatey cake will do) made it even better. Expensive as hell? You bet. But cheesecake in general is expensive, so I suppose if you're selling any expensive good, especially if it's one that you're famous for, you have the right pillage the pockets of your patrons. In a nutshell, the meals are pretty mediocre but the cheesecake is top notch. It's too bad they're always so freakin' busy all the time."
M K.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,3.0,10/30/2013,The restaurant is beautiful and the menu is never ending. I agree though in the food quality is sometimes hit and miss. The desserts though are always sensational and over the top!
Selina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",237,404,64,3.0,3/4/2009,"I go to Cheesecake Factory because it's a little high school nostalgia.  I typically order the jambalaya pasta which is good 75% of the time.  Portions are huge so there is always leftover.  The wait is always ridiculous, no matter which location.  I guess they just pick really good locales?   The ads in the menu are always a little weird and annoying.   If I come here for dinner, I almost never make it to the dessert because I'm so stuffed.  Get it to go.  NY cheesecake with strawberries.  Way too much whipped cream tho."
John M.,"Temecula, CA",293,451,234,3.0,3/6/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  I'm looking for Penny to serve me (inside joke, think Big Bang Theory)  My only gripe is that there is no happy hour at this location.  That's a bummer..."
Ashley H.,"La Mesa, CA",7,12,,3.0,6/24/2012,"I ordered a cheesecake for my grad party pre paid but lost my receipt. My mother called the cheesecake factory the day I picked it up and made sure it was ready. I got to the cheesecake factory they lost the cheesecake, I waited there for ten minuets talked to three people two of which were managers. Finally someone came back from their break apologized and gave it to me the managers didn't apologize at all. The cheesecake was delicious, but 1000 calories a piece and made me feel gross after."
Adriana M.,"San Diego, CA",114,172,23,4.0,1/22/2014,"This is a chain restaurant so I really don't see the need to review the food, let alone the delicious cheesecakes so I will just comment on the service.  The bartenders are always hustling & very busy but are also very attentive.  Parking usually sucks because it's at Fashion Valley Mall.  I don't like that there is ALWAYS a wait but at least the staff is friendly."
Melissa R.,"San Diego, CA",172,240,465,4.0,1/8/2012,The Skinnylicious Herb Crusted Salmon Salad is the best thing on the menu and it is super healthy! I love it! :) This is my go to meal when I'm at the mall or don't feel like cooking! :)
Klouise M.,"Tempe, AZ",2,11,,5.0,9/28/2012,Great customer service. It was my birthday so my boyfriend took me here on a friday night. It was awesome. It was packed with people. It was that great.
