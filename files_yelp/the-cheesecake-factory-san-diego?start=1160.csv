Alysaun K.,"San Diego, CA",60,113,12,3.0,1/19/2009,"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But when I came here Saturday night, a few things bugged me. -THe 40-minute wait.  -The cushions on the seats aren't cushion-y AT ALL. I felt like I was sitting on a piece of plywood. -The really long wait just to get your water because the place is so damn crowded. But, the waitress was very nice. They give you a basket of bread and butter...the bread was steaming hot, which was nice. We ordered the Southwestern eggrolls for an app, which are my favorite. They didn't disappoint. I went on a limb and ordered the ribs, my man ordered the fish tacos. His fish taco plate was HUGE. My ribs were probably the best I've had. They were really really tender. And I subbed fries and got mashed potatoes, which really can't be beat. They are super duper good. The strawberry lemonade has fresh strawberries and is delicious. I got the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake, which tasted just like those coconut Girl Scout cookies...mmmmmmmmm! The food is good, the waiting and crowds, not so good. Take it how you will."
J T.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,,4.0,5/20/2014,"Who doesn't love cheesecake, right? I haven't disliked one before. I really enjoy their pastas too - that is the only other thing I have had from there. Their fettuccine noodles are really thick and yummy! Service is really friendly and nice too, and even on weekend nights the wait for a table with just a few people is never too bad!"
angel P.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,3,1.0,9/25/2010,"If you want to get screwed then this is the place for you. Not only did i get a screw in my meal, but they didn't do much to make me feel better about eating there. We got our bill with only the metal filled food taken off then a friend mentioned we didn't think that was enough for ruining our meal. so after having to complain to get the bill back. they had only taken off two deserts.  I would have had a better time at California Pizza Kitchen.  I know when something happens wrong their they wont let you leave till you are happy to go back and tell friends that they are a great place.  I will NEVER eat at Cheesecake Factory again. O recommend that you not eat there... You might get screwed... or a screw in your food."
Scarlata D.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,,5.0,7/24/2012,I love this place ! 5 star everything.Chicken Madeira is  simply awesome !
Natalia B.,"San Diego, CA",180,29,3,5.0,2/21/2013,"Rain or shine, I come here once a month for a dinner. What can I say? That was my first restaurant in US, first dinner out. I do not quite come here for the food, but for that atmosphere and wonderful music you get here. I've been to some fine dining restaurants that do not need to be yelped, cause everything is perfect about them, and as a result, you get $300 total bill for 2 people, but I keep coming back here - can not beat the first impression, I guess... I've never been waiting for a table for more than 15 minutes, and spent the waiting time by the cheesecake display trying to decide what the dessert would be this time. I can kill for good chocolate, and, therefore, always end up with the Godiva or Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. As for the food, it is also good. Steak Diane, Pasta Da Vinci, Ahi Tuna are the ones I get. Oh, yes, and the fired calamari if you are just having drinks here. The plates are huge, the service is outstanding (only one time in 5 years I had to ask for a manager), chocolate cheesecakes are...there is no word to describe this piece of heaven... 1600 calories in one piece! Anyway, that is the spot for whatever needs - business lunch, night cup of coffee, dinner with your friends/family. Can not go wrong with Cheesecake Factory."
Shirley G.,"San Diego, CA",224,706,1124,5.0,5/2/2009,"This place never fails me, always good food and good atmosphere. The last time I came here was with an old friend.. and I ordered the shepard's pie for the lunch portion. IT WAS GOOD! and it was my first time trying it.... oh my. Almost finished it too! and it was big! Boy was I satisfied. But, this place is great for the portion sizes when you share and the cheesecake of course... who can forget!! Although, on the weekends there are most definitely a line.... but if you want it and you can wait than go ahead!"
Eric S.,"San Diego, CA",2,1,1,2.0,7/4/2010,"First, I had the Kobe Burger, which was good with the grilled onions and mushrooms but seemed a little small for its price. I had french fries with the meal which were about average, and the beverage of choice was root beer which was way to flat but that may have been because there was way to much ice added. The cheesecake, for which the factory is named after, seemed a little overrated. I have had better Cheesecake from other restaurant in the San Diego area. But my wife did love the Red Velvet Cheesecake! As for the service, the waiter that helped us was very knowledgeable about the specials and attended to us very well, service didn't go out the door until our original waiter went on break and the new waitress came on in relief. She forgot to bring me a refill on my root beer, When I asked for water she brought it in a dirty glass and she seemed to be rushing us out the door. We just received our desserts and she was asking me if I needed change for my receipt at the same time.  It seemed as if she was thinking, this is not my tip so I am not going all out! Hopefully she doesn't get any part of the tip I left for the first waiter."
Paul L.,"Brooklyn, NY",113,48,,4.0,10/28/2008,"A few weeks ago a good friend of mine invited me to join her for dinner at the Cheesecake factory. I have to admit I was bit judgemental and apprehensive in her restaurant selection. Its not that I don't like the restaurant per say but its the things that I normally associate with this restaurant.      -For one, the wait on weekend evenings is similar to a wait to go on Space Mountain on a Saturday. At least an hour and a half minimum.    -Secondly, I usually come here with my mom and dad(its my mom's favorite restaurant) where they are in the habit of giving me the, ""you should be doing this financially"" lecture.     -Thirdly, the place is always the recipients of douchbaggery, big parties of 17 year-old rich snobby girls spending their daddies cash, and fanny pack wearing tourists.      -Lastly, the servers in this place remind me of Willy Wonka's umpa lumpas. These people all look the same in those funky white outfits and there are tons of them everywhere. Its like they have one server per table. Its amusing to see them all constantly bumping into eachother all night.    But I did give in to my self-indulgence and gave the Cheesecake factory a shot. Of course when we got in the restaurant there was absolutely no room in the lobby so we decided to sneak in the bar and steal two seats. It was perfect because the Dodger/Cub elimination game was on the tv and our bartender happened to be from Chicago.           The bartender's service was quick, friendly and attentive. This impressed me because his team was about to get swept by the Dodgers. The cheesecake menu selection is a bit overwhelming because there is so many choices. I got the 4 cheese pasta dish which had mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, fonrtina, on a bed of rigotoni pasta. The sauce was a light marinara /basil sauce. After my dish, me and my friend shared this huge strawberry shortcake that was well worth the splurged stomach after.   Sitting at the bar was overall nice because we got to drink and eat without being distracted by 60 umpa lumpa servers running around and fat tourists with their fanny packs. The food and service was great but one star gets knocked off because of the high food prices. If I was a rich douche, I'd probably be here more often."
Abaigeal P.,"Millington, TN",1,13,,1.0,8/25/2012,"Normally, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to 5 or 6 around the country and this one is by far the worst. Today is my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to stay home but have a restaurant meal. I ordered it to go; it took me 20 minutes to get there and I waited an extra 25 to get my food (as did the other two cars next to me). My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which are supposed to come with succotash and mashed potatoes. They didn't give us the mashed potatoes. I ordered the Orange Chicken, and I would have rather had Panda Express. The only chrunch that should come from eating fried chicken should be bread crumbs, not chicken parts.  The last time we ordered curbside to go, my boyfriend waited 35 minutes for the food. After two bad experiences, I won't be back. I'd rather drive up north for the Cheesecake Factory if I really want it in the future."
Laurel T.,"San Diego, CA",519,307,16,2.0,12/19/2008,"I do not know what the hype is about this place. Is it because their menu is so huge it takes a year to read? Or is it because you feel like you are in some Las Vegas type restaurant while you are dining?  Now perhaps the first problem was that my amiga  chose this place as her birthday dinner destination during one of San Diego's very few rainy weeks. I live off Texas street and it literally took me 45 minutes to navigate through the blocked off flooded roads and into the mall parking structure.  Also, who dines in a mall restaurant this close to Christmas time? I for one make all attempts to completely avoid the mall at this time of year.  So there I was, starving, soaking and in need of a frosty bevie. I greeted my gaggle and we cruised over to the bar to partake in some pre-dinner libations. Birthday girl had been given one of those pager things and we were told our wait would be between 15 and 40 minutes. Now that is a huge window of time but a drink in my hands and all kinds of mindless high school gossip to catch up on and I am good to go.  Three Stella Artois and 55 minutes later, we were seated. We placed our drink orders and waited what seemed like forever to get more drinks. There were a few mix-ups, a Merlot was brought instead of a Cabernet, one of the mai tais seemed to be lacking booze etc. etc etc.  We were nearly fighting over the last pieces of yummy bread when our drink order waitress came over and introduced another waitress to us and informed that she would be taking over for the remainder of our dining experience. Okaayyyyyyyyy, whatever can we just ORDER ALREADY???  We ordered, birthday girl went for the avocado egg rolls which were fresh and delicious. I ordered calamari that was served without any lemon and took forever to get a wedge. My princess went for a chicken ceasar which was sub-par, his princess ordered a club sandwich that was soggy and falling apart. Other tablemates ordered the chicken potstickers which were good and served with a gingery sauce and someone ordered a bang bang chicken plate. It looked odd.  The food was not that good, The bill was fairly large and birthday girl didn't even get a complimentary slice of cheesecake, she got a small half champagne flute filled with some type of cream and chocolate disaster.  This whole dining experience was awful, it took forever, the food and service was not good! To top it all off, I woke up with a terrible stomach ache in the middle of the night."
Elif P.,"San Diego, CA",17,34,1,5.0,2/17/2009,"I went to the Cheesecake factory for the first time on Valentines Day. It was a  nice-looking place with modern decor. Their staff are very polite and nice. If you have any questions, they are knowledgeable about the menu.  I mainly ordered their appetizers because they were to die for and they filled you up very quickly. I had stuffed mushrooms and tex mex tacos. My friends ordered some pasta, which sat in your stomach very nicely. My friends also ordered cappucinos which were beautifully decorated and served to us. The Godiva Cheesecake was very rich.  I think the only complaint people would have about this place is that there is a long wait, but its only because a lot of people like or go to the Cheesecake Factory. Its a lovely place next to a great location - Fashion Valley mall."
Jacky W.,"San Diego, CA",4,1,,4.0,6/19/2012,"Had a dinner here with my girlfriend and her sister and, overall, it was satisfying. We went at early afternoon on a weekday and the indoor seatings were packed, whereas the patio seatings had several tables empty. We choose the patio and waited less than a minute before out server took us to our table. In about 15 minutes, drinks and bread rolls were served and the entree was served about 20 minutes after we ordered; the desert was served more quickly. Our server did a swell job and was very polite, though she came to our table one time too many. We ordered ""lunch portions"" pasta and they were slightly-large-one-person servings. We spent one-and-a-half hour total, but another half hour would be a good idea."
Cedric P.,"San Diego, CA",20,5,,4.0,4/28/2010,"Though the lunch menu is fairly small, awesome food at a great price.  Get the Renee's Special: soup, salad and sammich.  Woop.  Cheescake is very good too. Yay for their new red velvet. The best thing about lunch - especially on weekdays - is that there isn't a ridiculous wait."
Mac from Predator E.,"San Diego, CA",1,23,1,4.0,6/23/2009,"I gotta write a review even though no one will read it since there are already over 100 of them. I usually hate chain restaurants. They're too corporate for me and the food is most always lacking and overpriced. However, one of my exceptions is this place. The food is quite good. In fact, while some items taste better than others, I've never actually had a ""bad"" meal here. This sounds crazy, but they have the single best cheeseburger I've ever eaten. I'm serious! It blows anything else that I've had out of the water. It's the classic burger with cheese. The meat is flavorful and juicy and the patty is gigantic. It has a grilled onion, tomato lettuce and comes with a garlic mayo that is delicious. I don't know how they do it, but it's so worth it if you're a fan of a good burger. The service at this place is probably hit or miss, but I've never had any problems really.   One thing that sucks is sitting on the patio when the heat lamps are on. In between bites of food all you can taste is propain since the lamps are blasting at full power. But, depending on what kind of life you live, this could be a great thing since you can eat a meal and get high at the same time, free of charge. If you need a quick fix, just come here on a cold day and sit outside and breath and you'll be all set."
Monique C.,"San Diego, CA",64,28,43,1.0,1/2/2014,We got here to have a 30 mins wait to be heated outside. This location has a larger outside and these low grade heater lamps. We ordered drinks and appetizer together. The drink made to the table but not the appetizer. We are sitting there and the waiter delivery someone else food to us. He wasn't sure on the table number and it is far from the kitchen. While waiting still the waiter showed up and stated let me check on it. I request to have one of heat lamps next to our table. He said that he would check on getting it moved. The appetizer finally show and tell the waiter that the food should be place on hold. I don't want it all at once. What showed up - food. We at the little ass table with four plates. I'm like what stocked and freeze my butt off. It was 50 degrees and not lamp STILL. The waiter never returned but the manager did. He knew about the food and the lamp that he said was his fault. He was coming but had to stop at another table while I'm FREEZING! He gave us a slice of cheesecake! Wow I don't even want it and where is the heat lamp you ask...it never made it to the table!
Joelle R.,"San Diego, CA",362,317,63,3.0,11/2/2008,"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. The service and food was about a 3.5 - 4, but the place itself was more like a 3.  I won't go as far as to say ""I'm a fan"", but it was definitely ""A-OK"", so 3 stars it is! If you've ever eaten breakfast at a hotel in Vegas, that's what the ambiance at the Cheesecake Factory is like.  Immediately upon sitting down, I told my friend, ""This feels like a hotel restaurant... doesn't it?  Don't you feel like you're at the Doubletree or something?""  When I looked around at the high ceilings and decor of faux marble columns, Egyptian faces and cobras-as-candlesticks, I realized it was like brunch at the Luxor. Also, the advertisements in the 16 page menu were so cheesy, I might as well have been in Vegas.  Seriously? Right next to the omelettes was a big full-page ad for  .  Page before that? Some joint in the mall.  And so on and so on and so on.  Very tacky, in my opinion.   The staff was pretty attentive. Our server was friendly and brought everything we wanted in a timely manner. He even slung us some extra bacon because they accidentally brought us 2 sides instead of one.  Their coffee was good and the eggs benedict I ordered was perfectly cooked.  (After I chased down the waiter to tell him to ask the chef to make my yolks 'done'. A runny yolk wounds my soul.)  The hollandaise wasn't the best I've ever had in my whole life, but it was a good execution with a hint of dijon.  Good stuff!  My friend's California Omelette was delicious, too. The layers of garlic and shallot and the big firm steak-cut mushrooms they used were excellent. Would I eat here again? Sure, if someone was having a birthday or particularly wanted to go here. Like i said, the food was solid and the staff attentive. But with so many wonderful restaurants in this city, I don't know that I'd go out of my way to eat at a fairly homogenized chain like this.   Bottom line, the food is solid, but if I wanted to eat under a Sphinx face, I'd go to the Luxor."
A J.,"San Diego, CA",2,80,25,1.0,12/5/2010,"It's too bad that CF can't hire decent managers. Last year I bought $300 of their gift cards. I was a usual customer up until I was told by their corporate rep that I was not welcome to patronize... Within minutes of the restaurant opening and less that (10) tables of customers who were seated.  I arrived at the San Diego CF.  I asked for table XX in their rotunda front area. The hostess checked her computer seating chart and said yes  it was available.  I was escorted to that area and as I neared table XX I noticed two people were seated there. There was nothing on their table (no drinks, food, etc.) except the silverware which was already preset on every table in the restaurant. The hostess who was escorting me there saw the same thing and asked if I wanted to talk to the manager.  We walked all the way back to the lobby and again I asked the hostess if her computer showed that seat available when I arrived. She verified again and said yes.  The manager on duty, Gary, finally came and refused to re-seat the guests, who had changed tables WITHOUT asking or notifying the hostess. Instead Gary LIED about it saying that there were ""100 people waiting in line"" and said he 'told all 100 people to sit wherever they wanted' (and didn't bother to inform the hostess).  Do you believe a manager would say this to patrons at the CF? No way!  Gary was less than professional with me and my friend.  We were seated in an extremely busy area alongside the north windows.  While I was eating my friend was talking to me when these same customers who changed themselves to table XX stood next to our table and the man at the top of his voice yelled out loud, ""you can have the table now!""  Silence followed as diners within the restaurant looked over to our table to see what was going on.  During that time there was an employee standing right next to my friend at our table that heard and saw the whole thing.  I asked her to get the manager.  An assistant manager was sent to our table.  This was unacceptable of Gary to improperly handle the situation causing this to come this far.  We were lucky that a physical altercation didn't occur. Later, I received a call from their corporate customer contact telling me that I was not welcome any longer to eat there!  OMG... It was not my fault that their manager, Gary, couldn't do his job nor that he lied about the whole incident which could have been averted had he handled the situation as a manager instead of a sheep. The CF is well known for long waits, pricey food and slower service. There is one server, Chris Corey who is their conscientious, hard working, pleasant, efficient, personable server. It's extremely difficult to find a parking and then to be hassled with the loud chaos inside their restaurant. Many times I would pay $5 (upfront parking garage which is not ""upfront"") to park and then walk to dine there. Are you new parents?  Kindly train your kids how to dine out BEFORE going to nicer restaurants. Infants should stay home with the babysitter, their dad or their grandma.  I rarely go out to eat but when I do I despise having my meal disrupted by babies/kids yelling/crying or throwing food around on the floor (or on others) and their mother (who only wanted to show off her kids at the nicer restaurant) sits there acting like she doesn't hear or see them causing havoc. There are many other restaurants to choose from such as Denny's, Coco's, Chuck E. Cheese, Mimi's, etc. where the kids could eat until the kids are older and better behaved to be taken to the nicer restaurants.  Be considerate of others who are there to enjoy their meal and time with others. Thank you"
Cory T.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,2,5.0,4/21/2014,Food and service were excellent.  We celebrate our anniversary at Cheese Cake Factory every year.
Jena H.,"San Diego, CA",2,8,,4.0,6/12/2013,"This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants, hands down. My favorite dish is called Pasta Da Vinci. Great customer service, love the vibe, and all their cheesecake! Will definitely be back soon"
kelly s.,"San Diego, CA",569,121,9,4.0,4/6/2009,OMFG now I know why there is a line for this place. My wife took me Friday for lunch we sat at the bar. We had some mojito's that were damn tasty. I had the bbq bacon cheeseburger she had the Shepard's pie. AMAZING food we were too stuffed to try the cheesecake. We felt bad for not trying desert but we couldn't even finish our food. Huge portions! Sit at the bar if you can and beat the line.
