Chris M.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,,2.0,9/10/2009,"What happens when a restaurant tries to be all things to all people?  The Cheesecake Factory. It's enormous menu is replete with mediocre items in big portions.  If you're into chain restaurants with predictable menus, this is your place: it's the same anywhere you go in the country.  Unfortunately, there is not an excellent item anywhere in their list of 300 menu choices.  Go here if you want big food, go elsewhere if you want good food."
Princess Kim R.,"San Diego, CA",121,250,,4.0,1/28/2009,"I LOVE the food here. I always order hot chocolate, crab wontons, and the Classic Burger (rare) with cheese (get the mashed potatoes instead of French fries!). There's always enough to share, and you still have left-overs! Awesome!  I kind of have to laugh at everyone complaining about the wait times. Why would you go to a restaurant like this on a Friday or Saturday night? Of course there are going to be insane wait times! I usually go for an early dinner or even for lunch on weekdays. There is virtually no wait.  The service is 50/50. I've had fantastic service, and I've had service where the chick plopped the food down in front of us, asked if everything looked ok, and then didn't show up again except to present us with dessert menus, rather than asking if we needed anything else. Definitely eat at The Cheesecake Factory. Just be sure to eat there on a weekday, and expect great food, but don't expect great service."
Madison B.,"San Diego, CA",358,412,29,3.0,12/28/2008,"Up until I went to the Incredible Cheesecake Company, I thought this place was pretty good. Whenever I come here, I always manage to get the same booth, which is probably at my favorite location within the restaurant.  Even when the wait for a table is 10 minutes+ it doesn't ever slow down the food, which is good. We love the calamari and shrimp and the spinach cheese dip.  And I, love the peach bellini.  The drinks are always on the weak side, and calls for a great surprise when you get the bill, as they don't put the drink prices on any menus. =)"
Alex B.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,180,,3.0,3/17/2012,"This place is always very packed, even though it is such a large restaurant The wait was long to get seated, not as bad waiting for the actual food All the dishes I have tried here have been good, but nothing exceptional It is overpriced, so beware of that The portions are medium sized Service is usually pretty good for how busy it is There are better places for food at this price, but the food isn't bad"
Sarah C.,"Evanston, IL",28,151,11,2.0,10/26/2008,"Alright, I know, normally I wouldn't review a chain restaurant, but I thought I'd drop a line because of my particular experience with this one. On a Friday night, the CF gets crazy busy, right?  Right.  But we were told around 7pm that the wait would be 15-30 mins.  Totally manageable normally, but I was dining with a diabetic friend who definitely needed to eat in that time frame.  I asked him if that wait was alright and it was, but when it turned into over 45 minutes...that was another story altogether. At the 45 minute mark, I spoke to the hostess about the situation and she seemed not to care at all that our wait time had gone way over, claiming that they weren't able to get us into a four-top for another 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, other people who had gotten there after us had already been seated.  Only once I mentioned the diabetic in the group did she begrudgingly seat us.  No apologies for the wait, no smiling, nothing.  Luckily, we had an amazing server who mostly made up for it...it wasn't her fault they were out of like three things on the menu that people in my party of four wanted.  The food as always was good, huge portions and basic choices-- though I'm still unsure why their menu is 22 pages long. Overall, just skip it.  Go to dinner at a real restaurant and grab some to-go cheesecake on your way home.  You'll enjoy the cheesecake a lot more when you're sitting on your couch watching TV. Also--  just something I noticed in San Diego.  Can we all stop pretending that Cheesecake Factory is some fancy joint that requires dressy clothes?  I fear for San Diego if this is the pinnacle of a good date night experience...it's a glorified Friday's or Macaroni Grill.  We saw far too many people who were dressed up like it was friggin' Homecoming."
Eric G.,"San Diego, CA",15,128,6,3.0,8/5/2009,"This is considered to be one of the nicer establishments in town, and I agree with this only partially. First, the wait. Expect to wait 30 minutes -on a slow day. Weekends.... Forget about it. I know they're popular... I just don't know why. The place is defintiely 'classy', but that doesn't mean most of the food is any better, and the service definitely doesn't even contend with some of the lower class burger joints like TGIF and Applebees. If I'm going to pay $30 for my meal, and wait thirty minutes before I'm even seated and given a menu.... I'd like the service to be a bit more attentive. With respect to the waiters and waitresses there, it's not their fault. There simply aren't enough of them, they're running around like mad between customers, and the establishment simply doesn't have enough of them. It's not like they're hurting for business, so the owners\management could easily afford another employee or two to lighten the load. That said, please be kind to your server, if you watch around the establishment, you'll see them working like crazy to keep everyone satisfied. My hats are off to them. The dessert is what makes this place so well known, and they do call it The Cheesecake Factory for a reason, you'll never be disappointed with it. And they have quite a variety, too. I'm giving this three stars, and I'd like to remind everyone that it's not a bad rating. Yelp consideres three stars to be ""A-OK."", and that's what this place is, it's okay. Personally there are a lot of less crowded places that I'd rather be, but it's not an awful dining experience by any means. Whether you're a San Diego native, or a visitor, you are somewhat rather obligated to try this place at least once."
Lorrin M.,"San Diego, CA",5,5,,5.0,3/12/2010,"After a year or so of using Yelp as a great tool for myself, I've decided to jump abroard and start doing some reviews of my own. Went to Cheesecake Factory on Friars last night and, once again, it totally exceeded my expectations.  There were four of us and we all had very different entrees.  Each of us was really pleased and none of us could finish our plates.   In an economic environment in which money is tight and restaurants are said to be hurting, there was a half hour wait on a Wednesday night at 7:30.... speaks volumes to the Cheesecake model."
Hang V.,"San Diego, CA",7,69,11,5.0,11/21/2011,Came here today for my anniversary. I only been here twice including today. I love eating their bread with butter. Mhmm :) I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It's delicious. Beware its spicy yet so good! This place is quite pricy but it's still a nice place to go eat on special occasions (:
Joy B.,"Irvine, CA",70,234,32,1.0,1/5/2013,"Best thing about this meal was no one got food poisoning.... Never have I been to a Cheesecake Factory with such terrible service. I'm not the type to complain at restaurants but the service was SO bad after we came in for my mom and brothers birthdays that I had to speak with the manager. We told our server when we first arrived that we were there celebrating 2 birthdays which she ignored, the service was ridiculously slow even though the restaurant was less than half full. We had to flag down various servers and busboys to take our order, refill drinks, provide our check and run the check. 4 of the 5 meals came out together and we were asked if we wanted to have our food delivered as is, without the sauce so that we could all eat together... Uhh, seriously??! Did I order the dish without sauce? No. So why would I do that because you are incapable of having everything ready at the same time? Such a weird experience and a disappointing birthday for the family. I went to see a manager after the meal and was again let down by how dismissive he was, stating that the food did not come out at the same time because of kitchen issues. Again, why are your kitchen issues my issue? Please do something to rectify the situation like let your customers know ahead of time and comp an appetizer or something! Will not be back to this location, luckily I have other Cheesecake Factory's near me that know how to treat their customers. I do loves me some Cheesecake :)"
Shandra D.,"Lemon Grove, CA",1,9,,4.0,2/27/2012,good food. Great cheescake
Joy M.,"San Diego, CA",156,76,11,5.0,7/3/2009,"I have been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory since the 1990's! When attending college, my roommates and I would visit the Newport location monthly!  I returned home to San Diego and when I would visit friends in Orange County, I would make a special trip to the restaurant in Newport. When I found out they were opening up a restaurant in Fashion Valley I was estatic!  No more driving to Orange County! My husband and I always order the calamari!  No other restaurant can compare with the calamari at Cheesecake Factory.  The brown bread served at your table is delicious, one of the other things I look forward to when I go to Cheesecake. The servings are hearty and can feed at least 2 1/2 people!  The food is delicious and there is so much variety to choose from and that's just the food!  They have so many more choices for dessert! Definitely wait 45 mins to eat at the Cheesecake Factory.  Don't go to the Bing Crosby Piano Bar across the street - the service there sucks!"
Russell B.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,4.0,6/15/2012,Great place to eat when you have to go shopping. I always get a pasta dish and love it. The service is always good and so is the food. The place is clean and it's at the mall. You can keep your stomach happy and your girl..what's better than that?
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,1.0,8/26/2009,"We were very let down with this place.  The ambiance and decor were the only thing Cheescake Factoryesque about it.  I ordered the shrimp scampi and my husband had the four cheese pasta.  After a good 25 minute wait, we got our food.  My husband's order came cold, so we sent it back.  Another 15 minutes went by and the waitress expressed her sincerest appologies and mentioned that the chef whole-heartedly agreed with our decision to send it back.  We shook it off and began to eat, and it was cold again!  This time he just let it go, I think it was because my husband didn't want to ruin the dinner celebration for me getting her new job.  They only savior of the night was the sox/yankees game in the background (which the sox won)."
Dulce M.,"Oceanside, CA",40,229,18,5.0,1/7/2012,"I love this place.  Consistency is key!  There is such a great variety of food from pizza to fish tacos to steak to oh so delicious salads. For all you dieters, they have a Skinnylicious Menu that is amazing!  I've never had a bad experience.  The staff is always attentive, friendly and accommodating to my crazy order changes. The lemon drop martini is my favorite drink!! I never get tired of eating here."
Keith W.,"San Diego, CA",35,256,23,3.0,7/9/2009,"I think this place is not so bad. The food: I give 3 stars. The selection is huge. So many options of food, and it seems that there are just as much cheesecake and dessert options! The food is not bad either. The portions here are pretty big, I sometimes leave noticing I have overeaten at this place. So, this is a good place to break your diet. The service: I give 3 stars. Nothing bad about it. Nothing great about. The place: I give 4 stars. It's a nice restaurant. So, pretty alright place: 3 stars. =)"
Jillian Y.,"San Diego, CA",27,97,16,3.0,7/8/2009,"I'm very wish washy with this place. One day I like it and the other I am ehhh with it. I rarely go here now because of how packed it gets, even when I was a kid it was so busy. I can see what appeals to people, that mainly being cheesecake-duh! Their food is so-so nothing really spectacular or anything, but it will definitely kill your hungry when finished. I never eat the same thing here so I cant really comment on particular dishes, but I never remember one being bad but not amazing. The cheesecake options here are pretty well spread out. Anyone who really likes sweets can get a fix here for their sweet tooth. I pass on the cheesecake most times because I am stuffed.  Overall, one and a half stars for food and one and a half stars for their cheesecake. Its good but not amazing as I stated, but if you re hungry and walking around fashion its a good place to stop off. Try to avoid weekends and Friday nights otherwise you got a long wait ahead of you."
Ed M.,"San Diego, CA",334,978,840,4.0,8/19/2009,"This place always seems to be crowded everyday no matter what day it is. I came here for a few dinner dates in the past, and the service was pretty good. The only downer is that if you want to make reservations ahead forget it. They don't take them. So you basically gotta show up and hope its not crowded to the point of a wait. The portions they serve their food in is pretty hefty. So you will get your money's worth. The cheesecake is off the hook, and its obviously its strong point. This is a very upscale, nice restaurant to eat at...and afterward you can walk around the fashion valley mall and drop what's left of your cash on the stores."
bobbie w.,"San Diego, CA",3,12,2,4.0,2/10/2012,If you're with a group of people that cannot decide where they want to eat the Cheesecake Factory is perfect.  There are so many things to choose from on their menu!   The portions are huge so I usually end up splitting something with a friend. If you're shopping at Fashion Valley it's the perfect place to stop for lunch!
Alexa P.,"San Diego, CA",119,24,3,5.0,7/16/2011,"Best place ever Chicken Madiera is awesome! Husband loves the ""Glamburgers""! Love the kids menu to very cheap and enough  to share if you get the pasta! Strawberry lemonade is great kinda pricey at 4.95 for some lemons so I always get a cup to go!"
Eugene A.,"Carlsbad, CA",164,66,14,4.0,7/4/2009,"Awesome desserts; which is what you'd expect but their meals are equally good.  An expansive menu which for me makes choosing difficult.  I had the chicken madeira and it was excellent.  The chicken was moist and tender and the mushroom sauce just had a hint of sweetness from the madeira wine.  My wife had Evelyn's Pasta and all of the ingredients, which were many, were complimentary to each other and bright enough to not be overshadowed by another ingredient.  We finished with the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake which was also excellent with fudge topping and caramel chips and the smooth and silky cheesecake woven through it with a cup of house java. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.  He waived the corkage on the bottle of merlot that we brought and comped us on the java.  We appreciated that too!  My only knock on the place is the noise level which is in the middle decibel range but all in all a good experience.  Not my first time at any Cheesecake Factory so I guess I'm a fan.  For the uninitiated, be prepared to wait at the peak dinner hours."
