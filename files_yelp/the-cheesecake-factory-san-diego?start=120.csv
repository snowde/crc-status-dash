Wilson A.,"San Diego, CA",267,633,557,4.0,7/16/2016,"I'd say that once we were seated, it became a 5-star experience. Ann Marie, our server, was absolutely perfect.  I have no idea how the other servers are, but Ann Marie seems to be one of the very good ones. As you can probably tell from either past experiences or other reviews, this place can have an insane wait, especially during dinner.  Showing up at 7pm is probably the worst decision anybody could make.  My girlfriend and I showed up at about 8pm, so it wasn't that bad despite the large crowd being seen waiting outside. I ordered the Shephard's Pie, and although it wasn't as I expected, it was actually very delicious.  Their rendition comes in a deep plate, but not in a ""pie"" dish.  Definitely more presentable than what we'd expect usually. The Dulce De Leche cheesecake was perfect.  Not too overpowering.  Great suggestion from our server. Just a few FYI's: - The menu is fairly extensive.  One of the pages is full of chicken dishes.  They even have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu insert, which takes specific items on the regular menu and puts it all in one place for the health-conscious customers.  It's their way of responding to the concerns of their cuisine being somewhat on the unhealthy side as well as plentiful. - Prices are a bit higher for what they offer.  However, it can be said that you get what you pay for.  Higher prices for larger portions. - They do not take reservations.  And for good reason too.  They get mobbed on a regular basis.  They're better off seating people who are physically there."
Whitney H.,"Lakeside, CA",558,33,4,2.0,7/29/2017,Pretty damn irritated. Had dinner here earlier and asked them to pack my leftovers. Got home and only half of my almost FULL sandwich was packed!! Apparently they were just teaching me that they don't want to pack things for customers and I should just do it myself. Talk about feeling ripped off!!!
Saleen D.,"San Diego, CA",705,1120,1464,3.0,1/10/2016,"I have the pleasure of living in between The Cheesecake Factory in North County Fair & in Fashion Valley.  The deciding factor of which one I go to is based on the estimated wait & on this last Friday night, Fashion Valley won with 30 minutes (versus an hour & 15 minutes).  Shame, they still do not take reservations!  & there is never not a wait! Complimentary Bread Fettuccini Alfredo - My favorite yet!  Sauce is so creamy & flavorful! Crispy Chicken Costoletta = Served with mashed potatoes & asparagus - Refreshing dish with the lemon seasoning.  Chicken is nicely crisped on the outside but unfortunately dry.  There is sauce that the chicken lays upon & I was continuously  dipping each piece in it to add some juicyness.  Sadness, it did not help. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - I never considered this cheesecake before but I am glad that my boyfriend picked it out.  It was sweet & light with several banana pieces.  The crust seemed like a mixture between a traditional graham cracker crust & a pie crust.  I think they should add a drizzle of caramel sauce... Customer service was fantastic.  We had Cheryl who was amazing & attentive."
Melanie P.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/3/2017,"I always order the jambalaya pasta, and they never disappoint me! I totally recommend it. There menu option has tons of veriety."
Norma O.,"San Diego, CA",32,109,21,5.0,3/19/2017,Originally we sat inside but it was super noisy so we asked if we could get moved outside. No one complained and moved us right out there and sat us in Ann Marie's station. She is the description of good customer service and was super attentive! Funny too! I'm basing my 5 stars on her service (and the others who helped us move out to the patio) and the food is pretty good too.  Ann Marie you were awesome!
Ros A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",540,269,761,3.0,1/1/2016,"The food is good at Cheesecake Factory. There most likely will be a wait to dine as well. My review is based on a recent dining experience.  We opted to sit outside mainly for the shorter wait time, but also for fesh air and it's not as loud as the inside can get. When we sat down we were seated near a heat lamp which helped.  I regrettably didn't get our servers name, as this review is based mostly on the service. After we ordered, the sun moved and it was shinning right on my mom's face. Even with sunglasses on, it wouldn't have been the best experience to have the sun right on your face. We asked the server if we could move to a different table outside that didn't shine right on us (and perhaps I should have asked the hostess instead). He turned our table just slightly and instead of the sun shinning right on her face it was right up against the side. This made us right up next to the chairs for the table behind us. This didn't help and it didn't seem as if he was willing to move us, so we switched seats.  To eat, I had the California avocado salad and I asked for the dressing on the side. When our food came, my salad came but no dressing. I asked for dressing. I told everyone to start eating as my dressing would soon be out. No dressing came and our server didn't even come out to check on us. No where in sight. Everyone started to slowly stop eating as I hadn't even started as and they were half way through. I got up and looked around the patio for our server. No where. I went inside and looked around where the kitchen was. No where. Finally another server saw me looking around and asked if I needed something. I told her I hadn't gotten my dressing and she said she'd bring it right out. At least she was willing to help.  Finally I get my dressing and I can eat. The food at Cheesecake is consistent and most of the dishes are good.  I will probably be back to cheesecake at some point, but it would help if service was better."
Tat S.,"Tamuning, Guam",36,38,231,2.0,9/18/2016,"Food is okay,  value is fair, great atmosphere place is huge and able to accommodate all types of groups. Service is questionable, staff there some are good some are real bad.  Water I got smelled like grease trap at the beginning was okay then last water they have me was horrible. My friends even mentioned it I don't known if they used the pitcher to scoop up the grease trap but that got us out of there real f"
Gabriel C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,5,2.0,9/16/2017,They took a really long time too even help us out. They have no time management it took them half an hour to even bring us bread. HONESLTY my first time here and I'm very disappointed. Everyone I have ever really asked about this place really made it seem like jt was a good place to come eat. I guess not.
Lisa G.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",823,403,3499,4.0,12/18/2015,"Dropped by here for a company dinner yesterday. Felt a bit bad as we were one of those large groups and we ended up having to wait a half hour to a hour after we were seated as our main people for the night were stuck in traffic. The waiter was very sweet and patient though our group was a bit loud and bickering in Chinese. We ended up ordering some appetizers first and making small talk until the entire group arrived. My to go to at ANY Cheesecake Factory is the Buffalo Blasts and the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I went to the one in Long Island back in NY a lot so I knew what I was getting myself into. Buffalo Blasts had chicken and cheese combined together within a crispy outer layer that you could put some blue cheese or hot sauce in to make a delicious medley in your mouth. Almost like some fireworks. But yes, that is my favorite to get. Thai Lettuce Wraps was another one of my staples to get as it is light and easy to digest. Just put everything in the lettuce and wrap it. Wa-lah~. Other appetizers like the fried calamari and the avocado eggrolls were pretty good too. Fried calamari is like at every food place - so pretty much self explanatory. Avocado eggrolls were nicely toasted when coming out though the display on one of the ones that came out clearly stated that it was rushed. But hey, food's food! I tried the Steak Diane (a piece of it from my coworker's place) later on - and must say, that is a pretty delicious piece of meat. Cheesecake Factory knows what they are doing! I was way too full to finish my Shepherd's Pie but my cousin finished that once I got home so I would say it was good. Service was on point - only not so good thing is that they don't take reservations. Heard from my coworkers who left early to score us that spot that they were waiting for quite some time while everyone else tried to beat rush hour traffic. Would most definitely recommend to anyone whose craving something not too upscale and not too casual - but maybe in the middle. For groups though, might be a tight fit at seating."
Erica S.,"Oceanside, CA",143,192,170,3.0,2/10/2017,"This is a tough one...It deserves more than ok, yet not Im a FAN.... Feb ninth, nine pm....wait about 20  minutes.  Hostess: HORRIBLE, she clearly was more interested in socializing with the rest of her co worker than being the FIRST impression when you walk in. After 20 minutes I was feeling shaky due to lack of food and approached her to see if she had or could get me crackers perhaps. Received a ""look"", like a teenager you are asking to take the trash, and a response: ""no I don't , you can go to the bar"". Made my way there, not feeling right. Repeated the same to Josh: reply ""I don't have crackers here but sit, let me go get you some bread"" ONE STAR there Made a comment to management , she  apologize, and that was the last time I saw her. Star 2: Franklin: absolutely a perfect representation of someone proud to work where they do (and if he doesn't, he fakes it to perfection). Attentive, convincingly  apologetic when the last dish of our party arrived 20 minutes after everyone else's, and impeccable head to toe. Star 3: the food. Although its a chain and there are more options than Jesus commands on the Bible...they manage to serve food that delivers flavor and great presentation did not eat cheesecake this time. Too full."
Michael M.,"National City, CA",5,26,20,1.0,7/31/2017,"Came for National Cheesecake Day, half price. Guess what, the cashier working at 10 PM at to-go counter said person must be present to get the discount. Ok, understand that, I asked the if the baby is eligible, she cannot answer. Discriminating the baby? Look at the fine print, dine in only to be eligible for discount, guess what, they are selling to-go cheesecake for half price. I will tell all my friends and family the experience I had and encourage them not come back at any Cheesecake Factory restaurants."
Jessica M.,"San Diego, CA",68,57,,5.0,3/25/2017,"This review is specifically for the busboy, Carlos. He was working around 7pm 3/24 I noticed he was working hard while keeping a smile on his face. I was trying to get the waiters attention but they were all rushing by, Carlos was the only one to assist us. I hope he gets recognized for his great customer service."
Sylvia H.,"San Diego, CA",56,147,1274,4.0,1/11/2016,"This place is always pretty busy, probably because its popular and being located in Fashion Valley Mall, which itself is always busy, doesn't help. Came on a Sunday around 6pm and was told it would be 15 minutes, but was seated within 10! It is a bit loud, but we were seated in a corner by the window, so it was nice, quiet and intimate. The seats were comfortable. There is also a large outdoor patio. There is lots of room for large groups. Its pretty casual for a sit down place and seems totally kid friendly.  Our server, Lymn, was really friendly, quick and attentive. He explained everything and answered all of our questions thoroughly. Nothing went wrong with our order and he fulfilled all our special requests. He's definitely one of the better waiters I've had in recent memory.  The menu here is huge and very varied. Its best to come somewhat prepared knowing the general ""category / type"" of food you are looking for so you can narrow it down a bit. There is a Skinnylicious (lighter choices) menu too, which is nice, especially considering this place is known to be a calorie bomb. The complimentary bread was nice. The sourdough was dry and too crunchy, though. However, the honey wheat bread was so good. It arrived warm and a bit crunchy on the outside but soft and the inside. Worth the trip, right there. Our food arrived quickly, hot and fresh.  I had the MEXICAN CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAP TACOS ($6.95) from the Skinnylious and Starters/Small Plates Menu.  Butter Lettuce Leaves Filled with Grilled Chicken and Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, Roasted Corn Salsa and Crema. I asked for extra butter lettuce and boy did they deliver; it felt like I almost got a side salad (very fresh one at that). The chicken was perfectly grilled and flavorful. There were only about 5 good sized pieces, so its a lighter meal, but still filling. There were huge chunks of perfectly ripe avocado. The salsa was well spiced and flavourful, with the cilantro and lime being prominent. The crema sauce on the side was not as spicy as the salsa, but well seasoned. Overall, it was a great tasting meal with good quality ingredients and a good value.  My friend had an appetizer (BEETS WITH GOAT CHEESE Fresh Beets, Apples, Baby Arugula, Pecans and Vinaigrette from the Skinnylious menu $6.95). The beets were nicely cooked, but there weren't that many of them. There were generous portions of goat cheese though. Her entree was the CHICKEN BELLAGIO (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad). There was a large portion of prosciutto, but it was cut rather thick which is odd. I didn't try this, but it looked good and  she really enjoyed both her choices. She took 1/2 her entree home; the portions are really substantial.  Overall, if you don't mind a bit of noise and wait, the place is comfortable, the service was great and the food quality, taste and value are really good. I'll definitely be back to try something else."
Sergio F.,"San Diego, CA",63,64,43,3.0,11/10/2016,"California Guacamole Salad and the Macaroni and Cheese Burger is what we ordered. The salad was good and had alright flavor. It had much more of a tang to it then I thought it would and also the lettuce was pretty soggy, it seemed like the dressing had been on it for awhile.  The burger was a little over the top. We had never seen a Macaroni and Cheese burger before so we had to try it. If you don't really really love Cheese don't order it. There is so much Cheese we both felt a little noxious after only eating half each and we didn't even eating the bun."
Kieara P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,11,2,3.0,9/17/2017,"Timothy was an awesome, professional waiter. I'm giving it 3 stars due to our food being cold and silverware was dirty TWICE. Although I loved the seating view outside and our waiter, I probably will not be back. I brought my mother and my wife, and all of our food was cold."
Cassie O.,"Lacey, WA",102,3,2,4.0,5/22/2017,"Besides a long wait, I was impressed. Great food, awesome service. We sat outside and the outdoor area was very clean. Had the Baja chicken tacos definitely recommend. Only thing was that we found some peas on our plates but nobody had order any peas lol"
Francis G.,"Chula Vista, CA",339,6,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Make sure you have lots to talk about! Cause you won't be getting a seat or your food for a long time. Our party had plans of dinner then a movie after. We were quoted a 20 min wait time, and we finally seated after 55 mins. Food then took another 41 minutes. I could literally feel the wrinkles developing on my face. All I ask if for a better accurate quote time."
Evelyn D.,"San Diego, CA",73,125,17,1.0,7/22/2017,"This is one of the worst Cheesecake Factory locations. I understand that it's extra chaotic because it's across from the mall, so they're always crazy busy, however service is beyond lacking. It's a shame this is the closest Cheesecake near me"
Melissa D.,"San Diego, CA",1,51,,2.0,2/14/2017,"The service was slow & I wasn't pleased! My dad & I sat by the bar & it was super slow & I ordered a Mai Thai & it wasn't that good but I didn't say anything cause I didn't want to wait again. The food was not that special, I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Club which the waitress told me it is good & popular but it wasn't, I wanted to return it but again I didn't want to wait a long time for another food order to come so I dealt with it but it wasn't a club sandwich cause it mostly consisted of a hole lot of tomato than anything else & the chicken was dry as can be & the fries were cold & not seasoned. Horrible!  Then my dad & I waited & waited for the waiter to come by with the check & I was going to order cheesecake but the service was getting worse & worse we paid & left! I bought a slice of cheesecake at the cheesecake bar but it is ridiculous that it was $8.57 for a slice of cheesecake! I won't be coming here that much anymore cause the service is horrible, the food is nothing special & the prices are ridiculous! No thank you"
Sheryllyn E.,"Newport Beach, CA",441,243,1052,4.0,7/5/2016,"Not bad for a busy Sunday night, the crowd was around and waiting, but the wait for a family of 5 was 15 minutes, I had expected longer. The cheesecake display was already making me hungry that I was deciding right then which one to take home. My family got the calamari and avocado rolls to start. Calamari was brought out warm. Some pieces were tough and felt it was battered a bit too much. They forgot lemon, so be sure to ask them. Table set up was off because they had sat us in a booth. Wish the servers paid more attention to the diners and space. The booth was small and I was in smashed in the corner by my two brothers but luckily I'm a small girl. So, table space was small trying to accommodate 3 drinks and 2 hot teas.  Bread came in fresh and the butter was really cold. Speaking of cold, the AC was blasting but I think they had no control over it, it was perfect temp for the servers though who were always moving. AC had eventually stopped which made eating for enjoyable. Avocado rolls were next, there was six pieces and it was chuncky and crunchy fresh delicious (I could've ate my own) So I got Evelyn's pasta with angel hair. I wish there was more veggies, there is no meat in it but the pine nuts made it hearty good. There was eggplant, zucchini, and olives that stood out in the dish. My older brother ordered shrimp with beans and rice, it was supposed to come with plantain which he was looking forward to, but was informed last minute that they were out. He was disappointed. I wished the server had checked on the ingredients in stock prior to the dish coming out. The server had already come with his dish and informing plantains had run out (assuming cuban dish) it lacked in character for both food and service. Very poorly executed. Other dished turned out fine, the chicken piccata looked great and the salmon with mashed potatoes looked very good.      Despite some set backs in the food and service, dining with family made it better. We had a good time and ended up taking cheesecake slices to go. The lemon meringue was delicious. Kona coffee wasn't too sweet and the dolce leche tasted rich and creamy. Perfect ending!"
