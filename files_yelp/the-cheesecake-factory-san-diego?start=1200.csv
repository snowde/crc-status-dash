Mireya V.,"San Diego, CA",160,145,60,4.0,8/16/2009,"Must try the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake! It is filling and rich, so I wouldn't recommend eating it with a tummy full of food! You won't have room for it!"
Eddie P.,"San Diego, CA",900,709,158,3.0,8/6/2008,"The cheesecake is awesome. The service isn't. The wait is atrocious. You really have to weigh your options before going to the Cheesecake Factory. It's not the best food, but it's sure priced like it is. Cheesecakes are definitely the best thing they've got going for them since their food is average, their drink menu and specials are so-so, and their prices are pretty high. My biggest complaint: The wait. It's ridiculous. Hire a bum to wait for you. It's probably the only way you'll get in."
Matthew N.,"Portland, OR",235,91,189,4.0,9/11/2011,Came here for a birthday and it was good. Ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it was very good. Portions are big so bring your appetite.
Cerissa F.,"San Diego, CA",15,6,,4.0,1/25/2010,"This is one of my favorite go-to restaurants because they basically have everything! I mean, have you seen their menu? It's like a book!  There's something for everyone.  One of my favorite dishes is the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp, yum! But everything I've ordered there has been delicious.  Oh, and the portions are huge! So you'll probably be needing a to-go box if you want to save room for dessert. You can't come here and not order cheesecake, they are the Cheesecake Factory, of course (they have a whole chapter of cheesecakes in their menu book).  I'm a chocolate lover so I always get the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake.  It is literally chocolate heaven on a plate. The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that they don't take reservations.  I've had to wait anywhere from 45mins to an hour or more to be seated.  This place gets packed!  Since the mall is just right there, it can make the wait a little more bearable.  But it's all worth it once I take a bite of that Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Overall, I highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory.  Whether for date night or celebrating with a large group, there's something for every taste.  Just be prepared for the wait."
Paul J.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,4.0,5/13/2012,"I think this place delivers great value for what you pay. The ambiance is pleasant, the service attentive and menu so diverse that you can eat here every day and never get bored. From sandwiches, to steaks everything tastes appropriate. I love to get a bunch of appetizers and share one entree with my wife. Portions are big and drinks well made. Wine list is nothing special but if you look for a casual dining that can make everyone in your group happy the cheesecake factory is the place for you."
Steph V.,"La Jolla, CA",7,33,,4.0,11/10/2008,"I had a pretty nice experience at this Cheesecake Factory yesterday.  After a 40 minute wait for a table, we found that the table was only big enough for 7, and our party had 9 people. So I had to go back to the hostess and tell her that four of us needed a separate table.  They were really quick (like 60 seconds quick) about getting us a new table, and we were seated in no time.   The whole place is really crowded (in fact, it sounds a little like a theme park ) so our food took a while, but it was worth it.  I ordered the Portabella Bun (9.95) and it was really really good. No, actually it was awesome.  I would label this eatery ""vegetarian friendly"" because although they don't have too many veggie options, the options that they do have are delicious.  For a place named after a dessert food, Cheesecake Factory has pretty amazing main courses. I sampled some of my friend's tiramisu and it was excellent, really nice and fluffy and flavorful.  I also sampled some of my friend's raspberry lemon cheesecake, which was likewise a success."
Jonathan S.,"Queens, NY",0,16,,5.0,1/20/2012,"One of my favorite places to eat in San Diego area. Better than the one in LA, and a million times better than the ones in the New York area. The food simply tastes better and fresh-er than anywhere else, and I am not sure why. Order the steak diane there and taste the difference."
Michelle W.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/24/2012,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory.  I can always say that I am never let down by them.  They always have good food, the service is great and they are very attentive and there is nothing better than eating a good cheesecake after dinner with a nice hot apple cider to finish it off. :) yumm."
Lynn M.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",5,16,5,1.0,4/24/2013,"Today my husband and I had the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The hostess said there would a 15 min wait which went by pretty fast. We were seated near the restroom but at least    We had been seated fast. I ordered a regular lemonade, and my husband ordered water. Our server brought me a strawberry lemonade, when my husband said to her ""she ordered a regular"", she replied ""Oh that's my mistake ugh"" and walked away pretty upset, she brings back a regular lemonade in the same glass she had used for the strawberry lemonade. I could tell due to the strawberry seeds and debris floating around in the glass. When we were ready to order she seems as of she did not want to take our order. After taking our order we waited almost an hour when I noticed the table behind us who had been sat about ten minutes after us had received their food and bill before we even received out food. I can understand if we special ordered something but we ordered a hamburger and Shepard's pie. an hour had gone by and We had only seen our server when she was tending to the tables around us. We paid for our drink and left. Needless to say I will never be returning to the Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Valley"
Bill P.,"Escondido, CA",713,447,1225,4.0,7/3/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory yummy!!! Well I had a very nice dining experience here this week. My buddy and I sat at the bar and the bartender was quick to getting us our drinks. My buddy got a dirty tini and I got a draft. We were both hungry so we ordered an appetizer we went with the VIETNAMESE SHRIMP SUMMER ROLLS. They were very light and refreshing, Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp. Served Chilled and not Fried I highly recommend these. Then I ordered AHI CARPACCIO  Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli this dish was awesome again nice and light eating. My friend ordered the CUBAN SANDWICH  Slow-Roasted Pork, Ham, Swiss cheese, Pickles and Mustard on a Grilled and Pressed Cuban-Style Roll Served with French Fries. I tried his sandwich and it was great. Great food, good solid service and a nice atmosphere, it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for, no complaints at all. I will be going back here for sure"
Michael F.,"San Diego, CA",179,53,1,5.0,9/11/2011,I can't get enough of this place!!! I could eat here everyday if my wallet was big enough! The menu is vast and the service is always wonderful. I personally love the Chicken Costoletta. It's a lightly breaded chicken dish accompanied by their delicious mashed potatoes and asparagus. Every time I eat here it's like sensory overload. The servers are usually good looking and food is impeccable. I love this place. I prefer  the Fashion Valley location because it's in Fashion Valley mall...my home away from home. :-)
AKA A.,"San Diego, CA",53,168,11,4.0,12/26/2011,I love Cheesecake Factory. Just dont order chinese from there. Always a great meal.
Kim A.,"San Diego, CA",87,15,,5.0,3/31/2011,I think I have honestly tried every cheesecake you have.... and gained abt 10 pounds lol. I love the staff and the environment is great. The wait sucks but if you go with a friend you like its not bad at all. PS i really wish i never looked at the calories on the cheesecake!!
Linda B.,"Lemoore, CA",3,13,,5.0,1/29/2012,"Always avoided this place, but ventured in with my girlfriend for lunch. After we placed our orders we waited a bit and then the manager Jason approached our table telling me that the chef had miscounted the number of pasta dishes he need and mine would be a bit late in coming out. Then he asked if he could have salads brought to us at no charge to relieve the delay. How smart was that and it worked! The salads and pasta dishes were wonderful and we felt well taken care of in this restaurant. I am already craving their fettuccini alfredo again!"
Jennifer J.,"San Diego, CA",309,118,6,5.0,9/16/2008,"Honestly, The Cheesecake Factory is one of my top five favorite restaurants and has held this prestigious honor since it opened up at The Fashion Valley mall. Here is my top 10 list as to why The Factory deserves the honor: 10. The menu is huge. If you can't find something that you utterly enjoy on it, go back to McDonald's. 9. The wait staff is always accommodating. You can substitute things and it will still come out the exact way you asked, on the first try. ( I have a picky mother-in-law and there are ALWAYS substitutions when she orders her meals) 8. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar and want to eat there, they set you up right with all serving utensils and place mat. Plus, you get your drinks faster, score! 7. Outside seating. We live in SD, sitting outside is a must! Especially those of us that are chained to a desk most of the day. 6. Plenty of tables. When a restaurant is as popular as this one, they need lots of tables and The Cheesecake factory has plenty. I have yet to wait over an hour for a seat, even on a holiday weekend. 5. Artichoke Dip. This is my favorite appetizer ever and the Factory does it well. Spinach, artichokes, cheese=Heaven. 4. Avocado Egg rolls. Really, I have no need to say more. 3. Cheesecakes! In every flavor imaginable. And they all rule! They even have sugar-free ones for those of us that can't have sugar. Yes! 2. Blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis! These little morsels rock and The Factory hand-stuffs them. Mmm... 1. And Finally, Miso Salmon. I can't even find the words as to how great this dish is. The fish, the sauce, it is so freakin' good. I have been to the restaurant when they were all out of it (it has to marinade over night and they only make a certain amount) and I think I cried. Thank goodness there are so many other delicious dishes but the Miso Salmon, just might be my request for a last meal."
Tiffany R.,"Gary, IN",5,35,,5.0,1/9/2013,"I can only leave a review regarding my take out experiences which have been several. I always get the same thing, Mac n Cheese Balls!!! Very consistent!! Every time I order them and pick them up they taste the same as they did the last time I ordered and picked them up....DELISH!!! Words can't even describe the complex flavor of cheeses fighting for your taste buds attention but it all works beautifully together. The sauce on them is outstanding and to marry it with those complex, cheesey pasta balls is pure genius!! They're so good I haven't been able to bring myself to order anything else from their vast menu as of yet. Why mess with a good thing, right?? Of course, I always get a piece of cheesecake to top off my Mac n Cheese Balls and the few different choices I've tried have always met my standards for fabulous cheesecake. Whenever I go in to pick up my order they're ALWAYS polite and helpful. They answer any questions I have about their menu, knowledgeably. I recommend The Cheesecake Factory. The only thing I DON'T recommend is SHARING!! It's just that good!!"
Hana M.,"San Diego, CA",3,25,7,5.0,8/7/2013,"delicous, men-   take your girl here on a date and satisfy that sweet tooth"
Joan E.,"San Diego, CA",174,150,24,2.0,5/20/2008,"I think our server was stoned. When she did that first check up once you have gotten your food she walked up to me really mellow and sleepy-eyed and said, ""that looks good""....but in a really dragged-out-envious jeff-spicoli-stoner kind of way.  Does that make sense?  It was creepy!!!! Oh...just one of the many ways this restaurant totally blew lunch w/the Favorite Boy!!!!! The menu can be confusing. High five, it's huge, but that doesn't necessarily make the quality the best.  They brought the Boy the wrong kind of sandwich.  And my meatloaf after careful dissection looked like Dog food.  I saw rice in there..and some grated carrot.  I got sad :( The music made me laugh. We came to the conclusion that it sounded like some cheesy hotel lounge jazz for blue-hairs that receives golf-claps at the end.    Oh well...at least we were entertaining ;) But neither of us wanted cheesecake by the end..we just wanted to leave."
Maggie C.,"San Diego, CA",45,37,,5.0,1/7/2013,"This is the best place to eat in this country! I love everything about it. Every single thing I've ordered here tasted absolutely amazing. The thing I order now is the Chicken Medeiros and it's a little piece of Heaven, it's a must try. The drinks are always the best. The reason this restaurant beats all the other restaurants in my book is their menu, it's like a mini book of food - they have EVERYTHING here. You're in the mood for steak? Done. Fish, pizza, salads, chicken, hundred options of food and desserts. They always bring bread and butter while you wait for your meal (which I think every place should do cause PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY!) It is pricy but it's worth it! People always think since it's called the Cheesecake factory it's just for sweets, I've had people refusing to go for that reason. However, everyone who refused to go but eventually let me convince them went crazy over this place."
Lauren V.,"Ontario, CA",0,13,1,4.0,3/11/2012,This place is definitely more than cheesecake... their menu is so diverse and very good. I had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it was very good and the potion size was very generous. Of course my date and I finished off our meals with a Delicious piece of good ole fashioned NY cheesecake. Great experience
