Dawn D.,"San Diego, CA",7,138,34,2.0,8/28/2013,"If you can get past the overwhelming menu and find something you like the food can be great,  some can be just mediocre.   I love the chicken club sandwich and am pleased that they added a kids menu in the last year or so.   I only gave them 2 stars because of the horrible service I have received the last couple of times I have been there.   The hostess was really rude this time, I had left my keys at the table and I called to ask if they had been turned in, she rudely told me to come back over and look for them.   When I did arrive I asked to speak with the manager and he was no better, he told me to wait until the current diners had finished their meal,  they had just received their food.  I waited almost 20 minutes before I just asked them nicely if I could look under their table, which the manager should have done!!!  (considering I am 7 months pregnant with a 20 month old that was screaming because she was ready for her nap he could have been more helpful!)  The staff could use some work on their hospitality skills considering the restaurant wasn't really busy when I had an issue."
Tino S.,"Poway, CA",0,84,1,4.0,2/17/2011,"Good food. I only go for lunch. Never had the cheesecake, but the salmon is always tasty. Definitely recommended. Parking is some of the worst around simply because this restaurant and mall are always busy. Nice feel and decor. I have never had any bad wait staff experiences."
Michael L.,"Keller, TX",2,573,2,2.0,10/13/2008,"I have a love/hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory.   I Hate Cheesecake Factory because their food is below average and their service is impatient and inattentive.  Hell, even their namesake cheesecake isn't all that great.   I LOVE Cheesecake Factory because it attracts retards who are willing to wait in line for their mediocre food.  All those people waiting in line who are willing to settle for chain restaurant food are people that I dont have to wait behind at all the GOOD restaurants around town."
Lisa T.,"San Diego, CA",41,67,1,4.0,11/9/2010,"Ok, ok I know this place is always packed but thanks to my super sleuth like tendencies, I happen to know just where to park in FV, plus the co- worker and I have been hitting it up EARLY for lunch (11:30) so we get in and get out in a flash! So to start, the lettuce wraps are a MUST! I know what you're thinking, oh pf changs are the best, and while I do agree they are delicious as well, you HAVE to try cheesecake factory's. We recently tried the vietnamese tacos...yummmmy!  pulled pork on spongy little breads, like siopao!! loved it!! All the sammies we've had have been great as well. Service is top notch, ALWAYS have a doggy bag to go for mid afternoon noshing.  Oh ya, and the key lime cheesecake is THEEEEE BEST!"
Venus L.,"San Diego, CA",43,83,2,4.0,12/16/2008,"Even though I've been living in San Diego for most of my life, I have never eaten at Cheesecake.  I guess it's because my family is not into the whole wait-forever-and-then-wait-for-food thing, but I've always wanted to go.  Luckily, I went with a large group (the majority of them foreign students who are studying at SDSU).   We were a large group (around 20+) but the restaurant managed the accompany us all.  Our waitress was so kind and everything and even managed to introduce to us her replacement when she went on her break.  Based on most of the reviews here, the service wasn't so great for other reviewers... but for us service was fine with no problems (even if it meant catering to such a large party).   I like how the menu is so diverse... everything from burgers to pasta to seafood.  I ordered one of the burgers (I think it was the classic or something like that) and that was tasty.  Everyone that I sat with ordered a range of food.. mostly pasta, pizza and steaks.  And from what they told me, they enjoyed their food.   I think me (and everyone else) were too full to have dessert.  Once I go back to have the cheesecake, then (hopefully) I can add that other star to my review. But in all, my Cheesecake experience was a good one.  Of course, being in Fashion Valley, it's going to be hard to find parking (I had to go around the mall a few times before finding a spot.. and it was during the week!) and you might experience a long wait time (it's always going to be busy) but it's worth it in the end."
Bonnie P.,"Escondido, CA",1,83,15,4.0,12/16/2012,"Although I've lived in San Diego for over 11 years, this was my first visit to The Cheesecke Factory. We were seated in the rotunda which is beautiful. Our appetizer was the avocado eggrolls. If you love avocado, you'll dream about these for a very long time. They have an extensive menu offering something for everybody. I decided on the Mushroom Glamburger. All I have to say is YUM! Between the beautifully toasted buns, the huge pile of mushrooms, juicy beef, and two types of cheese made this hamburger one of the best I've ever tasted. The sweet potato fries were a delicious accompaniment . The portions are so huge. I wish I had been more moderate with my dinner because I didn't have enough room left for dessert! I'll just have to go back and do the coffee and cheesecake!"
Luciane P.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/9/2012,"Last week, I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my husband and my daughter. It was a great experience. The place is very beautiful, and the waiters are very nice. We ordered a pepperoni pizza for us and a macaroni pizza for her (kids menu).  For dessert, we ordered a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. OMG! A huge piece of cake and so much chocolate!!!!! We've never ate so much chocolate in our whole life! I recommend this restaurant, especially for whom is looking for a good restaurant and for all the chocoholics too! Perfect."
Colby O.,"Escondido, CA",0,58,,3.0,10/19/2009,"If you want the best cheesecake of your life come here!  I come here quite often just for dessert because they have so many delectable choices for cheesecake!  My favorite of all time is the rasberry white chocolate cheesecake and the peanut butter chocolate cheesecake!  Seriously the cheesecake just melts in your mouth!  I wish I could describe just how good it is, oh maybe I can, it's like a little taste of heaven!  The best part is you can call for pick-up or just go inside and order cheesecake at the counter, they make it really simple!  However, the cheesecake may be the best I have ever had, but the food isn't all that great.  If it only served cheesecake I would give this restaurant a 5-star rating, but the other stuff it offers isn't that good.  For example, I had their chicken marsala and it was only average.  I have had better chicken marsala at family restaurants (sad I know).   But you have to keep in mind that it is a chain restaurant.  Their alcohol options are fairly good, but I think they water it down because I oculdn't taste the alchol in the pomegrante martini or the Typhoon Punch, and II definitely didn't feel it.  As far as the service you can expect much the same as other restaurants such as chile's, applebee's etc.   The ambiance here isn't anything too special but it's nice on the inside and out.  Although, it is not very clean and rumor has this palce has  C rating from the health department right now."
Erykah H.,"San Diego, CA",56,60,63,4.0,3/7/2011,i l.o.v.e the cheesecake factory.. not sure if it has to do with the fact that i am Pregnant! haha  i love pepperoni pizza! i can't ever finish it all..  the service is quick.. even when they are soo busy! the waiters are always super friendly and know every dish on the menu.  i usually get a Virgin Pina Colada when ever i go.. but last time.. i found a hair in my drink..yuck.. but the waiter took it away.. gave me a New one for Free!

Becca N.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,414,33,4.0,7/27/2011,Great Vietnamese tacos and greek salad. As always the cheese cake is awesome! We tried the Low Cal version made with splenda and fresh fruit. YUMMY!
Richard B.,"San Diego, CA",140,259,8,4.0,4/8/2008,"Sam the Heating Guy took my coworkers and I out for a reward lunch. I'm not too sure what it was we were being rewarded for, but I'm not in the business to question anyone willing to buy all of us an enormous lunch. We got there around 11:15am and there was no wait at all. We got seated fast and our drink orders were supplied quickly. Not very hard when everyone orders Coke, but it was still pretty impressive to have three waitresses place twelve full glasses on our table in five seconds. Sam ordered us two of the Appetizer Sampler plates... Insane. There's like five different appetizers on each plate. After trying one of each, I was pretty much ready to call it quits.  I had the Chicken Avocado Club... Delicious. It was slices of grilled sourdough bread stuffed with Swiss cheese, grilled chicken breast, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and an herb mayo. Along side the huge club was a generous portion of french fries. They reminded me of the kind you get from McDonald's, only not horrible.  I ate the whole sandwich and most of the fries. I started to get super full, and in desperate need of a nap. Ape, I really could've used an Ambien AD!  =) I didn't have room for cheesecake, but I've had it before and it's really good. But when you call yourself 'Cheesecake Factory' it better be good."
Leslie G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,19,6,2.0,10/7/2013,"I wonder what is happening to this place?  I have eaten here before, but not recently.  My hubby and I decided to try it again (he had a gift card).  We were there kinda early for dinner, so there was no dreaded wait, but, as I had just flown in from the bay area, I had to use the restroom as soon as we got there.  The ladies' room was gross.  I mean really bad.  The stall doors were broken, the sinks were dirty, there was no toilet paper in the stall, and even worse things I cannot write here.  I told the hostess about it (not like they were really busy at 5 PM, but I thought maybe they just hadn't gotten around to it yet).  We had drinks, we had appetizers, we had dinner and hung out an about an hour and  half later, as we were leaving for the movies, I stopped by the ladies' again, and SURPRISE it was still just as nasty as it was two hours before.  No one had been in there to clean.  Makes me wonder where the wait staff is going to wash up and how can they possibly be clean servers and kitchen staff when the bathrooms are so bad.  Yuk.  Ruined the whole dining experience for me.  I don't think I will go back to that restaurant anytime soon."
brigette l.,"San Diego, CA",318,110,,3.0,4/1/2008,"It was my Friends Birthday and we were shopping *crunk* and ended up here... I don't eat here just drink. My Friend was crunk and we stepped up to the bar, we got carded so we flung out ID's out and FLING there goes her ID and fling there goes mine.  She flung them across the bar, they wetted them down and served us.   whoooooaaaaaaa bracing to get kicked out at broad daylight.  They were totally cool they soaked em down and served us.  Hell yeah they have Belvedere here.   The bartenders are cool as hell, they served us with a smile and tried to pick her up.  aha.  I love you bartenders!  The showcase of their alcohol is BEAUTIMUS.  I gave the bottles a holla brigette shimmy with my ladies! Side note ladies... If Stephen brings you here pull the fire alarm and run!!!!!! HOLLA....  Still yet to eat and review..."
Ana M.,"San Diego, CA",98,243,309,4.0,10/20/2008,"I was surprisingly pleased with my experience here yesterday... Wine was good, although a bit overpriced but then again it is in Fashion Valley. We shared the calamari appt which was alright a bit over done, and finally was my entree which was good, but the name has got to change... Weight Management Grilled Chicken, whether or not I need to lose weight the name made me feel like I was on a diet. They could create a ""Light"" section to there menu, They already have about 10 sections what would be one more..."
Jeanna W.,"San Diego, CA",665,301,58,4.0,5/28/2008,"I stuffed my face with too much appetizer to enjoy the entree.  It's a good thing the waiter forgot to fire my order with the rest of my group's order.  Normally that would be a negative, but after two Long Island iced teas, the apps, and a bowl of baked potato soup, my pants were bursting at the seams!  Thank you, Tony, for making that mistake.  it made me a very happy camper. Speaking of Tony, our server, he was very helpful!  I threw him a few curve ball questions like I do to most anyone and he knocked them right out of the park with details and a smile.  What a guy. We were all hungry as heck.  There was a 30 minute wait. But once we ordered, everything came out in a jiffy.  Can you imagine how many darned chefs they have in the back to be able to make such a variety of cuisine?  Well, I asked.  15!  15 cooks cooking.  That's not even including the pastry chefs, the sous chefs, the head chefs, the manager and the GM!  Damn.  I could tell one of the bussers was in training, the way Tony spoke to her.  But that's okay.  She did just fine. hahah... whoever put ""none"" for alcohol is a moron.  All 18 of you.  They have a full bar right at the front that you can even sit at if you want. The patio area is very nice. Portion size is fantastic. With the four drinks, our bill was $185 for five people.  I highly recommend that if you go in a group of four or five people, you order the Sampler appetizer and then go straight to dessert."
Tanya S.,"Encinitas, CA",285,202,18,3.0,4/2/2008,Long wait. People waiting outside. People waiting inside.   Restaurant effing too loud and noisy. .....yup still waiting.  I'm not a big fan of food chain restaurants..... But OH DAAAANG the fried mac and cheese is insane!   This is on the appetizer list and it's big balls (ha ha I said balls) of mac and cheese covered in breadcrumbs and deep fried!  Served with a side of marinara.   I might go out on a limb and say this is worth the long lines and wait!  Order a grip of these and you will be most satisfied!
Matt K.,"San Diego, CA",120,137,4,1.0,5/19/2011,Lots of food. Decent price. Too bad the food is crap. Serious utter crap.
Melisa E.,"Encinitas, CA",36,2,,1.0,12/21/2013,I used to think this was an amazing place to go -  extensive menu and spectacular desserts plus drinks!  But tonight had skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta and the noodles were barely cooked. The ends of the pasta strands where stuck together and crunchy!  My daughter ordered kids pasta plate AND HER noodles were not cooked either!  I told the waiter who had manager come over - manager just shrugged and said he would send another plate.  No consideration that others at the table had finished their meals by the time I got a re-do and not even a reduction on the bill or piece of cheesecake gratis.  If a restaurant can't get pasta cooked right I am not interested in coming back.
Hollan M.,"San Diego, CA",821,232,89,5.0,6/5/2008,"Here's one more chain restaurant I'd like to give a HIGH-FIVE!!! If you are shopping at Fashion Valley, it is a great place to relax before your next shopping spree.  Or a great place to grab a bite to eat before a movie.  This is a great 'girls lunch' place.  Also, great for groups.  Kids seem to like it as well. I have never had a bad dish.  It is always high quality and consistent. The menu is huge ... almost too many choices.  And the ads are fun to look at, too.  The service is professional.  It's usually packed so be prepared to wait a little while for a table.  Check out what you'll have for dessert while you're waiting.  All the cheesecakes are on display in the waiting area.  The hardest thing to decide is between appetizers or dessert.  It's all sooo good!"
