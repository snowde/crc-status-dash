Cynthia T.,"Murrieta, CA",73,342,101,4.0,9/18/2008,"HUGE menu with alot of yummy ""comfort"" foods. Had the duo plate of scallions and salmon. It was $21 but was a gigantic plate that could of fed 3 people easily. Would recommend going for late lunch/early dinner because come dinner time this place is PACKED. You ll be waiting for quite some time. Also if you go when its not too busy you might be able to get a booth instead of being packed right next to other people who's table is literally 16inches away. My boyfriend and I requested a new seat after they tried to sit us practically on top of another couple.  Besides the cramp seating, VERY GOOD VERY CLEAN and good service."
Amy S.,"San Diego, CA",574,897,101,4.0,5/1/2008,"I really liked this place! I sense a common theme in my reviews that I am a sucker for ambiance, and well, Cheesecake Factory has it all! I loved how the booths were large but comfortable with a touch of fancy. At first I thought I was going to be under-dressed in a faded Hot Water Music jacket and jeans that somehow are still held together, but to my surprise, no one turned to stare at me as I had expected. There is a nice mix of looking nice and just ""coming in off the street"" here when it comes to how people dress which is always good. Places that don't have a balance I do not appreciate.  The service was really good and the pre-meal basket of bread they bring out is to die for :) Unlimited ""refills"" :) Score! Oh, and the coffee was AMAZING! Due to the fact I was short on cash, I went with their basic salad, which was alright, nothing too fancy but it could have been a little ""crunchier"" and the ""side of ranch"" they brought out was a joke considering the salad to dressing ratio was waaaaaaaaaay off. This frustrated me.  The wall of cheesecake in the bakery display cases was enough to make any sweet-lover go into sugary heaven. Oh it looked good!  I defiantly will come back here again. This is a great mix of swanky meets relaxed: a nice spot for a date perhaps?"
Not H.,"San Diego, CA",73,101,71,2.0,6/1/2008,"Food -ok. Service - Never anything outstanding, fair-average *Great Cheescake!!! Wonderful selection and yummy I've been here for dinner and lunch...all times I find the food just alright...nothing to rave about. Save your money and dine elsewhere...come here to pick up some fancy, tasty cheescake if you're hankering for it. My family and I have been more satisfied after eating at CPK =)"
Eduard R.,"National City, CA",10,5,2,1.0,8/18/2011,"This a nice place, but it doesn't suit my needs. Its too expensive for me and the waiters keep taking my bread. I know its free and refillable but shit dude you don't have to take it YET. Just cause my order, by the way i ordered something called a Chicken Fart-fallie, came its doesn't mean you can take my FREAKIN bread! Im a Filipino and its a habit of me asking for a refill even though it isn't full just because i want to take it home. Yes the bread is fuming good. i would come here and not order anything but bread. to end this review, i'd like to say is that i like to tip nice waiters (NOT JENNIFER) but if your expecting a tip from me, it will either be coing=s or a dollar, cause shit dude like i just paid $40 for 2 meals, you won't expect a high tip from me. Peace :)"
Allison T.,"Vallejo, CA",34,117,4,3.0,9/22/2008,"It's hard to separate a restaurant's overall quality with one mediocre expereince... That being said, the only really great thing I can say about the Cheesecake Factory is their desserts are fantastic and their cocktails (the strawberry martini and the pommegranite mojito) quite delightful. That's what gave the review the third star instead of just two. This particular restaurant is always super crowded that the wait is about an hour unless you want to wrestle someone for a table at the bar. I wouldn't mind waiting if the food was better. Trying to stay on the healthy side, I ordered the portabello sandwich with a side of spinach instead of fries. The spinach was DRENCHED in oil and the sandwich was super greasy. Sadness. I have definitely experienced better food cheaper.  What really did not make me happy was our server. Very nice girl. However, when it came time for our check, my friend put in a $20 and I was going to put the rest on my card. The receipt came back with the entire bill on my card. I call the server over to inquire and her claim was that there was no $20. We, for the life of us, could not figure out what happened to a $20 that was so clearly inserted into the checkbook in the 10 feet between our table and the register. We searched around but it was not to be found (you can make your own conclusions) and we weren't about to pay another $20. She was nice enough to re-charge my card the appropriate amount but it took two weeks and a phone call before the original bill was taken off the card (my card was double-charged).  I just don't know. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to just a flukey experience..."
Arielle C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/1/2013,The red velvet cheesecake is a dream. Share it with 3 others and you're good to go for dessert.
Captain J.,"San Diego, CA",82,92,3,5.0,9/25/2008,"I like this place, its always clean and green with a lot of plants, food is always good and reasonable prices.  Service is always good (past 10 visits). Mehdi the manager is a great guy if you get to meet him, friendly and polite and very hospitable. What else can anybody want from restaurant.  Great job guys :-)"
Sal J.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,18,1.0,11/17/2013,"Ok so, today 11/17/2013 Sunday we went to this location for Lunch. We arrived at 12:50pm and we were told by the manager who was not humble nor professional that the wait time is 45 minutes.  As we all know this location is always busy so some one with good common sense would understand that and would wanna wait. By the way, we brought our children and elders with us to dine here. After waiting for more than an hour and almost loosing my appetite i thought i should speak to a manager. So after a few minutes the manager(Josh) came out and i respectfully told him that we have been waiting for more than an hour, thus, after checking into the matter he came back and said the people just got their check and they should leave soon and there is nothing a can do. Really Josh????? there is nothing you can do! how about a sincere apology and taking care of your customer who dropped $285.33  I have no idea if their upper management is checking on these managers who will run down their business. I am really disappointed. Their upper management need to know that people have options to go to other places. We are regulars at both cheese cake and BJs. I tell you Bjs by far have better service than this location of cheese cake factory. I guess because they are always really busy, they don't really care if people go to their restaurant or not.  So, upper management of cheese cake factory, shame on you that you are unaware of unprofessional managers. I will not return to this location, i rather give my business to other restaurants who care and take good care of their customers."
Calvin D.,"Corona, CA",100,211,13,4.0,9/2/2008,"Cheesecake factory is delicious!   The long ass wait sucks... The service is OK... The prices are OK... But the food is awesome! But i think there is too much cheesecake factory hype... oh wells! So overall, if you don't mind waiting between 30minutes to an hour before being seating and probably another 30-45 minutes before actually being fed, then this place is for you!!!"
Lindsey B.,"Moncks Corner, SC",0,27,1,5.0,11/15/2011,I have never been disappointed here! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! :DDD
Esgar L.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,110,42,3.0,4/2/2011,"I ordered the reese's peanut butter cup cheese cake, and they gave me the snickers one instead, and the top was kind of smooshed.  The next day I ate my leftovers, and found some of my friend's dish in my leftovers, which means they used the SAME UTENSILS, which isn't very sanitary. The waitress/waiters were friendly though and always smiled.  Restaurant is big and nice!"
George H.,"San Diego, CA",24,41,,5.0,7/22/2008,"I have a feeling that the poor reviews are influenced by the WAIT for a table. I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory that had easy walk-in availability, this place included. By the time your are seated you are hungry for breakfast instead of dinner. That said, the food is great. The menu is so extensive you can eat many times and never touch the same item or type of food. Always enjoyable and good service. Then again, that WAIT. That is solved simply (most of the time) by eating at the bar which has full dinner service without having to check in and WAIT (bar staff is friendly and attentive even providing dinner service and bar service to the entire restaurant). The only time I had a bad experience (they burned steak or whatever), they replace the item, apologized and comp'd the whole meal for myself and guests (without being asked). Food portions are ample, and with a little planning, lunch can be covered for a few days. Appetizers are great. No complaints. Ironically, we are usually to full for the cheesecake."
Lindsay H.,"San Diego, CA",186,293,35,4.0,3/3/2011,"This is a great place to bring a large group because their menu has soooooooo much selection that they're bound to have something for every picky palate. They have lots of tasty pastas and entrees and their cheesecakes are quite good too. Nothing is OUT OF THIS WORLD, but I've never had anything downright nasty either. 4 stars for convenience!"
James M.,"San Diego, CA",48,3,,1.0,10/24/2013,"I have never eaten at Cheesecake Factory. Started off with mini crab cake appetizer, served with lemon and mayonnaise?. I ordered a pit beef sandwich, my girl ordered chipotle chicken pasta. My sandwich came out on a roll that was pretty much burnt. I had to soak the sandwich in au-jus to try to eat it. Finally just ate the meat (which was sliced thick and really chewy and fatty). The pasta dish.. The chicken and veggies were good but the pasta was stuck together and a little undercooked. Upon leaving bought a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. $8.00 Thought it would be good. Tasted like a pumpkin pie. Not a cheesecake. More like a mouse. I can say the service was very good which is why they get the 1 star I give them. My friend bought me a gift card and thought I would like the food. I am actually glad I did not pay too much. Still left the server $13 on a $ 64 bill. She was nice. Do not remember her name. I think Cara or something like that. I did not say a thing about the food there. I will never return to a cheesecake factory."
Samie H.,"San Diego, CA",19,13,,4.0,8/23/2013,"really like that Restaurant , the menu is very big and you can find any kind of food style you want!  and great quality."
Mike D.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,53,33,1.0,5/29/2008,"Went on May 18th. Service was slow and had to wait for our food because our waitress went on break, so the new one probably forgot about us. After the meal, I got my bill  $60.61.  Service was far from good, so I left a tip of $7.39 (about 12%) to make a total of $68.00. Checked my credit card statement today and saw that my new total was $72.61. This was not a pending charge, it has posted.  I guess she was upset with the 12% tip and just added $12.00 (20%). I am calling the manager tomorrow to get this straight. Good thing I still have my receipt.  I will edit this post with the outcome... Here is the outcome: Went back in and the manager gave me an excuse that they must have entered the wrong tip for the wrong bill. But then he said that the original transaction was voided and then reentered. He offered me a free burger. I said no thanks. Got a refund foir the over charged portion. Still waiting to see it on my credit card statment."
Teresa T.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/15/2013,We are first time parents with a young toddler and figured we would take a chance to take him out to eat with us as a family. We tried Cheescake Factory at Fashion Valley Mall and it was a great experience! When we were being seated they immediately asked if we would like a high chair and provided it quickly. They also provided complimentary fresh banana slices and warm breads peices for our little boy while we waited for our food! Great family outing!
Carolyn S.,"Carlsbad, CA",982,401,10,3.0,1/3/2008,For what it is....upper end cafe....about the ilk of TGIF...but a bit nicer. Three stars. Here's my reasoning: The Cheesecake Factory is a hit for Fashion Valley...but the set up architecturally causes women and girls to exit the restroom into a rather quick moving and blind walkway...a walkway waiters are often taking at break neck speed. A collision with a hot coffee pot...just waiting to happen. The menu has good variety...but they would do well to offer a couple of healthier alternatives.  The entry way floor can sometimes be slick...it's tile...sometimes wet tile. Another accident in the making. The wait can be an hour or even more. Service...hmmmmm....I have yet to be impressed. The place comes across to me as too corporate and just too cold. This one is lacking the oceany elegance of the one in Santa Monica.
Lisa H.,"San Diego, CA",72,103,17,4.0,6/19/2010,"I come here with my friend sometimes before going to a movie at Fashion Valley Mall. We like it because it generally has everything on the menu and the food is pretty darn good. The only drawbacks are the long lines and the knowledge that what you eat will generally supply you with your daily calorie intake for several days. I love their pasta selections, and they are so thick and creamy! If you decide you want to go on a hunger strike, come here first and bulk up. But honestly, the food tastes great, it's a chain, but they've done a great job. And their cheesecake ain't bad either. I had to throw that in there - this being a cheesecake factory and all."
Nacho C.,"San Diego, CA",523,181,,3.0,11/1/2007,3 stars because that's how many of their Maytag martinis it takes for me to start feeling loopy.... Lines are always too long so I just drink there and try to shop after.  It never really works out. Parking reminds of SDSU in the 90's.
