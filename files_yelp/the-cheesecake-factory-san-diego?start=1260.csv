Kim M.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/24/2014,"Okay, the first time I went I had a horrible experience so I waited 7 months to try again. We drove on a Friday night in rush hour traffic to have dinner. Waited 1 hour wait. Drinks were slow but it was busy. Food was great, server was good. Then my daughter had to go to the bathroom, so I put our check on top of our boxed food. Waiting still on my to go cheese cake and took her to the bathroom. We were right outside the bathroom. When I came out our table was cleared, food and drinks gone. I was so mad. Not only did I not finish my drink, but I wasn't ready to leave. They said let me find your food and handed me my check. They had thrown the food away and gave it to me out of the trash, the reason I knew that is the box was all greasy so I ended up throwing it away.My bill was over $100.00 and  I didn't get my left overs, didn't get to finish my cocktail and my cheesecake to go was turned upside down and a mess. They had my number on file since I gave it to them to be seated, not even a call to apologize for the experience. The manager did come over and say she was sorry but a little late for that. No more chances. I will not go anymore. Two times, bad experience and expensive. The location was Escondido at the Mall."
Jan C.,"San Diego, CA",0,54,,2.0,10/4/2013,"Beware gluten free menu.  If you are also corn intollerant, you can't have their bread, very little option, thank goodness they were still serving breakfast omelettes, so that was the only safe option.  It is also a very noisy place, especially with tired crying children at lunchtime."
Fiona T.,"San Diego, CA",157,316,50,3.0,6/10/2008,"I don't know why people are so jibby about this place, it's not that great. Horrible for big dinners. I like the cheesecake/desserts because if they had horrible cheesecake, that would defeat the purpose of this place. It's something to have atleast once in your LIFETIME. I wouldn't come here again. It's just like all those other places...CPK is BETTER. DITTTO!!!*"
Christine C.,"San Diego, CA",412,591,,3.0,12/31/2006,"Whenever I go to the fashion valley mall with the fam, we always dine on the Cheesecake Factory. It is one of those restaurants that everyone seems to agree on because the menu is so extensive, but I'm almost never happy with what I order.  Maybe it is because deciding what to order here such a headache. For a while I was consistently ordering the veggie omelet, but now I'm on the fence with almost everything decision, but that is probably because I have yet to have a meal here that is extraordinary. I like how there are a lot of options on the menu, but I think the food is ho-hum.  I consider myself a sort of cheesecake connoisseur and you know what? I don't like the cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  I think it is too sweet and all most of the flavors, like the snicker's cheesecake, are too overindulgent.  Oh yeah, there's always a freakin' wait at the Cheesecake Factory! But I will continue to dine here because the fam likes it and I will probably continue to be disappointed by the food."
Stephen W.,"San Diego, CA",18,131,,4.0,7/22/2008,"Busy, crowded.. in fact, way too crowded for what it is.  But really, I do enjoy the food here enough to give it a nice rating. Service can be lacking.  Parking can be painful.  Waiting to get seated takes a long ass time. Go between lunch & dinner.  Works out better."
Pio P.,"La Jolla, CA",23,36,,1.0,11/10/2012,bad meal! uncaring management!  we had been eating at a Cheese Cake factory in LA long before they opened in SD.......we used to eat at cheesecake factory  here in san diego at least once a week....... we often met friends there we got a  salad one day which was not correctly  made..... told the waitress and she made all kinds of excuses....... she did not replace the salad..... we told a manager and he did not have the time to deal with customers as he was very busy chatting up  a pretty young waitress........   took the time to write a letter to the head of the company and never heard a word back..... nobody seems to care if things are not correct!!! we have not eaten there in over a year and have had plenty of excellent food and service elsewhere!!!! check the lines at True Foods! great quality there!!
Chade m.,"San Diego, CA",75,75,3,3.0,7/28/2010,"I have yet to find a black tie mousse cheesecakes as good as the one at Cheese Cake Factory. As for the food, it was just ok.  The décor is very elegant and divine. Our hostess and our waiter was very friendly and welcoming. I most likely will be back for the cheese cake."
Mark K.,"Temecula, CA",95,299,200,4.0,1/22/2011,"Consistently good food, and consistently long waits.  Get there early, unless you like to wait."
James W.,"San Diego, CA",13,54,3,4.0,5/2/2013,"probably the same as every other CKF but i always enjoy what ever i order from here. its usually busy but the 20-30 min wait usually ends up being more like 10-15. always have lunch for the next day because you get so much food. good selection of beers as well, one of the few places in town who carry my person fav, New Castle Brown Ale."
Matt H.,"New York, NY",31,41,7,4.0,3/31/2008,"I enjoy going here for the avocado egg rolls, the luau salad (this is definitely the most amazing salad I've ever tasted), chicken madeira, cajun jambalaya pasta, and of course, cheesecake.  I've tried a lot of the menu, and most of the other stuff is pretty blah.  I don't understand how some people-cough my friends-like to eat chicken taquitos or fish tacos at Cheesecake Factory.  To each customer their own, I guess. Here's a list of CF pros and cons: Pros:  +It's massive and loud, so if you're stuck on an awkward date or with a group of boring people, it will seem less awkward.  BTW, I just realized how awkward the word awkward looks.   +You get a nice chunky transponder dongle so you can go shopping while you wait for your table.  (one of the hostesses told me it only works directly outside of the restaurant, but I think she's either stupid or lying, 'cause its worked for me farther away) +The bread is decent and generously portioned +Lots and lots of cheesecake +Cheesecakes come with enormous blasts of whipped cream, which is way too much to eat.  It's actually more useful for flinging at people when you're bored by the people around you.  Trust me on this. +The heat lamps outside are seriously intense. Cons:  -It's massive and loud.  Hard to hear conversations and find the bathroom. -The entrance and most of the restaurant is usually crammed with people waiting for tables.  Hard to get through and hard to admire all the cheesecakes. -Service is flaky.  Some of the servers are really nice and hilarious, while others treat their customers like they are five and can't hear what you are ordering. -Long wait times that are often inaccurate.  I had my birthday here with 5 friends, and we were quoted for 2 hours.  We ended up getting a table after 30 minutes.  Another time, I was with a group of 8 and the wait time was 30-45 minutes, and we ended up waiting over an hour. -Random ads in the menu (why would anyone want to advertise pants in a restaurant menu?) make it even longer and harder to read through."
Rishi D.,"San Diego, CA",26,62,,1.0,9/24/2007,"Allow me to give you my history at this place and overall experiences before I dive into my story.  I've been to the Cheesecake factory in Palm Springs, Charlotte NC and a couple times in Fashion Valley.  While the breakfast is nothing to write home about (as SD has numerous outstanding breakfast joints), I've had the pleasure in indulge in their lunches (not too bad) and dinners (okay).  The only saving grace would be the cheesecakes and customer service or so I thought. This past Friday on Sept. 21st, me and a group of 3 walked in around 9:45-10PM after seeing a movie just to get a drink and a quick bite to eat from the appetizers. I didn't want to burden the kitchen knowing it was near closing time so I thought this would be easy and quick.  Apparently this is where the trouble began.   I ordered the Fried Salmon Rolls, someone else ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with Caesar salad, and the other couple ordered a spirit water.   Our waiter came by twice, then disappeared.  OVER ONE HOUR LATER (we looked at hour watches 11:10PM) we decided to flag down another waiter and ask what the hold up was on our food.  Apparently there was a transition change and they dropped the ball. They informed me that our food was never put in.  I told them I was ready to walk and forget it.  The delightful manager on hand, Joey, informed us everything would be taken care of.  So we waited..... Lo and behold our food arrived.  Amazingly they screwed up this too! The Grilled Cheese sandwich was halfway done, with some of the cheese not even melting through.  The Caesar salad was soggy and my fried salmon was tepid at best (I developed a stomach ache over the weekend from it).  We ordered them to fix the sandwich, which came back soggy and not even cooked well. After the second time, I said forget it.  HOW DO YOU MESS UP A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH?!?!? A 6 yr-old can make one better than what they offered.  Someone must have been smoking back there for sure.  It's bad enough to be forgotten, but messing up the order twice more just made it worse. Another manager came out and apologized profusely (Tom). The only redeeming quality was the free cheesecakes given to us.   Salvaged a little bit of an otherwise horrendous experience.  I can't really recommend this place to anyone who waits for over an hour to eat here.  I have to agree with some other reviewers in that the food is overrated.   I may be a pescatarian, so I can't comment on the chicken and beef plates. But if they can mess up their grill cheese, salads, and fish dishes how can I give it a higher rating for their other items? If I go again it will be with hesitation.  I never reviewed a restaurant this low, but this really needed to be yelped!  Spend money elsewhere unless you want cheesecake."
Wendy R.,"Encinitas, CA",4,286,,5.0,2/9/2011,"I love their Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, Navajo and Linda's Fudge Cake"
Ronni B.,"Ridgefield, WA",0,14,,1.0,6/13/2011,"Service was awful and all we wanted was a piece of cheesecake!  I got run over multiple times by staff, and watched them count tips rather than help guests. We waited over twenty minutes for dessert. Really?  Tried to contact management because when we got our order the ten dollar piece of cake was upside down in the bag! Management declined to take my call. (Put on hold and left there for over ten minutes.) Next time, i'll choose the other cheesecake place in town."
angie k.,"San Diego, CA",32,150,5,3.0,4/21/2008,"Hostesses are sooo snobby and rude!  Especially the one that looks like Miss Piggy.  Rude Rude Rude. The food is super oily and gives me a stomach ache EVERY TIME.  Only reason I eat here is because my best friend works here, and now that she has moved, i am over it.   Won't be back."
Mai B.,"San Diego, CA",3,116,7,4.0,9/25/2007,"I just had dinner there tonight.  I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.  I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp & Chicken which was good.  My sis had the Cuban sandwich, which didn't taste authentic - more like a ham & swiss sandwich, & my mom had the Mediterranenan Mahi Mahi.  The Mahi Mahi was kind of weird, where the mashed potatoes was on the bottom, then they put the fish on top & covered it with a bunch of salsa.  So, it was hard to taste the fish without some mashed potatoes or salsa attached to it.  My mom thought it was okay - nothing special.  We also had a slice of the Adam Ripple cheesecake, which was good & the strawberry shortcake, which I thought was ok - nothing to write home about. Pros:   - Extensive menu: they have everything from Mexican to Asian to traditional American.  There's something for everyone, which is great 'cause my sister loves standard American fare, I love spicy food, and my mom live seafood.              - Great drink list              - Great desserts, of course! CONS:  THE WAIT!  The wait for a table is ridiculous sometimes, but you just have to grin & bear it if you want to eat here.  I expect to wait a while for a table, but once I get a table I was hoping for the service to be quicker than it was.  I only saw my waiter 2 times - once when he took my order, another time when he gave me my bill.  Other than that, I never saw him.  My water was never refilled.  I didn't want to wait for my change so he was left a good tip.  I just couldn't sit there any longer.  I know why there's such a long wait for a table - 'cause the service inside is so slow."
Kristen M.,"San Diego, CA",168,436,6,2.0,9/14/2007,"Totally overrated as a restaurant!  The cheesecake is really good, they make a really strong mojito and the portions are HUGE.  Those are the only good things I can say about TCF. The food isn't bad, but it isn't especially good.  They do have a very extensive menu, but every time I go, I get something new and have yet to be impressed.  The wait staff is usually very friendly and helpful, but the hostesses are snobby, in my experience.   It's always insanely crowded, unless you catch a fluke.  They are usually in malls, which makes overcrowding worse.  It just reminds me of the depressing aspects of suburbia; there's always some middle class mom decked out in designer duds with her 3 undisciplined kids running around.   I'd rather go to Yardhouse any day."
Julie G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/20/2013,I eat there all the time and have never had a bad dinner yet.  Food is absolutely fantistic !! always
Glen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,,3.0,8/28/2008,"I've eaten at several Cheesecake Factory locations and this one is by far the most inconsistent of them all.   You can still get good food here but sometimes the Cajun Jambalaya is way too spicy and sometimes it hardly has any kick.   No, I didn't piss off the cook...ha ha.   I've had some really good meals here but it only gets 3 stars because of the disappointments here.      The atomsphere is busy and lively and the service is good."
Aria A.,"San Diego, CA",45,62,3,4.0,2/8/2011,Love the ambiance and fried avocado rolls. Fried avocado rolls and their meatloaf as well.  I love their passion fruit ice tea.
John U.,"San Diego, CA",6,49,8,3.0,4/25/2010,This is my spot after 10 pm most nights. The menu has good variety and the quality of the food is good and for the most part reliable. A little pricey however I enjoy eating at the bar because the bar tenders are the best.     I've had better cheesecake.  Id prefer a smaller denser cheesecake over the airy larger serving you get here.   The Carne Asada is excellent but the beef dishes otherwise are hit or miss unless you request well done.  Try the lettuce wraps.  The selection of wines is pretty good and the bartenders are good at making sure you enjoy your selection.  Mind you i eat after 10pm.  Ive seen this place before 10.  6 deep at the bar.  No thanks.
