Michael D.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",6,4,,1.0,5/10/2013,"I'm only giving it a one because I can't give it a zero. Where to begin? We went here for my mother-in-law's birthday. Despite informing the staff of the event, no action was taken to make the night special. My sister's plate was grabbed by another waitress, forcing her to wait another 10 minutes while they cooked her another. Despite talking to the manager about the mistake, no actions were taken to make the situation better. We were promised a free slice of cheesecake to make up for it, but it never came. We had a party of seven and despite advertising that they can accommodate parties up to 40, we were stuck at a booth that seated 6 and simply placed a chair at the end of the table in the pathway for our other member to sit in. The waiter we had was quite snooty with us, and did not pay very much attention to our requests. One such instance was the splitting of the checks. He had to come back to us to re-split it twice. A mandatory gratuity charge of 18% is automatically added to the check for parties of six or larger, which seemed a little unusual considering most restaurants force gratuity with parties of eight or more. Most of our party paid with their bank cards while I chose to pay in cash. We never received our receipt, nor the change from our payment, which was very unsettling for myself and my wife considering that the tip had already been taken out of the check. No receipt and they stole our change on top of that. It was only a few cents, but still, it was stealing. We enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but from now on we will be going to the one in otay lakes, and will never be going back to the fashion valley restaurant."

Megan R.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,3.0,5/10/2011,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory location for 2 1/2 years now. I usually get the tomato basil pasta (on the special menu) and a slice of the red velvet cheesecake which is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! Last time I went to the Cheesecake Factory, I did not enjoy my experience :(  The bread we were served was hard as a rock. and the butter looked as if the had been out on many tables that night, as well as in a baby's mouth. The little foil butters actually had teeth marks in them....gross. My tomato basil pasta noodles were literally swimming in oil, and my friends pasta was dry, and crusty, like it had been sitting out. Immediately after it was served we told the waiter about the pasta, and  he said ""you just need to mix it up more"". NO. the pasta was dry and crusty like it had been sitting out for HOURS. Then the manager came over and apologized. He offered to bring a new one, but at that time The rest of our group was more than 1/2 way done with our meal.  The bathrooms needed some cleaning as well.  Even though this was a bad experience. I will still give it 3 stars and will continue to  go back. Most of the time I love this place!!! That was just a very disappointing experience."
Tinh T.,"San Diego, CA",255,86,234,4.0,12/2/2010,Food here is great on the selection little bit pricey but decent...also I'm a fan of cheesecake and they have all types cheesecakes here..Good customer service..variety of food and they have a sport bar which kept me entertain!!
Manny N.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2013,The rice was hard. Extra spicy = extra sweet. Chicken was undercooked. Orders took forever. 18% gratuity is absolutely ridiculous in a culture where 15% is standard. The atmosphere is ok but everything else is subpar.
Jennifer M.,"San Diego, CA",331,168,10,1.0,10/8/2007,"O bother. Let me tell you a story about how a bad server can ruin a good restaurant.   A beautiful evening in San Diego, CA two friends and I decide to go out to a nice dinner.  We start at PF Changs, and end up walking over to CCF bc we weren't in the mood for asian.   Our Drinks at the bar, good.  But very very slow to come out.  It was happy hour; however, it was only 6pm and not so much busy.   Then we meet Angel.  O boy o boy o boy.  I almost felt bad for her as I am a server myself.   When I eat out it is the simple little things that make my dining experience great.  ""anticipating the guests needs""  well, Angel didn't have a clue. Poor girl.    Well, needless to say, the food was good.  Maybe I should give them another star, because I will go back.  I love the cheese cake, and I know the right items to order.  I also know how a restaurant works, and maybe next time I will request a table in the front of the restaurant where the more experienced servers are working. Not many people know this, but the newer and less experienced servers always work in the back and move their way up the chain of command.  LoL.   Our food took a really really really long time to come out.  So long that I wouldn't be surprised if our order didn't go into until 10 or 15 minutes after we ordered it. Our drinks came out wrong.  We were ignored the entire time we ate. The tables surrounding us were covered in dirty dishes and plates. Booh Hooh Cheesecake Factory.  This was my first time eating at this location.   I enjoyed myself at the San Francisco location, so maybe the next time I eat here I will have better luck.   I wish servers weren't a matter of luck, but with all things there are good and bad.  I know as a server I have my days, so maybe I should lay off."
Elijah S.,"San Diego, CA",1,2,,4.0,6/23/2013,"The food is great, the music is great, and the service is great. But the reason why I gave this place 4-stars is because their decor looks cheap. This is a great place, but they really have to improve on their decor, sorry."
Jenny J.,"Santee, CA",13,12,7,4.0,6/14/2011,"Love this place, causes this is the only one in San Diego that we are close too! Try to go on the weekdays or Sunday, very crowded on Saturday nights. We love their steaks, like steak Diane with grilled salmon. I also like there bow-tie pasta or their salads. Try not to eat too much so you could have room for cheesecake/dessert! Yummy! =9"
Roger T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",6,16,,1.0,4/23/2008,"To sum it up:  F for the food.  B for ambiance/decor. D for service. The wait I can handle, if the food is good.  But the food is poorly prepared--bad technique, not made with care, way too oily, and totally overpriced. I love cheesecake just like any other person, but to pay $7-8 for a meager serving and what looks like a pint of whipped cream is just ridiculous.  Especially at a casual restaurant like this. This place is a ripoff.  Over-rated, over priced, and definitely not worth the wait.  You are better off doing some research and booking a table at another restaurant.  Seriously, anywhere else would be better than The Cheesecake Factory.  As for people who rate this chain above three stars...well...y'all need to get out there and try eating real food.  No offense.  Just a suggestion. One star is given because I truly am very impressed that these guys are still in business."
Nicholas H.,"La Mesa, CA",8,78,14,3.0,12/8/2009,"i wanna write down about my recent discovery here, chicken bellagio is actually a pretty good substitute for my usual shrimp bistro pasta for about 3 dollars less price tag. the only catch here is you definitely will ask for extra sauce on the side. and the server will bring you pesto and cream sauce. so you gotta add some of the pesto to to the cream sauce, mix it, then pour to the pasta & chicken. i know that this is a really common knowledge but turns out not every one knows about it. especially someone who sat next to my table, she poured the pesto and cream separately and complained that the food doesn't taste good. duhhhh"
Chris W.,"Escondido, CA",52,5,,4.0,6/7/2011,"Update,  Ive been to the cheese cake factory two time since,  My first review was over a visit when everything went right,  Their food the other two times was not as good, but still up their,  Im still gonna give it 4 stars but not with the excitment as last time."
Julie G.,"Alameda, CA",693,536,1122,3.0,12/31/2006,"The one thing I do not particularly care for when I happen to visit this chain is the fact that their staff are over-trained robots. This becomes very annoying when they have to visit your table according to a time clock. There is just so many times that I want to be interrupted by my wait-staff person. The two-minute rule doesn't always work either. Some people need a bit more time but the managers are usually so stressed in these chain restaurants to perform and please every freakin customer every time that no one is relaxed and this makes me very nervous.  On a lighter note, I do like their fried coconut shrimp appetizers and their Greek Salad as they include beets in the mix."
Jen T.,"San Diego, CA",229,310,8,2.0,6/25/2007,"I cant figure out why this place is always crowded. Everytime I have eaten here, the food is subpar.  Twice when my food came out, it was cold. Believe me, i would have taken room temperature, but it was actually cold. Now if it had been a salad or dessert, cold is fine. Cold is not fine for roasted chicken tho. It didnt even seem cooked all the way.  I dont really like cheesecake so I couldnt comment on that, but boy do they have a large selection. And the slices are huge. Gorge on one of these slices and you will be in the gym for a month burning this off. So not worth coming here. Why 2 stars then? Well, for the extensive cheesecake selection, tho it is called the Cheesecake Factory."
Melissa S.,"Severna Park, MD",0,45,,4.0,3/31/2011,"Food was good, service was better. Sat outside on heated patio in the cold rain and did not get wet or cold. Waitstaff was very accommodating. And don't forget the CHEESECAKE!!"
Minji C.,"Elk Grove, CA",42,58,6,5.0,9/26/2010,This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. The service is great and the food is always delicious. Sometimes I got orders to go and then found that the food wasn't what I'd asked for but one phone call was all it took to get it squared away.
eris a.,"San Diego, CA",217,107,,3.0,4/28/2010,"ok, they get one more star this time. i just re-read my original review and had forgotten how upset i was about them not letting me and my puppy in, but i'm not rating them on that same experience.  this time (which was last night), i went to bing crosby's across from cheesecake factory to celebrate my birthday (yes, this is the final celebration of the ongoing past celebrations).  there was a total of 5 of us (4 adults and 1 baby).  we sat in the lounge at bing crosby's and just felt that it was too stuffy and over priced for the occasion so i decided to run over to cheesecake factory to see how long the wait was.  surprisingly, there was NO wait and no line even amidst the major dinner hour.  with that, my party and i decided to dine at cheesecake instead. service was very friendly and helpful with the drink menu, but she was just a tad bit slow on her game.  it was pretty packed in there so i can understand that, but i really hate having to get up and ask for refills, or more napkins, or for the check at the end of the meal.  regardless, i can't discredit her being kind. i had the jambalaya pasta and WOW.  that is an amazing pasta dish.  i've only recently become a fan of jambalaya this past year or so and the twist on this dish, serving it with linguini instead of rice is a GREAT idea.  i couldn't believe how delicious the chicken was prepared.  big, thick chunks of white meat chicken, average sized shrimp and sausage slices, and chunky tomatoes too.  all sitting on top a bed of linguini doused in a light and spicy sauce.  i'm a fan of this dish. now, if only their service could improve just a tad bit, i might be inclined to rate them even higher next time.  we'll see about that."
Kat R.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",0,39,,1.0,1/29/2013,"Bad service, worse food. Asked for a wheat bun with turkey burger...received an inedible, greasy piece of wheat toast. Expensive for crap food. Don't waste your money."
Eric L.,"San Francisco, CA",19,21,,4.0,1/14/2007,"One of the few places I will eat in at Fashion Valley.  Hell, I think I've gone to Fashion Valley just so I can enjoy Cheesecake Factory... The delicious White Chocolate Truffle Raspberry Cheesecake that always, and I mean ALWAYS, seems to push its way into my belly even after eating appetizers, entire main course, and the surprisingly delectable Georgia Peach drink (like biting into a real Peach!... until the alcohol hits you). There wasn't a time where I did not have to wait awhile for a seat.  I have not yet sat inside yet so I do not know or care about the atmosphere there.  It's all about outside seating, with gaslamps overhead.  The servers are mostly blonde and non-personable. If you want to eat something healthy, get the Herb-Crusted Salmon Salad (delicious).  Many friends love the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  Steaks are decent.  Hamburgers always seem to be cooked past its prime. Overall, it's vast selection of American and semi-fusion food seems appealing for all types of palates.  If not, then there is nothing Crown-on-the-rocks won't convince..."
Marissa S.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,5/11/2011,"Baked potato soup night!!!!!! Wednesday night's they have baked potato soup...and it is amazing. We only go there on Wednesday nights, not very often as Cheesecake Factory can get pricey, but when we do go it's on a Wednesday. Service is always really great and the people working there are kind :)"
Derrick B.,"San Diego, CA",97,103,16,4.0,8/15/2008,"I dunno where all these neg reviews come from?..I came here the other day for lunch and although it was packed,  me and a friend were seated immediately on the patio. The waitress was quick with our drinks. she came back out about 5 min after our drinks to take our order and our food came out in about 20 min.  I had the grilled shrimp and bacon sandwich with fries. It was probably one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. I normally dont take food home because i never eat it , but i only finished half of the sandwich and it was so good i took it home only to have it stolen by family scavengers!... although i didn't try the cheesecake , i definitely will the next time i come, which will be very soon"
