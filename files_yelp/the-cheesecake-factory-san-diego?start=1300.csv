Tina H.,"Lemon Grove, CA",1,14,5,3.0,2/25/2009,"I thought I use to absolutely love this place for it's Chinese chicken salad, but now I'm having second thoughts.  Just got back from having dinner here and wasn't to impressed with the salad.  It was drenched in dressing which is really tasty, but tonight it was just a little  much.  It also had way too many crispy noodle things on top.  It was like I was eating a crispy noodle salad, minus the salad. I guess I just need to try one of the other 1,000 things they have on their menu.  Service=A+ also we sat on the patio which was really nice. PROS: -service (really good) -bread (especially the dark brown bread) -lots of choices -deep fried artichoke hearts (yum, I think they are new) CONS: -crowded on weekends!! -hard to park (even tonight which is a Wed. night) -crab wonton appetizer (YUCK) -salad too drenched in dressing (sad because the other 2 times it was YUM!) In conclusion I will go here again but I will definitely try something different...the menu is about 10 pages long so plenty more to choose from."
DM C.,"San Diego, CA",6,60,,1.0,4/21/2011,It used to be so great before the original  guys  sold to the corporate folks.   They have increased  profit margins  my reducing the  food cost.  Low quality   short  sightedness
Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,4.0,3/9/2008,It never ceases to amaze me how huge CF restaurants are and yet how intensely long the wait always is.  My friend and I put our names in/got a buzzer and then went back to her house to pick up my luggage (my flight was after dinner).  By the time we got back there was still a 20 minute wait so we did some shopping and then the buzzer went off.  I can't really comment on the food because it is just like any other CF.  We sat outside and those lamps are HOT.  Crazy. If you are new to CF I recommend the avocado spring rolls as an appetizer.  Yumm.
Stan C.,"San Diego, CA",48,25,5,4.0,10/3/2012,"Good food at an affordable price, great service. There's always a line though and they don't accept reservations. Wait time is about 30 min, other than that it's a great place."
Emma N.,"San Diego, CA",0,54,,1.0,10/31/2011,"I usually love The Cheesecake Factory because the entrees are huge and delicious and I'm a huge fan of the Kahlua Cheesecake, but at this location I've NEVER had a good experience with the service. The second worst experience I've had with this location was when I went for my mother's birthday dinner. At the end of our meal when the server was trying to clear our plates, he spilled the sauce from one of the dishes onto my father's lap. Mind you, this is a dark brown sauce from a steak. The server says, ""I'm usually better."" Seriously? Couldn't you at least apologize? And then he comes back with a napkin and a club soda so that my father can wash it off. He doesn't call a manager, and when we look at the bill, there was no comp whatsoever. At least apologize! SO RUDE. My last experience was the worst. I don't think there was a single thing that was done correctly. I'm usually not a complainer because I've been working in the restaurant industry myself for at least 5 years now, but I've never seen a situation as bad as mine was. When we get there: My mother, brother, and I went to the Sunday brunch thing they have going on for a nice family meal, and as soon as we get there we order 3 waters for drinks to start. As soon as I get my water, my brother and I notice things floating around in our waters. Mine had leafy green things and his had a brown blob in it. Disgusting. We didn't say anything to the server though. He seems flustered so we just let our waters sit there. Entrees: We're ready to order our entrees with our menus closed and everything and we looked straight at our server. He takes the order of a few tables that were seated after us, closes out the table next to us, and then comes back to grab our order. Well ok, I can take that with a grain of salt, sometimes servers can be a little off. We ordered a few simple things: the monte cristo sandwich, the classic burger, the giant belgian waffle, and a side order of sweet potato fries. That order should not have taken 35 minutes to get to our table. Tables that were seated after us and that had their orders taken after us had gotten their food before us. Not only did it take 35 minutes to get to our table, it was not fresh-out-of-the-kitchen hot, it was a sitting-under-a-heat-lamp hot. My mother's monte cristo sandwich turned out fine, but my brother's burger was ordered medium, but when he bit into it, it was so WELL-DONE that it was just dry. My giant belgium waffle was served plain with only the syrup and not with the fresh strawberries and chantilly cream as stated in the menu. Later on, I realized I was grateful they didn't served my waffle with fresh strawberries for the reason stated in the ""Drinks"" section next. Drinks: We ordered the drinks and entrees at the same time, but I will put this in a separate section for special reasons. My mother ordered a simple hot coffee, my brother ordered a soda, and I ordered the Strawberry Smoothie. The coffee still had coffee grounds in, visible when you mix in the cream and sugar and stirred, so we had to ask for a new one. My brother's soda was never refilled. My strawberry smoothie had a pineapple slice and giant fresh strawberry on the rim. Pretty! But after a few sips of drinking the smoothie while eating my meal, I noticed mold on the strawberry. MOLD. I sure hope they used pre-frozen strawberries to make my smoothie instead of using fresh strawberries and blending it with ice. Horrifying. Afterwards: We were having such a horrible experience, that we decided to just pack up our leftovers, skip dessert, and head out. It was ridiculous the amount of problems we had at our meal. I'm usually very forgiving when it comes to these sorts of things, but it was just one problem after the other. The manager was apologetic and told us our meal was paid for which was so absolutely generous of him, but when the server brought our togo boxes and a bag, he placed a check on the table and ended up charging us for my brother's soda. Umm ... what? That seems a little petty don't you think? Still, we were grateful for the manager taking care of our lunch so we paid the $3.18 for the soda and left. The absolute worst experiences I've ever had with restaurants I have had here. You have most certainly lost a customer in me. Never again at this location."
Cyndi S.,"San Diego, CA",3,79,,3.0,5/21/2007,Food is okay.... desserts are awesome.  It's hard to get in though.  Unless you go for lunch at an odd time...  it's usually not worth fighting for parking and waiting in line. If you go in to buy dessert to go... then it's worth it.
Jerry F.,"San Diego, CA",47,63,,5.0,9/10/2008,"I've been here more times than I can count... especially when I was younger.  I came here a few weeks ago with a friend of mine and our experience was great. Our waitress was on top of it!  So glad we had her.  It actually worked out perfectly because we were supposed to be waiting for a table but then a bar table opened up so we swooped it and sat there instead. We each had two Well Mannered Martinis.  They're basically dirty vodka martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives (my favorite!).  The bread they brought to our table was fresh and tasted great.  We shared an appetizer this time around as well.  We ordered their Southern Crispy Chicken Sliders (not sure what they're really called on the menu but this is what they were).  And they tasted great!  There were four total and they were served with lettuce, tomato, and pickles on the side along with regular mayonnaise and a spicy chipotle sauce.  I'm actually a fan of the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich at McDonald's so this, to me, tasted twenty times better!  They're new on the menu too so keep an eye out for them. Now if you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before, keep in mind, they don't accept reservations and the wait can be ridiculous.  I recommend going at an odd hour (around 3:00 or 4:00 pm) with a friend for quick service and delicious food!  As for their prices, well... they're not low.  Things will add up quickly here so if you're on a budget... beware."
Tyson T.,"San Diego, CA",13,108,6,4.0,7/6/2010,service has always been pretty fantastic when i go here. i like the outside seating more which is perfect for 1on1 type of stuff. it can get really crowded here because it's practically in the fashion valley mall but the wait can be worth it. i'm not gonna lie i haven't been here in awhile and i don't remember the food too much but i've just had some pretty good times here. i'm not even sure if i've tried their cheesecake here but i'm sure its extraordinary this would have been way more detailed if i wrote this soon after i dined here but i just wanted to show my valuable support for this restaurant.
Alex H.,"San Diego, CA",3,13,3,3.0,7/31/2007,"Pros: Super awesome cheesecake; you can walk up, pick up a slice, and take it home. Cons: Expect hour+ waits, a million teenagers, tourists and old folks."
L K.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/5/2013,"great service, great environment. amazing food. had the steak. there was a little rock in the mashed potatoes but other than that everything was great."
Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238,1.0,11/10/2010,"The King of all Chain restaurants. Still B.L.A.H. How the heck does a place like this get so much play? There is nothing on the entire menu that's either creative or unique. Service is very bad. It's one of the most unhealthy places on the planet. They are pricey and the location sucks. Not only that, their menu is 18 pages long! I think they just went to every chain restaurant and added every item to their menu. Imagine Denny's, Chili's, Olive Garden, BJs, CPK, Red Robin, Marie Calendars, Islands, etc., all rolled into one restaurant that sells cheesecake and has decided to make it their namesake. Their menu is mostly pastas, burgers, sandwiches, pizza and fish. Everything tastes like everything at any chain restaurant in the entire country, SALT. Their portions are huge, but lack true flavor or creativity. Another place that sells chicken and pasta? Boring. If you don't believe me that this is one the most unhealthy places in the entire country, do your research. Yahoo! runs daily stories about the 'most unhealthy food' in America, be it burger, pasta, chicken, faux healthy, you name it: Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS makes the list and usually is #1 most unhealthy. If I'm going to eat something unhealthy, it needs to at least be more creative and flavorful than something that came out of a Denny's kitchen. I would much rather spend the same amount of money at Claim Jumpers, where there's at least better quality and larger portions. $20 for the entree items I named is unreasonable, when they lack any quality. The location of this place sucks. Anyone that has ever been down Friar's Rd, Fashion Valley or San Diego; knows that this area is a nightmare to navigate. There is no view in the restaurant. One side is the mall, the parking garage, the parking lot and Friar's Rd. The service is absolutely awful. The entire staff consists of dudes, empty headed boobarellas and d-bags. It's like the restaurant in Office Space, without the flair. Every single person I interacted with tried to be hip, witty and cool. It would not have shocked me to see someone snap like The Fonz and go 'aaaaayyy!' It was so cheeseball and corny. Thank God I wasn't with anyone I was trying to impress, or I would have been completely embarrassed. Putting a tool in a shirt and neck tie does not make them any less of a tool. Go away, frat boy! I'd rather have someone who looks miserable in their job, as a server, than someone pretending that eating at this place is 'cool.'  What kills me, is that this place was packed. Guess it goes to show that advertising, corporations and gluttony are the cornerstones of American society. You'll only have yourself to thank, when your neighborhood bistro or cafe goes out of business and we're all stuck living off a steady diet of over salted, chain restaurant food. You can buy a jar of their ranch dressing for an absurd price at their front counter, if you really want to take home that corporate America feeling and show off to your friends at Fashion Valley that money is no object to you."
Miss K.,"Murrieta, CA",89,49,11,5.0,7/3/2009,"I gotta say the pineapple mojito drink i had here was delicious! and the spinach artichoke dip was soo good..Everything i have tried here is good, the prices are affordable and they have good customer service. The outside seating was nice:-)"
Chris H.,"Baytown, TX",6,8,,4.0,6/21/2009,"I went here for a birthday get-together yesterday, and we had a good time.  Good food, good time, great service.  There wasn't much, if anything, you could complain about. I believe everyone was satisfied with their meals, and I'm pretty sure none of us got the same thing. I had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, which was outstanding.  I loved those mashed potatoes.  I've had similar just about everywhere that includes the skin; just the way I like it.  I also had their soup of the day.  I opted for a cup instead of a bowl, because it's huge, and not much smaller than the bowl.  It was great.  I believe it was a Creamy Chicken and Artichoke Heart soup.  3 of us got it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We lapped it up quick, that's for sure. For my drink I chose a glass of water...and a Mojito.  I got the regular one, as I believe that's how you properly compare Mojitos at different places.  This one was great.  I really can't say anything bad about it at all.  It was minty, sweet, ever so slightly sour from the lime juice.  And it even came with a sprig of mint and a slice of lime.  I may just have to sample their other flavors of Mojitos. I sampled the steamed Edamame, which was actually quite good, and a huge portion, so be prepared to share. When it came to the desserts, the selection is huge, and we all got different cheesecakes. Everyone loved their choices.  We got, the Tiramisu cheesecake, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, the new Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, I had the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake, and someone else got something else.  I wish I could remember which one they got.  I'd have to say that I will definitely go back, even if only for the cheesecake. My decision to go back for the cheesecake only is mostly a result of the prices.  Most meals are between $10 and $20, and for most people, a take home option is best.  I spent just over $50 for myself, including a mandatory 18% gratuity for a party of 7. I hate mandatory gratuities, especially when the service sucks, but I was not disappointed at the service at all, so it's okay this time.  18% does seem a bit high, though, as I believe tips are anything extra you want to lay down in thanks.  I think I should be left to decide how much extra of my money goes to you.  After all, you get paid a regular paycheck as well; why are my tips counted as expected income? Sorry about the rant; I just had to put it out there. Someone had mentioned on here about the slippery floors.  It's very true.  My shoes are non-slip, and for some reason, I still felt that I had to be extra careful while walking through the restaurant.  -1 star for that."
Jay T.,"San Diego, CA",47,44,3,5.0,6/24/2010,"Although it takes a while to get seated and for your food to arrive, I think the wait for the food is well worth it. The food here is reasonably priced in my opinion (especially since it's so good, and I don't say that often), and although the service is slow, the server we had was very friendly. The buffalo boneless chicken or whatever was delicious, and I also enjoyed my Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The only other thing to watch out for when coming here is that the portions are fairly big, and by the time I was done eating around a quarter of my entree (since I also had samplings of other entrees that my family ordered), I didn't have Any room for dessert, which is a shame cause all their cheesecakes look amazing. Hopefully next time I'll actually get to try what they're famous for haha."
Janis F.,"San Diego, CA",605,28,233,4.0,5/20/2010,"Just went there again and I ordered the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. ""Crumb crusted fresh Mahi with tomatoes, artichokes, capers, fresh basil and balsamic vinaigrette. Served over mashed potatoes."" - um YEAH! I loved this dish! It's the second time I've had it - and both times it was consistently good! I've never had a bad meal at this place. I also had an Asian Pear Martini that I loved. And of course I ordered a cheesecake to go! I always get the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake - Yum! ""Layers of Our Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate."" It is deeeelish! I also love the Thai Lettuce Wraps - I have a feeling that pretty much everything is good on this menu! Good service, great food, the only thing is that there could be a possible wait to get in and the prices are not the lowest, but it's that good that I think it's all worth it!"
Weston S.,"San Diego, CA",13,91,37,4.0,6/12/2010,"The lunch special is a great deal, the place makes you feel affluent, and the staff is always courteous. I'd like to point out that I never want a male server. Why can't we customers pick who serves us? I'd prefer a pretty girl every time. Don't get the avocado egg rolls they're not very good."
Nitsa J.,"La Jolla, CA",12,104,1,4.0,7/15/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory hasn't let me down yet...  I usually get some type of chicken entree or pasta dish.  The only problem with the food is there must be thousands of calories in each dish.  The food can be too heavy and caloric.   The serving sizes are great however, they should not be a portion for one person.  Save some money and split a dish! I've never had the cheesecake but I've heard it's tasty, rich and filling.  This place is always packed because of all the faithful diners and the mall being right across the driveway. If you're at Fashion Valley and have time to wait in the 45 minute line, it's worth checking out."
Steve Y.,"Burke, VA",12,61,7,3.0,10/25/2007,"This place is right next to shopping mall and great place for eating. Only problems is too much waiting to get served, so be there early for dinner or you are going to end up for hours waiting. Food is good, and nice location."
Bardia M.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",156,83,398,4.0,1/23/2013,"the wait is ridiculous but the food is decent for the money and service is great, i will go there again, parking can also be a problem because of the mall but these didnt cost them any stars."
Lady N.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,2.0,10/3/2010,"As Cheesecake Factories go, I find this one to be below quality as it pertains to food, cleanliness, and service.  In particular, our table was not clean, with our silverware directly on the clearly-not-wiped-down table.  The food was dry including the mashed potatoes.  Our first waiter was unattentive.  Due to a shift change in the middle of service, our second waiter was much better. The cheesecake was good as always."
