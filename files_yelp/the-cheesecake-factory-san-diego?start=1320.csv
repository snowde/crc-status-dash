Lisa M.,"San Diego, CA",15,302,51,4.0,3/29/2012,I do love this place! Their cheesecake and food is always good. Try the fried macaroni for an appetizer and upside down pineaple cheesecake its good. The service is inconsistent...sometimes we get awesome waiters and sometimes they are subpar. They don't take reservations so sometimes that kills it if you have a large party. The parking here at Fashion is just AWFUL and people literally get crazy for parking...we usually just pay the stupid $5.00 to park in the lot next door other than that the food is great. :)
Sparky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,58,2,4.0,9/26/2010,"The cheesecake choices are wonderful and the flavors delightful.  The salad selections are nice, but the BIGGEST problem I've had every time we go there is the interminable wait.  We've even gone within 15 minutes of opening...a wait.  As for getting in for dinner, be prepared to wait.  It's a bit pricey too, but special, so I can't complain too much...except about the wait."
William M.,"San Diego, CA",31,47,4,5.0,6/11/2010,"This place gets crazy busy! I love the chicken littles and the mashed potatoes, the corncakes are pretty delicious as well. This is a great place to grab a bite while taking a break from shopping. For dessert I recommend the red velvet cheesecake or the lemoncello creme torte... you can thank me later, or just buy me one. Side-note: the staff is pretty good-looking. And I'm sure nothing turns them on like someone stuffing their faces with delicious food and tons of cheesecake. Tip: bring a bib."
Cara L.,"San Diego, CA",1,9,,1.0,11/14/2010,This place has really gone to the dogs. I ordered food this evening by phone for the curbside service. Someone called Jason took the order. He seemed quite rude on the phone and kept questioning the order. There was no curbside places available when I arrived and it seemed half of San Diego was going round that small parking lot looking for spaces.  By the time I got home with the order and checked it of course it was wrong. I had specifically ordered mashed potatoes with all three of the entree's and only recieved one. Both steaks were ordered as very well done and both were extremely rare. Never again will I darken its door. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dump.
Jennifer A.,"Alameda, CA",844,1782,51,4.0,2/25/2006,"I am not a huge fan of their food, but I am a great fan of theiir cheesecake.  My personal favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake.  So delicious!  They have so many varieties there is one to suit everyones tastes."
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,5.0,9/14/2007,"I love the cheesecake factory because of the avacado rolls, I go there every year on my b-day and eat an entire plate to myself, they are huge and obnoxiously good, so is there mango frozen drink, mmm great combo, I like the atmosphere, FYI they own the Grand Luxe in Las Vegas as well but the menu is not the same, thats why it feels like u are in a casino in Vegas I guess."
Laine D.,"Winnipeg, Canada",43,39,3,4.0,10/28/2010,Ive had a bunch of different food and desserts from this location over the years.  Always great!  Great atmosphere and patio too!
Sue S.,"San Diego, CA",8,131,,3.0,4/18/2008,"Three stars for the food, but the wait is agonizing. I wish that there were a way for them to think better of their customers and streamline the process. However, they are making a ton of money and we wait, so why change, huh?"
S V.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",1,4,,2.0,10/13/2012,"The 2 stars i give is only for the food. I have to agree that the food was good. But everything else not so much. The worst was the wait for the table. I think this is the first time in my life i ever had to wait 2 hrs for a table!!! Worst was that at the time of check in i was told the wait was 1 hour! And then after an hour wen i went n asked they said 10 more mins. Every time i went and asked, it was 10 more mins! I mean seriously.. How can you make someone wait for 2 hours for a table?!?!?! I'm not going back there ever again! To top tht the waiter gave us the cold shoulder throughout the night! If not for the good food, i would give this place 0 stars..."
Steve R.,"Aurora, CO",171,743,269,3.0,3/2/2007,"Parking can be a nightmare here. So can the wait to get into the ""Factory"" at dinner. Expect 45+ minutes at times for food that is OK at best. I usually have a burger, maybe an appetizer and a beer. They're decent. Nothing to get excited about. The cheesecake is good, if not pricey ($6+ for a slice). I especially like their Oreo and Pumpkin (Seasonal) cheesecakes. The food is the same chainwide. It brought back memories of my first visit to a ""factory"" in the John Hancock Center in Chicago back in the mid-90s. Parking-wise you are competing with all of the other draws in Fashion Valley. That means that on Fridays and Saturdays parking will be non-existent. PS - For the reviewer who said the dress code was dressy?  I've seen all types of dress inside. It definitely falls more towards the casual side."
Patrick H.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/24/2012,"Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed, i was there a few weeks ago with the family and had a great experience i wish i remembered my servers name , being a server myself i appreciated what he did for us . My mother in law did not like her salad , she decided to point it out to the server when he asked how our meal was the server than proceeded to ask if we would like something else . We decided to get a different item in the menu . Great server !!!"
Allison R.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,,2.0,9/15/2012,"I used to be a regular. Since they've changed their pizza and salad lunch special, I no longer visit. The salad used to have a heaping amount of veggies and salad dressing on the side. Now it's lettuce only, drenched in salad dressing----Gross! Now when I crave pizza I like to go to Fillipi's on India st., and I order it thin crust."
Eugene K.,"Irvine, CA",11,34,,5.0,3/8/2008,"This place holds the standards of what Cheesecake Factory is all about!  I've been here 4 to 5 different times and each time had a wonderful time.  Everyone here is very helpful and kind.  Waiters/waitresses all check on every one of their customers to make sure they are all enjoying their visit and you can tell since they're busy checking up on everyone.  I have invited different friends and different parties experiencing a variety of environments to enjoy.  I haven't been to the bar but plan to go when I get a drinking buddy to come with. As for their food: GREAT!!!  This place makes me say that I love Cheesecake Factory and my friends in Orange County think I'm crazy when I say that because the one in Brea, CA is the worse place to go and they have no idea that this place is the best.  If you want to know how the food cheesecake factory is supposed to be like and you want that extra bit of service that makes you want to pay more than you usually leave for tip, then you WANT to try this place out."
Alma W.,"West Hollywood, CA",13,167,16,4.0,3/3/2009,"So... I've been here many times.. and each one of those times really really sucked. Maybe I just made bad choices? I vowed to never return to such a horrid place. Somehow, my friend suckered me into coming. Fine, I'll settle for this chain restaurant. I was expecting something pretty mediocre. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio which was a pasta in a basil parmesan sauce. Um... why was it so delicious?? That dish blew me away and made me change my mind about this place. This is the only dish I'll probably order frm now on. I'll be coming back to order my addicting pasta and their fabulous tiramisu!"
leahnora r.,"Downtown Oakland, Oakland, CA",309,225,18,5.0,2/23/2009,"Spicy cashew chicken,  Chinese chicken salad, Buffalo blasts, and the squaw bread. Thats all i gotta say. I've been eating here for years and get those 3 things every single time. pure heaven....."
Dipali K.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,3,4.0,9/5/2010,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake factory..  Always willing to stop by for a bite or two. Love this place especially for it's chains maintains the STD.  Have been at Chicago downtown chain, love the Chicago Downtown feel. Fashion valley is a charm as well.."
Chardá F.,"El Cajon, CA",258,260,46,3.0,9/19/2009,"I think the food here is awful, but if you want cheesecake it's awesome! I think that if you come here hungry enough you will eat the food but hence it IS called the CHEESECAKE factory for a reason. My two favs of all time are the vanilla bean cheesecake and the white chocolate shavings with raspberry sauce cheesecake. I also recommend going with something other than just plain cheesecake because it can be a bit pricey so make sure you go all out to get the most bang for your buck. I love cheesecake!!!"
Danielle S.,"San Diego, CA",235,179,14,4.0,1/10/2009,"This place always satisfies.  I love the thai lettuce wraps, they are the best of any I've tried.  The chicken madeira is my favorite dish; sauteed chicken breast , seared asparagus, mashed potatoes and a madiera sauce with mushrooms, very scrumptious.  The crabcake sandwish was good,not too bready, very good tasting crab meat.  Then there's the cheesecakes.  It's mind numbing the sheer amount to choose from, I love the pumpkin cheesecake, it's seasonal, and I don't like cheesecake all that much, but their is just the right amount of rich and mellow.  It's nice.  Parking of course blows and the wait is always atrocious but it's worth it."
Chris S.,"San Diego, CA",12,48,6,5.0,2/9/2008,"great restaurant...its not worth to wait an hour for, just go when they're not busy or the one in Otay Ranch isn't as busy as the Fashion Valley one. bought my friends dinner one night and it was $300 for the 5 of us, we had the appetizer combo thing which came with a little of everything and then our combo plate where the shrimp scampi didn't come with pasta but our server was nice enough to get me a bowl of angel hair pasta haha then we even had dessert...we had the white chocolate caramel macadamia crunch...really good! the louisiana pasta thing is good...they have a book as their menu, so many things to choose from... i have always left Cheesecake Factory feeling really full and satisfied..."
F S.,"San Marcos, CA",17,15,,5.0,6/4/2012,four cheese pasta is the best.  great servers and great food 5 stars forsure
