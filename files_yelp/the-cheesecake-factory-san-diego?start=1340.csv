Roberto B.,"San Diego, CA",71,116,,3.0,7/27/2010,"After reading several comments and postings, we wanted to try The Cheesecake Factory. Honestly, their food and service was not amazing as other postings. The food was regular not great, but I totally recommend to go to the outdoor seating because inside it is so load and people are walking right next to you all the time."
M P.,"San Diego, CA",5,27,,4.0,2/12/2008,"I don't understand why people are complaining about the wait, and letting it affect their review so heavily.  They're just making a, ""damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" for Cheesecake.  It always has a wait because it is doing something right, but unfortunately people can't see past the wait to even get to what's causing it.   On the flip side, if they didn't ever have a wait in an area, such as Fashion Valley, it would probably be an indication on something very bad going on  Either way they are going to receive a bad review from these people.  Granted Fashion Valley is arguably the most popular mall in San Diego, so you can anticipate a crowd, but generally speaking, there are plenty of places to eat in Fashion Valley and the adjacent areas. CPK, Crocodile Caf (which never had a wait, but just closed down, hmm...go figure), Uno, Food Court, Nordstrom's Caf, 59th & Lex, Boudin, PF Changs, Zodiac, however none of these draw the popularity of Cheesecake for some reason, whether it be the trend, food quality, interior dcor, the public being mindless sheep, good service, strong drinks etc.  Something is causing it to have twice/three times the crowd as the other restaurants in the most popular mall in San Diego. So, to penalize Cheesecake for doing something positive which pulls an unusually large crowd is purely asinine. That being said, I would consider Cheesecake a high quality chain food restaurant.  Yes, it is a chain corporation and you can expect all the usual corporate chain practices: loud buzzers, hustle and bustle, etc.  However, Cheesecake is leaps and bounds above Chili's, TGIF, Applebee's, etc, types of places in terms of price to food quality ratio.  I would even go as far to say it has the same position over some, independent, so called, ""fine dining restaurants,"" in San Diego, which I often refer to as, ""painted rust."" The menu is huge, which is usually a sign of, ""jack of all trades, master of none,"" but I am still to have dish I was unsatisfied with.  So, if you're looking for pizza, steak, popcorn shrimp, or a club sandwich, you can find it here, and chances are it is better than most places you frequent, other than those secret SD spots you go for your favorite, best in San Diego foods. But you cannot deny the fact that his place always has a wait, but as I mentioned above restaurants are usually crowded because of good qualities, however, I am familiar with the term, ""over rated,"" but I think that term likes to be thrown around a little too loosely."
Laura F.,"Murrieta, CA",268,308,106,3.0,11/29/2008,Epic food coma starts here too.  Bang bang chicken and shrimp is bangin'!  I'm not a fan of their cheesecake... how ironic.
Jill H.,"San Diego, CA",0,78,,4.0,2/6/2012,"Well, if you eliminate the fact that there is not enough seating for the average one hour wait for dinner, you will not be disappointed!  I recommend avoiding Christmas season, but that's mall traffic, not the restaurant's fault.  I have had great food and drinks there, not to mention delicious desserts, most of the time.  As far as the tables, they are too close together, but the booths are awesome.  I am partial to this place, and they follow the standards of the chain.  However, I really do love coming here, but I usually reserve my visits for weekend brunch or lunch, because I don't like to wait more than 30 minutes:)"
Leo H.,"San Diego, CA",35,115,14,4.0,8/20/2009,"Yes, it is usually crowded but last night (Wednesday) at 6.30 we were sat immediately on arriving.  It was busy but the staff handled the flow well.  I had a really nice mixed vegetable salad and the vegetarian spring rolls (they may have had shrimp in them) and both were very good.  Jillian was our server and she was excellent. The dirty martini was enjoyable as was the cheesecake. Worth a try!  The outdoor seating was very pleasant!  Leo Hamel"
steve m.,"San Francisco, CA",1,30,4,2.0,4/3/2008,"Come on everyone, there's a line so it must be worth waiting for, lets get in it!!!  Although I've been suckered into eating at CF more times that I'd care to admit. a while ago I just decided I wouldn't go there again.  I don't miss it at all.   I think the food isn't bad in general and some of the desserts are pretty good.  If you want people to see you at luxurious CF then that would be enough to get you waiting around, but I won't bother, the most I'd consider now is calling in a take out order. The only thing that had me considering 3 stars were the delicious mashed potatoes."
Adriana P.,"Chicago, IL",175,112,308,4.0,8/19/2010,"I'm not really a fan of this place cause I hate the extra large portions they serve and the wait. I practically never go but yesterday my friends and I watched Eat, Pray, Love at the movie theater before having lunch. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! The Italy part of the movie is all about delicious food so we  ran over to The Cheescake Factory before the credits were even done rolling.  We had the lunch specials.  The lunch serving is way more food than we needed.  I had the Orange Chicken and it was pretty good but the part that gives this place 4 stars is the CHEESECAKE. We ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. OH MY GOD.  This is the most delicious thing ever!!!!!!!!!!! The crust is soooo good and is almost like a chocolate cookie or just chocolate cookie crumbs, the next layer is THE BEST!!!  Chocolate Goodness! I am not sure if it is like mousse but thicker and full of little suprise chocolate squares!!!! OMG!! All this is covered with a layer of chocolate frosting that is just more delicious chocolate. If you are a chocoholic you must try this.  I swear that after all the times I talked shit about this place I am now a fan again. Next time I am NOT SHARING and taking this cheesecake to my house! I cannot stop thinking about it."
Auzon A.,"San Diego, CA",128,60,,2.0,3/10/2009,"I normally like cheesecake factory, in fact if i had it close to my house i'd go more often. However, i'm writing because if anyone is going to this cheesecake factory, i want you to beware of the shrimp pasta. It was served cold and 1/2 my plate was tomatoes. So i ate my 5 shrimp, all the pasta, & had a whole plate full of tomatoes. it was kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Sooo, note to self, dont order that dish. Everything else i've had is usually really good. All the other pastas, the chicken dishes, the appetizers. Also, if your from out of town, this place is a very long wait, usually about an hour. Just FYI. I'll just drive to Chula Vista and go to the one there to save me some time."
Sarina C.,"Bordentown, NJ",4,19,,2.0,2/25/2009,"Eeeks. First off, the waiter was one of the most socially awkward individuals I have ever encountered. We ordered mimosas with brunch, but 10 minutes later he told us they can't serve alcohol till 11am. Then another couple was practically seated in our laps when the restaurant was wide open. Then the eggs benny came on a burnt english muffin with runny eggs and gross hollandaise. He never came back to check how the food was, probably due to his level of awkwardness. The french toast with strawberries was really good, but I wouldn't go back."
Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,5.0,4/24/2011,"The parking is plenty as this eatery is located inside a mall property. The wait time was no less than twenty minutes. Once seated, the server greeted the table and took drink orders. After taking drink orders and receiving drink orders the server came back quickly to take the table order. I ordered my usual Navajo sandwich which was requested to be cooked a special way. Usually this sandwich is cooked deep fried, but I requested it to be cooked by oven (baked sandwich). After the server told me she was unsure if this was possible I told her I've had it made this way before. She gladly told me she would check with the kitchen if this was possible and then check back with me. The server went and came and reported to me it was possible. I thanked her for her great customer service and enjoyed my meal. The server was great anticipating my needs and providing refills without me asking. The food tasted excellent, fresh and made me walk out of this eatery full and happy."
Steve H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,41,,3.0,3/4/2009,"If you're at the mall, you're hungry, and you don't want to leave just yet, the Cheesecake Factory will fill you up for a relatively low price with good food.  The lunch specials are where its at here, as you can get a personal pizza with a gigantic salad, or a (slightly) smaller version of one of their entrees that will fill you for about 10 bucks. Avoid the pasta; my wife tried two different dishes and they both disappointed. I give it 3 stars in the context of its location. I would not go out of my way to eat here."
Duane H.,"Riverside, CA",131,6,5,4.0,10/17/2009,"My wife and I came here on a friday night about 8:30 PM.  We were told the wait time was 45 mins. Why?  Everyone and their momma was here!  Actual wait time=30 mins.  Mainly alot of couples.  The mushroom snack was awesome.  The customer service wasn't bad considering how busy it was.  I ordered the BBQ Salmon and it wasn't bad considering that I've never seen Salmon cooked with BBQ sauce on it.  (Gotta try something new sometime right?).  The wife ordered Chicken Piscatta.  She said it was  delicious.  Alcohol= 12.00 for a Lemon Drop?!?! Gotta be some cheaper elsewhere.  Besides that, I would definitely go back."
Angela Irene D.,"San Diego, CA",575,436,535,3.0,1/6/2009,"This place is ALWAYS packed, I don't enjoy coming here as much anymore because everytime I come here it takes FOREVER to get seated, the food isn't all that great anyway and for an expensive price! The inside of the restaurant is a great place to view, and the only time I'll probably go there is when i'm really in the mood for an all out cheescake frenzy."
Carebot B.,"San Diego, CA",1,13,,3.0,3/11/2010,"I've always enjoyed the food and selection at cheesecake factory. However, I hate how they sit you literally a foot apart from other guests when you sit at a table. And the last time I went my server, Victoria, forgot to box up half my dinner that I didn't finish and wished to take home. Won't be going back to that one for awhile."
Diana M.,"San Diego, CA",5,17,4,4.0,8/1/2008,"I came here for the 30th year anniversary where the cheesecakes were $1.50! My friend and I decided to eat here around 2pm. It was crowded like a 20-25 minute wait. It wasn't too bad, we finally got our seats got the drinks, bread and waited for our food to be served. The pasta was great, and the cheesecakes were delicious! It sucks they ran out of tiramisu cheesecake. Everyone was definitely taking advantage of the $1.50 cheesecakes. Good thing we went around that time because after we finished watching a movie and got out around 6pm we passed by there and it was so crowded! It must have been an hour wait! Insane for a weekday. Usually it doesn't get that crowded during the weekdays mostly just weekends but I swear it was because of the awesome deal :)"
James S.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",2,23,8,3.0,9/20/2013,the foods and ambience were good had to beg waitress to bring morning coffee she had no personality . there were bugs small ones flying around in our booth we got a couple of bug bites . in mens room b careful dangerous situation in smaller toilet water shoots up and makes marble floors wet and slick like ice i pointed out to manager overall a very mediocre experience but in their defense they have maintained their breakfast prices and are on a par with mimis or cocos or ihop and much nicer ambience .
Jasmine W.,"San Diego, CA",34,25,1,2.0,7/29/2008,"When they tell you how long the wait is, it is always totally off in one way or the other. There is a good selection of food, but high prices and slow service take away from the experience. We had a waitress with a very condescending tone, whether it was intentional or not, that made us all irritated a little on the inside. Definitely don't go during the rushy outy hours at the shopping mall, and the cheesecakes are best taken to-go (you will be very full after the day is done)."
Jon P.,"Long Beach, CA",1,17,,4.0,2/12/2012,"Cheese Cake Factory always satisfies.  The food, ambiance and service made our dinner for 10 spectacular.  Thanks for the good times."
Basel H.,"San Diego, CA",5,28,,4.0,9/2/2009,One of the few chain restaurants I like.  I had a ribeye steak with french fries and onion rings and the red velvet cheesecake - awesome!  Came in around 6:45 pm on a Tuesday and got a table for 2 with no wait - unbelievable.  Service was fast and friendly.  This place has something for everyone - a safe place to take guests.
KRIS S.,"San Diego, CA",3,6,2,2.0,12/15/2008,"If you enjoy waiting at least an hour to be sat, paying a decent amount for mediocre food, and dining in a restaurant that you have to yell at the person across the table from you, then this is the place to go. While I do give them credit for having very good desserts, and having a variety of food for those picky people who never want anything on the menu, I prefer a little more mellow atmosphere."
