Ana D.,"San Diego, CA",177,18,14,3.0,8/30/2013,cheesecake is overpriced. but not bad. good food place for those who aren't up to try new things.
D B.,"San Francisco, CA",299,250,2,2.0,11/19/2008,"I'm not a fan of the mass-produced giant family-oriented suburban chain factory restaurants such as Cheesecake.  I admit their cheesecake is quite good, but their other entrees are kind of unimpressive and boring.  Their menu is large, but this place is expensive and way overrated.  Still, I guess it's a good place for a group, just know that you'll probably have to wait.  Ugh."
Air S.,"Daly City, CA",2,26,1,2.0,8/29/2009,"Good drinks, nice atmosphere, but slow food service. I ordered the pecan crusted catfish special, and there was nothing special about it. The dish came out late, and it was undercooked. Cutting into the fish, I noticed it was translucent and rubbery, which are signs of being undercooked. I was very disappointed, because i usually have a great experience at TCF. 2 stars for now only because the serve a nice pomegranate mojito."
Alex S.,"Bonita, CA",23,43,7,3.0,11/22/2008,"Food is good, not great. I have try almost everything on the menu because I use to live across the street from there and I'd order take out at least 3 times a week. But the wait is long for your food. Give it a try and you be the judge."
Brian J.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/25/2010,"Huge menu, which tells you they aren't good at any one thing. Portions are huge, but edible food. Restaurant is incredibly noisy, and service was slow & inconsistent. I shouldn't have to ask twice for a refill & more water. There's a lot of great restaurants in San Diego that work hard at deserving your business. Go explore them."
Anna P.,"San Francisco, CA",110,204,74,4.0,4/14/2009,"I was super happy that San Diego had a Cheesecake Factory not far from my hotel as I was craving their Louisiana Chicken pasta and chocolate mousse cheesecake. Definitely went there for dinner but hated the wait so we got our food to go and ate it in our hotel suite. We actually didn't mind taking our food to go cause we were all starving. My niece and I shared the Louisiana chicken pasta dish and we killed it. If you've ever been to Cheesecake Factory, then you know that their pasta portions are pretty big. I would've given them 5 stars but then the wait was too long."
Lozz Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,157,226,3.0,9/13/2009,"This place is pretty busy at all times of the day, but I have always been able to get a table rather quickly. Some of the options are only okay, but I do recommend the Shepherd's Pie, which is gigantic and packed with fresh meat, vegetables and topped with a lot of mashed potatoes. The waiters keep drinks refilled rather frequently. One of the best options here is the macaroni and cheese side order which is really creamy and tasty. The raspberry lemonade is pretty good, but a little sugary."
Eun Jae G.,"San Diego, CA",15,301,4,3.0,11/13/2010,"i'll give u 3 stars for having some medium okay food with a mega expensive price.. i get the idea.. but like.. u can do better than that for the price we pay.. and the cheesecake was too creamy.. like.. after 5 to 6 bites, u feel like its too big.. so its good if u share 1 slice with 4 people.. coz it's too damn creamy that it was good at first but after a few more bites, u just want to stop or u'll need to puke.. yeeahh.. overall.. i'll give credit for ""good at the first 1 or 2 bites"" i agree on pricey.. oh.. and dont know why the line is so long.."
Icie M.,"Spring Valley, CA",67,102,8,4.0,3/26/2009,"Miso Salmon is so good my husband wrote a song about it. I tried the BBQ salmon the mashed potatoes that were served with it were made from red potatoes, I was pleased withour entire meal. My only disapointment was the wild mushroom crostini, I keep looking for morel mushrooms and I can't find them anywhere, I thought they would be in this dish. It had a wonderful flavor but no morels."
Melinda H.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",4,13,1,3.0,8/21/2013,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory. The good: food is amazing, whether you order a salad, Mexican or Chinese. Every dish impresses. The bad: tonight we went there with our 2 kids after a long day but didn't stress it since the food usually comes out pretty fast. Unfortunately, on a night we really needed luck, we waited forever for our meals! After I complained to our waiter, he sent the manager over to apologize. He didn't offer anything to make it right...and when you are paying 16.95 for a pretty simple dish, you'd think he could have comped one. He didn't even offer to cover our child's meal or send over a piece of cheesecake. I'm not one of those people who goes out looking for freebies (id rather just get the service you are paying for) but small gestures can save customers. Tonight, Cheesecake's manager FAILED. I won't give up on the chain, but I won't be going back to this location again."
adrian z.,"San Diego, CA",1,24,1,1.0,4/23/2013,could someone please explain to me why people wait in line for an awful piece of cheesecake and even worse food in this country.
Kacie L.,"Aurora, IL",58,27,18,2.0,2/20/2011,"i do like the food here and the cheesecake is great... this review is about the poor service my friends and i received  we've been having some rainy weather lately and when we got to the cheesecake factory last night i went ahead and said we'd take first available seating since the wait for inside seating was an hour and a half... first available was only 30 minutes... so we got seated outside while it wasn't raining which was nice but after our drinks got served and it started pouring... there was a few umbrellas but our backs were not covered and we were getting soaked. so we asked to move inside before we got our dinner. we made our way inside and were seated and our new waiter comes by and we are trying to explain to him that we had just come in from the patio and that we have ordered already && he was like ""oooOOoooo well isn't THIS going to be a FUN night!"" really sarcastic like... i immediately don't like him. he disappears for a minute and our old waiter comes by with him to introduce him... ok whatever. after sitting for a few minutes our food starts arriving. two of us get our plates... then comes the third and they tell me that mine will be here soon... but ten minutes later, i still don't have anything to eat... like everyone is eating and about done and i finally catch our douche bag waiter and point out the obvious that i do not have my food yet... i gotta tell you that i'm skipping a lot of shit from the night because i just can't put into words how ignorant this guy was... he was like ""ooooOOOOOooooo well i'll go rattle a cage in the kitchen!""... what the hell?!?!?!? as soon as he walks away, my food shows up. which is great. i'm fine. he comes back though with this look of ""you just made me look like a dumb ass"" on his face and he goes over to the next table to give them their check (which he was very inappropriately flirting with these ladies the whole time) the chick at that table pops a piece of gum in her mouth and he asks her for a piece!!!! WTF?!?!?! so he puts it in his mouth and goes about being loudly obnoxious like he's waiting tables at dave and busters and i lose my appetite as i watch him smack on his gum. we're ready to go... the girls are done eating and even though i've hardly touched my dinner, my friend asks for a to go box for us... the waiter is like ""i GUESS you can have a box"" smack smack smack ""can i interest you ladies in some cheesecake, coffee, or cappuccino?"" smack smack smack.... NO!!! i don't want to look at your greasy ass hair OR that huge ass piece of gum you're masticating while you're serving people their food!!! eventually we figure out who management was and pulled him aside to tell him about our horrible experience there... rain... the chicken lettuce wraps were not good at all... and our rude disgusting waiter needs to learn how to be appropriate when he is serving people.  we wound up getting our appetizer and the lettuce wraps knocked off the tab and we got a free slice of cheese cake, but i definitely don't plan to go back to the cheesecake factory for dinner any time soon."
Scarlette F.,"San Diego, CA",179,48,5,3.0,3/4/2011,"So I had never been to Cheesecake Factory before, and after seeing how busy it usually is, I was expecting the food to at least be good. They don't accept reservations, so the wait was an hour and 15 mins. Since I was waiting so long I had a red raspberry martini that was tasty and had a decent amount of alcohol, despite it being $10 (I'm used to paying about $7 per mixed drink unless it has top-shelf booze). Once we sat down the service was great but the food wasn't. We shared the chicken samosas for our appetizer and they were very greasy and tasted a lot more like ground beef than chicken. For my entrée I ordered the kobe burger, it comes with mushrooms and onions. The mushrooms and onions were sauteed in some sort of very sweet, almost teriyaki tasting sauce that wasn't mentioned on the menu at all. It was so overpowering I could barely taste the beef and the entire bottom bun was soggy so I ended up using a fork and knife. My boyfriend had the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes, it was actually very good. We decided to take home a slice of cheesecake. It was alright, but I have definitely had better, and for $6.75 it was a small slice. I don't think I will eat there again, if I do I will definitely have the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes."
Joe L.,"Irvine, CA",2,39,2,2.0,10/3/2010,"It's Cheesecake Factory. Nothing too special, therefore doesn't get extra stars. It's not bad, but not good. That kind of thing. Gone to one, been to all. Hope that helps!"
Nicole L.,"San Diego, CA",6,28,,5.0,5/21/2009,"so, i went there last night w/ my boyfriend.  and i must say...VERY IMPRESSED!!! mmmm, mmm, mmmm, DELISHHHHH!!!  however, i would NOT recommend going there on a diet, lol.  so many yummy things to choose from...not really that tempted to get a salad.  i got the margarita pizzette--which was mini, and delicious, lots of basil.  however, i ordered it extra crispy with extra sauce, neither of which request was fulfilled.  the brown bread was orgasmic (complementary).  i ordered the chocolate PB cheesecake and it was WAY too rich and chocolatey--i couldn't eat it. =( my boyfriend ordered the coconut cheesecake and that was really good.  he also got the double bacon BBQ cheeseburger and really enjoyed that, along w/ mashed potatoes, which i tried--very tasty, not overly buttery, and rustic as well. there are so many things that i want to try there, but alas, whats the fun of going to the cheesecake factory if you're on a diet?  that's like going to the Del Mar Fair with no $ to do anything there.  the cheesecake factory feels like an experience, almost like a ride.  it's a fun place and very social.  but i think i'll just stick to home-cooking till I can bust these last 10 lbs... =(  i plan on going there to celebrate when i graduate in 4 months...hopefully by then...my addition and obsession with food will have calmed down a bit. =) ENJOY cheesecake factory, it's da bomb!!!! =) =) =)"
Me D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",50,125,11,2.0,11/8/2008,The service is below average.  Servers can't keep up and they are always forgetting things.  The place has a minimum wait of 1.5 hours.  I visit fam in OC and go to those factories....MUCH better service.
Sundance P.,"San Diego, CA",0,55,,4.0,4/25/2011,"Ate there yesterday for Easter. The food was ok to great depending on what it was. The shrimp was ok I had the shrimp and steak Diane the steak on the other hand was great (melt in your mouth) the mac and cheese to die for.  My hubby had filet and mashed potatoes the potatoes where good. He said his steak was good but certainly not the best.  He also enjoyed some of my mac and cheese.  We had cheesecake for dessert I had cookies and cream and my hubby had the key lime. Mine was ok a little too much cookie dough so I ended up throwing half of it away which was probably a good thing who needs all that cheesecake and cookie dough anyway. lol. Tasted a small bit of hubby's key lime and I said man that's the one I should have gotten. It's was so good. He was very pleased.   Is the cheesecake in general worth 7 bucks a slice hmm not in my opinion $4 sure.  I've given four stars because one of the  manager's on duty was a smarta$$ about seating (way to go on customer service) I won't even get into that. He wasn't going to ruin my Easter :-).  The hostess was pleasant and we did end up getting a good place to sit and a terrific waitress.   Would we go back again... sure, but not for a while. We have quite a clean eating lifestyle, and this was certainly a treat of not so clean eating to last us a while."
Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",174,309,12,3.0,1/3/2008,"The wait here is always ridiculous, even when trying to score a bar table.  People soar in like eagles on their prey just to grab the next available table.  They will sit at a bar table even when the people sitting at it are still crunching away at their salad.  The service here is sub par, not because the servers are bad but I feel like the restaurant is badly run.  No one knows up from down.  I have never had a bad meal here in terms of food, but I do always feel like I am being rushed or pushed or pulled or watched or hovered over.  Martinis are fruity, delicious and strong.  Three stars because they haven't messed up my order, but I never feel right about eating it there, and that's half of the battle-- making your guests feel welcome and at home in their establishment."
melanie h.,"La Mesa, CA",1,31,2,5.0,2/22/2009,"5 for excellent customer service! I ordered a few appetizers, their Thai chicken lettuce wrap, and calamari to name a few. DELISH!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"
Erin V.,"San Diego, CA",156,243,4,4.0,6/15/2007,"I love cheesecake factory, but the wait is always super long.  Try the lemon chicken thing that has the capers.  It's delicious.  Their mojitos are good (that's the only drink I've had there).  I like to eat on the outdoor patio because it's more relaxing after waiting in the mall for so long.  Oh, and of course they have great cheesecake.  All the food I've had is great.  If you're not hungry *yet*, go get in line and you will be and it'll taste yummy."
