Angelica T.,"San Diego, CA",164,157,61,4.0,9/19/2007,"I like to come here during lunch instead of dinner. If you come at a right time for lunch, you'll be lucky with a 15 min wait. Dinner...well I wouldn't wait any longer than 20 mins for a table. Food? All the food I've tried here was great! Chicken Madeira, Pasta Da Vinci, Jambalaya pasta....all great. I think my favorite cheesecake so far is the dutch apple caramel streusel...yummy. Service is good too, but yes this place does get pretty busy. Timing is the key!"
Joe M.,"San Diego, CA",69,48,1,4.0,5/20/2010,"Why is the place so crowded all the time? Has the allure not worn off? I LIKE the food but don't love it. It tastes like it comes off an assembly line and there really is no love in the food. Don't get me wrong, it is good and I'm not attacking the food. I do enjoy the novel they hand you when you sit down. Did I say novel? I mean menu with ads! This pisses me off in movie theaters and it pisses me off when I am trying to order food. Do I have to look at ads every waking moment? After an hour of trying to decide what to eat, I go with the usual. Which is a meatloaf dish that you actually have to climb to start eating. It is huge. My Sherpa died on the climb up. I figured I'll take his corpse home in the doggy bag. It is hard to mess up meatloaf and quite frankly, they haven't. I hate the crowds and parking. It is a tad over priced but the rent must be ridiculous there. I've never had the cheesecake."
Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",61,37,,4.0,5/28/2011,"The food here is decent.  I especially love the roasted artichoke.  But I don't go there for the food as much as I do the cheesecake (obviously since it is in their name).  Come early and expect to stay a while, there is always a line."
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",784,912,135,4.0,4/8/2007,"So, I trek down from the 405 merging onto I-5 on the way to visit my friend Yan who lives in San Diego. When we decided to come here to eat, and we got really good service. It wasn't too slow, and they were very hospitable. Despite the fact that my management analysis group almost got sued for interviewing Cheesecake Factory employees, I still love their White Chocolate Peanut Butter Truffle with a passion =)."
diana t.,"San Jose, CA",33,77,13,4.0,1/17/2007,"this is the best cheesecake factory that i have been to.  the service is impeccable.  i went during dinner one summer night and was seated right away without having to wait because i chose to sit in the patio.  it got chilly a little while after i sat down so the staff came out and turned on those heat lamps without me having to ask them.   my waiter was really friendly.  there should be more waiters like him.  i had leftovers and he took my food to bag it for me.  he walked out and told me that the chef was cooking me another one because they had dropped it. :)  yes! more food!   he even drew a happy face on the receipt. i alway order evelyn's favorite pasta dish.  i dont know who evelyn is, but she has good taste.  its pasta with sun dried tomatoes, eggplant, artichoke, pine nuts, etc.  it's my favorite pasta dish ever!  i shared the godiva cheesecake with david p. and we both loved it.  their cheesecakes are so decadent.  i love how they taste like cheesecake and not like the immatation cheesecake that they served in the dorms."
Nathan H.,"San Diego, CA",180,264,7,4.0,5/8/2007,"Of all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants Ive ever been too, this one is the most insane in terms of trying to get a table Ive ever seen. I mean I used to live next to one in Scottsdale and Ive been to the one in San Fran and neither of them have I ever had the difficult of getting a table as much as this location. Once you can get past the wait (or get to the bar which is a better section if you have 3 people or less) then its food-portion gluttony...and I love it. You get enough food that you can definitely take home leftovers. They have a 13 or 14 page menu of food...I mean its like they have so many dishes sometimes its tough to choose what to eat. But of course, they are known for their Cheesecake...and rightfully so. My fav...the Oreo Cheesecake. Yum Yum."
Brianne A.,"Santee, CA",22,117,,5.0,7/23/2008,"This place get an extra star for the Tiramisu Cheesecake. Yum! The food is good, and you always have enough for lunch the next day. Yeah, the wait sucks, but totally worth it in my opinion.  Another bonus is the expansive menu."
Jennifer L.,"San Diego, CA",71,303,5,3.0,8/14/2010,"I usually love the cheesecake factory..Or so I thought, but then again, all I've really had here was their appetizers and one pasta dish. But...this time around...ehhh....I actually had a meal. I'm definitely a little perturbed that I  had to experience a horribly overpriced, poorly made ""mahi"",  and annoyed that  as a substitution for high caloric mash potatoes they offered me cut up doggy bits of zucchini, and did not offer anything else. The real kicker for me was that they did not have brown rice. I've never been to any establishment that did not offer brown rice. Even run down sushi joints have that as an accommodation. And who eats ""Mahi Mahi"" with mashed potatoes? It was swimming in balsamic vinegar and looked like a floating mess. A quarter into my fish I realized that this is definitely going to be a ""take home"" meal..meaning ..taking it home and giving it to my   for future reference...I think I'll just come here for appetizers, drinks and maybe dessert."
lars h.,"Orlando, FL",0,204,24,2.0,10/6/2007,"Cheesecake Factory is amazing. It is amazing in the number of people always waiting to be seated. Is it because it is a popular location? The clean restrooms? It is definitely not because of the food. THe food is average at best. They have an extensive menu, but why have a huge selection of bad, when you could instead cook a few select dishes with great results.  Just wondering."
Jennie C.,"San Diego, CA",9,143,72,5.0,8/14/2010,"Yum, yum, and yum! Cheesecake factory never disappoints. I come occasionally with my best friends on Friday nights; there usually is a wait  but it is definitely worth it. The waitresses are always friendly. One time we had a waitress that did not refill our ice teas throughout the meal, not a big deal though. They have so many tempting entrees on the menu but I  can never stray away  from their spicy cajun chicken pasta. It is to die for! And  of course, you can't  go to Cheesecake Factory and leave without cheesecake so we always save room  for dessert. I've tried a few  and they were all  delectable. There is no such thing as  bad cheesecake. If you're  looking for great service, great  food, and savory  desserts, this is the spot!"
Dan D.,"Newport Beach, CA",78,188,8,2.0,5/30/2008,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory.  Commercialized chain with a huge line in the front because people are like what is comfortable.  The food is ok, the staff is fine.  It's the American Dream."
Tem T.,"San Diego, CA",31,22,,3.0,4/10/2008,"I'll keep this short since every other person has been or know of the CF. Long usual wait, desserts are decent, and the only menu item I really like is the Chicken Marsalle. Other than that, the place is okay."
Erich L.,"San Diego, CA",8,85,,3.0,3/28/2007,"Everytime I go to Fashion Valley I always pass by this place and it's always so damn crowded. So yeah I went to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my sister's birthday, and I don't know if this is standard or not, but 55-70 minutes wait time! Sounds great...but yeah. Well, I did like the food for the most part. Appetizers are always good. I thought the entrees were all over the place, most of them mediocre, but you did get a lot of food, and I'll give them credit for their enormous selection. And of course, the cheesecake here is actually great, albeit pricey, but hey you can share right? I'm not even really a big fan of cheesecake and I like theirs. Not a bad place to eat really...just hope you have the patience to eat here. And why the hell is it so dark in here? *shrug*"
Sierra B.,"El Cajon, CA",5,31,,5.0,7/12/2008,"amazing. 'nuff said. as my dad always says after a fantastic meal ""i'm gonna take a crap and a nap and i don't want to be bothered"" my thoughts exactly."
Jenny J.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,303,6,4.0,4/18/2008,"always packed and they don't take same-day reservations.  i'm crazy about their shrimp scampi when they make it right (the quality/taste is really a hit or miss).  i have to give props to service cause when i cant finish the shrimp scampi and i want to take it home i always request extra sauce and even though they have to make it again from scratch they will give it to me in a take-out container.  they've got a chicken avocado sandwich which is decent, too.  anything else is just all right. do people still come here for cheesecake?  ive only had cheesecake once at the cheesecake factory before and it wasn't even that great."
Rachel R.,"Cupertino, CA",13,103,,3.0,4/7/2006,"Walking up to this place is knowing that you're in for a long wait.  By the time you fight through the gaggle of mall-goers, teenie-boppers, and tourists looking for something ""San Diegan"" (no clue how CF is authentic, but maybe they're from Moscow), you finally put your name in and the wait is always more than 45mins.  The pager you get is treated like a pregnant lady ready to pop.  Luckily this place has a bar and bar tables just in case you get impatient and can't wait for a real table...that is if you can get one.  Point is, this place is packed...all the time.   After a drink or two and a look-see at the cheesecake bakery window eying your dessert, the pager goes off and you are whisked away to your table.  The menu is gi-normous and can be easily mistaken for a magazine with all the dumb adds it has.  ""Ooh, this pasta dish looks good"", ""what page are you on?"", ""Its the one where the woman is lying on the leopard pattern sofa"", ""Ah, found it..."". Yah, I am not so sure how necessary it is to have these adds on their menu, but what the hell do I know about running a franchise.  I must say, everything I have had there was satisfying.  Haven't tried everything, I don't have the budget or patience to wait.  The salads are so large they are impossible to finish, who can eat that much lettuce, I don't have 4 stomachs.  But, I do have an extra stomach for dessert.  If you are calling yourself Cheesecake Factory, you have to live up to the namesake.  I've had some orgasmic desserts, the kinds you don't want to share, but you have to because you don't want to come off as a greedy pig...no one likes that.    Going with a small group is cool, they have large booths for everyone.  And they have good bread that I love to fill up on before my meal has arrived."
Pals W.,"San Diego, CA",5,31,,4.0,5/20/2008,"One of the very few ""dependable"" restaurants in terms of food. If its your day, even the service may end up being good..Their avocado rolls are THE best! Besides, the jamaican shrimp, bang bang chicken & shrimp are some of my other favs here..I am not a huge cheesecake fan..Hence, love the tiramisu cheesecake here -- its less of a cheesecake and more of a tiramisu..Hmm, wish I cud get some NOW!"
Cedric F.,"San Francisco, CA",110,146,80,3.0,5/6/2010,this place looks a whole lot nicer with a better decor than the one in the city.  food was ok.  all i can say is if you've been to one cheesecake factory you've been to them all.
C L.,"San Diego, CA",10,167,42,4.0,6/1/2010,"it took a while to get a cocktail at the bar, but the food came out fast and it was quite good as usual. portions are extreme so don't get appetizers if u want room for cheesecake."
Libby J.,"Tempe, AZ",2,30,,2.0,5/31/2008,Took a quick late lunch break while on business in the area. Served by four different people and the only interaction I had with my actual server was when she stopped by three minutes after I had been served my entree to ask if I was still working on my plate. Of course I am still working on my plate....the lettuce on my salad wasn't even disturbed from its original formation. Ordered a Vodka martini that was on the menu. Came with Gin.F Would have told someone about it if anyone checked in with me other than to ask if they could take my plate while I was still eating. Remarkably bad service for a place that was not even busy. Eugh. Would've been better off at Nordstrom Cafe. Food was entirely okay but service bugged.
