Catherine V.,"San Diego, CA",34,35,9,2.0,7/12/2017,"So I've been a regular at the Cheesecake Factory for a couple of years now. The first time I went I was blown away by how beautiful the setting was, and how delicious the food tasted, not to mention the service was fantastic. After that, I was hooked. However, ever since then I have only experienced sub-par of the aforementioned. Let me give a few examples of how they missed the mark.  1. Curbside mess: I asked for extra sauce for my pasta and a smoothie. They brought out the food and I looked inside the bag to check the order. The sauce cup had vent holes in the top, and the sauce was leaking. I brought it to the girls attention and she said, oh sorry about that, then it was like paaaauuse. Soooo, instead of her offering to take the bag in and clean it up or offer anything for that matter, I asked her for some extra napkins. She brought the napkins and it took like three of them to clean it up, and now my hand were kinda messy, then I handed her the dirty napkins, of which she didn't look too happy about. What else was I supposed to do with them?? Then when the girl brought out my smoothie, when she was handing it to me it was tilted and it leaked all over my hand, legs, leather seat and car door. Luckily I had leather seats that could wipe& I was wearing shorts cause I much rather it got all over my legs than if I was wearing pants because I had a lot of errands to run that day and didn't want to walk around with stained pants. I was pretty upset about all that at this point. I asked to speak to the manager and he didn't do much but apologize. I wasn't wanting anything for free, but I got a clear feeling that he didn't care. But, the food was good so I let it go and returned. 2. Hostess fiasco: I haven't seen my mom in a while and it was the first time she'd visited me since moving to SD in 09. Well the hostess asked us if we wanted outside or inside. We said whichever was faster. So when we got called, it was to a table outside. It was a chilly night out so they had the heaters on outside, however the table we were at didn't feel heated at all, and my whole family thought so too. The hostess seating us could clearly hear us talking about how cold it was, but instead of offering to move us to another table, she was rushing to put down our menus so she could walk away, so right before she left I asked her ""Excuse me, can we please move to a table that's a little warmer? It's really cold here."" And looking annoyed, she said ""okay, you guys can come and wait at the host stand until something opens up."" So I said, ""well can't we just wait here? There's a table right there next to the heat lamp, can we just wait for that to get cleaned up?"" And she says looking further annoyed, ""Well, I have to check with the host stand first, because someone else might be waiting for that table. I'll be right back."" So we sat there for couple of minutes, then the server came by and said ""hello, what can I get started for you today?"" We said ""we're waiting for another table, it's too cold here, like that table."" And politely he said, of course! So he cleaned it off and helped us move over. Now I was concerned because the hostess hadn't come back in about 5 minutes. But I knew that she would be okay if another guest came cause our cold table was open. She never returned, an entirely different hostess came and looked really confused because the tables were switched. Needless to say the people sat at that table looked cold the whole time.  3. Curbside poor food quality: Now I always order the exact same thing. This time they got the sauce right, but all the food tasted like burnt plastic. I was so bummed, because I was so hungry but the food was so bad I couldn't even eat it. Also, I was quoted 20-25 min, and it took about 40 minutes. I called the manager the next day and he gave me a refund. That was nice of him.  4. Curbside, never again!: So before catching a movie, the fiance and I were ordering take-out. I order my usual with extra sauce, the bread (asking for dark bread only), asked for extra napkins/utensils and two complementary waters. When the girl arrives I checked the order. No extra sauce, the bread was brown AND white, just 3 napkins (which is the usual), and no waters. So I politely say ""I didn't get the extra sauce, can I please have some. And can I please have the waters, more brown bread and extra napkins."" Then she said, ""The extra sauce wasn't in the container?"" I politely said ""no, I just checked."" Then she asks, ""You want a water?"" And I replied ""I ordered two waters."" So promptly, she brought out the two waters, bread and sauce. So my fiancé and I sit down to eat and I opened the bag with the sauce in it, and it's spilled everywhere! The sauce was all over the bag, and the bread, and now all over my hands and it dripped on my clothes. I was pissed. My fiancé went all the way back and got some more sauce and bread for me.  About 50% of the times I go, something awful happens here. No longer a regular."
Cari L.,"CA, CA",63,10,4,1.0,9/15/2017,"First off, I will say the manager and the waitress were great. I ordered from the gluten-free options. I got steak and mashed potatoes and asparagus. I informed the waitress I had celiac. Unfortunately my Nima sensor tested the steak and the mashed potatoes as positive for gluten. The manager was very interested in my sensor, And was trying to troubleshoot why they showed up as gluten positive."
Cody M.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/14/2017,I got to say I love the food although pricey depending on what you get and the service is decent only thing I didnt like is how long it takes to get another drink I felt as though the waiter didn't check up on us quite enough but other then that you won't be disappointed With the food its good with a good portion you will probably have left overs always a bonus
Catherine P.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,30,5.0,5/17/2017,"This is my number one favorite place to eat lunch and/or dinner, plus the dessert is spectacular. For lunch I recommend the club, a Cesar salad, tacos and for dinner I recommend the steak Diane, fettuccine Alfredo pasta, or dynamite shrimp. Everything on their menu is tasty and prepared perfectly. The food portions are large so if you plan on getting some cheesecake for dessert make sure  you plan ahead to save some room because their cheese cake is to die for! I always get my cheese cake to go so I can eat it at home. Only thing I wish the restaurant would allow is to call ahead and make a reservation but I understand why they don't, there would be no availabilities because they are always packed!"
Jesse S.,"San Diego, CA",35,91,185,4.0,3/2/2017,"Solid customer service, I think she refilled my tea 3 times. The place is loud and real busy but the food is great. I had the meatloaf, the best I ever eat. The lights are too dim so I didn't take a picture. It comes with 3 pieces of meatloaf that were cut about an inch thick. They grilled each piece so they all had that great charred crust. Topped with a brown gravy. Not sure if they put ketchup in it like most do but you can't taste ketchup at all. It's more like a really good salisbury steak. The garlic mashed potatoes were good too."
Alexandra T.,"San Diego, CA",83,12,7,1.0,12/9/2016,"Very dispointed with our experience here. It seems as if the Cheesecake Factory was almost too busy for themselves today. Once seated it took exactly 56 minutes to receive our food, no word form our waitress about our food until we had to grab her attention and ask.  Also no apology or explanation regarding the wait, we felt overlooked. Consistency in guest service is definitely lacking, also overheard a handful of the employees cussing in the restroom regarding their shift times as they wiped down the counters and water from the floor.   Experiences here are very hit or miss. You never know what you'll experience, but can only hope for the best.  Also, The roasted artichoke dip will only feed one hungry small child. Not two adults, save your $12  and buy something else from the menu. Portion size is completely off for an appetizer item.   Unfortunately we will not be returning to this location. Mach better guest service at Birch location in Chula Vista, if you can make the drive do it."
Jin L.,"San Diego, CA",34,5,20,4.0,10/22/2016,it is not cheap...but the dishes are good. I ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken （$16.89）and Caramel turtule cheesecake（about $7.99）.My friend chose the Louisana chicken pasta （$13.89）and chocolate hazelnut crunch cheese cake. I like the spicy cashew chicken. it is not so spicy and even has a little sweet.The chicken is juicy，but the portion is large.I can eat two meals for one portion.  The cheese cake I ordered is okay. For me，both the two cakes are too sweet.I prefer the chocolate hazelnut better because of the crispy crunch at the bottom of the cake！ For the pasta，I don't think it has too much flavor.I don't recommend. Btw，I like the premeal black bread. The waiters are busy and it is a little slow for the check-out service.
Jen H.,"San Diego, CA",484,237,1113,4.0,12/9/2015,"I'm easy to please....especially when it comes to Cheese......  Cheesecake Factory is the kind of corporate restaurant at every corner, almost like a Starbucks, except it's calorie count is well over double that of a Venti Caramel Frapp with extra whipped cream.  Most of Cheesecake's meals are well over 1500 calories....  Thankfully they now have the ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  The real deal is the portions are smaller ...(I mean just right ...)There are some tasty items including the turkey burger , and some salads and pastas. But ... How could you ignore the regular menu and the free batches of white hot sourdough or wheat bread and butter?  Their menu consists of something for everyone...appetizers, Asian food , breakfast, burgers and big salads, soups and soul food (chili and jambalaya ) and my favorite page of the menu...12... Pasta !  Pasta favorites include Louisiana chicken pasta and the garlic farfalle. For you simple but garlic lovers, the spaghetti with marinara is off menu but absolutely tasty and delicious. Off of page 12, includes one of my pasta favorites ...Chicken Bellagio. It has a basil pesto pasta with a cream sauce underneath , foreign ham to top, arugula and two big slabs of thin crispy tender chicken that I can never finish.  A non pasta other favorite is the chicken n biscuits. Yup.  Favorite appetizers so far are the Mac N cheese Balls and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Must try!!! The line is exceptionally long (30 minutes plus) over the weekend , but hey grab a pager and go shopping. There is a nicely remodeled heated patio that sometimes is warmer than outside (and much quieter). Service is friendly and knowledgable , never had an issue.  There is a mini parking lot behind the restaurant but it's always full. I've parked here maybe 3x ever and I've been here 40x. Gosh, thinking I've been here 40x makes me wanna go running.  Whew, check it out if you are looking for something delicious in a busy hustle hustle atmosphere. But plan a nice workout or two...in the weeks ahead...."
Charles C.,"La Mesa, CA",54,200,754,5.0,7/6/2017,"I came for dinner at 4:30 pm. As I approached the reception stand, the three hostesses were in a deep personal conversation among themselves and I felt I had to ""interrupt"" them to get attention. not good. They need to be trained to always be ready to greet a customer as they approach. I sat at a high top in the bar. My server was Dan Ortiz. He was kind, efficient and good in all ways, and he stated he had only worked there for three days. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breasts, which I love. The menu is very broad and there is always something you want to eat. At one point, when Dan was not there, my knife fell to the floor. At least 20 employees passed over it without comment, with one waitress giggling to another server ""It looks like the customers are messy tonight!"" as she looked down at the knife and kept on walking. Finally, I think it was Brian who happily retrieved the errant knife. I mentioned it to Dan, and manager Jessica Darlington came over and we had a nice chat about the restaurant. From our conversation, it is evident Jessica cares deeply about the smooth running of the restaurant, and I have full confidence in her to keep the improvements coming. For Dan and Jessica: Five Stars!"
Clayton T.,"San Diego, CA",1,29,4,2.0,3/16/2017,"Food and especially the cheesecake is consistently good.  However today the Cheesecake staff fell short of good.  1) hostess said the delay to sit on the patio was due to ""clearing off a table"".  When we were finally seated, 80% of the tables were empty.  Integrity was thrown out the window.  2) we were seated by the gate, remember their were a lots of empty tables. The gate makes a loud noise when people enter/exit.  Need to fix the gates to silence that banging sound.  3) service in every phase was very slow, especially closing out our bill.  4) the men's bathroom had urine on the floor in front of the urnal, certainly needs more checking and cleaning.  5) need to post ""NO SMOKING"" signs. An inconsiderate person stepped beyond the gate and lid up.  Really?? Certainly a poor dining experience today at the CCF."
LeChonne W.,"La Mesa, CA",112,71,206,1.0,8/7/2017,"I thought I had reviewed them a while back but perhaps not. It was Jan 1 and a friend and I had gone in. The entire experience was bad from start to finish. The customer service (waiter claimed to be new) was atrocious and the food was really bad this day. Long story short the manager on duty came over and eventually it was settled...for the bad experience he was sending us gift cards. I had no huge inclination to return but because I had the gift card I decided to go spend it. Another friend and I dined here this past weekend. I wish I could say it was a great time. I cannot understand how people love the food here now that I have been back. Maybe it was good at some point, maybe each time it is what I order (which doesn't account totally for the bad service) but this place is not good. The young wait staff we got seemed a bit attitudal to me. Her comments back to me in the beginning of the ordering process was not CS worthy but I went with it...let it be what it was and in the end she turned out eh, ok. The food however was not good. I ordered the  LARGE shrimp and pasta. Shrimp wasn't large and the pasta was flavorless. I had to order extra sauce to make it decent. My friend ordered the Jambalaya with chicken and shrimp and only got the chicken. Whaaaaaat! How you just forget a entire protein? She did say that the taste was good (she salt and peppered it though). Once requested, they did give her the shrimp she should have gotten and she added it to her TO GO box. Next table over, I noticed that the same ""new waiter"" that caused the big issues back in Jan for me and another friend was working the table next to ours. He hadn't improved one bit. The couple ended up in the same situation. The HE got his food and was eating it. The SHE did not get her food until WELL after the HE got his food, he ate it all, the plate was removed and then she got her food. I felt really sad for them. Who wants to go out to eat with someone and not actually get to EAT with them. I heard that same waiter making the same excuses he had made with me and my friend at the beginning of the year to these folks. He obviously did not learn a thing in 8 months.   2 other things to note:  1. The cocktails on their menu do not show a price. You list pricing with wine but not with cocktails. When I asked our waiter about it, she was like they range from 7 to 13 dollars and it is obviously a surprise or a secret until you order. It seems a bit shady that they do not list the cost of their cocktails. Spirit is one of the things that seems like it would be easy to price in a restaurant. My wait person got an attitude when I asked her how much the cocktails were.   2. It was a birthday celebration is why I decided to go and use the gift card. I didn't want desert but my birthday friend, accepted the birthday dessert which you would think at the CHEESE CAKE FACTORY it would be a small cut of cheese cake. Nope!, it is the tiniest cup of generic ice cream you can imagine. So small in fact, I wonder why they bother. So cheap with themselves that they do not even offer their name sake signature item as a reward or gift for dinning there on your special day. I personally will never bother to return to the CCF again for all these reasons and a few more I am not going to go into cause why...."
Jennifer H.,"San Diego, CA",9,134,580,4.0,1/16/2016,"Who doesn't like the Cheesecake Factory?!  The restaurant has fantastic cocktails and excellent food. Yeah, it is busy and loud and you usually have to wait but it is well worth it. I have recently started coming after work and sitting at the bar. I get more attention from the bartenders and everything comes quicker. Helps I am by myself but that is a different conversation.  I am a cocktail girl. No wine, no beer. Hard liquor all the way. My drink of choice is Ruby Red Sunrise.  Tito's Vodka, Fresh Grapefruit Juice, Lime and St. Germain Over Crushed Ice. This is a GOOD cocktail. This is the closest I have found to my all time favorite drink the Frenemy from the now closed Fish Public. I love St.Germaine.  I love that CCF has happy hour! Last night, I enjoyed the Chicken Potstickers and Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip with bread. Yummy!  The portions are a hefty size. Usually end up taking some home.  The hardest part about coming to CCF is deciding what to order. The menu is so extensive. If you don't know what you are in the mood to eat, come here and you will find something to satisfy your appetite."
JZsmum T.,"Dublin, CA",0,16,18,4.0,11/15/2017,"Cheesecake is always consistently good, no matter what location we go to! Back parking lot was strangely located and we had to walk through the restaurant because there's not access to walk around to the front entrance. Not convenient, but it looked like everyone was used to it."
Jay W.,"San Diego, CA",2,23,15,1.0,11/28/2016,"I've always enjoyed coming here but I doubt I'll be coming back, at least at this location..  The service was horrible to say the least. Cassandra our server seemed to have 3 tables and it took 25minutes to get my first drink. When patiently asking what was taking so long I was told the bar was backed up which 2 minutes later I had my drink.. I can understand if the bar was backed up (which it didn't appear to be) but at least have common courtesy to communicate with your table the reason why it's taking so long.  I ordered a burger which came with a flatbread bun that specifically asked not to get. The burger was over cooked.  The manager came by to ask how everything was and I honestly told him that I wasn't happy. He had a condescending attitude on trying to make things right... If you want an overpriced meal that takes too long with bad service this is the place for you."
Jonathan S.,"San Diego, CA",8,56,29,5.0,2/10/2017,"Unless your service was bad, there is no way to say the food here is bad. It's amazing. We went there recently and looks like they are changing the menu. Wow it's been forever. They gave us 2 different preview menus. SOLD!!!! They are going more vegan and international flavors. Pineapple chicken. Coconut lime Chicken. Cauliflower steak (which I would never order cauliflower ever) was just incredible. And They actually sold out on that dish. Nice.  The service is always great. Our server even gave us an entire loaf of their bread when we asked for some to take home.  Who does that ?!?  What a pleasant surprise.  For desert I like cheesecake but actually love their tiramisu cake (not cheesecake). Top 5 best desserts EVER.  The chicken pot pie and shepherds pie are excellent. Garlic noodles with shrimp, Jamaican blacken shrimp. All good. I would never have thought of trying these dishes and we did. Wow. Very happy we did.  My wife and are now making a deal to try a different item every time we go so we don't get sick of going there. We would always get the same thing.  Chinese chicken salad and buffalo stripes. Love it   But you always get it.....it did get old"
Ashley V.,"San Diego, CA",57,27,10,5.0,8/28/2017,"I always have a great time with my boyfriend when I come to this Cheesecake Factory. The servers give great customer service/hospitality. I always order the everything pizza, french fries, lemonade, and salted caramel cheesecake. The salted caramel cheesecake is to die for!"
Raquel A.,"El Cajon, CA",124,81,132,5.0,1/29/2017,I have been here maybe 4 times and i didnt pay all 4 times so i cant comment on the price hahahah but wow is their selection diverse and so full of flavor. I must say downtown san Diego traffic is horrific but omg stay here eat and drink and the traffic is no problem. Their dessert is magnificent.  Cheesecake ofcourse.
Dung N.,"San Diego, CA",2112,1692,7180,4.0,8/11/2015,"This place used to be extremely popular and they don't take reservations, so there would always be a long wait to get seated. Now, the wait isn't so bad (5-15 minutes)- maybe because they opened up a second location in Seaport Village? My favorite items to get are the luau salad and orange chicken. The salad has grilled chicken breasts layered with mixed greens, mango, and crispy wontons tossed in their vinaigrette. This salad is light and refreshing! They use chicken breast in the orange chicken entree too, so the pieces are big. Even though it's the Americanized version, it's still really good and not so greasy. The portions here are huge, so sharing is encouraged.  Of course you can't leave without having dessert. Their cheesecakes are awesome! We sat in the patio the last time I came here, but I was burning since it was so hot and there was no shade....I had the red velvet cheesecake and since I was celebrating my birthday, they sang for me! The dessert plate was decorated and the piece they gave me was gigantic. The layers of red velvet were moist and still as good as I remember.... I'm not sure if they give you bigger slices for your birthday or not, but it was twice as big as my friend's new york cheesecake. Service was quick and friendly since we only came for dessert."
Thomas H.,"San Diego, CA",342,12,,4.0,4/10/2017,First time diner here and we truly enjoyed it! I had the steak diane (medium) and herb crusted salmon. Man it was really good! My girlfriend got a salad which looked delicious and for dessert we had a slice of the lemon raspberry cheesecake. Our server was very attentive and friendly. With a slice of fresh strawberry to go we had a great time  I would definitely recommend!
Keung P.,"San Diego, CA",135,110,14,4.0,3/13/2017,"I love this place! I'm a regular here, and I always enjoy coming here to eat. They have so many great food here that I always have a hard time to choose which dish but I usually order steak. I need to try their cheesecakes but the dish makes me so full! Their bread is soft and yummy!  One star out for that one time when I found hair on my food but thanks for at least not putting that on the bill!"
