Slater ..,"Beaverton, OR",6,27,,5.0,11/23/2007,"If you ever need to pick up food for a stay at home date, this is the place.  Their ""Curb-side service"" allows you to skip the long lines to have the food delivered to you waiting in the car.  It can take up to an hour but was a pleasant surprise.  Plus showing up with to-go food with cheesecake goes over well."
D N.,"San Diego, CA",3,117,5,3.0,11/15/2009,"So whenever I am shopping or getting my haircut at the Fashion Valley Mall, I try to eat at Cheesecake Factory.  Now usually,  I'm satisfied with the service, food, etc.  Just recently went there last Sunday for lunch.  Of course parking there is a night mare, you can circle the parking lot five times or more searching for a spot.  We usually just park by Bloomingdales and walk it there and with the carbs you will be eating there, its a good idea.  Back to the food :O).....I usually order a cheesecake to go, and as usual I did last Sunday.  To my surprise the usual huge single piece of cheesecake I am use to, was slimmed down to a sliver.  I mean that piece was small!  and for the price you pay I felt that was a rip!  Maybe its the economy?, maybe it was the baker that day that sliced but either way I was not a happy camper.  So if you order dessert, take a look at the size.  My fav cheesecake is the vanilla bean and the 30th anniversary chocolate.  Yum.  I do not recommend the banana cream.  Gross!"
Joshua G.,"Manhattan, NY",419,192,836,5.0,2/23/2006,"So much good food to choose from.  Make sure you save room for their amazing cheesecake!!!  Plan ahead, the lines and wait time are ridiculous!!!"
Mel C.,"San Diego, CA",136,622,,4.0,1/8/2009,"Came in for a late lunch around 2pm and didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes to be seated. The servers seemed friendly, but a little slow even when there weren't that many people dining. The interior of the restaurant reminded me of PF Changs for some reason- maybe the huge pillars and high ceilings? The menu is huge and it was difficult to narrow the choices down. I got the lunch portion of the Miso Salmon and Mike got the Tons of Fun burger. We were wondering why it was called that, but soon figured it out- it really was tons of fun watching him try to fit that huge burger into his mouth. The presentation of the food was great and the portions were big for lunch. My salmon was surprisingly sweet- almost like they injected it w/ honey. I wasn't a fan of the sea of miso sauce (which was pretty much butter) that bathed the rice. The rice was dry and not too appealing, but the warm bread made up for it. Mike's burger was good also, but the fries were too salty. We ordered a chocolate mousse cheesecake and were a little overwhelmed by all that rich chocolate- good thing there was so much whipped cream to go w/ it. Food coma didn't hit until we got up to leave, but if you walk it off at Fashion Valley mall, you'll be fine."
Flora W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,100,1,5.0,2/28/2010,"I love cheesecake factory! I don't really favorite chain restaurants and I've tried to find things I didn't like about cheesecake factory but i just couldn't. I like everything about the cheesecake factory. It's the best place to have a meal after a long day of shopping. I love their new snack menu, they are just perfect. Their fried zucchini is the best and their ahi tuna! My bf loves the firecracker salmon rolls, we wish there were more per order. Their thai lettuce wraps are good with a fully loaded plate. Love how they have a  big selection of pastas. My favorite is the farfalle and my bf's fav is the Louisiana. I also love the chicken and biscuits and the cajun chicken littles. These items are all like comfort food to me. What's better than to end the meal with their famous cheesecakes? I love their oreo cheesecake, mainly because I love oreos and their cheesecake isn't overly sweet so it's just perfect. The only thing i think i actually don't like are their sandwiches. I've tried two before and they both failed me so I refuse to try anymore. Other than that I love this place. The service is good and friendly. I need another one of my shopping days soon!"
Richard B.,"Del Mar, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/20/2008,"I don't know what the hype is about this place.  Everytime I have eaten there, it has made me sick.  Maybe because I have a sensitive stomach, I don't know.  Typical chain that is one notch above fast food that serves highly fattening foods.  Has anyone actually checked the fat content of these items?   Congratulations Cheesecake Factory, you have made it on my ""never eat at again"" list."
Suzanne C.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,,5.0,2/26/2010,"This is  a restaurant with consistently  very good food and dessert,  my husband and I have eaten our way through the entire chicken menu and the food is always good and we never fail to have a great time.  We have eaten the same food at the Honolulu  Cheesecake Factory location  and it  is just as good. Whenever we want a treat, we come here.  As far as complaints that it is always jammed, well it is very popular.  The portions are huge, you will take half of it home.  Our favorite place to get an excellent meal."
mona s.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/24/2008,My favorite restaurant in San Diego. A huge menu. I've tried a lot of different things. Everything has been good and the portions are generous. The quality here is consistent. The only drawback is the long wait.
sarah h.,"San Diego, CA",74,46,6,4.0,10/10/2008,mmmm....they're white chocolate or cream coconut cheesecake equals orgasm in my mouth....
Ann E.,"Fort Collins, CO",88,130,52,3.0,3/4/2011,"went at noon on a friday and only waited ten mins for a party of two.1 star. we were seated super close to the table next to us and jammed up against a wall. i asked the hostess if we could sit somewhere else and she said no rudely. we were seated for a good five mins and the mgr came up to us and said your server will be with you soon can i get you started with some drinks. yes!! 1 more star. we ordered 2 cafe lattes and they were really good! i ordered  a California omelette and it was really yummy and huge. i could only eat half. it came with a bunch of different side choices. i chose the potatoes(they should just call them hash browns cuz thats what they are) and a bagel! the ""potatoes"" were so greasy and tasted like pam cooking spray gross. i didnt even touch them. i asked for some butter for my bagel instead. my bf ordered the chicken thai pasta and he liked it but he said it could have been spicy. the dish was a large portion. very fulfilling.he also ordered the crab wontons which were really good but could have used a lil more crab inside. they were served with some sweet and sour sauce!! yumm. ill give them one more star for their awesome raspberry lemonade served with a sugared rim(on the cup) and free refills!!! i wish i could give them another star for customer service but i wasn't  wow'd 'with our server. we had a fifty dollar giftcard which is the main reason why we went here. ill prolly go back just cuz that raspberry lemonade is so damn good."
Maril S.,"Tacoma, WA",9,27,1,5.0,8/9/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory is the place I go when I have forgotten that I am trying to eat healthier and not spend so much on eating out.  The portions are enormous (woohoo for left-overs) and the prices reflect the portion size (not super expensive but definitely pricey).  Since the menu is quite huge, I have only been able to try a few different entrees, but they have all been delicious.  My current favorite is the ""Factory Combination"" of Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira.  I don't even know how to describe this dish - it's just absolutely amazing and a great flavor combination.  It comes with mashed potatoes, but sometimes I like to switch it up and have broccoli or mixed veggies instead.  Our original wait time for a table (we were a party of 2) was 20-40 minutes, but I knew it was going to be closer to 40 since the entrance and outside were overwhelmed with people holding beepers.  It was a Sunday night, and for the amount of people there, our wait was not that bad.  We were seated and our waiter was great (I let him know in advance that my boyfriend tends to gulp his water down faster than anyone he's ever seen before, and he was awesome with the refills).  My boyfriend always gets the Thai Chicken Pasta (another delicious dish), and for dessert we shared a slice of the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake (wow).  For the great, friendly service and the always amazing, mouth-watering food (and desserts), the Cheesecake Factory definitely gets 5 stars."
Donna B.,"San Diego, CA",16,78,,4.0,11/10/2007,"this place has so many reviews already, i'm going to attempt to keep this short and sweet... my cheesecake factory virginity was taken by my man in uniform, i was never really enticed to go to this place, but i figured, why the hell not, it's a date... long wait--but definitely worth it pricey--but again, definitely worth it very nice staff-- i don't think there's a but there... yummy cheesecake -- weird because he hates cheesecake"
jennifer c.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/12/2011,"I am sad to review this, but me and a friend experienced bad customer service this evening. We were expecting to have a nice dinner but then with a heat lamp out, cold soup, and a spacey un-attentive waiter we were left dissapointed. The bar was great we enjoyed a nice drink and the appetizers were amazing as well (tuna tartar). But after that everything went downhill, my friend and I both work in customer service environments where we always put the customer first. And when someone who is supposed to serve a customer makes a mistake... the least you can do is apologize and try to make it right. However, at cheescake factory, fashion valley, we had a manager apologize, a food-runner apologize, but the actual person who was our waiter acted in-sincerely and un- accomidating. It seemed as though everyone else was trying to make the situation right, but him. It showed and we left unhappy. I honestly will not be a returning customer at this location and that doesn't make me happy to say that.   In this economy, there is no excuses for poor service."
marie c.,"Fairfield, CA",0,29,36,4.0,12/16/2010,went here with my sister to meet up with a friend. it was pretty dim in here like all the other cheesecake factories. some of the food is expensive. i usually go for the appetizer's because they're cheaper and smaller. i save the rest of my money and stomach for the high calorie cheesecakes.
Kristi H.,"Merced, CA",65,36,18,5.0,2/1/2007,"Although the wait for a table is long and the wait for your food is sometimes longer, I can't hep but come back to this place like 30 % of the time I eat at Fashion Valley.  And its only because of the cheesecake, so welcoming as you squeeze past it in the glass case and the drones of people, and their children, in line for the same reason-cheesecake. And most of the time we don't even have room for it, but the hope of saving that room between the 5lbs of food per serving and looking at the clock realizing you lost 3 hours of your life, and maybe, just maybe you'll have the cajones to order a decadent little slice of cream cheesey heaven makes it all worth while.  I seem to always get the chicken n biscuit dinner (no peas or the food will be swimming in them) and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Both are a-ma-zing and will satisfy my hunger for like two days. Only one time did I get french toast and it happen to make about 40 minutes to arrive.  By then I was too cranky to enjoy it, but otherwise I've not heard of a bad dish there, ever. I will note a couple simple things in a restaurant I value and that this place lacks, spreadable butter and regular ice tea-the passion fruit is a little funky.  But, here's a tip- stick the butters under the bread right when they come, and you'll be golden. Yum yum gimme some cheesecake factory!"
Amy P.,"San Marcos, CA",38,18,1,4.0,4/12/2010,"I'm sure the wait is usually crazy here, but we got lucky for a party of 7.  Maybe because it was around 3pm, but it was pretty crowded.  I ordered the Tropical smoothie and it was nice and freshing.  The passion fruit gave it that added bonus for me.  First, I ordered the beet salad (with blue instead of goat cheese) and it was good.  The beets weren't as tender as I liked and they didn't have orange beets like the one is SJ, but it was very good.  For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Maderia and it was delicious.  I'm not usually a fan of breast meat since it tends to lean towards the dry side, but this one was moist and very flavorful.  Their asparagus and mushrooms added a nice compliment to the meal and even their mashed potatoes were good.  Last, I ordered (shared) a red velvet cheesecake and it was oh so yummy!  All in all, we had a great meal and because the service was actually great, 4 stars!"
Adam V.,"Poulsbo, WA",0,28,,5.0,2/28/2007,"artichoke, skirt steak, garlic mashers, cripsy onion strings, mushroom gravy, grilled shrimp w a side of cajun ribeye butter, and a tall beer (mac-n-jacks african amber if you're in seattle). life doesn't get any better."
