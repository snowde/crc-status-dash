Amanda C.,"San Diego, CA",13,6,1,1.0,11/25/2016,I live across the street from this restaurant so tonight I decided to try take out. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and added chicken. I paid an additional 4 bucks for chicken and the amount that was included on my entree was laughable. The pasta was over cooked and mushy. This was the worst 21 bucks I have ever spent. How can a restaurant get something so simple so wrong? This will be the last time I will ever go to this place. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
Evan G.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,1,5.0,1/21/2017,"I wanted to take the time to commemorate the greatest server experience I have ever had. After having a slight craving for a decadent cheesecake, I made the normally short 15 minute drive to this Cheesecake Factory location. Unfortunately this drive was an HOUR long trek. After coming into the restaurant, beaten down by a journey filled with flooded roads, ridiculous traffic, and some of the rudest drivers in existence, I was finally seated in Jennie's section.  Her smile and cheery attitude when bringing me the cheesecake that I had fought so hard against all odds to consume was the greatest blessing. The cheesecake tasted better than I would have ever thought possible when paired with this amazing service!"
Jose G.,"Murrieta, CA",373,574,1354,4.0,8/18/2015,"Wifey and I did a little shopping and decided to come by for dinner since we also had a gift card... walked inside and we were seated immediately which is always great!  It was Saturday so it was definitely busy... I definitely wish their parking area was a little bit bigger. Our waitress was friendly and took care of us throughout the evening for sure.  The first bread that came out was hard as a rock, which sucked. I ordered a chicken club sandwich and my wife ordered pasta, both which were pretty good. Wanted to order a milk shake, but we were both soo stuffed it was ridiculous!  Although we had to deal with terrible parking instead of a terrible wait time, I'd say that we would probably return to this location if we were ever back in area."
Jamie P.,"San Diego, CA",133,1,,5.0,7/11/2017,"This is one of my boyfriend and I favorite places to eat! We always sit at the bar and come for the buffalo blasts and Farrella bow tie pasta and always try to try a new cheesecake every time. Tonight we had, I believe her name was Joanna (Monday night bartender) and she was awesome! I'm in the industry so I know a good server/ bartender and she was friendly and in top of keeping everyone happy. Everyone else was super awesome and working together getting everything we needed, I can be a little needy with extra sauce sometimes and what not lol. Before we left we got a second piece of cheesecake to go cause I couldn't help myself! We had to wait a little bit because it looked like there were quite a few tickets so we waited patiently and watched all the yummy food turning over on the tv screens, were definitely good try something new next time!      However the cashier for the cheesecakes in the front wasn't so friendly. It was my mistake that I had ordered the wrong cheesecake because the signs in the front had confused me on which was which. She gave me some good attitude even after apologizing that it was my mistake. I understand what it's like to work long hours with rude people but I was nice and at least deserved to be treated nicely back. I felt like it was a huge inconvenience for them to switch out the cheesecake. She didn't even say anything after I had said sorry again after they had done so.      All over this is a great restaurant and they have several locations in San Diego and have a great staff everywhere I have been (besides this one experience) but I thank the bartender and whoever created the cheesecakes because you are a god lol."
Trisha A.,"San Diego, CA",1,25,2,2.0,11/5/2016,"I went here around 7 pm with a couple friends on Wednesday night. They said it was a 20 minute wait which was pretty accurate. We were seated outside which wasn't bad. We were given menus so we decided what we wanted. It took about 10 minutes for a server to come around and ask what drinks we wanted. I ordered a Sangria and my friend ordered a mango daiquiri. She didn't even try to card us.... isn't that illegal? I just passed her my ID anyways but she didn't even card my friend. Anyways, we also told her our food orders right then and there. I ordered a lunch size Caesar salad with chicken.  She brought us the waters quickly but it took around 45 minutes for another server to bring out the alcoholic drinks. I know it was busy but I was expecting the drinks would come out way before they actually did. When I finally got my sangria, it tasted like Kool aid. The food came 5-10 minutes later. Everyone at my table wasn't going to eat until everyone got their food. My simple salad came a few minutes after everyone else got their food (they all got hot plates).  We finished our food and our server didn't even come by til about 10 minutes after we finished. She collected our plates and one of my friends ordered a slice of cheesecake. Surprisingly the cheesecake came within 5 minutes. We each had a bite or 2 of the cheesecake and we were done. Then it took her about 15 minutes to ask how we wanted to split the check. Then 10 minutes later she finally came around with the checks. It took her another 10 minutes to process the checks, which is understandable because we were all doing separate. But overall, this experience was pretty bad. The food was good, but the long wait times after we got seated were unbearable."
Marques A.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",89,78,47,4.0,12/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is always good when I'm craving it.  The fact is I don't crave it that often because I haven't had an extraordinary experience in a while.  Been to a couple of locations in Texas and the service was friendly, welcoming and the food was good.  This location has hit or miss service which shouldn't be the measure of the establishment but that's all that I have to go by.  The lemon chicken is fulfilling dish that hits most of the taste buds so I recommend this for any evening meal."
Tony A.,"Bakersfield, CA",22,18,10,3.0,7/25/2017,The service has been horribly slow. Been waiting over 30 min for a hamburger.  Better be good when it arrives!
Rainy B.,"San Marcos, CA",42,13,10,3.0,12/14/2016,"It is a Wednesday night. We got here at about 6:45. There was a 20 minute wait to be seated. Our server was great, but she hardly had time to serve us and would leave before we finished asking questions or placing orders. We ordered our drinks first, but it took a long time to get lemon for the ice tea. I had a Mohito, and the mint was hardly crushed. They literally just stuck 4 leaves in there.  I had the Chicken da Vinci. I've never had the Madeira sauce before. It was sweeter than I expected it to be and thicker but good. As usual, there's plenty of it and I took half of it home. My date ordered the chicken marsala. She had the opposite reaction than I did. She felt like it was thinner than it should've been and not tangy enough.  We ordered the tower cake to go. I'll have to let you know another time how good it was. The atmosphere is loud because of the high ceilings, but mood lighting makes you feel like you can have a private conversation.   All in all, we decided that if we came back it would be for lunch. The outside patio looks inviting, but it was too chilly tonight. The total bill for two meals, a Mohito, and ice tea, and one slice of tower cake, was $60.70 plus tip. We both have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow, unless the teenager gets to it first. EDIT:  OMG!!! The cake is to die for!!!!! Chocolate lovers dream!!!  If I could add 1/2 a star for it I would.  To the manager who commented, the only thing I could have asked you to fix would have been the Mohito. The rest was ok just not great and hire more servers so the nice one that we had would have time to breathe."
N. S.,"San Diego, CA",34,57,46,2.0,8/20/2017,"The quality of service has definitely gone down. I'm very disappointed with the staff. I'm not sure what's going on with management (or lack thereof), needs improvement for sure."
Jamie D.,"San Diego, CA",13,60,42,5.0,8/6/2017,"Customer service is good, but not excellent. One of my favorite restaurants; I love the salmon fire cracker roll, yummy Thai salad, chicken madiera, davinci pasta, and for dessert the tres leches cheesecake.I enjoy coming here with my SO and friends for happy hour and bdays."
Sabi L.,"San Diego, CA",283,262,425,4.0,1/13/2016,"This place serves huge portions! So it's worth the price, especially when splitting with someone else. I recommend getting the avocado egg rolls for the appetizer. Main dish, I usually get a pasta plate with chicken. All of them are good and I recommend it. Don't get me started with the cheesecakes! I recommend the mango and the Oreo cheesecake.  Besides the great food, service is great. This past visit, my friend found a wire in his enchiladas. He was pretty startled since it was in his mouth when he felt it. However, the manager helped us calmed down and gave us complimentary cheesecakes. Thumbs up for service, thumbs down for dangerous food in the dishes.  Overall, I'd still come here since mistakes do happen."
Danielle R.,"Ventura, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/11/2017,I have never had a better experience at any other BJs - and this time I was only getting take out! Geneva W (according to my receipt) provided amazing customer service and even gave me ice cold water while I waited for my take out. She was very helpful and attentive. I will have to come back and dine in at this location next time I am back in town and have more time. Very impressed with the service.
Rose A.,"San Diego, CA",36,5,5,4.0,6/21/2017,"Happy Hour menu is unexpectedly exceptional! Full portions, too. Took a nice break from the hot weather. Footlong hotdog on a Hawaiian Roll, served on a cutting board with condiments on the side."
AJ G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,1,5.0,7/31/2017,It was a very busy Friday night and they were still able to get my family seated within 15 minutes. Waiters were polite and helpful and food was good...
Latasha P.,"Phoenix, AZ",11,2,,1.0,9/5/2017,"This was by far one of the worst dining experiences that i have ever had. There was a 45+ minute wait for a table, which included waiting outside awkwardly, and uncomfortably due to the location of this restaurant on a corner next to incoming mall traffic, and not enough adequate waiting area for all the guests. Once we were seated, and had ordered there was another 45+ minute wait to get our food. To top that off, while we were waiting for our order the table next to us, who were seated after we had placed our order, received their food before our table did, long before. Ours took so long that a manager came by and apologized for the delay, which was nice. But the final slap in the face was when we finally got our food, it was incorrect. I do not mean cooked to the wrong temperature. The asparagus that was supposed to accompany my steak and potatoes was just not given to me. We were in San Diego for vacation and had to leave or we would be late for our after dinner plans so i spoke with a manager about the situation. He apologized profusely and offered to mail me a $20 gift card in the hopes that i could have a better experience upon a return trip. Well he was just blowing smoke to the out of town customer, because the gift card never came. Will not return to this Cheesecake Factory again."
S S.,"San Diego, CA",0,77,1,1.0,7/25/2017,Worst service ever. Spoke to the manager about it after a 15 minute wait and he said it'll be out when it's ready. By the time my steak came out my party of 10 was already finished eating. He didn't even have the courtesy to knock 1% off the bill.
Alyssa A.,"El Cajon, CA",3,42,12,5.0,5/31/2017,I had a very good experience here the other day the food was delicious and the costumer service was great my friends and I were all very please with our food
Katrina R.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",25,6,1,5.0,5/20/2017,"I came here for a friends birthday with 10 people. Regardless the size of the party and his full section, our server Franklin B gave amazing service with his patience, taking orders in a timely manner, and his confidence/knowledge of the menu. Cheesecake factory is one of my friends favorite restaurant but its even better when we are well taken care of. Thank you so much Franklin!"
KC W.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,4,5.0,8/3/2017,"We had a good family meal, I was happy with my stake it was cooked just right, and they specialty drinks were tasty."
Azerone P.,"San Marcos, CA",584,79,46,4.0,9/17/2016,"Went here before going to a broadway show! Complimentary bread and butter as you wait for your food. Went during happy hour !!  1. Environment feel (elegant) nice spot to have a classy, good priced dinner  2. Customer love (good) friendly personable service.  4. The food (good): I had a BBQ bacon cheeseburger with fries, i would give it an 8/10 on my burger scale  5. Would I come back (yes!) great place"
