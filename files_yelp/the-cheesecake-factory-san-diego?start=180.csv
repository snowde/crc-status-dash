Craig L.,"Escondido, CA",0,39,1,1.0,1/29/2017,"Terrible service! I was misquoted the wait time and then accused of ""trying to budge the line"" when I inquired about it. I am disgusted by this place and the employees I dealt with.  We were quoted 10 mins for two people and it took 45 minutes. Had the hostess been up front with us, it would've been fine."
Sergio G.,"Spring Valley, CA",96,55,30,4.0,1/8/2017,Great place to have a nice dinner. Prices are well. I believe there deserts are just too good! And truly do love going there. And the staff I feel go thru boot camp because they are so polite and attentive. I love the service they give. Thanks guys and I will be returning.
Jeff I.,"San Diego, CA",28,162,338,4.0,5/13/2016,"I ain't writin' no long winded review of the Cheesecake Factory because you wouldn't be here if you didn't like it already.  Food to make you salivate, outstanding waitstaff, and a menu the size of a Charles Dickens novel.  If I were to write a review, I would start with the negative connotations to get them out of the way. First of all, the wait. OPT! Always! Never come at peak times. The wait will drive you nuts. This place is always crowded for a reason. The food. Now, I couldn't begin to tell you what to order....I like pretty much everything on the menu, other than salad. I ain't eating grass for nobody. I will tell you the wife's favorite dish: the Miso Salmon. This dish is awesome. She always gives me a bite and I love it but I've never ordered it for myself even though I say I will everytime.  Now, for the cheesecake. I love cheesecake. I love all the variations of cheesecake they offer but with some of the recipes, it ceases to be cheesecake if it has too many ingredients.  I love cheesecake plain and simple and I don't mind a variety like the one I tried today: The Salted Caramel. Delicious! Graham cracker crust, caramel, cheesecake.....Honey hush! This was awesome. That's about it. What can I tell you that you don't already know. If you've never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, I'm sure you'll find something you like. If you have, you've nothing else to try except a different variation of cheesecake. Enjoy!"
Jesse D.,"Long Beach, CA",3,2,1,2.0,3/22/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I come here often with my family and last week we had a very unfortunate experience. Service was horrible. After we ordered our food, it took over an hour to get the food to our table. Even the appetizer took about 45 minutes to arrive. The entire time we were waiting we didn't have an idea how much longer it would take. We had no communication from our waitress and she rarely came to our table. The food was great as always, just bad service."
Ed P.,"San Diego, CA",60,173,109,5.0,11/22/2016,Anaka our servers was outstanding we dined in the bar this evening any were treated very professionally! All drinks were refilled we always greeted with a sincere smile by our server. She checked back always assuring our drinks were refilled. She offered dessert and a treat to take home we had to say no. My Cajun  jambalaya pasta lacked sausage?                                  Hum didn't know if it was suppose to contain any and I didn't bother to ask.
Lisa W.,"San Diego, CA",2922,1852,5900,2.0,3/25/2015,"Why did we even bother coming here? Because Betsy had a gift card that we won at the Singles Masquerade party weeks ago and needed to use it. Again I hate big establishments, horrible customer service, price not worth the frozen food or mediocre food, not worth the wait, and definitely not worth your time. I guess it's good if you are a family and just need those big establishments like Cheesecake, Buca De Beppo, Applebees etc.  I did however enjoy my miso glazed slamon, it was pretty decent...but I was also coming out from a work out so I was just hungry. I think cheesecake can be good, if they had good customer service. For a big establishment I don't think that's the least of their concern. Anyhoo, our server was horrible, she was non existent most of the time and after 30 minutes of waiting for our bill we were talking about how we should have gone somewhere else... What a waste of her time and our time.  To all the haters- this is an opinion. If I have a bad experience here don't hate because the servers here didn't do their jobs. It's not my fault that they can't even provide the basis of their job description- to serve food and customer service. Haters gon hate."
Ronald T.,"San Diego, CA",66,160,538,4.0,3/31/2016,"My brother gratuated from ITT and the ceremony was just down the street.  It was late and Wife and son felt like dessert.  So cheesecake was on everyone's mind.  I don't know which factory ever has open seating.  The wait at all of them seem to be at least an hour.  That's why I give it 4 stars.  I love this franchise....I don't come often because of the wait.  Anyway, this time if was just for dessert.   This visit was at 9 pm and the wait was only 20 min.  We got out dessert fill.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory."
Shena R.,"Imperial Beach, CA",177,146,242,5.0,5/21/2016,"Chicken carbonara was delicious, and the Georgia Peach frozen cocktail suggested by our server was on point too. Lastly I had to finish this meal with the Oreo cheese cake, but I have no pictures of that because it was too good to stop eating."
Meri D.,"San Diego, CA",99,730,2683,3.0,8/13/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is a good option for plentiful food options and this one is the same like all others just conveniently located in Fashion Valley. I've been here quite a few times and the ambiance is the same very cozy and nice inside however usually with a long wait. I came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed, however I got lucky and found a high table near the bar area. The busser was quick to clean the table which was cool. The server was sweet and she gave good service all around. I love their squaw bread it's always soft and fresh a good nibbler before the main meal. As for the food I got the *Chicken Bellagio* which was perfectly made, the flavors blend well! To satisfy my thirst I got a *Red Sangria* which was fruity and fresh on the rocks. It took forever for the entrees to come out, yikes. It was cool though how the manager made his rounds apologizing about the long wait.~"
Mura Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,,1.0,4/14/2017,"By far, it's the worst CCF restaurant in the country that I have been to! We came In last night around 9 pm , they were little packed as always like a zoo, however we came to the host and she didn't even smile or react, so we have to bug her for being greeted and finally she responded and said it's gonna take about 10-15 min to set in the patio! I said fine . Waited for the first 25 min and no response! Went there asked her if we are getting seated any time soon! She said the patio is busy and some one should evacuate soon! ( seriously?? You could have told us from the beginning it's gonna take longer than 25 min). Again we waited another 20 min total of 45 min! And after that she was just having an attitude with us ( may be she didn't like the way we looked?? Or just having a f***n bad day ?? ) who knows!!! I did mention that to our server and he was apologetic, but didn't bring that to his manager! So here the food comes! We order orange chicken, and picatta chicken pasta, and the food taste awful! The veggies in the orange chicken look like they microwave it ,and some was warm and the other was cold! The chicken tasteless, and the sauce is dry! I didn't wanna complain again so our server thinks we need a free food or some! I am not that kind of people. I just asked for our check and I am done with this restaurant, it's going to be McDonald's soon!"
Maira G.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/21/2017,The cheesecake are to die for and the food is like heaven on earth service is awesome totally worth the wait.
melissa g.,"Santee, CA",7,19,4,5.0,6/17/2017,"The food here is amazing, there is a reason for the line out the door, but tonight I must commend the service from the staff behind the bar as well. Jason G helped us out and was polite, attentive, and fast! We had our drinks quickly and the food tasted amazing. Even when the kitchen ran out of the dish I had ordered, he quickly fixed the issue and helped me to order something similar, they even took care of my dinner and my boyfriends beer because of the delay in waiting for our food. All in all it was a great experience!"
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,4.0,3/29/2015,"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory have always been consistent. How do I figure out the best way to relate my experiences at The Cheesecake Factory to Yelp? like this... Eating at Cheesecake Factory is like having a one night stand with someone you come to regret the next day.  Like awkward one night stands, TCF always feels so good during the heat of the moment. Most of the entrees are so drool-worthy and delectable. There is nothing more satisfying than eating a delicious meal and ending the adventure with one of those signature cheesecake slices.  But unfortunately, you also come to regret eating at Cheesecake Factory every time because you feel like shit afterwards. Most of their entrees and desserts are high in calories, carbs and fat  ( I am talking to you Chicken Alfredo pasta!!!). Every time I eat here, I regret it because I feel like I am shortening my lifespan by 15 hours.  That being said, I can't resist the temptations of The Cheesecake Factory like I can't resist regrettable one night stands with women. The food is comforting, the service is always consistently good for me, and that complimentary bread is addicting like crack! disclaimer: I don't support one night stands...lol"
Nadia R.,"San Diego, CA",153,95,368,4.0,8/29/2016,"Long wait. Great place to eat ..This is a standard Cheesecake Factory with everything you expect from the chain.  Good food, good desserts, and good service.  It was exceptionally busy and noisy when visited, to the point where the girls on the entrance desk could hardly hear anything we was saying, so even just getting on the waitlist for a table was difficult.  It all felt very chaotic and stressful, but once we were seated it was fine.  We could probably go to one of the other Cheesecake Factories in the area next time, but there's nothing particularly wrong with this one.  We just prefer a quieter location."
Kristen W.,"San Marcos, CA",0,31,,5.0,1/16/2017,"Had lunch here in January 16 with family to celebrate my dtrs belated 17th birthday.  Food was great.  Our waiter Jenee was great, very friendly and attentive.  Frequently checked in with us to make sure we were very satisfied with everything we ordered.  My dtr though her pizza was over cooked, Jenee offered to have another one made but by dtr said it was fine.  Later Jenee came back and said the manager would like to make up for the unsatisfactory pizza by offering her a dessert.  Excellent above and beyond service.  This shows Jenee wants her customers to be happy and satisfied.  I find that many waiters do not follow up with their manager on customer feedback.  This shows Jenee did.  Kudos Jenee, we will definitely return because of the superb service you provided.   Thank you Kristen Wilson"
Maridel A.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",1777,928,1852,2.0,3/5/2015,"I'm only a fan of their brown bread! I can eat their brown bread for days... With a stick of mini butter for each slice... Yummmmm!!! Oooh I'm also a fan of their peach berlini. So good it's a creeper. You cannot taste the alcohol but little do u know you're drunk/buzzin'!  Not a fan of their food. I've tried changing it up on their menu but I can never finish my food... I always end up taking mine home. The staff are friendly. But I feel they're trying to hard like there's a gun to their head to provide exceptional customer service.  As long as you bring my draaanks and food on time, you're good. Had dinner here last night with my girl friends. Our server was ok she only came to our table twice and became super friendly when the bill came. I wasn't a fan of her service so I didn't tip her much.  After dinner we stayed and chatted at the table and our server walked by a few times. I'm sure she wanted us to leave. First off the food was gross so we had it boxed up after a few bites. Yes we're going to stay, hang around and chat. We deserve this table for at least 1.5hrs since we waited 30+mins for this table. They're always busy during lunch and dinner. This location doesn't have happy hour specials. Come early cz they don't take reservations and the entire party has to be present. Any who. They still have the best bread. 2nd best behind Outback Steakhouse."
Jerm M.,"Oceanside, CA",13,63,103,5.0,4/26/2016,-The spicy cashew chicken is Amazing!!  -Love the avocado egg rolls! -Love the bread! -Lemon Raspberry cheesecake is must try!
Mesha G.,"San Diego, CA",222,119,70,4.0,10/4/2016,"The food is amazing! I've been known to get a Cheesecake to go from time to time after work. The food is a little more high priced but worth it. There's no price tag that would stop me from ordering the fried Mac and Cheese. It's got a great crust, filled with extra cheesy Mac and cheese and it sits on a delicious sauce. I only wish there were more. Service was pretty slow for the amount of people in the restaurant, not sure if theirs not enough servers for the amount of tables or what. Our guy was nice and everything was correct. There was just a lot of lag time between the order for our drinks and for there order for our food. Apparently if you have a small dog they will let you bring it into the restaurant because a lady was inside and had a yorkie on the booth inches away from me and was feeding it bread. Several waiters saw and no one else saw it as a sanitary issue and asked her to stop. It definitely rubbed me the wrong way. I love my dog but I don't want her eating right next to me!"
Arissa G.,"San Marcos, CA",122,160,353,4.0,2/25/2016,"I finally got to try this place out!! Now being located right by the mall can be hectic...I'm serious. My boyfriend and I arrived at 6:30 pm for dinner and was told the wait time would be about 40 mins. The place was packed! They didn't have enough pagers so we had to wait a little and ask for one. Luckily 15 mins later we were able to get one. 10 mins after that we were called to be seated. Being a table of 2 granted us a table faster which was nice. Our serve Blair was awesome! She was very content and accommodating to us. She made our experience a memorable one. The food was delicious! Very rich in flavors in the pasta's. They offer complimentary fresh bread which fills you up by the time you eat, but allows you to take left overs home..lol. You pay for what you get here. Worth the time and money! *Beware: A lot of their food is high-calorie. There is a skinny menu, but that just defeats the purpose of the good food!"
Bianca J.,"Temecula, CA",89,6,,4.0,7/4/2017,"The food was good, our server was nice. It was just annoying that we had so many gnats at and around our table, and we weren't even outside."
