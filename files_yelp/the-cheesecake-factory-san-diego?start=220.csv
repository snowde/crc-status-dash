Marie M.,"El Cajon, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/17/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has some really great food, the only concern that I have is that their restrooms are never as clean as they should be for how much you spend. I should not have to walk into a restroom with dirty feminine products on the floor and no products for proper restroom use."
梅,"San Diego, CA",0,21,,3.0,5/23/2017,"I think I like other branches better than this one. Cheesecake Factory is a regular place my family and I go for birthdays, but for some reason, the food here tasted less fresh and seasoned. Not to mention the lackluster service."
Blanca R.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,6,1.0,4/23/2017,Waited one hour for my food and it never came! Finally asked the waiter and she apologized and said they were going to cook it as fast as they could! We said never mind  we had to leave and they didn't even have the decency to waive the ice tea I drank!!! Definitely not coming here again
Karen V.,"Santee, CA",86,15,12,4.0,7/5/2016,"My honey and I shared the Sweet Corn Tamale appetizer.  It was delicious and made our taste buds dance with flavors of cilantro, lime, avocado. You may wonder, why no photo? It was gone before I could pull my phone out! Five stars on that!  I had the tomatoes, basil, cheese Flatbread from the skinny menu.  It needed more flavor, garlic would have been my choice.  The hubby gave 5 stars to his shrimp and sausage pasta.  Dessert, decadent salty caramel cheesecake and classic cherry cheesecake boxed up for our midnight snack. ;-)"
Kristy T.,"San Diego, CA",8,8,21,1.0,12/5/2016,"I was here for my birthday, the service was awful! I got seated at 8:30 pm but didn't get my food until 10! They need to have more waiters outside in the back. Our waiter rarely checked up on us and it was just a hot mess"
Zeena O.,"Murrieta, CA",1,5,4,5.0,7/9/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is on my top 5 for chain restaurants, and I was especially satisfied with this location.  They were really busy, but the food still arrived fresh, tasty, and on time. Our waiter was so nice and helpful, I feel bad for forgetting his name but he did a great job!!  I ordered the Mac and cheese burger, which is just to die for!!! Words can't even describe how amazing it was, order it for yourself and you'll see.  My mom thought that her BBQ pizza was pretty average, and I actually agree with her on that.  Other than that, we were extremely pleased with the fast and quality service we received that we don't usually get at other locations!"
Anna G.,"San Diego, CA",5,32,5,2.0,4/17/2017,"Food was awesome. Unfortunately though, we never got a server. We were sat and informed that our server was on a break, a girl took our order then our food/wine came out from other workers. The girl who took our order was also not seen again. The actual server never came by either. No refills were ever offered to us. We ordered cheesecake from a random worker we stopped as she walked by. She forgot. Had to ask someone else. She brought it to us with the tab after a solid hour of being there. Every time we wanted to order something we had to track someone down that seemed annoyed to help us."
Lissa E.,"Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom",183,102,639,4.0,11/10/2015,"I started with the Pretzel Crusty Chicken. They were pretty much perfect, the pretzel coating was crisp and the chicken breast inside was moist - and both dipping sauces (honey mustard and ranch) went really well with the hint of pretzel flavour. For my main, I went for Orange Chicken - the cheaper, smaller lunchtime portion - but there was nothing small about it, it was so filling. Really tasty too! I was pretty full by the time I was done with my main, but it was October and that means pumpkin so I couldn't not have cheesecake! Pumpkin Pecan is my cheesecake of choice, and I stuck with it, with no regrets!"
Nina A.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/23/2017,"Pamela B. Older woman with short blonde hair. Worked 1/23/17 Monday night shift. Treated me and my friend like annoying little kids. When in fact we are in are mid 20s trying to have a nice dinner. She was rude and when I asked her to split the checks she snatched the bill out of my hand. And snatched a fork out of my friends hand. Excuse me! How dare you lady! What disrespect! Such a violence! It was as if she assumed we weren't going tip because we looked young and gave us bad service. The attitude and customer service was horrible this isn't the first time I've had a problem with the servers here. It's like if all servers are unhappy working there. I've been a server in my younger years even at the Cheesecake Factory at a different location, and that's no way to treat anyone Never coming here again!!!! Get better customer service! Or just close down!"
Cheryl L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",17,14,,2.0,12/20/2016,"It's okay. Service was terrible. Lots of people standing around at the stations, but we still waited a long time for food and had slow service for refills and such. The food is what it always is at Cheesecake Factory. Overpriced for mediocre food. The cheesecake is still great, though."
Lisa D.,"Scituate, RI",0,3,1,1.0,5/28/2016,"Arrived as a party of 5. Waited over 40 min for only 3 meals that did come out. The remaining 2 meals came out another 20 min later. While half of our group was done, the last of us were not as hungry after the long wait. One of the dishes was supposed to be chicken Alfredo, however it too was missing the chicken. Here goes another 20 more min of waiting. One of the last plates came out with someones hair in the meal. Fantastic!! Not an appealing meal anymore! I'll never come back, too disgusted. Service was so horrible.  Check your food you might have a little extra something for free."
Sarah J.,"Yuma, AZ",1,58,154,3.0,3/21/2017,Got the lunch pasta carbonara. Assumed it would come w/chicken like the dinner portion but that is my fault. It is the dish I have liked the least so far. The shepherd's pie and meatloaf are on top of my list. Server was very nice but this location is not the cleanest. The floors were pretty dirty and felt slippery/greasy. The one in Marina Del Rey (LA area) much better.
Sharmila P.,"San Diego, CA",45,61,24,4.0,8/5/2016,"The cheesecake is unmatched. The food is just as rich as the cheesecake. Definitely great for a special occasion or celebration  but not an every week spot. I love the egg roll sampler. Four different kinds and if you share it, not too many calories. Then you can for sure have some cheesecake ;)"
Alex D.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,1,2.0,1/20/2017,"We came here for date night and weren't impressed. I had the chipotle chicken which tasted like the chef saw something on Pinterest, decided to try it and failed. I know because I do this all of the time. They put tortilla chips on top of pasta which ruined it and it had more of a sweet taste instead of chipotle taste. $8 for a sliver of cheesecake. Super disappointing. Won't be back. Side note: staff was great"
Jonathan M.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,14,1,5.0,8/25/2017,Food was awesome. My grandmother came down from Anaheim and she really enjoyed it. What made it stand out was Brandy M. She was an awesome waitress. She was kindhearted and sweet. Thank you Brandy M for being awesome
Rebecca B.,"Santee, CA",0,2,,4.0,4/23/2017,"This review is mainly to give a shout out to someone who, while our waitress was super busy, was on top of helping her out and making sure we had everything we needed. We've been waiting for over an hour for our food (they're super busy!) But Saul is working his butt off to make things easier! Whitney isn't our waitress but she's also amazing! Our waitress is trying her best. But their really busy!"
Laura C.,"San Diego, CA",753,401,3473,4.0,9/9/2015,When its a 104 degrees out and you just want to eat some cheesecake factory by the pool...call ahead and pick up in their little lot. The food to go is good but its always way better and fancy looking when you dine in of course.
Raelynn T.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,1,1.0,11/21/2016,"This update is long overdue. Several months ago, I went to the Cheesecake Factory with several friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. She uses a power chair because she has a physical disability and relies on it as her primary source of mobility. After the staff and manager had treated her disrespectfully, I posted a yelp review to document this experience and so that individuals with disabilities and their loved ones can be more informed when visiting this location. Yes, on Yelp the Cheesecake factory invited me to follow up with them (I included the date and time of our visit) and said that they would follow up within a few days. Well, surprise, surprise. The Cheesecake factory NEVER FOLLOWED UP with me. I've been waiting for months and it's been far too long. This suggests that the Cheesecake factory responded to my initial review just to maintain good PR with their customers but do not actually care about how their customers are being treated. I have personally received no indication that the Cheesecake factory has done anything to right this wrong, and I will not be providing them with my business again."
Katie L.,"San Diego, CA",54,64,17,1.0,11/26/2016,"My whole experience is too long to type, but everything was terrible from the hostess to the food.. our server Cassandra gave literally the worst service ever.. when only having 3 tables. The manager Sean, seemed okay until he made it clear he was only going to buy us cheesecake, not take the well done burger off the bill as well... well you should be doing both no questions asked! 15 minutes for drinks, terrible service, etc. not coming back here"
Roxanne L.,"San Diego, CA",40,198,578,4.0,10/8/2015,This place is great for a huge variety of food on the menu. They have a great breakfast menu that's goes on for most of the day on Sunday. When I do go I go for brunch and get an omelet. They also have great salad choices too. Great location and if you go in the morning there's usually no wait or a couple minute wait. It's very busy here for dinner time.
