Nicol S.,"San Diego, CA",34,7,2,3.0,11/12/2017,"Came here last night (Saturday) for my son's birthday. Arrived at 6pm and was told there would be a 50 minute wait but i had expected this. When the hostess asked me if I preferred indoor or outdoor or first available i asked if sitting outside would be cold and that I had children with me and she said ""oh no it's very warm...children will be warm"" well that was incorrect. Everyone sitting outdoors looked cold, we were cold and everyone had their jackets on and for the guy sitting at the bar close to the door, he was shivering. The waitress was very responsive to the point where I hadn't even had a chance to open the menu before she asked for our drinks and wanted to box up our food a few minutes after we got it brought us our bill before I could order cheese cake rushing us out the entire time. She had to fix bill to add our deserts on it. My son who was eating was telling her to not take plate away to box up (as he was chewing) because he was still eating. Kind of rude taking food away from a child eating. Food portions are small and are hit and miss. My son's food looked good, mine was gross. My side salad was literally just lettus no tomatoes or anything. The chicken blt my sandwich was on was made with plain wheat bread. Ordered a lemon drop had no taste of alcohol in it. Overall for the 150 bill we had for 4 people the experience was not good at all. I would not recommend spending a special occasion here."
jayna k.,"Alpine, CA",0,15,,5.0,4/16/2017,so happy to have Franklin B as our server. He was amazing. He was so friendly and so on it!!! Franklin is the best
Oscar F.,"San Diego, CA",3,20,2,1.0,3/16/2017,"Went there for Valentine's Day. Waited 1.5 hours (as expected) but our food and experience was horrible. Our food was cold. And my girlfriends plate had a wire from the scrub they use to clean the pots and grill. They asked us if we wanted to order anything else but at that point we were just over it. I didn't ask for them to comp our drinks as I'm not that kind of person but I'd expect them to do it on their own will as it was a special day and they didn't meet the mark. They gave us our tab with the soda and alcoholic drink my gf ordered. It was like $15 bucks. I left a tip for the waiter, Jeffery, as he was wonderful and it wasn't his fault. Managers on the other hand did not respond as I would of expected. Last time I'm visiting any cheese cake factory. We ended up at in n out. It didn't ruin our night as the conversation was good. But they can't get off the hook that easy, right?"
Leo M.,"San Diego, CA",216,4,2,1.0,4/12/2017,"Amazing waitress Giselle, terrible manager Sean , he's the worse manager I have come across in all 51 states. He is terrible , rude , worse management ever , I eat out a lot at 5 star restaurants dennys management can teach him a thing or 2 about respect and how to treat a customer . SEAN is TERRIBLE"
Lily G.,"Calexico, CA",1,5,1,1.0,11/7/2016,Went on Saturday night and waited an hour and 15 minutes to be seated. We were celebrating our friends birthday. Once we were seated we immediately knew what we wanted and placed our order. We then waited an hour for our food to be served and was cold when it arrived. The waitress had a very unfriendly mood for customer service which made our experience worse. We ordered a cheese cake after our meal but then realized it would take too long. When we tried to cancel it our waitress rudely didn't want to go out of her way to cancel it so we had to wait another 20 minutes for it to arrive. We just wanted to get out of the restaurant as fast as we could since our experience was horrible and not worth the price.
Israel H.,"Chula Vista, CA",165,27,6,2.0,5/20/2016,Let me start off by saying that I love the food here. The waiter we received was pretty friendly. However this particular visit wasn't one I was too fond of. I received a hair on my buffalo blast and wasn't too pumped about it. Upon showing my server he kinda just gasped about it and took that individual piece to the back. Wasn't too thrilled about eating the rest of them and how there was no offer to give me a new plate. Hoping management can make this right.
Kathryn H.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Bad service, long wait to be seated, took too long for food to arrive. waitress was picking her nose! stay away, stay away.Don't bother. The food is not top notch, but the prices!!! through the roof. better off at a good taco shop. I think they need a visit from Restaurant Impossible"
Jason D.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,,1.0,11/17/2016,I arrived at Cheesecake Factory today at 11:45am for lunch and figured I could be in and out by 1pm seeing how there was no wait. We ordered a chopped salad and jambalaya pasta. Tried to cancel my food order at 12:50 because I had to be out by 1pm. When I was able to finally flag someone down they said let me go check and came right back with the food.i can't see pasta and salad taking almost an hour to make but I guess so at Cheesecake Factory. Won't be back!
Emad A.,"Spring Valley, CA",3,107,325,5.0,2/12/2017,Always been a big fan of their food. It's probably One of the best restaurants ok out there went with my family we had a great time and also their drinks are amazing nice place to hang out they always have a great options for my wife since shes vegetarian and we have never been disappointed with their food and service. Call ahead of time to get your reservation because you're always busy.
Michelle J.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,27,,3.0,8/8/2017,"The food is always amazing, but it's the service that seems to be lagging behind. We waited for about 15 minutes for our table, which was not bad at all. We had a party of 7 and got seated at a table for 6. After squeezing in another chair that stuck out into the walk way (where I would get bumped into periodically by those walking by, which got old).  To make matters worse, once seated no one stopped by for over 20 minutes. I finally had to flag someone down to get a server. They seemed surprised we were seated where we were. A server finally stopped and took our drink order, but after waiting for so long we order food right away as well. Our food seemed to take a very long time even though we only ordered salads. All in all, the food was great."
Daniel F.,"Menlo Park, CA",34,1,,1.0,5/17/2017,"Totally rude and disrespectful waiter that was continually making small but rude remarks towards my friend and not only was he being disrespectful but at the end I didn't tip him for his rude behavior he decided to be even more rude and tell one of my other friends who let a tip to keep his change. Michael G. Need to be more respectful. I work for the city if I would have pulled a stunt like he did I would have been fired. Totally unprofessional and I don't think I'll be eating there again. Don't need to be disrespected when I go out to eat with friends and the same for my friends they don't need disrespectful staff members. Totally unexceptable and I'll make sure to let everyone I know what happen tonight. Don't need your team to be disrespectful to be disrespectful to my friends and coworkers. It shouldn't matter what religion you are! We should all be treated equally and fairly. My friend is islamic, I however am not but I respect his religious beliefs. So disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory."
Magz K.,"San Diego, CA",231,598,2477,5.0,1/14/2016,"Amazing atmosphere! Our waitress was very friendly and helped us out with what was there popular dinner dishes and desserts. The manager came by to see how we were doing, which we thought was very cool. We Did not have to wait too long to get a table. We especially loved our cheesecakes!"
Patrick W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",63,4,,2.0,3/12/2017,"At this location in Fashion Valley, my girlfriend and I order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta to go, probably once every 2 weeks on average. The way this pasta is prepared is so inconsistent. One day it's made correctly, the next it's horrible and lacks sauce and flavor. Today we ordered this pasta to go and there is no spice to it at all and barely any sauce. Very disappointing that the cooks can't prepare this pasta consistently."
Kathy T.,"San Diego, CA",420,347,2376,3.0,7/13/2015,"UPDATE: 7/17/15 - I received a letter in the mail from ""Ashley"", and a gift card, which gave me a gift certificate for LESS THAN the amount I paid on my 7/8 visit. Plus, this manager took almost 10 days to address my issue by sending the gift card. Pro Tip: Dine in ONLY. Don't get food to-go (except cheesecake). Original Review: I hope the GM sees (and cares enough about his store) to read through this downgraded review. I don't know what was wrong with the Cheesecake Factory on the evening of 7/8/15, but the kitchen cook & to-go people were waaaaay off point. I thought previous curbside-take-out problems were a thing of the past. I was mistaken. FYI, we learned there's a new GM, Rod. When I was last here 23 days ago, the GM was Gil, who is probably somewhere where he's appreciated. 23 days later..... What I ate: Turkey sandwich on French bread. It's my go-to sandwich and I sometimes get a craving for it. Not after tonight.  When ordering on the phone: I ordered my usual ""turkey sandwich"". What I got was a to-go take-out tray filled with green lettuce (no tomatoes, onions, or anything remotely related to salad accompaniments) -see picture of my 'side salad' .  It really wasn't even a salad. It was dry, plain greens, with the dressing on the side. Putting the salad dressing on the side was the only thing they did right. So, I get A HALF OF A TURKEY SANDWICH, which was practically tucked underneath the salad.  I really can't understand why they get this sandwich so wrong so many times. It's easy!  My sandwich was haphazardly made & shoved into a container full of plain, green lettuce. (See CORRECT sandwich from last review.) The girl who took my order over the phone said the sandwich comes with a side salad & soup. I chose wild mushroom soup, which is a fancy name for yucky (in this case). How do I delicately say my soup looked like someone had had the runs in a cup and put a lid on it. I guess if the shoe fits..... I'm serious.  Don't get the mushroom soup!  It was completely liquid, there was not 1 mushroom in it. Weird. So gross. (See picture of ""wild mushroom soup"".) I bet they throw a lot of this soup away when closing time comes. I tried calling the store manager last night, but was sent on a wild goose chase twice and never talked to a manager. So I hope he sees this and fixes the hot mess he has going on in curbside/kitchen/cook organization. It ran so smoothly a couple months ago. Please be organized!  I just spoke with ""Ashley"", store manager. She seemed to be a very young manager. I told her how horrible the food, the kitchen and take out staff were last night. Her excuse: She told me they got a lot of traffic from Comi-Con that night. The result of me trying to iron it out? Ashley said wild mushroom soup usually has a few pieces of mushroom but is generally pulverized. Yes, it was pulverized.....completely!  Don't ever order ""wild mushroom soup"" and maybe they will take this monstrosity off the menu.  Ashley said they would mail me a $10 gift card, BUT not for the total amount of what I paid ($35.13). That's such an insult. And after giving a 25% tip (FOR TAKEOUT!)!!! That's funny! I understand that sometimes crap happens, but ALL THE TIME??? Cheesecake Factory, this bad service is getting to be a habit. Ashley's tone to me: ASHLEY WAS UNPROFESSIONAL, CONDESCENDING, & COULDN'T CARE LESS!  Guest satisfaction leaves little to be desired.  I hope somebody smacks me upside the head next time I mention going to Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake only ;)"
Carresse I.,"San Diego, CA",234,15,7,4.0,8/28/2016,Good service for a Sunday. It was a bit slow but didn't wait too long! Ordered the Hibachi Steak!
Vesta B.,"San Diego, CA",271,8,,5.0,2/11/2017,Our waiter Jason was extremely nice and friendly. Always asked us if everything was good or if we ever needed anything and it was perfect! He was super friendly and made my dinning experience amazing! Can't wait to come back! One of the best waiters I have ever had! Thank you!
Olga H.,"San Diego, CA",15,12,,5.0,3/7/2017,I came here the other night with a friend of mine and we met a lady that apparently goes here all the time. She said they treat her like she is the queen and she was right. The service was great. I was very impressed. I had the stuffed mushrooms and Thai lettuce wraps with chicken. So Good!! I finished up with hazelnut cheesecake. It was to die for.
SD G.,"San Diego, CA",27,267,1046,5.0,12/31/2015,I love coming here.  There's a nice ambience when you sit outside.  The service is excellent! The apple cobbler cheesecake is my fav.
Carolyn P.,"Dallas, TX",92,219,515,4.0,12/4/2015,"Food was good. I order the chicken , i forgot the name of jt but it was super flavorful and my friend ordered some beef which he enjoyed . Nice outdoor seating area."
Alyssa V.,"La Jolla, CA",606,109,28,5.0,4/1/2016,"I Love The Cheesecake Factory! Awesome service, this TCF is no exception, I have been a server before, so I know what it takes, but this TCF is the Nordstrom's of restaurants when it comes to customer service.  We all love and know that their menu is huge! Their cheesecakes are addictive and for me personally, for a cheat meal, I really love the lemonade so much so that I drink about 4 glasses whenever I go there, this was my lunch choice for a cheat day yesterday and I don't regret a single carb or calorie! :) I had a chicken sandwich, fries and soup, and we took cheesecake & cake home with us, because we were too full from lunch to enjoy our desserts there. My friend Kendra highly recommended the Linda's Fudge Cake and said she still had some leftover today, I ate my whole slice of Tuxedo cheesecake, no leftovers for me! Haha I'll be back in a few weeks to share that fudge cake!"
