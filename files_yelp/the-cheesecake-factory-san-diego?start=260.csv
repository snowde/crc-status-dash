Patrick W.,"Santee, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2016,Food took over 30 minutes to come out after we ordered (both tables next to us who ordered after us had their food well before us) and was cold to boot.  Definitely won't be coming back here anytime soon.
Evelyn A.,"San Diego, CA",104,337,241,5.0,6/2/2016,"Wait time sucks but it's worth it . The staff are always friendly , always accommodate you. parking sucks during the weekend but The food is amazing !"
Shelbey S.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,2,5.0,2/11/2017,The food was phenomenal. I order the shrimp scampi and it tasted amazing. Our waiter Jason was so great. He was very attentive and always had a smile on his face. He was also very helpful when choosing our cheesecake for the evening. We decided on the Oreo cheesecake and was very pleased. We left with full and satisfied bellies.
James T.,"San Diego, CA",222,68,830,4.0,5/28/2016,"This is our go to place for celebration.  We love to come here for special events.  It gives a variety of food choices for all our kids.  The potions are great.  The food is very flavorful.  The only problem is that there is a long wait and they do not take reservations.  We either have to eat really early for late.  With kids, it has to be early.  One of our favorite dishes is the pasta da Vinci.  Very yummy and my kids love it too.  And don't forget, they have great cheesecake to compliment the meal."
Food P.,"San Diego, CA",2,17,58,4.0,3/10/2017,There was a wait so we found a seat in the bar.  The food was great - service was great.  Time between order and food delivery was longer than normal.  But our awesome server and strawberry martinis made it all worth while.
Amanda M.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/11/2017,"My family had lunch there on a Friday afternoon. Family of 3, we were seated right away. Our waiter ""O"" was awesome! He was very attentive, friendly and had a kind demeanor. Two of three meals were great tasting. I won't order my meal again, tomato and basil flatbread. It may be just me, but it lacked any flavor. My sons raved that their meals were good, buffalo chicken sandwich and orange chicken. Of course you can't go wrong with dessert!! The cheesecakes are delicious, any pick and you won't regret it. The place is always busy, so be aware and patient."
Dennis P.,"Escondido, CA",707,125,579,4.0,9/22/2015,"Quick Tip: Kobe Burger is a must try. Get it medium rare. You're welcome ;) I'm going to show some love to their burger for this review. I'm sure you're asking yourself ""why did this guy order a burger at The Cheesecake Factory and why am I reading this review?"" Well, thank you for reading and yes, I ask myself the same question ""why a burger at The Cheesecake Factory?"" I'm so glad I got it. The only reason I got it was because my good friend, Brendon, who is also a burger connoisseur, recommended the Kobe Burger. If another fellow burger connoisseur says the burger is good, then it must be good! I had the The Classic Burger with Kobe beef and their brioche bun, medium rare. If you don't get your steaks or burgers medium rare...there is something wrong with you, or something wrong with me, but really medium rare was juicy, but not to the point where the burger juices are running down your hand. I can't stand a dry patty or a sloppy patty. This patty was cooked perfectly. The flavor and the texture of the patty was on point. The ratio to bun to meat was right on. The bun molded to the burger, making it so easy to pick up and put down. It puts a smile to my face when the bun can mold to the patty and become one entity, to join forces and enter the mouth of a hungry burger connoisseur.  The Classic Burger was hefty and I couldn't even finish it! I didn't want to disrespect the burger and it's ancestors, so I kept taking bites even though I was beyond full. Then I gave up because I forgot that I was at TCF! When at The Cheesecake Factory, eat like a Cheesecake Factory! wait, whaaaa? I got my burger with their house fries instead of the sweet potato fries.  I hope this review has opened your mind to the burgers at TCF. I've never had bad experiences at The Cheesecake Factory and I've been to over 5 different locations multiple times. So I'm glad to say that their servers are well trained, educated on their menu, and polite.  If you eat good food, then you will never eat bad food again. @dmagicp"
Hungry M.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"This is my first time writing a bad review. I normally don't like to give bad reviews because I understand that sometimes people had off days but my whole experience at this establishment was horrible. I have dined here many times over the years and I will not be coming back after this visit.  We were seated an hour and a half before our movie was started. I was two other people and only two of us were going to eat because the third person wasn't hungry. Our order was a pasta dish and ""The Factory Burger."" Nothing complicated right? Shouldn't take close to 40 mins to cook right? Wrong. We waiting for about 40 mins to get our food. The couple next to us were seated about 10 mins after we were and got their complete meal before we did. They had an appetizer and guess what else they ordered??? Two burgers. I had to ask the waiters twice about our food. This alone was not enough to make the dining experience unpleasant. I understand that sometimes things happen. What made me angry enough to write a negative review was the fact that my ""Factory Burger"" was nothing but bread, a slice of tomato, a slice of cheese, and a few pieces of grilled onions. The bread they used were the stale sourdough they typically serve you before you get your meal. It wasn't warm or crispy. It was stale and chewy like a rubber shoe. If you are going to charge people close to $13 for a burger at least toast the bread. That was the most pathetic ""burger"" I have ever had. I couldn't even finish it. Fed it to the dog when I got home. Jack-in-the-Box serve better burgers. Also, the pasta dish we got was bland and extremely heavy on the cream.  The waiters walked past our table several times. I placed my empty cup near the edge of the table so they would notice that I needed a refill. Nope. Not a single person noticed. I had plenty of staff members walk by our table and look directly at our table. I had to call them over for a refill. Come on now. If you are a waiter and you ""check"" on your customer's table you should have the common sense to look at people's drinks to see if they need refills.  I have been a loyal customer for years but I will not be coming back to this establishment in the future."
Ysabelle V.,"Murrieta, CA",0,1,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"I love cheesecake factory but the service here was horrible. Our waiter (Thomas) was not friendly towards us and I felt that he was treating the other tables differently. We were trying to order more from the menu but it took him 15 minutes to finally take it. He was constantly going to the other tables next to us but did not even take the time to check on us. Also, the water and utensils given to us looked dirty. Other than that, I can't complain about the food."
Arlene T.,"San Diego, CA",0,42,,4.0,8/9/2017,"Absolutely sinful!!! The ahi tuna here is wonderful...and I am very particular on ahi and any sushi.  Went here early afternoon and the place was bustling and louder than usual so not so great ambiance. But, the food was amazing and very generous portions. Did not have room for dessert but ordered them to take home. Cheesecake so smooth and chocolate cake is very rich-great for sharing!!!"
Anthony M.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,5.0,3/4/2017,"Despite the long wait the food was astonishing! I ordered my usual the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and I was very pleased. I also ordered the Asian and Mexican lettuce wraps and they were good as well. The one thing I was pleased with the most was with the customer service by my waiter Patrick. He was very attentive and did everything right! I know for a fact he's going places. Last but not least, great food, great customer service, 5 Star Restaurant in my opinion. Till next time...."
Vivian H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",23,40,7,1.0,10/1/2016,"The service here is terrible. I love the Cheesecake Factory but the service at this location is abhorrent. First my waiter treats me different than the people next to me. I can hear and see the differences, he makes sure they have everything they need but I only got asked if I was ok once. Then my food came wrong and my waiter didn't even care."
Joel C.,"El Cajon, CA",13,85,,4.0,12/4/2016,"I wanted to try the food there at the Cheese cake factory yet the many different flavors with so many flavors many restaurants try to out do each other but cheese cake can only be done a certain way to keep its flavor and sweetness.With cheese  cake factory they have gone through and cheese cake to give it full flavor and to combine it with other flavors such as cherries and strawberries and chocolate.    When I had come to the restaurant I saw the menue at the door it had many Items that seemed very Interesting and very good to have for lunch different kinds of hambergers and appetizers that looked very good and some of the main dishes looked very confusing not listing very much kids in the area of the menue.When I went the main door there was no greeter yet there was a small amount of people at the hostess desk that when the hostess asked me how many she a slight attitude and she said the wait would be about 20minutes so I went through and sat and waited while other people got seated before me,     When I checked the time its was thirty minutes past the time that she lead me to an outside table that I had requested an Inside table she said my server would be out to me in just a few minutes smelling the car fumes was a turn off to be outside table it was a young man that came to my table said to me can I get you something to drink I will start with a coke be right back sir.The service was very good and when he asked me about food I asked him about food you serve fried  mac and cheese yes sir its a very good appetizer , and he also told me that me that the burger would great also  I told him perfect.     When the meal had arrived the food plates were very hot and everything looked great looking at my schedule it gave me two hours to have a nice lunch to sit and relax the food had full flavor wasnt overcooked the cheese very good, and the mac and cheese appititizers that were very hot also.MY waiter had told me about the new cheese cakes they have the new new of Lemon Chiffon Cheesecake when he brought it over that had whip cream on the side when I had tasted it the flavor was just Incredible and the flavor mixed with the lemon made it just Incredible.      Yet with that location there needs to be more staff and direction from the manager on the floor staff that from some of the staff I have seen are very good but there are many others that still need more work."
Nancy H.,"San Diego, CA",214,493,1045,5.0,4/27/2016,"always love the Cheesecake Factory and this location didn't disappoint. the bread was warm and fresh, our entrees came in a timely manner and our server, Jason, was friendly and efficient. the stuffed mushrooms were a great appetizer and the lunch sized pastas are awesome!"
Niki P.,"Houston, TX",12,34,150,5.0,1/18/2016,"My husband and I were in town for our anniversary. We went to this location due to it's proximity to the mall.  Our visit was great, even for a busy Saturday night! The staff were all polite and very accommodating. The food came quickly and tasted delicious! The patio ambiance was very romantic with all of the fires going and providing warmth during a chilly December night.  We will defiantly go back."
Joanna T.,"San Diego, CA",115,172,288,4.0,8/16/2015,"My favorite things to get here are the chicken romano and banana cream cheesecake. Also try the chicken costaletta.  The portions here are huge and I usually just eat half of my food and take the rest home. For lunch, you have the option to order the lunch size.  Be on the look out for National Cheesecake day where every slice is half off. Limit one per customer though! You can also sit at the bar if you only want to order cheesecake to eat there. Or you can get a slice of cheesecake to go!"
Marshall M.,"Goose Creek, SC",24,7,,4.0,2/9/2017,"Obviously, being a Cheesecake Factory, the aesthetics are going to be good. My waiter was good, the time it took to prepare my food was on par. The food itself needed something, I ordered the bacon-bacon burger with French fries. The burger was well... average, though it had this smaller disc of meat inside that I was not a particular fan of, the fries were again average. They did give me a basket of 2 pieces of bread and those were good, but not great. A good place to go if you are not a good snob or are just there for an occasion. Prices were as expected, slightly on the expensive side but not too bad. End result: B+"
Maddie M.,"San Diego, CA",396,249,655,5.0,5/28/2014,"Memorial Weekend: CHAOS! But... I almost felt like VIP because I greeted by the host and less than one minute, we were seated down with a waiter waiting to take our drink orders! Wait!! Do we look like celebrity look-a-likes?! Don't think so, but got outstanding service!! The hardest and most frustrating thing about Cheesecake is deciding on WHAT TO EAT! When you're starving, everything sounds delish, but I settled on the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta! I laughed when he brought the plate because it looked like one of those giant salad bowls filled with pasta galore!! The difficult part about the pasta was trying to not make yummie noises while eating it because it was delicious! It was something different, but amazing!  You would think that would be enough!! But we decided to save our leftovers for a midnight snack and get the Chocolate Brownie Sundae! We didn't order any alcoholic drinks, but we got chocolate wasted from this! I took a few bites and I was done, a bit too much for me! I would rather have something light and fluffy, not really dense considering I just gorged myself on carbs!  If you're a SoCal resident, everyone knows Cheesecake is just a classy version of BJs & better!"
Cynthia R.,"Oceanside, CA",80,3,,1.0,2/20/2017,"I came to this location on Saturday 2/18/17 around 3:45pm. I went to the Women's restroom around 4:00pm and notices that the stall I was in was very very low on toilet paper. I let the girl waiting to take my stall out of courtesy in case she wanted to wait for a different stall. The bathroom itself looked dirty and the trash was overflowing. I let the hostess with long light brown hair know that the restroom was very low on toilet paper and continued to wait for my table. Around 4:40pm I heard 3 different women complain to one of the managers that the Women's bathroom was disgusting and had NO TOILET PAPER! These women were all very angry, one even complained that her son was literally on the toilet waiting  for someone to bring toilet paper for over 10 mins. This got me very irritated especially since I told the hostess at 4:00pm that the toilet paper was running low and now it was 40 mins later. The manager was apologetic and got people in there to clean up and restock but still this shouldn't happen ever especially considering the amount of employees working at the time. Makes you question how often they check on the restrooms. If I would have been that hostess, I would have gone in there myself and resupplied the toilet paper or alerted the manager right away to get someone to do it ASAP. This could have been avoided.  Our server Ellen was great so she would get a 5 stars from me. The restroom situation doesn't even deserve 1 star."
Kenny D.,"San Diego, CA",134,8,,5.0,2/18/2017,"I live down the street from this cheesecake location and have now been here multiple times. Every time I have been the service has been great (both bar and restaurant) included. They have the largest menu ever created, full of delicious deserts and cakes! Cocktails were tasteful and on time as well!"
