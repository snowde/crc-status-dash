L P.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,53,14,5.0,2/16/2017,Party of 16 with 10 kids and waiter TJ was extremely patient. We weren't the easiest party to deal with and he gave us service with a smile. Great job!
Alex K.,"San Diego, CA",8,45,22,4.0,10/18/2015,"Came here 12pm on a Sunday and it was pretty busy I must say. However, with that in mind, my wife and I were very pleased with the quick and efficient service. We sat at the bar, which is open seating, and we were greeted almost immediately. My wife ordered the Mai tai and I got the Flying Gorilla. The Flying Gorilla is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. It's a giant chocolate milkshake with alcohol which is perfect for me. We were very pleased with our drinks. My wife ordered the avocado egg rolls and I ordered the smokehouse BBQ burger. Both were very satisfying, perfectly cooked, good flavor. Drinks were a bit pricier than I was expecting, but they were pretty big so I guess I can't complain. $60 for 2 drinks, 1 entree, and 1 appetizer is a bit more than I wanted to spend on lunch but at least it was good.  I'll probably just stick to the dessert to go from now on."
Courtney O.,"San Diego, CA",584,640,561,4.0,7/10/2015,"Who doesn't love this place? They have a menu the size of a dictionary with what feels like a million different types of cheesecake flavors. Everything is delicious! Yes, the calorie count on the majority of these items is outrageous but why not live a little.  My new favorite item is the pasta with shrimp and sausage. It's so good!! If you come during lunch, they have more affordable lunch size portions. My favorite type of cheesecakes are the red velvet and Oreo. I've also been told that the banana creme pie is also out of this world."
Gigi L.,"Coronado, CA",279,289,341,1.0,6/11/2015,"We sat down and ordered lunch. We were having a working lunch. Don't go there if you think they care about your meeting needs.   We asked the server for a seat near an outlet so one of us could charge our laptop. They said they didn't have one so we sat and worked until my friend's laptop was dying and we were about to lose much of what we had been working on for an hour while we waited for our food.  So then we asked if they could take the laptop to wherever there was an outlet and plug it in for us.  They said ""we have no outlets available to you.""   I was in total disbelief.  Am I really expected to believe they have no outlets? Is that how much they value their customers?  We have been in there several times because we like to have working lunches but this waiter was so rude (he was very young) that we won't make their mistake again. I will say their tuna salad was excellent and we love their Mojitos! Sad not to be able to suggest we go there again."
Rami H.,"El Cajon, CA",78,134,362,4.0,7/6/2015,"Great Place for great times. I really enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory. Very very good delicious food for  reasonable prices. Staff are very nice and professional. I love their Pasta, and my favorite one there is the PASTA WITH CHICKEN AND SCAMPI SAUCE, but I always substitute the chicken with shrimp. Their cheesecake is the best off course with all different flavors. Last time I ordered the MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE and it was delicious. My only negative point about this otherwise perfect restaurant is the fact that they put the silverware on the table instead of putting it inside the napkin like most restaurants do so if the table is not clean, bacteria can be on it which is a health risk  I am not welling to take"
Bree G.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,12,5,3.0,7/15/2017,I went later in the evening so it was pretty crowded when we got there. The wait wasn't too bad but once we were seated it felt like my family and I were forgotten about. It took a long time for someone to come over a greet us and get our drink order. Our appetizer was fine but all of us ordered salads and they were dry and not as tasty as they could have been. We also got the 30th anniversary cheesecake but no complaints there. It's definitely one of the best ones on the menu. I'd go back another day just would have more patience.
Curtis C.,"Queen Creek, AZ",44,129,116,2.0,3/17/2016,Typically a fan of cheese cake factory. But tonight was a downer. Burgers are really not close to quality of the price they charge for them. My wife ordered a bacon burger and the bacon was black. Asked for new bacon and 20 minutes later were told they are out of bacon for the next 30 minutes. Lmao. Fries tasted old. Will not get burgers from here again.
Connor H.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,9,1,4.0,2/8/2017,"Sat at the bar last weekend and ordered a beer and the Parmesan cheese bread! Beer was cold and tasteful, and the cheese bread was absolutely delicious. Only stayed for 30 minutes because I was in a rush, but next time I will stay much longer, good customer service!"
Holly W.,"San Diego, CA",61,110,77,1.0,4/30/2015,"as much as i love this place and the food, its always packed, understaffed, they never have enough food to cater or cover the entire menu of items. So they are always out of something and  when i ask for a table for outside they tell me that all the tables inside was going to be ready in 20 minutes.... and a tables outside were ready in 45 minutes.... I have counted 8 ..... EIGHT empty tables outside. Absolutely ridiculous. Ive attached a photo too."
Lolo L.,"San Leandro, CA",0,14,13,1.0,7/13/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been too. The restroom had tampons on floor, no toilet paper in any of stalls we had to use paper towels toilet seat are filthy. Then to top all of the chef burned my kids pizza so we had to wait so long for his food to come from the kitchen  Forgot to mention that my family was traveling and the next time we are out this way we will not return to this Cheesecake Factory by far the worst one that I have ever been too"
Margaret W.,"San Diego, CA",46,96,458,5.0,6/13/2016,Super yummy Miso Salmon is always a winner! Love the menu selection & of course Cheesecake!
Patricia Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/25/2017,The last time I went to eat at this site at friars Rd. The service was horrible. My friend and I were seated and we waited about 15-20 minutes and none of the waitresses asked us if we wanted a drink. I brought that to the attention of one of the waitresses that was passing by she got our drink. She did not know which waitress was assigned to our table. I complained to the manager. Finally someone was assigned to us. The manager wasn't to apologetic. I will not bother to eat at this location ever again. :(
Jorge M.,"San Diego, CA",1,22,4,5.0,8/3/2016,It's a must in San Diego. The menu is huge and everything is very good as well as the service. There's usually a long line during the top hours but you can make reservations. The cakes are great.
Shaina F.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,2,2.0,8/25/2016,"I'll start out by saying I've never had an issue before at this Cheesecake Factory and come on, it's the Cheesecake Factory! Regardless of the +100000 calorie count, it's always pretty good comfort food. However, last night I had a really disappointing experience that has caused me to rethink going back to this location.  My mom and I ate dinner at around 7 pm and right when we sat down we ordered. My mom ordered the sliders and I ordered the garlic noodles. The food was taking a little while but I get it, Cheesecake Factory is always busy, so why not give them the benefit of the doubt? 25 minutes later the sliders arrive, but no garlic noodles. A waiter comes by and tells me the garlic noodles will be right out. 10 minutes pass and another waitress comes by and says the noodles will be right out. Finally our waiter comes out and tells me the kitchen made a mistake and the noodles were delivered to another table. Is that really the kitchen's mistake, or the server's? Hmmm... 10 MORE minutes go by and the manager comes over and apologizes for the delay. She tells me the noodles were delivered to another table and the patrons at that table ate the noodles. Fine, it happens. She asks me if I want a soup or salad; I decline. The noodles came out shortly after that and after waiting almost an hour for the noodles, my appetite wasn't what it was when I first walked in.  The check comes and the noodles were still on the check. Now perhaps I sound like a cheapskate, but one would think taking a $14 meal off of a check in order to provide good customer service shouldn't be an issue. How about offering a slice of cheesecake? Nothing. Just a few half-assed apologies and excuses and an hour of waiting for noodles. What a disappointment."
Teka L.,"Studio City, CA",14,10,27,1.0,8/22/2016,"Okay I have to say this is my favorite chain restaurant to eat and I've been to Cheesecake so many times, but this have been the worst experience ever with them. I am always satisfied with the food and the service, but this time the server made my experience horrible he was very rude and had a nasty attidute his name is Casey at the fashion valley mall location. I believe it's the management team that's not very strong that causes this location to have have such bad service.I say this because I had another bad experience prior, for take out, on two different occasions. I work there and have a 30 minutes lunch I called to place my order and was put on hold for 10 minutes and no one came back to the phone, I even walked over there and showed the manager my phone (while I was still on hold) and did not even get an apology."
Karin J.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/18/2017,"I've been here 3 times and everything I've eaten here is delicious! The wait isn't too long, even when it's packed, and it's definitely worth it.  The mushroom burger is amazing and so is their four cheese chicken pasta.  :)"
Anne C.,"San Diego, CA",1421,593,4114,4.0,4/12/2014,"Right next to Fashion Valley Mall... This location has a lovely outdoor patio area... Just like any CF, very clean and busy. We arrived for lunch on a wed at 11:30 and it wasn't busy yet. But most tables were filled by the time we left around 1:30...  Our server was friendly. He came out with our drinks and bread fairly quickly. If you have kids, definitely ask for a kids menu. And remember even their kids menu gives generous portions My 2 kids shared one). Their pastas are all pretty good. The Alfredo is al dente with a good amount of sauce. My husband likes their farfalle (bow tie) pasta With more of an olive oil base. Their salads are always tasty, lunch portions are also a good size. We ordered to go, and they even included a couple small loaves of warm bread!.... We ordered the classic cheesecake with strawberries and Oreo cookie cheesecake. Tastes like strawberries and cheesecake, and Oreos and cheesecake (duh!)... 6 of us shared these 2 slices and there was still some left!..."
John S.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/22/2017,Waited over an hour past our quoted time and the host up front were super unprofessional laughing in everyone's faces that asked how much longer not even myself but all parties he was rude to young looking white male looks 16 years old. For a fine dining restaurant like that just would expect some more professionally trained host considering they are the greeters/ first impression of your restaurant
Carlos V.,"San Diego, CA",118,62,39,4.0,7/2/2016,My girlfriend brought me here for a pre bday celebration. This place gets really crowded and there seems to always be a line. We waited about 10 minutes before we got seated so it wasnt bad. I was in the army and all you do is wait everywhere you go. So i dont mind waiting. We ordered calamari for the appetizer and two plates of the shrimp angelhair. I normally go to Italian spots for my calamari but decided to try it out since it was on the menu. I wasnt thrilled with the tartar  and shrimp cocktail sauce for dipping. The shrimp angelhair had more tomatoes  than anything else. But they do have some great cheesecake. Great mix to choose from. I had the raspberry truffle cheesecake and it was the best i have had lately.  This place is nice to take the family and friends. Good vibe and clean. Next time ill try something different when im in tbe area.
Christine K.,"San Diego, CA",1382,942,1673,4.0,4/10/2014,"I ate here yesterday 4/9/14 at about 7pm. I eat here probably once or twice a year. Every time I have gone it was EXTREMELY packed with families. I suggest if you go with a larger party to come earlier or to make a reservation. Since my boyfriend and I were only a party of two, we got seated within 5-10 minutes of entering. The hostesses that lead you to your table look bitchy. Ours just led us our way and didn't say anything. Oh well. Customer service I give it a 4. The waitress seemed sweet, a bit awkward, but attentive. She would try talking to me when I had a face full of food. But that's not her fault it was just a bad coincidence. My boyfriend go the chicken Alfredo pasta and I got the Steak Diane. It took a while to get our food maybe 30 minutes. I'm impatient but I don't think that was too bad of a wait. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. I give it a 5 for food. I'll be back.. Probably not anytime soon but it was worth if."
