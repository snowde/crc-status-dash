Amber G.,"Katy, TX",68,8,3,1.0,3/18/2017,"Food and the cheesecake was good as always. The 1 star was for the service. This was the first time my husband and I were able to get out together since having our second baby. It took a lot of coordination and prep to get away for a day date and it was ruined by our dining experience today. First of all we were sat really quickly which was great considering there was a lot of people waiting. We walked in on a Saturday at 2:15. Given 10-15 min and waited only 5. Great! Oh and side bar- it took forever to find a parking spot! But I know that is not CF's fault. Anyway we ordered two appetizers, I ordered a lunch size cup of soup and salad and husband ordered a pizza and a margarita. 20 minutes passed and I had to inquire about his margarita. Then about 10 min later one app came out then about 7 min later the second. Then we waited 30 more minutes for our meal. We were stressed because we were out against the clock with a baby left with only so much breastmilk to get through our date. An hour wait for a pizza, soup and salad! Then my salad was the wrong one! The waitress was nice and said the kitchen was backed up which I understand but it sucked. We ordered our cheesecake to go the moment our food came out which was brought to us right away. We won't be back, at least to this location. This restaurant is never not busy so the kitchen should be on it! Oh and we heard the table next to us commenting how the wait was ridiculous so we know we weren't alone."

Karen N.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/14/2017,"If I leave a restaurant frustrated for any reason, it calls for a less than stellar Yelp review. My experience today at the cheesecake factory in Fashion Valley deserves that rating many times over due to the server(Patrick).  I came here for lunch after 1:00 when it was relatively quiet. It took a long time for my server to come to the table and the rest of the time I practically had to beg for any service, including having my ice tea refilled 2-3 times. When I ordered my sandwich with sourdough bread. he had a ""can't do attitude"" but then told me I could have it on a sourdough baguette. He then went to another table after taking my order and chatted them up for at least five minutes before putting my order in. I know because I watched him. When he came by I asked him if he had put my order in before talking at length with the other table. Defensively, he said that he knew his job and acted very cavalier.  He did this over and over, keeping his tables waiting much longer than expected. I don't mind a server talking to his customers, but not at length or at the expense of the other people waiting for reasonable service. He just seemed unable or inexperienced in how to manage his time well. That's one thing but then to act as though he was in the right was very offensive. When my sandwich finally arrived it was not on the sourdough baguette. I was not going to risk another unpleasant interchange with him or wait any longer to have the order corrected. I left a more than reasonable tip in spite of his poor service, but I won't be back to this restaurant nor recommend it."
Robert E.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,5,4.0,7/9/2017,"Food and service are great, any dessert you pick will be awesome. It is worth the wait."
Nicole F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",24,38,21,1.0,9/2/2016,"Today we ate dinner here and the food seemed fine. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. Approximately an hour had passed and I  began to feel incredibly ill. My boyfriend is exhibiting the same symptoms I am and the only food we both shared was the stuffed mushrooms. Not sure if there is bad food handling practice occurring, but we both have food poisoning."
Ryan E.,"San Diego, CA",42,267,53,4.0,8/8/2015,"This place is nice. It's conveniently located in fashion valley and the wait is never that long. I always enjoy trying something new and this place lets you do it with an extensive menu. The food is usually on point and always satisfying.  4 stars because they seem to mess up on small things here and there. Also, still kind of expensive for what you get sometimes."
Amanda C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",68,120,3,5.0,9/11/2016,"You can't really go wrong with this place in my opinion. The menu goes on for days, although that can be kind of a b when selecting just one thing to eat, but everything is always so good. And the iced tea, it's like my crack, it's always got me coming back. Also love the bread - mostly the brown one. I know this is a chain, but I don't care, I still really enjoy it. Oh and the outdoor seating is wonderful in the beautiful SD air."
Thom H.,"Vista, CA",330,140,105,4.0,5/16/2015,"I really like that they have a 'SkinnyLicious' menu.  Everything is under 590 calories.  The portions are smaller, but the food is delicious.  I had the Turkey & Avocado Sandwich, which includes bacon.  Cuz of that, I did not feel so guilty ordering the cheesecake. Our waiter was Joe.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu.  One of my friends asked what he preferred and why.  He not only told us what he liked, but why and how the food was prepared.  It was obvious to me that he really enjoyed his job and did his homework.  I have not seen that before, ever.  He was personable and friendly. My Turkey & Avocado Sandwich was very tasty, the bun was fresh, they did not skimp on the ingredients. I'd order it again. For dessert I had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  Very good, but I really did not taste the Reese's.   My friend ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake.  Now that was delicious.  Three of us ordered the cheesecake desserts and shared.  That is the way to do it. I'll be back."
Veronica V.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",8,13,6,1.0,8/17/2016,"This was so disappointing!!!! the worst 100 bucks I ever spent I get its busy during lunch, but that is no excuse for bad food it took 1 hour for the appetizer. Another 40 minutes for food. I was ok with how long it took until I tasted my food, I had the chicken Alfredo past and my noodles very overcooked and mushy sauce tasteless and dull. I am normally not one to complain but if I'm buying a $20 dollar pasta dish at least make it good."
Lauren C.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/17/2017,Incredibly rude hostess! The face of the restaurant should have exceptional customer service!
Amanda E.,"Concord, CA",0,31,25,4.0,6/4/2016,"You can expect a certain standard when going to the Cheesecake Factory... When it comes to the food and drink. Service this last time we went to this location was inconsistent. Waitress was wearing sunglasses. I understand we were sitting outside but no other waitress was wearing sunglasses so I just felt like we got stuck with the waitress that didn't care about how she looked (as she was also wearing a cotton headband and a loosely tucked shirt.) I kept getting the feeling that she was planning on walking off the job at any minute to quit  we were just her last table. Kinda awkward.  With that being said, my blood orange mojito was perfect as was the barbecue chicken salad and the club sandwich my boyfriend got.  All and all we just wished the guy who crushed pepper onto my salad would have been our waiter instead."
Nancy M.,"Chandler, AZ",22,463,730,4.0,7/27/2015,"Carol D. was a fantastic server!  We enjoy Cheesecake Factory and almost always have a positive experience.  The food is good, the service is good, the environment is nice, and the menu has a wide variety to choose from (almost too much).  Be prepared for a wait, however.  Very rarely have we arrived and not had to wait for a table. It's popular (and for good reason) so you must bring your patience with you."
Shar M.,"San Diego, CA",229,232,396,5.0,3/27/2015,"My friend gave me a gift certificate for my birthday to the cheesecake factory so I took my little sister there to help me spend it.  We arrived somewhere between lunch and dinner so there was no wait. The parking was still a little bit challenging since it was right next to the mall but eventually I found a spot right upfront.  The place smells like amazing garlicky food and made my mouth water. We got a little table in the corner and decided to get smoothies and tropical flavored iced tea to drink. The menu is really extensive so it takes a while to read through. So many amazing options, but finally settled on a pear Gorgonzola salad along with the lemon garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta. It was definitely enough to share for two girls and still leave their full. But that didn't stop us from ordering cheesecake, just had to order it to go :-) The snickers cheesecake is   FYI"
Moe T.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,40,9,1.0,1/17/2016,"Idk what has happened to cheesecake out here. But service was horrible, for starters the server we had looked like she had no desire to work... She got us our drinks and took off before I can even ask for anything.. Finally when she came back she had me order all my food at one time app and main course which was ok... But when I asked for ranch she got me ranch in a plate!!! I have never had ranch out of a plate... Idk how many people are in a party 1,5,10  or 20 you bring ranch in the right cup.. Finally what made things even worse was I ordered salmon and about 5min later she comes back and tells me all they have is the lunch size... We'll make a lunch size into a dinner?? So basically I then asked for a menu again and she rolled her eyes.. Idk how the food is yet since I'm writing this review while I'm sitting waiting for food..."
Robert B.,"San Francisco, CA",492,82,64,5.0,7/18/2015,"Went here for a dinner date with my significant other and it was great. Food came in on time, servers were patient with our indecisive ordering. Facility was really clean and the environment was nice. I usually go to a different Cheesecake Factory, but this was a nice change (kinda). ""Kinda"" because Cheesecake Factory is always great! Our server Brandon had great service, made dining easier. Never had to ask for anything. He was always on time. Would love to go here again!"
Liangcheng R.,"San Diego, CA",5,40,42,5.0,5/3/2016,"I went here a last Valentines day with my boyfriend and it was pretty good. Great service, food, desserts, and drinks. I got the shepards pie and a pina colada which were both fabulous. The atmosphere might be a little too dark though :)"
Santio C.,"Orlando, FL",1011,17,14,3.0,6/27/2015,"Not impressed! I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a couple of years. I usually love it but this time wasn't the best.  The wait was really long for a party of 16. Reservation was not taken, because they don't take reservations. So we checked in at 730pm got sat at 943pm! Even tried to expedite the wait by talking with the manger, nothing came of it other than it will be another 5 mins. Oh oh oh oh okay.... Too long Of a wait for a large party. So large parties, I wouldn't recommend.  The waiter, Franklin, was great and attentive and to add handsome! Lol  I ordered, my all time favorite, Louisiana Chicken Pasta and a passion fruit mojito. I mean, I haven't had this dish in forever and I was wanting it at this point! I was hungry and ready to chow down! The food took a while for it to come out but with 16 ppl, that's understandable!  However, my plate was hot and my food was luke warm and even had some chicken that was a bit cooler than room temp! Ugh but the hell with it I was hungry!!!  The taste of the food was like I imagined! Just cooler! Lol good thing I like cold food!  Will I be going back? Probably not with a larger party! There are other restaurants in the area I still need to try! Well that's until I get that craving for some LCP!! Coming from working in the industry, I would say overall, the wait was horribly long! The service from the waiter was great! The food, MEH! Not too impressed!  Not worth a 40 dollar bill for myself!!"
Joshua L.,"San Diego, CA",69,7,1,1.0,7/29/2016,"Broken Glass in my food. How does a restaurant have broken glass in their food? I came here with 5 friends for my birthday, hoping to have a good time, but that came to a screeching halt after finding a piece of broken glass in my dessert. And in the end, the food simply wasn't very good. I am never ever coming back here."
Alice J.,"La Jolla, CA",0,18,,4.0,6/25/2016,"Beautifully decorated restaurant, with good service.  Food is good, but there are some things on the menu I would definitely avoid."
