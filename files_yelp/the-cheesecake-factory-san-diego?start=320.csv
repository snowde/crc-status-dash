Kimberly R.,"San Diego, CA",6,22,12,5.0,4/6/2016,"I used to get their burgers until I discovered their spicy chicken chipotle pasta! It is well worth your money! It is topped with potato flakes & has honey glazed chicken, asparagus, red & yellow peppers, peas, garlic & onion in a spice chipotle parmesan cream sauce!!! The portion size is very generous, allowing me to have leftovers for the next day! If you are into foods that have a little pizazz in each bite, I'd suggest you try this dish(: The servers did a great job taking care of me! I didn't even have to ask for more water or bread!"
Elaine M.,"San Diego, CA",178,5,2,4.0,5/26/2016,"This is one of our favorite restaurants to indulge in sit down food with somewhat of a nice ambience.  We have tried A LOT of the menu items. My favs are... As opposed to spending twice as much on steak at Ruth Chris, I can enjoy a well cooked, flavorful steak here: 1) Rib Eye Steak 2) Filet Mignon (Medium well, butterfly cut) For when my palate craves pungent garlic.  3) Pasta Carbonara 4) Garlic Noodles Of the chicken options, I'd go with the crispy texture of the: 5) Chicken Piccata I favor the white sauces over the red (sometimes tastes too bland for my taste, almost like store bought canned red sauce with bits of meat.) The alfredo is creamy and buttery, but if you wanted to pick a red sauce, go with the: -Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic My favorite dessert picks would be: 1) Linda's Fudge Chocolate Cake 2) Dulce de Leche 3) Macadamia cheesecake Each cake is so decadent and rich, I could only eat 1/3 each sitting. I usually take the rest to go to either share or eat for dessert again the next day. Not a fan of their new anniversary cheesecake though because I personally think there were too many flavor combinations that didn't compliment well with another.  Also not a fan of their customer service, which was why I deducted a star. Almost 90% of the time that we dined there, the waiter/waitress seemed to be overly rushed, distracted (like chickens with their heads chopped off) and in 1 instance a newbie didn't know how to process my gift card and didn't bother to ask how to fix the problem or ask the mgmt for help. We aren't high maintenance picky eaters. I wasn't demanding that they baby sat us. I was at least hoping to get our water within the first 30 min of being seated (yes, it has taken that long before once. We noticed the time go by). Perhaps management should either provide additional relief to their bombarded staff or provide a smooth flowing operational system for the team."
Rick C.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,4,1.0,7/30/2016,This is for curb side only.don't do it you will be waiting forever waited 1 hour for 3 slices of cheesecake I don't know why they even have dum curb side I would of left but the lady came and charged my card 40 minutes ago please don't do it unless your very patient.
FeedMe A.,"San Diego, CA",3,101,40,2.0,1/31/2016,"Food is terrible, but the cheese cake is delish!!  I will no longer come for dinner.  For now on I'm just coming for cheese cake and coffee!!  Staff is friendly for the most part.  This place is overly crowded with tourist!  Too many baby strollers and rude people blocking the entrance to get in."
Nina S.,"La Mesa, CA",64,9,8,1.0,7/15/2016,"I loved this place until my chicken was very undercooked and bloody it was disgusting I had lost my apatite. I had took a bite because it's so dark inside, I couldn't see that it wasn't cooked and red. The manager apologized and gave me a side salad. She said they would remake it, she came back and said the chicken takes to long to cook if I wanted it without chicken? I said sure but if she could pack it to go and asked for the bill. We were still billed for everything we ordered except the side salad. I was so disappointed and I truly regret going to eat there. We could at least got a complimentary slice of cheesecake or they could have took my dinner off the bill. I most likely will never go back."
Arjay U.,"Alexandria, VA",1,169,154,5.0,5/1/2016,"Each time I come to Cheesecake Factory, I always order their Cuban Sandwich with their sweet potato fries so so good... Close to authentic I think and the ranch dressing is so yummy. Thanks CF"
Nick N.,"San Diego, CA",32,58,85,4.0,4/29/2016,"Lunch time! We ordered the Almond-crusted salmon salad and the chicken piccata in lemon sauce with angel hair angel hair pasta. The salmon was cooked well, not melt in your mouth good but it was tasty. The chicken piccata with lemon sauce though was phenomenal. I recommend it."
Maria C.,"San Diego, CA",1774,2890,8958,4.0,10/22/2013,"I don't come for the food... I come for the dessert!!! This round we arrived after 9pm and we were offered a table on the heated outdoor patio. It was a beautiful night so it was nice to sit outside.  Service can be a hit and miss here, and during this visit, it was EHHH... I've had better. We ordered the S'mores Cheesecake and I ordered a decaf coffee. WOW... Must order the S'mores. Very rich but oh so good!!! What's even better is that if you order this particular flavor, proceeds will go to charity! Dessert for a good cause!!!"
Hassan A.,"San Diego, CA",8,3,,2.0,9/3/2016,"First time ever eating at a Cheese Cake Factory. We were four people and I believe none were satisfied by the experience. First off the server got our order wrong and than came over to stress the point to intimidation and rudeness that we ordered something that we hadn't. Than my colleague just accepted the order and it was after accepting the order did the server offered to change the order. ????? Anyways, I had ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which is supposed to be their specialty. NOT. The pasta was overly salty and whole dish as a whole did not come together to satisfy the taste buds. Portion size was good to be fair. For dessert we ordered the cherry cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake. Cherry cheesecake was fine and pumpkin was fine as well. Trust me had better cheesecakes elsewhere.  Not worth more than 2 stars because of the entire experience."
Alandria B.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,3.0,5/12/2017,Since leaving the last review I have received a refund for the amount that I was overcharged and received a gift card in addition. Thank you guest services
Ian P.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,268,23,5.0,10/29/2016,Over the years we've come to have a very high expectation of Cheesecake Factory and this location did not disappoint. The chicken piccata was absolutely delicious and the the strawberry cheesecake was also amazing.
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,12/23/2014,"This past year, The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) celebrated ""National Cheesecake Day"" on two days (July 30-31) instead of just on the last day of July. When I was in Hawaii, I always had wanted to go to the one Cheesecake Factory on the island for this celebration--in which you get 50% off a cheesecake for dine-in only--but I knew the Waikiki location would be absolutely chaotic (more chaotic than it actually is). But, I figured it was worth a shot going to the Fashion Valley Cheesecake Factory in San Diego to experience my first ""National Cheesecake Day"" ... and I just had my fingers crossed that it would not be too frenzied.   Much to my surprise, my dining experience at this Cheesecake Factory was better than I thought it would be. I met a friend around 7 p.m. for dinner; I came a little early to put our name in, and I was actually seated within 10 minutes. There were larger parties waiting to be seated, but the crowds were not as large (or crazy) as I imagined they would be.   I perused the menu while I waited for my friend, but I already have a few tried-and-true Cheesecake Factory favorites (including cheesecakes). Our server was attentive and friendly, and she brought us everything we needed without us really asking (extra water, napkins, etc.). I had a great first-time visit to this location and would definitely come here again. And, my friend and I were both happy to experience our first-ever ""National Cheesecake Day"" celebration with our discounted cheesecakes. Here's what I would recommend if you're dining here: ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"": This burger definitely falls under the ""gourmet"" category. It's unique because it includes a slightly flattened deep-fried mac and cheese ball (like the ones featured in the appetizer mentioned above) atop a charbroiled patty, Cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, an onion and mayo. I would recommend only eating half of this savory burger if you plan to save room for dessert. ""Chicken Madeira"": This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Again, if you're a cheese lover, you'll want to indulge in this savory dish. ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple"": Be forewarned -- this is probably one of the sweetest cheesecakes on the menu, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. Peanut butter lovers will especially appreciate the fresh dollop of peanut butter mousse that comes atop the cheesecake.  ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"": Even though this sounds overwhelmingly sweet, ironically, this cheesecake isn't as sweet as its close cousin, the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, because it contains layers of moist chocolate fudge cake in between the layers of cheesecake (versus layers of pure cheesecake). The layers of moist chocolate cake offset and complement the layers of cheesecake in a nice way, and peanut butter lovers will rejoice upon eating the dollop of peanut butter mousse atop the dessert. There are generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite candy) loaded in the cheesecake layers, and there are also thin layers of caramel. Finally, the crust is an absolute wonder, as it's covered with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as well.  ""Loaded Baked Potato Tots"": I think this is one of the newer additions to TCF's menu--I have never noticed tots on the menu before--but it sounds like a yummy shareable app. It features crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon and green onions, and it comes served with sour cream. Think of your traditional loaded baked potato skins ... but in tots form! I love tater tots more than fries, so I definitely want to try this snack-like dish one day. ""Bruleed French Toast"": I think this is what I ordered for breakfast on the first and only time I went to TCF for brunch on a Sunday. I did really enjoy my meal because I love thick-sliced pieces of toast -- alone, on a sandwich, anything. This entrée features thick slices of rustic French bread that's baked and grilled to a golden brown and topped with powdered sugar. Yum! I remember savoring each bite of toast, which sported a soft, chewy interior and had that crunchy exterior that tasted even better with the added sweetness from the powdered sugar."
Savanah S.,"San Diego, CA",447,27,46,5.0,10/16/2016,"Exceptional service from our server Kalyca , I'm probably spelling that completely wrong but sound it out and ask for her! She goes above and beyond and was such a pleasure to have. Best server ive had by far!! I ordered fish and chips and my boyfriend ordered the americano burger. Both were delicious and an awesome plus was kalyca was able to get us sides of chipotle mayo, which if you've never had it get it and put it on everything I even dipped my fish in it. Kalyca  also had recommendations for everything from drinks to entrees to cheesecake and shared her favorite modifications that set them over the top. I know it's not typical to request to sit in a servers section...but do it, you won't be disappointed."
Samantha D.,"San Diego, CA",3,22,1,5.0,10/25/2016,Ashley Greene was the best server! We came here on my birthday and I couldn't be happier! She was extremely professional and polite and we are so appreciative!
Scott S.,"Yucca Valley, CA",5,38,12,2.0,7/7/2016,"This review is for the to-go service. Tried twice in a month and both times they messed up the orders we had. Either didn't include chicken (in a chicken appetizer no less) or forgot all the sides (like all the dipping sauces for the texmex eggrolls). The food we did get was ok, but even for takeout the boxes and presentation was sloppy. I've used this before at other Cheesecake Factory locations and the service was great. I would not recommend using the curbside service at all at this location."
Steve D.,"San Diego, CA",69,142,54,3.0,3/25/2016,"Came down for lunch to celebrate a happy occasion with the family. Seated quickly and had a wonderful server. He was quite attentive to our group. My family loves to come here for the cheesecake. The biggest pitfall for me is that it is in the Fashion Valley mall which tends to be extremely busy and other than valet parking, it can be difficult to park.  Food: i had the Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp.- great sauce and flavor, shrimp was overcooked. Enjoyed the vegetables and brown rice with the dish. Wife had a sandwich and soup (clam chowder). She said that the chowder was delicious and sandwich as well."
Erika M.,"San Diego, CA",360,349,270,5.0,12/29/2014,I came with my hubby on a Sunday night and it wasn't as busy as they normally are. They have a parking structure right next door if their parking lot is filled (it's a tiny parking lot). Their High chairs and bar area is self seat so you don't have to wait for a table to open up.  My husband ordered the Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. I ordered my usual; Jambalaya pasta all shrimp. I loved my husbands meal bc you get salmon and steak for a good price! It was also delicious. The salmon had a zesty sauce/ flavor to it. The steak came with mushrooms in a yummy sauce.  Service was excellent and never fails here. Your waiters are always on top of refilling your glasses and continuously check up on you throughout your meal! I find this incredible for how busy they get.  I recommend my all time favorite... JAMBALAYA PASTA!
Theresa M.,"San Marcos, CA",152,54,22,2.0,3/30/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat! I usually come to this location when I'm in town and shopping. I love love love the Chinese chicken salad, the chicken samosas and the chicken farfalle. Those are my go to dishes! Everytime I've been here I'd say I've gotten 4 star experience. The wait time to get seated is always expected and I've always had a wait time of 15-20 minutes. Then there is a the wait time for your actual meal which ranges between 20-30 minutes. So if you're really really hungry beware! Today I'm rating this location 2 stars because of my server Timothy. He does not deserve 2 stars, he doesnt deserve any stars. His racist remarks (ask him about his foreign mother ordering story) and poor customer service skills were really offending and made our overall experience poor. I love this place and the food so 2 stars! But I will kindly ask for a different server if I were to return and have him again. I didn't take any of his remarks to heart, but it's a shame that a fine restaurant such as this place would hire such a hateful person, especially with all the tragedies occuring in our society today."
Daphne L.,"San Diego, CA",1382,1153,1103,4.0,10/29/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory because of the big selection! This place has great service and I know what I want every time and am never disappointed with my selection. I am absolutely in love with their Chicken Piccata and nothing compares with their lovely cream sauce and angel hair pasta.  Their gluten-free Godiva cheesecake is the most amazing and most decadent thing I have ever put in my mouth. My tastebuds party like there's no tomorrow when I eat this gluten-free delight. I highly recommend you come for lunch because the prices are pretty good for lunch!
AG D.,"Manhattan, NY",22,14,13,5.0,4/4/2016,"Our Go-to places to eat! Lunch and dinner, this Cheesecake Factory location is the perfect place. We went there probably like 50 times. And still will be keep going, because of their awesome dishes, cool staffs, delicious deserts!!  We wanna explore other restaurants sure, but if there isn't any good one that we know of, fashion valley Cheesecake Factory is always there to ace our expectation.  Downsides are parking, and wait time. But it was never a problem for us. Best way is to grab the buzzer and walk around the mall to see some shop and goes back to be seated.  Awesome place! 5 stars -well deserved!"
