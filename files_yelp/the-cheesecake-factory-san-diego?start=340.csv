Annie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",565,165,38,4.0,12/26/2015,"Yo, for a franchise I gotta hand it to them, their food is not bad ! Like there are probably a ton of shittier food options you could pick but you're bound to find something you like here since they've got a ton of stuff to choose from on their menu.  Your meal starts off with complimentary french loaves and this sweet brown oat bread and packets of butter while you wait for your food. French bread is great and all but its all about that BROWN OAT BREAD MAN. I could eat that all day.   For appetizers I recommend Avocado egg rolls, buffalo chicken bombs, SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES, or the corn fritters.  For entree I recommend the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Comes with sweet chipotle pasta sauce, tortilla chips for that perfect crunch, and penne pasta cooked nice and aldente. And its like a crazy amt of food. TBH by the end of the night, I kind of feel like im going to die because of all the carbs, but its a great choice when you are looking to binge once in awhile.  Only thing is that they don't take reservations, whyyyyyyyyy u do thissssss. And none of their cheesecakes are made in house btw. They're all shipped frozen from coorporate. If you still miraculously have room in your stomach for dessert, feel free to indulge in a slice but be aware that they are really heavy. I think one slice is enough to share between 4-5 ppl."
Daniel K.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",222,98,22,5.0,3/16/2016,"I always love going to the Cheesecake factory, no matter the location. I think that it is important to expect there will be a wait since they do not take reservations.If you plan to go to this location, check in right away, then you can walk around the mall. Keep in mind that the pagers don't go ""past the doors"" according to staff, so you will need to head back a little before the expected wait time. Over all my favorites are their chicken ceaser salad, and strawberry lemonade."
Bob T.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/10/2017,"So I go in to buy cheesecake for the family.  I specifically order 4 slices. I go out and something tells me the unfriendly cashier got it wrong. I look in the bag and yup she only rung up 3. I go back and say there's one missing. She doesn't apologize and with this attitude says I only rung up three ... I said I asked for 4... doesn't miss a beat and asks do you want another one with no apology or even hint of customer service skills ... already there so I get it and leave without as much as a have a great day. Forget this place, their food is NOT worth the hassle"
Dave W.,"San Diego, CA",1,172,,4.0,4/12/2017,"Food was great, service was great,. Didn't care for the closeness to other tables where we were seated. Something about hearing the person sitting at the table next to us breathing loudly, was a little annoying."
Ivory R.,"San Diego, CA",266,237,944,4.0,10/24/2015,"They have happy hour, cheesecakes and good food, what's not to love? Casual fine dining. This location at Fashion Valley can be pretty crowded and the wait can be awhile, but tonight (Saturday) it wasn't so bad. It's at the mall so parking is free. They give you free honey wheat bread and sour dough with butter while you wait for your food. The honey wheat bread is so good. They come right out of the oven. They have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu now full of meals under 590 calories. I ordered the soft chicken tacos served with escabeche vegetables. I'm not sure what the deal is with the veggies with tacos but it is a skinny menu. I didn't really eat the veggies. The soft tacos were decent. It was a thin tortilla with shredded ""spicy"" chicken with avocado, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. I was definitely going for the less calories option, so it wasn't the most tasteful taco I've ever had. I had to ask for extra salsa. I ordered a pumpkin cheesecake slice to go. It's delicious!"
Michelle B.,"San Diego, CA",50,171,742,5.0,5/12/2015,This is a great place for a date or to just get together with friends. Great food and drinks. The servers are great.  I love the chicken Madeira and so many cheesecakes to choose from.
Gino M.,"Mira Mesa, San Diego, CA",156,16,3,3.0,11/16/2016,"The food was really great! We ordered two appetizers, the egg roll sampler and the fried macaroni and LOVED it! Unfortunately, as nice as the server was, he never came around to fill our water, we had to wait 15-20 minutes to get our food, and when it FINALLY came, they had informed us that the food somehow got onto somebody else's table, so we would have to wait another 15-20 minutes. We ultimately decided not to wait and just pay for the appetizers. One redeeming quality was that they did decide to give us a complimentary slice of a cheesecake of our choosing. As unfortunate as the experience was however, the food was good enough to the point where we are still willing to come back and try the rest of the food we ordered!"
kayla s.,"San Diego, CA",45,34,,4.0,10/8/2016,"Went there for dinner tonight and the food was good. What was better than our food was our server, Brandy!  She was awesome!  Very attentive, kept our glasses refilled and checked on us every few minutes or so even though the restaurant was busy. We really appreciated her and hope we can request her next time!"
Rebecca G.,"San Diego, CA",43,22,423,5.0,2/15/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory sooooo much~! I love their bread (served before entrees), especially the whole wheat one. I ordered pasta with chicken and scampi sauce. The chicken was tender and juicy; and the sauce was just right~!"
Jilian B.,"San Marcos, CA",249,105,292,4.0,2/8/2015,"My boyfriend and I ate here for a date night dinner and were happy to have Lyn as our server! He was extremely accommodating, friendly, and checked up on us often.  We ordered the crab wontons, BBQ burger, Italian sandwich, and the soup of the day which was a loaded potato soup with bacon. Everything was delicious, I especially enjoyed the soup which was wonderfully carb-filled and cheesy. I did, however, have a difficult time eating my Italian sandwich because it was stacked so high. It was hard to bite into.  Of course, one cannot eat at The Cheesecake Factory without ordering a a slice of cheesecake! My boyfriend got the wild blueberry, I got the lemon raspberry which was nice and tart and had a bottom layer of cake which I loved.  We were  very satisfied with our dining experience, thanks to our awesome server, Lyn (might be with two n's? Lynn?)!"
Megan T.,"Hansville, WA",7,6,,2.0,10/2/2016,"Tonight my boyfriend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory, we come here often and this is the first time we have had a problem here. Our tall male server had to go on a break so a really sweet lady came and switched out with him. It ended up taking 30-45 minutes for our spicy chicken sandwich to come out. She had the manager come bring it to us and he spoke so softly neither of us could hear anything he was saying, he seemed extremely timid and not really the composer of a manager which could be the underlying issue. Anyways the bill came and nothing had been comped or discounted. A very light hearted apology was given. I am a server and have been for years. I would have 100% comped the food that was extremely late on an already $50 bill. Just a little disappointed."
Marlen G.,"Mint Hill, NC",96,10,5,1.0,10/16/2015,"I honestly never focus on negative things and absolutely hate to give bad reviews, but my last visit to the cheese cake factory was terrible.  First off, the place was almost empty and they made me wait to get seated as if the place was packed.  Then after seriously 15 min... Our waiter was still not there, we didn't have drinks and we were starving!  I was about to leave because 25 minutes and nobody ever helped us. I saw the host bring in new people to sit around us, and never even worried about asking us if we were fine or hey your waiter is not here yet??  Anyways waiter finally comes, we order what we want, I mean we had a lot of time to decide.  Ordered an appetizer which came before than our drinks!! Ridiculous.  Anyways then the food arrives and the chicken in my sandwich was kind of pink and the Caesar salad that came with it was horrible.  I usually always like everything at the Cheesecake Factory, but that day everything went wrong.  Make sure you have enough staff to cover every table... What a bad experience.  By the way this was on a Wednesday around 3 pm."
Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,819,4.0,6/2/2013,"I try to make it a point that whenever I review a chain restaurant, I only write the negative reviews; because, seriously, why would I bother saying, 'the Sausage Biscuit at Burger King is to die for!  Four stars, King!' It is, by the way.  That place is a complete shit hole where good taste goes to die in a festering cesspool of its own waste while baking under a constant and sweltering noon day sun.  But the sausage biscuit ain't bad... DON'T JUDGE ME! But, I digress.  Cheesecake Factory, I come here every once in a while, invariably with extended family for either a loving get-together or to cushion a sudden shock, and every time I'm always satisfied and impressed by whatever we get. Sure, the wait times can be insane, we got there at 6:00 on a Friday night and weren't seated until after 7:00, but it's kinda worth it.  This last time around, my girlfriend and I split a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and the Chicken Madeira. The salad was extremely fresh with a great and flavorful salsa garnish.  Despite the moisture of all the ingredients, the tostada shell below stayed crisp and deliciously salty.  And the chicken was well grilled, cooked to order, despite a crappy salad like you would get over at P.F. Changs. With the Chicken Madeira, the chicken itself was fairly breaded and moist, but it's the mushroom sauce that graces the top of it that really makes the dish.  Paired with Chessecake Factory's mashed red potatoes and grilled asparagus, and both of us were happily fed. Around the table was an Herb Crusted Salmon, simple but tasty.  Cashew Chicken, the only disappointment (a very mild one, at that) in my opinion.  FIsh and Chips, a staple of most restaurants that this one does a good interpetation of.  And Chicken Di Pana, that had a butter sauce that was surprisingly delicious. And then there's their namesake, the Chesecake.  Even the worst of cheesecake is pretty damn good; and the cheesecake here rests comfortably on the opposite side of that spectrum.  About the only complaint about the desserts, is that there aren't any that strain the realm of originality.  No chances are taken, about the biggest stray from the comfort of the tamest of palettes would be a salted caramel cheesecake (yes, Virginia, salt and sugar do go well together)... So, c'mon, don't hate too much on this franchise food stop in any upscale mall.  If anything, grab yourself a slice of Oreo Cheesecake for the car ride home."
Theresa N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,2,3.0,10/29/2016,"If you go any time around lunch or dinner during the weekend, there will pretty much definitely be at least a 20 minute wait for a table. Last time I tried, they don't do reservations more than an hour in advance, so keep that in mind if you're hungry. I tried getting around this by ordering curbside pickup, but even that was a long wait since the staff is so busy that time of day- I was on hold for 10 minutes to place the order and half an hour when I came to pick it up before I ended up just going in to bug them for my order. If you can get past the wait time though, once you get seated the waiters and servers are very welcoming and will go out of their way to get you what you need, despite how busy they are. Super friendly and accommodating staff! The pumpernickel (brown) bread is super addictive, so save room for your entree. My go-to is the angel hair spaghetti with shrimp; not too heavy but very filling. All of their cheesecakes are delicious but I can usually only get a few bites in and take the rest to go since they are so rich. My favorite is the vanilla bean with a side of caramel sauce. The price point is pretty high considering what it is, but they don't skimp on portions and the food is really good... So to summarize: PROS -amazing staff -good food -good portions -awesome cheesecake CONS -wait time -price point"
Tony J.,"Encinitas, CA",1,60,,2.0,10/1/2016,The food is good here as normal. I just placed a curb side pick up order. They told me it would be ready in 30-35 minutes. I got there a little after the 35 minute mark and called like I was suppose to.... 20 minutes later the guy comes out with my food. I look through it and he forgot a pasta. I asked if he could please go get it and  he asked to look through the food and asked me if I know what it looked liked??? It looks like pasta. I ordered 3 pastas and there are 2 here so yeah I knew what it looked like.  I asked three times including on the phone for extra bread and he forgot to do that. He brought two loads of bread for 3 pasta dishes and a chicken dish. He finally comes back with the missing pasta and no apology at all. Great service there!!! Pretty annoyed with the service.
Jenny C.,"Silverdale, WA",0,9,4,4.0,4/27/2017,"Ordered curbside takeout and took it back to my hotel. It was brought out to my car as soon as I called from the dedicated parking spot and the food was still hot after the two mile drive back to Hotel Circle S. The chicken Madeira was delicious, easily enough for two people. I appreciated that they included utensils and napkins since I was taking it back to my hotel room. The only slightly annoying thing is I waited on hold for about 10 minutes to order, understandable since it was dinner time."
Foodie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,133,11,5.0,7/3/2016,"Our waiter -- jason q. is awesome! He took such good care of our table and I have eaten at a lot of different cheese cake factories, this time was the best ! Employee of the month please !!"
Danika G.,"San Diego, CA",10,44,51,5.0,8/20/2016,"We had a great experience! The service was excellent and the food was delicious, everyone got what they ordered and everyone was very happy with their food. The portions were large and the lemonades were amazing! I highly recommend the Raspberry Lemonade - very tasty!"
Amber H.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,14,2.0,5/27/2016,"Awesome environment. Fairly mediocre service. For some reason company refuses to make reservations no matter how big the party. Called ahead a week, no deal. Two days before, still no. Thirty minutes before we arrived, and they still wouldn't even put us down on the list. When we arrived, they wanted all 19 of us to wait 2 and a half hours. Fucking ridiculous."
