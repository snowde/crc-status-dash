Fallon S.,"Berkeley, CA",1,11,,5.0,4/15/2017,"Ashley K. was our server and she was awesome. She made up for the wait. It was a Friday, so that was expected. I don't know about anyone else, but we loved her personality and care (and her super cute nails)."
Selma K.,"San Diego, CA",6,40,6,5.0,1/1/2016,"Major props to our fantastic waiter Scott. Tall, slim short haired Scott. He was attentive, prompt,  polite and just the right amount of funny and personable without being annoying. I wish Scott could be my waiter at every restaurant I dine at. Poor guy had to work new years eve dinner service but you'd never know by his service and smile.  5 stars just for service!!"
Mackenzie P.,"San Diego, CA",122,40,124,4.0,10/12/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is overpriced for what it is. They used to have giant slices of cheesecake for the same price they are now. I came here a few nights ago with some friends, and was disappointed by the size of my cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake is always delicious, but could have used a little more for what I paid. (Almost $8 for one slice) As an appetizer before hand, a friend and I split the avocado egg rolls. 6 came on a plate so we each ate three which seemed like a perfect portion since we decided to skip a main course. The dipping sauce is good and the egg rolls were fresh and hot. Again, a little overpriced for how many came out of you have a larger group with you, but tasty none the less. We sat outside on a nicely furnished outdoor seating patio with really nice heating lamps by each table. The atmosphere of the whole outdoor area had an unusually upscale feel to it. Really enjoyable to hang out with friends and have a normal volume conversation.  The staff seemed very friendly and inviting. Our server was a cute, sweet girl and was as hospitable as you would hope your restaurant server would be. I wouldn't frequent this place, but if a group of friends wanted to go I wouldn't turn it down."
Gabbi B.,"El Cajon, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/29/2016,"Went here about two weekends ago for Sunday Brunch and had an awful experience from start to finish, tried to contact customer service twice to share my experiences with them and give feedback, but no one has contacted me back.  Very disappointing, hopefully no one else experiences anything like this with customer service, or especially has a terrible experience like we recently had. After having the sever argue with me about the way I ordered my food as well as what the menu says it comes with; and telling him we did not have a good experience and him doing absolutely nothing about it.  Truly a disappointment."
S D.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/28/2016,Worst Cheesecake Factory when it comes to service. (Fashion Valley). Reception people are extremely rude. If people do not know how to deal with others they should not work in a position that requires them to be courteous.
Elaine L.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,9,4.0,10/12/2014,"As cliché as The Cheesecake Factory option may sound, their lunch specials are fantastic and it runs until 5:00 p.m. As a pasta addict, my favorite special is the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta.  If you like spice, bold flavors, and different textures, this is the pasta dish for you! I get it every time because it's absolutely delicious. It's a hearty, generous portion of al dente penne pasta smothered in a spicy chipotle parmesan cream sauce. The spice in this dish is more flavorful than it is packed with heat, so spice lovers rejoice. It is topped off with a medley of peas, onions, red and yellow peppers, crisp asparagus, and juicy pieces of honey glazed chicken. The vegetables are a perfect blend of flavors that really enhance the dish. It's topped off with slivers of tortilla chips for added texture and perfected with plenty of Parmesan cheese.  Drooling yet? Yeah, me too."
David G.,"San Diego, CA",1400,1079,2135,4.0,3/19/2013,"It's serious business when $100 worth of Cheesecake Factory gift cards comes your way. Just think of all that cheesecake.  Endless fatty, chocolatey goodness, gradually hardening your arteries until you drop dead from acute myocardial infarction. Sounds lovely, huh? That's why, instead of ordering a mountain of cheesecake, I spent my $100 on two consecutive brunches filled with salad and white wine. Don't get me wrong -- salad at the Cheesecake Factory isn't ""healthy"" per se, but it's still better than the alternatives filling up their War & Peace-length menu. Over the course of two brunches, I pretty much ran the gamut of Cheesecake Factory's salad menu.  Here's the list of what I tried: ** Tuna tataki salad -- seared tuna, avocado, mixed greens, tomato ** Chicken tostada salad -- grilled chicken, tortillas, black beans, corn, onions, cilantro ** Carlton salad -- romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, feta, avocado, cranberries, pears, orange ** BBQ ranch chicken salad -- chicken, avocado, tomato, cucumber, onion strings It figures that the salad I liked the *least* (the tuna tataki -- fairly bland) is the healthiest.  In fact, that one is on Cheesecake Factory's ""SkinnyLicious"" menu, meaning it's under 500 calories, so you can enjoy it without guilt.  (Unfortunately, every time I see the word ""SkinnyLicious"" in print, I gag a little.)   Likewise, the best of these salads in the least healthy (the BBQ ranch chicken salad -- very flavorful and satisfying).  It just goes to show that trying to eat healthy at the Cheesecake Factory is a lost cause indeed.   You can't go wrong with the chicken tostada or Carlton salads, either. I also had a cup of hot chocolate for dessert.  It was delicious, but I nearly cried when I saw that it probably contained more calories than the rest of my meal put together. Other random notes: ** Cheesecake Factory is always mobbed.  Brunch, lunch, dinner -- it doesn't matter.  Avoid the crowds and sit at the bar, where there's never any wait at all. ** Speaking of the bar, their $8 Riesling is excellent. ** Also speaking of the bar, the bar staff are a lot friendlier and less rehearsed than the waitstaff.  Chatting with them is a good way to minimize the corporate feeling."
Janet L.,"San Diego, CA",111,127,528,4.0,2/14/2015,"Seems based on other reviews that this may be hit or miss. Went yesterday with a friend to use a 3 year old gift card. We went in at 2:00 PM and the place was hoppin' but we did not have to wait. They sat us at a deuce and gladly honored our request to sit at a booth. I had the Southwestern Chicken Sandwich and it was EXCELLENT. The fries were decent, but not very hot and not well done like I asked.  My friend had the small turkey burger and salad and enjoyed it. The passion fruit iced tea was great. None of their teas are pre-sweentened, which is great because those sweeteners are junk anyhow.  The service was excellent. Nicole was our server and she was very articulate and for the most part attentive. I might go back if I know I don't have to wait and can find parking."
Chrys R.,"Jamul, CA",56,7,,3.0,9/24/2016,Came with my wife we had a gift certificate got our food ate and it was good we waited for like 25 minuets and had a little mix up after our pager lit up we waited an additional 10 minuets to get our table as did other parties waiting but to the staff defense it was a packed house got our food and  of course me and the wife shared a slice of cheesecake can't remember the name but it nice and rich eventually well go back
Anat A.,"Indio, CA",62,22,1,5.0,9/24/2016,Love the cheesecake !!!!! The best cheesecake that I ever eat! Love it with my capuchino
Rebekah S.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,2,5.0,10/8/2016,"We went for our anniversary and the food was great, but our server Giuliana was great!  She made a great recommendation for food, chicken with mushrooms, capers, lemon, angel hair.  The lemon raspberry cheesecake was great and Giuliana wrote happy anniversary on it for us and gave us a candle :) the Louisiana chicken/pasta wasn't my favorite and the white bread that they put on the table is hard and tough, but the brown bread is great!  Giuliana is possibly the best server we've had."
Yesenia H.,"Encinitas, CA",2,39,16,5.0,9/9/2016,"Had the best serivice by Lynn, not only was the service great but the food was delicious as well. I ordered the staek Diane, the meat was juicy and tender with the right amount of seasoning. This place does get really busy I recommend going on the weekdays to avoid the crowds."
Alma R.,"Escondido, CA",43,2,,1.0,4/6/2017,"This place gets a one star just because I can't give it a ZERO stars!!!!  Last Sunday I came here to celebrate a family members birthday, our party was about 20 people. I expected nothing but great service and food, but unfortunately it was totally the opposite. We had terrible service since we got there. Order drinks we got them an hour later. The food took even longer. My father in law ordered a medium rib eye steak that was 27 dollars!! But he got what looked like an 8oz well done steak that was cooked on a griddle instead of an actual grill!! Father in law has been a  professional chef for many years and knows his steaks so he decided to return it. Meanwhile everyone else tried to continue along with their meals. However, this simple act was an entire challenge all on its own as our server decided to disappear for the remainder of our stay. We NEVER got asked if we wanted a refill on ANY of our drinks. No soda, no water, no coffee, no beer. NOTHING!!! No one even came to ask us if we needed anything. We finished our diners and my father in law was still waiting for his steak. Another 20 minutes went by and the manager finally shows up to apologize but by this point everyone was done with the horrible service so we just asked her to give us the darn steak to go. When we finally got it we opened the box and found a larger piece of steak than the one they had initially brought out BUT it was cut STRAIT DOWN THE MIDDLE!!!! Totally unprofessional. This is by FAR the WORST dining experience we have EVER had!! EVER!!!  We can honestly say that we will never return to this location. PERIOD!!!"
Sevag B.,"San Marcos, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/21/2016,"I really do like this place and I've only been here twice but on my second time it took almost an hour just for someone to know we don't have a waiter and it was a gentleman who's nickname was O that said ""I see you guys have been sitting here a while with no service let me see what's going on"" comes back and says no one has this spot sir I'm sorry no one even knew you were sitting here but all see if I can help you"" which he did but I remember on the left hand corner of the menu if I remember correctly said something about good customer service well you guys be the judge I've wrote 2 yelp reviews my whole yelp life lol this is one of them and to top it off I called to speak to a manager to thank that guy O and tell them about my service at the well known cheese cake factory well the first time I called they took down my number and never called me back the second time they put me on a 16 minute hold till I hung up please somebody fix this because I really do want to go back and try again"
Keith A.,"Oceanside, CA",703,331,5347,5.0,2/4/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, I just wish there was one closer to North County San Diego.  This location is at Fashion Valley mall and the parking lot is ridiculously small but there is a small garage next to it too. I have been to some of their other locations including Irvine CA, Newport Beach CA, Glendale AZ, etc. They are always the same, amazing!  The food is always consistently good, very delicious. I like the chicken piccata, chicken marsala, Kobe burger, jambalaya, burrito,  and many other plates. The prices are a little high, but worth it, portions are usually generous, and the quality of the food is excellent. $7-9 for cheesecake and cake is expensive but it is great! They have 2 peanut butter chocolate versions too. They have a friendly staff, good service, and there is outdoor seating. If you just go in to get a slice of cheesecake to go, they don't have a good system or queue in my opinion. You have to wait to hear what slice they are calling out, they don't say your name, and anyone can just come up and walk away with your to go order."
Michelle Z.,"New York, NY",3,21,11,5.0,2/24/2017,The servers are always very nice and attentive. We are always served quickly and the food comes out great and promptly. Love this place!
Rosielle A.,"Murrieta, CA",30,31,5,4.0,1/1/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Wednesday night for my birthday and we didn't think that it was going to be so busy, considering that it was a Wednesday. Other than the long wait, our experience at this location was pretty good.  When we were finally buzzed for our table, we were seated outside and I didn't really mind sitting out in the cold, because they had heaters near every table. It's been a while since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory, so the menu seemed a little overwhelming to me. Anyways, I don't remember what my boyfriend ordered (it looked delicious), but I ordered the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and that was sooooo good! We ordered our cheesecakes to go, cause it was getting a little late for us.  Whatever cheesecake location I go to, I make sure to try different cheesecake flavors. Their cheesecakes are YUMMY! Didn't really get the indoor experience, since we ate outside (I guess the wait was a little shorter), but the inside looked really nice.  Parking can be a little difficult, but the parking garage is next door and just a walk away.  Service here was great, unfortunately I don't remember our servers name, but she was awesome. She was constantly checking up on us to see how our food is or if there's anything that we needed."
Samantha V.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,1.0,3/5/2017,"My first time going to the Cheesecake Factory was not a good experience! I needed to make reservations for a party of 12. So when I called to make a reservation they told me that they don't make reservations. So I decided on a Saturday night it might get busy so I showed up an hour early. It was around 5 I told them I had a party of 12 they said it would be an hour and a half wait. They told me it could have been faster if I made reservations which apparently they do only 1 hour before they open. So they need to clarify some information with their employees, I definitely did not want to sit around and wait that whole time. Also the place was so packed I could barley talk to the hosts who seemed way to busy to talk to me. They were ignoring me and more interested in socializing. I went in after an hour went by to check on how much longer It would be and she looked at me like I was asking her such a difficult question and with lots of attitude she said ""well you've only been waiting an hour, so"" the way she said it made it seem like an hour is not long time. Well it definitely it when you start getting hangry. I started noticing that people who were coming in after me were already leaving. 2 hours and waiting we finally get seated at 7. Then our waitress comes and let me tell you she was EVERYWHERE. I understand we were a big party but she was giving people the wrong drinks even drinks from different tables. The food took FOREVER to come out and when it finally did either it was food meant for another table or she forgot what they had and didn't even know they were missing it. I was expecting the food to taste amazing since it took forever to come out and I was wrong again!We asked for to go boxes and she forgot about that and so we reminded her twice and we never got them. It was basically pointless to ask again. The next time somebody invites me to go to this Cheesecake Factory I will definitely suggest someplace else. I didn't get the feel that they truly care about the customers. Definitely 1 star."
Matthew T.,"San Diego, CA",382,267,237,1.0,8/17/2015,"Upsetting that I ordered a full sized cheesecake (expensive!) to be picked up at 8:30PM.  I walked through the door at 9:00 and saw a 5 person line at the bakery.  Took almost 20 minutes to get to the front of the line, which indicated the staff is really slow.  Paid for the cake and proceeded to wait about another 25 minutes to get my cake because after they got my cake from the freezer, they still had to write with frosting on the chocolate plaque I ordered.  I have no idea why this wasn't already done.  I ended up spending 55 minutes there, when all I had to do was pick up and pay for a cake. Additionally, the staff member who wrote my birthday message in frosting had horrible penmanship.  I know it's frosting but dang!  I didn't even complain because I didn't want to spend another hour there.  I drove all the way to the North County location, calling on the way to order a plaque and telling them my message, walked in and paid ($3) and picked it up in about 4 minutes total."
April N.,"San Diego, CA",188,136,69,5.0,1/19/2016,Just celebrated my Mom's birthday here last week & the food was delish! They don't take reservations at night which is a little inconvenient but at least the service made up for it! Our waitress was super sweet :) I will be back for sure!
