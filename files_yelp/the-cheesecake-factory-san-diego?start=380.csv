Tim S.,"Surprise, AZ",111,1122,1495,3.0,2/9/2013,"3.5 stars.  Solid! This is my wifes favorite place in the world.  We had a gift card and decided to come down here for lunch today.  This place is a giant cluster F.  We put our names in and had to wait for about 25 minutes to be seated.  We did get a booth in a section away from all the madness so that was cool.  This is what we ordered and how they stacked up. Appetizer-  Avocado egg rolls.  These things were great.  My wifes friend always gets them and until today, I had never had one.  They are egg roll wrappers stuffed with avocado and some other stuff.  They were pretty freaking tasty.  $9.99 tasty?  Eh... debatable.  Cuban Sandwich-  You cant find Cuban sandwiches at most places.  It sounded good so I thought I would give it a shot.  It turned out to be awesome!  The bread was good (not a traditional Cuban sandwich bread), the pork, ham, cheese and pickles melded together.  It was a really good sandwich.  It also comes with a little cup of fries.  They salt the hell out of them (thank goodness....I hate places that dont salt their fries) and they were really hot, crispy and tasty.  Some real good fries.  I would definitely get this sandwich and fries again. Pizza and Caesar salad lunch special-  My wife got this one.  It comes with a large sized salad and a personal/small pizza.  The pizza was just meh.  The crust was way way way way too thin and it was droopy and greasy.  The taste was alright but the crust was so badly messed up it took away from how good it usually is ...so says my wife. Dessert-  We went with the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  Holy mother of GOD!  This thing was possibly the best chocolate dessert I have ever encountered.  This thing was a massive slice!  Here is the description straight from their website    "" OREO® Cookies baked in our creamy Cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and OREO® Cookie mousse. Topped with a milk chocolate icing.""  This thing was so creamy and chocolatey and rich and decadent.  Chocolate fudge, cheesecake, Oreos, cake, whipped cream etc....it was flat out amazing.  I may have to come back very very soon just to grab a slice of this awesomeness.  Overall, the food was very good.  A few things keep it from being rated higher than it should IMO.  Its always way too busy and the wait is long.  Its expensive too.  Even with our $25.00 gift card, the total after tax and tip still came out to $37.00.  Basically a $62.00 lunch.  That did include the appetizer and dessert but that is still a little expensive for lunch.  At the end of the day, that Oreo cheesecake was worth the price of admission alone.  If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate/Oreos, head on down immediately and grab yourself a slice of heaven!"
Dianna C.,"Oakland, CA",317,419,739,2.0,10/5/2013,"I actually really love the Cheesecake Factory.. However my experience here last night wasn't so pleasant.  I haven't been to the CCF in a long time so I was kind of itching to go. Since I was already shopping at FV mall I figured hey might as we'll stop by for dinner.  When we go to the hostess, they told us it would be a 50 minute wait. It was quite understandable though seeing as how it was Friday night and what not. We were willing to wait so we waited... It actually only took about 40 minutes for the two of us.  I loveeee their whole wheat bread!!!! I could just eat only that & be a happy camper. I know their secret! Molasses!! Yums. Anyway the service really sucked. The lady we had checked on all her other tables but ours -.- how rude. I kept staring at her to get we attention but had no luck. The food took pretty long to come out but it was so delicious. I got the garlic noodles with shrimp. I loved everything but the shrimp. It was very over cooked and when they deveined the shrimp the vein was still hanging on the shrimp.. Ugh gross. Btw I am sometimes allergic to shrimp & guess what? I'm allergic to the shrimp they used here ): I broke out in hives about 30 mins after finishing my meal. Sad. No more shrimp from Cheesecake Factory for Dianna.  Overall the food was pretty good. I love their fried Mac n cheese balls. We really wanted to get a piece of cheesecake but we were so gosh darn full! I love the portions here! You always have left overs lol. The Chinese chicken salad is also a favorite!  Verdict: don't get the shrimp it's cooked very poorly. But I guess that depends on the chef & it's not quite in your control. I'd eat here again if it was convenient."
Rory R.,"San Diego, CA",39,263,,3.0,1/1/2016,"Pros: 1.  Big menu. 2.  Haven't had a cheesecake (though the look good), but their milkshakes are good. Cons: 1.  Almost always a wait to be seated. 2.  Entrees were just average.  Almost as poor as Applebees or Fridays. 3.  Parking at the mall is always tragic."
Jkh D.,"National City, CA",57,24,27,3.0,2/28/2016,"Good dessert..  I love it.. however, the food not so Much.. Diane steak I thought it's good naah... got my order too late, it was cold n not so good.. I also taste the pasta.. same not so good.. but dessert love it."
Stanya B.,"Long Beach, CA",2,10,13,1.0,6/23/2016,"I placed a phone order to be picked up and I ordered a tomato and basil Pizza without sauce, due to my food allergies, and what I received was a pizza without sauce and void of flavor with the nastiest crust ever. I asked for the seasonal vegetables and received some cold veggie salad. I also ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo that was surprisingly satisfactory. I asked for two place settings and I received 2 forks and a spoon and a knife. I do not recommend a take out order here as I believe their commitment to excellence only resides with the servers who see you face to face. Once you are long gone all bets are off. Might I add that I'm out of town and had to walk a mile round trip for an unsatisfactory meal. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory. Clean up the take out."
Sarah D.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",502,10,,1.0,9/8/2016,"Every time I go to Cheesecake Factory I have issues with the service. Wether it's this location or the downtown location. On this particular night Damon was our server and after sitting for about five minutes while he sang happy birthday to another table, I've never seen anyone walk so slow. Brought our bread out before our drinks, we were sitting thirsty after eating some bread. The meal was fine dessert was delicious as always. I was just very annoyed at how slow he was, the way he talked and walked. As a server myself I would've done things differently."
Mitch W.,"Monterey Park, CA",961,856,7732,4.0,7/29/2013,"Long waits on a Saturday night!  We arrived around 8pm and there was an hour wait.  I think this location could have been 1.5X bigger given the waiting times. The decorations are like most other Cheesecake Factories.  The service here is on par with the best restaurants I've eaten at.   For this meal, we split the Chopped Salad and the Turkey Burger.  Both were excellent, but the Chopped salad was smaller than other locations that I have eaten at.  I'm not sure if it was just a one time thing or if Cheesecake Factory is making their portions smaller.  The quality of the ingredients is excellent and I always enjoy eating at the restaurant. We took home a Strawberry Cheesecake....delicious! Xie Xie!"
Mercy B.,"San Diego, CA",595,415,83,4.0,8/17/2015,"It has been years since I've been to a CF location. I've lived in SD for 7 yrs and it was my first visit to this one. I wondered if it would be as good as I remember them being since my palate has matured quite a bit in my major foodie phase the last 6 yrs or more. I also wondered if my foodie bf who just moved here from NY and wasn't familiar with this place, would enjoy it.  Yes! It was surprisingly good. Possibly one of the better chicken piccatta's I've had! And I am quite picky about my piccattas. Angel hair was cooked perfectly. The piccatta sauce was creamy, flavored very tastily and it had little lemon slices on top where they scored the outer skin. I cut them up and gobbled them with the chicken which was so velvety soft, it didn't need a knife to cut it at all. So deloosh!! Lunch portion was still huge! Something they're known for, big portions. It was around $12 I think.  The bf ordered some pasta with sausage and shrimp in a red sauce and really liked it too. I took a bite and thought the shrimp was cooked perfectly and I would order this dish myself.   My old favorite, the avacado eggrolls with tamarind-cashew dipping sauce hasn't changed a bit even though I have. They were super yummy we both thought.  Service was pretty good too. We walked in at 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon after going to the AMC theaters and I knew it would be crowded and it certainly was. But we were told it would only be a 15 min wait. Turned out to be only about an 11 min wait. Score!! Some corporate chains just do it right. This is one of them for sure."
Kim C.,"Rosemead, CA",306,67,19,3.0,9/10/2015,"This was my first experience with a Cheesecake Factory, and I think A-OK really sums it up pretty well. I don't have enough material for a usual long review, so I'll just sum up some of the basics. PROS: +Very nice interior +Decently friendly staff +Surprising selection of low-cal & budget-friendly plates CONS: -Service was pretty slow -Food was so-so, not great but not horrible -VERY loud at night, but I guess it's not fair to hold this against the restaurant -Seating for us was unfortunate and seemed like it was easy to overlook us ""MEH""S: =HUGE menu. I did not know about this before being taken here and it was really overwhelming to say the least! =Parking was a pain, but it may have been the day & time we went or bad luck. No points docked just because I don't know if that's the norm. Overall, this place was just alright. My flatbread was decent for the price, nothing to write home about to be honest. I would go again only for an occasion (which is why I was here in the first place)."
Bradley Y.,"San Diego, CA",2,42,1,1.0,2/21/2017,Ordered for PICK UP.... Cashier NORMA H. Had a total attitude!!!! The way she was trying to verify my order along with my simple reminder of my dessert! She totally gave me the look of annoyance!!!! With partially slamming my things!!! If you hate your job that much then QUIT!!!!!!!!
Adnan F.,"Chula Vista, CA",117,184,177,5.0,10/13/2015,Ever since this location opened I come once a month and enjoy a really good variety of food . The customer service is pretty good here never had a issue and always make our food taste really good. My favorite part is the view inside they made all the Cheesecake Factory look very nice.  I love there original cheesecake with strawberry and that's what they are known.  My servers name today was Claudia and was very patient enough to assist my two kids and give a outstanding performance for her customer service.
Brittany M.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,5,2.0,3/13/2017,"I personally love the food and the desert, but the service here at this location is terrible. Every time we've come here the waiters never pay attention to us. No matter if it's busy or not the waiters just aren't attentive. If I'm paying this much for food I expect better service."
Paz K.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/26/2016,"Aparently being young and coming to this Cheesecake Factory restaurant its the result of having a terrible service. This is the second time this happens when i come with my sister. The waiter didn't even asked is how the food was, he didn't even gave us bread. I will definitely never come back to this plac"
Giddy I.,"San Diego, CA",3,42,,2.0,10/5/2015,"We went there for brunch for the first time. Overall it was ok, but the breakfast potatoes are horrible. They are deep fried, oily and burned, totally inedible. I have never been served deep fried potatoes for breakfast. What is up with that? Unheard of and unhealthy to say the least. Also the menu does not stated how the potatoes are cooked or I would have asked for something else. The waitress was nice as she gave us other choices,but it does not excuse the fact that they are a horrible item. I tried to call several times, no one ever answered the phone. Finally, I got a hold of someone after 15 rings and when I asked for a manager I was put on hold and after waiting for over 1o minutes I hung up. Great customer service. NOT!"
Chang L.,"Yokosuka, Japan",936,572,1110,4.0,6/12/2014,"So you want to spend ALL your calories in once place? Come to the Cheesecake Factory.  The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for having some of the most calorie loaded meals. Do we outlaw these restaurants? No, we come once a year or embrace obesity. I'm still deciding myself. They have some decent appetizers. The avocado eggroll is probably my favorite. The tamarind sauce is very tasty and overall it's a unique dish. I almost always order a pasta here and if you know me at all I'm a HUGE gluten sensitive pasta freak. Their pastas have never disappointed me and I've been to multiple factories on the East and West coast and have tried almost all of them. The great thing about CF is that they are really standardized and you get the same dish wherever you go. Of course, no meal is complete at the CF without some cheesecake. Sometimes I am tempted to get the big ol' fancy ones with like 8 ingredients: chocolate, caramel, nuts, cream, raspberries, turtles etc, but I've learned the best ones are always the really simple ones. The original topped with strawberries, the Godiva and the berry ones.  Come hungry, leave heavier."
Lorilynn L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",150,241,139,4.0,12/10/2014,"The best Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service at the hostess table was superb, bright friendly people, setting the stage for a perfect last dinner in San Diego. The seating was comfortable and perfect location selected for a mid-size group. The bread was served tasty, toasty and warm to perfection. I had the chicken madeira, so delicious, easily escalated to my all time fa ckf meal. Thx for a great rvening, def returning!!"
Samantha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,55,5,5.0,7/22/2016,"We went at lunch and it was nearly empty! Cheesecake Factory is a nice chain that always gives you what you expect. This location was no different - fast, friendly, clean service."
Samantha B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,"Our service was terrible. Our server ""O"" was frantically running around to his tables. He didn't give us bread and failed to mention there was no butter. How do you run out of butter. Also kept arguing with us about our meal choices and kept trying to push his favorite dessert on us even after we ordered our cheesecake. As a former server of your customers can tell your struggling it's not professional. And the customer is always right when it comes to what they want. We did ask for suggestions but the way he shot down everything we asked for was rude and very disrespectful. Sorry. I won't be coming back"
Cammy L.,"Santee, CA",269,267,171,5.0,12/21/2014,"Really the Cheesecake Factory does so many things so well. It is surprising and impressive with such an extensive menu that they are able to get so much right...  Came here for a very very late dinner night before last. We arrived at about 10:30 at night and were seated right away. It was still crowded (like always).  We scored when were sat in Lynn's section, stellar server! (I'm a pain in the ass... I know it... I joke and like to give my server a hard time... most of the time in good fun... and he took it all in stride and played along!! FOR THE WIN!) Attentive and gave awesome suggestions, even exchanged my drink when it didn't come out tasty.... Tim had been wishing for avocado eggrolls and wouldn't shut up about them so we started with those... From there we decided to just do share plates for the rest of the food. Good choice! Lynn suggested the Pasta Carbonara and he could not have been more right! We also ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and The Everything Pizza. Everything was so delicious.  We got to sing some happy birthday to a table next to us and were encouraged to join in!!! My kind of place! While Tim stuck with his Jack and cokes I tried the pineapple Moscow Mule and let me tell you something... it has two of my favorite things... pineapple and Moscow Mule... and it was delicious!!!! My second drink I ordered a regular mule and it didn't come out too tasty so Lynn exchanged it for a vodka tonic for me no questions asked! (great service). Between the four of us our bill was a little under $100. We walked away fat and happy. It was great company and we didn't walk out of the until almost 1 am. They weren't rushing us out or making us feel uncomfortable about it being past closing time. Even encouraged us to have dessert, which we passed on...  Once again, great experience Cheesecake Factory!"
Theresa N.,"San Diego, CA",628,410,812,2.0,7/1/2014,"I remember when this place first opened up in the late 90's or early 2000's I think.  I was sort of fresh outta high school and I remember that this one guy I used to think was cute would always boast about this place, I am assuming to try to give himself some ""cool points"".  Unfortunately, I didn't get to actually try this place out til a few years later, when I actually started making some money (hey, in my humble opinion, $20-$30 entrees are pretty pricey for a kid straight outta high school). That's when I realized the only cool part was pretty much the illusion that was painted of this place being worth it, due to the higher priced dishes.  I guess all those youthful years of it being not so attainable to me made me raise my expectations about this place...then finally trying it out and found it was just mehhh.  It's OVERRATED!  I'll be honest, I loved their carbonara bow tie pasta dish until I realized it was nearly 2000 calories!  I'm not a super health fanatic, but gotdamn!  So I finally went back last week for a birthday dinner and saw that they now have a ""Skinnylicious Menu"".  Haha. I ordered their Seared Ahi Tuna Salad- fish was not fresh.  The only thing good about this salad was the dressing! I also tried their chicken and mushroom wraps.  Meh!  Even Pick Up Stix are better. I guess if you like cheesecake, that's cool.  I tried some of my sister's cheesecake and it was too sweet and rich for my liking... All in all, can't say I'm the hugest fan of this place.  Overhyped, overrated and overpriced for what you get.  I even dare say they have gotten worse over the years!"
