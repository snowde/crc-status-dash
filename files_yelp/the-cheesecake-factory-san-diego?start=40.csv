Julio M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2017,"I went with my co-workers for our Christmas party. After they served everyone; the manager approaches me to apologize bc they we're out of the ahi tuna that I ordered. By the time he told me this he promised to bring me whatever I wanted asap so I ordered a salmon. (my party was already eating). After 10-15 no food yet, and my party was already finishing eating. I cancelled the order and didn't eat bc I didn't want to hold my co-workers.  Bad service overall!"
Ashley E.,"San Diego, CA",53,453,2882,3.0,7/31/2017,"I've only visited a few times and to be honest I really only come once a year when the cheesecake is half off.   The portions size is very large but with that you can expect a larger price.  Unfortunately the quality and the taste do not support that price.  I've had pasta, pizza, salad, and recently the waffle benedict off their brunch menu.  My favorite item out of all of it is the free bread and butter.  The salad I've had was basically plain lettuce, it didn't have anything else but an OK dressing.  I wouldn't order again.  The pizzas are actually okay and might be worth the price.  The kids meal pizza is a good deal and my son loves it.  The waffle benedict I had was not very good.  The eggs were not cooked the same.  One was a firm gel consistency while the other was barely cooked.  The yolk spilled out instantly and the whites were barely cooked.  The hollandaise which is one of my favorite things was lacking in flavor.  The chicken was just okay but too was lacking flavor. The waffle was the only decent part.  The potatoes served with it were cut potatoes that were deep fried and they were way over cooked.  They were hard and pretty much inedible. Service is also nothing special.  This last time was the worst. The servers are not attentive with refills of drinks.  Our server took our order and then went to three other tables and took their orders. She then must have put the order in the computer reversed and because we got our food last and was over a half hour later.  Also when it came time to pay I received the wrong bill and guess what it was more expensive then my bill.  Seriously these waiters need to be trained.  Not one server even asked how my meal was.  It was very disappointing service.  The only reason I would give the Cheesecake Factory three stars versus two is the cheesecake.  I have tried the salted caramel, the 30th anniversary last year, the white chocolate macadamia, raspberry lemon, red velvet and heath.  I've loved everyone of those.  The only one I didn't care for was this year's celebration cake.  It was a little odd by my four year old loved it. I guess the only positive thing is the cheesecake other than that I don't particularly care for the Cheesecake Factory and will probably only visit when they run their yearly half priced cheesecake special."
Leo M.,"San Diego, CA",3,103,131,3.0,10/11/2017,"Nothing but cakes  If that was what this place about I would give it 5 but they try to have a major menu and the food is not great  I like the  atmosphere there very much  The team is very nice and they know every little thing in the cake section , but when it's come to the food .... again not so great  Also the prices are a little bit high  In the overall this place is ok but nothing much"
Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,3.0,4/16/2017,"Came here for dinner as the mall it's located at was just behind where we were staying for the weekend....so we didn't need to drive anywhere. I probably don't need to say too much about the Cheesecake factory as they're all decorated with the same theme.  Came here about 7pm and there was a huge crowd waiting outside the door.....now it was just a guessing game as to how long we had to wait to get a table. I went up to the check in counter and asked the guy how long a wait for two would be....he said about 35 minutes. No problem....thank goodness the mall is just there, so we were given a buzzer and went off to the mall to do some shopping to pass the time. On the dot, about 35 minutes later the buzzer went off and back we rushed. Thank goodness the buzzer worked all the way in the mall....as I was afraid it may have been out of range. Service was actually very good considering the place was totally packed inside and outside in the outdoor patio. We were kind of hungry so ordered a couple of appetizers to start....my usual CF Guacamole Eggrolls and the Chicken Samosas. And for mains I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchilada, and my friend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan.  My enchiladas weren't bad, but I thought red chile sauce was too strong and overpowered the taste of the enchiladas....secondly, the Escabeche Vegetable Salad didn't seem to go well with the enchiladas......it tasted like pickled vegetables you'd get at an Asian restaurant....I didn't enjoy this very much. I took a bite of my friend's eggplant Parmesan ad pasta.....it actually tasted yummy....the pasta was perhaps a bit dry though. Overall, our dinner experience here was just ok....nothing really wow'd us. However, most disappointing were the guacamole eggrolls.....the skin is supposed to be crispy, but outs was soggy. And, I do recall when the guac eggrolls were first introduced years ago, there was much more filling than what we got here tonight. The Chicken Samosas were quite good...but could have used more spice in the filling. Hmmm....not sure if I'll come back to this location....or if I do, I'll definitely have to order something else next time. Our server was really nice and friendly though. We had so wanted to try their cheesecake, but decided we were too full."
John M.,"San Diego, CA",77,157,359,3.0,10/20/2017,"Who really hasn't been to The Cheesecake Factory? Wether it's for a birthday dinner, company meeting or if it's your fav spot most have been and have seen the menu... So I haven't been in many years as I was never a huge fan of their food. Visited the other evening for a bday and all I can say is that the menu is overwhelming! Not necessarily a good things as has you wondering how much of the product is truly fresh vs processed food? 2 pages of cheesecakes, 2-3 pages for apps/small bites, 2-3 pages of entrees yet only a small portion set aside for fresh items like salads or soups. This is from memory but  there were more pages that I can't recall. Most people  in  our group were nauseated​ by the amount of items. To be honest only found a small amount of items I would have grabbed(really only 2) but settled on the chicken wraps as I hoped they would be fresh enough for my taste. Butter lettuce, pickled cucumber(sweet though), carrots, 3 sauces(all sickly sweet), chicken(felt processed and was on top of it, sweet), bean sprouts, rice noodles and some cilantro. Price point was fine but with all the sugar loaded into the meal felt like dessert instead of savory. Other party members bout some food but all the plates were huge! One pasta dish looked as if it was a whole box of pasta on a plate! Not even exaggerating as she only managed to eat a 3rd of her plate before she was done. Customer service was good so I give them that, attentive and since we were a large party compromised of different groups the waitress knew we would all ask for separate checks and easily accommodated. All the cheesecakes listed, maybe 1 or 2 seemed appetizing but in the end since the app was so sweet didn't order any. My taste buds were still coated with sweetness from the app so no need for it. We stayed well past closing but were not rushed out, seated outside enjoying good company was a blast and why I'm rating them a 3. Food was not great but service was good so can't say anything too bad other then they need to minimize their menu and focus on fresher options to combat the multitude of sweetness they're putting out there. May come back for some of the drinks as they had a few that were very good. Not great yet not bad."
Jennie K.,"Washington, DC",95,263,455,5.0,8/12/2017,"I typically have a hard time giving The Cheesecake Factory a 5/5. What was once my favorite restaurant 4 years ago has now been deemed a hit or miss. Fortunately, Brandy has changed my whole outlook on the Cheesecake Factory. Someone needs to give her a freaking promotion and let her become the CEO of Cheesecake. I'm not trying to blow smoke up her butt- before today, I had no idea who she was. She truly left an amazing impression with her impeccable service and her positive, bubbly attitude. Okay, woman crush aside, the food. The food was really really good today. My mom and I ordered the calamari - it was seasoned perfectly, the calamari itself wasn't overlooked or anything. It was perfectly fried and at a perfect temperature. I have trust issues with calamari as it can be overseasoned, too battered and too fried, but today was excellent. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Delicious- hot, crispy breaded chicken with a right amount of heat. Even the thickness of the sauce was on par, as sometimes it's either too dry or too watery. I am thoroughly impressed. I haven't been to the Cheesecake factory since my spring vacation to Honolulu (you can read about my odd experience from that Cheesecake Factory). Today, Brandy has shown me that I can believe in this place once again. Thank you Brandy. You da real MVP! Definitely will try and request you again :)"
Amy S.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,12,3,1.0,12/30/2017,I called and made curbside order earlier in the day to be picked up by 1pm.  I arrived on time and called them on the number in the sign and they said yes.  I waited 115 min and called again  and they said yes they will be right there. No one shows up. So I left.  Cheesecake Factory ur sign and service is a joke. Take the crappy sign out it's not true.
Kristian W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,6,3,4.0,12/28/2017,"Our Server Steven, Andrew, and the manager Richard were ALL exceptional. It's busy and I had to send a dish back (no biggie). They went above and beyond with making my new order and then treated us to cheesecake. Whether or not that would have happened I would have still written this review. It's the holidays and people are nasty and rude and these people work hard and the gold customer service shows. Everyone request Steven's section he is AMAZING. Love the cheesecake factory. Thanks guys!!!"
Lin D.,"San Diego, CA",224,157,27,2.0,10/1/2017,"I love the selection of cheesecake, however, I'm never able to fit cheesecake after eating a meal.  The BLT sandwich is probably the one of the best BLT's I've ever eaten. French fries are good. The Orange chicken is good, but it is no way any type of authentic Asian. The calamari is good here.  So as you can see I've been here quite a few times. Now, I won't even go near this place. And you're probably wondering why if the food is Good? Theory: Either the restaurant has cut costs by not hiring enough employees to serve their customers adequately.  Or the servers just don't care. I'm a people watcher and I can tell you, the latter is probably not.  On all occasions I have been here, I have waited NO LESS than an hour for my food. The first time, the restaurant was kind and offered me cheesecake on the house. Very sweet jester. But after it happened EVERY TIME we went, they lost my business and any other business that might be associated with me.  I will NEVER recommend this place, as it's embarrassing that the manager allows this to happen. I know it's busy, but your service sucks. It also sucks when your servers ask ""can I get anything else?"" But instead of waiting for everyone to answer, she had to go back, every, Single, Request. (What a waste of time. Very unprofessional and very inefficient) 2 stars because the food is great, but with the horrendous service, I will never go back. There are competitor restaurants with better service.  Beware of this place!"
Fiona H.,"San Diego, CA",161,40,35,3.0,12/20/2017,"I've been here multiple times. I really enjoy the food here and the service is great. We usually order the fried zuchinni, the spinach and artichoke dip, calamari, fresh grilled salmon with lemon sauce and the pasta divinci. They've run out of the fried zuchinni 3 times and they've run out of the spinach dip once. The great part though is that they've never run out of both at the same time before..... I have never been able to finish my entree here. The food takes really long to come to the table, we usually finish a whole basket of bread and start on another before appetizers come out 25minutes sometimes 30 then about 30 minutes more for the entree. Usually by the time our entree comes to the table we will have a few bites and be sleepy already. I assumed it was because of the dim lighting? I've been to high end restaurants with mood lighting and I've never gotten sleepy at the restaurants before. We just take our leftovers Togo and my boyfriend eats them the next day.  The bread, fried zuchinni, and service though... FIVE STARS!"
Joaquin P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,15,,1.0,12/27/2017,"LACK OF SERVICE TO THE N EXPONENT. Got our table in 30 mins, another 20 minutes to get drinks and bread and we placed our order (we were 4 people)....30 minutes later I complained because our order was not ready yet...10 minutes later comes out with 2 of the dishes, one was already cold... the other 2 dishes were going to take ""another couple of minutes"".... we never saw them, so manager came and ""apologize"".... are you kidding me?????.... we got out and left!!!! WILL NEVER COME BACK, SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!!"
Wendi J.,"San Diego, CA",947,121,92,4.0,7/20/2017,Love this place. You can never go wrong coming here.  The portions are huge and the food is great. I've never ordered something I didn't like. But to mention the cheesecake is the absolute best!!! You can't come here and not get cheesecake.  Downside is there is usually a long wait and they do not rsvp.
Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4213,331,209,4.0,11/16/2016,"Rating this restaurant is difficult. They make everyone wait to get seated. Even if there are empty tables. Either it's because they are understaffed or it's a marketing tactic.  Regardless, they need more staff. Our waitress was very good but had too many tables to handle so we were forced to exercise patience. She really was trying though.  Three of our four meals were excellent. But the forth was a disaster. It came with the wrong condiments and was totally undercooked. So three of us finished our meals before the fourth person in our party started theirs.  I want to give it a 5 for three of our meals and a 1 for the fourth. And a 1 for the restaurants general service but a 5 for our waitress."
Terri T.,"San Diego, CA",25,33,11,2.0,12/8/2017,"Yikes! This place is still serving the same crap it was 20 yrs ago. At that time I found it novel-  but time moves on! Their menu is as big as a dictionary (remember those?) with way way too many offerings for them to do any of it well. I'm always curious about the people who stand around and wait to get in. Overpriced food that comes in ridiculously heaping portions must have an appeal to some.  However, they do one thing very well- cheesecake. So if you are looking for a piece of good cheesecake run in and get some to go. You can't go wrong there. Too bad they didn't know to keep in line with their name ""Cheesecake Factory"". and forget about the terrible food they make."
M R.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,1,5.0,12/20/2017,"Got to sit on the patio with our small dog, though I suspect the posted rules only allow service dogs. Our server was very friendly even though she is afraid of dogs. Excellent service overall, and she refilled our drinks before I even realized I needed a refill. I always get the chicken bellagio, so good. Also enjoyed their red velvet cheesecake. Table next to us had like ten people doing a gift exchange and wanting to split the check individually. I do not envy servers!"
Ali S.,"San Diego, CA",198,65,67,5.0,9/27/2017,"If you're sitting at the bar, you'll be lucky if John is serving you. He's attentive, friendly, and known to crack a few jokes. His service is seamless and always makes sure my glass is full! Andrew M. was our server also and went above and beyond to deliver a great experience. The table next door was keeping him very busy but he still never missed a beat. Service was perfectly timed, his food knowledge was impressive and he always had a friendly smile. The Matua Sauvignon Blanc and Strawberry Martini are perfectly refreshing. I love the Ahi Tartare, White Chicken Chili and Factory Chopped Salad, and if you save room for dessert, I recommend the Tuxedo CC and the Lemon Raspberry. Great great experience!"
Gerri D.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",49,1,,2.0,11/24/2017,"Entrees were delicious; however, service was awful. Silverware and cups were dirty when I sat down. My wife's appetizer and our bread came out with our meals. The appetizer was first undercooked then over cooked and didn't come back out until we asked for the bill. I am a great fan of the restaurant chain but this was by far the worst service I've received."
Molly G.,"San Francisco, CA",4,2,3,3.0,5/14/2017,"Went to this location last night with a couple of my friends and we were very pleased with how fast we got seated despite how crowded it was for Mother's Day/ prom weekend.  The food was a little slow to come out, but the waiters were very prompt with refilling our water and our bread basket, which I do admit needed to be filled quite a lot  After being stuffed from dinner, we decided to take our cheesecakes to go. I got the ultimate red velvet which started out looking and tasting AMAZING! However, after a couple bites, I found a STRIP OF PAPER in the cheesecake! Although the rest was delicious, I was disappointed to bite down on paper instead of frosting."
Karyn T.,"San Diego, CA",223,208,105,5.0,1/2/2017,"I love coming to Cheesecake Factory for Sunday Brunch. There's a regular menu for breakfast but on Sunday you can actually order all the REALLY yummy stuff, note that you can't order anything from this side on the menu any other day!  Katie, thank you for being such an amazing server yesterday, especially New Years Day. She was sweet, personable and asked if we wanted extra brown bread. On other days we would have politely accepted but we had to make room for our breakfast! Bryan ordered the monte cristo and I ordered the carnitas chilaquiles! Those chilaquiles are my favorite, really good spices and satisfied my need for salt and fat!  Definitely one of my favorite places for brunch, plus the food is really inexpensive wish the mimosas were a little cheaper but I am a fan!"
Jasmine C.,"San Diego, CA",481,190,734,5.0,1/1/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory will always be one of my favorites. Not only are the cheesecakes delicious but so is the food. The menu dedicates 2 very own pages for cheesecakes. I try a different flavor every visit. There's so many to pick from and I always end up loving it each time. Last night I tried Chris's outrageous Cheesecake, layers of chocolate and coconut goodness. It's similar to a German cake. If you're a coconut lover this is the cake for you.  The wait can be long sometimes depending if you come in during lunch and dinner rush hours and how many people you're with. Btw they do not take rsvp!! My bf and I decided to take a risk and eat here on NYE for dinner. We got seated within 45 mins, surprisingly, a normal wait on a weekend for two during dinner. Customer service here is great! Servers are very friendly and always come back and check on your table every once in a while.  I always end up getting pasta dishes because the portions are huge! You pay for what you're getting. My regular is the pasta da Vinci, penne pasta with chicken and mushrooms. I tried the Louisiana chicken pasta and that was good too. It was nice and creamy with a kick of spice and the chicken was nicely breaded and had a crunch in every bite.  My bf has the Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with rice. The shrimp was perfectly seasoned. Definitely recommend this plate"
