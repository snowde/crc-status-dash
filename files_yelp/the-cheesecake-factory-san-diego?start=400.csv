Melissa T H.,"The Woodlands, TX",274,465,2054,4.0,5/19/2013,"I love Cheesecake factory... however, this location seems to be the busiest of all the ones I've gone to.  When we go, hubby drops me off and I check in to get a pager while he sharks for parking.  This at least makes me feel that we wait the least amount of time as possible.   This location always delivers excellent food.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the So Cal sunshine with the raspberry martini.  Ah, heaven! Split our favorite Firecracker Salmon appetizer and Chicken Madeira dinner - still as big as ever!  and oh so delicious.  Then did the banana cream pie.   When we crave a healthier choice, we go for the Miso Salmon (I order extra sauce on the side because it's so delish.)  I still haven't tried more than 10 different things here because our favorite entrees are THAT good."
Elle D.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,3.0,9/3/2016,The service was terrible today. Idk if they are short staffed or what but it took over 1/2 hour for food to come. Normally they are pretty good.
Dawnnella N.,"San Diego, CA",13,2,1,1.0,6/19/2015,"Worst experience ever found a bug in the white chicken chili already uploaded a photo, the waiter sucked didn't check up on us had to call down a different waiter to get this issue looked into.... Never again will I give them my business"
Gillian Y.,"Folsom, CA",477,190,261,4.0,10/28/2015,"Great service and good food. We had lunch in the bar on Sunday and was pleasantly surprised with wonderful waitress who was attentive & very nice, and the food that came out quickly & tasted wonderful. No complaints."
Mary M.,"El Cajon, CA",53,3,,1.0,2/26/2017,Went here with a friend and her 9 year old son on 2/25/17. I order the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and my friend ordered teriyaki chicken with white rice and both of our food was good and my 7 year old order a cheese pizza and my 3 year old and my friends 9 year old order mini corn dogs with fries. My 7 year old ate her pizza but my 3 year old my friends 9 year old didn't eat their mini corn dogs cause the batter of the breading wasn't good all the way and we had them take it back and give us new ones and even at that it wasn't cook all the way. So my friend and I just shared our food with them and the sever told the manager about what happened and all she can say was i am sorry for what happened with the mini corn dogs. And when my friend went to pay she had asked to talk to the manager and the manager didn't even offer to give my friend a discount of off our bill for what happened to our kids food my friend had to ask for the discount. And all the manager did was take off my 7 year old pizza and all 3 kids drinks. Our bill was 60.00 drop down to 43.00 like really after what you served us and especially after we waited more than 1 hour. I won't go there to eat i will just buy cheesecake there and that's it. And if i can give no stars i would give a minus star.
Autumn R.,"Payson, AZ",35,12,1,1.0,5/30/2016,"No thanks. From the parking lot, to the floor, the tables, and the women's restroom was absolutely filthy. The wait was not bad, but we got a frozen meatball in our spaghetti and was told it will go under the warmer and will be brought back. Nasty. Not impressed."
Rodney R.,"San Gabriel, CA",94,7,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Hats off to the manager of the Cheesecake Factory Richard and his staff! I have never written a review like this before.  After having read the reviews; we were expecting a long wait. However, our son has a special need and after looking at the daunting line I felt compelled to ask the manager for help.  I looked Richard in the eye and asked him for help. He has a very big heart and immediately started to look for a place for our family to feel comfortable.  Needless to say the food was on point as always and the heart felt empathy was much appreciated! Thank you Richard for making our vacation a memorable and happy one!! Best, The Ruiz Family"
Noam A.,"Rockville, MD",68,13,5,5.0,8/11/2016,"There's a rich menu, a very beautiful place, waiters meet all requirements and provide excellent service, very tasty here and a fun atmosphere, highly recommend the place"
Ana B.,"San Diego, CA",0,112,,5.0,8/7/2016,"I ordered the Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos for dinner.  It was delicious.  They give you a hot napkin to wipe your hands after a meal.  The regular cheesecake was OK, but the dessert of my friends were delicious.  I know what to order the next time around.  Service was excellent."
Bri H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/5/2016,I get utterly disgusted by the Cheesecake Factory as I always am near this location and see there employees smoking cigarettes and sitting on dirty curbs in their APRONS and coats that they cook food in! You guys have no standards and are just another place that acts glitz and glam but really could care less behind the scenes. Yuck!!! Like I want to food from a place like that! No thanks I'll go across the street to True Food Kitchen instead.
Chris M.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,4,1.0,10/21/2016,"Very disappointed. My date had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and the pineapple in it tasted very bad, like it had gone bad. We both tasted it and it was bad!! Requested the manager and he only gave excuses of flavor mixing. No it wasn't flavor mixing it was old! And he offered no compensation, anything would have been appreciated but nothing. Not coming back very disappointed. Recommend any place else they obviously are not food quality or service oriented."
Linda N.,"San Diego, CA",50,36,10,5.0,5/1/2015,I hadn't been here in a few years and boy was I pleasantly surprised. The waitress was such a sweetie I really wish I remembered her name. I ordered the bbq ranch salad and it was the lunch special and it was huge!! Anyways I'm definitely coming back. I was here last Saturday afternoon.
Jah L.,"San Diego, CA",14,54,203,5.0,6/24/2015,"This was only my second time eating here and it's been a while since the last time. After this visit, I'm definitely going to come here more often. The customer service was great. Our waiter checked on us multiple times and made sure my party was doing ok. We went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't that busy. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and it was amazing!!! The only thing was that the shrimp was underdone, but the sauce and the chicken was so delicious and cooked just right that it didn't ruin the whole thing. For dessert I had the carrot cheesecake. It was yummy, but too much was too sweet. I also had the brownie Sunday and it was super rich, but mouthwatering. I have to come back here soon! I'm craving Cheesecake Factory now!"
Andrew P.,"Orange County, CA",509,711,317,4.0,4/20/2016,consistent with all other locations i've eaten at. it's always busy at any given one of them as well. i sat at the bar area since i was on my own on business. i ordered the an ahi tuna appetizer and my entree was a nice steak. my server was very nice but was very busy however took care of me  very well and i appreciated that. i would come back here for sure.
Teri S.,"San Diego, CA",10,23,2,1.0,7/28/2017,"Giving this a one star and that's one star too many. Had out of town guest. She doesn't have a Cheesecake Factory where she currently lives and she wanted to eat here. So we went in and asked how long the wait and was told we could be seated right away. We were seated in the ""bar"" area. We had to wait 10 minutes before our server, Brian, came and introduced himself and took our drink order. It was another 5-7 minutes before our sodas arrived delivered by another server. In the 17 or so minutes we were there the two tables on either side of us were empty, seated and then they had received their drinks AND bread basket. I had to flag another server to get a bread basket and it was brought right away..piping hot..yea. We waiting a few more minutes and Brian returned took our order and dissapeared. In the meantime, the tables to the left and right of us had received their food orders.  After about 25 minutes I went to the hostess and requested a manager. About 3 minutes later Sean, who said he was the manager to came to the table. I explained the situation and stated that we had been waiting over 30 minutes for our food.  He said he would go to the kitchen and check on the status and would return. He left and returned about 5 minutes later.  He said that out food order had been placed 17 minutes earlier and that the one dish needed 20 minutes to prepare.  He said he would look at the ticket and see what could be done for compensation due to the circumstances.   And gave us a new server. She was super. I was disappointed when our food arrived. It wasn't as hot as it should have been given that it was supposed to have been prepared on the fly. When it came to the bill, all that was combed was a $6.95 piece of cheesecake.   I expected the meal to be better. I should have been combed the entire meal since it took 45 minutes to arrive to the table and the other inconveniences.  However, I ended up paying $40 for a less than mediocre meal and less than any service.  We never saw Brian except to carry a tray with bread baskets from one computer station to another after our complaint.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory.  I won't be returning...ever and neither will my family or friends."
Kiarra S.,"Riverside, CA",6,45,26,1.0,3/3/2016,By one of the worst experiences I've had at a Cheesecake Factory. My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday night and it was a horrible mistake. First of all we didn't get bread when we were first seated. We had to ask almost 20min of being seated. Then we ordered strawberry lemonades and they were watered down. My boyfriend told the waitress and she said ok I'll get you new drinks from the menu but I wouldn't order any lemonades. So my question is why would you serve a drink you know isn't good. I honestly couldn't believe the lack of customer service that night. Now our food was horrible . I had the chicken bellagio and the serving was smaller than usual. The food was very salty. My boyfriend had the fettuccine alfredo and it was soooo salty! Overall just a horrible experience there.
Manal M.,"Santee, CA",21,10,,5.0,7/2/2016,"I've ate here for years. It's always a good experience and the food is always good. We were there recently to celebrate our Anniversary with our kids and they enjoyed the food which isn't always the case when we eat out. Our waiter was great and so were the servers. The staff is always really friendly and attentive. I can't say I have a favorite dish here because I've tried a lot of them and they're all good. We especially love their appetizers, and when there's room for dessert, we share a cheesecake."
Brian And Tina T.,"San Diego, CA",31,69,254,4.0,9/21/2015,"Wow, she really loves this place. I think this place was pretty great, but the pricing on slightly above average food didn't cut it. The highlight of the dinner was the fancier setting. For the price, there are other restaurants with savory food. We got two pasta plates, and a side of fried vegatables and portabello mushrooms. We give this place 4 stars because of the diverse menu and the skilled chefs that can cook that many dishes. our hats off to you. overall, our cup of tea (it's her favorite place)."
Nessa S.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",98,21,21,4.0,9/19/2014,"Today was much better quality of food than my last to go experience. IF only the seating weren't so close to each other, I'd be satisfied with eating there. That's why I usually take everything to go.  I had to sit through 2 hours of dinner with the family's child next to me, on my booth just laying down.. His head was so close to my lap that one more scoot he would've been on my lap! His family didn't even car that this child kept hoping up & down on the seats! Nor the fact that he kept putting his head near my lap then when he flipped over he kicks me on my leg with his feet as he laid down again but in the opposite position! I thought giving a stare at the teenage daughter would give her a sign to tell her family to handle him. But, all they do is say something to him in Spanish, & he gets up then does it all over again! It was just a very uncomfortable, no space to breathe & talk type of dinner. I just really wanted to enjoy my dinner with my boyfriend tonight but instead I was just super upset the entire night..  Overall, great food from a guy named Damon B. He was very helpful with what to get for an appetizer, always checking up & honest about where the tips go to. We wanted to give him the entire tip just to him but he said ""I can't, I have to share a percentage w/ everyone."" Love honest, loyal, customer service just like that!!"
Samantha S.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,8,,5.0,12/26/2016,"My friends and I had a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory tonight. Tera was our server and she was great, everything she suggested was amazing, I love this location and will be back! Thanks, Tera!"
