Lance C.,"San Diego, CA",28,92,12,3.0,10/4/2015,"We arrived at 5:10pm on a Saturday afternoon. Wait time was 25 minutes for a table for four. The place was very busy with a lot of waiters and waitresses  running around. My wife ordered a margarita with not salt, but the waitress brought a margarita with salt. My wife reminded the waitress she didn't want salt and the waitress apologies and said she would have it changed. Unfortunately the new drink tasted salty. Obviously the bartender simply poured the first drink w/salt into a new glass, unacceptable. I've eaten here a few times before, but won't be returning in a hurry. Not the best place in the world, but not the worst."
James C.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",1,40,4,5.0,1/5/2017,"Took grandkids for a treat and it sure was. The service was tops. The food was super and the cheesecake, all were amazing. Overall a great experience . Pricy but worth it."
Erik B.,"Roseville, CA",25,69,24,2.0,8/1/2014,"We were quoted 35 minutes which turned into 60 minutes. We waited outside as inside was packed with people loading up on cheesecake. We should have gone elsewhere as the amount of rude people outside was unbelievable. I guess when people bump into you or need to squeeze by, saying ""sorry"" or ""excuse me"" isn't common courtesy in this area????  The service was good. Food was just OK. I don't get what the attraction is with this place?"
Ryan B.,"Escondido, CA",71,6,9,1.0,4/9/2016,Worst place to get a to go order!!!! Erica the manager is the worst!!!!! SOMEONE SHOULD FIRE HER!!!! Not caring at all about costumer service!!!
Varsha P.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/18/2016,"This place is always crowded but still the service is best so far...so lively so energetic and the food is awesome, vegetarian have less options but still it never disappointed us!! Highly recommended place!! Best staff"
Michelle C.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Usually I don't have a problem with their service but today was absolutely ridiculous! It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and 1 hour to get our appetizers and then 2 minutes later our entrees came out. This was unacceptable. The food came out nearly cold. The table next to us even called a manager over to complain about the service.  Almost every customer that was dining with our server was waiting a substantial amount of time for just their drinks as we did.  The table behind us had a different server and was served right away before other tables who arrived first with our server. I work in the hospitality field as well as customer service so I know what the pressure feels like when it's busy. I felt bad and gave the server the benefit of the doubt. However, a majority of the time I didn't even see her around. When she was tending to other diners right next to us, she didn't even look our way and when she did, she didn't apologize for the wait or acknowledge it. For spending almost $100 for dinner, customer service should have been a lot better. I definitely will not be returning anytime soon."
Diana D.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/1/2017,"I've never written a review on any restaurants but I really felt the need to because of the way we were treated. I've been to so many cheesecake factories but this one in particular has the most disrespectful and rude employees. Although I'm a big fan of their food, their treatment makes me not want to come back here ever again and this has happened many times, this is not the only time. The receptionists have the worst attitude, especially a girl named Mina with the long hair, she made us feel not welcomed. For a restaurant that is very popular, they need to work and train their workers better and teach them how to have a better attitude."
Rachelle M.,"San Diego, CA",100,17,,4.0,6/13/2016,"I love it! There are so many items to choose from! I had the Bistro Shrimp pasta and was totally satisfied! It was very flavorful. It seemed like every plate that walked by our table we were like, ""Ooh that looks good"" lol! I've only been to Cheesecake Factory a few times throughout the years... But now I'm wondering why I slept on it for so long lol. My daughter got the Chicken Ceaser Salad and even that was really good! I'm looking forward to trying more things there. I like the indoor and outdoor seating as well."
Christoffer F.,"Stockholm, Sweden",43,94,100,4.0,8/2/2014,"The interior/exterior looks like mix between a luxurous hotel and a palace from Aladdin. It has a really cosy atmoshere! (altough it can get abit loud sometimes) One downside is you can't make a reservation, so come early! It's usually only a 20min wait which is not that bad. Despite the name it's also a dining restaurant with a lunch and dinner meny. The meny is really broad and you can get pasta, fish, salads, pizza, steaks, burgers, sandwiches and of course cheesecakes. I usually go for the Oreo cheesecake and I recommend this masterpiece! If you want to finish a dinner dish and a cheesecake I suggest you arrive hungry but you can always split one with a friend!  I been to some resturants around Cali' and the quality stays the same! Brilliant service with personal that always want you to have they best experince and really take their time with the customers, the food is abit pricey but wellworth the money. You get a good meal, in a nice resturant with great service!"
Julia C.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,1.0,4/28/2016,Worst service during happy hour!!!! I guess you need to be a tourist so you can get good service
Jamie W.,"Escondido, CA",74,121,31,1.0,4/22/2016,You guys have always taken reservations for Mother's Day or other holidays but not this year guess what you just lost my family's business and your host read answering the phone was rather unpleasant bummer
Leah R.,"San Diego, CA",319,29,19,5.0,7/31/2015,"One of my favorite restaurants, ever. Last night, I went in just to pick up cheesecakes for National Cheesecake Day. There was a 50% off deal. It was very, very crowded, which was expected. I'm writing this because although it was super hectic and chaotic, I didn't see one employee/server/host lose it. I thought that was really impressive. Everyone was super nice and patient! My favorite cheesecake is the raspberry white chocolate truffle and dulce de leche caramel. I also love their cocktail drinks and pasta.  The new outside area at this location is so beautiful and I usually request to sit inside, but for this restaurant, I request the outside because it's so nice!"
Felonious P.,"San Diego, CA",2,56,,2.0,8/29/2015,"Good food with a very long and varied menu, nice look to the place, I've always had nice waiters, and it's so central. Those are the positives, and that's why I've come here so much. But every single time I come, I hate the wait, the rude hosts and hostesses, the stupid seating system. It's just awful. This time was the last straw. I'm not coming anymore, and any group that invites me, I will let them know that we should go somewhere else because I am not going there again.  Here are the details, I walked through the crowded dingy mass of people waiting hopelessly for a table, past the sign that says these walls are cancer-causing, and eat here at your own risk. I make it finally to the hostess desk, where the unfriendly group of girls looks me over then says the wait for four people is about 45 minutes. ""But come back in 20 for a pager."" So they want us to stand in line, put our names down, go away, come back, wait in line, get a pager, go away, and when they ring the pager, to come back wait in line, and then be pushed into an awkward clump of people in some random aisle, until our waiter arrives. I'm done. It's a nice place but it's not great, and no food is worth that ordeal."
Jonathan L.,"San Diego, CA",16,22,1,1.0,4/24/2016,"The only positive thing about this place is the actual cheesecakes. Been here about 4 times in the past 2 years and they always seem to be understaffed. The taste on the food has really come down since the first time I came here. Today I ordered one of the steaks and it claimed to come with mashed potatoes and ""vegetables"" so i asked the waiter what those vegetables were and he said it was broccoli. The food was dropped off and I got my undercooked steak, mashed potatoes and green peas so after 15 minutes of waiting for the waiter to show up  again and asked what happened to the broccoli and he said that he didn't know that it came with green peas and he would bring it up to me right away. 20 minutes later the broccoli was still cooking. The only reason I ate the other food was because I was really hungry..... Please do not come here. You will not get your money's worth."
Athar A.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,14,1.0,4/23/2015,"Can you imagine that a restaurant like cheesecake factory has such restrooms...ugh, so bad when I entered the restroom ,and saw that this mess you see in the pictures...ton of toilet towels on the floor not to mention, they seemed forgot to clean it on regular basis....so bad, I didn't expect that from such an elegant restaurant."
Mel T.,"New York, NY",3,30,6,3.0,6/25/2016,"Awesome food and great atmosphere, but my waitress called me ""hun"" about 4 times. I am not a Chinese warrior, so I'm not too sure why she kept calling me that. Also, we are probably about the same age, which was extra weird."
Rick A.,"Santee, CA",0,12,9,1.0,7/7/2017,"I've always had pretty good service here but tonight was complete opposite. We were celebrating my nephews b-day, we had a party of 8 so wait was over a hour which I understood considering it was Friday night. Once we sat down we told the waitress regarding the bday. We ordered our food and about 20 min we were served. In our group two of us ordered pasta one of them being myself. From the start something wasn't correct. There was a random toothpick in my food, I just removed it since I was hungry, took my first bite and the pasta was cold along with the other plate of pasta we ordered. Told the waitress she apologized took both plates back to reheat. Several min pass and she came back with the plates and the only thing that was hot was the plates. The pasta was cold I was over it and just decided to skip on eating. She apologized again and I totally understood it wasn't her fault. She said the manager was going to come speak with us. Needless to say manager never came to speak with us, several drinks we ordered were never brought out, and to top it off nothing was mentioned regarding my nephews b-day."
California P.,"San Diego, CA",3,37,18,4.0,6/9/2014,"This is an UPDATE to my review. The day after my complaint about the extreme poor quality of the food I took TO GO on Memorial Day (see review and photos below), I received a call from the location Manager, Gary I believe, who offered to send me a gift card for my inconveniences and an apology.  He assured me that the problem was located and resolved to prevent any future complaints of the same nature.  He asked me to ask for him the next time I was dining in and hoped he could restore my faith in Cheesecake Factory.   I must say... this is the gold standard in customer service.  This company truly believes in making the customer happy and to see that they have a great dining experience.   This is an example by which ALL business should stand by.   THANK YOU CHEESECAKE FACTORY. I will return."
Audrey B.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,5.0,1/1/2017,"Have been here many times and have never had a bad meal. The only downfall is the long wait, but it is always worth it! I am writing this review today because we had absolutely phenomenal service from John R. We came in for an early dinner (New Year's Day) around 5:45 and started with a female server, who ended up going on a break or was done for the night. John took over and did such an amazing job!! He was friendly and attentive, always making sure our drinks were full and that we had everything we needed. He was super nice about splitting the check 6 ways and even splitting up the cheesecake prices between all of us. As expected, this place was packed on a holiday , but we never once felt rushed with John! Haven't had such a good server in a really long time! Thanks John, we really appreciated all that you did!!!"
Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",514,1202,8732,4.0,9/18/2012,"Enough reviews and pics have been posted on this. Here is what I order almost EVERY SINGLE TIME: Avocado Eggrolls:  Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce - *mind blowing*. Words cannot describe how awesome this dish is. Even if you hate avo, try this dish. It might just convert you. Their tamarind dipping sauce is stupid good Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira : Our famous Shrimp Scampi sautéed with whole cloves of garlic, white wine, fresh basil and tomato AND Sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese and fresh mushroom Madeira Sauce. - the sauces for BOTH these dishes make this *THE* best entree here. I crave this dish like no other.  So a few side notes: Ordered TO GO for first time few weeks ago... - person taking order was nice and efficient - there is supposed to be reserved designated spots for Cheesecake factory customers picking up food. ALL 3 spots were taken. I saw 1 spot being taken by lame loverbird teenage couple grabbing subway or something in the mall. The other 2 spots were taken by handicap drivers (I didn't know this but if you have a decal, you can park anywhere that says reserved?). - someone will come out to your car and give you receipt. You then give them your credit card, they go back inside to process, and then come out to get your signature and tip - the to go order of my combo scampi shrimp and chicken Madeira was really nicely done. It looked and tasted awesome. They also packaged extra sauce for me per my request - the bread that came w/ it was nice as well Here's my gripe: - ordered low carb cheesecake. Didn't want strawberries on it. They put strawberries on there but the girl that came out to take my credit card said they didn't charge me extra for berries. Came home and 1) cheesecake looked AWFUL + puny ; 2) the berries that came with it looked old and over riped and 3) they charged me for the berries I didn't want. The presentation was terrible.  If you've been to CF before, the cheesecake section is separate from kitchen. They usually bust out the dessert orders pretty fast. I put the blame on them, and them alone, for the cheesecake disaster.  I called the manager to voice my concern as we had driven 25 min one way to get our order. I just told him it was disappointing to get such a sad cheesecake b/c we've always been so happy w/ our food there. He was a bit defensive and asked 'did you eat the cheesecake, wasn't it ok'. And I said no, we haven't touched it, we're staring at it right now. He took the item off the bill (haven't confirmed yet) which we appreciated. I told him that we really loved what the kitchen produced but that he should tell the cheesecake prep girls to take more pride in what they put out. Anyhow, the low carb cheesecake tasted terrible. The crust is really gritty tasting. I'd rather run 20 miles and then treat myself to one of their full carb slices of cheesecakes next time."
