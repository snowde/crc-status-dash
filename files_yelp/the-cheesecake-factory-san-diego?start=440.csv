Mai W.,"San Diego, CA",33,100,74,1.0,3/19/2015,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while, and now I remember why... It all started so nice and dandy.  Server, Jamie, was (key word, was) attentive. Our buffalo blasters appetizers were delicious.  We were done with them, and about 25 minutes later, my Jambalaya comes out solo... They said my husband's Shepherds Pie would be right out.  Manager stopped by to offer a soup or salad so that he could eat with me while he waited, but we just had a large app and he didn't want to spoil his appetite for his dinner entree. Another 15 minutes of eating my Jambalaya alone, still no Shepherds Pie.  A few minutes later, it finally comes.  It was OK to say the least, but by that time, we were so done waiting around, we had a couple bites and asked for the food Togo.  Server never came back around to ask how our food was and wasn't really apologetic for how long the food took.  Being in the industry, we were really nice and understanding to the fact that shit happens. Ordered some Cheesecake Togo and that took another 15 minutes... As servers ourselves... We were pretty shocked that the server/management didn't really took into account the all waiting time we were doing... A cheesecake comped would've been nice, but I guess that's not how The Factory's guest satisfaction policy rolls. It's the first time I left a tip less than 25% in a long time.  Hope the server and management team smartens up about how to take care of their guests after such a long wait."
Shelle K.,"San Diego, CA",75,43,47,4.0,4/12/2014,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Aside from there usually being a wait (and no option for reservations) the food is great, portions are on the large side, and the cheesecakes are so delicious. The cheesecake slices are big enough to share between 2-3 people, but we usually get two anyway to try different flavors. Yummm!"
Sarah P.,"Norfolk, VA",1,1,,1.0,4/13/2016,"I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory my favorite restaurant. However, I just went to this location and it was horrible I bet you wondering how could you mess up at Cheesecake Factory. First off my bread was cold like it's been in the fridge no straw with my drink. Then I get my food I ordered crab cakes it was only three small cakes for $13.35 and then on top of that they were cold. Also I ordered my favorite buffalo blasts I order these at every Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to I don't know what is wrong with this occasion because they were very very small. I will not be coming back to this location."

Sharon R.,"Banning, CA",3,69,188,4.0,1/9/2016,"Good food yet parking a challenge, long wait and noise level in the restaurant makes having a conversation difficult!"
A C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/13/2016,"So my family and I decide to go out for a big dinner at Cheesecake Factory. I proceed to the front desk to get us a table, wait my turn in line and when it's my turn to speak to the hostess she turns to the couple standing next to me and starts to put them down for a table. I tell her ""ma'am I was standing in line before them"" the couple tries to argue knowing they came in behind us so I again tell the hostess I was waiting in line before them, she doesn't even acknowledge me and proceeds to put the couple down for their table. So I give her a big ""Wow, really??!!"" And walk away before I lose my cool. So disgusted with this place! If my kids weren't hungry I would leave right now!"
Robin P.,"San Diego, CA",79,173,53,4.0,6/26/2015,"We really enjoy this location. I think it's better than the Escondido one... This time was for our daughters birthday. Waiter was very nice. Indulged my questions about tea and coffee. Got us bread right away without us asking. We only had to ask for extra ketchup once.  Husband and I shared sweet corn tamale cakes and steak medallions. Both were very good.  Kids shared corn dog plate with fries.  I ended up getting decaf coffee and husband got Arnold Palmer. Kids both got chocolate milk.  For dessert we got the s'mores cheesecake and split it between the 4 of us. We still had some left on the plate. One of our kids does not really like desserts but she still enjoyed the graham cracker and whipped cream. The plate came out with happy birthday written on it in chocolate syrup, confetti sprinkles, and a candle. Wait staff sang happy birthday too.  It was a great dinner."
Nef F.,"Carmichael, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/22/2016,"I must say I am completely greatful that after my previous incident at the cheesecake factory .. Their management team has gone above and beyond to ensure their customers satisfaction with their dining experiences, I am a firm believer in customer satisfaction as it pertains to any establishment you may choose to spend your money at and the cheesecake factory has completely lived up to that and then some. I most definitely will continue to enjoy my brunches or lunches at the Cheesecake Factory . A big thank you to their Management and Customer service team."
Jack L.,"San Diego, CA",539,275,48,2.0,2/18/2015,"Ugh, why again was I tricked into eating at this place? Too much stuff on the menu considering they aren't great at anything. They were out of the artichoke appetizer again too.  Too long of a wait, too expensive.  I wish Uno's was still in the mall"
Shirley S.,"Encinitas, CA",44,15,,4.0,6/24/2016,"My Dad and I went here on Father's Day and we both loved our food, drinks, prompt seating and service... and the prices were very reasonable. So much to choose from on the menu. We filled our bellies with very delicious food and drink. Didn't have room for any cheesecake so we ordered a couple slices to go. The Salted Caramel was so so good! I can't wait to try something new next time I go. Check it out... You'll love it!"
Ron Ulysses Swanson S.,"Pine Valley, CA",2,45,,5.0,5/11/2015,"My fiancé and I eat here constantly and I've never ordered anything I didn't like. If it's man fuel you need I recommend the chicken and biscuits, it will truly give you the hairy chest and full stomach you've desired. If you're feeling effeminate that day and you crave something on the lighter fare the Chinese chicken salad is good too, just make sure to order light on the noodles otherwise you will be digging through a two foot high pile of styrofoam textured noodles to find the salad. Getting past all of the Fashion Valley self entitled popped collared douche bags that can't drive their dime a dozen BMW's without almost hitting something or someone and take 20 minutes to leave their parking spot after getting in their car is a challenge but I promise this place is worth it. Ron Swanson"
Paul S.,"San Diego, CA",68,160,812,4.0,3/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite restaurants to eat at especially if I'm visiting fashion valley. This one is usually busy due to the location it's in. I Ike this place because I have ordered many foods off their menu and nothing has made me feel like ""I knew I shoulda just stuck to what I always get"" lol. I've tried many of their appetizers, a couple of their entrees, their drinks, and of course their cheesecake. The food and service has always been good ever since my first visit. Even thought it's always busy, the service hasn't been too laggy where you gotta ask twice. If you're looking for good foods to try I recommend their calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken bellagio, steak diane, or their grilled chicken avocado club. I think they're all good selection for pasta to meat to sandwich. There's a lot enjoy here and their dessert menu can just ruin yo lol."
Lindsy H.,"Allen, TX",429,707,1284,3.0,6/4/2012,"You have to throw out ALL health when you walk through the doors. You also have to have extreme patience for waiting as they don't take reservations & there is enough waiting for about 5 people inside. NOTHING on the menu is low cal or low in fat. They itemize every menu item so even if it appears healthy, it's not, but when you go to the Cheescake Factory you have to be okay with that! One thing they do really well, portions. The portions are enough for 3-4 people, but are considered 1 serving - yeah for leftovers!  The salads are large, fresh and good. The free bread is always hot and soft - yum! I do like the pasta, but you cannot leave without trying cheesecake. To be honest, you should order it first so you aren't too full. I normally stick with plain or plain w/strawberries, but this last time I tried the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate and OH MY GOODNESS, I am getting it every time! Fresh blueberries in the crust and cheesecake. The white chocolate mouse on top was so smooth I couldn't stop saying ""this is so good""."
X D.,"San Diego, CA",35,299,1247,5.0,8/28/2015,This place is a great happy hour place especially after shopping. Came here with a coworker and we split a meal. Decent prices and great service.
Vicky K.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,15,1.0,2/27/2014,"I know people loooove this place but not me.  I ve been there several times and the last experience was terrible. Food was so low quality, not delicious at all, chicken was over cooked so hard to bite it. Not worth to spend money."
Angela Z.,"El Cajon, CA",102,129,446,5.0,4/12/2016,My favorite go-to restaurant when you can never figure out where to eat! Try the strawberry lemonade & buffalo blasts for an app!
Jess L.,"Boston, MA",558,151,85,4.0,2/19/2015,"Great food for the quantity, quality and service. In my time in San diegoo I've been here at least 3 times and every time i left with enough food for another meal and a smile on my face.  Highly recommend the jambalaya and they are dog friendly too (: ::thumbs up::"
Mina P.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,4.0,7/7/2016,"One of the most common place my family go over and over for years, food quality are always good except waiting time."
Sam N.,"San Diego, CA",9,1,,5.0,7/6/2016,"Aside from the really good food here, today I had really good experience, I got a messed up order and they had to redo my dish, I was ok with that as it sometimes that happens specially when they are busy. When they brought my dish, the resturant manager came himself and apologized for the wrong order and he told me that the dish is on them just because they made me wait extra time. That was really nice gesture, I always liked that place because of the good food and the cozy atmosphere, now I like it even more because of the really good customer service.Thank you!!"
Nick D.,"Pasadena, CA",35,176,166,4.0,8/25/2014,Not to bad I had the fillet. I asked for medium plus the waitress had no clue what I wanted and said so well done lol. Food is good service not so good.  Then the steak came out but had to wait for a steak knife. :(
