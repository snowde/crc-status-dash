Kenzie L.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/22/2016,"So sad to give them a 1 star! Their food was great and service was great as well! But there was a couple of odd problems. I for sure will not be dining at this location again!  I sat down and began to enjoy my meal but as soon as I got my food I looked over to see 2 people being sat down but it was not just 2 people! It was two people and their pet chicken! We were seated outdoors but I think it is ridiculous that The Cheesecake Factory would allow this at their restaurant! Not only did they allow it, the employees were excited and taking pictures with it. The chicken was shedding feathers and eating off of one of the plates! Discusting!! Then I notice later on in my meal that there was 3 cockroaches in the dining area. So very disappointed! I really struggled to finish eating because of the chicken and the cockroaches."
Graciela G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,1,3.0,12/3/2016,Ok Place for food. The Classic Hamburger was terrible. Service is slow. The only thing I can recommend is the Caesar Salad. Didnt order cheesecake.
Winnie Z.,"Alameda, CA",159,15,11,4.0,3/6/2016,"The food here is decent but not great. But I have to say, the service definitely is making me give 4 stars for this place. We had a party of 22 for a birthday party and our server was the sweetest person there. I don't know what her name is but shout out to the lady with the blond hair tied up in a bun. Not only was she so patient with all the teenagers at our table, she was also trying to figure out ways to make ordering and paying better for all of us. I commend her for the excellent service she provides for this restaurant and the customers."
Luis A.,"San Diego, CA",201,68,9,5.0,5/4/2016,Little on the expensive side for me but the service was second to none. Definitely will consider going back for another special occasion.
Evan L.,"San Diego, CA",182,555,307,2.0,1/25/2014,"The food at the factory is always great so why talk about that. The only thing I had a huge problem with was the service. I went in with 6 of my college buddies and you could tell that our waitress Ashley did not want to wait on us. But since she knew we were a party of 6 or more, she would get a 18% tip no matter what.  About 3 minutes after we ordered my buddy forget to mention that he wanted mushrooms added to his salad and mentioned it to her as she passed by and she actually have him attitude and said well I have to go tell the chef now since I already put your order in. At that time I asked for more water for the table and she came with one pitcher which only filled up half our waters. She then left and didn't bother to fill the rest of the waters so I had to ask another bus boy. Throughout the rest of the meal we all just felt a negative attitude as she clearly didn't want to wait on us. I Come to Cheesecake at least once a month and they always take care of us. We ask for separate bills and they always handle it with no issues and we always leave nice tips. When we asked her, she complained about it and said she would see what she could do. She came back with a full check and a pen and asked us to tell her how much money we want on each card which is not splitting the check for us at all. We easily could have done that without asking for separate checks."
Rene P.,"San Diego, CA",70,57,63,4.0,8/20/2015,"Went last Friday on a first date with a lady friend. It was busy as expected but nothing substantial...perhaps 20 mins, at the most. We were seated and served by Kim. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip with fries. The sandwich was a little smaller than I expected but flavorful! The cheese was perfectly melted and so when I dipped the sandwich into the au jus; the meat, cheese, carmelized onions and bun, all were in perfect sync. The fries were nicely seasoned and with a nice snap too! I also gotta give props to Kim. She was very attentive and personable, with a great smile! :) She definitely made a great night even better!  I'll definitely be ordering this meal again and asking for Kim.  I rate the food and service here...4 slices of delicious cheesecake outta 5!"
John M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/25/2016,As I sat down at a table meant for six and sat down in the seventh seat I ordered my four cheese pasta (yum!). After a long hungering wait I had received my entree. Taking the first bite I noticed something was missing... It was the fourth cheese!!! I had only three cheeses on a four cheese pasta! In attempt they tried to substitute in Cream cheese. I ordered the cheesecake and yet no cheese!!
Maria M.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,10,4.0,10/8/2015,Went here for dinner with my husband. The service and ambiance was excellent. We had an avocado spring roll apetizer. It was not bad but just not our type of taste so we did not finish it. The pasta my husband got was chipotle and it was delicious. Mine just needed a bit more seasoning on the shrimp but the pasta itself was good. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious!!!
Erik G.,"San Diego, CA",877,500,1895,4.0,1/13/2014,"I know, it's a ""chain restaurant"" located in a mall so why regurgitate everything else everyone knows about The Cheesecake Factory again? Well, I'll keep it short.  Been here many more times I'd care to admit, and I can't say I wouldn't recommend - because I would ...it's a lot of food, but it's food that is good.   Few of my favorites that have made my ""go-to"" list:  Miso Salmon (lunch portion is plenty big),  the Classic Burger which is a huge chop house burger that you will find hard to compare to other restaurant style burgers.  Pasta Davinci (the marsala sauce and mushrooms are tasty) and of course the cheesecakes seem to all be winners...I like the Carrot Cake Cheesecake and I think it's called the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream cheesecake.  Kudos to this restaurant for drastically improving their table seating availability by opening up the patio with comfy patio dining tables/chairs and warm heaters well appointed to keep you warm.  Come on an afternoon and it's a really nice atmosphere they've created on that patio."

Judy K.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,15,,4.0,6/21/2016,"There were 15 of us for my grandson's 5th grade graduation and most restaurants will have 2 or more waiters/waitresses, but we had only one and she was amazing. Marta S. was not only proficient, friendly and helpful but offered to take our picture several times. The Cheesecake Factory should feel lucky to have her in their employ. There were a couple of servers to help serve our food. I had ordered the Viet Namese spring rolls which were fresh, light and very tasty. I also had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp. The pasta was tasty and not covered in tomato sauce but diced tomatoes which made it very light to eat. However, and this is why the 4 stars, the shrimp was way overcooked. I ate most of it but would not order it again. The service was excellent and so was most of the food. We'll be back!"
Amber B.,"El Cajon, CA",4,7,2,1.0,9/3/2016,"So disappointed this point around. Everything started out great, with the service and the appetizers. We had ordered our food and for being a busy Friday night we were expecting things to take a while, so we weren't upset when they did. The reason I am giving this place 1 star tonight is because I had ordered the ""Chicken Picatta"" a Cheesecake classic, I had specifically asked for it be without capers because I tend to always get sick when I eat them and I repeated it to the waitress so she understood correctly. Our food comes out 25 minutes later and of course my chicken has capers on it. I was so hungry I had to take a bite of the piece of chicken with the least amount of capers. She took it back and 15 minutes passed, she brought it back and it did not look appetizing what so ever. As I mentioned before, I had taken a bite out of one piece of chicken. On the new plate they gave me, it was the same exact chicken but WASHED under water.... What kind of restaurant reuses poultry??? I was so upset I couldn't even take another bite. The manager didn't even do anything about this issue all she said was ""can i offer you something new"".. She didn't even apologize for the chicken being reused or anything. I will never make my way back to Cheesecake Factory and I know I won't be missing out either. Their food has become so mediocre and plain. Don't waste your time waiting for an hour to get upset."
Big L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,242,397,5.0,5/1/2016,"Brandy is the best server u could ever ask for. We have a group of 14ppl stretched across 3 tables & she has been absolute perfect grace under fire, professional, positive, thoughtful & didn't forget a single thing or drop a single ball the entire time!!!"
Pnina N.,"San Diego, CA",58,58,94,5.0,5/21/2014,My hubby took me to this place for my birthday as a dinner and I really liked the place. It is a big place inside designed well nice bar clean and good atmosphere. we ordered the French salad and a burger and pasta and everything came out tasty fresh .unfortunately we was to full so we couldn't afford a cake as desert. And the price? Was very reasonable too.  Definitely ill come back.   There is alot of parking outside.
Alexis W.,"San Diego, CA",124,46,22,4.0,9/23/2015,The pasta is yummy! So much pasta that I got to box it up and have it for dinner the next night!! I love places like that!  Chocolate cheese cake is delicious!!!!  I recommend trying their cheese cake cause it's bomb!!!  Yum.yum.yum! Whole meal was good :)
Jenna R.,"Post Falls, ID",0,14,,3.0,6/14/2015,"Normally this location has been a Better overall experience,  hence the three stars. Today would have been one or two stars otherwise. We went on a Sunday at 12:30 and got seated promptly outside, however they smashed all the tables so closely together that peoples elbows and purses were constantly floating over our table.  We ordered our two sodas and the fire roasted artichoke. The waitress said they had been having issues with the artichokes but if it was fixed she'd put it in for us which she ended up doing.  When we got our Bread our waitress only brought out the brown bread. No big deal and she brought out the sourdough after but just another thing that went wrong. When the artichoke came out it was so hard that we couldn't take off a leaf without it snapping. We let our waitress know and she said she'd put in another one. The manager then came out and said all the artichokes were hard. So no appetizer for us. My husbands lunch was the Carolina pulled pork which he said was good. My garlic noodles were horrible. First off I ordered the dinner portion not lunch and the serving I got barely covered the bottom of the plate. Second there was no garlic in it. There was hardly any taste at all. I had to douse it with salt to taste anything.  Third after each bite my mouth was coated with what felt like lard. After four or five bites I had to stop. As we sat waiting for our check my stomach started feeling nauseous which I attribute to the noodles. Like I said normally this location is pretty good, but if you go on the weekends or if its busy watch out."
Konnie K.,"San Diego, CA",116,19,1,1.0,1/6/2016,"Customer service FAIL. Preordered a cheesecake for a party (24 hours), instructed to call for curbside p/u. Waited 40 minutes (called in TWICE), on its way out...on its way out ... Went inside. NO clue who I was or what I wanted - order WRONG, nothing ready. 55 minutes later I left with a FROZEN cake and was treated like garbage by the manager - NEVER AGAIN, inside was chaotic - the guy in charge is a moron and out of his level of training."
Isabella F.,"San Diego, CA",16,23,5,5.0,12/6/2014,"Everything great! Food is delicious, costumer services is great.i highly recommend this place. Great times here."
Annie B.,"San Diego, CA",10,129,19,4.0,7/24/2015,"Service was wonderful!  A bit crowded,  but had a very comfy private booth.  The avocado rolls are Amazing!  Great appetizer. Don't recommend the sweet corn tamales.  The flavor was there but the temperature is kinda off. Like a soup that still taste good but is Luke warm.  If ur ok w that then get them bc the flavors are great.  My server was awesome about returning the item and I felt comfortable.  The Tieramasu cheesecake was great.  Good experience. :)"
Nathan K.,"San Diego, CA",63,78,13,1.0,1/6/2016,"Absolutely horrid experience last week during New Year's. Checked in at the front of house and were told the wait was 10 minutes for a table. We were pleased because the place was busy. The buzzer we had went off within 5 minutes. So things were looking good. After we turn in the buzzer, they completely dropped the ball. We waited patiently right next to the front desk while others who came in well after us were seated, one by one. After about 20 minutes, I checked status. Apparently, our name somehow disappeared from their system. They put us on stand by and we had to wait 20 more minutes for a total of 40. We wanted to leave at that point but we were so hungry that we felt compelled to stay. Things got worse. We were seated at one of the worst tables in the joint outside, right next to the server POS. We weren't even acknowledged by a server for at least 10 minutes. When we were, it was some middle aged, apathetic gentleman who seemed to want to be anywhere other than work. No charm or engagement whatsoever. The food was fine. But awful customer service all around. Ruined the entire visit and may motivate us to boycott for a while. Just a shame. Customer service seems to have really taken a hit in recent time. Maybe a lack of leadership from the GM?"
