Emy M.,"San Diego, CA",90,352,994,4.0,5/22/2015,"Date of visit: 5/17/2015 Cheesecake Factory has an overwhelming menu, so I always just get the Spicy Jambalaya Pasta with chicken and shrimp. It's spicy and has pasta, so I'm pretty content. I had a bad experience here once with a worm in my lettuce wraps, so I pretty much stick with the pasta and a piece of strawberry cheesecake if I need that extra splurge. Normally I would give this place 3 stars, but after my experience on Sunday, I needed to comment on how awesome our waitress was. Since Cam's mom was in town, we all wanted to go out for a nice dinner with her. We were also with Cam's sister and her two babies, so we packed them all up in the car and decided to go out for dinner (warning: bad decision). By the time we're seated, it's an hour to bedtime for the one year old, so he's a fussy mess. Banging spoons on the table, crying, acting out, etc. I'm super embarrassed, but our waitress (our heroine) was extremely patient and tried to help by bringing out bananas, juice, a high chair, and anything else that was asked of her. I thought that Cheesecake Factory had kids menus with crayons, but my memory must be failing me.  My food was typical - it's always the same and never fails me, but the service from our waitress was outstanding. The only issue I had this visit was that the hostess told me that a table would be ready in 5-10 minutes, but it really took 30 minutes."
Joshua A.,"San Diego, CA",295,46,96,5.0,3/11/2015,"I can't find one reason why I wouldn't rate this restaurant 5 stars. Rosani, our waitress for the past two times eating here, is absolutely amazing.  I suggest that you ask for her to be your waitress because of the following: -reliable recommendations based on cravings, popularity, & protein of choice. -genuine and friendly service from beginning to end. -constantly checks up on you and refills your water -makes your experience at Cheesecake personable and enjoyable. 5 star service!! I don't think I would want any other waiter. The food was equally amazing! For an appetizer, we ordered the Ahi Carpaccio. It is raw tuna topped with house dressing with avocado and cucumbers on the side. It also comes with a sweet and tangy sauce you can pour over it to add more flavor. For our entrees, we ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Breaded Parmesan Chicken. The chicken Madeira was served with mashed potatoes and was topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and a sauce closely tasting like Marsala. The two chicken breasts were cooked perfectly and I usually don't like mushrooms but they were a perfect match. The breaded chicken tasted similar but was crispy! This was served with mash potatoes and salted asparagus. Had I known they would taste similar I would've ordered something different for a change of taste.  During previous visits here we've had the spicy chipotle BBQ pasta and the seafood gumbo. BOTH WERE DELICIOUS and paired perfectly together to share! Definitely coming back for the service, the huge portions you get, the taste of the food, AND THE CHEESECAKE!!"
Muna J.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,5.0,11/5/2015,"Very good restaurant. The food is very good, I would compare it to the Olive Garden in food quality and along the same prices. Range from 10 to 20 dollars, maybe more for a high quality steak  Definitely recommend eating there--best cheesecake ever!!! Although the slices can run up to 10 dollars a pop :("
Cara M.,"San Diego, CA",21,80,56,3.0,7/31/2015,Never really enjoyed my good here but the drinks are delicious and the cheesecakes are to die for.  Service is on point as well  My last trip I ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger.  Didn't like the meet (over seasoned and kind of tasted like meatloaf and the cheese way too salty) Mojito was delicious.  For dessert got the key lime cheesecake.  Just perfection
G G.,"San Diego, CA",202,143,227,3.0,6/6/2015,"Stopped in for lunch after shopping at Fashion Valley since I had recently found a $25 gift card I had lost for Cheese cake factory.  We had the Asian lettuce wrap, calamari appetizer, and fried crab and cream cheese appetizer. All three were pretty good. We finished off with the mango and key lime cheese cake and raspberry lemon cheese cake for dessert to bring home.  We really liked the mango and key lime cheese cake, it was light and tasty.  Service was ok, nothing to brag or complain about. Cheese cake was a Little pricey at $8 bucks a slice. Lunch cost about double my gift certificate, but at least half of it was covered. Kind of like finding money in your pocket when you are doing the laundry! It was my wife's first time here, she did not realize they had a good variety of food other than cheese cakes. Nice location in Fashion valley, which also means there is usually a lot of customers waiting.  But not for lunch today!"
Suha B.,"El Cajon, CA",114,6,8,1.0,9/3/2016,"So disappointed this point around. Everything started out great, with the service and the appetizers. We had ordered our food and for being a busy Friday night we were expecting things to take a while, so we weren't upset when they did. The reason I am giving this place 1 star tonight is because I had ordered the ""Chicken Picatta"" a Cheesecake classic, I had specifically asked for it be without capers because I tend to always get sick when I eat them and I repeated it to the waitress so she understood correctly. Our food comes out 25 minutes later and of course my chicken has capers on it. I was so hungry I had to take a bite of the piece of chicken with the least amount of capers. She took it back and 15 minutes passed, she brought it back and it did not look appetizing what so ever. As I mentioned before, I had taken a bite out of one piece of chicken. On the new plate they gave me, it was the same exact chicken but WASHED under water.... What kind of restaurant reuses poultry??? I was so upset I couldn't even take another bite. The manager didn't even do anything about this issue all she said was ""can i offer you something new"".. She didn't even apologize for the chicken being reused or anything. I will never make my way back to Cheesecake Factory and I know I won't be missing out either. Their food has become so mediocre and plain. Don't waste your time waiting for an hour to get upset."
Issac G.,"San Diego, CA",95,55,61,4.0,7/18/2015,"I liked the layout of this location. The surrounding patios make the place look nice and inviting. My gf and I split the meatloaf which came with mashed potatos and corn. The corn, mixed with zuchini and lightly peppered, was a pleasant surprise!"
Erin D.,"Houston, TX",14,904,882,2.0,5/2/2014,"I know what you're saying - the Cheesecake Factory? Why go there? The answer: It's the only place to eat (aside from PF Chang's) close to where I was working. FYI don't follow the signs to the Cheesecake Factory if you enter off of Fashion Valley drive. It's faster and shorter to go in the opposite direction of the signs.  Parking was horrendous, which I suppose is expected at a mall. If you've only got 30 minutes for lunch, forget it. You will spend at least 20 minutes trying to find parking. There is a parking garage behind the Cheesecake Factory. If you want to park on the first floor, it's $3. However, if you're willing to go up and down some stairs, you can park for free on the second or third levels. To enter the free parking part (because the garage has two separate entrances for paid and non-paid), enter RIGHT behind the cheesecake factory. I have never seen a split parking garage before. Usually everyone in the garage pays the same price (or it's completely free). Because parking was such a pain, I called to ask about the wait time. The guy who answered said there was no wait. Upon arrival, there was a 5 minute wait. This doesn't seem long, but if you're on a timed lunch break (thankfully I was not), keep this in mind. I ordered the pizza and salad lunch special. The green salad already comes with a viniagrette, so be aware. I got the supreme pizza with everything (sans olives) on it, and it was pretty decent. I could only eat half of the salad and half of the pizza, so the lunch portion is still generous. The table next to me ordered salads, and I thought they were HUGE. Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is not my favorite place to eat. I probably should've ordered a cheesecake, but there was no time. My bill was $14.91 including tax and tip. I suppose that's not too bad for lunch, and I was able to take half of the pizza home. However, I would probably try to find someplace else to go for lunch, somewhere preferably with easily accessible parking!"
Eleanor T.,"Coquitlam, Canada",1,38,7,5.0,4/23/2016,"Stopped in for takeout as my daughter ate most of my husband's actual dinner and we wanted to pick up dessert. Ordered over the telephone for kids Alfredo with fettuccine instead of bow tie pasta and was quoted 10-15 min. Arrived in 7 min and proceeded to order cheesecake. We were pleasantly surprised that our order was ready. By Canadian standards, this kids meal was massive. It was the size of an adult portion and even came in an adult take out container.  Daughter ate a huge portion and the rest was enough to fill up my hubby.  Hubby and I ordered our classic favourites - ultimate red velvet cheesecake and original cheesecake. Delicious as per usual!"
Marvin S.,"San Diego, CA",689,491,1260,4.0,1/31/2014,"I just realized through my insane writing of my Yelp reviews today that I did not include a very long overdue update for one of my favorite places to eat in San Diego, The Cheesecake Factory! Okay, so lets get some of the negatives out there, in case you didn't know. It's located in Fashion Valley. The parking is horrendous most of the times. Their customer service is spotty. When it's busy, there will be a long wait, period. Seriously, go eat somewhere else. The portions are huge, so you eat way too much, which means too many calories and you get fat. The place is surely not where you want to go on a budget. With that all being said, coming here for me has always been about the special occasion. Call me a huge sap, it just is what it is for me. What's great about it is that this place can seat a pretty huge party when carefully thought out. Now I'm not saying the wait will be any less and in fact they don't take reservations until 11am, I believe. Their menu is very expansive and they do a lot of it very very well! Easy to please a group of people that want it all! This last visit, my wife and I came after she got off work and I had just taken leave from transferring off the Gridley. I was very pleased that there was no wait on a weeknight and we got seated immediately. One thing I noticed was the seating outside had been upgraded. Yeah, I asked to sit outside to enjoy our San Diego winter! Once we got out there, I noticed that there seemed to not be an uncomfortable booth or chair in sight. We asked to be moved once because one of the heaters did not reach to my seat. DAMN, eating outside with the heaters on you and the very very nice comfortable seats set the mood just right on the night. I loved it! As far as our meal, I had the tried and true Chicken Madeira with all aspargus and my wife had a small caesar salad with shrimp, both of which were great! Her shrimp was grilled and was cooked perfectly. My dish was delish, as always and I believe the best dish here! We pretty much split the Chicken Madeira since my knew if she didn't get any at first, that I would eventually destroy it by myself in record time! Our service was way better than normal on this occasion, as they were all so attentive. I'd love for it to stay this consistent! Oh, of course we got a slice of cheesecake. Their blueberry cheesecake was so f'in good. We killed it."
Nina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,407,1100,5.0,7/12/2015,"We went in for lunch and it wasn't that busy as it usually is at this location and it took the food a while before it came out, but definitely a five star experience because our waiter Jonathan was one of the best waiters that I've had in along time!! He was friendly, and attentive and made the experience awesome!"
Kristin D.,"Santee, CA",2,14,,5.0,5/29/2016,"Love this place it's my current favorite! The spicy chicken chipotle pasta or the filet Mignon dish is excellent. My hubby and I love the loaded baked potato tots. I probably way here like 2x a week and well worth it. The staff is always great, I couldn't be more pleased with our service. The blueberry mojitos are darn good as well! :)"
Christina C.,"Houston, TX",135,612,225,4.0,5/19/2015,The wait and the line took up to an hour on a Friday night. We were seated outside and it was a bit chilly but they had outdoor heaters. The food and service were decent. The ahi tuna tartare and pizza were great. My husband liked his hamburger. My mom thought her fettuccini Alfredo was good. This is a popular chain restaurant in Fashion Valley so be ready for a  wait. I would come back. I always do.
Justin H.,"Bellingham, WA",311,119,238,4.0,11/6/2013,"Soo I live right across the street from this place and don't go nearly enough!  Their prices aren't too crazy for the huge variety of dishes they have to offer. There cocktails are awesome, had the Long Island icetea while my buddies had the Mai tai (strongest drink on the menu just to let ya know)  We went with the spinach dip and cheesy garlic bread as appetizers. Both were great, except for the Parmesan dip that came with the garlic break was about 90% oil! No bueno.  Besides that though, the food as a whole is great, the fish tacos are probably the best thing on the menu!  Overall an excellent restaurant with great customer service, our waitress was very friendly and helpful, which definitely made the dining experience more pleasurable.  Wonderful Restaurant through and through!"
Jason W.,"San Diego, CA",199,72,202,4.0,6/22/2014,"I came here today for the first time in over 5 years.  They still have a huge menu as I remembered.  Wait staff were excellent. This place has a robust gluten free menu.  I had the gluten free shepherd's pie.  The gravy/sauce was delicious.   This place has terrific tasting food.  Come here if you plan on taking a nap shortly after.  You may want to check out a place with a lighter menu if you plan on doing activities, like shopping, after eating."
Vivianna A.,"Lemon Grove, CA",5,31,41,5.0,4/1/2015,"Sean you are the best love your service well done!!!  gave us extra bread and sooo nice, and he took the time to talk with us !!! Great girls night !!!!"
Jenn H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,8,,2.0,8/2/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but the service just sucked. Our waitress was amazing!! But the hostess was rude. We walked for my friends birthday & let her know & all she says is ""ok"" then rolled her eyes. Then we came back up & asked if we could sit outside & she then again had attitude assumed we wouldn't be ok with a longer wait. You know when you walk into a restaurant you expect good service, THATS WHY THEY PAY YOU. But anyways, we told the manager & we hope she takes it into consideration. By the way, she was working at 4:30pm on Tuesday the 2nd with Miley Cryrus hair buns."
Curtis K.,"San Diego, CA",50,260,271,4.0,5/17/2015,"Lots of great options. They are my favorite chain restaurant. They don't have a good beer selection, but their mixed drink menu makes up for that."
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,4.0,2/5/2014,"We visited with a large group of friends. The service was impeccable! They didn't miss a beat. Even the small children were kept happy with their meals. Large portions. Split an entree if you expect to have one of the delicious desserts and THAT is a must. The menu is huge. If you can't find anything here you like, there is definitely something wrong with you. We had the Steak Diane/Hibachi Steak combo, added a side of broccoli. Done perfectly. Had to take the tiramasu cheesecake to go....for a midnight snack. They even have omelets served all day and they are huge! I highly recommend making this your dining choice. This was my first time to this cheesecake factory and I was extremely delighted with the whole experience. Atmosphere was very good, just a bit noisy being the location. Dining inside or in the courtyard is available with great people watching."
Phuong G.,"National City, CA",259,341,1139,4.0,5/16/2015,Your typical Pasta dishes... I eat here every now and then when I'm having a major craving for pasta and cheesecake
