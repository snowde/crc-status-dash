Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,4.0,9/1/2013,"I actually enjoyed my lunch more than I thought I was going to. The only problem was at the beginning when the hostess sat me at a section, where unbeknown to her, the server for that section was late to work; so after a bit of a wait, I had to flag down a waitress from another section to take my order. She was very kind, sympathetic, and more than willing to help out. Her name was Claudia. Thank you Claudia! I was on a lunch break so I did not get all involved with my order, so I quickly ordered the Ahi Tartare for $6.95, featured on their SkinnyLicious menu, (  a good price, and the Skinny Chicken Salad Sandwich for $9.95 which came with a small spring salad ( ).  The meal started out with their staple table bread, a white baguette and a wheat loaf which were very good buttered or not. ( ) Next, the Ahi Tartare arrived nicely piled on a bed of ripe chopped avocado drizzled with a soy ginger sesame sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. ( ) It was a very light and refreshing portion. The tartare was very good and had no fishy favor what so ever. The little crispy sliced wontons were an excellent vessel to eat it with. ( ) The soy ginger was light and had a subtle flavor that did not overrun the Ahi and avocado. The chicken salad sandwich came served on some brioche and the tender all white meat chicken was mixed with roasted almonds, mayonnaise, some scallions, and served with sliced tomatoes and lettuce. ( ) The chicken salad was well balanced from its seasoning, to the amount of chicken, almonds, and mayo. ( ) The flavor was mild and enjoyable. The spring salad was simple, but the slightly acidic vinaigrette was very good. ( ) This a good place to come for a business lunch, celebration, or just to get some good food, but just make sure your sever is there before you are seated. Nevertheless, the good was quite good. The mystery of the missing server continues..."
Finola K.,"Rye, NY",1,7,,1.0,9/3/2015,"Not my first time here or to any Cheesecake Factory which is probably why I'm disappointed at the service and quality of the food.  We sit down to dinner and after ordering I find a decent size insect marching across the table. I kill it with my napkin & show the waitress. She apologies, a manager comes over to apologize (mentions how often they spray for bugs, etc). I don't make a big deal, I just ask for a new napkin.  After our appetizer (edamame which was the best part of dinner), we are waiting & waiting for our meal. About 45 minutes later both dishes (side of meatballs & chicken di pane) come out and they are cold. After waiting that long how could they be cold? The meals go back and after another 20 minutes they arrive. The food is fine, not great, nothing special.  Upon receipt of the check, nothing was deducted and no offer for a complimentary dessert. I mean after finding bugs on your table, waiting over an hour for your meal and initially having it served cold, couldn't you at least offer a free dessert or comp some part of the check??  We paid with gift cards we received as a gift because we have no intention of coming back. There are plenty of other great places nearby to eat so do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
Raul G.,"San Diego, CA",105,11,18,5.0,2/23/2015,"I was absolutely delighted again with the quick service, attention to our needs, the cleanliness and my meal. The food was high quality without the usual high price. Of course we had to try the original cheesecake with strawberries. They do not cut back on portions here, two of shared the dessert and all felt well sated. Despite being a chain restaurant I was extremely pleased overall."
Sp B.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,2,3.0,8/6/2015,Oversized plate for small tables. Small portion for the price but you are going to get filled with tasty mashed potato. Yikes! Will come back just for fun but I can probably eat the same menu some place else. Will someone turn the music volume down. Poor waitress can't hear our orders when we're speaking right in front of her.
Arthur P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/20/2016,I honestly don't like leaving negative reviews but when things are bad on more than a couple occasions I feel like people should know. My girlfriend likes this place so we get it pretty often and pick it up curbside. And out of our last 10 orders 7 have had either something missing or just plain wrong. I will not be eating here anymore.
Angela D.,"San Diego, CA",70,29,48,3.0,6/21/2015,"Ordered the macaroni cheeseburger, it was alright was hoping it'll be a bigger size for the amount it cost or that it'd be more flavorful. Also got the tuxedo cheesecake. The cheesecakes hasn't been a disappointment to me yet. Let's hope it won't ever because they're always worth it. I prefer to share them most of the time or save some because it's definitely sweet."
Mijin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,4,1.0,11/19/2015,"Very extremely disappointed!!!!!!!!! My favorite dish from here was the thai lettuce wrap. HOWEVER, they totally disregarded washing their vegetables and had little tiny insects crawling all over my lettuce. I was very disgusted in seeing this and will not ever come here again! What a lack of professionalism they had!!!"
YaiYai S.,"Ramona, CA",3,28,2,5.0,1/19/2016,Excellent service and food. Hot fresh bread with flavorful Tortilla soup. The service was excellent.
Tine B.,"San Diego, CA",396,39,623,3.0,12/23/2015,"12/22/2015 came here @ 7:30 for dinner! There was barely a line but was told waiting time was 40min. so we decided to go shopping to kill time. 40min. had already passed so I decided to go back & wonder why they haven't called us in yet. I asked the hostess how much longer & they stated it would take 15 more minutes. 30 minutes passed + they seated others who had the same # of people in the party that had came in after us. I don't know why or if it was Bc I had my son with me & wanted to sit us in an area in the back. I was frustrated & angry. It's not like my son needed a high chair or a booster seat so any seat would've been fine for us 3. After waiting for almost 2 hours with my son hungry and whining, they finally took us in. I gave one star for the food for it was served fast, another star for the quality of food & the last star for the lady who had seated us and apologized for the wait. As far as the hostess, no stars, did not even apologize & looked totally lost when working ESP when it got busy. Totally ruined the beginning of our night. I know it's the holidays but like I said, it wasn't even busy when we first arrived. Not to mention the dirty silver ware we had on the table & just because I have a kid doesn't mean you have to wait for a back table by the bathroom to stick us in. There was multiple tables others had got before us that came AFTER us."
Cathleen F.,"Lakewood, CA",259,235,82,4.0,8/31/2013,"Who Doesn't love Cheesecake! The selection of cheese cakes can be overwhelming, but you really can't go wrong with what ever you choice! Food portions are really LARGE, I ordered a half salad and it was huge! No complaints, it was delis...... I would suggest your share when possible. You will notice Everyone leaves with doggie bags....  I would have given a higher score, but the wait was long, and the hostess staff was a little bit of a mess."
Maverick W.,"San Diego, CA",5,28,31,5.0,5/3/2015,"Amazing service each time I go, very attentive staff! Loved the Romano chicken pasta plate"
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,4.0,6/30/2011,"When your woman is calling the shots at mealtime, this is where you go. Especially when you're not on a budget because the bill can get pretty steep if you let yourself go.  To me, it's like when you go into a womens clothing store and you're left to watch the bag when she goes into the fitting room. Not exactly a dude's joint but they do serve some tasty grub. I recommend the Chicken/Shrimp Jambalaya Pasta. Females do come here together in groups, all clutching their gem studded smartphones and fancy bags.  Service here is pretty good, btw.  So guys, if you're in the doghouse or would like to score extra points with your women, bring the party over here. You never know, the party may continue in your pants after your girl finishes her thick slice of cheesecake.  Wink, wink."
Daniel L.,"San Diego, CA",6,5,1,3.0,5/14/2016,Good place with great service but the floor was really dangerous because she was really oil and with water
Brad B.,"San Diego, CA",4917,964,1518,2.0,5/23/2013,"Man oh man... what has happened to The Cheesecake Factory? At one point in time I didn't mind the long wait and elevated prices for a decent dining experience at this location, but slowly it's slipped down a slippery slope. I still do (unconditionally) love the avocado egg rolls but just about everything else seems to have gone way downhill. Â The half chicken was at one point of time one of my faves but the last time I ordered it, it was bland and certainly lived up to the rule of ""don't order the chicken."" I loved ordering the chicken! The prices can no longer be justified with such a decrease in quality but the service has always been nothing short of fantastic. Besides the time the manager blew me off with a ""what do you want me to do about it"" answer when dealing with an undercooked pork chop, I can't complain about anyone who has ever touched the table during any of my visits. Training in the front of house still seems to be a priority but behind the scenes has definitely suffered. It's a shame to see a restaurant that at one time aimed for excellence regardless of their size to take such a turn. It took me several poor visits to write this review but it had to be done with such consistent disregard for maintaining a certain level quality. Maybe for someone's dying wish or final meal I will give it another try and another $150 - $200 of my hard earned money."
Kaitlyn G.,"Telluride, CO",67,2,1,1.0,11/21/2015,"Appetizers and drinks at the bar was great but than things went downhill. Our waitress was not attentive. My pasta was ridiculously garlicky and the shrimp tasted very fishy. I had two bites, that was all I could do. Our waitress finally came back later while everyone was almost done eating. I smacked on my husbands fries and bread so I didn't really want anything else, especially to have to wait half hour for it. The manager refused to comp the meal and was not helpful. Bad customer service, but I guess when your a chain and busy you don't really care how your customers feel."
Craig W.,"Cobb, CA",3,19,8,4.0,5/11/2015,"It seems kinda silly to review a large chain restaurant, but I think it is worth mentioning a few things. First and foremost, it's all about the chicken and biscuit. I order the chick and bis every time I come in. I truly look forward to this and even arrange my travel plans to either allow me to dine for lunch or dinner. I even love the peas... A monumental admission for me.  Service has also been great for me. My servers have always been courteous and friendly. I know that when I come here, I am going to be well taken care of.  Of course, you may note that I only gave a four star rating. My sole objections stem from the somewhat high prices and the loud dining room. I have a very difficult time holding a conversation during dinner as most of the time I feel like I have to yell across the table. There is a very nice outdoor dining, but I usually prefer to be indoors.  Would I eat here again? Â As I mentioned, I dine here every time I find myself in San Diego. I suspect that the trend will continue long into the future!"
Mary A.,"San Diego, CA",17,1,,5.0,2/16/2015,"Absolutely LOVE this place! The house bread,appetizers,the chicken madera ..... Anddddd of course,the cakes !!! My family and I eat there at least 2/month. The waiting can be long but I can say totally worth it."
Danielle C.,"Oceanside, CA",206,121,454,5.0,3/25/2015,My favorite restaurant. Love this place. Food is rockin. Desserts are even better. Could just eat the appetizers by themselves. My husband and I had our first date at this restaurant. By my request cause it's my favorite. A year later he proposed to me at this restaurant. And a few months later we got married at the courthouse and our family all joined us for a lunch at this restaurant. Many great memories at the Cheesecake Factory. My only problem is I often forget to save room for the cheesecake. lol!
Vivian V.,"San Diego, CA",64,187,118,5.0,3/15/2015,"The only problem with this place is that it's incredibly busy on weekend nights. The upside is that the extensive patio has lots of heaters and is a lot more comfortable to sit in the waiting by the bar for a table to open up. My favorite foods to eat here are the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and I like the bowtie pasta with roasted garlic and chicken, and the chicken Madeira is very good as well. The pizzas are awesome as well and good for the picky eaters in your group. To finish, white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is my jam. Service here has always been great. Love to order a Makers Old Fashioned at the bar. Some thinks I've tried I haven't like such as the thai cashew chicken which is marked as Spicy on the menu but is very mild. I didn't find this entree appetizing. There's always something new on the menu to try I also love their tuna tataki salad with seared ahi as an entree for a light lunch."
Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,3.0,6/5/2013,"This being a famous chain, I have no issue with agreeing with the Yelp consensus the Cheesecake Factory is a 3 to 3.5 Stars on any given day. It's A-OK and I still contend this place offers perhaps the largest menu of any second-tier chain. But if I could add a bit of value to reviewing this particular location: You should know parking and entrance are a bit awkward. Three sides of the property are completely fenced off because of renovations. If you attempt to park directly adjacent to the building, you are going to get boxed into a dead-end parking lot and it isn't pretty!!! Just save yourself some time and park across the street from it - not in the garage."
