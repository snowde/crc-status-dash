Julie D.,"San Diego, CA",36,62,28,4.0,5/20/2015,"My favorite thing to do is come here at a busy time and get a spot for 2 or 3 at the open seating section. I always order the salads off the skinnyliciois menu and have never been disappointed. My top favorites are the Asian salad and the chopped salad. Both are very yummy and flavorful! Also can't pass up the free bread appetizer to start. I'm always too full for the cheesecake dessert but they sure do look delicious! My only complaint is that the service can be pretty bad sometimes. The server sometimes doesn't come to the table for a while, forgets to bring things, and the bill has come out incorrect."
Ray P.,"San Diego, CA",139,179,412,4.0,11/13/2014,"I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I make an exception for The Cheesecake Factory. They have a huge menu with a good variety of different dishes. Anybody can find something that will satisfy their palates. I've been here so many times and it's always difficult to decide! Of course, the free bread and butter allows you to peruse the menu for a while even if you're starving. Hahaha! My favorites here are the lettuce wraps, tuna tataki salad, their pastas and their steaks. This place is, of course, known for its huge portions and it's always a good idea to ask for a to-go box so you have room for one of their rich and delectable cheesecakes. Speaking of cheesecakes, they have a lot of varieties from the original to fruity to creamy and chocolaty. I usually get something with chocolate, but the banana cream and blueberry are also delicious. They also have other non-cheesecake desserts but I've never really tried them. The Cheesecake Factory is a popular place so be sure to plan ahead especially if you're eating during peak times. They do not take reservations and your entire party has to present before they will seat you. The service is always stellar and the service staff is knowledgeable with their menu."
Audra B.,"Albany, OR",28,121,68,4.0,12/3/2015,"All Cheesecake factories are sooo noisy! But the service was good, food is good for a chain restaurant, and drinks are made right! This location could benefit from having a larger and/or more televisions in the bar."
E O.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,4,2.0,6/8/2015,"Ordered Factory nachos to go last night. They were definitely not as good as when you order them at the restaurant. The bottom layer was naked chips and portion was smaller. Was told at the restaurant last time that they added this cheese sauce to prevent this problem. Last time we ordered them inside, they were delicious. I was expecting possibly a few soggy ones or maybe room temp, since we live 10 min away, which I would not have minded at all, but this time they did not impress- skimpy on the cheese sauce! Original cheesecake was just ok - mom's from scratch still the best ever. Better not to order nachos to go like I did ... (Though they were nice to include and wrap up some bread to go and a pat of butter, which I was not expecting)"
Judith V.,"Long Beach, CA",70,4,,5.0,4/23/2016,We came for a bachelorette getaway and went to dinner there because it was so late and it was one out of the two options we have and OUR service Was GREAT!!! Jess was very polite and knew exactly what to recommend!!!! We give her 5 stars!!!!
John S.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/22/2017,"Probably the least cleanliest medium upscale chain restaurant we have been at and does not seem to be a one time thing. Beware of outdoor dining. Most scraps are brushed off into the floor so the birds can take care of it and the table beside us was barely wiped down and the buster spilled milk all over the seat but set the table. The milk can be seen dripping down the side of the seat and the host still seated a group of teenagers who didn't notice till they sat in it. The bathrooms are just as bad and overloaded with toilet paper and my wife was afraid to flush(just like the everyone before.) what's said is there was an employee in there wiping down the toilets when my wife went in there. But to top it all off the steak she ordered had a medium length hair in it. The waitress promptly took it back and returned with a steak that just happened to be on the grill. What's amazing is it had the same side cut she had put in it before returning. Unfortunately, it will be the last time we attend.  She works at the health department so it wont be the last time someone from inspections doesn't know. If the much care is given to the front one can only imagine what is going on in the back."
G R.,"San Diego, CA",0,30,,3.0,10/21/2016,Very consistent quality of food and service! The wait is too long and its always too crowded!
Angela A.,"Yuma, AZ",14,11,139,4.0,6/6/2015,"My meal was wonderful. I started with the Tuna Tartare, which to me is one of the best things I have eaten. Sort of a deconstructed sushi roll minus the seaweed and with avocado. I had two drinks, the Hibiscus martini and the Asian pear. The Asian pear was better in my opinion as it was not as sweet. The Grilled Steak Medallions were delicious. Cooked just as I asked, medium rare. A wonderful Madeira sauce with asparagus, cherry tomatoes (which were cut in half, thank you very much) and mushrooms served over mashed potatoes. Our server was attentive and friendly. An overall great experience."
Izzy H.,"Orange, CA",282,143,147,4.0,9/4/2013,"""This is my solace from law school"" This Cheesecake Factory has been my solace from law school.  Each bite dissolved, although temporary, my stress away from law school.  For a short moment, I was able to escape by delicious composition of their heavenly cheesecakes.  I enjoy, let be restate that, I love this Cheesecake Factory.  Their lunch menu portion is just perfect and their services are prompt.  From the greeters, runners, and the servers, their service always have been precise and informative.  The servers have vast knowledge and are not afraid to give you any recommendations.  Additionally, the runners, what I like to call the unsung heroes, are simply great.  I particularly enjoy this Cheesecake establishment based on location,  the top-notch food quality and the singular service.  Definitely, coming back to this establishment.  Highly recommended!!"
Melody R.,"San Diego, CA",277,125,91,4.0,10/13/2013,"How can you not like the Cheesecake Factory? Seriously...this place is pretty damn good for being a chain and heating up pre-made meals. Well I'm sure they are doing more than just using the microwave but whatever it is, I don't care. It tastes delicious. But here's the catch, everything on the menu is going to give you more than your day's worth of recommended calories....and that's why we have the saying ""everything that tastes good is bad for you"". Indeed it is. Indeed.  And of course if you come here, you simply cannot go without getting cheesecake. I mean the place is called the Cheesecake Factory for crying out loud. YOU HAVE TO! Ugh and they top it with two large dollops of freshly whipped cream. Oh my poor arteries. I do apologize...but I have to eat the cheesecake! There's some weird allure that this restaurant emits....anyone else catch it?"
Travis L.,"Lakeside, CA",0,10,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"This place has an incredibly mediocre menu to start. If you find something you would care to enjoy other than cheesecake best of luck because they may be out of it. My visit included a list of ten (10) entrees they ran out of ingredients to make. The management team has ZERO P.R. ability. The first table we sat at had hairs on the bread plates along with food sprawled over the seats of our chairs. Thank you folks for the epic fail, I paid $20 to NOT eat dinner.... Man this place sucks. Step it up and show your guests you care about more than their money."
Kaitlyn K.,"La Habra, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/24/2015,"We came on a Monday night. A party of 8, they told us it would be 30 minutes for an inside table, we waited 45 and they gave us an outside table! Our waitress was horrible. So rude and barely paid any attention to us.  We were constantly asking OTHER waiters to fill a drink b/c she wasn't around.  The food was not nearly as good as others we have been too. Lastly, we were celebrating 2 birthdays.  When we got the ice cream it was melted!!"
Cynthia H.,"San Diego, CA",8,24,12,3.0,4/2/2015,"Overall, it was a nice experience. The food was delicious and so were the desserts. We went as a family and we got the Thai lettuce wraps, chicken costaletta, and the chicken bellagio. For dessert we ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it was good as well. Then why only three stars? Because it's way too pricey and the wait time for your food to come is awfully too long!"
Sarah M.,"El Cajon, CA",74,7,,5.0,3/18/2016,"My family and I favorite place. Very clean and fancy,,  You just need to wait a while to get your order but they gave you the miracle bread,, it is so good. Highly recommended"
Thuy C.,"San Diego, CA",85,152,186,3.0,3/17/2014,Really yummy for a chain restaurant! The ratings is simply for the inconsistent service that you will get. We come to this specific location numerous times and we are always waiting forever to be seated (mainly because it's in a prime location). Whether it's early in the morning or late at night you can expect to wait for 45 minutes so make reservations instead. The service is always inconsistent and it takes forever for your waiter to get your order. The food = 4.5 stars!
Nicole S.,"Bonita, CA",1,10,,1.0,6/1/2016,"First time coming here with my fiancé. This was only our second time to a Cheesecake Factory, our first time was downtown and it was so nice the food and service so we had high expectations. We came today on June 1, 2016 at around 2pm. Our waiter Joseph B ruined the experience for us. He was rude from the beginning almost like he had something against us! He threw a napkin on our table after he took our order. As soon as he served us he took off fast without even asking us if we needed any condiments or anything, so we had to wait until we saw him to ask. He never came to check on us! He made it seem like we weren't worthy customers when he spoke to us. The ONLY time he tried to be nice was when he gave our check so he could get a tip! Hell no! Other than that the food was good and the other workers were friendly. Maybe it was the end of this guys shift or something."
Pamela C.,"Alhambra, CA",0,9,6,3.0,9/11/2016,"Went on a Sunday at 2:15 .. So we expected a wait .. Waited 30 min when our pager lights when  on they called us back only to wait at a second desk for another 10 min  ... I have been to two other Cheesecake Factory and when your pager goes off and they call you to go back you get seated right away .. So didn't like we had to wait again in a little cramped area ...  We were seated ... And waitress came pretty quick .. Just not very friendly ...waiting 20 minutes for food to come out , so waitress did give  us 3 baskets of bread .. food order did not come out correctly so had to ask the guy cleaning tables to bring us what we were missing... Food ok .. Just overpriced for what it was , but we ordered 2 cheesecakes .. Now that was delicious !  If I could rate just the cheesecake I would rate that 5 stars..  So I would say this Cheesecake Factory location needs to work on their taking back routine don't call people back unless your ready to seat them ... Quality of food should improve .. Waitress should improve on being more friendly ... Cheesecake outstanding .. Don't change anything..."
Becky F.,"San Diego, CA",156,4,,5.0,9/9/2016,"A close girlfriend and I decided to go out for a night on the town. After a wonderful night of laughs we decided to get a nightcap at fashion valleys own Cheesecake Factory. Our outside seating was perfect, there was heaters spaced out with candles to set the mood. After some long deliberation over the copious amount of cheesecake on the menu, we asked our server Jennie for her recommendations. She asked what we liked and gave us different suggestions, eventually we settled on the classic strawberry cheesecake. The simplicity of the original cheesecake paired perfectly with our vanilla ice cream and crisp strawberry topping. The taste of this dessert was good but the dessert paired with the exceptional service from our server Jennie, was what really made this experience unique and memorable. Jennie was attentive, sweet, and charming. I recommend anyone in the area looking for a fine experience and mouthwatering cuisine to come to the Cheesecake Factory and request to sit in jennie's section."
Clint P.,"LA JOLLA, CA",0,19,,1.0,12/30/2014,"Terrible service and no heart in my artichoke. The waitress took almost 30 minutes to take our order.  She told us she was going to bring us bread, but never did.  Didn't come around to fill my empty water glass.  Waitress had a snotty attitude.  Coffee was cold.  When she delivered our artichokes, the heart was cut out of them!   What good is an artichoke without a heart, for that is the best part."
Cynthia Q.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2017,"I started going to the cheesecake factory in January 2017 and so far I have visited 10 times including today. Out of those 10, 3 were above and beyond great, 6 were around average maybe less but today. Today was the worst. I called a head of time to let them know a party of 8 celebrating a birthday with 4 kids under the age of 8 and wanted to be seated outside away from bothering people eating late lunch early dinner (reservation was around 130). I get I had to wait when we got there ( we arrived 10minutes early) and were seated about 15 minutes later. The waitresses was nice so far so good , got our drinks have is time to look at the menu and order. All of this was great, it wasn't busy but not calm in the restaurant. While waiting for our food to arrive we were introduced to Paul who was supposed to be our waiter but had been on lunch. Well this is where it all went down hill. We had asked for the umbrella to be closed because it was windy we didn't have any of their fancy heaters near by and the sun was rather nice on the skin rather than burning. We're told one of the busboys would close it (they never came) we received our food 40+ minutes later (almost 230 by now) and it was cold ( fried chicken tenders with fries for the kids and my spicy chicken chipotle pasta) and still no sight or interaction with Paul since our introduction. 20 minutes later (seriously we eat rather fast or maybe starving from all the wait) still no Paul, no closed umbrella, freezing cold , empty plates and waiting for the check. Another 20 minutes or so we finally see Paul where at this point forget a whole cake for birthday I want to get to my car and get warm. Got the bill left the money I was over it. This whole entire time I saw other waiters dedicating their time on their designated tables (not rush hour yet ) and constantly making sure they were ok and my family was just THERE..... I for sure will not be stopping by to this location any time soon I rather wait for a table at red lobster where I know I will be given my food right out of the oven and actual be bothered by my waiter for constantly asking if I need a refill than coming back here. I wish you good luck to those who decide to visit."
