Kalei M.,"San Diego, CA",7,11,1,5.0,3/18/2016,I've been here plenty of times and have never been disappointed. Tonight I came in around 9:30 right after the mall closed and it was packed. I got a table quickly because I came by myself. I had the skinny cosmo and chicken samosas small plate. Both were amazing! Samosas were under 490 calories. I sat in the patio next to a heater and it wasn't too loud. Definitely family friendly. Everything I ordered was great and came quickly. Service was also amazing.
Angie S.,"Castro Valley, CA",265,191,64,2.0,12/6/2014,"Yeah yeah yeah, how can we expect great flavors from a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory? Until today, i hadnt been to a Cheesecake Factory since high school, which was nearly 5 years ago! The days when we'd bop around the mall for hours and eat here with our obnoxious yellow Forever 21 shopping bags and order virgin daquiris. Embarrassing! Anyways, after December Nights we were in the romantic holiday mood and had some time to kill before our 10:45 movie so we decided to come here. The only reason i didnt give 1 star is because our server, Marshall was so polite and on top of his stuff. He checked up on us frequently and cracked some jokes and made the experience a lot better. We ordered the fettucine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo. I also had a pineapple moscow mule. The food was really below average. I probably would have been happier with my food at a Dennys or something.  The fettucine was pretty okay but it was way to saucy and the sun dried tomatoes were just plopped right on top of the pasta. The combo meal was a whole 'nother diasaster. Everything was strangely spicy and salty yet extremely bland at the same time. The shrimp was so peppery and the batter on the shrimp tasted like pure flour. The sauce was sooo incredibly bland yet i could not stop drinking water which means there had to have been so much salt in them! I asked for the steak diane to be cooked medium but they came back soo overcooked and past well done and the sauce on them was dreadful. Lastly, the combo came with mashed potatoes but they were hardened and cold by the time they got to me. The pineapple moscow mule was alright but there was no ginger or lime flavor. It just tasted like pineapple and vodka. Pretty dissapointing for $10.  Honestly, after tonight i definitely remember why i have not come here in over 5 years. It is extremely overpriced and the food is just not good! The service was great, but if im going to pay over $50 for dinner, i'd rather go somewhere with food that is more palatable."
Jay R.,"San Diego, CA",265,110,142,3.0,4/20/2013,"I have been here a few times but I am going to write about my experience last month for me &the boyfriend's 6 month anniversary.  Yes, Im 25 &likes to celebrate every month to remind me that I have survived another month with my boyfriend. Lol jk! haha, but hey it is an excuse to go out and eat and what not! We came here on a weekday for lunch. No wait or line. Score! Our orders: Mine: Lemon Half chicken w/ sides of carrots and mashed potatoes (around $15) - Tasted exactly like rotisserie chicken that you can get from costco. Not as tender as costco though. It had like a raw texture to it, but it looked cooked. It was good because I love rotisserie chicken but for $15, I could've bought 3 big whole chicken from costco. Nothing special about this dish at all. My awesome mashed potatoes could beat cheesecake factory's any day. His: Factory burger (around $10) - It was served in a baguette which I found pretty weird. But my boyfriend said it was good, but for me, it was average.  Cheesecakes: both around $8 Mine: My all time fav, Red velvet cheesecake! AHHH!!! 1million calories of deliciousness. If I was to die tomorrow, I am demanding to eat a whole cake of this thing. Never fails to disappoint me.  His: fresh banana cream cheesecake. It had bavarian cream on top and the cheesecake filling tasted like bananas w/ fresh cut up bananas. It was yummy! and now the bf's favorite.  Now, the reason why I only gave this 3 stars wasnt just because of the average food. It was also our server. Wasnt friendly at all and had a little snooty attitude. No extra tip for that guy!  I would come back for the cheesecakes they have because those are truly awesome. I'll try more dishes too, I suppose."
Xuehua L.,"San Diego, CA",8,61,168,5.0,3/22/2015,We came Cheesecake Factory for dinner to celebrate Kathryn's Birthday. The restaurant waiters sang happy birthday to us. Everything was so awesome I absolutely love this place.
Nick B.,"San Diego, CA",471,422,327,3.0,1/19/2014,"This Factory is just like all the others, massive menu and always crowded. Now I'm not saying that is a bad thing but it leaves little to discuss when trying to say something that you haven't read before. The best part about Cheesecake Factory is you never need to decide as a group or even a couple what you want to eat, their menu will satisfy all.  The food and service is never bad, but it is never deserving of a fantastic rating or high praise. So is that a good thing? yeah actually, every chef will tell you that consistency is everything when running a restaurant and at least The Factory has it. I will recommend coming here if you're in the area and are having a difficult time deciding between Thai food or a hot dog."
Cynthia S.,"San Diego, CA",35,99,67,4.0,2/1/2014,"I've only been here two times for my birthday.  The first time I came here was in 2013 and it was amazing! My boyfriend and I had a lovely waitress and the food was delicious. I amount of food that they give us is worth the money. The plate is HUGE and perfect. The bread starts to fill me up though. Anyways, we sat outside and it was peaceful. It was lovely too! I ended up leaving so satisfied.  The second time I came here for my birthday was in 2014.. Okay, everything was good. My boyfriend and I only waited for about five minutes. We had to sit inside which kind of suck to be honest. It was so loud and it was hard to have a conversation with my boyfriend without yelling. Okay, so we had this waiter and he was too much! He talks way too loud and it's just hard to explain. I just know when a waiter/waitress is being over the top and is too much. Anyways, aside from all of that.. The food is still amazing and enjoyable! I suggest you try the fries, haha. It's surprisingly good!  If you just want to have a lovely conversation with your boo or whoever you're with, I suggest you sit outside. It's peaceful and quiet. The food is amazing here too! Just hopefully you don't get an immature waiter or waitress."
Brad L.,"El Cajon, CA",19,90,38,5.0,1/30/2015,We had great drinks . food was great shepards pie was great cheese cake was good but our waiter Steve was awesome  Thanks
James L.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,13,,4.0,2/24/2016,"Simply amazing service and kind staff. We came in during the dinner rush and was seated immediately even though there was a lot people waiting. Our server, Robert, was kind and attentive to our needs. He made us a dessert item that was no long on the menu.  We had to start the everything pizza, which was amazing and had literally everything you could want on a pizza but better as well as the buffalo wings that were by far one of the best wings I have had in a long time. For the main course, I had the factory combination with Diane Steak with Chicken Madeira. The steak was cooked to perfection as well as the chicken which just melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes in came with were seasoned just right. Overall, I had a pleasant experience celebrating a birthday here and would definitely come back again."
K L.,"Honolulu, HI",53,9,29,1.0,2/10/2017,"i wish i can put no star. i ordered chicken pineapple avocado salad and there were no tomato no avocado no almond and yes 1 single piece of edamame .so called manager Mr.yuehileo here and he agreed said its totally wrong salad and  he said the salad station is new so they did wrong job? anyways this manager was talking back to me that inside of salad there is tomato seeds ..? so i had to argue with him there is no tomato and also no tomato seeds. it was very ridiculous, first of all my order was came wrong and this manager seems new and he didnt even know anything about menus and everything was wrong. anyways i don't want to waste my time here and there... i already ruined my date dinner. i left 15%of tip which i don't have to but my server was kind. and other than that all the server seems like ignoring you when u wave your hands and call them they look other side.... wt..... what is wrong with this place? completely very very disappointed here...plz don't come here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i beg you"
Charles H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,11,1,4.0,3/22/2016,"Had a great time here with my girlfriend.  We sat at the bar and had Mike as our bartender.  He was extremely attentive, in a good way, and made me a drink that wasn't on the menu that was fantastic.  Food was good as always. If your lucky to get Mike as your bartender, ask him about his travels around the world, overall a great experience."
Arslan V.,"San Diego, CA",203,157,22,5.0,3/29/2015,Great desserts and good food! I haven't try their food but I tried dessert and good juice! The team is awesome! Very fun and easy choices.  It's the first ever been in this place and I liked it!
Tammy N.,"San Diego, CA",434,314,550,2.0,10/24/2013,"I've been here several times.  In the past my experieneces have been a bit better but my more recent trips here leave me a bit disappointed. The inside of Cheesecake factory is beautiful.  Menu always has many options and price is decent for such a pretty restaurant, but the food quality is what is going south for me. I also remember their cheesecake slices for $10 a pop being more generous in size but now frankly it just isn't worth it to go here.  My friend ordered the Tex Mex eggrolls and we were surprised to hear that they ""ran"" out of it. I guess this must mean it comes from a pacakge then instead of being made at the restaurant?  Ive been here around 5-6 times and besides the calamari here there isn't really anything else that I like.  I like the large variety of Cheesecake here but for the smaller slices at the high price I don't think Ill be coming back too much."
Amber H.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,4,1.0,9/3/2015,"Worst call in customer service ever at this location. I've called on three different occasions, and always have the same issue. No one EVER answers once transferred. When I call back and tell them no one is answering they always say the same thing, it will be just a sec. I wanted to order a birthday cheese cake for a friend but couldn't get an order in.. there call in is seriously a joke here. Never again."
Michellee R.,"San Marcos, CA",144,92,44,3.0,8/15/2013,"Went in on a Wednesday night at 6:30 pm and didn't get my party of 6 seated until about 7:45. The wait is SO unbearable, especially when we were sitting on the bench right across from the cheesecake display. Torture, I tell ya!  Service is exceptional! Our waiter was really kind and didn't mind when we asked for their complimentary whole wheat bread 5 times! Haha! It's too darn good! When I go here, I usually get Bang Bang Shrimp or any of the pastas. Menu is expansive and can feed any tastes. Kids loved their Mac and Cheese. My Garlic Noodles with Shrimp was slightly salty, but I still ate it. HELLO! Starving people in other countries!  Their cheesecakes more than make up for the wait time and salty pasta!! We tried White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Red Velvet, Dulce de Leche, and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Caramel. All of them were off the hook! My fave and the one I crave for is the Dulce de Leche. Has the perfect crunch, softness and sweetness!"
Conrad R.,"San Diego, CA",1354,726,15265,4.0,11/8/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant juggernaut that has secured a foothold in almost every major US city with people who are still willing to wait for an hour just to get a table. I've been to a handful of various locations on both coasts, and for all the yelp downplay or venomous reviews, CF continues to flourish.  We had dinner with some friends and of course there is a wait because the restaurant needed to accommodate our birthday party of 12, which is plenty of time to peruse the bakery counter, drool over the selections, and gasp over the amount of aerobic exercise needed to burn off the calories per bite in a single slice.  When we got seated, our server went over the specials and took our drink & appetizer orders. I was feeling nostalgic, so I went with the Well Mannered Dirty Martini, which was fine except the bartender failed to strain out a couple of ice chips. Not a perfect martini tonight, but it was still classy and dirty, just how I like it  .  I usually go with a saucy Chicken Madeira and/or Steak Diane [medium rare], but tonight I was feeling spicy, so I decided on the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Spicy is what I got in a heaping bowl of savory deliciousness. I wish they'd serve half-size portions because it's waay too much food  .  For people like myself who were brought up to clean off their plate, mega-portions really creates a dilemma in saving room for dessert. Next time, I'll try an appetizer or small plate, with a side salad, so I can enjoy some sweets. Their specialties are quite good, though.  For the record, I didn't get any cheesecake tonight, and the server boxed up my leftovers. But guess what? Delicious lunch today ;-P"
Bianca R.,"San Diego, CA",79,22,9,5.0,1/20/2015,Came here to celebrate my moms birthday and everything was great! We only waited for 5 minutes before we were seated. Our server was Christian and he was extremely friendly and funny. He made sure to sing Happy Birthday to my mom before we left which my mom enjoyed. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken and it was delicious. The portion was pretty big so I had enough to take home for next day's lunch. We ended the night with the chocolate mousse cake which sent me straight up to heaven!!!! :-) Must go to this place!
Joanie R.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,5.0,2/10/2016,"I've always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory, but it's a calorie splurge which I don't need. Last Saturday I went with a group of three lady friends for a late lunch/early dinner.  I have never written a review, but this time I had to because of the EXCELLENT service we received from our server Nicole Clark.   We all agreed that she did the most outstanding job of checking on us, refilling drink glasses, taking pictures at our request, and being super friendly, with the most awesome attitude ever!"
Christa L.,"San Diego, CA",14,3,,2.0,2/22/2016,Today was a very stressful day for my boyfriend and I wanted to do something nice for him. He wanted to go to cheesecake factory because he loves the wings there. We got there and the hottest was really nice. Got us a table and our waiter wasn't in the right mood. It took him around 20mins to get us our drinks and even longer for our food. The wings were bloody and burned. It's the first time I've been at a Cheesecake Factory and hated everything about it. Very disappointed
Mel D.,"San Diego, CA",3,193,20,4.0,9/9/2014,"Gluttony at its finest.  OMG.  I know the recipes & servings are very ""cookie cutter"" for this chain restaurant, but really - this is as safe as it gets when you have to go to a chain type of place.   The food is always good and I noticed that they finally changed the menu up a little bit.  Granted getting through the menu is still like reading the bible, but there are plenty of options to keep everyone happy.   And there are also about 10 trillion cheese cake options...and they are so good.  So, so good.  I recently tried the S'mores Special Edition slice & it was FANTASTIC!  Push the plain graham crackers to the side, they look cute, but are useless for taste.  The toasted marshmallow cream though is such a goods touch!!"
Josh J.,"San Diego, CA",68,171,2,4.0,1/11/2016,"Service was good and I know they really try and make sure its is up to standard. I think the cheesecake chain is usually pretty good and generous with their potions and has a nice dining atmosphere.  Overall, really good but the check can add up quickly!  I will be back! Thanks for the service"
