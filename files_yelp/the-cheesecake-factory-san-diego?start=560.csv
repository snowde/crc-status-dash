Angie P.,"San Diego, CA",12,29,29,5.0,1/30/2015,"Five stars service Amazing only a 15 min wait not bad for a Friday night ,great food drinks are Awesome!! And cheesecake is the  !"
Romy K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",43,64,56,3.0,12/14/2014,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. You can go wrong when you have a hungry and tired baby, and it seems like everyone decided to come to cheesecake at the same time! Was told wait time will be approximately 20-25 minutes, but ended up being almost an hour. I know it's not their fault they were slammed, but be a little more accurate with your wait times. Had we known it'll be an hour wait, we wouldn't have stayed. Luckily food came out quick and service was good."
Travis C.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,38,14,4.0,1/30/2016,I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times and I've never had a bad meal!  This time I tried the Parmesan Herb crusted chicken which was very good.  They give you so much food!  My friend had the garlic noodles and those were good as well but mine was better. I had a peach liquor drink which was fantastic.  There was quite a wait when we got there so we sat at the bar to eat. Don't know if I'll do that again. Service was a little slow and I wouldn't say our bartender/waitress was on the ball.  I was going to order a second drink but by the time she finally came to ask if we wanted another I decided against it.  We also ordered cheesecake to go and had to wait a while to get it as she had forgotten about it.  Cheesecake was excellent! Would have given it five stars if service would have been better.
Karen M.,"San Diego, CA",30,11,4,4.0,1/29/2016,The food is delicious! They have a nice variety of items [I'm not just talking about desserts] on the menu! I personally liked their Red Velvet cake.
Kat M.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",20,12,,1.0,11/5/2014,"I have worked in restaurants for a long time. I've seen a lot, heard a lot, and I personally dine a lot.  Disclaimer: Consider yourself warned of The Cheesecake Factory Fashion Valley, the Chicken Madeira, and weird C grade service. You just never know what kind of problem solving abilities you will encounter. Here is my experience:  1. I approached the host stand. She did not make eye contact or greet me for over a minute. Prior to doing so she spoke with a co-worker who interrupted her consistent gaze at the computer screen. After her coworker spoke to her, she said hello to me. I smiled, ""Hello, two please."" She was polite. Just amazing that this generation does not prioritize greetings; we love looking into computer screens! Whatever no foul, just weird. 2. Sat down, greeted three minutes later, ordered 2 waters, a glass of wine, & a side salad. I asked for a glass of Pinot Noir, he recommended a wine. I look up the wine, I asked him the name he said, he repeated it, I couldn't find the name he said. I asked if it was there; he said ""I don't know it just came to mind."" Okkkk, ummmm? I order a glass that was actually on the menu. Weird.  3. 1 water served. I reminded him I wanted 2. He said he would bring it out when the other person in my party arrived, he said he didn't want the ice to melt. Ok- weird.  4. Waiter returns, I order, Chicken Madeira. It is my favorite & one of their most popular items. My boyfriend asked, ""Can I order from here?"" as he held up the small bites menu. Waiter's response, ""If you want,"" in a condescending tone. Odd? I can't assume to know his intentions. Food came quickly. Several bites in the waiter checks on us. 5. Next bite, the chicken is undercooked. Blood is present. I use the flashlight on my phone to verify. Yes in fact it was bloody, pink, chewy chicken! Undercooked.  I rationalize why the chicken could be undercooked; my hypothesis: The chicken is pounded to a thin piece for preparing; I'm sure it is a fine balance to not over cook the chicken, and in doing so it was undercooked. Understandable.  6. Waiter checks on us. I show him the bloody chicken, he takes it away. He's quick & hesitant to look at the meat in front of me, & a bit dismissive, probably trying to correct/minimize the complaint. He informed me a manager would come over.  7. Manager, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry, I'll fix that right away."" Im fine with that, yet surprised. Undercooked chicken is NOT GOOD. 8. Manager brings a new Chicken Maderia within 4 minutes. I thought, wow/fast. He disclosed that he pulled one off the line so I wouldn't have to wait. My thought: someone's food is now jammed up. I appreciated the prompt response.  9. I examine the plate, it was my first plate, re-plated; sloppy on the edges and re-dressed. They just put a new piece of chicken on it & I could see where I took a fork full of potatoes off of it from round 1. I'm hopeful the chicken was new & cooked. Cross contamination is now an issue. 10. I ate a couple bites, seems fine. Waiter checks on us. I'm good. I say thank you. Error sorta fixed, no big deal. 11. Few more bites. UNDERCOOKED again. My boyfriend also has a bite. Pink, chewy meat.  I cut open the meat, use the flashlight to verify; pink rubbery meat! Ok this is a foul! I have a food handlers card & I know everyone in that building has one too! That fine balance chicken preparation technique should have been corrected. 12. I cut into the other piece of chicken, it's already cut, the kitchen or manager checked to ensure it was not undercooked. My educated guess: It's probably a piece of chicken from my first plate. Maybe they thought, ""why waste the other piece of chicken?"" We'll cross cross contamination would be a really good reason to dump that first plate! Lazy, risky. NOT GOOD.  13. A new manager approaches, ""What happened?"" he asked. ""What are we doing for you?"" he asked. Did he really just ask me to solve his problem?! I respond, ""I don't know what happened, but I know that was not a new plate, & bottom line the chicken was bloody, & undercooked on 2 attempts. I don't trust that you even brought a new plate."" I should have asked him what he was going to do. I'm not hungry now, having consumed a portion of undercooked chicken that I will be glad to never eat again. Visions of food poisoning symptoms flashed through my mind. He informs me he is going to find out what happened. I never find out. He does not return. 14. Waiter offers a complimentary dessert. The cheesecake won't be bloody, right? Check is dropped, meal is comped, but my boyfriend's is not, $14.00 is the total. The waiter gets a 15% tip. He didn't make the food, but C grade service was provided. Conclusion: RAW/UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN x2. My experience was unacceptable & weird! Thanks for not requiring payment for the undercooked chicken meals. A comped side salad, a glass of wine, and slice of cheesecake sure helped with today's malaise! NOT."
Yvette L.,"San Diego, CA",52,97,41,3.0,4/7/2013,"In all honesty, I find this place pretty comparable to Olive Garden. Don't get me wrong, I love it here and there but I think it's overpriced here. The wait is ALWAYS long and your waiter/ress will be a hit or miss. I find myself only coming here on a good payday or a special occasion/anniversary. This place will always be a classic though!"
Zoey O.,"San Diego, CA",508,391,292,3.0,10/16/2014,"When I came here at the beginning of the month I was absolutely appalled at the service I received. I sat at the bar with a friend and was served by Lea D (or something like that). She seemed annoyed with anyone that spoke to her- whether a customer or another employee. After being seated for 5 minutes, ready to put in both our drink and food order, she approached the couple that was just walking up to the chairs next to us. She took their drink order. When I asked if we can put our drink order in, she said we could tell her when we were ready. I really didn't like her vibe, and I wasn't sure about coming back to this location, or at least the bar.  But, I can't resist the food. So, I came back the next weekend with the same girlfriend. We sat the same seats at the bar and was served by Elizabeth. She was excellent and truly knew how to treat her customers. She was busy as heck, but knew what proper customer service entailed. And for that, she got a $10 tip on a $17 meal. Thank you for making this experience better for me!"
Michael B.,"San Diego, CA",0,40,,2.0,10/5/2015,"You can do better.  If you're so inclined to wait at least an hour for subpar food then by all means, please indulge."
Michael B.,"San Diego, CA",7,30,70,4.0,8/6/2014,"The array of food and cheesecake is amazing. I've tried the majority of their cheesecakes and quite a few entrees on their menu and they're all delicious. The reason why I only gave 4 stars is due to the lack of consistency with their food and service. This location always seems to be busy but at times it's busy beyond belief. On those days, the quality of the food and service is definitely effected. There's been a couple of times where I've received my food and the order was wrong and/or the food was cold, and I mean it wasn't even warm. I guess it's ok since they make up for it with the amazing cheesecake that I MUST get after every meal. For entrees I suggest getting the Chicken Madeira or the Smokehouse BBQ Cheeseburger; amazing. The fried mac n cheese balls are a must for an appetizer and I'm personally partial to the pineapple upside down cheesecake; CRACK."
Wana L.,"San Diego, CA",680,393,592,4.0,4/29/2011,"Okay, it had been a long long while since the last time I ate here. But, I ended up dining here for a friend's bday dinner. Yes, the wait was pretty long and there were tons of people inside waiting around for their buzzers to go off. BUTTTT  (here comes my big butt)... I was pleasantly surprised! First off, their complimentary WHEAT bread is amazingly soft and good. I think I must have made our server refill our basket several times.  I think I had the Jumbalya Pasta or something like that and it was good too! The portion was plenty enough for me to split it with a friend. There were some other dishes that I got to try off of my friends' plates... but all in all, I liked their food.  To top it off... their RED VELVET Cheesecake is just completely memorable!!! So memorable that I'm going to surprise my bf with it for his birthday. (it's in MAY) He's never tried it and I am pretty darn sure he's going to love it. That's a definite MUST TRY!!! Their Godiva Cheesecake was super rich... but I like rich...so I loved it too! Both are great to share. Wouldn't recommend trying to eat the Godiva alone."
Alyssa A.,"Monterey, CA",0,20,7,3.0,8/22/2015,"When it comes to the cheesecake factory I go for cheesecake, drinks, and service. This cheesecake factory has let me down on service multiple times. Last night I went with my family and the server was very pushy and just wanted us to come in eat and leave. Granted, I was a server and I did the same thing, however I wasn't rude about it. For me, I don't see myself dining in here again. I'll go to one of the other 3 locations near me."
Alastra A.,"San Diego, CA",153,158,40,3.0,10/29/2014,3 stars because I usually almost have a great visit here but I came here a few days ago on a Sunday afternoon and was just shocked at Everything. Service and food combined. Hostess seated us right away but this comes down to the waitress. Her shirt was extremely dirty which was a turn off. Her phone was in her back pocket how does the management not see this? It took her a while to greet us and bring waters. Bread didn't taste fresh. Food was ok this time maybe it was a busy Sunday afternoon I'll let it slide. Again this is me complaining about the service mostly hopefully cheesecake can train the staff to be a bit more professional. I'll return to this location to give this benefit of the doubt but I would rather go to the Otay location.
Susan Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/13/2017,"We went here for my birthday dinner before we headed down to downtown. It was a packed night considering it was Friday night at Cheesecake factory. We got to sit in the back and our waiter Grant S. was great. He was super attentive and super friendly. He is the main reason why I am yelping this place. He found out it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday and after we ate dinner he asked if we wanted dessert. Everyone was super full and said no on the dessert since we had to go to downtown soon. He took it upon himself to bring me a sundae with a candle and sang happy birthday to me without being prompted by any of my friends. I thought this was great customer service. He went above and beyond, especially since the last time my friends and I went to a birthday dinner in January at a fancy place in Gaslamp we had horrible service, this was a great surprise and breath of fresh air. Thank you Grant for helping me start the night on a positive note!"
Rufus C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,14,,1.0,5/14/2016,I purchased a whole cheesecake for take out 5/13/16 and the counterperson refused to give me more than one of those plastic individual slice containers.  I would estimate they cost about $.02 each or less.  For the well overpriced cost of the whole cheesecakes there they should toss in a Maserati and a full tank of gas too.  But no they can't even toss in 10 cents worth of plastic.  I was afraid to ask for napkins and plastic forks as I thought I might be denied those as well.  The Otay location never had a problem giving me those containers.  I will never return to the Cheapskate Factory on Friars Rd.
Andy S.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,3,4.0,2/11/2016,There take out services are usually on point when it comes to giving the estimated time to pick up your food. They have so many to choose from that I didn't know what I wanted!!! The prices there were pretty much up there but it was worth paying for.
M M.,"San Diego, CA",5,56,514,4.0,11/5/2013,"I've been here for lunch and dinner.  If you like menus with lots of options and love big portions, then this a great place for you.  I just get over whelmed with extreme selections and huge portions....but that's me. I do have to tell you one thing---it is a beautiful place, inside and out. Once we went to TCF just for dessert and sat at the bar.  Another time we went just for appetizers and a cheesecake and we sat outside.  It was a beautiful night and being near the heater we never felt cold!  It's a great outdoor seating for late at night and it felt private.  It wasn't crowded and the noise level was not as loud as inside.  We had the lettuce wrap and it was flavorful and the perfect size for a late snack.  We still had room for a little cheesecake (YAY)! I found my niche with TCF with their appetizers :)  I now look forward to trying out the other appetizers and of course (now with more tummy-room), the cheesecakes. Service was great.  Our waitress was friendly and informative about the different cheesecake selections."
D L.,"San Diego, CA",0,36,,5.0,8/12/2016,"This is my go to spot to meet my friends at. The food is always very good. Yesterday I took my daughter and our server was Susie whom I have had before. She once again was an outstanding server. Keep it up Cheesecake Factory, with your great service from server's like Susie to your great Chefs who consistently put out the great tasting food. I will keep coming back!!"
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,4.0,7/18/2014,"Dropped by this cheesecake factory a couple of weekends ago after driving in from Vegas and sure enough it never fails, they always provide the best service and CHEESECAKE! I actually have never really been a fan of the actual dinner dishes from here more so for the appetizers and drinks followed by the cheesecake! Being that I normally only like to eat here during happy hours. Avocado Spring Rolls are amazing! The entree's we ordered that night 1 out of two were good. My significant other ordered the FETTUCCINI W/ CHICKEN AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES and it was a bust! We had to send that back and end up not evening replacing the order because the kitchen was closed. My Chicken Madeira was surprisingly good! Finished off the dinner with a big slice of my favorite.. Red Velvet Cheesecake :-)"
Marcus P.,"Imperial Beach, CA",40,18,2,2.0,11/19/2014,"We went here yesterday after a long day of shopping at fashion, we were starving.. We order 2 different types of pasta and a Mai tai.. As well as cheesecake. The GOOD: The outside area where we ate was great and had fire heaters the wait on our food was not long at all. The cheesecake was AMAZING!! Best I have had in a while the whole family loved it.  As far as the food.. Well it looked good... The BAD: There was an awful smell like they used old mop water to clean the floors, this was very unappealing right when your stepping in. The mugs they used need to be thrown away and buy new ones, also my wife's mug was dirty. The pasta had NO FLAVOR, is was bland, and all you could taste was oil. I was extremely upset about that. So I tried my wife's pasta...... Same it was just bad even with putting salt n pepper. I'm saying this again I'm extremely upset with the food here. My wife said her Mai tai was nasty, but I didn't try it. Overall: Just go for the cheesecake you won't be let down by that experience."
