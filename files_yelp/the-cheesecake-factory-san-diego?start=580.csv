Don T.,"San Diego, CA",127,18,2,5.0,1/15/2016,"I'm simply giving 5 stars because my waiter Thomas was probably the best customer service I've had ever. Super kind man, showed alot of love for his job and gave great service. He apologized for not having a certain cake when I asked but he gave me a ton of options and overall very help."
Christopher P.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,250,122,2.0,9/12/2012,"If I could, I'd slap a baby kitten every time someone suggests eating here.  And yet, I reluctantly come, even knowing there'll be a 45 minute wait for some mediocre overpriced food.  Damn.   + some of the cheesecakes are decent.  overpriced?  as far as they can push it, but pretty tasty. - no reservations.  you get a buzzing remote and stand outside, since the waiting area doesn't nearly accommodate everyone.   - the service here always sucks, and for a $$ restaurant, you shouldn't have to work this much.  getting refills is a ridiculous chore. - you can kind of tell that the people here don't love their jobs, a pretty bad sign in my book.   - the food simply isn't great; I find an occasional decent plate among a sea of mediocre to bad, the prices adding to the insult.  stay away from the sashimi. I can't see why this place continues to be popular; if you must, get a slice of cheesecake to go.  The corporation doesn't give a crap about people (customer or employee), and it shows."
Marissa B.,"Santee, CA",0,2,1,5.0,11/1/2016,"we had a great time at cheesecake factory 10/30/2016. there were two hosts, both girls, who accomadated us very nicely by sitting us at a booth. our server Maggie was very polite and attentive to our needs. thank you again!"
Irene V.,"El Cajon, CA",54,6,37,4.0,11/26/2014,"This place has so much to pick from ..tasty yummy food and beer aaand delicious cheesecakes. Clean place, the service was also good.. Will definitely be coming back."
Heather L.,"Beckenham, London, United Kingdom",211,1018,262,4.0,10/17/2012,"This review is just for the cheesecake.  While I have been here for dinners... and waited what seemed like a lifetime to be seated, cheesecake is the only reason I stop here now.  What I love is seeing all of the cheesecakes in the display case, what I hate is having to choose one.  I have contemplated ordering more than once piece to try the other flavours, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  1) I don't want to be the size of a house and 2) at almost $10 a slice I don't really want to spend a lot on just one slice... might as well buy the whole thing!   I've had the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake... good, but not my favourite.  I have tried the Mango Key Lime and while again it was good, not my favourite... not a fan of Mango (gasp...).  And even though I made a version of the Red Velvet Cheesecake for Christmas (OMG the one that I made was amazing...), again it is good, but not my favourite.  So what is my favourite?!  The Dulce de Leche.  It is a beautiful and simple cheesecake that is so rich it can make you sick.  The good kind of sick.  I think Dulce de Leche is a perfect combination with cheesecake because it is creamy and the tang of the cheesecake helps cut a bit of the richness of the Dulce de Leche.  Not a lot of frills and extras to take away from the cheesecake itself, just a simple slice of heaven!"
Anita A.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,37,1,1.0,8/8/2014,"The to-go and curbside service for this place is terrible!!! Was on HOLD for a total of 25 minutes- enough time to leave the pool, grab my purse and drive from the hotel to the restaurant. Service person did not apologize for the lack of phone service and the lady in front of me had her phone as well-  a 15 minute hold with no pick up as well. Don't do curbside if you make the customer go inside to order, then wait another 20 minutes and then back to the car! Horrible- and my hubby and I love to do celebration meals at the Cheesecake! Will NOT be back to this one!!!! :("
Sam A.,"San Diego, CA",86,175,336,4.0,7/28/2014,"I dont really eat a lot of chain restaurant and love to try places that offer unique and exotic flavors. Although when some event happens (bday, celebations, friends gatherings) The Cheesecake Factory comes into play. I have tried this place many times in the past and each time is always good. I love their Lettuce Thai Wraps that they have for appetizers, alone it can serve as a lite meal as well.  Entrees it all depends on what you are in the mood for: sandwich, pastas, fish, beef, pork or chicken. Which ever is that you order i am sure its good.  They have ""Cold Apple Cider"" dont be fooled, its just ""Apple Juice"" and it comes in a short glass (no free refill) not worth it. Stick to water or Iced Green tea.  Cheesecakes: i have only ever tried Banana Cream Pie. Why? well IDK just when you are reading over and over all the different ingredients that are into one cheesecake my brain goes crazy and i start to see it as too sweet. Banana Cream pie offers a mix of both sweet and just the right of bland. A Favorite among cheesecakes and pies!"
Stuart G.,"La Mesa, CA",11,23,1,3.0,8/10/2014,"We've been here about 5 times now, give or take, and our experiences here have ranged from ""wonderful"" to ""why did pay this much for terrible service"" with it averaging in between the two.  This most recent visit would qualify for a one or two star easily, but three seems to be the average. The service is usually decent here with the servers being semi attentive, varying heavily on your server. I feel it would benefit to have a more attentive wait staff as a whole though as the wait staff of a restaurant can make or break your experience, as it has far too often here.   The food is almost always very good though to make up for the mediocre wait staff thankfully. Very little of the food doesn't taste good and the quality of the food is very consistent, showing a well trained kitchen. If I was able to tip directly to the kitchen I would every visit.  Overall, due to the wait staff, the experience isn't as good as you would think it should be. I do hope that changes as the food is quite good and there's something here for everyone on their menu."
Tetiana T.,"Midwood, NY",95,18,8,4.0,5/10/2014,"I can't leave 5 stars for one reason  Me and my friend were at the table and it was cold and windy , we ask them to move us somewhere inside , but they said we can't bla bla bla , it made me being cold :(  But I food was excellent , love it ,  It's kind of busy at all the time  No matter when you go , it will be busy"
Neachelle N.,"San Diego, CA",68,193,47,1.0,9/24/2014,"Frankly I wont be rushing back maybe I just had a poor waitress... the bread was hard as a rock and we sent it back twice,  my chicken sandwhich was subpar which i told the waitress it was all soggy she didnt even reply just walked off i asked for no whipped cream on my cheesecake I loathe whipped cream she gave me extra she took my drink out of hand while the straw was dangling on my lip i went with a friend for a girls lunch and she didnt even split the checks properly it was an over priced waste of my afternoon.... I wont be back a long wait in a very crowded resteraunt"
Pam W.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,19,4,3.0,11/15/2014,"Everyone should try Cheese Cake Factory at least once.  The menu is long and very impressive.  If you love chicken this is the place for you.  Literal pages of chicken.  I asked the waiter for a recommendation, he told me about the madeira wine sauce chicken. It sounded great.  Unfortunately it was not great.  Chicken was overdone....  Sauce was just ok.  Our food did not come out at the same time.  Dessert was excellent.   I don't this the place is for me."
Linda C.,"San Diego, CA",58,133,8,1.0,5/22/2014,I sometime frequent this location after work for drinks and a quick dinner. I've never had problems with wait time even though many people including tourists eat here. The food is of chain quality and I've never had issues with the wait staff.  My review is about the lack of service by the hostess at 6pm on 5/21. My coworker was already seated so I asked the gal where my friend was sitting. The hostess was lazy and instructed me to go about finding the table myself. You are the hostess who seats customers and it's YOUR JOB. I asked you where my table was. I didn't ask you to solve world peace.
Jackey N.,"San Diego, CA",174,131,172,1.0,9/26/2014,"Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner w/ a friend. We were tired and hungry from work. I had ordered a tomato basil flatbread and my friend ordered some type of pasta. We also ordered strawberry lemonades. We saved ordering cheesecake for last. It kinda sucked because they burned my flatbread and had to make another one. I'm guessing it was the owner that came and told me. Later our waitress delivered our drinks. I took a sip and thought it was overly sweet.  A couple minutes later, the owner delivered our food. My friend said her looked great. I thought mine looked a little too white of a flatbread. I took a bite, no flavor, we asked for pepper and cheese, mine...still no flavor. Really bland. My friend took a bite and she thought she tasted bleach...So the waitress came by again and asked about our food. We mentioned it. She asked if I wanted something else, but I was too tired and hungry to look at the menu again. I already knew what I wanted for my cheesecake, so I ordered that instead. The owner came by and talked to me, asked the same question, but I still said no. Ordered my dulce de Leche cheesecake. That was good!  But came home and I got sick! Felt a thrust come up from my stomach to my throat to my mouth and threw up! Don't know if it was the flatbread, the cheesecake or both! Ugh!"
Reina S.,"Artesia, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/1/2015,"Wouldn't go back to this location. I love The Cheesecake Factory in general, but my family had an unpleasant experience from eating outdoor at this branch . Our server was not so friendly when we brought it to his attention. We transferred inside, the new server acted like nothing happened. My husband brought it to the manager's attention after we ate- regarding pest control/exterminator issue.  Not cool."
Art S.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/16/2016,My wife and I went on a date here and the service was really good. We chose to sit outside since it was kinda loud inside. The weather changed and it started to drizzle but the staff worked extra hard to make sure we had umbrellas and the patio heaters. Great food! Great staff!
Maribel G.,"Selma, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/15/2016,No flavor! Someone has not heard of seasoning. My pasta was hard and shrimp was dry. I will definitely not be coming back.
Paul D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",54,233,128,5.0,7/24/2014,We enjoy this Cheese Cake Factory. The food is delicious. The kids love this place. We enjoyed sitting outside in the warm weather. The outdoor seating was beautiful similar to Hawaii. We look forward in going back.
John  F.,"Oceanside, CA",13,38,1,4.0,7/11/2015,"First time at this location, great meal delightful service, and oh that Cheesecake! Great stuff, no more sweets for today! Nice job all!"
Trang V.,"Claremont, CA",209,137,70,2.0,7/23/2014,"I came here before prom and just thought about writing a review for it now because I was talking about this location with a friend.  The dish I ordered was really bad... I think it was the cashew chicken. Note: never go to an American restaurant and order Asian food. I had my date eat misty of the dish because I didn't like it. I know, I could be more specific but I don't remember exactly how it tasted, just that the dish wasn't worth the price.  I've also had cheesecake from this place. I thought it was alright, nothing great for something named the cheesecake factory and for the price.  I personally wouldn't recommend coming here for a special occasion. Actually, don't come here at all. Just get a cheesecake from Vons or something."
Salena T.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",55,2,,3.0,11/12/2014,"Came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary the other day.  Our waiter was super chill and patient as I took some time to pick my entree. He was awesome.    The food came out really quick.  &It was alright.  I wasn't super impressed with it.  Maybe it was the dish I chose?   I don't know...  Maybe the food was way over-priced and I just expected more??   I did enjoy the Cheesecake though (:  Probably won't come back for the food but the cheesecake, I will."
