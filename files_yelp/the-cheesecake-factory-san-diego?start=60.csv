Lou B.,"Pacifica, CA",8,7,1,1.0,9/6/2017,"These dumbasses left us standing in the lobby for 20 minutes while others were seated. They kept staring at us being too clueless to understand why we were still standing there. Screw you, we will not ever come back."
Bianca S.,"San Diego, CA",85,66,2141,5.0,4/19/2017,You can never go wrong with eating at the Cheesecake Factory. They seriously offer everything for everyone's dietary needs. The only downside is the wait times for a table can be very long.
Kailynn P.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/21/2017,"I have had a super bad experience with Cheesecake Factory. There is nothing wrong with the food, but EVERYTHING is wrong with the service. I have gave this place a chance four time. Every single time my boyfriend and I have had a horrible time. First, it took them so so so long to give us bread. They didn't even take our order for drinks. They just gave us water. Second, once they FINALLY took our order for food it took forever to bring it out. Once we got our food, absolutely NO ONE checked on us to see how we are doing. We waited so long to grab someone's attention so we could get the check. The only person's attention we got was the busboy!! Never again. This is a repeating process."
Christy M.,"San Diego, CA",84,9,,1.0,11/19/2017,If I could give them a 0 I would. I was put on hold on the phone for 20 minutes with no answer and after we decided to just head over for dinner we found 2 hairs in our pasta. Couldn't have been more disappointed.
Greg T.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",98,42,41,5.0,12/14/2017,"Great food!!   The service, the best.  The staff made me feel welcome. I'd come back if I come back to San Diego!"
Charita A.,"Murrieta, CA",281,421,1206,2.0,3/1/2017,"This used to be my go-to Cheesecake factory due to its location being the closes to me. I'm so happy for the one at North County mall in Escondido now though because this one seems to be going down hill.  We walk in during the middle of the day on a Wednesday and still have to wait for a table. Its just two of us and we were willing to sit outside but it's fine. I'm used to waiting here. What I am not used to is how dirty it was inside.  The hostess sits us at a table that still has bread crumbs on it that  she clearly had to see when she placed the menu on top of them.  My knife had a piece of lent on it and then when we were given our forks and napkins for dessert there was a giant hair on the white napkin as clear as day. The waiter walks away and as he sees me reach for another fork from the many empty tables around us he asks if we want another fork. Uh, ya, and a napkin please.  I don't know if it's the lack of attention from the employees or the general management but I think I'm done with this location."
Thuong T.,"San Diego, CA",1536,1224,3075,4.0,8/15/2016,"CHEESECAKE!!!! Everyone knows that this is the best place to get a cheesecake, and they have a huge variety of flavors to choose from. Buy a slice for around $8 or get a whole cake for around $50 depending on choice. Prices vary. And it's also a great place to eat, their food menu is huuuuuuuuge! Seriously so much to look at and so many decisions to make. Although be aware that the wait time here can be long, sometimes up to an hour depending on party size. They also have indoor and outdoor seatings, and more than one location, but this one is central San Diego. Bistro Shrimp Pasta (Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce.) It was a huge portion, and everything tasted fresh. It was delicious. Fried Macaroni and Cheese (Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce.) A super delicious appetizer! Came with four fat pieces. Definitely nicely crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Recommend it! Overall, good food, good service, and amazing cheesecake!"
JoyceAnn S.,"Abilene, TX",5,61,142,5.0,6/13/2017,"Of course we all know they have extremely rich tasting, exquisite cheesecake!  Which would count for 5stars alone.  But I didn't know until recently that they served meals as well.   My husband had the pasta penne, and I had the sliders.  The chicken pasta was grilled tender, and the pasta cooked just right.  The sliders were delicious!  I don't know what kind of beef, or how they season it, but the meat was truly tasty!  Cooked to perfection, and just enough ketchup without overwhelming the taste of the meat. Would return just to eat more sliders . My compliments to the chefs/cooks. Our waitress was very busy and couldn't keep up with taking care of her customers.  As was the case for the other servers as well.  Recommend hiring more help for such a busy restaurant. She did her best and I appreciate that as well."
Joseph J.,"San Diego, CA",1220,25,7,1.0,8/4/2017,"I am very satisfied with this business. I was a recent happy customer of the cheesecake factory until just very recently. I use to take my girlfriend here all the time because she loves the cheesecake, we typically would have to wait for about an hour to get a table which was worth it to see her happy. The food was always good and service was great too until they started promoting their national cheesecake day. They told us that on National Cheesecake day all Cheesecake was half off. They didn't tell us that it was just one per person. I go their to get my girlfriend 5 slices and after waiting for over 30 minutes they told me it's only for one slice. I am very unhappy with this misleading promotion especially after the server told us we can get as many as we wanted.  For now on I will be sure to never spend my money at this establishment, I've never really written a one star review because I'd feel bad for the business. The cheesecake factory definitely deserved this one."
Chelsea S.,"Orange, CA",45,287,,4.0,2/6/2017,"This place is exactly what you would expect from The Cheesecake Factory: delicious food, good service, and a great environment. The wait time (at 2 in the afternoon, mind you) was a half an hour or so, which was a little annoying but completely to be expected since it's in Fashion Valley. The place was packed but for whatever reason there were a number of empty tables both inside and out- maybe they didn't have enough staff? Our waitress was very sweet and did a great job even though she was clearly hustling running back and forth between tables. I went with the gumbo because I'm physically incapable of resisting anything that has andouille sausage in it, and was blown away with the flavor. The meat was great quality, and the broth had a rich, spicy, buttery flavor that was just fantastic. Put together with the pile of rice it comes with, I was in complete gumbo heaven. Dessert was a Hershey's cheesecake, but being completely honest, the gumbo made me much happier. One of the nice things about this location is that it has such a large patio. It's less crowded and noisy than indoors, and on a warm Saturday afternoon it was the perfect place to enjoy a meal. The parking can be tricky since it's in Fashion, but if you actually find parking this is a great place to get your fix- because the menu is enormous so there's really nothing you could want that isn't on the menu."
Miyunn J.,"San Diego, CA",74,32,23,1.0,8/17/2017,"I'm giving the restaurant a one star because I ordered 2 cheesecakes last night, the same one I have been ordering for the last eight or nine months. However this time the cheesecake tasted terrible. It's as if they missed the sweener, or the vanilla extract.  I'm not sure, but it tastes bland as ever. And when I say bland, I mean the cheesecake portion of the actual cheesecake...the cream cheese, when I put it in my mouth it was as if it was tasteless. You want to tell me that I paid what, 10 bucks per slice, to taste nothing? What a joke.  What are you trying to do, water down the cream? That's so irresponsible. People pay good money for this! Why would you allow something so nasty leave  your kitchen? I let 3 people try it, I didn't say anything...guess what? They all spit it back up asking what the f*ck was that? So now I'm stuck asking you? Postmates will not refund the order, so basically you just swindled me out of my money....? Great! Awesome. You might have saved money by watering down the cheesecake  but you just lost one of your loyal customers in the process.  I'm officially over this restaurant. 3rd time this year. Once, I can deal with, but 3 times  insinuates a problem. I'm going to go back to ordering my $5 cheesecake from other places because there is no need to be paying premium prices for premium cheesecake, that taste below average. #SimplyUnacceptable"
Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",651,1121,4657,4.0,8/2/2016,"I came here to meet my BFF for dinner who is visiting from LA.  As soon as we entered, the waiter seated us right away near the bar area. I ordered a margarita and for my main course, salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Our waiter, I believe his name was TJ was super nice and took care of us. As we waited for our food, TJ gave us bread with butter. Our food came out in 15 minutes. Fairly quick for a busy restaurant. My margarita was good and strong. I had a glass of water to drink after drinking my margarita. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Mashed potatoes were flavorful and tasty. Broccoli needed more flavor but cooked well.  TJ was a great server and very attentive. He gets 5 stars for customer service. He made sure our drinks were refilled. He tried to get us to have dessert but we were stuffed cause servings were big.  I definitely would come back here on a weekday rather than on a weekend because it's busier during the weekends. Not too busy on a weekday but traffic getting here was bad."
Kayla G.,"Santee, CA",0,17,,3.0,12/9/2017,"Just O.K  Was sat right away which is great. Got our drinks and ordered. I ordered the Lunch size shepherds pie and a side salad.  The salad came out first and it was a complete joke. It was a HUGE serving of lettuce. 2 slices of tomato, 2 tiny slices of cucumber and  . Honestly regret not asking for my money back. I paid for a plate of lettuce. The Shepherds pie came out and it was ok. Probably wouldn't order it again. They use to have this sun dried tomato pasta that I'd order overtime I went but they took it off the menu :(  Overheard the customers next to me complaining about the pasta the the clumps of noodles. Overall, I probably won't be back for anything but the cheesecake. The food isn't disgusting, but for the same price, you can get something better elsewhere."
Denise M.,"San Diego, CA",2,9,,5.0,11/27/2017,"Awesome food, great service & yummy cheesecakes!! My husband and I always go here for our anniversary; this is also the place where he proposed, which makes it a lot more special. The spicy chipotle chicken penne pasta & steak Diane are amazingly delicious!! We have yet to try the rest of the menu!!"
Colleen M.,"Las Vegas, NV",90,61,42,1.0,12/26/2017,"This review is for the order I put in at 7PM to be delivered by DoorDash for 8:30PM. It is now 9:20PM and I still have not received my order. I have gotten messages about them running behind. This is absolutely ridiculous! I will never order from this restaurant or DoorDash again. These people have zero concept of time. Furthermore, I've been in the same place ""in line"", as DoorDash likes to put it, to complain about this HORRIBLE service!!! Hey DoorDash, change your name to DoorSlow! I ordered a turkey burger with a salad, an Arnold Palmer and 2 cheesecakes. It's not like it was a big order and it most certainly does not take that long to prepare or deliver! I would find somewhere else to not only order your food from but also for a different delivery service. While I was writing this, I received a message that they canceled my order just now. WOW!!! You guys suck!!! Do not order from these people! I got a hold of them over the phone and a representative told me the restaurant never received my order. So, DoorDash didn't even give the restaurant my order! WOW!"
CL R.,"Augusta, GA",0,5,2,5.0,8/3/2017,"I thoroughly enjoy this franchise! Customer service is always great. Though the wait time can be long, I guess that's to be expected of a place that's good at delivering good food, ambiance, food & above all awesome deserts"
M.F F.,"San Diego, CA",1,27,7,5.0,6/5/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is the best in San Diego especially  Fashion valley location, Miguel the chef manager was amazing, came to our table and made sure we where happy It's why we keep coming back, and also our server she was Amazing"
Helen N.,"San Diego, CA",2,34,40,3.0,11/18/2017,"Everything was great while we dined there until we got home and opened up our to-go order of the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with chicken....The portion was absolutely not worth $19.95! Furthermore, there was only a few pieces of chicken and shrimp...RIDICULOUS!"
Kelli F.,"La Mesa, CA",265,51,79,2.0,7/7/2017,"I usually only come here if I'm at Fashion Valley mall. The menu is extensive so I always tell myself that I'll be able to find something to enjoy. However, this is not the case. Every time I leave here I begin questioning myself as to why I continue to come here. The food is mediocre and usually either under seasoned or extremely salty. The dishes are also not consistent. When I finally find something that tastes ok, I order it the next time I am here and it never tastes the same.  As for the service it is usually a hit or miss. I don't think that I will find myself coming back here. I'd recommend going to True Kitchen across the way where the food is a lot more favorable and fresh."
Mel H.,"San Diego, CA",45,71,131,4.0,3/19/2017,"Had lunch here with a good friend today.  I gave them 4 stars because their BBQ chopped chicken salad is always good and for the most part service here had always been good.  Thus, I'm hoping that today was just an off day for how they served us.  Granted they were busy but still forgetting serving spoons when your salad is served then you have to ask and then be given one spoon is a little disappointing for this establishment . To top it off, when we asked for it, the waitress didn't look very happy.  Thank goodness the waitress at the end was friendlier. I may have to wait a little longer to return at this location."
