Viktor L.,"La Jolla, CA",10,44,98,5.0,5/30/2015,"Always fast and professional service. Love their barbecue chicken salad and baked potato soup. Kids meals are all very good, especially grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. Keep up a great job!"
Angela B.,"San Diego, CA",370,160,1412,4.0,3/13/2011,"I really enjoy everything I've eaten here. I love the chicken costeletta and the thai lettuce wraps. Their ranch dressing is really yummy and peppery. They have awesome alcoholic beverages too. Large portions, a bit pricey. 8/10/15 update... New favorite is the skinnylicious turkey burger! It's to die for and under 590 calories! You've gotta try it!"
Holly K.,"La Jolla, CA",26,41,94,1.0,4/23/2014,"So this is a chain restaurant.. But this particular location is not very good. I ordered the skinny chicken pasta, and it came out undercooked... The noodles were actually hard.  I really wanted to eat that particular dish, so I sent it back- but ordered the same thing. The next time it came out, the sauce was burnt from sitting on the stove for too long. And my boyfriend was already done eating by the time it came out again... Yes they took it off the bill, but they messed it up twice, and it took them like an hour to get it to me.  I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location really disappointed me."
Andreas F.,"Stockholm, Sweden",27,379,87,4.0,5/20/2014,"With a massive menu, and  favorable pricing, Cheesecake factory leaves no one behind. There are all sorts of food served and portions are as the menu, massive. Skip the appertizers and go with main and dessert, this is more than enough for most ppl. The cheesecakes for dessert should be a mandatory thing, so you should at least share one if you dont manage it by yourself. Take your time with the menu and let the waiter give you their suggestions. This i merica, go big or go home..."
Janelle J.,"San Diego, CA",163,97,40,4.0,7/9/2012,"First and foremost, this place is a chain restaurant. Not only that, it's POPULAR and located at a MALL. What do people expect? Saying that much, if you're coming here during dinner rush and expecting to get seated quickly AND then come on yelp to complain about it...well...let's just say I'm laughing at you and not with you. Come here for an early lunch (when they open) or for an earlier dinner before 6pm. It's been a few years since I've come to this location, but we arrived at 5:30 and got seated right away. We tried the Stuffed Mushrooms. I enjoyed that my appetizer actually came before the main dish. So many of these chain restaurants get that part wrong. Anyways, they were pretty decent. The wine and parmesan flavors complemented each other, but it was a tad bit on the salty side. They added a ""skinny"" menu for people who want to be calorie cautious...although nothing on the menu seems to be lower than 600 calories. Nonetheless, I tried the Skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich. I enjoyed it as it was light on the mayo. The bread was lightly toasted and quite tasty. I'm ate only a third of the salad, but that's not because it was bad. I'm just not a fan of arugula and endive. It came with a standard vinaigrette.  My husband got the Teriyaki Chicken dish. He enjoyed it quite a bit. And like everyone has been saying...the portions are HUGE. I took a bite and it was tasty as well...all the tang and sweetness expected in a teriyaki dish. I didn't finish my sandwich and left some room for cake. How could we not have some?! We went for the 30th Anniversary cake. It was pretty decadent. Cheesecake tends to be too rich for me, so I enjoyed this cake. It has layers of chocolate fudge cake and cheesecake. The flavors complemented each other well and was perfect to share between the two of us.  4 Stars for good service, huge portions, and pretty good food."
Sophiya L.,"El Cajon, CA",198,12,1,4.0,11/28/2015,Absolutely loved our server. She was super sweet and professional. The only downside were the hostesses in the front. They got a piss poor attitude. Overall great experience except for trying to be seated
Charlene L.,"Arcadia, CA",256,337,25,2.0,7/31/2012,"I came here because of their half off cheesecake promotion. This restaurant is, by far, the worst Cheesecake Factory that I have been to. We went in around lunch time (12pm) and after we were seated, our waitress came over and greeted us. However, she did not bother giving us her name or anything. She simply just handed us our menus and left.  For entrees, we had their Pasta Da Vinci and their Louisiana Chicken pasta. My friend's Pasta Da Vinci was about 1/4th smaller than my boyfriend's Pasta Da Vinci. I'm guessing they are not really consistent in terms of how much food they plate each time. I had their Louisiana Chicken pasta and it was a bit too flavorful and salty for my taste. The chicken was also really really thin - almost a sliver.  The worst part of my experience was our waitress. She was never around and was not really friendly towards us. In addition, she never offered to refill our water cups and because it was so hard for us to find her, we eventually did not even bother asking.  When it came time for dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes and it took out waitress almost 10 minutes to get them. I am not sure why plating two cheesecakes would take ten minutes but it somehow did.  The two stars are for their terrible service and inconsistent food quality."
Myrna H.,"El Cajon, CA",150,17,18,4.0,12/22/2015,Dessert Time - Yummy Banana Cream Cheesecake & Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake.  We arrived around 5:15 and beat the rush only a short wait. I server Kim was great.
Katya O.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",56,85,11,2.0,10/3/2015,Normally the food and service are good but today my chicken piccata was really bad! No flavor and it was really dry and they took forever to bring the food. Then I ordered coffee and they never brought the sugar!!!!
Jeff S.,"San Diego, CA",32,213,122,5.0,3/31/2015,"I love this restaurant! And Gil is an awesome manager! I ordered the chicken and biscuits and that dish is amazing! Plus they give you lots of chicken and an enormous biscuit and lots of fresh vegetables. This is my go to restaurant whenever I'm hungry and want something delicious filling and satisfying. The manager Gil stopped by to introduce himself and make sure I was satisfied with everything. I sure was! There's a reason this place gets wait times of up to 30 to 45 minutes for a table on weekends and holidays, that's because it's that good!"
Bastian K.,"San Diego, CA",14,4,,4.0,12/19/2015,This place is awesome. But the quality price ratio is a bit weak. But the atmosphere is the price worth.
Mia O.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,11,2.0,10/24/2015,I don't know why every time I come to this place I end up with bad service I always feel every waiter I get  has a bad attitude. Also I always have the worst experience with the food that I order either they don't have it or they end up just messing up my order. Last time I came here was about 2 weeks ago 3 times i was told they did not have what I had ordered. I hope this place works on the their customer service because they don't seem to know much about it.
Irit D.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,5.0,7/18/2014,If you are in a mood for a superb appetizer Go to cheese cake factory and order the Avocado egg rolls!!!!!   I recommend the one in fashion valley mall
Ashley J.,"San Diego, CA",544,507,304,2.0,1/29/2014,"Man what happened to cheesecake factory? ? They used to be my favorite restaurant!  The past few times I've gone, I've noticed the decrease in quality. It's almost gross. I had my favorite today, the almond chicken salad sandwhich, what happened here?! Different bread and chicken. The bread was soft and was a grain bread, now it's a piece of white bread slathered in butter and toasted (so much butter I asked to get a piece of plain bread and switch it out) but it didn't help the sandwich, they changed the chicken (it was diced) now it's poor quality pulled meat. And big chunks that are hard to chew. It almost looked comical when it came out. I was like seriously guys? The ceaser salad on the side was poor too. Old stale croutons, and the dressing is forgettable.  I also had fried catfish the last visit....omg no. Do not get this. I could only eat the mashed potatoes. It was full of grease and the batter was disgusting. One of the worst things I've ever eaten at a restaurant. The service is still good, good looking restaurant (beautiful actually) ,& they'll always have the avocado egg rolls and the cheesecake. Which is fantastic"
Jennifer C.,"San Francisco, CA",393,76,5,4.0,8/3/2015,I've been to this location a couple times and there's not much to say about this versus any other Cheesecake Factory. I do have to rave about their weekend brunch though. I'm very impressed by their pancakes and Belgian waffle these were probably better than I've had at most brunch places in San Diego. I will def come back for their brunch since there was no wait and so convenient to get my weekend shopping on!
Stephanie S.,"Honolulu, HI",97,117,134,2.0,7/18/2014,"This was my first trip here today. The girl at the desk that asks you how many people are in your group and ask if you want to sit inside or outside was pretty bad at good customer service. She had a very mellow voice and didn't seem to care much about her job. The Asian waiter we had with crazy gelled hair was very robotic, didn't have much emotion. He wasn't mean but he wasn't nice either. The food was pretty good, it wasn't FANTASTIC, but it wasn't awful. It's way too noisy and I hate how you have to sit two to three inches away from the next arty next to you. The prices were high too on okay food. Overall my experience here was eh. Not worth the price on the experience."
Malia P.,"San Diego, CA",467,623,174,3.0,3/26/2014,"Thought I could save time by eating out instead of cooking... Wrong! I spent 40 minutes waiting for the buzzer to go off after being told that it would be 15-20 minutes. Then waiting for my name to be called after they collected the buzzer. They gave us complimentary bread. The food was average, not worth the wait. We finished eating less than ten minutes after the food was set down. We ordered dessert and it took a long time to plate even though we asked them to ditch the whipped cream. The time from when we got into the restaurant to when we left was close to 2 hrs. 2 hrs I didn't have. I should've gone to fast food place but had a gift card here. Service was courteous. Four stars for that, food three, and the wait was 2 long."
Perla C.,"Las Vegas, NV",140,112,60,5.0,6/28/2015,"Let me start saying that this location is amazing. I did not get the managers name, but he was wearing a gray shirt, and he is amazing. We went a little after 12 am and we tried getting a cheesecake. One of the employees wasn't willing to sell us one, but he came by and was kind enough to get us someone to purchase a cheesecake. I hate being that one customer who comes in right when they're closing, but my sister in law and I were trying to buy my brother a cake and surprise him at work. Loved their customer service! You guys are amazing!"
Raymond A.,"San Diego, CA",857,314,964,4.0,7/15/2014,"great place with lots of food options.  meatloaf was delish!!!!  chicken was yummy as well.  only knock.. the mashers were clumpy.... not cool dude, not cool. house wine was tops!! two peeps gets in quick.. large groups... a bit of a wait."
Maria A.,"San Diego, CA",12,192,1067,1.0,3/20/2014,"This place seem to be going down. I thought we were lucky and got seated quickly. But lo and behold, NO ONE TOOK our order. We waited for 14 minutes, yes 14 minutes. BF timed them, and he gave 2 to 3 minutes buffer since we were looking at the menu. He said if no one comes in we will just leave. And some how, someone who supposedly not assigned to our table asked if we anyone took our order yet. The server noticed that BF is not happy because he said, no one helped us and we've been waiting for 14 minutes. So she said, oh I will help you, i'm not assigned to your table but I will take care of you. Then the manager came and apologized for the miscommunication. Really, that's it?  Guess they lost at least 2 clients."
