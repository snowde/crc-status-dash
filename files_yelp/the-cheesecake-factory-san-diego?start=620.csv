Negabadomi M.,"San Diego, CA",0,43,4,3.0,10/10/2015,"Came here last night at approximately 5:35pm. I thought we would miss the dinner rush hour but this place was still a zoo. When seated, our server was great. Food, not so much. I had the shrimp/chicken pasta gumbo. I would give it  a 4.5/10. My husband had french dip sandwich which he gave a 6/10. The kids ordered a kids pizza which I tasted which I would give a 6/10. I don't know what it is all the hype with this place. The food is just not very good."
Daniela M.,"San Diego, CA",77,109,179,5.0,8/24/2014,"If you are looking for a not expensive place to eat, this is the place!! Me and my husband love to bring tourist to here because it is nice, special and good price. The food is fantastic, the service amazing and the staff works hard and smiles all time. I strongly recommend the salads and the stake. All the cakes I eat were delicious, I love the Oreo one."
Steve G.,"San Diego, CA",122,60,3,4.0,7/26/2015,I don't think I've ever been disappointed with this place. If I'm feeling like beef I will go with the steak Diane. It's delicious and filling and there's always enough to take home. If it's lunch and I feel like Mexican I will go with a stuffed tortillas. They're really more like enchiladas. And of course love love love the cheesecake.
robert a.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,4.0,6/20/2016,"I went there with my family on Father's Day and had a great experience.  The food was very good, I had the crispy shrimp sandwich.  I did think that for calling it crispy shrimp the shrimp should have been fried a little harder, but that was ok because the rest of the sandwich was great.  Our server was Nicole and she did an amazing job.  She new her menu and the products and recommended some great cheese cakes for desert.  She was very friendly and attentive, but not to the point that she invaded on our meal and our good time.  I highly recommend that if you go there to request Nicole and enjoy a great experience."
James M.,"Mountain Center, CA",431,108,45,5.0,8/5/2015,"Excellent Food, Excellent service. The bread was amazing, I ordered the bacon burger it was amazing I really enjoyed it. My wife ordered the chicken in wine sauce off the lunch menu that looked amazing I did not eat any because by the time I realized I wanted to try some it was gone. Of course the cheesecake was an amazing ending to our wonderful trip."
Hannah S.,"Long Beach, CA",115,9,1,1.0,2/10/2015,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that I love The Cheesecake Factory and I would not be giving this specific restaurant one star if I didn't think it truly deserved it.  I went to San Diego for a fun birthday weekend, and on 2/7/2015, me and three friends went to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate. I wasn't thinking about the fact that it was 7pm on a Saturday night and that there would probably be a wait. When we went up to the counter, we were told the wait would be 1 hour and 15 minutes. We were all starving, but decided to wait it out (because we all love this restaurant). We were sat on the outside patio, which was fine by us. We were sat around 8pm, so the wait ended up being a little less than we had expected, but by the time our server actually showed up at our table, we might as well have waited outside.  Around 8:10, our server (I don't know his name because he didn't introduce himself), came to take our drink order. The Cheesecake Factory is known for their amazing bread, so I was excited to receive some with our drinks. Another 5 minutes went by and we did receive our drinks, but no bread. Then, the waiter told us he would ""be right back,"" but never returned. We ended up asking another server if we could have some bread, and he did not make any eye-contact with our table, said ""ya,"" and kept walking. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but that shouldn't take away from its customer service. A couple minutes later, our server came by and told us that they had ""changed their policy,"" and that the customers now need to ask for bread, and that's why he didn't bring any. I don't know if this is true or not, but I have been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory's, and none have expressed this ""policy."" Oh and by the way, he still didn't bring any bread at this point.  This is when everything went REALLY downhill.   Another few minutes went by, we finally got our bread, and our server took down our orders. At this point, it was precisely 8:24pm. I know this because we started to time how long everything was taking. Around 8:29, our server came back and told us that he didn't write ""legibly,"" and that he couldn't read what our orders were (WHAT?!). We proceeded to re-tell him our orders, and then asked for another basket of bread. He was a bit more on top of things at this point, and told us that the wheat bread was in the oven, and it wouldn't be out for another 10 minutes.  At about 8:45, the manager on duty came onto the patio and walked up to the table directly next to us to apologize for the wait. This party was seated about 20 minutes after we were, yet we were completely ignored. The manager brushed by us like we weren't even there. A couple minutes later, that table, that had come AFTER us, got their food (and a basket of the bread that was supposedly ""in the oven""). By that point, I was truly angry, but the story continues.  After 40 minutes of waiting, our food finally arrived. One of my friends got his food about 5 minutes before we did, but the rest of us received ours at the same time. We were all angry at this point, but we were so hungry that we all dug in. My boyfriend's burger was cold, like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for the past half hour. I was so angry that I didn't even want to eat my food anymore, and I went to talk to a manager about this terrible experience. Now, this was the same manager that had ignored us earlier, but I put that aside and explained the situation. I showed her to our table, and she asked the rest of the party what had happened, even though I had just told her everything. It was almost like she needed another witness to believe what had actually happened. She wasn't kind, but she apologized which I appreciated. However, she only offered to comp MY meal and gave us 3 free desserts. I was grateful for this, but my boyfriends burger was cold, which she knew, and she still didn't offer to have his meal comped. She only offered to re-make it. I don't know what was going through this woman's mind, but I think we deserved to have all our meals comped. After we saw our server and the manager deliberating right in front of us, our server came back with dessert menus, and never apologized.  We finally got our cheesecakes and left The Cheesecake Factory after 10PM. We got everything to-go, because we had no interest in eating our desserts there, and I especially did not want to ""celebrate"" by birthday there any longer. I know we were treated the way we were because we were a group of young adults. We clearly weren't respected in any way, yet we gave no reason to be disrespected. This is the worst experience I've ever had at one of these restaurants, and I will never be returning to this specific location."
Tina C.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,1,4.0,10/17/2014,"I visited Cheesecake Factory with two couples a few weekends ago on a Saturday at 7:30 pm. Because Fashion Valley is Fashion Valley, there of course was still a 30 minute wait. No worries - the weather is nice, and there is plenty of room to wait. We had several issue with our waitress during the course of our dinner. It wasn't over the top awful, but it was bad enough that I chose to write a comment on their website. Today I received a letter from the store manager assuring me that she personally dealt with the issue. She also recommended that the next time I come into the Cheesecake Factory that I should ask for a manager, just to ensure my visit ""is a wonderful one."" I am so impressed by this level of excellence in customer service that I had to come on here and post! Plus, as always, their food is on point. Delicious."
Cara B.,"San Diego, CA",12,63,18,4.0,7/16/2015,"Great place that opens late. Their cheesecake is amazing. We got tiramisu and omg! It was lovely. A bit pricey, but hey!  You should know that coming in. Anyway, we ordered chicken pot stickers,  bacon bacon burger, another burger I'm forgetting the name of and portofino burger.  All the price seem reasonable, except for pot stickers. There were only about six pot stickers and it costed $12."
Chris P.,"San Diego, CA",406,539,63,3.0,6/30/2014,I would call it a 3.5star spot.  White Chicken chili is very good but more like a rich gumbo.  The rice they give you in it is not enough to satisfy.  The chicken in it was cooked perfectly. The service was a bit slow and the host girl had a bad attitude.  Our waters never got refilled. But the cheese cake is delicious! Raspberry lemon was the bomb.  Smores was a bit over the top sweet.
Nichole B.,"Goose Creek, SC",0,9,,5.0,9/15/2015,"We had such a great experience here. Service was prompt and courteous, food was absolutely delicious. Closest to authentic Mai Tai I've had on the mainland!"
Beth P.,"San Diego, CA",24,4,,1.0,6/22/2016,"OMG we have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years and tonight we went for my daughter's birthday and the food was horrible and when we expressed our dissatisfaction to the server there was no apology or explanation for why. I even spoke to the manager and he really didn't seem to care and worse he didn't apologize either. Out of four meals all of them were very dry and disappointing. The Luau salad was extremely dry and the pasta was so bad when you tried to take a bite the entire portion stuck to your fork because of lack of sauce and the chicken was very dry, The pizza had almost no sauce on it so we tried to dip it in the extra cream sauce we requested but it was so cold and bland it didn't help."
Suzie L.,"La Mesa, CA",90,26,,5.0,9/9/2015,"My friend and I had gift cards to use so we opted to go and use them.  Our server, Adrianna E., was very attentive and courteous.  She was consistent in checking our beverages for refills and was knowledgeable of the vast menu and assisted with our cheesecake orders on our way out.  I have not always had a great experience at this particular restaurant, but this time, Adrianna, made it worth our while and we will definitely go back and request her from now on.  I would highly recommend the Cuban Roll Wraps appetizer; they were absolutely delicious!!!"
Nikki L.,"Manhattan, NY",202,1020,104,3.0,7/15/2012,"I come to Cheesecake Factory because I like the semi-fancy, high ceiling, marble feel of the environment. The experience feels slightly more elegant. The best part of Cheesecake Factory though, are the cheesecakes. I've had good pastas, and Chinese Chicken salad here. My experience with their other foods....not so good. We got the buffalo chicken wings as an appetizer, they were just ordinary wings I could have bought frozen and reheated from Costco. It came with 3 sticks of celery. We also tried the Steak Diane with Salmon combo - it was medallions of beef sauteed in a too strong sauce with mushrooms. How do I describe the sauce....too sweet, too savory...too much, not right. The salmon tasted overcooked and mushy. The few sprigs of asparagus it came with were a little hard on the bottom. The Steak Diane and Scampi combo was the same, only the Scampi was 3 lone shrimps cooked in an oily, too creamy sauce...the basil and tomato were cooked right in and much overdone. I could not taste it, and by cooking in the sauce that way, it didn't taste fresh. The combos are really not worth it. They don't do meat right. Stick with cheesecakes, salads, and maybe pasta here."
Todd L.,"San Diego, CA",146,16,,4.0,3/9/2014,"This is one of my favorite places to go for dinner in San Diego. This is also the busiest location of the Cheesecake Factory I've ever seen. The reason they're not getting 5 stars from me is the wait to eat can be incredibly long. They don't take reservations so if you're going here at primetime, your wait could easily exceed 1 hour. There isn't a lot of waiting room either so plan on standing around or going shopping while you wait. This location is located in the Fashion Valley Mall in Mission Valley so there's plenty of shops nearby for your convenience.  The entire wait staff here wears all white which I kind of like. I've yet to see spots on any of the employees attire which shows you they care for a clean and tidy restaurant.  The menu is quite extensive. There's everything from pasta to seafood to burgers to Chinese food and tai dishes. They also offer a skinnylicious menu if you prefer to eat as healthy as possible when you eat out. They have a variety of options on this menu as well and that's more often than not what I order off of. Their prices are pretty cheap on the skinnylicious menu as well as you're typically getting a smaller serving of food. If you get their normal menu items, you get a ton of food. If you ever have any issues with your order the wait staff is very good at getting that taken care of and they all have been very friendly.  My tables of choice are in the bar area. If you're lucky enough to find an open table, just sit and avoid the wait. There are a few TV's in the bar which are nice if you can't go a meal without watching sports. They have a full bar so you can order a wide variety of drinks.  The bathrooms are some of the nicest I've seen in busy restaurants. They are always clean and tidy so you're not disgusted by just walking in.  Overall the Cheesecake Factory is a good deal for food and quality, and yes the cheesecake is good if you're looking for dessert to finish your meal."
Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",158,219,69,3.0,2/22/2014,"Went to this location at the Fashion Valley Mall.  Although there was quite a line of people waiting, we got seated in 10 minutes - we only had 2 people in our group and we asked for first available. They sat us outside, but even on a chilly evening it was not a problem as the ratio of tables to heaters was almost 1-to-1.  With the flames glistening against my face, an enjoyable meal was ensured. Did you know that the Cheesecake isn't all about crap food anymore?  They have what they are referring to as their ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  It consists of items that are under a certain calorie content - for example there are pasta and meat dishes that all fall under 590 calories.   We got the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta.  It tasted really bland.  I wanted to dump a pound of cheese all over it to somehow improve the flavor.  Despite the low calorie count, it was still really filling.   The best part about the evening is that the bill wasn't crazy.  We both shared filling entrees and got out of there at $30 with tip.  Not too shabby! My only recommendation would be to skip the skinnylicious menu and go right for the Delicious menu.  Your stomach will thank you!!!!"
Alison V.,"Albany, NY",316,793,336,4.0,1/20/2012,"OMG this place is so freakin' busy!  My mom, step-daughter, and I came here around lunch time on a Thursday afternoon (given it was the week after Christmas) and had a 30(ish) minute wait for a table.   That being said, once we got seated the service was fabulous.  The servers must have changed shifts during our meal since our initial waitress came over and introduced a waiter who was taking over.  I was impressed.   The food here is what you'd expect to find at a Cheesecake factory.  The portions are HUGE and we could have taken home enough food for 2 more meals if we weren't getting ready to leave town that day.  The food was prepared well and correctly to order.   Overall, it was a very positive Cheesecake Factory experience."
Abraham T.,"San Diego, CA",18,28,36,2.0,11/11/2014,"Nice ambience, bit crowded but its to be expected on Veterans Day. Food was ok, nothing to brag about. My wife brought me here for my birthday and for being a veteran, i have to say, i ordered 1 mojito, cant say it was at all good, i figured maybe it was just watered down, so i ordered another, before I know it, i had 4 mojitos i didnt feel anything of a buzz. When I asked the waitress, nothing seemed to make sense. My only suggestions, food presentation was a bit sloppy, and lastly, if your going to charge $12-$15 for a mojito, its only FAIR the drink show for it. ""CONSISTENCY"" Maybe a bit of bar tending training is needed. The mojito was basically lemonade with mint and full of ICE.  Our time of visit was at 8:00pm 11/11 , the barkeep was a blonde female, hope that helps.  I dont think i ever want to drink here again."
Judith H.,"San Diego, CA",77,40,22,4.0,7/16/2014,Great food and great staff. Just wish our last waiter was more informed on their menu. Really liked the herbed salmon we got Today.
Erica A.,"San Diego, CA",25,70,114,4.0,6/22/2012,"So, their menu is always overwhelming to me but their food has always been consistently good. This is a chain restaurant but they do experiment a little with the appetizers on their menu. My favorites are their avocado spring rolls and their blue cheese/pear flat bread- Delicious! Also, they have the most delectable cheescake in the world! My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake...sooo good! Cheesecake Factory is always busy so come right when they open or just pick up a slice of their amazing cheesecake to go!"
Bella N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,2,4.0,4/18/2014,"It was a pleasure to eat there, the waiters was amazing, very polite, nice n when I didn't know what I wanna to eat they help me like 15 min. The food was butter then any kind of food that I ate before. BUT it's took like 50 min to get my food, and still everything was wonderful."
