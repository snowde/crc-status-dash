Brenda I.,"El Cajon, CA",43,27,21,2.0,9/13/2015,"Ive come here 3 different times expecting to change my mind about this place but its just horrible. My friends rave about this place but I dont see the appeal. Its usually busy in the evenings, the food is just OKAY, for the price it could be way better. The cheesecake is exceptional, thats all this place is good for."
Iris D.,"Escondido, CA",28,17,17,5.0,8/19/2015,Their Monte Carlo for Sunday brunch is the best thing ever! But you need to try their fried macaroni and cheese. I love their red velvet cheesecake too!
Ashly B.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,1,5.0,10/13/2015,"Came here for my birthday with my mom in law, it was my first time here, and it was great!! We walked in and we were seated immediately, our waiter couldn't have been more kind. He was always checking on us and keeping a light conversation going. Some of the staff sang to me as well, which is always a little embarrassing but fun none the less. The food was fantastic, I got the chicken carbonara which was delicious. My mom got the burrito, it was huge!! But she really enjoyed it. For dessert we shared a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake, it was to die for. So yummy!! It was a fun and inviting place to be, can't wait to go again."
T S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,2,1.0,5/28/2016,"I've been to here several times and enjoyed the experience and food every time. However, this time was certainly different. I finished my water approximately 5 minutes after it was served and it was never re-filled. I would have asked but our waitress didn't come back to our table until it was time to ask us if we wanted dessert. I asked for mor water at that time and still no water. Truly disappointed in the service and it will certainly be a while before I go back."
Joanie T.,"San Diego, CA",559,226,362,3.0,4/23/2015,"I came here on Monday with my sister for a late lunch after shopping at the mall. We came and got seated right away.  Our server was named Thomas. He was very nice but something seemed a bit off from him so let me explain. We asked for just the brown bread and he brought us those and then we were ready to order. So I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and my sister ordered a salad. She had asked him where the crab wontons were on the menu and as he bent over the table (...bending all the way down) he kinda clonk me in the head with his booklet he was holding. At the time I didn't want to say or make a big deal about it so I didn't say anything but my sister saw and laughed of course. So we get all our food and then I see him help another table and somehow he runs and almost fell pretty hard but caught himself on this big round table and goes ""ohhhh am I a clumsy person"". I really don't know how to ran into it that hard. I mean the distance from the big round tables to the others surrounded by it was a big gap.  All in all. By his movement, he seemed as if he was tired or maybe just too old for a fast pace company.  The fettuccine Alfredo was okay..I felt as if it was bland. The crab wontons were good. We also got the corn soup which was quite pleasant and was presented by Thomas so we got it. And the salad was delicious. We asked for Togo boxes and packed everything Togo and ended up leaving it behind on accident ):  But honestly, my whole visit that day I felt bad for the poor guy. ): He was a great server though and he did everything we asked and needed. But there was just a few things odd about him..maybe it was an off day for the poor guy."
Travis O.,"Stanwood, WA",0,29,8,4.0,8/9/2015,"I highly recommend the corn cake tamales to start your meal. Our table had everything from quesadillas, Cuban sandwiches, fish and chips and orange chicken. All were happy and full when we were done. Our son ordered the luncheon portion to save room for cheesecake."
Emi L.,"San Diego, CA",3,60,11,4.0,6/29/2014,"This restaurant is always busy. Parking is congested. Always clean. There is a lot of reflective surfaces, so there noise level is generous and lots of echoes. The menu is, well, a booklet. Enjoy the freshy baked bread while you peruse the offerings. Its definitelu worth it. There is something for everybody. Vegan, on a diet, sweet-tooth. Portion sizes are generous. Full bar, so order alcohol at will. Don't forget dessert! Cheesecakes are, of course, their specialty. But their fudge cake is also quite outstanding. As is the warm apple crisp. A la mode, of course. It's good. He good and bad: It's like every other cheesecake factory. So if you like the chain, this doesn't disappoint."
Jen L.,"Milpitas, CA",25,246,126,4.0,2/15/2012,Dining in at this particular cheesecake factory for the first time.  It's so much louder and crowded than the one in Valley Fair mall in Santa Clara (SF bay area). We were just 2 people so we only had to wait 15 min. there were a lot of larger groups and you can tell they've been waiting for a while.  So be prepped to wait if you got a large party. food is always delicious and consistent. our favorites are thai lettuce wrap appetizer and cajun jambalaya. The plate is a large portion so it's enough for a second meal and it tastes just as good.  The waiters and waitresses are patient and come around often enough to fill your bread basket and drinks.
Jmarania M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,26,37,1.0,8/6/2015,"Im writing this review while at the table here at the chesse cake factory. We are here visitng from out of town and decided against my better judgement to eat here we called ahead for a party of 8 and where told the wait would be 30 min. An hour later we where still there waiting for a table. Host station cant give us a straight answer....not a good thing to have 3 hungry kids waiting. I should of went with my gut and went somewhere else. The restaurant was busy, but i believe its better to over estimate then under estimate the wait time. Especially when we had to keep asking. On a bright note our server ""sheryll"" was great. Very prompt with a great attitude. Food was mediocre at best. Not sure why i come back to the this chain of restaurants."
Kimberly T.,"San Diego, CA",96,121,242,5.0,12/20/2013,"Also the burgers are bomb!!! so is the spicy jambalaya!! and the orange chicken was pretty good too, they use big, actually huge pieces of white meat chicken."
Victoria G.,"San Diego, CA",32,5,,1.0,12/31/2013,"12/31 Order food from Fashional valley  Cheesecake factory  for our company News Year Eve luncheon and all our food was cold @ 11:00 and was told be ready between 30 minues. arrived at 11:35 am phoned in upon arrival waited  10 mins for the server to come out and then took payment and return back another 10min. I have the receipt with the time stamped. Our hot plate food was cold (refridgated temp) .  We called the resaurant manager (Gary) to inform him of what happened. Gary responded "" What do you want me to do?)  He was unprofessional and unsymptomatic. He did not even apologized    he also ""said bring back the food, really?   If any other resturant, ths would call for a full refund, but all that was offered was a $50.00 Gift Card, but this doesnot cover the cost of all the hot food."
Tricia H.,"San Diego, CA",41,37,25,1.0,12/21/2013,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. I've been to various locations, but this one stands out - in a bad way. Young lady at the front counter today was extremely rude. What a great way to start your guests off at your restaurant?? Her ""service"" will be the reason why I will not be returning to that Cheesecake Factory. And in addition to her unwelcoming attitude, she took the 3 second opportunity to respond to a text on her phone while we quickly confirmed with our group that we wanted to sit indoors. I literally waited for her to finish texting because she didn't hear me respond ""indoors, please"" the first time. Then she rolled her eyes at me when I told her again ""indoors, please"" and gave her a are-you-seriously-texting-on-your-phone-right-now look Waitress never smiled once. At that point I had already given up hope on customer service here. Got a glance at the bottom of a plate as the server was setting it down on the table and... yuck. who knows what was stuck on the bottom. I sure as heck didn't check *ignorance is bliss* anyways, warily ate my food trying not to think about why their plates weren't getting cleaned properly.  Food was on par with other Cheesecake Factories that I have been to, But, again, I will not be here again due to that terrible restaurant experience"
Andrea R.,"Seattle, WA",25,74,11,5.0,6/15/2015,"My Sunday night spot since it's never busy and the patio at night is so calming with the fire space warmers and the comfortable patio furniture. The food never disappoints. The Santa Fe Salad is a favorite, but I can never eat even half of it because there is so much food. Their warm spinach dip is pretty good too! And I recently just tried their raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. OMG! It's the best thing to happen since chocolate."
Dan P.,"San Diego, CA",65,303,3,1.0,8/1/2012,"Let me preface by saying that I don't like Cheesecake and I only went here because of a birthday dinner for my GF's sister. Waited 90 minutes for a table (why the heck don't these idiots at this kind of Chain restaurant take reservations?) on a MONDAY night because it was ""national cheesecake day"" even though no such thing actually exists.  Sat down and the waiter was quite friendly, but the table was a cheap outdoor one with really uncomfortable seats.   I ordered the Chicken Di Pana with a side of ""cheesy"" grits.  It also came with Broccoli.  Even though the plate was the size of a small table, the serving size of food itself was not exactly anything special.  The chicken was bland and flavorless, and despite the appearance of the breading, it was not in any way crunchy, which suggests to me that it was made earlier and then microwaved.  The broccoli was barely cooked and without any kind of flavor whatsoever. The ""grits"" were a joke.  They were honestly closer to Baby food than Grits.  There were actual corn pieces in it and yet no actual GRIT.  Seriously, it was corn-flavored mush with a few corn kernals and no taste of cheese.  Compare to the cheesy grits at ""The Americana"" in Del Mar and there is no comparison and they are the same price...and ""The Americana"" has better food. Oh yeah, and the manager said that because of the high demand for Cheesecake that night that they had to get the order for Cheesecakes 20 minutes in advance so they could be transported from the bakery...Hmm, I thought this was a cheesecake FACTORY.  Doesn't that imply that the cheesecakes are made in house? Overpriced, over-crowded, not-very-good food, SLOW service (the guy was nice, but my water sat empty for the last half of the meal and we spent 15 minutes trying to flag him down to get the check and takeout boxes) means 1 star. I don't get why people like these kinds of places.  Sure, the menu is big, but the food is mediocre at best and it's not exactly cheap."
Zak P.,"Anaheim, CA",120,344,,3.0,11/11/2013,"This is going to be a short review because most everyone knows Cheesecake factory and their menu... And if you don't there are plenty of other reviews out there that explain in minute details about it. This location is huge, and appropriately so because even with its large size you will still find you have to wait on weekends and even some weeknights. They do have a pretty fabulous outdoor patio with plenty of heaters and fire sculptures (ya fire sculptures!, they are pretty cool). Service at this location is pretty good, which is surprising because most locations are pretty bad. Our server did mess up a bit but was very apologetic. So  I guess if I had to dine at Cheesecake factory I would do so at this one. But... I will still stick to just swinging in to grab a cheesecake to go."
Mimi P.,"San Diego, CA",26,44,53,4.0,8/15/2013,"There's always a wait every time I come; however, the waits are usually only 15-40 mins long.. So it isn't that bad! Everyone has to check out their pasta! Delicious! & you can't forget their cheesecakes! I've only had the strawberry, the Oreo one, and red velvet. All three were very delicious! If you're a cheesecake lover then this is the place for you!"
Andrew B.,"San Diego, CA",4,27,19,4.0,12/20/2013,"Food is excellent and the portions are large. I always crave their cheesecakes and always try a new one. Getting it to go is simple and fast too... unless you decide to park; expect a long wait. The setting and ambiance is nice and classy at night, and the lit torches add a nice flavor. Their Alfredo is nice and saucy and pleases my taste buds. I regret ordering an appetizer before the meal, I couldn't even finish half of it. Great place to go for a date, anniversary, large party, or nice occasions with family. Try the oreo cheesecake, I have never seen an oreo that big ever."
Carlo P.,"San Gabriel, CA",172,30,42,3.0,6/21/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory that's all I'm going to say. The best part about this restaurant chain is their cheesecakes really! For this location in particular the restaurant is pretty dim. The inside could be a bit brighter, my eyes have a hard time even looking at the food because it is too dim. The service is awesome, I didn't really encounter bad service just yet, but this place can be a bit of a wait if it's dinner on a weekend! Other than that the wait time is pretty average. My favorite dish here is the 4 cheese pasta! It's so bomb, and my favorite cheesecake is the Hershey's Cheesecake! The only downfall about the restaurant is parking, which can be a bit difficult especially since this location is located at the mall! Overall average food, but awesome cheesecakes, parking can be a little tight, and the wait times can be long if you go on a weekend!"
Willy W.,"Culver City, CA",125,683,905,4.0,12/28/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite chain restaurant. That being said, I don't go too often for a few reasons. Namely:  1) they don't take reservations 2) that means a pretty long wait regardless of party size 3) the prices are a little higher than most places 4) it's often like zoo inside because it is so wildly popular 5) most of their food is very rich - ie fatty BUT in turn, their food is very tasty and they serve some outstanding (IMHO) cheesecakes. Stopped by this particular location because it was awfully nearby the infamous Hotel Circle. However, it's located by a mall which makes it even more crowded. So we waited around 35 minutes for a table for 6. I suppose that isn't too bad because it definitely could have been worse. Everyone enjoyed their food and we all shared two cheesecakes for dessert: the ""tiramisu"" and ""chocolate raspberry truffle"". Both were good, but the latter was the standout that night. It was very rich and the raspberry flavor was noticeable but not overpowering. The tiramisu one was a little too soggy for my taste. It was basically a tiramisu with a small layer of cheesecake dumped on top. I probably wouldn't order that one again. Parking is readily available in the mall, but ""it is what is"" when it comes to The Cheesecake Factory..."
Jasmine R.,"San Diego, CA",2,15,9,4.0,5/31/2015,"This place is very delicious. The mai tais were tasty and not overpowering with alcohol, but still gave me a buzz. The bread was soooo warm and moist. I like the wheat with the oats on top. They don't give enough butter and I had a split of warm butter which was easy to spread and cold butter, which was why I was confused on why I had cold and warm butter. I had the Cajun jambalaya chicken and shrimp pasta and holy poop! This was sooooo good. The shrimp was so fresh and the chicken literally melted in my mouth it was so moist and delicious! I don't usually like chicken in my pasta but this was out of this world! My boyfriend had a bacon bacon burger, which he teared up (haha) because it was the best burger he ever had. He said there was plenty of bacon and it was cooked beautifully, he also said the cheese was melted just right and the meat had a little pink which was juicy. The cheesecakes is so delicious!!! I would close my eyes and just enjoy all the flavors in my mouth. It wasn't too sweet and it was just right. My mouth would water and it would just fulfill my sweet cravings. My waiter was very attentive and would always check up on us. He deserved the tip we gave him. He would pack my leftovers away and made sure our cheesecakes that we had to go was nicely put away. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars because the lighting in there is ALWAYS so dark. I understand it's about the ambiance and the romantic dim feeling in the room but jeeze, I love to see my food and the pictures didn't come out so good. Overall I had a wonderful experience here and my tummy was satisfied."
