Cindy L.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,7/8/2015,"I ordered a negroni from the bar, which contained at most 0.5 oz of Campari, vermouth, and the oiliest gin I've ever had, which was served on ice. To make matters worse, the cocktail cost me $11."
Kendrick P.,"San Diego, CA",9,2,,4.0,6/14/2015,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory, and it was packed! With that said, wait was short (), our server was friendly and had perfect timing (). Staff accommodated our seating to comfort us and our baby () Food was pretty good both my lady and I tried pasta dishes that did not disappoint (). Cheesecake () night of indulgence was a success."
Jimmy K.,"San Diego, CA",276,104,33,2.0,8/3/2012,"My recommendation: stawberry cheesecake The two times I've come to this cheesecake factory for dinner, I've left with the same feeling of...shoulda just gone to In-n-out.  Service was slow, wait was really long, and the food was 'meh' I can not for the life of me understand why people want to wait 40 minutes to eat at a chain restaurant, in a mall with overpriced, terrible food ($15 for a burger, $20 for a fettuccine alfredo?).  In addition, it is super loud all the time and you are always sitting elbow-to-elbow with some other couple on a first date."
Emil A.,"Oceanside, CA",2,100,34,5.0,11/18/2013,"This restaurant has fast become our favorite in San Diego.  Yes, yes--it's a chain but I gotta tell 'ya, the food is absolutely divine.  Their service is superb and they take care of you when things go awry.  For example, my wife ordered some fish several months ago and it was under cooked.  They totally comp'd the entire meal and threw in a piece of cake.   The outdoor patio is preferred.  It's too noisy inside."
Angel N.,"San Diego, CA",12,34,13,4.0,6/1/2015,"Came here for a double date and was seated out on the patio. I really like the seating there, it was nice and warm with the heat lamps and the seats were super comfortable with the pillow cushions. We order the avocado egg rolls and those were amazing, the sauce is to die for. I also ordered the shrimp scampi, and it was super yummy! The shrimp was breaded just enough and the tomatoes were so fresh!"
James S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/30/2016,Love everything about this place..food amazing...service without doubt best I've seen. Will definitely be back because of the service and food
Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152,4.0,3/30/2015,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, except when the wait is so long, you have to choose another restaurant to eat at. Most of the time, my family and I just wait for a table in the bar because it tends to be quicker than waiting for a table in the dining areas. Besides that, the service is always pretty consistent and the food never seems to take too long to come out. Luckily, they offer delicious bread to snack on while you wait for what you ordered. Some of my favorite items are the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger, Grilled Turkey Burger, Chinese Chicken Salad, and most recently, the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich. Honestly, I'm not a big cheesecake person, but the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is a great choice. I recommend splitting it with someone due to how rich it is though! It's nice that there are so many different options but, it's always a challenge deciding on what to order! Their Skinnylicious menu is the best because it allows me to indulge a little without overeating. They also have a tasty breakfast menu that I never tired in all the years I've come here until lately. For Sunday Brunch, the Eggs Benedict is my go to. On the daily breakfast menu, I really enjoyed the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich (scrambled egg, smoked bacon, ham, grilled tomato, melted cheddar cheese and mayonnaise on grilled brioche bread) that I tried for the first time about a week ago. The potatoes were actually really good too because they were mixed with sautéed onions. The meal was so filling, I had to take half of it home. I'm definitely going to come here for breakfast again soon!"
Wendy D.,"Bremerton, WA",0,10,,1.0,8/14/2015,This place has really gone downhill. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad and it was awful. Lettuce was wilted and chicken was half frozen. For $15 what a ripoff. Costco has a better salad for $6. My husband had a burger which was half the size they used to be. Not eating there again. Another chain gone bad.
Greg E.,"Marietta, GA",134,483,65,4.0,11/15/2011,"The last time I ate at The Cheesecake Factory was at the Atlanta, GA location back in 2004. I can't believe it has been so long since I last ate at this restaurant. I was served by a waiter named William B. He was okay overall and I never had a problem with his service. They give you free bread before you order your meal. The bread wasn't as soft or as warm as I would have liked but it still tasted alright. Their menu is like a book. So many options that I didn't know what I wanted. I eventually settled for the Pasta Da Vinci  . It was pretty good and portion was huge. I manage to finish it and then of course I had to get the cheesecakes for dessert. This is where the minus one star comes in. The prices of one slice of cheesecake is too high. One slice alone costs $8.00. Granted they are delicious, especially the Oreo Cheesecake that I had but still, at that price the slices should have been a lot larger. I'm pretty sure that I could buy a whole cheesecake pie at a local bakery for only maybe $10.00 max. Sometimes it is better to sacrifice quality over quantity if you're on a tight budget, but if you want to splurge in a finer upscale environment without any concerns on the quality, then check this restaurant out."
Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,4.0,1/30/2012,"Every time I visit The Cheesecake Factory, I'm amazed at the sheer magnitude of their menu. There are so many choices and everything sounds so good that the most challenging part of visiting is choosing what to eat. I narrowed my lunch selection to the club sandwich or herb-crusted salmon and after much debate, opted for the fish. And boy was it good! The salmon was moist and tender and the mashed potatoes were wonderful. I especially loved the sauce that ringed the plate and perfectly complemented both the salmon and potatoes.  The waiter cracked me up when I asked for extra potatoes in place of the asparagus and he called me a ""reverse vegetarian."" Yep, that's right, no veggies for me! Despite the restaurant being packed, we only waited 10 minutes for a table and our food arrived quickly. One other quick tip, try to eat outside on the patio on a nice, warm day. It's shaded by the building and offers a nice, relaxing spot to get some fresh air."
Glenn C.,"El Cajon, CA",25,100,38,4.0,5/19/2012,"This was our first time visiting the CheeseCake Factory. We had heard many good things over the years and decided to check things out for ourselves. The Fashion Valley Mall is not well known for having ample, easy parking. Tonight was no different. Traffic galore with minimal spaces available...it's not Christmas shopping time -is it? The wait to get seated was just about an hour. Not sure this is normal for a Friday night (7:30pm), but there were lots of prom night couples. Now onto the food: My wife had the ""Three Taco"" Skinnylicious dinner. She found the tacos to be excellent but the sauce was a bit too spicy for her tastes...kinda buffalo-ish. I had the meatloaf dinner. It was served less than hot (but good for me as I like it that way). It was quite flavorful and well enjoyed.  Both meals had good portions and we now know why everyone was walking out with ""doggy bags"". Service: Our waiter was named Daniel. He was attentive and made sure we got what we needed...as busy as this place was says something. Will return but when the wait is much less."
Martina C.,"Lemon Grove, CA",16,17,3,5.0,4/20/2015,"5 stars for the staff! Their customer service was amazing. Lovely atmosphere. Appetizers and drinks were great! Their entrées were not the best, maybe my choices weren't great. Great staff every employee I came cross were so nice!"
Zildheam D.,"San Diego, CA",478,671,1228,4.0,12/3/2011,"I normally dont like big chain restaurants but the cheesecake factory is one of my few exceptions. Their meals are always huge and delicious. I love the bar, the bartenders can get creative and make you about anything! You wont find a better selection of cheesecakes anywhere else. Long wait and loud noisy location. Good luck finding a seat!"
Weston M.,"San Diego, CA",2,10,1,3.0,6/12/2015,"I really don't like leaving bad reviews but this was my first time at Cheesecake Factory. I've heard about it for years and finally went with my family to celebrate my cousin's graduation.  Long wait was expected and no fault of theirs. Service was good in the meantime and during the meal. The food was not what I expected after this much anticipation. My relatives weren't particularly impressed with their pasta, my aunt's linguine was stuck together in a bundle, and my burger that was recommended by the server was very average. First place I've ever been to where the fries had more flavor than the onion rings. I feel like I must have came at a bad time because my family and friends have raved about this place for the longest time. I'll give it another shot in time, just no rush after last night."
S W.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,1,2.0,7/6/2015,Our food was lukewarm - we sent it back - one of the replacement plates had a hair in it.  Awkward to send back again... So we didn't.  The server Frank was congenial considering - I'm sure it was frustrating for him to be the point of contact.
Jessica C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1075,275,379,4.0,2/15/2015,"I'm writing a review for yesterday. Valentines day, their busiest day of the year. It took an hour and a half to get seated. I tried calling ahead and they said they don't do reservations on valentines day which I understand because of how crazy busy it was. We just walked around Fashion Valley. I got the filet mignon. Delicious. The fries were dull though but nothing salt and ketchup can't fix. Their ranch seemed to be too much? I'm not sure how to explain it but it was odd. The fried calamari was sooo good. Last time I tried grief calamari at a sushi place, I almost puked from how slimy it was but this one was perfect! It's so hard picking out a slice of cheesecake because all look so good! The Oreo is hard to finish completely because of the chocolate edge but it was delicious. Even though the server was really busy, she always dropped by to see how our meal was and made sure our drink cups were full! I love this place. I just think valentines day is the worst day to be here especially from how unorganized everyone is when you first walk in from how many people were there."
Elizabeth N.,"San Diego, CA",37,70,23,5.0,2/17/2014,"I am always satisfied with the customer service whenever I eat here. Most recently, my sister and I have been having these huge Cheesecake Factory cravings. So after work, we decided to go there. By the time we got there, it was already 11, and they close at 12. They welcomed us with open arms despite the time. We asked to be seated outside since we love their landscaping. Our waitress was very nice, attentive, and patient. We ordered: - Calamari appetizer (So good with lemon squeezed on top!! I like how the batter can be easily removed since I'm not a batter type of person. Great portion) - Shrimp scampi (Very good, next time we'll order with sauce on the side since it was saturated in it) - Chicken maderia (I think that's how it's spelled. We chose that since it was a popular pick. We didn't really like it as much as we wanted to. It was just chicken, nothing special.) - Godiva cake (Very good! I took two bites and I was full. It's really heavy. But so smooth, and delicious) I also order other items but at different locations. At the Cheesecake in Irvine Spectrum, my boyfriend and I ordered: - Chicken potstickers (So bomb, but ask for sauce on the side since the sauce is salty) - Cajun jumbalayan pasta (SO GOOD, OMG. Just thinking about it makes me crave it) - BBQ Salmon (It was recommended by our server but it was salmon with BBQ sauce on it. Nothing special)"
Adam A.,"Pāhoa, HI",1,30,42,2.0,11/12/2013,Usually the Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. I didn't enjoy this one very much.  I was in town for a bit and came in. I had the fish and chips. The server was nice but the food was sub par. The fish was super greasy and not very good. The fries were kind of soggy and the coleslaw had so much dressing it was like soup! Usually this franchise is pretty good but this time it was a bummer.
Sophia Y.,"San Mateo, CA",816,1408,2385,3.0,5/13/2012,"Came here on Wednesday night around 5:30pm, which I was glad about because when we left, it looked kind of busy. They have a pretty extensive menu but I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with fries. I was actually kind of dissapointed. The bread was good, the cheese was good, the steak was good, but it was just so greasy! The fries were pretty good. Nice and crispy. Not particularly greasy, but they are fried in oil so it didn't help the sandwich taste any better. I had the leftovers again the next day and it still didn't taste any better. I do like the free bread and butter the give you before the meal comes. It comes out nice and warm and the rye bread was the best! The sourdough was good too. Overall, I didn't like this particular meal, but we didn't have to wait to get seated and the service was okay. Maybe it's because I didn't get the cheese cake? I might give this place another chance, but probably only if someone else decides they want to come."
