Jvp A.,"Linda Vista, San Diego, CA",5,36,5,4.0,4/22/2014,"Jambalaya pasta and miso salmon with brown rice, Yummmmm. I never found any other place who makes miso salmon, its a must try."
Paulina S.,"Riverside, CA",2,11,,5.0,7/24/2015,"Our server, Aaron M (name based of receipt), was phenomenal. We recently moved to LA from Chicago and were in the area so decided to stop in for dinner. I have never received such exceptional service. He was very attentive; stopped by our table frequently even though it was very busy. Service like this should be recognized. Amazing!"
Kap K.,"La Jolla, CA",9,19,2,1.0,5/24/2013,"Well after a long day of running around town doing errands, we found ourselves at fashion valley hungry and tired. We were not dressed to impress, maybe that is we weren't served but nonetheless we decided to go grab something decent to eat and decided on Cheesecake Factory.  We have visited other ones across the country but never this location.   It seemed similar to other locations, busy, lines, etc... We went in grabbed a buzzer and waited 15mins the buzzer went off.  Nothing unusual we were expecting to wait.  We were seated outside and that is when the real waiting began.  The hostess sat us down and said our server will be right with us, we are patient people so the first 20mins we sat quietly and patiently. After seeing other people who were sat after us get their food orders in we began to get a little irritated.  But we still remained calm even trying to get the attention of a couple serves who passed our table to no avail.  Mind you that we still did not get a glass of water nor our food orders taken.  We finally gave up 45mins in because we were sitting there being passed by servers, food runners, and other employees, etc.  All of them just looked at us and kept going.   Im not sure if it was the way we were dressed, think relaxed or gym shorts tee shirt.  But we were totally ignored.  We left and we will never come back.  There was no excuse to have us wait that long just to be acknowledged.  Maybe our skin was too dark, maybe we looked like we don't have money, maybe we were too young looking to tip well, whatever the case may be, Cheesecake Factory in San Diego you disappointed us to the point that I tell this story to everyone and anyone I come into contact with.  Not the experience I was expecting when other locations have done so well, very disappointed and let employees know of this when we left and not even an apology.  I'm not the type to make a scene or call for the manager but maybe I should be to get some kind of response from you all.   If you skip this location, you are not missing out. We had dinner somewhere else that night and it was great and the food was awesome, oh and they treated us like we were human beings and acknowledge our presence."
Desiree H.,"Chula Vista, CA",9,16,7,3.0,12/16/2014,"Usually this place is amazing , so many options to chose from . It's always busy and the wait is typically 30-45 minutes long . Long wait for the food too , but the bread and butter make up for it . However their wait for to go orders is ridiculous . I waited 20 minutes for fries , people before me were waiting up to 45 minutes and it wasn't even a busy day . If it was busy I'd understand but it wasn't so I think it's ridiculous."
Derek H.,"Imperial, MO",50,164,4,3.0,7/10/2013,"So, my wife and I were trying to avoid chains while on our vacation, but we wanted to do some shopping and ended up at the nearby Fashion Valley Mall.  This is a huge outdoor mall, with just about every store you can imagine inside.  As with most malls, there weren't many dining options other than chains, and my wife and I were hungry so we settled on The Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant was fairly crowded, considering it was lunchtime on a Monday afternoon.  We were greeted by two servers, one trainee and a trainer.  My wife and I both ordered sandwiches, I opted for the club, while I believe my wife ordered a type of chicken sandwich.  The sandwiches were fine.  Nothing spectacular, but they were fine.  About what your would expect at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was way more food than both of us could eat.  Dessert looked great, and there are obviously a ton of choices, but we just didn't have room for it.  Maybe we should come here just for dessert sometime.  I think I might like that better.  :) Overall, our lunch was fine.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're at the mall it's a convenient place to eat.  Unless of course you'd prefer the food court type of options."
Maryland M.,"San Diego, CA",1,31,19,3.0,4/28/2014,"I go here once every couple of months and I feel like every time I go my experience is worse than the time before. The servers/waiters are nice enough, but man does the kitchen screw up orders.  Three visits ago I came with two dining companions and our order took 45 minutes  to come out from the time we ordered.  Two visits ago the waitress spilled my dinner all over our table (I get it I'm a klutz too, shizza happens), but my replacement didn't come until my dining companion had finished eating. Lame.  Yesterday we ordered a simple app that took 20 minutes to get out to us. Then they screwed up my dinner (I asked for a veggie patty and they gave me meat, they did realize before sending it out though). We waited another 30 minutes for that to be remade. I'm pretty sure My Dining companions pasta had sat under the warming light while the remade my order because some of the noodles were rock hard. And as a waiter dropped off our food he mentioned there was blue plastic from one of those frilled toothpicks IN HIS PASTA. Lovely. The cheesecake I ordered came out missing a large chunk in the back as well. They screwed up the order of people dining next to us. I think I'm ready to try True Food or PF changes next time I want a meal in Fashion Valley...."
Anna L.,"San Diego, CA",192,158,5,3.0,12/11/2013,"I should preface this by saying: we are not Cheesecake Factory people.  My boyfriend received $45 worth of gift cards as a stocking stuffer at his work.  Having no other plans for the evening, we headed down to Fashion Valley (despite my concerns about the mall holiday crowd.) As it turned out, the wait was less than 10 minutes, which was a first for any of my prior experiences at this location. Our server was Robin, and she had a very full section as we arrived. How busy she was did not stop her from kindly greeting us and offering drinks. My boyfriend pointed out that the table had some crumbs, which our server sent a busboy to take care of speedily, even replacing his silverware. I scanned the menu for things that looked tasty, finally landing on the Chicken Madeira.  Every ingredient is one that I favor, including perfectly crunchy asparagus, marinated mushrooms, melted mozzarella, and a rich wine and peppercorn gravy atop the chicken, with a heaping side of mashed potatoes. My bf went for the Chicken and Biscuits, which was lightly seasoned sliced chicken, beside mashed potatoes, a mixture of mushrooms, carrots, peas, and onions, topped with a splash of gravy and a fluffy biscuit.  He wasn't crazy about much, other than the biscuit, so i gave him half of my chicken.   After dinner, since we were using gift cards, we checked out the cheesecake menu.  Bf was set on the key lime cheesecake, where I was leaning more toward the pumpkin pecan, so we got both, in addition to two coffees.  Robin, actually, was really excited that I was trying the pumpkin pecan, and noted that once it ran out, there would be no more until next October.  I gotta tell ya, it was pretty terrific.  I'm not that big on desserts, but pecan pie is a weakness.  The combo of pumpkin cheesecake and pecan pie were... a seriously holy matrimony.  So delicious.  Unable to finish the gargantuan slices, we packed the remaining dessert to go, as the server dropped our check. Our server, Robin, was  so on top of everything.  We never wanted for water, a friendly (but not over-attentive) check-in, or a smile.  She seriously rocked the house, and I would absolutely love to have her as as server again (I even got the bf to leave her a bigger tip than he had originally intended- not because he wasn't happy, but that he's not in the service industry, and I'm still trying to train him how to leave a proper gratuity.)  Completely unrelated to our service (which was, again, outstanding) my boyfriend was up all night, with stomach cramps from his food.  He's not that sensitive, so something had to have been off.  I, however, was fine... so that brings it down to the Chicken and Biscuits as the culprit.  That, unfortunately, is why this is 3 stars.  I don't expect much from chain restaurants, usually, but I at least expect myself or my dining companions to return home in good health."
Nancy B.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",7,159,261,4.0,4/10/2015,I love to go here and sit outside. It is much quieter. They redid the patio and it's like a little sanctuary now. No matter what you order you can easily split it. The portions are huge. My favorites are the Thai lettuce wraps and the chicken piccata.
Ashley C.,"San Diego, CA",44,85,34,1.0,10/19/2013,"There isn't much to review about...bc we waited 17 minutes and were never approached at our table..plenty of servers walked by unaware that we weren't greeted. I'm a server myself and to not be greeted for more than 10 minutes is inexcusable. You need to be aware of your surroundings and not only focus on your own tables/sections but make sure your aware of what's going on around you.  My bf was absolutely pissed and also hungry (not a good mix) so he got up and left. I spoke with Sean the manager & although he was apologetic it didn't make up for our hungry tummies & left a bad taste in our mouth..  Ultimately, we won't be returning...to this location at least."
Nina S.,"Pomona, CA",476,273,245,2.0,4/17/2011,"I came here at a good time I guess. We didn't have to wait in line. I went with a small group of friends. Our waitress was nice and friendly. The food however.. pretty decent. I've been here a few times. None of the food here so far really made me want more. The first thing I've ordered (I forgot what it was called) but it had grilled chicken, that was pretty tasty. Then another chicken dish we ordered was a bit too buttery. It was hard to chow down because it was literally too much butter.  Sure the food is filling but it's not that good. It being the Cheesecake Factory, I was hoping their cheesecake was good at least but it was just alright :("
Erin Z.,"San Diego, CA",78,91,8,5.0,3/5/2015,So. Many. Choices.  I was a little overwhelmed but ended up getting the eggplant parm.  So good!  The roasted artichoke with garlic aioli was for sure the highlight of the meal. Can't wait to go back and try something else!
Anuh-mai T.,"San Diego, CA",58,42,25,4.0,4/1/2015,"This place is always so busy, but to me It's worth the wait. My favorites are there appetizers, the avocado egg roll and calamari. Main dish I love the pastas and of course dessert!!!"
Alan T.,"San Diego, CA",20,7,,4.0,5/8/2013,"How can any restaurant have over 200 selections made fresh every day? Well, the Cheesecake Factory does. I've been going to this place every now and then for years. I always have trouble deciding what to order because there are so many things I'd like to try. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes are great as an appetizer. I prefer to share that with a friend in order to leave room for other items. I also enjoy the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich - a full meal by itself. And, of course, the variety of cheesecakes is amazing. I like getting a slice and then try not to think about the caloric content so I can savor it without much guilt. Once in a while it's ok to just let go, especially when the treat is worthwhile.   The place is a bit noisy and invariably there's been a long wait - of at least 20 minutes - every time I've gone there. So, patience is needed. However, the food experience is consistently good, and that's the reason I keep coming back."
Jonathan L.,"San Diego, CA",1,11,27,4.0,5/10/2015,"Been here multiple times now, and I've enjoyed myself each time. The building itself is pleasant to look at and the fact that it's right next to one of the fancier malls in San Diego helps. However, parking can be a little arduous on weekends and holidays. Service runs smoothly - but it can get pretty busy, so don't be surprised if you need to wait a little bit for your food to arrive. The menu is quite large and caters to many different tastes, whether you want pizza, seafood, pasta, or even steak. The dessert/chesecake menu is just as varied as the main options, which is always a good thing. However, quality does come with a price; be prepared to spend a little bit of money if you go the appetizer, main course, dessert route. Overall, this place is very enjoyable and I'll definitely be coming around again."
Vi N.,"San Diego, CA",128,9,5,1.0,3/17/2013,"Someone please enlighten me because I  can not understand how this place manages to have 3.5 stars. You're paying Benecotto/Cucina Urbana prices (both 4+ stars on yelp) for Olive Garden (and possibly even Chef Boyardee) quality food. Hell, you can go to Cucina Charisma in Hillcrest (4.5stars) and pay a fraction of the price. I JUST DON'T GET IT! I mean, I know this is the Cheesecake Factory, and that it's a chain, but I do expect some minimal level of edibility.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (with grilled chicken instead of breaded) to go via curb side pick up. This review will deconstruct the dish and elaborate on everything thing wrong with it and possibly this establishment in general.  First, the chicken was burnt. No, I apologize, it wasn't merely burnt, it was BUUURRRRNNNTTT.  As such, the chicken breast bore more semblance to burnt hamburger patties than it did to chicken. Also, usually when one properly cooks chicken, you let it rest before tampering with, so to ensure that the flavor doesn't drain from the meat. I don't think the cooks adhered to this. Instead, I believed they butchered that chicken breast immediate, without giving it the chance to sit. I mean, this is something so elementary that a chef (or amateur home cook) should know about.  Consequently, the meat itself was dry. Furthermore, the dry and nasty-ness of the chicken breast was exacerbated by the fact that the burnt outside gave the breast a gritty, bitter taste. Second, the pasta was bland. I've recreated a similar dish at home, so I know the potential it has. Anyway, back to the blandness. As a ""southern"" dish, I was expecting more bold flavors - you know, some thyme, cumin, paprika, cayenne, parsley, all that good stuff. Instead, what I got was bowtie pasta with minimal butter and maybe some cream. In order to salvage the dish, I decided to salt and pepper the life out of the dish, but to no avail. It's likely that all the salt they used to de-ice DC after the snowstorm would not have been sufficient to salvage this dish.  Third, there was no red or yellow bell peppers as the menu suggested. I'm sure the addition of such ingredients would have helped with the blandness problem.  Fourth, doesn't anyway find their menu tacky. Why are there advertisements?  Anyway, needless to say, after two bites (one of the chicken and one of the pasta), I threw it away. What a waste of $20 dollars ($18 for the dish and $2 tip I gave to the curb side pick up girl)!   The management really needs to more closely inspect the quality of food they are serving. Basic skills are obviously lacking (i.e., taste the food you're putting out to see if it's properly season, look at the protein to see if it actually resembles what you're trying to serve, etc.)"
Sandi F.,"Oceanside, CA",33,62,7,3.0,2/17/2012,"I've been here a few times, but most recently with my sister and nephew for a late lunch before taking her to the airport. I was really excited to order the Fried Macaroni & Cheese because I've had it before and LOVED it... however that was the only thing we ordered that was good. We both ordered a drink ($13 each for a tiny martini!) and I got the Crusted Chicken Romano, she ordered the Pasta Carbonara, both off the lunch menu which has smaller portions. Both were VERY bland and lukewarm... I would rather have had the grilled cheese we ordered for my nephew off the kids menu. We both had just a couple bites of our meal and let them take our almost full plates away. The Fried Macaroni & Cheese was delicious and filled with steaming hot gooey cheese... yummy!! I should just have just ate that and skipped the pasta. I do have to say that the staff was all very friendly and nice... especially considering we had a 1 year old who littered the floor with tiny peices of his grilled cheese sandwich. I'll be back... but only to get my fix of Fried Mac & Cheese!"
Dimple B.,"San Diego, CA",88,205,348,5.0,9/9/2013,"On a Saturday for date night, my boyfriend and I weren't too surprised that the wait would be around 45 minutes to an hour. But I really wanted to try this place out, so we stayed. We decided to check out the bar to get a drink and maybe an appetizer while we waited, and instead of doing that, we were approached by a waiter passing by. He asked if we were there for dinner, and then he seated us right in front of the bar at a high table - not a great spot if you're with a large group or kids, but perfect for just 2 - and the rest of the experience was excellent! Pros: Great food and drinks. We had the passionfruit mojito and whiskey sour, both yummy. Our waiter was very funny and helpful in our indecision for ordering. BF and I both got chicken dishes which were great in portions, with delicious mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. We had to take a breather for ordering cheesecake, but when it did come, BF's Oreo and my Kahlua slices were perfection. Cons: Long wait, but that's to be expected at the location (at a mall)."
David H.,"Chula Vista, CA",169,100,18,3.0,10/19/2011,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I like the food, i love the cheesecake, but the price is warranted, but over hyped.  Yes you get giant portions on most food, but i'm not all that satisfied with the menu.  Speaking about the menu, the actual menu... what is that a menu or a magazine?  It has so many pages and so many advertisements.  its ridiculous!  Also, if you wanna go there make reservations and if you make reservations, still expect to wait about 45 minutes.  The Eastlake location seems to be less crowded, the Fashion Valley one is crazy dumb!   Oh yeah and if the fight of the night is on and 15 people request it to the manager and the manager rather watch ESPN recap show, and says ""Sorry pal, this isn't a sports bar.""  Well expect my answer to be , ""Well pal, maybe take the TV's down or change the channel to the Lifetime network.""  Thats what I said, people got a laugh he didn't."
Q T.,"Del Mar, CA",4,133,41,2.0,11/9/2013,Under quoting the wait time is a big no no. Saying 45 minutes is fine but make it 45 minutes wait or less. Not an hour and 10 minutes.  Food was ok but not worth an hour wait. Took 10 minutes to get water and a coke but the vodka rocks came out first... Hm... Shoulda gone to BJs across the freeway!
Adeile A.,"San Diego, CA",448,202,11,4.0,4/19/2013,I absolutely LOVE this place. I love that they have a SKINNYLICIOUS menu...  Although the wait can be herendous... it is well worth the wait.  I have gone there 2x in one month and I enjoyed each of my experiences.  The waiter/ress' were very friendly and very attentitive.  I love the atmosphere of this place and although the seating can be a little cramped I'm ok with it.  MY FAVE: Mexican Tortilla Chicken Salad... SKINNYLICIOUS w/ some cilantro puree to with it. I can eat this every day!!! I recommend getting the crab bites... small or big... because they are delicious as well.  Since I have been on my healthier kick I stick to the salad... although one day I am going to break out of that stage and dig right in. I would also recommend:  The Bellagio Chicken Marsala Asian Chicken Salad (no the chopped) SKINNYLICIOUS BUFFALO BLASTS Avacado Egg Rolls I really love it here!! The cheesecakes are amazing.  My fav is the Macadamian nut one... and I had the banana cream one and that was good as well. I'm a cheesecake fanatic so as long as there are no peanuts or caramel in it... I'm down!! LOL
