Stacey E.,"Escondido, CA",314,104,38,4.0,3/9/2013,"OMG!!! How can you not like the Cheesecake Factory? The food is delicious and huge! The cheesecake is always amazing. This is usually my first choice to come for birthday celebrations, and I always leave WAY too full. My favorite dish is the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. I don't care for fettuccini, but they always let me replace angel hair pasta instead. Nom nom nom!  My fiancé loves the jambalaya and always leaves with a stomach ache (he tries to not eat it all but he can't help himself).  The smartest thing you can do here is eat half your entree and save the other half for later (if you can). Then enjoy a piece of cheesecake. If you try to eat everything AND have dessert you will need to lay down for awhile. I took off one star only because they are always packed and the wait can sometimes be long. That and I have never gotten to sit in a booth (also because they are always busy). I usually end up at one of those little tables that are about a foot from the neighbors. I guess I could wait for a booth, but that would up the wait time even longer, and when I come here I don't want to wait! It's that good!"
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,4.0,8/6/2011,"It took me a few tries, but now I love Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish is the Tomato Bail Pasta. It's always done perfectly and it's very light and fresh. Grant, my waiter, recommended it to me and thank goodness I listened! He was a great waiter in general and made us laugh a lot. My favorite dessert is the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake...it's a must! I've tried almost all of the cheesecakes because I love dessert, but that one by far is my favorite. Ask for Grant and I promise your experience will be that much greater!"
Joseph M.,"San Diego, CA",665,13,5,5.0,9/4/2013,Went here for a birthday dinner over with a party over 10. The wait was about an hour due to it being labor day weekend and dinner time. So we went shopping at the mall in the meantime.  This Cheesecake Factory has a very beautiful exterior and interior. I ordered a filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly and had wonderful texture and flavor. The cheesecakes I tried were amazing as well. The service was great also. Our friendly waiter came by every few minutes to refill our waters and made sure we were fine. This place was a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for. Delicious food and amazing service were worth the 5 stars.
Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",357,49,45,4.0,12/4/2013,"The only reason i would come here is for the Da Vinci Pasta. it is to die for. those mushrooms, that sauce, al dente pasta... can't get enough. large portions, too. YES PLEASE, THANK YOU. oh, and that dark brown bread is alright. $16 for pasta? but it's so good. ): must. justify. somehow. service is OK, price is MEH, it's pretty chilly in here, and way too packed most of the time. but that Da Vinci Pasta. Oh man."
Emily S.,"San Diego, CA",26,115,95,4.0,1/31/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty solid for a chain restaurant.  I don't go here that often, but when I do, I am rarely disappointed.  There is usually always a wait so just prepare for that.  Also, it is kind of pricey, but the portions are very generous.  This is not the place to go if you are on a diet.  I like the atmosphere here, inside usually has dim lighting which gives it a cozy feel.  What I like about Cheesecake Factory is the consistency of quality and taste every time.   One of my favorite apps are the crab & cream cheese wontons.  For entrée options, I love the French country salad or the Kobe burger with added blue cheese.  My boyfriend loves the shrimp scampi that comes with huge shrimps.  As for cheesecake, I have only had it from here a couple times... I usually don't have any room left after dinner!   When you and your man can't decide or agree on where to eat, go here because there's lots to choose from. :)"
aida s.,"Modesto, CA",34,11,,5.0,4/8/2015,"Had Chris' outrageous cheesecake. It was awesome.  Our server, Ramiro, was outstanding."
Lynne Marie Raguindin B.,"Los Gatos, CA",51,542,578,5.0,1/1/2014,"I think our server's name was Chris. But, he was awesome. He really gave us great attention even with the mishaps of our food due to the kitchen. I know we were far from the kitchen but didn't hesitate at all to get us what we needed. As always the buffalo blasts an miso salmon were delicious!"
Annika G.,"Santee, CA",9,33,,5.0,11/28/2013,"Love it! Huge portions, amazingly delicious food. Don't go here if you're looking to cut calories. They have something for everyone else, though. I love their pastas!"
Mary H.,"Alameda, CA",1,18,,3.0,4/26/2015,"We met friends here for dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Our server was excellent, the drinks were tasty and the food delicious.  My husband and I ended up being very late for our reservation, as we are from out of town and got lost.  Our friends were seated right on time.  The cheerful server kept their drink orders coming.  When we *finally* did arrive, she told us to take our time looking at the menu, even though there was a wait to get in and it was getting close to closing time.  Overall, a very nice experience and we'll go back when we're in the area."
Patrick Z.,"Carlsbad, CA",265,289,40,3.0,3/11/2011,"I'm against chain restaurants categorically, so keep that in mind while reading this. My sister was in town from Ohio and apparently they don't have The Cheesecake Factory there and she HAS to go every time she comes to visit. I started off with one of my favorite beverages, the Blood Mary. It was decent when she brought it to the table, but I LOVES me some horseradish, so I asked for more. Our waiter looked at me a little awkwardly, but brought some over a minute or two later. In case you've never been here, the menu is freaking huge. I'm talking pizza, omelets, salads, meat of all sorts, pasta, sammiches, everything. I got a salad with seared ahi on it. It was decent. I have had better in my day, but have had WAY worse for sure. My mother and sister split and omelet and gave it high reviews. I don't remember what my father got, but I'm sure it was either pulled pork or meatloaf. That's all he ever orders.  After eating carefully to not fill themselves up, everyone ordered their own cheesecake. Me, I'm not a sweets guy, so I had another Bloody Buddy while they shoveled their cheesecake down their gullets. There was one with chocolate and peanut butter, one banana cream and one minty one. My family loved them. tl;dr: decent food from a chain restaurant."
Amanda B.,"Calabasas, CA",180,674,3510,5.0,12/19/2011,"Cheesecake Facotry is excellent. Do not order appetizers if you plan on getting cheesecake and can not take it to go.  App wise- the Buffalo Blasters sound dumb but they are amazing! The free bread is great. I have never been dissapointed in this place. Cheesecake wise- I enjoy the craig's carrot cheesecake and hershey choco cheesecake. The bar drinks are pricey as hell. Have your man foot the bill.  This particular location has a back lot with to go parking as well. If you are patient you will get a spot and a table. It is always busy so we sit at the bar sometimes (which has a small TV) and always take a couple things home for the next day. Oh, and if you are lucky enough to get Margaret as your server she is very calm and on top of things."
Kerra A.,"San Diego, CA",1756,495,588,3.0,2/1/2011,"Took tha hubby here for his tenth 21st birthday...went here on a Sunday around 8pm for some good din din. It was our first time ever to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, so we were pretty stoked. Since it was just the 2 of us (my awesome bro & tha wifee watched our kiddies so we can have some QT), our wait time was 5 minutes.   -1 Star: The girl that walked us to the table left us. Tha hubster was on crutches and she didn't bother to slow down or look behind her to see where we were at -1 Star: The prices were ridiculous. But it was tha Hubsters bday =) But any other day, we'd prolly be at Taco Bell +1 Star: pretty big menu...from Asian, American, Italian...etc..a very good variety of good eats to pick from +1 Star: our waitress Robyn was fast, friendly and funny +1 Star: the food was good, portions big, and Cheesecake was bomb What we ate: Appetizer - Tex Mex Rolls $9.95, pretty big tasty rolls..and the wrapper was crispy juz tha way i like it Ribby Eye Steak dinner for tha hubby $29.95, the steak was HUGE! came with french fries and two onion rings. The onion rings weren't all that great....so good thing there was only two. Caramel Chicken (Vietnamese) $12.95, it kinda tasted like orange chicken with a ginger twist and with some stir fry veggies. once again the portion was HUGE! and you have the option of regular white rice or brown rice. I got tha brown rice. Cheesecake $7.75 each slice: (all I gotta say is yummm! and they both came with real whipped cream. Very rich...one slice can prolly feed four people) Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake Hubby also had a coffee ($2.95) to reduce a major food coma. We also had the outside patio seating, which would have been romantic...BUT we were seated by the window and we could see the people that were dining inside...it was like we were sitting WITH them...but just couldn't talk because the window barrier.  It was pretty cold, but they had those heat lampy thingy's outside...so the weather didn't bother us at all."
Daniel B.,"San Diego, CA",3,95,5,2.0,7/25/2015,"I did it again... I went back.. after shopping at the Mall I was hungry.. we ordered, Calamari, ahi carpaccio with Togararash Aioli,, Imperial Chicken and shrimp, Parmesan crusted chicken and shrimp scampi with Italian sausage.  The calamari was falling apart! under cooked and the sauce was not a match to the dish.  Tuna salad was fine.. to much aioli sauce.. the imperial chicken was sweet.. so sweet.. too sweet.  The Parmesan chicken was fine.. to too little portion.. not normal for this place.  and the pasta scampi was super sour.. WTF.. it was supposed to be a special order.. they added 9 dollars just to add 5 pieces of sausage.  NEVER NEVER listen to the waiters suggestion to go off menu/  he kept saying "" I can make anything you want.. ""  from 16.99 to 25.99 and it sucked.  Waste again.. total bill 123.59 with drinks and two slices of pie.  I think I have dropped 500 at this crap hole this year!  Why Why Why??  Never again.!! I swear!"
Fr P.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,3.0,5/19/2015,"I really, really don't like chains.  Or waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table.  But when someone gives you a giftcard, you're gonna use it.  You won't get as much here for $50 as you would expect, but when you finally get the food, it's pretty good.  I just won't come back by choice, because I hate waiting and I always think it's better to hit mom and pop places--let's support our locals."
Julia S.,"La Jolla, CA",377,426,211,4.0,5/20/2011,"Hot Chocolate!!!! Nothing else, but Hot Chocolate!  However my friends prefer much developed menu: appetizers, salad, glass of wine with a desert. But who says I can't bypass all and dive right into a source of indulgence!  It's a great place for late night meetings with friends."
Tony T.,"San Diego, CA",3,13,27,2.0,3/22/2015,Dropped off my girl friend to reserve a spot while I parked. Found parking and walked there about 15 after she had checked in and was info there was about 15 more minutes wait which we anticipated then 15 goes by then came 30mins and we've been sitting at the bench waiting. Then I notice a couple that came in to be checked in goes up and gets a table. Of course you gotta think maybe they checked in and left and just returned but nope... Turns out they took spot next in line. I didn't know that until I walked up there and asked where we were in line because we've been waiting for awhile and they said we were already seated and pointed where the couple that came in and stole our spot. So I told them I did noticed that they just came in and got seated before us and the hostess apologized and said that happens all the time! Not a good excuse..but anyways what's done was done they got us a seat. Food was great except for my main course which was the California omelette with burnt fries! It really looked as if someone was too lazy to make fresh batch of fries since breakfast time was coming to an end so they just scooped the rejected burnt fries.. And I did post the picture! They apologized and ended up never bringing out new fries because I was about done with my meal when my waitress checked up and was surprised they still hadn't brought out the fries. I gave them them 2 stars only because the food was great and our waitress was great. Everything else was horrible.
Jim G.,"Biloxi, MS",0,76,,2.0,10/13/2014,Visited this weekend with my wife and child. Everything was going ok until the meals started to arrive my wife received her meal and then 5 minutes later my daughter received hers and for 15 minutes after my wife initially received hers my meal had still not arrived. I told the waitress to remove my meal off my bill that my family was almost done eating and I didn't  want it any longer. She left and the manger showed up very apologetic and offered us free cheesecake. I explained to him that when you go out to eat with your family that it would be nice to receive our dinners at the same time.  Probably won't go back with this kind of service.
Piper S.,"Winchester, CA",41,84,94,1.0,7/31/2014,"Took my sister here for her birthday dinner. I called ahead to see what the wait time was because this location always seems so busy. I was told there was a 30 minute wait. When we got there it was very packed. I thought maybe I heard the hostess wrong and maybe I miss heard her and it was an hour and half wait. Nope it was only about a 45 minute of a wait. When I signed us in I made sure to tell them that we were celebrating my sisters birthday.  Once seated we ordered drinks and appetizers. We ordered the wings and fried mac n cheese balls with marinara. My husband said the wings were spicy hot and very vinegary. The mac n cheese balls were very good, these are a definite must to try when you come here.  We then ordered 4 entrees, Orange Chicken, Chicken n Biscuits, Steak Diane. The servings were huge. The Chicken n Biscuits were not that great, it was served with a side of seasonal vegetables they were the highlight of my meal. The chicken was dry I ordered an extra side of gray just to add moisture to it. We then ordered 4 pieces of cheesecake all of which were delicious.  Now here is why I gave the 1 star. I made sure to tell them it was a birthday dinner when I arrived and checked in. My sister was here visiting for work so I made the 60 mile drive to where she was working to take her to a nice dinner for her birthday. When I checked in and told them this, they told me they would let the server know. After we ordered our drinks I caught up with our server to reiterate the fact that we were celebrating a birthday she gave the nod and was like okay.  After the completion of our meal our server comes to our table with a candle and a lighter and there the 5 of us are singing happy birthday so pathetically to my sister, mind you while all around us there were groups of servers singing lively to patrons Happy Birthday. I was beyond pissed. After paying $175.00 with tip on a dinner for 4. The server couldn't even gather 5 servers, busboys, hostesses or dishwashers to sing happy birthday. I will not be back to this location."
Frank D.,"San Diego, CA",234,302,323,4.0,11/26/2011,"DONT even think of going here hungry on a Saturday night. Plan on a 45 min wait (minimum)! Parking can be horrific during the holidays and the wait really sucks.  Did i mention waiting around for an hour sucks? So what keeps me coming back? Their food is actually delicious and i have never seen such a variety of cheesecake flavors anywhere before. There is even a sugar free ""Splenda"" cheesecake/diabetic friendly which tastes pretty good.  Mike at the bar is awesome, super cool football fan/bartender and great drink selection. Ask Mike at the bar for a drink and he can make/create just about anything!"
Nancy T.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",3,12,7,4.0,3/19/2015,I go to Cheesecake Factory a lot and I actually really enjoy their food. They have a variety of food to choose from! I love how they organized their menu. Makes it much easier for you! I usually get their baja chicken tacos and it is sooo good! My boyfriend and friends loves the hibachi steak The reason why I'm giving it 4 out 5 because is I went to Cheesecake Factory last night with a friend and I got my usual baja chicken tacos and it did not taste the same at all. It was so bland. I was super disappointed. The  server politely told me that they changed the recipe because some people were complaining that it was too spicy.. But that's not gonna stop me from coming here. I still love their food and service.
