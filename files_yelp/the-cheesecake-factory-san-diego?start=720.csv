Shirley Wing L.,"San Diego, CA",133,331,150,4.0,3/16/2013,"Jonas was amazing. LOL but i only tipped him $3. Sorry Jonas. BUT! my two friends tipped him $4 each. Hopefully you guys will bump into him, such a wonderful waiter. taste: ordered bistro shrimp pasta for $16.95? --this is my fav dish here. because theres an excessive amount of shrimp and the taste is super savory!  portion: pretty big hence the priceyness. i usually take home about half the plate. the only down part of taking home the plate is the amount of oil you will see lying at the bottom of the box. yep, blood vessels clogged. we were seated after 40 mins. terrible wait on friday nights. DONT GO FRIDAY NIGHTS! and we were seated outside. the heat lamps work pretty well but i felt like my face was melting off.. also had the strawberry lemonade which tastes GREAT! BUT SUPER SOUR! :( so usually i add SALT to balance out the taste. (: works like a charm every time. if it wasnt for the wait and priceyness, i would come here more often (:"
Aki K.,"Sydney, Australia",1,57,,4.0,10/22/2013,"This place is great, every time I come here the food is delicious and the staff is friendly. Even though the food is divine sometimes I want to just come and eat a bunch of yummy dessert lol.  Huge menu with lots of delicious choices!"
Ashley V.,"San Gabriel, CA",198,228,148,4.0,12/8/2012,"Try to come here right before the dinner rush, because it can get packed and you might have to wait a while to be seated.  When I went, it was around 5pm, and our party (party of 5...hehe) was seated immediately.  Our server was very helpful in suggesting things and explaining different dishes. If you're coming here on a budget, try to go for the small plates. Choose 2 different things, and you'll be set. I got Greek salad, which was okay. I was expecting more salad greens on my plate, but it was mostly just tomatoes and cucumbers. I also got the Crab and Artichoke dip, which was actually really good! It was a perfect blend of flavors. It came with some sliced bread for dipping. Parking can be a bit of hassle, especially since this location is located at the Fashion Valley mall."
Clayton B.,"Oceanside, CA",138,297,63,1.0,7/7/2013,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories and this was by far, hands down, the single worst one I've ever been to.  The wait wasn't too bad, it took my date and I about 10 minutes to get seated. Unfortunately, it was right next to the service station and hearing all the chatty servers gossiping and complaining was a bit annoying. The menu is huge and our server gave us quite a while to go through it and decide but he checked up on us once in 20 minutes to the point where I had to get up and walk to find the guy to come back to our table. It usually takes a little bit to get my food but I've never waited 50 minutes before... Then to make things worse, we told the guy we were going to watch a movie and wanted our check ASAP. He took his time and didn't get it to us for about 15 minutes. As he was taking our food away, he tilted the plate too far to the side and dumped red sauce all over my date's skirt... yyeeaaa, it was white and black. Was not very excited about that. Our bill was $38 but then we realize he gave us a check for another table that was $95. At this point we called the manager over and explained everything that was wrong about our experience. She fixed it on the spot and surprisingly didn't comp anything for such a bad experience. Needless to say, that guy got no tip and we will NOT be returning to this place again. I recommend taking your business to another establishment that will truly care about you."
Tanya V.,"San Diego, CA",61,26,59,5.0,4/30/2014,"I swear Cheesecake Factory never disappoints me. I always sit outside if its during lunch or dinner. The staff are so friendly and you can tell they are well trained. I went here just a few days ago for lunch and i decided to order the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It was soooooo good and the portions are always big at the cheesecake factory. I always have a box to-go for my leftovers haha. My fettuccine alfredo dish was about $18 and my friend's dish was $19 for a salmon dish. Of course i always like to give a good tip too because of excellent service. I will come back to this place over and over again, especially with friends and family that love this place too."
Ayra R.,"San Diego, CA",307,20,5,5.0,1/3/2016,Great service and the waiters are chill af lmao one thing is that it's hella busy so sometimes I have to wait in line for like twenty minutes or something like that but it's all good in the hood because the food is great. I got the chicken bellagio which was bomb af and it was so big so I didn't finish it but I had leftovers for the next day
Shirzad F.,"San Diego, CA",116,91,27,5.0,7/5/2013,"Once the wait is over and you're seated, you're presented with a menu that has so many options. I've been going to Cheesecake factory for a few years now and have seldom had a dish that I didn't like (I'm talking about you crispy fried beef).   You quickly learn that even though the appetizers are delicious, and the main entrée can actually be finished in one sitting (not recommended), you should always save room for cheesecake. So, last night we shared an appetizer between 3 people, we ate only half of our entrees and were able to enjoy cheesecake. Now, we have  awesome leftovers for tomorrow  We had the avocado roll appetizers, I had the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus and finally my wife & I shared a Kahlua Cocoa, coffee cheesecake. Lip smacking good! Even though they were working on 4th of July, the staff were very nice. Our server was Alyssa and she was very attentive."
Autumn J.,"San Diego, CA",14,2,1,5.0,2/15/2016,"I went through here and read all of the bad reviews and I will admit I was kind of skeptical about going, but I am SO glad we did! My husband and I decided to go for Valentine's Day because who doesn't love a big slice of cheesecake on Valentine's Day?! But I will say the wait sucked, I think every couple in San Diego was there as to be expected on this holiday. After about an hour (yes, an hour. But when I say it was packed I mean it was PACKED)  our buzzer went off we were seated right away! We had to wait a little bit for our food to be expected when they are cooking for so many people, and our waiter was very polite and offered many apologies for our wait as well as the manager coming to our table to apologize and offer and appetizer, more bread, etc. We kindly declined anticipating our food! The food is pricy, but well worth it. We both left satisfied with left overs and yummy cheesecake in hand! But I will say if you don't like to wait don't go on a weekend ora holiday, because it is a very popular place and it will definitely be busy lol We don't mind, but I know others do! We will definitely be coming back!"
Nicole H.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,90,226,3.0,12/16/2014,"2 STARS because: I've literally never received better service than I did at this Cheesecake factory location... I don't remember the waiters name but he was so nice, attentive, super knowledgeable of the menu, and accommodating. oh& the Cheesecake was rich and yummy, as always. 1 extra STAR because: The indoor and outdoor seating is always really nice. I love going specifically because of the ambiance, especially outdoors at night.  MINUS 1 STAR: The steak I ordered was not great; pretty much any other restaurant that I have ordered a steak from has been better.  MINUS 1 STAR: Our appetizers came out right when our entrees came. Why would I order an appetizer then? C'mon, the whole point is to eat the appetizer while you wait for your entrée. (Server took the appetizer off the bill when he saw we told him the problem)"
Andrew F.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,,4.0,2/28/2016,I am totally a fan.  The bartender on Wednesday nights makes stiff drinks.  The ease of ordering to-go is a big plus!
Rachel E.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",83,49,9,2.0,2/11/2013,"We went to The Cheesecake Factory on Sunday because we had a $50 gift card.  We've been here before several times, but probably wouldn't have gone back if it wasn't for the gift card. PROS:  The cheesecake is good, and apparently they make a really good burger. The service is decent and helpful. CONS:  Parking at Fashion Valley for a Sunday Lunch is a PAIN.   There is a lot of waiting in order to get to the table part of the experience.   There are TONS of people.  Don't go if you don't like crowds. The décor is something I try not to look at. If you're an indecisive person, it will take you 20 minutes to decide what to get off their extensive menu. The drinks are overpriced. ---------------------------------------------- ENVIRONMENT & SERVICE: It's a chore to get into Cheesecake Factory for lunch on the weekend.  It was just 2 of us, so our wait was about 20 minutes.  We scored bar seats, and could have ordered our food right there, but decided to get a drink and wait for a table.  Our total was $17 and some change (not including tip), which I think is steep for the cheapest glass of pinot noir on the menu and a Stone IPA.  We knew from prior experience not to waste our time with the mixed drinks - it's a minimum $10 per drink and always a stingy pour. You know that feeling when you've been waiting for a table, and you're hungry, and you're a bit miffed because you just put down a $20 bill for a beer & a glass of wine, and then that little indicator starts lighting up and you know it's your turn to sit down?  It's an exciting feeling, even for a little thing like that.  But at The Cheesecake Factory, there's no Sarah or Alison or Jennifer to greet you with a smile as you walk back to the foyer, saying ""right this way!""   Instead, there's a hostess fortress where they take your buzzer back, saying ""please wait over here for your name to be called.""  Wait a second, isn't that what I just did? Isn't that what the buzzer means?!?  Nope.  Not at the Cheesecake Factory.  I was just extracted from my comfy seat at the bar, and placed into the ""elite"" waiting pool, where I spent another 5 minutes crammed against the side of the wall, trying to stay out of the way of the servers running between the kitchen and the cheesecake counter, and suspiciously eyeing those around me to see who will make the second cut. Our server, thankfully, was attentive but not overbearing, not memorable but efficient, which is sometimes just what you want.  He recommended the burger, which was a good call, and boxed our leftovers up quickly, and didn't mind when we just sat for a little while trying to digest the mess in our stomachs after we paid. THE FOOD: There's bread to start (the brown squaw bread is great!), but with cold butter patties, which is always something that peeves Shawn Michael.  You can't spread cold butter.  I know this place is a ""factory"" of food, so they have to keep their butter cold during storage, and there's such a huge turnover of guests that it's likely unfeasible to thaw butter in accurate quantities to a spreadable consistency... but we both wish someone would try to figure it out.   We got the Buffalo Blasts- in all their creamy, savory, crispy glory.  This is what you think when you first bite into one, and by the second, you're thinking about how many calories are packed into one of the deep-fried pockets of gooey goodness.  Perhaps more frightening than the near-300 calories for each Blast is that each one is also loaded with over 1,000 mg of sodium... and we hadn't even arrived at the main course. Shawn Michael had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger, and I had the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  The Monte Cristo was just OK... The bread could have been crispier, and I hate it when all the insides are piled in the center of the sandwich- I shouldn't have to re-distribute the contents in order to have more than one good bite out of each sandwich wedge.  Shawn said his burger was REALLY good.  It made it to his top 10 list of San Diego Burgers, so that's saying something. And we had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake-this velvety, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth dessert does not disappoint.  We had it at our wedding, so that's saying something! CONCLUSION Even while I enjoyed (for the most part) my indulgent food episode, while I was savoring my last bite I said with a smile, ""Can we please never come here again?""  Perhaps it's the thousands of calories I ingest effortlessly, or the crowds and overpriced drinks... but it makes me feel a bit like I'm waiting in line for a fried Oreo at the fair. Now that I think of it, my reaction to the Cheesecake Factory is strikingly similar to my reaction to the San Diego County Fair.  However, I shouldn't think ""fair"" when I go to a restaurant. I guess the upside is that my experience has satisfied that bit of cultural longing; I might just skip the trip to Del Mar this June!"
Michael L.,"San Diego, CA",5,13,17,4.0,1/26/2015,"While good service and good dinner the appetizer ""Cuban rolls"" were less then desirable.  It may be just me but it seemed like minced meat inside of the roll... reminded me of bad Chinese egg rolls that have slop inside. would love to come back but eating a different app."
Kate G.,"Davenport, FL",111,305,123,4.0,6/23/2011,"A good friend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory last night to have a snack and a piece of cheesecake and drinks before going out.  The wait for a table was 45 minutes, so we opted to sit at the bar instead.  So this review is for the bar. The service at the bar was fabulous!  It was kept clean, and we were constantly being attended to.  I had an insanely delicious chocolate banana drink and my friend had the tropical martini.  Both drinks were amazing!  Very sweet and not mediciney, like a lot of alcoholic drinks tend to be.  We also ordered fries and those were brought out pretty quickly, and they were hot, just off the fryer.. they definitely hadn't been sitting too long.  The bartenders were great.  They constantly were coming up to us to ask if we needed anything, and they also kept our waters completely full.  We finished off the evening with cheesecake!  I went with the original, and it was delicious as always.  I know it's a chain, but the Cheesecake Factory really does have some incredible cheesecake.  The selection is huge, and all of it is really good. The only reason that I'm giving the Cheesecake Factory a 4 instead of a 5 is because the wait is just absolutely insane no matter what time you get there.. and while sitting at the bar was a fun experience, I would have preferred sitting at a booth.  We may have even ordered full meals in that case."
Aiza L.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,9,4.0,3/2/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite places to eat at period. I like how they have SO many food and dessert options to choose from. The food is usually prepared very well and their portions are large enough that you can usually share your food with someone else. I often get the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and for dessert the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I've had a bunch of their other cheesecakes but that one is probably my favorite. I also recommend the hershey's chocolate bar, red velvet, 30th anniversary, and the regular strawberry cheesecakes. But basically, all the cheesecakes I've tried so far have yet to disappoint. THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD. This place doesn't take reservations so if you come with a large party it's best to put your name down at LEAST 45 minutes ahead (especially since the place can get SUPER busy during peak hours). It's right next to the mall so there' s no problem with wondering what you'll do to pass the time. Lunch is always a good time to come because the crowd is never as busy as it is as night and parking is not really an issue."
Alexander Y.,"Rowland Heights, CA",507,721,1544,4.0,11/10/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is:  it's a chain restaurant that's overpriced for more or less mediocre food, but it has really damn good cheesecake.  And honestly, that's probably why I keep coming back, because very few places have the insane variety of ridiculously awesome cheesecake that they do.  If you accept that before you come here, then you'll enjoy your time here. That said, I hadn't actually been to the Mission Valley store, so I figured I'd give it a go to celebrate my friend's new job.  Already busy on a Wednesday night at 6 PM, but we were able to be seated outside with heated lamps in about 5 minutes. Normally I don't care much for decor since 90% of the rating I give to a review is based on the food.  But since I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing, I gotta say this particular store is designed with quite a bit of class.  If I hadn't been more concerned about sitting down faster because I was ridiculously hungry, I would've enjoyed sitting inside. Ended up choosing the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, which was pretty good.  Also had the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake (wanted to change it up from the undisputed best cheesecake they have, the White Raspberry Chocolate Truffle)...and I remembered why I bothered to still come here. Overall, it's good for what it is.  Nothing more than that."
Samantha S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,5,2,1.0,8/27/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory often I love the food and I love the cheesecake. Last night we went for a friends birthday I am so disappointed cause I have never gotten such bad waiter before in my life. First off she takes our drink orders she got two of them wrong. We asked for bread when she ordered our drinks and when the drinks arrived there was no bread. We had to ask her a few more times until she finally brought the bread out. Eventually our food arrives she can't remember what we ordered and put the wrong plates down in front of us. When she starts switching the plates she spilled one of our drinks. My friend never got a new one and she didn't even apologize. The food was delicious we were having a good time. She asked us if she wanted to split the checks we said yes but she walked away while we were telling her how to split them. One of my friends volunteered to cover my friends since it was her birthday. She came back with the checks my friend asked for the check that was my friends and the waitress responded with such attitude saying ""you didn't order that"" than after my friend said she was covering hers she threw both of the checks down in front of her and walked away. We also had to reminder her five times it was our friends birthday and if she could bring out the sundae. She wouldn't pick up the checks even though we kept saying excuse me whenever she walked by. Eventually we got up to walk to the front to see if someone could ring us up she stopped us than gave major attitude again. I don't think I will ever return to this Cheesecake Factory location again. If I do I will definitely get up and leave or ask for a different waiter if I ever get Alexis again. I have never been more disappointed with a restaurant."
Mikey P.,"La Jolla, CA",137,215,377,3.0,12/11/2010,"Ok... so there's Cheesecake Factories everywhere... TX and CA etc... The only reason I came here is cause my Vietnamese-German friend really loves this place... I guess she doesn't get it in Germany soooo yeah.. they love it haha It is very very pack.... There is a variety of different foods.... Parking sucks for dinner... The server kinda sucked...  The only thing I like was the bread and butter... sad yeah I know... But yeah, if you're from another country this is probably a cool place for you  Happy eating..."
Vince B.,"La Verne, CA",0,5,1,2.0,8/26/2016,"So just left this location with some Togo food.. Things started off great my wife and I sat at the bar were greeted immediately by a cheerful but nameless Bartender and served drinks. We got the crab wontons for a little appetizer which came out quick, hot, and delicious. Then the trouble begins we ordered entrees me a rib eye and my wife the pepperoni pizza rite as the wontons had arrived. Then we waited, waited, and then waited a while loner. After 30 minutes the bartender realizes we didn't have our food so he grabs a nearby server and asks ""hey can you grab a manager or something to get this Togo food"". Then we wait another 10 minutes finally the food comes with no comment from the bar team or manager presence. We get back to the hotel and of course here I am eating my over salted rib eye and Mac and cheese also extremely salty heated up in the microwave. With a nice side of ice cold pizza. If you want to spend $30 on cold salty steak this Cheesecake Factory is the place for you!"
Ruoyu L.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,1.0,2/12/2015,"horrible experience! taking sooooo long for the fried calamari because they said they need to defrost the calamari first  !!! We literally sat there for more than an hour for the order! I ordered angel hair pasta with shrimp, but it came with completely different pasta!!! The manager came and explained that it was because the pasta section has shut down!!! The bill was halved but I am still very very upset!!! Never come back again!!"
Jenna P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",84,48,33,3.0,1/18/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is very busy being that it is right next to the fashion valley mall. The service here however, is sub par. It takes forever to get your drinks and the waiters have too many people in their sections to come back and check on you. The food is good, just service needs improvement. As always the Cheesecake is bomb"
