Michael S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,15,,1.0,12/30/2015,"You expect a wait at TCF but, when your transponder beeps, you shouldn't have to wait and additional 15 minutes standing up in the middle of the restaurant dodging waiters while the busboy finishes wiping down your table top and placing set-ups, only to step in gross sticky mess underneath the table.  Don't go there if you have already bought movie tix and are facing a deadline, because food took 65 minutes for the first plate to arrive, and another ten minutes for the rest of the table to be served their food, which was cold and unappetizing.  For whatever reason(s), this location is not up to the franchise's already minimal standards--dirty, understaffed and sub-par experience all around."
Eric C.,"Yuma, AZ",23,8,11,5.0,1/16/2015,"Great food, good drinks and awesome atmosphere. Staff is very kind. Love the strawberry cheesecake and chicken carbonara pasta.... Look forward to returning... Very busy on Thursday and Fridays so I recommend you go early or go straight to the bar if it's crowed..."
Andy M.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,,4.0,2/6/2015,Had a great time coming here with my fiance. Great service and good food. And love the selection of cheesecakes.
Kelly C.,"San Diego, CA",347,299,712,5.0,9/15/2010,"LOVE LOVE LOVE cheesecake factory. I'm not a big fan of chains, but CF knows what they are doing.  I have been going to this location since they opened (10+ years ago) and it has always been great.  There are certain areas of the restaurant that are better and more conducive to good conversation (booths in the back with dividers, outdoor patio & the rotunda area).   I cannot live without AVOCADO EGG ROLLS.  I need them.  I get them *almost* every time I go.  My boyfriend knows this & orders them right when we sit down so I will calm down & be able to relax more when perusing the menu.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps are also really good if you don't want ""fried"". I love their menu selection and that they stand by all of their products.  When the server asks how everything is, they really care.  Last time I was there I got the wrong salad (I asked for it without a few ingredients) and I had the correct one in only a few minutes.   My favorites: Crispy Chicken Costoletta (make sure it has plenty of sauce), Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad, Crispy Spicy Beef.  My boyfriend LOVED his Wild Mushroom Burger and the fries were tasty too. Their cocktails are outrageously expensive (no prices on the menu), so I usually don't drink or just have 1 glass of wine. Cheesecake is amazing, of course.  Dulce de Leche, Tiramisu, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  (can you tell I have rich taste?) Anyone can love it at CF if they are prepared for the wait and the price (not cheap!)"
Jessica G.,"Wildomar, CA",94,50,96,5.0,12/27/2014,"Love, love, love this place! There isn't anything on the Menu that isn't good. My go to dish is the chicken Madeira with extra mushrooms and extra sauce. The wheat great dipped with a side of ranch is so good. Sometimes I just want to go there for the bread and ranch. Lol. Even though their cheesecake isn't made there, I love getting the ultimate cheesecake (red velvet) it's to die for."
Christina G.,"San Jose, CA",362,473,144,5.0,10/17/2013,"Thank you for making my cousin and his wife's 'honeymoon' dinner (ok, honeymoon 4 years later lol!!) special for them.  It took a while to get seated but once we were the service was very good, even though it was a new guy being trained.  Food was great as always, but the employees went above and beyond with the service and even made them a 'congrats' dessert.  Thank you!"
Diane T.,"Goleta, CA",732,111,259,4.0,3/25/2013,No happy hour! The Chula Vista location has happy hour specials though.  You're welcome.
Sharon L.,"San Diego, CA",230,711,199,3.0,11/26/2010,"I'm always a little embarrassed to come here. It transports me back to some fun but awkward high school dates. I've always wondered why the wait is so, so ridiculous. Maybe because there's a new generation of high school kids clogging the entrances? I tried the sweet corn tamale cakes. Initially, this dish confused me, as it resembled something that I grew up eating: fresh, steamed fish. There were two corn husks poking out from either end (hence the resemblance to fish fins). The cakes were topped with sour cream, avocado, salsa, and salsa verde. It was delicious in a shameful way. The cakes were sweet and moist and the toppings were fun to eat.  The firecracker salmon rolls were basically egg rolls. I was glad to see that the salmon was slightly undercooked. It was a good dish, but I liked the tamale cakes more. Dessert is always tempting; invariably, you end up regretting it in half an hour. Cheesecake with real whipped cream? Sold. Drinks were generic and boring. I stuck to my Stone Levitation."
Anna R.,"Sonoma, CA",37,57,111,3.0,10/5/2013,"the food is usually ok here. I got chicken picatta that came with a side of pasta. it was alright, not bad. the noise level is always loud! there's always tons of people coming so make reservations because sometimes the wait is short but not always. I would recommend this if you are unsure of what you're wanting, the menu is huge! but it's always overwhelming!"
Carla J.,"Ramona, CA",29,148,33,4.0,1/13/2013,"This was my first time at this resturant and their cheese cake is awesome, I had the Lemon Rasberry YUM!!!! Anywho picking up this cheese cake was very difficult. Adults and children alike were all over the place. One employee was standing there like they were completly lost in the madness.  I live in San Diego and we all know to avoid the mall area on the weekends if you want to keep your cool. I on the other hand have not been to the mall in a very long time so I had a major brain fart and took the fam to the mall with the tourists FML at the moment.  So the restuarant was packed to the max bad a** kids running around, a few of them shoved me while I was in line to get a cake. I am a mother now but I have not always been one. I use to be and still am that person who looks around wondering where these kids parents are. On that note my children behave all the time because they know what's up if the act a fool.  I dont know what this resturant looks like on a weekday but. Am willing to take a chance and find out. I give this resturant a 4 star rating for the Yummy cakes and the smell of the food that I can not wait try. Then there is the employees, who seemed very well composed and kind with all the madness except for that one; I don't think I will see him next time. I didn't like that the didn't take control of their waiting area, I tell you It was awful in there. If you are lucky call ahead and order to go if they do that of make a resevation to bypass it all."
Jasmine S.,"San Diego, CA",60,64,81,3.0,12/31/2013,Went here again and ate at the bar. I ordered the typhoon punch and it was 5 + stars it was so yummy. I also had the chocolate bread which I love. I ordered the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap and it was overlly salty. The lettuce that it came with was too small to place any filling in. The mixture was less chicken and more noodles than anything. It was just too much seasoning. I would still come back but do not order that try the asian lettuce tacos instead they are awesome!
Dustin P.,"Queens, NY",12,5,6,5.0,8/24/2014,I loved the service and the food was great. I had the shrimp scampi and for appetizers i had the fried mac and cheese and stuffed mushroom was delicious
Bernadette A.,"San Diego, CA",141,311,316,4.0,4/20/2011,"I've been meaning to review this place and I usually don't try to review big chain restaurants. I do like coming here though. If you know what's good for you and your health, you wouldn't try to come here very often. The only dish I ever order from here now is the Chicken Madeira. One taste and you'll see why.  The wait time is usually long at this location. I don't mind it because I don't come here very often. It would be hard to bring a big group in though--I just wouldn't go through that madness."
Heather N.,"Alpine, CA",0,4,1,5.0,2/11/2015,Best service in forever!  Been trying out restaurants with my boyfriend for months now and we've never had such good service along with such amazing food! I'm a server at another restaurant so I can be super critical about the service at certain places but I could not say one bad thing about this place. Our servers name was Christina H. & she made it a great experience for mine and my boyfriends anniversary.  If I could rate this place more stars I would! :)
Dj W.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,2,1.0,4/28/2014,"Came in at 2 pm on a Monday, not even busy at all. Waited for 10 min and Michelle (our Casper waitress) never came to take our drink order. Asked the hostess if we can sit at the bar to get served sooner, no apology there for the wait.  Went to the bar. No one to serve us also. Waste of time especially when I'm on a 1hr lunch break.  Another time I called in for an order ""to go"" and that order wasn't even placed. So I had to wait longer.  I love cheescake factory but the customer service at the Fashion Valley is lacking. Go to another location."
Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1368,948,3941,4.0,9/2/2010,"I think this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory, but then almost everything in San Diego is my favorite.  I love it down there. This one is huge, fun architecture, pretty good parking in the mall. The same menu as the other places so I won't go into it (see reviews for the Marina del Rey CF).  The pieces of cheesecake were HUGE, and so will I be if I continue to eat too much of it. Great for groups.  It's pretty noisy and sometimes hard to hear, but it's such a great place, it's worth it."
Joanne B.,"San Diego, CA",1010,663,2397,4.0,10/27/2008,"I've eaten at this location many times over the years and ended up here for an early dinner yesterday after a relaxing day at the spa with my girlfriends.  To my surprise, we got seated immediately when we rolled in at 5:00.  I couldn't believe it, we had a nice booth tucked away from all the foot traffic and noise in the main room which was a great start to our dining experience. We decided to share our grub and started off with calamari, the endive salad and lastly,  the chicken madeira with asparagus dish between the three of us. Of course we ordered some cocktails while we waited for our grub.  The specialty drink selection looked great, but I was in the mood for some Pinot.  The girls enjoyed their Asian Pear martinis and mojitos. =) Service was great, the food was scrumptious and the strawberry shortcake dessert we ended our dining experience with was fabulous.  Although the place was getting really busy with the dinner crowd, not once did we feel rushed to get out of there; we must've been sitting there for a good two hours not realizing what time it was...it's been a while since I've seen my girls! This place is normally crowded and the wait time for a table can be a pain, but if you're willing to wait it out or if you're old enough to find an open seat in the bar area (with no kids in tow), go for it!   The only things I need to knock them on is the bread coming out cold (it's normally served warm) and their super slippery floors.  Ladies, be careful if you're wearing heels, you can easily eat sh-t if you're not paying attention to the slippin' and slidin' with their shiny flooring.  Oh yeah, the restroom was also in need of some maintenance, but that was just an observation that didn't ruin my time here since I have yet to have a really bad experience dining at any Cheesecake Factory location. =)"
Mina P.,"San Diego, CA",4,15,47,3.0,12/7/2013,"Food: Delicious Parking: hate it...there is none Staff: nice but they hardly ever come to your table. You get bread 5 min before you get your food, which comes 20 min later  :-( Location: fashion valley mall...nuff said  :-( 5 stars for food 1 star for everything else... Cheesecakes are really that good!"
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,77,6,4.0,12/21/2012,"Typical Cheesecake Factory, as in it's no different from all the other locations. Food is consistent, and it's a safe option when you can't decide what you want to eat, since the menu is extensive with a wide variety of choices. My Cesar Salad was standard, but good. Portions are quite sizable. I got the small and even that was hard to finish.  Our server here (I believe her name was Martin?) was super sweet, and attentive even though we came in the middle of dinner rush and the restaurant was super busy. We sat on the patio, and with the heaters on it was quite pleasant.  Overall just your standard Cheesecake Factory/chain restaurant, with hefty portions of overly heavy, yet reliable food."
Michael L.,"Arcadia, CA",112,261,30,2.0,7/31/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory sadly disappointed me. I've never been taken care of so poorly at a Cheesecake Factory, and the Cheesecakes I had that day were subpar for sure. I came with two of my friends, and all of us were quite excited for their annual National Cheesecake Day with half-off Cheesecakes. The first thing we had was the bread. As thankful as I was that it was hot, the bread tasted worse than the other ones I've had in the past. Their rye bread doesn't have quite as much flavor or sweetness as what I've been used to. We each followed up with a lunch-sized portion of their pasta, getting Pasta Da Vinci and Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I had forgotten how much smaller their lunch portions are. It should still fill the average appetite, but their dinner portions may be almost twice the size of their lunch portions. Their pasta tasted the same as the others, so I was quite thankful for that. If you do plan on coming here for pasta, the two pastas we ordered are definitely the ones I would recommend. We concluded our meal with two slices of cheesecakes, their Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel and their Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. Both were mediocre. The Dutch Apple tasted as if it's been sitting out for days. The streusel and crust was extremely soggy and the cheesecake looked as if the middle deflated. Disappointing considering this is normally a $7 slice of cheesecake. The Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, was lacking in fruit flavors and was not as dense as I expect New York style Cheesecake to be. It could be that they mass produced these cheesecakes more than usual in preparation for the event, thus lowering the quality of their overpriced cheesecakes. For the normal price, I'd recommend going elsewhere for dessert. The waitress for my table did nothing to make our table feel any better about the meal. She pretty much ignored our table, perhaps noting that it was merely three college students. The waitress didn't fill my water cup up once, nor did she notice the times we tried waving her over. It literally took me to wave and speak up an ""excuse me!"" in order to get her attention. Another time we thought she saw us as she walked over, but instead she just put her back against us while she talked to the table next to us. Honestly, would it hurt you to pay more attention to us? Overall, the food was nothing special - if anything it's overpriced and lacking in flavor. Their cheesecakes were not nearly as great as I remembered. I don't think I'll be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Especially since they don't offer happy hour here."
