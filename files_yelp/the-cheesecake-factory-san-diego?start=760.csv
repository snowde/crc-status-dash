Kristiana A.,"San Diego, CA",143,194,168,4.0,9/26/2010,"My favorite dish is the dynamite salmon rolls -- salmon wrapped in seaweed paper and then lightly fried, served on top of some sweet/spicy sauce.  It's delicious, light, and allows me plenty of room for some delicious RED VELVET CHEESECAKE.   They also now offer a ""small plates menu"" that offers some smaller portioned foods for a cheap price.  I love this idea because it lets you sample a lot of different things without spending too much.   There is also plenty of seating here.  Even when the place looks intimidatingly busy, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table.  Yummy place to eat after a day of shopping in Fashion Valley."
Lincoln N.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",295,32,,3.0,12/7/2012,"Service was good, just the food was nasty. I had the spinach dip and would never order it again. I'm not sure, but I remember it tasting much better.  The buffalo wings were the best thing I had here and I think wings n things is even better. I ordered some chicken and rice dish and the rice was dry as hell.  Man, if you give this place higher than 3 stars, you must not know anything about food. Sorry but it was plain nasty and I barely ate anything.  The cheesecake I had was decent, the presentation on their cheesecake was nice. That's probably the only thing I have to say that's nice for this place.  When I drive by now and see all those people waiting outside. I just feel sorry for them now, you people are about to be in for a rude awakening."
Taimane U.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,5.0,2/5/2015,My favorite place ever for dinner in San Diego. My favorite entree there was the sun dried tomatoes with grilled chicken with fettuccine Alfredo. And if you eat desert there get any cheesecake and you will be in heaven its to good just to eat one
Amy T.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",9,32,21,1.0,12/8/2012,"WORST CHEESECAKE FACTORY EXPERIENCE EVER!!! I don't know if my standards went up or something is wrong with this place but I seriously wanted to walk out of the restaurant in the middle of the dinner!!! I have been to Cheesecake Factory in SF, Palo Alto and LA...but SD has the worst food and services ever! First of all, the bread that they served wasn't warm... that's okay. It's not a big deal to me. Then, I ordered a passion fruit mojito ... when I took my first sip ... yikes I just taste syrup... the mint wasn't crushed... it's just flowing on my glass... so I told the server that this is tasting right to me ... his response was ""it can't be wrong because it was made by their recipe!!"" However, they offered to change my drink, so I decide to go with the regular mojito because I thought maybe the passion fruit flavor is supposed to be sweeter. When I got my regular mojito, all I tasted was just sprite and again the mint wasn't crushed... I wasn't the only person felt the same way. Something is wrong with their ""recipe""!  My bf got the bang bang chicken and shrimp... the server asked him if he wants white or brown rice... he goes with the brown. Of course, the plate came out with white rice!!! I ordered the garlic noodle with shrimp... the pasta was so dry and I seriously think I can make the same stuff... don't understand why it cost $17. During the meal, I was watching them how they set up their table... seriously... I can't eat my food anymore. There were trash all over the floor and they didn't even care to clean them. We didn't even finish 1/3 of our meals and we decided to leave...  The bill came out $73!! We just wasted $73 on the worst drinks, food and service!!"
David N.,"Riverside, CA",28,179,14,4.0,8/26/2013,I haven't had bad meal here; despite I always end up waiting in line.
Van T.,"Sonoma, CA",206,258,79,2.0,7/9/2013,"Contrary to popular reviews, this place didn't own up to its menu or some of its reviews.  The apple cider was just like warm homemade apple juice whilst the daiquiri didn't even have a hint of alcohol as requested. Upon scoping out the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try out the miso salmon and the texmex for an appetizer.  The texmex itself was new to me and if that's how all Texmex would taste-I hate it.  The salmon itself was terribly bland and poorly marinated! It looked like a somewhat fancy restaurant and for the price of a dinner of two, I expected much better.  The only interesting thing about my experience was snickering at a diner nearby preaching history lessons to his date who is clearly bored the hell out of her mind."
Stephanie W.,"San Diego, CA",63,178,232,4.0,5/7/2013,"Loved the Carlton Salad, but got mine with mixed greens instead of romaine. Try the flying gorilla cocktail... Delicious!"
Anthony P.,"North Grafton, MA",20,35,9,5.0,7/3/2014,If you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory it's a good time.  They are very corporate in everything they do the staff is well trained and there menu is huuuuge so many options it can be overwhelming.  You could come here so often and never eat the same thing there is something for everyone.  If you like cheesecake there is none better than this place as well they have about twenty choices of cheesecake and there all really really good.  It a great place for kids as well.  There out door patio is huge and comfortable.  They also have a big bar if you wanna go watch a game and eat or even go solo.
Amanda E.,"Akron, OH",41,93,72,1.0,7/13/2014,Let's start with the fact that it was so loud in there I got a head ache before I got my food. I got a chicken parm sandwich and it was just blahhhh greasy mess. Not worth the money that's for sure and my hubby got a steak not sure which on but it was a sad little pice of scrap looking steak that was like 25 bucks crazy!!! And as a place that's main thing is it's cheese cakes I though this is gonna be yummy and what I got was not it was bland it was supposted to be Carmel swirled cheese cake and they let me down they really did the pice my hubby got was strawberry an it was ok nothing to write home about. So all in all we won't be going back and tell me why water is served in a plastic beer mug cup but soda is in a real glass makes no sense to me
Noe V.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/8/2014,"Hostess Sasha was very rude, cheesecake usually has friendly staff but today sasha was unfriendly and it will discourage me from coming to this location. Food is great like always but the hostess should be removed it ruin my day. server got my good wrong too!"
Grace B.,"San Diego, CA",846,588,588,3.0,12/27/2012,"Came here after class one night with some classmates. The service was good. I have a particular way of eating my banana cream cheesecake and they made it just right! Otherwise, I'm not the greatest fan of this place as the menu is just too big and the food isn't all that great. I did try their steam bun and it was good...will definitely be back for the cheesecake."
Nida K.,"London, United Kingdom",1943,704,2302,4.0,6/11/2012,"I've been here plenty of times & I cannot bring myself to order anything else but the Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic. Yup, it's that good. And even though it's probably 2000 calories, I will still order it... & try to split it up into two meals.  As you already know if you come during dinner time - it's crazy packed, no reservations, and expect to wait for a table. The food here is really good, nearly every dish will make your taste buds jump for joy. However, there is a tragic flaw to this story -- if you're getting an appetizer, entree, & dessert, you will be consuming approximately 2-3x more calories in this meal than you should be eating for the whole entire day. That's cray!  Cheesecake Factory is good. Yes it is. Healthy? Nahhhhhhh. The Health Coach in me wants you to be wary of what you order. Hahaha"
Rob Y.,"Pasadena, CA",120,345,878,1.0,1/11/2011,"3 Strikes and you are out! We went here with the expectations of Cheesecake Factory and they failed in more places than one.  First of all, they took FOREVER to bring us our food.  We didn't order anything complicated.   Once I got my steak, it was tough and unedible. 2nd Strike.    That said, what pissed me off the most was that they kicked my dog out of the patio.  The manager was a total dick about it and didn't help out the situation.  I would have been more forgiving if they let Coco (see the picture) hang out on the outside of the railing.  The manager said that he could do it and then never came back.  3rd strike. Seriously,  these people could have done waaaay better.  I would honestly say this is the worst experience I have EVER had at a Cheesecake Factory.  I will NEVER come back to this place."
Realtor Karl B.,"San Diego, CA",59,1973,16,3.0,4/22/2013,"Don't get the bloody mary, do get the cheesecakes! This place is usually busy, so hopefully your wait time is not too long. What's good: tuna salad, jamaican jerk, strawberry shortcake, any cheesecake. Prices are way too high here - alcoholic drinks cost around $13, entrees are around $18."
Chris M.,"Fresno, CA",50,5,6,5.0,11/5/2014,"Susy was so nice; what a great waitress! Super polite, very funny and all around a great human being. Her customer service was outstanding. Hopefully you'll be lucky enough to get her service. Definitely ask for her!!!"
Grant V.,"San Diego, CA",102,46,24,5.0,7/6/2014,The avocado egg rolls are to die for!! The portions are large enough to split if you go with a significant other. Service was excellent and the patio area is really nice to enjoy the weather and a great meal!
Jordan S.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,2,2,2.0,8/9/2014,The food took over a half-hour to make. Our chicken portion for the tomato basil pasta was extremely small. We asked for medium rare kids sliders and they turned out over-cooked
Dontbotherme L.,"El Dorado, CA",78,3,,5.0,1/23/2016,"Nicole C was awesome!!! Me and my girlfriend come to Cheesecake Factory A LOT so we've become accustomed to the awesome food and cool atmosphere but this visit was just awesome, one of the best experiences we have ever had, Nicole was a fantastic waitress and really made our day. She constantly checked on us and brought refills before our glasses were empty! Hope to come back very soon!"
Heather W.,"Bentonville, AR",321,590,520,4.0,5/17/2010,"I had a glass of wine at the bar, but didn't eat. My review is based on the service I received and while it's limited, their wine list is actually alright. (Though I wish they'd serve the St. Supery Cab by the glass)! From the minute I walked in the door, from the hostess to the bartenders, the service was absolutely friendly and with a smile. They were right on, and it was actually refreshing to walk into this place. I was a bit surprised, because I always expect Cheesecake Factory to be a bit of an overwhelming experience due to the crowd. Not the case at all. A huge thumbs up to this particular location. They're doing something right, at least with the crew they had on Sunday night (the 16th of May).  Just this experience alone makes me want to break my diet!"
Dexter P.,"New York, NY",99,110,86,4.0,6/23/2013,"Cheesecake!!! I can never get enough of this place.  It's a very family oriented dining venue. I'm sure kids will love the cheesecakes and food.  In the heart of Fashion valley mall, it is always busy.  If you are looking to have a table, you might be waiting for a bit. I am sure they are on it.   Preference is to sit close to bar, where the communal tables are at.  More likely, you will have someone leaves or short time in waiting.  Service is great. The breads are phenomenal, and drinks are not as bad. Did I mention the food is awesome?  Visit one close to your neighborhood today. You'll love it!"
