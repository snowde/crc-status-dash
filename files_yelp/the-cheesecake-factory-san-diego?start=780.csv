Dong Z.,"University City, San Diego, CA",6,45,34,4.0,10/14/2014,"1 star for the big cheesecake, another for the beautiful surroundings, and 1 for waiters, the last one should be given to whom with you."
Jen M.,"San Francisco, CA",130,163,59,4.0,9/17/2014,"Great for a group or work lunch because this restaurant serves EVERYTHING! And to boot, my favorite thing on the menu is their healthy ahi salad. To turn down burgers and pasta BY CHOICE to have a salad, it must be amazing!"
Nicole H.,"Las Vegas, NV",274,84,289,1.0,11/13/2014,"The service was horrible from the moment we walked in. The receptionist didn't greet us and continued to stare at us as if we came off planet Neptune. Once we were seated we noticed a long blonde hair on top of one of our napkins. Gross! We didn't say anything we just pushed it aside and used another one. We had to ask twice before getting lemons for our water. When I got my steak it was burnt and over cooked. The worst part was the waitress continued to argue the steak was not over cooked nor burned. She refused to take my plate back by making all sorts of excuses. I don't think it's a waitress' position to make that decision. She should've taken it back or had a manager come out and look at it. Her attitude was very unprofessional! After she left, she came back and said if I wanted they would remake the steak but this time cut it in half and then cook it. I didn't like the idea and at that point I no longer felt comfortable sending back my plate with her. It seemed like if she was taking my plate back it was coming with a little something on it. No thank you! I'm sure she could tell I was upset and never did she come out to apologize or fixed it in anyway. I paid for burned steak."
Greg A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,17,,5.0,12/1/2015,"Went on black Friday for dinner expecting a long wait. TJ came and grabbed us for a bar table, and was one of the best waiters I've ever had. Made the whole dinner awesome. Thanks TJ"
Elgen P.,"San Diego, CA",5,50,2,4.0,6/6/2013,I went here yesterday for a graduation celebration and it was nice. The staff was pretty friendly. I got the Flatbread Margherita which was suprisingly good. It's good to get if you aren't that hungry which I wasn't. The only bad thing I can say are the prices but I mean it is the Cheesecake Factory. Expect to spend at least $15 a person.
Kristen C.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",155,8,12,5.0,2/1/2013,"My husband and I go here at least once a month. So far iv tried.... Chicken Bellagio Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad & Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.  Chicken Marcella is my all time favorite entree. I hate mushrooms and this is the only time the I will eat them because of the sauce that's in this entree. Caramelized mushrooms? Yes please!   They have so many cheesecake to choose from.  The grilled mac an cheese and avocado egg rolls are amazing as well. I would recommend this place to anyone."
Echo B.,"San Diego, CA",26,26,2,5.0,3/26/2013,My fiance and I came here for our one year anniversary of being engaged. It was the perfect experience. The service was excellent and the food was to die for. Everything tasted delicious.  I am excited to come back to try other items on their menu.
Daniel A.,"San Diego, CA",4971,184,434,4.0,5/16/2010,"Just like my reviews of PF Changs, the Cheesecake Factory is a consistently great restaurant that you can eat at in just about ever city in the United States. No matter what you order, you will get too much delicious food to eat on a plate.  I love every item on this menu, and it is huge! They actually give you a book of items to order.  Today I had brunch, starting at 10:00 AM. Word to the wise, the mall does not allow any alcohol sales before 11:00 AM, so if you want a Mimosa, make sure you get there just before 11:00 AM.  Overall Food Rating on ALL DISHES: 4  Service: 4.5  Atmosphere: 4  Fair Prices: 4.5"
Carol S.,"San Diego, CA",305,174,117,3.0,4/24/2013,"The food is good, and obviously the cheesecake is great (otherwise they should change their name), but I always bite my tongue on the service.  The hostess are pretty much always rude because they're always busy and annoyed with customers, and I feel like the servers feel the same way but try to be nice because they need to make their tips.  I love their chicken fingers and avocado egg rolls. I also like their salmon and half chicken. The prices are good for the portions, but I would go to a more upscale bar if I wanted to pay so much for drinks."
Chrissie O.,"Escondido, CA",251,807,857,3.0,4/24/2010,"i love the cheesecake and the food here which hurts to just give them only 3 stars.  The food is great, the service is bad so that evens it out to 3 stars.   The food... I love the lettuce wraps.  Had them twice and they are absolutely delicious.  Good to start off the meal with.  For the dinner, I usually stick to the menu items i know i like.  My favorite pasta is the chicken fettucine.  I also like the factory combinations.  The salmon is yummy and so is the shrimp. The cheesecake..  Sometimes I just drive down to fashion valley just to get some cheesecake to go.  Crazy.  yes.  normal for me.  yes.  I used to always get the tiramisu cheesecake.  Gives me the chocolate craving i want but it isn't too much chocolate.  The tiramisu cake is actually better than the cheesecake.  If you love tiramisu just as much as I do then get the cake over the cheesecake.  Banana creme cheesecake is really good also.  I just recently had my new favorite a few months a go and I have driven down there many times to have it again.  the pineapple upside down cheesecake.  it is delicious!  yum!   The service.  Fail.  From my experience with large parties, never come here with a lot of people.  If you do, expect to wait 2 hours.  Happened to me twice with the large parties i was in.  They won't actually give you a buzzer unless most of your people are there.  One time I waited in their lobby for a good hour for my take-out.  I ordered my take-out with my friend at the same time.  Hers was finished when they told us to come back but mine wasn't ready yet.  So I patiently waited then I got mad.  I had to complain and I had to wait for a manager... more waiting.   It was stupid they put back my order.  He offered my next meal free but I didn't know the next time i'd be down since I live around 40 minutes away.  He ended up refunding my cheesecakes which was nice of him.  It is hit or miss with the service so be prepared. Overall, I'll still eat here because I love the food and the cheesecake.. mmm. cheesecake.  yum."
Jim P.,"Poway, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/23/2016,"I ordered steak with potatoes.  It was delicious.  However, the time it took to finally enjoy that meal was 1 hr wait time.  I was very disappointed.  The waitress ignored us the whole time.  I'd say go on a early weekday, otherwise you'll be caught in amusement park line."
Rebecca P.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/13/2015,The waiter (Juliana) was so rude after two of my friends left her a tip when they were paying she was walking away she came back saying what is this. Like really?? Then when she came back with my change there as some change yeah it was 21 cents but still then she said if you really need it I'll bring it to you like I work hard for my money. Never going back
Keith F.,"San Diego, CA",31,45,,3.0,7/26/2014,"Sitting here right this very moment. I rate the food good. It's pretty much always good. The service....1 star. What in the hell is the deal with the servers not checking on tables. The service basically sucks. Plain and simple. After we get the check, I highly doubt that we will be back. IF WE COULD EVER EVEN GET THE CHECK!!!!!!!!"
Brian L.,"New Freedom, PA",0,13,,1.0,11/11/2015,"Happened to stop by for lunch on Veterans Day, my wife asked if they were doing any deals for Veterans on Veterans Day they said they didn't have any.  I was amazed, what a disappointment that they can't do anything to show appreciation to all those who have served. I will never eat at this chain again. God Bless Our Veterans and God Bless the United States of America."
Madison H.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/4/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory this past Sunday with my boyfriend.  It looked somewhat busy, but we were seated immediately.  The hostess sat us at a small table next to a lot of walking traffic and it was really loud.  I didn't mind that so much since I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory's and I know what to expect when it comes to a table and the noise.  If you prefer something a little more private, I would wait for a booth.  If you are looking for a quiet place, this is not where you want to eat.  The Cheesecake factory is usually always busy and loud.  Again, I don't mind any of that.  I always enjoy eating here.  My issue this past Sunday was the service.  I wish I would of remembered his name.  He was polite, but I often felt like he forgot about us.  Once we ordered and received our appetizer the server asked us how it tasted and then he did not come back for a very long time.  Then it took what seemed to be an hour for our entrees.  Before our entrees arrived we had already finished our appetizer and our drinks and we were chatting for a while.  No one came to check to see if we needed anything else or to give us an update on our food even though we had that ""where is our server"" look.  I don't get out too often so when I finally do, it really sucks to constantly wonder what is going on with the server instead of enjoying my meal and good company.  This issue wouldn't of been that big of a deal if our server acknowledged the fact that we were waiting for him for too long anytime we wanted something.  I don't want to have to wait ten minutes for a side of ranch to go with my meal that has already arrived. Everything else was great and the food tasted better this time than any other time."
San P.,"San Diego, CA",1,29,5,1.0,11/6/2015,"Consistently bad service especially when calling in to place an order. If you're lucky someone actually answers the phone. When they do pick up the phone, they sound like you've woken them up from a nap. Dine-in service is not much better. Some of the wait staff can really make you regret eating here. Ownership really needs to take a look at management and training here. So sad to see our local Cheesecake Factory going downhill."
Kyle A.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,8,4.0,11/26/2014,"Went in for a late dinner, the Cobb salad and chicken pasta was the perfect combination for 2 people after a night of running around the city"
Randi W.,"Temple, TX",98,9,26,4.0,7/5/2013,"Tryed this place for the very first time a couple of weeks ago. I fell in love with it. Besdes it being over crowded & the wait time was longer then most, I enjoyed my meal. We got Desert togo. I think that because it is so popular then need to open up more locations in the County maybe put one in North County. What I had I think my most fav meal in any place Ive been: Chicken Madeira Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes"
Miki Z.,"San Diego, CA",4,12,8,4.0,7/2/2013,"I went for the first time ever, the guy kept offering me the seafood special, even though I kept telling him I hate seafood... ** I was looking forward for the cheesecake ....I got the Oreo slice,.. It melts in your mouth, It was delicious, and it is about $7-8 a slice,,  Sothe cheesecake was good, that's why I gave 4 stars, the service deserves about 2, he asked me like 5x even though I kept telling him, no I don't like seafood, I hate seafood it's not my thing.. Like get the hint sir."
Jazmin Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,3.0,12/21/2015,"Food was decent but the service was like Phoebus Buffay's twin sister Ursula. Ordered a plain black coffee and for some reason it's slightly warm and since we sat outside the telltale sign would've been steam coming out and it wasn't so I asked if it could be warmed up the waitresses answer was well I gave you what was sitting in the pot...umm so you're saying you gave me old cold coffee in a dirty cup by the way. The food came out and it was pretty decent, I had mentioned earlier that I would order something to go towards the end and I told her what it was, halfway thru my meal she gave us my to go order. When asked if it could be kept warm she said well it in when you ordered it.  My sigh of exasperation couldnt've been more heavier for this bad case of common sense. We also ordered a Coke that came towards the end of the meal.  And to top his off a cockroach climbed up the wall from our side of the booth. If you want Ursula Buffay to give you service you just might run into this service. Overall ok food and Tiramisu cheesecake is pretty good"
