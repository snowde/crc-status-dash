Adam E.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,4.0,11/26/2017,"I want to update my review and increase the rating from 3 stars to 4 based on another few visits to this restaurant.  I live close by and visit this mall a lot.  Fashion Valley mall is relatively upscale, with the usual food court in the center, along with several quite good restaurants near the entrances to the mall. My new experiences were much more positive.  The breakfast omelettes are actually quite good and I will attest to very good fresh juices. Also they have some very fresh tasting lunch entree salads.  Even my wife, who has an obsession with natural fresh food gave it thumbs up, a rare endorsement. As for why I didn't give it 5 stars, it's because there are some items that feel rather mass-produced.  Some of the desserts for example.  It's to be expected in a large and very busy restaurant.  Maybe I'm being a bit unfair looking for a home-cooked feel in a high traffic restaurant at the front entrance to a busy mall. Overall, I enjoy coming here.  My biggest complaint is that it's always packed.  Apparently a lot of other people enjoy it as well."
Liz G.,"Washington, DC",79,40,15,1.0,10/27/2017,"Came with my husband and stepson for dinner. We asked to sit in the bar area to watch the game and were promised a table by the hostess. After standing there for ten minutes and watching others walk up and just get tables, we left, hungry and upset. Bottom line: the hostess doesn't know what she's doing. Take your hunger elsewhere."
Joe T.,"San Diego, CA",10,49,4,5.0,8/7/2017,"Went there Saturday night for wife's birthday.  We were seated inside.  Daniel and Jason served us and they were amazing servers.  A few months ago we were there as well (seated outside) and we were served by a girl with blonde/reddish hair.  I wish I could remember her name.  I saw her working there Saturday while we waited outisde.  She was amazing too. Everything was great.  Food, drinks, service, I only wish the parking situation could improve a little somehow.  Even our little kids love the Cheesecake Factory.  It's by far their favorite restaurant."
Rebecca A.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,4,5,5.0,7/15/2017,"I came with my girls is just great place for Family,romantic and casual place just for hang out. The wait is a bit too long to be seated and to get served. But if you do you like great quality food this is the beast place to come to make your money worth while. I had great time loved the food. And if you are a tourist you must come visit this place enjoy."
Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",336,851,1978,4.0,6/1/2016,There is a reason these chains are always crowded. Consistent food with large portions that can turn one meal into two. I am not a fan of knowing the calorie count but understand the need.  The chicken parm Sammie wasn't bad but the everything pizza stole the show. Better than some gourmet pizzerias in town. They poor a healthy size glass of wine so that seals the deal for me.
Mike W.,"San Diego, CA",202,34,9,5.0,10/26/2017,We always get the bacon bacon cheeseburger and the shrimp angel hair pasta! Food is always amazing with tons of flavor! Service is always on point as well. This location is the best!!
Paige D.,"Ridgecrest, CA",32,7,18,2.0,8/5/2017,Seriously wish I didn't Waste my time and money here...  first off they kept switching who was our waitress at least three people we had. they rarely ever came to the table to refresh our drinks:/ Another thing was we waited like over an hour for our food. Had to remind them basically about our order but after waiting for our food we finally got it and once again another disappointment....everything was over cooked. Order a chicken pasta dish and told us after handing us our meal uh we ran out of chicken by the way...like seriously. My hubbys meal was over cooked. We order a hamburger. And waitresses I notice were so attentive to everyone else around us never offered my family the extra cheese for the pasta dish but did for everyone else around us. Let alone people who sat next to us ordered alcohol + there main entrees got everything within 15mins while we waited over an hour.....
Lizbeth F.,"Chula Vista, CA",62,175,240,3.0,8/16/2016,I have been here so many times but today was totally different! I don't know what's happening to Cheesecake Factory!! It's going down!!!  My mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it was all burnt! We had to send it back! The taste was in her mouth for so long! She can still taste the burn!!!  Drinks were good!! Bread was good The four cheese pasta didn't taste the same!!  The fries cheese was the only thing we liked! Even the cheesecake wasn't that great! Usually we finish it all but not this time!!!!  Cheesecake you have to do something is not you're gonna start loosing customers!
Joseph S.,"Alpine, CA",14,181,15,4.0,10/11/2017,"Wow, so many reviews on this place!  We have been to this location about 10 times over the past few years and have never been disappointed. The food is really tasty and there is plenty of it. Thank goodness too, it's a bit pricey. However, it's great for birthdays and anniversaries also. The atmosphere is excellent and the service is great. Go early if you can because it does get a bit crowded in the evenings. Reservations are really the best way to go if you can. I didn't know they had other locations until I decided to write this review, so we may have to try other locations. But, if you want to try something different than your usual romantic place, give one of these places a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
Leo D.,"San Diego, CA",198,15,22,4.0,11/3/2017,After work because I work in the morning. Usually very busy but they are great and honest. I just wish they had a few more hosts to help upfront during rush hours.
Mary K.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",540,703,1410,2.0,5/20/2017,"I don't get the hype here. Unless Drake and I are fighting, I don't see a reason to come here. The food is crazy overpriced, bland and the service is crappy. One look at the calories list will make you want to leave. I tried the pasta carbonara here today and the pasta was overcooked, the sauce was bland and I saw about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. I ended up taking the cap off the pepper shaker and loading the pasta up with it, to make it somewhat edible. The food is average, nothing special."
Ana H.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",51,6,,1.0,8/19/2017,We came to celebrate a friend for the Muscle competition and have waited for an hour for our food!!!!! Not acceptable!
John C.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,152,,3.0,1/2/2017,"Came recently on a crazy busy Tuesday night. Like most Cheesecake Factory's, the restaurant is huge so the wait was only about 30 minutes. The food was good, not great. The free bread is yummy, probably because we were starving. Servings are generous. My pork chop entree was fine, but the mashed potatoes were barely warm and the green beans were slightly overcooked. My guess is the food had been sitting on the counter for a few minutes.  Overall, probably 3-1/2 stars, but will round down a little bit this time."
Missy F.,"San Diego, CA",71,120,173,2.0,10/23/2016,"We had the absolute worst Hostess ever!  1st Impressions says a lot, if you don't like your job (SHELBY) find a new one.  As soon as our buzzer went off, we handed it to Shelby. She did not even look at us, she simply put our menu's together and walked away...no smile, no hello, no please follow me. We sat on the patio near the door....and here comes Shelby.. yelling out two employees that were following her (I need you two to hurry up...that's what I need you to do)..attitude and all..SMH. We did let our server know as well as the Manager. He stated he would talk with her, however she still had a stank face going on while we were there. That leads me to think Shelby was probably the Manager's side chick or something???? On top of the bad service..we ordered Sangria's at 11.95 ea... I did not taste a lick of alcohol...NOTHING! Needless to say... it was not a pleasant experience. As a Yelper I am going to base my review on not only the food, but my entire experience. The extra star that I gave was for the cheesecake I had which is always on point."
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3294,1439,1446,5.0,4/9/2016,"Awesome Cheesecake Factory Location! I've been coming here for years since I moved to San Diego. It's the only location in SD besides the one in Seaport Village. Went here last night for dinner and met up with fellow elite Maridel A. and her friend. We sat outside and OMFG why have I never dined outside before?! IT'S SO DAMN NICE! It has such a  romantic feel! They have plenty of heaters outside so no need to worry about the weather. I love it at night! Perfect for a date setting. I was starving and I ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo $21.95 WHAT A STEAL WHAT A DEAL! IT'S SO DAMN DELICIOUS! It's the first time I ever ordered either of those. I usually get the fried mac & cheese ball (also  ) but I'm so glad I tried something new. I've been liking steak ever since I went to Ruth's Chris. The sauce for the shrimp scampi... OMFG make me drool! YES, BABY! PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME! Maridel A. got the loaded tots and it was really good! It comes with a side of sour cream. It's the Cheesecake Factory's take on the Hooter's lots-a-tots! MAKE SURE TO DINE OUTSIDE AT NIGHT! DO YOURSELF A ROMANTIC FAVOR!  I WISH I HAD A LITTLE ROMANCE IN MY LIFE... HECK I NEED IT!"

Sandra R.,"San Diego, CA",85,58,12,2.0,6/5/2017,"1 - It was super empty yet while the greeters that are usually at the desk chatted in the back 3 parties stood there waiting a few minutes till they approached us.  2 - Food Quality was horrible. Presentation was bad. Ordered the chicken and biscuit, got a plate full of green peas. Food wasn't even warm at the time it was served.  3- Waitress'  and bussers service was awesome. She was very attentive when asked. He was super friendly.  Will I be back to THIS location? Probably not."
Chad R.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/15/2017,"At first this experience wasn't going so great, but the staff did such a good job of turning it around, I'm giving it 5 stars anyway.  I ordered Curbside-To-Go where you call in the order and then when you arrive, you pull into the designated parking spot, and they bring your order out to you.  Everything was going smoothly, we were dressed in PJs so were excited to not have to get out of the car to execute the pick-up.  As instructed we called the number when we arrived, the girl said it would be right out to us and we began the wait.  18 mins later they still hadn't come out and I called back in, was put on hold and then disconnected while on hold.  I wanted to just go in but again- it's hard to look tough in PJs.  So I called back a third time and Vanessa said that, tho she was in the bakery, she was very sorry we waited so long and that she would take care of us personally right away.  She promptly brought the order out, but it was apparent it had been sitting under the heat lamps for quite some time, and was dried out, so I asked to have it remade.  She was more than charming about it, I felt bad having to ask for that because I knew it wasn't her fault, but I wanted to enjoy my meal after waiting so long for it.   She said it would be around 20 mins, but only about 10 mins later, the manager Sean brought the remade meals out to us, apologized for the experience, offered us a slice of cheesecake and made sure we left happy.  I was compelled to write this review because so many times restaurants drop the ball in some way and fail to make me leave with a positive vibe, but that was not the case here.  I understand everyone there is human and mistakes are made from time to time and they did a very good job of making up for it.  Thank you Vanessa and Sean for a positive experience."
Janice H.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",1,7,6,1.0,8/31/2017,Waiting over an hour for our food. Oops! Our waitress forgot to submit our order!  The Manager did comp our entrée's.
Oscar B.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",0,7,,4.0,10/28/2017,Really american. Good cheese cakes. Very good service and cool environment. The only bad thing is that it was too much food.
