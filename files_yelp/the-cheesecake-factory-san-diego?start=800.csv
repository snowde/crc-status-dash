Tammy M.,"Encinitas, CA",24,117,1,1.0,10/25/2014,"Worst lunch in years. First salad grandular ahi sent back,  chicken salad sent back because no chicken and then brought back with 3 slices of processed chicken product.  Totally awful"
Shelly H.,"Alhambra, CA",65,40,78,5.0,5/2/2012,Try this for breakfast at 11 o'clock on a sunday morning and everywhere else is busy for $8.95 with a huge eggs pancakes and bacon amazing!
Steven J.,"San Diego, CA",9,6,,1.0,6/18/2014,"I never was treated so Badly! I went to the Fashion Valley one last night after taking my 77 year old friend to the VA he had  a stroked 2 months ago and is now Finally get out. He wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory, I had never been and I'll never return! First a Bus Boy sat us then the RUDEST Waitress treated me and my Friend like Garbage!  She Insulted me and worst after speaking to the Manager  he just brushed it off now my 77 year old friend never wants to go there anymore! When you work in the Restaurant Business it's a good idea not to Abuse your Customers! I strongly advise anyone to NOT TO GO to this Restaurant!"
Veritas D.,"Santee, CA",1,7,4,5.0,11/29/2012,"When you go to the Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Valley for dinner you need to understand that it is pricy, busy and noisy. It is a popular place and there is typically a wait. If you go in knowing that, you will have a much better experience.  My most recent visit was really terrific. I asked about the wait for an indoor table, and a server came up and offered to immediately seat us on the patio between two heaters. Every person who helped us from the server to the bussing and other wait staff was really on the ball and nice. The menu is pages and pages long. And we had a wonderful meal followed by more wonderful cheesecake. We were never rushed and when two other friends joined us at the end of the meal, they graciously provided extra forks for sharing our desserts family-style. If you do not want to pay for parking DO NOT enter on the Friars Rd. Entrance and turn right toward the restaurant. The garage is $5 and the valet parking is $25. To avoid this, just TURN LEFT and park anywhere in the lot for free."
Nicole P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,5,5,1.0,11/17/2015,I purchased a large original cheesecake to take to a family dinner and had a less than satisfactory experience.  I asked for a large original cheesecake and requested A few fresh strawberries on the side and the girl preparing the cheesecake said that would be fine.  when I went to pay the girl working the register said she was going to have to charge me for a large fresh strawberry which is more in price rather than just for a side of strawberries.  i didn't understand why I needed to pay so much more for 4 strawberries.  I was upset but paid the difference because I needed the cake. when I got home and took out the cake I found the creamcheeae topping was left off after I specifically told the girl preparing the cake I wanted the cream cheese topping.  To make matters worse when we cut the cake my slice of cheesecake had a long hair embedded in the filling.   I didn't get a receipt for my cheesecake from the snooty girl working the register so now I can't go back and get a refund.  Not happy at all with my experience.
pam r.,"La Mesa, CA",64,87,9,4.0,6/7/2015,"It's a chain but every now and then you need cheesecake! What I liked even better was the Cuban sandwich. Oh my, so good. Filled with meat and toasted  on awesome bread. The Cobb salad was a bit boring but not sure what we expected. Get this sandwich!"
Tina N.,"San Diego, CA",31,30,1,3.0,6/27/2012,"I came here on the worst possible day every: prom! This place was flooded with teenage kids in flashy gowns and spiffy tuxes. If it weren't for my girlfriend's birthday dinner, I definitely would've ditched the two hour wait and fight for tables and come back another day. But since it was a special occasion, we worked with what we got. Disappointingly, our party of fifteen or so were seated at four different tables (two of which were outside and two inside that were no where near each other) while the prom kids mingled back and forth around one table to take pictures and another shenanigans. Note that we've made reservations in advance. But hey, I'll be understanding and excuse that. The prices here are definitely a bit higher than other restaraunts I've been to that offer the same dishes. I ordered Thai Chicken Pasta and my boyfriend ordered some salmon and shrimp dish along with a beer. Our total came out to more than $50, not including gratuity. The food was decent but definitely not burning my wallet for, though the portions were a good size. Service was average: our waiter didn't ignore us but he wasn't very attentive either, probably because it was extra busy. Would I come here again? Sure, when I'm feeling fancy and have extra money to blow. I have yet to try their famous cheesecakes though! It's on my Yelp to-do list."
Rob K.,"San Diego, CA",37,34,3,4.0,12/27/2012,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory? If I could I would eat there all the time, than of course I would be so much more heavier.   Everything I have tried has been excellent.  Favorite Dish? Chicken Madeira.  Favorite Cheesecake? I can't decide, maybe Pumpkin Cheesecake when it's in season.  They used to have a Boston Creme Cheesecake awhile ago and that was probably my all time favorite."
Tinie T.,"Carlsbad, CA",523,720,277,4.0,6/18/2012,"HUGE PORTIONS! Even the entree that they call ""Chicken Littles"" is far from little. First of all, you get a ginormous portion and the chicken littles themselves are actually pretty big too. Comes with BBQ as well as honey mustard dipping sauces. It was good! The ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"" was not as good as I thought it would be. I kinda figured! I picked it for the novelty but there's just so much going on in your mouth that you don't really distinguish the mac n' cheese flavor on its own that much. Just tastes like a really heavy burger. I would rather get a side of mac n' cheese, and just get a regular burger next time. :) Tried the ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake"" for dessert. I liked how they had actual candy bits in it. Worth getting if you can share with your group. Ended up not finishing it between two people, and mostly just ate the inside of the cheesecake or the classic cheesecake part (and not all the crust or the topping). I'm not the world's most enthusiastic peanut butter fan, so I will try something different next time! The waitress recommended this as her absolute favorite cheesecake flavor on the menu so we gave it a go. :)"
Nell L.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,1,4.0,10/17/2015,Food was great! Server was awesome! Just too packed... and a little too loud to even hear our conversations! You must try their cheesecakes.. The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake was divine
Kelsey G.,"San Diego, CA",9,39,6,2.0,5/5/2014,"Tried to give this place benefit of the doubt a couple times assuming that they were just busy. But have been in here even during their non rush hours. Every time, the food takes at least 45min for a table for 2. One time, they got our order wrong, charged us for a salad that was supposed to be included, & my pasta was way too salty! It was too many things to complain to the manager about. Another time, my food was brought out cold. Don't come here hungry! You'll end up waiting & not be so satisfied"
Sarah H.,"Pensacola, FL",134,170,3,4.0,8/13/2012,"I'm sorry, I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. I know it's a chain and CHAINS ARE BAD, but dude, this place rocks. The bartenders are awesome. Seriously, I have never had a bad drink here, and I'm usually tipsy by the end of my mai tai.  The servers are also wonderful: super quick, super friendly, and totally on top of everything. Everybody knows about their ginormous menu and equally ginormous portions, so I won't rehash that. I will say that I always order either the Navajo sandwich or the Cuban sandwich, and I honestly can't decide which one I love better. Oh, and they have the best cheesecake...it's so freaking good. Cheesecake Factory and a movie across the mall? Pretty much the perfect thing everrr. So totally a fan."
Anne C.,"Benicia, CA",8,150,21,4.0,2/7/2013,"I live right down the street from this place but had never actually eaten there until recently because there's always a huge crowd of people waiting outside... and if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. But recently I was craving cheesecake so we decided to go for it. Overall, it was pretty good. We only had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of two and the service was shockingly good. Our waiter was one of the best and most attentive waiters I've had in a long time. I also love that the menu is so huge. There's literally any kind of food you could want to eat.  The food was tasty, with big portions, and of course the cheesecake was heavenly. However, my boyfriend didn't love that the cobb salad (while gigantic and overall good) was all shredded lettuce instead of actual leaves. It was just a step up from the lettuce you would get at Subway. I guess they try to make it bite sized so you can eat it faster? :) I would come back, but it's not someplace I'm just dying to go back to."
Ed V.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",692,502,1049,1.0,6/24/2012,Terrible experience!  We waited over 30 minutes then were seated on the patio.  The waitress carefully left out the patio is smoking!  The service was sub par and it was an awful experience!  I now go to the Chula Vista location which I highly recommend...
Brittany B.,"El Cajon, CA",125,41,9,2.0,8/31/2014,"Very crowded. We sat outside in the sun and our server couldn't keep up with our refills. Walked past the table three times with empty glasses and no offers for refills. Table was unlevel so my glass kept sliding down the table. The white bread was almost to hard to eat. Food came out hot. The skinnylicious chicken pasta was very greasy, tasted delicious but for advertising that it was a healthier option the grease was too much. My husband got the smokehouse burger and really enjoyed it. Overall it was okay. We're only here because we have a gift certificate."
Shaun C.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",124,53,98,4.0,2/20/2013,"Ugh, why is the food here so dang good?! A friend and I ate here the other day and this place was definitely added to my list of go to restaurants. It took FOREVER to find parking, but I guess that's to be expected on a weekend at the mall during lunch time.  It was super packed and we were only able to find seats at the bar. I ordered the curry chicken samosas and the Boston House Salad. He ordered a Ceasar Salad. We both ordered the ""small"" sizes which were actually pretty huge. The food was sooo good and flavorful. That had to be one of the best salads I've ever had. The bartenders were super nice and kept up a great conversation. Unfortunately, I didnt have room to try the cheesecake, but I will update my review once I go back for that.  Love this place! Random WTF tidbit that has nothing to do with my rating: the servers had slippery fingers that day. I swear there were 4-5 glasses dropped and broken. It actually turned into a joke to see who would drop the next one."
Kathy L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/2/2015,"First of all, the service was very good.   My complaint is about the food.  I had a skinnylicious turkey sandwich.  I know it was low a low calorie meal, the size was great, but the turkey was dry and it was hard to find the avocado.  My friend had a hamburger.  Quite large in size, but had no taste.  It did not even come with lettuce.  They use a cabbage lettuce mix chopped up.  Both of our side salads was just lettuce...spring mix, nothing else.  We did not complain about food to waitress since this is not her fault.  Prices are not cheap, quality of food has gone down...such a disappointment .  Iced tea's were good as always,  and the cheesecake delicious."
Laura S.,"Chula Vista, CA",9,205,78,5.0,4/8/2014,Wow wow wow !!! Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restuarnt they have the best food here and the bread they give you is delicious ! We normally order like 3 rounds of that bread yikes!!! But today I ate my fave the chicken costaletta !! It was wonderful as always with mash potatoes and asparagus!!! They waiter was fabulous he was so nice and recommended so many different plates !! And are water wouldn't get half way done when he was already filling them up !!   You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory !!! This time no space for a slice of cheesecake!!
Richie A.,"Manchester, WA",11,240,26,4.0,10/8/2012,"Try to eat at these everywhere I go.  I like the menu - really, it is a book.  Portions are good, not easy to consume a meal AND have room for cheesecake at the end. Service is like any very busy location : hit or miss, try going last night - after 9 pm - wait . . . shhhh, don't tell anyone. Chain restaurant that is doing it correctly and well."
Arlene P.,"San Diego, CA",2108,1086,4222,4.0,5/15/2010,"I love this place, but the food is not the best for you. BUT!  This is the place that started my love for Chicken Piccata on Angel hair pasta and today I have proudly made that dish myself for loved ones :) I also love the thai lettuce wraps (no others compare) their Sunday brunch --- oh so bad and yet so good.  And my newest favorite but a body havoc wrecker are the fried avocado rolls!!! (again,  no others can compare!) Funny thing is, that the Cheesecake is not the main draw for me... and the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the long wait and the unhealthiness of it all."
