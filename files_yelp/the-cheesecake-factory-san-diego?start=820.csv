Nathan W.,"Menifee, CA",3,17,,5.0,8/8/2013,"Three words for this place...  BLUE CHEESE DRESSING I'm a BC dressing fanatic, and the BC dressing here tastes like Jesus came down from heaven and made it himself.  This review, and these words can not give it the justice it deserves.  I like the Cajun chicken littles with the BC dressing. The fresh strawberry martini is really good too.  Fresh muddled strawberries. I'm very stingy with 5 star reviews, hope this helps."
Victoria L.,"San Diego, CA",101,3,,1.0,11/24/2015,"I am not one to waste time writing bad reviews, but I think everyone needs to know and Protest going to Cheesecake Factory In Fashion Valley mall San Diego. I went home from my experience shaking and I woke up to write this review, to let people know how horribly this place is run and to share the experience I had. My friend and I came in for a drink at the bar we only wanted 1 shot of tequila to relax after a stressful day working. When the shot was poured, it was so tiny we felt absolutely no effects from the shot because it was so small. Mind you, this is not just about the amount of alcohol received nor the cost.  It was our Harsh treatment and humiliation we received after we complained. The senior manager instead of trying to comp or pour a little more like a dime size more to pacify our disappointment..or even come up with a solution for that matter.. He became extremely argumentative. Borderline scary. Apparently the Senior manager- JT who ruined our evening has not had any customer service training in my opinion or how to deal with complaints as he accused us of attacking him personally in front of other ""guests"" in which every time I mentioned that we are the ""customers"" and that ""our complaints should be properly acknowledged"" he lashed out correcting us that we are ""guests"" not customers. This rude and tacky correction was said four times. Embarrassing and humiliating.  To make matters worse, he started to raise his voice in front of everyone causing a scene and eventually yelled at us to GET OUT pointing his finger at the door and quickly walked away from us, not solving anything not coming up with any solution whatsoever. Was appalled as I have had 15 years in customer service and this was absolutely unacceptable. This Senior Manager JT had absolutely zero skills. As a manager, if a customer is unhappy or upset you do whatever to be polite regardless of how the customer is acting. Service is Poor. Both managers and bartender were even tacky enough to bring up how cooperate runs Cheesecake Factory like we really want to stand here talking about that. Will be filing a complaint with corporate because I think feedback is extremely important and Even the manager would not stand to listen to our feedback. This place may look like a standard good place to go after shopping but go at your own risk you may leave mad and upset.  I took my daughter there for cake on her B day and the waitress brought milks first and cake 35 minutes later I had to ask 3 times where she was it ruined the joy of eating there. I will never ever go back to this place and I don't mind telling others not to go there as well. Went in to end our day with a drink to relax, left humiliated by The Senior Manager and shocked at the lack of service skills once again I will say the management does not care about its customers or ""guests"" as they call it.  I want to add only because this was involving alcohol-we were not drunk nor did we even get a proper feeling from the 10 dollar tiniest shot in the world. We did not order anything else but that, and left not only beyond sober but shaking with humiliation. So we basically paid 20 dollars plus tax to have a terrible experience that we will not soon forget."
Elle S.,"San Diego, CA",0,46,30,4.0,12/15/2014,"This place is always busy due to its popular selection of sweet indulgement.  Despite of long wait to be seated and bad location,  Gill and this wait staff was very accomodating during my recent visit.  Keep the good work!"
Jill C.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,4.0,4/29/2014,"My most recent experience here was a large catering order for work.  The food was ready on time and was packaged perfectly for safe transport.  I ordered two entree salads, a tray of the Farfalle pasta & a White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake.  Their whole cheesecakes normally come frozen but they thawed it out for me so that it was ready to serve.  It all looked & tasted delicious & was a hit.  I felt it was a good value for the quality & quantity of food .    I live near Fashion Valley so my husband & I eat there about once a month.  We usually sit in the bar to avoid the long wait.  The service is typically fine & the food is almost always good.  My husband loves their Huevos Rancheros & I really like the BBQ Chicken Salad.  The portions are huge so we usually share unless it's before 5 & they're offering the lunch-sized portions.  They're still big but definitely scaled down."
jay g.,"Poway, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Arrived at 4 pm, was seated relatively quickly outside, drink order was taken by Laura. Service for drinks and bread was excellent. Meal order taken ,my wife is very specific about her request (Culotte Steak, no seasoning of any kind, Medium Well (""very little pink""), the rest of our family ordered, about 20 minutes later our order came out minus my wife's, Laura said they did not make it right so she was having it remade and would be about 4 minutes. 5 minutes later it was brought out, before my wife could even cut into it Laura was gone. The Steak was well done on the outside, however even 1/4 inch inside it was Medium Raw (yes Raw not rare)  I stopped eating due to being disgusted and upset along with my wife. After 10 minutes of not finding Laura, we asked for a manager, by this time my two sons were finished with their meal, the manager was very flippant about ""ooops, soorrrry, that shouldn't have happened, we can remake it"". My two boys are already finished, the only response was... no thanks were are not interested in waiting another 20 minutes plus. The manager left the table. No one came by the table, not the manager, not the server, we were not sure what we should do....after another 18 minutes Laura came by with the check (minus the two meals - mine and my wifes) and would we like any dessert? (1) Manager doesn't know how to deal with customers, (2) Server should have come back and asked if everything was good or something, especially if there was a special request or she had sent something to be remade. Nothing, nada.  Have had good service and good food at Cheesecake Factory before, but this definitely turned us off."
Teddie T.,"San Diego, CA",43,6,,2.0,11/21/2015,Good food! Lazy service.. At take out five workers didn't say a word to for 10 minutes. While changing shift doesn't mean ignore the customer. Very rude!!
Jeanie D.,"San Diego, CA",26,10,1,4.0,9/20/2012,"Zucchini Yes, Mixed Drinks No!  I really enjoy the food here,  fried zucchini is amazing I usually get blue cheese instead of ranch to dip it.. fettucine alfredo awesome.  Some great chicken dishes to choose from.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but I would love to sometime.    The Cosmos and Lemondrops are too sweet, they use mixes instead of making a real drink, I'm not a fan of it.  Chuck the manager is AMAZING.  There is this sweet little waitress with a little squeaky voice, I absolutely adore her and she is a Great waitress.  Except for the handsome dark haired waiter and the guy with the mowhawk, the rest of the guys that serve there are kind of put out they are working at all. And its always nice and cool in there.  Overall I like it."
Jason P.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",12,5,,5.0,6/16/2014,I can always count on the cheesecake factory to provide excellent service and food.  This is the biggest cheesecake factory i have ever been too. The only downside to it is that there is a small wait and you cannot make reservations.
Yvonne N.,"Sacramento, CA",1409,648,1562,2.0,2/13/2010,"I know there are many, many people out there who are head over heels for Cheesecake Factory but I'm going to stand my ground when I say...it sucks!!!!  And it's not simply because I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake.  The only time I dine here is when I'm forced to go with friends.  Everytime a friend chooses it, I secretly cringe inside. I even had to go for my 21st birthday (for convenience) =[ Bottom line is: I don't appreciate the quality of food I receive for the price I pay!  TCF isn't too expensive but it isn't cheap, either..and the food is sub par. I've had their pastas, steaks and burgers and was always disappointed. The only item I may have enjoyed is their Mandarin Chicken Salad.  My friend ordered their sushi once and actually liked it but I honestly don't trust her judgement, haha. Come on, sushi at Cheesecake Factory?!  I guessssss... My most recent meal was the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, which sounded soooo good!!  Crispy battered shrimp with tomato, mushrooms and arugula with a basil-garlic-lemon creamy sauce!!  But when it came out, I was not impressed.  The batter shrimp would have been better off not battered.  The pasta itself was bland.  I barely ate any of it and took the rest togo.  Surprisingly, it tasted better as leftovers!  However, refrigerating it revealed the hefty amount of oil used, it was pretty gross. The reason for two stars and not one is because I've always received good service. I came to this particular location for a surprise birthday dinner with 30 guests and the staff was very accommodating, nice, patient, and quick. However, I'm sorry but that's the only nice thing I have to say. Haha..."
Teresa F.,"Berkeley, CA",99,186,21,4.0,12/22/2011,"I only come here for group events.. One downside is that they don't take reservations, so you could end up waiting for a very very long time. But it's a fun place to eat, and the servers automatically split up the check which alleviates the problematic splitting of the check, coming up short, etc. Overall, a good experience from the management side.  Obviously, their cheesecakes are pretty good, it IS the cheesecake factory. And they also have a massive selection so even the pickiest eaters can find a cheesecake to their liking. Like their cheesecake selection, their food menu is equally massive. Which is awesome, if you weren't so indecisive (which I am). I ended up getting a chipotle pasta. It turned out really good. Cream base with a touch of chipotle. Very yummy. Unique and delicious. I had a few bites of people's foods here and there, and I liked everything that I tasted. It seems like most of their options are all very creative and good. I was very impressed and would like to try more of their pasta.  Oh and if you haven't already, go google ""Serious eats cheesecake factory."" You will be impressed.. and inspired.  Totally going to come back.. if only the wait wasn't so long.. =/"
Mary J.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,3.0,9/21/2013,"The service is good and the food is also very good and consistent. The wait time , however, makes it impossible to eat here unless you have 3 hours available. That's just too much in my opinion. I also always worry about eating fast when I'm Here because the waiters are always breathing down your neck which makes me feel really rushed."
Ceci Z.,"San Diego, CA",20,342,931,3.0,1/12/2011,"This place is very busy. We waited and drooled over the cheesecake displays for about 45min before getting seated.  To lessen the guilt of having cheesecake while dieting I ordered the Factory burger which had the least amount of calories for an entree. It was really good, the bread had good texture and burger cooked perfectly.  And for the main star of the show, the cheesecakes are delicious.  I had the strawberry cheesecake which was very rich. One of my friends had the godiva which I found is too rich in chocolate, extremely sweet. And another friend got their 30th anniversary cheesecake and it was twice the size of my strawberry one. I find the serving size of the cheesecakes varied a lot but the price is the same for all of them. So if you want good value get the biggest one :D"
Sabrina G.,"San Diego, CA",10,26,9,5.0,5/29/2014,"First time here & food was amazing!!! My husband got the lemon-herb roasted chicken. Which was so good. The chicken was very juicy. I got the crispy chicken costoletta. Also very good. I will definitely be going here more often. The restaurant is very beautiful inside and out. Our servers name was Marshall & he is the best server I've had in a very long time! If any of you can get him to be your server, you will see how attentive he is & very nice. I give this place a 5, service was great, food was great."
Edo V.,"San Diego, CA",27,8,2,3.0,4/2/2013,"meeeh.. Overpriced delicious cheesecakes and they should just stick to making cheese cakes. Big portions but the food was OK, the staff is a hit and miss. For overprice desserts and food the customer service should be a little better."
Annie H.,"San Diego, CA",152,227,54,5.0,12/9/2009,"RED VELVET CHEESECAKE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE RED VELVET CHEESE CAKE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE!!!!!! And some of the money for purchasing one of these goes to Feeding America!  Do yourself a favor, try a piece xoxoxo"
Karena R.,"Jacksonville, FL",97,269,322,3.0,11/8/2012,The Cheesecake is one of my favorite spots. Nothing out of the norm for this one. Good quick service...food was out and hot..service was good... restaurant was nice & clean.
Daniel C.,"San Marcos, CA",65,19,31,5.0,5/12/2015,"I was going to give this place 4 stars due to their always being a wait, but to be honest you cant give this place less than 4-5. The service literally was exceptional. With how busy it is you expect something to lack. I drink a ton and require a ton of refills and they were there prompt every time. I wish I could give her credit but I didn't catch her name. My wife and I took our moms here for Mother's Day. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken, not too spicy and my wife ordered the Fish and Chips. We both enjoyed our food on Sunday as well as the next day at lunch. we also had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake which was ridiculously good. The prices are a little high, but its Fashion Valley and for that area I would say they are just right, especially for the portion size. They do not go light!! Even their bread that they send out with each meal is fresh, warm and moist. Have been here several times amongst the years and will continue to go back. I recommend putting your name in early, go shopping for a while and then coming back to eat. Again if there was one hindrance at all, that be it. Otherwise this place is Gold!!!"
Jennifer H.,"Poway, CA",1,24,,4.0,9/7/2014,"My family was here again today for lunch.  This place is always pack, but today we asked for first available and we got seated in a few minutes in the patio area.  The young man who was leading us to the table was very polite. Our waitress was very nice also. I always got good service here,  except the food,  they were just okay . We passed the cheese cake today.  Good place to eat when you shopping in fashion valley.  They don't take reservation."
Leonard L.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",684,1395,3851,3.0,12/23/2009,"Every time I go to cheesecake factory, I am always amazed by how a restaurant can act so much like a machine.  You provide the host/hostess your name and party number and they give you a wait time and a buzzer thingy.  Then you wait until the buzzer vibrates and you turn in the buzzer thing and wait in line for someone to seat you.  Someone directs you somewhere in the labyrinthine of seating. The waiter takes your drink order.  The bar-back brings you that drink.  The waiter takes your appetizer and/or entrée order.  The food runner brings you your food.  The waiter takes your dessert and actually brings you your dessert and the check.  By this time, you have you have finished a 20 dollar meal in less than an hour (depending on the wait time). The only reason I go to the hell that is cheesecake factory is that I get cravings for the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad which somehow I always call it a buffalo ranch chicken salad by mistake.  The barbeque ranch chicken salad contains 959 calories with 4 grams of fat and 874 milligrams of sodium, which is why it is delicious. Sometime in the future when I having the worst day of my life I will order the following: Factory Nachos with Spicy Chicken = 1931 calories with 62 grams of fat Beer Battered Fish and Chips = 2160 calories with 27 grams of fat   Pasta Carbonara = 2291 calories with 81 grams of fat Bistro shrimp pasta = 2285 calories with 73 grams of fat Morning quesadilla = 2015 calories with 62 grams of fat Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple = 1326 calories with 40 grams of fat My goal is to try to gain 2 pounds in a sitting that only 7,000 calories"
Nicholas M.,"San Diego, CA",15,43,3,4.0,9/29/2014,I like to come here if I'm by the movie theater or shopping in fashion valley. Always slow service always a lot of tourist but the staff is friendly and food is good.
