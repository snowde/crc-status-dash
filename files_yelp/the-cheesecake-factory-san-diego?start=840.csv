Paul P.,"San Diego, CA",90,333,8,3.0,12/11/2011,"Can't really say much that hasn't already been said about the Cheesecake Factory...except that if you are stuck here for a group holiday dinner like my wife and I were, there are some bright spots that will make even Foodies take away something more than a busted gut and a styrofoam container of leftover whatever.  Note the small plate menu. The grilled shishito peppers were terrific: barely blistered, a little spicy, and lightly dusted with sea salt. Just as good as the ones we had a couple months ago in downtown LA at Lazy Ox Canteen.  The arugula salad was fresh and spicy; the vinaigrette dressing was perfect. With the shaved parmesan and raisins, it wasn't terribly avant-garde, but it was most certainly above par given the predominance of otherwise fried and processed food.  Vietnamese tacos - three to an order - were interesting. It consisted of pork on a soft bun shaped like a tortilla and some strips of carrot-based slaw. The lettuce wrap appetizer was enough for two other people at our table to make an entire meal of.  One of those mall restaurants where you are bound to end up one day, even if against your will. Try your best to make the most of it. A $30 bottle of Ravenswood Zinfandel (once the waiter finally brought it) helped. Happy Holidays from the MALL!  thank you!"
Jon J.,"San Diego, CA",0,54,3,3.0,3/2/2013,"Service was slow, which is unusual because every other cheesecake I've been to it's never been a problem, and usually exceptional. And why does it take the busers so long to turn over tables?  I literally saw dirty tables sit for five minutes after patrons were done eating, and we were standing there, waiting?? I ordered spring rolls, and all other CF's give you four to a plate.  This place serves three.  I brought it up to the waiter, and he tried to dance around it, and make a joke of it. He didn't say, "" let me look into it, and I'll be right back,"" or, "" let me check with the kitchen,"" nothing. Save yourself the headache, and patronize elsewhere.  I know I will."
Kat D.,"San Diego, CA",84,13,,3.0,6/2/2013,"I've been there a totally of 3 times and each time I tried something different. Honestly, they're alright. Not the best thing I've ever had but if I'm hungry and I want something filling I'll go there. The first time I went I got their red velvet cheesecake and it was really rich. It was good though and I liked it. The second time I went there I had a burger, I forgot what it was called but it had onion crisps in it and I was craving a cheese burger. Not the greatest thing in the world, but it was pretty good. I got it medium rare and asked for no grilled onions in it, but I got it anyways. I don't mind taking it out, but I'd rather not waste food like that. The third time I went I got their fettucini alfredo with chicken. Not a whole lot of chicken, like a few pieces and the noodle tasted like it wasn't fully cooked? The noodles weren't soft, they were a little hard. The sauce was really rich though. Overall the service was good, our waiters were nice. The food overall is alright and the price is a little high. I'd probably eat there like once or twice a year."
Jessie F.,"San Diego, CA",15,5,,1.0,6/2/2012,"This was my third and final attempt to enjoy a cheesecake factory restaurant.  It was unsuccessful. Where to begin.  Let's start with the location.  At an overcrowded mall, the restaurant feels more like an auction house than a restaurant.  The place isn't really designed to handle nearly as many people as they seem to have on a regular basis.  As a result our party of 8 (6 adults 2 children)  was forced to stand for an hour while we awaited a table.  They do not take reservations, which we had tried to secure earlier in the day, even for large parties.  They also required managerial approval in order to combine two tables to make room for our party, which meant even getting in line took over 5 minutes.  To call this place crowded is an understatement, and to call them prepared for the amount of patrons would be a bold faced lie. So after our long wait, we were called to the front desk which had people packed around it as if it were a mosh pit, it took another 5 minutes to be seated by the hostess who wasn't quite ready for us apparently, and when we were finally seated it took another 5 minutes for our waiter to arrive and take our drink order.  Our drinks arrived without straws, which it seemed they had been rationing out to only about half of the patrons.  I ordered a Pomegranate Mojito just to tolerate the place at this point, luckily it came with a straw.  The Mojito was tolerable, it tasted watered down and was far from actually impressive, and I had no desire to order another.   Fifteen minutes later our waitress finally returned to take our order, which I'd decided on over 10 minutes earlier.  I've eaten here twice before and on both occasions I tried their seafood and wound up having food poisoning shortly thereafter, so I decided to play it safe and try to order something which I could imagine they actually couldn't screw up.  I went with a Hawaiian pizza, which has ham, pineapple, and red onions on it (literally the only ingredients) and when I ordered it the waitress informed me that it had red onions on it, just in case I wasn't capable of reading the three ingredients in the item I ordered. after another 25 minutes or so, our food began arriving in pieces, and I do mean in pieces... salad dressing for a salad here, a grilled cheese sandwich there.  When my food did arrive most of the glasses at the table were empty, and the only one which I was offered to have refilled was the Mojito, I had to request the other.  My food was serviceable, but unimpressive.  The pasta's I've tried have had the same effect, and I really don't find anything special about their food at all, especially for the price they charge for it.  I can rattle off many great restaurants around SD that have far better food for far less, but I digress.  The verdict on the pizza:  Like everything I've seen here, it seemed designed for the fattest person imaginable, Almost no pineapple on the pizza, however it was smothered in ham, so much so that I wound up picking pieces of it off to ensure I could even taste the cheese.  After completing my meal I decided to bypass dessert, which I've had before (the cheesecakes are quite overrated, other than their enormous size there's nothing spectacular about them) and asked for my check.   I was informed that they would only split the check one time, which meant I had to remain at the table until after everyone at the table had finished ordering, which included dessert, which I found to be wildly lazy and unprofessional.  For the prices at this place, I should receive better service than what I could expect at a cheap diner.  I patiently waited for my check; however.   Everyone ordered their desserts and they all arrived before the waiter even returned to see how the bill would be split, instead of splitting it after taking their order, knowing I wished to leave. When i received my bill there was an %18 gratuity automatically added, which explained my outrageous service and why they could care less.  At no point during the meal did they ask about my meal or how the food was.  Other than delivering our items, or asking for the next course, I did not see our waitress at all.  And I was thoroughly disappointed with the restaurant AGAIN.  And finally my bill came to over $70 for food which I would expect to find in any drive in diner in the midwest. The cream of the trip; however, is that last night, once again, just like my previous 2 visits, I spent most of my evening sprinting from my bed to vomit with an upset stomach.  This was my last attempt at tolerating the Cheesecake Factory and I will not be returning.  I would honestly rather eat fast food."
Nikki M.,"La Jolla, CA",128,39,10,1.0,5/10/2015,"Wow.HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I was hoping to cheer up a friend who just had a family emergency and was disappointed by the complete lack of regard this place has for their patrons. For starters I called ahead to order curbside so I could save time. I was placed on hold and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. I waited so long I was actually able to drive all the way to the restaurant before anyone ever picked up. On arrival, and as I was still on hold I saw and heard a manager, FINALLY pick up. I could hear him but he could not could hear me well as the check in area is loud with background noise and music. I tap him on the should and show him my phone saying, ""you don't have to take my curbside order now as I've been on hold for close to 20 MINUTES and was able to drive here!!!"" Does he apologize and proceed to help me? Absolutely not. He says, oh sorry they can help you 'over there' as he points me to a register near the cheesecakes which has a line of 9 people in it. I'm beyond annoyed at this point but am already here and want to make my friend happy as she likes their calamari. So I wait an ADDITIONAL 20 minutes in the line to order and ask at that time for the location general managers name. I was was told by the polite cashier that she would bring it to me. Surprise - she didn't. The variety and quality of food is good but the lack of organization and level of service unfortunately overrides any positive experience one could have here. Mistakes will happen but when they do, it's how you handle them that counts. While having this awful dining experience I had plenty of time to write this review. It's what happens when you DON'T care enough to properly take care of your customers. Goodbye Cheesecake Factory, you just lost a long time patron. (Not that you'd even notice)."
Nicole G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,24,4,4.0,7/15/2015,"Clean nice atmosphere a little pricy as expected. Sat at the bar and got incredible service from Leah she made sure drinks were full and we were tended to accordingly. Appetizer was greasier than we hoped but still good. Beer was cold lemonade was fresh but best impression and reason for yelp was my bar service. Even as it got busy this young lady was calm and very friendly and polite. A keeper for sure, truly setting the bar."
Starlyn T.,"Union City, NJ",70,50,25,5.0,9/10/2012,"Waiting time? Long however.. outside they have this ""heatlamps"" so u don't get cold or anything and seats. I went with 3 friends and chat while wait, I took some pictures cause the area is very beautiful palms etc and lights in the walls. Well I never been in cheesecake factory so I thought this was a candy store lol. My friends who been there before order salads and I was like hmm no I want meat. But when they received their salads I wanted to change they give a lot! I mean like a mountain of delicious salads, the meat was perfect too and the mashed potatoes heavenly. I always order lemonade everywhere I go to find were they use real lemons this place do. Great experience!"
Jen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",202,696,50,1.0,12/5/2011,"If you don't like disappointment in a cup, then DO NOT get a latte here.  My buddy works at Fashion Valley, and I was waiting to give him a ride at 11PM. Cheesecake Factory was the only thing opened, so I asked for a latte and sat on the patio.  I paid around $5 for it, and it tasted like shitty disappointment. I have had better lattes at gas stations, no joke.  Before I sat down, I asked the guy at the bakery counter if the restaurant served healthy food...you know...stuff under 400 calories. He said no. So I was sitting on the patio with my shitty latte, and decided to look at their menu on my Droid. They had humus, beets with goat cheese, and edamame. This stupid fool didn't even know the contents of the menu at the place that employs him.  Also, this place seems to be a hang-out spot for loud, obnoxious teens. It must have been date night, or something. They were everywhere, and I actually had to go to my car and get my iPod so I could drown out their idiocy.  If these fools can't even make a latte or learn their own menu, then their food must be equally bad or worse. Chain restaurants suck anyway, so I will NOT go here EVER again."
Nina K.,"San Diego, CA",112,36,,5.0,10/31/2011,"Atmosphere - loud, but in a enjoyable, social way. The lighting is perfect for get togethers with friends or a date night out. Service - outstanding! Cleanliness - great Food - yum, yum. yum. I had the chopped salad. My friend had a burger. My cousin had two appetizers: egg rolls and sliders. We're all in agreement that the meals were excellent. The cheesecake is just great. Terrific location to eat!"
Ken K.,"Treasure Island, Tampa Bay, FL",145,333,54,2.0,10/6/2012,"I have experienced a few Cheesecake Factory locations in the past. Food took 35 minutes to arrive,  and my meal was delivered 10 minutes later than than the others at the table. 45 minutes at lunch is just NOT acceptable. We didn't say anything, as it was a business lunch, near our hotel. Manager must have been aware, as he did come by to apologize, but charged us (and me) full price anyway. It was a four top table....not a large group, and there were only 3 of us at the table.  They were busy, and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated....no big deal...it was a Monday 10/1/2012 - Noise level is high in the place when this busy. I had Huevos Rancheros for lunch.  Tortillas it was served upon were soggy.  Recipe needs some work, and it was not what I expected. The eggs were cooked as ordered, and the sauce was just OK, overall I would describe my meal as below average.  Suggest you try something different.  My colleagues meals were about average.    This Cheesecake Factory location is busy....it has to be the location....and the kitchen is not really up to par.... they had obvious difficulty handling the load of diners. If you have that many seats, in a high traffic restaurant, you better be prepared to handle a crowd.   I will choose another restaurant when in the Town & Country area of San Diego next time, and you should too. In my opinion, this is a poorly managed location."
Jake M.,"San Diego, CA",5,40,132,2.0,11/25/2013,"Usually, CF does a pretty good job.  But CF at this location was not very good at all. The service started off pretty good, with the waitress refilling drinks and checking on us.  But once we got our food, she was done.  Maybe she was embarrassed for being forced to serve us such a lousy meal. My wife ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and it arrived with the main ingredients buried in the styrofoamy rice noodle things.  Which I enjoy, but it did make you wonder why they put so many on.  Well, once you got down to the salad you could see why.  It was just a bunch of sad, sad, wilted lettuce.  We should have sent it right back but I guess we prefer to be passive aggressive and Yelp about it later.  The wife gave it the ol college try, but it was so lacking in flavor that she had to give up.  She compared it to eating water logged lettuce.  I tried it and would have to agree.  Not much flavor and just a horrible consistency.   I ordered the Pit Beef sandwich, which was alright.  But the horseradish sauce, (which is what I was really looking forward to) was really just mayo that might have been on the shelf next to horseradish at one point.  No flavor at all. Their bread, as always was awesome!   But the really disappointing food and lack of service once the food arrived really left a bad taste in my mouth."
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2246,2841,1478,4.0,1/16/2010,"It's always hard rating a chain because these days, they're awfully consistent for the most part. This one is always busy, it's in a touristy shopping area of San Diego. Parking can therefore be a challenge. The good news is that there's a mall right there with some very good stores, so it you have to wait half an hour, pop into A/X or Journeys and check out the sales. Time will pass fast enough. We were seated promptly and our server was attentive but didn't overdo it. The food was very good. We ordered the cheesecake first and then the entrees, because we're adults and our mothers weren't there to scold us. Awesome. A bit pricey, but always tasty. And really if you're responsible you'll bring home leftovers because, damn, they have big portions."
Amicus S.,"San Diego, CA",88,176,60,4.0,9/25/2012,"Judgmental Hospitality Student Quick Analysis: I have been here a few times for their burgers with cheesecake for dessert. The combination deserves kudos for their burgers are delicious, probably ranked within top 10 burgers in san diego, and of course their cheesecake is ranked best in san diego. Service delivers and they have many boots on the ground to answer any question you have. If you are looking for a place to eat in the area, go here."
Nhu N.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",674,245,863,1.0,9/22/2013,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! First of all the bread that came out was extremely stale and hard. I couldn't even bite it! Second of all, I ordered a Louisiana chicken pasta and when it came out, it was also stale and chewy with no taste whatsoever! The server, Michael rarely came to ask us how we're doing. I waited 10 minutes to get another server to help us. He told us he'll get our server for the complaint but nope, never did. Our server finally passed by but didn't even help us until I had to scream ""excuse me"". He got the manager and said he will get me another pasta. We waited for our pasta but our server already brought the check out so I informed him that the manager said I will be getting my pasta. Turns out the server ""thought"" I cancelled that entree. They didn't even reimburse us for a horrible experience!! I was just so surprised how such a nice restaurant has such horrible service and organization. Disappointed..."
Phil U.,"Hesperia, CA",31,17,,1.0,7/13/2012,"I can only rate the drinks. I've been here an hour and forty five minutes and still waiting for food. ON A TUESDAY!!! Manager, Chris, is unprofessional and pretentious and staff follows suit. Ridiculous, I've waited less time in Hells Kitchen!!!!!!!!!! Food was delicious once it finally arrived.  Service remained subpar and RUDE.  Not comming back and neither should anyone else."
Claudia C.,"La Jolla, CA",22,388,427,4.0,9/4/2012,"Of course I am a fan of this restaurant. What is there not to love? Oh wait! The acrual waiting and waiting for hours to get your table. But if you go after rush lunch hours or right before dinner, I guarantee solid food and service for very reasonable prices. I really love to ask for different dressings with the salad that I usually get and they have never charged extra, the portions used to be huge; now they are still on the large side but are totally manageable. I must say that their hostess need to learn manners, because it is so busy, they often act like they really dont need or care about you being there; however, the servers and the rest of the staff are friendly (I have yet to have a bad experience). The food of course is not gourmet, but the flavors are way better thank your average chain restaurant. The chicken madeira is good, the pasta with shrimp is also pretty good, the chicken marsalla is also a must have. Also, try the Navajo sandwich (huge) and their thai lettuce wraps.  I have rarely made it to dessert, but I usually have the plain cheesecake or the carrot cake. All in all a pretty good option for a restaurant in a mall, good for groups becuase of the many many items on their menu -beware because it can get pretty dang loud.....oh, and there are only 3 bathroom stalls which I find totally icky given the size of the restaurant."
Sarah K.,"Redmond, WA",339,438,75,5.0,11/23/2011,"Myself and two other ladies who moved over here around the same time as me try to meet up for lunch once a week or so. One week we decided to go to the Fashion Valley mall, we first went to the Cheesecake factory.  We were seated straight away, the place was clean and the decor was nice. Knowing that the cheesecake portions were huge I had an appetizer rather than entree prior to my cheesecake. The entree I had was Southwest Eggrolls. The eggrolls were full of flavour. Still enormous!  The cheesecake I tried this time was the White chocolate raspberry truffle. I have to admit this was not a favourite. I should picked a more chocolatey one or gone for the peanut butter one. The server was helpful and friendly. Good experience and good time had."
Leslie C.,"Concord, CA",60,147,27,4.0,4/1/2012,"Ahhh yes, the Cheesecake Factory. Relatively high on my list just because it's reliable (they're everywhere!), even the pickiest of eaters can find something to eat (their menu is like a novel), and the servers are always friendly. Same story at this location. We had to wait about 45 minutes for our table but that was ok since we had a large party and, to be honest, I was expecting longer since it was Saturday night. Our server was very accommodating of our wanting to split some plates, getting separate checks, and some of our party coming late. Props to her.  Two tips for anyone who hasn't yet been to a Cheesecake Factory: 1. These plates are ginormous. Don't believe me at your own peril. I always eat half of my entree and save the rest for lunch the next day. I suggest ordering something that re-heats well. 2. Don't be a dumbass, order the cheesecake. Trust me, it's pretty damn delicious and there are like 20 kinds, literally. I recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo, while one of my best friends swears by the Dulce de Leche. You likely won't be able to finish but no worries, they have special boxes just for that purpose ;)"
