Larry H.,"San Diego, CA",1,50,105,2.0,7/11/2015,"Tonight, 7/11/15 might be one of the saddest nights of my life. Cheesecake Factory Fashion Valley may have jumped the Shark! I brought the family down from Temecula because they were stupid enough not to add one to the mall there. We ordered our favorite dish Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken and was very un impressed.  The flavor was way off, no bang bang at all and gross peas that weren't there before. Where's the green onion and the peanut flavor and the spice? Not to mention lack of chicken and shrimp, mostly rice for $18. Did your cook skip out for the night? Our waiter said he was going to mention this to the GM who he said happened to be there tonight,  but he didn't even pay us a visit? My kids ordered off the small bites menu and had a similar experience. I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL AT CCF until now. Something changed at this location and I hope they fix it because we were not happy. Of course the cheesecake is still good but that's only part of the experience. The prices have gone up as well so higher prices and bad meals equals.....well they just need to fix this because this is unacceptable for Cheesecake Factory....."
Nane S.,"Garden Grove, CA",56,146,198,3.0,5/26/2014,"Went to visit my parents in San Diego and they decided on The Cheesecake Factory because they have never tried it. They have lots of food to choose from, Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. We ordered majority of our food from their new skinnylicious menu. Everything came out perfect. The only complaint was the service was really slow, they never came to refill our drinks or check on us."
Kristin B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",236,802,7220,5.0,8/11/2011,"The seemingly always present waiting groups of people outside this place is usually a deterrent, but my boyfriend and I hit up this conveniently located Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch on Sunday after an afternoon at Fashion Valley Mall.  Surprisingly, our wait was under the estimated 10 minutes despite the loads of people inside and out. I'd only been to one Cheesecake Factory location previously, in Pittsburgh, and really enjoyed the overall experience.  I have no problem giving good restaurant chains credit when credit is due, and Cheesecake Factory definitely falls into the Good Chains category for me. The perfectly medium-rare greasy Wild Mushroom Burger I ordered was hefty and wonderful--the second-best burger (behind Bare Back Grill) I've ever had in San Diego, actually.  I couldn't get enough of it.  Though in my heart I really wanted to spend an extra buck to choose sweet potato fries as my burger's side I opted for the side salad instead, which was nicely dressed and a generous portion.  Everything about my meal was top-notch, and my boyfriend was equally happy with his Memphis Burger. Prior to being seated while we'd briefly waited in line, we'd drooled over the numerous cheesecakes displayed in the glass cases up front.  I quickly decided to have a slice of the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, which our really nice waitress later explained is the most popular relatively new cheesecake available.  My guy wanted something really rich and chocolaty had a tough time making up his mind; with the help of our waitress, he ultimately decided on the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake.  Monster slices of our chosen cheesecakes arrived after we finished our burgers, and we gleefully slipped into cheesecake-induced comas.  Duh, I know this place is called The Cheesecake Factory, but, regardless, the cheesecakes were even better than they looked--my cheesecake photos didn't turn out very well, by the way--and even better than I'd anticipated.  Truly phenomenal.  I've thought about those cheesecakes a whole lot since Sunday. A perfect meal topped off with perfect cheesecake.  My belly and I couldn't have been happier."
Jim D.,"San Diego, CA",3,55,,5.0,3/1/2012,"They turned a negative experience into a positive one.  Very nicely done. I was with two work colleagues and they messed up my order.  The manager walked over, explained that they had sent my meal to the wrong table, and they were now having to cook me a new meal.  I appreciated his honestly.  He apologized, told me I wouldn't have to pay for my meal, and then asked if he could bring me anything else on the house.  The free beer made it a lot easier to wait the extra 5-7 minutes for my meal.   All in all, I always admire when a company goes out of their way to make something right.  We all make mistakes.  What counts is how you handle it.  Bravo."
Cristina C.,"La Mesa, CA",2,8,3,5.0,8/25/2015,Great restaurant . The food is always fresh and very well done. The pies are excellent and we can not resist. The restrooms are clean and the waiters are very friendly. One of my favorites places to eat. I high recommend it!
Megan M.,"Alexandria, VA",37,56,87,3.0,6/21/2014,"I'm not a big fan of the food at the Cheesecake Factory. I can never seem to find meal that actually tastes delicious. Everything is mediocre. Perhaps the menu is too extensive to actually hone in on the meals that the chefs are good at preparing. I love the desserts- cheesecake! Can't go wrong with the Oreo or red velvet favors. I have never had an issue with the customer service at this Fashion Valley location. However, this location is very busy and it can be a pain to find parking at times."
Katherine S.,"Riverside, CA",128,481,116,4.0,9/7/2012,"I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner here last week. I used to think the the Cheesecake Factory was only unhealthy food in giant portions. However, when I was here last week, an AWESOME salmon dish with brown rice that was not only tasty, but relatively healthy as well.  It was nice to see that this place can have food that is tasty without being horrible for you. Our waiter was also super nice, and extremely helpful about giving order suggestions and getting our food out quickly.  I will absolutely go back asap"
Jennifer H.,"La Mesa, CA",41,22,1,2.0,7/30/2015,"Very disappointed with the service! I have gone here several times but the last few times have been horrid. I understand that it is a busy location but when I say I'm disappointed in the service it isn't the wait that is an issue but the way the servers treat you. First on the phone they are extremely rude, like it is inconvenient to them to have to answer you questions. Then today I ordered curbside pick up. I was told on the phone that it would be 20 mins. I only ordered 3 slices of cheesecake. I waited and got to the restaurant about 25 mins later. Then waited 25 mins and called 2 times to find out what the hold up was. There were 3 other cars that got served before I finally walked inside to find out what was going on. I was then rudely told that I had to wait at least another 20-30 mins before I would be served. Why didn't she come out and tell me knowing that I was out there waiting. When I called to cancel the order, mostly cause I didn't want to go back and talk to her, I waited on hold for 10 mins before I hung up. Definitely won't be going back anytime soon. They need to get new servers or at least teach them the importance of customer service."
Tom N.,"San Diego, CA",62,29,29,5.0,2/20/2014,"You can tell that this place has an exceptionally high standard for quality food and service. This is a corporate model to follow. Most corporate chains lose quality in all areas but not this one. In fact, I am so impressed with the food and the service and the level of expertise among the staff and management that I once asked our server if she had to go to special training just to work there because that is how good everything was. Her answer was ""Yes"". In fact, she said they had to train for almost one month! Let me tell you, it shows! The Mango Lime Cheesecake is also among my all time favorite desserts I have EVER tasted! Thumbs way high up!"
Boyjie V.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/20/2015,This place is the worst. Staff is to fuckin slow. We waited for 1 hour what's funny is there is plenty of vacant seat..
Oreo C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",28,179,24,4.0,9/21/2012,"Cheesecake factory has never really disappointed me or my gf for all the visits at different locations we've been there. One of our favorites is the Avocado spring rolls. This is where I tried most of cheesecake factory's menu. They have a huge selection and you can try something new every time for quite a while before it gets old. They can even take special requests on the pastas with respect to the sauces and mix and match. They do give big portions though, beware. :)"
Alana N.,"San Diego, CA",28,88,118,4.0,5/1/2012,"We went in at about am hour before they closed (midnight!) and there was no disgruntled waiters because of the fact. The service was amazing, sat at a small two person table at first but were moved to a booth as soon as one was open as the waiter could see our discomfort.  The portions were huge and delicious my boyfriends steak was cooked perfect , the shrimp in my pasta was overcooked but other than that the service was great and the drinks are pretty good as well! We will be returning to this location soon!"
Ali S.,"Denver, CO",0,7,,2.0,9/17/2014,the food is ok here but the prices are extraordinary for the lunch you get. The service was not there. I had always to walk around to find the server. We asked for extra bread and the server didn't bring it. We asked for coffee refill and the server didn't do it the first time. We had to ask  one more time. We had spaghetti carbonara for 11.95 and it was just very small portion and a chicken dish with angel hair  and the sauce was awful. I would not recommend this location
Leticia B.,"Descanso, CA",6,104,7,5.0,1/7/2014,"We went there two days ago because we had received a gift certificate for Christmas. I ordered the fish tacos, husband ordered the club sandwich. No complaints from this part. We also ordered the nachos appetizer and everything was divine. Let me tell you, the nachos were the bomb!. Avocado was so fresh and chips were crispy.The fish tacos were excellent and the hubs enjoyed his club sandwich. Their strawberry lemonades are so good. Will be going back there as soon as I can. Service was pretty good too."
Dave W.,"San Diego, CA",113,191,12,3.0,8/24/2012,"Let me start off with the fact that I don't like Cheesecake Factory, until recently. The last time that I was here was a few months to a year after this place opened. I thought the place was way overrated, the menu was small, prices were high, and the food was mediocre at the time.  Service: It was definitely a whole lot better than before. There were people overflowing out the door waiting for a table. I put in my reservation for 2 and the wait was roughly 30 so they say. I took a walk around the mall and came back and to my surprise the line disseminated. We got a seat right away and the service pleasant. Food: The food was surprisingly delicious. Ordered the Chicken Samosas and to my surprise it was very tastely and wasn't too americanized from the traditional samosas. This version has just a hint of curry, enough to tantalize the tongue. I had the meatloaf entree and it was surpisingly hearty and good. There was 3 one-inch slices of meatloaf with a side of corn veggie medley and mashed potatoes.  Drinks: I just had water, but they serve beer and wine too. Overall:  To my surprise I have been rejuvenated that this restaurant chain made a complete 180 from its opening days. This place use to be an overrated joint serving over-priced salads, pastas, and entrees. Its a whole lot better now with better food, portions, and ambiance. Not too shabby. Its still not a place I would come to daily, but wouldn't mind or complain about if I had to come here."
Jesus L.,"San Diego, CA",30,7,3,1.0,1/9/2014,"bye far the most disappointing meal i've had a restaurant. i was told to come check this place out since i have a bit of a sweet tooth. im usually not one to give out reviews and i usually keep things to myself but i created this yelp account specifically to say this was extremely dissatisfying.  AT ARRIVAL: the wait time was 15 minutes which seemed like a good start, until i realized once i walked in that there were empty tables.. once there our waitress did an excellent job attending us.  THE WAIT: its normal to wait 15-20 minutes for a meal at a restaurant. i didnt mind until i realized 40 minutes had passed. my date and i were about to leave when the food arrived.  THE FOOD: the food came in COLD. a HOT PLATE SERVED COLD???? the meat was rubbery and the rice was poorly made. the macaroni was interesting since i was expecting mac n cheese when i ordered it but it was four balls of cheese. i thought that was the best part. the waitress saw i wasn't eating my meal and tried to fix it. she was very kind yet i could not hide the disappointment. once our cheesecake arrived i figured its the cheesecake factory, at the least these will be great. the cheesecake was dry and hard.  THE BILL: after the most disgusting food i received the bill of $80 for our meal. personally i don't care of the price when i dine out IF I ENJOYED MY MEAL. Before leaving i made sure to ask the kind waitress if the tip would be directly to her before giving anything because i don't know whats going on in that kitchen but no one deserved money. had i not been on a date i would have never paid."
Deb G.,"Crest, CA",73,339,3,2.0,12/10/2012,Where should I start...Service was SLOW thank goodness I asked for water and tea which I asked for no lemon and guess what was in my tea.  I think they made our food from scratch because it took forever and a day to get our meals.  Our server wasn't that friendly she gave off the attitude that she had to be there to make rent and bills.  I ask for extra cucumbers in my salad and I got one thin slice which doesn't qualify in my book as extra cucumbers.   This place is off my list for date night potentials or any future lunches with friends.
Jasmine O.,"Winter Gardens, San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/18/2014,"I've been to the cheese cake factory before my recent vist and was satisfied, not amazing but enough for me to come back at my grandmas request. This visit started well with quick seating but after we had ordered it took an hour to get our food. As I was waiting I realized that all the ethnic groups that weren't white were together in one area as to keep us away from white people. The fact they would segregate us sickened me but I was so hungry when the food came I still ate. The food could have been a lot better. I had the four cheese pasta and its very hard to mess that up but they found a way to. For the price the quality should be extremely better. I will never go there again and I advise you to do the same."
Professor G.,"San Diego, CA",1,2,,1.0,8/7/2011,"I am NEVER going back to this place again after how rude the waitress treated me. I am a big beautiful full-figured Afrocan American woman. I may weigh 350 lbs, but I can shake my hips better than Shakira.    The waitress gave me a disgusted look when I told her that I would be dining by myself in this fine establishment.  And to my surprise, she gave me a huge booth to sit on. I know I am a BBW, but i could have easily fit on one or two of those pull-out chairs. So after I sit down and catch my breath, I ordered some sliders and chicken wings for appetizers.  After finishing the appetizers, I was ready to place my order. Since I am trying to watch my figure, I ordered the weight management salad.  When I done told the waitress what I wanted, she didn't have to yell it out loud so that everybody can hear what I done ordered. She was like ""SO YOU WANT THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SALAD? DO YOU JUST WANT ONE OR FIVE OF THEM?""  That was completely uncalled for and just plain rude.  So after I finished eating the 5 salads, along with 2 bottles of ranch, I felt pretty proud of myself. I have been on this diet for a while and am sticking to it. I know one day I will have the body of Beyonce.  I ordered an entire cheesecake, but I did most definitely NOT splurge and eat the entire thing. I cut out a small piece for my suga-boo that is coming over tonight. I am just thoughtful like that I guess. But anyways, I am never going to Cheesecake Factory ever again. I paid my bill, and I did not leave a tip because of how rude they was."
Glen G.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/11/2015,"I've been frequenting the Cheesecake Factory and routinely order the carrot cake and some type of chocolate cheesecake. That has ended!  If you are into the taste of lemon,  you must order their lemon meringue cheesecake / you will not be disappointed. The service is always great -the atmosphere is always great - and I'll see you on the next visit."
