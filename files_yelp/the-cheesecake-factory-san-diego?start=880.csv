Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",283,583,90,1.0,11/24/2009,"Average but OVERPRICED food and subpar service.  I HATE going to Cheesecake Factory, but a few friends talked me into giving this location a chance.  We (as in 19 friends and I) went to CCF for my birthday dinner last Friday.  We were slapped with an 18% gratuity, which I don't mind.. EXCEPT our waitress wasn't really present.  She forgot a bunch of drinks, didn't refill a bunch of other ones.. and when she packed my food to go, she I guess was too lazy to properly close the box.  The mashed potatoes fell out of one box, and the gravy fell out of another. Side note: this is what I've seen w/CCF.  All the waiters/waitresses I've encountered rarely give service to big groups..maybe bc they feel like they don't need to earn the 18%?  Idk. So why am I rating this location 1 star?  Because my boyfriend paid for my share and his.  He put $66 on his card.  He just checked his billing statement, and CCF charged him $66 not once, not twice, but THREE times.  How does someone make a mistake like that?!! 1 star for their passion fruit mojito.  Yum.  I love being 21 ;]"
Krystle S.,"San Diego, CA",165,174,94,4.0,1/2/2012,"There are a few reasons cheesecake factory is not getting 5 stars from me. There not the best place I've ever ate, there prices are a little too expensive and the wait times are crazy! I'm not saying there food is not good it's just not great! This place is somewhere you go for a birthday or anniversary not an everyday place unless your rich then to each is own. There red velvet cheesecake is very good and fattening :) if you happen to go here just don't eat the whole day!"
Alice M.,"San Diego, CA",3,36,5,5.0,10/8/2013,"I've been going here regularly for 5 years now, I have only had slow service once or twice and horribly slow service one time.   So 3 bad times out of dozens of times with great service ain't exactly bad.   Out of allllll the dishes I've had the only one that did nothing for me was the cob salad but hey I was dieting and planning on blandness. I'm sad that the Cheesecake Factory got rid of the chocolate coconut cheesecake because it was one of my favorites but at least the new s'mores one is amazing.   Also you have to try their hot fudge sundaes."
Miriam R.,"Union City, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/3/2015,"The waiter was nice, and also we got more bread than expected so even better! However, there was no high chairs available, which sucked because my niece had to sit inside the booth with me(which is really unsafe). I ordered the orange chicken, which was kind of soggy and wasn't as good as I've gotten it in the past. Last but not least, my experience here could have been better!"
Lucia O.,"Chula Vista, CA",128,152,89,4.0,1/30/2014,"Can't go wrong here! Came here most recently for a birthday lunch with co-workers. There were 8 of us and I was glad we were seated at a round table, easier to carry on a conversation and include everyone. I'm super picky about lemonade and theirs was perfect; not too sweet. Food was amazing. Service was very good. They know what they're doing here."
Anura R.,"San Diego, CA",5,36,,4.0,4/13/2012,"Crowded is the best word to describe this particular Cheesecake Factory. No matter the time or day you will usually have to wait five to twenty minutes to be seated. The fact that its always packed to the brim is really my one issue with going here.  The food is good enough, the portions are gigantic (especially the cheesecakes themselves), and the menu is varied enough that almost everyone can find something to order. That said, go when you're hungry or else you'll have leftovers for a week.  The servers are, for the most part, friendly despite the fact that they are always rushing around to accommodate everyone in their sections, and there's a fifty/fifty chance that you'll wind up with one of the really sweet, talkative waitresses.  The fact that the restaurant is attached to Fashion Valley mall means that parking is almost always ample, I recommend the parking garage directly West of the main entrance or the lot just East of the front doors.  I've mixed feelings regarding the atmosphere. While I enjoy dimly lit restaurants and having barriers separating the main dining areas I hate noise, and with so many people eating here all the time noise is unavoidable. The barriers help to cut down on the cacophony, however it's still a slight annoyance.  Cheesecake Factory is exactly what you would expect from the name, efficient, tasty and filled to bursting with hungry people."
Lea J.,"San Diego, CA",146,92,1031,3.0,5/22/2012,Ordered the turkey BLT on the skinny-licious menu and it satisfied my hunger with a side of onion rings to balance the healthy to unhealthy ratio out. The lemon raspberry cheesecake though--- ended the meal on a whole other level. Almost made me a non-chocolate dessert seeking convert--- ALMOST.
Kareem M.,"San Diego, CA",6,3,,4.0,6/13/2012,"The Cheesecake factory in Fashion Valley is definitely one of my all time favorites. The location is very convenient as it is situated right next to the Fashion Valley Mall. Parking is rarely an issue unless the mall is full; usually on Saturdays is when it is most packed. I have to say the variety of food they have is astonishing however I must say that my most favorite dish is the Tomato Basil Pasta. The sauce is delicious and the pasta could not be prepared any better.  The only downside to this place is that they do not take reservations and the place is usually crazy busy on the weekends, so it would be wise to plan accordingly unless you are planning on waiting for a minimum of 45 minutes for a table. I also must add that the customer service is amazing and the servers take great care in assuring the customers satisfaction. Definitely recommend checking the place out for couples, families and even if you're in the area and just want to try some amazing food. Highly recommended!!!"
Chris S.,"San Diego, CA",19,56,,5.0,3/23/2014,"Sat at the bar today and Josh ""B"" was our bartender, wow, what a professional!  Service was top notch and his work ethic was unlike most bartenders anywhere!  I am in the industry and was amazed at his level of professionalism and invite anyone to go in and watch how this guy works, he is amazing!"
Srey K.,"San Diego, CA",2,15,,1.0,7/2/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite places to dine in for over 11 years, I've always had amazing service in the Seattle and Bellevue locations (the main reason why I keep coming back) but today the service was lacking. I ordered miso salmon and my rice was half uncooked. The waitress replaced the rice for me saying it was a new batch, and yet every bite there was several raw hard pieces of rice! (I even picked out the uncooked rice pieces to show her) I have ordered this dish countless times and this has never happened, I ended up packing just the salmon to go (will eat it with my own rice at home). The manager came by to say sorry and if she can replace the white rice with brown rice (what!?) I don't want to keep on tasting their uncooked rice as I am pregnant and I do not approve of my baby to continue to consume uncooked rice, but that's basically it. At the other Cheesecake Factory locations they would have replaced the dish to a different one or give us a complimentary dessert. This location is not at all up to the standard Cheesecake Factory service. Goodbye Cheesecake Factory, my family and I will never come back again. There are other great restaurants out there with amazing food and customer service that I will be gladly give them my money from now on!"
Sarah V.,"Carlsbad, CA",94,56,26,1.0,11/2/2012,"I live 20 minutes from this location.  I called to place an order when I left my house.  Three calls later (2 for curbside ordering and the 3rd for a manager--all calls that were put on hold but never answered), I am now in the parking lot and I still haven't spoken to anyone who will take my order.  It's 9pm and the restaurant is half empty.  Let's see how long I get to wait for two desserts now.  Ridiculous. Update:  it took 40 MINUTES in the parking lot to get the desserts.  The manager comped them which was nice, then said ""You know, this happens.""  Not what you want to tell your customers who are already ticked off."
Andrew P.,"San Marcos, CA",124,448,15,3.0,6/18/2012,"As others have said - HUGE portions, and a ridiculously large menu to boot.  There are food options for everybody which is nice, however, it seems to hurt the quality of the food a bit - all of the food is very average.  I got the BBQ Salmon - the salmon wasn't bad, but the BBQ sauce was very bland... definitely would not order again.  The service wasn't terrible... the waiter was very friendly, and was pretty good about keeping drinks topped up.  My only complaint with the service is that we had 8 people in our party, and everybody else got their food before me - mine came over 5 minutes later. When they finally brought it out the first time, it wasn't even close to what I ordered... finally, after another 5 minutes, my food finally showed up.  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here."
Noel I.,"San Diego, CA",222,205,213,4.0,12/15/2013,"This place is good and has improved over the years. It's always busy so I only go during lunch. They have a huge menu to choose from so be prepared to read through it. The service is excellent and the cheesecakes are ok. (That was sarcasm) actually, the cheesecakes are delicious but very rich. So after having a full meal, it's best to share."
Stella C.,"Santa Monica, CA",159,657,139,1.0,4/18/2012,"Let me tell you why I think this place is crap. They NEVER take reservations so they make you sit and wait with these things that go off and vibrate when the table is ready. The staff is not very helpful and you can tell that they're unsatisfied with their jobs and it definitely rubs off on the way they talk to their clientele. The atmosphere is liken to its name a ""Factory"" in which they mass produce some high-calorie cookie-cutter type of food which really isnt worth your time or money. I would say if youre in the middle of nowhere and this chain restaurant is around and you have no other options, feel free to go. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and go to a nice place with comprable prices that actually takes reservations and has better food"
W W.,"San Diego, CA",0,52,,1.0,12/19/2013,"My experiences with this establishment have always been less than stellar and the last one is the final straw.  I will attempt to be brief. I came here with my child, two of my sisters and their two children on November 9, 2013 for a late lunch.  We were seated immediately and thought that this may be a good thing.  Well, we were seated in a section with a tepid waitress who was thoroughly disinterested in us.  She appeared annoyed when I inquired about the gluten free options for myself and my child; she was unable to answer all of my questions (yeah, sorry, we have food allergies and she should know her business) and had to go inquire of the kitchen - a prospect that was obviously less than thrilling to her.  At least she got our orders in correctly. The food is good, but not spectacular.  Also, I had ordered a la cart and one of my dishes was forgotten.  Not a big deal, but the waitress never acknowledged it; rather, a random manager came by to tell me and to apologize.  Our waitress failed to check up on us or refill our waters; now, this is a pet peeve of mine as I drink about 4 to 6 litres of water per day.  It's the middle of the day.  I'm thirsty.  Please fill my glass; is it that difficult?  Apparently it was for her. I should mention that after finishing our meal, my child began to become ill.  Uh-oh. When our check came, there were some oddities.  We wanted to split the bill onto three cards so I was hard at work trying to do the math; I worked on it for 30 minutes but could not match up the totals.  I noticed that they charged us a mandatory 18% gratuity (that bent us a bit, seeing as none of us felt our server deserved that much even though we all typically tip around 20%), even though we only had a party of six!  Finally I realized that they weren't charging us 8% tax, it was more like 9.4%.  What?  Since our waitress had abandoned us, we asked another passing waiter about the tax rate; he didn't have an answer so he got a manager-who also didn't have an answer.  In fact, she said that since she was from Arizona, she didn't even know what the rate in San Diego was.  You know, I work in retail, as well as one of my sisters, and we both were dumbfounded:  how can you work in the service industry and not know the answer to our question???  At least the manager removed the difference from the total. At this point, my child was very ill.  On the way out the door I inquired after a manager I might speak to when I got home.  I obtained a name and called when I got home.  The man seemed empathetic at first and expressed a wish to have fixed it in the restaurant.  I explained that my child was becoming sicker and sicker and had to get home.  He also had no answers for me but told me to call corporate on Monday.  REALLY????  What kind of manager are you?  He became indifferent to the point of talking to others while I was on the phone with him - how rude! I did call Cheesecake corporate headquarters on Monday morning.  After speaking with a nice woman and her doing some footwork, the issue was resolved.  We were being taxed on the gratuity that we should not ever have been charged.  Wow.... really?  She refunded one of my sister's cards and issued a gift certificate for us to use.  However, I stressed to her that I live in San Diego and there are too many good places to eat for me to waste my time with their establishment ever again.  EVER. I WILL NEVER DINE HERE AGAIN.  I don't care if you're food is tasty, Cheesecake; your service is terrible and your staff is ill-informed.  Go cheat someone else, I'm done with you."
Mel B.,"San Diego, CA",547,568,235,4.0,8/25/2009,"New on the menu...red velvet cheesecake.  Very, very good if you like red velvet. They have a much better kids menu.  I think it was pretty much non-existent before.  Beware of the mini-corn dogs.  They are fried on a skewer with a very sharp end.  Whose bright idea was that?  At least our waitress had the courtesy to warn us.  Freakin law suit waiting to happen. Why another review on a chain restaurant with already 100+ reviews? Eh, why not."
Darlene B.,"Phoenix, AZ",97,653,794,3.0,2/20/2012,"This place is always super crowded. The wait is ridiculously long and THIS GIRL, cannot wait!! Luckily it's at the mall so the pass time is walking around and shopping :) Cheesecake Factory has a menu that has too many choices, in my opinion. I usually have to go for the same thing. It's a parmesan crusted chicken with a light tomato pasta, it's delicious, & a large portion. My boyfriend got the macaroni and cheese burger? It's like a deep fried ball of mac n cheese in a burger. He said it wasn't the way he had it at a different location, so he wasn't completely satisfied.  The service here was pretty good. Our waiter was really nice and attentive.  p.s. too many large groups of high school girls.. ANNOYING . lol."
Caroline V.,"San Diego, CA",454,161,243,4.0,9/8/2013,"They're menu is like reading a novel with over 10+ pages of drinks, food, and dessert to flip through. There are lots of patio and indoor seating but it does get pretty busy during peak lunch and dinner hours. Great place if you're unsure what you want because they literally have anything you can think of. Don't leave without trying one of their cheesecakes!"
Nea S.,"Tustin, CA",0,12,2,5.0,6/21/2015,Great location!!! Our server Damon was super nice and customized our food as per our likes!! Thank you thank you!!
Jennifer B.,"San Diego, CA",10,44,,4.0,8/8/2012,"Really great service here, but I'd really expect no less. The ambiance is nice & begs to reason that you'll be paying a little more for the meals. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still a chain restaurant, but it's a little bit higher tier than most.  I came for lunch with my cousin. We both gotta fettuccine pasta, and shared a slice of cheesecake. Both were delicious.  My main beef with this place is getting in. Since this is the only one for miles, it's hard to get in. We tried making reservations but they don't take reservations. We tried coming for dinner the night before, but the wait was 45 minutes. That was pretty absurd to me. Wait 45 minutes, then probably another 30 to eat? No thanks. Considering it's almost always busy like this, not having the option to reserve a table & how pricey it is, I'd say that I won't be coming here too often. But I did have a pleasant experience."
