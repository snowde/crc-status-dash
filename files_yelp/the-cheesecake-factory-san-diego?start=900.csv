King B.,"Irvine, CA",326,68,9,1.0,10/8/2012,My porkchop was raw (completely) T'was my birthday dinner too I'll never come back
Steven B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/8/2015,"I ordered a ""whisky smash"" from the printed menu after a friend had a bad experience with an off-menu cocktail. While my beverage was larger than hers, it tasted like an orange soda rather than whisky. My alcohol-intolerant fiancé tried a sip and commented that ""there must be alcohol in there somewhere."" Very disappointing."
J R F.,"Riverside, CA",18,24,1,4.0,11/17/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that most people are probably familiar with, but this location was excellent. I went to lunch here during my vacation and the food was excellent. I ordered the Hibachi Steak and the toasted marshmallow cheesecake for lunch...all I can say is shut up and take my money!  The Hibachi steak was cooked to perfection and the Cheesecake was amazing. It has been a long while since I enjoyed a properly cooked steak! The variety in their menu is great and there's something for everyone here."
Savannah P.,"Linda Vista, San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/6/2015,"My boyfriend and I went into the Cheesecake Factory last night for a late dinner. The food was great as usual, but our server Sean was the highlight of our night. I don't think we've ever received such amazing customer service before. He checked in on us just enough times, was polite, and offered suggestions. We will return and hope Sean is our waiter again! The company is lucky to have such an outstanding gig employee. Both my boyfriend and I have worked retail/customer service and recognized what an asset to the their team he is."
Michelle G.,"San Diego, CA",201,237,493,5.0,1/28/2012,"This place is perfect for all occasions! There are so many reasons why they get 5 stars. #1- I love the free squaw bread to start....i can't get enough of it...so warm, fresh, and tasty! #2- The cheesecake factory has such a diverse menu that it will please all palettes.   From Pizza to Burgers to Sandwiches to Jumbalaya to Chinese noodles, this menu offers flavors from all over.  #3-I was just there recently and noticed that they even have a pull out menu of ""skinny"" menu items for the calorie conscious.  This is great, because the food portions are so huge and, I am sure, high in calorie content.      My most favorite of all menu items is the Chicken Madiera.  2 large chicken breasts sit in a flavorful mushroom sauce on top of a mound of mash potatoes with a side of asparagus...it is to die for!!  The leftovers even taste just as amazing!  The portions are gynormous here, so splitting with someone may be your best bet. Even more tasty than the entrees, are the cheesecake desserts!  I love the white chocolate rasberry cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, and the pumpkin cheesecake(seasonal only). This restaurant never fails to disappoint!"
Amy S.,"Murrieta, CA",17,13,1,5.0,8/4/2015,"I haven't been here in years but it did not disappoint.  My daughter and I split the Grilled Cheese.  As I was finishing my share, the chef came to our table with another grilled cheese.  He said he didn't feel like the first one had been cooked properly (one side was a little crispy) and so he brought us another.  When he saw that we were nearly finished, he had it boxed to go for us.  Brandy, our waitress, was spot on with her service and very personable."
Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1180,306,5.0,6/17/2009,"I came  here on my last night of vacation in San Diego. I wanted to eat a really nice hearty dinner, and Cheesecake Factory is good for that. I was surprised at just how busy they were for a Sunday night.  I mean, its not like its a holiday or anything, so what gives? Is it always like this? I had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated, but thats okay by me.  I got to sit outside on the patio, which was lovely.  I was able to enjoy the beautiful California weather!! My waiter was lovely.  Mind you, the resturant was PACKED.  Elbow to elbow and my waitor was as calm and as collected as he could be.   He didn't seem to be phased by all that was going on around him! I ended up going for the old fashioned hamburger and a pop.  Normally I would get something more, but since I couldnt take home any leftovers, I had decided to go with something that I could literally polish off right then and there.  Thus, me ordering the hamburger. Service here was wonderful and excellent.  Food was tasty, delicious and service was impecable considering how busy this place was.  Would return in a heartbeat."
Teri B.,"Pismo Beach, CA",462,192,13,2.0,3/17/2012,"I was super disappointed in the food. I was surprised how bad everyone's meal was as it states on their menu that the food was the most important. Service was slow and freaky (he complained it was too busy for a thursday night?) took an act of god to get water. We sent back the salmon salad, as the salmon was over cooked and not fresh. The spaghetti was so acid filled, no one ate it. My dish was excellent though. The Chicken Bellagio that was  Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad. it was so good, we all shared it. too bad the rest was so bad."
Grady M.,"San Diego, CA",9,6,4,5.0,7/1/2014,"Very well done, for a chain restaurant!  Great environment, and as everyone else is pointing out the food and service is excellent.  I writing this review mainly to say we had Mike for our waiter, even though the place was busy as usual, he made it feel like we were his only table!  Not by standing over us, but it was like he knew at the exact moment when we needed something, plates cleared, fresh utensils, another drink, etc.....  we will go back.  Fantastic, would recommend for everyone, go there at least once."
C V.,"Santa Monica, CA",234,151,65,3.0,5/20/2013,"I haven't been in to the Cheesecake Factory for over a year now, so I was super excited to go there with my boyfriend recently for his first visit. He hears me rave about it constantly so it was about time!! Unfortunately we went on a Saturday night so there was quite a wait, but I knew that was to be expected. I've visited this location during both busy and quiet times, and usually the quality of food is not affected either way. However, it appears as though the rush affected our food BIG time. Our appetizer (buffalo blasts) was the only thing that came out hot - too hot, in fact. They were soooo crunchy and overcooked! My spicy cashew chicken came out cold about 35 minutes later, and it was also about half the portion that I'm used to with this dish. What?! Is my memory just failing me?! The flavor also seemed...saltier? Maybe it's because I cook my own version of this  that I've become accustomed to. *Shrug* I enjoyed it regardless, but my boyfriend DESPISED his dish. He ordered a burger with bacon and fried mac and cheese on top, which sounded incredible to both of us. He said that the mac and cheese totally ruined the burger though - the cold, grainy gas station nacho-type cheese sunk into all the other ingredients and completely turned him off. I encouraged him to stop eating, split my dish, and voice his opinion to our server but we were so hungry after an hour and a half wait before we even got seated (and then over another hour wait for our entrees) that he was just over it. First time I've ever seen anyone unsatisfied with what they ordered, and my boyfriend isn't even as harsh a critic as me! I feel awful changing my rating since I am such a huge fan of this place (and our Reese's cheesecake to go was fab-u-LOUS) but this was a seriously subpar dining experience. Our server didn't seem to catch onto our ""eh"" attitude either. I'll need to go back and see if this shift in quality is for good, or if I just caught them on a bad night. Shame, Cheesecake Factory, shaaame :("
Arnann P.,"San Diego, CA",212,37,14,3.0,6/14/2010,"I always came to eat here in high school and still do on occasions. The food is yummy I enjoy their appetizers, dishes, and desserts. Lol. It's a chill place once you've been seated at a table with your party and the atmosphere to me is positive. When ever I go out I make it fun and enjoyable for my company. The wait here is forever long! But it doesn't really bother me because I know I better have good food or else I won't be paying for it. I try not to eat the bread but we end up eating it all and some! I love me some butter! Haha. My favorite is Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake! I absolutely love it!!  I just really wished the waiting wasn't so long."
Bryan P.,"San Diego, CA",28,10,,3.0,12/21/2013,"LONG wait times on phone to place to go order (9min!)  then the person answering says ""thanks for waiting, we are very busy, can you please call back""?!?!  incompetent person answering the phone.  The food here is generally pretty great, trying to get it is impossible and not worth the effort."
David R.,"San Diego, CA",1,51,3,1.0,11/10/2013,Sat at a table for 10 minutes with no service at all - not even a glass of water. Got up and on our way out I asked to speak to the manager.  Told him what had happened.  He ask me where we had been seated and then offered to re- sit us.  No offer for a free appetizer or anything  - he didn't seen to really care.
Fidel G.,"Bakersfield, CA",45,21,22,5.0,7/30/2012,This place is awesome. Considering the 45 minute wait on a Monday. The food and service was excellent. Since it was national cheesecake day and all cheesecakes were 50% off we ended with two cakes. Yumm.
Siri J.,"Brighton, CO",91,39,17,2.0,10/25/2013,"Never had the cheesecake at this location, so keep that in mind, but the food was pretty bad and over-priced. I'm not a fan of the chain, having gone to the one in Seattle and getting food poisoning there from the chicken. (Interestingly enough, I found out a few days later, my brother and a group of his friends were at the same Seattle location , seated on the other side of the restaurant, and they all got food poisoning too.) But I'd been drug to the Vegas location, twice in a week, and it was FANTASTIC, so I gave the SD one a shot - twice, months apart. Food was terrible. Service was okay, wait was excruciating, esp considering how bad the good was. Maybe they should stick to desserts, except in Vegas (Caesar's, in case you were wondering.) I do not recommend. At least Seattle was the only experience of food poisonings."
Jun N.,"Berkeley, CA",484,24,11,2.0,6/27/2011,"I went to Cheesecake Factory on Sunday with my bf. I thought it would be a good place to have a late lunch, but I was wrong. The wait wasn't that bad or the food.  The service was horrible. I know the waiters and waitresses have a lot of tables to deal with, but at least try to listen to your customers. Calling for them after three tries - bad service.  As for the food, I got the factory combo of steak and salmon. Steak was tiny but good. Salmon-- eh, could have been better. My bf got the steak coulette something--- and it was something that we did not expect. It was a tiny piece of meat, and it was bloody raw. He asked for a medium rare and he got a bloody mess.  The size of the steak was smaller than a six-inch Subway sandwich, which we don't recommend. Plus, the menu said that it came with Onion Rings and fries. There were TWO onion rings and a menial amount of fries. The portion of fries couldn't even amount to the medium size fries at McDonald's.  The price, honestly, was expensive for the crap meal we got. We could have gotten a better service, a better price, and a better meal quality at a broke down Denny's in the ghetto.   Finally, the drinks were whack. There were more ice than the drink itself- and we just ordered sodas. Well, this is not one of the best experiences I had at Cheesecake and so, I recommend not to go."
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,4.0,7/13/2009,"I have always been a loyal Cheesecake Factory customer.  Love the abundance of food selections and they never seem to disappoint.  The portions are huge so it's pretty hard to go home hungry.  Some of my favorites: Entrees:  Fish tacos, stuffed chicken tortillas, carmel chicken, bistro shrimp pasta, barbeque chicken salad Appetizers: Buffalo blasts, lettuce wraps, avocado egg rolls Dessert:  Craigs Crazy Cheesecake (carrot cake and cheesecake combined) I'm giving it 4 stars because of the ridiculous wait every time I go."
Niquelle W.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,14,,4.0,7/5/2014,My daughter and I had a Girl's Day Out and we stopped in for a nice lunch.  We were seated outdoors on the sunny deck. It was nice to sit in the sun although there were plenty of umbrellas if you wanted shades.  We were able to order quickly and the food arrived quickly. I always love the Jamaican Jerk Shrimp with rice and black beans.  My girl always orders the sliders and she was delighted.  The French fries were hot and fresh and everything was yummy.  Our server was very pleasant. We were in and out in 50 minutes with great service.
Jaimee H.,"Daly City, CA",75,202,134,3.0,5/13/2011,"I have to say, this Cheesecake Factory has mastered the art of location. When i moved to San Diego, this was one of the first restaurants that caught my attention. First, it's located at the mall! Second, i think they strategically placed their outdoor tables right next to the mall traffic. You can see and almost smell the food as you are driving by! The words Cheesecake Factory pop out and lure you in without you knowing. They wait is often long, especially on Friday nights and weekends. Come early, otherwise be prepared to wait almost an hour. My favorite appetizer is the fried calamari. I love the marinara sauce that it comes with. They also give unlimited free bread and butter, and if you aren't careful, you can easily get full off of this. Their menu is so extensive. Several dishes from each category: seafood, chicken, beef, and pork. Many specialty items. You can come here every day for a year and still have something new to try. Your dining experience is not complete without ordering something from the dessert menu. After all, it isn't called the Cheesecake Factory for no reason. You can stare at their cheesecake display for a long time because, yes, it is that hard to decide on what to order. They also have cakes that are layers high.  The service is a hit or miss and i think it just really depends on how busy they are. Parking and traffic can be a pain, but it's just one more thing you have to conquer before getting to your well-deserved cheesecake."
Jaidyn Q.,"San Diego, CA",63,5,1,2.0,12/24/2012,"When we first arrived the hostess was not very polite, and our waitress did not come by very often, when she did come to our table she would ask us how everything was as she was still walking away. The portions are decent sized, but the food wasn't very good. The pasta we ordered tasted like it went straight from the freezer to the hot lamp. My child's mac-n-cheese had absolutely no flavor. I have never heard my kid say they didn't like mac-n-cheese from anywhere.   I very much dislike when waiters bring the child's food last, it doesn't feel fair that the child watch everyone gets their plate. When my child finally received their dish, it was so hot it burned their tongue and throat. When I touched the dish it was  extremely hot. Not OK. I don't think I'll be returning, very disappointing."
