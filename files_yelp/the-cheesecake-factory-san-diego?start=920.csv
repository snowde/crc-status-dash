Chris B.,"Marina del Rey, CA",14,42,2,2.0,1/25/2012,"The food is decent, the service is fair, the clientele is poor. The people rating this so highly likely would have also rated The Olive Garden just as highly before it became regarded as ""redneck haute cuisine"". tl;dr Cheesecake Factory is redneck haute cuisine"
Jenny T.,"San Diego, CA",6,40,279,3.0,2/26/2014,"I love the food at cheesecake factory but it just bugs me that the food takes so long to come out... One time we went for my sister's birthday but their machines were down and believe it or not, it took us over 2 hours to get our food. Not only that but my pasta never arrived. By the time everyone finished their food and ready to leave, it finally arrived . We brought it to our waiter's attention and he said ""there's nothing we can do about it"". My brother gave them a fit and they finally decided to take my pasta off the bill. Other than this, I do like the food... I have mixed feelings.. eh 3 stars.."
Alexandria O.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,1,1.0,10/20/2013,"So this actually hard for me to write, because I usually love the Cheesecake Factory and it's my husband and I's go to place on a Friday night. However, I can't let this one go. At about 4:00 p.m. my husband I decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. When we got there, they told us it would be about a fifteen minute wait which was fine by us. When we were seated (outside), we had a wonderful waitress who took our drink and food order right away. I'm sorry to say I can't remember her name but she rocked! However after about 20 minutes we were approached by another waiter who tried to get our order then asked us if we had been helped. It seemed like there was a lot of confusion going but it wasn't really a big deal. What did bother me though, is that were seated right next to a large party, a baby shower actually who were very loud, especially with their drinking games. I didn't complain to the waitress though, I just wish someone had warned us or asked us if it was okay, since they got pretty loud after a few drinks. Anyway, no big deal. I ordered the fish and chips, one of my favorite dishes. This time though, I seriously wish I had passed. Why? Because about an hour after we had left, I became very sick. My job is to know about food, how it can be contaminated, along with food borne illnesses. After about 20 minutes of vomiting and some other horrific symptoms that I won't bother to horrify yelp with, I realized I had food poisoning. I spent the rest of the night in my bathroom. When I called to notify the Cheesecake Factory (as you are supposed to do) I got a simple ""oh sorry""and then hung up. I wasn't looking for anything, but I think I deserve a real apology. Anyway, we wont be back!!"
Renee R.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,45,5,5.0,6/28/2015,"This was my first time ever at The Cheesecake Factory. I came here with a gift card from my daughters. When my hubby and I walked in, there were people everywhere so I thought we were in for a long wait.( it was 12pm on a Sunday)  I was wrong. We were seated immediately! Yay! The place was beautiful! Our server was Jordan, and he was so nice. He informed us of what was on  the menu, this being our first time and all. I ordered a Monte Cristo sandwich and potatoes. The sandwich was fabulous, but, the potatoes were cold. Still very good. Hubby had fish and chips and he loved it. We made sure we saved room for dessert! We decided on the Reese's PB cake cheesecake. OMG! It could have fed 4 people easily, but, we ate it all!! :)  Jordan came back several times to check on us, refill our drinks ,etc. If I could, I'd come here every week, but, Fashion Valley is NOT a place I like to be. Way too crowded for me! But, we thoroughly enjoyed our food and service! Thank you Jordan!! :)"
Keilani H.,"San Diego, CA",6,52,16,4.0,7/25/2011,"This is probably one of mine and my boyfriend's favorite places to eat! We usually come on a Friday or Saturday night so we are pretty used to waiting at least 40 minutes (we usually get in quicker than that though.) I usually get their shrimp with angel hair and its always good! I've only tried their pastas and their calamari but I've never been disappointed. Their drinks are good too and not as pricey as people make them seem.  Their service is usually good and consistent except this past time we went.. I think our server was having a rough night and she somehow ran into someone who spilled our drinks all over the floor. It also took awhile for her to get us bread and our food took a long time too... but since we always get good service here, we will let this past experience slide. If you're gonna come here, expect to wait awhile - especially if you come on a weekend night. Also, they don't take reservations."
Kyle W.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2014,"I will never ever eat at this place ever again. My fiance and I went in last night at about 9:30, an hour and a half before closing. We sat there waiting to be seated, watching them seat 4 other couples that walked in after us. We had to say something to them after the 5th person and it seems as if they just forgot about us completely, letting us stand there, 5 feet away from them, for 20 minutes.  They say us at a table that still had the check from the previous customers laying there. When we tried to get someones attention to come and get it, they just told us to wait for the waiter. After the waiter finally came, we ordered some drinks and an appetizer. She brought us out some water (no straws) and took our order. Since we didn't get any straws, I spent the next 15 minutes trying to get a waiters attention so that they could give us some straws. A guy said he would and never showed back up with them. Finally our appetizer comes out, 30 minutes after ordering it and we ask that guy for some straws and after about another 5 minutes he finally brings them out. We finish out appetizer and wait another 15 minutes for someone to come take our real order.  I'm honestly tired of reliving the experience in this review. We finally got our food at around 11:15 PM, an hour and 45 minutes after we arrived, the steak wasn't medium rare and it looked like it was just thawed out and thrown on the grill. The broccoli looked like it was run under hot water, put on a plate, and thrown in the microwave to make it hot. We finally left at around 11:25.  I could understand all of this if they were just extremely busy, but this was a Thursday night and they were not busy at all. Empty tables all around. This was just extremely poor service. I have never ate a restaurant in my life that had such poor service. I've been to this location before and I enjoyed myself. Last night, that was it for me. I will never come here again. I don't even like writing reviews, but the service was so bad last night, it compelled me to write one."
Ainne M.,"San Diego, CA",40,70,27,4.0,5/29/2012,"Yum...The food is awesome here, and I have to say I have never had bad service. The drinks can be a bit pricey, but all that I have tried are really good. If you are looking to try something frosty and yummy try the Georgia peach. Also they have this pasta called the Louisiana Cajun pasta. Its amazing, but huge, feel free to share that one.  Oh and one other thing, be prepared to wait...and wait...and wait. this place is always busy."
Gracie L.,"San Diego, CA",72,220,43,2.0,8/8/2013,"What's all the hola-baloo about with this place???? Without fail I always get sick after I dine here. It's a combination of the fried food and the dishes with calorie counts exceeding any normal human being's daily intake. The wait is long, the menu is ""blah"" and my lunch bill was $50. I did order cheesecake, and yes it was good, but it was plain. Easy fix- order plain cheesecake at Costco for a fraction of the price and enjoy your stomach ache at home."
Christine M.,"San Diego, CA",85,223,72,4.0,10/26/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a safe place to go when youre throwing a last minute get together lumcheon/dinner, although any time of the week you should expect to see a line. A great thing about this restaurant is that you can come in casual or dressy without being looked at funny. There are three dishes I take turn ordering here only because they are so worth the calories and of course I always order the Fried Calamari as an appetizer.  Their Ahi Carpaccio is seared and served rare- it's seared enough to give a crisp but as soon as you bit thru that initially, the rare portion melts in your mouth. It has a slight tanginess & sweetness that really go well together. Their Clubhouse Salad taste just like a turkey club sammich without the bread and it's very fulfilling. It's also very big so it's a perfect salad to share with someone. Lastly when I really wanna go all out and throw calories out the window, their Farfalle Chicken w/ Roasted Garlic is TO DIE FOR!! The ONLY con is that its way too garlicky but I think that's the whole point. Most pastas don't taste the same after it's been a day old and reheated, but this particular pasta still carries its same great taste even throughout the next day, reheated and all. And the CHEESECAKES!?!?! This is WHY its called the Cheesecake Factory. I'm pretty confident in saying that I've had slices or nibbles of almost every cheesecake offered here and they were all yummy, although some are just yummiER than others. I've not been disappointed one time with a flavor, even flavors that I would never EVER imagine to be slightly tasty has pleasantly surprised me. Great place, great food, great drink and great ambience is what this place gives to its patrons. But then again.. it's just my opinion.."
Tyson Y.,"San Diego, CA",1,42,,5.0,9/26/2011,"I usually go here when I feel like celebrating something. As a vegetarian- I'm a big fan of portobello-based sandwiches/burgers- and the ""Grilled Portobello on a Bun"" they have is my favorite of all (thought it can get a bit messy) I've tried a few appetizers..but the fried macaroni and cheese balls are the great! I often get too full to have dessert if I get an appetizer though. My favorite dessert is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate cake. I'm not too into cheesecake to be honest- because of all the cream cheesiness...but the 30th Anniversary cake is a nice balance between cheesecake and chocolate. The place can be pretty busy on weekends because of all the people at the mall"
Judy L.,"San Diego, CA",10,126,,4.0,10/22/2011,"Leaving a review for the Cheesecake Factory feels a little weird, as there is usually one near a mall and the chain is everywhere. Pretty much go here when people are celebrating in a big party or something like that.  There's not much that needs to be done to make me happy at this establishment. Keep refilling my water. Bring me lots of that deeeeelicious oat bread. Don't mess up my order. Bam! Five stars and a nice tip.  Went to this place tonight for dinner with a friend. We were seated out on the patio in a nice spot next to a warm space heater. It's October and we can still enjoy a meal outside! We were promptly greeted by a server who was filling in for another waiter who was on break. He brought us bread and took our drink orders, and later refilled our bread basket. Thank you! Mmm bread. We placed our orders and waited. I asked for the grilled portobello on a bun with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries is the only reason I wanted to come to the cheesecake factory anyway.  Eventually we meet our server ... He seemed nice enough.  We get our food brought out by another server and I notice that my plate came with regular fries. I told her I had asked for sweet potato fries and she left the French fries (sweeeeeet!) which I was secretly overjoyed about. I don't know if it's impolite to ask the server who actually brings the food for things, but since she was going to get the sweet potato fries, I asked for ranch as well. She was so nice about it! And she came back quickly as well. Thank you so much! I wish I could have given her a tip.  Our server refilled my water periodically and checked up on us appropriately. Eventually we order dessert, the key lime cheesecake with extra cherries on the side, and he brought it out promptly and brought us new forks. It was delicious! Overall this review is mainly highlighting the great service received tonight. The food is sort of satisfying enough but nothing spectacular, but that's what is expected from a chain restaurant. Thanks so much to the part of the staff that helped serve us tonight. Thank you!!!"
Stella T.,"San Diego, CA",3,80,,4.0,6/2/2012,"Went here for my third time (or maybe forth I can't really remember), I am still a fan even though the wait is the only downfall.  And folks it is only going to get even more crowded and busier with summer rolling up and there is only so much one place can do for people in a congo line at 6pm! Here's a hint: get in early.  Came in last time around 4.30pm for an early dinner, got seated 10mins later.  Bear in mind, it was only husband and myself.  They also have the option of outdoor seating with heaters outside, which sometimes gives you a better seating and time placement than just opting for the dining in method. (inside is too noisy anyways, so maybe people with larger crowds would want to take their party outside??) Typhoon punch still kicking my ass and loving it. Had their fish and chips last time, was very good. Both 2 waiters that helped us (evening shift changer over) were very professional and uplifting."
Diana I.,"Los Angeles, CA",2263,1137,1415,4.0,3/21/2009,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory many times-- the one in Redondo Beach, and the one at The Grove. But this was definitely the best experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory! My friend and I were SHOCKED to find that it was SO crowded on a Thursday night. We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table but the wait wasn't bad at all because we killed time just walking around the Fashion Valley mall which was right next to it.  We ordered a really delicious ahi tuna roll for an appetizer. Pretty dang good! And we both ordered salads. I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad which was DELICIOUS. It came with lots of pieces of seared tuna tataki (YUM!), avocados, tomatoes, and a tangy wasabi vinaigrette dressing. I hate wasabi but this was amazing!  My friend got a different salad... it was some kind of southwestern tostada one. She asked for no cilantro but sadly, it came with cilantro, and lots of it! So she told our waitress and she was REALLY nice about it, apologized and took it away to fix it. While we were waiting, the manager  even came out and apologized, and said it would be difficult to take out every bit of cilantro since the salad has cilantro dressing on it too. So instead, my friend got the same salad as me and they didn't charge her for the mess-up salad.  Overall, the service was excellent here, considering how CRAZY BUSY they were. Food came out quickly, service was super friendly, and the food was the best I've tasted at a Cheesecake Factory so far. :)"
S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,5.0,2/20/2011,"Just to clarify, cheesecake factory serves food other than cheesecake. Whenever I go, there's an inherent desire to purchase cheesecake. But the driving force that gets me there is often the entree. Environment: it's always loud. Cheesecake factory is one of the few restaurants that does not take reservations yet still manages to fill up for dinner and most times for lunch. Amazing! If they started allowing for public purchases of franchises, I would definitely invest. The tables are distributed well and at night, the restaurant is dimly lit. For lunch, lots of natural light penetrate the many floor to ceiling windows. Not too bright with just the right amount of light. Upon arriving, you head to the front desk to get seated or pick one a beeper. Gets crowded and some people don't understand how to form lines. Otherwise, no problems. Waiter/waitresses: all very friendly. Most of time, they're a bit younger. They come by frequently to check on you throughout the meal. Occasionally, they take breaks during your meal but their temporary replacements are more than adequate in providing service. Food: the best part of this culinary experience. There are several pages of appetizers and entrees to choose from. Have tried a good number appetizers including firecracker salmon rolls, thai lettuce wraps, spinach artichoke dip, and the cheese and crab dip. The favorite is probably firecracker salmon rolls which are served with a spicy thai flavor sauce on a bed of shredded radishes. The entree I always order is the thai chicken pasta. Only once has it been merely satisfactory. Otherwise, always tasty. Green noodles, large chunks of chicken, peanuts, some sort of bean, and bell peppers covered with a slightly spicy peanut sauce. So darn good! Desserts are alway a slice of cheesecake. The favorite is the kahlua coffee cheesecake. Hard to explain why. Maybe it's the perfect combination of coffee and cheese flavor that makes it so irresistible. Drinks: mostly stick with water. On occasion, will order the strawberry lemonade which is a bit sweet (might be from concentrate). No strawberry chunks within the drink. I think we've ordered a blended drink before. Not sure what it wa but there were no complaints afterward. Recommendation: EAT!"
Hannah S.,"San Diego, CA",48,187,23,2.0,3/27/2011,"I don't understand why this place gets business. I have never liked it and never will. The food here is terrible and I'm sure if they labeled the amount of calories, people would immediately die from heart attacks. The salads are always over-dressed and probably less healthy than the pasta. Service is usually mediocre and the wait is not worth the food. To add to all that, for what you get, the prices are a rip-off.  Also, for a cheesecake factory, their cheesecake is pretty bad. So sweet you can't get past the first bite. Overrated."
Candan D.,"La Jolla, CA",60,18,41,1.0,5/24/2013,"It's not a restaurant anymore just a factory! I just had a very unpleasant experience and unfortunately one thing followed another in a vicious circle almost.  I don't know what it is but it was an upsetting and unpleasant experience. I would rather go across the street either direction than be treated like this. I am not one of those critics that would go into details and explain the whole occurrence second by second but long story short the treatment is sometimes more important than the food itself. If you are enjoying the ambiance, it means you are dining well. So human touch is crucial to serve the best at a restaurant. I would have gone to a crappy fast food restaurant and be happier."
Heather W.,"San Diego, CA",1671,906,2600,3.0,1/19/2009,"The fact that there is an insane wait for friday & sat nights (and no option to book a reservation) greatly intrigued me to finally 'suck it up' and endure said wait one evening.  Let's see how long was the wait?  I think it was an hour. I remember absolutely nothing special about my experience here.  I got a pasta dish that was disappointing and uninspired...and everything else is a blur.  I dunno, maybe there are great things on the menu but my choice was not one of them. Forget the dining experience and grab a slice of cheesecake to go - which you will still most likely wait a bit for.  I mean yes, their cheesecake lives up to the restaurant name.  Lot's of choices, and delicious. but what is all the hype over this place?  Glad I finally can say I've been there but really.... meh."
Wesley U.,"San Diego, CA",64,1,,4.0,3/9/2011,"My buddy and I came here to celebrate my recovery from one of the worst bouts of stomach flu I've ever experienced. It was like that episode of South Park-- you know the one I'm talking about. The only thing that got me through that painfully delusional dehydrated shivering state was the thought that I would be able to enjoy some Chicken Madeira with Madeira Sauce (CMMS) at the Cheesecake Factory.  It's just plain tasty baby. 8) I would say most of the pleasure I get from going to the Cheesecake Factory comes from the experience I get every time I go there. It suits anything really: dates, family get-togethers, reunions, fun awesome drinking times. You name it you can have it here. What's incredible about this is that you can go here without trying real hard and it doesn't make you feel bad about doing it either (don't ask me how). On the other hand, if you decide to look good, this place WILL complement the shit out of you. Low lighting and nice earthy tones makes everything feel so much softer and comfortable-- it's pure american genius. It kind of reminds me of Gotham City. My theory on this is that they designed it around  the idea of Bruce Wayne, but that's another story. The menu is definitely complex and american. There's just so many delicious sounding entres coupled with advertisements that it just makes decision difficult. Luckily, they serve you bread with butter for free as an appetizer to keep you sated while you navigate through the quagmire that is the dreaded menu. That's basically why I usually just order the CMMS. This time, however, I decided against it in fear of relapse and utter destruction-- so I went for a pasta dish (you know, something easy).  I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic (FCRG) because everything on it sounded unfreaking believably delicious. Who can deny chicken and garlic coupled with pasta combined in a perfect unity?!  We waited, squabbled over whether or not it's gay for two moderately well-dressed heterosexual males to go to the Cheesecake factory together and order two iced green teas (us, sadly). We eventually came to the conclusion that we just operate as a two-man cell that doesn't give a HOOT about social norms. Conversations keep us well distracted until our food arrives. If I were to sum up the FCRG in a few words I would say it's rich, creamy, and strong. Not, however, like a good cup of coffee. When I eat dishes, I like to appreciate the complex interplay of changing flavors and textures that expresses itself on my tongue with every om nom nom. This goes especially for pasta dishes with me since I enjoy tasting the mild flavor but strong changing texture of the pasta.  When I was eating the FCRG I felt like I couldn't even taste nor feel the chicken let alone think of the pasta. I didn't even know there were other things present in the dish. All I felt was a strong overtone of moderately sharp garlic cream. I do believe that this dish could have been better with just 1/4th of the sauce they plated onto my dish, but that's just me-- I'm not the average american tongue that might enjoy such strong cream sauces.  I give the Cheesecake factory 4 stars since I believe it is the best example of american culinary capitalism. It's a great time whichever one you decide to go to (and ultimately the same), but If you want a mind numbing tasting experience-- go somewhere else."
Cora L.,"La Jolla, CA",18,36,4,2.0,2/18/2011,"This place is very overrated when you try their menu. I do love their cheesecake, but their food menu is bland and mundane. People probably eat here to people watch more than the quality.  When you enter the fashion valley mall and see that line on the weekends. You can't stop and think what these people eat regularly. I would rather eat at sbarro's pizza than here. I made that mistake today and won't make it again.  If you go here get the cheesecake and eat elsewhere. Pf changs is way better also and just right across the way."
David T.,"San Diego, CA",2,45,17,5.0,2/13/2014,"Great experience and I must give a lion's share of this 5 STAR REVIEW to Idi the server assistant. Having previously managed in this industry I can honestly say he is in the top 5 front of the house employees I have ever seen performing happily,  flawlessly and with with 110% customer service as his mantra.  I could list 25 things that I was impressed with Idi but one of my favorites is while we we sitting on the patio I literally felt 2 or 3 little rain drops on my head and I said to my date, ""is it starting to rain?"" Before I had finished my sentence, a patio umbrella arrived and opened up thanks to....Idi of course! Then in a minute or 2 he had the entire patio covered with umbrellas.  Servers here have always been nice and competent with managers visible in the dining areas. I complimented our server re: Idi and he said, ""He's amazing. I'm lucky he's here because I have a bigger section than normal and everything is running smoothly!"" Keep it up guys....and I fully expect Idi to own his own successful restaurant someday soon!"
