Maria P.,"San Diego, CA",16,9,,4.0,10/13/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a favorite for my friends and I, especially if we plan on seeing a movie after dinner.  I love salmon, so it's predictably my choice to order every time I go out dining. The Miso Salmon (fresh miso marinated salmon served with snow peas, white rice and miso sauce) is very nice, but I like the grilled salmon better.  Last week, I tried Rene's sandwich, soup and salad.  It was clam chowder Friday so that's what I got.  The salad was like a half a small salad; but the chowder was terrific.  I emptied the bowl down to the last drop. By the time I finished the soup and some of the delicious and warm whole wheat bread, I was full and satisfied, so I took the sandwich home, untouched. What I don't like about this restaurant is its business; good for them, not so good for us because it's always a long wait, especially on a Friday night. And... if you're getting together with 8 friends, they won't seat you until everyone has showed up; even if the table is all ready for us."
Brittany L.,"Seattle, WA",91,20,1,1.0,8/14/2013,"I hate to read reviews that start out ""if I could give this place ZERO stars..."" but in this instance, I feel like I need to begin with that exact caveat. I feel like it NEEDS zero stars, because we didn't even get to eat there...  It was my aunt's birthday, and she called two weeks in advance seeking a reservation (we were going to have a pretty large group, around 20 people). The person who answered the phone said that they don't take reservations, but that if we came in around 5 pm on the night in question, things should be settling down enough to give us a wait of maybe an hour-- not much longer than that. A week later, my uncle (who was stressing about not being able to make a reservation) called back, and was told the EXACT SAME THING by someone else-- just come in around 5, they usually get a little quiet around that time, wait shouldn't be more than an hour.  So on my aunt's birthday, we get there at 5. The manager tells us it's going to be somewhere around THREE HOURS. My aunt, panic-stricken, looks at me and says ""What are we going to do??"" The manager (oh-so-generously) advises us that if we split our party into smaller groups, we could possibly be seated sooner. Thanks, dude. Over the course of our (admittedly short) interaction, he proved to be flippant, rude, snarky, and completely uncaring/unsympathetic. Thanks, bro, but we'll take our money elsewhere. I'm not angry that they were busy-- good for them! I'm not even angry that the manager was rude to my aunt. Well, ok, I am a little angry about that. My real frustration comes from the fact that my aunt asked him why two separate people would have told her and her husband on separate occasions that the wait would be around an hour if they came in around 5. His response? ""Oh, we tell everyone that."" No apology for misleading information, no nothing. If he had said that it was unusually busy, or ANYTHING that led me to believe they weren't DELIBERATELY misleading their potential customers, I'd feel a lot better. As it is, Cheesecake Factory can stuff it. I'll go eat somewhere else-- anywhere else."
Donald S.,"Windermere, Orlando, FL",0,2,,1.0,5/2/2015,Last night at The Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Valley Mall in San Diego:  Crab cakes appetizer.  Salmon Genovese for entree.  Third course: Food poisoning. Not going back. #goodtimesbothways and #adifferentinandout.
Pam B.,"El Cajon, CA",5,169,27,4.0,11/4/2013,"Love their salads for lunch, plus they come in a lunch size portion.  You know what that means!  Room for cheese cake, if you don't over do on their delicious bread.  Good service for how busy the place is."
Eunjoo P.,"Palo Alto, CA",183,167,167,5.0,1/23/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory! :D It's one of my favorite restaurants. :) Service is always great & there are soooo many great choices on their menu.  ~Chicken Madeira is 1 of my favorites here..I really like the sauce in this dish & all the portions are so big here that it's perfect to share with someone or take leftovers home.  ~Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - Shrimp & chicken linguini pasta in a delicious cajun sauce.  ~Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp - is so unique tasting & really good if you wanna try something different. It's sautéed shrimp with jamaican black pepper sauce with rice, black beans, plantains & mango salsa. ~I've gotten the Kobe burger a couple times & that's really good as well. Kobe Beef with Sautéed Mushrooms and Onions.  ~BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad is really good too. Dessert!! :D I always try to save room for dessert. The chocolate tower truffle cake is the best chocolate cake in the world.  The banana cream, oreo & red velvet cheesecakes are really good & I also like the lemoncello cream torte which is vanilla cake & lemon mascarpone cream. yummm Oooh & it's also a plus to run into some of the SJ Sharks players at their SJ location. :D"
James A.,"Torrance, CA",67,10,2,5.0,9/13/2014,"I just love the Cheesecake Factory. OK, so it's not gourmet or fancy like lots of other places, but after long weeks at work, sometimes you just need a little cheesecake to cheer you up. I had the original hamburger and fries, which was good. I usually get the Smokehouse BBQ burger, but I wasn't feeling it today. I really like their burgers, always very well cooked and the buns are well toasted and buttered. For dessert I got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which was very good. So rich and delicious and chocolatey. I can safely say it brightened my week and it's always a treat coming in once in a blue moon."
Angela C.,"San Diego, CA",106,253,60,4.0,2/13/2012,This location seems to taste better than other locations I've been to. They salads are amazing. I haven't had one yet that I haven't just loved. There is something on the menu for everyone. It is always crowded and I used to have nightmares about waiting in line. But actually at this spot I've never really had to wait all that long despite the huge crowds that I've seen. I guess because I always opt to take first available and seem to get seated outdoors which is just fine because it's either a beautiful say in San Diego or the heat lamps are warm enough to keep me warm. And that says something because I am a very cold natured person who always needs a jacket but am completely comfortable sitting outside here at night.
Brittany B.,"Longmont, CO",2,66,,5.0,8/6/2013,"Some of the best food ive ever tasted. quality, quality, quality. expensive, but totally worth it! and not to mention all the cheesecake! This location is by far the best. Beautiful patio, great staff and service!"
Michele Y.,"Lemon Grove, San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/11/2012,"This popular location of the Cheesecake Factory finally has competition, which allows for faster lunchtime seating.  New, True Food Kitchen next door: 45-minute wait; Cheesecake Factory: no wait. A first for me at this location. Both restaurants are pricey and noisy, so it gets down to service and food. On any given day at the Factory, it is a flip of the coin if your server is satisfactory. This visit, ours was friendly and attentive.  So, why the one-star review? My entrée.  This is NOT the place to order shepherd's pie. It floats in grease."
Angela D.,"San Diego, CA",48,5,,1.0,4/1/2015,"Horrible service! We waited 20 mins and nobody even came to offer us drinks. Servers were ignoring us and when I asked one server she said she'll be right back but didn't care to hear what I have to say, instead went to the the customer who just sat down 30 secs ago. Awful customer service! They don't even deserve 1 star."
Len L.,"San Diego, CA",270,68,55,5.0,2/20/2014,Love their fish n chips with their tartar sauce! My bf really enjoys their meatloaf!! All of their cheesecakes are tasty and yummy!!
Mari D.,"San Diego, CA",154,220,119,4.0,6/10/2013,"Ooooh la la....Cheesecake Factory, you've redeemed yourself.  The first time I went I thought it was terrible and annoyingly loud.  This time's experience goes as follows: My bud and I arrive and are told 25 minute wait.  There are like 20 people waiting, we find that to be hard to believe but it seems like a decent wait time so we agree. I couldn't tell you how long we waited but we had so much to catch up on that honestly, I didn't think it took more than the 25 minutes. Our buzzer goes off and we hand it to the hostess, then she tells us to wait in a line for our number to be called! WHAT?! Anyway, we were called within about a minute and a half or so...I thought it was odd that they'd call us to wait in another line but whatevz. So we follow our hostess and are taken through to the outside....We were like, ""great, the losers seating."" NO! The patio seating is soooooo pretty. Lawn chairs, heaters, and waaaaaay quieter than the inside! The ambiance is awesome outside! Very romantic...not that I would know -_-.  Anyway....the bread basked they hook it up with at the beginning is BOMB....I love the brown bread....it has an ever so slight hint of sweetness. Appetizer: Fried Mac & Cheese....which I would never dream of ordering (I wasn't brought up on soul food)...It was amazeballs (literally, they were balls lol) 4 of them so we each got two.  Next up....we got burgers which I guess we were craving cuz we were originally going to go to Bunz (Across the street) I liked mine better...The Americana....oh so cheesy and stuff. Meat was thick and we asked for ""well-done""....It was ""well done""  It also came with mini buckets of yummy fries. Ok...so dessert....Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! WHAT?! Yum....we had that to go and our waitress was nice enough to pack it with forks so we could try it before we left.  Ok....so the biggest awesome thing? When our busser took my plate away I told him I still wanted to eat my fries. He said ok and proceeded to just remove the plate.  A minute later, dude comes back with a new thing of fresh fries! Duuuuude! If that's not going above and beyond, I don't know what is! I'm really angry at myself for not getting his name. This man was amazing. Anyway....cool beans Cheesecake Factory! You are now yumz yumz in my book.  My bud and I plan on returning for a Cheesecake and coffee....ok, maybe an appetizer too....haha but we did get a bit too much food in the end....all very delish!"
Lisa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,34,8,5.0,2/3/2012,"Be prepared for huge portions. Unless you're really hungry stick with just the main course and maybe split dessert. I, on the other hand, am sticking with two appetizers and a drink on my next visit. :)"
Sal C.,"Irvine, CA",109,4,10,5.0,11/22/2013,"Talk about a great old fashioned!!! And the Jamaican black pepper shrimp, to die for!!!!"
Stephanie S.,"Syracuse, UT",14,70,94,4.0,9/24/2013,"Great location next to the mall.  Try the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake!  Best one I have had.  The pepperoni pizza is good, but a lot of slices for just one person.  Service was good."
Escondido C.,"Escondido, CA",4,100,1,3.0,9/11/2011,"I've eaten here three times. The service has been consistently good but the food is another matter. I recommend that you stick with their traditional dishes of spring rolls, pasta, hamburgers and the like. Stay away from their salads; they are drenched in dressing and flavorless. Of course, their desserts are what they are really known for. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is my favorite. On the cheesecake alone I would rate them a solid 5."
Kristi C.,"San Diego, CA",3,49,,2.0,2/13/2014,"I really don't know why I keep coming to this place when every time I do, I always regret it. Their service is so slow, when my friend and I were seated it took us almost 20 mins to get acknowledged only because I was about to get up and say something. The food is ok, nothing special. Again, I still don't know why I keep coming here, but rest assure that I won't be coming here unless a friend is really dying to dine here. Why come to this place when there are so many other wonderful restaurants in San Diego!?"
Christina F.,"San Diego, CA",44,5,,5.0,11/10/2013,"came for dinner with my husband tonight, the wait was not as long as we expected. hosts were not very friendly but the one guy host who sat us was, we got a nice table on the heated outdoor patio. Food was great, service was excellent. Xavier was friendly, helpful, and very attentive. did not have to ask for anything he anticipated our needs and was spot on. We got cheesecake to go and of course was amazing. Thanks for the great service Xavier."
jax v.,"San Diego, CA",39,102,2,3.0,5/24/2011,"I DONT GET HOW YOU DRAW THE CROWDS. yes, factory you got some tastey treats, but Im not waiting 2 hours to find out. the madness of crowds waiting indoors, outdoors, on benches and standing up, just baffles me. your good, but not that good.  good thing I can work a crowd, drop my name for a table and keep your eyes on open seats at the bar like a vulture to avoid the wait. I did. we sat. in less than 20 minutes v our estimated 1 hr wait. word! PARKING at a mall location, usually pretty easy to find parking and free.  FOOD Now we had some amazing plates.  Tex-Mex egg rolls with cilantro sauce-GADZOOKS thats good! Bang-Bang! chicken n shrimp w rice-some thai inspired dish that would make a re-run in the future Thai Lettuce wraps-my 95% vegetarian dieter amigo worked these wraps including the chicken--beware this refreshing yummy dish can be messy. but fun. assembly required. DRINKS Georgia Peach! hella amazing blended drink. I saw the bartender hooking this up and immediately changed my order. I was not disappointed. mojitos-sooooo good, and in a tall glass : ) SERVICE being at the bar we pretty much had it made just flagging down our bartender whenever we needed something. AMBIANCE crowded like bees round honey and LOTS of folks bring their kids, including strollers. lesson of this story is, don't come hungry. but by the time your seated with food in front of you, you'll be fine. AND THEN you may enjoy yourself (sans crying baby at the next table)."
Sara T.,"La Jolla, CA",64,28,2,4.0,8/30/2011,"While the wait at Cheesecake is always 30 minutes or more--I always find that it's worth it.  Basically...the wait is the worst part.   Besides that, I always find that the service is great and the food is delicious!  My favorite is the Chicken Bellagio and sometimes a smooth Dry Martini.  What's not to love about blue cheese stuffed olives!  The hand-battered onion rings are some of the best onion rings around and a great appetizer. Cheesecake can be pricey, so I don't go too often because I'm a college student.  But, for a special occasion it's the perfect place.  Plus, while you're waiting you can go shop around the huge Fashion Valley Mall!"
