Christopher C.,"Buena Park, CA",500,238,45,3.0,12/22/2011,"I came here with about 20 other people to celebrate a couple friend's birthdays.  We were all adorned in ugly Christmas sweaters for fun :P Fashion Valley was of course packed! Of course, our party being so big, we had to wait a pretty long time even though one of my friends came at 3pm to make a reservation for 5pm. It's understandable. Our waitress was pretty helpful and fast although she did look like she wanted to get off work :P and later found out her shift ended in the middle of our dinner.  Maybe she wasn't going to get a chunk of the tip, hehe.  Anyways, the new waiter was pretty good.  He was on top of bringing our water and stuff. For me, the food is the issue.  I probably got the wrong thing, but I was splitting with a friend who is gluten sensitive so it couldn't be helped.  The bread was alright.  Not the best bread I've had, but not the worst.   We got the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo (although might've not been gluten free since gumbos are made with roux).  The gumbo came out with rice on top.  My first spoonfuls of gumbo were pretty much oil.  It was also really thin (so maybe they didn't use a roux). Although, the chicken wasn't overcooked and maybe a tad on the shrimp, but not bad on the meat.  However, I really didn't like their gumbo overall. Bleh. I had a bite of my friend's kalua cheesecake.  It was pretty good.  Although I would definitely not pay that much for one SLICE of cheesecake.  I could probably make a whole cheesecake with 7 bucks. Yeah, I'm not really a fan of Cheesecake Factory for their food.  I'm sure a lot of their food is just half-assed since their menu is freaking huge. Although one thing I did appreciate was that they individually split our bill! Wah for 20+ people, awesome!  This place will just be if my friends invite me, I wouldn't come here on my own."
Kile D.,"San Diego, CA",30,116,8,5.0,10/25/2013,Had fantastic service with Jonathan tonight! Sorry my husband doesnt know the tipping ratio.... if I were not on the phone you would have a propper tip! johnathan took our order (in his mind) amd got everything right!
Mariah H.,"San Diego, CA",6,7,3,5.0,4/12/2014,"I absolutely love this restaurant! It's so fancy and I personally don't find it that expensive. I got there for so many events such as for my birthday and my friends' birthday. There food is heavenly and makes me so full. They have the best desserts! There's so many cheesecakes to choose from and other desserts besides cheesecake. My person favorite is their Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo and I also love their steak! They have the best break and the service there is delightful. Sometimes it's a long wait but luckily it's located right next to a mall so you can keep yourself busy. And, trust me it is always worth the wait. Me and my boyfriend went there for our anniversary and it was his first time and he fell in love. It's perfect for family, friends, or a romantic date!"
Jen Q.,"San Diego, CA",23,70,18,5.0,1/6/2012,"The lunch specials are awesome. For about $10, you can get a decent sized plate of pasta. My favorite one is the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. The sauce to it is amazing. They have a huge variety of cheesecakes so remember to leave room for dessert.  You get a basket of bread in the beginning so dont fill up on it like i do everytime :)"
Stephanie L.,"Mountain View, CA",346,356,296,2.0,12/16/2010,"Not a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in general because I feel like they're contributing to our obesity issues. Not that I have anything against greasy food but I almost feel like Cheesecake Factory makes grease a requirement for something to be tasty. I came here for an office party and got the Chicken Marsala. Their portions are huge. I like that the dish is really sweet from the Marsala Wine and that they pound the chicken into really thin filets. Their pasta is also cooked al dente. BUT, my meal was honestly COATED in oil--it was good however, it left me feeling so heavy and sluggish after my meal. Most of their meals actually make me feel this way.  I especially don't like that they are probably one of the few chain restaurants that still don't have whole wheat pasta as an alternative AND, they have a ""low carb"" menu with chicken that is served with WHITE RICE--cmon'! it's 2010, please learn to sub your ""healthier"" options with actual healthy options like brown rice.  It's the Cheesecake Factory so I guess I can't complain, you know what type of food you're getting once you step in.  Service is nice and their peach bellinis are delicious (for people who can't handle a ton of alcohol)! ..but I just can't support this restaurant."
Dean S.,"Santee, CA",6,106,34,4.0,1/31/2012,Never thought a chain place could make such a good meal.  Come early or be prepared to wait in line.   O and if you couldn't tell from the name they have allot of cheesecake.
Tommy C.,"San Diego, CA",12,41,1,4.0,9/5/2013,"Came here around 5pm on a Sunday during Labor Day weekend. Cheesecake Factory was crowded as usual but I found a high table to sit at before the wifey could even make a reservation. FYI, high tables in the bar area are first come, first serve. Ordered the roadside sliders, crusted chicken romano lunch special, and S'mores cheesecake (Hershey's Cheesecake topped with chocolate ganache. Finished with toasted housemade marshmallow, Honey Maid graham crackers and whipped cream) to share. Sliders very tasty. I always get the chicken romano. S'mores was good but a little too sweet for us."
Chrissy N.,"Seattle, WA",193,483,13,3.0,2/22/2011,"Why is there always an 8 year line to get a table here? Sad times. Anyways, it's to be expected and I always come with an empty tummy and an open mind. The service is kind of hit and miss, but I don't think I've ever had a terrible waiter/waitress experience here. Which is good. The good is really lackluster in my opinion. The prices are fair for the portions you're getting, but I've tried several dishes over the last few years and nothing has really stuck out to be great...or even really good for that matter. The cheesecake though. Omg, the cheesecake. You can not go get food here and skip out on the cheesecake. That's blasphemy! So good. My favorite? The pumpkin cheesecake--unfortunately they only serve it a few months out of the year around the holidays. Sad panda :[ Overall, not too bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if some friends wanted to stop by, I wouldn't be opposed. Just be prepared to wait a while for your table...especially on the weekends."
Sarah N.,"San Diego, CA",146,36,4,4.0,10/5/2013,"Sooooo. I wrote a review about a month ago. I have been a fan and been coming regularly here every month for about a few years or so. I love the food (chicken and biscuits) bombbbb ! Anyway, i came last night, and the last two times before last night was a nightmare. Both times we waited an hour or more for our plates and the service sucked! Decided to give it one more shot and came last night, Hillary was our server. She was very helpful and attentive. She was workin hard with all the tables she was serving, and this time it only took us 15 mins for our food :) yayyyyy"
Christian Anthony P.,"Escondido, CA",80,101,71,4.0,11/30/2011,"Having learned that appetizers can be considered as a full meal, I helped myself to just ordering them. Having ordered entrees from a previous visit and having leftovers made me decide on getting appetizers instead. Their portions are filling and huge, plus being tasty too. Classy looking restaurant from the exterior to the interior decoration. Bring home a slice or two or even a whole cheesecake on your way out. Nice atmosphere to dine with friends, family, and/or coworkers. Hey, if dining alone, you might meet someone new here, too."
Gabriele D.,"Milan, Italy",10,12,21,4.0,1/27/2014,"I've been here in a saturday without making any reservetion. I had to wait just 15 minutes. We all took some burgers: 2 classic, bbq. Mine burger was delicious and perfectly coocked ( I asked it rare). The waitress has been so gentle during all the night. The waiting time from the order to the arrival of the meals was perfect (15 mins) and the bread was so delicious."
Dave P.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,46,,1.0,2/18/2011,"Well,  Who here enjoys eating cooked plastic? the one star rating is based on my last experience at this cheesecake factory. Normally these places are good, and the food here was, albeit a tad overpriced for what it is, but this morning when I reheated my leftover chicken and bit into it, I found a bunch of plastic embedded in it. Apparently the Cheesecake factory doesn't believe in actually cooking their food and simply serves reheated, plastic bagged frozen food. hey, I get it... they are busy, and it still tastes pretty good, but cheesecake factory management?  In the future, if you are going to serve reheated food from plastic bags like mcdonalds does, could you do me a tiny favor and MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL THE FUCKING PLASTIC OUF OF THE CHICKEN SO I DON'T END UP EATING A BUNCH OF TOXIC COOKED PLASTIC? Thanks, -Dave"
Annie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,63,,1.0,10/4/2012,"It was my first time dining at this location and it will also be my last. Six of us came here to celebrate my best friend's birthday, but I will speak for myself in this review.  My experience at this restaurant progressively worsened throughout the night.  After being seated, our waiter, Matthew, greeted us in a melancholy manner and remained impersonal and robotic the entire time.  He was not interested in creating a great dining experience; he seemed to question our satisfaction only out of protocol, not genuine concern. The birthday girl decided to order a cocktail, and as she was reaching for her ID, I told our waiter it was her birthday.  He nodded without a word or a smile and just stood there, waiting for her ID.  Don't people usually wish others a Happy Birthday out of courtesy?  When we asked if he could take a picture for us, he simply stuck his palm out, without a word, waiting for one of us to hand him a camera.  Is it wrong for me to assume waiters/waitresses should be personable and verbal considering they encounter people every day?  Our waiter was impatient and lacked interpersonal skills.  He made us feel unwelcomed and acted as if we were inconveniencing him. To top it off, our waiter did not take directions well when it came time to pay.  Our bill was $146.45 (gratuity included).  We paid $90 in cash and asked him to charge two cards with $29 each, totaling $148.  He did not bring us back our receipt or our change from our cash payment and somehow added a $4 tip on top of each $29 credit card charge.  When we explained his error to him, he did not apologize.  All he said was, ""I'll give you your $2.""  I was insulted and repulsed by his nonchalance and his lack of remorse. At the end of our meal, I calmly addressed my concerns with the Manager, Chuck, but even he proved unhelpful and offered no sense of concern for our discontent.  My experience at this location was contradictory to The Cheesecake Factory's company mission: ""To create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority.""  Our waiter dampened our spirits on what should have been a festive and fun night.  The service and experience I received singlehandedly shattered my positive image of The Cheesecake Factory."
Alice R.,"San Diego, CA",23,210,5,5.0,8/30/2013,I didn't realize they expanded the patio here - IT IS BEAUTIFUL! Perfect location for a dinner on a warm summer night. The food is what you'd expect from Cheesecake Factory and the wait is definitely going to be there but it's a nice restaurant to go with pretty consistent service and food.
Julianne V.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/3/2016,"My husband and I recently went to the Cheesecake Factory in the North County Fair mall, Escondido. We thought we'd give them another try to get it right. Unfortunately, like two previous occasions we were disappointed. We went early to avoid the dinner rush, there were very few other diners. The wait staff was slow to even acknowledge we were there. When we finally were able to place an order, it took over 40 minutes to receive our meals. My pasta dish came out  first but my husbands (burger and fries) was no where to be seen. When his food did arrive (10 minutes later) my food was cold and the taste was lacking to say the least. We came to dine together not separately  Our waitress never once checked in on us to see if we had any needs. I asked to speak to the manager. It took some time before he came our table. He looked at my untouched meal and said,  ""what, you didn't like it?""   When I explained my situation, he agreed that it was not proper protocol to bring dishes out separately but he was noticeably reluctant to act upon it so I prompted him by stating that I refused to pay for it. The wait staff did eventually get something right and removed my portion from the bill. Three strikes Cheesecake factory, we will seek any other place to dine when we shop at North County Fair."
Truc N.,"San Diego, CA",207,71,9,4.0,7/4/2011,"My favorite chain restaurant!!  Favorite thing to get there is the farfalle bow tie pasta with garlic cream sauce. YUM! I don't like white sauce usually but this one is awesome. However depending on the chefs, it can be a miss. Sometimes it's done perfect and other times it's too al dente or salty.  Service to me is usually consistent excepting one occasion when I wanted to kick my waiter in the face with my 5 inch heels. A notable mention is the last time we went there and my pasta was too al dente so I asked the waitress if she could just retoss it some more. She apologized and said she'll make me a whole new one. Then the manager came over to personally apologize that my pasta wasn't to my liking. Then the guy who brought the food out also apologized. Very above and beyond customer service. Very wide selection for everyone but if you like white sauce pasta you should get the farfalle!"
Mike J.,"St Peters, Saint Louis, MO",7,238,12,3.0,1/16/2014,"Ok so this was my first Cheesecake Factory experience. First, this was nothing like I seen on Big Bang Theory, just saying... Next the place was packed so I figured it has to be good. Got seated quicker than I thought and started looking through the menu... This thing is huge! Why is everything a specialty? How can one place have an entire diverse cultural menu with all specialties? Anyway, I had the spicy cashew chicken, it was good and the price was ok for as fancy as this place looked! The service was good and friendly. I don't think I will be visiting any Cheesecake Factories very soon though. Just rather go to a good Chinese, Indian, Thai, Mexican, Italian, or American restaurant and let them keep all there Americanized specialties to others."
Kathleen C.,"San Diego, CA",25,25,1,4.0,1/23/2012,"I docked 1 star for the wait [which can literally be hours, which are doubled on the weekends], but other than that, service and food is always great when I come here! I always come here when there's a small birthday to celebrate with friends, and every time, I have had extremely wonderful servers.  The food is always great too; I never get that greasy man-i-wish-i-just-ate-a-salad feeling.  I have seen a couple send back not ONE, but TWO, dishes that they were not pleased with, and their waitress continued giving them nothing but her best .. regardless of their nasty attitude.  Prices are just right, and I will continue to come to this location."
David O.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/20/2014,Expect a long line and the average wait time is about 30 minutes - but the menu is huge and delicious and definitely worth the wait. I recommend the dark chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.  A little on the pricy side.
Diana Q.,"San Diego, CA",43,11,,3.0,3/18/2014,"The menu is a novel, I spend more time going over the menu than actually eating my food.  The food is really good though and the portions are gigantic if you enjoy leftovers"
