Andre H.,"Issaquah, WA",20,5,,5.0,9/22/2011,"It was my birthday last week, and I decided to take myself out for a quiet dinner at The Cheesecake Factory! They were busy, so it took a while for me to get seated, and it took a bit for them to cook my meal,(thank goodness for bread and mini crab cake appetizers!) I ordered the Jamaican Peppered Shrimp which came with white rice,black beans and mango salsa!I also added chicken chunks to the meal..and when it was finally served to my table, it was hot and well placed on the plate. I haven't gorged myself on food like that in a while, it was THAT delicious! Somehow, I was able to even fit down half of my slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake before I simply had to tap out! I'm sitting here imagining that cheesecake now.. (*_*) Dre86"
Roman J.,"San Diego, CA",22,16,8,5.0,1/11/2014,"Been there only once but will definitely visit again. Liked the food, drinks, and of course dessert. Best cheesecakes in town. The place is somewhat pricey but that is to be expected since its fashion valley mall. The only small inconvenience was that we had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated."
Lauren A.,"San Diego, CA",85,16,1,1.0,1/25/2015,"This is the worse experience I had at this restaurant. Usually this place is not bad even during the busiest times of the day, but today was just the worse. I took my mom here to celebrate her wedding anniversary, by the way my dad is dead. When we arrived the host told us the wait was only 15 minutes. I figured they forgot about us since 15 minutes later my buzzer did not buzz. I gave them a little window and finally asked about our wait time. Turns out the host entered our pager number wrong. She didn't apologize for her mistake but she did seat us next. I thought okay whatever.. I'll let that go. Then our waitress came along and made everything worse! She had no smile, didn't ask us if we were celebrating anything.. And she didn't even give us bread. Wtf was that about. So I gave her a chance to redeem herself. Our food took long to get to our table and it wasn't even that busy. We had to ask for bread.. We had to ask for cheese for our pasta... She didn't check on us at all. Usually I've had waitresses let me know what's taking so long and just small talk. The only time she talked to us was when she handed over the check.. So I didn't tip her at all. :) lesson learned don't get waited by chalise if you're ever gonna eat here.. I'm def not coming back. Id rather drive farther for better service!"
Jacqueline G.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,4.0,2/17/2014,I absolutely love the cheesecake but not the wait. Waiting for an hour is a long time. Customer service is ok. My favorite cheesecake is the classic with strawberries and the vietnamese sandwiches are good too.
Kelly M.,"San Diego, CA",4,34,2,1.0,2/16/2014,"Poorly ran Cheesecake. They lost our wait list spot, then it took 45 min to get just our Appetizer. Of course our meals came out 3 min after the appetizer."
Ryan W.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,105,15,5.0,12/5/2011,"I have gone here a couple times with my girlfriend. Recently I got the   and it was heavenly.  5 stars. I like how you can eat outside, and indoors has tall ceilings (if I remember correctly) and looks sorta cool. The wait for a table can be very long.  And the time I ate outside, the heaters weren't strong enough, so we were shivering.  But that Evelyn's Favorite Pasta dish is good enough to make me come back for more."
Debbie B.,"San Diego, CA",25,9,,3.0,7/23/2013,"I normally love to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, but I got to say that the last time I eat at this one, I didn't have the the best service they usually give...me and my party ordered appetizers before ordering our main dishes, but they took for ever to arrive and by the time the server brought them over, they came along with the main dishes...but the worst of all, was the servers attitude when we complained about the situation...although I have to say that once we spoke to the manager, he gave us half price discount for the inconvenience...hope I have a better time if I decide come back to this place."
Ellen P.,"San Diego, CA",61,145,196,3.0,6/8/2011,"It's the perfect place to grab lunch with a friend. The lines are about 15-20 minutes long but you can walk around the mall until it's your turn so the wait is not bad at all. ***I recommend you go before 5:30 PM because that is when the lunch menu works and all of the entrees are usually around $5 cheaper on that menu and the portions of food isn't that big of a diffference from the dinner menu**** SERVICE: service is always amazing. They're always friendly, know what they're doing, frequently checking up on us, etc. AMBIENCE: It gets pretty loud and hectic in there which is why I wouldn't define it as fancy or an ideal place for a date. It's just another restaurant to grab lunch with some friends or family. It has a pretty nice interior but nothing too fancy. FOOD: I usually get the same things when I go. I think Cheesecake Factory is a hit or miss restaurant. Most of the dishes are amazing because each dish has some unique sauce or seasoning to it that only CHeesecake Factory manages to produce! But, there's some dishes that aren't up to par with the other ones and have a funky or bland taste. My favorite is the Louisiana Chicken pasta (It's a must get!) The avocado rolls as appetizers are yummy. and for drinks i ALWAYS get the strawberry lemonade (free refills!)"
Lorenzo B.,"Poway, CA",0,89,,3.0,6/22/2013,"I would not place the Cheesecake Factory within the category of fine dining, or in the category of unique dining experiences. However, with their large selection of items and really delicious cheesecakes, it is a safe bet as far as chain restaurants go. Granted, they all look identical and rather impersonal, and the food is as refined as standardized food can be. But this restaurant consistently delivers decent and fun food and prices are not horrible (not cheap either though). Our personal favorites are the avocado egg rolls, the jamaican pepper shrimps and the pineapple upside-down cheesecake."
Dianne L.,"San Diego, CA",24,4,,1.0,4/4/2015,"I don't  even want to give 1 star to this place. What an embarrassment! We took out of town visitors there on Friday evening and the service was absolutely horrible. First we waited a long time for service, which is understandable on a busy Friday Easter weekend night, but then when we did get service it went from bad to worse.  We were seated outside, so it was evidently a long walk from the kitchen so getting all 7 of us our meals took a while. Then the water dropped the container of catsup which splashed on one of our visitor's very expensive swede shoes as well as on 2 other's shirts. Of course he apologized and gave our guest a wet paper towel to clean off his shoe. A wet paper towel and an I'm sorry. It didn't get any better after that. The same guest asked for mustard for his burger and waiting almost 10 minutes for it!  If this were in almost any other place I have been, a manager would have come to the table to offer his/her apology and done something to compensate for the accident. But here, nothing. My guest did even say something to that effect to the waiter, but the waiter just responded with "" I did apologize and it was an accident."" I was even more embarrassed by that. During dinner, there were at least 2 more spills of things - one was a tray of candles crashing to ground, and I don't even know what the other was. The staff moved things around to clean up the glass and then left one of the portable heaters so close to my chair that I all but fell when I got up to leave. There was no concern for or even awareness of the comfort and safety of their patrons. Needless to say I left a terrible, insulting, tip (and I am normally a very generous tipper), but I'm sure the waiter didn't think he did anything to deserve the insult and likely only thinks I am cheap.  Never will I go there again nor will I recommend it to anyone."
Joel G.,"San Diego, CA",144,829,5,4.0,4/16/2013,"pros...on a beautiful warm day you would almost think that you are somewhere else, besides fashion valley mall.  that is the feeling one gets when here at the Cheesecake Factory.  just a lot of beautiful people having a good time, and eating and talking and hanging out.   the food and service here are nearly top rate.  and way better than the one in Chula Vista, which was where i used to frequent.  but this one was the first one and it still is tops for me.  love how the menu changes, and how you can get really good cheesecake too.  i am not a fan of the traditional New York cheesecake stuff, a bit too tart for me.  but the stuff they make here is just tops in my book. cons...super bad parking, unless you park in the paid structure which is right there.  long and very busy wait times, especially when the weather is nice.  but on a day like today, it was not that long at all.  so go on a rainy, gloomy day in San Diego."
Stephanie D.,"San Marcos, CA",284,153,1,4.0,5/20/2011,"I really like the cheesecake factory. I really like their spicey chipotle chicken pasta and am glad that they have a lunch portion since their dinner portions are pretty huge. It's not too spicy and the sauce is amazing. Their small plate of crab and artichoke dip is very good too. It has the right amount of crab in it and goes well with the buttered bread they serve it with. The only thing is that it was a little too oily for me. Their factory nachos are HUGE...but good. It comes with guac which i love, sour cream, salsa, and jalapenos. I'm not really a nacho person but theirs was pretty good. Their mashed potatoes are a different story. If they don't come with the plate I want to order, I always order a side of them. They are the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted. They have the right amount or garlic in them and they don't make them mashy. They leave chunks in there...just how I like my mashed potatoes! To top things off, I usually like to get a slice of their red velvet cheese cake or white choco raspberry cheesecake to go. Each has their own unique flavor and I would recommend these 2 any day!"
Erin W.,"San Marcos, CA",86,47,169,5.0,11/11/2013,Best food for a good price. Great drink menu and great ambience. A model of how to run a great restaurant.
Cody S.,"El Cajon, CA",3,10,,3.0,6/26/2013,"Not bad. Food is good for the most part. A huge turn off are the prices and wait time though. Every time I go, doesn't matter if it is in the afternoon or the evening , there is always an annoying wait time...sometimes longer than 30 mins. The prices are also a turn off....a slice of cheesecake is nearly $10 ....I can buy a whole cheesecake from the store for that price."
Penny P.,"El Cajon, CA",3,39,,1.0,11/1/2010,We went to the cheesecake factory yesterday and the service was horrible and the food was worse.  We ordered soup and it ended up being a paste.  We ordered the meatloaf and they used soo many spices we couldn't even taste the meat.  We also got the Pasta Carbonara. It was very bland!!!  And garlic does not mix well with bacon!!! it was gross We will not be going back.  It was also a little pricy. For the 2 of us to have lunch it was $47 My husband is a truck driver and he said food served at a truck stop is better than cheesecake factory.
D S.,"San Diego, CA",37,203,7,3.0,9/11/2013,Garlic noodles with shrimp gave me a little indigestion.  Peach smoothie was delicious. Cheesecake is always awesome =) Always looks suuuuper busy but the wait isn't that bad.
Terry J.,"Carmichael, CA",1,21,,2.0,3/21/2015,"Food was great!!  Just too bad the service wasn't.  My wife ordered a soft drink and I ordered coffee.  Not once were we offered a refill.  We finished our food and had to sit and wait almost 15 minutes before our server came to our table.  I noticed one time she walked by and giving her the benefit of the doubt, seemed to look away from us rather than stopping.  When she finally did, asked for a box and also some coffee.  she did offer to put the coffee in a to-go cup.  However, when I got the coffee, it was only 3/4 full, at best, more like 1/2.  She was fortunate to get 10% gratuity, much less my usual at least 20% and my initial thought of $1.00.  We've been going to Cheesecake Factory for years and this is our first bad experience.  Hopefully, it will be the last.  Just in case this review is read by management, without names, our ticket was 0721, table 37 on 3/21/15 at 17:21."
Kristen M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,8,1,1.0,1/22/2014,"There food is Amazing I give them that, But no reservations really? I wanted here for prom with 17 other people and they said its first come first serve! I just wanted a special night with a good atmosphere and food. Not recommending them to anyone."
Lynn X.,"San Diego, CA",49,15,,5.0,6/10/2013,"Fantastic food and of course, dessert to die for! It took a while to get our food ordered but we had the best service because of how one concern was addressed. I want to give a great big THANK YOU to our absolutely awesome waiter, Jason, who politely asked the rude smoker (smoking right outside the premise but blowing his crap directly to the tables, food and customers, and including towards several children) to move or extinguish his carcinogen. Those are my words. Come on, smokers, when will you ever get a clue? I heard the kids next to our table gagging about the stench. Anyway, this smoker kindly did, shocking because usually they get righteous. The patio has been expanded and there is a beautiful fountain as if Fashion Valley wasn't already gorgeous. So, come on in, ask for awesome Jason and tip him well.  He is truly customer service-oriented!!!"
Andy H.,"Vista, CA",302,431,93,4.0,9/13/2010,"I usually tend to avoid reviewing ""chain"" restaurants but since Cheesecake Factories are rare in my area and my experience has always been a medium to positive one, I thought this place deserved a review.  Let's just get the bad stuff out of the way: the wait is horrendous, almost every night, there is a gonna be a bad wait. While the service can be up and down... one thing that is constant is the management that goes out of their way to please you. There have been times where my food hasn't been on par or was wrong, but leave it to management to come by and check to see if everything was okay. They have even compted my plate because of their mistakes. Their menu is chalked full of different items ranging from varies regions. There is something for everyone. Yes, it could get overwhelming but I think it works for them because in the end, the food is backed by them. I have a love/hate for their pasta dishes but their burgers and salads are huge! I hate them for getting rid of my pesto/pine nuts chicken pasta dish but I did like their Shrimp Franchesa. I love the Bacon Cheeseburger with onion straws. MM MM good. While their food isn't an ""orgasm for the mouth"", its pretty good and huge for the price you pay. Now its not cheap by any means, you definitely jump when you see the bill if hole-in-the-walls are more you... but the food is delicious and their service (can be sucky at times with the host/hostess and waiters). And yes, the cheesecake is delicious, even for a lactose intolerant person like me. :)"
