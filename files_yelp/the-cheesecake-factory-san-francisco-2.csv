Supawat J.,"Miami, FL",1,67,421,5.0,12/31/2017,Perfect as usual..back to this place again.Nice view.Food is always great.Cheese cakes are awesome.Service  is superb.  Every time I visit San Francisco. I have to come to this location. LOVE IT!
David N.,"San Jose, CA",126,91,20,3.0,1/6/2018,Good food; nice atmosphere; too loud. Since when do we allow smoking on the patio overlooking Union Square? This must be against some kind of city ordinance. I enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner. They were outstanding and filling.
Aubrey D.,"Fairfield, CA",356,413,569,2.0,1/6/2018,"I only want a slice of cheesecake, but why does this specific location makes ordering a slice so difficult? Oh wait... That's right! It's the ultimate tourist trap for all travelers and locals alike! Location: You can find the restaurant at the tippy top floor of the Macy's within San Francisco's Union Square. Just take an elevator and enjoy the 45 seconds of awkward silence as the elevator rushes people to the top. From there you will find a dimmed restaurant with thousands of tourists and disgruntled employees. On the other hand, good luck finding parking! Your best bet is to park inside one of the parking garages unless you're daring enough to walk 5-10 blocks from the area. Be prepared with some cash as some parking places take cash only. Setting: As I mentioned before, the CCF is at the tippy top floor of the gigantic Macy's. This place is great for a h-angry someone who ADORES waiting 20-120 minutes for a seat to dine-in. Not to mention ordering a slice of cheesecake to-go can be just as long as waiting for a seat to dine-in. While the views at the top are spectacular during the night time, there's seating inside of the restaurant and on the outdoor balcony. While this restaurant is noisy full of chatter from different patrons, if you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, I highly suggest you look elsewhere. Customer Service: I feel the pain for the employees who have to work twice as hard to ensure everyone is happy. However, I have to give them kudos for working at the busiest CCF on the planet. Despite all the patrons coming in and out of the restaurant, they do a pretty decent job at handling the crowd. On the other hand, if you only want a slice of cheesecake to-go, I recommend ordering through the phone instead of waiting in line to order something. Food: I only have the Chocolate Macadamia slice of cheesecake. It was BOMB, smooth, and nutty. Even though there's a HUGE chunk of whipped cream on the side, the cheesecake itself is best shared with two people. On the other hand, for the $8-9 a slice, it would be a better option to find a dessert place who sells the same thing at a lower price. Overall: Despite the high prices, tourists, and all the crazy schemes happening at this CCF location, I'll give it a plus for the views at the top. However, if I were you, I'd find somewhere else to eat in SF that serves decent cheesecake at a lower price."
Casey S.,"Alameda, CA",1264,1302,269,1.0,1/5/2018,"I know there's that whole stigma going around that millennials don't like chain restaurants, but The Cheesecake Factory was just plain bad. Sure, the view of Union Square is nice, but it took an hour and a half just to get a table for two on a random Tuesday evening. Once we were seated, service came by intermittently. The jambalaya pasta wasn't great or terrible, but I got a bad case of food poisoning the following day. If you're in the area, I'd just go to Bartlett Hall or Katana-Ya instead."
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3294,1439,1446,5.0,12/28/2017,"Awwww this Cheesecake Factory is super special to me! It was the very first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to! I remember spending the day with my uncle and sister in SF when we were kids and my uncle took us here for lunch. When we were younger my sister and I would always order something from the kids menu like chicken tenders or something cheap but we always got to feast when we were with our uncle since he didn't have any kids himself. I remember my uncle ordered the crab cake burger (not sure if it's still on the menu) and he let me order it too! I felt like a million bucks! It was so delicious and I fell in love with Cheesecake Factory ever since. Throughout high school I would always go to this location with my friends. It has the best view of Union Square, especially during Christmas time with they have the tree up and the ice skating rink. I recently came back here with my mom on Friday for some mother-daughter bonding lunch while we were in the city shopping for Xmas. I really think Cheesecake Factory should rent out the floor below them of Macy's, it's not like people really shop department stores anymore anyway. It's always a super duper long line here because of the view. The wait was 45 minutes this time. The whole front desk area was crammed with people waiting for a table. I had time to go down a few levels and grab a white elephant gift.  Our server was nice as always whenever you go to any CF. I ordered the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken and my mom got the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp. Both were very good.  Great Cheesecake Factory location, just make sure you put your name down first before going shopping so that you can minimize your wait time."
Jennifer O.,"San Francisco, CA",634,662,1988,3.0,12/20/2017,"I normally don't do this.  I almost never ask to speak to a manager but after tonight's shenanigans in being seated, yeah, it was necessary. The Cheesecake Factory is deservedly busy, especially at this location on the top floor of Macy's Union Square, especially five days before Christmas. We only waited 40 minutes for a table, an estimate they accurately predicted. But as my little boy and I were led to the outdoor patio with beautiful holiday views of the Macy's Christmas tree, the skating rink and holiday lights in all the top drawer retailers' windows, the hostess led us to a table away from that view while 4-5 other tables were empty and service-ready.  I asked to be seated closer to the Union Square view. Hostess: ""Oh, those are reserved."" Me: ""Huh. They are? There's no designation."" Hostess: ""Well, they are. These two are reserved."" [Now highly suspicious and wondering why we were in this table push/pull] Me:  ""Well [pointing], how about this one?"" Hostess: ""That's reserved too, there's only this table."" Me: ""Well, what's the difference between THIS 4-top (hey, I waitressed my way through college, I got the lingo) and THIS one?"" Hostess: ""It's reserved."" Me: (Amused) ""No it's not."" Hostess: ""That's all we have, unless you want to wait another 30 minutes."" (Ok, now she threw down the gauntlet) Most people- especially hungry people avec child- would hear ""30 more minutes"" and fold at this point but not me. Me: ""Well...no one asked me if I wanted a *view* table, that if I did that it'd be a longer wait. Couldn't we just have *this table?"" Exasperated, she told us ""THAT'S what [she] was assigned"" (temper flaring) and asked us to follow her like naughty children being led to the principal's office. I looked at my child, he gave me a giggle, and we followed her... (Secret meeting at the reservation desk I wasn't privy to) A few moments later, she told us to follow her and  we were led back onto the patio and wordlessly given the table that'd been open to begin with. So I sat there with my son talking about his day and admiring the view. But after a few minutes, I realized my irritation wouldn't dissipate. So I asked the server for the manager, reassuring it wasn't her, she was lovely. Waiting, I pulled up my LinkedIn message page and when the manager came by, I explained what happened and how much I admired The Cheesecake Factory who was for a long time my client, the #2 guy who'd helped build the restaurant group having left the company but I was still friendly with. ""And oh here, look: My LinkedIn page- here he is, X sent me a note he was in Dubai last month."" I told the manager about the fable of the ""reserved"" tables and advised him not to lie to guests. He looked down, a little ashamed.  I lightly scolded ""Guests always find out and feel bad about it."" Seriously, The Cheesecake Factory, you're better than this and quality and consistency are your hallmarks. Of course the food was good, The Cheesecake Factory does everything well, but service in aggregate, rounded up to a sad C. Please let this have been a one day holiday crush/glitch but if not, fix."
Eamon S.,"Burbank, CA",119,114,54,4.0,12/17/2017,"Was on a family outing to San Francisco to see the Christmas lights. We decided what better place than the Cheesecake Factory for some lunch. I've been told the view is great at the top of Macy's, and sure enough it was great!  After the initial 1hr or so wait for a table. We were seated and greeted by Oscar. He was fantastic and really made our experience even better! We ordered our dishes and enjoyed our experience. I had the Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries which was delicious, and topped it off with a cucumber lemonade and a beautiful salted caramel cheesecake.  Will definitely be coming here again when in the city."
S R.,"Folsom, CA",3,114,257,5.0,12/30/2017,"Was my daily dinner joint while on business in SF. Place is a favorite of the people (locals and tourists) with huge crowds of 100s of people at the restaurant at a time. Restaurant is very well managed (kudos to the team) and its amazing how well they are able to take such good care of their customers from table allocations to quickly cleaning up tables with crew assigned to that specific task.  This is one location that is definitely worth the 20-30mins wait for a table. Food is delicious with many food options, arrived fast, service was exceptional."
Randall O.,"Hayward, CA",84,55,84,4.0,11/12/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and left with a SUPER filled belly. I highly recommend sharing your meal with your friends, unless you're already planning on taking home leftovers. This Cheesecake Factory is located next to Union Square, and if you choose to dine outdoors, then you get a nice view that overlooks SF's most popular tourist attraction. We came here in early November, so the big tree and the ice rink was already set-up! The only major con about eating outdoors are all the pigeons, so if you're not a fan, then make sure you specify that you want indoor seating only. Since we came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was a standard 30-minute to 1-hour wait. When we were finally seated, we had an awesome waitress who had lots of energy and also gave us amazing service. For food, we started with the Factory Nachos, which was a huge nacho dish complete with guac, salsa, spicy chicken, jalapeños, and sour cream. We shared this amongst 4 people, and it was so good that it went away in less than 10 minutes. After our appetizer, my friend and I split the Factory Burger. It was super moist and packed with flavor, and describing it is making my taste buds water because it was so succulent!  Of course, we had to order a cheesecake to finish off our meal. We got the specialty birthday cake cheesecake, which tasted like a funfetti ice cream cake! ALSO, the complimentary bread that they serve always wins me over, especially the whole wheat. Overall, we had a great lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. If I come here next time, then I hope to get the same waitress (I actually forgot her name, but she had this unicorn pin!) because she was a real MVP!"
Jim E.,"Oakland, CA",42,207,102,4.0,12/24/2017,This place has a HUGE selection and once again I over ate! the pigeons on the table next to us appeared to enjoy their meal as well.. Lol   our server was very nice ! We sat out on the terrace which was great!
Ara L.,"El Sobrante, CA",2,14,,2.0,1/1/2018,"We received very poor service from our server Oscar. We waited for 20 minutes for him to come, he was in the table in front of us flirting with two young ladies that seemed very uncomfortable with his solicitation of their personal information.  When he finally came to get our order he used vulgar unprofessional language. He referred to my father as ""yo what you want old man."" And to me ""what about you ma?"". We requested a different  server. A manager came and assured we would be taken care of. This didn't stop Oscar from making us feel uncomfortable. As we waited for our food he walked by and made various  comments, ""awkward, why are they here, people run their mouths, ugh,"" and so on.  Our food came in. The last entree came in 25 minutes after the first one: the food was not well cooked. This we understand, busy day. What follows, not so much. We waited for our bill to come and Oscar, sitting with other servers at a table nearby, was yelling ""why are these people here, they should go home."" We paid our bill and for obvious reasons left ZERO tip.  We walk to the elevator and Oscar yells our way, ""They left no damn tip, wow!"". I proceeded to take my daughter outside to see the view from the 8th floor. Then Oscar comes and mockingly yells ""happy new year!"". This made my entire family-- especially my daughter feel very uncomfortable. My father tells him to leave us alone. Oscar runs back to the table with the other servers. I ask for the manager. At this point Oscar gets violent and begins to yell at my father. Servers hold Oscar back.  Once the manager arrives, I demand a refund. Oscar's behavior is unacceptable. The manager assures I will receive a call and takes down my information. While I completely understand that Holidays are extremely busy days and the waiting times and even food quality may be compromised, patrons should not be subjected to harassment. We are regular patrons of this location and the one in Corte Madera and always recommend the restaurant to friends and family, especially people visiting from out of town. We don't feel comfortable coming back though. This experience ruined our New Years Eve dinner.  Already filled out the form on the website. Waiting to hear back from Mr. Kiernan.  Stars for the second server, she was cool."
Jenna G.,"San Francisco, CA",46,363,39,4.0,12/5/2017,"Cheesecake factory is pretty standard, and this location is extremely crowded. They don't have reservations, so on a Saturday night in December the wait was 1.5-2 hours for 2 people!! Bar is open seating though, so we sat there. I got a martini to drink, which was really good and had blue cheese stuffed olives NOM. For my main dish, I got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. I've had it before, it's only okay. Not super flavorful and the shrimp was definitely overcooked. However, I love the thinness of angel hair pasta. My boyfriend got the chicken and shrimp curry which I tried. It was pretty good, but heavy. I couldn't eat a whole plate of it. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a good place for a not too expensive meal, so great for families. They have a large variety on the menu too, but it's not the best for food snobs. Also their pumpernickel bread is bomb!!"
Tiffany M.,"Silicon Valley, CA",17,139,169,4.0,10/2/2017,Like any Cheesecake Factory you can expect the same standard recipes on the menu and great level of service! What sets this location apart from most other locations is the amazing view up above Union Square from the outdoor sitting area! It's great if you can sit outside. Just know this location is flipping amazingly busy so try off eating rush hour times for greater accommodating needs.  Definitely try this location sometime it's fun!
Roxy L.,"Olive Branch, MS",71,111,65,5.0,12/6/2017,Can't go wrong with this place especially during Christmas time! It is a little bit of a wait however we were blessed to only wait 5 minutes on a Wednesday @ 4:30 awesomeness!! I love their charbroiled hamburgers so juicy!! Mmmm Love this restaurant. This is a must see when  in San Francisco area.
John O.,"Novato, CA",17,45,18,5.0,12/12/2017,"Top of the Macy's building. Long waits but worth the views to dine outside over Union Square. Of course good food and cheesecake. Staff is great, well paid so better than most."
Christine B.,"San Jose, CA",59,125,54,5.0,11/24/2017,"We've come here two years in a row for the Union Square Tree Lighting. Last year we went after the lighting and this year we went before. So I can only speak to their service and food on what is probably their busiest day of the year. They're located on the 8th Floor of the MACY's in Union Square. You can either take the escalators or take the shorter way up the elevator.  It is ridiculously busy when you get to the lobby. The wait is long. Like 1.5 to 2 hours long and that's just ""first available,"" so there is no guarantee you're going to make it to the outside balcony that oversees the tree and the ice skating rink.  We've always eaten in the bar area, tonight right at the bar. The bartenders were fantastic. They're attentive and polite even though they're being pulled in every direction. I was also able to watch them interact with other customers and they were friendly and efficient with everyone.  The portions are very big. But the prices are affordable, especially for the amount of food. The bread they bring out before the meal is amazing! It's a wheat bread of some sort (maybe honey wheat) and it's warm. It was the perfect snack to hold us over till our meals came.  I love the festivity of this area around this time of year so it's a great spot to try during the holidays. What I would suggest, and may do in the future, is to come on a not-so-busy day and sit outside and enjoy the tree and skating from above. Someday I'd actually like to sit out there and get the full experience, but that day will never be on a Black Friday."
Zoe F.,"Canoga Park, CA",525,196,66,5.0,11/7/2017,"I know most cities have a Cheesecake Factory so if you don't want to eat here, come here for a drink and the view.  This particular location is nestled right no top of Macy's in the middle of Union Square. They have an outside patio that looks out and gives you a pretty spectacular view, especially at night when everything is lit up.  The menu has about everything you could ever imagine. One of my favorites is the Chicken Bellagio. It's a really delicious chicken pesto dish. Hard to find these days. The drinks are always great and it's all reasonably priced. Of course, there will be a wait. We usually try to find a spot at the bar since it's first come first serve. If it is your first time visiting here, wait for the patio. The atmosphere is worth it all."
Sharine d.,"San Francisco, CA",127,274,98,3.0,12/30/2017,"This is the place to go when you have endless time...and endless patience.  Always, overcrowded with longggggggg waits...average 1-1.5hrs wait for table.  But, if you do eat here.....food surprisingly tasty.  Quantities large, service usually attentive, deserts yummy and Union Sq view is very pretty.  The only real problem is the lack of reservation system. The crowds that rush the elevator to reach the restaurant.  The mass mayhem that greets you when reaching restaurant level. The system for this location needs to be revamped. With that out of the way. .....on this occasion I was for fortune to get 2 seats in the bar area. We had exceptional,  EXCEPTIONAL. ...service from the bartender Charles. Placemat's immediately,  Drinks 2min later, bread order not long after, ordered crusted salmon dish and chicken reisling cream dish....both WONDERFUL!!!  Too many people cluttered in small area, but food & service was spot on exceptional.  Thank you Charles. ... exceptional experience to be waited on by you, while you non-stop filled dtink orders. Amazing!!"
Alice L.,"San Francisco, CA",24,184,658,4.0,8/16/2017,"Same as before, I love coming here and I love their food. However, the servers really need to step up. Our waitress was friendly tonight but the rest of the staff felt like they either just don't want to be here or I'm bothering them by asking for a simple napkin.  I was told the wait for a table inside for 2 on a Tuesday night at 9:00pm was 50 minutes. However, it ended up being only 25 minutes. Also, I appreciate the host for recognizing who were in line vs. who were cutting the line."
Kim P.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,51,185,1.0,8/13/2017,"DO NOT SEAT OUTSIDE!!! GROSS!!! I can't believe that I had lunch here, especially when I have a pigeon phobia LOL It was like a...""welcome to the pigeon world! ;D"" Haha I'm such a brave girl who went surfing without not knowing how to swim, but when it comes to pigeons....I am the biggest loser ever Lol Pigeons were everywhere. I know most people are not afraid of them so you probably wouldn't care... but guess what?! I know you all care about sanitation when you come to the restaurant, and let me be honest with you. There is literally NO way for Cheesecake Factory to keep this place clean. None of servers cared about it. These pigeons walked around to find foods, SAT ON THE TABLE even if there was no food (I saw them touching empty plates that was set for next customers), ATE LEFTOVERS(servers didn't take them away for so long), flew above your head & foods....etc. It was really, really gross. I strongly recommend you to sit inside if you want to enjoy your lunch/dinner. And what about foods? - fried mac and cheese : comes with 4 balls of fried mac and cheese. crispy enough and it wasn't too greasy or cheesy thanks to tomato sauce that came with. Pretty good. - avocado salad(?) : baaaaad....i could taste that avocado and greens were not fresh at all. Tortilla chips tasted weird too. I would never get this again, or at least not from this location. I left 70% of it. - chicken salad : I don't have a picture but this is what my moma got. She said chicken was too hard that she left all of them.  Overall, super baaaaad....! My sister got pepperoni pizza and popa got a burger and both of them looked okay. Not sure about taste as I didn't try."
Lisa C.,"San Francisco, CA",149,83,88,3.0,12/13/2017,"This is a typical Cheesecake Factory right in the heart of Union Square. The outside view is amazing, but that's the only unique thing it has going for it. I came here on a Sunday with my siblings (3 of us total) at around 11am, and it was packed. Luckily, we were seated pretty quickly since we had such a small party. The food was alright, and the service was efficient, albeit a little slow, but considering that it was packed, I don't blame them. We were seated inside since it was a bit chilly outside, but whenever I would come here, we always try to sit outside, especially near the edge since you get a great view of Union Square. Overall, this is a typical Cheesecake Factory, with an amazing outside view!"
M L.,"Orange County, CA",173,112,152,2.0,10/25/2017,"I actually really like Cheesecake Factory restaurants... been going since high school when they first opened up in Vegas. You always know what you're going to get. Unfortunately this location was super disappointing. Not only was I put on hold to even place my to-go order, they never picked up! So I walked over there from my hotel and waited. Just got an orange chicken which I've gotten many many times. The place was a mad house. People everywhere, no order amongst the chaos and it was so warm in there. My food didn't take too long but it ended up being super dry, over cooked and lacking that nice orange flavored sauce. Didn't taste like orange at all. I guess I really didn't know what I was getting at this location. Boooo."
Jann B.,"San Francisco, CA",135,83,112,1.0,12/19/2017,"On hold for 15 min in hopes to put in a to-go order. Called back to speak to someone else and was placed on hold again.  The hostess I spoke to mentioned that she was unable to take my order and that someone from the bakery would be able to assist me. However after another 8 min or so of waiting, I eventually hung up.  -_- Come ooooon."
Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",446,567,3746,4.0,7/1/2017,"We've got lots of Cheesecake Factories in the Bay Area. What's so special about this one? 8th floor outdoor rooftop of Macy's in DT SF, that's what! The view of union square is worth the wait, doesn't matter if you're a tourist or local. Heating lamps for those always cold folks or opt for dining indoors. Take the special elevator directly up or save time waiting and use 7 sets of escalators to view what Macy's women's/home has to offer. Take note of Starbucks on the 4th floor, Burger Bar on the 6th, and Boudin/Jamba/etc. in the basement. 35 min wait for two at 9pm Saturday night for outdoor seating! Time went by relatively fast but boy was the atrium packed! There was one rude hostess that obviously needed to go home and take a chill pill, but everyone else was polite. Someone probably told her to take a break cuz she disappeared for 20 min. Sometimes I forget how many tourists there are in the city; hosts ask for a US phone # and many didn't have one. Another observation: the bill holder has a card explaining customary tips in the US. Must be nice for servers to be paid better than minimum wage in the U.K. and elsewhere. Patrizah A. took great care of us-- super sweet and cheerful with a genuine smile, checked back at the right times and offered cheesecake recommendations since they discontinued white chocolate blueberry. The new cold brew Coffee & Cream Chocolate Supreme is a hit with caffeine lovers. Ultimate Red Velvet! Window seats! Our original table wasn't clean so we got better ones on the left side with fewer people around. Those seats got filled right before we left at 11! 12:30am closing time on weekends.  Food! I tried something new but similar to my Chicken Bellagio. Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta with crisp coated thinly pound chicken atop mildly spicy bow tie Cajun pasta with mushrooms and bell peppers. Yum! Couldn't finish this 2200 cal dish (oh heck no, half was for the next day) since I cleaned out my little Caesar salad and indulged in calamari. Sophie N. got the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, asparagus add on. Succulent shrimp! Strange how this dish is listed as Garlic Lemon Shrimp online, asparagus already added in. Excellent experience on the rooftop once again-- I hope it stays that way! Have patience and if you're so hungry you whine while in line, do everyone a favor and grab a snack downstairs in the basement, or mobile order some Starbucks!"
Gina T.,"Fullerton, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Restaurant AND Door Dash review: Food was cold, not even Luke warm. Fries missing. Waited 2 hours for my food. Canceled my original order because they were out of wings but still charged my card anyway. Mistake ordering a second time. I called the restaurant to let them know and they didn't care nor apologize and intentionally put me on hold for 9 minutes and never returned to the phone. I will never go back there. Driver was also unapologetic and said there was nothing he could do because ""he's just the driver"". Never using Door Dash again. Literal 4th time I've had orders with incorrect items or missing items."
ßenjämin Ä.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,193,54,1.0,12/23/2017,"Raw chicken!! Completely unacceptable by any means. Clearly this means the kitchen staff was rushed to get food out with no supervision by the kitchen management. Sloppy, sloppy food preparation practices. This place should be avoided unless you feel like taking a chance at catching salmonella poisoning."
Al H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",19,46,8,3.0,10/26/2017,"We had guests in from Michigan so we wanted a bite to eat before taking them to the airport. We got seated quickly which was great! It was a bit warm in the restaurant but anyways after taking our order and waiting a while to get our food which is understandable the waiter came out with 3 of the 4 orders. I guess there was a misunderstanding and one of the orders was never put in. I do believe it was an innocent misunderstanding, which was fine theses things happen. So the Order was later put in but due to our time crunch to get to the airport we just took the last order to go. We got an apology from the waiter and the manager which was nice. But you would think that for that kind of mistake they would leave that order off the bill, but they didn't, we ended up paying for it.  Cheese cake factory is known for its large portions! But after receiving the Togo box I noticed that it wasn't the portion size I've known cheesecake factory to be which was a bit disappointing.  Maybe it wasn't our day, hopefully a better experience next time! But the seating outside is an amazing view of union square!"
Amy W.,"San Francisco, CA",179,1041,1323,3.0,7/31/2017,"Great value for lunch! I had in my FB feed that yesterday & today were 1/2 price cheesecake day. I was in  worried that it would be a mad house/super crowded. 2 co-workers and I hatched a plan to leave the office at 11:25am on a Monday to get to Union Square to beat the lunch rush. The way they seat is annoying - you put your name and number in and they give you a buzzer. then when the buzzer goes off you mingle by the hostess desk until they can seat you (so really 2 separate waits  to be seated) - we were waiting particularly long on the 2nd wait (about 2 feet from the hostess desk) - so we asked - sure enough someone else impersonated us and took our seating. (I will say it is very touristy, and loads of non-English-speaking tourists, so maybe an honest mistake by one of them). But as soon as we asked about our name we were seated. The lunch specials are a good deal - my entrée was $14.50 and enough for 3 meals. The chicken parmesan pizza (really just a round shaped chicken cutlet (very thin) with cheese and sauce and some angel hair on top.   The bread at your table is very very good, a brown bread and a sourdough, both warm served with butter. It would be great if they kept things like sweet & low and ketchup on the table since it was a bit of trouble to flag down wait staff (3x for the ketchup for my friend).   But the super nice thing was that when we all put in a credit card for the bill - rather than the usual (split it 3 equal ways - our waitress actually split it by what we ordered -- wahoo! mine was cheapest). I got the banana cream cheesecake (so MANY choices of cheesecake, all 1/2 price on this day) - Next time I am going for the Oreo, which looked great. It was $20.95 for a filling entrée and dessert - with loads of leftovers I would happy go here 1x per year for a meal and a 1/2 price slice of cheesecake."
Cyrena L.,"Fremont, CA",24,5,3,2.0,12/24/2017,"Off the bat, we were seated promptly which was very nice on a holiday (Christmas Eve). It took only 10 minutes for a table of 6 since we got here at 11:00 am However, we were waiting for 25-30 minutes for a server and we decided to ask one of the nearby servers about where our server was and he was very nice and talked to the manager for us. So we waited for another 5 minutes and still there was no show. So we talked to a hostess and she told us she couldn't talk and shooed is away.  So the manager came over and brought another server for us, Josh. The manager explained that our server was stuck at the airport. If your server was not here, shouldn't you know about it and not put people in their section?  When it hit an hour and we still did not have our food in front of us, we talked to a hostess and she was very nice in helping us getting our food, the food arrived in 2 minutes after that.  The server kept running away after finishing whatever he needed at our table. Seemed like he was intimidated by us. We couldn't even ask him for a refill on our drink. The food was good so that's how they still get 2 stars, but was it worth the hour wait? No."
Brian B.,"San Diego, CA",289,127,68,1.0,11/28/2017,"I totally get why you only average 3 stars you have zero focus on service! I arrived told 20 min wait. Got pager waited in the bar. While waiting I noticed at least 10 2 tops open. 15 min Later a seat opened at the bar. I ordered a small salad and chicken Marcella. After 40 min nothing arrived, I asked bartender and he said its coming. Also again asked about bread said it was coming also another 10 min goes by now here for 50 min and a manager stops by to say sorry salad is taking so long we ran out of croutons. I said I'm good without croutons brought salad he asked if I wanted cracked pepper I said yes. Never cam back! I was out of tea food I could eat at one hour I gave up! Asked for a manager got same manger who did not bring pepper and he said sorry and walked off! Seriously guys service remember what that is? Never again Cheesecake Factory I guess you just want tourists !  Oh one more thing in the hour and 10 minutes I was at Cheesecake my pager never went off and the tables the two top by the bar were never seated empty the whole time I was there! When I asked about it as I left she told me she could not find me in system! Really?"
Angelique J.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,95,158,5.0,7/25/2017,"I don't have any complaints about this place. The food is always great! I sometimes like having dessert before my meal and I love the idea of cheese cake before dinner! I their pasta, their bread but honestly I enjoy their chocolate cake the most. It's just so rich and creamy but not overwhelming what so ever.  This branch particularly is extremely busy Bc it's in the heart of union square. Plus I feel like everyone also wants to go up to sit in the outside patio for the amazing view. Yes there is a wait, but you have to anticipate it! Especially in the union square, aka tourist fiasco. The staff honestly does the most, they have to deal with so much tourists on top on their local customers and it's honestly so busy all the time. I give props to them."
Abbie K.,"Rohnert Park, CA",93,12,1,1.0,12/4/2017,"Wow this is the worse place to go to ever!!!!!! I sat out side they didn't warn us on how chilli it was gonna get. The server wasn't even nice from the get go! When we asked to change our seats inside she got upset, we said we know it's an inconvenience but it's was making our food experience miserable. She then told us after we left the table that are food was ready after waiting over an hour. She basically said that if our food was cold it was are prob. Then we talk to the manger MIke and he did not care at all. We told him that we would pay for our drinks and leave. He didn't care at all and when I asked him why he didn't care he said nothing. We paid 30 for to drinks. When he gave us the check back he also gave us the wrong change and tried to short us $10. Don't come here worse customer service ever. Warning your better off with anything other than this."
Theresa R.,"Richland, MO",0,5,6,3.0,12/26/2017,"We have waited for 45mins which is great, had our table outside the view was amazing, the service was really good but the food wasn't that good compared to the other Cheesecake Factory places.  My pasta didn't have enough sauce on it and the portion was less than the normal. Overall it was good! Got scampi shrimp and it was for $20.99"
Valeria E.,"Ithaca, NY",13,30,57,4.0,1/6/2018,"We had a pleasure the meet the 2018 in the Cheesecake Factory at the Union Square! Besides the fact that we spent 2 hours waiting for a table, everything else was perfect. The service was very fast and server Nick was on the top of all our requests. I absolutely love when the servers advise you some dishes and listen to your preferences without pushing their own taste too much. Although the restaurant was supposed to close at the midnight, the guests were not rushed and were welcome to finish their cheesecakes with champaign overlooking the celebrating crowd from the balcony. A great start a new year!"
Dee G.,"Stockton, CA",9,43,45,2.0,12/26/2017,"Im a cheesecake lover but this establishment is not on my fav list. The wait is ridiculous, service is slow and not friendly or attentive. The food was meh!!!  I think they are so busy they just don't take the time to put love into their food. Overall disappointed. Oh yea and service was the worse!"
Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",866,705,1110,4.0,4/11/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite chain restaurants. This particular one is extra nice because it's located on the top floor of Macy's which overlooks Union Square. The view up here is absolutely amazing. With that said, this also means it's quite a touristy spot and it's crazy crowded. They gave a buzzer for when your table is ready, which allowed us to wander around the floors only to wait some more even after our buzzer went off. It's a Monday night and somehow still incredibly packed. We ended up sitting inside, which got quite stuffy. It also didn't help with how hot it got as we shared a bottle of wine. One of my favorites here has to be their complimentary bread, especially the honey oat one --yum! Make sure to ask for extra of those. Between the two of us, we ordered to share the Crab Cake Bites ($8), Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($18), and Steak Diane ($29). Everything was yummy and came in huge portions! I know the menu gets intimidating here, but my go-to has and will always be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Since we were so stuffed, it didn't leave us room for the cheesecake. Yet, we still got a complimentary ice cream since it was my birthday. This is still one of my favorite spots though!"
Isabella L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,16,2,3.0,12/20/2017,"Pros: - Good food and huge portions. - Their cakes are pretty awe-inspiring.  Giant slices and really scrumptious. Cons: - This is clearly a case of short-term gain and long-term payoff.  Their food is incredibly rich and probably not the healthiest.  I got quite sick after my last venture here. - REALLY LONG wait times, some of the worst I've seen in any restaurant.  If you come on a Friday night, you'll probably be waiting for well over an hour, crammed into a small waiting area like sardines, with loud music blasting in your ears."
Wanda G.,"Sacramento, CA",134,216,427,1.0,4/2/2017,"I've eaten here for years - probably 30 times or more. It's our go-to place when we are shopping in the city because it's easy and there are lots of choices. I loved this place until the last three times we've eaten here, which have all been bad. So, after our last visit here this weekend I think we won't be coming back again. Sad. We had bad service and bad food. I wouldn't normally give this place a one star review but it was bad three times in a row. UGH.  The service was SLOW. And our server (Glendi? not sure of her name) was bored by our presence and totally inefficient. We asked for water, and she brought one. Had to ask for another one. She never asked if I wanted another drink after I finished my drink. She didn't refill ice tea until asked. Just totally nonchalant about everything. I would give the service a D. But, and the end when she brought our bill, she made sure to put a notation on the receipt that ""tip is not included."" Duh. And rude.  My husband ordered the club sandwich. It was DRY AS A BONE. Burnt toast that looked and tasted like it had been under the warmer far too long. (C'mon, how do you ruin a club sandwich?) I ordered the Orange Chicken with rice and vegetables. Basically, we all know that this is breaded fried chicken pieces that they put in different sauces so I know what I'm getting. I've ordered it before also. Well, the chicken was also DRY AS A BONE. It looked like they drizzled a tiny bit of orange sauce over the chicken after it was already on the plate. Weird right??? So I waited 10-15 minutes for her to come back and I asked for a side of orange chicken sauce to put on my food. She comes back with this dish of sauce that had EXACTLY one teaspoon of extra sauce. I'm not even kidding. So I gave up. And I gnawed on my chicken. Gross.  We had two lunch entrees, two pieces of cheesecake, on daiquiri and one ice tea. It was $75.00.  NO. NO. NO."
Diana W.,"San Francisco, CA",73,413,48,4.0,8/30/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is...you know exactly what you'll get when you visit one, and this one is no exception.  The menu is reliable, and the service friendly at this location.   I suppose the stellar star would be the view from the outdoor patio tables, as you're in the skyseats over Union Square.  (This one is filled to the brim with tourists-not that that's bad, but you know the drill.) We had a regular 2 person, middle of the row half booth, which was fine.  Our wait was about 40 minutes on a Thursday night-there is usually a crowd lined up to put a name in for a table...so be ready to hang out a bit.  There aren't a ton of seats to wait on, so mostly people just stand around all over the place around the desk-which looks like madness. All in all, I'd definitely pop in again for a slice of cheesecake to go from the bakery counter.  (I do like the banana one!)   For dinner though, unless I was craving a certain Cheesecake Factory specialty, I'd probably just go somewhere more local in the area...there are tons of great restaurants on every street around Union Square.  :) Have fun! TIP: *  You can only put your name in the queue in person, so first come, first seated. * I don't know what the new Cakepay app is for, except for linking your payment cards, as it won't hold you a place in line...but while you wait, feel free to download it from the app store and fiddle around with it, you have time on your hands-LOL! *Use the Macy's escalators to the 8th floor to get right up to the checkin counter or if you can cram in, the elevator also goes right there..."
Steve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",299,200,261,4.0,3/22/2017,"I absolutely love this Cheesecake Factory.  I usually sit at the bar and have a drink and eat. I truly love the Cheesecake Factory just because it literally has everything - EVERYTHING. It's amazing.  Goes from burrito, to chicken pot pie, to burger to orange chicken, to fish tacos, biscuits and gravy, fish n chips - I think you get the picture here.   Reason number 2 is consistency - no matter what day, or hour ... your food will always be delicious.  They have a great bar! I have never had a bad drink here.  I often order drinks with tonic and have never felt my drink was ""weak"" or not to measure.  If you come here and have never tried an item you want to try ... do it. Take a leap of faith.  Anything you order will be a fair representation or standard of how it should probably taste."
