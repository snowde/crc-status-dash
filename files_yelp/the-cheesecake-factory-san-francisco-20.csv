Lorraine G.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/21/2017,"Absolutely horrible. Management Will, is extremely horrid and disrespectful. I will never eat here again. Management treated me and my party as if we were scum. If you want to be treated like crap and disrespected eat here. We asked for a window seat to see the view and the restaurant denied us and made us feel bad for requesting. The manager threatened to not give us service because we were upset they could not respect our anniversary request. We were so uncomfortable we did not want our meal and management threatened to call security in us."
Priyanka T.,"Downtown Oakland, Oakland, CA",27,2,3,5.0,8/20/2017,"This one is a long due review. My first time in San Francisco, this was the first restaurant we went to. Twice I've been here and twice it was crazy busy. Though they make an effort to seat you as quick as possible. I love the outside seating,its really windy but the view of the union square is worth it especially in a sunny day. The server was patient enough to wait while we went through their huge menu.Being a crazy bacon lover, I asked for the bacon cheese burger with extra bacon that I loved!!Took me a good hour to finish it up.Came with a good portion of French fries( salad was also an option) and pickles. My friend ordered a white sauce pasta which she had to take home because the portion was huge!! I had a simple mojito which was nicely made. In the finale we had the simple strawberry cheese cake which is a safe bet for a person like me who isn't such a big fan of deserts. Ratings Ambience-4/5 Value for food-5/5 Service-5/5 Tips-Keep in mind that the portions are huge so try sharing the entree if you don't want to take out."
Baihuan Z.,"San Francisco, CA",70,1,,1.0,8/19/2017,Got my order wrong twice. Asked for medium on my steak and got well done twice. Waiting so long just for them to do my steak wrong too.
Catherine S.,"San Francisco, CA",20,1,3,1.0,11/14/2016,"I ordered a fresh strawberry cheesecake 6-inch for my friend's birthday, it takes them 25 min to get me my cake and when i get home and get ready to surprise my friend, there is no strawberry on the cake like how it was displayed in the store. I'm pretty sure the fresh strawberry cheesecake is more expensive than the original. Also, the cake don't look anywhere near good, they don't look like they are done and perfectly frosted. This is not what I paid for and this is embarassing! I really love cheesecake factory and their food, but this is disappointing. I also called them to ask for a refund or something and they put me on hold for hours to get the manager. And they told me to send them picture to their email and the email is a fake and just bounce back. This is such a waste of my time and money. This is not what a $25 cake looks like and it should not be."
Roen R.,"Hayward, CA",44,123,25,3.0,8/3/2017,"This is just a place where you take your out of state/out of country relative/friend and want to give them a rooftop experience. Slow service, very busy restaurant. Food quality is okay. Cheesecakes are super super sweet. Expect a 30-45 minute wait for lunch and at least 1.5 hours for dinner. Would only come back here if I was showing someone around SF and I happen to be in Union Square."
Jackie A.,"Oakland, CA",29,19,65,2.0,12/13/2016,"First of all, I LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but my experience at THIS location was horrible. Came here less than two weeks ago. The only good part was that we got seated in less than two mins . Our server sucked . He had no type of personality or Anything. He was just there . Ordered a bottle of wine & it took him 30 mins to bring it. He said the bartender was backed up. It's a bottle, not a cocktail. Can't you just go grab it?  Anyways, my wine glass was dirty , and I didn't notice the big sticky stain on it, until after I poured my drink In it. I told him about it. And all he said was ""oh"" oh??? Don't you mean sorry? You brought me a dirty glass. anyways, I also got food poisoning . Horrible ."
Rebecca Rania H.,"San Francisco, CA",103,2,,3.0,8/20/2017,"The chefs are great, the food taste wonderful, but the servers make me lose my appetite."
Lynne P.,"Nob Hill, San Francisco, CA",0,52,2,1.0,8/14/2017,"Sad to leave this review for a place I normally love  but feel I must.  Summary of the service at the bar when anyone OTHER THAN BIANCA AND GABRIELLA are your servers is excellent.  If they are, expect them to totally ignore you while they chat to each other, give you the smallest pour on a glass of wine that you have EVER seen, never ask you if you meal is OK, eye rolling at a request to fill your water and just all around HORRIBLE service.  I am not alone in this review.  I have met several regular customers that refuse to even sit at the bar when they are working.  Complaints to management have done nothing.  And if you ever expect to hear a ""thank you"", don't hold your breath.  Very sad."
Dahlia Y.,"Pasadena, CA",271,218,1239,3.0,6/9/2015,"This is downtown SF, union square to be more specific. Everyone comes here for the view. I visited on a Saturday evening, it was crowded making it impossible to walk. But I just had to had those amazing Mac n cheese balls.  They told us there was an 1 hour wait but it only took 35 mins. The servers where nice attentive and friendly. The food took 20 mins. Don't go starving here or you might faint :-/. The food was warm and tasty. My table was outside and the most uncomfortable of sitting in an outside area on the 8th floor are the possibilities of a bird sitting on your plate, yes your plate. This  happened to the table across us, soon they had 2 birds on the table. While it was funny to watch I know it was very unpleasant for those guest.  The other great things about this location: -close to the ferry that takes you all the way down through down town. Pretty pricey.  - you get to go shopping. While you walk you burn all the calories you just ate.  If I visit SF I would definitely go back. Just remember bring lots and lots of patience."
Y H.,"San Mateo, CA",1,7,6,5.0,2/12/2017,Ashwini !! You make Cheesecake Factory visit soo special every time!! You have great menu suggestions from the second you see the customer and !! It's always right!! Such a bright spirit!!  Thank you!! ( :
Sonya T.,"Millbrae, CA",52,50,9,2.0,8/5/2017,We were seating outside and it took 3min for waiter to bring menu and 5min to ask for drinks and 35min to cone and ask for food!!! This is ridiculous they dont pay attention to cusomers sitting outside! Of course the food was delicious but never going back there. The service is very bad. We asked 3 different waiters to wait on us and that we are ready to order but no one cared to take our order
Adrienne B.,"San Mateo, CA",108,23,452,4.0,11/17/2016,"Everything on their menu is absolutely amazing.  My favorite dish here is the Thai Glazed Salmon.  It's probably the best salmon dish that I've ever ordered from any restaurant.  But, of course, given their name, I also LOVE their cheesecake.  I just had their Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake this past weekend.  I should warn you though: this place gets packed! And I can see why.  The ambiance is great, the food is great, the service is great too.  However, I had to deduct one star for no phone reservations.  You have to make you reservation there in person.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Just make sure you have a lot of time on your hands.  It's definitely worth the wait!"
Dawn R.,"Antioch, CA",1,12,1,2.0,6/7/2017,The worst service ever. They tell you 25 mins when the wait is an hour and there are empty seats. Would have given them one star but the cheesecake is good
Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",223,56,79,4.0,6/30/2016,"Looking for a solid chain restaurant near Union Square? Well fear not! The Cheesecake Factory is here! I know, I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory, nothing really to get all excited about. But my experience this time was actually very decent. The ambiance of the place is pretty neat. You have a nice marble floor, the craziest view of Union Square above Macy's, and if you don't want to eat outside (which we elected not to in order to avoid pesky pigeon poop) you can be seated at these cute little wooden booths.  Our waiter was very nice and caring. A kid at our party is allergic to eggs, thus we asked the waiter to separate the buns and the patties of the sliders that we ordered. He readily complied. What a chum. We ordered a Lunch Special Famous Factory Meat Loaf, Lunch Special Shepard's pie, Fried Calamari, Sweet Potato Fries, sliders, fried chicken. I personally had the lunch meat loaf as I had the Shepard's pie before. The waiter asked if we wanted bread, and I highly suggest that you don't miss out on it. They give you three bread sticks--two rye and one French bread with lots of butter packs. I'm a sucker for bread, and this bread wasn't bad. CALAMARI (~$16.50): Decent, they give you a decent amount for ~$16.50 along with two dips--cocktail sauce and garlic sauce. Good effort. SWEET POTATO FRIES (~$12.50): I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these were solid. LUNCH SPECIAL FAMOUS FACTORY MEAT LOAF (~$13.50): My main dish. They give you two SIZABLE slices topped with onions and sided with succotash and mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. The meatloaf was decent, but had a tad too much rosemary flavor it to. After consuming the calamari, sweet potato fries, and the bread, this was too much for me to finish and I took half of it home.  LUNCH SPECIAL SHEPARD'S PIE (~$13.50): My favorite of all the dishes I sampled--the ground beef topped with mash potatoes was a wonder to behold. I could eat something like that all day. Sure, it's a simple meal, but the amount was HUGE and it was very tasty.  FRIED CHICKEN (~$13.50): The fried chicken was OK, it wasn't all flour like the frozen Tyson chicken you get at the frozen section of the local supermarket, and the meat was surprisingly moist. :) TASTE: 4 stars--portions are good, food is surprisingly decent. SERVICE: 3 stars--they didn't refill our water. That's a boo boo. But the waiter took care of my demands. AMBIANCE: 5 stars--nice view and beautiful interior. PRICE: 4 stars--it's a solid price for a lot of food. TOTAL: 4 stars--I'd come here again. Bottom Line: THE FOOD IS SOLID. The ambiance is nice. I wanna bring my date here next time. Heck, I might just bring myself."
Jared C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,2,,1.0,4/7/2017,"To The Guest Services of Cheesecake Factory:  I left the comment on the website you mentioned one week ago but I haven't received any response from you.  Also, I called the restaurant manager, he said he would investigate and admitted you overcharged me $20. He said that he would call me back within 2 days, but it has been 4 days, I not only haven't received any call but also call him back couple times without any answer.  When the first time I asked about the overcharge, I was told that I paid $39 tip for that dinner. A total $123 dinner with slow and sloppy services???I still paid $19 tip!!!! You just illegally add $20 on the tip by yourself !!! I highly doubt the waitress falsified the tip.  NO RESPONSE FROM YOUR WEBSITE! NO RESPONSE FROM YOUR MANAGER! FALSIFY TIP IS HORRIBLE!"
Han Y.,"Somerville, MA",13,13,1,1.0,11/14/2016,"Horrendous service. The front desk staff literally shouted at me saying ""wait a sec"" when I wasn't sure what she was talking about under the loud restaurant noise. The view and location are great. But the cleaning staff really needs to keep up their table and seat sanitary conditions."
Danae L.,"Fremont, CA",360,430,79,3.0,5/24/2016,"I was hoping for a cocktail tonight but my bf didn't want to be at a bar so we agreed on Cheesecake Factory. We had to wait roughly 20-30 minutes for a table, not bad at all! I had a strawberry martinis while he had a Long Island. We shared the crispy crab cake that came in an order of 3. Not bad, really crispy! He opt for the habachi steak while I had steak Diane. Mine wasn't as juicy and the mashed potatoes were somewhat salty.  Received a cheesecake for my birthday, yay!"
Reno U.,"Mountain House, CA",220,204,820,2.0,6/10/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is on the top floor of the Macy's building in Union Square. I've gone here a few times when we go ice skating across the street and this place never ceases to keep me from laughing.  Mostly because there is always a loooong wait! Union Square is a tourist trap and we always get caught up in it every time we are there! We end up sitting or standing growing more impatient and then...here's the kicker...we always decide to leave!  We know Cheesecake Factory is quality, over-priced food that is always situated in high tourist areas. Why do we try to eat here only to end up on the bottom floor eating at the food court!  I cannot remember ever sitting down and eating here. Just waiting...and waiting...and waiting..."
Brian W.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,5,1,5.0,8/8/2017,There was a long line for regular seating but we were able to find a table in the bar area quickly. Service was quick and friendly. And good was outstanding. Great place for a break with food and a margarita.
Tatiana A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",46,1,,1.0,8/17/2017,"If it were up to me, i would give ZERO STARS! I'm a first time San Francisco traveler, and so after a long day of walking and climbing up hills we decided to go to Cheesecake to relax and eat some good food. First off, they sat us at this cruddy table. It was really dirty and super sticky. Also, they served us water in dirty cups. They were yellow and disgusting. Then our waitress was super rude. I went with my two friends, and we are all in university. We asked the waitress, Sierra H., if we could move tables and she gave us attitude saying we can't move because it was too late and put our orders in. We did not give her a hard time and we understood, so we just accepted it and made the best of it. By the end of the night we were leaving and we heard her talking crap about us saying, ""I just hate serving f***ing teenagers,"" directly implying to us. We had never given her any type of attitude, only asked if we could move tables and did not give her a hard time for anything. And I have worked in the food industry before, and never have I said such things in front of the customer, even if they did deserve it. So I would suggest not coming here unless you want terrible service."
