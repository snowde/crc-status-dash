Eric A.,"San Francisco, United States",327,240,20,4.0,16/10/2008,"Decently priced, sit down restaurant chain establishment. I've had better dinners, but paid 3 times as much to achieve them. It's a chain restaurant, what do you expect? The prices aren't that bad. The food is well prepared, and tastes good, and the outside balcony is heated. Dinner can not be topped if on a night when you can see the fog rolling into Union Square, under heated lamps, and enjoying a dinner with close people.  I'm not the hugest fan of the cheesecake, only because I only enjoy traditional New York stuff (and legit New York Cheesecake is THE BEST!!!).  The wait can be a major turn off, especially around dinner time, and the bar prices are well over priced, but hey your at a national chain restaurant in the city. what do you expect? Overall good times."
Bianca L.,"San Francisco, United States",336,248,5,1.0,18/8/2008,"Honestly, I don't understand the hype of Cheesecake Factory....there are soooo many better restaurants in San Francisco....that said, I get why tourists come here, it has a very nice view of Union Square.  The food is, well....blah...My biggest complaint however, is the ABSURD amount of time it takes to get seated at a table....I mean, really, 2 hours on a Tuesday??? Now granted I fought my way to the bar and drank myself complacent, but those were overly expensive drinks.... Expensive food,expensive drink.... totally not worth it"
Kristina A.,"San Francisco, United States",466,261,118,3.0,26/3/2007,"This place is decent - if you can stand the wait for a table. You should be able to at least get a drink at the bar, but most people there are eating since they didn't have to wait for a real table. So you can't get anything at this place without waiting. They give you a big flashy buzzer that at least lets you go down one level to the Macy's furniture section to sit and wait. The food is alright but not really worth the prices. The appetizers are more appropriately priced so I usually just end up getting a starter, a drink and a piece of cheesecake. Their drink menu and dessert menu are the only real reason to visit any Cheesecake factory. They have a good variety of mixed drinks, blended drinks, and coffee drinks with different alcohol variations to choose from. They have to have at least 20 kinds of cheesecake and they have other kinds of desserts, too. After a thorough sampling of the entire menu, I've decided the tiramisu cheesecake is the best. The BEST I tell you! It's tiramisu AND cheesecake together in one utterly heavenly slice with a mound of real whipped cream next to it. Since I'm usually too impatient for cheesecake and Irish coffee to wait for a table here, I usually just get a piece to go and take it over to the Gold Dust where they have $2.95 Irish Coffee during happy hour."
Kelly F.,"Stockton, United States",3,24,2,2.0,6/2/2009,"The service was fine.  Decor, all right.  Food, delicious. The menu is endless. I had the wonton stuffed with buffalo wings as an appetizer, the shrimp bistro and my boyfriend had the hibachi steak. All were scrumptious. But the wait or view is NOT worth it. We waited an hour in the small noisy space by the escalators then waited another 10 minutes after the called out names. Next time if I want some Cheesecake Factory, I'll go to Sac."
Carl Z.,"San Francisco, United States",5,264,16,2.0,6/3/2008,"Unbelieveable how you can go to heaven and get high without the use of drugs or monosodium glutamate. *3-26-08: HOWEVER... as much as I adore that special ingredient, cream cheese (the sole joy catcher for cheesecake), my extraverted side just cannot tolerate such crowds and costs that float far above this ""factory"" located on the 8th floor of an already overpriced apparel outlet (Macy's). Do to these coupled factors, I've plucked away 3 stars, so 2 stars to them."
Ju D.,"Bay Area, United States",6,199,89,4.0,12/10/2008,"This is the first time in a long time that i've been back to cheesecake factory.  why?  becuase the long lines always deter me away.   but tonight, I came here with my bf anyway. on a friday night, we got lucky with parking at the after 6pm time.  came upstairs to the restaurant about 6:30pm and put our name down quickly.  okie, that will be 25-40 mins wait.  alrite, so we did just that with our light-up buzzer pager.  as we waited, more people started come through, the line never got shorter.   when the red lights came up! yay, exactly 40 mins wait, as expected.  of course we waited a few more minutes by the pillar for our names to be called and get our seats.  we got a cute 2-person booth.  very quaint.  as soon as we sat, our waitress came by and introducted herself, along with a trainee staff beside her.  after a bit, we decided on our dish and ordered.  throughout the whole time, our servers were both very diligent and attentive.  they worked fast yet cortially. my bf had the kobe beef burger and i ordered the grilled skirt steak.  we also had the strawberry colada.  too sweet and not enough liquor.  =P   the entrees were delicious.  one suprising thing is that our orders came out so fast!  we were quite hungry from the long wait and were trying not to down too much bread.  but as soon as we finish our first piece of bread, our dishes were out hot and ready!  my first thought was it wasn't our order, but it is!!!    yes!!!    the kobe burger is huge & tall, probably a quarter pounder.  good size for my hungry guy.  cooked medium, as requested.  it tastes good in that its not very greasy, moist and tender.  burger had mushrooms but no sauce, but still tasted good (we added in ketchep for our preference).   the fries are excellent!  crisp but not oily!   and my grilled skirt steak, about 6 pieces.  grilled and topped with variaty of mushroom sauce (shitake, etc).  this is great too!  the beef is cooked very well (not tough at all!!!), and came with large portion of corn & veggie mix on the side, with mash as well.  good balance.    very filling and tasty.  needless to say, we both finished everything.  we tried, but coudn't save our stomachs for the cheesecake, so ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake ($6.95) to go.   we devoured it that evening with a hot mug of green tea.   the cheesecake is a must when you're here.  All the entrees are excellent at a decent price.  many range from mid $15 and up.  the burger was only $15 and the skirt steak is $20.  the cocktail about $10.   altogether, the bill came to be $55 (bill total).  not too bad for two hungry people!"
Angela N.,"Paris, France",108,291,7,1.0,9/11/2005,"Long wait.    The food is swathed in salt and butter.  I had salmon, veggies and mashed potatoes and for chrissake I could feel my arteries tightening up.    I do enjoy their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, but after dinner it just wasn't happening.  I sat with that cheesecake in front of me and could only wonder what was inside it.  Also, my waiter wore sunglasses indoors and swaggered around like a newborn Fonzi.  I don't know why that bothered me.  It just did."
Rebecca H.,"San Francisco, United States",222,482,,2.0,18/10/2007,"WHY DO ALL MY OUT OF TOWN RELATIVES WANT TO COME HERE?!? San Francisco is a town with a lot of great restaurants, and yet when my relatives visit, this is the first place they want to dine. It fills me with endless frustration. Sure there is a nice view and the portions are huge, but c'mon... there are a lot better places to eat.  Trying to be objective, this place has the standard Cheese Factory fare, with the overly large menu filled with ads. So three stars for that. I have to knock off a star, however, because of the long long long wait (sometimes it's more than 2 hours), no room at the bar when you are forced to wait, servers to frequently forget to place orders (I get that they have too many tables, but it sucks that it always happens to be my order that gets forgotten), and pushy rude customers. If you really must get your cheesecake fix from here, I suggest you grab a slice and go."
Austin N.,"San Francisco, United States",1120,132,45,4.0,6/9/2008,"Despite many bad reviews on Cheescake Factory, you need to try it yourself. There is a reason why the wait time can range from 5 minutes to 4 hours. Obviously, if you waited 4 hours, there is something good. I've been here around 15 times now, and almost everything is consistent. I say that because, my Miso Salmon was overcooked, undercooked, and perfectly cooked. The service has been consistent throughout all my visits.  When someone orders a burger, I always think.. ""Why come to cheesecake factory and have a burger."" Seriously, unless you're getting a kobe beef burger, otherwise Jack in the Box is down the street. Anyways, my current favorite dish that's a must try is the Chicken Madeira. It's absolutely delicious and flawless. If you want some steak, combine it with the Steak Diane for $20.  All in all, I love this place and it's a treat to always come here. The restaurant's atmosphere is very nice and pleasing. Good place to bring a date or even friends. It's a relaxed atmosphere with a hint of sophistication."
Melissa P.,"Manteca, United States",146,18,3,4.0,29/1/2011,Fan of the AMAZING food here and will always be back for more!! Been here a few times on day trips with my girlfriends and will usually have great service. Drinks are pricey but perfectly made. The shrimp scampi is AMAZING!!! Don't forget to get some cheesecake!!! Gets packed any day of the week and eating outside has an amazing view of Union Square. Oh and i LOVE staring at Tiffany's & Co. across the way!!!
Peter S.,"Saint Petersburg, United States",115,384,43,3.0,29/1/2011,What can I say - It's The Cheesecake Factory. This is basically on the roof of Macy's at Union Square - so cool location and nice views. Service was good. Good was consistant.
Bayarea K.,"Berkeley, United States",0,488,,3.0,13/3/2011,Crazy waits due to it's location. Tourist trap. Food is ok--typical chain quality. Convenient location. Hearty portions.
Hilary L.,"Berkeley, United States",315,43,6,4.0,17/12/2010,"This place is amazing, and also very dependent on your order, so my love for the place changes depending on what I get. Yesterday I went on a thursday night and it was jam packed, had to wait for over an hour, but once we got seated, there were freshly baked bread on the table ready for us, which is wonderful because we were starving. Then I ordered the crusted salmon with Diane steak, which was delicious, the Diane steak anyway, the salmon was okay. the steak had great flavor and nice chewy mushrooms which tasted great when you eat one after the other.  They also served great creamy red potatoes and were just amazing. The price was as expected, not too overloading and not cheap, my place came out to be 20$ but it was a very large portion which I took some of it to go. I also ordered the factory chopped salad witch was delicious-the mix of apples in there was definitely a plus. Then we ordered the towering cake which was comprised of sooo many layers, but it was moist with just the right amount of chocolate that wasnt too overindulging. I also ordered the cheesecake before, and definitely know why those things are famous, there is no way you could go to cheesecake factory without ordering what they're famous for. Its absolutely amazing, and im not such a big fan of sweets, but always have to get one of these whenever im there. So i ordered two meals, a salad, and a desert and the total came out to be 75$ which includes tip and tax, pretty pricy for two people, but somewhat expected. The atmosphere is great, dim lighting, clean place, on top of san francisco's macys, giving you a great view of the city, there's a Tiffany's co. right across, and making the view that much better. But there was also the christmas trees and things like that. Overall, this place is a must go for those who havent."
Dee C.,"San Francisco, United States",717,339,50,5.0,6/8/2007,"Talk about guilty pleasures... Not only guilty of indulging delicious delights, but most of all enjoying an ultimate no no... The chain foods of all chain foods... Yes, I am a giver and lover to mom and pop restaurants all throughout the city, but The Cheesecake Factory sucks me in every time.  The crowds, the noise, nor the tourists can keep me away from my hour wait (I recommend; shop while you wait) for an outdoor seating on a beautiful day, hey even on a cloudy mist Summer day.  Funny thing is, I don't come here for the cheesecake, but for the hearty lunches and atmosphere. Or maybe... for the energy to shop at union square! Actually yes, the shopping is the only reason I'd be in Union Square to begin with. Now that Bloomies is right around the corner I find myself at the cheesecake factory a little more often.  The food selection is abundant. The Salads are my favorite. And get this, they even have a weight management selection. In the meantime it is good to know, but I have not tried.  To be seated outside is ideal, but remember you are in San Francisco! The weather is unpredictable from one minute to the next and there are no overhangs outside, but there are heaters. The last time I was there, I had to take my sunglasses off because of the mist. But oh well, my time there was still pleasant.  The bar selection is also fabulous! And please my friends, remember this isn't strictly a tourist place. I have run into many friends shopping that all choose and are excited to go to the top of Macy's to grab a bite to eat and not only that, but have randomly run into friends in the restaurant. It is a mecca of locals indulging in their guilty pleasures. Most just dont admit to paying for over priced meals at this popular chain restaurant. GET A FRUITY GIRL DRINK... They are fun once in awhile! Cheers!"
John W.,"Daly City, United States",51,25,,5.0,25/1/2011,"This is my favorite place when I feel like American food. The portions are really worth it. I love their Shrimp pasta and the the combo dinner with choice of 2 with either shrimp, steak, chicken, salmon. My favorite cake is the red velvet cake. Hate the wait though."
Arnel B.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,62,2,4.0,16/12/2010,"Let me say first of all, I am not a food snob. While I LOVE discovering new restaurants and cafes, I am not going to avoid good food because it is made by a corporation. I have to say, I love the cheesecake factory. I don't think I have ever had bad food here. This location has an amazing view, and a staff that has always been courteous to me. The location is always extremely busy, so I am taking away one star for the long waits."
B C.,"Santa Barbara, United States",29,29,5,1.0,8/6/2008,"This is one of those places you go only when you have out of town visitors that just have to sit outside and eat overlooking Union Square.  Even then, I beg them not to. You have to wait for a table - FOREVER.  It's ridiculous the amount of people that go here. The food is absolutely not memorable at all.  I think I used to get some sort of salmon dish that was decent, but I'm really not trying to go back and could care less what I ordered on their 25 page menu. It's always crazy busy and the servers are running around in WHITE uniforms that are FILTHY.  Number one, WHO would choose a uniform that is so easily dirtied? and number two, WHY would they put this uniform in the busiest restaurant in Union Square on idiots that can't keep themselves clean? Bah! Horrible."
Dylan T.,"San Francisco, United States",222,88,8,3.0,27/3/2008,"In union square, you'd expect great restaurants around the place. Most of the restaurants are great, but cheesecake factory falls short of this repettoire.  Service: eh, the service kinda blows at the cheesecake factory in union square compared to the others around Cali. The waiters are always forgetting to check on their tables it seems(majority of the time i've gone), and mess up on orders a good amount ( seen it happen alot whle i'm there, although never has happened to me). Random waiters though come around to refill water, but thats one of the few good qualities they have. Even though the waiters are friendly and compensate for their mistakes, it doesn't make up for the loss time. Food: Their food tastes pretty good. They have a wide variety of tasty appetizers, entrees, and dessert. The calamari there tastes pretty good, as well as the bread. The pasta and pizza there also taste good, but in my opinion, they made a huge mistake ( which made me think less of them) by getting rid of the pesto pasta there, b/c it was so delicious and the best pasta dish there. To be honest though, the food there is overpriced a tad bit, but it seems to not stop people from going.  However, i'd still recommend Cheesecake factory after all their faults. Their food still tastes delicious, although overpriced, and the service is bearable, although not as good as some other Cheesecake factories."
Rene M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,35,,2.0,22/1/2008,So I still don't understand why people wait for over an hour just to eat at this restaurant.  The food is not that good; they just serve you mass quantities of it.  I guess people just like the location of the restaurant and the convenience of strolling through Macy's while they wait for their table.
Rhea P.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,2,,4.0,26/4/2009,"I love going to the cheesecake factory. It's great for big or small parties (get a reservation) or for just going out. It is not to fancy, but is delicious. I am not a tourist, but I love it here. Though there will be a wait for a table, it's worth it. Also, you can go shopping in Macy's while you wait. If you do not have a preference of outside or inside, the wait will be shorter. Sitting outside, though cold, is a lot of fun. The service is good, and the food is delicious. Do not order both an appetizer and a main course. Appetizers are the size of main courses anywhere else, and entrees are almost to much for two. But it is extremely good. My dad, who hates these kinds of places, loves the food. I recommend Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. All the pasta's are good. In terms of drinks, they have incredible smoothies, but getting water is good so you can save up for dessert.  Dessert is delicious, and the wide variety of cheesecakes is always lots of fun. I don't like cheesecakes, so I ordered the chocolate cake. It is so delicious!! My friends ordered cheesecake and liked it very much. Just like the dinners, the desserts are huge. Five people couldn't finish two pieces of cake!! The only negative thing about the cheesecake factory is the wait, and it is worth it."
