Taryn S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,29,,4.0,26/6/2011,"yuuuum!  definitely worth the wait (and it's a looong wait).  love their pastas and salads. everything is pretty good, just like every other cheesecake factory. I love this one because it's right in the middle of union square on top of macys.  the staff here are really sweet and friendly.  some nights are really crowded and stuffy. it gets a little hectic not knowing if your table is ready or whatnot. the elevator rides up and down are also a bit stuffy. standing in a tiny elevator with 20 strangers is never comfortable."
Kathleen N.,"Seattle, United States",116,229,76,4.0,27/8/2007,"The Good: Godiva cheesecake. It's the ONlY reason why I am giving this place four stars. The Bad: There is always a wait for a table here, no matter what time of day you come. The Ugly: The crowd is mainly tourists who have no clue where else to go eat in the city. My recommendation? If you must eat here, always leave room for cheesecake. Otherwise, eat somewhere else and get the cheesecake to go...."
Sean B.,"Alameda, United States",16,61,3,4.0,10/12/2010,"Great views of union square if you sit outside...huge menu...most entrees are huge, reasonably priced...and of course..the cheesecake...the other desserts are pretty good too...the brownie sundae and apple crisp..."
Keith A.,"San Francisco, United States",38,115,30,1.0,20/5/2007,"Growing up I thought going to Chuck E. Cheese was the greatest place on earth and figuring my taste buds were overpowered by all the video games I had no issue eating some crap ass pizza. Fast forward a few decades, my taste buds have developed and my desire to play a video game has gone the way of VHS tapes. Cheesecake Factory got half the idea right, they dumped the video games but they didn't up the quality of the food, instead they try to distract you with a pathetic attempt at making a cool environment that reminds me of the waiting area of Disneyland rides and just like those rides I'm expected to wait around for 60-90minutes for a fricken table, nope, can't call ahead to RSVP, that would be convenient and intelligent, instead they feel that making their patrons stand around with left over Olive Garden pagers they somehow improve the ambiance of this revisioned Planet Hollywood. I've been forced to go to the place a few times for the sake of entertaining some out of town friends but I also discovered this is the one place I can't handle going to twice in one week, heck, I don't think I can handle going to the place more than once every few months. I also learned that the more complicated your meal is, the bigger chance it's gonna be complete crap, even the Fish & Chips suck ass! How can you screw up fish & chips!?!?!?! After way to much trial and error I've decided to simply go with their club sandwich, luckily the only thing they really need to cook is the bacon and toasting of the bread, that seems to be right in the limits of their kitchen but then again, it runs me twice the price for something half the quality of Lee's Deli and I already pointed out, it's sure not the ambiance I'm paying for. I guess a place like this might be fun for the vacationing family but who wants to be mistaken for a tourist in their own hometown?"
Reed M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,8,,1.0,11/8/2007,"This place SUCKS!!! Why, oh why would you visit San Francisco, one of the culinary centers of the world and visit this crappy chain food restaurant?  I was dragged here by some out of towners who wanted to eat on top of union square. We waited an hour, they give you a pager to find you when they have your table, that is insane and so impersonal! Its crowded, packed with TRASHY TRASHY people, god knows which rock they climbed out from under, and their obnoxious children which they don't know how to control.  The staff seems incredible overwhelmed and overworked and I don't blame them! I wanted to walk around and give them all hugs to comfort them and let them know everything would be okay, it would all be over soon.  I'm glad I had two glasses of wine on am empty stomach before I sat down to dinner otherwise I might have been in tears too!  The food selection is just run of the mill chain store food, lots of fried stuff, I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp, it was ok but the pasta looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while (much like I had been for an hour!). I didn't have any cheesecake because I'm not a fan, but over all I would say to avoid this place like the plague. If you are coming from out of town PLEASE go try a local restaurant instead of this fabricated hell hole!"
Cellina B.,"San Francisco, United States",171,78,6,2.0,14/3/2008,"I've been here on numerous occassions and let me just say last night was probably the last time I go here for awhile. The wait takes forever!!! I've been here with a friend on a weeknight and it always takes a half hour to an hour just to be seated. Next thing you know you are seated, and next thing you know you are waiting for your drink, which takes forever. Don't expect your food for another half an hour.  If you do plan on venturing into this overrated animal/tourist carnivale then I would highly recommend that you opt for a table on the patio.  Why you ask? Well for one thing you get an amazing view of Union Square, and two it is much quieter than inside. There are heat lamps too. You can actually have a conversation rather than shout.  Also, if you decide to eat here then make sure you've had some drinks prior to arriving because the drinks are not that strong, plus you don't want to be around those god awful tourists in a sober state of mind.  Overpriced chain restaurant that attracts your idiotic Tourist.  Housewine costs $7.50 a glass and they barely even fill it. It's like hello I'm not wine tasting so fill er up. The portions are too big so I opted for an overpriced tomato and mozzarella salad. By the time the food came, I was barely even hungry and by then you don't even want to try the cheesecake.  The menu reads like a poorly written novel, not only that, but it is loaded with a bunch of crap, yes the food, and advertisements for Macy's. Terrible!  Cheesecake= overpriced garbage. They don't even make the cheesecake in the restaurant. Totally worthless.   The other thing that really chaps my hide is that the servers always remind me of a deer caught in the headlights. They just don't get it or they need some self-esteem classes because they are insecure and they just don't get it. You ask them a question and they kind of sit there with this dumb look on their face. So yeah, this is a good place to go when you have no clue about what is good in San Francisco. People who have no clue= TOURIST.  Why did I end up here that night? My girlfriends and I were having our weekly Spinster night. Being overly obnoxious, what better place for us to go than the Cheesecake Factory!"
Dave M.,"Spokane, United States",85,163,,4.0,15/2/2008,"Review number 100. Sweet. Where's my t-shirt? So, I was expecting to thoroughly hate this place, and wait 3 hours for a table while loathing myself for my planned ingestion of 6000 calories of overstuffed cheesecake food product... I was pleasantly surprised. I stacked the odds by making sure I came here with great company. We waited 4 minutes for our table, and once seated we had a great server. She pointed out a couple pretty good sounding appetizers, so we went with an appetizer and an entree to split since neither of us were very hungry. Soooo.... the avocado egg rolls... yeah... who knew that guacamole egg rolls would taste so good? Seriously, wow! We paired that with biscuits and chicken, which was equally good, although it was a little underseasoned. Surprisingly, there was enough left over to take home for lunch the next day. Talk about a lot of food! The service continued to be great during the meal, and our server was equally helpful when it came to that vaunted moment... the cheesecake selection. MMMmmmm. I've noticed something about the cheesecake, it's a little dense here. Ok, I lied... it's really dense. It's so dense, I saw a full cheesecake break a table. Scout's honor. The Chocolate mudslide cheesecake comes complete with chocolate oreos inside... which, while good... completely ruin the cheesecake. The oreos are grainy, where the cheesecake is smooth. Otherwise, it was good, but a tad too sweet. I'll have to try this place again, but it was pretty good. I dug it, I'll have to be sure to avoid the crowds though. ;)"
Panda A.,"San Francisco, United States",0,13,,1.0,9/5/2007,"I know, I know.. I live in San Francisco and should be eating elsewhere... The Good:  Delicious cheesecake.  The occasional good seat...booth or table near the window provides a nice view. Big portions - you get your money's worth. Clean bathrooms. The Bad: Being crammed into a hot stinky elevator with a bunch of hungry people and tourists just to get into the place. An hour + wait. Having to walk thru the bar area where you walk into a cloud of cheap skanky perfume and alcohol breath to get to your seat. The ugly: They seem to like to put a lot of garlic in the food.  If you are on a date and are expecting to get laid I suggest you skip the ranch dressing, skip anything with sauce, maybe just skip it all together.  You are going to end up with ""kitty breath"" and then it will be downhill from there. I ordered a chicken dish and found saran wrap layered beneath the breadcrumbs. When ordering the avocado eggrolls beware of the little avacado seed that gets thrown in - not fun if you are healing a broken tooth like me and then you chomp down on it. Having to finish off the meal with a few tums when you get home."
Melanie V.,"San Francisco, United States",87,238,7,3.0,15/8/2008,"My boyfriend took me here for our first date. When he told me where we were going I rolled my eyes (internally of course, I didn't want him to think I was an asshole, at least not right away) Normally, I would never want to go here. The food isn't that great, the wait is always terrible and it's really, really loud. But considering how things turned out, it was a good time. Since the wait was about an hour, we were able to go downstairs to look at Christmas decorations and relax on the couches. We actually had some time to have a nice conversation before heading back into the din.  It's not my favorite restaurant (they don't even make the cheesecakes on site!) but because of the memories here it gets an extra star."
Darlene Q.,"Temple City, United States",15,241,58,4.0,2/12/2010,"This is nice to be above Macy's. I can just go shopping after or before I eat. They serve a lot of food so I have to walk it off after I eat, so I go shopping."
I M.,"Oakland, United States",12,108,85,2.0,27/7/2008,"I have eaten here before.. probably twice. but it was a looooooong time ago.  A few months back, I was starving and really needed to eat something. and i was already in Macys, so I figured what the fuck? 45 minutes - 1 hour for a table? There? Christ. If I'm going to wait that long for food, it better be the BEST FOOD EVER (and someone else had better be paying for it). Walked out. Forgot where I ate instead. Not like it really matters."
Domini A.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, United States",519,89,14,2.0,2/2/2008,"I went to cheesecake factory for a drink and a little snack TWICE with the same ex. Great view terrible service.  No good snacks, really, in any decent time FILLED with people who i, in my elitist cloud of disdain for all bad footwear, really DIDN""T like and the bartender couldn't mix drinks for SHITE. Terrible service ? took forever, both at the table and at the bar. But the view is nice.  If you don't want to break in to a building and hack in to the roof ( like, if your parents are visiting or something) then maybe it's useful to drop a 20 or two, have a glass, a straw, and something unpalatable inside of it, and appreciate union sq. and it's entourage. Otherwise, please don't bother. THe dome at the westfield is free and you could technically pack your own almost anything in the correct receptacle."
Lisa W.,"San Francisco, United States",38,139,17,3.0,24/5/2008,"One of my favorite things to do is play ""tourist"" in my own city and The Cheesecake Factory really makes this happen.  Let's say that I've just walked my butt all up and down Union Square, in that ginormous mega-mall, and through both sides of Macy's and all I want to do is sit down and have something to eat.  So I do, right? No!  I go to the very tip-top of Macy's, put my name in, and wait for an hour and a half before I get to sit down and have an over-priced, mediocre meal!  Right on! It's weird, but I really like to do this once or twice a year... go figure.  For what it's worth, it IS a rather nice view if you get to sit outside and I've always had nice servers and hosts (which is totally bizarre considering how freakin' busy the place is!)"
Courtney S.,"San Anselmo, United States",203,275,50,3.0,9/12/2009,"By far one of the most overwhelming menus I've ever seen. I had drunchies and I couldn't decide if I wanted a burger, some seafood, just a salad, or what! But I suppose this is a good thing as far as variety goes. I wasn't displeased but certainly not wowed either. This was my first Cheesecake Factory experience and people had me under the impression that it would be like food porn with a taste bud orgasm. I ordered Buffalo wings, which were good but not the best I've had. It also felt like we had to wait forever for the check, despite being one of the few last patrons in the place. I'll come back and give it a few more tries, but it'd be nice to leave more impressed next time."
Leslie Ann R.,"San Francisco, United States",136,109,3,3.0,26/9/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory is why there is an obesity epidemic. I've eaten here many, many, many times and even when there is a TON of food left (and there always is), I never want to take it home.  In a city like San Francisco, it always surprises me just how packed this restaurant is...there are so  many others to choose from; it's not like when I grew up in the suburbs and whenever it was someone's birthday, this was the only game in town.   But three stars...for the blue cheese stuffed olives in the martini."
MB M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,27,20,3.0,3/4/2011,"ah. The Cheesecake Factory is super hit or miss. with their extensive menu, i guess it's kinda crazy to think that every single thing on their menu is gonna be super good. The quantity of their choices is pretty impressive, but that means quality is often compromised as a result. but i've been here plenty of times, and most have been pleasant experiences. The pasta da vinci dish is usually very satisfying, and the chicken avocado club is one of my faves.... the cheesecake is always super good, no matter which one you get...  Today, however, my experience was ...meh. i almost went for the chicken avocado club, ""pasta da vinci"" was at the tip of my tongue, but at the last minute, i decided to try the fish tacos. ....why the heck i did that, i don't know. dude... it was not satistying. sucks, cuz i really wanted to enjoy them! my ""tempura fried fish"" (more like reheated fish nuggets) were practically buried six feet deep in cilantro and lettuce or whatever. !! dude. NOT the business. and on top of that, i was only given ONE slice of lime. for FOUR tacos! tsk ....  my fresh banana cream cheesecake was awesome, but i was so over my food, that i wasn't even excited anymore. :("
Judy K.,"San Francisco, United States",159,276,118,3.0,9/4/2007,"Not worth the FRUSTRATION!  Other than the Tiramisu Cheesecake and the Chicken Cesar Salad, everything else is just mediocre.  We have been there at various hours and the wait has always been looooooong.  Then when you actually get to a table, the service is just lacking!  The rooftop dining is however, very cool...if you plan on a 3 hour lunch."
Gourmet Princessa L.,"San Francisco, United States",25,198,245,2.0,30/8/2010,"Ugh! Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in ages and doubt the food quality there has changed and I was right! Friends got my aunt and I GC to Cheesecake Factory for our birthdays so we went and spent them there. As usual, the one at Macy's Union Square is a zoo. The lines are eternally long, the place filled with tourists eager to eat something familiar instead of exploring SF flavors and the service is spotty. I don't ever remember a time I go there that it wasn't at least a 45 minutes wait time. Why don't they take reservation is beyond me?  We got there at 6PM thinking that we go for an early dinner and hopefully the line is shorter, boy we were wrong. We were told at the time we checked in that there was a 50 minutes wait. The reservationist gave us a buzzer and sent us to the bar so that we could drink ourselves silly with the expensive beer and wine prices. What she neglected to tell us was that the bar tables at the bar area are opened for grabs on a first come first serve basis. Great customer service huh? Had we know that the bar area serve a full menu and doesn't require wait time, we would have grab the 2 tables that became vacant. That was ridiculous! We waited for 30 minutes and went back to check on the status and that was when she told us that if we wanted to sit outside on the patio, we could have been seated sooner. Hello! Why didn't you say that at the time we checked in? Playing hard to get? Again, things like this pegged my dumb-people meter in one day. While we were waiting for our table, we observed an immoral and uncivilized incident. An older gentleman approached one of the bar tables where a couple (white male and Filipino female) were seated to ask if he could have 1 of their 2 extra empty chairs so that he could take it to the other side and sit down while he waits endlessly for his table. The couple told him NO and that they needed both of the chairs. The older gentleman left and asked the next table and got assisted this time by a nice lady. As we watched the 2 mean, uncivilized and immorally disrespectful couple at the table stuffing their ugly faces with food, they weren't expecting any guests to join them, but they had their jackets and purses on each of the chair. Shamed on them! We were so angry and so disgusted with these people's behavior. I hope you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself for treating an older, weaker person and you weren't even asked to do anything for him, but give him one of your 2 unused chairs. Yes, you, the fatty white boy who looked at your I-Phone the whole time you were stuffing fatty food into your mouth and your Filipino girlfriend who thinks she looks like Kim Kadashe wearing her low-cut top, but has nothing to show for. Shame on you! You deserved to eat at places like the Cheesecake Factory AKA an upscale Danny's!  Finally a table became available and we sat outside even though it was cold. We just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there. By now, it was an hour later, we were hungry, tired from all the standing and pissed that we had to wait because someone didn't do a good job. The food was typically fast food in my opinion. I had: Steak Diane with medallion of steaks. I asked for medium and it came out well done. So they overcooked my steak. At this point, I didn't even bother to send it back knowing that the second order will come back the same.  My dining companions had: Jambalaya Linguine - the linguine pasta was a little overcooked, but at least the jambalaya has good flavor and lots of huge shrimps.  Steak Collate with Onions Rings and Sweet Potatoes Fries - The steak was ok, not very good quality meat and the onion rings has too thick of batter and sweet potatoes fries were too salty.  The soup of the day was Creamy Chicken Soup with Artichokes and Bellpepper - mah! The soup can lukewarm, very starchy, not creamy and bland.  We split a piece of strawberry cheesecake and could barely finished that. The cheesecake wasn't very light or fluffy and the strawberries were covered in way too much syrup and too sweet and lost its natural strawberry flavors. At least our server is friendly, efficient and very professional. So we got good services and he was very intuitive about what we need before we even asked. Overall, not my favorite restaurant especially if I had to dine with the kind of low class patrons they have. No thanks. Please don't give me anymore gift certificate to the Cheesecake Factory. The first time is a torture, the second time would be a disaster."
Jer W.,"San Bruno, United States",81,279,,3.0,1/1/2010,"My friends made reservation on 12-31-09 before I arrived at this establishment at 6:55pm.  They waited 20 minutes before me and after we all ordered some drinks(the hefewezein is not bad).  The wait was like over an hour for me.  When we ordered our food, arrived like within 10 minutes, I had the garlic noodles with chicken while my friends had the fried catfish and  appetizers were ahi carpacio and the avacado rolls with exceptional sauces.  The food/service is good, but disliked the long wait (with no place to sit+other patrons were sitting on the non-active escalator steps), somewhat pricy,and only had one elevator functioning at that time versus two."
Shannon V.,"San Francisco, United States",92,402,,2.0,25/10/2006,"Some visiting Texan totally bogarted a bar seat instead of letting this lady (this lady, writing it) have it. i go home and cry when i realize that tourists specifically put this on the agenda when they're in town. some of them even press their pleats. the food is not horrible, actually, there are some menu things i cringingly really like (and of course the cheesecake heart attack is yum), but it is never, ever worth an hour plus wait."
