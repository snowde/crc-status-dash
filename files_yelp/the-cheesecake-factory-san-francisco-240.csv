Yan M.,"San Francisco, United States",224,1443,654,4.0,15/5/2007,"Back in those good old college days, driving to Chicago and going to Cheesecake Factory was a novelty. It was one of the best things ever discovered and we would literally drive two hours, head into downtown, have dinner at Cheesecake and party the night away. We would literally wait for an hour just to eat there. Somehow, after CF opened in Union Sq, we weren't that excited after all, the novelty had passed, been there, done that. Everyone thinks abt is the giant slice of cheesecake but they do have an extensive menu. Pages and pages of them and if I'm not mistaken, they put ads in between the menu featuring Macy's latest styles, gift ideas, etc....By the end of the menu, you would think you just read a novel and by then, everyone is confused as to what they would like to order/eat. Anyhow, I don't remember much from the menu except that I thought the Angel Hair pasta was decent and the one item that I frequented was the Luau Salad. So I decided to rekindle the salad spirit and had the salad to go recently. Had a 15 min wait, picked up the order and chow down at home. It's still good....for that itself, I would give the salad a 4 star and the view from the balcony overlooking Union Sq is another 4. Otherwise, CF concept, a 3 star. But regardless, the franchise is mushrooming everywhere and it's still drawing in the crowds and people still continue to wait for their tables....."
Gina H.,"Sunnyvale, United States",188,86,12,1.0,26/8/2010,I dont like this place. The worst Cheesecake Factory Ive ever been too. PERIOD. Service here is horrible.
Anne M.,"San Francisco, United States",338,109,8,4.0,1/2/2007,"Karla called me up 5 minutes before I was scheduled to leave work yesterday night and invited me to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory just because we both didn't want to go straight home after work.  I actually got out of work later than I expected and dreaded getting to the restaurant knowing that there would be a wait.  I was thinking that they would give us as a wait time of an hour - an hour and a half but when I got there Karla said it was only a 15- 30 minute wait.  Not bad for the Cheesecake Factory at its prime hour of dinner service. We sat outside on the patio though it was chilly.  Karla and I kept out jackets on because the heaters were just not enough to keep us warm. Anyhow, I have always enjoyed the food at this restaurant.  They have a large menu and I never know what to choose from!  I tried a burger from them for the first time last night and I must say that it was pretty decent.  One thing you MUST try if you like Macaroni and Cheese are the FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESEBALLS.  Delicious! Sounds super unhealthy, I know - but you don't go to the Cheesecake Factory to eat healthy -- seriously, don't kid yourselves. Overall experience it was a good dinner. One gripe about last nights service is that it took SO LONG for the appetizers to come out. But otherwise, service was decent."
Kathy T.,"San Francisco, United States",22,95,5,3.0,16/12/2007,"Even though it's a chain restaurant and it's always crowded, the food is good and the view is spectacular.  I took my brother-in-law to dinner here for his birthday and our server was excellent. She went above and beyond to make our stay great.  Granted not all services where good, since the waiter for the other tables, was never there and the patrons had to get up to find him to pay for their bills. The portions of the food and drinks are huge and you can't beat the desserts. The only thing I've got a beef with is the wait. Other than that, everything is wonderful and I would suggest to eat out on the patio especially during Christmas time. One star for the service. One star for the huge food portions. One star for the view."
? ?.,"San Francisco, United States",44,522,195,3.0,26/12/2007,"This place is always crowded and the quoted wait time is that plus another 30 minutes to an hour. Make sure when your pager goes off, you're in their face within 2 minutes or they give your reservation away. Staff is usually nice and helpful. Every time I go here, they wind up messing up my order. I never ask for any thing extra to be put in or taken out. I order it just the way it is on the menu. I get a completely different menu item, it's a HOT item but it arrives COLD, they put in extra stuff that's not supposed to be in there, etc.  It seems to be just MY luck. I once asked them to take it back to nuke it. They're very nice and offered to make me a new one. I declined knowing that they'd somehow mess up this new order. I insist they just warm it up. But they make me a new one totally disregarding my request. The new one they bring out is by far much smaller than the first one. You see why I insisted on them just nuking up the first one?  If only they would just listen to their customers. They have the same thing on their menu and they never have anything new. Their cheesecakes are to die for. Pricey but so yummy! It's gonna take a lot for me to eat here again."
Jael K.,"La Jolla, United States",0,5,,2.0,1/4/2012,"So I just went to this place with my boyfriend. They told us the wait was gonna be 35 to 40 minutes, but it turned out to be only 20. For a sunny Sunday afternoon, that was pretty good I would think.  We were seated on the outside patio, which is super nice and has a great view. The bf ordered fresh strawberry cheesecake - yummie. I had the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, which I usually get, and which was as good as ever. Unfortunately, that's all the positive things I can say about this place. Service was HORRIBLE. From what I've read on here, maybe it's because we're both students. Anyways, we were treated like two 13-year-olds who had no business being in this place. Only we're both in our twenties. Unlike everyone else, we did not get any complimentary bread and butter. Our waitress did not even bother to say ""there you go"" or ""you're welcome"" or ""enjoy"" anything the like. We had to repeatedly ask for refills - they never once just gave us one (in fact, I never even got a refill on my water; but even my bf, who paid for his coke, had to be really persistent). Then they brought us our check when we hadn't even finished half our cheesecakes, which I thought was pretty rude. And it's not like we were taking our sweet-ass time. It was more like they were trying to get rid of us asap. Meanwhile, everyone else around us was treated friendly. Nah, not going back there. If it weren't for the nice patio and the yummie cheesecake (which of course is the same as in every other CF), I'd have given 1 star."
Jimmy K.,"Seattle, United States",244,155,,4.0,5/4/2008,"Nice view of Union Square in SF and on the roof of Macy's. Good service and worth the wait.  They have the standard cheecake foods, I usually order the chicken madeira, avocado rolls, and chinese chicken salad.  They don't have a curb side pick at this location so you will have to go up the elevator if its togo."
Yohanna B.,"Novato, United States",93,139,,3.0,21/7/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is probably the equivalent of ABC or some other Chinese Cafe/Restaurant that has portuguese-baked chicken on the menu right next to the barbecue pork fried rice.  This is because the menu at CF is maybe at least a dozen pages long.  Some of their ""specialties"" include Baja Chicken Tacos, Teriyaki Chicken, and Chicken Piccata.  I counted 3 country of origins already and that's only the chicken section of the specialties.  Hmm...  I'm thinking Con-Fusion cuisine.  By the way, save your expectation for something else, these dishes will not be authentic in any way. Okay, I guess if you're going in a big group, it's a surefire because even the pickiest of the picky can find something he/she will not despise.  But if you're going in a big group, rest assured you will have to wait at least 1 hour.  Which means the crankiest of the cranky will be so upset that he/she will not enjoy the meal.   I do give props to them for the amount of food you get.  One portion of their entree can easily feed 2 people.  Easily.  Flavor-wise, meh.  It's okay.  It's just okay.  Service?  Definitely spotty.  As spotty as the white jeans that they require their servers to wear.  Case in point: last time I had dinner there, a food runner dropped the food off at our table while the server followed right behind.  As the runner walked away the server smiled ear to ear and asked, ""How's everything?""  To which I answered, ""Uh...  Not sure, because we haven't tried anything yet."" I would really rather go elsewhere, really.  But it's so consistently convenient that I always return.  Well, at least when someone suggests it, I wouldn't mind.  With all the options within the 1 block radius, I'd recommend something else in a heartbeat."
Truc N.,"San Jose, United States",334,200,45,4.0,24/11/2009,"I used to love going to eat here every time we go shopping in the City.  We don't go as much anymore because we're broke!  =D   I love the calamari here!  It's crispy and tender and the best part is the garlic tartare sauce!  Delish!  I also love the thai lettuce wraps!  It's so fresh, so good, so tasty!!  Their crispy taquitos are always a treat!  One of my other favorite appetizers is the sweet tamale cakes!  Soooo good!  I've never had anything like it anywhere else!  Whenever my boyfriend and I would go eat here, we would always order a bunch of stuff!  That's because everything sounds so good and I can never decide on just one thing to eat!  If you want to sample their goodies, get the factory sampler!!  All the good stuff is included in that sampler!  Yummy!!  I've tried a handful of their cheesecakes and I like the dulce de leches cheesecake and the tres leches cheesecake.  One of my favorite places to eat at!!!  They are always crazy busy here so there's bound to be a wait!  Be patient, go shopping, go outside check out union square, come back and your table should be ready!"
Vickie Y.,"San Francisco, United States",25,81,,3.0,18/7/2008,Not really sure what the big deal is..  of course when I have friends visiting from out of town I often take them here cause it's a central location right by Union Square.  Food is decent but not worth the looooooong wait.. Try to get a seat on the outside terrace where the view overlooks union square....
Dean M.,"Berkeley, United States",3,52,,1.0,26/1/2009,"Anyone giving this place more than 3 stars either works there, or is one of the many trying-to-hard-to-be-cool crowd that make this place unbareable. I already knew about the lonnnnngggg, lonnnnnnnnngggggg ass wait. But what they dont tell you is that during that long wait the noise that is constantly surrounding you will slowly drive you mad. This place is so noisy that I dropped a cherry bomb near the bar and someone said ""Bless you"". But seriously, its very noisey and very crowded.  A lot of rude people tend to gather here also, my daughter tripped and fell on the way up the escalator and a group of Asian stuck ups laughed at her, didnt even flinch towards helping her. Nice! The staff is ok. I will leave it at that.  The food? Meh. You can do better for cheaper. The location doesnt mean shit. Go to Morton's!"
Annie D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,4.0,18/3/2011,"I personally love the Cheesecake Factory, and I believe it's one of my favorite restaurants. I have loved every single food item I've tried.  The big question is choosing between sitting indoors or out on the patio. The patio has a lovely view of Union Square - which is very beautiful around Christmastime. The downfall is freezing, because if you're an SF native or are visiting SF, you should know that 90% of the time, SF will be cold. Esp. downtown. Sitting indoors is cool too; love the decorating. The only parts I don't like about the Cheesecake Factory are its prices along with its wait time. The longest I've waited for my name to be called is 1 hr. 35 min."
Martha T.,"Tracy, United States",0,3,,5.0,18/5/2013,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times, but never really cared for it. I would always avoid this place when in Union Square because it's always so busy with a long wait. However, a few weeks ago I finally went and I'm glad I did. We had to wait about 20 minutes, but it wasn't too bad because we stepped outside and enjoyed the view. The food was very yummy and the portions were huge! My mom and sister had some of my food and I had enough to take home for dinner the next day. It's worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a good place to eat."
stevewynn R.,"Washington, DC, United States",0,3,,5.0,23/6/2011,"As good as it gets in San Fran. If your looking for good food with a wide selection to please a big group or family and VERY flexible opening times for both lunch and dinner (as its non stop service) then this is your place. If you are also a fan of Cheesecakes, then perfect. The menu can be overwhelming. I personnaly love the factory nachos and wings. The burgers and sandwiches they have are perfect and pastas, chicken dishes very tasty. For dessert try the vanilla bean cheesecake if your a vanilla lover. its just amazing! Great service...only but is waiting time to get a table which can be over 20min on rush hour (between 7.30 and 9PM)"
Ryan P.,"Clearfield, United States",35,32,,1.0,29/10/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory as a chain is incredibly ordinary. I would put it in the same category as Chili's or TGI Fridays. The cheesecake is super good, but nothing on their 20-page menu aside from the cheesecake is anything special. I will never, ever, EVER visit this location again as long as I live. We showed up a couple weeks ago, a party of four, and were told the wait would be about 2 hours. We expected that, so we went and hung out in Macy's and Borders across Union Square for about 1 & 1/2 hours. When we got back to Cheesecake Factory, there was standing room only in the extremely loud lobby area. The bar was backed up as it was, so we didn't even bother with it. We were having a good time, and figured standing another half hour wouldn't be that big of a deal. Little did we know, we would not be seated for another hour and 45 minutes. By that time we were not having any fun. We were tired of standing and of the noise, and we were starving. So we finally got to our seats. We were not served any bread until after our entrees were served, even though we asked for it twice, no explanation. Our drinks were not refilled until we asked for refills, and the food took 45 minutes to get to our table. On top of all that, there was no toilet paper in the bathroom. Being on the roof of Macy's above Union Square certainly has its appeal, but trust me, it is not worth it to eat here. It is an experience you can do without."
Carly W.,"San Francisco, United States",4,127,,4.0,20/1/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone! Yes, the line is usually ridiculously long, but I think that it is worth the wait. I would recommend going at off times.  For appetizers I recommend the avocado egg rolls if you like avocado and the sweet corn tamale cakes!! I would go back just for those two things. For dinner, I have tried the stuffed chicken tortillas, pasta carbonara, and the shepherds pie. I would recommend any of these three items. They give you huge portions too, so expect to take food home.  I am not normally a fan of cheesecake, but I have tried a couple different kinds at the Cheesecake Factory and have liked them all! Also, just a warning, they are very rich."
chloe b.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,5.0,13/5/2011,"starting with the front desk, i really felt welcome when stepping off of the overly crowded elevator. i can only imagine the amount of people that go through a day. the hour QUOTE TIME we were given seemed reasonable. if you're patient enough to wait it's nice because you can stroll around the area and come back when your table is ready. there have been a few occasions when we had to wait an extra couple minutes, but that's more than understandable. the server i had last week was very attentive and made sure everything was taken care of. she refilled the bread for us after my friend would devour it every ten minutes. i couldn't decide upon what i wanted at first (i mean the menu is literally a book), however she helped me sift through, finally deciding on the chicken madera. it turned out to be perfect, exactly what i had hoped for. after my friend and i finished we certainly didn't have any space left when offered cheesecake. it may not always be perfect, but the five stars is for how welcoming the staff was. this place is always worth coming to."
Spanky M.,"San Francisco, United States",1,389,10,2.0,24/10/2008,"Ask yourself.. Is Elephant Bar the best place ever? Is PF Changs the best chinese food you have ever eaten? Does the thought of a Starbucks double latte, half calf, iced mocha frappacino get you wet? If you answered yes to any of these then you will LOVE Cheese Cake factory.  Another designed for suburbia, put in the city for suburbanites travesty of taste.   Was the meal worth its wait in pennies?  Bluntly, Yes.  Large portions that probably get better the next day.  Thus while the initial presentation may be crap, it may make up for it the next day.   Taste?  Well I had the Ahi tuna and it was good, very good but that was in Portland.  I had the Albacore here and while the albacore was above Can grade the white rice and asianesque bed of vegetables was well lacking in style and creativity.  Which brings me to why thisplace only gets 2 stars. Having a target group of 20-50 suburbanite  somethings with little taste beyond Applebee's it can not get any crazier than adjectives in the english language will allow it to be.  It must appease palates that prefer Outback steaks and Chili's as Week night out meals and Cheesecake factory as the special occasion meal.  That being said it is not for the indiscriminate palate that requires more imagination and pizzaz in its dishes.  Service...Slow... this is why the wait is 1hr.  Because while i tried to push the server along so he could turn his table and get another seating and more tips, he decided to dilly dally and take forever to do anything.  And because the service is slow people figure they can camp out for an extra half hour after they eat holding up the line of people anxsiously awaiting to put their cankles to rest .  If the service is quick generally you will have less camper sbecause the tone has been set and your table turn overs will be faster.   Decoration...See questions above.  Cheesy!"
Melissa F.,"Hayward, United States",0,13,,2.0,21/6/2011,Came here on a Friday night for a birthday only me and my friend. We didn't get there until exactly 730 and they told us to wait for an hour and we did (at this point we are starving too) and we got called at exactly 8:30 and didn't eat until about 9:45.  They lose 3 stars from me because the wait is always LONG! Yet I still love their service they have really friendly people that work there.
Chrissy A.,"San Francisco, United States",14,83,,5.0,23/11/2009,"I love the Cheesecake factory! I am obsessed with their menu, and their bread and butter! Hugeass portions! I never get something I don't like when I am here!"
