Christopher J.,"Eureka, United States",59,12,3,4.0,28/11/2010,"I spent the day after Thanksgiving here, enjoying the tree-lighting ceremony in Union Square, and it was fantastic!!! We had a table on the patio of the restaurant, which is located on the 9th floor of the Macy's building on Union Square. The patio had a great view of the square, and the huge Christmas tree they had decorated for the holidays. We had a rather large group, and they were nice enough to give us two tables on the patio. First of all, this restaurant has a huge menu, probably twenty pages, the first three just drinks! I could eat there many times in my life and have something different every time! To drink, I had a Ritz Martini, which is Courvoisier cognac, champagne, orange juice, and Cointreau. It was perfectly proportioned, not too strong, but tart and sweet, delectable! We also ordered a bottle of 2009 (which is admittedly a young bottle) Colores Del Sol Malbec, a delicious Argentinian red. For its age, this was a very well-executed wine, very expressive and rich.  We started out with some appetizers, a delicious raw ahi roll, flash-fried tempura style and served with fresh green onion slivers on top. Absolutely delicious when dipped into the sweet sesame dip that it came with! For an entree, we shared the Chicken Stuffed tortillas, which technically was a quesadilla, but so much better. The perfect amount of cheese, didn't overpower the chicken at all, with a tasty jalepeno/cilantro garnish, and black beans and a corn polenta on the side. Though the restaurant was incredibly crowded due to the event going on in the square, our waitress gave us incredible service. She even brought out a more adept waitress to open our bottle for us, as she was worried about messing it up (ha ha ha.)  I was very impressed with her friendly professionalism, and fine service despite the massive crowd of people in the dining room.  Definitely will go back, may even make that exact spot a post-Thanksgiving tradition! I'd recommend to anyone who asked."
Jayna B.,"San Francisco, United States",1,13,,4.0,10/1/2009,"I can't complain. BF and I received a gift certificate from my parents so we went down there today to use it up. Yes... the wait is horrible but we knew it would be so that wasn't a problem.  It was maybe my 4th time at this location, 7th dining at this chain.  If you aren't prepared to wait, go to another restaurant and save yourself the frustration. I ordered the soup, salad and 1/2 sandwich combo for $10.  I got a bowl of soup, lots of green and an entire sandwich.  Apparently there was a mistake so they gave me a whole.  I immediately set aside 1/2 of my sandwich as the plate in front of me could easily feed 2 people.  My BF and I enjoyed our food --  I expected my soup to be like a canned version but it was quite tasty.  I wish they still had the veggie burger on the menu as it was very good.  There was probably tons of fat in it but it was yummy and part of the reason I go back is that I hope it'll reappear. One complaint is that they could have been a little more generous with their pour on the wine.  Portion sizes are so large on everything else I wonder why they needed to skimp on my glass of not fancy white wine.   Oh and I wish they'd tone down the decor.   Keep the sphinx murals in Vegas."
Andrew K.,"San Francisco, United States",2028,4644,,4.0,15/11/2005,"I am sorry if it is commercial and the wait is long, but this place is good. I mean there is too much food sure - but hello people - share! they are awesome with substitutions and sharing. they subbed salad for fries and gave me a helluva salad. they have some of the best views around and their food is quite delicious; especially the meatloaf."
Jeremy R.,"Salinas, United States",119,82,,1.0,10/2/2012,"I reluctantly visited this place with my family over the holidays and I am afraid to say that my reluctance was warranted. First of all the wait is horrible, and we were a party of 9 so it was even worse. We offered to break up our party, but still waited over an hour to be seated. When we were finally seated the hostess tried to squeeze 6 adults in an area clearly designated for less people. It wasn't till a manager was summoned that the seating situation was rectified. My wife and I ordered the avocado rolls to start and those were fresh and quite tasty, so I began to feel a bit encouraged by this and thought we might have an enjoyable experience after all. I proceeded to order the blackened chicken sandwich, my wife ordered the shrimp fettuccine. When my sandwich arrived it was dry and tough, as if it had been microwaved and served quickly. My wife's dish was adequate, but nothing to write home about. My kids went with the safe bet and ordered burgers, which actually turned out ok. We then ordered desert and this was in fact the highlight of the whole experience as they did serve a great cheesecake. As it was I truly was not having a memorable experience, when one of the servers snapped at my daughter for asking him where the bathroom was. At that point I decided to speak to a manager, who did apologize and take 10% off my bill, but it did little to sway my opinion of this place. Overall less than mediocre food, way overpriced, and horrible service makes for a terrible review. I do not reccomended this location and will not be back anytime soon."
Ray R.,"Newark, United States",41,163,7,5.0,7/4/2008,"Like babies- seen one, you've seen em all. So blah blah blah about the restaurant and its food. This review is for the service. I had the pleasure of being helped by the by the amazing SOPHIA, my bartender who quickly became my waitress. Not only is she totally cute, with her shades of gold eye-shadow but the girl can make an AMAZING MOJITO! Dare I say even better than moms. OMG.  She kept up with the conversation between my friend and I as if we have been hangin out since high school. And made sure we were very well taken care of. Need less to say, I didn't want to leave."
Alicia J.,"Boulder, United States",57,260,,1.0,19/6/2007,"I should know not to eat at chain restaurants in the city, given that there are so many wonderful and unique places. The Cheesecake Factory was calling my name for some unknown reason. The weather was great, they had a roof deck close to work, and I occasionally dream of their avocado egg roles and delicious cheesecake.  So, I signed up for the WORST dining experience to date in San Francisco. We were never offered silverware or napkins even after our appetizer came and had to ask for them. We did not get a single water refill and worst of all the waitress spilled wine all over me and my dining partner with no apology. I repeat...no apology. The manager came over to offer no good suggestion on how to take care of the problem except to comp the spilled wine.  I kept my cool, though my outfit was ruined and my purse filled with wine, which I know regret.  I will never again satisfy my cheesecake craving at this lame restaurant."
Grace M.,"Boston, United States",695,810,204,3.0,9/2/2006,Food is great... but the wait time is ridiculously long!   RIDICULOUSLY LONG WAITS ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS! It's almost not even worth staying for the food. The Jamaican Jerk chicken dish is really fantastic. Don't get the pizzas The avocado rolls are always great ***Dulce de leche cheesecake ***fresh strawberry cheesecake
Tony L.,"San Jose, United States",605,239,,2.0,22/6/2008,"Wait two hours to eat overpriced mediocre food? No thanks. Yes, the view is great from the balcony. Yes, the desserts are fabulous. But as far as coming here for dinner - no freakin way."
Gabriel D.,"San Francisco, United States",255,259,,4.0,10/3/2007,"Yes, this is the cheesecake factory.  There is no denying that.  And there are 2 hour lines sometimes.  But it is absolutely awesome to sit out on the patio here.  I am a jaded view snob after living in San Francisco for nearly a decade and this place passed the test.   If you happen to be in Union Square and you happen to want lunch, this is actually a good choice.  I know I'm engaging in 'restaurant relativism'.  Maybe the Taliban will come after me because of it.  I will take that chance."
Joe V.,"San Francisco, United States",61,104,7,4.0,6/9/2007,"Chain store indeed, but I truly like the place.  The waiting can be really long at times (sometimes taking as long as 1 hour esp. if you go there during the holidays).  However, there food is good, not great, but good enough to eat and bring home if you can't finish it.   What gets me the most is the service, the cleanliness of the bathrooms, the tv's to keep up with your fantasy sports (sorry ladies), and the location.  If you get a window seat, you're looking at Union Square right across the seat.  It can be pretty fun if there are events going on such as free jazz concerts hosted by KKSF or during Xmas."
Lester A.,"El Dorado Hills, United States",114,345,4,3.0,2/1/2008,"I've always liked Cheesecake factory, but the one here I'd rather avoid.  This place is always busy and the service is usually suspect.  Like they just want to hurry and get you out of there as fast as possible.  The wait is forever and there's no where to wait.  They have the smallest bar in SF and the lobby is full of people waiting to use the elevator.  I saw a couple eating main courses at the bar, straight guys ordering pink drinks in martini glasses, people sharing bar stools.  Horrible.  But the food at Cheesecake Factory is really good for the most part and the cheesecakes are some of the best around.  Eat at anyone but this one.  Unless you want a nice view from outside but be prepared to wait."
Amanda W.,"Naples, United States",724,123,25,4.0,28/12/2009,"food good. wait long time for table. drinks good at bar. BUT  after a day of tire kicking in the best shops in town,  reward yourself with a view that cant be topped in the infamous city of S.F. and a drink to quench the thirst of a weary shopper  Priceless."
Amy L.,"San Francisco, United States",135,651,469,2.0,6/3/2006,"The good: it has a menu that will suit just about everyone and it has some really great cheesecake---and I generally hate cheesecake.  The bad: this location is super busy.  Expect 2 hour waits, unattentive waitstaff, and a very hurried atmosphere.  There are now enough other Cheesecake Factories around the Bay Area you have others to choose from.  Times visited: 5+"
Jennifer D.,"Tracy, United States",46,209,4,2.0,11/4/2007,"So dissapointed in this place.  First, the wait was stupidly long (and we went on a tuesday night for cryin out loud!), we were given the vibrating beeper and told it would be between 30 and 50 minutes.  When at long last the beeper buzzed we were then funneled to another wait area where we stood around for another twenty minutes waiting for our names to be called to be seated.  The seating was croweded and we ended up next to some jerks who aside from being painfully loud and obnoxious, also chimed in on our conversation (I was there with a friend visiting from out of state, so we hardly got to play much catch up with all the noise and distraction).   Our server was great, very kind, kept up with refills and keep us informed of the status of our order, but our order ""got lost"" so we had to wait even longer for food that was really not worth the drama.   On the upside, the mojitos were good."
Bernardo C.,"Oakland, United States",23,96,,2.0,7/4/2006,"I'm going to steal a portion of Shoe Pavilion motto and say,  ""If you eat the Cheesecake Factory, you pay too much!"" Sorry girlfriend, this is place is overrated and I think most of the people here agree with me.  I think you just like it love because you believe its ""hype&trendy.""  I think its ""lame &...lame.""  The food sucks and the drinks are are too expensive for its size.  Its a tourist trap sweetheart, and the place looks like a tourist trap.  Thats why its always crowded.  Its not the food but the look that makes the place.  I'd rather eat at the Olive Garden for the pasta we usual get. I have to give the Cheesecake factory an extra star though for their staple, ""cheesecake.""  The Tuxedo & Godiva cheesecake is really good"
emily p.,"Castro Valley, United States",13,80,1,3.0,8/7/2008,"go here if you & your friends cant decide what to eat, they got everything. you cant really go wrong But, if youre super hungry DONT eat here. the wait to get seated and to get your food is super long.  but the view from the patio is nice :)"
Michael P.,"San Francisco, United States",49,42,1,4.0,22/9/2008,"Worth what you'll spend?  Probably. Good service?  Better than average. Decent ambience?  If you don't mind tourists. Food/drinks tasty?  Scrumcious. Free refills on soda?  Yippers. Bonus points for?  Seating in the bar without a wait, if you can grab a table. The Cheesecake Factory appeals to the little kid in me that grew up in the suburbs with chain restaurants.  It's usually a zoo during peak business hours, and they are kind of militant about getting people seated all at once.  The process of getting a table is definitely not my favorite part about dining here.  What I do like is the varied menu, which means most anyone you bring can find something to eat.  It's not super cheap, but the portions are huge and two people can easily split an entree.  It's predictable, centrally located in Union Square, and always lively.  Come here if you want something familiar and you don't mind a 30-60+ minute wait."
TVAT T.,"San Francisco, United States",130,69,34,1.0,4/7/2010,"i became very ill after eating the kobe burger. down with the cheesecake factory. if you want something really good to eat, go to the Burger Bar, right below the Cheesecake Factory in Macy's. i'm just being honest."
Chrys U.,"Union City, United States",12,134,17,4.0,2/7/2008,"This is my favorite out of all the Cheesecake Factories I've been to (Valley Fair, Fashion Island, Irvine Spectrum etc). I guess I'm just a fan of big busy restaurants located on the top floor of gigantic department stores in the middle of the city =P. The food never disappoints....personal favorites include the chicken madeira, the seared tuna tataki salad, the breakfast dishes....and of course the cheesecake (duh). Service was attentive and the atmosphere just like any other Cheesecake Factory...except maybe nicer?  One star off though because of the LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGG wait (although I guess that's not really their fault but whatever)....and the bitchy hostess at the front counter =X."
