Diane M.,"Pacifica, United States",7,11,1,3.0,30/7/2007,"My husband and I ate here for the first time on Saturday. I read some of the reviews on yelp before going and had an idea what to expect. Here's a rundown of our experience: Crowded Noisy 35-45 minute wait (come back and pick up a pager in 15 mins.) Bar area very crowded  Good people watching Service was average (had to remind the waitress to bring our drinks) Lots of yummy sounding choices on the menu Tex Mex Egg rolls were yummy, except for the hair Good size portions French fries are fresh cut potatoes. Very good. Hubby had a club sandwich which is hard to mess up. I had a chicken salad sandwich with Cesar salad & a bowl of       chicken chowder soup. All was very tasty. Prices were fair (free for us; we had a gift card! Yay!) Decor was interesting (would like to have seen the lighting at night) Surprised to see 2 men smoking on the terrace (not that      I object to smoking, just a bit surprising being in an eating      establishment) All in all, we had a good time. Would we go back? No. We prefer a quieter, less hectic restaurant."
K H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,23,,5.0,30/11/2010,"As its name ""hints"", this place is cheesecake heaven. If you're gluttonous about your cheesecake like I am, I recommend the cookie dough cheesecake. Everything I've gotten from here has been smeared in delicious sauces and they have the most divine portabella burger I've ever had. What's also great about dining here is dining outside on the top floor of Macy's, enjoying a glorious view of Union Square."
Jason C.,"San Diego, United States",28,17,1,4.0,6/9/2010,"It's Cheesecake Factory for god's sake.  There's a million things on the menu. If you can't find something you like, stay home and cook for yourself.  Because it's a chain, I'd automatically give it 3 stars, but this particular location gets an extra star for the fantastic outdoor deck overlooking Union Square."
Roberto M.,"San Francisco, United States",44,2,,1.0,15/7/2014,very disappointed commimg here for the first time i came brcause everyone said its a good place good service got here yes it was busy but when me and my friend sat down we order 2 mojitos and buffelo wings the waitress nicole g took our order took about 30 mim for the mojitos to come ou which was understandable and food took 45min understandable as well because i know it was busy but nicole g make me feel dissapointed with my visit never came once to see how we were doing or offer another drink or anything untill my friend waved his hamd she came and we told her that we thought she had forgot about amd her response was oh no you just have to wave your hand to get my attention since when do we have to wave to get a server and we seen her go to other tables and she seen us never came and we had to ask another waiter for our tab and the guy gave it to her and she gave it to us so fast and came even faster to collect the money horrible services so if you go there make sure you never and i mean never have nicole g as your waitress but the food was good and drink but waitress horrible bad experience going there!!!!!!!!
Ryan B.,"Plano, United States",270,152,15,5.0,18/6/2008,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory location by far for the view and ambiance. Every other CF's are either parked at the mall or some kind of shopping establishment. Of course with the location, there is a long wait, but it's not bad considering Macy's is just right there and you are free to wander around to kill time. If you plan to dine in the outdoor patio, please bring at least a sweater. SF summers are usually spoiled by the wind and or the fog that likes to creep up in the afternoon and evening hours. This particular night we went, it was both.  For the food, typical of CF, the portions are plenty and sometimes it's enough for 2 people to split. My good friend and I decided to get sandwiches. I had the grilled shrimp and bacon club which is pretty damn good. She had the grilled chicken and avocado club on rye bread. Both were fantastic. We both agreed the shredded lettuce was a bit too messy and it would have been better if they used larger slices instead. You can never come here and not have the cheesecake. Fresh strawberry is always a favorite. I guess it's not strawberry season yet. The strawberrys although big, red and juicy looking, were  a bit tart. Overall, this will now have to be my favorite CF of them all which explains the 5 rating."
Jenny Rose U.,"Elk Grove, United States",4,9,,3.0,12/10/2010,"Visited Cheesecake Factory after a long day of shopping. What surprised me was the balcony. Wow! Ofcourse I had to reserve seats out there. The long wait was to be expected. The downside is that this restaurant is really snug! Especially in the waiting area. There were no place to sit or stand. When we finally got seated, the waiter wasn't really attentive. He just took our order, another person delivered our food and we never saw our original waiter until the end when we got our check. We had to ask other waiters to refill our drinks for us. Otherwise, the food was mediocre.  I gave it a 3 star because of the poor attention from the waiter and there weren't many places to sit/stand while you wait for your table. Although, the balcony seat was the best! Overlooking the tall S.F. buildings. I Would definitely come back, hopefully get a much better waiter also."
Winnie L.,"San Francisco, United States",121,141,977,4.0,17/6/2008,"Yum, Cheesecake Factory.  I've been here about 5 times but I've never had their cheesecake.... The food here is delicious and like none other.  I love the bread they offer, especially the rye.  The pasta dishes can be oily though. The service was pretty good for all the times I've gone. The wait for dinner is way too long. (1.5-2hrs) I advise you to come here for lunch at 11. (2mins) The next time I go to Cheesecake Factory, I will make sure to get cheesecake!"
Laurice R.,"Torrance, United States",101,135,46,5.0,1/5/2008,"So my husband and I came to San Francisco for our first time and decide to check out the Cheesecake Factory for our 13 year anniversary dinner.  Of course we've been to our local Cheesecake Factory many times and have always loved it. We started off at the bar, because as always there was a wait.  I ordered the Well-Mannered Martini (kettle one vodka, olive juice, and hand stuffed blue cheese olives) YUM-O!  My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, also very tasty.  Edamame as a pre-dinner snack and we were set! This one was very nice, dare I say better than our local restaurant.  The ambiance was so romantic and we were seated with a perfect view of the city.  As the sun set and the lights of the city came on, it was the perfect setting for our ""date"". We both decided to order something off the menu that we'd never had before.  I got the Bang-Bang-Shrimp (it usually comes with chicken, but we don't eat meat; fish only on occasion) which was to-die-for delicious.  My husband ordered a stir-fry veggies with shrimp and noodles plate (i can't remember the name) and it was incredible.  We just shared because they were both SO good.  The portions are huge so of course we took the rest to-go and also order banana cream pie cheesecake for the hotel after-party, lol. Our waiter was attentive, not the best, but decent.  He took a break mid-way and was replaced with Miss No-Personality.  Later he returned to find us still there on round 3 of drinks. We were definitely satisfied and will definitely return next time we're in the city."
Matthew G.,"San Francisco, United States",1,18,,2.0,12/3/2013,"As much as I enjoy their desserts, I have always found their service to be subpar and lackluster. With its location in Union Square, it is almost always overcrowded as well (expect wait times of over an hour on weekend evenings). The time from ordering to actually receiving food is always a lot longer than it should be, and if you are hungry, you will start to become irritable by the time the food actually shows up. This is nice to visit if you are a tourist (and want a great view of union square), but you can do so much better as far as dining goes in SF."
G C.,"San Francisco, United States",11,8,8,3.0,5/10/2008,"I don't know why I keep coming back here!! This place is decent and almost never has anything new. I have tried many things here so here i go. Appetizers:  This place has really good appetizers. Top 3 would be Fried mac & cheese, fried calamari, and chicken wangs! Salads & Soup:   The ceasar salad is nothing special, the chop salad could of been better. The greens definitely could be more crispier. Soup sucks! I'm sure most of you had tasted something that has been sitting on a broiler all day. Entrees:   This place has decent entrees. My Favorite is the Jambalaya with rice. Pasta here  is inconsistent, sometimes there pasta noodles are hard. Any pasta with marinara sauce here I wouldn't recommend. The burgers & fries are good but wouldn't the kobe burger. Sandwiches are decent.  Overall good the first few times. But definitely gets old by your 3rd or 4th trip. Unless you go for your faves and order the norm. Another place worthy of checking out but nothing spectacular. Everytime I have been here I have waited at LEAST 20mins."
Nand D.,"Berkeley, United States",0,31,,4.0,7/1/2011,"Took two girls here on first dates, including my wife.  Food is always good, and portions are filling.  Only thing is the wait.  Expect 45+ minute waits, even at off peak times.  At least you can wander around Macy's with the pager.  They are very good at keeping their estimated wait time.  I almost never eat cheesecake here, because I'm usually full from the entrees and appetizers."
Elaine H.,"San Francisco, United States",241,979,112,3.0,5/4/2008,"I actually rate this place a 3.5, but rounded it up to 4 because they do have good cheesecake =) But the food is just ""alright"". I thought it was pretty good the first time I ate there, and did go back a few times afterwards because I was shopping in the area. However, its nothing to ""crave"" for, just a bunch of Italian food, some Asian food (americanized), some pizza, burgers, etc. The entree with shrimp and steak is pretty good though, and a couple of the spicy pastas. A must try is the AVOCADO ROLL - very good. But for the usual LONG wait that they have, I wouldn't go there unless I was shopping at Union Square (you can go a good distance with the little machine they give you that lights up when its your turn). P.S. they don't exactly take reservations, but if you have a big group, let them know ahead of time. They can somehow arrange things so you guys can get a long table (but someone would still have to go and line up around the time)."
Vee V.,"San Francisco, United States",2,20,6,2.0,12/11/2008,"Went here twice and still can't figure out why it is so popular.  The most recent time we went was a Monday night and we were told that they were out of bread yet other table waiters were serving bread. Confused, we asked another waiter, and he was able to find us a fresh batch of bread.  As our food was served (at different times) we could hear our waiter continue to tell other tables that there were no bread.  The food is average. The service needs alot more work. I just dont think the food or service is worth the usual 30 minutes wait..."
Kelsey E.,"San Francisco, United States",693,221,27,2.0,1/2/2008,"When my friends say they are going to Union Square and will find a place to eat dinner, I usually beg them to not go to the Cheesecake Factory. Yet for some reason they never take my advice and end up having the same meal and experience they had before every high school dance. You know the kind: easy for big groups, loud, standard party food, a menu 562 pages long to appeal to what everyone likes. I feel like I should be in a prom dress every time I go there. The first, most obvious downside is the wait. By the time you get seated, Jesus might actually be making the 2nd coming rounds. Don't think you can get around the wait, it is crowded at all times. The food is not worth the time it takes to get it, it's anything you can get at a TGIFridays, except it's served in a classier setting. I mean, it's not like I don't enjoy the appetizers (who doesn't like popcorn shrimp!), it's just that it's nothing special and there are so many more things around Union Square that are magically delicious.  The only reason I'd swing by this place is to get in line for a slice of cheesecake, which is dense, really sweet, and suuuuper rich, so if that's what you're looking for it will hit the spot. However, again the line for this is usually unbearable.  If you're in the Union Square area, try Scala's Bistro, Anjou, or Cafe Claude (which is just as inexpensive for most items as the Factory). Unless, that is, you're on your way to the prom, in which case the Cheesecake Factory would get my vote."
Moko R.,"San Francisco, United States",1,200,6,2.0,31/12/2010,What's up with tourists loving cheesecake factory? haha. glad i didn't have to wait in line with the gazillion people there.  i picked up my tiramisu cheesecake and left. yay!!!
Arissa C.,"Seattle, United States",572,467,201,4.0,8/1/2007,"Im suprised alot of people are disgruntled with this place- I mean everytime I come here- it reminds me of being in a restaurant in Las Vegas- montrous design of Egyptian papyrus complete with doric columns minus the ringing slot machines...Given the long wait- with beeper in tow- wander off to the bar for a drink and within 15 minutes- you'll be seated-- at least thats as much wait I've had since I've been going there... DIshes I love: THe Bang-Bang Chicken,Shrimp with Angel Hair, Shepherd's Pie and Chinese Chicken Salad...Also love the Vietnamese chicken wraps...things to skip on- the meatloaf and the jambalaya... Luv the Passion fruit Iced tea :-) Oh and dont forget the cheese cake to go-- upside down pineapple cheesecake is my fav :-)"
Tamar N.,"Astoria, United States",31,255,1,3.0,12/1/2007,"FAT AMERICA - shame on you. That said, three stars for their stellar take-out service."
kristi l.,"CA, United States",262,221,60,4.0,3/9/2007,"Fine; The service is usually bad, the wait is always 1.5+ hours long, blah blah blah... But there isn't enough time in the world that would keep my fat ass away from the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake when I'm craving it. Yummy chocolate top, creamy mouss-y middle, spongie chocolate cake crust: Oh. My. God - Janice style. With 300+ reviews prior to mine, everything that needs to be said has been said. Only one little warning: the Cheesecake Factory homeless guy that hangs around in the evenings is volatile. He throws Chinese poppers at your feet if you don't tip him for opening the door for you. Bastard. Whatever, I'm usually too drunk off chocolate to care. Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake you're my #2 dessert...after Roltee (:"
Christina B.,"San Francisco, United States",76,266,141,4.0,1/12/2006,"You never know how long you are really going to wait for a table. Esp. for dinner, but there seems to be a special place in my heart for here! I love the portions, drinks, and of course cheesecake. So if you don't always mind a wait and you have time to kill this is a place with great food and deserts!"
Jenn A.,"San Francisco, United States",79,194,,1.0,17/12/2007,"Me not so smart some times.   Saturday, Dec. 15th : 4:30 pm.  After several hours of dealing with the other fools who have Christmas shopping to do like me, my friend and I decide we need to eat.  She recommends Cheesecake Factory.  I agree, figuring it can't be that bad, it's early, right? 1hr 15min. wait.  AT 4:30?!?!?  OK, we'll shop at Macy's cool, no worries.  We got in line to put our name down and were told to come back 15 minutes later to get the pager.  We linger, bar crowded, no room for drinks, get back in line to pick up pager 15 minutes later.  Me not so smart some times. Kill time in Macy's (basically testing out the leather sofas in the home furnishing area with all the other fools who decided to wait). We get hungry and detour to the food court (see other review) for a snack; 1hr 15min later pager vibrates, we turn it in, and wait ANOTHER 25 minutes for a table.  Me not so smart some times. Apparently, because the Cheesecake Factory has a terrible system of alerting parties that their tables are ready, 1) we didn't hear our name called or 2) some a$$ holes stole our table.   I complain to the staff and we finally get seated.  The only good thing about my meal was the really strong Makers Mark and ginger ale served in a large glass and the nice young waiter with braces who handled all the pissed off customers (ie...me) in his section well.   WTF?!?!?  Waited 2 hours for the frickin' Cheesecake Factory?  Are you kidding me?  The Cheesecake Factory?  Me not so smart some times."
