Minh C.,"San Francisco, United States",267,2,,5.0,28/1/2016,Isaac our waiter is awesome. Food is always generous in portions. Went here for my bday. Love the cheesecake selection.
Malina B.,"Stockton, United States",6,48,57,5.0,23/1/2016,"Yea, this is a touristy place, but I absolutely loved it here! You get a beautiful view of San Fransisco, the waitress I had was very accommodating, and the menu has the hugest selection..it doesn't stop there. We ordered the factory nachos for an appetizer. Wow, I was impressed, not only because the tortilla chips were the homemade kind, but it was a huge portion! Enough for a family of 6 or 7. Then we got our entrees and I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which came with a side of pesto pasta. Man, this was delicious and the portion was huge. I really recommend you try it. It's a very succulent dish, that will not disappoint. For dessert we ordered the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake and it was by far the best cheesecake I've ever tasted! It's made with a layer of lady fingers so it's lighter then your average cheesecake, so you won't be sick after the first 2 bites. (I usually hate cheesecake because it's a bit too rich for my liking). Anyways, I think for how busy this place was , the chefs , and waiters worked as fast as they could to make us happy. I had a wonderful experience !"
Susan J.,"Turlock, United States",33,38,,5.0,17/1/2016,"While in San Francisco why would someone go to a chain restaurant?  I had a gift card I was carrying around for 2-years and made it my mission to use it today.    Our experience was awesome in part for the great couple we met at the bar while waiting for our table but  most of all the bartender Ashwini, she is AWESOME!  She suggested great cocktails and wonderful entrees and was over and above attentive even at our coffee stage of the dinner.   Ashwini is the type of employee that make a chain restaurant special!  She was getting offers to bartend at a private party from a patron!  Will go again and call before had if she's bartending"
Gabriel R.,"Pittsburg, United States",21,11,14,5.0,10/1/2016,"Love this place, amazing desserts and really good food!! Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake my favorite so far"
Sandy T.,"Irvine, United States",66,46,,5.0,17/12/2015,"Beautiful View of Union Square if you dine in the patio.  Amazing Service. Loved everything. Not much more to say! c(: We ordered the Fried Zucchini, avocado, and portobello mushroom/ chicken marsala, spaghetti and meatballs/ cosmo and long island. The appetizer was delicious, we especially loved the mushroom! It's a great time to go during the holiday season!"
Adamme K.,"San Francisco, United States",3,111,175,5.0,28/11/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always good, especially with such a ginormous menu, but the wait is atrocious. Especially in such a touristy area. A little hard to get to since it's above Macy's."
Nazanin R.,"Berkeley, United States",2,25,3,5.0,25/11/2015,Service and food are always on point here.  Love the strawberry lemonade and mushroom soup.
Devika B.,"San Francisco, United States",268,54,125,5.0,25/11/2015,"Everyone loves Cheesecake Factory, it's a classic and has yummy food and dessert. Somethings you'll want to know about this location.  -It's located in the Macy's on the top floor by Union Square hence the traffic here is crazy. Usually no matter when you go you'll be looking at a line to wait so be prepared. I would recommend calling ahead a day or two if you know you want to go here, but even then there is usually a wait time. I've waited before almost 90 minutes since I went on the weekend at dinner time.  -There are two methods to get up to Cheesecake, either you can take the elevator at the Union Square entrance of Macy's or you can take the escalator all the way to the top floor where it is located if Macy's is open. -If you don't feel like waiting, order to go. On one side of the factory they have a cheesecake section where you can order to go orders which is nice because if you don't feel like waiting 90 minutes to sit down and then 15-20 minutes to get your order you can eliminate one waiting time. I have gotten a to-go order in less than 30 minutes. If you do to-go, ask for bread... You won't regret it. This location is amazing, especially since you overlook Union Square so it's very pleasurable experience to go and enjoy good food with food views."
Sean S.,"Hawaii, United States",10,20,3,5.0,24/11/2015,"Sat night, we arrived at about 5pm & it was already crowded. It was about a 30 min wait but we lucked out & got a table at the bar within a few minutes. Had appetizers, draft beer (limited selection) & of course, cheesecake. The prices, serving size, taste & service were spot on. So, that's why people just keep packing in & are willing to wait over an hour for a table here!"
Xander W.,"San Lorenzo, United States",451,2,,5.0,15/11/2015,"Excellent and helpful server we got ""Thomas R."" Was not in a mood to smile but this guy definitely made me smile a lot. He made sure to keep a smile on my after I had told have not having a a good day especially due to long wait before seated. 10:30pm"
Krilevskaya B.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,6,,5.0,11/11/2015,"It's a really good place, if you want to eat tasty food. If you don't want to wait long in the queue it's best to reserve a table in advance. It is a bit expensive place, but it's located on Union square and you can take a table on the roof. The view is just amazing. It's worth it to dine there."
Josh L.,"Livermore, United States",51,22,,5.0,10/11/2015,"I don't know how anyone can give this a bad review at all.  The wait was long, but when we got seated outside we had the nice freakin' waiter I have ever had.  Not only that, but the food is top notch.  I ordered slider burger things.  You get four mini burgers (they aren't that mini) and those literally might have been the best burger I have ever had.  As far as I can remember.   And their barbeque chicken burger is something I might kill someone over.  And the cheese cake is awesome.  But that's a given I think."
Veronica F.,"Ontario, United States",0,30,6,5.0,4/11/2015,"If I could rate the bartender alone I would.  We went in for my boyfriends 25th bday and we decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, we quickly decided to stay at the bar because the bartender was super inviting.   Ashwini was THE BEST bartender We have ever encountered!!! She straight murdered the bar service industry!   She was on top of drinks, on top of her servers /backers and on top of food at the bar. I could never of hoped to have this type of service on my first ccf visit.  She not only made perfect personalized drinks for me and my boyfriend but for the busy whole bar. She did not stop there, she then ordered signature must tries for all of us and they were SO GOOD! The rating this store has is not up to par of the service we all received.  I will definitely be back, not only because of the awesome food and drinks but because of ashwinis killer service.   She went above and beyond what I could ever expect at a chain.  she made his birthday even more memorable by being herself(the greatest) .   At the end of our visit we had a plate full of food left and we  were going to leave it for trash, this beautiful hearted woman suggested we wrap it and take it to one of many hungry San Franciscans outside. I cannot express how much gratitude I have for people like this.   As a server myself, I can only strive to be as good as her.  We have not stopped talking about her since we've been home.  THANK YOU ASHWINI!!!! See you next month!!!  - Justin and roni"
Zuriko K.,"Hamburg, Germany",9,6,,5.0,24/10/2015,"Even though the location is extremely busy all the time, staff was really friendly. It was our first time there and I was with my wife and our 16 months old daughter with her baby stroller.  I'm gonna say that this location is kid-friendly for sure! We had tons of fun!"
Deborah T.,"Lyon, France",27,109,37,5.0,6/10/2015,"Best Cheesecake Factory ever with best view! I loved it and still do. Although everyone pretty much know the Cheesecake Factory I definitely recommend this one in particular, you will have a great time looking over union square! :-)"
Hannes M.,"Hamburg, Germany",98,604,4445,5.0,4/10/2015,"So we went here twice within 3 days. First time we had just some cheesecake to take away, second time we are there. So the first time we had a slice of Oreo-Cheesecake and one of salted caramel. Sooooo tasty! We took it outside and ate it in the park close-by! Guess what, they even add whip cream into the plastic container - as if the cake was not yet creamy enough! Second time we returned we actually ate there as well and it was awesome as well. As we came up the eighth floor of the Macy's store, it was so crowded. So we received a buzzer and had to wait like 30-40 minutes. So we spent the next time at the bar and had some cocktails. Those were so awesome and tasty. All about 11 bucks and got as all drunk as we hadn't eaten yet. So by the time we went to our table, we were all still being tipsy.  We ordered a garlic-cheese-bread as a starter and they serve warm bread and butter, too! It was all very yummy and the garlic-bread came with a Parmesan pesto and a tomato salsa! Great.  As my main course, I ordered a Ceaser salad with chicken. It was a big-ass salad with nicely grilled chicken breast. As dessert we had again a couple of slices of Cheesecake that we all shared as we were already pretty much stuffed and the cake is very rich. We had a slice of the pumpkin-pecan cheesecake and it was gorgeous, too. Overall, the prices are a bit elevated, but the quality and taste of the food is high! Go there, especially the cheesecake is extremely tasty!!!"
Richard J.,"Monterey, United States",54,99,62,5.0,20/9/2015,Great food for a chain place. Though the only reason this place gets 5 stars is our server Frances B...amazingly and genuinely friendly...attentive without being overbearing...sweet and fun. She is how I love servers to be...and they are a rarity. Oh...and she's damn cute too...but that has nothing to do with her skills.
Kaylie L.,"San Francisco, United States",15,9,4,5.0,14/9/2015,"Ahem! Love this place! The bacon cheeseburgers are so good! The patty is tender and juicy, the bacon is crispy and the cheese stretches out when you bite into it. The Hershey's chocolate cheesecake is yummy too! It's sweet, creamy and rich. I never like cheesecake but I would eat it if it was from Cheesecake Factory! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The service is amazing and the interior is really nice! I would recommend this place!"
Marlene C.,"Turlock, United States",7,14,,5.0,7/9/2015,"It was my 1st time eating here & I have to say that I loved it!  I had the chicken panna with broccoli & mashed potatoes it was so good, definitely going back there when I come back to San Francisco! Also had the salted caramel cheesecake which was very decadent but a perfect ending to the meal! Service was a little slow, but I guess it was because it was Labor Day holiday & the place was packed, but overall it was all very delicious!"
Natalie M.,"Antelope, United States",1,29,19,5.0,31/8/2015,"Really good service and excellent food! We sat outside and got the most gorgeous view! It was pretty packed but why wouldn't it if you get such an amazing view! Very clean and even though there was a lot of people, we still got our food in in a decent time! Defiantly will be back again! My husband and I enjoyed it! The outside got a little chilly but they turned on their heater things so it was perfect :)"
