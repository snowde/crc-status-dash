Jenn K.,"San Diego, United States",80,500,8,4.0,11/7/2008,"I really hate to rate chains (or eat at them generally), but I will this time to comment on the fact that when you have out-of-town guests, this is a great lunch spot if you sit outside.  You get a great city view, you can take your guests around Union Square afterward, and the food isn't so bad for lunch, if only a bit predictable.  The view though, that's worth it."
Nancy P.,"Petaluma, United States",163,275,1,4.0,11/7/2008,"i have to give four stars because i love the location, love the food and love the cheesecake! some things i'm no so thrilled about.. *no reservations. how shitty is it to drive 40 min to the city, only to wait 2 hours for seating. *i told our server multiple times, as well as the hostesses, that it was my friend's birthday. they  never came. *the bar is way too crowded, and the host area is horribly unorganized. perks! *great, yummy food! lemon salmon over garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus everytime! *the rye bread is to die for. they give you an assortment of different breads, but i ask for just-the-rye. *extremely large assortment of cheesecake. i personally enjoy the cookies & cream, banana, strawberry and chocolate mousse. *fun atmosphere, great seating outside overlooking union square. come for lunch.. late. or come for dinner early. they offer brunch, too. but i can't imagine what the wait is like for that."
Justin H.,"San Jose, United States",147,25,3,4.0,9/7/2008,"Great food and friendly service!  Came here one night for a friend's birthday and the wait was VERY long, but luckily they had a nice outdoor patio area with a view so the wait wasn't too bad.  I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories but I still haven't tried their cheesecakes yet.  Need to come back here someday when its not so packed so I can get a slice :P"
Michelle L.,"San Francisco, United States",160,31,24,4.0,8/7/2008,"This is how I like to end a day of shopping. There are some really good pluses about here. I think the inside is nice and roomy for restaurant attached to a department store. Then there is the view from the patio. It is pretty but I always find it too windy to sit outside.  The food is good. They have a good selection of American food. The portions are large and you can definitely share. Call me weird but I love their bread. I know its the most simple thing that they could offer but its warm and it taste sooooo good. I know that they are known for there cheesecake but I have always been too full to even attempt dessert.  Even after all the positive things, there is one thing I can't stand. The wait is absolutely horrible. I understand if you're in the area and want some good dinner but does everyone in the bay area all have to come out on the same night? I've been there right when they open so the wait is only like 5mins and I've been there when the wait is 2hours. Its a nice and cozy restaurant and I would love to go back."
derrick i.,"Vacaville, United States",268,141,5,4.0,3/7/2008,"first off, i just want to explain that this is a HIGH 4 starts. this place has never let me down. lets start with the environment.  it seems almost swanky in there, a top shelf kinda place.  you'd almost feel out of place in ragged street clothes amongst the twenty-somethings and up in their fancy date gear, it is that kind of environment; but fear not, there are those people here too... along with guys in their giants gear.  and touristy looking outfits.   and decked out pretentious high schoolers, the gangs all here folks, don't feel the need to impress anyone... but what kind of review would this be if i weren't going to talk about the main reason i came... the BAR.  good drinks.  kinda pricy tho, but i've receive many a buzz from this place... okay, the FOOD... is GOOD.  the quality of food is definitely worthy of the near-fancy atmosphere, and you get good sized portions too.  don't get me wrong tho, you're payin' for it because it's is not cheap, but i wouldn't say it was expensive either.  you're payin' for that quality, and it's COMPLETELY worth it.   my wife ordered a soup and half salad for like $9... it came on an oblong platter the size of a serving platter, and had a gigantic bowl i the middle.  and it was GOOOOOOOD.   i place a high recommendation on this place."
Chrys U.,"Union City, United States",12,134,17,4.0,2/7/2008,"This is my favorite out of all the Cheesecake Factories I've been to (Valley Fair, Fashion Island, Irvine Spectrum etc). I guess I'm just a fan of big busy restaurants located on the top floor of gigantic department stores in the middle of the city =P. The food never disappoints....personal favorites include the chicken madeira, the seared tuna tataki salad, the breakfast dishes....and of course the cheesecake (duh). Service was attentive and the atmosphere just like any other Cheesecake Factory...except maybe nicer?  One star off though because of the LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGG wait (although I guess that's not really their fault but whatever)....and the bitchy hostess at the front counter =X."
cindy L.,"San Francisco, United States",3,19,,4.0,1/7/2008,"Never Ever Failed Me. BUT, i do take off a star for certain things that i find to be a tad too pricey. like.........$6.95 for a slice of cheesecake!  sure its good stuff but still!   I ve never had a dish here I didnt love.  Luau Salad- MMMMMMMMMMM  Even my picky eater mom said it was good when i shared my leftovers.  (Portions match Price.)"
Winnie L.,"San Francisco, United States",121,141,977,4.0,17/6/2008,"Yum, Cheesecake Factory.  I've been here about 5 times but I've never had their cheesecake.... The food here is delicious and like none other.  I love the bread they offer, especially the rye.  The pasta dishes can be oily though. The service was pretty good for all the times I've gone. The wait for dinner is way too long. (1.5-2hrs) I advise you to come here for lunch at 11. (2mins) The next time I go to Cheesecake Factory, I will make sure to get cheesecake!"
coffeecake j.,"San Francisco, United States",95,258,21,4.0,16/6/2008,"GINORMOUS PORTIONS FOR SUPERHUMANS.pumperninkle bread  endlessness. vegeterian options.  decent substantial salads. cheesecake with peanut butter and cookie dough and coconut.   dont plan on going out or shopping after eating here. you will be very heavy and walking will feel weird when you stand up. like you are travelling through molassis.  dont sit outside, even if you think it will be warm enough. even though they have heat lamps. wait the extra 20-30 minutes for an indoor table. do go here with friends you havnt seen in18 years from highschool,  and bring your yearbook and go through every page and scrutinize everything and exist for a moment like you are in the mall in the town you grew up in."
Carolina H.,"San Rafael, United States",70,98,99,4.0,10/6/2008,"Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance is all I can say. My friends and I came to have dinner on a Sunday night and it was delicious. There wasn't much of a crowd and the views were spectacular!! The service was mediocre but when your with friends you tend to forget about that. Not a huge fan of Cheesecake but the girls said it was good!"
A C.,"San Francisco, United States",1,11,,4.0,31/5/2008,"the inside of this place is sick. at night though its dark as hell, no idea why. but the food is good, and u get obscene sized portions. people that rated this place keep whining about having to wait dumbass long for a table... which is true, but we dont have that problem since we know people that work there and the longest we've waited for a table was like 5 minutes. the cheesecake is top notch.. the caesar salad is so huge it looks like they use 2 heads of lettuce.. its a big ass bowl of salad that u can never finish. one of the best locations (macy's rooftop) overlooking union square. to avoid those long ass waits dont be a moron, and make reservations."
Jeff H.,"San Francisco, United States",78,297,9,4.0,29/5/2008,"Good luck trying to get a table here during lunch or dinner for that matter.  It's just a major tourist whore of a restaurant.  We came here for lunch and settled to eat at the bar.  I actually do like their food though, but the damn long ass waiting list.  You could always put your name on the list and take your honey downstairs to shop at Women Macy's."
jes s.,"Alameda, United States",0,13,,4.0,16/5/2008,"Wow what a huge menu! And I wanted to try it all! Went here on the suggestion of an ex-girlfriend and it was one of maybe 2 times in a 3 month span that she actually paid for our meal! Im tellin ya, this chick was cheap as a mofo! It wasnt until she admitted to me that she used to date a billionaire that I knew she was used to being treated to everything. What a sense of entitlement this chick had...you guys think gas prices are expensive, try dating this chick!   Anyways, enough about the golddigger, Cheesecake factory is really good, I had the caramel apple cheesecake or something like that and it was so friggin good! I also had the quesadilla on a different occasion and loved it. The wait can be 15-20 min on a Fri nite, but its worth it...prettty cool ambiance too and EXTREMELY attentive service.  The waitresses are fairly hot too, kinda young but there aint nothin wrong with that! hahaha More easily corruptible is my motto on that one! Anyways, go check out the cheesecake factory, great family type place....if thats what youre into"
Mary T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",38,652,89,4.0,16/5/2008,"One year, I celebrated my birthday about a dozen times, within a two-week period with various friends and family. And on my actual birthday, I met up with the bestest friends a girl could have at this place. It was easy, even though there were better places to go. I've been here a handful of times, and it has always been the same. Long wait, lots of food, lots of drinks...but all with great friends. So, my experiences make this particular place worthy of four stars. And service has been always been stellar! Tonight, to celebrate my birthday...we are going to BBQ! Whoo-hoo! Then, tomorrow, after my graduation/convocation, we're going to partay! I love joint bday/graduation celebrations! This is my second one. :)"
Tony G.,"Fremont, United States",40,15,,4.0,13/5/2008,"OK, so I have tunnel vision. I love the Cajun Chicken Littles with their honey mustard and the mountain of mashed potatoes and seared ear of corn so much that I would never so much as notice another sexy entree. And the aptly named Black-Out Cake? At long last, plausible deniability for dieters. I'm sure if they charged by the calorie, I'd be their favorite customer."
M C.,"Union City, United States",4,8,,4.0,11/5/2008,"Review Reliability/Frequency: I don't come here often, but each time the food is relatively the same quality. At least I can express my opinion if it is worth your money. Food/Selection: With a name like The Cheesecake Factory, one has to assume that the cheesecake is near-top quality. While it may not be the best thing in the world, the experience of tasting their cheesecake will still be worth it (granted you plan to have some).  The bread is free on them and not too shabby either. The times I've been there, the bread has been somewhat warm to give them their (adequate) texture of freshness.  Their menu consists of appetizers that lean towards the pricey side, but are usually great picks. An appetizer would be good to have with groups of four or five people.  Main entrees are usually of large enough portions with ranging prices of ~$15 to ~$25 so it isn't one of those expensive restaurants where you get a bite on a large plate. If you're one to have a small stomach, I would consider sharing your dish with another small stomach. Got an above-average-sized stomach like me? The portions are just right. The only thing I can really vouch for is the pasta, and to put it bluntly, it's ""not too bad"". Visual appeal is usually very good and well-made. Quality is definitely there, but nothing spectacular. To an inexperienced tongue, the taste and texture might be on the side of being too much. For some, the sauce may be too thick or doesn't have enough flavor, however at the same time is good enough to be said it's good. It shouldn't disappoint too much to either the inexperienced or experienced pasta-eater is what I'm saying. Service:  At the desk, they take your name and either have you wait by the side to have someone escort you to your seat or give you an electronic device to notify you of your available table. The waiters/waitresses are nice enough to come by to refill your water and ask if everything's all right. However, if you want to get ahold of your waiter/waitress, that may be slightly difficult, because they're rather busy tending to their tables.  Conclusion: It's definitely a good place to go to for a meal. And if the meal itself isn't good enough for your guest or yourself, there's the cheesecake to fall back on. Service is good, food isn't bad, and the interior lends into the dining experience a bit as well. Price also shouldn't be surprising for a well-known restaurant like this by Union Square, San Francisco. Tips: - Seating usually is not a problem during non-peak hours, because of the (heated) outdoor seating that's also available on the floor with a view.  - Good place for a date! Bottom-line: Food is good enough for a good time and to spend ~$20+ on."
Flora W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,100,1,4.0,11/5/2008,"It should be 3 stars but I just can't help it. Their cheesecake is sooo damn good.  I come here once in a while and their food is average but good for a franchise. The fire cracker salmon roll are pretty good. The buffalo wings are just too spicy for me. I can't really eat spice. Oh, I also like the popcorn shrimp. I've tried their sandwiches and I don't like any of them. They are just nasty. I usually stick with their pastas. I like the farfalle, spicy chipotle easy on the spice, and the louisiana chicken pasta. Their salmon is decent too I come here for their cheesecake of course. I love the oreo cheesecake and tiramisu! They are my favorite from the whole list. The chocolate godiva is pretty good too. They have a long list of all different kinds to choose from. I'm always satisfied with the cheesecake here! The cheesecake itself deserves 5 stars."
Eric L.,"Modesto, United States",0,20,1,4.0,7/5/2008,"The view during Christmas with a date is spectacular.  The perfect date environment if you want to eat outside.  My sister said she would die if someone took her here to eat, on a date.  That is all this restaurant is over the other cheesecake factories, a good date environment.  I had a pretty good meal, the food was plentiful and for an average 15 dollar a plate upper-class looking restaurant it was good.  I had the lemon chicken which defiantly did not leave me hungry, and the bread that they serve you in the beginning holds you over until you get your food from the starvation for having to wait 2 hours to get seated.  This is the average wait time for a Friday night here, I suggest coming on a week day which is about still 30-40 minutes.  The servers were overly nice, annoying at times, and my water got completely empty twice which is defiantly a negative.  Overall a good restaurant with good food, for a romantic place to bring a date overlooking the city."
Jenny W.,"San Francisco, United States",6,26,,4.0,4/5/2008,"Amazingly went here on a Friday during lunch and no wait. Unbelievable! Love the avocado eggrolls, chinese chicken salad, mango peach smoothie, and bang bang chicken and shrimp. For dessert, gotta have the Godiva Cheesecake."
terrific h.,"Foster City, United States",2,43,,4.0,2/5/2008,"I used to think US' cheesecake is just strong cheese and making you stomach feel packed.  But then the taste of cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory makes me changing my view.  it's just so delicious.  I've tried various, still, the best is the original cheese cake. Personal suggestion: buy a take-away, at 11pm-12am, watching TV with cheese cake as post-dinner dessert, magnificent!!!"
