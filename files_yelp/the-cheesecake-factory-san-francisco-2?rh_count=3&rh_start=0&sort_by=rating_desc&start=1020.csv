Levi B.,"Cook, United States",10,169,28,4.0,26/4/2008,"YES, I am review number 500!!! Oh god that cheesecake was good.  I got a slice of the chocolate tuxedo. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM­MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.  The left overs were almost as good as the first go 'round.   We stopped in without a reservation on a Saturday night so there was no possible way of getting a table.  That was fine, we got our delicious cheesecake and went else where to eat.  It looked like it would have been cool to sit out on the balcony though, and eat and look out over Union Sq."
Meatball J.,"San Francisco, United States",63,44,,4.0,25/4/2008,"How many times have I tried to get in this place for lunch (and, back to work on time)? yeah, a million. not gonna happen! SO BUSY!  sooo, finally after all these years I decide to have lunch there on a weekend. (when I am not in a hurry). And I was impressed. The service was friendly, and fast. I feel sorry for the servers who have to wear all white though. Everyone can see when you spill some sauce on yourself! well... we hope that it's sauce. It was a beautiful day on the patio. awesome view of Union Square! And... the food is pretty terrific yet it is in MONSTER portions. so i suggest sharing your lunch with someone special ; )wink"
Carson H.,"Atherton, United States",23,393,,4.0,23/4/2008,"I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory, but if you have out of town guests, snag a table outside on a sunny day and have some drinks . It has the best views of Union Square in the city."
Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, United States",1450,1057,137,4.0,14/4/2008,"3 stars for the actual dining experience. They are known for their CHEESECAKE (hint hint the CHEESECAKE FACTORY), not their salads, entrees, beef, chicken, what have you. The decor is loud and obnoxious. I've said that in other reviews, and I'll say it again. The waiters wear ALL. WHITE. Who the hell does that? Honestly. ALL. WHITE. That's like asking for it. Plus, you know they're gonna get sued one day if some girl who works her ass off there gets TSS from being paranoid she's going to get her period during work. (ewww...) Anyways, the other day when my friend was coming over to pick up my motorcycle (that fucker wouldn't start!!! ::cries acidic tears of unhappiness::), he told me he was at Cheesecake Factory and I asked him to grab me a slice of the most peanut buttery cheesecake they had. I was kind of belligerent when I ordered this, I don't know if that means anything... Well he brought me the most mothereffing wonderful slice of heaven this Earth has to offer. I stood there and stared at it for like, 5 minutes before throwing it in the fridge and saying to myself ""This...is...for later."" And it was. I ate half of it on Friday, another 1/4 on Saturday, and finished it up on Sunday. It was SO good, in fact, that I WILLINGLY delayed finishing it. Seriously? When does THAT ever happen!?!?  Averaged out, 4 stars. 3 stars for dining experience, 23987293847 stars for the motherfuckin cheesecake that tasted like a peanut butter lovers heaven."
Tania J.,"Toronto, Canada",2,25,,4.0,11/4/2008,"My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory was at this location.  It was absolutely packed!  Waited at the bar for awhile until we could get a table. The food was very good, quite a large menu to choose from. I had a pasta dish, the portion was gigantic, when I stopped eating, it looked like I had hardly made a dent in it! We got the Snickers cheesecake to go..it was a bit of a disappointment, but we ate it nevertheless. :-)"
Jackie M.,"San Francisco, United States",87,102,4,4.0,11/4/2008,"So I know it's probably not cool to like Cheesecake Factory but F it, I'm just gonna put it out there. I like CF despite it being a chain and the fact that at this particular location, you will have to wait anywhere from a half hour to an hour before you're seated. I especially like the SF CF because of its view of downtown. Recs for what you should order when you come here= thai lettuce wraps, navajo sandwich, CHICKEN MADERA, avocado egg rolls, southwestern cilantro salad, and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. When you come to Cheesecake, it's consistent. The bread is dank esp. when warm. The food is huge. The atmosphere is relaxed minus the crazy waiting area. So to all the haters....stop hating on the factory's  player status. Don't hate the player, hate the game. Cheese out!"
Jen P.,"San Francisco, United States",59,373,457,4.0,9/4/2008,Be prepared for a long wait! ... usually 1 - 2 hours on weekends or friday nights. But on Mon - Thurs. its usually 15 minutes. They offer big portions for a fair price. The crispy crab wontons for appetizers. Steak Diane for entree with a Lemoncello Cream Torte is the best meal here.
Jimmy K.,"Seattle, United States",244,155,,4.0,5/4/2008,"Nice view of Union Square in SF and on the roof of Macy's. Good service and worth the wait.  They have the standard cheecake foods, I usually order the chicken madeira, avocado rolls, and chinese chicken salad.  They don't have a curb side pick at this location so you will have to go up the elevator if its togo."
Ting R.,"Burlingame, United States",86,125,5,4.0,1/4/2008,"The food was actually quite good!  I DID NOT expect that from a franchised restaurant. We went there around 6pm on a Thursday, and the place was packed.  We waited about 30 mins.  We requested outside patio seats, which we regretted after sitting there, it was freezing cold on the top of Macy's building.  Anyways, we ordered chicken Masa and my friend ordered some kind of creamy pasta dish which i unfortunately forgot the name of it.  They were both very good. It looses one star because...well, my friend wanted to smoke after the meal but unsure if she could do it at the balcony, so we asked one waiter, he told me she had to go to desinated places, then I saw a woman sitting next table to us smoking, so i asked another waitress, she said yes you may smoke here, i was like wth?"
Teddy D.,"Flushing, United States",17,74,23,4.0,30/3/2008,"Dunno 'bout the food, but the view from the outdoor patio overlooking Union Square, i.e. Coach, Chanel, Gucci, Goyard, Saks, Barneys, Nieman Marcus, did I mention you are on the top floor of Macy's? makes it a must-see. Hit it after viewing the Macy's flower show (wherein I spotted one scene that had two Spanish matadors looking longingly at one another while a woman reaches out for one of the men in apparent despair at losing him to the arms of another man. Wait. . . tell me this wasn't all just my overactive imagination.) If you want a table - or even an elevator - be prepared to wait, as this place is always crowed."
Laura L.,"Campbell, United States",71,76,49,4.0,29/3/2008,"GREAT food! i got the pasta carbinara and it was excellent. plus the portions are so huge i only finished about half of it and took the rest home. we did have to wait for about an hour till we were seated, but it was worth the wait. plus the Macy's furniture section is right there so we just sat in the comfy couches until it was time. it is pretty expensive, but seeing as it was practically 2 meals, it was OK. the place was pretty packed as well but my overall experience here was good."
Wayne Q.,"Berkeley, United States",58,410,230,4.0,25/3/2008,"As much as I love the menu items at the Cheesecake Factory, coming to this Union Square location is just a nightmare waiting to happen.  If you can only make it there by car, forget it, as Union Square parking is a huge mess.  And if you have to put your name in in person and wait two hours for a table, at least try to get a seat on the patio if it's a nice day.  From there, you're sailing along, but it's simply too hard to justify the wait and the agony of wandering around to largely franchised stores in the area that you could visit, most likely, in your own little town. Still, much love for the Spicy Cashew Chicken, Avocado Egg Rolls, and Dulce de Leche and Snickers Bar cheesecakes, so I can't shovel too much disrespect!  Go to the Corte Madera location, you'll be happy you did."
Ashley F.,"Redwood City, United States",23,164,12,4.0,17/3/2008,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times before, but this was my first time in many years to the SF location. I went on a Sunday afternoon, there were tons of people. Our wait was 40 minutes, which at first made my heart sink because I was super hungry, but actually it wasn't that bad. I was able to scope out all of the food as the waiters passed by so it gave me some new ideas on food to try. Our waitress was super nice and funny. Her great service made up for the semi-long wait. I ate sooo much I felt sick afterwards, but the food (fried chicken breast sliders) and dessert ( strawberry shortcake- it was bomb, so delicious) were so good I didn't want to stop! If you're impatient, don't come here. And also if you're at all claustrophobic don't come either, the tables are very close together - one thing I don't like about the restaurant set up there because your almost bumping elbows and you don't really get much privacy."
XoXo X.,"San Francisco, United States",0,73,,4.0,14/3/2008,"I have never been to this restaurant here in SF cause I'm from LA.  My Xo told me that it was on the top floor.  I was amazed because it was inside Macy's where I can do a lil window shopping.  We both wanted some sweet fixation so he took me here.  We took the elevator & once we came in, it was soo crowded.  We just ordered 2 chocolate mousse cheesecake to go & took it downstairs to eat.  We both couldn't finish them so we were better off by just ordering one instead."
Chie J.,"San Francisco, United States",72,167,25,4.0,6/3/2008,"Ok.  I DO NOT like chain restaurant.  And I HATE cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.  So why 4 stars? They have a really good Kobe (they call it ""Kobe Burger"" on their menu but American Style Kobe Beef) burger!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  It was very thick and juicy.  Even the tomato tasted great for a restaurant this level.   I'll definitely go back for the burger after 10pm when there is no wait."
Drew T.,"Rocklin, United States",285,879,3018,4.0,2/3/2008,"Overpriced chain restaurant attracts yuppies from far and wide. as an aside, this location is perfect. if you sit outside, you can watch the ants in union square. mojitos are a dream here, but the veggie options are lacking."
Silly P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,31,1,4.0,27/2/2008,"Ok, I have always heard that the Cheesecake Factory has huge portions, a great view, and really crappy food.  My mother was in from out of town and I took her to get a makeover at Macy's.  While there we decided to eat at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  I've lived in SF for four years and avoided this place for it's ""bad food"" reputation - but I thought my meal was great.   My mother was happy with her meal as well (though, I must admit, she was so excited about her makeover, it would have taken a lot to kill her mood!)   I give them one less star because of the flatware issue!  When we arrived, they were so busy they didn't have any flatware to give us.  We didn't have food yet, so no biggie.  When they did bring forks, the lady next to us tapped me on the shoulder and said ""don't use that"" and turned over my fork.  It has a pretty big chunk of food on it (big enough for her to see it at the next table!)  The waiter was appropriately mortified and immediately brought us new forks.  I am sure they were literally pulling them from the dishwasher as it finished and bringing them out to us.  I know stuff like this happens sometimes, no matter what kind of place you are in, but it was a little gross!  Glad the lady next to me noticed!   Did I mention GREAT VIEW!"
Theresa B.,"Los Angeles, United States",114,187,25,4.0,25/2/2008,"""Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco??! Why?!?"" Yeah thats what i said when my bf suggested we have dinner here instead of the cute little wine bar next to our hotel! Booo and hiiissss i said!!  I wanted to spend our night in an intimate setting not a place where families with their loud children and teenagers all dressed up in their emo clothing hang out!  He got his way...our wait was 2 hours on a saturday night! This restaurant is located on the 8th floor of the Macys store and you have to take the elevator to the 7th and then go up the escalator in the furniture section to the 8th floor.  Food was okay, we had lettuce wraps...he had his tons of fun burger and i had my usual...the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes! it turned out to be a good night! we had drinks at the bar..had two rounds actually so by the time dinner rolled around...i was feeling pretty relaxed! Ooh...our dessert was delicious...we had the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake that was not on their menu! Yumm....ohmigosh i wanted to come back for seconds the next morning!"
deanne n.,"Broomfield, United States",4,17,3,4.0,19/2/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory where ever I go!  However, SF got the nice view of Union Square (especially worth seeing when there's an art gallery event going on), but 4 stars b/c the wait for a table is so much longer here than anywhere else I've been to.  :/"
Jamie W.,"San Francisco, United States",97,241,60,4.0,17/2/2008,"Big menu, big portions, free refills ... and I hear they serve cheesecake too. Ed U. warned me that the portions are on the humongous side, so I opted for a salad to share and negotiated a few pieces of Ed's meatloaf and potatoes.  The Chicken Tostada salad was pretty tasty ... I'd like to see more chicken in it for $12.95, but it was more than filling. On Ed's plate, I LOVED the garlic mash potatoes .. they were wonderful.  Smooth, creamy, yum-o! I can't imagine waiting more than 30-45 minutes for a table at the Cheesecake Factory ... but I guess some people do.  It was nice to try it out ... I'd recommend giving it a go at least once."
