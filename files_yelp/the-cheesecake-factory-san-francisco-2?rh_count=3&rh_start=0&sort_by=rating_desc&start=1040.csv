Dave M.,"Spokane, United States",85,163,,4.0,15/2/2008,"Review number 100. Sweet. Where's my t-shirt? So, I was expecting to thoroughly hate this place, and wait 3 hours for a table while loathing myself for my planned ingestion of 6000 calories of overstuffed cheesecake food product... I was pleasantly surprised. I stacked the odds by making sure I came here with great company. We waited 4 minutes for our table, and once seated we had a great server. She pointed out a couple pretty good sounding appetizers, so we went with an appetizer and an entree to split since neither of us were very hungry. Soooo.... the avocado egg rolls... yeah... who knew that guacamole egg rolls would taste so good? Seriously, wow! We paired that with biscuits and chicken, which was equally good, although it was a little underseasoned. Surprisingly, there was enough left over to take home for lunch the next day. Talk about a lot of food! The service continued to be great during the meal, and our server was equally helpful when it came to that vaunted moment... the cheesecake selection. MMMmmmm. I've noticed something about the cheesecake, it's a little dense here. Ok, I lied... it's really dense. It's so dense, I saw a full cheesecake break a table. Scout's honor. The Chocolate mudslide cheesecake comes complete with chocolate oreos inside... which, while good... completely ruin the cheesecake. The oreos are grainy, where the cheesecake is smooth. Otherwise, it was good, but a tad too sweet. I'll have to try this place again, but it was pretty good. I dug it, I'll have to be sure to avoid the crowds though. ;)"
Clarissa P.,"Oakland, United States",23,10,,4.0,8/2/2008,"Love the extensive menu, although I usually end up ordering the Chicken Madeira.  Generous portions.  Love the martini specials: good size, perfect amount of alcohol & delicious as well.  Love the view from the patio. Service is hit or miss depending on how busy it is. Hate, hate, hate the wait for a table & at the bar during peak times."
Allie W.,"San Rafael, United States",28,94,1,4.0,7/2/2008,"Yes, it's overcrowded with tourists. And there are so many pigeons scurrying around my feet on the outside patio, that I often worry about accidentally kicking one.  But! The view is outstanding, the portions are large and generally fresh, bathrooms are clean. And Linda's Chocolate Fudge Cake is amazing! Like a giant Hostess cupcake..."
Denise M.,"South San Francisco, United States",202,1022,8,4.0,3/2/2008,"Good and bad with this place.  Mostly good though.  The food in general is yummy, but not consistent.  The bad - the waiting.  Oh good God, the waiting!  Even with a reservation, it's loud and crowded and just annoying.  People get pushy and they really don't care that they're standing at the mouth of the escalator, so you have no where to go.  You get the paging disk, and even after that thing buzzes, you have to wait for someone to call your name to seat you.  So you'd better be listening.   My absolute must have here is the Fried Macaroni and Cheese.  I'm a big mac and cheese fan - what better way than to fry it up and serve over creamy marinara sauce?  Thai lettuce wraps, sweet corn tamale cakes, crispy crab won tons, their clam chowder - all good.  For entrees, go for the chicken and biscuits, the crusted Romano chicken, the herb crusted salmon, or the bang-bang chicken and shrimp.  All delicious!   The restaurant serves up HUGE portions, so be prepared to doggie-bag half your dish. Desserts - need I really say?  Cheesecake all the way baby!  I'm very simple.  Strawberry cheesecake does it for me.  Big slice of their plain cheesecake with large glazed strawberries.  Two giant dollops of fresh whipped cream.  It's smooth, creamy, and oh so yummy.  If you do an appetizer and then go straight for dessert - then you're smart. Another good thing here is that if you have a Macy's Visa, you can charge it and get Macy's shopper points."
Lynn P.,"San Francisco, United States",44,106,4,4.0,30/1/2008,"Love the cheesecake factory. best burger, salads and fried calamari ever! little disappointed on the pastas. hate the long wait for dinner but it was worth it."
Jonathan L.,"San Francisco, United States",221,39,7,4.0,27/1/2008,"First off - the view outside on the patio is worth the extra wait. On a cold night, the outdoor overhead heaters are a perfect added bonus.One of my fondest memories is a family dinner taking place on a beautiful San Francisco night at this spot. I actually didn't eat the cheesecake.. I thought it would almost be clich so I got something un-cheesecake for desert and ended up thoroughly satisfied. Bravo."
Nancy Y.,"Los Angeles, United States",317,257,47,4.0,27/1/2008,"""Hi, welcome to the Cheesecake Factory, may I help you?"" During my brief stint as a hostess at the Cheese while I was in college, I chanted his line a billion times. So here's a rundown of how things work here and why things are the way they are here.  1) ""Unfortunately, the cheesecake factory do not take reservations"" - Yes, the wait time is ridiculous. 2 hours on a friday night, what are you thinking you might ask. To be honest, the Cheesecake Factory IS highly demanded. It really is that busy. As a hostess here, I know first hand that they do seat you in the fastest, most efficient way possible. The technology they use to schedule seating is much more advance than any other highly demanded dining establishment. Basically, the second that a guests leaves, that table will be cleared and ready to seat within 1 minute time. It's very difficult to do reservations because the demand is already high enough without reservations. 2. ""This menu is a novel!"" Yeah, you're not the only person that noticed. One of the reasons why people frequent the Cheese so much, even with the wait, is because the menu is highly eclectic. Can you think of any other place that can accomodate every person's taste? In the mood for asian? No problem. In the mood for pizza? No problem. Mex? There's Tex-Mex available... It's just the easiest non-planning option. And we all like consistency to know that the food is good every single time.  3. The desserts are NOT made in the restaurant. Yeah, sad as it may sound...they are all shipped day-of from the corporate headquarters in Calabasas Hills. Bet you can't tell can you? 4. If you want the booth seat, ask for it in advance. Those are most difficult to come by. You have to request for it in order to guarentee to get it. Otherwise, you could be waiting a very, very long time after you have been promised normal seating. I am reviewing the SF location, because the scenery there is absolutely gorgeous!! It is located on the top floor of the Macy's tower and provides an excellent view of the city. It's a very nice setting. I have tried most of the menu, but the best dishes are: Appetizers: Can't go wrong here. Most are great, but the spinach dip, artichoke, and avocado eggrolls are excellent Entrees: - Chopped salad - Chicken maidera - Steak Diane  - very, very tender. - Miso salmon Desserts/drinks: If you like sweet drinks, the best is the peach bellini. You barely taste the liquor at all. - Vanilla bean cheesecake - Strawberry shortcake - Pumpkin cheesecake -- this is highly seasonal, but it's a great alternative to pumpkin pie. It's really something you must try - Strawberry cheesecake On Sunday mornings, they have a special brunch menu. The belgian waffles and the eggs benedict are definitely the most popular pick. It's gorgeous and tasty!! Note that I no longer work at the Cheesecake Factory. But surprisingly, this is the place I will still go back and eat just because it really does provide a great atmosphere and great food."
Matt G.,"Albany, United States",1,155,,4.0,21/1/2008,"3.5 stars. Good food, creative drinks, solid service. Parking is pricey garage across street. -1 star for always having a ridiculous wait list."
David O.,"Walnut Creek, United States",127,1282,937,4.0,11/1/2008,"Come to the Cheesecake Factory hungry and you will experience, firsthand, the teachings of Confucius: Me:  Hello, we're hungry and we'd like a table for two. Hostess:  ""You must learn patience, Grasshopper!  Take this electronic pager.   When your mind has finally lost all hope for food, the buzzer will ring and you shall be seated."" 30 minutes later, my knees and back ache and I don't know if I'm waiting to eat or for a shot of morphine to dull the pain.   The pager buzzes red and we bring it back to the hostess.   We are told to wait a few minutes more... Well, my wife and I finally sat down some 35 minutes later on a Tuesday afternoon, around 2 PM, to eat our lunch.   I must say that the experience, once you finally do get seated and your waiter brings you your bread, is truly a pleasurable one. We were waited on by Dan T, a charming person who brought us our food with a smile and kind words.    We ordered way too much food:  Fried Mac & Cheese balls, Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Buffalo Blasts, and some Roadside Sliders with Cheese.   Because we'd waited a long time for our table, we thought we deserved a drink, so I went with the Well Mannered Martini, a beautiful martini with Ketel One served with 2 blue cheese stuffed olives.   My wife had a Stoli Sprite, her tried and true drink of choice. We ate a lot, and we still had a whole bunch of food to take home... enough, in fact, for 3 additional individual meals... So while the total bill was $85, tax and tip included, you can divide it roughly by 5 to figure out the cost of a meal per person... $17....   That's quite a good deal, methinkst, especially for such yummy food! I still have to dock 'em a star for the long wait.... There's no way I'd ever come here on weekends or weeknights... Weekday lunch is tolerable, but this grasshopper ain't got that much patience, sorry!"
Frank N.,"Campbell, United States",9,163,2,4.0,20/12/2007,"This use to the cool place to have dinner in the city.  But now everywhere you turn theres a Cheesecake Factory.  The view of Union Square is Awesome! Especially during winter time.  This restaurant still has the best location of any in the Bay Area.  The food is pretty good and in decent proportions.  O yeah can't forget about the strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  This is kind of a tourist spot, but I don't mind."
Chili B.,"Los Angeles, United States",14,481,,4.0,19/12/2007,"Location location location.  Christmas shopping in Union Square on a Thursday night, there really isn't much choice when it comes to dinner spots.  Sure, it's a chain, they're all the same. The view is great, location can't be beat, food is always good, drinks are good. Desserts are delicious."
Janney B.,"San Leandro, United States",1547,497,11,4.0,19/12/2007,"My ex-boyfriend proposed to my ex-best friend at a Cheesecake Factory.  When I learned of this, I spent three weeks getting to know some guys named Ben and Jerry - and romanticizing the so-so years Mark and I were together in college.  Then, after the sadness passed, it turned to anger. I spent three years bitter at the two of them for breaking my heart.  Over and over again, I remembered how sad I was when we broke up, how happy she was when they got together, AND how romantic it must have been when he proposed on one knee in front of a crowd at the mysterious Cheesecake Factory. When I learned there was one here in SF, I was floored.  I had to go!  What I discovered was a place that was busy, had surprisingly tasty food, and was filled with tourists.  My sandwich?  $11.00 Learning that the a-hole who broke my heart proposed at a fancy version of Denny's?  PRICELESS."
Angela L.,"San Francisco, United States",47,997,621,4.0,17/12/2007,"FOOD: 1.) Rigotoni pasta = With tomato sauce with pancetta, it was good but not super great or anything. 2.) Hitachi steak was really good, the special sauce was yummy, and the meat was cooked to a slight crisp around but very tender in the center. 3.) Rasberry lemon cheesecake = Very yummy. 4.) Strawberry lemonade = Normal, maybe could've used a little sugar. 5.) Apple cider = It wasn't SPARKLING apple cider. =( Poo. SERVICE: One hostess was really nice, the other was seemed annoyed at the busyness. They should make it clear where to stand in line to talk to the hostesses, because it was unfair how some people were attended first, while others were waiting longer. The wait can be terrible if it's a weekend and during Christmas time. Our waitress was nice and genuine, and recommended some good food! ATMOSPHERE:  Romantic = On the 7th floor of Macy's, with patio seating and a view of the Christmas tree in Union Square. Very nice interior decoration, reminds me of the ornate Las Vegas decor. They had high ceilings with murals on it, there were swirl patterns everywhere, roman columns, dim lighting, candles on the tables, the patio could've used more heat lamps."
Keila E.,"Los Angeles, United States",84,161,,4.0,14/12/2007,"I love this place. I know, I know. The wait is notoriously dreadful..the food is generic...and its a motherfucking chain restaurant. But its tasty comfort food and the portions are big. Oh, and it is pretty expensive. BUT the portions are so darn big you can take half of it home!! The appetizers are delicious (especially the mac n cheese balls, the crab rangoon, thai lettuce wraps) I have had the burgers here and wasnt impressed. The pasta dishes are amazing and the chicken marsala is always a good option!  The last time I was here I got the hibachi steak that came with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. It was delish!!! The potatoes could have standed a little more wasabi but they were warm and creamy!  The cheesecake is always a must. I usually get the banana cream cheesecake (it has bavarian cream on it!!) but I have tried the tres leche cheesecake which was delightful.  Come here on a Tuesday or Wednesday on an off season for Macys. you wont wait at all."
Mike S.,"Austin, United States",106,27,79,4.0,4/12/2007,"This food gives me mud-butt. I always seem to end up feeling really lousy if I eat food here. I think I actually enjoy the free bread they serve more than the actual food. The cheesecake is the bomb though. That really is where this place shines! Also the drink and bar area. Get some drinks and hang out on the roof patio area with one of the best views of the city! Whether it's Peanut Butter Cheesecake, Key Lime Cheesecake or Dulce De Leche Cheesecake, you're at the right place. But if you come in the evening, be prepared for a long wait."
Jenny K.,"San Francisco, United States",145,107,9,4.0,2/12/2007,The wait time at the Cheesecake Factory at Union Square is so freakin' long. It took my party at least 1 hour - 1 1/2 hours to get a table.  The wait time at the Palo Alto restaurant is much better.  All I can say is their pasta is delicious and reasonably priced. I usually can take half the pasta home for left over.. Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes are the best & the yummiest. They offer so many flavours of cheesecakes.
Nancy P.,"Concord, United States",16,90,,4.0,14/11/2007,I love the menu...and the decor....the service is slow...and it is always crowded...don't think I have never had to wait for a table.  It is a fun festive place...perfect for birthday celebrations...worst part is trying to decide which cheesecake to order!
Bryan Z.,"Mountain View, United States",7,33,,4.0,9/11/2007,"We had a party of 11 on a Sunday and only had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. That may seem like a while but you're in a gigantic Macy's so there's no shortage of things to meander through. I've eaten at this chain maybe 3 times in my life. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake so any restaurant that uses that as it's main selling point isn't high up on my list of places to eat. But I was glad to eat here b/c I got to spend time with my family and catch up. I had the Jambalaya pasta that had chicken and shrimp in it. It was a little spicy but I put crushed red pepper on everything I eat and drown burritos in hot sauce, so my tastebuds are skewed towards heat. The portions were huge (I had leftovers for lunch the next day), the food was really good, and the waiters that we had were all good... except for the guy who may have been flirting with my little sister. He was lucky I didn't need a steak knife with my meal."
Diana T.,"New York, United States",28,106,14,4.0,6/11/2007,"love love love love the view from the patio. have been here two times since i moved to san francisco, both times i've eaten on the patio (right next to the glass!!). food is always delicious. service is great, smiley/friendly waiters.   my party never has to wait because of a trick i've discovered.. muahahahaha.... o yes, the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake is simply divine..."
Juliane N.,"San Francisco, United States",636,596,765,4.0,4/11/2007,"Wait is long but I always like it here. Yea it's a tourist trap but it never seemed to bug me. Tex mex roll, kobe burger, chicken avocado egg roll, chicken marsala or bbq chicken salad are yummy. Portions are for two and you can have another meal at home for the price of one. i try not to go for dinner since the wait is horrendous! Lunch is a better option with the same menu."
