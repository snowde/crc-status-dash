Leah O.,"San Francisco, United States",5,37,1,4.0,30/10/2007,Went there on my first night in the city as it was really close to my hotel. Loved it. Its so much nicer than i expected with that name. Great terrace as well with amazing views in the evening. yes there was a bit of a wait....but I'd just landed from London so it didn't strike me as unusual. It was one of the few places with a good buzz on a wednesday evening...which was exactly what I wanted. Loved the food! Huge yummy portions....i spent so long looking at that ridiculously long menu...making many mental notes on what to order next time...as there will be a next time (and I don't even like cheesecake).
Ryan B.,"West Hollywood, United States",167,145,11,4.0,24/10/2007,"Food - GREAT! Waiters - Hot/Sexy Decor - Stunning Views - Spectacluar 2.5 hour wait for dinner on a wednesday? - PSYCOTIC! all and all a great place, IF you dont have to wait 1/2 the day to get a table... Can you say open a SECOND LOCATION... theres a million dollar idea that took no brains!"
Hana S.,"San Francisco, United States",23,91,,4.0,22/10/2007,"The food is always as expected- yummy.  The wait also as expected- forever!. Cheesecake is like any other cheesecake I have been to in cali. Loud, busy, people, and babies.  I have been to this one twice, 1st time with girl friends and other was a double date.  Both were awesome times!"
Zakkary Z.,"Eureka, United States",9,22,,4.0,16/10/2007,"I like the food and love the cheesecake, but I hate the wait. Here's the trick to get your fix without the crowd:  Get there when they open.  They have a cheaper (before 5 pm) lunch menu to make it worth your while. If I can't open the place then I get the cheesecake to go and enjoy the great food court in the basement."
Ghiz S.,"San Francisco, United States",27,62,28,4.0,11/10/2007,One of my favorite places to eat in downtown. Try their salmon dish.........it's pretty good :)
Eileen L.,"San Francisco, United States",344,1307,15,4.0,10/10/2007,"I went with a few of my friends for a birthday. The food was very tasty and looked very appealing to me. I recommend the four cheese pasta. It was delicious. Although, I suggest avoiding the green tea smoothie . It tastes good at first but when it melts, it tastes pretty funky. The cheesecake wasn't very good either. There is a lot to choose from on the menu and they all look pretty delicious. The price is pretty fair considering the quality and it fills you up . They open pretty late for a restaurant and have a nice view to look at too. I give this place 4 stars because despite the good food, there is a very long wait. You can't make reservations and you usually have to wait at least 1-2 hours because they're almost always busy. Also, they have very poor lighting. Too dark. It gave me a headache. Overall, I would go back. I think this place is worth a visit."
J R.,"Daly City, United States",8,56,21,4.0,2/10/2007,"Me and the husband usually head over to the Cheesecake Factory after spending a day and all of our money down at Union Square...I really like all the menu choices, and always get something different every time we are there...Their strawberry cheesecake is the main reason we go there! I really don't like the long wait and the crowded mess in the front....We have left a few times just becuase it was so over crowded and nuts in there....Sometimes we gave up on the wait and just froze our bungholio's off and sat outside..... All in all, Cheesecake Factory is good..But if you are in a rush then you should probably go somewhere else!"
Laura W.,"San Francisco, United States",299,204,13,4.0,24/9/2007,"I looooove the food at Cheesecake, I don't care if you want to call me a boring, conformist sheep, I still love it!! They give you way too much food, but once you get used to just eating half and taking the rest home, it's a great way to have delicious lunch all set for you the next day.  Almost everything I've eaten there has been amazing (and I love the cheesecake too, although I hardly ever have room for it anymore).  They give you lots of bread at the beginning, which is good because you're starving from waiting an hour to be seated.  But, the food is always worth it! Here are some of my favorites: Thai lettuce wraps - an appetizer that is so good I sometimes order it as a meal. Crispy Chicken Costelleta - sooo good, garlic butter mashed potatoes, asparagus, and the best sauce ever. Chicken Picatta - a classic, nice and delicious. The cocktails are also excellent (although VERY expensive... don't have more than one).  I've had the bikini martini, the mai tai, some peach thingy, and others that I can't remember anymore.  But I know all of them were good! I don't go all that often because of the wait, and because I like to try new places, but sometimes you just get that Cheesecake Factory craving... mmmmm!"
Nancy M.,"Seattle, United States",119,183,140,4.0,23/9/2007,"I don't care that this place is a chain; I think the food is yummy.  The dinner portions are really large, I usually end up taking some home, while their lunch portions are much more manageable.  The dinner wait is insane, generally 2+ hours if you're there during prime dinner hours, which is why I don't come here very often (minus 1 star for not taking reservations!).  Their cheesecake is oh-so creamy and decadent.  My flavor of the moment is the lemon-raspberry cheesecake; a perfect combination of sweet and tangy.  If you have the patience and time to wait for a seat, enjoy it at the restaurant.  Otherwise, you can order your slices at the counter to go and take them down to Union Square to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city."
Joe V.,"San Francisco, United States",61,104,7,4.0,6/9/2007,"Chain store indeed, but I truly like the place.  The waiting can be really long at times (sometimes taking as long as 1 hour esp. if you go there during the holidays).  However, there food is good, not great, but good enough to eat and bring home if you can't finish it.   What gets me the most is the service, the cleanliness of the bathrooms, the tv's to keep up with your fantasy sports (sorry ladies), and the location.  If you get a window seat, you're looking at Union Square right across the seat.  It can be pretty fun if there are events going on such as free jazz concerts hosted by KKSF or during Xmas."
kristi l.,"CA, United States",262,221,60,4.0,3/9/2007,"Fine; The service is usually bad, the wait is always 1.5+ hours long, blah blah blah... But there isn't enough time in the world that would keep my fat ass away from the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake when I'm craving it. Yummy chocolate top, creamy mouss-y middle, spongie chocolate cake crust: Oh. My. God - Janice style. With 300+ reviews prior to mine, everything that needs to be said has been said. Only one little warning: the Cheesecake Factory homeless guy that hangs around in the evenings is volatile. He throws Chinese poppers at your feet if you don't tip him for opening the door for you. Bastard. Whatever, I'm usually too drunk off chocolate to care. Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake you're my #2 dessert...after Roltee (:"
Jorge D.,"San Jose, United States",320,108,18,4.0,27/8/2007,OK ok besides the long wait ALWAYS! I think its really worth the wait! A big selection of food and Chicken! plus BAR! If I had to vote on the RANCH DRESSING alone i'd give the CCF 5 stars! If your a ranch lover then this is the BEST ranch I've ever tasted!! YUMMY! Sometimes I totally decided my meal around the ranch! and one time even tried to steal it. If you don't like LONG waits and lots of people then this place is not for you...you can always grab your buzzer thing and go take a nap in the Macys furniture part :)
Kathleen N.,"Seattle, United States",116,229,76,4.0,27/8/2007,"The Good: Godiva cheesecake. It's the ONlY reason why I am giving this place four stars. The Bad: There is always a wait for a table here, no matter what time of day you come. The Ugly: The crowd is mainly tourists who have no clue where else to go eat in the city. My recommendation? If you must eat here, always leave room for cheesecake. Otherwise, eat somewhere else and get the cheesecake to go...."
Erin M.,"Woodinville, United States",117,501,87,4.0,23/8/2007,"As far as food goes, you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. I figure that's true for most chain restaurants like this. I remember the first time I opened a Cheesecake Factory menu... novel is a more appropriate description.  Anyway... most of us know about cheesecake factory food- relatively inexpensive, well-rounded, decent but not stunning food. Personally, I'm not into the food. But, this Cheesecake factory wins because of the awesome view. Most dining establishments with this kind of view of SF will charge three times as much per plate. Conversely, you can come to this location and buy a single slice of cheesecake, and it's alright to just enjoy the view. I esp recommend a meal here for tourists interested in Union Square (who isn't?!?) I love it."
Keagan M.,"Oakland, United States",85,138,8,4.0,23/8/2007,"One good thing good about this place and all their other locations is GOOD drinks!!  I always leave this place fucked up!  The wait may be insane but youre in San Francisco, Union Square...go shop!!  Or go to the bar and most likely you can snatch a table if youre agressive enough.   Though this place is my default Ive had things on the menu that werent that great, actually complained and didnt have to pay it was that bad.  But the chicken potstickers are bomb, I'll just eat that for dinner.  Recently I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and LOVE it!  Started making it at home actually. I have to say though I was so heart broken last time I went, my favorite Cheesecake of about 7 years, the Coffee Heath Bar Crunch is no longer being sold!!  So disappointing. Anyway the decor is great, the view outside is fabulous...the wait is crazy...go if youre not too uptight about life in general, you'll have fun."
Adela K.,"Los Angeles, United States",22,127,,4.0,14/8/2007,"the cajun jumbalaya with fettucine (and extra sauce on the side!!!) is killer every single time. everyone else at the table was complaining about SOMEthing, but i was too involved in my own euphoric state to hear them.  the cajun jumbalaya is like HOME to me, ok?! it also helped that i was the last one in the group to arrive (i was the farthest away!) and didn't have to wait for a table.  so i didn't begin my meal with pent up road rage..."
Rachel T.,"San Francisco, United States",62,312,13,4.0,30/7/2007,"I give this place 4 stars for many reasons. It's retarded how long you have to wait for a table at this place, but you kind of figure out why once you're inside. The SF location is quite good. It's a lot better than any location I've been to. It's neat because it's high up and if you get seated outside, you can see out into the street. For someone who doesn't live in the city or go to the city often, it's neat for me. Anyone who goes to the Cheesecake Factory can admit the food is pretty good and usually have a good time there. It's not a bad place to meet up with friends and eat food and get some drinks. I've gone to some other locations in California but I really like the SF location. Expect a long wait though!"
Gabor C.,"San Francisco, United States",3,26,1,4.0,29/7/2007,"I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I love this place. If anything, I come here a little too often. The service and the food is great, the selection is huuuge.  If I were them, I'd raise prices because that line is just waaaaayy too long. I'd be willing to pay 50% more if I knew I didn't have to stay in line. When you arrive, they'll give you a little wireless buzzer to let you know when your table is ready. They'll tell you that you can't take it even onto a different floor. You'd think you're grounded but this isn't true. I've happily shopped at the Borders across Union Square and returned with 10 minutes left to go on the estimated wait time. They never found out."
Robert M.,"San Francisco, United States",178,453,292,4.0,27/7/2007,"Margie is soooo right about the weight thing -- only problem is my first number was already a 2!  While not earthshaking (this is a chain, after all), the food is quite entertaining and sitting out on the balcony high above Union Square is thrilling for any San Francisco resident or visitor.  Even the seagulls have personality. I brought my red-neck on a banana peel dad here for dessert after dinner at Tadich Grill and before I knew what was happening he was snapping a photo of a young gay Asian guy, saying ""I just want to see you put that big thing in your mouth.""  (Talking about his sandwich.)  Of course this had entirely different connotation to me and my neighboring table than it did to this 88 year old retired construction worker from the Midwest.  Only real downside is the horrendous wait -- you really have to pace your arrival to get a seat the same night."
kiki b.,"New York, United States",66,220,11,4.0,22/7/2007,"menu is overwhelming, especially if your already a little drunk.  got take out, would never be crazy enough to wait and dine around the best and biggest of middle america.  pulled pork sandwich hit the spot, the crab cakes were surprisingly good (yes i got bbq pulled pork and crab cakes, don't judge me, its called beer munchies or vodka red bull munchies)  anyway you all know its a tourist trap, it's on top of MACYS for crying out loud.  accept it for what it is and go if you want to.  but do not expect it to be something its not ,as you enter Macys to get to it ."
