ELIZABETH W.,"San Francisco, United States",45,112,5,4.0,21/7/2007,"I live in San Francisco and i enjoy a meal from a chain restaurant every once in awhile...yeah that's right I said it.  Although I have never eaten in Cheesecake Factory I have gotten take out from here numerous times considering it is across the street from my work.  Today I got the chicken avocado club with fries and man was it good...greasy, but good.  The bread was buttery and grilled with the perfect amount of ingredients in the middle.  When I feel like spoiling myself at lunch I get take out from the cheesecake factory."
Renate V.,"El Cerrito, United States",78,81,11,4.0,18/7/2007,"I love to take my son here at Christmas and sit by the window with the fog and drizzle outside.  It's a fun place with some good fancy diner type things.  The popcorn shrimp are great, and so are some of the salads and sammies.  I could not eat here more than once or twice a year, but for the occasional buzz it is quite good, and the food is consistent.  If the place were not such a zoo, I would come here on a reglar basis just for the salads,  If you have not tried them, you should."
Michelle S.,"Palo Alto, United States",4,28,7,4.0,16/7/2007,"What a great restaurant! After riding an elevator to the top of a shopping center, you find yourself at the cheesecake factory, with a great view of the city and good food. I got the Santa Fe salad, which was very big, zesty and delicious."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, United States",296,525,4,4.0,26/6/2007,"Wait maybe THIS is my favorite C.F. location!  Why you ask?  Well because it's in Macy's and there's outdoor seating.  On a nice day you can sit outside, about 5 stories high and gobble some good eats all while taking in a view of Tiffanys (among other things). P.S.  The wait here is RIDIC-ulous!  I'm always scared to ask because it's never under 1 hour!  Although when I came here with my friend who is a manger at the Four Seasons in Maui, all she had to do was show her card, and POOF we were whisked away to a table without so much as putting our names down...oh baby that's what I LIKE!"
philip l.,"Castro Valley, United States",27,23,,4.0,17/6/2007,"the food is great ,but the wait is a killer,but thats ok ,just walk to the bar and get a drink! nice place to eat  ,if your really want to wait 15-20mins!"
Kenneth J.,"Berkeley, United States",134,91,12,4.0,13/6/2007,"I don't know what attracts me to this place but I keep coming back despite the long wait time and the crowded elevator getting to the restaurant. The food is always consistent and the service friendly. If I had to complain about something, it would have to be the plastic water glasses. Somehow I think a place like this would have glass ones.  My personal favorite is the shrimp club sandwich but expect a sandwich explosion every time. 04/27/07 Dined here before a Jersey Boys performance and the staff was very accommodating in getting my wife and I there on time."
Stephanie L.,"Mililani, United States",489,317,704,4.0,8/6/2007,"4 stars mostly because of the food. Everytime I go, I order the Pasta Da Vinci. A must try, by the way! The food is always consistent and tasty and the staff is always friendly and funny. I really like to do Take-Out when I'm on the go. My recommendation if you're going to watch a movie downtown.... get Cheesecake Factory to go and sneak it in! OMG it's sooo good while watching a movie!! I do it ALL the time! Anyways, if you can get past the extremely long waits (if you're dining in that is), the food is pretty good!"
patrick o.,"San Francisco, United States",94,199,1,4.0,6/6/2007,"I truly can't give this place anything less than 4 stars.  All of the memories, I've had with this place.   THIS IS A GREAT FIRST DATE SPOT.  The food is super consistent.  Nothing ruins a first date, than $hitty food.  The service is hyper-hyphy most of the time I have been here.   The wait is usually long enough that you can't help but talk to your date.  Nothing like those uneasy first date feelings, standing out on the balcony staring at Tiffany's with that girl, whom gives you those puppy dog eyes on your first date.   BIG BIG MINUS STAR for the ridiculous wait time.  I always say that they should just close down the floor under Cheesecake factory and make another Cheesecake Factory."
zoe w.,"Sydney, Australia",0,34,,4.0,5/6/2007,"well, the reason I give 4 star is because this place is absolutly great despite I never wanted to step into a American chain restaurant. I've heard about this place and passed by in other cities many times but never wanted to go coz I just don't beleived in American chain. However one day I saw this on TV and I heard they have 14 types of cheesecake on menu! (though I later found out the cheesecake is just ok and expensive....) But the menu is amazing, and the pasta was absolutly delicious (Spicy Chicken Chipotle?) I normally don't order pasta when I dine out coz I can cook better one than most of the restaurant. but this one was really good. btw, the service was great and nice, and I waited for less than 15mins so I finished the menu while I was waiting (there was seat outdoor but I didn't want my food to be blowed away....)"
Nick A.,"San Bruno, United States",29,58,,4.0,4/6/2007,"Everytime I go here there are two common factors: a long ass line and .......great food! Although I am a picky eater and don't really have a nack for trying new foods, I can't turn down the Chicken Littles...oh man, those get me...The staff is usually nice but sometimes I'm waiting for the little things..like the bread and refills on drinks"
Nicole W.,"San Francisco, United States",1,31,,4.0,28/5/2007,"I went to this place today about an hour before they were going to close. We ordered: three appetizers, one main dish, and a slice of cheescake. And the waitress just smiled! When I ordered coke, she came out with COKE and TWO glasses of water! Now that's my kinde service Not to mention an adorable and cute Eastern European Russian guy seated my Father and me."
Emma H.,"Portland, United States",13,43,1,4.0,20/5/2007,"Come on, you all have to admit that you've brought your friends here when they come to visit.  I mean, I'd never go with local friends, so tourist friends are the perfect excuse!!!  The food is actually pretty good, and it lasts me for a couple meals.  Oh man, I even admit to taking touristy pictures with my friends out on the balcony with Union Square in the background.... wait, I never said that."
Michael G.,"San Francisco, United States",5,15,4,4.0,17/5/2007,"I like this place. Where else can you enjoy a seemingly infinite assortment of cheesecake while enjoying a beautiful view a top of Union Square. I recently went there with my gal at 6pm on a Tuesday evening. The wait was about 30 seconds and we were offered our choice of immediate seating either indoors or out. We sat inside right next to the windows and basked in the afternoon sun while enjoying the tasty bread, generous entrees, and delicious cheesecake for desert. I have been there during regular dinner time and endured the long wait. However, I already knew what to expect. But I've also been there at 11pm to enjoy a late desert and didn't have to wait long. This review is also about the bitter naysayers in previous reviews. With such a poor attitude, maybe you were the ones who pissed off the waiters and received bad service as a result. Yes, there are large crowds of tourists, but what do you expect? It's on top of a Macy's in Union Square! Maybe you're just mad that you're favorite mom and pop joint that never has a wait and has a tiny menu won't ever be able to afford a sweet location like this one.  And if the portions are too big for you,  share with a friend!"
Yan M.,"San Francisco, United States",224,1443,654,4.0,15/5/2007,"Back in those good old college days, driving to Chicago and going to Cheesecake Factory was a novelty. It was one of the best things ever discovered and we would literally drive two hours, head into downtown, have dinner at Cheesecake and party the night away. We would literally wait for an hour just to eat there. Somehow, after CF opened in Union Sq, we weren't that excited after all, the novelty had passed, been there, done that. Everyone thinks abt is the giant slice of cheesecake but they do have an extensive menu. Pages and pages of them and if I'm not mistaken, they put ads in between the menu featuring Macy's latest styles, gift ideas, etc....By the end of the menu, you would think you just read a novel and by then, everyone is confused as to what they would like to order/eat. Anyhow, I don't remember much from the menu except that I thought the Angel Hair pasta was decent and the one item that I frequented was the Luau Salad. So I decided to rekindle the salad spirit and had the salad to go recently. Had a 15 min wait, picked up the order and chow down at home. It's still good....for that itself, I would give the salad a 4 star and the view from the balcony overlooking Union Sq is another 4. Otherwise, CF concept, a 3 star. But regardless, the franchise is mushrooming everywhere and it's still drawing in the crowds and people still continue to wait for their tables....."
rice r.,"San Francisco, United States",6,95,13,4.0,11/5/2007,"Food - was okay, like a chain store type restaurant - what do you expect? Service - always nice waiter/waitress, very attentive. Drink - this is why I'm writing this review. I'm a Mai Tai lover. Wherever I go, I order one if available. The MAI TAI from here is actually the best I have ever had. The ones in Hawaii can't even compare. Interesting isn't it? It's only at this cheesecake factory - not any other one. Cheers!"
Danster L.,"Orange County, United States",1683,730,2280,4.0,15/4/2007,"3.5 stars*** Ok, it was my birthday and my friend and I had decided we will eat here for my special day. The wait was not bad and parking was easy. However, it started to become an interesting dinner. The views from this location are very nice and thank goodness for heat lamps, or otherwise, we would of been freezing our butts off. Our waitress was nice but she seemed like she was in another world. She spilled my drink all over the table and that totally shocked me. But she cleaned it up very well and brought out extra napkins. There was a couple on my left fighting and a couple on my right who were non existent. The guy on the right side of me, left his date there to sit for half of the dinner by herself where she ended up paying and who knows what else. We ordered drinks, buffalo blasts, and cajun crispers. These dishes are my friend's and I's favorite CF dishes but they both came out kind of burnt. I posted up the pictures to show you all as well. The food was good but it was a little disappointment. Everything else was great and I would come back but when it is less crowded. 3.5 stars for the experience but 5 stars for my date! =) A memorable birthday which I will never forget!"
Al L.,"Portland, United States",10,218,1,4.0,7/4/2007,"So many sore reviews for this place!! Yes, the wait is long, but it's right in the middle of Union Square, what else would you expect? Service is great, and once they accidently gave my friend and I dinner portions for the lunch price. I find the long menu to be an asset rather than a downside, especially if you're with a group of people who all want different dishes. Their dishes are not 'culturally authentic,' but they're absolutely delicious, which is all that should matter when you decide to set foot in a place called the Cheesecake FACTORY. Eat outside if weather permits, because you really can't get a better view of the city from this side of the square."
Christy M.,"San Francisco, United States",53,218,,4.0,27/3/2007,"I like this place for the view from the terrace, Union Square, right across from Tiffany's, it's really nice. Wait time is atrocious, but the food's decent, the drinks are good, and it's a fun, laid-back atmosphere. If you can get up early enough, their Sunday brunch menu is nice (waffles, pancakes, fruit, eggs any way you could imagine)"
hello k.,"San Francisco, United States",47,200,3,4.0,12/3/2007,"What's with all the hate? I've been here several times and enjoyed each visit.  Food is quite good, generous portions, and the decor is cute.  My loud Chinese family can have a good time here without being prim and proper.  Yes, the wait can be long but some sucka in my family is always willing to wait while the rest of the family goes shopping at Macy's."
Gabriel D.,"San Francisco, United States",255,259,,4.0,10/3/2007,"Yes, this is the cheesecake factory.  There is no denying that.  And there are 2 hour lines sometimes.  But it is absolutely awesome to sit out on the patio here.  I am a jaded view snob after living in San Francisco for nearly a decade and this place passed the test.   If you happen to be in Union Square and you happen to want lunch, this is actually a good choice.  I know I'm engaging in 'restaurant relativism'.  Maybe the Taliban will come after me because of it.  I will take that chance."
