Sabrina L.,"Los Angeles, United States",202,808,421,4.0,1/3/2007,"I don't hate Cheesecake.....I don't love it...but every time I go, I'm usually happy with the food! (And love the brown bread!) In college, someone used to go and buy cheesecake slices for us to all split and bring it back to the dorms. (Ahh...those were the days!) But I do enjoy their cheesecakes. What brought us to this location wasn't the food, however. It was the rain. Pure convenience...it was closest to where we were parked & it was *pouring*. So this was a quick place to duck in and grab a bite to eat. Surprisingly, the wait wasn't long at all! (tho this was for lunch and not dinner...) I can only imagine that it would be a wonderful place to dine on the patio on a sunny day! We did have a still picturesque view of rainy union square. I give 4 stars instead of 3 because the waitress/cooks let me make my own lunch: Grilled cheese with 4 different kinds of cheese + tomato on a deliciously toasty yet still-soft-in-the-middle egg bread. (The fries went cold really fast tho. : ( That was rather disappointing). I'll post a picture of my yummy grilled cheese sammy...  : )"
Destry H.,"Alameda, United States",188,207,998,4.0,27/2/2007,"Without a question:  Great food.  Long Wait (Avg 1-1/2 hours ), Good drinks Then it is do-able. Many good appetizer & entrees. The host/hostess at times get snippy...you can contribute that to the volume of people always asking ""how much longer?"" None the less, once you're seated, service takes an upswing and the splendor of a great meal,drinks and desert take over!"
Jannie Q.,"San Francisco, United States",29,270,58,4.0,25/2/2007,"Without fail:  Great food.  Long Wait.  If you're local, best to go to dinner before 6.  Then it is do-able.   Lots of great dishes to recommend: Appetizer: 1. Avocado rolls 2. Firecracker Salmon rolls 3. Thai lettuce wraps Entrees: 1. Chicken Madeira 2. Grilled Eggplant Sandwich 3. Crab cakes Usually come in big portions. Ask for lunch-sized portions or switch out the mashed potatoes for some Mixed Baby greens! Drinks: 1. Strawberry Lemonade 2. FROZEN ICED MANGO  Desserts: Any Cheesecake your heart desires!"
Kathy K.,"Sacramento, United States",122,348,48,4.0,13/2/2007,"Never without fail, CF is ALWAYS packed. So for those who are surprised and annoyed, ummm well folks I hate to break it to you but..... 1) It's Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately for those of us who live in the fabulous SF and want for god knows what reason a piece of cheesecake and orange chicken, it is a chain, and out -of -towners who don't know better eat there because it is something they recognize away from home 2) It sits atop a Macys in the middle of Union Square. DON'T make me explain this one. 3) It's a large restaurant with lots of people and if you go to eat during peak eating hours, you will have to wait due to reasons 1 and 2 stated above. Now that I am done with my lecture, I have to agree that the wait is ridiculous at CF, but my solutions are to either go eat at an off time during the week or go to the bar.......weekends are always a nightmare so avoid at all costs if possible. Expect the wait and go a little early to get your vibrating tag and sit and enjoy the view or walk and get a drink at the bar and laugh at all of the frustrated looks on those waiting like you. If you practice enjoyment and patience I swear you'll get a table faster. If all else is lost, then sneak in near the bar, scope out the scene and see if anyone is leaving. Bar area is first come first served, so if you see people leaving a table, gently come up and say ""hi"" and ask if you can have their table when they are done. Be polite, but not too needy or aggressive. It is annoying and I have purposefully avoided giving people like that my table, prefering to defer to the nice people who don't hover like vultures as I am trying to eat my banana cream cheesecake in peace. If they are nice, it will be a smooth transition from their leaving to you sitting and avoiding the 90 minute wait for a table. The cheesecake is yummy and with so many varieties you cant go wrong with your choices. The portions are ginormous and easy enough to share with your friends or take home and enjoy the next day. I personally loved the seared ahi tuna salad and orange chicken. And their cheesy artichoke dip can't be beat."
A H.,"Denver, United States",45,112,7,4.0,8/2/2007,"I thought this place was pretty decent - I've been to the one in Chicago and this one in SF definitely tops Chi - the view is great if you are lucky enough to get seated overlooking Union Square, and in the summer, sitting outside, it must be wonderful. As my mid-west fiancee has taught me to expect, you should expect good value from a chain restaurant, and the CF doesn't disappoint.  Limited selection of rather overpriced draught beers, but that's OK.  The reasonable prices, massive portions and location more than make up for it.  Go for food, not drink and depending on the season and weather, it could be almost be romantic.  1 beer + 2 entrees = $36 (inc tax and tip).  It gets 4 start due to the location and the value for money.   It's busy - but that's a good sign, right?"
Natasha S.,"Oakland, United States",436,344,73,4.0,7/2/2007,"Actually, I really really like Cheesecake Factory food.   I'm not super crazy about the long waits at this one.  And given the option of walking over to Belden where there's bound to be a shorter wait and more culinary-schmulinary food, I would be the smarter not to come here. But every so often I get that craving.  Esp. if I'm in the need for some comfort & familiarity.  SO......OUT come the familiar frou frou cocktails.  My friend had a really bad appletini here once.  But then I had a really good caipirnha here once.  Presumably depends on who is tending.  The honey vanilla latte is also yum. OUT come the big, fat, bad for you appetizers.  Give me your avocado & tex mex egg rolls, spinach & artichoke dip, nachos, ahi tuna tempura rolls, buffalo wings, crab rangoon, popcorn shrimp.  Give me your grilled cheese, shrimp blt and Kobe burger (sis swears by this last one)!  Your multi-layered fudge cake (moist and soooo good)  and of course cheesecake.  Fav flavs: white choc raspberry truffle, strawberry, plain.  And the lo-carb cheesecake.  HAHAHAHA.  Not really.   OMFG!! I almost forgot to mention the piece de resistance -- FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  I repeat, FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  As good as it sounds."
Amy L.,"San Francisco, United States",193,510,555,4.0,7/2/2007,"PROS:  Tasty food, HUGE portions for the price, great location (you can shop while you wait for your table), and the view from the outdoor balcony is spectacular (unless you are one of those weird people who hate architecture and cities), AMAZING Godiva cheesecake! CONS:  Long waits, understaffed (I assume, because service is slow), evil addictive cheesecake has enough calories to feed both Olsen Twins for a lifetime. But, I'm a sentimental fool, and love this place despite the cons.  Besides, the leftovers taste even better the next day for breakfast...and lunch....and dinner!!!  (Yes, by this, I DO mean to imply that you get a huge amount of food for the $)"
Ladi Da A.,"San Francisco, United States",661,494,194,4.0,4/2/2007,"I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! However, the one in the City is kind of dark and feels a little more stuffy than the others.  It's too crowded due to it's location, too. I would recommend going to the other Cheesecake Factories located away from downtown.  There is a nice one in Corta Madera (I used to work in the area).  The one at Valley Fair in San Jose can get busy, but for some reason the food tastes better.  I've also been to the one in Palo Alto (parking sucks).  I thought I heard about them building another one around Burlingame or Daly City...can't wait!"
Anne M.,"San Francisco, United States",338,109,8,4.0,1/2/2007,"Karla called me up 5 minutes before I was scheduled to leave work yesterday night and invited me to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory just because we both didn't want to go straight home after work.  I actually got out of work later than I expected and dreaded getting to the restaurant knowing that there would be a wait.  I was thinking that they would give us as a wait time of an hour - an hour and a half but when I got there Karla said it was only a 15- 30 minute wait.  Not bad for the Cheesecake Factory at its prime hour of dinner service. We sat outside on the patio though it was chilly.  Karla and I kept out jackets on because the heaters were just not enough to keep us warm. Anyhow, I have always enjoyed the food at this restaurant.  They have a large menu and I never know what to choose from!  I tried a burger from them for the first time last night and I must say that it was pretty decent.  One thing you MUST try if you like Macaroni and Cheese are the FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESEBALLS.  Delicious! Sounds super unhealthy, I know - but you don't go to the Cheesecake Factory to eat healthy -- seriously, don't kid yourselves. Overall experience it was a good dinner. One gripe about last nights service is that it took SO LONG for the appetizers to come out. But otherwise, service was decent."
Lisa N.,"San Francisco, United States",14,47,,4.0,27/1/2007,"I went with a group of friends for a birthday celebration expecting this place not to live up to the hype, but it actually did. We got there around 9:30 PM on a Thursday and only had about a half an hour wait, which is pretty rare for The Cheesecake Factory. Great food, decent service, and absolutely blissful cheesecake. Tiramisu fans, get the tiramisu cheesecake. I think I reached a perfect state of zen/nirvana/whatever you want to call it. You will have leftovers and you will not regret ordering a $6.50 slice of cheesecake."
Olivia D.,"Honolulu, United States",554,560,187,4.0,24/1/2007,"Normally, I wouldn't rate a restaurant with mediocre food this highly, but I appreciate the service I received. I was staying at a very loud hotel NYE weekend and needed to kill time so that I would return to the room only after the bar next door turned off it's window-rattling house music. I arrived at the Cheesecake Factory around 11:30, had a short wait, and was seated outside as requested. They were accomodating when I asked to be moved to another table nearby. Since we were just killing time and had just eaten a huge meal, we only ordered hot teas, a honey vanilla latte, and an order of fried calamari (I felt bad for ordering so little and I know how much servers hate serving hot tea.) I never felt pressured from our server to order more or eat faster, and when my tea came out lukewarm, she quickly got me a hotter one. She also cheerfully got me extra honey and lemons. I was so relieved they didn't make me feel like the nightmare customer I was feeling guiltily like. I also thought the appetizer was really good, especially from a restaurant with ""factory"" in the title."
Nicole R.,"CA, United States",13,414,,4.0,22/1/2007,"The only time I go to the Cheesecake Factory is when I have a lot of time to spend at lunch/dinner and have tourists with me. I mean, it IS a fun restaurant...it's on top of Macy's, it's always busy, the concept is fun, you know?  The food IS good, and the menu is HUGE. I usually just order appetizers, and my meals are usually randomly put together like potstickers and mini burgers and sharing some calamari with a friend. But this place is always very crowded, so don't go if you want to dine quickly or want to avoid the masses.  A lot of people hate on it, but I think it's pretty good. But the crowds of tourists and absurdly long wait for this place makes me stay away, unless I've got some family in town who really wants to go."
Arissa C.,"Seattle, United States",572,467,201,4.0,8/1/2007,"Im suprised alot of people are disgruntled with this place- I mean everytime I come here- it reminds me of being in a restaurant in Las Vegas- montrous design of Egyptian papyrus complete with doric columns minus the ringing slot machines...Given the long wait- with beeper in tow- wander off to the bar for a drink and within 15 minutes- you'll be seated-- at least thats as much wait I've had since I've been going there... DIshes I love: THe Bang-Bang Chicken,Shrimp with Angel Hair, Shepherd's Pie and Chinese Chicken Salad...Also love the Vietnamese chicken wraps...things to skip on- the meatloaf and the jambalaya... Luv the Passion fruit Iced tea :-) Oh and dont forget the cheese cake to go-- upside down pineapple cheesecake is my fav :-)"
Jessica D.,"San Francisco, United States",197,278,49,4.0,28/12/2006,"Is there a little factory hidden inside each Cheesecake Factory location? If there is then they manufacture some good (but overpriced) food.  Albeit that the Cheesecake factory atop Macy's at Union Square is a great spot to sit out on the patio (weather permitting) and have a cocktail it's a big time tourist spot.  Other than that, I demand you order a fruity drink.  I happen to love big buildings and the views of them from in, atop, and next to them. This restaurant in the sky is a nice place to begin a night out."
Katrina C.,"San Francisco, United States",43,52,,4.0,20/12/2006,"I like the food offered at Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake and often stop by when i'm downtown, just to pick up a slice to go. It's not the best cheesecake i've had in my life, but the variations and flavors are cool to try out.  The mango/raspberry drink is my fave and chicken-fried steak is pretty good. The other items in the menu sound pretty tasty, some are kinda random, but CF is definitely worth a visit.  Minus 1.5 stars since it is pretty pricey and the wait is pretty long, but they give you a pager, so you can shop around Macy's while you wait."
Christina B.,"San Francisco, United States",76,266,141,4.0,1/12/2006,"You never know how long you are really going to wait for a table. Esp. for dinner, but there seems to be a special place in my heart for here! I love the portions, drinks, and of course cheesecake. So if you don't always mind a wait and you have time to kill this is a place with great food and deserts!"
Stella C.,Hong Kong,293,659,271,4.0,13/11/2006,"You can always rely on The Cheesecake Factory. Love their cajun jambalaya pasta, macaroni-n-cheese balls and their brown bread! And let's not forget their namesake cheesecake selection, I can never choose which one I want. Portions are large, so always remember not to eat your whole meal and bring the rest home --- just so you can have room to share a slice of cheesecake. This is definitely a place where you pack on the calories, so come hungry and leave your diet at home.  The wait for a table is a pain. No reservations allowed the wait can be up to 3 hours.  Because of the wait, coming here for lunch is never an option. We can never seem to slip in and out of here within the lunch hour, which is unfortunate because we would certainly frequent this place much more often if it was more efficient. Come here if you have the time or if you really want to stroll around Macys for 3 hours. Great view of union square, but just be prepared to wait."
Melissa T.,"Fremont, United States",285,689,138,4.0,13/10/2006,"Apparently no one else wants to admit that the Cheesecake Factory rocks... Yes, it's noisy. Yes, it's a wee bit more expensive than say.. the Olive Garden.. and yes, you'll probably have to wait a while to get a table. It IS, however, very yummy. A great place to go with the girls to have a fruity drink and massive dessert. All Cheesecake Factories are pretty good, but this one has a nice view, too."
Marijke D.,"Schoten, Belgium",3,134,,4.0,17/9/2006,"Great restaurant at the top of Macy's, with views over Union Square.  Ask to be seated outside on a sunny day, you'll have to wait a bit longer, but it's totally worth it.  Portions are huge, I think we would have had enough with one appetizer and one entree for two persons.  Eat the chocolate mousse cheesecake, it's amazing, a meal in itself.  Expect the chocolate rush to last for a couple of hours..."
Anna S.,"San Francisco, United States",52,183,13,4.0,11/9/2006,"Other than In N Out, this is the only chain restaurant I will eat at in San Fran. And the reason I do it (besides the desserts) is because of the outstanding rooftop deck. I love to have lunch here on a warm sunny day, it's really perfect. Food is good too, I don't care what the snobby's say. HUGE portions though - always share a dish with a friend unless you are super hungry."
