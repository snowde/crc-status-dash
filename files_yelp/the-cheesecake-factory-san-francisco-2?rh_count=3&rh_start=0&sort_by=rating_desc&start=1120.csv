Miss H K.,"San Francisco, United States",446,959,1946,4.0,4/9/2006,"Food: The food here is good. I've tried several dishes here but I usually order the Chicken romano or four cheese pasta. Their cheesecake is also wonderful. My favorites are the Oreo and chocolate cake cheesecake. Price: Not bad. Most entrees are $12 and up and they have lunch sized portions for a cheaper price. Portions are pretty big. Service: Good, they have lots of help here and we've never experienced any problems here. I usually avoid this place during the evenings but Sunday mornings are usually always open. Location: Located on the 8th Floor at Macys Union Square. If you come on Sundays before 11 make sure to enter through the entrance near the LV store"
Yeh F.,"San Francisco, United States",20,46,3,4.0,7/8/2006,"So maybe I like it because it wasn't all that long ago that I was an out-of-towner, and even a tourist.  Yeah, it's expensive, but that's to be expected from this type of restaurant.  And the wait isn't that bad as long as you actually plan for it, instead of spontaneously deciding to go eat here.  The portions are HUGE though.  One of the first times I went there with three other people, we ordered the Appetizer Favorites along with a main course for each of us.  By the time we were done sharing the Appetizers, we were already pretty full, so none of us could even finish the main course.  Because of how full we get from eating the main course, we never actually end up having any dessert, despite the name of the place."
Anya B.,"San Francisco, United States",11,71,,4.0,27/7/2006,"If you have out of towners coming to visit, you can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory:  a) view of Union Square b) shopping downstairs c) variety of food - everyone will find something they like e)  what else? cheesecakes!"
Louie C.,"San Bruno, United States",49,32,1,4.0,26/7/2006,Out of all the times I have come here I've only ordered the cheesecake once. I never have room for dessert! The portions are huge and that's not a bad thing!  I always have their salads. They're great! Try the bbq chicken ranch or cobb salad. Yum!
Em C.,"San Ramon, United States",71,301,804,4.0,24/7/2006,"i'm sad not enough people love the cheesecake factory!  you just have to learn to live with its flaws.  like the line.  expect it!  but that certainly doesn't mean endure it.  the best time is a late lunch.  don't bother waiting two hours (unless it's your birthday and really want to make your friends wait for you).  the food is always good.  hey its not gourmet, but that's not why people go here (i hope).  portions are definitely large, but that's what a to go bag is for.  last time i enjoyed the barbecue ranch chicken salad.  sitting on the patio on rare perfect blue sky-almost-warm days are splendid.  take the cheesecake to go, you know you don't have enough room to eat it right then and there.  there are so many different flavors to choose which is great since not all get sold at barnes n noble cafes (tip: cheaper and smaller slices sold there!)"
Nelle A.,"Burlingame, United States",216,389,23,4.0,20/7/2006,"i've been to sf, palo alto and san jose cheesecake factory, and i would say their food is consistent. though, the wait can be looonnnggg, it's worth it! love their shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta, all their salads( i already tried 5 of them ), hamburgers and their appetizers selections are all good!! and of course, their cheesecake!!! my personal favorite is their banana cream.."
Jasmin G.,"New York, United States",121,512,6,4.0,20/7/2006,"If you're visiting San Francisco, you should totally go here.  I've been to the cheesecake factory in Pennsylvania but the one in California is just so much better due to location.  Its located on the top level of the Macy's in Union Square.  There is an outdoor balcony where you can go to see the entire city.   Very fun experience.  I got a salad - I don't even remember what kind - but I always get the same thing when I go.  The portions are huge and the food is tasty.  The one thing that was a minus was that we asked for a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake and they were out of them, then we asked for oreo and they were out of those as well, we even asked for one more - and they were out of them!  I guess that means they sell fast - but come on..keep the cakes in stock!  Anyways, it was delicious - I love cheesecake factory..I haven't been to one since then and that was a year ago..but if you've read any of my other reviews i'm sure you can presume why.  If I lived in San Fran I probably would never go to CF, but I'm a tourist and its a tourist spot.  Oh one major minus is that the wait is insane and they don't allow you to call to make reservations.  That's definitely a minus"
Dani N.,"San Jose, United States",34,88,4,4.0,20/7/2006,"After having worked in the restaurant business for 3 years now I am always quite weary of incorporated restaurants.  I prefer the more mom and pop or fusion minus the franchise. But then again, there are those times that a BJ's, Chili's or Cheesecake has it's place.  We spent a long Sunday afternoon shopping all over Union Square looking for the perfect rehearsal dinner dress for my sister and boy was she picky.  Final we found one in the special occasions spot in Macy's.  We wanted to grab some dinner and since this restaurant was right there.  We put our name in, only had to wait 45 minutes (wow quick! ha) and went back to shopping... The perfect dress needed matching shoes of course. Our server ( I believe his name was chris) was really great.  Charming yet not overbearing which is how most servers are trained.  He dealt eloquently with my quirky family and served us quite well.  Dinner was great, I always like to try new things but if in doubt the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is really good.  Dessert is consistent but my cappuccino was definitely lacking.  It was more of a latte but I am weird.   OVERALL... It was really Chris who made the night great and the fact that it was a beautiful day and we enjoyed dinner outside, my favorite."
Pele N.,"San Francisco, United States",36,348,6,4.0,10/7/2006,"It is a chain that offers huge portions, reasonable prices, huge selection and very good food.  Located on the top of Macy's in Union Square, get your self a drink for your two hour wait and enjoy the view or go downstairs and go shopping for a while."
Wendy H.,"San Francisco, United States",104,1308,331,4.0,27/6/2006,"This is what I always order when I go to the Cheesecake Factory: 1) Chicken Marsala -- the best I've tasted at chain restaurants! 2)  Fresh squeeze Lemonade -- better than the fountain crap you get at other restaurants 3) cheesecake -anyone would do.  It's that good! Deducted a star for the service which is non-existent!  I know why there's always people waiting out front to be seated.  It's because they don't seat them right away.  This is a dirty restaurant secret of creating an ""illusion"" that the place is busy and to make you think that ""wow, I stumbled upon the mother of all restaurants!""   In reality, they're holding back on seating people.  I went once at 11:00 and they still made us wait a good 15 minutes w/ the other peeps.  When we got seated, I noticed that the dining room was only half way filled.  Not cool..."
Rick H.,"Oakland, United States",401,1285,1012,4.0,26/6/2006,"Cheesecake Factory is certainly more bark than bite, except for a few important attributes which cannot be overlooked.    First, the Macy's furniture department serves as your waiting area (and you *will* be waiting).  Second, it's rooftop outdoor seating area offers a unique and breathtaking view of Union Square and beyond.  A fabulous setting in which to enjoy lunch.  Third, the avocado eggrolls and the hot spinach and cheese dip are just awesome.  Finally, cheesecake. The best you're gonna find and like 40 varieties worth.  Otherwise, of the entrees, pastas and sandwiches that I've tried, none strike me as special standouts."
Meg L.,"San Francisco, United States",60,156,2,4.0,21/5/2006,"ok so I know this place is getting a lot of slack but I actually like it. Yes it is a chain, yes the wait is long, but the number of food options are beyond compare and the food itself is quite good, for the price you at least get a huge portion, which I understand is ""whats wrong with America"" but you don't HAVE to eat the whole thing, thats what doggy bags are for people. If you don't go at peak times the wait isn't bad at all and I have always received excellent service. I recommend it for groups as there are so many options and it is a fun place. Although it does attract tourists and would more likely fit in at pier 39 I don't mind it on top of Macy's, at least you get the view.  Oh and their cheesecake is delicious, get it to go after the meal though, otherwise you will be too tempted to eat it all at once."
David D.,"San Francisco, United States",2860,1088,519,4.0,19/5/2006,"Yes, I know, it's a chain store.  But the menu is huge, and the food is good.  Typically you have to wait an hour to get a table, because every high school student and young professional wants to eat dinner here.  The pagers work all over the top floor at Macy's though -- the store is above Macy's and has an outdoor balcony overlooking Union Square.  I like the Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  There's something for everyone on the menu, think TGIFridays x10.  Even with the wait I've never been disappointed.   Sometimes while we're waiting around a table in the bar will open up.  Full menu service.  A couple of times a table at the bar was even empty!   The decor is a little bizarre, like some Disneyland Egyptian tomb, but it's fun to look at.  And yes, once or twice I've also had the cheesecake.  Unlike most other people I was not impressed by it."
Alex F.,"Los Angeles, United States",25,54,4,4.0,18/4/2006,"So the food here is good. I can't really complain too much. Although my last visit I tried the nachos as an appetizer and wasn't impressed. However, I hate it here up to the point of getting seated. It's way to hectic and busy and everyone is in disarray. I don't know if I can really hold that against them though because they can only do what they can do....if everyone wants to eat there and they're packed, they must be doing something right. Just not the best place to go if you want quiet and calm. If you're hanging with some friends and don't mind waiting it's cool. I also personally don't like that they have so many options on the menu. It makes it hard to decide for me. But the positive is you have something for everyone, and like I said the food is good.  The staff is nice and honest. During my previous visit, I originally ordered the spinach dip as the appetizer and then my girlfriend and I decided to get the nachos too. The waiter honestly let us know that he suggests we go with one or the other because they are big. We followed his advice and he was right. Honesty is definitely a positive quality. Unfortunately, I've always gotten to stuffed to make it to the cheesecake, but I know my mom loves their cheesecake - she doesn't yelp, so you can count that as her review."
Alex L.,"Los Gatos, United States",309,365,9,4.0,1/12/2005,"Come just for the view!!! It's a gorgeous view of the city. Places like Cheesecake factory are a little mainstream for my tastes and there's usually a wait, but it's worth. Consistently good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff and THE VIEW!! :)"
Connie C.,"Belmont, United States",5000,1539,1424,4.0,29/11/2005,"This Cheesecake Factory is very touristy, so I rarely dine in here. But the outdoor patio overlooking Union Square is a great spot to sit on a warm sunny day. So, I usually take my dessert to go. I love the huge menu of cheesecakes - the dulce de leche is my fave - and the ""fabulous"" chocolate mousse cake (it is FAB!) is the largest slice of chocolatey heaven that I indulge in over a period of several days (it lasts for a week and still tastes yummy! so it comes out to like 200 calories x 7 = 1400)."
B G.,"San Ramon, United States",92,105,1,4.0,15/11/2005,"As much as I want to hate it, I dig the joint.  Yeah the wait is long, if you get there at lunch hour.  I've walked right in and got a table right away on off hours.  Yes, the service is slow, but so is the service in the bahamas and I like my meals to be an event, not an inhale and run.  I don't mind the 2 hour lunch, especially on a Friday.  I managed to snag their Key Lime Martini recipe and it is a big hit at parties.  So there is a chain in SF, especially union square and so it's the Wal*Mart of restaurants but hey, if you don't like it, don't patronize the place.  Go somewhere you like.  Life is too short to drink bad wine, eat bad food or keep bad company.  I dig it, I will go back. bon apetite...I hope I spelled that right because I am too lazy to look it up."
Andrew K.,"San Francisco, United States",2028,4644,,4.0,15/11/2005,"I am sorry if it is commercial and the wait is long, but this place is good. I mean there is too much food sure - but hello people - share! they are awesome with substitutions and sharing. they subbed salad for fries and gave me a helluva salad. they have some of the best views around and their food is quite delicious; especially the meatloaf."
Michelle I.,"San Francisco, United States",869,620,21,4.0,20/6/2005,"you know they're doing something right when you show up on a sunday night at 10:30pm and there's a 30 minute wait! (on a sunday?) how many restaurants in SF can say that? its insane how busy they are and i'm sure they're making money hand over fist.... the tropical drinks are really one of my favorite reasons to come. i also adore their salads. its like 3 times the size any normal person can eat, but thats ok, you can bring it home with some cheesecake.(i normally hate sweets but absolutely love their peanut butter cup one) my favorite place to wait is standing right above the 'm' of the macys sign. whats more fun than to people watch union square while drinking a monster size tropical cocktail here on the patio."
Sydney L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,216,3,4.0,16/4/2005,"Excellent pasta, I hate to admit it but I prefer them over the ""more authentic"" italian food with superstar citysearch ratings.  Best Italian chain restaurant hands down in terms of atmosphere, food quality, service, the only reason they are not getting a five is due to the ""no reservation policy"" and 20-60 minuate wait each time."
