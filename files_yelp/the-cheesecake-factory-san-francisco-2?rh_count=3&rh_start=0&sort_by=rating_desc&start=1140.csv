Ceci L.,"Sacramento, United States",26,114,17,4.0,14/1/2005,"Good place to eat... and the environment is good too... But, expensive, and you need to wait wait wait..."
David N.,"San Jose, United States",126,91,20,3.0,6/1/2018,Good food; nice atmosphere; too loud. Since when do we allow smoking on the patio overlooking Union Square? This must be against some kind of city ordinance. I enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner. They were outstanding and filling.
Rick J.,"Gridley, United States",2,3,,3.0,1/1/2018,Food is okay. The cheese cake is great. We recently visited the one and the waiter lost our credit card on his way to ring us up.
Sharine d.,"San Francisco, United States",127,274,98,3.0,30/12/2017,"This is the place to go when you have endless time...and endless patience.  Always, overcrowded with longggggggg waits...average 1-1.5hrs wait for table.  But, if you do eat here.....food surprisingly tasty.  Quantities large, service usually attentive, deserts yummy and Union Sq view is very pretty.  The only real problem is the lack of reservation system. The crowds that rush the elevator to reach the restaurant.  The mass mayhem that greets you when reaching restaurant level. The system for this location needs to be revamped. With that out of the way. .....on this occasion I was for fortune to get 2 seats in the bar area. We had exceptional,  EXCEPTIONAL. ...service from the bartender Charles. Placemat's immediately,  Drinks 2min later, bread order not long after, ordered crusted salmon dish and chicken reisling cream dish....both WONDERFUL!!!  Too many people cluttered in small area, but food & service was spot on exceptional.  Thank you Charles. ... exceptional experience to be waited on by you, while you non-stop filled dtink orders. Amazing!!"
Theresa R.,"Richland, United States",0,5,6,3.0,26/12/2017,"We have waited for 45mins which is great, had our table outside the view was amazing, the service was really good but the food wasn't that good compared to the other Cheesecake Factory places.  My pasta didn't have enough sauce on it and the portion was less than the normal. Overall it was good! Got scampi shrimp and it was for $20.99"
Jennifer O.,"San Francisco, United States",634,662,1988,3.0,20/12/2017,"I normally don't do this.  I almost never ask to speak to a manager but after tonight's shenanigans in being seated, yeah, it was necessary. The Cheesecake Factory is deservedly busy, especially at this location on the top floor of Macy's Union Square, especially five days before Christmas. We only waited 40 minutes for a table, an estimate they accurately predicted. But as my little boy and I were led to the outdoor patio with beautiful holiday views of the Macy's Christmas tree, the skating rink and holiday lights in all the top drawer retailers' windows, the hostess led us to a table away from that view while 4-5 other tables were empty and service-ready.  I asked to be seated closer to the Union Square view. Hostess: ""Oh, those are reserved."" Me: ""Huh. They are? There's no designation."" Hostess: ""Well, they are. These two are reserved."" [Now highly suspicious and wondering why we were in this table push/pull] Me:  ""Well [pointing], how about this one?"" Hostess: ""That's reserved too, there's only this table."" Me: ""Well, what's the difference between THIS 4-top (hey, I waitressed my way through college, I got the lingo) and THIS one?"" Hostess: ""It's reserved."" Me: (Amused) ""No it's not."" Hostess: ""That's all we have, unless you want to wait another 30 minutes."" (Ok, now she threw down the gauntlet) Most people- especially hungry people avec child- would hear ""30 more minutes"" and fold at this point but not me. Me: ""Well...no one asked me if I wanted a *view* table, that if I did that it'd be a longer wait. Couldn't we just have *this table?"" Exasperated, she told us ""THAT'S what [she] was assigned"" (temper flaring) and asked us to follow her like naughty children being led to the principal's office. I looked at my child, he gave me a giggle, and we followed her... (Secret meeting at the reservation desk I wasn't privy to) A few moments later, she told us to follow her and  we were led back onto the patio and wordlessly given the table that'd been open to begin with. So I sat there with my son talking about his day and admiring the view. But after a few minutes, I realized my irritation wouldn't dissipate. So I asked the server for the manager, reassuring it wasn't her, she was lovely. Waiting, I pulled up my LinkedIn message page and when the manager came by, I explained what happened and how much I admired The Cheesecake Factory who was for a long time my client, the #2 guy who'd helped build the restaurant group having left the company but I was still friendly with. ""And oh here, look: My LinkedIn page- here he is, X sent me a note he was in Dubai last month."" I told the manager about the fable of the ""reserved"" tables and advised him not to lie to guests. He looked down, a little ashamed.  I lightly scolded ""Guests always find out and feel bad about it."" Seriously, The Cheesecake Factory, you're better than this and quality and consistency are your hallmarks. Of course the food was good, The Cheesecake Factory does everything well, but service in aggregate, rounded up to a sad C. Please let this have been a one day holiday crush/glitch but if not, fix."
Isabella L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,16,2,3.0,20/12/2017,"Pros: - Good food and huge portions. - Their cakes are pretty awe-inspiring.  Giant slices and really scrumptious. Cons: - This is clearly a case of short-term gain and long-term payoff.  Their food is incredibly rich and probably not the healthiest.  I got quite sick after my last venture here. - REALLY LONG wait times, some of the worst I've seen in any restaurant.  If you come on a Friday night, you'll probably be waiting for well over an hour, crammed into a small waiting area like sardines, with loud music blasting in your ears."
Lisa C.,"San Francisco, United States",149,83,88,3.0,13/12/2017,"This is a typical Cheesecake Factory right in the heart of Union Square. The outside view is amazing, but that's the only unique thing it has going for it. I came here on a Sunday with my siblings (3 of us total) at around 11am, and it was packed. Luckily, we were seated pretty quickly since we had such a small party. The food was alright, and the service was efficient, albeit a little slow, but considering that it was packed, I don't blame them. We were seated inside since it was a bit chilly outside, but whenever I would come here, we always try to sit outside, especially near the edge since you get a great view of Union Square. Overall, this is a typical Cheesecake Factory, with an amazing outside view!"
Camille F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,16,2,3.0,27/11/2017,"Great food, but the bathrooms...take a look! I believe that maintaining bathrooms are a huge deal especially in an industry like this. There was no toilet paper in 3/4 stalls, and paper towels everywhere. I'm guessing the cleaners weren't on duty this night. Do better Cheesecake!"
Evelyn J.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,17,,3.0,20/11/2017,"Cheesecake factory has extensive menu and prices are quite pricey. We used to go in the Walnut Creek branch often. We finally gave up because it's just so busy and loud all the time. Few times we dropped by was earlier or a bit earlier and it was more relaxing. They have a nice interior design but there must be something wrong with the acoustics, it's all the same in all the cheesecake factory, just loud. And long cues of course!"
Lindsay C.,"Kennesaw, United States",1,12,6,3.0,8/11/2017,"I only gave this three stars because the food was good, but the service left much to be desired. I went to this location with a group of 4 (including myself) after a long day at a conference. Our waitress never so much as cracked a smile and seemed rather annoyed that we were taking up space in her section. We all had empty glasses and only one of us got a refill and that was only because he specifically asked for one. She didn't even bring us back our check after we paid - another waiter brought it over, even though our waitress was clearly still working since she stopped by the table to next to us within minutes of our check coming back. We never got a single thank you (other than the scribble on the receipt) or any sign that we were welcome customers. Seriously very disappointing."
Tim K.,"San Francisco, United States",34,2,10,3.0,1/11/2017,"Well I've lived here 10 years this is my first order- the menu looked amazing. I ordered white chili which was 86'd and Tex mex egg rolls that were at least crunchy- but so gross it was hard to even choke one down. I'm certain if I presented that to the person who cooked and let that leave the kitchen- that person would chew backward into a napkin removing that salt bomb from the palate. I'm certain the small amount I ingested will irritate my stomach. How can you NOT know you're sending that out? Ewww. Of course the cheesecake- Original with hot fudge on the side.....amazing. Guess that's why it's not ""the egg roll factory""  Too bad- with all those choices I wanted to try other things but maybe stick to cheesecake"
Jeff L.,"Long Beach, United States",2,9,1,3.0,28/10/2017,"Poor service. The blonde hostess was rude and immature. The food was horrible, bread was non existent for 45 minutes waiting due to a shortage. Who gives 5 pieces of chicken the size of a millimeter/dime when it costs extra? Which apparently is a pre portioned 5 oz. Usually I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I guess the chef smoked too much weed to go with all the burnt bacon, the San Francisco treat. Also it was a struggle to get water. It's 9pm on a Saturday night. Keep this in mind. But the manager was nice and took note of the food being under par"
Al H.,"Santa Rosa, United States",19,46,8,3.0,26/10/2017,"We had guests in from Michigan so we wanted a bite to eat before taking them to the airport. We got seated quickly which was great! It was a bit warm in the restaurant but anyways after taking our order and waiting a while to get our food which is understandable the waiter came out with 3 of the 4 orders. I guess there was a misunderstanding and one of the orders was never put in. I do believe it was an innocent misunderstanding, which was fine theses things happen. So the Order was later put in but due to our time crunch to get to the airport we just took the last order to go. We got an apology from the waiter and the manager which was nice. But you would think that for that kind of mistake they would leave that order off the bill, but they didn't, we ended up paying for it.  Cheese cake factory is known for its large portions! But after receiving the Togo box I noticed that it wasn't the portion size I've known cheesecake factory to be which was a bit disappointing.  Maybe it wasn't our day, hopefully a better experience next time! But the seating outside is an amazing view of union square!"
Madeline X.,"Oakland, United States",4,11,8,3.0,3/10/2017,This was by far my worst experience ever I love this place and the food is great and in GIANT portions but the waiter was TRASH he just gave us our things and left right away he didn't even write down my order
Ms. M.,"Redwood City, United States",0,28,,3.0,21/9/2017,"The cheesecakes are great, but I find their salads really disappointing. They chop them up in tiny pieces and give you a huge plate to hide that there is very little of the ingredients stated on the menu. Go for the cheesecake."
Tammy C.,"Kaneohe, United States",23,19,20,3.0,4/9/2017,Love the cheesecake factory! Try the salted caramel with ice cream! It's to die for. Kind of  warm in San Fran but so well worth it! Missing home though!
Matthew R.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,4,,3.0,21/8/2017,"Been here 3 times. The food is alright, although some of the apps taste like they were freezer burnt, like the loaded potato balls. The burgers are pretty good. The wait to get in for dinner is outrageous, even in the middle of the week (due to the restaurant being SF sized). Once you're in however, the service is pretty good. The major difference in this one is that the food isn't the same and is slightly lower quality when compared to the one in Walnut Creek. If you're taking a date, there won't be an issue really, I just wouldn't go with a big group. With this said, the service is actually good, and outstanding when you consider how busy they get."
Rebecca Rania H.,"San Francisco, United States",103,2,,3.0,20/8/2017,"The chefs are great, the food taste wonderful, but the servers make me lose my appetite."
Jaleena F.,"Union City, United States",3,8,4,3.0,11/8/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and it was around the evening time yet it was still busy because it was a friday night which was understandable. We were seated after about 25 minutes which wasn't that bad of a wait. Once we were seated, we ordered after waiting about 5-7 minutes. My boyfriend also ordered a beer when we ordered our food. After we were given our bread, I noticed that another couple got seated near us. About 30 minutes passed and we still didn't receive our food AND my boyfriend never even got his beer yet either. However, the couple that was seated AFTER us, they got their food already. We were starting to get a little irritated because we were very hungry. The manager came out and said that our food would take about 5 more minutes and he gave us a free soup to hold us off. There were many occasions that night where my boyfriend and I were just sitting around waiting for our waitress to come so we could ask about the beer, more bread, etc. The service that day wasn't that great. If it wasn't for the food being amazing, I would've given this place 1 or 2 stars."
