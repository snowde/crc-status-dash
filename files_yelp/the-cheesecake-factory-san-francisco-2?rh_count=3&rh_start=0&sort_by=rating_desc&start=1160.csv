Marie D.,"Daly City, United States",28,20,5,3.0,7/8/2017,"Went today with my husband, we sat at the bar cause there was a open table. It took a minute before we got are menus and to get are order.  We both order the chicken piccata and spinach dip. They brought out my order and said the other one Is on its way. Well we waiting for like 20/25 minutes and guess what! It never came.. we ask The waiter and he went to see . I end up Sharing my food with my husband. And end up canceling his order. But the food was delicious and to top it all off we had two awesome cheesecakes. So it end up ok I guess"
Roen R.,"Hayward, United States",44,123,25,3.0,3/8/2017,"This is just a place where you take your out of state/out of country relative/friend and want to give them a rooftop experience. Slow service, very busy restaurant. Food quality is okay. Cheesecakes are super super sweet. Expect a 30-45 minute wait for lunch and at least 1.5 hours for dinner. Would only come back here if I was showing someone around SF and I happen to be in Union Square."
Amy W.,"San Francisco, United States",179,1041,1323,3.0,31/7/2017,"Great value for lunch! I had in my FB feed that yesterday & today were 1/2 price cheesecake day. I was in  worried that it would be a mad house/super crowded. 2 co-workers and I hatched a plan to leave the office at 11:25am on a Monday to get to Union Square to beat the lunch rush. The way they seat is annoying - you put your name and number in and they give you a buzzer. then when the buzzer goes off you mingle by the hostess desk until they can seat you (so really 2 separate waits  to be seated) - we were waiting particularly long on the 2nd wait (about 2 feet from the hostess desk) - so we asked - sure enough someone else impersonated us and took our seating. (I will say it is very touristy, and loads of non-English-speaking tourists, so maybe an honest mistake by one of them). But as soon as we asked about our name we were seated. The lunch specials are a good deal - my entrée was $14.50 and enough for 3 meals. The chicken parmesan pizza (really just a round shaped chicken cutlet (very thin) with cheese and sauce and some angel hair on top.   The bread at your table is very very good, a brown bread and a sourdough, both warm served with butter. It would be great if they kept things like sweet & low and ketchup on the table since it was a bit of trouble to flag down wait staff (3x for the ketchup for my friend).   But the super nice thing was that when we all put in a credit card for the bill - rather than the usual (split it 3 equal ways - our waitress actually split it by what we ordered -- wahoo! mine was cheapest). I got the banana cream cheesecake (so MANY choices of cheesecake, all 1/2 price on this day) - Next time I am going for the Oreo, which looked great. It was $20.95 for a filling entrée and dessert - with loads of leftovers I would happy go here 1x per year for a meal and a 1/2 price slice of cheesecake."
Shania A.,"Pleasanton, United States",0,9,,3.0,22/7/2017,"This is a great restaurant. For those who haven't been here before, this is a bar, restaurant, and bakery all in one, yet still perfect for kids.  Food: The kid's menu prices were from 6-8 dollars, but the serving sizes are quite large and hard for a child to finish but worth the money The adult menu prices were around 15 dollars, but the serving size is HUGE, so definitely get 1 plate for 2. The alfredo sauce pasta on the kid's menu was a bummer because it was just boiled pasta with a small amount of sauce, nothing special. We had to ask for more sauce because it was hardly flavorful and we had to add a lot of salt and pepper. Comes with a drink The sliders on the kid's menu were great, my kid couldn't finish them. It is just a bun and chicken though :( Comes with fries and a drink. Make sure to salt your fries because they are unsalted. We got this fried chicken platter that came with a ton of fried chicken that was so soft on the inside(20 pieces) and some corn salad(delish!) and a baked/mashed potato. Definitely worth 15 dollars. When they give you your water they also give you 2 types of bread and a delicious butter. Environment:  Really Loud The patio spots are easier to get but for us it was in the sun so we declined They told us the wait time was 30 min but it was definitely less The front is dark and not good for kids but the back is perfect Really crowded in both the eating area and the waiting area. There were just people standing around Needs to make the waiting area bigger, we could not move. The view out of the patio though is amazing and totally worth it. Sky view of the Union Square Kind of confusing to get to the restaurant. Also got a virgin mojito, great Salted Caramel cheesecake WILL be the BEST thing you have ever eaten Service: Our waiter was kind of slow and we switched waiters in the middle The waiters didn't bother checking up on us in the middle when we wanted something. We had to ask other waiters around or ask ours when she/he was roaming around Other than that pretty good but the people seating us were unattentive. Food was 4 stars, Environment 3 1/2 stars Service 3 stars P.S Most Cheesecake Factories take reservations for odd times, not peak times."
Samantha M.,"Raleigh, United States",16,2,,3.0,16/7/2017,"Food is good , typical Cheesecake Factory. The patio 8stories up is awesome but holy moly it's got some slow service!!!!!"
Charis J.,"Milpitas, United States",0,1,,3.0,16/7/2017,"Food: Very pleased with all that we ordered. Meals are decently priced but their must-try is definitely a cheesecake. They have a lot of choices and you'll be sure to find one you like.  One weird thing though-- on the menu my mom was strictly looking for any entree with rice. She ended up going with the carne asada steak medallions. One the menu it said it would come with rice and fresh corn. The dish did not come with anything but the carne asada plate. Multiple people told us it didn't come with rice but that was literally all my mom was looking at on the menu when she ordered. Online it even says this: ""Certified Angus Beef Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice."" So we ended up having to order a side that was already supposed to be included in her meal. I should have asked for the menu again so we all could have looked over the menu for the discrepancy.  Wait: It wasn't bad for a busy Saturday. We waited about 30 minutes around 5pm.  Ambiance: We sat outside and that was really nice. There was a good view over Union Square and we got lucky since the weather was warm. The sun hid behind the hotels just in time when the food came.  Service: It was super slow. I get it though, I always am patient with slow restaurants because I can only imagine how hectic it can be. One red flag though was when I saw my waiter bring over a basket of bread to the table next to us. He had another one with him that he kept circling around with but he didn't drop it off to our table. We were right there. But that was fine. He eventually gave it to us after we got our meal. Like, okay that would've been nice when I was waiting awhile for the food, but again, that was fine. What ticked me off was when he finally delivered our cheesecake. He didn't bring the utensils and when he came back another few minutes without it still, my mom kindly reminded him. He gave her this stern look in the eye and rudely told her he was already going to get it. Like bro, she was very polite about it. She was just reminding you. Don't patronize your paying customers after already being lackluster with your service. I'll just assume he's had a rough day. At least the food was bomb."
Shenna J.,"Washington, DC, United States",23,100,16,3.0,1/7/2017,Super packed and busy for a Saturday afternoon. Not a fan of the service and the crowd.
Jeff W.,"Berkeley, United States",51,8,,3.0,23/6/2017,"After attending college I have a newfound appreciation for the large portions here. The fact that an entrée can be 3 meals for the average sized girl is enough reason to come here.  Despite the giant portions, the food quality is decent but not spectacular. However, you can always count on Cheesecake Factory for good cheesecake! I recommend the banana ones."
Steve S.,"Bellevue, United States",8,21,,3.0,20/6/2017,"this place is a tourist trap and it gets ugly late in  the day.  had dinner on mon nite at 9pm, the the place was filthy inside from all the traffic of the day, and it smelled pretty bad.  the food seemed normal, but it was just too dirty and gritty inside the place - this is the only CheeseFact where I have experienced this (have been to many across the country)"
Tanya B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,7,3.0,11/6/2017,I come here when there is a group of us as it has a large menu and suits everyone's needs. Every time I have went to the Cheesecake Factory however I have had to wait for a table this is mostly evening time usually 40 minutes to an hour. The price is standard in San Francisco but it's location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square which is nice. Staff are friendly and once you are seated service is pretty quick. Food is good but nothing amazing.
Shamoo S.,"Costa Mesa, United States",4,91,98,3.0,27/5/2017,"I have to commend my server Luis. He made our experience for drinks and cheesecake pleasant. Checked up on us, smiled and looked like he loved his job.  I can't say much about the front counter girl.My friend and I specifically asked to get seated outside and repeatedly said that because she looked so confused when we said we wanted outside table. When we got buzzed, hostess walked us to inside dining. Said we asked for outside seating so was given another buzzer to wait again. Really if the gal had listened in the first place, it wouldn't have wasted so much of anyone's time. I mean if you can't listen and do your job correctly as taking name and party number right, can you imagine this person trying to work their way up as a server? Major fail!!!  When we finally got our seat outside after a long wait, which we didn't mind. It was perfect! Love the view here and worth the wait."
Lisa W.,"San Francisco, United States",106,183,1089,3.0,21/5/2017,"I only been to the The Cheesecake Factory once at the Hillsdale location instead. My friend and I wanted pasta so we opted to come here on a Saturday night. It's around 6:30, union square so it's fair we wait an hour bc of how busy it can get. I know it's really hectic to get everyone's plates out in time due to how overwhelmed it was. We were told a 40 minute wait but got seated 1-1 hour and ten minutes later. We quickly ordered bc we were so hangry. We got fried zucchini for starters while my friend chose the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and I got the same thing I got last year, the Cajun jambalaya pasta. Their complementary bread came fast and as soon as we were done with that, our appetizer came. The fried zucchini was amazing. Now I know it might not sound so good, but it was so amazing where I'd say it can curve your tastebuds for chicken nuggets/tenders. After we finished that, our food took super long to come out. Waited at least 30 minutes to come to us only to find out our food has been sitting there. When I tried to dig in to my pasta, I couldn't. The pasta was so dry and hard and the food was lukewarm. Now I'm not the one to complain but if it's something like this, I can't eat it. I let my server Patricia know and she was super calm about it. She quickly apologized in behalf of the kitchen and brought me another one. Except this time, it came out in less than five minutes blazing hot. I'd say 2 star for the food and an extra star for my server. Other than that, I don't recommend Cheesecake Factory. Everything is mediocre and it's overrated."
Michael V.,"Camarillo, United States",20,10,4,3.0,17/5/2017,The most expensive slice of cheesecake ive ever had in my life and it wasnt even a sit in.  The cheesecake was legit yummy and the takeaway boxes come with a side of cream which nobody needs!!  Couldnt eat-in cos it was packed!!
Lauren C.,"Hughson, United States",0,6,1,3.0,13/5/2017,"Great food, but 3 stars because the service is OK. If you are looking for fast service & attentive waitresses this is not the place to go when they are busy. But on a good note, the food and cheesecake are to die for!"
N A.,"San Francisco, United States",18,259,903,3.0,20/4/2017,The food here is not great but fattening the only good thing in the menu are the cheesecake desserts which are decadently rich and fattening.
Anne-Marie R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,6,3.0,6/4/2017,"Good food, big portions- value for money. Huge variety on menu, something for everyone"
Candy W.,"San Francisco, United States",2,28,9,3.0,16/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is either a hit or miss depending on what day/time. Due to the location being a tourist attraction, the wait can be pretty long but I guess I'm always lucky enough to visit on days where I only have to wait 15-45 mins. I wait downstairs in the comfy sofa department in Macy's til my buzzer goes off to avoid the crowdedness. I never really had any complaints on my food but my boyfriend always order the filet mignon (medium rare) but it rarely comes out to be medium rare, which isn't that big of a deal. We usually don't have any issues with our servers but we realize that it's always people sitting around us who have a problem with theirs. Or maybe it's because we don't really like to complain. There was one incident where a family of 8 were arguing and crying, and their server ended up telling them to shut up. There was another incident where the mother and daughter felt uncomfortable with the, rather homeless-looking guy, sitting next to them and they had a hard time getting their waiter's attention.  The only real issue I have with this CF is that sometimes we'd wait for a long time to be buzzed and seated but come in to see that half the tables were empty. The first couple of times I assumed that there was possibly reserved parties but why would people reserve seperate tables all over the restaurant? And if so, shouldn't there be name tags so other customers wouldn't get the wrong idea?"
Ella P.,"San Francisco, United States",26,9,,3.0,22/1/2017,"Decent Cheesecake Factory location. Always packed, fine service. BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT OF STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE. I mean come on, this is the third time in a row, and it's not like it's an unpopular cheesecake. Figure out supply/demand."
Cameron M.,"Pacifica, United States",1,35,2,3.0,5/1/2017,"Good tasting food but bad quality, definitely a a chain restaurant, stays in your system for days which is unhealthy. But it's okay once a month."
Josh C.,"San Diego, United States",4,11,,3.0,4/1/2017,"It's Cheesecake Factory. You either like it, or you don't. The location, however, leaves a bit to be desired. If you think you've seen Cheesecake Factory when it's busy, you should check this one out. Tiny elevator to get there. Crowds spilling onto each other in a tiny lobby. Noise, noise, noise. If you can, call ahead and place an order to carry out. Because WOW is it crazy in there."
