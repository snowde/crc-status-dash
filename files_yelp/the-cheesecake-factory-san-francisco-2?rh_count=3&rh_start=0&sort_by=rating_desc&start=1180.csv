Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, United States",757,547,284,3.0,3/1/2017,"Macys and Cheesecake Factory go hand in hand, with the American chain culture. It's no wonder that they have a CF at the top of Macy's in San Francisco's busiest high end shopping area of the city. It's been a long time since I've been here, high school with my mom for lunch. Even then, we didn't have a long wait because the lunch hour rush isn't as crazy as the holiday, weekend crowd. My family isn't too big on CF, but they wanted to come here for the view.  My twin's birthdays were last Friday, which is the 30th of December. Union Square, Macy's included were still set up for the holidays. We went to Japantown and then we headed to Union Square. I did a Google search for cheap parking around the area and since it was after 6PM, the parking was averaged to $6 total. Whaaaat, that is crazy! I was expecting that we'd be paying a minimum of $20 for the parking alone. Waze took us down a shorter way to the parking lot (because the streets were a parking lot as well) and we arrived about 15 minutes from leaving Japantown.  It was 7:05 to be exact when we went to go put down our names for the wait list. He said that it would be about 3 1/2 hours. We bit the bullet and waited. It was prime time traffic on a Friday out of the city, no way would it do us any good sitting in the car. The time on the ticket that was given to us actually said to be back around 9:56PM, so three hours, take off a half an hour.  By 9:45, we were all over hanging out around Union Square. We had visited the Starbucks on the fourth floor, walked around Union Square and watched some people fall down ice skating. We went to the Disney Store and Old Navy down on Market and still had about an hour to kill before we could even head up. By the time that we went up, it was 10PM. There was a line of people waiting to make a reservation, I suppose. There were other people waiting in a line off to the side, handing their white ticket to the lady behind the counter. Some were seated right away, others were handed a buzzer. I was handed a buzzer. We scored seats in the little room that is between the indoor and outdoor seating. People were out looking at the view, I decided to wait for that until after we were done eating. We waited about 10 minutes before the buzzer started going off. The server that we had was really nice. I don't remember his name, but it took him a few minutes to come around and take drink orders...but once he came by, he was very attentive during our dining. We ordered appetizers, cheese sticks and mini crab bites. They didn't have anymore cheese sticks though and my twins didn't want anything else...so we just went with the mini crab bites.  The time for the food to come out was pretty average, it wasn't that long. One of my twin's daughter's meals came out incorrectly. The waiter offered her a soup or salad on the house, but she didn't want anything. The order came out correctly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered a piece of cheesecake and a few of the waiters came over and sung Happy Birthday to our twins. One of them sung really off key and I thought it was hilarious. I'm not sure if he always does that or if he did it because I said ""they're now teenagers""...but we all thought it was funny. Overall, would we come here for a random night? No, we wouldn't wait three hours to eat food at a restaurant that we could dine at closer to our house. I would say that the dining experience outside during the summer, is probably amazing. Even with the heaters outside, that is too cold for my liking! But the view is amazing and if you like dessert, this is a great place to come. For our time being in the city and what we were celebrating, it was great."
Ursula M.,"Berkeley, United States",325,1,,3.0,2/1/2017,This is the worst restaurant in existence they were even out of cheese cake how the he'll u outta cheese cake when this is the cheese cake factory would recommend tho guess today was an off day I been here before and they serve good food but today it was decent good service tho
Raymond S.,"Milpitas, United States",172,10,2,3.0,29/12/2016,"This place is average compared to other cheesecake factories in the Bay Area. To start off, it took 1 hour and 45 for our party of 8 to get seated at the table. The service was decent but the food took pretty long to prepare and be served. Overall, the dishes were tasty and the Cajun Jambalaya is a dish I'd recommend for next time."
Joy P.,"Toronto, Canada",172,42,145,3.0,19/12/2016,"My friend and I were walking around Union Square to find a place to eat Sunday brunch at. Unfortunately, all the top places we Yelped had a long line up, so we opted for The Cheesecake Factory. I was pretty excited considering the fact that there's none in Canada. The restaurant is at the top floor of the shopping centre and you have to take an elevator to go up. Luckily, they had plenty of seats and the view was incredible! We would've sat at the outside patio but it was raining before so all the tables and seats were wet.  I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict, because I actually had this at a restaurant in New York (called Friedman's, check out my other review) so I wanted to see how it compared to the Cheesecake Factory. I was really surprised when it came out because it wasn't what I expected. Rather than pieces of fried chicken, it was chicken strips which really lowered my expectations. The side of potatoes were a really nice touch, and they weren't salty which I liked. The creaminess of the poached egg and hollandaise sauce was a really nice balance to the saltiness of the chicken strips. My friend ordered the Bruleed French Toast, and HOLY this thing was huge. It's not like your regular french toast, it was more like french baguette...Unlike a baguette though, these wee INCREDIBLY soft and fluffy. I highly recommend this! For dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake and this was delicious. I loved the big dollop of whip cream and the amount of details put into this slice."
Sydney C.,"Berkeley, United States",5,156,38,3.0,18/12/2016,Stopped by this place for some dessert. Service was very nice. We were seated outdoor and the scenery was great. Food was okay.
Lakshmi M.,"Phoenix, United States",130,329,311,3.0,12/12/2016,"My honest rating is a 2.5 star rather than a 3.0, mainly due to crazy wait times and substandard service. This particular Cheesecake Factory location has the longest wait time or line of any Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, most likely due to its location in Union Square. However, they do give you buzzers that will light up and ring once your table is ready. Be warned, the buzzer does not work if you wander too far away from the hostess area. I would highly recommend not going near a major meal time unless you are super ready to hunker down for a wait.  Service here is either amazing or terrible. I've had attentive servers who are super nice on certain days then extremely rude, inattentive waitstaff on other days. This inconsistency really bothers me as bad service can turn any restaurant experience sour quite quickly. One good thing about this Cheesecake Factory is that it is easy to access by various different modes of public transportation (BART, MUNI, bus). This particular location is also quite nice in terms of aesthetics. The outside views are great and the inside is clean and well decorated. I'll always love the desserts and the avocado eggrolls at The Cheesecake Factory, but long lines and bad service really deter me from going there more often."
Semuteh F.,"San Francisco, United States",104,748,1401,3.0,28/11/2016,"3.5 Stars The beau accused me of only liking hipster places but sometimes I'm hip to the Midwest eateries too ;) Came here while killing time waiting for our skating session at the Union Square Rink. I haven't eaten here in years because I'm not big on chain restaurants (chipotle, chick-fil-a and super duper excluded) and quantity over quality. We had buffalo blasts to start (think buffalo chicken samosas) and then I had the chicken bellagio while beau had the chicken and biscuits. Ambient bread came out to start the meal. Bread was just okay--ate it because it was there. Portions are HUGE! We ate all of the app and then were totally conquered by our entrees. We got about 4 meals with leftovers so you can't beat the value here. In terms of the food--meh. Definitely average to slightly above average. It's a chain and food didn't exactly challenge my palette but it's perfectly fine for a place that has a bit of everything. Menu is slightly overwhelming and if you somehow saved room for dessert, there are two pages of cheesecake to choose from. All in all I guess I'm not gonna turn my nose up at this place. It's perfectly fine! Won't find any reclaimed wood, mustached waiters or mason jars for glasses here but it's a good place to get a meal in the area and views are nice. Wait on a Sunday at 4 was an hour but they text you once the table is ready."
Pamela G.,"Daly City, United States",215,9,3,3.0,27/11/2016,"Expect this place to be full and busy during the holidays, weekends and evenings. On a regular day during lunch, expect to wait about 15-30 minutes. My date and I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes on a weekend night. Servers were quick, attentive, and accommodating. The food portions are huge! On the bright side, this restaurant is right in the middle of union square with tons of shops and things to see if you have to wait a long time!"
Wendy M.,"Torrance, United States",42,221,345,3.0,25/11/2016,"the food is ok, decent, had the clam chowder and their bread basket is actually good!  Hamburger and fries were good, juicy and perfectly cooked medium rare.  Spaghetti Carbonara was good too.  This place sitting outside at night was perfect, heaters and best view of union square"
Rey G.,"Diamond Bar, United States",1,15,,3.0,21/11/2016,Classic place to go to if you know what you want to eat. A lot of selections for everyone. My favorite is their Eggrolls and Crispy Chicken Costaletta.  Did not have great experience with their customer service especially their Hostess on the night of Nov. 12. Not very welcoming at all!!
Rock T.,"Novato, United States",37,27,,3.0,7/11/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory but I hate going to this place because the workers seem hell  stressed all the time and I feel bad ordering it looks like they are doing a favor to you. Unacceptable. But the food still pretty good. OMG.
Jamie C.,"New York, United States",204,44,63,3.0,2/11/2016,It's okay... the portions are really large here.  I came here to hang it with my mom after shopping around downtown. The service is mediocre. Takes a little while to catch their attention.  They start off giving you some free bread at the table. I like the rye bread.  We ordered the Thai Glazed Salmon over coconut rice (the dinner portion) $19.95. They had a lunch portion for $14.95 but my mom and I aren't heavy eaters so we shared. We still could not finish the whole portion! The meal was pretty good though.  I'd only stop by here if I'm in the area I would stop by. Otherwise there are plenty other spots to try out.
Tim P.,"Turlock, United States",90,1,1,3.0,21/10/2016,Cheesecake slices used to be bigger in the past but now as years gone by they have gotten smaller
Rachel H.,"Santa Cruz, United States",291,84,116,3.0,6/10/2016,"I was really disappointed in this place. The seating took a while, but that was expected. What really pissed me off was that our waiter 1) didn't tell us his name, 2) didn't repeat our order, 3) got our order WRONG, 4) abandoned us to fix the order with 3 other workers.  Food is always the same at any Cheesecake Factory and if you've never been to one, you should try it at least once. I would give the quality of the food 4 stars, but the service knocked it down. We ordered LUNCH SPECIAL meals and he gave us the actual full priced meal when my boyfriend and I are just city tourists tryna save some money but feel fancy at the same time.  We eventually solved it by paying the lunch special price for the full meal which was nice. It just pissed me off that we had to get the attention of two waiters and the manager. All because of one shit waiter."
Orange S.,"San Francisco, United States",19,79,85,3.0,1/10/2016,"Food is good. I ordered Bristo Shrimp Pasta and I like it. Super big portion. But the girl who was our server was very weird. She always disappear, no ask for ""anything elase?"" or ""how was everthing?"". When we asked for checked and I paid her with card, she came back without a pen just put it on our table and gone....... how can I sign? Then I asked another server to borrow her pen to sign the bill and she reply me ""you can use your finger to sign"" seriously?"
Nathan D.,"Los Angeles, United States",52,231,467,3.0,3/9/2016,"Tourist trap, a bit too busy. It's a must try at least once but the wait sucks! It has a great view if you have the time. Great food and accommodating servers but nothing special."
Kristen A.,"El Cajon, United States",0,4,,3.0,30/8/2016,When will Cheesecake Factories across the US get customer service right?  How is it that you invariably have to endure a chaotic 25-75 minute wait in the  obnoxious madness that is the congested waiting area no matter where u go? Poor management across the board. The entrees are passable but what people really go for is are the delectable desserts and the ornate decor.
Sarah B.,"San Francisco, United States",47,10,1,3.0,30/8/2016,"We decided to celebrate my friend's birthday party there on a tuesday evening. The line was very long as always, after an hour waiting we were finally seated! The food was so so, I ordered and eggplant parmesan that is nothing like I had before, not authentic. My biggest disappointment was the fact that we wanted to order a few cheesecakes and they ran out of almost everything.  I'm giving 3 stars for our very agreable and helpful server!"
Scottie B.,"San Francisco, United States",33,62,15,3.0,22/8/2016,"I stand by my statement if you're just visiting: go find a more ""only in SF"" place.  Less of a wait, more ambiance, solid wines etc.  The type of experience you presumably flew out for. But if you've been living here 5 years and your friend really wants to go for his birthday, here's the deal: ==The good== The cheesecake.  So good they really should consider it their main selling point.  Not just keep it in the name, but damn well serve it before anything else.  ""Can I get your cheesecake order?  After that's out I'll come by and see what you'd like for drinks."" The food is decent.  Not ""best dish ever"", but flavorful, varied and in (too?) large portions. The drinks are a good mix.  Nothing amazing, but you should find something here you'd like.  But it'll have a weird twist: eg Moscow mule...with pineapple!  Like your one friend who insists on making up new drinks. The price is decent.  Especially for San Francisco. The service is great.  Servers are incredibly friendly (despite the tsunami of strollers and Fisherman's Wharf apparel), come by frequently, and have solid recs.  And despite the large crowds, we never felt rushed to turnover the table. CakePay.  It's an app, where you can simply pay and leave.  No awkward waiting for the waiter.  And you can check off items and send them to your friends if you want to split the check.  It's super simple, and I sincerely hope they license it for non-Cheesecake Factory places. (yeah, I know OpenTable and Cover exist) ==The bad== Good God the crowds.  No reservations, 25 minute wait for a buzzer, 2+ hours for a table, and a bar that is trying but just too damn small.  I get it, if you're the landlord this is awesome: all these people with nowhere to go and time to kill and sitting at the top of a five-story mall.  Next time I'm paying a TaskRabbit to deal with this. The bar/bathrooms/waiting areas.  These places are understandably minimal, but overtaxed by constant at-capacity. The food.  I know I said ""good"", but it also tries a little too hard on a few dishes.  Each dish was like five flavors.  Avocado + chicken + zesty spices + mayonnaise + mashed potato + ...  My wife claims the corporation is supposedly super innovative at creating and incorporating new dishes, and I believe it.  But sometimes less is more. The ambiance.  Chains are supposed to offer the same value at all locations, so they have to look and feel near-identical at all locations.  But c'mon, you got a killer view.  A few tables have window views, but the overall place feels lifted from the back of a Toledo mall circa 2007. The wine.  Again, a regional snobbery thing, but Sonoma is not far away.  You could have some really great wines on the list.  I was surprised to see only a few local estates (including the Cheesecake Factory Reserve).  There may be distribution issues here, or maybe it's just all in keeping it in the chain."
Jen M.,"Folsom, United States",1,21,,3.0,21/8/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and I had always been a fan of this one. It's crazy busy and the wait can be huge but the view of the city is amazing and normally the service is great. We took my mum here for her birthday and we sat in the bar as the wait was so long and we needed to head to the airport right afterwards. We were not served for over 40 mins so we went to the bar to ask if we could place our order directly here instead. The lady behind the bar was the rudest human being I have EVER had the unfortunate experience of encountering! She simply stated ""no"" and then waved us off with her hands dismissively. I explained we didn't seem to have a server and she told me to get back to my table and zip it (I'm paraphrasing). It wasn't just the lack of help it was the tone. After another 15 mins a lady showed up who apparently believed in the same service model that the chick behind the bar did. She slammed the waters down on the table and then proceeded to wander off again. It went from bad to worse when our food was cold and the wrong order was brought out but I had lost the will to even try to correct it at this stage.  I sent a complaint into the website and never heard anything back. This added the joy of my mothers birthday...all the way from the UK!  This said I went back (under peer pressure) on the weekend of the SF marathon and I reported to the manager the issues I had faced before. He was amazing, he offered to seat us right away and provide 2 free appetizers by way of apology. The lady behind the bar was still there but I actually saw her crack a smile so maybe she just had a bad day previously it's just a shame it tanked my mums birthday."
