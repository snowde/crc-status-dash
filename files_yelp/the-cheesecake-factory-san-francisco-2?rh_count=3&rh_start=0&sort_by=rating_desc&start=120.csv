Kleber M.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,132,180,5.0,15/8/2015,"It's your typical CKF, but 5 stars for location AND ROOFTOP! We love the outdoor open seating area and would wait or leave but won't dine inside:) Always rooftops and high terraces have a nice flirty vibe to them, we love it. Beautiful times everytime there and it overlooks Union Square."
Emmanuel B.,"Madison, United States",278,208,61,5.0,6/8/2015,Must be the best cheesecake factory that I have done in the states. Sure thing you have to wait a lot to get the table and might wait a bit for the food. But my god the view from the outside balcony is stunning !! Right facing the main park of Sf and being on the 17th floor you over look the city. Food is also very yummy with very large portion. You ll be lucky to be still hungry before the famous cheesecake. Try the pasta they are delicious
A D.,"London, United Kingdom",0,58,11,5.0,5/8/2015,"I love this place and always eat here when I visit SF. The food menu has something for everyone. Literally everyone, it's the biggest menu on the planet. And everything I've ever had here is good-to-amazing. If the worst they can do is ""good"", then the place is great. And many things are just delicious, and you can only get them here! Today I had the lettuce wrapped Asian tacos, and boy were they good. Huge! Even though it's formally an appetiser. With two Asian sauces, it was an explosion of flavours. To this I had another starter, the chicken samosas, and WOWSERS these were the best samosas ever. Sooooo good. I had fresh squeezed oj to drink and boy was it fresh. Sitting outside on their terrace can be recommended - for Visitors and Locals alike. The view over Union Square is awesome. So yeah this place is awesome. Service has with no expiration always been great too."
Andrea D.,"Brooklyn, United States",0,11,19,5.0,2/8/2015,The View was amazing! The service Jacqueline gave was outstanding! She worked around all my special needs and produced the best GF/V burger w/ extra sautéed shrooms.
S B.,"San Mateo, United States",1,7,,5.0,7/7/2015,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in a while because I am not usually impressed with the food or service, however I received a gift card and decided to go for it. This particular location was fantastic! The view was amazing and the service was wonderful- both at the bar and at our table. Our server Michael was very helpful and did a great job being attentive even though he was busy. The food was also well done! We ordered a few things to share off the skinnylicious menu and they were fabulous. I will definitely be returning!"
Ann M.,"Portland, United States",1,98,1,5.0,5/7/2015,Mid afternoon seating for 2 in less than 20 minutes.  A proven restaurant for quality food.  I usually get the shrimp platter with fries and cole slaw.   after a 3 hour tour and a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge I was very hungry and this hit the spot.
Michael B.,"Dunedin, Tampa Bay, United States",1,10,13,5.0,2/7/2015,I've been to few cheesecake factories around the country but this is one by far has the best tasting food !!! def going back
Mateus N.,"Detroit, United States",3,12,5,5.0,10/6/2015,Very nice place to take a partner with a cool view! Just be careful to not get a table outside in a windy/cool day of San Francisco. Not so expensive and what you buy it's really worth it the price. You can go there after riding the Cable Car on Powell Street and make your day nicer! Their soups are very good and the hamburgers as well. I like that you can order a small salad as a side instead of fries. Cool staff and awesome decoration inside.
J M.,"San Francisco, United States",4,115,192,5.0,20/5/2015,"I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for many, many years and I'm rarely disappointed. Of course no likes to wait to be seated but it's to be expected, and just points to the popularity of this restaurant.  There are so many menu items that are great, I couldn't list them all. I really like the shrimp scampi and chicken madeira but I also like many others.  I do wish that they would bring back the shrimp club sandwich, a long time favorite.  If you like cheesecake, then obviously you're at the right place.  The choices are huge and decadent.  Sometimes I just get the plain  cheesecake to keep it simple.   Service is usually very good, but occasionally it can be slow.  Still, it's a five star place!"
Carol M.,"American Canyon, United States",8,60,52,5.0,19/5/2015,Had dinner with co-workers and luckily the wait wasn't long. The waitress was super nice and very  patient since we all wanted separate tabs & I know that can be a pain and most of all annoying. But she never made us feel uncomfortable :) all are meals for delicious.
Suvodeep P.,"Mountain View, United States",10,11,1,5.0,18/5/2015,"The cocktails (Mango Crush, Mai Tai) were amazing! Avocado rolls are awesome!"
Joshua W.,"Fargo, United States",0,8,,5.0,9/5/2015,"Amazing food! Must tries are the fish and chips, Americana cheeseburger, and Mac and Cheese Burger! Their burgers are done perfectly the way you ask for them. Also, their fries are good themselves, but ask for their BBQ ranch sauce for dipping-unbelievable! Cheesecake- the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate is a must try! The Caramel Apple Streusel is really good as well! Had great service as well... they get really busy but the servers do a good job."
Addison M.,"Sacramento, United States",1476,395,439,5.0,28/4/2015,This place is amazing the staff is always so friendly and so nice! If you want to sit outside make sure you make a reservation or ask very nicely to see if they have any tables available outside see you can see Union Square and the busy city life from a top Macy's
Stephan Z.,"Buc, France",38,59,33,5.0,23/4/2015,Heavenly cheesecakes. Fast and good service. Really one my the favorites with a rooftopview over unionsquare. Big pies and free drinks.
Serenity A.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",159,40,42,5.0,15/4/2015,"the ambiance alone makes this place worth waiting in line for...downtown city views, drinks appetizers and delicious cheese cake!"
Raymond K.,"Dublin, United States",42,24,,5.0,6/4/2015,I love the cheesecake factory! I have been to many locations and I am always pleased with the good food and service. This location even has a cool view of union square and has a Macy's and Starbucks below it if you go during a busy eating time and need to wait for a table.
Zara Y.,"Sausalito, United States",5,64,4,5.0,4/4/2015,"Amazing view from the rooftop! The food is standard cheesecake factory quality. Giving them 5 stars because I forgot my purse at the restaurant, which contained all my bank cards and multiple forms of ID. I was back in Sausalito before I realized. I called them and they found my purse. I asked them to put it somewhere safe overnight for me. They checked my husband was who he said he was when he went over to pick it up for me the next day.  Thank you, cheesecake factory!"
Mylinh P.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,,5.0,28/3/2015,"This is a very busy place. The wait is about 90 minutes. However, I was able to get some shopping done at Macy's while the kids and hubby enjoyed the view outside on the balcony. Our waiter is Eric Wong, and he was AWSOME. Always come by with a smile. Very accommodate and professional.  Look for him when you there!  He'll make your 90 minutes wait worth it!!!"
Mike C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,43,37,5.0,9/3/2015,"A-must-go experience if you ever travel to San Francisco. I highly recommend you request sitting outside. It's an awesome view of Union Square. Their food selection is too broad to review, but I have to say that if you do go, please don't forget to try their cheesecake. You won't be disappointed."
Dominic F.,"Redwood City, United States",40,12,1,5.0,5/3/2015,If you don't mind a wait. The outside tables are a gem. Never had a bad meal there. My favorite meal is the bistro shrimp pasta.
