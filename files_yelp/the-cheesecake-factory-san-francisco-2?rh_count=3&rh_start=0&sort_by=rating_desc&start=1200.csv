Aaron P.,"San Francisco, United States",36,10,,3.0,21/8/2016,"It's the cheesecake factory. It's the same as any other in the world, but it's always extremely crowded. If you're looking for a familiar restaurant and don't mind a wait, there is nothing wrong with this. If you're willing to try something new, there are better options."
F S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,49,2,3.0,13/8/2016,"Table of 6 arrived at 7pm and waited an hour and 20 minutes to be seated. Food was ok but service was slow, disorganised and inattentive. We had to ask for cutlery, bread plates and napkins - 3 times. I know the place was super busy and the server was apologetic and sweet but it was not good enough."
Kyrie S.,"Newark, United States",470,170,97,3.0,12/8/2016,"Located on the top floor of the Macy's across from Union Square, this Cheesecake Factory is just like all the others with the spectacular food and the bustling, yet ambient atmosphere. However,  what makes this one in particular unique is the incredible view of Union Square and the other FiDi buildings you get from their outdoor patio!  Dining from this height will make the experience feel much more grand and special, if you're willing to deal with the wait and the outdoor elements of wind, sun, and random pigeons. Indoor seating is just as exceptional though, and while the wait time will vary in length, the speed and quality of service I've always received here is superb.  I ultimately give this one 3 stars however because of the lack of waiting space and seating in their foyer (their front desk and cheesecake glass case is hard to access with all the people waiting around), and the small elevator used to get all the way up here. The elevator is always crowded and operates slowly every time we come here, forcing us to tediously ride the escalators all the way up. Overall I think my main problem here is accessiblity and openness of the location. Nonetheless, the food is always delicious, and whether or not you're staying to dine here, definitely stop by just to see the view too!"
Dustin P.,"Sacramento, United States",22,52,1,3.0,23/7/2016,"Busy, non attentive service, unorganized.  We sat for at least ten minutes before anyone came to ask for drinks or water.  Keep your section organized."
Laura B.,"Evanston, United States",124,5,,3.0,17/7/2016,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory before and know they don't have the best service, however this Cheesecake Factory has the worst I've seen so far. After an hour of waiting we finally got a table and some bread. We didn't have silverware and asked for it 3 times, 20 minutes later our food got there. The manager took the time to walk up to our table and say he was sorry for the delay. HE DIDN'T BRING US SILVERWARE THOUGH. After asking for it again we finally got it. Clearly not the best service."
Daniel P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,2,3.0,16/7/2016,"Good food! Avoid Saturdays when you'll wait too long for a table snd service delay. Keep traditional, it is the best cheesecake."
Wendy L.,"San Francisco, United States",9,100,596,3.0,16/6/2016,Haven't come here for a long time! We ordered the following: -Ahi Tartare (Tasted OK but there are only a few little tiny pieces Ahi Tuna) $7.95 -Meat Loaf (lunch factory / Tasted OK) $13.50 (Make sure to ask for more sauce) -Pasta Da Vinvi (lunch factory / Tasted OK) $13.95 *Friendly Server
Danae L.,"Fremont, United States",360,430,79,3.0,24/5/2016,"I was hoping for a cocktail tonight but my bf didn't want to be at a bar so we agreed on Cheesecake Factory. We had to wait roughly 20-30 minutes for a table, not bad at all! I had a strawberry martinis while he had a Long Island. We shared the crispy crab cake that came in an order of 3. Not bad, really crispy! He opt for the habachi steak while I had steak Diane. Mine wasn't as juicy and the mashed potatoes were somewhat salty.  Received a cheesecake for my birthday, yay!"
Jose M.,"San Ramon, United States",5,36,26,3.0,24/5/2016,"Problems for THIS specific location. No happy hour, 1st off. 2ndly, hostess at the front desk was really in her own world, tapping away at the screen with her Long nails, which honestly isn't allowed in Any California food franchise no matter if your working up front or in the kitchen. But I digress, she wasn't a paying attention to anyone waiting in line, and she was fake-nice, you can tell who those types of people are. long sorry short it's NOT a good place for service, you need to come prepared to order everything all at once because there is no good service here. Surprisingly food was normal as always."
Lynn P.,"San Francisco, United States",9,53,43,3.0,21/5/2016,"The wait on a Saturday night is long. It took 45 minutes to seat a party of 2. it's actually not that bad since they gave us a buzzer, and we just browse around at Macy's until we get seated. Food takes long to arrive and since they all arrived at once, our fries was cold."
Cali L.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,3,,3.0,3/5/2016,"Went with my family on a weekend dinner, the wait time was 45 minutes. Three stars for the ambience and the service. The food including the cheesecake which I had for dessert was mediocre. A good dinner for two would set you back by $100,so definitely not worth the price."
M R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,36,,3.0,19/4/2016,"Quite possibly the best Cheesecake Factory location, because of the lucky architecture and Union Square spot/view. The best visuals, aside from The Rainforest Cafe. Not bad music at all. I have received great waitressing. I like the food. Extensive menu. Everything but like sushi. Bad side is always busy. Seems a bit pricey. PS They like to make you wait. Garlic noodles were supposed to be like 12. By the time tax and other hidden extra charges hit (I was NOT told shrimp costs extra) it was like 20. You got your stupid tip. You happy now? Chocolate shake was light colored so you could tell there was hardly any chocolate in, more like syrup. Ordering to go never took so long. I figured if you don't order in, You DON'T GET SERVICE! By the time I got it I'm like, are you sure this is how it was supposed to taste? Cause it was melting. But it was good. Tasted like it was malted or something. But it was also a seven dollars or up. That's nearly ten dollars for a beverage that was ordered *to go.* Maybe the fact that there's no wi fi is good and for a reason."
Da X.,"San Leandro, United States",201,236,105,3.0,3/4/2016,"Pros: Nice view if you get a balcony seat. Huge cheesecake selection (duh?) Cons: Long lines Average food ""Meh"" prices This is a good place to take a bf/gf or a tourist stop. If you live in the bay area, there are much better places to go for food. Idk about cheesecake but I'm sure there are better places, although the cheesecake here is good."
Judy H.,"Oakland, United States",105,51,59,3.0,31/3/2016,"I come here more often than I like to admit. I generally order from the take-out counter but once in a while I'll eat there. Whenever I do dine in, the service is okay.  But the take-out counter is a hit or miss depending on who is working there. Sometimes the person is completely clueless as to what you're trying to order, and other times they're fast and efficient. The general wait time for my food lasts from 20-50 minutes depending on whether the person at the counter feels like getting my food (I can see it sitting there on their kitchen counter and I just want to go grab it myself)  My general go to is the Chicken Madeira. My boyfriend likes the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. The food tastes more or less the same as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It's pretty overpriced but the portions are okay.   The cheesecakes are okay. I like trying the different flavors. If I had to only stick to one it'd probably be the red velvet or the tuxedo."
Ying D.,"San Francisco, United States",1,7,13,3.0,27/3/2016,"Ok food with fare price , don't expect much about the service."
Keith H.,"Oakland, United States",263,375,568,3.0,29/2/2016,"A friend of mine was visiting town and staying right in the thick of things near Powell St.  I was somewhat stumped on places we could try that were not in the mall or potentially a chain restaurant, but after a visit to Kin Khao was unsuccessful (guess I should make sure it's open next the time I try to visit), we ended up at The Cheescake Factory.  Located on top of Macy's, this location definitely seemed like a popular option on a Saturday afternoon. The highlight definitely was the definitely the patio seating, which gives you a nice view of downtown San Francisco.  Given the nice weather, we decided to wait for the outdoor seating, and it only took about 15 minutes before we got a table.  I was a bit sketched out given the amount of pigeon activity out there, but we actually were able to eat our meal unmolested by our much maligned bird friends.   Our server was friendly and definitely circulated the tables with skill.  I ordered a Chinese chicken salad, which was what I expected: good if not memorable.  I also tried a virgin pina colada, which was full of the empty calories I was seeking.  As always, The Cheescake Factory has a staggering list of its namesake, but with the salad and the fried zucchini appetizer, both my friend and I were quite satiated.   If you end up visiting after getting some downtown shopping done, definitely get the patio seating (once the weather's permitting)!"
Gina h.,"Fremont, United States",7,16,6,3.0,25/2/2016,"We went here because we had a gift card from some beautiful people, not a place we'd normally go, but seemed like a good family restaurant. It wasn't super great for family as it turned out. It seemed like a ton of people were working but no one quite had their act together, so we waited for a very, very long time even though there were tons of tables and staff. For the quality of the food the prices were way to high in my opinion. The cheesecake is why your going there- in the future I'll go there with girlfriends or my husband, not for dinner, just for dessert. I do want to say we had a first class waiter. He rocked. Wish I remembered his name is give him a shout out. Well he's the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1."
Colleen E.,"Scotts Valley, United States",14,22,2,3.0,6/2/2016,"It was very difficult to get take out from here. Once we got the food out we found that they didn't give us what we ordered despite being correctly charged. The food was good, just not what we ordered. When I called I was on hold for 15 minutes before getting a manager who could process the refund. If you go, just don't get take out!"
Ellen K.,"Chino, United States",171,150,210,3.0,2/2/2016,Service is good but the kitchen is SLOW. Came at lunch hour. I hope they improve during lunch hour here. It took forever for the food to come. Ordered Pizza and chicken wrap. Hmmmmm....
Maria G.,"San Francisco, United States",15,9,1,3.0,1/2/2016,"I love the food and the service in this restaurant. However I feel that this place has a health hazard with all the doves that fly and eat from the tables and walk on the freshly wiped tables and cutlery. In fact we have experienced many times the waiters putting new cutlery in the tables and wiping the table, then 10 minutes bring the new clients in who use that table and cutlery! In the between all the pigeons walked on both cutlery and cloths and I feel that this is very very dirty as doves curry such dangerous diseases! I personally always ask for my table to be wipe as soon as I seat and new cutlery to be provided! I feel it be best if they just wiped and bring the cutlery out after the customer was seated!"
