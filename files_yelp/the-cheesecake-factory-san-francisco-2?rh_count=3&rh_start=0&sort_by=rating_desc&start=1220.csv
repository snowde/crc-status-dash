Jerianne G.,"Daly City, United States",1361,387,719,3.0,26/1/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, in many places. They've all had pretty much the same foods. So my review for this is strictly based on this location. Pros: - Available seating indoors or outdoors (outdoor seating is the best on a sunny day since you'll have a great view of Union Square. It's also gorgeous during the winter, but make sure to wear a warm jacket or sweater since it tends to be pretty cold in SF) - Located on the top floor of Macy's, so you know where to go if you want to walk off that cheesecake after. You're also near a lot of shops along Union Square, which is also pretty neat-o.  - Their cheesecakes, while the same in most locations, are always definitely a pro here. You can have them to-go or dine in and eat em there.  Cons: - Service is definitely a hit or miss, but it all depends on how busy it gets. - Since a lot of tourists and visitors like to come here after a day of exploring Union Square, be prepared to wait for a while.  - The food is standard, but definitely overpriced. - Parking around Union Square is difficult not only because of the price, but because of how packed it gets, as well as the traffic that comes along with being a touristy area. Be prepared to either wait in traffic, or to ask yourself whether or not you'd want to take public transportation.  - THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. Just wanted to let you all know.  You definitely have to try a Cheesecake Factory, at least once in your life. If not here, then elsewhere also."
Jahnysha R.,"Suisun City, United States",0,10,4,3.0,8/1/2016,Starting off my appetizer was horrible ! Chicken samosas were extremely salty to the point my tongue was burning. Therefore I sent them back. Was originally brought out the wrong entree and told to wait and it was then taken and I began to wait yet another 15 minutes for my grilled salmon. Then brought back the same plate which was now not as hot as before of course. So far the best part is my Caesar salad. The food is great even though I have the wrong side dish.  I'm giving three stars due to the ill customer service and the food preparation. The view is amazing and food was up to par if I'm only going off taste.
Chelsea R.,"Pacifica, United States",393,31,1,3.0,1/1/2016,"My family and I come here every year during the holidays... What started off rough was turned around by the right people. We came in today (1/1 at 4pm)  We walked in as a party of 5. We were told they were no longer seating groups larger than 4 together. We were told we would be sat On opposite sides of the restaurant and there was no guarantee that we would even be sitting at the same time. First off- that is completely unacceptable. I understand being busy.. Coming during the holidays you usually wait 3 hours+ it was pleasant to hear of only 70 min wait.. But not on those circumstances..  I don't remember all the names of the employees we interacted with but I will describe it...  The hostess (Latina with pony tail and blue nails) was completely rude. She gave me all kinds of attitude. I was shocked.. I know you are busy but if you can't handle heat as an employee, I suggest not working there!! I didn't feel like dealing with someone acting like an immature child so I asked for the manager..  The manager came over (tall thin blonde) and completely explained the situation.. She was super sweet.. We ended up changing my reservation to 4 people so we could guarantee a table together and then I just grabbed an extra chair.. Thankfully our table was big enough. We made it work.  What completely turned our night around was our awesome waiter, David L. He was fast, attentive, personable, and was busting his ass. He kept his composure the whole time though it was super busy. Like I said, we come every year and he truly made the night for us. He is the best waiter I have ever had. He deserves major kudos... Management please reward him!  Food was good as always!  I am taking off two stars because of the rude hostess.. Thank you again to the manager and especially David L for making our family dinner great!"
Mel P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,80,9,3.0,26/12/2015,"Came here during the xmas season at 6.30pm and was told the wait would be 3.5 hours long.  Thats right, if I got to be seated when they said i would it would be 10pm by the time i get to eat. So we passed and ate somewhere else instead. Oh, and they don't take reservations, so unless you're willing to hang out in Macy's for a really long time then I'd recommend going somewhere else."
Douglas F.,"Tiburon, United States",683,451,294,3.0,26/12/2015,"11:15, been in line since 10:30am and they are 15 minutes late opening. Hope this isn't a reflection of the service we will get today. A line for as far as you can see with no sense of urgency to get the doors open. Poor start to the lunch experience."
J H.,"Berkeley, United States",15,43,127,3.0,26/12/2015,"Lots of random memories here.  Came here two days ago on Christmas Eve.  Love the bustling energy of this place.  It's difficult to get a table right away so I usually end up sitting at the bar.  However, this place can be a bit unorganized .  As we were waiting for the elevator to go up to the restaurant, there was a guard/security guy who kept on yelling at everyone to make sure we understood the long wait; it almost seemed like he didn't want people to go up to the restaurant.  And the restaurant was busy as always.  The location as well as the view of Union Square definitely draws in people.  But management needs to do something about the chaotic ambiance."
Alisa K.,"Honolulu, United States",245,96,392,3.0,12/12/2015,"The food is great, and there is a TON OF SELECTION, especially for cheesecake. Also, the servers are very attentive and friendly.  But its not worth the wait, unless I'm going because I specifically want to eat at cheesecake factory, I feel that there are many much less known but just as good if not better places to eat.  You will have to wait anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half on any night weekday or weekend doesn't matter. There are lots of seating but they are all very close together, a very ""family restaurant"" type of atmosphere.  Foods good though, a little pricey for what it is I think, but usually ends with leftovers so I can't really complain.  Happy Munching~"
Justin Y.,"San Francisco, United States",552,440,486,3.0,6/12/2015,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory, but this location is more of a tourist spot with all of the out of towners eating here. Because of this the wait is ridiculous. For a party of two you can wait 1-2 hours for dinner.  They do take your phone number so you can go shopping and they'll text you prior to your table time. All else aside the food is very good. They have good appetizers, entrees, drinks, and of course cheesecake, but because of the wait I don't think I'll come here too often."

Beth D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,12,,3.0,22/11/2015,"Ok, Cheesecake Factory! Everything's better. Food is much improved over our visit a year ago and service was also much better. It's such a handy location we caved and gave it another shot after swearing we'd never set foot in the place again. After two recent successful visits, we've changed our tune. If you're in the Union Square area, give it a try."
Haana R.,"Somerset, United States",5,23,17,3.0,8/11/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night. Wait was okay. Except after they call your number they make you wait again. Service started off fine. But our server, Penny, went missing. We didn't have bread or napkins and kept bugging another waiter who had other tables to take care of. She didn't even check in to make sure the food was okay. Not to mention our cheesecakes were melty and warm because she didn't get them in a timely fashion. Just a sad experience. Shame bc the view was nice and the food was pretty good."
Chris C.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, United States",18,8,,3.0,30/10/2015,"This was a busy place, but my review score doesn't take that into account. (I swear I've seen people give low scores because of ridiculous reason like having a hard time finding parking). Anyways, the main point is that this place charges too much for mediocre food. Dry steaks and overcooked burgers. My GF ordered a medium rare steak and it turned out so rare, that you coud see Gordon Ramsey memes flowing out from the steak (along with blood). We got them to cook it a bit more. I don't know how they did it, but it turned out pretty dry. The pasta was ok, but it tasted average to me.  The cheesecakes are pretty damn good, but that's the only thing notable about this place (I mean, their cheesecake better to be good or else they better change their name to Dry Ass Steak Factory). I will only come here for the cheesecake from now on (you could get food that is way better for the price elsewhere). Get the lemon raspberry cheesecake, it's a perfect mixture of tart and sweetness in a cheesecake. tl;dr: come here for cheesecakes and nothing else."
Geraldine M.,"Daly City, United States",0,15,5,3.0,15/10/2015,"Friends and I are obsessed w Cheesecake Factory, but the line is NOT worth it. Employees there really try their best to accommodate everyone, but an hour long wait is ridiculous. It's not their fault, CF is the ultimate tourist destination w a beautiful view of Union Square. You're lucky to be seated out there when it's not freezing. Regardless, we always come back for FANTASTIC cheesecake."
Peter P.,"Bakersfield, United States",407,257,2139,3.0,6/10/2015,"Came here with my manager and peers for our first Team Building. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's but none on the 8th floor over looking part of a city as beautiful as San Francisco. The elegance at this particular location does set it apart from others and to me it was the balcony dining that created that separation.       I ordered what they call the Factory Combo which you had a choice of two items. The choices were Steak Diane, Chicken Madiera, Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. I picked the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and its served with mashed potatoes as the side. I requested my steak medium but received a near well done piece of meat. The flavor was sort of bland to me which showcases poor attention to the steak. The Herb Crusted Salmon was a bit dry but the flavor was bursting and popping quite well.       I decided not to order dessert as I'm not a dessert person. But I did have a few Lagunita IPAs which I enjoyed from the draft. I'm used to the bottles and you can taste the difference.       The service was actually excellent by the waiter. He was very attentive but not annoying and seemed to pick the times to question refills.       The reason for the 3 stars is a direct reflection of their food which is why I came here. Poor representation of what I have experienced with other locations."
Xochitl T.,"Oakland, United States",190,82,246,3.0,1/10/2015,"-We came on a Sunday night like around 9 o'clock and it was pretty empty which was a surprise. -The cheesecake factory is pretty good. Ive went to a few different ones but they all taste about the same. I ordered the tomato basil pasta, and it really is light and fresh. The cheese cake factory always give huge portions which is a plus.  -The pasta was good but not great, i like some of the other ones more actually. It had a little too much pasta water in it but that really wasnt a big deal to me. It tastes a lot better though when they come and shred lots of yummy cheese on it! -My friend ordered the louisiana chicken pasta. I liked that one more than mine. Its realllllyy creamy and nice a nice kick to it too. Lots of flavor and the chicken is really good too. The waiter told us that one is really popular so now i see why.   -As for dessert their shit is ALLLWWAAAAYYYYSSSS the bomb. Ive tried quite a few and i do have to say my favorites are the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake!!! As soon as you take a bite , the angels begin to sing. The Reeses pb one is another favorite of mine too. Overall its not bad but its not amazing. Some days we just come for dessert!"
Alyssa B.,"Elk Grove, United States",194,75,12,3.0,19/9/2015,"Food is great as always, ate on the balcony so the view was just amazing!  A few things that bother me is that it would be nice if they had more seating in the waiting area because obviously this place gets really busy and standing for a long period of time can be annoying.  They need more employees at the front because it was SO busy and there was only 1 person in front trying to help 10 people at once. And I know how much pressure it is. I felt bad for her. Especially since once the buzzer goes off, we still have to wait an additional 5-10 minutes because there's not enough people to help. There was maybe 5 other groups waiting to be seated after their buzzer going off.  We got seated, waitress was really friendly. I asked for water with lemon, she forgot, but no biggie. She was great overall and checked up on us when needed.  I would MAYBE come here again, depending on the day and how many people I'm with. Wait is obviously much longer with a bigger group."
Carlyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",8,90,76,3.0,7/9/2015,"Great view of Union Square from the patio. These people work really hard as this place is always a crowd favorite in every city.  We visited the restaurant to celebrate a birthday and there was an hour wait to be expected. The restaurant was bustling with people in and out, waiting in the crowded lobby, on the patio and the bathroom was constantly crowded. That women's restroom could use some help and extra cleaning and stocking especially on a weekend. Two of the three faucets were not working, a stall out of toilet paper then the stall next to it a mess. There was even a little dog peeing on the floor. The owner wiped up after it but rather gross in a restaurant.   The portions are still as large as ever but healthy and smaller lunch portions are offered now. My fav shrimp avocado bacon sandwich is no longer in the menu but they offered to make one. Instead of the French roll it came as a fat high club sandwich impossible to eat unless you deconstruct it.   The fries were not as tasty and skinny was they used to be but the view and company were worth it."
Yaron T.,"Brookline, United States",16,13,1,3.0,6/9/2015,Disappointing experience. Very long wait until seated and then for the drinks and food. Very noisy to a level it has become unpleasant. My burrito grande was less than average. My wife's fish taco's was also average. It's not what it used to be.
Suzannae L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,3/9/2015,"I love cheesecake, but I think it's a better idea to order to go rather than dine here eating cheesecake. The Cheesecake, especially the Godiva cheesecake is very sweet, and it's hard to finish it all in one sitting. Other than that, all the staff are very friendly and welcoming."
Evelyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",167,15,11,3.0,25/8/2015,"Be prepared to experience long wait times for ANYTHING: waiting for a table, waiting for bread, your food, and the check.  Service can make or break your experience. I've often felt ignored by waiters in favor of older or wealthier looking patrons (college-aged here), which gets pretty irritating.  Food is up to par with other Cheesecake Factory locations. I will continue to return for the complimentary bread and tasty food , but certainly can not expect great service at this location."
