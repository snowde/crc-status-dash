Nizar S.,"San Francisco, United States",50,11,7,3.0,23/8/2015,"There are truly two very distinct experiences at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory; Before you take your seat, and after - and don't be surprised if your pre-seating experience is the one that is significantly longer. Once you're seated, you're often greeted by some of the best waiting staff I have interacted with in the city. The food is surprisingly good with many options at decent prices considering the location - although the cheesecakes are about 30% more expensive than other locations at about $10 per slice (which you forget about one bite in - I recommend the Tuxedo). However, I reeeeeeally don't think it's worth the trip if you ask me. As you come in, a typical wait is 45-90 minutes. The hosting staff is nowhere near as pleasant as the waiters, and the approximate waiting times you get are often off. There are no reservations, and very clear inefficiencies. For example, if you decide to take a cheesecake to-go and not wait to be seated, the person taking your order at the very under-utilized takeout counter would not be responsible for putting it in a box for you to get going, although they are literally standing in front of the cake fridge, and yes, you end up with a 20 minute wait as your cake enters the restaurant queue while the two cashiers sit there and gossip. I hope they take care of these inefficiencies, because otherwise this is a pretty neat spot. In the mean time - do you REALLY want to wait at Macy's furniture department pretending to be testing beds and couches until that buzzer rings?"
Ruthe Ann G.,"El Cerrito, United States",49,193,17,3.0,21/8/2015,"I came here last monday (aug.17th,2015) with some friends that were visiting from Texas. I will say for a monday night it was really crowded!! We called in seeing if we could put our name in or make a reservation, they simply told us we could do neither because they do not do that. We said okay, went there to wait. It was a 45 minute wait for inside and 5-10 for outside. It was pretty chilly out but they promised it would be comfortable because of the heaters they have out there. My friends have a 3 year old and I have to say, it was pretty chilling unless you were right underneath that heater! It wasnt comfortable, so i took a star off that. The food was okay, nothing special at all. THe service was sucky! It took us two hours for 3 meals to get served and eaten. it was a long dinner! Too long especially for a three year old, so i took another star off of that which leave 3/5 stars. I would not necessarily say i would go back but the smores galore cheesecake was good!"
Gabriele J.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",1375,870,2315,3.0,15/8/2015,"Maybe I should have come for the actual cheesecake, but when I dropped by I was actually looking for breakfast. We came in and quite immediatelly someone was welcoming us and asking where we would like to sit. Since there were tables available inside the restaurant, we just went with that option instead of waiting for a spot at the nicer outside area.  There were so many things on the menu that I felt a bit dizzy. Since I just could not decide on anything cause it felt like hard work going through all of the options listed, I just picked the ""sunday brunch combo"", which consisted in scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes. I asked if they could add some strawberries to the mix and the very nice waiter gladly agreed. I also had some fresh squeezed orange juice. I was pretty unimpressed with my plate. The scrambled eggs were not really scrambled, and if it were not for the strawberries, this would be a pretty poor-looking meal for quite a high price. The juice was nice, the pancakes were nice, but when the bill came and I realized I had just spent almost 40 USD on a pretty sleazy breakfast I felt kind of dumb. I'd probably come back if I had to, since the menu is so large and the staff is so nice, but I feel like this is more of a tourist trap than anything else."
Carlos L.,"Norwalk, United States",2,2,,3.0,8/8/2015,The food is good but the this place is very dirty. My girlfriend's glass was dirty with hard crusty food. I received ice with black stuff in it.
Janwillem S.,"Brussels, Belgium",0,12,4,3.0,2/8/2015,"I had an 'eggplant parmesan': fried slices of eggplant with tomato sauce and green pasta. It was a strange dish, not what I expected, and below average quality. The prices were reasonable.  Staff was friendly and responsive.  I had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated outside, on a Sunday at noon. This was told as soon as I entered.  The Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor, and has an amazing view over Union Square."
Eric L.,"San Francisco, United States",198,9,8,3.0,31/7/2015,Pros: The view is astounding from the balcony. It oversees Union Square is absolutely beautiful at night. Cons: The wait was an hour long. So be prepared to wait a very long time. The food was relatively mediocre. I was not overly impressed by the quality.
Eric M.,"San Francisco, United States",118,38,,3.0,28/7/2015,"First off, I love the Cheesecake Factory! It has great food and, of course, amazing cheesecake. I can't help but always think about the Big Bang Theory when I go eat there. Also, for LOTR fans out there, the thin column looking pieces in between tables seem to resemble the tower of Sauron. All geekiness aside, let's get down to the reason why I only gave this place 3 stars when I said how much I love the food. One word: Tourists. Because this place happens to be smack dab in the middle of tourist central, the restaurant is constantly busy and extremely over packed by people. Do expect to wait 30 to an 1hr for a table. The restaurant is located at the top of Macy's, so if you do get a seat outside, you'll get a great view of Union Square. It's unfortunate that I have to get the place 3 stars, but I'm not a big fan of crowds and super long waits. Definitely go there and enjoy the food, though."
Marlon P.,"San Francisco, United States",1,11,3,3.0,26/7/2015,"We had brunch here so we could use a gift card that we've had for two years. The food is okay but the service was very slow, although our waitress was very nice and polite. Also, it's always packed with tourists and the wait is always long. We waited 35 minutes. Our brunch basically became our early dinner. Their menu is so over-the-top with a gazillion items. Menus like that drive me crazy! Â Anyway, I had the crispy fish tacos and he had a ""healthy"" salad topped with grilled steak. I have to say the food was good; nothing special but good. Our food took a while to arrive and our orders were served a few minutes apart. Service was so slow we didn't have time to order some cheesecake. It was disappointing. Being a San Francisco native, it's not the type of place I would go to regularly. If I was doing some heavy shopping downtown and I was famished, I would probably give it another try only because I haven't had their cheesecake yet. One final thing. The decor is very cheesey. No pun intended. It's hard to tell what the theme or motif is but it could use a facelift. The Terrace seating overlooking Union Square is a very nice feature."
Alexa W.,"Oakland, United States",142,235,332,3.0,2/7/2015,"I must admit, I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory in my life. It just never came up. Neither have I been to an Olive Garden. I might have to remedy that soon, so I can be part of the bashing ;-) Anyway, I came here, because a friend works close by and asked to meet me there. I didn't even know Macy's has a seventh floor. Let alone a secret escalator from its seventh floor up to the ""Factory"". So I came with low expectations, knowing this is a chain that has high caloric foods and is very popular among teens and tourists.  We met at 4:30 pm and my friend had already put her name down. We waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. Thankfully, we were seated outside right at the edge of the balcony with view of Union Square. Really nice! The waitress was very friendly, offered bread (which we refused) and came back after she saw we had wrestled down the huuuuge menu. I wasn't really super hungry, so I opted for something small and fried instead of large and healthy (weird logic, I know). So I got little potato balls filled with cheese and bacon and a sour cream dip... an appetizer that was more than a normal person would eat as a whole meal. My friend got a pizza, which was regular sized. Both dishes were surprisingly good. I saw a lot of other fried things, but also salads, fish etc. on other tables, it all looked appetizing.  We skipepd the dessert, but took a look at the cake counter. Man, those pieces were ginormous! I would have loved to take one home, to see what the fuss is all about, but didn't want to drag cake through SF on my shopping tour, so I didn't. The prices are ok, I guess. For the amount of food you get, the nice view, the service.  I would come back if somebody wanted to absolutely go. It's not fine dining, it's not healthy, but it's good."
Brooke D.,"Luxembourg, Paris, France",208,164,313,3.0,28/6/2015,"We went on Pride weekend and it was packed. I ordered a dirty goose, pretzel crusted chicken and ahi tuna. The pretzel crusted chicken was good, and would recommend it as an appetizer. The ahi tuna had almost no tuna and was all avocado. Steer clear! The service was great. It's one of the better chain restaurants."
Inge C.,"San Francisco, United States",242,109,325,3.0,26/6/2015,"Cheesecake factory in the heart of San Francisco! They're located on the roof of Macy's so the view is fantastic! Definitely sit on their outside patio during Christmas season. You get the beautiful view of Union Square!! However, you need to brace yourself for the wait of eternity. This Cheesecake Factory is a popular demand for both locals and visitors, and the wait can get pretty crazy. Because they have so many customers, they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. Their food are pretty good, I definitely recommend their listing of pasta and Specialty of Steak Diane. And for appetizer, their must haves are the Avocado Eggrolls and Crab rangoon! I strongly do not suggest you get their alcohol drinks from here because well.. They triple if not, quadruple the original market price. So I dont think it's worth getting. Get drunk some place else. Service depends on their busyness .. Some waitress can get so overwhelmed and take the wrong orders from you. But they have good service in general. Just understand that they get so busy all the time. Cheers!!"
Charles Y.,"Berkeley, United States",142,277,6,3.0,18/6/2015,not bad but I came here after I got a cavity filled so it was sensitive to sweet and I got the cheesecake with Reeses and snickers and butterfinger and stuff and it hurt my tooth a lot and it hurt for hours so they shoulda taken that into account smh
Dahlia Y.,"Pasadena, United States",271,218,1239,3.0,9/6/2015,"This is downtown SF, union square to be more specific. Everyone comes here for the view. I visited on a Saturday evening, it was crowded making it impossible to walk. But I just had to had those amazing Mac n cheese balls.  They told us there was an 1 hour wait but it only took 35 mins. The servers where nice attentive and friendly. The food took 20 mins. Don't go starving here or you might faint :-/. The food was warm and tasty. My table was outside and the most uncomfortable of sitting in an outside area on the 8th floor are the possibilities of a bird sitting on your plate, yes your plate. This Â happened to the table across us, soon they had 2 birds on the table. While it was funny to watch I know it was very unpleasant for those guest.  The other great things about this location: -close to the ferry that takes you all the way down through down town. Pretty pricey.  - you get to go shopping. While you walk you burn all the calories you just ate.  If I visit SF I would definitely go back. Just remember bring lots and lots of patience."
Cathy U.,"San Jose, United States",6,142,22,3.0,3/6/2015,"5 STARS: I'm a big fan of casual spots that have a great view- and I come here for the outdoor seating that overlooks union Square. Â The tables are far apart enough where you can have a private conversation while also getting the energy of a vibrant atmosphere. 1 STAR: The 1 hour wait, even in the middle of the week. Â No reservations allowed. 3 STAR: Over priced, but good food.

L. L.,"Berkeley, United States",0,41,,3.0,26/5/2015,"Good when you're the tour guide. Good place to rest after showing friends around Union Square. Great if you have kids or teenagers with a sweet tooth. Surprisingly Willy-Wonka-esque interior, and nice outdoor terrace with a view. Food is o.k., best for (obviously) dessert or cocktails. Service on the slow side.  If I'm hungry, I'd rather go to Lefty's for pastrami, or Le Colonial for dinner."
Nancy S.,"Los Angeles, United States",675,235,558,3.0,18/5/2015,"The usual Cheesecake Factory food and atmosphere with a pretty awesome view of the city! On the rooftop of Macy's, you can catch a beautiful bird-eye view"
Joshua W.,"Beaverton, United States",44,36,244,3.0,5/5/2015,"The location and view is what makes this place. Everything else is typical CF though. Good food, drinks and cheesecake obviously. If you don't want to venture out into the city for new food experiences, this is a good place. Can't beat Anchor Steam on tap, but we are in SF."
Sampad D.,"Reston, United States",168,723,401,3.0,4/5/2015,Its a usual restaurant. The best part of this particular place is the view of Union Square.Great view of the city skyline.
Nishad J.,"Cupertino, United States",417,193,452,3.0,27/4/2015,"Great view of the city skyline. That's basically what you're paying for! Great staff! Really friendly and accommodating(seated us outside close to a heater and took some great pictures for us)!  Wish they had a dedicated separate vegetarian menu/more options in general for the Non-Carnivores! I ended up getting Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which was really very bland and boring. Â The mango key-lime cheesecake, on the other hand, was great!! In conclusion worth coming for the views and the cheesecake!"
Ally M.,"Berkeley, United States",3,289,95,3.0,8/3/2015,"I've always wanted to go to a Cheesecake Factory, because where I'm originally from, there was no close location. I was surprised that the atmosphere was a somewhat fancy one - I wasn't dressed for that!  The service was great, but the food was only mediocre. The food has lots and lots of calories, but sometimes the taste is not worth the hundreds of calories you consume! Of course, I can't say this with the desserts.  I think I won't be needing to go to cheesecake anymore."
