Jacky F.,"Oakland, United States",9,13,5,3.0,23/2/2015,"Second time here and was disappointed. After waiting 45 mins to sit, the waiter forgot to out our order in!!! So we had to wait over an hr to get our food! To make up for it they offered us a complementary salad (mixed greens). By the time we got out food we were semi full! I ordered the shrimp scampi and steak diane, which was a bust! Usually shrimp scampi come with angel pasta and this one had no pasta and the steak was flavorless. My boyfriends burger was deeelish though!"
Kaylin C.,"Wailuku, United States",118,87,178,3.0,21/2/2015,"Food is very good. Service is good as well. Nothing too wonderful. It's a place to try but nothing wonderful. The best part is that there are SO MANY menu options. And the view is awesome on the outside top floor patio, go early. There can be a long wait"
Sammie G.,"Albany, United States",0,16,,3.0,17/1/2015,"Beautiful environment, but service and food deemed otherwise. Our waiter was very nice, but we had like five different people help us so I honestly didn't know who to direct my questions and requests to.  Also, kitchen must have been very far from our table as every time we asked for a condiment it took several minutes to get back to our table, something i have yet to experience at other dining establishments.  I do however need to reiterate that the customer service was very kind and welcoming, however, management might not be up to par considering extremely long wait times for dining amenities. Also, pricing for particular dishes (especially) burgers and alcohol related drinks were marked up to the extreme, as the burger I had was subpar yet costed me a hefty ten dollars-eleven dollars.  Seek this place out if you are looking to be visually pleased by gorgeous architecture and desire a very crowded environment, however, seek other options if you would like to really experience a plethora of different dining options."
Janine R.,"Sacramento, United States",5,19,13,3.0,4/1/2015,"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory then you know what to expect. It's your typical run of the mill chain establishment albeit a bit more upscale with a myriad of menu options. This one in San Francisco however, offers that city by the bay nostalgia. The outdoor balcony offers an excellent ambience, especially in the winter when you can overlook Union Square's beautiful and massive Christmas tree and the ice skating mishaps. The heat lamps help keep the cold at bay, but if that doesn't keep you warm there's a variety of alcoholic beverages on the drink menu to warm you up and put some hair on your chest.  The only reason why I've given this one 3 stars is because you can never eat here without at least a 45 minute wait for indoor or outdoor seating. Also, the bar ran out of Asian pear martinis, Mai Tais, and Moscow Mules. Really, 0 for 3!?!  If your in a hurry and it doesn't mean that much to you to sit outside, it's best to wait near the bar and grab a seat once one becomes available.  Overall, I always enjoy the food, and like the fact that the menu offers enough options so that I can always try something different."
Vin Z.,"New York, United States",0,60,43,3.0,24/12/2014,The food is always good. Miss the wasabi tuna entree. The wait is always long & the bar area is not large enough to accommodate the large crowds & long wait. Hopefully bathrooms are cleaner tonite than usual.
Katya O.,"San Francisco, United States",466,52,64,3.0,22/12/2014,"So I'm not sure why this place is always so packed. I mean they have some good items for sure but with so many choices in the city whyy do people seems to always be drawn to this place?  Anyway my boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night around 5 o'clock and the wait was about 20 minutes. The waitress servicing us was very friendly and responsive. We ordered the tuna tartare (yum!), the spicy jambalaya pasta and banana cheesecake. DO NOT get the jambalaya pasta here, idk my boyfriend was raving about it but even he said that it wasn't very good at this location. The noodles were over cooked, the chicken had zero flavor and contrary to its name, it is not even remotely pasta.  I really did enjoy the banana cheesecake though. I am glad they got their desserts down since the place is called the Cheesecake factory :)."
Tom D.,"Angels Camp, United States",32,25,15,3.0,16/12/2014,"The food and service was really good here,  The drawback is the super long wait.  I do not mind waiting if we can sit or even have a cocktail or beverage to enjoy the time.  The bar and seating is unattainable and it is very challenging to get a chair or table while you wait. It was even impossible to walk to the bar to try to purchase any beverage.  If you like super crowded places and standing around to wait for a table this place is good.  Again I have to say once you sit down the experience is good."
G ..,"Austin, United States",222,54,,3.0,5/12/2014,"Do you strive to push your gastronomical limits? I know I do. This is why I choose to dine at Cheesecake Factory. Your overpriced meal may seem excessive, but really they're giving you a portion that could feed a family of four, so you're definitely getting your value. Keep in mind that creating a four person portion is not the same as creating just one, so it will take four times the amount of time to have your food carried to your table by a server dressed in a uniform similar to that of a mental hospital nurse. One of my goals is to someday be able to say ""I TOO have diabetes"" which is why I love to visit Cheesecake Factory every chance I get."
Janet T.,"San Mateo, United States",3279,189,1,3.0,29/11/2014,"Arrived with my two friends.....WHY they don't accept reservations is beyond me. Put our name in at 4:30 and OF COURSE there was a huge wait.  They gave us a pager, we went window shopping & visited. Ultimately we sat down INSIDE at about 7:00pm. The Tree is 83 feet and the lighting was just BEAUTIFUL. Totally. Cheesecake Factory has the perfect location, breathtaking view overlooking Union Square & inside Macys. We started with a cocktail. I had a cosmopolitan and the girls had mojitos. For apps we had the Avocado Egg Rolls (not as good as BJ's) and the Thai Lettuce Wraps (too spicy for me). For mains I had the Shrimp Scampi w/Angel Hair Pasta which was yummy.  Shrimps were tender. My friends had Fresh Grilled Salmon dish & the Hibachi Steak. They said they each enjoyed their meal. For dessert, we each ordered a Tiramisu Cheesecake to take home. Needless to say, the place was PACKED and seating was cramped. Service was semi OK, under the conditions. The CF is a little pricey. The food is mediocre at best. Your paying for the Ambience. Would I come back? Maybe next year, for another Tree Lighting."
Stephanie A.,"Sunnyvale, United States",592,398,249,3.0,18/11/2014,"I usually try to stay away from the Cheesecake Factory since they serve an obscenely high calorie food that I can't resist. It is also always an impossible mission to get s sit in any of their restaurants without spending an obscene amount of time waiting in line. I think it is their strategy to create the line even if there are open tables to make the impression they are always so busy and in demand.  Once inside almost anything in the menu will be a crowed pleasure and you are sure to enjoy your chosen dish as long as you don't count it's calories, or if you promise yourself to run a marathon the next day ( or before ?) This branch is no different. The service is good the food didn't fail as well. The location on Macy's rooftop above union square is a type A location which is hard to beat. I don't like the inside, it is too loud and s bit darkish so we set outside under one of the Heaters. In the cold nights of SF even two heaters from both sides couldn't help to keep us warm. Bring your coat, hat, and scarf.  The kids are always psyched about the climb through Macy's different flours, and even more ecstatic about the elevator ride. Then they are truly out of their mind because of the union square view below, and the near by buildings.  I hate it that they made us wait in line for twenty minutes although we asked to sit outside and more than half the tables outside were empty, clean, and ready to accommodate diners. A server approached us fast and took our order( we had plenty of time while waiting to choose from the menu), five minutes later he came to tell us his shift has ended and we will have a new server taking care of us. He didn't tell the new server about our special requests ( to leave the decorative seasoning out of the plate, to bring the salad dressing on the side, to split one of the dishes) and as s result almost everything came out wrong. I don't understand why a server that knows his shift ends takes an order. It was very upsetting to send the plates back to the kitchen and again wait for our food. It pretty much killed our dinner. By the time we began eating we were too hungry, upset and too frozen. We didn't stay for dessert but chose to buy sweets at the excellent sweet shop a few floors below."
Gaby B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,17/11/2014,Clean your tables before people is going to eat a dessert is no nice eat cheescake dessert witn dearty table :(
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, United States",231,315,569,3.0,17/11/2014,"The three star is really on point for this place unfortunately.  First things first, be aware of the wait times, don't come in during the weekend expecting to get seated right away, it's in one of the busiest areas of SF.  Parking can be a hassle, but there's parking across the street or down a few blocks near Westfield Mall that may be even cheaper. If you're here with friends or on a date do a combined Cheesecake factory and go ice skating. Ice skating gets a bit packed, but lots of photo-ops in the square itself!  From the start if you're here at night get a seat outside and enjoy the view from down below it's amazing!  If you're a tourist, double dating, going on a date, or just enjoying Union Square come here.  I came here with my boyfriend and a girlfriend of mine with her boy. If you're in a group it's a great atmosphere to be in. Unfortunately the wait is long if you come during the weekend.  We came on a Friday night and knew from the get go it would be at least an hour wait.  It seems after about 6:30, the wait gets longer than an hour.  My boyfriend and I got there earlier than my girlfriend and her guy so we were going to put our name in at 6 but the wait was only about 30 minutes so we waited since we weren't sure if our friends would be there in 30 min, came back 30 minutes later and had a 75 minute wait. Yikes!  Regardless, we chatted downstairs in the furniture section (very smartly placed for people to sit down and relax while waiting forever).  Our waitress was nice.  Very personable which probably comes from serving people who come from all over the country to this place.   Unfortunately for my group our food wasn't that great for some reason.  It seems my girlfriend and her guy's food was fine (pastas and appetizers), but my boyfriend's food was cold. I don't mean a little warm, lukewarm--it was cold. Eating a cold Steak Diane is not very appealing.  His mushrooms in his dish were cold as well, as if the dish had been waiting there forever. Even our coffee was cold as well, I was able to drink it through the tiny straw in huge gulps because it was literally lukewarm--chilly.  It seemed that as nice as our waitress was to us she was nice to all her customers, which kind of leads me to assume she probably left our food waiting on the counter for a little too long considering how long it took our food to eat.  The whole experience was about 2 and a half hours so it took quite a while. The macaroni cheese balls were okay, a little too much cream for me.  Crab cakes were yummy, coffee would have been better if it was actually hot and not awkwardly lukewarm.   The lemon meringue cheesecake was good though. I'd be pretty upset if I didn't enjoy the cheesecake considering I'm at the cheesecake factory.  Overall the experience was enjoyable for the company, but our food was meh. It seems the busier they get the less organized they are with food preparation. I read other reviews about food being a hit or miss, so just be careful."
Kate B.,"Mission Viejo, United States",0,8,,3.0,10/11/2014,The food was delish! I had the Miso Salmon and my friend ordered Chicken Madera. I love all the food at the CF. Trying to get a table took over an hour and the waitress was scare and frazzled. Yummy food and mediocre service. Perhaps more staff would be the answer.
Rod H.,"Somerville, United States",21,11,4,3.0,9/11/2014,"Food: As tasty as you remember at your neighborhood Cheesecake Factory. The Jumbalaya Pasta dish is stupendous. Spicy, but not so spicy that your heat averse partner will not be able to tolerate a taste. The atmosphere: An exceedingly cool location propped atop the tall Macy's building in downtown SF. In the Fall/Winter you can gaze down on the ice skaters in Union Square. Reserving a table: Chaos! Send someone along early to put your name in, especially on a Saturday night. Wait times can exceed 90 minutes to 2 hours! There is virtually no place to wait around near the front desk and it is a free for all to get to the desk to even put in your reservation. Once you make it to the desk you can give them your cell number and they will text you when your table is ready."
Radoslaw D.,"Gdańsk, Poland",101,84,4,3.0,6/10/2014,Nice venue worth going just for the view. Food is ok too but nothing exceptional. Waiting time is ridiculously long.
Richard R.,"Santa Barbara, United States",2,10,5,3.0,5/10/2014,Honestly went there for the view. Food is okay food is okay. Dessert is outstanding. Great place to take the family to eat.
Julie N.,"San Francisco, United States",170,415,933,3.0,28/9/2014,"Havent been to this cheesecake factory for many years and its actually my First time sitting at the bar area. The bar was crowded since there was a giants game but manage to get a seat. It took the bartender a while to get my order since she had so much drinks that she had to made for other customers.  This was what i order: Roadside sliders Mojito White chocolate raspberry cheesecake. The food was good and tasty. The food came out fairly fast since i only order a appetizer and cheesecake. Decent price for the food. For the mojito, it was refreshing and it wasn't overkill by the alcohol. And it was very presentable especially the mint decoration. Cost about $9 or $10. Quite expensive but they give you a big cup.  Every time i come here, the foods are always good, friendly service and always leaving you full."
Lyn B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,22,161,3.0,25/9/2014,"Bought a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go. Unfortunately, the cheesecake is half red velvet and the bottom isn't ""red"" at all, it's brown and not as tasty as last time I had it."
Ali A.,"Santa Barbara, United States",8,5,,3.0,24/9/2014,"+star main course taste (quality is a question though) +star palatable dessert and beverage menus +star location -star crowded, noisy, lineup, delay -star appetizers"
Ryan M.,"Ladera Ranch, United States",45,87,20,3.0,24/9/2014,"6 word review: Good food, great view, LONG WAIT.  Now if you want to see my substantiation for this, read the rest :).  This Cheesecake Factory is very conveniently located near Union Square and Westfield Mall and the Powell Bart station. The restaurant is on top of Macys, you enter through a Macys door and go up an elevator, or you can take the escalators if you want but it takes longer.  So... On to the food. Not much to review here - the portions are as big as any other Cheesecake Factory and the food is consistently as good as any other. The service is also quite good. So for that reason, I'm giving 3-Stars, the same as my other Cheesecake Factory review.  So what makes this restaurant different than other Cheesecake Factories? Well for starters, the view from this restaurant of Union Square if you sit outside at the ledge is awesome at night. It's very pretty looking down at all the people in Union Square. Keep in mind you are 8 floors up. Many people enjoy taking pictures up here with the setting/view in the background and I completely understand why :))). I was one of them, shhhh.  What else makes this one different? THE LINE. This Cheesecake Factory has the longest waits to get a table of any one that I have ever been to. Not because the restaurant is so small, but because there are so many people that patronize it. The wait is consistently 1hour+ EASILY no matter when you get there if it's not abnormally early. Remember, they don't take reservations!  Enjoy!"
