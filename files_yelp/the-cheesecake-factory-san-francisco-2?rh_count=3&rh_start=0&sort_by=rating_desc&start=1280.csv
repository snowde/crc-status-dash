Blacknight J.,"Berkeley, United States",0,13,,3.0,11/9/2014,Waited long to be seated. Got a table outside and enjoyed the moment with my girl friends..but wasn't impressed with food.
Jim S.,"Burbank, United States",1,73,,3.0,24/8/2014,"The food is good, the ambiance is nice, and the people are friendly.   The one issue I had with dinner was the pressure to increase tips.  There is a rather prominent tipping guideline on the receipt, along with a not-so-subtle ""gratuities not included"" message.  When the waitress dropped off the check, she mentioned ""just so you know, the tip is not included"".  Given that the service was average, I tipped the standard amount.  I think it came to 17%.   On the way out, we ran into our waitress.  She had seen the receipt and was rather upfront about it.  I can't remember the exact words, but something like ""I know you guys aren't from here, but I just want to let you know that tips are normally higher in San Francisco because of the cost of living in the city.  Would you like to make any changes?""  I was practically too dumbfounded to speak.  I mean, I know they rely on tips for income (although California mandates minimum wage PLUS tips for staff) but I tipped the normal amount for service that was decent but nothing special.  My friends, one of whom lives in SF, were equally shocked.   We just got out of there ASAP, and probably won't go back."
Christine L.,"Manhattan, United States",2,8,,3.0,22/8/2014,The food is good and so is the cocktail. The service is good as well. But the price is more than it should be. I would recommend to try the cheesecakes and nothing else.
Tracy T.,"San Francisco, United States",736,673,421,3.0,16/8/2014,"Highlights - I can't deny the fact that this Cheesecake Factory location is probably in the most prime location that anyone can ask for.  - At the heart of Union Square, this is the most convenient location if you are tired from shopping and need a bite to eat. Right inside Macy's. How convenient! - Sitting outside is such a treat and highly recommended. The best views of Union Square are directly below and especially a treat during Xmas time, since you can people watch with the ice skating rink smack dab in Union Sq. - I am in love with their wheat bread that they bring to your table as a starter. It comes out warm and so delicious. I'll take two of those, please!  - Avocado Eggrolls: Must order, just trust me! - Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: My all time fav. If you don't eat meat or just want something healthy, this is for you. Loaded with vegetables, pasta al dente, and drizzled with olive oil.   - Cheesecake: Don't skip or be cheap about it. Fresh strawberry is always a great option, but if you are feeling adventurous ask about their special flavor and indulge.  Improvements - Since this is in such a prime location, it's a tourist and local hotspot. At all times of the day, expect a long wait either sitting inside or outside. Even with a party of 2, I've had to wait 45 mins or more.  - Don't expect great service either, there are way too many people to be served and not enough waiters with the time to cater to your needs. I came once and wasn't served or acknowledged at my table until I flagged two other waiters to ask who my waiter was.  Tip - You can call in an order for pick-up if you don't want to wait or don't care about the million dollar view above Union Square.  - Got a date and some time to spare, come here and sit outside. Thank me later! ;)"
Gee L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,3.0,12/8/2014,"The restaurant is on the top floor of macys so it offers a beautiful view of the SF downtown/union square area.  Food was mediocre, and the service seemed very inefficient.  Since they don't take reservations, we had to wait more than 40 min for a table.  It was on a Wednesday night about 6pm."
Christine S.,"San Francisco, United States",1117,1216,4637,3.0,11/8/2014,"Came here with a handful of friends for the 50% off cheesecake deal during National Cheesecake Day. Because it is a hot tourist spot, the place was already packed, and the wait was around 40 minutes at 4pm. I can only imaging what the wait is like during prime dinner time... - Cheesecake: A for Awesome. The slices are big and delicious. And half off means each slice was only $3.75! How people manage to eat a slice for dessert after a meal is beyond me.  - Service: F for Fail. Our server was rude, impatient, and inattentive.  Looking past the outrageous wait times, I guess I wouldn't mind coming back to dine since The Cheesecake Factory does have a breathtaking view of Union Square."
Sebastian P.,"Ceres, United States",1,11,2,3.0,3/8/2014,This place was good. Not the best service lady gave us a mean response at the check in we were there for at least one hour and a half when we were seated the waiters were very nice seem to  be the only  nice workers there. In addition if you sit outside there is a nice view.
Farah Z.,"San Francisco, United States",7,3,,3.0,31/7/2014,"The line is ridiculously long. The counter where they take reservations is always packed and crowded with people who're trying to put down their name. It's not really safe for people to be down there since waitress are trying to bus around. It's madness, but food is good. long wait, but good food."
Alex U.,"Pinole, United States",65,135,13,3.0,25/7/2014,"There's always a LONG wait here but that is because of the location. It's right in the center of Union Square where all the hotels and tourists like to go. I don't think I've ever waited longer than an hour even for large parties of 10 or more. The menu is HUGE and so are the portions for a reasonable price.  A must order is the avocado roll appetizer and the stuffed mushrooms. Very good! I also like the strawberry cheesecake. My only complaint about this place so far is that the last time I was here, which was a week ago there were a few flies around our table. That was kind of gross but nothing to make me stop coming here."
Iris L.,"Newark, United States",0,57,,3.0,20/7/2014,"View is good, cheesecake are delicious, but food is just so so, besides there are always a long long line waiting for seats. Not recommended"
Victoria B.,"Pittsburg, United States",0,79,43,3.0,20/7/2014,"I have been to the cheesecake factory in walnut creek and sf neither one is memorable. The food is good decently priced, good portions overall. I like this place to eat and hang out with friends. It looks like fine dining but jeans and sandals are perfect for men or women. Service always good and attentive even at 1030 Saturday night. Cocktails worth a try. Food is good. Flat bread pizza yum. Too many cheesecake choices but worth a try after all it is the cheesecake factory."
Chloe J.,"Hilo, United States",31,5,,3.0,13/7/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is delicious but this location is so busy. I always get the farfalle chicken pasta or the steak diane. Service is good and the food is good but because of the location the wait gets long and they don't take reservations either.
Cel Y.,"Berkeley, United States",215,89,278,3.0,9/7/2014,Oh wow the chicken Katsu was super salty!!Other then that everything else was good. The veggies with the brown rice and spicy miso sauce was amazing.
Christina L.,"San Jose, United States",250,215,279,3.0,7/7/2014,3 stars for the view and the customer service we received while being there. The wait was quite awhile about 2 hours but my family and I ended up just shopping while waiting at Macys. It's nice to be all the way up and see the city while eating. Food was average. I got the roasted beat salad and I asked for extra beats. Definitely got my extra beats and portions was the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. My parents had their margherita pizza and a salad sandwich combo. Overall we would go back just for the view and to have a good time with the family.
Sunny H.,"Berkeley, United States",110,56,,3.0,3/7/2014,"For some reason, I keep finding reasons to come back here time and time again even though each experience has been very mediocre. At the end of the day, I think it's the location and the ambiance that make me want to give it another shot. This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor of Macy's in Union Square, affording it a really nice view of downtown San Francisco. Although it can get chilly at times, the patio is in my opinion the prime location to get the best dining experience. After all, that's the biggest differentiating factor of this specific location. Food-wise, it's very average at best. The only dish I've had here that I really enjoyed was the Chicken Piccata. I love the light flavors and the angel hair pasta in this dish. Beyond that, the other dishes I've tried as well as my friends' dishes have all been very average and don't justify the price. However, I have yet to try their famous cheesecakes so maybe that will be a game changer the next time I come here. Because of its prime location, prepare for very long wait times on the weekends. On the weekdays, small parties can usually get a seat within half an hour. Waiting in their lobby with tons of other tourists is a beast in itself, so I would recommend taking advantage of the new system they've implemented. They text you when your food is ready, which is pretty convenient because now you can shop all over Macy's and in neighboring areas while you're waiting. Overall, it's a good place to bring out of town guests or to treat yourself a little bit. If you're looking for better food, however, I would recommend trying one of the many other restaurants nearby."
Robie C.,"Stockton, United States",0,5,,3.0,2/7/2014,This is a really good place I recommend it to anyone. Service is wonderful the food is great and everyone is nice.
Paumela B.,"Vista, United States",10,52,5,3.0,14/6/2014,this cheesecake factory is pretty much like other cheesecake factories i've been too. food is ok. service was good but a bit slow. overall it was ok.
Maybo L.,"San Francisco, United States",331,159,208,3.0,9/6/2014,"Why isn't it possible to make reservations?!? The wait is super long, for a party of 4 on a Sunday at 8pm is 45 minutes. Then the food takes another 45 minutes to come. The long wait for a table and the food docks a star off since they don't take reservations. I'm sure most people do not want to plan big birthday parties and tell the whole group to wait for a table.  We were celebrating a birthday and it was nice for the waiters to come together and sing happy birthday. During the time we were there, heard two other parties celebrating birthdays. Seems like the place since the cheesecake is so delicious! Our server was pretty nice, we were checked on once in awhile to make sure everything was going well.  The food can be a hit or miss. Ordered 3 different kinds of steaks and one was flavorless (steak diane) while the hibachi steak was tasty. The rib eye didn't taste special, seems like the same thing you could anywhere else."
Nancy K.,"Sunnyvale, United States",37,87,10,3.0,5/6/2014,we went there on Monday around8 pm the lobby was not busy at all we were a pary of 8  and the front desk said the wait is approximately 2 hrs . which ithought was ridicuolous because i could see the empty tables around me . So after waitin 45 mins i asked them how come we have to wait there are tables outside that are available and the server said becuase they cannot sit more than 6 outside i felt that hard to believe . Anyways the food was ok . The service was really slow as i said it wasnt busy at all but the servers were taking there sweet time.  In the future i would think twice before i go to this particular location because i have 2 CCF close to my house . the only reason i like going to this one in particular is becuase of the view . . But the servicehas gone down a lot ..
Star B.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, United States",83,54,4,3.0,28/5/2014,"It's just an average restaurant with a great view... The food is nothing special, but I could see why two years ago when I first moved to SF I thought it was so great..."
