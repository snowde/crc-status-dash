Darius B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",261,100,12,3.0,26/5/2014,"Arrived about 90 minutes ago and was told that there would be a 25 minute wait for 2.5 people. I can understand waiting for 10-20 minutes beyond what they quote, but I've been waiting here for over an hour still have not been seated. I would only recommend this spot if you had time to waste and nothing better to do. I would tell you about the food and rest of service once I actually am seated. The food was actually really delicious, I had the Hibachi steak which was tender and juicy. The server was good so I had to bump up a star, but I honestly would not have planned on waiting so long had I known ahead of time about the actual wait."
Robert B.,"Boise, United States",109,151,20,3.0,15/5/2014,Not a big fan of this chain. Went with a group of friends and it was okay. Had the chicken katsu which was about 15 bucks and was good. I'd just rather pay the normal 10 bucks for it at a Hawaiian BBQ place and not deal with the madhouse that the cheesecake factory is. Feels very touristy but they do have quite the selection of desserts. Good for sweets but not my pick for a dinner spot.
Matt Y.,"Lahaina, United States",198,383,2248,3.0,9/5/2014,"5/5/14  Dinner CF is like Disneyland for me---once is enough for a long while, usually it's an occasion to entertain visitors. Obligatory visit as I'm entertaining out-of-country friends from Thailand. Cheesecake Factory makes prefect sense after their full-day of looting Macy's and the Union Square shops. The name says it all---Cheesecake Factory---known for their cheesecakes and they don't disappoint.  Monday evening at 6 there's already a wait of 10-15 minutes. For party of 4+ everyone has to be present in order to be seated. The wait for the patio seating is usually longer when it's nice out. It was nice sitting by the windows so my friends would enjoy the view of Union Square. Food is bland and mediocre at best. We all decided to ""down-size"" our dinner portions to make room for the cheesecakes.  Moscow Mule is a mango-flavored twist and that's the only Moscow Mule they could make. It was alright, more fruity than fizzy. Cosmopolitan is disappointingly weak. I couldn't taste any vodka. My friends had bottled beers. I don't remember ever having a tasty cocktail here. :/ Thai Lettuce Wraps quite tasty with a sweet chili sauce and a peanut dip. Mozzarella-basil-tomato flatbread is good , thin-crusted served on a wooden skillet. Pasta Da Vinci is a penne with grilled chicken and mushrooms in a light creamy white wine sauce. It's completely lacking flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt to it. Teriyaki Chicken on Brown Rice is okay, with a sweet-tasting glaze.  All four cheesecakes are STELLAR: Snickers, Lemon Raspberry, Godiva Chocolate, and Red Velvet. All over the top and we licked all the plates clean. The Snickers one is really plain cheesecake with crunched Snickers bar on top. The Godiva cheesecake is has a stronger taste of chocolate than cheesecake. This is it if you like chocolate. The Red Velvet is a mixture of plain cheesecake and velvet cake. Overall the food is just mediocre, hit-or-miss. Skip the cocktails and have them instead at Bar Drake or Dirty Habit at the Palomar Hotel. Make sure you save your room for cheesecakes."
J. H.,"Oakland, United States",6,11,7,3.0,11/4/2014,"I would rate this place 5 stars or more for the occasion and the memories, but I cannot. Came to this restaurant around the first week of January. This was one of the first places I went to for my first date with my boyfriend, and it was quite a memorable night. We talk about it a lot til this day and look forward to coming back again (When he graduates and hopefully finds a job here *fingers crossed*) On with the review though, and less with the cheese. ____ The Wait: Can't talk about the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square without mentioning the wait! It's almost like a strange conversational blasphemy...Gotta talk about the wait. Let's just say it's the kind of wait where, you have to go window shopping just to kill the time. If the person at the front desk says 30 min, they mean 30 min and maybe a few after. If they say an hour, they mean an hour. They provide you with one of those portable electronic ringers to let you know your seat is ready. Just be patient. We had to wait an hour and some minutes, which was fine with us because it gave us time to window shop (don't buy anything in Union Square unless you make a six figure salary, seriously. What are you? A wallet serial killer?) and walk about downtown. Even explore the huge Macy's store. Sofas are conveniently placed next to the restaurant's entrance if you don't plan on walking anywhere to kill time. If they've moved it by the time you read this review: sorry bud. Your couch is in another floor. (Mario reference was intentional). ____ The Service: Service was great in my opinion. I didn't have any rude service. The people at front desk had to raise their voice almost to yell to inform us of stuff over the crowd, so don't take it as them being rude. They're just trying to do their job. Our waiter was a very cheery gay man who was very funny and checked in on us at appropriate times. He didn't check in on us excessively which was very kind of him. He was available to us whenever we needed him though. Wish I remembered his name! But wherever you are dude, you're great. Keep it up. ___ The Atmosphere: We sat on the balcony part and it can get a bit chilly yes, but they got space heaters for that and we were placed conveniently next to it. Nice fancy atmosphere. A bit dark on the inside, but it sets the date mood. Great view of the city at night and very clean and nice. Very crowded though. As soon as you get to the restaurant via escalators, you'll notice how loud it is. It's a popular place though, so don't be surprised. ___ The Food: I can't remember 100% what we ordered. I just know my boyfriend got a pizza, I got some sort of chicken pesto tomato garlic pasta, and we got vanilla bean cheesecake. Let's just say pasta is not this restaurants forte. I'll mention the bad first then the good. -Cons: You could tell the pasta was made with canned tomatoes, poorly chopped up garlic and boxed pasta. The chicken was very dry too and the plate overall tasted pre-made. The pasta was not boiled well, because I had some half cooked noodles and some over cooked noodles. It was a mixture of both. The sauce had way too much garlic and not enough flavor. It tasted like watered down tomatoes and that it came straight from a can. I felt like there wasn't a lot of love put into my dish. The portion was very big, which I didn't mind. Overall, the dish could have been done better if each part was cooked well. -Pros: The pizza was great. It was yummy warm and flavorful. The crust was thin but still crunchy and not stale. I wish I ordered the pizza instead of pasta, because I found myself eating off the same plate as my boyfriend more than my own.  The cheesecake was the star of the show. We were very full but we still wanted to eat all of the cheesecake, but we had to save it. Even after saving it in a box, it still tasted delicious. The vanilla was fragrant and just the right amount of sweetness. The cheesecake was very airy but sweet and delightful. The whip cream was whipped to the right consistency and I felt like I was eating sweet clouds in my mouth. A nice light cheesecake, not full of a lot of strong flavors but it was juuuust right. Probably the best cheesecake I had in my life so far. I look forward to trying more from there next time.  ___ Other comments:  Not much besides go for the cheesecakes. Every other dish is kind of questionable. If you want to take someone on a date, this is one of those places to put on your list. I miss this place, and we'll come back for it on another date. I'll order something other than the pasta though. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Nadine B.,"San Francisco, United States",13,92,56,3.0,7/4/2014,"Positiv: I like all the cheesecakes there and the have a lot of it. Good place for a coffee/dessert stop in downtown. If you sit outside you will have a amazing view and can relax in the sun. Lunch and Dinner is ok. Negativ: even on the week you have to wait long for a table. Waiting time on the weekends around 1-2 hours, but if you have enough time and can stay that long or go around a little bit in Macy's it is ok. Service is sometimes really slow! Ok I understand the have a lot to do there, but even if you want the check it need so much time.  We don't have the cheesecake factory in germany and every time I come to SF I go there ones for dessert, but only if I have enough time and a good friend with me to talk ;)"
Crystal M.,"San Francisco, United States",3,55,9,3.0,7/4/2014,Great food! Just a really long wait at times. I had my 25th birthday dinner their and my family couldn't sit together cause it was so many people there but I made it work. They should start accepting reservations
S G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,12,,3.0,13/3/2014,"The wait times are borderline ridiculous but what else would you expect at such a prime location in the heart of Union square.  The food has been really good each time we have been there. Their vegetarian burger is really really good, highly recommended.  Also recommend making a reservation and then heading out to their patio to enjoy the beautiful views of Union Square from there."
Bill L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",2,251,,3.0,5/3/2014,"a group of us came here for sunday brunch. there were 8 of us. first disappointment.  they seated us in two booths (of five each).  we pointed to a section of open tables which could have easily accomodated us.  needless to say, they would refuse. During the whole time we were there, no one was seated in the open tables. Now for the most important item - food Ordered calamari for both booths, french toast, santa fe salad, shrimp pasta, cheesesteak, fish taco, mac and cheese, crab salad. Calamari was the best of the lot.  all else was good"
Robert M.,"Merced, United States",2,42,4,3.0,23/2/2014,"Always a wait, cheesecake are amazing as one would guess.  Can't go wrong with the Cheesecake,the menu is a book and the food is what you would expect from a chain.  The service has always been sub par for us."
Angel C.,"San Bruno, United States",21,13,,3.0,22/1/2014,"This place is outrageous. I recognize that I came here on a really busy night (Sunday night of PAX weekend), but there was a 15 person line for the to-go cheesecake line and a handful of people behind the counter cranking out orders. They were clearly hard working and really trying to go fast. BUT, the guy taking orders, was also the same guy taking payments, and bagging the cheesecake orders as they came up, and delivering the cake to the 10 more people waiting for their order. What's up with that?? Talk about bottleneck! I really appreciate their efforts, but I ended up waiting 30 minutes just for two slices (that were waiting on the counter for 10 minutes).  Redeeming factor to justify 3 star rating: Cheesecake was delicious - I had lemon raspberry and kahlua and both were MONEY. But questionable whether they were worth it for the long unpleasant and crowded wait"
Michael C.,"Honolulu, United States",376,724,4176,3.0,16/1/2014,"No Reservations. My mother and I ventured to this location for lunch after an busy morning of shopping in Union Square.   Since my mother had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before, I suggested we stop in for lunch since we were in the area. LOCATION/SETTING:  Top floor of Macy's (women's store).  Accessible via escalator or elevator.  Seating is either indoors or outdoors on their patio overlooking union square park.   Though we arrived slightly past 1pm, surprisingly we were still quoted a wait of 30 minutes.  A pager was given though we (as well as other parties) waited near the check-in podium.  Some opted to wait on the patio while others left since the wait was too long.  In the end, we waited roughly 35-40 minutes. FOOD:  The menu is very diverse with many, many selections.  They include appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, etc., and of course, dessert. 1.  Turkey Burger:  My mother's choice.  Served with a small salad.  She found it satisfactory as she finished most of it. 2.  Pasta Da Vinci (lunch portion):  The menu has a lunch section where smaller portions of their sandwiches/pastas/entrees are offered. I've had this pasta before and I thought it was ok. It wasn't as memorable as at other locations where I've ordered this dish.  It was slightly undercooked to say the least.  I ate most of it since I was quite hungry.  3. Seasonal pumpkin cheesecake: Huge slice with a big dollop of whip cream. Not overly sweet. A great way to end the meal. SERVICE: Not great. The server, though polite and friendly, was slightly forgetful. He neglected to write down my order which prevented my food from being dropped off at the same time as my mother's.  My mom was hungry so I told her to go ahead and start eating.  Drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and there was a delay (for some reason) in getting the check. BOTTOM LINE: Convenient location. Ok food. Below satisfactory service."
Azinda M.,"Chicago, United States",28,289,8,3.0,12/1/2014,"I know everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory, and to be honest, it's pretty good. But I prefer some interesting quirky restaurant over this. HOWEVER, I love that Cheesecake factory's menu is stocked with awesome variety -- really, anything you want is on that menu (which makes it SO hard to decide what to get!) My friends and I came here for our NYE dinner, which was nice, since we got to look off the balcony and enjoy the view of Union Square, but then the wait... omg. We waited about an hour to an hour and a half, so it was nuts (we showed up around 4:30...). However, we were seated, had the most eccentric waiter I've EVER had--which was an amusing twist to the evening, complete with many high-fives, semi-awkward yet extremely amusing references to mistletoe, lone wolfs, and mixing of tea bags. If you have ""Chaos"" as your waiter, you're in for the weirdly enjoyable evening we have. Anyways, khalua cheesecake. End of story."
Edmund Y.,"Manhattan, United States",17,82,18,3.0,11/1/2014,"Why the hell do people like this place so much?  It's like the go-to big party dinner restaurant.  I mean, the food is good, waiters are all extremely friendly and attentive, and ofc cheesecake, but the WAIT TIMES omg.  We had a party of 7, and the wait for dinner was 1.5 hrs.  You get a nice view of Union Square from the balcony, and get to see the Christmas tree and ice skaters, but there are so many other restaurants in downtown to go to instead. Lastly, I don't even like Cheesecake!"
Alice N.,"Alameda, United States",0,13,8,3.0,23/12/2013,"Had a very lovely waitress but the wait for it was ridiculous (as always). I do love the cheese cake there (of course), I stick to my classic strawberry cheesecake. I don't recommend getting nachos there. The cheese hardens and it just taste like plastic, idk. I didn't particularly like my pasta dish but that was my mistake of ordering it. Overall. It was an average dining experience"
Brittany D.,"Berkeley, United States",420,410,1063,3.0,18/12/2013,"I think the first time I came here was better than when I came last night. We waited about an hour for a table, which is normal for the holiday season in union square. There were so many people there, so it was super cramped just checking it. There was also a lot of servers walking around & it was hard enough for them to get from one place to another.  When we got to the table, it was pretty tight for a group of 6. It was a booth that was snug for 3 people sitting on either side of the bench. The server got to us pretty quickly but the food didn't. I'm pretty sure we had to wait around 45 minutes for 3 entrees & an appetizer. That was not cool especially when most of us were fighting hunger pangs. We decided to exchange secret Santa gifts while waiting for the food which was a nice way to make time pass. But because the space was so tight. There wasn't much room to move your arms to open the presents.  The food itself was really good but I was expecting larger portions for couscous & chicken, especially since it cost $16.95!! The entrees are way overpriced for what you get.  When we paid, we noticed there was an automatic 18% gratuity! It was crazy that our gratuity was $10 when the service was not all that great! I guess it applies to groups of 5 or more bc one of our friends ordered something separately from the rest of us! It was $3 per person for tax & tip but that adds up when you have 5 people. I think eating downtown is overrated & only worth it maybe for lunch or for off season (not during Christmas break!). Not sure if I'll come back during this time again."
B ..,"Vallejo, United States",103,59,112,3.0,17/12/2013,"Was pretty nice, had a good time great drinks bar tender that helpd us had patience, and made great drinks. Yummy appetizers. Yummy cake. Very loud and long wait so make sure you put in a reservation. I had the steak diane and shrimp scampi with fries the steak i did not like very much but it was because of the caramel onions. Yuck scampi and fries were good."
Ashley N.,"San Jose, United States",155,338,91,3.0,28/11/2013,"I hypothesize that the only reason this Cheesecake factory is more crowded than your typical cheesecake factory is because it is located in union square, 8th floor macy's - and you get a pretty nice view if you're outside!  Other than the view, there really is nothing special.  Well, beside the fact that THERE IS AAAALWAYS A WAIIIT, or at least that is what it feels like whenever I come for a visit.  Regardless, I keep coming back because I love my cheesecake (and farfalle pasta), and I love it better with a view.  (You can see the view without eating here, btw)"
Anne R.,"Hercules, United States",5000,829,322,3.0,24/11/2013,Let me start off by saying:  5 stars for the views if you sit outside  Customer service is a 3.5 or 4 depending on who is serving you  Waiting times on a busy day is a 1 - 2 stars- super long wait mainly to sit outside  The food is 2-3 stars - nothing really special.  Parking 1 star because its expensive as heck and forced to pretty much park across the street.
Tina Z.,"San Francisco, United States",8,1,,3.0,23/11/2013,"Finally made it tonight! The steak is tasty,but the cheesecake is way more sweet for me, I'm going to be chubby T_T"
Shirley N.,"San Francisco, United States",177,1291,147,3.0,15/11/2013,"You've always got to wait unless you arrive within the first hour of opening. Located atop Macy's at Union Square.  We were here at 3pm.  Yes, given a pager and had to wait about 20+ minutes. Service here is always disjointed.  The server ask repeatedly is everything okay, but doesn't follow through.  Gotta walk the talk.  Water glass is not refilled.  Clean forks for dessert aren't brought prior to dessert coming.  Little things like that. We did family style - shrimp rolls, sliders, and the Margherita pizza.  Average food. Got two cheesecakes for dessert - Hershey chocolate and the mango key lime. Skip the mango key lime.  Way too sweet.  You can never go wrong with Hershey's.  Great outdoor patio with view of Union Square."
