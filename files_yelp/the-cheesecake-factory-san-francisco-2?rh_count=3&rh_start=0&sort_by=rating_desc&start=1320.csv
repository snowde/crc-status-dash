Liu W.,"Inner Richmond, San Francisco, United States",2,1,,3.0,3/11/2013,I really don't understand of their administration as there are tons of table here but they let the customers wait and wait and wait. Even though the foods really and the service of dishes are really great but the way they let us wait for 30 min (even there are tons of table) is uncompromisingly unacceptable .... Improve your administration ... Or you destroy yourself by yourself ...
Linda B.,"San Francisco, United States",94,206,972,3.0,27/10/2013,The first time here the food was fabulous. Everything came out great. I'm a eggs Benedict kind of girl and 2nd time here one of my poach egg was missing the yolk :( the potatoes were too cook and kinda hard. Giving the cheese cake a 3stars because my first experience was great 2nd time around not so good but I will return
Lauren P.,"San Francisco, United States",84,160,12,3.0,26/10/2013,"you know what you're going to get when you step foot into a cheesecake factory.  it's a chain restaurant and it feels like a chain restaurant.  but the food is decent and because it's a chain restaurant, you know what you're going to get -- yay for being predictable! this particular location is smack dab in the middle of union square which is tourist central.  and, no matter what time of day it is, this place is packed.  i mean, you-need-to-wait-45-minutes-for-a-table kind of packed. come patient.  come hungry."
Annie W.,"Vallejo, United States",2,66,,3.0,23/10/2013,"Long waits, lots of people, great view of union square, amazing cheesecakes, 3000+ cal meals, not strong enough drinks, nice service, and great company. What else could a girl want? Our waitress was great."
Jennie W.,"San Francisco, United States",128,112,4,3.0,18/10/2013,The Cheesecake Factory food is not bad but I wouldn't say its fantastic either.  The positive side is that they give big portions and the desserts are good.  The menu is so large its hard to decide what to order sometimes.
Jack T.,"Arlington, United States",0,14,,3.0,8/10/2013,"Thankfully, this restaurant is on the top level of a mall -- they don't take reservations, so it pays to go to the front desk first thing when you enter the mall to ask for a table. Their bullet vibrators (god, I hope that's the right term for it) aren't made for long-distance signals, so you're pretty much confined to walking around Macy's. If you're not into shopping for discount clothing or overpriced home goods and Cheesecake is making you wait more than 30 minutes, it's probably not worth it -- the food is as you would expect at any Cheesecake: high quantity, low quality. The thing that drew me and my girlfriend to try this particular Cheesecake was the outdoor rooftop seating. The view is cool (overlooks Union Square), but even though they have heat lamps, it's much colder up there than you would think. Definitely bring a jacket if you're planning on sitting outside!"
Anny T.,"Yuba City, United States",201,17,2,3.0,8/10/2013,My group and I ate there on a Friday night so of course it was busy. 1 hour and 30 minute wait. Feet started hurting but that's what we get for coming at the busiest hour.  Loved dining on the rooftop. Our server was very friendly.  Everyone enjoyed their food but my ahi tuna steak was cooked for way too long. I like mine seared and for the center to just melt in my mouth. I didn't complain because it was way too busy there and I figured a replacement order would come out once the rest of my party was done eating (they were scarfing down their food after that nearly 2 hour wait). The wasabi crust was good.. And it was the only thing that was good about my plate.  I tried my husband's ribeye and it was good. Cooked perfectly.  I was in a good mood though (my husband's birthday!) so oh well. This place is more for the fun atmosphere than a good hearty meal.
Alanna R.,"Los Angeles, United States",283,114,3,3.0,17/9/2013,"Stop hating. You get good chain restaurant quality food and a lot of it. The view does get old, but its better than nothing. I go here from time to time and I am calmed by the familiarity.  Another plus: the quality is so consistent. That's more than I can say for a lot of other places.  The wait sucks and so do the tourists. But I guess that's the price you pay for living in SF."
Ryan F.,"Vallejo, United States",199,18,7,3.0,16/9/2013,"Nice overview of union square if you are seated outside.  I gave this place 3 stars because although the view is great, the floors are really slimy (maybe from dropped beverages or food), my chicken was slightly burnt, and the food was just OK for its price.  However, the cheesecake was BOMB! I got the cookies and cream cheese cake and it was really good lol. Also, the waiter was prompt to my requests, friendly, and even boxed my unfinished food in a nice bag.  Overall an OK place to go if you wanted to eat out in Union Square San Francisco."
Cherry Y.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, United States",99,57,81,3.0,1/9/2013,"A ridiculously long line, especially during lunch time. But because theyre big chain stores i can always expect to have good food. I would only go there for lunch, simply because even lunch menus come in huge servings. Next time i go i'd love to dine outside!"
Bill W.,"Austin, United States",2,47,,3.0,30/8/2013,"3.5 stars Prior to my vacation in San Francisco, my wife and I agreed that we would try not to eat at any chain restaurants. Well, after several nights of expensive meals at local restaurants, we decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a try.  Although the front desk staff seemed overwhelmed by the people asking for tables, they provided us with a notification device and told us it was an hour wait. We did some shopping for part of the time. When the device went off, they told us to wait off to the side, which ended up being another 10 minute wait. My complaint here is every other restaurant that I have been to won't set off the notification device unless your table is ready. So, don't be fooled that when yours goes off that a table is truly ready; you probably have additional time to wait. The food was typical for the chain and, surprisingly, the prices were about the same as prices at the same chain in Austin, TX. For SF, the prices were much more reasonable. The food was typical for the chain. It was ""nothing to write home about,"" but it satisfied the appetite. We sat on the outside terrace on a rather chilly night and we were really not prepared. The heaters worked marginally well. But, THE VIEW of the buildings around Union Square was memorable. It was especially funny to see the birds fly up to the glass surrounding the balcony and seem to ask ""have something for me to munch on?"""
Jenny T.,"Hayward, United States",350,671,1794,3.0,29/8/2013,"You know what?!  Its not really a factory, its a restaurant, however, it's like the busiest restaurant EVER!! Its so packed that many people end up sitting one level down at Macy's furniture deptartment.  They sit on plush couches like its their right to do it.  Is it though?!  I think Macy's should charge Cheesecake Factory couch rental fees.  I think it's rude! Ayway...Let's talk about the meal! Always good and consistent.  I ordered a rib eye steak with French fries.  My friend ordered the jambalaya pasta.  And we both shared the banana cream cheesecake.  All dishes are great and we thoroughly enjoyed the free bread with butter.   Service is good.  We got there at 5:30pm and waited 5 minutes for a seat.  And dinner was served promptly.  Good times..."
Crystal M.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,3.0,21/8/2013,"Wait time was extremely long for this Cheese Cake. Once we got our seats, it took the server long to get to our table. Once he got to our table to get drink menus, he walked away before we can even tell him we actually know what order. Throughout the night it was a look out to find our server. Food was okay, service was okay, hence, 3 stars."
Mindy C.,"San Francisco, United States",13,18,9,3.0,18/8/2013,I have no idea what the hype is about. I guess you can say that the cheesecakes are pretty good (I personally think it is FAR too sweet) and that the servers are great but the entrees and front desk are not good. Prices are kind of outrageous for those tiny portions. They don't even taste all that great. The best dish I had was probably that veggie pizza and sweet potato fries. The front desk people are plan busy. Understandable that you want to move the line but you could at least smile and seem more friendly. I definitely would NOT go back even if Safeway has more Cheesecake Factory gift cards for sale
Reza S.,"San Jose, United States",25,13,5,3.0,13/8/2013,"So I took my siblings and my cousin to Cheesecake Factory today. It was my cousins first time and it definitely don't satisfy her.  The normal wait was ok because it was nearing the end of lunchtime, so we waited happily for 15 minutes before getting seated. In the meantime, we glanced at the menu to figure out what we wanted. So we ordered, and then they brought the bread. What a horrendous wait! 40 minutes it took them to prepare the food, and it wasn't brought to us together, it came separately. Next my cousin ordered their garlic noodles with no mushrooms..... When they brought it out, there were mushrooms, and also the pasta was sticking together as if it wasn't cooked long enough. Very disappointing in addition to the wait we had to endure.  The tomato, basil and cheese pizza that I ordered was also not worth the wait.  But I do have to say that their fried Mac and cheese was amazing!!!!!! And worth having.  Overall, 3 stars, 1 off for the wait, and 1 off the disappointing experience my cousin had."
Andrea G.,"San Francisco, United States",266,236,498,3.0,13/8/2013,"The other day I went to Cheesecake Factory with my sister as a part of our girl's day out. We did a little shopping in downtown SF and then decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for lunch. Even at 2:00 in the afternoon, the place was packed. So many people were waiting to be seated. Luckily, it only took about 10 minutes before a table was available. I love Cheesecake Factory. I really do. And while the food was as delicious as ever, I felt that the service was a little slow. And that's why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4. I do understand that Cheesecake Factory is always packed and busy, but even so, we had to wait awhile for our server to come ask us what we'd like to drink. And then we had to wait awhile for him to come back and ask us if we're ready to order. We waited awhile for the food to arrive. And when we were done, we had to wait awhile to get our check. And awhile more to get our change back. All the waiting aside, the food was delicious. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which was linguine pasta with a slightly spicy fresh tomato sauce. There were some red and green bell peppers and onions. The chicken and shrimp were perfectly marinated and cooked. They were tender and juicy. I especially loved that the parsley was freshly chopped and sprinkled over the dish, giving it a refreshing taste. My sister ordered the Pasta Da Vinci. That was also tasty, as usual. I have an affinity for Madeira sauce so anything with Madeira sauce is bound to be a favorite for me. I loved that the penne pasta was very flavorful. Overall, I felt that the food was delicious but because the service was especially slow, it made our visit less enjoyable."
Victoria G.,"San Francisco, United States",217,27,37,3.0,8/8/2013,"Today my sister and I decided to have lunch here to catch up and enjoy a nice meal. As we entered Macy's we just see a huge line for the elevator so we chose to take the escalator to beat the crowded, as we entered cheesecake factory we see that it is veryyy packed knowing that we would probably have to wait long in order for us to be seated. The host said that it would probably be a 30 minute wait for a table so we were like whatever sure we take it but we thought it would be a good lunch since we only waited about 10 minutes for a table.  HOWEVER, I was wrong! We waited about 20 mins until our waiter came to ask us what we wanted to drink and bring our bread out then waited another 10 mins until he came back to ask for our orders. Then customers came about 20 mins after us and sat next to us with the same waiter who helped them out and was right on task with them which I thought was odd. Also, their food seem to come out quicker than ours. Our food came out about 10 minutes after the customers next to us.  The food we ordered was jambalaya pasta and pasta da vinci, they were both so delicious which we thought was the best part of our time there. The jambalaya pasta only comes in the large dinner portion dish so I suggest to be very hungry before ordering that and if you enjoy Cajun flavor food then I would recommend you to order this. Pasta da vinci is made of chicken, mushroom, onions, penne pasta with madeira wine sauce which I love the flavor of so if you do too then I recommend this dish and trust me the flavor will fill you up.  I've gone to cheesecake factory so many times in my life and I would have to say that this was such a bad experience from the service side. I gave it a 3 rating because I've had much better experience from here before and I know they could do better. Plus the waiter I had today was also the same waiter from the time I went with my boyfriend which was about 2 months ago."
Jen L.,"Agoura Hills, United States",195,584,253,3.0,7/8/2013,"It's crowded, It's toursty, It's CROWDED If I have friends that are visiting, I will brave the masses for the view. If you go early you can have a nice brunch outside with the view. If you want quick service try the bar.  Or even take out, go eat on the Square."
Sara B.,"Rancho Cordova, United States",174,170,142,3.0,30/7/2013,"I had always wanted to sit on top of the Macy's tower in Union Square and go to the Cheesecake Factory. This past Saturday, we paid SF a visit and did just that. The restaurant was packed, especially since the area is known for having tourists. We were told the wait would be between 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. It was 8 o'clock at night, we were starving, and didn't feel like looking elsewhere, so we decided to wait it out. Well, the wait ended up being 2 hours! Last minute I asked if we could sit outside, instead, since it seemed to be a little less chilly than it was 2 hours ago, but was told the wait time would be even longer. No, thanks! So, we were seated indoors in a nice booth at the corner of the restaurant and the lights were dim, as all Cheesecake Factory's are. We ordered their avocado egg rolls and fried calamari to start off with. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was delicious, as expected, especially the calamari. Our waitress also brought out a basket full of fresh bread and butter; kudos to her for bringing another one out once she saw we finished the first one.  For dinner, I was feeling adventurous. Usually I go with their baja chicken tacos but wanted to try something new, so, I ordered their fettuccine Alfredo without chicken. Let me tell you, it was TO DIE FOR. So creamy, so delicious, and melt-in-your-mouth good. I couldn't even finish half of it, though, partly because it was so rich and partly because we had gorged on bread and appetizers beforehand.  Overall, we had a nice dining experience here but would have appreciated a much lesser wait time. I can't condone a 2 hour wait time (especially when I can go to my local CF and have a 30 minute wait time), so I have to give this location 3 stars!"
Faith A.,"New Orleans, United States",206,508,366,3.0,28/7/2013,"I try to steer clear of chains and try to find the local eateries, but I could not find anything else in Union Square and I was on the verge of pass out starving so in a moment of panic I swung up the elevator in Macy's to eat. The service was great, very attentive, but did not rush us when we had to read the 20 page menu. What's up with that by the way? they couldn't decide what kind of restaurant to be so they decided to be all of them in one? The food was 2 stars, but the service bumps this place up another star."
