Philip C.,"San Francisco, United States",139,280,614,3.0,22/7/2013,"We dropped by for brunch one Saturday.  Our name was taken and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was friendly and took our order quickly.  Our meal came promptly and our server kept our lemonade glasses refilled. My husband had the popcorn shrimp to start and liked it very much. For our main course, he had a shrimp club sandwich while I had a lunch margherita pizza and a green salad.  Both our dishes were very good and plentiful so we took a half of his sandwich and half of my pizza home for a later meal. We also took home a slice of cheesecake apiece and we enjoyed them very much. The prices were a little high and I did not like being seated at a table next to the servers' station because I could hear their chatter as they waited for more customers."
Christina N.,"Redwood City, United States",262,1060,1705,3.0,30/6/2013,"This outlet is particularly popular as it is on the top floor of Macy's and gives you a great view of Union Square in San Francisco. During dinner times, it typically takes about 45 minutes to get a table.  The portions here are huge, and enough to feed two people. I wouldnt say that the food is fantastic though, pretty average at best. The desserts are pretty creative with a large selection of cheesecake to choose from, all of which are sinfully rich. I wouldnt come here for the food as it is definitely not the best. However, I would bring my foreign friends here for the atmosphere, the view, the dessert, and because everyone seems to know Cheesecake Factory as the American restaurant to go to. (I might be over generalising a little here :P)"
Geordie E.,"San Francisco, United States",25,419,89,3.0,25/6/2013,Always add 20 minutes to the promised wait time.
Carolyn C.,"Los Angeles, United States",20,22,22,3.0,20/6/2013,great service and always crowded at this location. We have to wait for nearly 40min before a table was available. The bread is always good :)
Jamie B.,"Mountain View, United States",9,99,,3.0,30/5/2013,"Yes, it's a tourist haven (or tourist hell, depending on the night). Yes, it's a chain. And yes, it's on top of the 2nd largest Macy's in the world. But it's a nice spot to treat a friend to an after-finals dinner, which is just what me and the boyfriend did for our roommate and a friend of his.  In the interests of full disclosure, we let them pick the eatery.  I've been here a few times, usually for celebratory purposes, and I have no specific complaint except that the elevator ride is usually tight quarters and there isn't a lot of standing space around once you put your name in for a table. Hosts and hostesses are perfunctory bordering on rude, but you have to figure that they see lord knows how many people during the course of any given day, and we all know the public can make the saintliest person curse like a sailor. On this particular outing, it was just a 20 minute wait, so our little crew shuffled outside to take in the pretty fantastic view of Union Square at sunset. The bar is also a nice spot to go if you're a small party - if you can snag a table or bar seats, skip the wait and eat there.  We ate outside, which is normally not advised at sunset in SF, due to COLD, but they have heaters in their outdoor patio area. A few ambitious seagulls and pigeons do make it over the plastic partitions protecting patrons from the precipice (go alliteration!) but they are generally well behaved. I noticed a pair of pigeons actually strolling the aisle from table to table.  Got the bread, devoured the bread, love the bread. Now, as most anyone who's visited any TCF knows, portions here are ginormous. I usually get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta because, well...it's a huge plate of noodles with 4 pounded thin and breaded chicken pieces on top. And it's kinda spicy. And delicious. And makes two meals. Boy got a burger (big surprise), roomie got their pork chop, which I have to assume was good since he left nothing on the plate, and he is a small guy! Roomie's friend got fish n chips.  I was good and only ate half of my meal, and I was just hungry enough to want a few bites of cheesecake, so we ordered one slice for the table to share. Opted for the Kahlua coffee chocolate cheesecake. It was just as decadent as it sounds, and three bites was more than enough to slake my sweet tooth.  Service here is typically pretty good, our server was on point and was nice enough to let us know when he went on his dinner break, introducing us to his cover guy. I really do appreciate little touches like that.  So, yeah. There's a bazillion options in this area, most are local, and a lot are better. But this place cranks out a decent meal (and superplus portions) for a decent price. A-ok indeed."
Vivian D.,"San Diego, United States",455,55,,3.0,29/5/2013,"How do I explain my confused feelings for this place... It's really pricey for OK food, but the ambiance is romantic and great for large groups and for dates... and the dessert is to die for and not so overpriced. The only thing I really like on their menu is the carbonara.  Everything else tasted really ""whatever"" in comparison to other specialty restaurants.  Their menu is really large and gives a large selection but it's all ""not that special"". The restaurant is Huuuuuuge~~ so flagging down your waiter/ess is kind of annoying... so service is also MEH, but once in a while there's a really charismatic waiter, but again, this is rare. I have really mixed feelings for here and can't explain why I come back here to eat other than the convenience and the great cheesecake. Try the oreo cheesecake, it's to die for."
Tiffany D.,"San Francisco, United States",2768,1929,6297,3.0,6/5/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is a self-advertisement with their sign held up on top of central Union Square!  This place offers promising fine dining that conveniently holds big parties and a nice view of Union Square, San Francisco. Other than that, their food entrees and appetizers are mediocre!  They have a wide selection of food to choose from and above average, big portioned cheesecake to bite at!  Their dishes are not commendable.  I got their overpriced ($23) Breaded Ahi Seared Tuna with Brown Rice and it was not only too oily, it was also a bit on the bland side.  Burgers, sandwiches and pasta that were ordered up by my friends were simply good - again, nothing commendable. Their presentations for all the plates besides their infamous cheesecakes are typical.  Nothing to rave about. Service is good - they come over to see if you need anything else and refill the cups of water. Not a place for unique, delicious meals.  This place is ideally made for big party reservations, fine dining, for the view of Downtown, SF and if you want to consume 1000 plus calories on special, flavored cheesecakes."
Cheri S.,"San Francisco, United States",179,114,35,3.0,3/5/2013,"I've been to this location multiple times and this place is okay. There's just a ridiculous wait every time. I like how they serve traditional American as well as newer dishes (I always love my meatloaf and potatoes). The bread served at the beginning is hot and delicious. As for their cheesecakes, they have many varieties but I always stick to the original cheesecake. Very rich, very creamy. They're not called Cheesecake Factory for no reason. If you don't want to wait but would still like to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I'd recommend going to another branch, such as the one in San Mateo."
Ashley T.,"San Francisco, United States",760,408,957,3.0,1/5/2013,"Every time I go to Cheesecake Factory, the menu overwhelms me, so I stuff myself with the amazing molasses bread. I could eat baskets of the slightly sweet bread with the chewy oats on top! I came here again for the first time in a couple years, and the portions were just as big as I remembered. The Skinnylicious chicken pasta was really good, with pieces of juicy grilled chicken and pasta that was cooked to the chewy texture I like. The fresh tomatoes and basil were a nice extra touch too! I also had that rare burger craving, so we tried the Kobe burger which was huge. I loved the caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms on top, which gave it an Asian flavor. The bun was nicely toasted, and the meat was perfectly cooked. Overall, food here is good, but nothing that's particularly extraordinary. Except for the cheesecake! First of all, the variety of cheesecake alone makes me excited. I tried the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake for the first time, and it was chocolate heaven. I loved that it had chocolate cake on the bottom and a layer of mascarpone cheese, which made it less heavy overall (as opposed to having the entire thing be cheesecake). The chocolate cheesecake was perfect with the other two layers. My favorite part was the crust on the back, which was chocolatey and crunchy and perfect!  This is definitely a place to indulge, so wear your loose pants."
Allie D.,"San Francisco, United States",93,115,5,3.0,30/4/2013,"I must say that it's just all about the view, and the food is just ordinary.  I came here on a whim since I was starving and in Macy's.  They sat us outside and it was pretty chilling, but they did turn on the heater.  I don't think this Cheesecake is any different than other locations.  I didn't notice a happy hour menu either, so I'm not sure if they offer that."
Tommy C.,"San Francisco, United States",140,215,6,3.0,25/2/2013,"I really like the CheeseCake Factory because you get a solid meal, a heaping portion, and a delicious selection of cheesecake. I came last year with my boyfriend and we very much enjoyed our meal. One negative about the restaurant is that waiting for a table can be a nightmare. I would normally suggest putting your name in and waiting at the bar, but the bar is microscopic and it's basically impossible to get a drink. For a restaurant of that size (and the projected caliber) the bar should be larger than just 8 chairs. Besides this, I remember our meal being very good and the cheesecake was perfect (as it always is). I'll come back to the factory if I have a gift card or it's an odd weekday night but never during tourist season or on the weekend. Great to just buy cheesecake, too."
Yike Q.,"Berkeley, United States",0,3,1,3.0,16/2/2013,"I went there with my mother who wants to have a try of different cheese cakes. The food there was OK, not so special as I expected. The waiter was nice. However, he did not tell us that we had ordered MORE THAN ENOUGH! As a result, we took home half of the food we ordered and spent another day to finish! Not sure will go there again."
Drew F.,"Oakland, United States",42,113,228,3.0,14/2/2013,"Allways crowded and takes forever, but they do have a sweet view of union square n the food is yummy. Just make sure you call in a res or get there before 7pm so you can wait just down stairs lounging on a new sofa at the furniture store."
Lily K.,"Sausalito, United States",52,465,100,3.0,2/2/2013,"Came here with co-workers to discuss some software system stuff we use..and it proved to be a nice place to get together, a bit loud, but it was neat eating so high up in a building.  Ordered the shepherd's pie. Some of the filling and veggies were crunchy...not quite my taste for shepherd's pie. So 2-3 stars there. Opted to try the tiramisu for dessert. There's a tiramisu cheesecake and a regular tiramisu. I've had the cheesecake before, it's really good, so I ordered the regular tiramisu. The regular tiramisu had really good flavor, but the texture was off. It was mushy and watery, which made it a little difficult to eat. I still say the flavor was great though! Go for the outdoor seating."
Justin G.,"Norman, United States",16,46,55,3.0,16/1/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. What do you expect? It's consistently decent food, but the only real reason to eat here is to get a table out on the roof overlooking Union Square. Otherwise, it's no different than any other Cheesecake Factory. Be sure to bring a jacket if you're going to be seated outside. It does get cold quickly!"
Cindy G.,"Dixon, United States",119,137,579,3.0,30/12/2012,"Not a big fan of crowded lines but hey, its the weekend. So my friend and I decided to go and just wait for our tables to be called out. After 40 minutes, we finally sit down.  Services was ok but they mess up my friend and I drinks order. We order the raspberry lemonade and she brought out the strawberry lemonade. But hey, we took it instead and the waitress brought the correct order for refills. We order crab cakes bits, which was good but not that great but good. Roadhouse slider, it taste like any other burger I've gone. And the southern fried chicken slider which it's the best one. Great flavor and its like a party in my mouth. After our finger food dinner, cake time! My friend order pumpkin cheese cake, which taste like the holidays. But to me, it taste like any other cheesecake. And I order vanilla bean cheesecake, taste like the vanilla bean frappucinio from Starbucks. But my friend said it taste like lindor chocolate. Overall the food is decent, service is good but there trying there best since its a busy weekend.  I would come back but only on days where it's not packed."
Jackie T.,"San Diego, United States",72,276,73,3.0,21/12/2012,Suuuppppeeeeerr crowded. I'm not sure I would ever try to sit down and have a full meal here. I do enjoy getting their infamous cheesecakes to go though. Most of their cheesecakes are too rich for me. My favorite might just be the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.
Kit P.,"San Francisco, United States",197,42,26,3.0,14/12/2012,Always full of hungry patrons waiting for their turn to be seated.  We came here several times for dinner with the fiance' and had to wait at least 30-45 minutes.
Kanani S.,"Santa Rosa, United States",69,232,85,3.0,10/12/2012,"The place is beautiful, great views of Union Square and a nicely decorated restaraunt. The only problem is that they DON""T take reservations and they are almost always extremley busy. Came here at 5:30 on a Friday night and the wait was already an hour long, with two little kids waits like this are almost unbearable but the upside is that you're at Union Square, lots of places to take the kids to occupy them for that hour. Once we were seated our waitress was ok, nothing special about her. I ordered the chicken carbanora, it was just ok, i asked for extra bacon and i think they forgot it? The sauce needed a little more salt and pepper as well, it lacked in flavor. My husband had the hibachi steak w/ wasabi mashed potatoes, his meal was spot on. The kids had the mac n cheese and mini corn dogs w/ fries, both meals were good, the kids loved the mac n cheese. Given the chance I'd probably go again just because I love The Cheesecake Factory and some of their other items on the menu."
Evita-Marie R.,"Seattle, United States",132,133,22,3.0,6/12/2012,"Beautiful View. Ok Food. Ok Service. The cheesecake factory is probably on the top of my list as far as chains. I've celebrated many birthdays and occasions at Cheesecake Factory. My last experience at the one in SF however kind of let me down. We went here last sunday for an late lunch/early dinner. During our 2+hr dinner. Our server had changed 3 times-- it made it very confusing when we needed something. It also took extra long for our drinks and food to come out, probably because the server who took our order was different than the server bringing our food & the server who brought our food was different from the server who checked us out. It did not make for a smooth dinner.  The food is usually very pleasing. However his last time, the presentation lacked. My salad looked as though the greens weren't that fresh and someone did not put much effort to make it look... like something you'd want to eat. My fish came out the same way-- very sloppy and sad to look at.  Nonetheless, these reasons would not halt me from EVER coming back to the cheesecake factory-- afterall, I grew up eating here. Everyone has an off day & maybe staffing was challenged that day-- however, hopefully next time will be a better experience."
