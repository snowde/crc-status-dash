Leily P.,"Oakland, United States",53,615,39,3.0,3/12/2012,The wait is always an hour except how can you not love a place that offers cheesecake with as many calories as the food.
Victoria C.,"Daly City, United States",853,318,230,3.0,29/11/2012,"What a wonderful night my husband planned for me.  Ice skating in union square, shopping at Macy's and dinner at Cheesecake Factory. The instant you walk in, the ambiance changes completely.  It's like you're in another place and you hardly notice that it's in Macy's.  On top to be exact, as it has spectacular views of Union Square.  It's a must see, especially since it's Christmas time and all of the lights are up.  So gorgeous! Waits can be long so make reservations.  Staff was great and our waiter was so nice.  He totally indulged all my wacky additions and subtractions to my salad.  Even though my order was wrong because of a misscommunication, he totally handled it well and brought me the corrected order right away. Among the many complaints I have about Cheesecake Factory as a whole, I was really shocked to see that their menu no longer has the calorie counts on them.  Seeing their previous calorie counts made me not want to eat there but at least I knew what I was getting into.  Because I felt like I was going into ordering blind, I opted for a Grilled Chicken Salad W/ Mango (normally known as the Luau Salad?)  I was NOT happy with the portions of everything.  They give you ENORMOUS amounts of the fatty food but they are totally stingy with the healthy stuff.  The lettuce was plentiful but the mangoes were chopped up really finely so I probably was given only 2 tablespoons at the most.  I expected big chunks of mango.  It was actually more of a ""salsa"" which added a ton of flavor to the salad so it didn't need any dressing.  Same thing for the bell peppers.  Tiny portions.  The chicken was a little better but dry as all hell.  I can only assume that they cook it days before and freeze it, then thaw it out.  No flavor what-so-ever.   Their menu is so overwhelming!  Make sure to take a look at the menu before you go so you aren't sitting there stressed about having to decide. The appetizer was completely tasteless.  We ordered the mac and cheese and it was very bland.  Not impressed with it's flavor of the sauce it was in at all. My husband's entree, a chicken pasta thing, wasn't good at all.  WAY too spicy, yet it lacked flavor.  Again, he got a huge plate that he only ate about 1/4 of, which is the correct serving for one person.  The rest is now sitting in our fridge, collecting mold. Their wheat bread was good but they started giving the packets of butter.  I remember getting fresh butter not too long ago. I have also never been a fan of their cheesecake so dessert wasn't an option.  I once tried like 6 flavors and not one was good.  I totally had Goldilocks Syndrome.  Coconut was too sweet, chocolate was too dry, plain was too bland, strawberry was almost good but still not impressive.  For literally a Cheesecake Factory, I would expect that each cheesecake would be phenomenal but they always miss the bar.  I can only conjecture that they are not made fresh at the restaurant and are mass produced from a warehouse somewhere and delivered.  But I could be wrong.  It would explain the bland, been frozen too long taste. I think I may have just out grown these generic, corporate restaurants.  I like my food to be fresh, tasty and healthy.  You won't really find that here but it's a great place to meet up with people and have drinks after work or before a night out on the town.  Even then, there are hundreds of other restaurants that are actually good."
Neni E.,"San Francisco, United States",6,124,34,3.0,18/11/2012,"Had lunch with a friend here after the movies on Saturday. It was super busy, but we got seated within 30 min. after being told it was a 45 min. wait. We both order our drinks first. I'm on the verge of coming down with a cold....again....and needed something for my sore throat. Their cocktail menu listed a cocktail called Kentucky Tea (Wid Turkey whiskey, honey, and lemon) and it sounded just what I needed for this on-coming cold. We both were expecting the drinks to be in highball glasses, but they weren't. They were in these tall cocktail glasses (frou-frou drinks), but that was okay. It was yummy, but only kept it to one drink for me while my friend ordered another when she was done with hers.  So it's been a long time since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory to eat and  I know why. Not because the food is bad, but this location attracts a lot of tourists. Yeah, well, we were starving and didn't want to eat mall food or trek a long way, so opted for here. We both had burgers. I ordered the Cajun Burger (medium) with the fries while my friend had the BLT burger with blue cheese (?) and fries. I hadn't had a burger since before Lent this year, so needless to say, I devoured mine. The fries were pretty tasty too! Crispy. Just the way I like 'em! If my friend didn't eat hers, I would've finished them off too. My Cajun burger had andouille sausage and sauteed onions and bell peppers. No cheese on this particular burger, but that was okay. I'm lactose =). Nonetheless, my burger was delish and finished before my friend who only ate half of her burger. Oh, my burger was also on a brioche bun, which made it perfect!  For a chain restaurant, I had a pretty good experience for having my first burger here. It's only the second time I've had lunch here and I can't remember what I had the first time I ate here years ago. Oh, and of course, we ordered cheesecakes. My fave, Khalua for me and banana cream for her...to go though. I'd come back here to try one of their other burgers, but maybe when tourist season dies down =). Note sure if I'd try any of the other entrees, but their burgers, yes! Three stars because they need more seating area where people can wait to be called when a table is ready. Music selection could be better. Noise and too much crowding near the elevator and escalator while people are waiting for their tables."
Patrick T.,"Washington, DC, United States",336,836,1839,3.0,8/11/2012,"Never really liked cheesecake factory food. It's okay, nothing special. Really long waits -- they'll give you a buzzer and you can explore the mall downstairs.  Anyway, just look at the name of the restaurant; you come for the cheesecake. There are better dining options in the city for your real dinner. I would skip the dinner and just pick up dessert from the bar. Of course all of their cheesecakes are excellent. I prefer the snickers myself."
Alberto R.,"Alameda, United States",0,13,7,3.0,3/11/2012,"the wait is always toooooo long.  The food is average and the prices are ok.  You would assume that by now they'd get used to being busy so they would perform better, but the service still suffers.  We only saw our waiter once when he took our order and once when he brought the food and the last time he handed us the check."
Veronica N.,"San Francisco, United States",420,165,2,3.0,22/10/2012,"I really do love coming here for dinner and the atmosphere is amazing. Very comfortable, clean, friendly. Great for family and friends. The food is good and the service is great.  I did have one visit when the waiter attending us was extremely rude and seemed like he hated his job, but all the other waiters/waitresses from my other visits were phenomenal. They give amazing recommendations and are very familiar with the dishes. They also check up on you often to see if you need anything.  I've had the four-cheese pasta, mac and cheese burger, and several appetizers such as buffalo wings and of course a cheesecake for dessert.  If you're coming here just for the cheesecake, I wouldn't recommend it.The cheesecake is definitely good here, but there's better. On the plus side, they have a large variety of cheesecakes, so you are bound to find something you like.  The food is definitely well cooked, always served hot and well plated. The outside seating on the balcony is amazing at night and they do have heating vents to keep you warm.  I would say this place is more casual, not something you would have to dress up for.  I love the white-chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the white-chocolate chip one. One slice can definitely be split among two people. From all my past experiences I've never finished a whole slice with another person. We were all left full from the large portions of our main dishes + appetizers.  Skip the salads, they are very average and unless you find it a necessity I would pass this one up. There's nothing special about the salads and they fill you up before you even get to your food.  The food here isn't too amazing, given what you pay for it. I will likely come back again in the future."
Ivadine M.,"San Jose, United States",188,89,1,3.0,18/10/2012,"I guess you have to go on a non-busy day to get a friendly service here. I took my friend out for his birthday here, told our waiter that it was his birthday, all he said was ""okay"" he did surprise us with a cake and a candle, but can you show more enthusiasm? Over all, it was okay.. I wouldn't mind coming back, but it would have to be weekday."
Jane N.,"Millbrae, United States",332,196,215,3.0,16/10/2012,"Cheesecake Factory brings me back to my college days when I used to go monthly.  A tourist attraction since it's smack dab in Union Square in Macy's with an amazing view, I never felt the desire to go since I dislike crowds.  But since I haven't had it in over two years, was craving pasta, and it was such amazing weather, why not?   The wait is long of course but it's a sizeable restaurant.   People (specifically tourists) need to chill.  Don't come here if you're going to get mad at why people are standing around or if you're going to elbow your way to a good spot on the balcony.  It's just plain rude and you're just asking for death glares.  But if you do come expecting a wait, might as well grab a cocktail and go outside to look at the pretty lights (if you're going during dinner).  We got the Ahi Tuna Tartare app, Pasta da Vinci, and Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic (not pictured).  Pastas were good and heavy as usual but the app was delicious.  I only wish it came with more chips.  Of course, you can't miss out on their always wonderful brown bread."
Ashley S.,"Coquitlam, Canada",108,115,42,3.0,13/10/2012,"This was my first experience at a Cheesecake Factory and I had high expectations. I visited with a group of about 25 as we were in town to run the Nike Womens Marathon. It's a good thing we had a reservation because they were really lined up! I tried to order 3 different beers before I found one they had in stock. Kind of annoying...  I was very happy with my meal. I had the Crab and Artichoke dip and the Margherita flat bread (both on the menu as 'Small Plates' but either one on it's own could have filled me! The flat bread was the winner on taste. It was delicious. Unfortunately, when it came time for the bill all hell broke loose. Despite telling our server a needed separate bills, he did not do it (I was a server for 8 years and I know that, although a tad time consuming, it isn't hard and makes payment much simpler).  We had to wait an additional 20  minutes before he came back. So annoying! I'd be back for sure, just nor with more than 6 people."
Linda X.,"San Francisco, United States",658,195,35,3.0,11/10/2012,"Four Stars Came here for dessert after a sushi feast. Hot Chocolate and Tuxedo Cheesecake to share! Two Stars The wait is probably horrendous if your party's not down to sit around the bar.  Tips and Fun Facts Round tables near the bar is open-seating! They have really cool to-go cups for your hot drinks (I'm not a noob, they're seriously really cool)."
Phuong V.,"Oakland, United States",1078,405,48,3.0,20/9/2012,"This has got to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory out of all of CF's I have been to. San Francisco just gives you this amazing feeling that you are on vacation. It is located inside of a Macy's which makes it even better. Definitely a touristy area, so be prepared for a wait. The portions here are great, so someone small like me can never finish a whole plate of food. I can eat a third of it and the rest of the 2/3's  are taken home. It kinda sucks because by that time I am so full there is absolutely no room for dessert. Cheesecake is here is amazing, I don't think you can go wrong with any flavor. My favorite is the original with strawberry sauce. It is plain and simple with a hint of tartness from the ripe strawberries. Whenever my friends and I are in the city and we are indecisive with dinner venues, CF is safe choice.  Dishes I recommend.  1. You can't go wrong with any pasta dish 2. Chicken Madera (sp?) 3. Chicken and Dumplings  All very heavy dishes, no wonder I get full so fast!"
Jay A.,"Camino, United States",7,89,,3.0,16/9/2012,"Very, very long wait. Slow elevator to the restaurant, which is on the top floor. Take the escalators instead (just remember on the 7th floor, you have to do a 180 degree turn around and walk through the furniture dept. a bit to find the escalator up to floor 8).  Food was outstanding, service was mediocre, but is to be expected for such a busy location. Parking is nightmarish, and expensive. Be forewarned. Leave the car at home, if at all possible."
Steve Y.,"San Jose, United States",0,86,,3.0,12/9/2012,"This place is ok. We were kind of ignored by our servers though. The tex mex appetizer was pretty good, but my meatloaf was decent. The meat was kind of dry, not much sauce and the bottom was more oily than saucy. I dont think they even put any sauce over the meat.  The corn succotash was also kind of oily too.  This place is decent, but nothing makes it more special than other locations. Its on the 8th floor and it has a balcony that faces towards Union Square Park, but there is nothing much to see."
Jenny T.,"San Francisco, United States",59,128,101,3.0,8/9/2012,"The portions are huge! I came here around 1pm on a weekday for lunch and the wait for a table was only 15 minutes. Our waiter was excellent and friendly. The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice. There are tables available outdoors, but I only recommend choosing that if there is nice SF weather. If you want room for cheesecake at the end, I recommend sharing an entree with someone. My recommendations: - Renee's Special: I chose Chicken Almond Salad Sandwich and the sandwich was so delicious! This special is so huge because it comes with a big bowl of soup with a large portion of green salad. Besides the Chicken Salad Sandwich, you have the option of choosing Fresh Turkey Sandwich instead. - Chicken Bellagio: This dish was very good. I loved the taste of the basil pasta. The two pieces of crispy chicken was yummy. I can't wait until my next visit so I can try their cheesecake."
Kate C.,"San Francisco, United States",1,19,2,3.0,29/8/2012,"Same as all other cheesecake factory restaurants... but an hour long wait in line.  I love cheesecake factory food, but don't want to wait this long for it. Since I live 3 blocks away and don't have a car, this is the only one I can come............."
Christine B.,"Sacramento, United States",476,378,223,3.0,14/8/2012,"I would call cheesecake factory a good go to restaurant when you have a group of indecisive people. On a Friday night, my friends and I arrived at 530 for a table for 11. They had us wait 1 hr and 45 minutes, then once we were called we stood around for another 15. Seated at last at 730pm. Then orders were taken half an hour later, food in another half hour and we ere out of there by 1030. Be prepared for a long ordeal and experience when you come here. Don't come in a large group hungry! What I like about cheesecake is the consistency - this cheesecake even if they are packed - they deliver the same consistent food and service as any other packed Cheesecake would. The maximum for outside seating is groups of 6. if you're a large group - you're automatically put inside. ***DO NOT GIVE INTO EATING ALL THE BREAD IF YOU ARE STARVING AFTER TWO HOURS OF WAITING. YOU CAN HOLD ON LONGER SO YOU CAN EAT DINNER!!"
claudia y.,"San Francisco, United States",749,997,2370,3.0,9/8/2012,"we have been here before but felt like a big meal on a wednesday night so we went to cheesecake.   the elevators are slow.  take the escalator the wait is long.  if theres only two of you and the timing is right, wait for a seat in front of the bar. the portions are huge!  and the food is kind of salty  and fatty.  haha"
Satheene A.,"Albany, United States",0,68,,3.0,8/8/2012,"I really would have liked to give this place a better rating. Since we cannot make reservations (are they ever going to change this, it is SO annoying), we just showed up with my husband on a saturday night around 6.30pm. We were told it would be 1h20 wait. I really wanted to eat there, so we took a pager and went window-shopping around the block. After 1h20 we came back to the building and we were told we would be seated soon. My husband asked one of the hostesses if she knoew when was the last Bart train, she answered ""Just look it up on your smartphone"". He answered he did not have a smartphone. She gave him a look, then glanced at me and said with the most surprised look I've seen in a long time added to a smirk: ""neither of you has a smartphone??!"". We just said no. Casually. Because I really don't why we should. Not everyone is supposed to get the latest gadget just because his friends do. She answered ""well, I don't know then"". So we walked to the ""waiting area"" eagerly. FYI hostess: YOUR reaction in itself will make this our last visit to this location. About 30 min later we were finally seated. Table were too close from eachother. I could have reached in the plate of my neighbor easily. Of course, it was really noisy, but I was expecting this from the fact the restaurant was full.  MY food was great. Small plate of Fried zucchini with cheesy dip. Great. Not too greasy, a little crunchy, juicy, good size for a small plate (and $5) and great dip. My main was a chicken Marsala. It would have been big enough to share for sure. The sauce had a good flavor but was a little too watery. A slice of raspberry/white chocolate truffle for dessert: divine. Also had a good tropical smoothie; it was a little expensive for $6, but I guess that's Union Square.  Now my husband's food. First off he orders a Jack Daniel with Coke and I guess they used a new kind of transparent coke because there was none. We were both extremely surprised (and exchanged a look that was still not as expressive as the hostess') and I told him they must have forgotten. He did not want to call them back and have it exchanged. So we passed on to apps. He took fried the calamaris which was a huge platter of very greasy food. Too greasy. Then he ordered a steak Diane medium rare. It came out well over well-done. It was ridiculous how brown it was. Would it have been my steak, I would have sent it back immediately because there is no way I can eat something this cooked. He is far too nice and did not say anything. But he passed on dessert. The waiter came twice to our table  to tell us very weird jokes. I don;t know if he was trying to create a connection to get a better tip or if he was nervous but it was plain weird. Plus he came back only once (at mid-apps) to refill my husband's glass of water and was then left with an empty glass from the end of his apps to the end of the meal. That pissed him off so much he wanted to leave a 5% tip. My food was good so we ended up leaving an undeserved 20%. Thinking back, we could have left 5% since we are not coming back anymore.  I will now try the location at Walnut Creek. Maybe their hostess is less prejudiced and maybe they pay more attention to their food and customers since they might be less busy.  Disappointment."
Leslie Y.,"San Francisco, United States",245,650,585,3.0,4/8/2012,"I have been here a couple of times and now I remember why I usually head to Pleasanton...... The wait is crazy, service is slow and portions are smaller.......there, that tells all.... So touristy, which makes the wait unbearable......people are rude, even in the lines to get a number..... Service is slow cause they don't have enough people working, although my waiter was quite cool..... Portions were smaller than all the other ones I have been to......"
Dee A.,"Union City, United States",42,97,71,3.0,24/7/2012,"Located on the top floor of Macy's.  This location has a outdoor patio seating with the nice view of the city.  The wait time is ridiculously long at this Cheesecake Factory but it's worth it.  The food is great, the portions are huge, and they have the best wheat bread made fresh daily.   Chicken croquettes, and chicken samosa is my all time favorite at cheesecake.  Try it with ranch and tamerind cashew sauce!!"
