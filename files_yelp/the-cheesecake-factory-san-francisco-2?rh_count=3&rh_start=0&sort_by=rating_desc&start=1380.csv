Analyst C.,"San Mateo, United States",9,248,458,3.0,23/7/2012,It was ok for a Wednesday night dinner- the wait was about 10 minutes. I love the crab cakes and the artichoke crab dip-!  If you're watching your waistline--don't come here!
Sandy B.,"Ventura, United States",100,23,17,3.0,19/7/2012,"To be honest the Cheesecake Factory used to be in my top 5 but no longer. Some dishes are still great but some are now terrible.  I have always loved the decoration, though we have had to complain about the service at least half the time in recent visits. Some of the problems. They forgot to put the chicken in a salad, also it is always too noisy."
Gina Y.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",1594,175,1044,3.0,14/7/2012,"I love their salmon rolls. Their plates are huge. However, I can't stand the long wait to get a table."
Denise L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",3229,523,3736,3.0,13/7/2012,"Your standard Cheesecake Factory. Food is awesome, portions are huge, the wait is forever. But the cheesecake is always so good. For this particular location, I'd say the wait (even with the superb cheesecake) is NOT worth it. The lines are ridiculous, especially during the holidays, and you have to deal with all the street traffic to get into Macy's. Check out one in another location; they have parking lots and waits under an hour. I swear!"
Chelsea B.,"San Francisco, United States",50,49,17,3.0,10/7/2012,"i dont understand why i should wait til my ice from my cup melts to get a damn refill.  it is always super crowded in this place which is no surprise, its only in the largest damn macy's I've ever been in.  i liked the food, but not the fact i didn't get a refill to wash it down with."
David L.,"San Francisco, United States",109,123,156,3.0,9/7/2012,"This place is super packed... full of tourists since it's in Union Square. If you are looking for something quiet, that's not the place to go. I give it 3 starts because the portion are big and prices are relatively good."
Janine R.,"Calgary, Canada",175,644,160,3.0,3/7/2012,"Wow this restaurant is busy! Thank goodness our hotel called ahead of time and bumped us up on the waiting list. I didn't find the food that great. It was average, and that's why I'm giving them an average rating. They have really good cheesecake and delicious bread, but the entree was so-so. The service was incredibly slow, it's a good thing we were on vacation or I would have probably been more upset.  I don't know if this restaurant is worth the hour wait to get in....."
Sam B.,"Santa Clara, United States",194,818,933,3.0,25/6/2012,I will never wait more than 30 minutes for a table in any restaurant (period). They might have good food with huge portion but it is not worth the wait at a crowded restaurant. I am giving them 3 stars because Cheesecake is really awesome especially the low carb. We usually have them to go and eat the Cheesecake at Crissy Field.
LoLa L.,"San Francisco, United States",59,104,14,3.0,20/6/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is for inexpensive, decent-quality dining.. .. I do like to have lunch on the outside patio, especially on a nice San Francisco day when you wanna get away from your desk and go a little further to eat and not at the sandwhich/salad place that you usually go to around the corner from your job.. ..but I had a suuuppperrr cool waiter, this time and she made the experience fun and the tab high because we really enjoyed our service and the food, so we ordered more and more.. in addition, it was my cousin graduation so we had a party of 35+, I felt like we took over half of the restaurant lol.. ..The drinks were a little watered down, but I still felt a buzz so I didnt complain, that's all I wanted.. not to be wasted, that's what the bar and karaoke is for, lol.. ..make sure to get a cheescake before you leave, or atleast a slice!"
Aja S.,"Pinole, United States",8,29,,3.0,18/6/2012,"SO my friend and I decided to come here to have lunch....well more like ""hors d'oeuvre"" during lunch hours. By the time we reached the restaurant, the place was already packed!!!! As for drinks I started with a passion fruit mojito, and whats ""special"" about it is that it happens to be my first time trying it. When I first sipped into that drink of goodness, I immediately blown away on how delicious it tasted! it was fresh, minty, cool, tropical, sweet, and tarty..this wont be last time ordering it ever again. Ok I'm gonna stop raving about mojitos :)         Appetizers and Small Snacks was what we ordered just because we wanted lots of variety! and indeed we did get lots of variety. As a matter of fact we ordered so much variety that it filled up the table (that takes up 4 people space wise). In no particular order we ordered their buffalo chicken wings, that were covered in some tobasco like hot sauce. It also comes with a blue cheese dressing, and I HATE blue cheese so we asked to have ranch instead. However after dipping celery (came with the wings) in this so called ""ranch"" I realized it wasn't ranch at all, but BLUE CHEESE DRESSING!!  I was like ""nooo! tip reduction!!""...-joking- I just let it slip by and besides it saved me a few calories right?? chicken wings in general were alright nothing to jump up and down about.   Vietnamese tacos were delish! the pork, and the pickled vegetables make a perfect couple. Only I wish the pork was tender, instead it was stringing and a little dry. Artichoke and Crab was alright, I tasted better at other places. It was a little bland, with too much cheese and actually spotted a blot of cream cheese in the middle of the dip. I guess I can now say so that's part of their ingredient to making it creamy. Last but not least, Fried Calamari! Out of all the dishes we ordered my favorite was the fried calamari! it came with cocktail sauce, and some mayo/lemon/dill sauce. Calamari tasted fresh even though they were most likely frozen, I even spotted some cute little small tentacle calamari babies which I was pretty amused to see. Batter over it was bland, without the sauces my palate would've eaten dead bland calamari minions."
Suabot J.,"San Francisco, United States",21,75,,3.0,7/6/2012,big portion of food but I'm not a big fan of the food taste. Vegas feel atmosphere and the cheesecakes are awesome.
Robert F.,"Berkeley, United States",3,20,,3.0,30/5/2012,"If it wasn't for the strawberry cheesecake and the view, it wouldn't be worth the wait"
Eugen X.,"San Francisco, United States",2,5,,3.0,30/5/2012,"Today I went here for lunch with a group of 4 including me. I had the chicken picatta ,  the noodles came a little cold when I got it but the sauce was good. My friend had the build your own omelet and she said it was good. friend say the Tomato Basil pasta was really tasty and the sauce was just tangy enough. Four cheese pasta was lacking in sauce where the cheese overpowers everything she had.  PORTIONS ARE HUGE and when you get pasta u can have free fresh parmesan grated on top.  3/5 PS : waits are really long"
Rosie W.,"San Jose, United States",381,448,268,3.0,17/5/2012,"One of my favorite Cheesecakes Factory's. I rarely ever come here because it's always packed and I'm never in the mood to wait a couple of hours to eat. But every so often, I'll come here with an out of town friend. It's a neat location - located at the top floor of downtown sf Macy's. There's an outdoor section that overseas Union Square. They give you these page devices that have a pretty big range so you can shop around in Macy's until it goes off. On a nice day, it's cool to sit outside in the outdoor patio, but most of the time its cold and windy (but they have heated lamps!)"
Bonnie G.,"The Haight, San Francisco, United States",49,44,8,3.0,11/5/2012,"You'll wait forever for a menu too full of options and get a seat near really loud people from Georgia and stuff your face with tasty but basic foods that cost too much. Yep, they have cheese cake that tastes like it came from a factory. The outdoor seating that looks over Union Square will impress your Grandad visiting from Wyoming. Great for tourists, nothing special for foodies or natives."
Jackie M.,"San Francisco, United States",148,259,108,3.0,7/5/2012,"3 stars just for the food itself. I love the vast choices I can pick. I have my favorites though, the chicken madeira, miso salmon, sundried tomatoes fettucini, and lemoncello torte for dessert. Any of these things will definitely fulfill any cravings that I have.  Other than the food, Cheesecake factory isn't really all that. When it isn't crowded it's awesome, but when there is a wait, it's absolutely dreadful! On top of that the service is definitely lacking. I've come here a million times and never have I had outstanding service. My most recent visit here was last week where our waiter was basically a ghost!  Another thing that repels me from coming here is the calories in the food. I'm no calorie counter, but damn, when I look at those numbers I get kind of scared."
Stephanie M.,"San Francisco, United States",561,285,82,3.0,25/4/2012,"There's nothing more sad than overly positive Yelp reviews of a Cheesecake Factory. I have never seen such a big novel..I mean..menu before, you can seriously eat anything here. In the history of the Cheesecake Factory's existence, there is ALWAYS a wait and tourists everywhere, but that's why they make them in malls. You could spend like up to two hours shopping and then return. If not you can chill in the balcony and snap tourist pictures. I've been coming here for years, I almost never save room for dessert because everything is so big. When I do, I usually go straight for the cheesecakes: Strawberry, Red velvet, Godiva Chocolate, Cookie Dough, Snickers, Pumpkin, and the million other flavors that are to die for! Man, that made me hungry.."
Stephanie C.,"San Francisco, United States",923,479,238,3.0,20/4/2012,"I've been here so many times I've lost count. This was the place to be in high school and I feel like everyone threw their birthday dinners here. The Cheesecake Factory offers an extremely extensive menu filled with anything you could possibly think of and quite a list of cheesecakes! Since I've gotten older, and presumably wiser ;), I've stayed away from chain restaurants. However, every now and then I get a craving for an club sandwich with fries and an iced tea. That's where the Cheesecake Factory comes in. They have such a delicious Club Sandwich! The bread is fresh, the bacon is crispy, and the fries have just the right amount of salt. Their tropical, or passion fruit, iced tea is so refreshing! Definitely one of my favorites. Their cheesecake is delicious but sometimes can be too sweet. You can't go wrong with a slice of the Original! It's really creamy and the sour cream frosting on top is amazing. So why only 3 STARS? The wait to eat here is always AT LEAST 2 hours long! There's hardly enough space to sit and wait, unless you find a spot in Macy's furniture department where the sales reps won't tell you to move, and did I mention the wait time?! Plus, can you really give over 3 STARS to a chain restaurant? With as many delicious and higher quality restaurants in this city, the Cheesecake Factory doesn't really stand out but in terms of consistency and variety they're good in my book!"
Gary N.,"Chattanooga, United States",3299,650,2151,3.0,20/4/2012,"Beautiful location. Sat outside on a nice night with heat lamps. Great view.  5 Stars for location and view.  But!!! Service was poor at best. Ordered a drink and waited about 20 minutes, 10 minutes for a refill.  This was late so it was not packed so no reason to be this poor."
Tina F.,"San Francisco, United States",281,106,,3.0,17/4/2012,"Super busy which is pretty obnoxious,but it's a great location with a beautiful view. I like to go during the winter to look out onto the Union Square ice skating rink. Cheesecake is amazing and there is an extensive menu filled with many options."
