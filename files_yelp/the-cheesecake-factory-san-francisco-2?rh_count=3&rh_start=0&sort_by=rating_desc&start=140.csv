Jaiesha C.,"Vallejo, United States",18,53,47,5.0,14/2/2015,"Today my fiancé and I celebrated Valentine's Day at Cheesecake Factory, Union Square! The wait was only 15 mins when we arrived at 1:15pm and got our pager. Once we were seated, My fiancé and I ordered our drinks. He ordered a Piña Colada, I ordered Pineapple Mojito (which was very good) and Passion Fruit Tea. For our food orders, we had the Avocado Rolls ( they are so delicious; thanks yelp reviews), my fiancé had the Everything Pizza (delicious) and I had my Southern Chicken Sliders (from my previous review). Our server name was Lynn; awesome customer service! After we ate, we bought some cheesecake to go! My fiancé he the Red Velvet Cheesecake and Key Lime. I had the Oreo Extreme Cheesecake; all three are delicious but the Oreo Extreme is very rich in chocolate, so be cautious if you decided to try the Oreo Extreme. Overall we had a great day; happy Valentine's Day!!"

Salem M.,"Citrus Heights, United States",45,52,8,5.0,25/1/2015,Packed Saturday night. Was told wait time would be 45 minutes. Waited about thirty minutes as I did some shopping. So wait time was no biggie :-) server was on point. Ordered a big Caesar salad as an app for my friends and I and it came within five minutes after ordering! Was pleasantly happy with that. Food came about twenty minutes later and it was delicious!! I recommended the chipotle chxn pasta!!   .. Love this place!
Cassie B.,"Riverside, United States",56,18,6,5.0,31/12/2014,"Going in on this dining experience, I actually had a really good experience contrary to most of the reviews I read. I knew there would be a ridiculous wait (esp. with all the holiday shoppers), so I checked in early and came back when they told us (2 people) to do so and we were immediately seated. The place was completely swamped and just mad crazy when we returned but we still got the seats I requested - Outside, under a heat lamp. We had the nicest waiter, who was constantly checking in on us and got us everything we needed. We didn't have to wait long for food and it all tasted great! I'll definitely be returning :)"
Samuel G.,"East Los Angeles, United States",48,5,4,5.0,23/12/2014,"We had a great experience here. Our server Anthony was very attentive. The seared ahi in the tuna salad was perfectly done, garlic pasta had a super tasty sauce, and the cheesecake was perfect. Love the location too."
Nicholas F.,"Roseville, United States",205,39,,5.0,18/12/2014,After a long workout my friend and I were very hungry and decided to walk to Chipotle but last minute cravings switched our plan to the Cheesecake Factory and let me tell you it was the best decision of the day. We arrived to the sixth floor wonderland of goodness to a disappointing twenty minute wait but were immediately informed of the bar seating option and since it was open seating we just sat there.  From the moment we sat down we were offered amazing service from the female bartender Ashwani. She brought us a sample of the delightful corn chowder and from then on gave us samples of almost every drink she was making. She was pleasant and served is fast with attention to detail. It may not be the classiest of restaurants but Ashwani made it the best dining service I've experienced in SF since I moved here two years ago.  We will be back!  PS. The chicken Balagio is tasty but serve a little less pesto noodles is all I have to say.
Ruby P.,"Kent, United States",2,189,43,5.0,17/12/2014,"Everything at cheesecake factory can be summed up In one word.. delish Breakfast is really really good, the potatoes were yummy!!! Love the fried mac & cheese balls . The chicken Madeira is bomb , love the oreo cheesecake , and the fudge cake,  along with good customer service"
Cher L.,"Jacksonville, United States",0,9,,5.0,16/12/2014,"Not only was our food amazing but when my husband spilled his wine, our dear waiter Peter..took it off our bill....we will continue to come here as long as we live!!"
Joakim A.,"Umeå, Sweden",2,9,,5.0,10/12/2014,"If you like a big bomb of delicious cheesecake- this is the place. Go here hungry, and leave full of energy!"
Gong L.,"Union City, United States",12,29,,5.0,4/12/2014,Every time I go to Cheesecake factory I have to wait for a long time but I personally think is worth it.
Hannah Y.,"Oakland, United States",5,106,730,5.0,25/11/2014,"YES YES YESSSS. I love Cheesecake Factory. OKAY OKAY OKAY... it's not exactly a michelin star franchise, but for what it is, it's FIVE STARS. It's the bread, the butter, the HUMUNGOUS selection of desserts, appetizers, entrees, drinks, etc etc etc... endless selection of every culture and all wrapped up in a great setting. The view at the very top of SF Macy's building is outstanding, ESPECIALLY during the holidays. The huge tree right smack in the middle of Union Square, the lightings and decorations during the day and darky nights... all of it... I want to infuse my mind and body with all that I can possibly consume with my eyes. The service is soooo ridiculously attentive, and super duper nice. I don't care if they're paid to solely kiss my ass with fake smiles, and 'what else do you need miss?' WHY? Because sometimes a girl just wants to dine and feel nothing but bliss bliss bliss.  The wait is long, but when you're in Macy's with a beeper that will notify you when it's your turn to plug yourself in the Cheesecake Factory Circus of FUN, you can travel via the escalators and just browse with interest, and for me, not with intent to purchase, but just to see with glee. What I love to eat during my special plug in slot time at the tempting layers of choices given at Cheesecake Factory, are the crispy cold caesar salad with gunks of chunky raw garlic, and the chicken lettuce wraps with the three dips. Also, the cheesy dips that act like fondue are spectacular. I always ask for fresh chunky tomato salsa to add a cold refreshing factor to this hot cheesy dip. I miss my frequent visits when I used to live in San Francisco. I should definitely go back during christmas this year!"
Erika C.,"Sacramento, United States",22,129,46,5.0,13/11/2014,Came here this past Tuesday to have dinner. Wait time was only 30min which was surprisingly great considering the large crowd already inside! There were 4 of us & decided to last minute invite my aunt to come eat with us since she worked close by. Our waiter was very accommodating to our request & added the table next to us.  Our waiter was extremely attentive & very nice! Food & drinks were great! It was definitely 5 star service that night!
Carlos B.,"San Francisco, United States",9,8,3,5.0,28/10/2014,"One of my favorite places in San Francisco! AMAZING FOOD! everything on the menu is incredibly good and on top of that, they have THE most amazing mojitos i have tried in San Francisco. 100% recommended."
Katy D.,"Palo Alto, United States",469,93,224,5.0,23/10/2014,"Cheesecake factory is hands down ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS! I know it's a corporate restaurant so that is why it gets lower stars on reviews. Yes, the wait is ALWAYS long. Always guaranteed an hour wait AT LEAST. But I think it is worth it, espicially in this location because you can see Union Square. I love San Francisco, even though I come here so often, but it NEVER gets old. The holidays are the best times here, even though it does get crowded. Their brown sweet molasses bread is the BEST, and so is the sourdough. I love ALL their pastas. The top pastas for me are: pasta da vinci, Cajun Jambalaya. Another great dish is the Chicken Marsala with Madiera wine sauce which is to die for!! Definitely worth trying, and DO save room for the Red Velvet Cheesecake, the BEST cheesecake I have ever had! Very moist red velvet cake with moist cheesecake and white chocolate pieces on the side. PERFECTION!"
Angela S.,"Oakland, United States",71,14,35,5.0,12/10/2014,"The Stake Diane is my absolute favorite and that new ""Lemon Meringue"" Cheesecake is so good."
Amora B.,"Richmond, United States",0,8,6,5.0,10/10/2014,Try the the shrimp pasta. mMMMMmm delicious!!
Tasha S.,"San Francisco, United States",85,27,99,5.0,10/10/2014,"Sit at the bar, and witness Marissa tending to her customers with more love and finesse and kindness than anyone you've ever experienced! She exhibits grace and thoughtfulness in every action in her preparation of your beverages and interaction behind the bar! It's a joy to watch her."
Macie B.,"Eureka, United States",32,13,9,5.0,8/10/2014,"Love, love, love Ahi Carpacchio....but might order something new. It's only a 10min wait for our table at 6pm!"
