Joshua L.,"San Francisco, United States",734,213,10,3.0,12/4/2012,"The Costco of chain restaurants. The wait is forever, the servings are all enormous, and you always end up buying (and spending) more than you really need to. Love it or hate it. USEFUL TIP: If the wait is 30-45 minutes or longer, try the bar. If your party is 4 or less, you can most usually find a seat and they offer the same table service in the bar, except with no reservations!"
Anthony V.,"Hayward, United States",147,179,,3.0,8/4/2012,I really enjoyed this place. I received good service and enjoyed my food. Also you get a great view if you decide to eat outdoors. It is really nice. Beware of the long lines since they don't take reservations. Don't eat here if you want to grab a quick bite of food.
Monica R.,"Benicia, United States",0,5,,3.0,1/4/2012,"Yum!! but i always feel because i'm a student, i get passed over for good service. And the last time i went, they totally were skimpy on the food :/ service has truly slipped!"
Gaby J.,"San Diego, United States",317,194,218,3.0,30/3/2012,"3 1/2 stars Great view. Okay food. LONG WAITING TIME. Took over an hour to seat two people. Maybe, its due to the holidays, but it certainly wasn't helping their case when my friend who had waited in line was cut by another person, who didn't even say sorry, and more surprisingly was the fact that the server who witness the whole thing didn't even bother to tell the lady that what SHE did was capital R U D E. Eating at cheesecake factory, feels like participating in the Hunger Games.  Death to each comrade until one remains having the trophy or in this case a seat for two. Anyway, after an hour waiting for food, I was expecting a spectacular meal. I was also getting an alcoholic milkshake to appease my hunger as well as numb my anger and frustration. The alcohol milkshake was okay. It was just milkshake mixed with flavored vodka. And the food? Not worth the hour wait.  But, the balcony seating is wonderful and very romantic. And the pigeons who perched there are very fat and cute. Some of them was eating the crumbs off the floor which made me laugh. Although, the servers did shoo them out after a minute or so. Overall, I would prefer not to go here on a crowded day as it was very exhausting and overwhelming, but that's just my two cents."
Kevin J.,"San Francisco, United States",2508,873,340,3.0,13/3/2012,"Cheese and Cake - somehow separately you wouldn't pair them together and think it was a great combination, but somehow when this fanciful dessert comes together mouths open from far and wide. The Cheesecake Factory dishes out some LARGE portions, so the bang for the buck is bar-none. This particular location is extra special.  Located in the heart of downtown San Francisco on top of Macy's in Union Square - the view alone is worth the trip... and the wait.   If you get the chance be sure to check out the outside patio for the best view.  The Vegetable Salad with Chicken happens to be my favorite thing on the gargantuan menu, but the fried mac & cheese balls.... YUMMY!"
Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, United States",355,482,337,3.0,12/3/2012,"Been here several times for dinner, and the line is always horrendous, can be 2+ hours.  I went here the first time for dessert though, and it was such a nice change!  First off, it was quiet (10:30pm).  I arrived first in my party, and I asked how long the wait would be.  They offered seating me now or whenever we all arrived, no wait!!!   Tons of cheesecake to select from, and tons of drinks to choose from, which can be a good and bad thing.  It took me forever to finally decide.  The nice thing was the waitress gave us their infamous brown bread (has oats on top which make it sweet!) which was nice to munch on while deciding. I liked my Peach blended drink, but I didn't taste any alcohol in it =/  it was delicious but not sure if it was worth the $10.50.  Got cheesecake  (30th anniversary) which I enjoyed.  Our waitress was hilarious - she gave us the wrong # of boxes, then one of my friends decided to eat the rest of his cheesecake.  The waitress said, ""He's gonna go big, then go home.""  Haha! I know the staff has always dressed this way, but I find the all white top/bottoms and shoes to be quite tacky."
Aryan O.,"Long Beach, United States",111,537,26,3.0,2/3/2012,"For just taking a day trip in San Francisco I was hoping to hit up Yelp and just find some hidden gems to eat, but was outnumbered and had to settle for this. I mean, don't get me wrong, Cheesecake Factory is a good establishment, it's just where I come from it is too common and I wanted something different. Well the food was good, I always get the Jambalaya and what not. The side order Mac and Cheese is really good as well, not too heavy. The Mac and Cheese Burger is off the hook as well as the BBQ burger (always get your burger medium rare). Luckily the rain had passed and that the sun peeked through, we ended staying outside. Forgot to mention to find this place you need to take the elevator to the 6th floor. The view from outside was really nice."
Fatty A.,"San Francisco, United States",233,1805,12,3.0,28/2/2012,This place is always freakin busy.  The last time I came the food took over 30 minutes to come out.  Thats cool if they are slow but its not cool when the food is overcooked.  The pasta was mushy as shit.  Lame.  The last time I was here we were seated on the patio and some black guys started making a scene.  One of the black dudes was complaining there was a hair in his food and he obviously pulled the race card saying they got hair in their food cuz they was black.  He started cussing and causing the other people in the restaurant to be uncomfortable so they just comped their entire meal and gave them a gift certificate to come back.  I wish I were black so I can get me some free food.  :(
simon c.,"San Francisco, United States",31,45,,3.0,26/2/2012,"Food is great. Service is decent but the wait... well you get the point.  The view from the balcony is amazing... really awesome for a 3rd + date. Like all Cheesecake factories they don't skimp on the proportions. Overall good restaurant... that is if you want to wait, and I hate waiting."
Ashley P.,"San Francisco, United States",54,93,10,3.0,23/2/2012,"I've been here a number of times- with the guy and with family and friends.  The thing about this place...it's food IS good, but you need to know when to go. Being that we're in SF, and this CF is located in Union Square...nighttime/weekends are ALWAYS packed. I've waited 90 minutes before for a table. Lunchtime is much better in terms of waiting. Despite the wait time, I've never encountered a rude or unpleasant waiter/ress. The staff is usually pretty prompt and attentive- amazing, considering how slammed they always are. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer is PDA. Try it! They also make a mean Long Island Iced Tea, IMO. Overall, this place is nice to go to periodically- but there's so many other places out there to explore with shorter wait times and diverse selections. :)"
Max H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,30,,3.0,21/2/2012,"The food here are great especially the CHEESE CAKES! but don't go during 5-7pm cuz u gonna wait FOREVER! no joke!  OH yea and the restroom, so so so so so small( i don't know the female one tho). 3 stars for this restaurant, good enough."
Penelope V.,"Concord, United States",62,77,,3.0,13/2/2012,"I only come to this Cheesecake Factory when my boyfriend's family is visiting SF. I came here last night with a party of 5 adults and 3 babies in high chairs. Maybe it was the weather or maybe it was Sunday, not sure but the wait was not bad at all.. it's usually 30-45 min wait with all the tourists. We told the hostess we needed 3 high chairs, she said she's make it work. We got to our table which was a booth... no high chairs... ummmmmmm... okay... so we had to wait for another table to be cleaned. The waiter brought our bread and some fruit for the kids which was very nice. After the waiter took our order and we settled in with drinks and get to catching up. After a little while we noticed the tables around us were all getting their food.. even though we had been there longer and our party sizes were relatively the same since the kids didn't order anything.  I wanted to order the meatloaf, i just love meatloaf and it's actually not bad here. Instead i tried something different and ordered the pork chops... which were fine except for the apricot glaze. I hate warm fruit... so maybe it really was good.. but I was not a fan. the mashed potatos and the spinach is always good here. Overall.... for a tourist spot, this place is decent... if you don't mind the loud hustle and bustle. I dont come here often but don't mind it the few times I come with visiting relatives. On a regular basis.. not so much."
May B.,"Los Altos, United States",138,116,,3.0,7/2/2012,"The portions are HUGE. Even when I order the salads, (who gets full on salads??), well this place will make you full even on salad!! Make sure you don't stuff yourself and leave room for dessert. Their cheesecake is pretty good - again, take home box please :)"
Erik L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,31/1/2012,"This is my first time ever at The Cheesecake Factory, and it was exactly like the way others described it here. I didn't know the wait would be so long!  They took at least 30 minutes to get my order.  I was seated at the patio and i sat there waiting, waiting, waiting. At least the view was beautiful, it was so lovely and you felt like an important person for just a second.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and i thought it was ok.  Nothing memorable or amazing about it. I wouldn't order that again. overall, it was just an average experience for me.  i felt the servers just weren't attentive or nice.  The food could've been better too, and the wait was just way too long."
Emily W.,"San Francisco, United States",136,186,43,3.0,27/1/2012,"I think the wait just takes away EVERYTHING.  I only go there when I get too lazy while shopping in downtown.  - The Wait -  The infamous wait is usually 45 min according to them, but you have to add at least 30+ minutes to that..  - Food -  The food is alright.  It's a chain restaurant so there is not much to say about it.  I once ordered their ""special"" Pillsbury Steak.  I didn't really know what it was and the waiter did not explain at all.  What I got was.. actually less than a Pillsbury steak.. It was comparable to my high school cafeteria meat loaf.   The Cheesecake is a must-order item, but it's one of those things that I would just take one bite and be done with.  It's way to sweet and way too expensive for a slice of heartattack. - Staff - I once requested a ""window"" seat outside on the balcony and my waiter said yes and later let others take the table I was supposed to get...   - View -  Very good view from the balcony."
Queen E.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,3.0,26/1/2012,"Even though i like the food here, I feel like the portions are just way too big. I often never get to finish my entree. I suggested splitting with a friend. Because I get full, I don't even have the room to try one of their cheesecakes. This place is expensive so I suggest bringing some cash with you."
Serene H.,"San Pablo, United States",92,137,42,3.0,25/1/2012,"Had dinner here on a Saturday evening with my co workers. Beautiful scenery from the top outdoors. Friendly, but could be friendlier service. And good food :)  We walked in, to be told that there will be an hour wait for a table indoors. We really really really wanted to eat there so we said okay, we'll wait. Maybe pass time by walking around the city, yeah? But then they told us that if we wanted to sit outdoors, they had a table ready. So we accepted the table and went on our way.  The first thing I noticed while outside were the wonderful heaters to keep us warm :) I was so thankful for those. Had they not had them, we'd definitely be freezing.  We had about 15 mins to look through the menu, the waiter came around once to ask if we were ready to order. And no we were not, but some drinks would've been nice. This waiter did not ask if we would like anything to drink while waiting. Thumbs down.  My coworkers ordered the orange chicken, and pasta fettuccini. And I ordered the jambalaya pasta. Everyone was pretty satisfied with their food. Portions were huge so we had to pack some to go.  But right after! Another downside: my co worker found traces of food/soap residue on her glass for water. Disgusting. I'd hope they check their glasses before giving them out next time.  Dessert!! I had the ultimate red velvet cheesecake, my workers had the strawberry cheesecake, and the hershey cheesecake. One word: fantastic.  Overall pretty good visit. We had a good time. The bad evened out with good. I'll be back, but next time I know what to look for."
Hailen T.,"Colma, United States",45,6,,3.0,12/1/2012,"The food's good is worth the money you pay, but my biggest complaint would be the wait. In other words, this is NOT the place to go if you and your friends just decided on the spot where to go and eat. To sum it up, this is what local high school students would think as being ""semi-fancy"" (since I used to be one of them). In terms of quality of food, it's not bad, but nothing to get exited about either.  As for being a Cheesecake Factory, fans of the food item can rejoice since they offer a WIDE variety of cheesecakes. However, they do tend to overload it with whipped cream. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but like the rest of the food they serve, it's worth your money....but is it worth the wait is another matter entirely. Around 5pm or before is probably the ideal time since they don't take reservations. Any later, they tend to get packed even on random days of the week. For the lucky, 30 minutes or less. For the unlucky, 1 hour or more (not kidding and on special occasions, 2 hours)"
Patrick V.,"San Diego, United States",20,49,84,3.0,9/1/2012,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of Macy's across from Union Square.  Seating options are indoor and outdoor.  There is usually a bit of a wait for a table depending on the time, you can call in advance to reserve.  Otherwise, you could end up waiting anywhere from 10-20 minutes. I personally prefer to sit indoors due to my paranoia of birds and bird droppings.  If the normally overcast sky of San Francisco is clear, this is a good outdoor dining area that will also give you a good view of the city. The food quality is pretty good.  Good ingredients, prepared well.  The style of food here is varied but does not stray too far from classic recipes.  There are traditional American dishes on the menu like Burgers, Meatloaf, Rotisserie Chicken, etc things that you would expect to see on a 'chain restaurant' menu but you will also see things like Fish Taco's,  Orange Chicken and Sheppards Pie on the menu.  The portions are HUGE!  I'm talking fat American size portions.  They do offer something they call ""lunch size"" portions on some of the dishes but most of them are way too big to finish in one sitting.  They have a full bar on one side of the restaurant. Prices are reasonable considering the amount of food.  I've never made it to desert which is a shame because their cheescakes and deserts look really good. Bathroom was clean and well kept!  Trust me, thats important.  You can tell a lot about a restaurant by seeing how well their bathroom is kept."
Elaine W.,"San Francisco, United States",142,324,139,3.0,8/1/2012,"In the handful of times I've gone here with coworkers, friends, family...our experiences are always 50/50. The cheesecakes alone deserve 5 stars (my fave is the red velvet), service is a 3 on a good day, and the rest of the menu can range from 1 to 4. On our last visit, we went for Sunday brunch round 11am. Got two salmon platters, a coffee, and a mint sweet tea. The salmon platter was very well presented...smoked salmon slices, greens, tomatoes & onion, a scoop of cream cheese and a bagel. Everything was good except for the bagel which was not toasted and was rock hard/stale. We ended up asked for a basket of their complimentary sourdough and oat bread instead. The coffee was extremely watered down...evidenced in the glass cup it was served in - it looked more like tea than coffee. The mint tea was refreshing...I'm thinking of opting out of the sweetener next time cause it was too syrupy. Free refills were offered on both drinks...I thought it funny that the coffee was the same price as the mint tea $3.25...that's more like the price of a latte! On future visits I will skip the coffees and simple beverages and go for the mimosas and other cocktails. Also, if you dine here during the day, unless it's windy out, definitely opt for outside seating where you can get a great view of Union Square."
