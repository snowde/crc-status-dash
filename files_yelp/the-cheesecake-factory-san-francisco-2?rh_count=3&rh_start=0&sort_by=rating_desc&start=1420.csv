Denton S.,"St George, United States",9,36,,3.0,5/1/2012,"Was not the best one we've been to, but it was better than most restaurants still. They were lean on cheesecakes when we went, but the food was still pretty good. They have outdoor seating but not for large groups. We had good staff, and they took great care of us. The wait was not bad, and they took our strollers for us and put them in a secure area so that we would not have to worry about them. Would have been better if we could have connected to wifi while waiting"
Adam F.,"Las Vegas, United States",20,9,,3.0,3/1/2012,"I really like this place a lot and like to meet up with friends here every time I'm in San Francisco. In the warmer months it's nice to sit on the patio which overlooks Union Square, one of my favorite places in San Francisco to kill time or just hang out. The menu is absolutely GINORMOUS; if you're not careful you could easily get caught up for 30 minutes just figuring our what you want to order. In the cooler months I like sitting at their bar, having a few strong cocktails and people watching. No matter who your bartender is they consistently make a pretty mean mojito, one of my go to favorites. So why only three stars? It really is a three star restaurant by Yelp standards; this place is A-OK. The food is decent and they're a fast paced tourist trap. I've never had a dish here that blows my mind, but I've never had a bad plate of food either. The servers are always a little rushed, which is to be expected, but never rude and I almost never have to ask for anything twice or water refills. Bottom line; great place to hang out and have some food and drinks, especially compared to the pricier options in the Union Square area, which offer a far superior product with a price point to match."
Nhung T.,"Oakland, United States",208,773,,3.0,3/1/2012,"This place was super crowded, but I was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. As always, the food was good. I had the Caesar salad with chicken, it was really yummy and the dressing was light (3.5 stars). I also had the chicken salad sandwich; didn't like it too much. Think a tuna sandwich might tasted better but it was decent.. I love their white raspberry truffle cheesecake, my favorite. I can get an entire pie!!"
Anthony N.,"San Francisco, United States",96,165,139,3.0,2/1/2012,"The only reason why I ate here was because my parents wanted to come. I would never come here myself because I think the wait is ridiculous and the food is not worth the wait. I went on a Thursday night and the wait time was 2 hours...  The food here is what is expected of a Cheesecake Factory. The basically serve everything you can think of and their ""special"" is about 2 pages long. Not a good place for those who are indecisive. The portion is extremely large and can get two average people. The food overall is good but not great and I do not think it is ever worth the wait."
michelle h.,"Oakland, United States",30,202,180,3.0,30/12/2011,"This location is just a-okay. I love their buffalo blast & ceasar salad. Once I came with bf, and they ran out of the buffalo blast! The wait can be a little frustrating...since there are so many people and shoppers! I like to put my name in for a table and grabbing the pager with me, and go shopping first. I go back upstairs 15 minutes from the time they tell you, and walahhhh the wait is over! Service wise...was just okay. They don't pay much attention to you since they have so many people...you kinda need to waive them down to get something. I prefer the Pleasanton location over this..I think the food tastes better there, and that the service is better."
Giving Sincere K.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",88,135,,3.0,30/12/2011,"I had lunch here yesterday with a friend.  Christmas Crazy SF, right!!! But I got there early and asked if I could reserve a table for noon.  They took my reservation.  I met my friend and got there late 12:15-12:20.  But they took care of us!  We sat down with less than 5 minute wait!  WOW!  Impressive.   This place is always crazy busy, so I really appreciated that.  The food is great, but I had the Jambalaya over rice, and the rice was not cooked right.  Not so impressed... But the service was good.  Another plus.  I think for the most part, I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this one in SF seems too busy to really offer the service and quality of food that other Cheesecake Factory's that I've been to.  So 3 stars. *But still a fan...!"
Phan H.,"San Francisco, United States",236,590,1,3.0,8/12/2011,"Long wait, cramped elevator, and freezing cold outside. Why do people come here? The hype and overrated view. We came here for dinner one night, but the wait was going to be 45 minutes, and went somewhere else. Later in the night, we came back for dessert, since I've never been here before. Had the cheesecake factory cab and a strawberry cheesecake. Both were very good and the price was a little pricey for how overrated the place was. Service was fast and friendly though."
Darius A.,"San Bruno, United States",29,620,34,3.0,7/12/2011,This cheesecake factory is probably one of the worse ones I have been to. Everything came out cold. I really like the ones in Marin and Palo Alto but this one plain sucked. More of a tourist spot.
kevan h.,"Berkeley, United States",59,169,25,3.0,30/11/2011,"Located in Union Square, prepare yourself for a long wait. Like most people have said, the food is nothing to gripe about: it's good ol' standard fare for a restaurant like this: very predictable, very pleasant and filling for hungry people. It'll put a dent in your pocketbook to be sure.  It won't be a dining experience so much as an eating one, and let's not kid ourselves: we're here for the cheesecake. We're here for the desserts. We're here because it's Union Square and located on the top floor of the Macy's, and that's what visitors to SF do. Plus, it's got a great view of the square, and it's certainly worth taking a picture, putting it on Twitter, and saying, ""Yes, I was here,"" and letting all my friends know. It's that sort of place."
Tomas C.,"San Francisco, United States",24,17,,3.0,30/11/2011,"Wow... Loved the dynamite shrimp, but it was more like sparkler shrimp. The shrimp were great but left me wanting a lot more heat. Good value at 5 dollars. We moved onto the spicy meat pizza after and were much less than impressed. Not only was it not spicy but at 11 dollars it was kind of like wtf.. We might as well gotten two more orders of shrimp. All in all probably just ordered poorly, but the pizza was less than stellar. Atmosphere was noisy and the music was loud. Pretty buildings but hardly worth the price tag."
Jacob H.,"Salinas, United States",110,188,1,3.0,22/11/2011,"If it wasn't for this place being on the top of Macy's I wouldve hated it... The food is ok, the spiked shake was amazing... The food was ok, and overpriced....  Views during our 2 hour wait.. AMAZING"
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, United States",0,1740,1,3.0,1/11/2011,"Not sure if it's a big as other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, but it's just as nice and has the same enormous menu.  This location has the added advantage of having outdoor seating overlooking Union Square.  On those few really nice days and nights in SF, it is really spectacular.  On the other hand, it'll probably be too darn cold to sit up there anytime you go there! Elevator can take you directly upstairs to the restaurant from the Macy's lobby at Union Square.   Our service was fine and my omelette was pretty good.  The accompanying english muffin looked bakery made instead of from a machine.  We had no wait for an inside table just before noon on a Sunday."
Hen A.,"San Mateo, United States",3007,3154,4803,3.0,31/10/2011,"sunday shopping stroll...dinner at macy's...above and at the sign...waiting for buzzer flashing...neat view from outdoor patio...at the macy's m and twenty minutes of wait...near sunset and requesting indoors...small booth for two...vegetable sandwich and quite good...quite large...quite filling...endless diet coke refills prompt...mountain of fries instead of the salad....safe, & simple dinner without breaking the bank..."
Lily C.,"Sunnyvale, United States",27,36,5,3.0,20/10/2011,"Food wise, I've always been a fan. But the waiter we had that night was SOOOOO slow. It took him 20 minutes to bring the drinks and bread. Another 20 minutes for the food. And I waited forever for my cheesecake. And when the dessert came, it was halfway collapsed. In the end, he never came to collect the bill so we had to ask someone else to ring things up for us. I wrote on the receipt ""I'm sorry dude. You were TOO slow!"""
S A.,"Petaluma, United States",1,19,,3.0,19/10/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is either a hit or miss for me. You really never know what you are going to get service wise. I also hate that there is always an outrageous wait as I refuse to wait over thirty minutes at any restaurant. The good thing is that the food is always good, as is there cheesecake and espresso drinks. I had a caramel macchiato last time I was there and was pleasantly surprised. If you don't mind waiting, the mediocre service or the annoying tourists, then check it out. Or go during the week before 5."
Jocelyn C.,"Alameda, United States",168,416,404,3.0,17/10/2011,"I wished I gave this 4-5 stars after a few times being here.  Service really sucks when trying to dine more than 10 people.  They don't even care if you get to sit together or not.  I mean, people love to go here cuz its known for their cheese cake and people have parties & have dinner here & then after go to the club or lounge.  This is why they should have reservations, cuz people have PARTIES! Its too crowded at this place, cuz its the SAN FRANCISCO LOCATION; more reason to be able to do reservations.  I've been to the Santa Clara location once & that really gave me a great impression of the place, plus it as parking lot that is free.  Also, YOU CAN MAKE RESERVATIONS! LOL  I can't stress it enough that this place needs some work to do.  The only good thing I will say about the San FrancIsco location is that the food is great & price is reasonable.  Also, the look of the place iS nice & its connected to the mall."
Ronnel C.,"San Jose, United States",141,275,21,3.0,8/10/2011,I wish they seated us quicker but hey! People love this place so whatever!
Lisa V.,"Corte Madera, United States",0,26,,3.0,25/9/2011,"You know, when you have small children, your dining options are suddenly equally diminutive. Some people might complain about the food here, but you know what? The food here is pretty good. Yes, it is loaded with calories, but I consider that mitigating that to be the responsibility of the diner. Service is usually terrific, and the staff are especially kind and good natured about children, which is a huge, huge, bonus. And, again. When your dining companion is a toddler, your barometer is set a little lower than the average patron. That said, I've experienced some spacey servers, too, but overall good service and a suggested respite from shopping."
Viktur C.,"Hayward, United States",2,4,3,3.0,24/9/2011,Just like all Cheesecake Factory resturaunts but this one is the best I've ever been to location wise.The view from the balcony is awesome and overlooks Union Square. The only negative is that it can get really crowded sometimes which can lead to spotty service and loooong waits.  The avocado rolls are my favorite and my girlfriend loves the chicken Madeira.
LMecca R.,"San Leandro, United States",79,59,,3.0,20/9/2011,"LUNCH, BRUNCH AND DRINKS- GOOD FOR ME ANYDAY.  The Menu is enourmous, lots of options"
