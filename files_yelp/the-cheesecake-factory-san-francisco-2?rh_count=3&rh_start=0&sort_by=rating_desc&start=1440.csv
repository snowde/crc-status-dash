Gina T.,"Redondo Beach, United States",29,15,7,3.0,15/9/2011,"This is one of my favriote restaurants in my favriote part of San Francisco.  Great service. Refreshing mix of locals, tourists and hipsters alike. Not to mention it is in the prime of prime of locations."
Stephanie T.,"San Francisco, United States",130,379,733,3.0,13/9/2011,"I have a love/hate relationship with The Chessecake Factory, I love their food and I hate it's caloric content. The nutrition facts on their menu scares me. On a recent trip at the request of my mother and aunt, I ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and a small mushroom flatbread. The artichokes were cooked to perfection and were served with a delicious balsamic aioli. This was a large appetizer it came with three artichoke halves, I was able to take one home for lunch the next day, it kept really well and was just as good the next day. The mushroom flatbread was the perfect size. It came with wild mushrooms, garlic, shallots, and fresh herbs. It was really good and it was one of their healthier options."
Neil M.,"Maghull, United Kingdom",2,3,,3.0,7/9/2011,"When I heard about the Cheesecake Factory I instantly thought it would be great given that my favourite dessert is cheesecake. My girlfriend and I decided to eat lunch here whilst on holiday in SF. Firstly the chicken carbonara was excellent. The cheesecake however, I would say was disappointing. I found the original cheesecake to be a bit odd given the use of sour cream. Also on this occasion they did not have the Dulce de Leche Caramel flavour that I originally wanted. Therefore, forcing me to select the vanilla bean which was nice but the vanilla topping in addition to the vanilla cheesecake itself was a bit sickly and difficult to finish."
Matt B.,"Victoria, Canada",104,58,3,3.0,5/9/2011,"My coworkers and I shared nachos and guacamole as an appetizer.   The dip was really addictive, but maybe I just like avocados too much.  I ordered the Four Seasons pizza which has four variations of toppings on the same pie.   The only reason I wouldn't be tempted to come back was because we arrived at one of their peak business hours (lunchtime) and it was a little crowded and noisy for my taste."
Sandy L.,"San Francisco, United States",232,141,29,3.0,30/8/2011,Pasta is not that good here but it's call the cheesecake factory for a reason. Cheesecake is good and i think the calamari is also very good. Nice place to have birthday parties tho.
Amber H.,"Castro Valley, United States",87,30,20,3.0,28/8/2011,"Deserves 3 stars... I usually LOVE cheesecake factory. Possibly because it's in SF but they have very over priced drinks, especially for a chain. My husband and I ordered the strawberry short cake and they served us dried biscuits instead of angel food cake, what is up with that (waitress recommended)?! Anyways the worst part was the wait which we could have handled if the hostess wasn't continually telling us 10-15 minutes and an hour and a half later we didn't even get to eat on the patio as we wanted to and we showed up at 9:30pm"
Harsha G.,"San Jose, United States",531,562,1332,3.0,24/8/2011,"I can have a cheesecake coma!  But, is the crowd, the long wait, the negligent staff (especially when you are waiting to grab your cheesecake to go) truly worth it? Not counting the punishable calories.. The staff has messed my order twice. They have served people after me in the line or completely forgotten my order when I had to show them my bill and question them as to why I waited for frickin 45 mins for a single slice of ultimate red velvet cheesecake.."
Harry G.,"Hillsboro, United States",56,19,10,3.0,23/8/2011,"Just another overprice chain restaurant.  My wife wanted to go and i had no other choice that taking her.  Food is OK, desserts are great.  If you must go and weather is nice ask to sit  outside, the view is amazing."
Lianne D.,"San Francisco, United States",437,169,122,3.0,18/8/2011,"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon. Not too crowded, I was able to get a table for 3 within ten minute. Luckily it was beautiful in Downtown because I would of been upset for getting seated by the door. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. It was delicious! Very saucy which I love and the flavor was just right! Not too spicy and you can definitely taste the honey. We also ordered a White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. I swear they give you more whip cream then cheesecake! Overall, it was good! A little too sweet but, thank goodness I was sharing!  Service was alright. I feel like for a place that looks like elegant should not be giving a service like Mel's Drive Inn (no offense)"
Lizete S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,190,,3.0,17/8/2011,"We came by for drinks recently.  The wait for the outside area was over half an hour and we didn't feel like waiting so we opted for sitting at one of the tables near the bar.  Our waitress Brittany was convivial and we had an enjoyable experience.  We ordered some beers, coffee and a pomegranate martini ( not very strong ) and shared the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake dessert (very good).    We would return if in the neighborhood."
Sassy G.,"San Francisco, United States",5,65,,3.0,16/8/2011,"My staple dishes when we patron the Cheesecake Factory.  I always leave happy and satisfied.  The only down-side is the wait so VERY VERY long!   Firecracker Salmon Spiced Fresh Salmon Rolled in Spinach and Fried in a Crisp Wrapper.

Amanda C.,"San Francisco, United States",301,39,,3.0,13/8/2011,"The food is great, but don't waste your time here. There are too many tourist here."
Ray C.,"Daly City, United States",93,158,54,3.0,10/8/2011,"Your experience at the CF will be pretty identical to any other location, save for a few things: - The view off the window seats or the balcony - Ridonkulous wait times - Macy's furniture floor right below the CF level (good for lounging -coughcough-)  Portions are quite large, and bread is good when hot. Butter is the unit-of-use packs. The rye bread is pretty popular and the fluffiest I've had at any restaurant. Touch of oats sprinkled on the crust of the loaves are nice. White bread is also fluffy, but the brown coloring of the rye makes it seem so much tastier for some reason. Reminds me of a chocolate muffin.. Large groups beware, you may wait a long time. Here once with a group of 12...waited 2.5hrs. More moderate groups (5-7) may take an hr. If you are visiting, the experience may be worth it for you. If you are local, eat local."
tong t.,"Palo Alto, United States",23,178,2,3.0,10/8/2011,"i love cheesecake bc of their huge portion, salads and cheesecake. but its always so crowded. even when we ordered for pick up."
Emma Q.,"San Francisco, United States",2,86,,3.0,4/8/2011,"Update:  Crowd-control has improved, and the key lime cheesecake is quite nice."
Kevin C.,"Las Vegas, United States",774,291,184,3.0,3/8/2011,"Best quality about this CF location? The view of Union Square and the park, especially at night, on the balcony. What a prime location! Now that is also the downfall of this place. It's so prime, that the waiting time is ridonkulous! Waited nearly an hour for a table for two. It could have been longer but since we said we would sit 'first available' we got sat outside. It isn't that bad since there are heaters and such out there.  You take the elevator from the ground floor of Macy's to get to the lobby of the CF. There's also escalators that run directly into the department store. After deciding not to trek to Little Italy from our Union Square hotel for dinner, CF seemed like a decent place to grab a bite to eat.  I do love the big portions and I'm in love with their new pasta, Chicken Bellagio. I believe it's a spinach pasta with creamy pesto sauce, topped with arugula and bread-crumb crusted chicken with proscuitto. Yum yum yum. Pricetag for this place is definitely a bit high too."
Darren O.,"San Francisco, United States",4,28,5,3.0,31/7/2011,The food is overrated and overpriced but the desserts are as good as you'd expect. Worth coming up for the views.
Jeannie L.,"San Francisco, United States",75,396,113,3.0,20/7/2011,"I come here ever so often after Sunday movies with the bf -- if we find good parking.  The wait is always ridiculously long, of course. I always head to the bar to snag a table without the wait and normally have no issue.  We have a tendency to get the same dishes:  -Ahi tuna tempura roll *Love this. It's just really yummy and the dipping sauce that comes with goes with it perfectly. -Buffalo wings *You can't go wrong -Louisiana chicken pasta *I really enjoy this dish even though its a bizillion calories. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and never burnt. This time the sauce was a little more salty than usual but all in all still delicious.  Got some drinks too... the sangria is more ice and fruit than actual drink.  The service is always pretty good with the once in awhile case of getting someone who's just overwhelmed."
Christina Z.,"Oakland, United States",18,170,,3.0,19/7/2011,"Came here to meet my friends for lunch. They were already seated at the bar area so I just met them there. Service was pretty good considering how busy it was. I only had had drinks here so I can't rate the food. As for their signature cocktails, they could had been stronger."
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, United States",749,1031,606,3.0,19/7/2011,"Oh my, do I want to love this place..... I have been waiting YEARS to try this place and ofcourse my first experience has to be on an overly packed weekend. I had been to the Cheescake factory in Vegas and Henderson Nevada many, many times though, have always antisipated going to this one. Located on the top floor of Macys, this is a prime location for a restaurant such as this. Decor and ambiance is beautiful and majical as of most Cheescake Factorys however, it was overtaken by the herds of irritable rude people cramed together waiting to be seated. We arrived around 5:50 and were told we would have to wait 50 min to be seated (ofcourse) so, being there was no seating area available in the bar area, we stood and people watched as we waited to be seated. I ordered a glass of 14 hands merlot wine which was nice and I did appreciate the fact that the bar tender was nice enough to let me sample some wines as well. We were seated out side in the patio area overlooking beautiful S.F. I ordered the Mederia chicken which is one of there most popular chicken dishes it is Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese- Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce. It comes with mashed potatos however, I opted for steamed brocoli instead and my bf ordered some sort of clube sandwhich. The service was understandably slow though, sincere and friendly. Our food arrived classically generous in portion though nothing exceptionly appealing. My chicken dish was actually quite tasty (not one of the best dishes I have had at the factorys) though, still very satisfying. My bfs dish looked incredibly delish and apparently was quite good. Overall, food was ok, ambiance was great, however the crowd and the chaos was just unbearable. Can't say I am desperatly eager to come back any time soon."
