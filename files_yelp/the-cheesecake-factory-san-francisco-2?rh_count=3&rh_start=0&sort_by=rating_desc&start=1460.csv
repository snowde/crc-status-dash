christine c.,"San Francisco, United States",46,377,1,3.0,8/7/2011,"This place is constantly out of control crazy. Even at 4 p.m. on a weekday it's PACKED. Usually I order take out from here, even if it's just a piece of cake or something, but just be prepared and warned, you'll always wait at least 10 or 15 minutes. Service is spotty, but it's the Cheesecake Factory and it's nuts. The food is the same everywhere since it's frozen, but it's delicious so whatever. I like the take-out almost better. Don't have to deal with the crazy tourists and the servers can't mess anything up or piss you off. Though, there is a cool patio and awesome view to enjoy both day and night. But do remember, just because you're in California doesn't mean it's warm. People on the patio, be prepared to wear a coat!"
Tam F.,"San Ramon, United States",489,1397,253,3.0,8/7/2011,"I have been to many a Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I have been to them often and for the past year have basically only one thing I order-the miso salmon with brown rice. It is delicious, it is filling and I can eat it without any problem (I have esophagus issues).  Last weekend, my husband's aunt and uncle were staying in Union Square while visiting from Page, Arizona. We only had a small window of time to see them on Sunday mid morning before the aunt had to attend a 5 hour long opera. Yes, I did say a 5 hour long opera. She is a French horn player and well, music and opera are her thing. Anyway, we decided to meet here as it was an easy choice, nice location, had plenty of places for us to park and we all like it enough.  We all arrived at the same time and took the packed elevator up together. Had I known the famed Burger Bar was right across the hall, I would have wanted to try that but alas we were committed and had a reservation. We were seated outside in the shade and well, I already knew my order. The aunt and uncle shared an egg brunch dish, the husband had steak and eggs, and the daughter had her standard turkey burger which she loved.  Service was hit or miss. Our drinks were hardly refilled, we felt a little cramped and a bit rushed. My salmon was fine but instead of it being plated beautifully with the rice molded like the other locations too, this time, the rice was basically plopped in a big mound and the salmon was on top. It tasted fine but the presentation was just not there.  LIke all other CF's, there are definitely not enough lady bathroom stalls available. 3 stalls for a big restaurant all that seemed to be without toilet paper is just not sufficient. Luckily, being the kind of gal I am, I had some kleenex in my purse so after waiting in line to use the potty, I didn't have to ""drip dry"".  With all the other restaurant choices in the area, I doubt I would come back to this location for just a regular thing, but when seeing out of towners it was just fine."
TJ B.,"San Francisco, United States",39,88,28,3.0,5/7/2011,"Pros:  Crazy cool spot and view. Fried macaroni and cheese balls.-These are wickedly delish. Dulce de leche cheesecake-the best cheesecake on the menu. With that said, Most of the menu options are either bland or too heavy to eat. Everything is just average faire. Nothing spectacular. The spot is nice for afternoons and warmer days but on usual S.F. days, its way too cold. Not to mention, the birds hovering over head are a tad annoying.  All in all, this spot is more for tourists."
Sumdum-Fooka U.,"Long Beach, United States",0,24,,3.0,3/7/2011,"It's the same fairly decent slop that they serve at all other Cheesecake Factories... A couple of key differences apply to this particular location, though: 1. It's almost always packed and ultra crowded (1hr + waiting times); 2. There are some sections where the views are really cool and (could almost) make the wait worthwhile. 3. If you want to check out euro babe-style tourists who are just oozing with sex appeal then this is an excellent place to go. Wait...Maybe that's a comment that applies to Union Square in general during this time of year."
Virgo M.,"Bay Area, United States",221,767,81,3.0,2/7/2011,"Really, I have never written a review here? Maybe cuz it's just OKAY.  All three stars are for the cheesecake....everytime and any flavor. I haven't yet sunk my teeth into today's choice--Pina Colada. However, I'm hopeful it's gonna be totally delish. (edit: it was) The food here and at every other CF I've been to is just OK. I actually prefer the CF spinoff restaurant ""Grand Lux"" in Vegas for food selections. Today, I had ahi sushi rolls (yuck), a small arugula salad (plain) and a peach smoothie (decent.)  The location atop Macys overlooking Union Square is of course--devine.  I'll be back....it's the CF after all."
Ashley J.,"San Francisco, United States",341,326,53,3.0,29/6/2011,"What's excellent about this place? The view of Union square. What's bad about this place? Nothing really. The food is average, and can be overwhelming with the amount you get (I suggest splitting an entree between 2 people, yes even if you're a hungry guy). It's a great casual spot to dine in Union Square, and it's open pretty late too. The cheesecake is ALWAYS good, but there's never room to fit it after eating your weight in pasta and complimentary bread. The one thing I'd suggest for all Cheesecake Factories is to lessen the amount of food you put on the plate. If everyone in your restaurant is taking doggie bags home, it should be a sign. One thing is for sure though-- the price here is very right. And if you split a dish, maybe add a salad and some cheesecake, you get a great well rounded meal for an even better price."
Wooka W.,"Richmond, United States",40,57,,3.0,27/6/2011,I didn't know this place existed actually..went shopping with a chick at Macy's (worst idea ever) spent hours at the make-up area! After that she made me climb like 10 floors talking about there's a cheesecake factory up here..I said can't we take the elevator..she said no..I started questioning if she was crazy..Later I found out you really can't take the elevator all the way up there..What where they thinking?? Service lines are forever you probably die of starvation before getting sat down..Food is expensive and mediocre. but the view is killer and chicks dig that! So I say tough it out after your wallets been milked dry..the day can't go worse it only gets better!
Scotty D.,"Pleasanton, United States",2049,1139,1426,3.0,25/6/2011,"PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CHEESECAKE! OMG WOW! ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CHEESECAKE! SAME THING! ok so has anyone ever actually been able to successfully finish some cheesecake after eating a full on meal here? the portions are sooo damn huge here! even a starter salad is as big as an entree salad at any other place. any given entrees quite the huge portion so you always get more than your moneys worth. i love that they serve a sweet brown bread with the meal, it's sooo darn good.  you must get the fried macaroni and cheese balls in marinara and the factory made meatloaf. both are TO DIE FOR! and as for the cheesecake i suggest you grab some to go. you must try my favorites.... pineapple upside down cheesecake crazy carrot cake cheesecake pumpkin cheesecake pumpkin pecan cheesecake adam's peanut butter cheesecake all in all the cheesecake factory is a good dining experience and with an insanely huge menu you cant go wrong. JUST GO HUNGRY!!!"
Yael N.,"Beaverton, United States",106,81,1,3.0,20/6/2011,"I've eaten here several times, but I do not make a habit of it. My most recent experience was 2 nights ago, after about a 4 year absence. It was packed of course, but we (my party of 6) got seated about 40 minutes earlier than we thought because another large party was not present. Service was good, so was the food- I had the seared tuna tataki salad and fresh strawberries for dessert. I don't care for the cheesecake here, personally. Overall, a good experience. I still think The Cheesecake Factory as a whole is overpriced and overrated."
P K.,"Redwood City, United States",1,33,,3.0,6/6/2011,"Super busy location for this Cheesecake Factory so be prepared to pay for parking and wait for a table or even a bar seat. I  ate here a few times but took a date here before and had to do a u turn when I stepped out of the elevator after I saw how busy it was.  With that aside, when you do get to sit down, the view is awesome and the food is quite tasty. I also remember them for having really great mixed drinks like Mai Tai's.  Make sure you blind fold your date on the way down since this Cheesecake Factory is located on top of a 7 story Macy's and if you had any money left over from dinner you definitely won't by the time you exit the building."
Kimberly C.,"San Francisco, United States",271,34,,3.0,1/6/2011,"My best recommendation for visiting this Cheesecake is to come with a friend or two max and sit at the bar, which is what I've done in the past 3 or 4 times I've come here.  Never try to enter with a big party for dinner or at any hour on the weekends unless you are ready to hunker down and wait for at minimum 40 minutes.  I'm not really sure why with such a big space the restaurant is disorganized and the lobby gets insane and uncomfortably crowded.   I'm still coming back to this Cheesecake because I know how to work it so that it fits what I want out of it.  Newbies should avoid unless you really want the Cheesecake experience."
Mimy P.,"Berkeley, United States",5,18,,3.0,22/5/2011,"Today was the third time that I've visited The Cheesecake Factory and it was an okay experience. Unlike the past two times, we didn't have to wait at all for a table. I would suggest arriving early to avoid the long wait (i.e. more than half an hour).  I had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which is ""penne pasta tossed with broccoli, oven-dried tomato, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts"", quoted verbatim from their menu. Unfortunately, the reality did not match the description. There weren't any peppers or tomatoes in the dish. A bunch of the penne was clumped together. Overall, the dish was really bland. I would recommend their chicken marsala and mushrooms instead. I've had it in the past and it was much more flavorful.  The saving grace, however, was the service. The waiter was really attentive and checked up on us several times. Our bread basket and drinks were refilled several times. It was my friend's birthday so the waiters sung her happy birthday and gave her a free dessert as well."
Audrey G.,"San Francisco, United States",63,46,40,3.0,30/4/2011,"As most of you know, the wait time here isn't that great, and neither is the front desk. The music is actually really loud, and it's hard to hear them when they shout your name.. Anyways, let's move on: - THIS REVIEW IS FOR MY NEW FAVORITE WAITER ANTONIO - Okay, so, where do I begin?! As me and my cousin were seated, Antonio did not hesitate to ask us what drinks we wanted. He came back super quick with our drinks (which, to a small girl like me, was quite a big cup) and gave us more time to figure out what we wanted to order. We ended up ordering the boneless buffalo strips to start, a small bowl or the fettuccine alfredo, and a spicy buffalo burger with sweet potato fries. I strongly recommend for people to order a small size - unless you're really really hungry, because large plates are huuuuuuuge. After we were done eating, we were handed the cheesecake menu. We didn't know what to order, so we asked Antonio to help us out. He actually took the time to sit down and help us! He strongly recommended us to go with the White chocolate Macadamia cheesecake since it was his favorite, and I'm so glad we listened to him. He knows exactly what goes well with what, and is such a sweetheart. He made my second experience here a lot better than my first!"
Karen T.,"Brooklyn, United States",3,33,3,3.0,23/4/2011,"I tried the red velvet cheesecake and I must admit, it was good. But at almost $9 for a slice of cheesecake, it was definitely not worth it."
Gabriella C.,"San Francisco, United States",11,72,25,3.0,17/4/2011,"I kind of chuckle when I see thorough reviews of CF. Seriously? C'mon Its a chain restaurant and a tourist hot spot, we all know the food is decent to mediocre, and probably not as great as the experience you could've had at a mom n pop restaurant anywhere else in the city. Next!"
Roberto B.,"Montreal, Canada",3,7,,3.0,16/4/2011,"Went there with my missus while shopping for a couch at Macy's. The place was (very) nice, staff was friendly, and it didn't take us much time to find a place to sit by the bar. Food, though, was another story. It's one of those places that looks much better than what it actually is. My better half had the classic hamburger with salad. Of course I tried it (being an avid meat-eater), so I'd rate it 6/10. The meat was OK, the bun felt a bit cheap.... the pickles were great, though. My hamburger (a cheeseburger) was another story... It was served cut in half (!?) in a baguette-like piece of bread (I am assuming it was the way it was meant to be, but if that was the case, why changing something that worked fine?); the cheese was not completely melted, and the bread felt like if it was from the day before. And worse, the meat was less than satisfying. I'm giving the place 3 stars for the venue, and not for the food. So far, a hamburger at Pearl's is still the top-in-class. R."
Sascha M.,"New York, United States",593,812,7,3.0,6/4/2011,"After drinking at the Belden, we did a little shopping in Union Square and were starting to get thirsty and hungry again. I haven't had Cheesecake Factory in forever, so when my sister suggested it and said they now have these mini appetizers, I was sold.  We got strawberry martinis which were pretty good and chicken samosas and onion rings.  Yummy fatty snack food. There was only one bartender so the service was slow."
MB M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,27,20,3.0,3/4/2011,"ah. The Cheesecake Factory is super hit or miss. with their extensive menu, i guess it's kinda crazy to think that every single thing on their menu is gonna be super good. The quantity of their choices is pretty impressive, but that means quality is often compromised as a result. but i've been here plenty of times, and most have been pleasant experiences. The pasta da vinci dish is usually very satisfying, and the chicken avocado club is one of my faves.... the cheesecake is always super good, no matter which one you get...  Today, however, my experience was ...meh. i almost went for the chicken avocado club, ""pasta da vinci"" was at the tip of my tongue, but at the last minute, i decided to try the fish tacos. ....why the heck i did that, i don't know. dude... it was not satistying. sucks, cuz i really wanted to enjoy them! my ""tempura fried fish"" (more like reheated fish nuggets) were practically buried six feet deep in cilantro and lettuce or whatever. !! dude. NOT the business. and on top of that, i was only given ONE slice of lime. for FOUR tacos! tsk ....  my fresh banana cream cheesecake was awesome, but i was so over my food, that i wasn't even excited anymore. :("
Vy L.,"San Francisco, United States",59,19,42,3.0,28/3/2011,"I've been here so many times and I've ordered so many birthday cakes from here so I thought I should write a review. This place would have been a 4 star except there is one thing that I absolutely HATE about it.  It doesn't take reservations.  Really?  EVERY time that I'm here, I end up waiting at least an hour.  I hate waiting and make reservations ALWAYS, but this place makes that impossible. As for food, I am addicted to their bread.  It's ways so warm and soft (:  As for the rest of the food, everything seems pricey but that's because portions are HUGE.  Seriously.  The pasta is about 4 meals for me.   Cheesecakes.  Oh cheesecakes.  I love cheesecake.  This place definitely does not disappoint with all the flavors to choose from.  I've also ordered whole cakes from here before for my birthdays and my brothers birthday.  I have no complaints about the cheesecakes. It is decorated just like any other Cheesecake Factory, but a definite plus is the view of Union Square if you're seated outside.  Service is usually good, but nothing amazing.   I'd come here if you don't mind the wait and want the view.  Otherwise, I'd go to any other Cheesecake Factory."
Donnie F.,"Colma, United States",183,31,83,3.0,15/3/2011,"Highlight: great service, friendly staff, and bomb ass cheese cakes! The buffalo chicken blast, deep fried macaroni cheese, crispy crab bites, ahi tartare , and chicken samosas was HELLA good!! Great view of union square.  Cons: weekends here are crazy! The wait time is pretty long. U have to take an elevator up that can only fit 10 people MAX.  I always leave this place with a satisfied stomach. Prices are somewhat high depending on what you eat. The appetizers filled my stomach last time I came here. They have a good selection of wine and a very diverse menu. Best time to go here is during odd times on the weekdays."
