Bayarea K.,"Berkeley, United States",0,488,,3.0,13/3/2011,Crazy waits due to it's location. Tourist trap. Food is ok--typical chain quality. Convenient location. Hearty portions.
Katie Anne N.,"San Francisco, United States",631,1335,908,3.0,2/3/2011,"A slice of the red velvet cheesecake may be $10 but it is well worth the hefty price tag. I often get one to go and devour it in the privacy of my own home. I noticed that if you go to Cheesecake Factory during lunch, there is hardly a wait for a table."
Casey W.,"Santa Rosa, United States",2,8,1,3.0,26/2/2011,"The location of this place is what makes it. I mean on top of Macy's :). It's such a nice view. The food is good, but the cheesecake is amazing!! I suggest the Red Velvet cheesecake o my goodness it's delicious!! The pieces are huge so you can definitely share one, although you may want to get your own ;)."
Jon K.,"Millbrae, United States",481,127,79,3.0,24/2/2011,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is like a magnet for tourists; but who can blame them. The location sits on top of Macy's with a great few of the City and Union Square and even has some pretty good choices of food.  If you plan to have dinner here you've got to get in line really early; like most say, it can get really busy with the combination of tourists and locals who go to take in the view and dining. I personal had to wait 1 hour for my group of 7; but turn bad news into good news by heading around the mall or downstairs into Macy's (there's almost always a sale!).  Our group ordered an array of appetizers because most of us weren't that hungry for a large meal so we all picked plates that appealed to us. The fried mac n cheese tastes the best when it is freshly brought to your table, otherwise it cools and loses a lot of taste and flavor quickly. The avacodo rolls were probably one of the top picks of the night, very well seasoned with great texture. Of all the places I've recently ordered sweet potato fries from, Cheesecake has got this recipe down; the combination of sweet and saltiness flavors just hits your pallet perfectly; the basket lasted maybe 10 minutes. We also ordered the buffalo wings, sliders, a side of normal fries and fried calamari, all which tasted good, but were nothing to really brag about.  As an entree, my gf and I shared the garlic pasta with chicken where we substituted angel hair instead of spaghetti; the dish smelled amazing! However, it seemed as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time because the top bits of shitake mushroom on our dish were more cooked than the ones underneath and the pasta seemed dry, perhaps because there was little sauce present in the dish. Still, both of us really enjoyed this dish and felt it was bold in flavor and taste.  The only true downside to the meal which unfortunately was a really big downer was that throughout the entire meal, it was almost impossible to get the attention of our waitress. Once we were seated it seemed as if we had another wait simply to get our orders of water. On multiple occasions we were forced to call another waiter over to order our drinks, our dinner and to get the check. Having struck out on all the important times to hit our table we saw the waiter from the table on the other side of the room more often than we saw her.  Like any other busy restaurant, get there early and beat the crowd so you can enjoy the food and the view. I've been to this place 20+ times, which has got to show something; this restaurant usually has good food and good service; I guess everyone's entitled to their bad days right? At least, I'll be back for another taste later on this year that's for sure."
Grace L.,"San Diego, United States",1143,621,560,3.0,20/2/2011,"It's really hard not to like this location. Some people would throw it out the door just for the crazy long wait alone, but there's so much more. Have you ever sat outside on the patio on a nice sunny day with the view of the hustle and bustle below? I have. It was splendid. This time, we were here to celebrate one of my bestie's birthdays. For a Saturday night, the wait was atrocious - a whopping hour and a half for a party of 3. But we put our names down and ventured off the 8 story Macys. And yes, that's one of the coolest things about this location is that your pager works throughout the entire store. We got back with half an hour left, and I ordered a Pyramid Haywire Heff from the bar. I think Lovie's drinking preferences are growing on me. We finally sat down. We ordered the avocado eggs rolls, tempura shrimp, and mini corn dogs. All of which were delish. We went in with our main dishes with an eagerness that has been building up throughout the entire day. Lisa had a monstrous heaping of pulled pork sandwich goodness. Jaclyn had a beautiful spread of steak and shrimp with garlic herb mashed potatoes. I had a perfectly bleeding medium rare Monterey burger with avocado. I've been on a real avocado kick lately, can you tell?!?  Last but not least were the cheesecake. We were so stuffed, we took our cheesecakes to go. I enjoyed my luscious red velvet cheesecake for breakfast the next day. Nothing like a sugar rush to get your day going. The reason for the 3 stars is the service. Though our waitress was on par for most of the night, she forgot to sing happy birthday to my friend! And it took this super kind lady from New Zealand who was sitting next to us to say to our waitress that she forgot about the birthday. Vicky from New Zealand was super nice...she look pictures of all three of us. I wish I had taken a picture with her too. Anyways, we'll be back here again eventually. I gave bestie a gift card to Cheesecake, so we're guaranteed to be back sometime."
Jessie C.,"San Francisco, United States",240,24,3,3.0,13/2/2011,"What's that saying? Don't judge a book by it's cover? Even if the cover makes your mouth water and jaw drop (the view from the top).  The food it alright, actually, it's not that great. It looks wonderful on the menu though. However, it's overpriced, and *sigh* I guess you have to pay for a nice environment and a waiter who remembers your name. Their dishes are huge, but not necessarily good.  If I were you I might split a plate of pasta with a friend, and order a slice of cheesecake for dessert. But don't get too excited about the food."
Bert K.,"Mountain View, United States",61,1206,,3.0,7/2/2011,"On a sunday night 7pm, we took a chance and rode the elevator to floor 8. It was not crowded nor noisy (it's Sunday evening) and many patrons, as usual, looked satisfied and having a good time. It was a gorgeous, balmy San Francisco warm evening: the lights in Union Square twinkled and the stars beckoned us to dine outside : we gladly obliged and requested patio dining.  The attendant said it  would be about twenty minutes. After twenty minutes, we were seated as promised: outside, cozily right up to the window. We had a fabulous view of Union Square and a quarter moon shone high up in the night sky as if to wink !  the city lights twinkled and invited us to gaze out and enjoy the warm Indian Summer like breeze.  Kudo's for the Mark West Pinot Noir : it smelled of sweet berries and it's body was light as was it's tannins. We ordered the French Country Salad and the Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimps. To get you started a basket of warm bread with butter is brought to you: both white and a tastey brown bread. The French Country Salad was large and full of very fresh lettuce and only a few pieces of grilled asparagus and avovado :(  the dressing was fine, but for $8.95, they coulda done a bit better. The Angel Hair Pasta was a sizeable plate, with six phat succulently sauteed shrimps, interspersed with chopped tomatoes and a bit of garlic, def. enough for two medium eaters. The pasta was good and the shrimps were mouth watering sweet. Very Scrumptious. Customer service: ok to good. Decor: typically Cheese cake factory, sleek and clean. Bathrooms: typically super clean and well lit."
Sarah S.,"Kailua-Kona, United States",53,63,,3.0,4/2/2011,Epic amounts of food..  4 meals worth.......  The cheesecake was ok..  Someplace I'd go with a group of people who were low on cash.  :) View from the balcony is lovely..
Nathaniel M.,"Poulsbo, United States",14,14,13,3.0,29/1/2011,"The food was just alright, but nothing amazing.  I had the Jamaican Shrimp and I think I was expecting it to be a lot better than it was.  It was also supposed to come with grilled plantains, but they didn't make it onto the plate (more on that later). We shared the Thai Lettuce appetizer and it was very very good, although a little messy.  You'll have to go wash your hands after you're finished with it.  Perfect size for two people. The service was so-so.  After our waitress brought our food out we didn't see her again until she brought the bill.  I wanted to ask her about the grilled plantains not coming out, but she never came back to check on us.  I asked when she brought the bill, and she gave me a free piece of cheesecake because of it, which was nice. Looking back on it now, with all the amazing restaurants in SF, I would have rather eaten somewhere else."
Peter S.,"Saint Petersburg, United States",115,384,43,3.0,29/1/2011,What can I say - It's The Cheesecake Factory. This is basically on the roof of Macy's at Union Square - so cool location and nice views. Service was good. Good was consistant.
Arnold T.,"San Francisco, United States",314,240,831,3.0,16/1/2011,"""Hi, how are you?  Can I have a table for 5?""  - a very calm and happy me ""What's your name?"" - says the hostess that looks like she's 13 ""Arnold"" - a still calm and happy me responds ""Come back in 2 and half hours for your buzzer."" - the hostess says this with an emotionless face ""How long is the total wait time?"" -  I asked as my brain starts thinking of alternative choices for dinner now ""5 and a half hours"" - says the hostess like it's nothing unusual   ""Wow..."" - though it was really a ""WTF"" in my head.   How many people have come here only to realize they have to go through an outrageous wait time.  I'm sure everyone has, unless you're a celebrity than maybe your time will be cut in half.  I really like eating here, but I really dislike waiting here.  I've taken naps on those Macy's couches a floor down waiting for my table many a time.  On one occasion, I woke up from a two-hour power nap only to find out there was forty-five minutes left for the table.  What's ridiculous is everyone will still pile in to wait and eat here.  Is there something special about this place?     What's special about this restaurant is the location of it.  It's on top of the Macy's building overseeing the heart of Union Square.  It's a sight to see when everyone is out and about shopping.  The outdoor seating, even on cold nights, isn't too bad especially if you have a heating lamp close to you.  I actually prefer the outdoor seating, because the lighting in the regular dining area is a tiny bit too dim for me. They give you bread at the beginning of the meal and by far the dark colored bread, which I call ""chocolate bread"", is far superior to the sourdough stuff it comes with it.  It's especially good if it's still warm, and I usually ask for an extra helping of that.  When you open the menu and scan through their choices, I'm telling you now.  The food is above average.  That goes for everything on the menu.  It's good, but doesn't have a ""Wow"" factor.  So it doesn't matter what you get.  It's going to be above average.  I've ordered their meat loaf the most and I get the ""you ordered that at Cheesecake Factory?"" question a lot.  I can't help it; I like meatloaf.  I like the fact they serve their breakfast menu all day.   Cheesecake Factory visit is never finished without a slice of cheesecake.  I'm a fan of cheesecake and it's hard for anywhere to beat the choices they have on their cheesecake list.  I'm a simple guy, so I usually tend to get the regular one.  The tiramisu and the carrot cake ones are my other favorites.   The biggest pro is the view and their different kind of cheesecakes.  Unfortunately, I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory location 3 stars due to the wait time.  There are just too many choices in that area to justify waiting that long to eat here.  If it wasn't for hand-held devices and smart phones, I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't wait that long."
Moua L.,"Concord, United States",179,356,434,3.0,11/1/2011,"On a Sunday night, this place was still filled with people at 9:30pm. When we arrived on the floor, the place smelled pretty bad.  Going to the bathroom, one of the waiters said, ""it smells like rotten egg here"".  We just laughed about it, because they noticed it too.  After 20 minutes of waiting, we grabbed two seats at the bar instead of waiting for a table. Then it took nearly 20 minutes to get a dessert and freshly orange juice. The Strawberry shortcake was packed with old thawed out strawberries and hard bread.  It wasn't good at all. The one good part of my night was when the waitress offered to fill my water bottle after seeing me try to fill up my bottle with left-over water. That was nice.  I suggest sticking to the cheesecakes, because that is their specialty."
Liberty C.,"San Francisco, United States",6,61,1,3.0,6/1/2011,"I use to want Cheesecake Factory alllll the time, then I don't know what happened. I guess I grew out of that phase, but occasionally I do crave for their pastas. The wait here is ridiculous, it can vary between 30 mins to hours, and it also depends on the number of people for your party. I can see people going here for special occasions but on a daily basis, it gets expensive! Although their cheesecake is sooooo good. The food portions are okay as well as the desserts but some are really sweet.  The service is good though, compared to most high end restaurants. I'm not sure if anything changed from the last time I went, but for some reason I'm thinking, I should go back to refresh my memory someday."
Victoria V.,"Sebastopol, United States",5,61,67,3.0,4/1/2011,"Great view of SF and Union Square.  Best to have a earlier dinner and avoid waiting as long as you would during traditional dinner hours.  The staff here was aveerage, not rude just not as friendly as other locations."
Alison S.,"Vancouver, Canada",48,418,3,3.0,29/12/2010,"Ask a Canadian what they like about America and many of them will list things like lower taxes on shopping, the dollar now being at parity, outlet malls, and Cheesecake Factory. Despite the fact that we like to brag about our national obesity rate sitting (very slightly) lower, many Canadians that I've met (mostly male) have raved about Cheesecake Factory.  The reason is simply that you can get about $30 worth of food for $15.  Portions are HUGE.  I eat like a man and I still need to share. The downside to this: their food is quite heavy.  The saucy dishes definitely are more on the gravy-ish side.  I had an ahi tuna dish, which was lighter and easier to finish, but my friend managed to plow through only about 1/3 of her shepherd's pie and had to take the rest home. Another downside: the wait.  Come in on a Friday night and you're looking at a 1.5 hr wait AT LEAST.  It doesn't matter how small your party is.  My friend pointed out to me that we could do takeout, which we did, and it was fantastic. As for the cheesecakes, they come in many different flavours, and are quite flavourful and rich.  I'm not always in the mood for such a sweet dessert but when I am it hits the spot!  The vanilla bean cheesecake was tasty and probably a little lighter than the more chocolatey creations (although my universal favourite will always some kind of berry white chocolate cheesecake) I recommend for takeout mostly, or if you really love standing (you can also wander around macy's while you wait for a table, they give you a little buzzer thing)."
M K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,139,14,3.0,23/12/2010,"If you want a slice of chocolate cake in Union square at 11:30pm, this is your joint.  Otherwise, during dinner, it is always horrendously crowded and the food isn't all that great.  Desserts and drinks only - forget the dinner."
Emily G.,"San Carlos, United States",15,160,,3.0,21/12/2010,"We were seated outside fairly quickly, for a change. My fish tacos, rice and beans were lukewarm, and I had to bug the waiter about my husband's overdue steak, which arrived well done, instead of medium rare. When I complained, the waiter played passive aggressive by making himself scarce. The food was just okay, as usual, (menu is way too thick), and the crowds and service get in the way. Just the normal Union Square challenges. Nordstrom's Bistro at San Francisco Center is still more reliable."
Jane M.,"Santa Rosa, United States",23,77,,3.0,20/12/2010,Went for a Holiday Luncheon and was seated with a group of 8 within 15 minutes. Food took forever and was average.Would I go back???I don't think so waitress was a little to perky for me LOL
Anecia L.,"San Leandro, United States",359,26,,3.0,16/12/2010,"This location is usually busy since it's in union square and on top of macys.  That's the nice thing about this location that it is on the 8th floor of macys so you get a really nice ambiance, although the Cheesecake factory always has nice decor and vibe to it.   My mom and I came here the other day for a late lunch and it was still really busy even though lunch time had past.  The great thing about the CF is that they have a great menu. I mean you could come here a bunch of times and get something different every time.  This time I ordered the BBQ salmon which I've probably ordered once or twice before so I obviously know what to expect.  My mom also ordered something from the special menu.  I always enjoy their complimentary wheat bread.  I don't really care for their french bread.  Our food came out in  timely matter but I noticed something with my dish, it was missing the onion strings.  I mean it wasn't a huge deal but I would expect them not to forget these things.  So I asked our waitress about it and she just made this excuse on why the onion strings weren't on my plate.  She just ended up giving me a side of onion strings.  Our waitress wasn't great either.  She was just there to do her job, not too friendly.  I just feel like she could of provided better customer service.  Another complaint is when my mom ordered hot tea they didn't have her choose what kind of tea she wanted.  So when she got her tea she got this flavor of tea she didn't like.  They usually serve you with the hot water and a box of mixed tea flavors to choose from.   Overall this location just needs better customer service and provide the proper food to their dishes."
