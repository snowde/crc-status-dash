Michelle C.,"Castro Valley, United States",141,319,28,3.0,13/12/2010,The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. This past weekend I got to check out the Union Square location. Like most locations the wait was long although for a busy Saturday 2 weeks before Christmas the wait was not as bad as I thought it would be only an hour.  While we waited we got to cruise the Macy's furniture department and then hung out on the patio that had a very nice view of the hustle and bustle down below. I went for an old favorite the Shrimp Bacon Club sandwich with sweet potato fries. As usual it was a sloppy mess but worth it I need to remember to order it with less tomatoes next time I have the pleasure. A yummy sandwich and two mojitos later I was very satisfied with my dining experience and hope to visit this location again.
Rebecca R.,"Bloomington, United States",6,205,3,3.0,22/11/2010,"Been here a few times, most recently two weeks ago. It was ok, but nothing fantastic. When it's busy, it seems like they just slop everything together. They ran out of bread and ran out of the foccacia bread that was to be on my sandwich. The cheesecake was frozen. Still pretty tasty, but overall just ok. Not worth the cost of the meal to be honest!"
Max S.,"Beverly Hills, United States",0,24,,3.0,22/11/2010,Just a regular Cheesecake Factory. You get the good quality you expect.
CoCo V.,"Alameda, United States",92,72,23,3.0,20/11/2010,"**3.5 Stars, so I'm a fan =) The decor and large menu is good enough for me. I like coming here with friends and family for a casual dinner.  Everyone always can find something they like since the menu is endless. Which i don't mind =) Most of the time, there is always a wait. Which is expected if you've been here before, so I always try and prepare myself to wait at least an hour. Service is really good most of the time. Occasionally there might be a slow or not very helpful waiter or waitress, but not too often.  Some of my favorite dishes are the Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich, OMG...really good! HUGEEE, but soo good! The Jambalaya Fettuccine is great also, but instead of the pasta noodles, get it with rice and extra sauce on the side, you will NOT be disappointed. And I always start off with their fried Zuccinni and Tuna Tartare small plate. So if you like tons of options and cheesecake? This is the place to visit! =)"
Joshua C.,"Oakland, United States",80,359,11,3.0,15/11/2010,"I know, I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. I don't eat here often, but when I do, it's always a great experience. Friendly staff, plenty of food options and yummy cheesecake.  I had Sunday brunch here with some friends for a birthday celebration. The wait wasn't long and they seated us even though two people were running late. My food was actually really good (Crab hash) although the poached eggs were a little overcooked. The hollandaise sauce was scrumptious and I cleaned my whole plate. I was the only one leaving without leftovers.  We were there for a couple hours, never rushed by the staff and they were very attentive and pleasant during the whole experience. It's a chain, but they are very consistent with their food and service, so I can't complain.  Go early on a Sunday morning for brunch and beat the crowds. Also, if it's in season, the pumpkin cheesecake is the bomb."
Cynthia C.,"San Francisco, United States",313,623,1613,3.0,13/11/2010,This place gets  points for always being solid on the miso salmon. I always order the same thing each time I'm here and it never disappoints. The salmon is always moist and the sauce they serve with it is just delicious.  The servings are gigantic so make sure you order to share or don't overdose on appetizers because you definitely need to save room for dessert.  I always have the vanilla bean cheesecake because I love the flavor of vanilla bean but they have a HUGE selection for your heart's desire.
Ash R.,"Honolulu, United States",247,167,134,3.0,10/11/2010,"They have a good selection of choices to pick from and their food is pretty consistent. My friend loves the fried Marconi and cheese but i personally don't think they are great. The avocado fried eggs rolls is pretty good.  The worst place of Cheese Factory is waiting to be service since they don't take reservation. Don't ever go on friday nights, the wait in line is so long."
S. D.,"San Francisco, United States",28,43,32,3.0,15/10/2010,"It's just one of those places you have to go eat at when you're visiting Union Square. I like coming to Cheesecake for the view of the square below. Day or night, it's always nice looking down from atop the restaurant at the people below. There's always something interesting going on.   Cheescake there is pretty yummy. Aside from the wide selection of cheesecake, there is a lot on their menu to choose from. I mean A LOT of choices. Portions are always gargantuan so keep that in mind when ordering. I always overestimate how much I'll eat and I never get past a few bites when I get to the cheesecake.  I guess that's fine because then I have something to give to all the homeless begging for food in front. That being said, the food there isn't all that great. I came one time with an out of town guest and we were served hard undercooked pasta.  The management apologized and got us another plate. The food at the Cheesecake in Valleyfair Westfield is better.  But, like I said, view is good, portions are big, and there is a big menu."
Jenny Rose U.,"Elk Grove, United States",4,9,,3.0,12/10/2010,"Visited Cheesecake Factory after a long day of shopping. What surprised me was the balcony. Wow! Ofcourse I had to reserve seats out there. The long wait was to be expected. The downside is that this restaurant is really snug! Especially in the waiting area. There were no place to sit or stand. When we finally got seated, the waiter wasn't really attentive. He just took our order, another person delivered our food and we never saw our original waiter until the end when we got our check. We had to ask other waiters to refill our drinks for us. Otherwise, the food was mediocre.  I gave it a 3 star because of the poor attention from the waiter and there weren't many places to sit/stand while you wait for your table. Although, the balcony seat was the best! Overlooking the tall S.F. buildings. I Would definitely come back, hopefully get a much better waiter also."
Amy L.,"Lake Forest, United States",331,377,286,3.0,3/10/2010,"Love how its right by the mall, but the food is just okay. I definitely go to cheesecake factory more for their desserts and cheesecakes as oppose to their food. There appetizers may actually taste better than their actual dishes. Cheesecake factory has a myriad of tastes and choices, you can get something Asian inspired to Italian pasta.  I love their avocado eggrolls, its definitely enough for lunch if you want something light.  Dishes: jambalaya pasta: disappointing. I ordered this and there was no sauce on it. It was dry, they put sundried tomatoe in it and it was still hard and inedible.  They do however, give a good portion for a good price. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends who has different tastes and preferences. This is always out default restaurant when we can't make a decision."
Mariela D.,"San Francisco, United States",1763,759,2657,3.0,28/9/2010,"Took my sissie Victoria D. here on her birthday. It's become somewhat of a ritual to dine here with my sisters. Chain restaurants don't really need reviews since they tend to offer the same experience. But the SF one stands out simply because of it's amazing view of Union Square. Sure, you'll have to shoo away a hungry seagull or two as they watch you dine from the other side of the glass. You may also have to use your silverware as a paperweight to stop your napkins from getting blown away. And on most days it can be a bit cold, but the heat lamps make it bearable. But if you don't like the outdoors, there's always inside seating - I just can never bear to dine inside when I could be enjoying beautiful views of my bustling city. The HUGE menu can be both a pro and a con. No matter what you're craving, it's likely Cheesecake Factory can fill that craving. It can just be hard to make up your mind. Wait times can also be long, even on weekdays but especially on weekends. On my last visit, I had the fish tacos. They came wrapped with corn tortillas, topped with cabbage, avocado and a special sauce. The fish was crispy and delicious. My sister had the orange chicken and rice. It was crispy with a crunchy orange glaze.  Their menu is consistently good, and so is the service. If you love Cheesecake, this place is a no brainer. I never order any, but I always bring some home for my husband :)"
Jay P.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,11,,3.0,27/9/2010,I always make sure we stop by here every time we're in San Francisco. I  cant get over the view of the union square from their outside patio. Food is alright but the wait is ridiculously long.  But I dont mind.
Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, United States",105,499,248,3.0,23/9/2010,"The wait is always long. I would come here for dessert only but I can't justify the wait :P  Their portion is monstrous but the food is not very good. I liked the dark rye bread though and I liked that they warm it up. I ordered their Caesar salad because I remembered it being one of the best Caesar salad I had. Maybe chef wasn't feeling well that day but my salad was...gross. The oil and cheese (I think and I hope) were separated; reminded me of rotten milk. And there was absolutely no flavor. The chicken to salad ratio was off and the chicken was dry and bland. Totally not what I remembered.  My boyfriend had one of their pasta with shrimp scampi and fresh diced tomatoes in an Alfredo sauce. It was good...much better than the salad but definitely not comparable to the pasta we had at Bella Trattoria.  Service was slow but pleasant. Good thing they gave us big mugs of drinks so we didn't have to ask for refills until our server popped up once in a while. Decor/Ambiance: same as any Cheesecake Factory. Warm, gold-ish dim lighting. Big pillars (the ones here are shorter). Ginormous booths. Lots of  energy (rustle bustle)."
Hilary S.,"Toronto, Canada",110,252,40,3.0,5/9/2010,"The food here is so filling and is typical of an american slightly upscale chain restaurant. Yummy but not gourmet in the slightest. But I always leave stuffed out of my mind. I compare it to milestones or pickle barrel or similar in Toronto. Not as if that comparison helps anyone. The one thing about this location is that it's packed. As everyone says, wait time is minimum forty minutes consistently and they do not take reservations. It's also extremely loud because of how many people are hanging around and waiting. It's probably because of the location--on top of Macys in downtown, and swathed with tourists. But the location is also a good thing because sitting outside gives you an awesome view. And the heat lamps work (which is better than some places I've been to). When I'm waiting, I like to take the pager and go down one floor to the furniture show room and lounge out on one of the many sofas they have. It's a perfect way to wait with your friends after a busy day downtown."
Chris Y.,"South San Francisco, United States",15,33,,3.0,28/8/2010,"Great view, great vibe, great service. The wait times are long, especially at peak hours, and the menu is a little too big for my taste. The food portions are big and the food is usually pretty good, but it's also pricey. If you sit outside beware of the pigeons!"
Eve C.,"Manhattan, United States",293,845,439,3.0,23/8/2010,Slightly hesitant to come here considering my last experience at the one in SJ. There's not much to say but that you won't get any surprises with your order. They offer a book as their menu so a plus side is that everyone should be able to find something they like. This location is nicer because if you sit outside you can overlook Union Square. Wouldn't be my first choice but it's a good one when you have a larger party.
Bernard L.,"San Jose, United States",567,178,27,3.0,9/8/2010,"I love the food at Cheesecake Factory from the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. They have something for everybody. This location is insanely crowded due to the tourists in San Francisco so we had to wait for about an hour to get seated, which isn't too bad considering the amount of customers that come in. The view from the balcony is pretty awesome in its own right, although I wouldn't choose to sit there on a windy day. Also, there's something about the layout and decor of this restaurant that seems a little more upscale than the other Cheesecake Factory locations that I've been to."
Karen T.,"San Francisco, United States",366,1253,2320,3.0,1/8/2010,"So after they took my shrimp poor boy away I've been looking for an alternative favorite and still haven't found something I crave for. After hearing how many calories is in the shrimp bistro pasta, I couldn't eat it anymore. For my birthday lunch I had the crab cake sandwich and it was good, but not amazing. Fries were perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Red velvet cheesecake was yumo! but like the pineapple one better. Tuna tartar was just ok, it was more avocado than tuna."
Brendan J.,"Los Angeles, United States",51,365,72,3.0,31/7/2010,"The bottom line about this cheese cake factory - Customer service - slow b/c its always busy. But the servers are pretty cool and nice. The management takes your comments on their website pretty seriously . I received a call a few days after I commented about something not being good.  - The food - good quantity.  - The cheese cake - my personal favorite (drum role) ""'The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake"" - Parking - is tough in downtown SF. If you find a spot consider your self very lucky and dont push your luck with anything else the rest of your day.  - Long Wait - every time I have been here I have been here, its been atleast an hour wait. Try the bar if you cant wait that long. You may get lucky."
Emi K.,"San Francisco, United States",300,162,19,3.0,29/7/2010,"Hmmm I've been to this place two times.  Both times, we had to wait for about an hour.  It was super crowded both times that me and my bf went.   The first time, we went for dinner.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, i LOVE this! it's soo good =] Then my bf ordered some kind of pasta and I had a turkey burger.  It was okay. Not the greatest. I don't see whats so good about this place o.O it reminds me of Elephant Bar or something similar lol The 2nd time we went was during lunch.  I thougth it would be fun to try to eat outside in the patio.  It was a SUNNY day in SF.  Boy was it so wrong to sit outside.  There was pidgeons everywhere. I nearly lost my appetite as they walked by, flew by above my head, and watched you eat. It was HOT and really uncomfortable for my bf and I. I am never eating outside again.  But next time, I come here, I shall try the salmon =]"
