Natalie N.,"Oakland, United States",244,745,97,3.0,15/7/2010,"TIP: Sit at the bar. If they have any wait whatsoever a lot of times the tall tables at the bar are totally empty and you still get table service. You just have to deal with the tvs and noise - but oh well. It's worth not waiting 45 mins.  The menu here is daunting. Its page after page of choices galore. Then I made a important discovery. The ""Small Plates"" menu!! They have tons of choices, for cheap, and you know the serving sizes here are always big. Their ""small"" is my ""medium"" when it comes to dish sizes. Loved the corn dogs, enjoyed the fries, and the salad was pretty good. Nothing super exciting, but also cooked (or fried!) very well. Service was a little slow when we told them we were in a bit of a hurry, but I think he was pretty busy."
Carolina S.,"San Francisco, United States",33,265,17,3.0,8/7/2010,"I'm honestly thinking of giving them less than three stars and here are my reasons why. If you've read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm one more for quality than quantity. It's not that I'm trying to give people less food for their buck, but if you can give me as in my last case with them a $10 omelet with breakfast potatoes and toast, then please give me a healthy meal, please, I'm not trying to consume food for two people! Most Americans are not pregnant!  Don't get me wrong, the omelet (Californian- with avocado, mushrooms, three types of cheeses etc) was divine, but FOUR EGGS! REALLY? Two slices of toast AND breakfast potatoes? It should have been mandatory to have some kind of fruit plate in that platter and some kind of bulky green in the omelet. How else are you supposed to consider downing this as just lunch? Because of the thickness in the omelet, I was only able to consume half of it while still having half of my toast and my potatoes.  If you come here and have never experienced a Cheesecake Factory, please be aware, it's a high tourist trap, especially in this city where the city views from the balcony are actually worth having a drink or two. With that said, possibly the best and most authentic food I've tasted here has been the cheesecakes, which I'll always get to go for parties, special occasions and what not. But as I say, if you're looking for authentic Asian cuisine, or for that matter, a normal sized platter, don't stop here as the service tends to be slower than normal."
Angela T.,"San Francisco, United States",100,54,8,3.0,2/7/2010,"I have been here many times before and never had a chance to write an review and since i was there on Wednesday for  my friend's b-day i should probably write a lil something. Its hard to give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because I never feel like there food is worth the wait.  The red velvet and strawberry cheesecake are my favorite and they have great mini sliders. I order the Chicken chipotle pasta, which was by far the best dish I ever had there. They give big portion so most of the time you can just share and  If you don't want to wait for a table, try going to the bar."
Michelle O.,"Ladera Ranch, United States",168,546,80,3.0,30/6/2010,"At the top of the Macy's building in Union Square, this CF is just like any of the others.  We decided we wanted dessert late and walked through blistering winds from the Nikko to CF.  The security guard downstairs ushered us into the only operational elevator and off we rode to the top floor still shivering from the cold. Once inside, they offered us outdoor seating under the heat lamps but that sounded absurd and declined.  With the dessert page open, suddenly cheesecake didn't sound as good as the items on the small plate & breakfast pages.  After much debate, I ended up w/the energy omlette--egg whites with sautéed spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was really good but also pretty filling!   The service there was mediocre.  We weren't impressed by anything specific and basically enjoyed a late night bite while looking out onto Union Square."
Melody L.,"New York, United States",77,88,18,3.0,25/6/2010,"One of the few places I've been with a 20+ page menu, which creates somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades situation; nothing is below average, but nothing really jumps out at you (except for their delicious cheesecakes)  You get great value for the food, but again, I never feel like I crave a certain dish from here. The mixed drinks are better than the food. Their competitive edge is still their cheesecakes - most of the times I come here because I am craving their cheesecakes, not so much the food. The large space and outside patio are inviting and good for large parties. The view of union square from the patio on a sunny day or night with clear sky is absolutely amazing!  Service is completely arbitrary. I've waited 2 hrs even when I made a reservation and I've gotten seated immediately with the seat of my choice. Some waiters/waitresses are impatient while others are helpful and attentive...kind of wish there is more consistency (towards the better side of course)"
Martin G.,"South San Francisco, United States",307,198,17,3.0,3/6/2010,"The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time you will really wait is when paying the bill. But I think they do that on purpose the more you wait the more time you have time for your food to digest then you get hungry and get a slice of Cheesecake!! haha We love to sit out on the outside deck when the weather permits. The only thing about this place that may keep us from going all the time is the calorie count did you know many of their signature plates have the highest calorie counts in the US!!"
kent c.,"San Jose, United States",45,266,364,3.0,17/5/2010,"Same ol' wait... Like it or not, this place get crowded mostly throughout the time they are opened til when they close. I had some relatives in town. I was told by the hostess that the wait would be an 1 hour for a party of 4. It was on a Saturday and we got there at 6pm. We didn't get seated until 7:45pm. I asked for the outside seats because it would've been faster, but we were still seated inside at the end. VERY disappointing because we came here mainly to enjoy the view.  SO, what to do you until then? You stare at the cheesecakes. or go shop in Macy's  =) I came to a conclusion that if you stick with the MISO SALMON ($20) your taste buds will be rewarded.   Hibachi Steak is very very tasty.  Strawberry Cheesecake ($7.50) - ultimate hardy bulge to the stomach.   I am still very torn about this place. It is a hit or miss for the experience (view) and service vs. food. ::INFO:: They only take reservations for the 1st hour of lunch time. Besides that first come, first serve to that lovely table."
Jess W.,"San Francisco, United States",66,554,528,3.0,16/5/2010,"I waited a hour for a table for 3 on a Friday night, which is pretty good. Do not come here and expect a table waiting for you. If you're lucky, you might get a window seat and the view of gorgeous!  The food is decent. The prices are the same at all their other restaurants. My favorite is mash potatoes and meatloaf since I'd eat it almost anywhere. The chicken wings, were way spicy. Sniffing it made my eyes water and my nose tickle. I am probably biased since I do not enjoy eating spicy food.  Anyways, I met a classmate that works here. He says that the waiters despise customers when they come in 10-20 minutes before closing time. They rather go home instead of serving you for tip. He also stated that if you piss your waiter off, they really SPIT in your food. So watch your mouths people!"
Anderson P.,"Oakland, United States",53,7,,3.0,10/5/2010,"Well I was definitely thrilled by being seated practically immediately on a Saturday evening. And outside at that. Another plus was order having my order out in less than 20mins. Although the waitress failed to bring the side of BBQ I asked for. Overall it was a break from the normal 1/2 an hour to 45min wait. But! And this is a huge ""BUT"" The drinks are a tad bit on the weak side. If I'm going to pay upwards of $9 for a drink I want my buzz worth! Outside of  that I didn't have much to complain about... This time."
Michael S.,"Ventura, United States",31,58,96,3.0,10/5/2010,Very busy restaurant...the food was not the best as most Cheesecake Factory's I've been to...but the VIEW was GREAT
Bonnie Z.,"San Francisco, United States",336,459,632,3.0,5/5/2010,"The full three stars are for the yummy cheesecake, despite being $7 a slice. But the tiramisu was delicious, rich, and pleasing.  Downgrade 2 stars for the ridiculously long wait and poor service regarding our tables. Came in with a party of 11 and we got split into two booth tables, so our whole party couldn't even converse with each other. Half of our party even came into the city an hour earlier to snag a table, but the total wait was still around 2 hrs. I guess that was still better than waiting 3 hours for a big table.  Food: I want to say that it's on par with Chili's and other chain restaurants. I got the Smokehouse BBQ burger (medium-rare). It came with onion rings and fries. The fries were nice and crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. The onion rings were actually stacked within the burger, but I just pulled them aside to eat separately. And the burger was HUGE. I ate half of everything and saved the rest for lunch the next day.  Price: A bit on the expensive side, which is expected from eating out in SF. What was NOT expected was that they still charged us a  18% gratuity for our party even though we split the bills between our two tables.  Service: Our waiter seemed curt and too much in a rush. He also insisted my friend order a different dish, because my friend's original choice ""is not as good."" Who says that to patrons? But our replacement waiter (Stevie) was wonderful and always refilled our water and brought us lots of bread and butter.  I don't think I'll come here again with a big group of ppl. Or at least I will not come for a meal. The better plan would be to eat somewhere else, come to CCF for dessert (take-out at the counter), and eat it outside in Union Square."
Kev M.,"San Francisco, United States",15,293,93,3.0,3/5/2010,"Choose from their enormous 40 page catalog/menu for an array of large plates of salty, seasoned cuisine made for tourists. I can't say I disliked the experience nor the food, but the place is for the tourist masses. If you're a local, you probably know this already.   Sure, I did too, but sometimes you think, well, let's go there. And well, it was o.k."
Jim H.,"Castro Valley, United States",165,121,10,3.0,27/4/2010,"This cheesecake factory serve the same food as all the other ones, but for some reason it has an average of 2 hour wait.  Maybe its just the novelty of over looking union square on top of macy's.  However, there are not that many balcony seats here. The food is not bad, better than most chain restaurants, the steak was pretty tender, and the salad portion is huge.  I guess the long wait cause me to deduct a star, seeing that I can drive to the cheesecake factory at corta matea or san jose and will probably get my food faster than if I just waited here.  And all the other ones got better parking lots too! The wait is just not worth it, especially with the horrible SF parking.  Which is why i usually try to weasel out of going to dinner event at this place unless I am allow to be at least an hour late."
Leejo J.,"Hayward, United States",3,28,,3.0,23/4/2010,"I like the location of this place and the whole setting of being in the terrace and overlooking the city. Other than that the food was Ok meaning the price is over-rated. Food quality is not the best have a little weak taste to it. I tried their Kobe Burger last time, the burger had no taste to it. I had to add hot sauce to add some taste to it. The place always have an hour wait. I like the crowd in there a lot of well dressed and high class looking party goers.. :) The food is also actually pricier compared to its quality or quantity. I would probably go there for like a special date. I guess its the location that matters. . :D"
Jh M.,"San Jose, United States",26,175,6,3.0,18/4/2010,i hate reviewing chains - just wanted to say this place has a great view of union square - and its entrance is strategically located on the furniture floor of macys - plop down for a food coma nap afterwards
Eric L.,"Boston, United States",81,5,,3.0,10/4/2010,Good service  but a baby was crying had some meatloaf with some mashed potatoes it  was okay velvet cake cheesecake was delicious till i saw the calories
Andrea C.,"Citrus Heights, United States",0,20,,3.0,10/4/2010,"I had been to the one in Sacramento just for some of that heavenly cheesecake desert but had never had any of their entrees. So I was in San Francisco with my friend the other weekend and we were hungry so we ventured on in (or should I say up?) I wasnt in the mood to be adventurous with some sketchy little restaurant. It was late and I was REALLY hungry. This place is located at one of the top floors of the Macy's Building in Union Sq. This place was super crowded. The hostess gave us a beeper and told us 15 minute wait. We chilled outside on the balcony until our beeper went off just 3 minutes later. Very impressive considering the size of the crowd. I was not expecting that at all. So yes, we were seated very quickly and I complimented the host on this. However, this place lives up to what everyone says. GREAT cheesecake, mediocre food.  My friend had a BBQ chicken salad and I settled on the chicken parmesean fettucini w/ sundried tomatoes after asking the waiter what he preferred because I was tired of staring at their huge menu(he had a bit of an attitude). I think he lied to me and just said anything to get me to order because something was a bit off in this pasta. Maybe it was my wacked out taste buds after quickly developing a 102 degree fever but something just wasnt right. It wasnt terrible and was a huge portion but it certainly was not worth $15.  So basically, this place has the case of style (if you want to call it that) with no substance. They put on a good show, but they dont put out."
arlene d.,"South San Francisco, United States",5,167,43,3.0,5/4/2010,BRING BACK TRES LECHES CHEESECAKE!!!!!! I was very sad to not see it in the cheesecake selection and was told no more..whhhaat? Excuse me? This was over a year ago but I found my new favorite Godiva chocolate cheesecake mmmm...with milk it's soo good!! Their food is not bad I like the chicken herb with the mashed potatoes. Their servings are pretty good too I always take at least half to go.
Shannel G.,"Round Lake, United States",39,179,16,3.0,5/4/2010,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Huge selection of food which will appeal to most everyone in your lunch/dinner party. The bartenders are friendly, though it does get pretty crowded as everyone is waiting to be seated.  The differentiating factor with this Cheesecake Factory is the view of Union Square and the fact that the population at the restaurant is likely more touristy. The only thing which disappointed me, was that when we were on the ground floor waiting for the elevator to go up to Cheesecake (8th flr), the hostess downstairs told us it's a 30 minute wait. Then when we got upstairs we were told 1hr and 15 min. We weren't in a rush, so it wasn't a big deal personally, but it was misleading and I didn't appreciate that."
Black K.,"Oakland, United States",9,205,161,3.0,2/4/2010,"Cheesecake Factory SF is good for only one thing, and one thing only... THE DESSERTS! Don't brother trying to eat there unless your comfortable with a 60-90 minute wait. And that's on a good day!  Unfortunately, being located on top of the Union Square Macy's makes this particular location a haven for tourists...and that really sucks.  The only good news about the intergalactic wait time is that you can take the escalators down one level an browse thru the Macy's home section while you pray that your ""personal Cheesecake Factory pager"" buzzes you up a table. lol So... If you like extremely crowded, loud, restaurants packed floor to floor with either tourists or teenagers on their way to the prom, located about 12 stories above the street with only two elevators and a escalator to get out... then you will LOVE this particular Cheesecake Factory... Did I mention the desserts rock! Better yet, just order your dessert to go and save yourself from the 90 min wait time... lol"
