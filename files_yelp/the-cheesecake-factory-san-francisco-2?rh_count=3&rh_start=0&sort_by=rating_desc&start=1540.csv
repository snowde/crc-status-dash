Nicole W.,"Pinole, United States",42,200,18,3.0,30/3/2010,"The wait here is horrible! Usually about 45 minutes for dinner and they don't take dinner reservations. But once you're in the food is great, the cheesecake is even better and there is a pretty view of the city."
Marie N.,"Reno, United States",4,114,3,3.0,29/3/2010,"1.  VERY long waits for tables.  I've never waited under 45 minutes and more often than not, it is 1 1/2 hours. 2.  Lines to get up the elevator and lines to get back down.  Second elevator is always broken. 3.  Bar area is far too small to handle all of the patrons that are waiting a life time for a table. 4.  Drinks, although tasty,  are very costly. This restaurant experience, my third in SF in two days, was the best and I find that hysterical!  The food was really good.  My husband had his third cheeseburger of the weekend and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I ordered the Thai chicken pasta which was phenomenal.  So much so that I""m going to try to recreate the recipe at home this weekend.  So you will understand when I tell you that I was absolutely crushed to find out that our waiter accidentally threw away my leftovers, of which there were at least one more full meal.  Luckily he was gallant and offered to whip me up another plate or get me a slice of cheesecake on the house.  I chose the Godiva cheesecake which is my favorite and will always be my favorite.  So, Cheesecake Factory saved the weekend gastronomically but I'll avoid this location in the future.  Walnut Creek is so much quicker..."
Sus... B.,"San Francisco, United States",215,252,4,3.0,17/3/2010,"I see it as an upscale Denny's with booze, which isn't really a bad thing.  The heated patio and the kick-ass views from the top of Macy's make up for a lot of the mediocrity though. As with many chains, there are huge portions that are available on a novel-length menu, with an additional Sunday brunch menu.  Drinks are pretty strong and rather decent, though I strongly suggest saying ""pink VODKA lemonade"" rather than ""raspberry lemonade"" in case the server thinks you want it without liquor (ack!). The food is average - not horrible, certainly edible, though I found my huevos rancheros a bit gloopy and lacking in spice.  Oh, and I guess they sell cheesecake here too or something?  I'm always too full to even want to look at a slice the few times I've been here. Naturally after eating here, my brother and I promptly caught the F train to Fisherman's Wharf in order to get chocolate at Ghiradelli Square, me clutching my leftovers in a Cheesecake Factory bag. All I needed was a big camera and a fannypack."
Lindy B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",88,192,104,3.0,16/3/2010,"I'm shopping, I'm hungry.  Haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in like forever (old Marina Del Rey hangout); so why not?  Well, it's 12:30 on St. Paddy's day parade day in SF and, well let's just say, CROWDED.  But I score a seat at the bar and sit to eat and enjoy.   The one thing I didn't remember about this place is the Menu, pages and pages of offerings.  Most of the items I wouldn't even consider for lunch (thousands and thousands of calories); but I settle on the Thai Noodle Salad, lightly dressed ($9.95) and a glass of Saint M (from Germany) Riesling when my bartender/waiter finally was able to look up to take my order.  Good thing I said ""lightly dressed"" because there was plenty of dressing on it; but overall it was good.  This chicken was cooked well, not dry, the veggies fresh, the noodles not all sticking together, and the wine was very very nice with.  Not a bad deal. LindySez: While I would have LOVED to have had a piece of cheesecake, I didn't have 10 friends to share it with, so my waist couldn't afford it."
Alicia A.,"El Sobrante, United States",120,183,299,3.0,14/3/2010,The thing about this location.. is the view from the balcony- quite romantic- when its not freezing cold.  Its also very classy.. with a bunch of mood light and over priced basic items like a cheese burger and fries.  But thats not why you go to the Cheese Cake Factory.. otherwise it would be the Burger Factory.. now wouldn't it? You go to eat 800 calorie and up - slice cheese cake.  Yum YUM. This is the part that freaked me out.. the fact that if you look at the cold case that holds the cheese cake.. each and everyone is labeled with the calories per slice.  I about had a heart attack once I noticed that.. how are you supposed to enjoy your indulgence.. if all you can think about is the freaking calories your eating?  You can't! Downgrade for the labeling of the cheese cake.. up grade for the excellent service and view..but ask for the balcony once it gets warmer.
Stephanie J.,"Walnut Creek, United States",17,154,,3.0,12/3/2010,"Cheesecake is always good and to make it into a restaurant and dessert place.. OMG. Yum. My favorite cheesecake here is the tiramisu and chocolate flavored ones. To die for! Heaven in cake form. When I get actual food here, I just usually order the calamari because it's amazing here. Super crunchy, perfectly fried and not chewy one bit. The waiters are always friendly. The bad thing about this location is that it gets damn crowded. Make reservations or go in the early afternoon."
guess w.,"Pleasanton, United States",0,86,3,3.0,10/3/2010,This Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. The location is sorta weird - on the top floor at Macy's. Odd. The food is pretty much the same as the other chains. As long as the wait isn't a bizillion hours - as it usually is - then it's a - ok with me.
Jade T.,"San Francisco, United States",156,325,1069,3.0,2/3/2010,"This is my least favorite Cheesecake Factory. I've always come here because whoever I'm with wants to come to the ""restaurant on top of Macys"", and even if it's a chain, I have found this location to always make dishes greasier than other locations. Not sure why... Service has always been okay, professional, but not overly friendly. Perhaps it's because they are always in a hurry. The wait here has never been under 20 minutes for lunch, 40 minutes for dinner. My suggestion would be to go straight to the top floor, then browse Macys after you have received your pager, otherwise those 40-60 minutes will go by VERY slowly. The view is nice on a sunny day or even at night, but probably not worth the wait unless you're really stuck on eating here. Everything else, it's your typical cheesecake factory.. with way too many options for food, a long wait if it's pizza, overpriced appetizers, and heavy duty entrees. Two things are great though (and those are consistent of every location I've gone)...  the cheese cake, and the drinks.. which have a tendency to be on the strong side."
Pineapple C.,"Orinda, United States",1,28,17,3.0,22/2/2010,I went on valentines day and there was 2 1/2 hour wait!! I had to go down the street to get something to eat because I got so hungry waiting. I had people practically hovering over my table while they waited to be seated. So crowded people had to wait in dining areas. Not romantic at all! I could barely hear my boyfriend talk. Definately did not live up to they hype around it. Waiters nice but brought wrong foods. Just wish I went somewhere else!
Colin P.,"San Francisco, United States",27,597,43,3.0,14/2/2010,Place was packed for Valentine's Day dinner--3-hour wait.  Great cheesecakes.
John G.,"San Diego, United States",20,211,,3.0,6/2/2010,"Good food and good service But this restaurant needs to have a more organized line, better service at the hostess/host desk to get a table! Once people got off the elevator -- everyone rushed toward 3 different girls taking down names and handing out those buzzers. It was Chaos at that desk. And the employees there did not take down names/people in any type of order. (Thursday, Feb 5, 7pm). This place would be great if there was a better system to take down names at the start of your restaurant experience at this restaurant."
Mimi S.,"Colma, United States",35,171,86,3.0,29/1/2010,"Ate here many many times only during dinner.  Every single time there is a long long wait.  Which becomes super annoying.  Tonight I came here for a friend's birthday.  We waited for over an hour, go seated, ordered our food.  I ordered the special Chicken Di Pana.  It was a huge portion for $12.95.  The buttery sauce was delicious, the chicken breast was deliciou, the mashed potatoes, and yes even the steamed mini buddle of broccoli.  After stuffing all of this in my face, my cousin pointed out a ""bug"" on the wall.  I looked, and it wasnt a typical ""bug"".  It was an effen ROACH ON THE WALL.  Making it's way up, down, side to side, and camoflauged itself by the seat.  We flagged down the manager and he comp'd our whole meal and gave us all the cheesecake we wanted.   ---- customer service was excellent ---- the food was mediocore but HUGE portions Even though we saw a roach, I would still come here for the food.  I just hope and pray they dont sit me back at the same spot where the roach appeared."
Oliver D.,"San Francisco, United States",87,68,58,3.0,12/1/2010,"I NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory before, but had the chance to on New Years Eve! Lets give this place a try...... My first impression as we waited for the elevator to take us up was that this place must be really good if it has its own customer elevator.... AFTER an HOUR WAIT! we were finally seated. ugh!  ""This place better be worth my craving taste buds!"" I ordered the ""Fish and Chips"" and an ""ORIGINAL Mojito"" The Mojito was REALLY good, but my ""Fish and Chips"" was just ORDINARY..... The cheesecake had to wait for another time, because i was too full =( the only highlight of this experience was our waitress! she was patient and personable..... CHEERS!"
Ekin O.,"Chicago, United States",18,66,27,3.0,9/1/2010,"The husband and I came here Sunday night to finally use that $25 gift certificate I had won in the holiday office party in 2008. I was worried it might have expired, but it didn't. The $25 didn't get us very far, but at least made a little dent in the total bill. The place was swarming with tourists (a lot of Europeans, strangely enough. I guess the size of the portions is exotic for them). Our wait was 45 minutes, so we pushed through the throngs to go over to the bar. Somehow we were able to hover over some other patrons who were leaving and snatch their seats on their way out. We had some drinks -- the Mondavi Cheesecake Factory Cabernet is actually pretty good and the mixed drinks are funny (very fru fru) but if you like sweet, you'll like them. Bartender was professional, curt, and busy.  Then our pager went off! Don't be fooled: when your little pager goes off it doesn't mean you'll be seated right away. It just means that you're supposed to go back over to the swamped front desk and then wait for them to call your name (additional wait time, about 5 minutes).  Our server was nice but, poor girl, seemed a little overwhelmed. She would disappear for 20+ minutes at a time. I was wondering if it was a smoke break or to quell her panic attacks. Either way, we were fine with the slow service because we wanted to take it easy. For us newbies, the menu took about 25 minutes to read anyway. It's very long. The sections are (more or less, in my mind I remember them as): Appetizers, More Appetizers, Little Bites that Are Also Appetizers, Chicken, More Chicken, Meat, Italian-American, Meat, Random Page of Some Stuff that Might be Reminiscent of Mexican, Cheesecake, Cheesecake, Cheesecake. We got the ""made to order"" guacamole which I was sad to find out was not made at our table but just made with the amount of spiciness we requested (mild, medium, or hot). I thought it would be more like Adobo Grill (in Chicago). Anyway, the guac was missing something but tasty enough. For dinner I got the 4 cheese penne (not authentic Italian but cheesy and very passable, and enough for 4 giants to split and still be satiated). Husband got the wasabi encrusted tuna tartar. He liked it a lot and surprisingly it wasn't that expensive for a big chunk of seemingly fresh fish. We sat inside which was NOISY but in a sort of fun, lively way. There's also the heated patio that looks out onto Union Square (if you're in one of the few tables that actually is set up near the railing) but the people sitting out there looking freezing. Overall, it was an experience. After hearing the Birthday song sung about 4 times, I got the feeling that this is a place where you go for a special occasion if you're a true blooded American who wants to eat and eat big when you're celebrating. I probably won't end up frequenting this establishment more than once or twice in the next decade (not because it's bad, just because it's not really my style), but if I ever want to feel like a tourist and take a ""staycation,"" or feel like a real American, I'd go again."
Oleg H.,"San Francisco, United States",208,561,28,3.0,2/1/2010,"""Really? Cheescake? OK - they have an awesome roof deck, but get ready to wait"" I heart CF on top of macys - but its almost never an awesome experience. Most of the time there's a wait, and last 3-4 times ive gone here there was a confusion with seats and food (specifically which table ordered what), having said that its probably expected considering the location combined with brand recognition leading to a highly crowded chaotic restaurant."
Jer W.,"San Bruno, United States",81,279,,3.0,1/1/2010,"My friends made reservation on 12-31-09 before I arrived at this establishment at 6:55pm.  They waited 20 minutes before me and after we all ordered some drinks(the hefewezein is not bad).  The wait was like over an hour for me.  When we ordered our food, arrived like within 10 minutes, I had the garlic noodles with chicken while my friends had the fried catfish and  appetizers were ahi carpacio and the avacado rolls with exceptional sauces.  The food/service is good, but disliked the long wait (with no place to sit+other patrons were sitting on the non-active escalator steps), somewhat pricy,and only had one elevator functioning at that time versus two."
Amiee H.,"Beaverton, United States",423,880,179,3.0,31/12/2009,"Perched on the top of the gi-normous Macy's right in the heart of Union Square, this particular branch of The Cheesecake Factory franchise is more hype than actual good food. The fact that it takes around 2 hours to get a table, really kills your mood by the time you actually get seated. This dining experience is at most worth a one time deal.  Food: Ordered some pasta dish, doesn't matter what it is, because it was so mediocre. My friend got some fried chicken with mashed potatoes, also sub par. And of course, for dessert, how could you dine at The Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake right? So we got the limited holiday Pumpkin Cheesecake and that tasted pretty good.  Ambiance: WAY TOO FREAKEN CROWDED. Everyone that worked there is way too busy to care about you. I completely understand that being so completely swamped has it's limitations, but don't you think a chain this big can afford to hire more people to offer better service to everyone instead of spreading all their workers super thin? The best seats are the ones on the balcony where you get to overlook union square. It really is a nice relaxing view after a long day of hustling and bustling around the city.  Price: SUPER SUPER expensive for NOT that great of food! That's all I've got to say.  Service: Decent for how busy they were.  Overall: There's so much hype for this place, that I'm sure everyone would go try this place just for the heck of it. But after one dining experience here, I'm sure you'd all agree that the food, the service, the ambiance and the price is NOT going to draw you back!"
Jenni Y.,"San Diego, United States",134,213,393,3.0,29/12/2009,I've heard that this Cheesecake Factory was super popular so I really wanted to check it out. I've gotta say that waiting an hour for a spot isn't really worth it even if it's on the top floor.  The food and service were all good and I don't see much of a difference from the one I've eaten down in San Diego's Fashion Valley  or UTC except that it's located on the top floor of the Macy's building. The view wasn't as great as I anticipated cuz we sat indoors and I got enough of the view on the 7th floor while waiting for a spot. I would've picked somewhere else to eat if I knew it wouldn't be THAT awesome since I could get the same thing elsewhere without starving myself. I only made myself stick around for that entire hour cuz I was really hoping for a special experience with this particular Cheesecake Factory.
Candice B.,"San Francisco, United States",105,565,,3.0,18/12/2009,"Cheesecake factory on top of Macy's has the decor and the feel of a cheesy Vegas casino: the busy patterns make you dizzy and nothing looks authentic or real. Much like the decor, the menu is a big fusion of anything and everything Americans eat. And again, nothing authentic.  By the time you finish reading the novel-sized menu and finally decide on what to order: something healthy of course, afterall, you know about their giant portions, the calorie book will make your eyes pop out and gasp for air. A veggie sandwich has 1000 calories? Wait, how many miles do I have to run to burn that off again?  Since almost everything has four digit calories, you might as well loosen your pants and go for something tasty. I chose the Cajun pasta, because it's their ""most popular"" pasta dish. It has 1,176 calories, full of grease and spice. It doesn't necessarily taste bad, but makes me feel so gross afterwards. And the funny thing is, I didn't even finish it. After filling up on orange juice, bread and a side of asparagus (only 43 calories, because it came steamed and had no taste), I could only eat a third of the pasta.  If you look at it from an economic point of view, $17 for 1,176 calories, is a pretty cheap ratio. But seriously, is that what America's problem is? That food is so expensive we don't eat enough?  By the way, after the glimpse of the calorie book, I was too afraid to look at the amount of sodium in each dish. I didn't want to have a heart attack BEFORE I even starting eating.  Their bread is super delicious though. So that adds a star."
Pam S.,"Upland, United States",589,656,482,3.0,16/12/2009,"First of all it is the typical Cheesecake Factory as far as menu goes... the wait is ALWAYS incredibly long so when we go we plan to sit at the Bar no further expectations than that. You can either take the escalators or the elevators. The view is breathtaking and truly a urban experience as far as getting the ""feel"" of the city. I recommend sitting outside at least once. The service at the Bar is always rushed for the Bartenders as they are handling drink orders for the tables as well. Our drinks were strong and tasty and the appetizers we ordered were plentiful. I do suggest if you venture up to the top floor of Macy's to try this Cheesecake Factory - come with the mindset that you will more than likely have a wait but hey your in one of the most beautiful cities in world enjoy the experience go browsing in Macy's... although I am not sure the pagers work that far =/ Respectfully Reviewed"
