Johnson B.,"Oakland, United States",44,103,114,3.0,15/12/2009,Came here after the Yelp Holiday Party...we didn't realize the wait or crappy service because we were too drunk. The best thing on the appetizer sampler is the avocado wrap and the chicken carbonera is the best pasta.  We had the salmon which was dry so we had to dip into my best friend's plate.
Courtney S.,"San Anselmo, United States",203,275,50,3.0,9/12/2009,"By far one of the most overwhelming menus I've ever seen. I had drunchies and I couldn't decide if I wanted a burger, some seafood, just a salad, or what! But I suppose this is a good thing as far as variety goes. I wasn't displeased but certainly not wowed either. This was my first Cheesecake Factory experience and people had me under the impression that it would be like food porn with a taste bud orgasm. I ordered Buffalo wings, which were good but not the best I've had. It also felt like we had to wait forever for the check, despite being one of the few last patrons in the place. I'll come back and give it a few more tries, but it'd be nice to leave more impressed next time."
Josh M.,"San Francisco, United States",37,55,,3.0,8/12/2009,"Cheesecake factory has been around for awhile now. I've been to a ton,and the SF location is the best out of all of them. On a warm summer night, try to get a outdoor seat, it's an experience.  I only come here when I have visitors coming from out of town since they usually want to be downtown. It's a great view and experience for them.  On top of the view, the food isn't half bad. If I'm hosting a group, I don't want bad food. I also don't want to break the bank for my travelers or myself. Cheesecake offers a good variety of food for a good price. The cheesecake is okay here, plenty of other places in the city do it better though. Also, try the smoothies, they are yummy! These guys lose a star for the long waits and sometimes shoddy service."
Sandy C.,"New York, United States",367,544,1513,3.0,6/12/2009,"My friends and I decided to come here mainly for the view. We got there and there was a wait. A 20 minute wait for the ""heated"" outside area and about an hour for indoor seating. We decided to go for the outside area since it was heated and of course the view. During our wait we went outside to check out the view and we were disappointed. They didn't lie to us, the outside was indeed heated - with patio heaters. Despite having patio heaters, just standing outside was really cold for us and besides clouds were forming, not a good sign. We asked to be seated inside and it was no problem. The food and service was good. And luckily, we made our decision to be seated inside because half way into our dinner it started to rain. Glad to be warm and dry...felt bad for those who chose to sat outside."
Kristy C.,"San Francisco, United States",47,7,,3.0,6/12/2009,"I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factorys to know that this one has a prime location on top of Macy's with an outside rooftop patio. From the downstairs SF car horns and street chatter to the view and quiet rooftop was so nice and relaxing. I ordered a burger and fries and my friend ordered a salad. They were both very tasty and yummy. So, the bad part of our luncheon was also the outside patio because of those DAMN pigeons. They are huge and walking around tables, picking at leftover bread in the bread baskets and flying inches from your head. It was very disgusting and I somewhat lost my appetite seeing all the birds flying around.  The rooftop patio was the best and the worse part of our luncheon which is very sad. Next time I go, I would want to sit inside despite the spectacular view on the rooftop..."
gEe C.,"Hayward, United States",83,105,48,3.0,5/12/2009,"If you come here to eat at this location you go for the outside seating on the rooftop patio, ya hear?   If the weather permits though.  Because, the view is just spectacular!  And I mean it.  I prefer grubbin' during lunch time because it's not all too busy and you don't have to deal with all the people.  But, everything else about Cheesecake Factory is the same.  Great food, big portions, bomb cheesecake, and the prices are alright.   Oh, and you can go downstairs and shop at Macys right after.  :)"
Kevin K.,"Oakland, United States",0,17,,3.0,5/12/2009,"This is the place to go when you have many people with all different tastes.  The food is not the best, but you will never complain about not having enough food.  When I come here with friends, I would say that the Thai Lettuce Wrap is what you should get to prevent a heart attack.  This place is crazy during the holidays so do come early to find a seat or get elbowed left and right or run get shoved away by the herds running out of the elevator."
Julia N.,"Elk Grove, United States",1303,601,65,3.0,5/12/2009,"I've noticed a couple of things every time I come to the Cheesecake Factory. 1) I never order the cheesecake and I don't know why. 2) I always forget how enormous the portions are. Wait, wait...I'm figuring this out as I type...The reason I don't ever order cheesecake is because the portions are so enormous that I get too full!! (light bulb flickers on)  I love the fact that you can order virtually anything in the universe at this place. They have everything from pizza, to shepard's pie, to orange chicken. None of it is exceptional per say but how can it be with a menu this big?! My last visit I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and the clam chowder. Both were pretty damn good. I got tired of the salad quickly, though.  On a nice day you should definitely sit out on the deck for some great views of Union square. Make sure you get here early, though, or be prepared for quite a wait. The lobby is always jam packed."
Tinna H.,"San Francisco, United States",736,931,150,3.0,30/11/2009,"The gray clouds rolled in. One could feel the air thicken with moisture. ""Out of curiosity, what is the protocol should it begin to rain?"" we asked our server.  ""You know, in the time that I've worked here, it hasn't happened yet, but we'd move everyone inside and remake the dishes.""  And then it became more than just a drizzle. The delicious bread was becoming more and more sponge-like in quality. We were reseated promptly, and our server personally made sure that we were taken care of inside as quickly as possible. Since we'd just ordered our food, there was no need to remake it. In fact, it was ready when we sat down at our new table. So the service is quite good. I attribute it to the restaurant being in tourist county, but I'm not going to complain. While you wait for your table, grab a seat downstairs in Macy's furniture department. Test out a new couch or two or three. You've got plenty of time. Just don't wander too far.  The food's heavy [lunch portions are usually more than enough for me] and basically puts you to sleep for the next few hours. You'll regret putting that holiday diet on hold for a meal at the Cheesecake Fatory [thanks Ryan V for the term!]. You might want to try out one of the beds on your way out."
Ryan V.,"San Francisco, United States",213,201,13,3.0,28/11/2009,"My first encounter with a Cheesecake Factory was a sign of things to come. No, literally it was a sign. The night was dark, and I looked up at their lit sign to find the 'c' in 'Factory' was burnt out and it appeared to be called 'Cheesecake Fatory' And I should have heeded the sign's warning. After a day of stressful shopping on Black Friday, almost anything will please my appetite so I thought what the hell, I will try this place. The result was mediocre food in which each bite was probably 100 calories, and there were many bites.  The service was pretty good actually considering the circumstances. After getting rained on outside our server personally made sure we got to a seat inside as quickly as possible without being unaccounted for. I then resumed my 100-calorie bites and promptly passed out from salt overload when I got home."
Randy W.,"Santa Rosa, United States",17,35,3,3.0,2/11/2009,"We knew this was a tourist trap before we set foot in the door, though my sig other was exhausted and she opted for the Cheesecake Factory in a moment of delirium. I tried to talk her into someplace else, really! It's SF for heaven's sake and we're locals, though we were playing the part of tourists that day.  We came around lunch time on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all for an indoor table. The wait was 20 minutes for an outside table. The service was really good actually, though they forgot the cheese on my omelet. Without making a fuss and even saying I didn't mind the lack of cheese, they comp'd my plate entirely and I didn't pay a penny for my dish. The eggs still weren't very good, and without cheese it really wasn't all that good, but it was okay. My gf had a salad that was super junky. The bread that was brought to the table was overly yeasty and was making me sick to my stomach just smelling it. Ewww. We were surrounded by worn out tourists. It would have been more pleasant had we sat outdoors. Do yourself a favor and walk one to two blocks off the square for better, authentic food.  2.5 stars."
e w.,"San Francisco, United States",8,432,1,3.0,1/11/2009,"I am surprised by how satisfied I generally am with this place and how affordable it can be compared with other places in the city.  I have never had a bad time at any ChF let alone this one.  For a shameless chain, this is top notch!"
Suzanne P.,"Burlingame, United States",0,2,,3.0,16/10/2009,"I was disappointed by this place for a couple of reasons.  Firstly my parents from out of town came to visit and we went to the Cheesecake Factory  for lunch.  All went very well, so much so that my parents wanted to go back. The service was not good at all and my wine glass was dirty.  Our waitress changed it for another dirty glass.  I then had to wait ages before I could get her attention to get a clean glass.  I was half way though my dinner before I even got to taste the wine.  This was pretty shabby in my opinion and my parents were so disappointed.  So not a great recommendation from me this time!"
Polette S.,"South San Francisco, United States",20,35,,3.0,5/10/2009,Went here for the first time for my friend's 21st birthday and I gotta say it was just like going to Chilli's or one of those types of restaurants...The view was very nice...San Francisco is just beautiful anyway...And it was super crowded especially because it was a Saturday and we had no reservation so our wait was an hour and a half which was all a blur since we had started drinkin ahead of time haha. Overall the food was good the Rye bread is super delicious and the Buffalo Blasts I think that's what they were called were pretty good.  Long wait for ok food in a well known location...That about sums it up!
Ying F.,"San Francisco, United States",636,342,458,3.0,3/10/2009,All I have to say is  Fried Mac and Cheese Balls.... You'll thank me later. Drools....
Kevin A.,"San Bruno, United States",42,45,73,3.0,27/9/2009,"so i went there with my girlfriend the first time. i knew it was going to be packed which it was. So we got there and were told to wait for 80 minutes which was dreadful but we did. there was so many people, and not enough room to sit. But we waited in total of 80 minutes because i wanted to eat there it was my first time. We were seated, took are order and ate some good food.food was served like in 12 minutes.  My girlfriend had some food that she wanted to take and i told the waiter if i can get it to go and  she said no problem and then she throw it away. i was like are you serious so i was thinking this is coming out of her tip and it did. then we ordered desert which took longer to get then getting the food.  i was disappointed it the waiter.  I know its busy but make sure you mean what you say (waiters). i mite not go to this place for a long time maybe for there BOMB cheese cakes"
Tim S.,"San Francisco, United States",33,43,25,3.0,27/9/2009,"Came here for a birthday dinner with some friends. I really don't understand the ridiculous wait time. Most of the food isn't that great, but some are satisfying. I've been here many, many times and service as well as the quality of food has gone down. To start off, an estimated three hour wait time for a party of twelve. They took down the reservation at 6:15, but one of us decided to break up into two tables of six. That cut down the wait time to about an hour. When we got our table, it was pretty obvious we could have fit 12 people. We got a corner spot, with an empty table next to us. Food: For appetizers, we got fried calamari (good) and I tired a tuna civiche dish that one of my friend's ordered  (good).  I got the Chicken Marsala. I haven't gotten this in sometime so I decided to try it again. I now remember why I don't order this. The bow tie pasta was under-cooked while the chicken was somewhat dry, but I overcame that by soaking it in the Marsala sauce. One of my other friends also complained that his pesto angel hair pasta was hard and pretty dry. I prefer Buca's chicken Marsala (a bit juicier, as well as bigger portions). One friend got a Kobe burger, good size but it looks like they've tone down the portion of fries considerably. I wonder how their burgers sell once the Burger Bar opens up downstairs.  Another friend got the Meatloaf. It tasted like meatloaf, somewhat over seasoned, but nice portion. Service was alright. It was busy as usual, but no specials were mentioned, nor any recommendations and we had to ask for some drinks to be refilled. Dirty utensils didn't help either."
Ann G.,"Kitchener, Canada",0,6,,3.0,24/9/2009,"We ordered the Original Strawberry cheesecake and loved it!!! The entrees were a-OK though - my hubby ordered the House Special burger, it looked mouth-watering but after stealing a few bites I was a bit disappointed, it tasted bland. I ordered a Tomato Basil Penne and it tasted too hard, seemed like they didn't cook them fully.  So next time we go (if we go again), I'd either get only one entree or skip the step completely and go right for the dessert menu!!!"
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, United States",266,876,2178,3.0,20/9/2009,"This place is crazy busy, especially on a Saturday night! One of my friends picked this place for her bday dinner. They can only accommodate 8 or less a table. We had a party of 12. They do not take reservations. We waited about an hour and a half to finally get a table.  While we waited we went downstairs to Macy's and browsed around. The restaurant looks nice and clean. Also, I do like how it is on the 8th floor and if you go out onto the balcony you can look at the view of downtown SF. Overall, the staff was very friendly and the food portions were huge! You always take home leftovers."
Stewie G.,"San Francisco, United States",1,50,,3.0,12/9/2009,"This place and the food is pretty overrated.  I just don't get the dark, Egyptian-like decor either.  What does that have to do with cheesecakes? Always crowded, chaotic, long wait, and the food is ok but not all that great.  I always end up feeling really full and bloated afterwards, even though I didn't even eat that much, so there's no room left for cheesecake.  Eating here once a year is enough for me."
