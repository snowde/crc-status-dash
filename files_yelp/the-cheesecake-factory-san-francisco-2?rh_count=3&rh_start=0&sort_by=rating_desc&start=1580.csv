Vincent K.,"Emeryville, United States",421,813,70,3.0,10/9/2009,"Why, damn you Cheesecake factory for always being so ridiculously long yet making me forget with your sweet delightful cheesecakes at the end.  I always feel like I can't be bought out of my first impression of you and yet you push my patience and in the end bribe me to walk away with a sweet taste of oreo still in my mouth from that cheesecake.   It's no wonder this place has a consistent rush of customers each time I come here.  I even tried getting reservations for a large group of people for a birthday, but  as expected, they said they can't accomodate but the best they could do is make us wait 45 mins.   But this time I was here I felt a little bit more mature and ordered what the old crowd drink: Well mannered Dirty Martini - quite the eloquent sophisticated drink and all that makes it well mannered, believe it or not, is just the stuffed olive with blue cheese.   still good though. -Jambalaya with shrimp and chicken in the cajun spicy sauce - a little on the overcooked side, but rather dissapointing since everyone was raving about this. -Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira very good with mashed potatoes with bits - A good value for the meal, I just love combos and this one was a great exception. -Avocado Egg Roll in the sweet sauce - still my favorite thing to get from Cheesecake factory As for the Cheesecakes, we went crazy on it for our two birthday friends: -Red Velvet - soooo smooth -Blackout Cake ala mode - chocolate chocolate chocolate -Vanilla Bean - probably the simplest yet fulfilling cake -Oreo - who can resist oreo (shakes, ice cream, cookies, and now cheesecake)"
Susanne M.,"San Diego, United States",11,123,,3.0,5/9/2009,"2 stars for the food (It's really nothing special people, don't be so easily fooled by their gi-normous portions), but gets an extra star for the LOCATION. The terrace is BEAUTIFUL to be on. I don't think you even have to be a customer to go on it, so just take the elevator up and enjoy the view of Union Square. Came here one afternoon for a late lunch, and had an Asian-pear martini (I said it was a *late* lunch :-)... which was yummy... and a quick meal. Portions are normally too large, but they have a lunch menu (I think available up until 3 or 4pm) which is cheaper and smaller in size. Still a bit big for my liking, but I didn't feel bad leaving just a little bit un-eaten. Overall, too expensive and nothing special, and the overall service is kind of crappy, but would be a good place if you have a group of people who all want to eat something different, and if you want to pay $12 for a yummy drink to a bartender who doesn't seem to care you exist."
Sarcastic T.,"San Francisco, United States",33,446,7,3.0,30/8/2009,"I'm shocked I'm giving a chain restaurant 3 stars. The lines are long, the chaos is un-real, no reservations allowed and I'm STILL giving them 3 stars. Each time I've been here the staff have been pleasant and they seem to have over-hauled the menu recently. The well-mannered martini is tasty and the thai lettuce wraps are so yummy. Tried the beet and goat cheese salad and the ahi tuna and was pleasantly surprised by both. The tuna was mild and pretty heavy on the avocado and the beet salad was small (especially for the Cheesecake Factory) but overall - it was all decent. Obviously a great place if you have kids!"
Jason Y.,"San Francisco, United States",480,124,,3.0,29/8/2009,"This place can really be hit or miss at times. I use to always come here to have my monthly business meetings as i found the location simple and easy. The one thing I was surprised about however was what seemed like an unbearable wait time to get seats. It is somewhat understandable as Cheesecake Factory is located right in the heart of Union Square in downtown San Francisco. I always prefer taking an outdoor seat because I like to look at what the city has to offer in it's amazing background. The restaurant itself is actually quite small usually having long wait lines that form. The bar area is a nice place to sit and unwind as your waiting for your table and a pager is given to you so you know when to come back just in case like you feel the itch to shop at Macy's just located downstairs. The food however can be be described as pricey. When I came here in the past I always enjoyed how I felt like I was getting a good deal but as the years went by, it felt like prices were going up and portions getting smaller. Since I am a huge pasta fan it is only natural that I order the chicken fettucini alfredo along with sun dried tomatoes and each time I feel that it tastes different. On one hand it can be perfect, another time it could be too greasy, another time it could have no taste at all. What I'm trying to say is that it's hard to build consistency here. If I were to order a medium rare burger here every week I would expect the same thing every time. But this is not the case. Maybe it's because they are so overwhelmed with customers and orders I will never know but I feel that there are many other places that I can go to that will ofter me the same things at a better price and better consistency."
Claudia M.,"Fort Shafter, United States",160,316,200,3.0,11/8/2009,I came here for my friend's birthday on a sunday afternoon and the place was packed. But the wait was only 30 minutes so it was normal for me. The waitress we had was very polite and friendly. I ordered the terriyaki with steamed rice plate. It was $15. Very pricy for a plate filled with rice with a small slab of terriyaki. I thought it was way overpriced for my plate. Overall I think the atmosphere and the waiter service is great but this place is just very pricy for small dishes.
Kelly G.,"Santa Clara, United States",318,1356,191,3.0,3/8/2009,"While the food is all the same in all the Cheesecake Factory... it makes for a familiar face in the midst of all the San Francisco's wide array of fooding locations.  The view is nice from outside on the patio, but given SF's weather, you'll probably want to ask for the heating lamps on. Even with them on, the winds probably blow away any heat you might hope to get.  Friends and I like to come here before or after a showing at the Orpheum Theater."
Lauren S.,"Stockton, United States",497,702,13,3.0,31/7/2009,"Whoa is this place overpriced or what? I went here for half off day, woo national cheesecake day! Got the red velvet cheesecake that was a pretty gooey flavourful mess. I wanted to die with how rich it is. The service sort of sucked and it felt like they wanted us to leave when we were talking and just chatting in the brief sunny moment that was had on Thursday on the patio. Is it really summer?"
Catherine N.,"Oakland, United States",10,61,52,3.0,30/7/2009,"Indeed this destination is quite the tourist attraction, but its a perfect getaway for great cheesecakes.  Its a great treat for my little cousins. They love the sweet cheesecakes and I find the wait to be satisfying, the place is constantly hustling with excitement. Teaches these cousins of mine the virtue of patience!!! And plus, while waiting you can stand outside and stare out at Union Square and the city, the busy come and go atmosphere is quite interesting to observe. The waitress was very polite, humorous and understanding of my cousins (5 and 7). They didn't shy away. So first off we got the Sliders, and the Favorite Appetizers. And that was all we got. It was a lot of appetizers among 2 adults and 2 kids. I didn't even move on to the entrees. By the way, I loved the Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce, it comes with the Avocado Eggrolls. They have awesome sauces. The Spinach and Cheese dip was exquisite. Last of all, halfway through the appetizers it was the big moment for those kids, cheesecake!!! It was pure bliss for them and ME!"
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, United States",570,1888,1488,3.0,30/7/2009,"This is my least fave Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area. Why? Because every tourist goes here. Even though we're not supposed to, I still go down one floor to Macy's and sit on the couches. HA."
Christina C.,"Bradley, United States",0,12,,3.0,26/7/2009,"Was there at night, about 8:45 p.m., thinking maybe we missed the dinner crowd and it wouldn't be that busy.  Wrong.  It took us 45 minutes to wait for a table. Told the hostess that we wanted a table inside, but we got a table outside. Explained to the hostess (a different one) that we had requested for an inside table. Took about 10 minutes to get it all straightened out, and another 15-20mins to wait for an inside table.  The waiting area was very crowded. Kids were hanging off the counter where the hostesses were working. Kids were running everywhere. It was loud, no wonder the hostess didn't hear us say we wanted inside table.  Ordered the healthy option grilled chicken while my bestfriend had their 3 cheese pasta. My grilled chicken was delicious. It came with jasmine rice, 3 chicken breasts, and asparagus. Yummy! My friend loved her dish. Portions/servings are large - I had to pack mine in a to-go box because I couldn't finish my food.  We ordered 2 different cheesecakes - i had the good ol' regular plain cheesecake while my friend had the lemon raspberry kind. We took it home because we had absolutely no room left in our belly. :) It was still good when we ate it for breakfast the next day.  Drinks refill - none - waitress didnt even come to check on that. :(  So... food and portions score big for me. But their service could use a little polishing."
Ravo Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,251,1608,3.0,22/7/2009,"Came here after my visit to the de Young museum to see the YSL exhibit back in December.  It was a longgg wait for a table for two.  I suppose it's worth it if you're a tourist and really want to take in a view of the city with their outdoor seating, but we just sort of wanted to eat.   It was my second time eating here, the first time I sat indoors, but this time we were lucky and got a seat outdoors.  It was kind of cold that day, but they had nice heat lamps to keep us warm outside.   Love the unlimited strawberry lemonade, super fab."
Martin W.,"CA, United States",6,18,,3.0,13/7/2009,"I've been to this particular location about four or five times so far (all for special occasions) and I just can't give it more than three stars.  To be honest, I gave it an extra star just because of their cheesecake selection (which is actually really good!).  The food is mediocre, my sister got this jambalaya dish and it was really bland.  I mean the appetizers were better than the entrees...why?!   The service was pretty slow; I don't know whether our server had a lot of other tables to care for or if she was just really slow.  Either way we didn't get our drinks refilled and I guess they don't really do quality checks.  It wasn't until we were almost done with our entrees where she then came and asked how everything was.   It was both the lack of service and the quality of the food that brought  this place down two stars.  They do have a large selection, but maybe if they shrunk the menu down a little and focused on quality...that might actually help them out. Also...the all white uniforms = stupidity...saw this one guy working there with white jeans...he had something brown on the backside of his pants...maybe chocolate sauce.  Still, it looked pretty horrible hahaha!  When will they learn."
Tony T.,"Beaverton, United States",1,18,,3.0,11/7/2009,"Although there is always a long wait, this place is worth it if you are really hungry! They have huge portions and most of the things I have tried were pretty good. The only thing I did not like was the chicken jambalaya pasta. It tasted like it was overly peppered. I do not know so much about Italian or Cajun foods, and maybe it just did not cater to my taste but I did not enjoy it. The prices are expensive, but when you find a dish or things you like, the Cheese Cake Factory is a keeper. One dish that I do love is the spicy chipotle chicken pasta dish. It has a spicy kick to it that I like and the flavor was delightful. It was a good experience overall eating the dish because it was sweet but had a spicy kick to it, and it was soft and chewy yet it had a crunchy bite to it also. The dish is delicious and I want to have another plate the next time I come back."
Greg G.,"Alameda, United States",1435,408,1580,3.0,10/7/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is the ULTIMATE 3 STAR restaurant.  It isn't great, but it doesn't totally stink. You can slice it right down the middle. Pros: The place is grand. Everything here is big. The restaurant decor has a fine dining feel while still clearly being incredibly casual. The view of Union Square is nice. The menu is HUGE, and there are (probably) literally hundreds of options to choose from. Portion size is big- too. Free bread baskets are warm- and the cheesecake is awesome. Cons: This place is SO big that it takes forever for a waiter to reach you. There are tourists (with KIDS) constantly banging on the booth directly behind you. Even though the menu is so huge, EVERYTHING tastes similar. All pastas taste the same- all Mexican options taste similar. Prices are high. This place is awesome if you have a gift card- but if you go expect to drop at least $60-$80 (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 cheesecake). Expect your food to be good, but don't get anything similar to what your date is getting or it will taste the same. Expect to enjoy yourself, but to wait forever for your water to be refilled since there are SO many other guests eating here, too."
Hasham Y.,"Philadelphia, United States",60,256,,3.0,5/7/2009,"this place always have a 1 hour wait unless you come after 9:30pm. Patio seating in summer over looking Union square is definitely worth it. On my recent visit i tried there salmon ( bbq) and it was delicious. I don't remember seeing ti before so it has to be there new offering as other wise i was missing out On different occassions i have tried crab cake sandwich, shrimp sandwich and tuna salad and have always left very contended. It is defintiely a bang for your buck"
"Wong, D.","San Francisco, United States",18,28,,3.0,25/6/2009,I haven't visited in awhile but I've eaten at this location several times. I'd say waiting for a table with a large party can be annoying but the large portions they give you once you get seated and have your meal are mostly worth it. I stick with the usual type dishes such as a sandwich or teriyaki chicken. I don't tend to go with the more exotic menu items. The service and food have been above average on the ocassions I've eaten there.
Maggie L.,"San Francisco, United States",23,113,4,3.0,21/6/2009,"I have been here way too many times and the only reason my party and I would wind up here is because it's conveniently located and it has a pretty big menu. I usually get a burger or the chicen piccata. The chicken piccata is huge so I would recommend splitting it. You must order a piece of cheesecake if you come here otherwise it's just a waste. Keyword is CHEESECAKE. Do not get some other common dessert. My absolute favorite is the Toblerone cheesecake. I wouldn't order any of their drinks, looks mostly like expensive smoothies to me.  Yes, this place gets crowded and I don't understand why they refuse to take reservations. I usually don't mind waiting in the lobby because my friends and I just gawk at the cheesecakes. The best place to sit is outside, the day or at night. You get a really great view of the St. Francis hotel."
Angela K.,"Fullerton, United States",5,256,,3.0,20/6/2009,My group had to wait for over an hour for a table on a Friday night. I really like their chocolate bread as appetizer and their Ghirardeli cheesecake.
Chuck N.,"Washington, DC, United States",182,832,2677,3.0,18/6/2009,"TOOO. F'ing. Croooooowwwwded Meng! Which I guess is a testament of this restaurant's success, but DAYUM the long lines can sometimes act as a strong enough deterrent.  TIP! My buddies and I got here one time on a Saturday eve at 6:30PM the week prior to Christmas, prime time traffic. We ordered our entrées for take-out. We played throughout the building and returned 30 minutes later. Took the grub and went across the street to eat on the tables at the square/plaza. No wait, fresh food, and a vibrant environment. It was the best idea ever!  Final Call: *Unless you've got patience and can wait for 30 minutes plus, a party of more than 2-3 here is not a good idea.  --------------------- Me Gusta: 1. Portion per dollar      -it is kinda expensive for the type of food, but you get a butt load         (holla!). 2. Avocado eggrolls      -good with or without the accompanied sauce 3. Good service      -replenished bread and water promptly and plentifully Constructive Criticism: 1. Boo to the 30 min+ waiting periods! 2. I'd actually be willing to pay less for less food (I always leave with a doggie bag)"
Annie T.,"San Francisco, United States",505,653,11,3.0,7/6/2009,Sit at the bar... you'll get quicker service if it's crowded. Best item on the menu is the blue cheese stuff olive dirty martini. You can skip everything else. :)
