Heather C.,"Rancho Cordova, United States",61,32,7,5.0,21/9/2014,"So earlier today I had my very first experience at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I'm from Sacramento but was here for my best friends small intimate wedding and the entire wedding (all 13 people) went here for dinner around 4pm.  Yes we waited about an hr and a couple of minutes but we were a big group and man was it worth it. Mind you I've heard pretty mediocre/ bad things about this restaurant chain all around but the food was amazing! I ordered the Louisiana spicy pasta dish with the crispy chicken and it was such a huge portion and mouthwatering good. And then there was our waiter Steve. Steve is awesome, clearly knows what he is talking about, super helpful and nice, and constantly refilled our bread and drinks which is huge for a big group. He also volunteered without us asking to take a photo of everyone for us. Such an awesome waiter. Steve you rock! Sincerely that weird loud group of 13 people you had this Sunday night. Thank you!"
Shaun W.,"San Francisco, United States",139,236,676,5.0,20/9/2014,"They got the perfect location - overlooking Union Square.  It's pretty when sitting outside and if it's cold, they turn up the heat lamps.  My favorites here: Steak Diane and Tex Mex Eggrolls.  Drinks?  Sour Apple Martini and Georgia Peach.  Yes and Yes!  The service is usually good, but beware of expecting quick seating and service when you visit during peak lunch and dinner hours.  I recommend going during off peak hours for best service.  Portions are large  - sometimes so large that you have no room for dessert.  If you have a nice phone and love taking pictures, take some of the food/drinks and post them to social media.  CF follows me on Instagram and Twitter and have reposted my pictures."
Jorge L.,"Campbell, United States",0,1,1,5.0,9/9/2014,"Ashley the waitress was amazing, the wait was a little long but the service was excellent."
Alvaro H.,"San Francisco, United States",49,3,,5.0,3/9/2014,"I like this place. Everything I tried was good, large sizes and very good views. Recommended. Probably very tourisitic and overcrowded on weekends but it is worth it."
Angel P.,"Sacramento, United States",27,46,12,5.0,30/8/2014,"I ordered the Chicken Alfredo with Chicken and fresh grated cheese to my likings; the pasta sauce was super creamy and flavorful! Chicken wasn't too oily or not too dry, just perfect. It's a lot for one plate and person! At the end of your dinner, get yourself so,e Cheesecake, worth getting! Great customer service also! Only com is the waiting but also worth it! If you go at night, the view is beautiful!"
M. R.,"Napa, United States",1,50,,5.0,23/7/2014,Love this place and the view OMG! Foods always wonderful and service is great. If you are looking for something to eat that is fresh and delicious I would recommend the Thai lettuce wraps to die for!
Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, United States",820,1466,1100,5.0,22/7/2014,I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory but this location since it's on the 8th Fl and you get nice views of downtown. I was staying a few blocks away and we decided to come here for dinner.  The food was great as you can expect it in any of the Cheesecake chains.
Sanaya S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,7,5.0,20/7/2014,The staff there gets the five stars more than the cheesecake. Ofcourse the cheesecake is delightful but the staff has immense patience and it is a delight to be served by them. I had the red velvet cheesecake and it needs no explanation. It's amazing and moist and creamy!!!!!!
Elenie V.,"San Pablo, United States",292,82,27,5.0,17/7/2014,Was cool. Although I wish there were cheesecake samples because he ghiradelli chocolate cheesecake was too sweet and not good.
Victoria L.,"Daly City, United States",19,14,5,5.0,15/7/2014,"I love the big portions they have every time I go and visit. I remember the last time, my sister, mother, nephew and I went, we ordered a kid's pizza, a pasta and cheesecake. We were extremely full! Love the service and where it's located. They're easy to reach and in the middle of a place to shop!"
Hannah W.,"Outer Richmond, San Francisco, United States",7,10,8,5.0,13/7/2014,"Excellent service despite the 1 hour wait to get a table! Got the balcony seat thankfully! It was a nice, breezy, weekday night and it was still extremely busy! Shoutout to our waiter, John (I think!?) who was only there on his 2nd day yet still did an even better than great job! I ordered some kind of pasta, with roasted tomatoes - I really do love tomatoes. And the sauce was very minimum, I thought that would be a problem until I realized how juicy the tomatoes were! Delicious! And the Cheesecake! Oh, don't even get me started on the cheesecake. Considering that I am very lactose sensitive and don't take in dairy products very well at all, I still insisted on trying their cheesecake and I did not regret it one bit. I had a very great experience at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Abhishek Y.,"Philadelphia, United States",117,165,6,5.0,25/6/2014,"Just stopped by to get some cheesecake, and it was a great decision. My buddy and I had just finished catching up at nearby Irish staple Lefty O'Doul's, and we swung by to check out dessert offerings. The place was PACKED, even on a Monday night, and so we just got it to go so that we could enjoy the cheesecake in peace in the Westin lobby (where I was staying). We got the original, strawberry creme, caramel praline, and the mango key lime slices. To be fair, two of the slices were for other people, but we dabbled in tasting all of them along the way. They were all heavenly, and came packaged well with a dollop of whipped cream on the side, and in all, it was a great product. Even with how busy the place was, they were quick to serve us, and while it was pricey, the service was pleasant and they were nice. Further, the only downside is the elevator/escalator ride to get up there, but it's just a minor inconvenience."
Christian J.,"Stockton, United States",17,28,15,5.0,6/6/2014,"ive been here 3 or 4 times and i have yet to have terrible service like everyone else is saying. service for me has been mainly good and the food for me has been coming out faster than i expected. the food is great especially for the price you pay. i dont recommend eating outside while its cold or windy because even though the heat lamps are on the highest setting, youll barely feel it.  i highly recommend the katsu chicken. my new favorite dish."
Seline Y.,"Manhattan, United States",0,9,1,5.0,3/6/2014,Love the food... especially the cheesecake and every one (with only 1 exception) I met who works here was extremely nice. I come here almost everyday when I'm in SF. Love it!

Lanie L.,"San Francisco, United States",1427,675,2300,5.0,29/4/2014,"For a restaurant that has over 200-300 menu items (I can't even guess), hundreds of seats, and more servers than any other restaurant in a mile raidus, I am pleasantly surprised by my visit here. Also, with that many food choices, there was bound to be a vegan thing or 2 I could eat. My boyfriend received some cheesecake factory gift cards and I just got a new job, so we decided to have a date night and celebrate! I've actually stopped here on a few occasions not to eat, but to speak with the managers about upcoming work opportunities. Each time I've been here, there's always been at least a 15 minute solid wait. Even then, the hosts have always been helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. They don't cave under the dozens of families crowding around their desk, waiting for a table. This time, my bf and I walked in and were seated immediately. Our server, (Jennifer I think?), greeted us immediately, and brought us water and bread. You'll have to take a good 15 minutes to look at the drink menu, BEFORE you even think about food. And after that, good luck sifting through the ridiculous food menu! There's even a menu WITHIN a menu-the skinnylicious menu which basically highlights the same dishes that are already inside the regular menu! Luckily, our server was so helpful, she immediately pointed out some vegan friendly appetizers and ran to the back to check if a few vegetarian ones were vegan friendly or not! We ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate (my first time doing that!), and settled on the Thai Lettuce wraps, with avocado instead of chicken. But you could also do portobella mushrooms or eggplant! The lettuce wraps were delicious! It definitely kicks PF Chang's lettuce wraps out of the water. sorry Changs, but your dumb-ass ""special"" sauce does nothing on the THREE amazing sauces they provide here. Plus, they use quality butter-leaf lettuce and provide a myriad of veggie choices! We licked the plate clean! It was so good! For entrees, I went for Evelyn's favorite pasta dish-or something of similar name. The penne is vegan-friendly and it is tossed with broccoli, eggplant, garlic, tomatoes, pine nuts, and olive oil. It is simple but flavorful! I was actually impressed by the food choices.  And of course, portions were hefty, and the timing was done right! Remember back in high school when you would grab all your buddies and eat at the cheesecake factory? $30 got you 1 dish, 1 dessert, and a cup of water? Well this isn't high school anymore. Today, we spent the big bucks (we went way over our gift certificate limit), and I couldn't be more satisfied. I'm sure that your experience here is a definite hit or miss, but you can't discredit them for the times they do it right! Thanks for the great service, food, drinks, and atmosphere! I'll cheers to that!"
Brooklyn A.,"Oakland, United States",2,7,,5.0,21/3/2014,Seriously love this restaurant! Everything I've had has always been amazing! If you love crab I recommend the crab bites!
Tj J.,"San Francisco, United States",12,40,5,5.0,19/3/2014,"7$ for a ccheesecake this good is worth it. Authentic, and homemade!!! What more can you want?? Good luck tryna get a seat outside cause its ALWAYS packed."
Benjamin I.,"San Francisco, United States",54,288,42,5.0,16/3/2014,"Every time that I have been to The Cheesecake Factory here in town, I have really enjoyed the experience.  The atmosphere really couldn't be any better (sitting on a terrace overlooking Union Square), the service is as friendlier than most restaurants in town, and the food is good, reasonably priced, and always consistent."
