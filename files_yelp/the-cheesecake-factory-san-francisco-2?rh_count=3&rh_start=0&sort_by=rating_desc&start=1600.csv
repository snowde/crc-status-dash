Stephanie J.,"Singapore, Singapore",136,280,11,3.0,31/5/2009,"The service was below par but the food was outstanding! Salmon rolls, calamari, spicy chicken sandwich and strawberry cheesecake were all to die for. Extremely large portions made the price worth it. And washing this all down with a vodka martini made for a great night indeed! I can't wait for warm weather so I can sit outside and overlook union square."
Trisha H.,"Reno, United States",63,258,16,3.0,19/5/2009,"One of my fav resturants...but not too sure if I like eat at this particular one. We did go on a Friday afternoon, if that makes a difference, but it was beyond packed. The wait wasn't that bad, 20 mins and we roamed the furniture section in Macy's for bit. Then decided to go back and wait in their very small waiting area. Everyone was jammed in there. Finally seated was just like we were waiting. We were seated by the bar and people continuously roaming around. A couple even sat at our table to wait, they asked of coarse, we said that it was fine. But the Staff ushered them out quickly or not really out, but away from our table. There is just not enough space to accommodate the volume of people. SO if you have been to Cheesecake someplace else, leave it at that. This place is the same as all the others. Same food, lots of people....maybe only different is, if you set by the window or outside, you will get a view!"
Jen C.,"Oakland, United States",52,101,2,3.0,28/4/2009,"Most of the time the service is good and the food is tasty.  I've been here several times and never really had a major complaint except for their takeout. It's really bad.  One time it took over forty minutes for my food to come out and the only thing the manager had to say was, ""it's definitely worth the wait!"" WTF??!!   The second time wasn't as long but they messed up the order.  I usually just come here if there is something I am craving or if I have friends on town that want to eat there.  Otherwise you get  what you expect from any chain restaurant."
Nicole L.,"San Francisco, United States",10,20,2,3.0,14/4/2009,"I never understood why so many people LOVE this place. Every time my parents come into town, we HAVE to come here. I hate it. You're surrounded by annoying tourists wearing fanny paks and carrying tons of shopping bags that crowd the lobby. You end up waiting for a friggin hour and a half just to get seated. The only food options are heart attack-on-a-plate; over done with cheese, dressing and mayo, then fried. Their alcoholic beverages are not ""amazing"" (how my waiter described them), and frankly, overpriced.  The only reason why I put up with the annoyance of the cheesecake factory (aside from pleasing my parents) is, well... their cheesecake. Preferably their banana cream cheesecake. It's so tasty and almost worth dining at the cheesecake factory.  The restaurant gets one star, but their cheesecake gets 5 stars."
Ivy S.,"San Rafael, United States",0,19,4,3.0,10/4/2009,"Actually, the wait was not that long and my group was there on  a  busy sunday for lunch. What was disappointing was the service!!! Our waiter was unattentive and really slow. Maybe because they were understaff that day. The food was alright but not great. We had the calamari appetizer plate which was good. The turkey burger was so so. The black out cake was moist and the low carb cheesecake with berries was divine."
Colleen W.,"New York, United States",559,251,101,3.0,23/3/2009,"Your average food chain. Simple dishes priced around 900% up for profit. I had Everlyn's Favorite  Pasta for about $13-14. Nothing fancy. Oiled penne pasta, sun-dried tomatoes dunked in olive oil, a few specks of olive, pine nuts, like 2-3 artichoke hearts, a few small chunks of eggplant... very simple. The Jambalaya looked very appetizing... Mmm...Service was great! The cheesecake wasn't to die for, but it was decent. We had the Lemon Rasperry, Tuxedo, and the new Blueberry cheesecake. The tuxedo as a bit sweet, the lemon rasperry tasted a bit too generic, and the blueberry... a bit too generic too. The Cheesecake Factory would be a nice place to go to on a warm summer night-- with your best buddies. Sit on the balcony and gaze out at my beautiful San Francisco. Gorgeous."
Maggie C.,"Fullerton, United States",20,129,82,3.0,23/3/2009,"Overrated! Yeah the cheesecake is good, but is it worth the CRAZY wait? Nope, but I must add, I am in love with their farfalle with roasted garlic!"
Steven K.,"Brooklyn, United States",24,243,,3.0,21/3/2009,"Despite our terrible service the food and setting were not half bad.  My friend and I stopped here for a quick lunch and sat outside on the terrace.  The view was beautiful.  We both ate the seared ahi tuna salad and had a bottle of wine, which our waitress said she was not skilled with opening and actually set the bottle on our table to open it (very bad).  Regardless, you get what you get-the Cheesecake Factory is not and never will be a five-star restaurant you go to for unique and new food-it is what it is.  The menu is too big, the portions the same, the desserts are common and also over-sized, the service lacking, but the prices match the quality and expectations too & for a quick lunch and a cheap bottle of wine in the center of the city it works."
Joseph N.,"San Francisco, United States",119,313,7,3.0,16/3/2009,"(2.5 stars) There are some things in life that I used to love, whether in childhood or high school or even a few years ago, that just don't have the same appeal anymore.  When I watched Top Gun (my favorite movie as a kid) as an adult, I was sorely disappointed to find that it's just a lame story with cool fighter jet scenes interspersed between scenes depicting  homoerotic behavior.  Cheesecake Factory, my favorite place to eat in high school, has been similarly revealed as another mediocre chain restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good for a chain, but in San Francisco you can do much, much better.  That's why you don't see any Applebee's or Chili's or Red Lobster or TGI Friday's in this city; even with their low prices they don't have enough to offer. The good things about Cheesecake Factory are its huge menu that can accommodate pretty much anyone and the giant portions that they serve.  The bad thing about this menu is that nothing is done very well.  The appetizers (avocado eggrolls are my favorite) are decent but I have yet to try an entree here that I really enjoy.  The cheesecake is ok, its strength comes from the stuff they put on it as opposed to the actual cheesecake, but it will definitely satisfy that craving if you are a cheesecake fan. This particular location is nice because of the outdoor deck overlooking Union Square and downtown, but it's also bad because with all the tourists the wait can be like 2 hours.  The bar gets overcrowded, and everyone is just happy to wait for the same shit they could get in their home town. With no wait, this isn't a bad place to come when it's nice out and you aren't especially picky.  It's a decent brunch spot on a sunny day if you can beat the rush.  But if you're planning to come at dinnertime, or if you want to sit inside, or if you or anyone in your group is looking for a really good meal, don't come here."
Pickle R.,"San Francisco, United States",329,741,69,3.0,6/3/2009,"yeah yeah, i should know better, but i wasn't paying.  :}  had champagne and the meat and cheese platter and not much really to complain about, other than being a tourist for about an hour."
Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, United States",512,1710,694,3.0,8/2/2009,"""huge portions, reliable cheesecake. love the tiramisu. ALWAYS busy and packed with people."""
Mark F.,"Kittery, United States",120,24,3,3.0,3/2/2009,"The Good: RanchHouse (Ranch Hand?  Something Ranchy) Burger, made with steak meat.  OMG.  Kick-ass!  And the fries on this thing...  wow... The Bad: Waiting.  Usually.  But the last time I went, there wasn't much of a wait.  Considering it was like, a weekday night after 10pm there shouldn't be. The Ugly: The bastard that kept going out into the balcony letting the cold air in. This place is a-aight.  And the waiters seem real knowledgable, friendly and helpful.  I'd come back.  But not on Friday night!"
James C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,164,3,3.0,29/1/2009,"Everything I've eaten here tastes great, but the wait is too long.  Also, the male waiters are better than the female ones.  The female ones seem fake, while the male ones seem authentic.  I think that's the case in the real world too.  I'm sure most people agree with me."
Steve G.,"Anaheim, United States",8,149,21,3.0,25/1/2009,"The wait, the wait, and did I mention the wait?  It is always packed here and on a weekend you can expect a 2-3 hour wait.  At least you can go down the escalator to the Macy's furniture section.  The food is just like any other Cheesecake Factory but comes with a nice view of Union Square."
Rachel L.,"Fairfield, United States",40,198,15,3.0,12/1/2009,"Thank god for the view because if it wasn't for the outdoor patio overlooking the rest of Union Square I really don't think I'd be able to tough out the +1 hour long wait just for lunch.   If you're claustrophobic, aggravated with waiting for more than an hour, and in a RUSH.... then The Cheesecake Factory is just NOT for you. There are Cheesecake Factories all over the bay but because it's right in the middle of Union Square it's one of the hot spot tourist-driven restaurants in the area.  The menu is a bit overwhelming but in a good way. There's practically something on there for even the finicky of eaters. Right off the bat I was impressed with how reasonable the prices were. With it being my first trip to the cheesecake factory I was anticipating small portions and a big lunch tab. I was pleasantly surprised and proven WRONG :)  It's a new family tradition where we sit and grab lunch at the Cheesecake factory the day after Christmas. Union Square during the holiday season is gorgeous! If it wasn't for the little one dining with us we would have probably asked to be seated on their beautiful outdoor patio. Despite having awesome warmers at practically every table we didn't want to run the risk of having our daughter freak out about the view and want to leave in a hurry.  My family's lunch party consisted of 6 people. They wait staff seated us at a really comfortable booth with more than enough room to spare. Service was speedy but not the best I had ever experienced. Our server was a total doll but there were a few occasion where we had to remind him a second time to bring extra sauce or to come back with a pitcher so he could refill our waters. TSK TSK.  The food was actually really good. I ordered the sampler while other people in my family ordered various burgers and pasta dishes. We all sampled each others food and were all impressed and satisfied. I was a bit disappointed that there were only certain cheesecakes that could be purchased for a party of 5-6 people. You figure because it's the CHEESECAKE factory they'd be more accommodating and understanding. What an upset.  Overall I enjoyed the food at the restaurant and would probably willingly come back on a WEEKDAY to hopefully avoid the long wait times."
Audrey K.,"Fremont, United States",47,41,,3.0,6/1/2009,"It is what it is: the restaurant on top of Macys. You'll probably have to wait awhile so don't expect a table right away. I think it's hilarious how hard on this place people are. It was pretty good, I mean it's no fine dining but they do a good job. The service here was really great. I love it when the server is cool and can take a joke. I can get a little sarcastic now and then and it really blows when they just dont get it. The people who served us here were a lot of fun. The avocado eggroll was pretty good and the pasta I had was not bad. I'm not a huge fan of the sugary drinks, but if you are this is your place because they've got a lot of them. The wine though was a good pick. The view up there is totally what makes it. I don't think i'd come if it were on the ground floor. Being outside up there makes this a fun place to eat!"
liz c.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,3.0,4/1/2009,"Saturday afternoon wait - only 45 minutes!!!!! There were 11 of us, so this actually was a great surprise. Our waitress was a sweety, kept up with the bread, was patient with every order and even took the time to refill my water. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad, one of my favs, but sounded excitingf because they added blue cheese crumbles and sun dried tomatos! I did see there was also mixed greens in the description, but when it came out I was quite surrised when the greens took up over half the plate. I was hoping for more tomato and cheese, it was the dish title after all. Think I am allergic to something in the mixed greens, but the tomatos and cheeses were yummy. Our waitress took the liberty of sending back one person from my party's lunch pizza. too crispy she said. but we didnt get the fresh one until only greens were left on my plate. nice idea, but not very efficient.  Good experience for such a large group."
Amy D.,"San Francisco, United States",257,80,,3.0,4/1/2009,"Too crowded on weekend nights.  The view on the balcony area was gorgeous and the ambiance inside was cozy and warm, but the wait was 1.5 hours, so we got our food to go and ate outside around Union Square.  The service was fast but not overly friendly. Nothing to write home about. If you can help it, I would recommend going elsewhere for dinner on a weekend night!"
Ryan M.,"San Francisco, United States",30,33,25,3.0,3/1/2009,"At around 9 pm on the last night of every tax season,  when everyone in the office is just about ready to go absolutely insane with stress, our boss gives the go signal to call it ""a season"" and head off to our after-tax season celebration. The usual target? Cheesecake Factory.  Only 0.2 mile away from the office and open till 11 pm (12:30 am on weekends), Cheesecake is convenient.  SERVICE. Well, first, you have to deal with the queue. I don't remember waiting for less than an hour, no matter what time I go there. So DO NOT go there famished, or you'll faint. And the maitre d' could be friendlier. The place is ALWAYS packed - a good excuse to grab a few drinks at the bar and wander aimlessly at their heated outdoor terrace overlooking Union Square. Servers are very chatty - the type who'd come to your table every 10 mins and ask ""Everything alright?"" (then of course you have to stop whatever you're doing to say ""yes, thank you""). But very professional as well. Waiting time for orders to be served is quite reasonable. FOOD. I love the appetizers and dessert. The main courses, I don't care too much about. The Fried Calamari is great - served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce. Also try the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - served with tortilla chips and salsa; Quesadilla - garnished with guacamole, salsa and sour cream; and Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls. Oh, and they have this complimentary brown bread which is very yummy. For dessert, the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake is outrageously delicious. For main course, I'd say the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon Combo - although the steak borders on being too sweet. AMBIENCE. Good ambience - can be romantic or family-oriented. Dim lights. Nice, elegant interiors with lush upholstery. The outdoor terrace offers a great view. Not a very quiet restaurant though, if you're looking for an intimate location.  PRICE. Not a cheap restaurant. I don't exactly remember, but I think average tab per person is about $25-$30. But the main course servings are huge - you can totally share a dish."
Joyce C.,"San Francisco, United States",21,58,73,3.0,8/12/2008,"The food here was just alright.  Nothing really left to say you know?  There's a bit of everything on the menu, average around $15 per plate.  The wait is far too long.  I went on a Thursday night and the wait was still 45 minutes. Though the cheesecake there was pretty awesome.  If The Cheesecake Factory won't make awesome cheesecake, who will?  It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory."
