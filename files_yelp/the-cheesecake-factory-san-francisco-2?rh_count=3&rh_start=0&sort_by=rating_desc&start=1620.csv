Steven B.,"Hayward, United States",88,286,49,3.0,7/12/2008,"I've been eating at this particular cheesecake factory for about 3 years. The service is alright. The first couple times I was there, the service was horrible.  The wait was about 1 1/2 hour, once we were seated it took 15 minutes for our drinks and about another 30 minutes for our food to arrive. But now I'd say things are getting a bit better. Shorter waits and better service from our waiters. The food is good and if something goes wrong, the manager will be sure to fix it, either giving us a new entree or a free appetizer of some sort. Overall, I think this place is just average."
Elise M.,"Los Angeles, United States",329,211,185,3.0,7/12/2008,"One star for the stellar location, atop the Macy's building.  One star for the bar.  And the final star for the Mac n Cheese balls. Actually, the balls alone deserve five stars, but this particular CF is such a clusterfu*k that it totally takes away from the spherical goodness. I worked in that Macy's for a while, and on the weekends we would watch the hordes of tourists head up the elevators only to come back down minutes later, having been told that there was a wait of an hour or more. Weekday lunch can be fantastic though, and during the warmer summer months a seat on the patio offers some choice viewing of city life."
E. C.,"Santa Monica, United States",1,22,,3.0,2/12/2008,"To reiterate what others have said: this place is a madhouse!  Packed, packed, packed, all for average-quality food.  Here is a hint: if you don't want to deal with the 90 minute wait, just hover around the high tables near the bar area on the left side.  These are first-come, first-served, and they offer full service.  So, be on the lookout for people finishing their meals and grab one of their tables.  Has worked for me."
Clementine D.,"San Francisco, United States",68,104,,3.0,30/11/2008,"I came here last week with my family, and it was busy as hell...but a party of nine people who came in after we did got seated first. I was sooo angry about that...we complained a couple of times and it literally too like about two hours and a half before we got seated. The managers were nice enough and apologized and offered 4-5 appetizers for free, which made up a lot...so in a way it was worth the wait, but still disappointing."
Alexis B.,"San Francisco, United States",118,393,2,3.0,19/11/2008,"Go in starving, order an appetizer, leave happy. If you aren't starving then prepare to be feed for a week with the doggie bag they give you. You definitely get your monies worth here. And while the food isn't AMAZING, it isn't crap either. And it really is all about the patio. Everything about the interior of this place makes me think they are joking. But they aren't. They are totally serious with the tack.  But in the end there really is no reason to wait in line for 90 minutes for a table unless you have absolutely nothing else to do and are waiting for the patio. Go somewhere that is an experience worth having."
Sonya T.,"San Francisco, United States",112,232,34,3.0,18/11/2008,"The reason why I am rating this now, is because I am f*cking hungry and nothing sounds better to me than a philly cheesesteak from the Cheesecake Factory with original cheesecake (topped with strawberries) for dessert.  YUMMY and surprisingly, cheap.  You can spend a lot here, and you just might, if you come during rush hour and have to wait 2 hours to get a table.  Here is a good tip -- try going at 830, it might not be too long, and you can hawk the tables in the bar area to get seated sooner.  And the pagers will reach all the way to the 3rd floor at Macy's (I've gone shopping many times, waiting to sit).   The buffalo wing popper thingies are also really good.  It's an appetizer.  I like Cheesecake Factory a lot."
Samantha R.,"San Francisco, United States",384,336,53,3.0,12/11/2008,"This is perfect for the people that are too lazy to make the extra trek to the food court but still can't help marathon-shopping...you know, the consumers who just keep going up (furinture, bridal registry, shoes, regular clothes, designer clothes, etc) and by the time you've got to the 7th floor they are like, ""I'm hungry..."" I am not a fan of the C-fact. Its like Vegas met up with the Sistine Chapel and said, ""Let's make a restaurant together, and don't forget Sphynxie."" Decor aside, the portions are extremely oversized. However, the dessert menu has a plethora of cheesecake (...shocker) and they are all pretty legit.  As far as locations go, I think this is the only C-fact I would review, because it is unique for one reason...the deck. It overlooks Union Square. It is a nice little city view on a non-rainy day, and I enjoy that aspect of the place.  mmm Oreo Mudslide...."
Jonas E.,United States,81,80,,3.0,11/11/2008,"So I went to the cheesecake factory for the first time in San Francisco and it's the same as the other two I've been to. It generally gets busy during the day especially lunch and dinner so we decided to try it during lunch and the wait was only 20 minutes so it wasn't so long. Once we got to our table which was on the roof the atmosphere wasn't so bad just  a lot of pigeons come around and annoy you so follow the don't feed the pigeon rule please. Other than that the food is the same, decent in taste and way more expensive in price. So I would think twice about going to this Cheesecake factory in the city because there is a lot more places to dine and get a better meal but I wouldn't mind coming here once in a while."
John-Michael C.,"Singapore, Singapore",1002,1228,300,3.0,11/11/2008,It's funny to go through the macy's entrance to take the elevator up. On a nice day the view isn't half bad - it's generally windy though. The only really nice thing this spot has going for it is really the location and that it's central to the area so it's convenient to meet up.  I have become fond of the corn tamale things here...I think they are appetizers. And honestly I don't know if they are a dessert or not.  All in all I wouldn't generally come to this branch. It wouldn't be my first choice but I wouldn't shoot the idea down either. I do have a certain level of attachment here. But I'd rather go to another spot around the corner if I could get last minute reservations over at the St. Francis. ;D
Narina A.,"Los Angeles, United States",146,154,6,3.0,4/11/2008,"If I go to Cheesecake Factory for a quick bite, I'm definitely splitting a meal with a friend because the portions are HUGE! I haven't decided if it's a good thing or not..hmm. A small Ceaser salad can be your whole dinner. In fact, it was my dinner once, and we're talking about a ""small"" Ceasar salad. Yikes! For those who complain that it's always crowded, well, think about, it's located at Union Square!!! And on a Saturday or Friday night (heck, even Thursdays), of course it'll be crowded. Lunch time is a breeze though. I honestly don't expect much from Cheesecake Factory, except to provide me with a candle if I'm sitting outside at nine o'clock at night (apparently they don't have enough candles). If I'm out downtown and just feel like getting a quick bite to eat, Cheesecake Factory is just fine, no biggie. But just that, nothing fancy. On the down side, the restaurant does not really live up to its title. I'm not really a fan of their cheesecakes because I feel as though they put a lot of junk (aka additives) to make it sweet. However, the tiramisu is not bad, though I've had better.  Lastly... I see tourists at the Cheesecake Factory sometimes and I can't help but wonder; of all the different restaurants in San Francisco, why come to CF? I live in SF and I rarely go to CF. It's a beautiful city with a LOT of various type of cuisine. Don't be afraid to try something new. Explore!"
Caroline J.,"San Francisco, United States",1343,192,157,3.0,26/10/2008,"Going out to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco is like visiting Italy and choosing to go to a Mc Donalds. With so many unique and delicious dining options in San Francisco, WHY would you choose to go to the same Cheesecake factory you could find in Sacramento, Chicago, or NYC? I don't understand why people settle for this restaurant and it's generic chain food in a city famous for it's culinary delights. I encourage you to leave the chain restaurants for boring road trips and enjoy the experience of dining in a world class city!"
Roy N.,"San Francisco, United States",43,243,13,3.0,18/10/2008,"i give this place only 3 stars because of the ridiculously long wait time, but it is a tourist place and the location is amazing for visitors to SF.  I actually go there just for desserts, which may not be worth the long wait."
G C.,"San Francisco, United States",11,8,8,3.0,5/10/2008,"I don't know why I keep coming back here!! This place is decent and almost never has anything new. I have tried many things here so here i go. Appetizers:  This place has really good appetizers. Top 3 would be Fried mac & cheese, fried calamari, and chicken wangs! Salads & Soup:   The ceasar salad is nothing special, the chop salad could of been better. The greens definitely could be more crispier. Soup sucks! I'm sure most of you had tasted something that has been sitting on a broiler all day. Entrees:   This place has decent entrees. My Favorite is the Jambalaya with rice. Pasta here  is inconsistent, sometimes there pasta noodles are hard. Any pasta with marinara sauce here I wouldn't recommend. The burgers & fries are good but wouldn't the kobe burger. Sandwiches are decent.  Overall good the first few times. But definitely gets old by your 3rd or 4th trip. Unless you go for your faves and order the norm. Another place worthy of checking out but nothing spectacular. Everytime I have been here I have waited at LEAST 20mins."
M W.,"San Francisco, United States",534,561,1264,3.0,24/9/2008,"My bf took me here tonight since i've never been here before and I guess my expectations were so high that I ended up being disappointed that it didnt turn out the way I'd expected. We got seated maybe 25 minutes after arriving and quickly ordered since we were both starving! We started off with the appetizer Boston House Salad and the crispy crab wonton- both were very good and the portions werent skimpy- I began to get full off just the appetizers! My bf ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and I ordered the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. We were a bit disappointed when our plates came out since the bow-tie pasta wasnt really soft - it wasnt really cooked all the way =/ (pasta is suppose to be soft, right????). I felt bad for bothering our server, William, about it but he was super nice and didnt hesitate one bit to take our plates back to the kitchen for a remake. The second time around tasted way better and the portions were so huge that my bf and I only ate 1/4 of our plates and took the rest home. For dessert we ordered the chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake which was just all right to me- it was really sweet tho! All in all I think the food here is decent and I'm glad to have finally tried it. This isnt a place that would make me running back for more.  2 stars for the food and 1 star for our friendly and attentive server William."
Valerie N.,"San Francisco, United States",27,612,41,3.0,17/9/2008,"their food are ook so i'll just give 3 star. i tried their cheesecakes, it's alright, i wouldn't say it's the best. the drinks are decent, but the raspberry and mango is pretty good. lastly, their pastas are mmmkay.  one thing i really hate is the long wait!"
Candy T.,"Hayward, United States",1,153,,3.0,15/9/2008,just another Cheesecake Factory like any others throughout the country; but always crowded; great services;
Samantha C.,"Sacramento, United States",205,258,15,3.0,15/9/2008,"Why oh why do so many people come here?  Yes, I get it, the view is pretty but there are plenty of other places to see the exact same view.  Further, don't justify waiting hours to eat average food so that you ""can see the view"" and then eat inside!  The food is average but always consistent, I can appreciate that.  Plus, who doesn't like cheesecake?  I don't mind eating here but it will be a cold day in hell before I wait 2 hours to eat anywhere."
adam m.,"Newtownards, United Kingdom",7,77,1,3.0,9/9/2008,The ridiculous waiting time for a table doesn't inspire you to give great reviews and neither does the pricing but the food itself was pretty good and the helpings nicely sized. The servers seem to be everywhere you look but never anywhere near your table when you need them. If you are after good American food then this place is a great example but there are plenty of alternative restaurants nearby offering better food in the same price bracket.
Cynthia D.,"Denver, United States",25,120,,3.0,2/9/2008,"After living here for several months and remembering that I saw people having drinks near the top of Macy's, I wanted to check out what restaurant was on top so that I too could have drinks and experience the view. I was surprised at first that a chain restaurant was in this location. Food/quality: I have been to other CF locations, and this was didn't measure up to other experiences I have had. The only good thing about this one was the drinks! As for the mexican style food I ordered, it was way too bland. My dinner companions felt the same way. As a chain, I realize it has to appeal to the masses, and attempt to be all things to everyone. But in the end, it cannot be mexican, or italian, or anything else...its specialty is its cheesecake offerings! Atmosphere:  The wait was over an hour long to get our seat on the outside patio overlooking Union Square. The view is the best part of this restaurant, and I suggest going at least once especially with out of town guests if only to have drinks. Service: The server was pleasant and attentive during the entire meal. Value:  I find it a bit overpriced for the quality of the food that you receive. The servings are usually big, and we did end up with leftovers, but as mentioned earlier, the food was bland."
riz l.,"San Francisco, United States",360,68,13,3.0,24/8/2008,"Out of all the things I could have ordered... I go for the soup. Ant got some tasty pasta, Gindin went for a sandwich, both looked great in their own right... I go for the soup. We just finished watching Death Race (unfortunately Stallone wasn't starring in it), and I came here to eat some sopa. The wait was at least 40 min, what can ya do its union square, tourists and travellers everywhere. I watched some youtube on my iPod to pass the time, had an anchor  steam too, then they ran out. Union Square has free wifi, ummm what else... Ok basically don't order the brocolli and cheddar soup."
