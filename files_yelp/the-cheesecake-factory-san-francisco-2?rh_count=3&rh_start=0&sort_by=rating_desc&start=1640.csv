Melanie V.,"San Francisco, United States",87,238,7,3.0,15/8/2008,"My boyfriend took me here for our first date. When he told me where we were going I rolled my eyes (internally of course, I didn't want him to think I was an asshole, at least not right away) Normally, I would never want to go here. The food isn't that great, the wait is always terrible and it's really, really loud. But considering how things turned out, it was a good time. Since the wait was about an hour, we were able to go downstairs to look at Christmas decorations and relax on the couches. We actually had some time to have a nice conversation before heading back into the din.  It's not my favorite restaurant (they don't even make the cheesecakes on site!) but because of the memories here it gets an extra star."
Mai G.,"South San Francisco, United States",5,84,3,3.0,15/8/2008,"its cheesecake factory on top of macy's in downtown sf. cheesecake, where ever it came from, is always good to me. there is a lot to choose from, dessert and entrees. american food to asian. ok to visit once in awhile. prepare for a looooooooooooooooooooooong wait."
Natasha I.,"San Francisco, United States",39,121,94,3.0,14/8/2008,Okie this place has the most sinful and decadent desserts. Ever. Every slice is filled with happiness and goodness that ll surely get you singing :) No seriously I love their desserts. The main course is nice too with quite a selection. Do try their avocado spring rolls and spinach and artichoke dip. Quite nice. Overpriced ? Slightly. Minuses:  I would love to give them 5 stars which i do wanna give them but the wait is awful :( It can take anywhere from half hour to an hour to get a seat...What???
Maria D.,"Denver, United States",301,1115,3,3.0,8/8/2008,"How much do I enjoy drinking outside? Putting up with the wait and with this rude crowd is how much.  Stick to the chain restaurant strategy: girly drinks, appetizers, free bread, dessert. Lest you end up with a totally overcooked burger, as I did."
Ada T.,"Pittsburgh, United States",94,288,190,3.0,4/8/2008,"I mock and I mock The Cheesecake Factory, and yet I still find myself coming here a few times a year. I tell myself that no restaurant should have a wait to get into the elevator (TCF almost always does), I tell myself that no restaurant should have a wait to GET A PAGER (TCF occasionally does), I tell myself that San Francisco has so many more interesting places to eat (SF does). But despite this, and my requisite Bay Area chain restaurant snobbery, I keep eating here because honestly, there just aren't that many nice sit-down restaurants in the Union Square area where you can eat for less than $20pp. The menu is enormous and clearly designed to please any crowd, and everything is cooked in enough butter to taste good. And their brown bread is legitimately delicious.  That being said, I hate how tourists flock to this place. There are Cheesecake Factories EVERYWHERE, people! If you are going to visit San Francisco, then do it like you mean it."
Thea G.,"San Francisco, United States",45,125,3,3.0,3/8/2008,"They are grossly over-priced, their brown bread is delectable however, their avocado eggrolls are amazing, and their mango margarita is to die for. But everything else - eh."
Christopher D.,"Dallas, United States",188,222,17,3.0,29/7/2008,"Everyone knows what the food at cheesecake tastes like.  This cheesecake is no different from any other, but it has nice outside seating for warmer days.   You can see downtown Union Square from the outside seating.  The worst thing about this place is the wait.  Usually I just wait at the bar and drink with my guy friends while the girls go shopping.  I would give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because I honestly think the food is pretty good for a chain restaurant, but the wait is wayy too long."
Merredith L.,"Noe Valley, San Francisco, United States",553,935,28,3.0,28/7/2008,"i hadnt been to a cheesecake factory in yrs... i went yesterday on a sunday evening around 5 something pm.  it was pretty much like the boston one i'd been to. a billion year wait (ok, 45 min but still). they got rid of the lemon drink i used to love. it tasted just like lemons. so that was sad. they did have that delicious brown bread i love. the menu is large, full of american food selections. i had chicken romano. the chicken was good.  i had asked for angel hair pasta but got spaghetti instead, which i'm ot a fan of, but i didnt feel like waiting to get more food, so just skipped eating the pasta. i had some of j's mango raspberry drink and it was good so if i ever come again, i'm getting that. service was pretty good, everything was fast once we were seated, no complaints. i just wish they took reservations instead of making people wait for sooo long all the time."
Margarita V.,"Richmond, United States",340,180,490,3.0,23/7/2008,The starter bread was good.  My club sandwich was great.  My friend raaaved about his mashed potatoes. My sista's luau salad was an interesting delight.  Overall we had a nice meal for a Monday afternoon.  The waiter was totally BLAH tho. He forgot my other friend's side order of mashed potatoes [he couldn't resist getting his own]... too bad he NEVER got them! ...sigh. We only waited about 4 minutes for a booth. That's probably going to be a big reason i would wanna go back. Maybe next time we'll get a nice waiter instead of boring bob over there.
Yohanna B.,"Novato, United States",93,139,,3.0,21/7/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is probably the equivalent of ABC or some other Chinese Cafe/Restaurant that has portuguese-baked chicken on the menu right next to the barbecue pork fried rice.  This is because the menu at CF is maybe at least a dozen pages long.  Some of their ""specialties"" include Baja Chicken Tacos, Teriyaki Chicken, and Chicken Piccata.  I counted 3 country of origins already and that's only the chicken section of the specialties.  Hmm...  I'm thinking Con-Fusion cuisine.  By the way, save your expectation for something else, these dishes will not be authentic in any way. Okay, I guess if you're going in a big group, it's a surefire because even the pickiest of the picky can find something he/she will not despise.  But if you're going in a big group, rest assured you will have to wait at least 1 hour.  Which means the crankiest of the cranky will be so upset that he/she will not enjoy the meal.   I do give props to them for the amount of food you get.  One portion of their entree can easily feed 2 people.  Easily.  Flavor-wise, meh.  It's okay.  It's just okay.  Service?  Definitely spotty.  As spotty as the white jeans that they require their servers to wear.  Case in point: last time I had dinner there, a food runner dropped the food off at our table while the server followed right behind.  As the runner walked away the server smiled ear to ear and asked, ""How's everything?""  To which I answered, ""Uh...  Not sure, because we haven't tried anything yet."" I would really rather go elsewhere, really.  But it's so consistently convenient that I always return.  Well, at least when someone suggests it, I wouldn't mind.  With all the options within the 1 block radius, I'd recommend something else in a heartbeat."
Vickie Y.,"San Francisco, United States",25,81,,3.0,18/7/2008,Not really sure what the big deal is..  of course when I have friends visiting from out of town I often take them here cause it's a central location right by Union Square.  Food is decent but not worth the looooooong wait.. Try to get a seat on the outside terrace where the view overlooks union square....
tim y.,"San Francisco, United States",31,193,6,3.0,11/7/2008,"for what it is ... a las vegas emporium of comfort food, it delivers!  long lines and waits, tourist and people celebrating something ... rooftop is the best and somehow we lucked out on this san francisco mild evening ... shepards pie, plump buffalo wings, so so corncakes, but hey, we are not boulevard nor pretend to be more than we are ... so all parts being equal ... do it just once, and only if inivited and you can blow half the day or night hanging with a cocktail; service is servicable ... no more no less, this is the factory!"
Jacquelyne L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,37,,3.0,11/7/2008,"Chain restaurants are usually so blahsee, but The Cheesecake Factory is pretty darn reliable every time. I've been to a few of CF's across the country from Cali to Jersey and down south to off to no where in Florida. Granted in every CF the wait is ridiculous, it's hit or miss with the servers, and the host staff are usually some of the most pretentious people who think they have the power over when you eat. Oh yea... at the Cheesecake Factory where the average wait is about an hour - they do control when you can commence gorging. I love the Cobb Salad, it use to be the Symphony Salad with grilled asparagus and mushrooms which I miss, but the parmesan vinegarette is amazing! It really makes the salad one of the best I've had, even distribution of bacon and chicken in every bite, evenly tossed. Love it. CF offers a very diverse menu with a little bit of everything around the world. So you can't go wrong with an empty stomach looking for a hearty meal. I could name some favorites, but the salad ranks up there and the other entrees - to each their own. But be warned - the portions are HUGE. I never finish my salads, their lunch sizes are more digestible. Dinner portions will put you into food coma. Save room for Cheesecake, the varieties are awesome. Heavenly rich though, and good to share. I love the banana cream, fresh strawberry, kona coffee, heath bar and peanut butter - to name a few. Just tonight I had a pistachio chocolate swirl which is a seasonal special - OMG... taste just like pistachio ice cream in thick creamy cheesecake. Atmosphere is generic, SF host the Cheesecake Factory on the 8th Floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square. Pretty sweet view. Another cool one is at Menlo Park Mall in Edison, NJ - it's fairly big and has this huge starry dome. The one in Boca Raton, FL is like a little Tuscan villa."
Rosalee C.,"San Francisco, United States",186,259,499,3.0,9/7/2008,"the miso salmon with rice and yummy sauce is worth the wait... i don't know about 1 whole hour's worth, though. that's the sucky part- waiting. it's so freakin busy here, unless you come in on a weekday at whatever time this place opens."
emily p.,"Castro Valley, United States",13,80,1,3.0,8/7/2008,"go here if you & your friends cant decide what to eat, they got everything. you cant really go wrong But, if youre super hungry DONT eat here. the wait to get seated and to get your food is super long.  but the view from the patio is nice :)"
Jeremy S.,"Pittsburgh, United States",380,520,43,3.0,6/7/2008,"Hadn't been to cheesecake factory for like 10 years, but SO was wishy-washy about what she wanted to have and we were in the area.  Obviously best things about this place are the view and the people watching.  Food is okay regular chain restaurant burgers and sandwiches and greasy fries.  Service is efficient.  Very big mistake:  we decided to split a piece of cheesecake... ugh!  don't do it!  we both instantly regretted it.  not that it was bad, but because it was so rich!  it took a few hours for the cheesecake coma to wear off..."
Hai T.,"Oakley, United States",76,134,26,3.0,3/7/2008,"Overrated. Yeah, thats what I think. If you can get past the normal 1-2 hour wait, there is a chance you'll be seated outside which will only make things worse. Now if its a nice day, then thats fine. But usual Frisco weather is often cloudy and breezy, so even with the heaters outside, you'll often get a brush of cold wind that could ruin your dining experience. Aside from the seating, the food is pretty good. Their portions are pretty hearty and the food often flavorful. I consider it an upscale TGIFridays. As for the cheesecake, I gotta say that I am not really a fan. I've tried a couple different flavors, but none of it has really stood out. Actually, I have to say that as far as cheesecake goes, your best bet would be Tahoe Joes...now their cheesecake is to die for! I strongly suggest going on a weekday, when the wait time is reduced. Food is worth the price, but not the wait."
Christian P.,"Los Angeles, United States",186,387,9,3.0,1/7/2008,Came here Monday after a long pride weekend and the service was  fairly attentive.. did take a while to get drinks and refills.. food came out pretty fast though. yes the wait here can be VERY VERY Long at times.. plan ahead!!!
Chrestien H.,"Oakland, United States",201,9,,3.0,17/6/2008,"Ummm....Whats wrong with me? I can't believe, I let another one of my friends talk me into going to the Cheesecake Factory; I seriously have issues. I keep returning to this restaurant, hoping that one day they will have excellent food and great service---WOW who am I kidding....  Immediately when you get off the crowed elevator (which is loaded beyond capacity) you fight your way to the Restaurant's host to get one of those annoying pagers (I hate those BTW)----I  think restaurant pagers are synonymous with bad food and poor service. Anyways, upon getting your pager and waiting the standard 35-40 mins you are seated with a menu that looks more like an 8th grade yearbook (advertisements on every other page) and absolutely no sense of order. I am convinced that the reason why the menu's are so long is to keep customers busy, because the service is SLOW..... The Food: Not Bad, Not all that good either, I had the Chicken Ramano which was really bland...My buddy had the Double BBQ hamburger which actually looked really good!  The best thing about this restaurant is actually not the food, its the beautiful view of downtown San Francisco you get to experience while dining at the restaurant. This almost makes the bland food and the poor service worth it.  The Cheesecake is actually quite good! I would strongly recommend forgoing dinner and going straight for the Cheesecake...I had the strawberry cheesecake and my friend had the Oreo cheesecake. We both finished our cheesecakes in under 10 mins (we weren't competing, but I won!) So why 3 stars??? (-1) Star for slow service (-1) star for bland food and a confusing menu (+1) star for great Ambiance (+1) star for amazing cheesecake (+1) star for ample portions of food"
