rosemarie l.,"San Francisco, United States",20,55,,3.0,7/6/2008,"the service here sucks!! i decided to order a salad to go for lunch.   Criticisms: 1.  it took nearly 10 minutes for someone to take my order.  there were  two employees standing 3 feet from the register chatting away.  i know they saw me because i saw them glance over a couple of times. 2.  as i was placing my order..i felt attitude from the employee.  not even a hello, it was like ""what do wanna order?"" 3.  i know that cheesecake factory is busy..but wtf, i just ordered a salad and how come it takes nearly a half hour to get it.  do they pick the salad greens from their garden in the back of the restaurant.    when my salad did finally come (i was feeling hypoglycemic at this point).  they didn't even tell me that it came,  luckily i was watching the employee bring a to go bag  to the counter, praying to God it was mine. i've been to the cheesecake factory factory in honolulu, maybe some of the aloha spirits they have needs to rub off onto the employees in san francisco.  what kind of impression do the sf employees leave for the many tourists that frequent there? as for my salad itself, it tasted darn good.  maybe because i was starving. as the cheesecakes, they're out of this world!"
Radha X.,"Oakland, United States",9,151,4,3.0,4/6/2008,"Always satisfied with the food, portion, drinks and usually service. Bad thing is the wait. Since they don't take reservations, you have to wait 45min + around peek time especially if you are a party of 4 or more. Very loud so don't expect a romantic dinner for 2.  USUALLy, the waiters/waitresses are really cheery and good at service. HOWEVER, if you get a scrawny asian guy named Kai, ur in for a frustrating night. We got him as a replacement while our waitress went on break. He never came back. We asked like 3 other waiters to find him and when he finally showed up, he greeted with a ""Sup?"" By the time, we got our condiments etc our food was cold.....Got home and told my sis about the guy and she had the same experience with him before! The guy was informal, unresponsive and just disappeared..... But in all, I always like going here if I'm in downtown or have time to wait."
Athens r.,"Union City, United States",56,134,,3.0,3/6/2008,"Three star coz I still prefer the one in San Jose. I think the place down south has more pizzazz, scheme-wise its more attractive. Tables are just too close with each other leaving you no privacy for the most part of the dining. Could almost hear what the topic on the next table is and boy that is so distracting if you wanted a good dine. Our server seemed disturbed since she forgot to give our bread. She was also slow with the refills.  I had my Fave Bistro shrimp pasta, and a regular coke. Add a passion fruit mojito by the end of your long wait and that should do the compensating for the line. If there was a category merely for the food evaluation, that would be a five, but since I love details and kind of get the feel of every place I go to if its something new--that would count a lot. So yeah, just a three."
Jessica F.,"San Francisco, United States",4,32,,3.0,29/5/2008,"Was here on Memorial day with my husband and sister-in-law.  The wait was about 25 minutes or so, but they accurately quoted a wait time, which is nice.  The view is fantastic - such a great view of union square - it was perfect for my sister-on-law.  She commented on how great the turkey burger was (and trust me, that means A LOT), and I thought the miso salmon was great.  I wasn't really expecting the food to be that good, but I was definately pleasantly surprised.  The pigeons were okay, but please, do NOT feed them!  I wouldn't want any more than there were already there..."
Lisa W.,"San Francisco, United States",38,139,17,3.0,24/5/2008,"One of my favorite things to do is play ""tourist"" in my own city and The Cheesecake Factory really makes this happen.  Let's say that I've just walked my butt all up and down Union Square, in that ginormous mega-mall, and through both sides of Macy's and all I want to do is sit down and have something to eat.  So I do, right? No!  I go to the very tip-top of Macy's, put my name in, and wait for an hour and a half before I get to sit down and have an over-priced, mediocre meal!  Right on! It's weird, but I really like to do this once or twice a year... go figure.  For what it's worth, it IS a rather nice view if you get to sit outside and I've always had nice servers and hosts (which is totally bizarre considering how freakin' busy the place is!)"
Abe F.,"San Francisco, United States",126,19,4,3.0,23/5/2008,"Great Decor, location and setting Horrible ""Wait"" experience, not only here but at other location Good Portions and always hot when served.   Has anyone ever noticed how much expense was done for interior decorating and lighting but the salt & pepper shakers along with the sugar  pack holders look like they stole it from Denny's?"
Harry L.,"San Leandro, United States",15,35,,3.0,16/5/2008,"If San Francisco had constant sunlight this place will win 5 stars based on location alone. Too bad it's a muggy city covered in fog all the time. Food here isn't to brag about. I'd say nothing special or out of the ordinary. You can pretty much find everything on the menu anywhere and everywhere. But this one in particular is location, location, location. It sits on top of the Women's Macys Building. Overlooking Union Square, the scene is delightful. The wait on the other hand will murder ya. So don't go hungry."
Shannon W.,"San Rafael, United States",3,227,,3.0,14/5/2008,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco tons of times.  It nice to go there for a nice lunch if you want a break from shopping.  This place has EVERYTHING- their menu is huge!  The service is okay ( how can it be great- it is always SO crowded!)  It doesn't take too long to get a table, but then again I've been there only on weekdays.  But if you want a spectacular view, go- you can see all of Union Square!"
Florence C.,Hong Kong,10,44,3,3.0,7/5/2008,"typical American style food, large portion. but the cheesecakes there are wonderful, lots of choices and taste great. it's a great place for family instead of two people, unless you're big eater or someone who craves for cheesecake so bad.  i don't like the long wait. every time i go there, i have to wait almost an hour to be seated."
David S.,"Berkeley, United States",3,187,6,3.0,4/5/2008,"Bitchy hostess deliberately said my GF's name wrong. We threw a piece of chewed up bubble gum at her. She was too stupid/full of herself to notice. Food is good, location good."
Spencer N.,"Los Angeles, United States",114,200,5,3.0,1/5/2008,"This place isnt BAD, but it is totally not worth the hype. I dont find it fun waiting for up to 2hrs for a table at a chain restaurant. Not my style. On a special occasion, sure whatever. But not every day. The menu has a ton of options that span almost every ethnic region. Its a little over the top and frankly, not all that needed. Ive had hit or miss dining experiences here. The food is good...but nothing too special. The cheesecake is too sweet. Plus i have an issue paying that much for frozen cheesecake. pleasssse people. Ill come here if i have to , but its not my first choice"
Lola d.,"San Leandro, United States",2,22,,3.0,21/4/2008,"great pastas, EXCELLENT dessert obviously but always busy annoying yuppies, and rude servers make u no wanna come back"
Alyssa W.,"Alameda, United States",48,211,,3.0,21/4/2008,"The cheesecake factory is one of my guilty pleasures.  Shh, don't tell anyone.  It's probably the best chain restaurant I can think of!  The food is good (nothing amazing), i don't even love cheesecake, the waits are too long, and the service is usually average.  But for some reason I end up eating here 2 - 3 times a year!  Probably because my mom and I love their iced tea so much so we stop by whenever she comes to visit..."
Victoria G.,"San Francisco, United States",33,111,,3.0,6/4/2008,"I grew up in the suburbs so I love chain restaurants.  Sue me.  They're the only places that can get away with all of that fusion bs, magically turning some sort of salad or pasta dish into something azn.  The wait is generally an hour long because you have to give the morbidly obese out-of-towners ample time to finish up their meatloaf and double chocolate cheesecake chunks, but once you're seated (especially on the outside patio overlooking Union Square), let the comfort food feeding commence.  The wine selection ain't too bad for a place of this caliber, so get a glass of the Wild Horse pinot noir while you're waiting for your table and savor the fact that you live in SF and the other fools in the restaurant don't."
Elaine H.,"San Francisco, United States",241,979,112,3.0,5/4/2008,"I actually rate this place a 3.5, but rounded it up to 4 because they do have good cheesecake =) But the food is just ""alright"". I thought it was pretty good the first time I ate there, and did go back a few times afterwards because I was shopping in the area. However, its nothing to ""crave"" for, just a bunch of Italian food, some Asian food (americanized), some pizza, burgers, etc. The entree with shrimp and steak is pretty good though, and a couple of the spicy pastas. A must try is the AVOCADO ROLL - very good. But for the usual LONG wait that they have, I wouldn't go there unless I was shopping at Union Square (you can go a good distance with the little machine they give you that lights up when its your turn). P.S. they don't exactly take reservations, but if you have a big group, let them know ahead of time. They can somehow arrange things so you guys can get a long table (but someone would still have to go and line up around the time)."
Tracy N.,"San Francisco, United States",13,25,,3.0,3/4/2008,"Why every time I try to go and enjoy a meal in the best location in San Francisco with the terrace on Union Square, I have to wait 40-50 minutes? They should give priority to locals!! If I have one hour lunch break I want to be able to enjoy the city I live in, I don't have all that time to wait in line... Their salad are amazing though!!"
Dee J.,"San Lorenzo, United States",18,134,,3.0,1/4/2008,"As I waited NEARLY 90 MINUTES to be seated, I looked down over the railing and calculated the odds that if I jumped at that precise moment, how many people I'd hit on the sidewalk below.  The food is okay....the portions are huge, so if you order something that tastes bad, you are stuck with a shit-load of foul food.  Or the homeless dudes out front are stuck with a shit-load of foul food.  The drinks are stupid weak....not even strong enough to give someone a weak wiener."
Wilson C.,"Fremont, United States",170,177,,3.0,27/3/2008,"The cheesecake here is the best you'll ever have.  I mean it better if it's called Cheesecake Factory!   The food is generally pretty good I think, although overpriced.  You pay for the ambience here.  It's located on like the 6th floor or something of Macy's and has a balcony that overlooks Union Square which is nice.   Onto the bad.  The wait.  The wait is horrendous.  You basically go in and put your name on a list.  An hour later you'll get called and you think now that wasn't so bad.  Wrong!  They only call you to give you a pager!  Now onto waiting part 2; it's part 2 because there's a part 3!  After another hour waiting with a pager you'll get paged thinking your table's ready and they can somehow read your mind and have your food waiting for you already.  But much to your dismay, when you turn in your pager you go to your third and final waiting process to wait for your table to be prepared for you.  A good 2 1/2 hours later, you'll get seated. One time we went, our waitress was pouring water and spilled it onto our table and did not even apologize.  Generally the service is good though but that's a big knock for not apologizing and even got some water on me.   Come to think of it, I might be giving them too many stars.  I'll keep at it three just because their Cheesecake is that good."
Dylan T.,"San Francisco, United States",222,88,8,3.0,27/3/2008,"In union square, you'd expect great restaurants around the place. Most of the restaurants are great, but cheesecake factory falls short of this repettoire.  Service: eh, the service kinda blows at the cheesecake factory in union square compared to the others around Cali. The waiters are always forgetting to check on their tables it seems(majority of the time i've gone), and mess up on orders a good amount ( seen it happen alot whle i'm there, although never has happened to me). Random waiters though come around to refill water, but thats one of the few good qualities they have. Even though the waiters are friendly and compensate for their mistakes, it doesn't make up for the loss time. Food: Their food tastes pretty good. They have a wide variety of tasty appetizers, entrees, and dessert. The calamari there tastes pretty good, as well as the bread. The pasta and pizza there also taste good, but in my opinion, they made a huge mistake ( which made me think less of them) by getting rid of the pesto pasta there, b/c it was so delicious and the best pasta dish there. To be honest though, the food there is overpriced a tad bit, but it seems to not stop people from going.  However, i'd still recommend Cheesecake factory after all their faults. Their food still tastes delicious, although overpriced, and the service is bearable, although not as good as some other Cheesecake factories."
Catherine O.,"San Francisco, United States",579,364,2,3.0,27/3/2008,"You know when you can't decide or know where to get coffee, so you default to starbucks because of convenience? Cheesecake factory is the same concept for me.  Sometimes when I wandering Union Square and I just don't know where to go, I some how end up taking the elevator in Macy's to the Cheesecake level. I find myself stepping out of the elevator into pure chaos. A hellish hour for a wait for two?! GAH! Everyone and their mother eats here, I admit the cheesecake is pretty good (otherwise they wouldn't call it Cheesecake Factory)....although where's the factory..hmm aka kitchen? Anyways, the food is average, I wouldn't say spectacular, not cheap, not expensive! The good thing is they have a variety of foods from pizza, salads, pasta, burgers, to some asian dishes (that I probably wouldn't order).  They have seating inside, outside in the patio next to the pigeons that poop & gawk at your food, and at the bar. The outside patio overlooks the square & they even have heated lamps. So take a seat outside to share your dinner with a pigeon..oops I mean date. The service is not bad as well, nothing to rave or complain about.  Overall, average. Really though, WHY is the wait always long. Why? It's just food people...just food."
