Olive Q.,"Daly City, United States",34,20,29,3.0,26/3/2008,"The service here is slow, and there's a pigeon problem when you eat outside.   Everything on the menu taste a little better than average.  The Habachi steak is my favorite.  The cocktails are pretty good that's if your waiter ever return with your drinks.  I've been here a few times, and it's usually the same situation everytime.  Also, Cheesecake factory is great example why you DONT order Asian food at an American restaurant.  Dont order the spring rolls or sushi. Does anyone know why their floors are ALWAYS so greasy?"
Stacey L.,"San Francisco, United States",35,192,20,3.0,21/3/2008,"The wait is just way......tooo.....looooong!  On weekends you can be waiting 1-1.5 hours for a table.  I used to come here often in high school.  I guess I didn't mind fighting the crowds and waiting then.  I don't have the patience now so I've been here a few times since HS.  The last time I came here was after a movie, around 9:45pm.  I didn't think I'd have to wait long for a table.  Boy was I wrong!  It was packed!  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table!  I don't like the fact that they don't take reservations. The portions are huge!  They have some good pasta dishes.  Their cheesecake is yummy.  I love the wide selection of flavors. Nice view.  Average service - sometimes they get busy and you have to wait awhile.  Indoor and outdoor seating. If not for the long long loooooooong wait, this place would probably get 4 stars."
Sarah F.,"San Francisco, United States",194,497,,3.0,18/3/2008,"You must have patience to come here... the wait can be nuts.  Also, you must be REALLY hungry to come here, as the portions can feed a small village.   I do love the drinks here, especially the Bellini, which is ice blended.  However, I can never taste the alcohol, but maybe that's the point. I enjoy the turkey burger here, very much.   Last time I came here, I got food poisoning, which was *not* fun.  I think it was the spinach cheese dip.  It was delicious, but um, deadly.  The fish'n'chips are yum, however, the fries were a bit overdone. Everyone and their mother comes here, so I find it's nice to get the food to go, and eat in Union Square."
Erika A.,"Millbrae, United States",0,21,,3.0,19/2/2008,"el novio brougtt me over here thinking it would be romantic to eat a top the macys building and look at union square. unfortunately the food was not that great and it was kind of expensive for me. the portions are huge, to the point where its too excessive and you kinda loose your appetite. I'm giving three stars because our waiter was really attentive."
Danielle S.,"Toronto, Canada",0,117,6,3.0,17/2/2008,It's always a fun time at the Cheesecake Factory though I'm never really sure why. I love their warm appetizer bread but the rest of the food is so-so. Service is barely alright also and I don't eat cheesecake but I'm sure we'll be there again soon. :)
Michael H.,"Sacramento, United States",3,57,,3.0,17/2/2008,Place is okay...the little deck is nice to eat on those few sunny warm summer days in the city. And the only thing worth mentioning here is the cheesecake...I love there huge selection and I still haven't had every cake on there menu but that is all they are good for....
Erik W.,"San Lorenzo, United States",12,32,,3.0,14/2/2008,"When I'm hungover, I walk over here for the take out. The Tons of Fun burger has Tons of Grease so I recover quite well. Good to eat nearby if your in the city frequently like me because of the large menu and choices to fix your cravings. Your not going to get the best dining experience at a Cheesecake Factory, but food works for me. Too crowded at this one."
Ed U.,"San Francisco, United States",4220,3903,30016,3.0,12/2/2008,"Now I'm sure if I was still an acne-laden adolescent in my powder blue tuxedo on my way to the senior ball with the bespectacled secretary of the chess club, the Cheesecake Factory would be my first choice for impressing her once I pinned the $2.75 plastic corsage on her handmade polyester dress. I swear this place still gives off that geek vibe to me even though I doubt I could have afforded this place in high school. The suburban and global masses that converge upon this place is still staggering, so make sure you allot at least two hours for the time it takes to wait and get through a meal here. And that's only if you're not picky where you sit since they offer outdoor seating. Oh and you get that corporate red-light buzzer complete with an unnecessary advertisement attached to it. How better to impress your prom date than to hold one of these buzzers. Jamie W. and I were lucky (if you can call it that) to wait only about half an hour on Sunday afternoon for a table. I had not been here in such a long, long time, and I finally remembered why it is still such a zoo...a humongous menu and portion out-of-control. I must have been in a high school cafeteria mood since I ordered the $15.95 Famous Factory Meatloaf, which consists of two big chunks of slightly burnt ground beef topped with grilled onions with a major pile of heavily creamed mashed potatoes on one side and a succotash side on the other (see the photo). Jamie went for the $12.95 Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad which came shaped like Twin Peaks as if to signal to us...""Wha' ya' kidding me? You ordered two entrees?"" Lots of fresh ingredients on the plate but kinda saucy with the vinaigrette dressing (see the photo). Overall, the quality of the food is pretty good for a chain. Just go to an Olive Garden to make sure I'm right. We didn't leave room for cheesecake since we devoured the hot rolls quickly once we sat down. I actually don't regret the decision since the refined sugar would have made me too wired for a night at the theater. But will I come back to the madhouse wait? Hmmm, probably not soon....but hey, they're not stingy on free refills. FOOD - 3 stars...it ain't heavy, it's the Cheesecake Factory...suburban upscale for the Costco crowd in the heart of the city AMBIANCE - 3 stars...kinda Baroque tacky if you actually look hard enough, but there are so many people milling about, you probably won't notice SERVICE - 3.5 stars...courteous in a corporate trained way..too big a pitch given on the cheesecake if you ask me TOTAL - 3 stars...if you have a burning desire to see where tourists graze, by all means, come here"
Manuel M.,"San Francisco, United States",49,33,1,3.0,12/2/2008,"Pretty Average.  The only thing that makes this Cheesecake stand out is that you get a view with the meal, but that is only if you wait long enough to sit on the deck.  It's still a Cheesecake, you can get this service in suburbs all across America. It's a large American meal with lots of food for a semi-decent price. I only like taking people here as a joke and if I want them to feel comfortable and not too shocked by coming from a small town to a big city.  The wait is unbelievable. I tried to go there on a Saturday night and they told me it would be about an hour wait for dinner! I am not about to wait an hour for something I can make at home for half the price.  If you are looking for a nice meal in the area then walk a few more blocks and find a restaurant that isn't geared towards tourist.  If you are looking for a view, then just to in the Saint Francis elevators. You can get a whole view of the bay for free."
Kimberly B.,"San Jose, United States",104,428,25,3.0,7/2/2008,"I don't understand why this place is always so crowded, no matter what time you go in. We always have to wait the longest time to eat here, even if it's a party of two. I've had some good dishes here, like the miso salmon and their different variety of salads, but it seems like the prices are also steadily increasing for all their meals.  I would have to say that their cheesecake here is worth trying though, especially if you're a big chocolate fan because they incorporate a lot of different chocolate bars into their cheesecakes. I find it humorous that they have Splenda cheesecake and things like that. I mean come on, it's cheesecake. It's 450% of your daily intake of saturated fat. ;)"
Cristoper C.,"San Francisco, United States",4,27,,3.0,6/2/2008,Strawberry lemonade... I loved this. The right amount of sour with the right amount of sweetness; now this is a thirst quencher. Next comes the food.. lets see: Excellent? Nah. Good? Well... lets see.. there are good ones; and now you know why I gave it 3 stars. A few good meals and a great lemonade just isn't enough to push you to 4 stars. I wish I could give half a star; that strawberry lemonade was just delicious. I finished that first glass just seconds after it was given to us.
Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, United States",46,359,22,3.0,2/2/2008,"The positives--so many items to choose from, so if you didn't like what you had the last time you went, try something else. Also, when I went there, I had unlimited refills on my strawberry lemonade. Yum! Cheesecake isn't too bad either... The negatives--when I was there, it was a 20-40 min wait. And this was during lunchtime! You also have to take the right elevator or escalator to get here, and I got lost the first time I came. Obviously this is a tourist trap, so go to another cheesecake factory in the Bay Area if you have the means to drive."
Jelly G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,67,,3.0,26/1/2008,"It is just fun to dine there. Big potion of food, and hundreds of cheesecakes! They should be able to take a reservation, tho. The longest I have waited there was four hours."
Fannie S.,"San Francisco, United States",27,1813,108,3.0,18/1/2008,"Food = good, and sometimes great.   Dessert (esp. cheesecake) = below average. I only go here for dinners...hearty portions.  Good energy.  Nice view of the city, if you're outside or near the windows. Service is usually good.   Decent drinks.  Parking is a pain, and since it is in the Macy's...it can get really packed too."
Jen Y.,"Oakland, United States",146,474,54,3.0,13/1/2008,"I've been to this restaurant several times and have always ALWAYS had to wait for a table no matter what time of day it was. In the heart of Union Square it's pretty much inevitable it's going to be packed, especially on the weekends.  The waitstaff have always been very nice and knowledgable about the menu which is impressive because it's about a million pages long, almost like a diary in size. The food isn't bad, but it's not fantastic. Not bad enough to complain about it, and not good enough to rave. The Cheesecake Factory serves it's purpose at the time being and you leave stuffed because the portions are pretty generous. Of course you can't leave without getting desert. The hussle and bustle of the restaurant is kind of a turn-off as you are bombard with the crowd of people waiting for tables upstairs as you exit the elevator. They give you electronic buzzers to let you know when your table is ready. Although your table isn't exactly ready. You hand them the buzzer and they tell you to wait to the side (which can take up to 10 mins) and you have to listen out for a person to yell out your name amongst the hectic crowd while saying ""excuse me, excuse me,"" to people in your way as you try to get to him.  This place is worth a try, definitely. But it's usually not the type of  restaurant you'd go back to often."
Tiger Lily ..,"San Francisco, United States",30,340,3,3.0,3/1/2008,portions are great. service is great as well. some faves: pasta da vinci calamari rasberry white truffle cheescake this place is a well oiled machine...they pump it out like nobody's business.
Mark W.,"San Francisco, United States",131,518,8,3.0,2/1/2008,"This place seems like it is always bustling.  Maybe the American version of a Chinese ""Teahouse""?  This last time we went, we got the pager liked we normally would but they said that we could not go around with it to anywhere inside Macy's.  They said that we would have to wait in the Cheesecake Factory Waiting area.  I thought that was kinda weird because in the past, we were at least able to walk down the escalators where the furniture was but this time they said that it would not work down there.   In any case, that kinda sucks cause the wait was about 1.25 hours.  But we ended up just asking them how long the wait was going to be and we just decided to take a walk in Union Square for an hour or so and head back upstairs and as soon as we did, the elevator door opened up and the pager buzzed!  Perfect Timing!   So the thing you need to know about this place is the long wait, the large portions, the fair price for large portions and the decent food.  I guess it's still a chain restaurant but it's not too bad.  I guess every couple of years, it's a cool spot to go during the Holiday Season when we are down here.   Or....... Maybe it's better to come here when it's NOT the Holiday Season??  I'm thinking it's not as crowded...  Then again, I could be wrong...."
Lester A.,"El Dorado Hills, United States",114,345,4,3.0,2/1/2008,"I've always liked Cheesecake factory, but the one here I'd rather avoid.  This place is always busy and the service is usually suspect.  Like they just want to hurry and get you out of there as fast as possible.  The wait is forever and there's no where to wait.  They have the smallest bar in SF and the lobby is full of people waiting to use the elevator.  I saw a couple eating main courses at the bar, straight guys ordering pink drinks in martini glasses, people sharing bar stools.  Horrible.  But the food at Cheesecake Factory is really good for the most part and the cheesecakes are some of the best around.  Eat at anyone but this one.  Unless you want a nice view from outside but be prepared to wait."
Sheeva G.,"San Francisco, United States",4,25,,3.0,30/12/2007,"Overrated and underwhelming.  My boyfriend took me to Cheesecake Factory because I had never had cheesecake before.  It was crowded, loud, and we had to mill into the elevator like cattle in order to get to the restaurant.  I much prefer a small, quiet bakery."
Colleen M.,"San Francisco, United States",653,518,359,3.0,27/12/2007,"Their food is decent, and it's always crowded and extremely loud. The one thing I love about this place is their outdoor seating during Christmas time. You can see the Union Square Christmas tree lit up like a fairy from below, and it's just beautiful. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is heavenly, and so is the strawberry cheesecake. Yummy. Don't go with too big a group though - the wait for a table is FOREVER."
