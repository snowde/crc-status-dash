? ?.,"San Francisco, United States",44,522,195,3.0,26/12/2007,"This place is always crowded and the quoted wait time is that plus another 30 minutes to an hour. Make sure when your pager goes off, you're in their face within 2 minutes or they give your reservation away. Staff is usually nice and helpful. Every time I go here, they wind up messing up my order. I never ask for any thing extra to be put in or taken out. I order it just the way it is on the menu. I get a completely different menu item, it's a HOT item but it arrives COLD, they put in extra stuff that's not supposed to be in there, etc.  It seems to be just MY luck. I once asked them to take it back to nuke it. They're very nice and offered to make me a new one. I declined knowing that they'd somehow mess up this new order. I insist they just warm it up. But they make me a new one totally disregarding my request. The new one they bring out is by far much smaller than the first one. You see why I insisted on them just nuking up the first one?  If only they would just listen to their customers. They have the same thing on their menu and they never have anything new. Their cheesecakes are to die for. Pricey but so yummy! It's gonna take a lot for me to eat here again."
Daneca V.,"Daly City, United States",35,55,,3.0,20/12/2007,"Just got back from my Christmas dinner with a small group of friends, and first off, yes they have a notorious wait. You want a table for 4 at 8 in the evening? You better not be in a rush and you better have money left over to pay for parking at the end of the day. Food wise, their huge portions are always tasty, the service is really attentive -even on a busy Wednesday night, a week from Christmas- and they've got a page and half for just cheesecake alone. I strongly recommend the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Fried Mac and Cheese. Mmm. Ooh and for the long waits, the home furnishings floor is just an escalator ride down so lounge on some of the couches while you wait, I promise the sales people leave you alone if you just leave your pager out."
Kathy T.,"San Francisco, United States",22,95,5,3.0,16/12/2007,"Even though it's a chain restaurant and it's always crowded, the food is good and the view is spectacular.  I took my brother-in-law to dinner here for his birthday and our server was excellent. She went above and beyond to make our stay great.  Granted not all services where good, since the waiter for the other tables, was never there and the patrons had to get up to find him to pay for their bills. The portions of the food and drinks are huge and you can't beat the desserts. The only thing I've got a beef with is the wait. Other than that, everything is wonderful and I would suggest to eat out on the patio especially during Christmas time. One star for the service. One star for the huge food portions. One star for the view."
Jen Y.,"Rocklin, United States",11,41,,3.0,2/12/2007,"This place is worth it just for the view.  After a few glasses of wine, (due to the extraordinary wait times) the avocado egg rolls were amazing.  And also eaten in 5 seconds.  We almost ordered another one, until we realized how expensive the food is.  Good for every once in a while, every one seems to come here for their birthdays.  (Only good if you get a hot waiter to sing to you.)  Will come here next time just for appetizers and a few drinks....and the view."
D L.,"San Francisco, United States",7,217,,3.0,1/12/2007,"This place is just okay, nothing particularly exciting. Basic fare with a wide variety of choices, but the concern is, how good could all those dishes be since there are so many of them? The cooks behind the scenes couldn't be experts at making all those dishes. I tend to order the same thing each time I go which isn't very frequently. I like the pasta dish with chipotle sauce, chicken & peas. The portions are pretty big so I usually eat half & save the rest for lunch the next day. I tried a kahlua coffee cheesecake & gagged after the first bite, so I told our waitress that I didn't like it & it wasn't what I expected, and asked her to take it off my tab. She did so without any hesitation or fuss. Be prepared for a wait because I don't know of a time there hasn't been one, especially with all the holiday shoppers this time of year.  During the warmer months or occasional heat spell it's fun to eat outdoors on the deck where they also have space heaters."
Allen B.,"San Francisco, United States",8,25,,3.0,20/11/2007,"So Two Stars for Speed of Service...Three Stars for Meal so I spect this is a good average, huh? It never fails that I will waddle out of here full of Thai Noodles and cocktails. And those long islands...there has to be a separate rating system for those :)"
Kerry D.,"New Orleans, United States",348,323,23,3.0,9/11/2007,"I don't understand why anyone would come to a culinary capital like SF and go to eat at chain restaurant you could find in any monster mall in Texas (because that's where people go to eat in Texas...any chain restaurant off the nearest freeway exit) with portion sizes to match.  But you know what, I'm not going to hate on Cheesecake Factory as much as the rest of you.  Despite having a menu the length of War and Peace, blinking pagers and probably the bitchiest hostess staff known to man, it ain't that bad.   My few trips to Cheesecake have really only been around the holidays.  I'm a sucker for Union Square around Christmas time.  The lights, the crowd, the bite in the air and the hustle and bustle of mass consumerism just makes me tingly from head to toe.  I really like the Miso Salmon, but would recommend skipping the Thai peanut noodles (think spaghetti  covered in peanut butter....blegh).   My beef with Cheesecake is that I'm convinced the waitstaff stole my hat.  I literally had just got in the elevator when I realized I left my hat at the table.  I raced back up and went back the table and it was no where to be found.  I spent about 15 minutes of my life asking different people if they had seen it, but no luck.  I wouldn't be so suspicious if 3 employees hadn't complimented me on it earlier.   Shady Mofos."
Wilhelm Y.,"San Francisco, United States",706,1004,3592,3.0,9/11/2007,"Our party of eight was seated shortly after everybody had arrived.  Since we were all coming from different locations and meeting up at the restaurant the wait for our table really wasn't too bad.  I can not ever recall when this restaurant was not busy; the reception/waiting area was packed as usual. A server took us to our corner table, loaded us up with fresh bread and ice water then told us that the regular waiter was on break, and we would see him shortly.  The warm, soft breads were very good and another server returned to refill our water glasses at least twice while we waited for our waiter.  Our waiter finally appeared.  He apologized for the wait and spoke quickly in announcing the evening's special and the soup.  So quickly in fact that only half of our party caught what he had actually said ... ""a fresh salmon"" something, something ""served with French fries and broccoli and our soup is broccoli cheese"".  With that he told us he would let us look at the menu and return shortly to take our drink orders, and he disappeared again.  We had already waited so long that many of us had already memorized the catalog-sized menu. Meanwhile the young lady with the pitcher of ice water returned yet again to refill our glasses.  This routine was getting to be pretty comical.  Finally our waiter returned, cheerful as ever and asked if we were ready to order our drinks.  Several members of our party suggested he take the entree orders also, and our waiter seemed quite surprised that we were ready to do both tasks simultaneously.  He took our orders, quite carefully in fact, jotting down each little detail as a couple of members from our party were meticulous about what they wanted in their drink and/or on their entree.   The wait for our drinks took forever, and our waiter returned with a pitcher of ice water to refill our glasses.  He apologized for the wait and even brought us two more baskets of the fresh baked bread.  A short time later our drinks finally arrived, and we finally got a chance to make a toast to a successful Icer Air event and all of the different accomplishments related to that event.   Only one member of our party ordered salad to go with his dinner, and it arrived shortly after the drinks arrived.  The rest of us sat back and noticed the gargantuan portion of salad on his plate which he devoured quickly.  No sooner had he set down his fork when an army of four or five different servers brought out our entrees.  Every plate looked massive in proportion and delicious in presentation. I ordered the Chicken Madeira which is two pieces of chicken breast topped with soft and gooey mozzarella cheese and covered in a slightly sweetened brown sauce with big chunks of mushrooms and whole spears of fresh asparagus.  I believe it is a single chicken breast cut into two halves.  The chicken was quite moist and the sauce was flavorful.  This came with a gigantic scoop of red-skinned mashed potatoes that was so incredibly large I had trouble finishing it. As our waiter returned to remove each half-eaten plate from our table we contemplated whether or not to order dessert.  Six of our party did so ordering a variety of cheesecake slices from the plain Original to the Fresh Strawberry, the Key Lime, the White Chocolate Caramel Latte and the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple.  Although each slice was passed around the table I didn't sample any of the other selections, but my strawberry cheesecake was rich and delicious, an original slice of cheesecake with several fresh strawberries and sweet glaze.  Two dollops of plain whipped cream accompanied each cheesecake slice.  The only thing missing was a cup of hot tea or hot coffee.  Neither was offered. The overall service is spotty and not consistent at all times, and the restaurant is continuously busy, but the tasty food is served hot often on heated plates and the desserts are rich and decadent.  You probably won't find me eating here too often, but I think our overall experience deserves at least 3.5 stars."
Anita J.,"San Francisco, United States",163,137,119,3.0,31/10/2007,Service was okay. STEAK DIANE - medium rare is magnificent DULCE DE LECHE CARAMEL CHEESECAKE  wasn't all that i thought it would be. :/ Dinner view from the balcony... priceless
Lynn O.,"San Francisco, United States",11,127,34,3.0,13/10/2007,"I've been here several times before, most recently the other night to host some visitors from out of town (yes, it's prime for tourists in Union Square).  For the five of us, the total came to $109.15-- five!  Not including tip, and only including two drinks (lemonade with a cup full of ice: $3.95 each).  The kids were happy with their orders-- bang-bang chicken and something or other, and chicken costolleta (essentially, high end KFC style fare).  One parent looked disappointed by the miso salmon (salmon on top of rice with a few token snow peas as garnish-- the menu description leads you to believe the veggies play a bigger part in the meal), the other was happy with her Jamaican shrimp (lots of sauce in that one).  My eggplant sandwich looked pretty, but the taste didn't command $9.95.   There are not many vegetarian options aside from basic pasta (but who'd want to pay $10 upward for a plate of angel hair topped with tomato sauce you could make at home?), one veggie burger, and one eggplant sandwich.  Good luck dining here if you're vegan.  A whole lot of chicken dishes, though, and lots of salads and pastas with chicken, too.  The seafood variety was limited to salmon, shrimp, and tuna.  The nice thing about TCF is that at least it's okay to substitute, for example, fries for broccoli (take a look under ""side orders"" and choose your substitute) with no extra charge. As other reviewers mentioned, the service is pitifully slow, fairly inattentive, and table turn over is the servers' priority.  One of the hostesses was just lazily sitting behind the front podium as a small queue formed to get a table, letting the host do all the name taking.  (Regardless of whether or not it was her break time, that's just poor business practice.)  I noticed our server would suggest the more expensive dishes on the menu as well, so I suppose that's not all that uncommon of restaurant staff for squeaking in larger tips.  Definitely try to arrive as early as possible if you come here-- the wait gets longer and longer as the hours elapse (and TCF doesn't accept reservations)."
Teresa W.,"Millbrae, United States",85,77,8,3.0,23/9/2007,"interior sucks. gives me a headache, but good food. and HELLA good dessert. wait not so bad if you go around downtown to chill hahaha so many weirdos and tourist, which is cool i guess mmmm im hungry now bloggin about this at 1 AM i think im going to go eat my left over salad from there LOL"
brian w.,"San Francisco, United States",146,140,1,3.0,20/9/2007,"to me, the cheesecake factory is like american idol.  i don't understand why americans love it so much. every time i come here, it's packed to the gills with tourists.  and not tourists from eastern europe or tibet, these are people with southern twangs and midwestern mom jeans with big white sneakers from wal-mart. do you frigging idiots not have cheesecake factory where you're from?  you flew all the way out to san francisco, home of la folie and gary danko and french laundry and dosa's and r&g lounge and you choose to eat at a chain restaurant?  wtf is wrong with you people? you're the same people that elected bush, aren't you? *sigh* anyways, back on topic - the food here isn't actually all that bad - it's consistent, the service is solid, and you get what you expect.  and considering the cost, if you split a $13 dinner 2 ways, that's a $6.50 sit down dinner, unheard of in the yay area. here's a tip for getting a table quickly: go to one of the big union square hotels, ask the concierge to book you a table.  you'll get bumped up in the monster cheesecake factory line."
Adrienne G.,"San Francisco, United States",124,2310,2218,3.0,19/9/2007,"This place is ALWAYS crowded & it's like this all over the freaking country!  I have never walked past a Cheesecake Factory when there haven't been swarms upon swarms of people, waiting to be seated.....the business minds behind this establishment are absolute geniuses & definitely bizillionaries.  Why didn't I think of it first?! With only mediocre food to boast, the 2 reasons to come here are the AVOCADO EGG ROLLS & CHEESECAKE And if you're NOT a tourist, my suggestion is....get it To-Go or you'll have road rage from all the foot traffic.  WHO in their right mind would bumble around 100s of people, waiting well over an hour to eat here.....they'd have to be CRAZY! (Tourists should definitely experience this part of the madness that is Union Square.) Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Cookie-Dough Cheesecake is DA BOMB & the main reason I continue to experience the madness again & again.....and will continue to do so!  White-Chocolate-Macadamia-Nut is another fav.  Their Pumpkin Cheesecake is seasonal & worth a venture into the chaos..... .....but again, only long enough to grab the To-Go container....I'm not crazy enough to actually wait around to eat here!"
Lily T.,"San Francisco, United States",128,206,11,3.0,12/9/2007,"waiting is a bitch for dinner when u are hungry.. the food there are alright, the dessert is the yummy. is it worth waiting for one hour or more... eating lunch there is shorter wait time.."
Gregor G.,"San Francisco, United States",400,560,108,3.0,10/9/2007,"Is it odd going from Macy's furniture displays to noisy restaurant in one short escalator ride? Kinda. Does this chain rest on its laurels rather than blow you away with amazing food? Yep. BUT, just grab lunch on the outdoor roof patio on a clear, beautiful San Francisco day and not even the 'flying rats' that swoop by in hopes you'll drop a crust of bread will get on your nerves. We need more outdoor places to park it for food and drink, and like it or not, this is a decent one, kids."
Emily X.,"San Francisco, United States",85,116,4,3.0,1/9/2007,"I agree that the wait can be kinda ridiculous and the service will ultimately suck, but i'll admit it, i kinda love the cheesecake factory.  i don't go to ccf for ambiance or good service.  I almost always get the avocado egg rolls (tons of avocado and sun dried tomato in a won ton wrapper), or the popcorn shrimp (i am so not a popcorn shrimp person, mainly because I hate those maggoty looking bay shrimp  most places use, but ccf uses real shrimp, not maggots) or the artichoke (sooooo good, yummy garlicky lemony dipping sauce).  For the entree we usually share the BBQ ranch chicken salad with extra onion strings (black beans, corn, chicken, pico de gallo, avocado, and ranch and topped with yummy yummy o-stings and a drizzle of BBQ) or the the tostada chicken salad (similar to BBQ ranch chicken salad but no o-strings, the salad sits on two crunchy tostadas).  I used to get this one dish called chicken brochettes that was sooooo good.  They make good cocktails here, albeit a little too sweet and kinda pricey.  I almost never save room for cheesecake, and a few hours after I leave here I;m cursing myself for not getting it to go.  Even if you're stuffed, get the damn cheesecake to go, you'll thank me later."
Yosie G.,"San Francisco, United States",52,267,,3.0,2/8/2007,"I'm not sure why I did this, or why my Cheesecake Factory craving was so at an ultimate high, but I once waited 3 very long hours to eat here. Yup, wait began at 8, got seated at 11PM. Saturday evening, around Chinese New Year, it was raining, what does everyone do, go to Cheesecake Factory. Amazing. I don't even know what to rate this place, cuz the food's not spectacular."
Diane M.,"Pacifica, United States",7,11,1,3.0,30/7/2007,"My husband and I ate here for the first time on Saturday. I read some of the reviews on yelp before going and had an idea what to expect. Here's a rundown of our experience: Crowded Noisy 35-45 minute wait (come back and pick up a pager in 15 mins.) Bar area very crowded  Good people watching Service was average (had to remind the waitress to bring our drinks) Lots of yummy sounding choices on the menu Tex Mex Egg rolls were yummy, except for the hair Good size portions French fries are fresh cut potatoes. Very good. Hubby had a club sandwich which is hard to mess up. I had a chicken salad sandwich with Cesar salad & a bowl of       chicken chowder soup. All was very tasty. Prices were fair (free for us; we had a gift card! Yay!) Decor was interesting (would like to have seen the lighting at night) Surprised to see 2 men smoking on the terrace (not that      I object to smoking, just a bit surprising being in an eating      establishment) All in all, we had a good time. Would we go back? No. We prefer a quieter, less hectic restaurant."
Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, United States",708,1463,1718,3.0,27/7/2007,"Aside from the ridiculously long wait time, there are three things that bother me about the Cheesecake Factory in SF: 1) The menu is like a Macy's catalog. How can you focus on the gazillion choices of food when you are distracted by the advertisements? Who wants to get sliders when there's a 2 carat ring blinging in your eye? Why salivate over chicken madeira when you can drool over a man in a 3 piece suit? And why even think of dessert when designer purses serve as eye candy? I don't know any other restaurant that sells ad space in their menus. It's quite distracting. Effective? To a certain degree. Annoying? Yes. 2) I don't like pigeons pecking at my toes or swooping down to snag bread and bite size pieces off of my plate. Are the Alfred Hitchcock moments worth the breathtaking view from the top of the Macy's building looking down onto the square? Yes. 3) As cute and cuddly as those beanie babies were in the nineties, the nineties are over!! I don't want to stare at beanie babies when I ogle the cheesecake counter. What I do like about the Cheesecake Factory is the appetizer favorites. It's got the best of everything on 4 plates. They may have bumped up the price but it's still worth it if you are sharing it for a meal. As for the cheesecake, it's good (you can also get a cheesecake sampler from Costco on the cheap) and they have every flavor imaginable. I like their cheesecake but i will always gravitate towards the caramel apple dumpling before getting my own 5 lb slice of fat."
Lauren G.,"New York, United States",37,206,,3.0,27/7/2007,"I forgot I ever ate here. I can't go back because the portions make me sad.  Sad that there is anyone out there who would be capable of finishing them. Pretty good for a chain restaurant though, they do have a menu the size of a local magazine so everyone can find something.  It's a pretty decent place to bring tourists because your overlooking Union Square. Only get beer here though, the cocktails are very, very light on alcohol - I had to send a couple back to have liquor added in. There is this black bean Jamaican shrimp dish with plantains that is really good. The chicken dumplings are also a good starter."
