Angelo F.,"San Francisco, United States",639,192,4,3.0,27/7/2007,"""Wait, what did you say?""  ""I'm married....so me and my husband.....etc.""  Thats pretty much how the conversation was after I took an aquaintance and her sister to The Cheesecake Factory.  As cool as both of them were, it would have been nice to know that she was married BEFORE I took her here (Or else it would have been KFC and not Cheesecake Factory). Oh this is a review of the place...not my D.O.A. love life.  So back to the subject.  Huge portions +1  Great views over Union Square +1 Fast seating even when crowded +1 Beautiful patrons +1   My noodles were a little too salty for me -1 Overall a good night......despite the ""m"" word being brought up. I'll have to take a single girl here one time."
F B.,"San Francisco, United States",41,81,,3.0,27/7/2007,"How come they have to water drown every drink? Are you saying im drunk? Maybe I am, but not from them. Atleast cheesecake factory has good service. See you later, I'm gonna go replate my puttanesca in the Marc Jacobs rack downstars. Adios muchachos."
Dwayne A.,"San Francisco, United States",93,134,1,3.0,19/7/2007,"OK, I live in fear of leaving a meal hungry -- especially in foodie-riddled San Francisco where you get a little nubbin of something on a small plate dotted with ""a **insert pretentious fruit combo here** sauce"" and then max out your credit card to pay for it.  Been there, done that, over it. So, I can relax when I go to the Cheesecake Factory because the portions are actually too big even for ME to successfully finish without gaining a stretch mark or 5. However, the wait is dramatic.  Oh my god.  You ask for a table and they send you away, asking you to come back in 30 minutes ... to get your pager so you can wait another 45 minutes.  Yikes, y'all. And then the bar is so crowded it's nearly impossible to get a drink or sit down. It's also a little pricey. But of course, you actually get your money's worth, piled on your plate. So much saturated fat up in this house though.  There really should be a warning.  I got that hamburger that has STEAK on it.  yes, a hamburger topped with more beef.  And I liked it. The only other restaurant that is more likely to kill you is the ELEPHANT BAR where the portions are actually, if you can believe this, larger, IMHO. But this wait situation, man....so not worth the wait unless you have time to kill, are okay with shopping at Macy's for a while, and know that you won't actually be hungry for another hour when you get your table. Service is fine, of course, the staff seemed to be having a good time when I was there last and that's actually as important to me as the food. The view is very, very cool as well.  Make your own decision, love it or hate it!  At least you know what you're in for."
J J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,60,,3.0,15/7/2007,"Occasionally, The Cheesecake Factory sounds good. However, I think I've had too much of it that it's becoming a bit sickening. At this location there is always a wait. I always sit outside on the patio when I do come, overlooking Union Square. Though I've been here numerous times, I've only had the Shrimp and Bacon Club, the Chicken and Avocado Sandwich, Thai Salad, Chicken Littles and BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. All are pretty good, but especially the sandwiches. I did have cheesecake once, but it was way too sweet and the huge portions never leave you still craving dessert. The price is unusually inexpensive for the huge portion you get. I always share a sandwich with someone else and still end up with leftovers. Usually a pleasant experience, but sometimes the wait makes it not worth going to."
Tony L.,"San Francisco, United States",663,1265,21,3.0,4/7/2007,"This is about as good as it gets for a chain.  The pastas are decadent and the portions are big.  The drinks are also especially tasty, their bartenders definitely know what they're doing.  Their mojito is delicious.  Not too strong, not too sweet.  But why only three stars?  The wait is atrocious.  I don't know what's more boring, standing in a crowded lobby with no seating room or browsing the furniture section on the floor below at Macy's waiting for the hosts to buzz your number.   Why can't they just accept reservations?  This Cheesecake Factory has a unique location to say the least, but it's definitely not always worth the wait."
Michelle N.,"Cardiff, United States",57,108,6,3.0,28/6/2007,"I first discovered the Cheesecake factory when I was in college in Boulder.  During the summers, I loved to sit outside on Pearl Street under the trees while I feasted on the more than generous portions of food.  I ate there often because one meal actually is equivalent to three for a girl my size.  And as a college student, I appreciated the leftovers after a night of partying or a day of studying.   Today as I was sitting outside of the Cheesecake factory looking down on union square drinking my cosmopolitan, it felt like summer in the city.  I love summer days and in San Francisco those days do not grace us as often as I would like, so I was pleased to be eating outside and soaking up some rays during lunch.  The food was tasty and plentiful as always, but the service was mediocre, which I guess is expected at most chain restaurants.   I will return to this Cheesecake Factory but only on another beautifully sunny summer day, when i don't mind waiting to sit down, waiting to get a drink, waiting for my food, and of course waiting to pay the bill."
Bill B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,96,3,3.0,18/6/2007,"The waits are long, food is average at best. cheesecake is delish. There are soooo many better choices in San Francisco."

You're not gonna loose 2 pounds! You are going to gain 18! Yeah, that's right, 18 pounds! (I didn't want to reveal my real weight, so I blurred the middle digit, as you noticed..) Portions are out-of-control, so as Kristine J. suggests, takes some home. Actually, ask them to box half your meal BEFORE bringing it to your table. It'll still be enough. Prices are very reasonable for what you get.   Most meals from the 427 choices they offer vary between $10-$20. And even if you're completely stuffed after your main dish, it's the freaking CHEESECAKE factory! So it doesn't even count if you don't eat one.   So forget about the scale for now.   Pig out, eat up, and stuff yourself up  the American way."
Jessica M.,"Albany, United States",178,263,27,3.0,17/6/2007,"Underwear shopping.  At Macy*s.  And then The Cheesecake Factory... on the 7th floor?  Random, but we were hungry and familiar with the CF, so we went.  It was a 15 minute wait for a party of two to sit outside.  The view is cool, but there are a lot of tourists.  Tourists are fine with me, but they add 90% of the general confusion, sitting in taken tables, etc. I was really excited to sit outside... until the pigeons invaded, crawling all over tables that were being prepped for incoming, non-pigeon guests.  Also, bugs kept getting zapped by our overhead heater and one fell onto my spoon, writhing in burn victim agony.  This HAS to be a health code violation!  HAS TO! We all know about The CF chain; eclectic popular dishes from around the world, blanded down to the midwestern American palate.  It tastes just fine, but I don't suggest making a special trip to go here."
Ari C.,"Daly City, United States",169,356,443,3.0,17/6/2007,"Cheesecake Factory's ain't that bad. Really. I like the food, service is fine, but they're not worth the 3 hour wait. If you have a party of 5 or larger, you'll feel like you're in some psychology test measuring your patience. Once you're seated, it's actually a pretty nice restaurant with decent food. A bit noisy, but when you're on a date and totally into your date, just staring straight into your date's eyes is enough (awww) :) I'm just kidding, it gets pretty annoying actually. Food wise, I like one of their pasta dishes that has fish and arugula... I think. I'm bad with food names, sorry. The boy likes the jambalaya. I've never actually ordered their cheesecake though. I probably will someday, just cause it's called cheesecake factory. You're supposed to eat cheesecake made in their factory, right? A mini highlight of the night: I saw the SF Brown Twins ( ) here!"
s r.,"Beverly Hills, United States",171,377,49,3.0,4/6/2007,"I don't have anything against the Cheesecake Factory, per se, I just have a theory...anyone in a major city who prefers to dine at a chain restaurant is fundamentally different from me...red and blue states, if you will.  I was raised on chain restaurants, but I've outgrown their predictable and ho-hum fare served in large portions.    As it happens, every person with whom I have dined at a Cheesecake Factory is no longer in my life.  Yes, that's right...every friend or boyfriend who has suggested we eat at a CF has been kicked to the curb, including my most recent dinner partner.   This doesn't happen immediately, of course.  Rather, I view it as a sign of impending doom...the canary in the coal mine.   Thus, I have accepted it as the kiss of death to any relationship, when someone suggests we eat here, even if it is just because they love the cheesecake.  Let's face it...in a city like SF, there is no reason a city-dweller should come here.  There are just too many to-die-for restaurants at which we could dine.  This one should be left to tourists, Macy's shoppers with low blood sugar, and people who have recently moved here from less sophisticated areas...like Des Moines. I dined here in May with my BF at the time.  The food was good and the service was friendly and attentive.  We were given the standard flashing-light beeper and waited outside on the terrace for about 30 minutes...not bad on a weekend evening.  By the time we finished our meal, it had gotten so cold that we ordered coffee and cheesecake to go.  For this reason, I recommend sitting inside if it is after 3 PM, even if you have a coat and scarf. If you are someone who enjoys the food at this chain, this is definitely one that you should check out.  The roof terrace is nice, with its view overlooking Union Square.  They have patio heaters that emit a nice warmth, although it was still chilly when the sun set, and quite windy while the sun was still out.  You can even peruse the extra menus they keep in the inside waiting area, so you can order once you are seated.  This ensures that you don't spend too much time occupying their tables.  There are people waiting for your table...didn't you notice?!   So let it be said that should we ever find ourselves friends or dating, this can be our trigger phrase.  When you are ready to move on, all you need to do to clue me in is to suggest that we eat dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.   I'll promptly dismiss you as the bridge and tunnel unsophisticate that you are, and be happily on my way."
Mijiza M. S.,"Palo Alto, United States",111,70,9,3.0,25/5/2007,"Cheesecake - FABULOUS!!! Food - ALRIGHT... Drinks/Cocktails - UGGHHHHH!!! Don't I repeat, DO NOT waste your time at the bar... the drinks are totally watered down and eh, not so great.  The cheesecake on the other hand is worth the sometimes hour wait.  Food is decent... but then again, since you have to wait so damn long for a table anything would taste good, because you are freaking STARVING by the time you get a table.  However, all is well when you save room for dessert.   TIP: Some select Barnes & Noble that have Starbucks in them serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes... you can save yourself the headache and hit up B&N and indulge in the yummy cheesecakes.  Unless of course you like waiting around with a vibrator thingy in your hand..."
May A.,"CA, United States",59,188,,3.0,17/5/2007,The only think I liked about Cheesecake Factory in SF is the cheesecake.  The wait was way to long and food was just okay and a big pricey.  I was disappointed.
A W.,"San Francisco, United States",187,187,8,3.0,12/5/2007,"I've never been here without there being a 45 minute wait...or 10 Marina Girls at the bar. The sweet corn tamale cakes--and the cheesecake of course--are always the best part of the meal!  The main dishes are ""eh,"" partly, I'm sure, because there aren't too many choices for vegetarians. The atmosphere is fun; you take the elevator up from Macy's to the restaurant... and it is so pretty at night from the balcony!"
tulipa L.,"San Francisco, United States",17,38,,3.0,9/5/2007,"I have had actual meals here 3 times, cheesecake from here many times. meals? not so good, unless you get something heart-attacky like the fried macaroni. the peanutbutter cup cheesecake is digusting in concept, superb in execution."
Marie F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,46,1,3.0,28/4/2007,"Service is slow, the wait is horrible, the food is okay, the drinks are overpriced and good luck getting one!  A place where you find a congregation of the bridge and tunnel crowd, especially on the weekends. But the view is priceless.... and I can 'dump' my man at the bar while I go shopping downstairs at Macy's!!"
Bernard V.,"Las Vegas, United States",23,51,36,3.0,25/4/2007,"I decided to dine here with my friend, we waited for two hours only to be seated outside.. duh, it's so freakin cold.. I said no, waited another hour, finally got a seat, on our table there is no fork, and my knife is dirty. Our waitress was so busy attending others that when we ask for a new silverwares, she's holding ton's of dishes on her other hand. All of a sudden they all went to the floor, sad to witness such disaster that no other server manage to offfer her a hand. The food was great though.. but the service really sucks, and it is so noisy.."
Lisa T.,"Oakland, United States",253,295,10,3.0,15/4/2007,"Face it: it's all about the patio. You're waiting in line for at least half an hour, then waiting in line for ten minutes more (because they have the screwiest, most complicated waiting system ever; how important do they think they are?) just to sit outside over Union Square after a Macy's shopping marathon. Or not: I've never shopped at Macy's. I ate here to escape a barrage of come-ons from web geeks at a conference at the St. Francis.  But know this: the food isn't worth the wait. It's just, you know --- burgers and salads and typical Americana fare, prepared just --- okay. Though they do give you lots and lots of it. To the point that it's actually wasteful. And I don't really get that... No one could possibly clean their plate, even if it was the most amazing Americana fare in America. If you survive the wait for the patio, just enjoy the novelty of dining there. And watch out for the pigeons."
Judy K.,"San Francisco, United States",159,276,118,3.0,9/4/2007,"Not worth the FRUSTRATION!  Other than the Tiramisu Cheesecake and the Chicken Cesar Salad, everything else is just mediocre.  We have been there at various hours and the wait has always been looooooong.  Then when you actually get to a table, the service is just lacking!  The rooftop dining is however, very cool...if you plan on a 3 hour lunch."
Rei E.,"San Francisco, United States",63,66,25,3.0,4/4/2007,"Definitely overrated for the wait, crowd, food, and prices.  However, the decor is really nice and the menu is vast if you need to feed a picky eater.  It's been a while since I've been there, so I actually don't remember what I've ordered.   I know I had some kind of jambalaya that was not very good.  There was something else with mashed potatoes, and I remember the potatoes being yummy...  The first time I went there with three people and we each ordered our own plate plus an appetizer  and a cocktail.  We asked the server if he thought that was too much food and he said no!!! But it was way too much food and the bill was scary... Now, it's more of a place I'll go for coffee and dessert.  Maybe a few appetizers.  But if the wait is too long, I don't stick around.  Dining in this city is too good for that."
