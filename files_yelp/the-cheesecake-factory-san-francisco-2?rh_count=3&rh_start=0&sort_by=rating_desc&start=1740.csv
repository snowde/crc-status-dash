Marie G.,"San Francisco, United States",41,68,27,3.0,3/4/2007,My fave dishes here are Miso Salmon and the super appetizer with everything in it (enought for 2 big eaters or 3 small eaters). Don't forget the Peach Bellini. Worth every penny. Usually the wait sucks but thanks to my addiction to shopping I'll settle.
Barron E.,"San Francisco, United States",26,20,,3.0,27/3/2007,"It really should be 2.5 stars, but I'm round up because I like going there for drinks on weekend afternoons when I'm in the area. The food is typical chain stuff, nothing really that good, nothing really that bad. I tend to think that Cheesecake factory is a bit overpriced though. There are plenty of places in the city that have much better food for the same price or less. I do have to give them a thumbs up on the mojitos, they are big and they have a decent amount of alcohol. I think this place is clearly going to draw mainly tourists, given its location. Its too bad because they'll eat here and miss out on some culinary masterpieces the city has to offer."
Kristina A.,"San Francisco, United States",466,261,118,3.0,26/3/2007,"This place is decent - if you can stand the wait for a table. You should be able to at least get a drink at the bar, but most people there are eating since they didn't have to wait for a real table. So you can't get anything at this place without waiting. They give you a big flashy buzzer that at least lets you go down one level to the Macy's furniture section to sit and wait. The food is alright but not really worth the prices. The appetizers are more appropriately priced so I usually just end up getting a starter, a drink and a piece of cheesecake. Their drink menu and dessert menu are the only real reason to visit any Cheesecake factory. They have a good variety of mixed drinks, blended drinks, and coffee drinks with different alcohol variations to choose from. They have to have at least 20 kinds of cheesecake and they have other kinds of desserts, too. After a thorough sampling of the entire menu, I've decided the tiramisu cheesecake is the best. The BEST I tell you! It's tiramisu AND cheesecake together in one utterly heavenly slice with a mound of real whipped cream next to it. Since I'm usually too impatient for cheesecake and Irish coffee to wait for a table here, I usually just get a piece to go and take it over to the Gold Dust where they have $2.95 Irish Coffee during happy hour."
Solomon C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,21,,3.0,14/3/2007,"This is a tough one. Cheesecake factory really is nothing special when it comes to food-- people go there because its on top of a building, in the middle of shopping central, over looking union square. For some reason, I always sucker myself into going during christmas-- it's easy to make a night out of it. I mean... damn... they are doing all they can-- there are bus loads of tourists lining the halls of this place, so you just got to take it in stride. Get on the list for the pager. Go shopping for an hour. Come back and get the pager. Go look at the cute cats and dogs in the windows down on street level, stroll around the tree in union square, maybe eat a roasted chestnut or two, and before you know it..."
Emily F.,"Brooklyn, United States",10,85,,3.0,9/3/2007,"Just to prove I'm not a snob. Sometimes, you just can't put a price on heat lamps and an awesome view of Union Square. The bottom line:  I bet the Hartford CF doesn't have a view like that!  ERF I'm going to be dead broke by the time the last of these out-of-town guests departs!"
Joel D.,"San Francisco, United States",2,16,,3.0,4/3/2007,"Great place, great food, great drinks. The view is awesome, and the service is decent. VERY long wait to be seated though.  I have been there a countless amount of times, and have had actual full coarse meals there about 20 times. Out of them 20 times I absolutely loved each and every meal. Never had a problem with any of the food ever. And as for their name ""Cheese Cake"" - it is definitely wonderful there too. I like ORIGINAL cheesecake with strawberrys (like normal people do), I am not into that weird new invention cheesecake with chocolate, and just a bunch of stuff cheesecakes are not suppose to have on or in them. And well, my experience with their cheesecakes have been excellent. I have ordered whole cheesecakes there as well for home.. GREAT !!! I really don't know what some of these other reviewers are talking about, the place is very nice and if you are a TRUE S.F. O.G. you EITHER know the perfect times to go so its not such a ""tourist trap"" , or (like most of us) you just stay the hell out of the whole downtown area anyway and not complain about it. When its time to go out, its time to go out, period,,, deal with it. The view is exceptional for sure, very nice to drink alot, talk, and just enjoy it. 3 stars from me because it is great for all the reasons I stated above, BUT the wait is too long, and it is located right in the middle of polictical, demographic, trendy, fashion brainwashing downtown.... And for my patented ""Is It A Get Laid At The End Of The Night Place"" review --------- YES !! this one qualifies. So take some ladies there guys !! Hell 2 at a time if ya can !! lol"
Melissa W.,"Belmont, United States",31,281,,3.0,2/2/2007,"The good: perfect seared tuna salad. Nice little pile of dark greens, a few slices of good tomato, a little skimpy on the avocado slices but ok, and then some very nice perfectly seared rare Ahi. I was trying to stick to just meat and veggies and this made being ""on a diet"" so much nicer. The bad: Arriving shortly before noon for lunch we were told to seat ourselves in the bar and waved away. The tiny space directly across from the bar was quite full. I kept walking to the tables on the other side and sat down. We sat there 10 or 15 minutes before anyone bothered with us.  A waiter came and asked, ""Did you get menus""  ""No, actually, we didn't."" ""Did someone seat you here?""  ""No, we were told to help ourselves to seating in this direction."" (I showed him the hand wave gesture we have received.) ""That meant just the bar."" (Turns and flounces away with a big stupid smile.) The ugly: It's a chain with too much attitude (see above). So many much better places to eat so close by, everyone else has asked why this place is always so crowded and I can't say I know either. I came here for the big menu while I was being picky about what I eat."
Tamar N.,"Astoria, United States",31,255,1,3.0,12/1/2007,"FAT AMERICA - shame on you. That said, three stars for their stellar take-out service."
tamara w.,"Irvine, United States",171,174,1,3.0,7/1/2007,"Most of the times when I come here, it's because my coworkers and I are at Macworld and it's a tradition to come once a year.  Yes, that's right. I'm continuing my trend of reviewing places related to Macworld.  I'm not an Apple geek I swear.  I just exhibit at the show.   I don't understand why this place is always so busy and dark.  By the end of the day, I just want to sit down and relax but not fall asleep.  The darkness in here does nothing to help me there.  The food is average.  Be warned, the potpie is huge!  The salads aren't bad.  But who really comes here for the food?  I come here for key lime cheesecake!  But because the food portions are so big, by dessert time I'm full.  So I usually order my slice of cheesecake to go.  While my friends are eating their desserts, I take one bite of mine and put the rest away for when I'm not so tired.  It tastes pretty good the next day. Service can be hit or miss.  Most of the times we've come here, the service hasn't been too bad.  But truthfully, we're so zombielike after working at the show that we probably wouldn't notice.  We're just happy to be sitting down and not talking about software."
Annie W.,"Burlingame, United States",2,29,10,3.0,17/12/2006,"food was ok, service was good, the place is special( but too cold for sitting outside)  No reservation service, we have to wait....and that's a long line to wait!!! The cheese cake is nice, but i'm not cheesey-person...."
Lauren F.,"San Diego, United States",656,700,112,3.0,13/12/2006,"3:00 weekday on the patio during a warm day.  That is the only time you should come here.  Lines are terrible, food is well priced for what you get, but the wait alone makes it totally not worth it.   What i never understood about this place (and ill be honest, i worked here for a year and a half), is how people can wait that long for food!  Valentines day, people come in and wait 3.5-4 hours just for a table that is so close to the next one there is no privacy.  Im sorry, but if my date was to ever even think about taking me here on valentines day, id break up with him or never talk to him again.   It shows me that: a) he didnt have the plans made ahead of time and this is totally last minute.  b) i could have eaten two meals in that time...make me a meal at home, more romantic than sitting in a lobby with crying kids, and  c) that this is the level he thinks of me.... But....go here on a wednesday at 3 and have a JW's pink lemonade on the patio, and you will be a happy camper.  Or sit at the bar, and ask for the cute bartender Mandy...tell her Lauren sent you. The staff is great too."
Lisa M.,"Brooklyn, United States",27,151,10,3.0,12/12/2006,"well... there is technically nothing special about this restaurant, but for some reason no matter what the occasion is, we end up here. your birthday? celebrate with cheesecake factory. your dog died? drown your sorrows in a slice of godiva. your mailorder bride finally came in? bring her and the gang on over the see huge american servings and the slightly too high prices we pay for them. the waits are long, and the buzzers only sometimes work in the rest of macys proper. but i'm sure i will see you there next time my friend get her gall bladder out or something."
Ahmad R.,"Los Angeles, United States",16,54,,3.0,29/11/2006,"People..dont let the small stuff detract you from the big picture... Ok..we can all laugh at the tourists and lil kids and grammas running around the 'factory. We can talk about how mediocre the food is..even the cheesecake (as quiet as thats kept) but one simple and cool point people miss.. This is the ONLY place in union square where you can get a mojito on Saturday at 10am. All those fancy hotel bars, Closed. other local bars, Closed the Cheesecake factory is in business...serving drinks. That is AT LEAST worth 3 stars.. thanks, im out!"
Geoff K.,"San Francisco, United States",81,199,3,3.0,25/11/2006,"Now I know why Americans are fat: restaurants like this.  You sit for two hours waiting to eat, and then you eat food that is either deep-fried or otherwise reconstituted to be as unhealthy as possible for you.  It honestly took me ten minutes to find something vaguely not unhealthy on the menu.  I'm not a health freak, but this place is absurd.   Also, there are just too many choices.  The kitchen must take up a floor of Macy's to be big enough to turn out all these options.  I will say they made a nice martini while we were waiting.  The decor is absolutely atrocious.  Think PF Changs on acid.  Our waiter was definitely high, which is understandable.  We split some spinach dip (good) and then I had a burger (quite good) while she had lettuce wraps that took up half the table.   I wanted cheesecake, of course.  But unless you're a morbidly obese red state tourist or an offensive lineman for the 49ers, I just don't see how you can have room for dessert after eating here.  I had to be wheeled out on a stretcher.   This restaurant is the epitome of why mass food sucks.  The fact that tourists dine at this spot in the middle of San Francisco is a crying shame.  That said, I thought my burger was pretty good.  And the place is inexpensive."
Bren L.,"Oakland, United States",28,222,12,3.0,12/11/2006,"wayyyy too crowded at any time of the day. i always try to avoid this place but for some reason i always get lured into going. they dont take reservations but if you know ""someone"" they can always squeeze you in. the food portion is HUGE and you always have to doggie bag 'em home.  so eat small and save room for the overly rich cheesecake at the end."
Carol Y.,"San Francisco, United States",446,942,526,3.0,8/11/2006,"Cheesecake Factories are famous for their huge portions and huge selection on their menu. This CF is located at the top of the Macy's in Union Square, so it's a great place to go after a busy day of shopping. There's outside seating on the balcony when it's warm and not too windy. however, the service and the wait gives cheesecake factory a lower rating.  if you really want to eat there -- try going during the weekdays or around 11am during the weekends."
Michelle W.,"Cambridge, United States",33,241,,3.0,30/10/2006,"a great place to go after catching a show at the warfield.  that late at night, you'll actually get a seat within 15 minutes as opposed to the usual, what, hour?  no kidding!  =D it's the cheesecake factory.  everything on the menu is  probably good.  i only had appetizers.  fries and the mini-burgers (comes with 4).  kind of heavy for late-night nosh, but no major compliants. UPDATE: looks like wednesday nights are also a good time to frequent the factory of cheesecake!  20 minute wait!  booyah."
Derek Alistair J.,"San Francisco, United States",89,146,,3.0,21/10/2006,bland food. just a tab over mediocore on dessert.
Ginni S.,"Cupertino, United States",41,310,,3.0,17/10/2006,"The LONG wait -- you have to even wait to get the beeper.  What's that about?  The portions are huge and the cheesecakes are great (except I'm always full by the time we're supposed to order dessert.) Major turn-off is still that huge long wait...I don't think I've ever been seated within 10 minutes, unless I sit at the bar.  I don't get it.  WHY???"
Diane S.,"San Francisco, United States",822,269,44,3.0,29/9/2006,"The food is actually really tasty for a chain place...but of course, it's a tourist trap. So...it gets super packed and the wait is ridiculous, however, there are not a ton of places to stop and re-fuel on a serious afternoon of shopping. I will eat here again because I like the food and I need to eat before attempting to shop at H&M down the road...so though I don't love it here, it serves it's purpose."
