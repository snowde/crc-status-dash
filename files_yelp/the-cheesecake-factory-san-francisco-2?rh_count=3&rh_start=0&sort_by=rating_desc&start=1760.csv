Mike V.,"Daly City, United States",173,171,59,3.0,27/9/2006,"Let's get an overall feel for this place... Parking:  there is none unless u park in a lot Price:  on my budget, I call it pricey...but if you don't mind spending about $20 a person, it's cool Menu:  Pretty good and diverse...typical stuff, burgers, plates, and all that other jazz Wait:  forever...takes forever to get a table (gotta carry that pager thingy) and takes forever to get food...reserve lots of time if u plan on eating here Actual Food:  pretty good...not great, but pretty damn good Service:  eh, a few funny people, lots of mediocre overworked folks... So there you have it..."
Leslie Ann R.,"San Francisco, United States",136,109,3,3.0,26/9/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory is why there is an obesity epidemic. I've eaten here many, many, many times and even when there is a TON of food left (and there always is), I never want to take it home.  In a city like San Francisco, it always surprises me just how packed this restaurant is...there are so  many others to choose from; it's not like when I grew up in the suburbs and whenever it was someone's birthday, this was the only game in town.   But three stars...for the blue cheese stuffed olives in the martini."
Jess S.,"San Francisco, United States",93,121,6,3.0,21/9/2006,"I hate the Cheescakecake Factory for many reasons.  Now, you might be asking yourself, why does she review it...especially with 3 stars?  Well, let me tell you a story.  I've been three time: once with the parental units, once on the WORST date I've had in ages and once last night with some friends.   Okay, the first time...   - Food is okay, too rich and too much I felt, but who am I to complain?  The waiter was obnoxious with a capital O.  I see him every time I go there and I swear he recognizes me every time, possibly because I am pretty sure that to keep his job he can't act the way he did towards me to many people. Second time:   - Food is gross, company sucks and I end up paying. Third time:   - Bartender is rude, then I am feisty back and end up not being charged for anything (I left a great tip for it)  This is the reason for the three stars. Bottom line: If you don't eat cheesecake, it's just overpriced and loud."
Matt G.,"San Francisco, United States",2161,1911,3823,3.0,19/9/2006,"It has been 6 years since Matt has stepped his size 12 foot in Cheesecake Factory of Union Square. Everytime Matt comes here, there is always a long wait and extremely bad service occurring frequently, which pissed Matt off.  After a extended layoff in coming to the restaurant, Matt decides to comeback and see if they have corrected the restaurants' problem that everybody is complaining from reading their shitty reviews.  The Fantastic Four came here on Tuesday night, and the wait (15 minutes in compare to 1hour 45 min) was shorter this time around. A slight improvement from the last time. The waitress was nicer to the Fantastic Four this time, by giving us  a table quickly and coming back frequently filling up our water. Which was cool!!  Matt ordered the Shepherd Pie for $12.00. It tasted OK, but it was a good size. Wifey ordered the the New Orlean Pasta. The pasta didn't look too appealing, and it looked like Hurricane Katrina damaged the pasta, but it was OK as well.  The Rugrats ordered and splitted a Caesar Salad and Bruschetta. Most kids hate vegetables, but Mr. Rugrat loves Caesar Salad. He might grow up to be a Vegan.   We bypass desserts this time, which disappointed wifey, who was eyeing and salivating at the dessert counter like Odie. We got out of the restaurant in a tad over an hour, which seems short. Six years ago, Matt would rate this restaurant a one-star, like most of you would. This time it's a 3 star, certain thing has been corrected from the last time we came. But they need more work to be a five-star."
charlotte s.,"Stavanger, Norway",92,1233,31,3.0,4/9/2006,"i don't know why there seems to always be a rather long wait for a table at the cheesecake factory...  sometimes during the weekdays on in between hours it's been easy to get seated. i don't go here very often, but once in a while it's a good choice if we can't decide on what we feel like eating...  their menu is ginormeous and there's bound to be something that you'll feel like eating.   for a chain, the flavors have been pretty good on whatever i've ordered.  not too bland, but yet pretty safe for various palates... the service is your typical corporate restaurant style... pretty mechanical, but i've never had any bad experiences with the staff. the prices are very reasonable... especially since each dish can feed 3 people easily... there will always be food left over, which is a pity if you're not wanting to take the rest to go.   that's one thing i don't like about this chain... i'm sure they have alot of food waste... the sizes are definately way excessive in portion size.... i rarely have any room for dessert, but they're pretty good too... not anything out of the world, but a very large cheesecake menu... cocktails are not that interesting either... alot of sugary sweet drinks"
Teri C.,"Las Vegas, United States",1629,1012,2245,3.0,1/9/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory does well simply because it's a chain.  They know what works well for the masses, and that's what keeps them busy.  Whenever you have a group, everyone is bound to find at least one thing they like off their huge menu.   Sure, the wait is forever long.  Yes, even an hour on weeknights.  But for some reason, I keep on coming back.  I had some great service there, and I had some bad. I usually LOVE the sourdough bread and can't get enough.  However, there was this one time where it just didn't taste the same and I was highly disappointed.  Most people really dig that dark bread though.   The portions are huge and us being Americans, we expect huge. We complain when the portions are too small, so at least at The Cheesecake Factory, you're paying for what you get. I've gone and ordered appetizers galore and had a feast.  Other times I just order an entree and never made it to dessert.  I've had friends rave about their cheesecake while others give the thumbs down on their other desserts. All in all, I'll keep on returning there.  It's crazy loud and maybe that's too much for some people.  But with that kind of energy, sometimes you want to just be a part of it all. If you don't want to wait, grab a seat by the bar.  Have a drink there too.  But of course, get some cheesecake!"
Mike L.,"San Francisco, United States",29,105,42,3.0,24/8/2006,What's up buddy? Hey listen I've been to this place and well its not bad. I know that its for tourists and its a chain but its not way cruddy. A buddy of mine drink 2 gallons of milk here in less than an hour and the ribs here are great too. Cheese cake here is ooo la la
Jane D.,"Fremont, United States",203,604,8,3.0,20/8/2006,Everyone is hatin this place. Its the biggest restaurant in the downtown San Francisco. I think it its to be expected. So if you go in with the expectation that you're going to wait until the next election..your experience will be fine. We sent my fiance to wait for a table while we shopped. He just played video games on his phone until our table was ready like 2 hours later. NO sweat...expectactions...its all about expectations...
Kyla B.,"San Francisco, United States",105,151,2,3.0,16/8/2006,"It is what it is and being that I'm pretty picky about the quality of my grub, the frozen, preservative-packed fare here is never my first choice.  However, sometimes it cannot be avoided.  On these occasions I will turn a blind eye to all that I know is unholy and blissfully tuck into the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad."
Mary L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,11,,3.0,11/8/2006,GREAT for satisfying late night sweet tooth cravings. They're open till 2am. No crowds at 2am!
spiff e.,"San Francisco, United States",55,462,146,3.0,1/8/2006,"Almost always a super long wait and the food isn't that super special.  But they do have some items that I don't mind getting again and again when I do go, like the avocado eggrolls, the crispy crab wontons, the georgia peach and the carrot cake.  Not all in one sitting though, that'd be craziness because their portions are huge, made to be shared (but I usually don't). Easy place to bring tourist friends after shopping since the patio offers a nice view of Union Square.  I wouldn't come here with family though, it's way too loud and theme-y."
Doris Y.,"Alameda, United States",26,28,22,3.0,26/7/2006,"i'm surprised at all negative comments about the big portions. yall complain when portions are too small and when they're too big, sheesh, there's no pleasing you guys. well, the main complaint for me is definately the wait. for the time i had to wait, i expected better food. and for a place named ""cheesecake factory"" i also expected better cheesecake. and usually when i finally get seated i would see quite a few empty tables, what the heck is that about? though i really like the view from the terrace, it's quite relaxing from up there.  i think the the main appeal of this place is the novelty and tourist attraction hype. other than that, there are plenty of better options out there. on a positive note the last time i went here, the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic was mighty tasty and our waitress was super friendly. it was the only positive experience i've had out of the four times i've been here, so i thought i'd be generous and give it another star."
Albert W.,"San Francisco, United States",15,60,3,3.0,19/7/2006,"I've been eating at different cheesecake and at different cheesecake location, to me the food are ok, a little too much sometimes.  This particular cheesecake inside macy is not for local people, it is designed for tourists.  The waits are too long, it is very crowded.  If you have other restaurant to go to, don't go there."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, United States",41,15,,3.0,27/6/2006,"I've enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory at other locations but this one is the worst. Every tourist in SF must see The Cheesecake Factory and think ""Oh good, a restaurant i recognize"" because man oh man, this place is always packed.  My friends wanted to go there for a birthday. They didn't listen when i said the wait would be 2 hours. I got dragged along knowing I'd be hungry for hours - so I secretly ate a small dinner before heading over ;-) ... 1 BART ride and 4 hours later we were seated.  My friends were all mad at *me* for some reason! It sucks being the fore-bearer of bad news. I tried to warn them, oh well. Aside from the wait - the portions are asinine. I'd love this place if they had smaller portions, shorter waits, or at least took reservations.  At least the food is generally pretty good - but never great. I think the Cheesecake Factory is part of some conspiracy with McDonald's to make America fat because the portions are ludicrously large. Is this supposed to be some sort of replacement for guilt-inducing ""All you can eat"" places?  It's OK to order gargantuan dishes and eat it all - but ""all you can eat"" means you are a pig? I once went on a date to Cheesecake factory and we split a Santa Fe salad and were both quite satisfied.  It was hard to resist the urge to order tons of food after waiting so long to eat - resisting that ""omg I'm going to starve to death if I don't eat soon"" feeling - but I'm glad we did.  Portion control saved my wallet *and* my waistline that night!"
Vanessa Z.,"Sacramento, United States",205,341,9,3.0,18/5/2006,"This place is ok if you want to wait 2 hours to eat.  Very touristy place, but I must say they have a pretty good view of Union Square if you get a table outside or close enough to the window.  Food is overpriced, but you do get large proportions.  HUGE selection of food.  Their menu is practically a novel.  Food quality is pretty good, but not the best.  I LOVE their Fabulous Chocolate Mousse Cake much better than any of the cheesecakes.  If you want their food and have all night, I say go for it, but if not then get it to go."
Raj K.,"San Francisco, United States",7,155,3,3.0,3/5/2006,"Never having been here before, I decided to give this place a shot. Now lets get the negatives out of the way first. The line almost never-ending kept us at almost a 30-40min wait. There seemed to be very few SF natives, mostly tourists, not a bad thing though cause of course thats what san francisco is all about. Now the good stuff, the portions were huge, and oh of course if u love cheesecake this place won't dissapoint....."
Joc V.,"Oakland, United States",88,666,141,3.0,11/4/2006,"It's not THAT bad.    Sure it's middle America.  Sure it's the culmination of a tourist's culinary adventure.  But even Cheesecake Factory has its place in a food lover's heart.  I'll go if I get passed out-hungry after 6 floors of Macy's.  I'll even enjoy the flash fried salmon rolls and dulce de leche cheesecake.  I've had worse.  I'm sure our guests from foreign countries brag to all their friends back home about this place, especially those from 3rd world nations.  Because Cheesecake Factory is what the US of A is all about: EXCESS!"
Nicole I.,"Oakland, United States",141,260,6,3.0,26/2/2006,"Definately not worth the long wait (maybe 30minutes or more depending on the day/night).  The portions are huge enough for a table to split.  The food was pretty bland, but our waiter was good.  We never had to wait long for anything and he was always helpful.     But, the cheesecake was so delicious!  Don't go for the food just the cheesecake.  The lines are a little shorter and then you can go someplace else to eat."
Grace M.,"Boston, United States",695,810,204,3.0,9/2/2006,Food is great... but the wait time is ridiculously long!   RIDICULOUSLY LONG WAITS ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS! It's almost not even worth staying for the food. The Jamaican Jerk chicken dish is really fantastic. Don't get the pizzas The avocado rolls are always great ***Dulce de leche cheesecake ***fresh strawberry cheesecake
Lucas M.,"San Francisco, United States",116,94,5,3.0,7/2/2006,"Always stunned by the waiting time...and perhaps more stunned that we end up waiting.  Great place to take out of town guests who might not have an adventurous palate, and the portions are huge.  Turn dinner into lunch the next day if leftovers are your thing.  The tourists by the busload can get aggrivating, so try and hit it on off peak dining times."
