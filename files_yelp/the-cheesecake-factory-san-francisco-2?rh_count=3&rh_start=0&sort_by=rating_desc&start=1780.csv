Rego S.,"San Francisco, United States",91,269,37,3.0,15/1/2006,"The best time to come here is opening time, around 11am.  Otherwise, you're in for some pretty lousy service.  I came here at 2:30 on a Friday with my best friend from home, who'd been a waitress for years and picked up on several standards that were completely absent from our meal.  They didn't apologize when we had to ask them three times about a drink before it finally arrived, they didn't bring any sugar for the espresso, there was no asking if they could get anything for us when the food arrived, nor were we ever asked if the food was all right.  On a brighter note, I had the best vinegarette dressing ever."
Mokirobinson M.,"Chapel Hill, United States",145,161,1,3.0,10/1/2006,"They got both tastes here, sweet AND salty.   I like CF because I get to feel like a complete girl and order giant, sweet, alcoholic beverages and no one bats an eyelash.  Then I sit on the patio, soak up the view and smoke to my heart's content (so to speak).  The whoosh of traffic usually drowns out the sound of cranky children.  Or you can sneak some pina colada into their sippy cups and they fall right to sleep.  Little angels.  The food is pretty nasty but if you stick with burgers or one of the 2,000 calorie salads you can roll out of there without feeling too greasy.  Look, it's cheaper than a trip to the fly-over states...go on, visit ""Amurica"" and then relax and sink into it."
Courtney P.,"Hercules, United States",37,29,2,3.0,10/1/2006,The long wait at this place is too long considering the cake is not out-of-this-world good. Not worth the hype.
Marco M.,"San Francisco, United States",29,396,116,3.0,22/11/2005,"If gluttony was a restaurant this place is it. Salads and burgers are good, enormous portions though. There are enough varieties of cheesecake, which you could come back every week for a year and still not have tried them all. The only thing that's really a bummer about this place is, you acquire a pager when you arrive and told to wait 45 minutes. Well, at least you can walk around Macy's."
Adam S.,"Livermore, United States",28,87,7,3.0,17/11/2005,"The wait was long, but with good friends and a nice outside view (it was nice and sunny), it was bearable.  I had the Pumpkin Cheesecake that was good and the Tiramisu which was good as well.  The only problem was the portioning, it was to much.  SO MUCH WHIP CREAM!!!"
Joanna S.,"San Francisco, United States",68,393,,3.0,15/11/2005,"Despite being a chain restaurant, I like the Cheesecake Factory a lot.  I always  get the Santa Fe Salad, which I find to have the right amount of kick in it.  I also love sitting outside when it is warm on the terrace and looking at Union Square."
Jill D.,"San Francisco, United States",473,1113,3,3.0,20/8/2005,"The cheesecakes are the best and so are the avocado roll appetizers.  Love the key lime cheesecake and the portions are pretty decent.  Don't love the wait and the fact that this place has so many issues like water pressure problems so frequently.  But if you need to meet someone unfamiliar with SF somewhere recognizable and don't mind spending the cash, this is the place."
Michael K.,"San Francisco, United States",143,220,18,3.0,17/6/2005,"Yes, it is ridiculous to wait 1-2 hr for a table. But I can't deny the food is scrumptious and comes in an enormous portions. No reservation is accepted. Cheesecake is their trademark and definately a showstopper."
Stephanie P.,"San Francisco, United States",15,95,,3.0,14/4/2005,"Take out is the way to go... I've never once waited for less than an hour and a half.  Gotta love the huge menu selection, you know exactly what you're getting every time you order!"
Nish N.,"San Francisco, United States",4571,1883,526,3.0,9/4/2005,"Why is there always a line here, especially with so many other great, local eateries within walking distance? That said, I have to admit their large variety of cheesecakes - one of my favorite types of dessert - is hard to beat."
Bob G.,"Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, United States",291,158,102,3.0,31/10/2004,Fun restaurant at the top of Macy's with great views over Union Square. On a hot day sit outside on the terrace amid the huge M-A-C-Y-S characters.  Expect a 30min wait to be seated during tourist season.  Best to enter on Geary Street.
Kat V.,"Redding, United States",0,15,4,2.0,8/1/2018,"It was an extremely busy night and the wait was 2 hours. They give you a ticket and tell you to report - only to give you a beeper so, they aren't really being honest about how long it takes. We had 2 kids so it was extra long for them.  Finally got seated and the waitress brought drinks. That was messed up - they brought the wrong drink for the youngest (who wanted tea but ended up with water).  While that was happening - I noticed my silverware was dirty (stuck on dried food) so everyone checked theirs and we came up with 3 dirty forks out of 6 and 2 knives. That's when we noticed that the table settings were incomplete and possibly someone had high-graded the settings (no napkins, no spoons, etc). We pointed out to the waitress and she reported it to the manager and brought all new place settings (good job here).  We ordered and after about 20 minutes, a guy walked up (did not introduce himself) to tell us there were no meatballs for my HB's spaghetti and did he want something else (causing more delays). at this time - we again complained about the dirty silverware. This guy seemed unimpressed and brushed us off to hustle away. When the waitress returned, we asked who the other person was and she said he was the Assistant Manager.  All-in-all, the food was good but the problems with the wait, silverware, and running out of food made this a bad experience.  At the end of the meal, we sort of expected some kind of discount on a drink or a meal but - when no concessions were made - my son got very angry and asked to see the manager.  Another long wait and some OTHER guy came over. He must have been the sacrificial lamb as he was NOT the manager or assistant.  He was nice enough but my son told him why we were upset.  We did say that it was not the waitresses fault in general.   SO - my advice is to wander up there for the view and then go somewhere else for food."
David C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,5,2.0,7/1/2018,"I only give this establishment 2 stars at most because the food is actually not bad at all. My issue is with the service........or lack thereof. The frontline staff sadly had problems knowing where to seat people with no structure or order whatsoever. It was as if we were all playing musical chairs in hopes of finding somewhere to be seated. The service we got from our waitstaff was less than impressive. Sometimes I just wanted to go grab what we needed and we would have been serviced better. For the amount one pays here, how good the food and decor is you would expect the service to match. Not even close. Management is either setting no example, a poor example or is allowing this to pass under their noses. And every time we come here it's the same result: good food but crappy service.....sad."
Aubrey D.,"Fairfield, United States",356,413,569,2.0,6/1/2018,"I only want a slice of cheesecake, but why does this specific location makes ordering a slice so difficult? Oh wait... That's right! It's the ultimate tourist trap for all travelers and locals alike! Location: You can find the restaurant at the tippy top floor of the Macy's within San Francisco's Union Square. Just take an elevator and enjoy the 45 seconds of awkward silence as the elevator rushes people to the top. From there you will find a dimmed restaurant with thousands of tourists and disgruntled employees. On the other hand, good luck finding parking! Your best bet is to park inside one of the parking garages unless you're daring enough to walk 5-10 blocks from the area. Be prepared with some cash as some parking places take cash only. Setting: As I mentioned before, the CCF is at the tippy top floor of the gigantic Macy's. This place is great for a h-angry someone who ADORES waiting 20-120 minutes for a seat to dine-in. Not to mention ordering a slice of cheesecake to-go can be just as long as waiting for a seat to dine-in. While the views at the top are spectacular during the night time, there's seating inside of the restaurant and on the outdoor balcony. While this restaurant is noisy full of chatter from different patrons, if you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, I highly suggest you look elsewhere. Customer Service: I feel the pain for the employees who have to work twice as hard to ensure everyone is happy. However, I have to give them kudos for working at the busiest CCF on the planet. Despite all the patrons coming in and out of the restaurant, they do a pretty decent job at handling the crowd. On the other hand, if you only want a slice of cheesecake to-go, I recommend ordering through the phone instead of waiting in line to order something. Food: I only have the Chocolate Macadamia slice of cheesecake. It was BOMB, smooth, and nutty. Even though there's a HUGE chunk of whipped cream on the side, the cheesecake itself is best shared with two people. On the other hand, for the $8-9 a slice, it would be a better option to find a dessert place who sells the same thing at a lower price. Overall: Despite the high prices, tourists, and all the crazy schemes happening at this CCF location, I'll give it a plus for the views at the top. However, if I were you, I'd find somewhere else to eat in SF that serves decent cheesecake at a lower price."
Ara L.,"El Sobrante, United States",2,14,,2.0,1/1/2018,"We received very poor service from our server Oscar. We waited for 20 minutes for him to come, he was in the table in front of us flirting with two young ladies that seemed very uncomfortable with his solicitation of their personal information.  When he finally came to get our order he used vulgar unprofessional language. He referred to my father as ""yo what you want old man."" And to me ""what about you ma?"". We requested a different  server. A manager came and assured we would be taken care of. This didn't stop Oscar from making us feel uncomfortable. As we waited for our food he walked by and made various  comments, ""awkward, why are they here, people run their mouths, ugh,"" and so on.  Our food came in. The last entree came in 25 minutes after the first one: the food was not well cooked. This we understand, busy day. What follows, not so much. We waited for our bill to come and Oscar, sitting with other servers at a table nearby, was yelling ""why are these people here, they should go home."" We paid our bill and for obvious reasons left ZERO tip.  We walk to the elevator and Oscar yells our way, ""They left no damn tip, wow!"". I proceeded to take my daughter outside to see the view from the 8th floor. Then Oscar comes and mockingly yells ""happy new year!"". This made my entire family-- especially my daughter feel very uncomfortable. My father tells him to leave us alone. Oscar runs back to the table with the other servers. I ask for the manager. At this point Oscar gets violent and begins to yell at my father. Servers hold Oscar back.  Once the manager arrives, I demand a refund. Oscar's behavior is unacceptable. The manager assures I will receive a call and takes down my information. While I completely understand that Holidays are extremely busy days and the waiting times and even food quality may be compromised, patrons should not be subjected to harassment. We are regular patrons of this location and the one in Corte Madera and always recommend the restaurant to friends and family, especially people visiting from out of town. We don't feel comfortable coming back though. This experience ruined our New Years Eve dinner.  Already filled out the form on the website. Waiting to hear back from Mr. Kiernan.  Stars for the second server, she was cool."
Dee G.,"Stockton, United States",9,43,45,2.0,26/12/2017,"Im a cheesecake lover but this establishment is not on my fav list. The wait is ridiculous, service is slow and not friendly or attentive. The food was meh!!!  I think they are so busy they just don't take the time to put love into their food. Overall disappointed. Oh yea and service was the worse!"
Arkady G.,"Tujunga, United States",2,28,8,2.0,24/12/2017,"Came on vacation for the holidays, couldn't even enjoy a normal lunch. Food and side items came separately, manager his name is David did not work to help us out to make our stay for lunch better. I do not recommend this location cheesecake factory has great food, asked for this location terrible service and they were not willing to work with"
Cyrena L.,"Fremont, United States",24,5,3,2.0,24/12/2017,"Off the bat, we were seated promptly which was very nice on a holiday (Christmas Eve). It took only 10 minutes for a table of 6 since we got here at 11:00 am However, we were waiting for 25-30 minutes for a server and we decided to ask one of the nearby servers about where our server was and he was very nice and talked to the manager for us. So we waited for another 5 minutes and still there was no show. So we talked to a hostess and she told us she couldn't talk and shooed is away.  So the manager came over and brought another server for us, Josh. The manager explained that our server was stuck at the airport. If your server was not here, shouldn't you know about it and not put people in their section?  When it hit an hour and we still did not have our food in front of us, we talked to a hostess and she was very nice in helping us getting our food, the food arrived in 2 minutes after that.  The server kept running away after finishing whatever he needed at our table. Seemed like he was intimidated by us. We couldn't even ask him for a refill on our drink. The food was good so that's how they still get 2 stars, but was it worth the hour wait? No."
Sierra B.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",0,4,,2.0,17/12/2017,"If you know me you know I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory & part of the experience is waiting which I'm always mentally prepared for considering it's my favorite! But this location was just so so poorly thought out. Anyone knows that the Cheesecake Factory is always busy so WHY would the SAN FRANCISCO LOCATION be the smallest one I've ever been to?! San Francisco is huge with so many people in and out daily, ALL year round. The Cheesecake Factory for a city like this, knowing how busy they are, should literally be several floors. I say this with more than my own experience in mind. The design of their location is seriously hurting their business. Not to mention it's also the top the floor of a Macy's, which is bound to be small anyways. Just poor planning on their part. I would probably go again simply because I love the good but with mental preparation because it's just a complete shit show."
Piper W.,"San Francisco, United States",2,331,55,2.0,11/12/2017,"I used to really like the Cheesecake Factory (several years ago) but it's just not as good as it once was. If you like huge portions and upscale diner food you can enjoy this place. The fries are horrible here. The good thing is this place has a huge menu (pages and pages) so everyone can find something they want. From salads and sandwiches to burgers, pasta, chicken and steak dishes. Tons of appetizers and small plates and of course, the HUGE cheesecake menu with delicious and slices are smaller than they used to be. There is outdoor heated seating with views of Union Square. Expect a pretty long wait and they don't take ressies. My tip? Stick to the appetizers. Everything is just not good."
