Shoua K.,"San Francisco, United States",17,14,,5.0,13/3/2014,"Wonderful location in union square above macys and the view from the outside patio is nice. The service is nice, portions are big, and pricing is reasonable. The brûlée French toast is amazing and the chocolate cake is delicious. I would definitely go back."
Orla L.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",83,173,245,5.0,7/3/2014,"It's getting a 5. I wish I could write loads more reviews to bump this up rating.  Please please please come to Ireland. We all love it when we go to the states. I don't care that it's a chain. Everything I have ever had there is just amazing. The salads are even so tasty. So much choice and at such a great price in comparison to other restaurants, it's a winner in my book."
Janelle P.,"San Francisco, United States",101,9,8,5.0,4/3/2014,"Came here with my husband and our 10 month old daughter to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. Waited no more than 20 minutes to get seated (it was around 4pm, so we got there before the dinner rush). The hostess was very accommodating since we had our daughter in a stroller/car seat. We ordered calamari, herb-crusted salmon w/mashed potatoes and asparagus, fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken, banana cream cheesecake and white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. All the food was fantastic!!! And we received excellent service!!!"

Kendall M.,"Costa Mesa, United States",5,17,1,5.0,19/2/2014,"This place is just fabulous. The location is fun, above Macy's in the square, great to people watch and you can be served outside on the patio. The service is great, the sweets...... Omg.... Delicious. The prices are surprisingly reasonable and all in all, this is a really fun place. We love it."
Bobby C.,"Koreatown, Manhattan, United States",38,112,52,5.0,15/2/2014,"One of my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations that I have been to! Pretty much everything is good on their menu! I've never had dish which I didn't like! My favorites are the complimentary wheat bread, the BBQ Salmon, and Chicken Bellagio! All their pastas are amazing as well! Awesome locations and awesome ambiance and environment inside!"
Lea T.,"San Francisco, United States",24,214,24,5.0,29/1/2014,I love this place!  I like to shop alone when I have some serious purchasing to do and this is the perfect place to take a break and have lunch.  You can sit at the bar without getting bored because you can chat with your neighbor or the friendly bartenders.  There is usually no wait because most people eventually end up at a table.  I also love there drinks - there's nothing bad on the menu.  Mmmmm.
Stevie D.,"San Francisco, United States",41,99,,5.0,16/1/2014,"See, this is why chain restaurants persist despite the chagrin of many who raise their snooty noses at those who enjoy them (and yes, life-long locals like me love Union Square and chain restaurants--when they're good--despite what townies may tell); The Cheesecake Factory SF offered some excellent service, gave delicious food, and while the prices weren't the greatest, they were relatively cheap for the portion sizes and the amazing view from the 8th floor veranda. I ordered the chicken N' Biscuits, but as soon as I found out it was a broiled chicken cutlet rather than a traditional fried piece, I asked for the change and they did it with a smile, and no argument!  Service was courteous, friendly and kind. Just remember, this place has huge portions and heavy calories, it's not the place for a diet (but then again, you already knew that didn't you)! P.S: The cheesecake really is as good as they say it is."
Sapphire C.,"San Francisco, United States",2,14,9,5.0,6/11/2013,"The only cheesecake place for me!. I love their cheesecake selections. Waiters are awesome they always check on you service is always good.  This location in Union Square is my favorite, everytime I come here in downtown SF I always come to this Cheesecake factory location after a long shopping... This is a nice place to hang out with your friends have some delicious cheesecake and coffee..hmmm yummy! my favorite among their cheesecakes are Dulce de Leche and Red Velvet!. It sweet but not too sweet just right... It is also nice to come here during December,  Christmas season, and eat at the balcony get the view of the Union square and you will see the huge Christmas tree and ice skating rink.. just make sure you bring a thick jacket.. it is always cold in SF much more during December.."
Kimmy F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,5.0,28/10/2013,"The service is great. The food is even better! It's a place that me n my friends all love! Went there this evening. Had steak Diane and BANG-BANG chicken n shrimp that the waitress, Jen, sugguested. Both of them were really good! I will definitely order them again next time!"
Tatiana R.,"San Mateo, United States",5,15,2,5.0,24/10/2013,"I love eating delicious food and I am crazy about different kinds of cheese. While shopping in Macy's I decided to have some rest, drink a cup of coffee and  have my favourite cheesecake. I was impressed by a wonderful view which I could enjoy sitting on the terrace of Cheesecake Factory. Although it was crowded the service was good and quite professional. Then my friends and I went there in the evening to have some salads and we were not disappointed. I think it is a nice place where you can try a lot of tasty dishes and have a beautiful panoramic view ."
Austin P.,"San Francisco, United States",53,48,2,5.0,20/10/2013,"Received excellent service from a server, Marie P. It is always nice to be an SF local and come to a spot where you can watch your server do an awesome job serving annoying tourists and still make you feel welcome. Three stars for the food, one extra star for my yummy Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, and the fifth star for my attentive server!"
Ryan H.,"Kannapolis, United States",12,92,24,5.0,3/10/2013,"Beautiful location atop Macy's in Union Square. Ask for a seat outside and you get a gorgeous view of the city. Apart from that, it is the delicious Cheesecake Factory we all love."
Nina W.,"Walnut Creek, United States",24,6,6,5.0,16/9/2013,"So good as always, although we had to wait 20 min while there were tables free, it shows they didnt have enough waiters or waitress. Asian chicken salad was awesome but u should ask for much more dressing. slider was so good too, it is in appetizers, but that is a big dish."

Kevin L.,"San Francisco, United States",24,2,,5.0,20/7/2013,"I come here all the time with my friend and it never disappoints. The wait can get long depending on the time you arrive. The burgers are delicious, but you have to keep room for the cheesecake.  I have yet to try all of them."
Sinan M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,7,,5.0,26/6/2013,"Great food, can eat outside, reasonably priced"
