John B.,"Antelope, United States",59,4,2,2.0,9/12/2017,"Not the best experience for a vegan. There are three vegans in our family. Two of us ordered the vegan Cobb salad and it was pretty good and very large. Our daughter ordered the veggie burger and we made sure to tell the waiter ""vegan"" instead. It came with mayonnaise under the lettuce which wasn't noticed until two bites were taken. That's not the big issue we had. After they took it away they brought back the same burger with a new top bun only. The burger was cold and partially eaten. Not what we expected at all!"
M L.,"Orange County, United States",173,112,152,2.0,25/10/2017,"I actually really like Cheesecake Factory restaurants... been going since high school when they first opened up in Vegas. You always know what you're going to get. Unfortunately this location was super disappointing. Not only was I put on hold to even place my to-go order, they never picked up! So I walked over there from my hotel and waited. Just got an orange chicken which I've gotten many many times. The place was a mad house. People everywhere, no order amongst the chaos and it was so warm in there. My food didn't take too long but it ended up being super dry, over cooked and lacking that nice orange flavored sauce. Didn't taste like orange at all. I guess I really didn't know what I was getting at this location. Boooo."
Mark G.,"Tempe, United States",0,53,4,2.0,5/10/2017,"I consider myself a frequent visitor to The Cheesecake Factory, various locations. This would be my first visit to the Chandler Fashion Valley location.  As soon as we were seated, our assigned waitress rushed over to get our drink orders but failed to smile or even welcome us to the restaurant. Two short minutes later, she returned with two cups of water and admitted that she forgot what drinks were ordered. I repeated the drink order and she franticly rushed away. I saw a manager walking by and stopped her to request that we be assigned a new waitress only because I wasn't in the mood for a bad service that evening. The manager acted shocked and stated that the waitress serving us was her best. I was truly tempted to leave when I heard that only because the waitress was clearly not the best! The manager quickly assigned a new waiter to our table and he did everything possible to make sure we were satisfied. It is for only that reason alone I gave this location 2 stars. Other issues that were experienced were that the service was extremely slow, my daughters meal was never put into the order and the kitchen came out to apologize, and it nearly took 20 minutes just to pay the bill. Every Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, the wait staff have been top-notch. This locations servers seemed to belong to a McDonalds, not a Cheesecake Factory."
Bon B.,"Oakland, United States",4,48,,2.0,3/10/2017,"Horrible food.  Horrible service.  Franchise restaurants are not good.  Our waiter came and asked what we wanted to drink. His whole demeanor was do direct and rude.   He later came and plopped his elbows on our table and asked what we wanted to eat. He didn't write anything down. Nor did he ask if we were here to celebrate, which we were, for a bday.  Later he comes back and introduced our real waiter, who had been on break. Thank goodness!  But our waiter never came around. It wasn't a busy evening. But we sat there for ten minutes waiting for him to walk by so that we could get our bill.  Maybe he sensed our dissatisfaction with the entire place bc he didn't offer us the dessert menu.  I could not wait to leave. But I had to wait because I had to wait for the waiter so I could ask for the check. I got a bonus too....a hard piece of string(????) in the mashed potato that came with the herb crusted salmon that wasn't even fresh. Didn't bother boxing up the leftovers.  Yuck."
Joe T.,"Temecula, United States",0,465,44,2.0,16/9/2017,"After not being able to find parking at the breakfast joint we wanted to try, we walked from the parking garage near Union Square and remembered that Cheesecake Factory does brunch on the weekends, so we figured what the heck.  Per the waitresses suggestion, I tried the chilaquiles with pork.  Not sure why I did this.... chilaquiles at CF?  Yeah, I know, I should have known better.  They were terrible.  More of a breakfast nachos than a chilaquile.  And there were about two tablespoons of pork fat on top, no pulled pork to be found.  It was so bad that I complained and sent it back.  They took it off of the bill.  My wife had the breakfast sandwich which she said was just alright, the brioche bread was a little dry. I will say that I did see some other good looking food options going out, lots of good looking french toast, pancakes and eggs benedict.  And, for SF their pricing is very reasonable compared to other places.  Just wish we would have tried other options.  Chilaquiles at CF, HA!  My fault I guess."
Sonya T.,"Millbrae, United States",52,50,9,2.0,5/8/2017,We were seating outside and it took 3min for waiter to bring menu and 5min to ask for drinks and 35min to cone and ask for food!!! This is ridiculous they dont pay attention to cusomers sitting outside! Of course the food was delicious but never going back there. The service is very bad. We asked 3 different waiters to wait on us and that we are ready to order but no one cared to take our order
Anil R.,"Oakland, United States",59,63,7,2.0,4/8/2017,"The cheesecake club was going up on a Tuesday night at before 8pm.  Service: took too long to greet us. Apps came out timely, entree took almost an hour.  Finally brought entree and chicken was cold. Biggest pet peeve. Manager came out and gave a half hearted excuse. Anyways great portions as always but didn't have an appetite to eat anymore.  I see why the ratings are low."
B R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,2.0,21/7/2017,"We decided to go to CheeseCake Factory because it is one of the most attractive places here in San Francisco. Without a doubt, the views and the extensive menu are worth it. The problem with this restaurant is that you always have to wait a long time to be able to eat or diner, and that's what happened to us. After waiting 20 minutes we were called to take a table and once there there was no available table. We had to wait 10 more minutes for another table and as we were many people we were seated at a large table but it was not round. We finally enjoyed the food and of course the delicious cakes, although the table was not the best."
Ryan M.,"Cameron Park, United States",11,155,62,2.0,17/7/2017,The two stars are for the restaurant being on the seventh floor of the Macy's building and the outstanding patio views. The lack of any more stars is solely due to poor customer service. We were seated on the patio and not visited by our waitress for about 10 minutes. It was 90° and we were not offered water. We received water after we received our beverage order which was 10 minutes too late. Our waitress end up having a little bit of an attitude so we requested to speak to the manager. Sergio was very attentive and apologetic even offering us free dessert.  However I'm afraid he missed the mark. Dining is all about service. I will say he did circle back with us later to see how our meal was (my pineapple chicken dish was dry and my ladies rigatoni was not very tasty). That said we did turn down a free dessert in an effort to just leave. What a restaurant as big and busy as the cheesecake factory does not realize is they will not see us as a customer again.   There was also a customer at the table across from us who ended up leaving because he had to wait too long to get a drink and food order in.  This lunch experience did put a slight damper on our day in San Francisco.
JRolando M.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, United States",1,20,1,2.0,15/7/2017,"We requested a table outside and we were told there was a 30 minute wait. However, we ended up waiting an hour. We were seated in a table where the heater wasn't working and it was chilly that night. We received our main dish after our appetizers only to realize it was for the wrong table. We then had to wait 30 minutes for our food to come out. We spent 3 hours at this place trying to have dinner! This was my second time here. I don't think I'll return for a third time."
K F.,"Detroit, United States",0,83,,2.0,11/7/2017,"Food: The food was good and there is a wide selection. Rating: Four stars Service: The service was slow, half-hearted, and unattentive. Rating: One star Atmosphere: The silverware and glasses had some residue.  The atmosphere depends on where you are seated.  In the rear, the restaurant is mainly functional.  Overall, this location was underwhelming. Rating: Two stars Location: The downtown location is great for people visiting Union Square. Rating: Four stars"
Shannon M.,"New Lothrop, United States",54,5,,2.0,11/7/2017,"First of all, I love Cheesecake Factory. I wanted nothing more than to celebrate my birthday with Cheesecake Factory and the beautiful San Francisco view. We walked up, told we had a 20 minute wait. Over an hour later, we asked the hostess about the wait, was seated right after. It took 10 minutes for a waiter to come over, forgot our appetizer order, the bathroom was an absolute disaster, the baby changing table was broke, they didn't have 2 of the meals we ordered. I frequent the Novi, MI location and I will now continue. Very disappointing."
Sharron G.,"Scottsdale, United States",33,170,10,2.0,5/7/2017,"Stopped in simply because we wanted to have dessert for dinner. Cheesecake is always a good choice and we happened to pass it, so stopped in. The cheesecake was exactly as I remembered it - tasty. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. As we're sitting their waiting for our cheesecake, we're looking around and remembering why we aren't huge fans. They seat too many tables for one waiter. None of the vacant tables I saw had complete place settings. We were sitting at a 4-top, two of the seats had a full place setting, minus the napkins and included dirty appetizer-sized plates. The other two place settings included dirty app-sized plates and a fork and a spoon, and those two settings had napkins.  Decor.... seriously, I think that I've been to four different Cheesecake Factories and they all had the same decor. And we're talking YEARS in between the visits, my last one was in Scottsdale a couple of years ago. Before that was on the east coast easily 10+ years ago. I've never understood the decor. It's. Just. Boring. Sure, they have terrific cheesecake. Go there for the cheesecake. Tip your waiter well if that's all you get. In most of these towns there are TONS of places with fantastic food..... try one of them for lunch/dinner instead."
Gabryella S.,"Miami Beach, United States",12,6,6,2.0,3/7/2017,"Service is terrible and extremely slow. Staff is rude and not prepared to solve a simple customer request that goes out of the planned. Get a seat inside, because outside is cold and windy - and you might get a visit from a nasty pigeon on your table."
Marie J.,"Stege, Denmark",13,1,,2.0,17/6/2017,"I have mix feelings about this place. We Went to dinner here last Night and it was Amazing. The waiter was sweet ( the Best service i have ever experience) and the food was fantastisk. So A 5 Star experience. But today it was A totally difference experience. The waiter was really rude. He Said and i quote "" you look Like you are 12"". That comment made me really sad so my boyfriend and i left the restaurant before we got our food. (So A 1 Star experience)"
Kevin C.,"San Francisco, United States",170,1,,2.0,16/6/2017,"Never coming back. Waited over an hour and a half during un-busy hours, tables empty beside us, noticeably slow hours, for undercooked meatballs and hard rice.  When our entrees came to the table, the plates were noticeably hotter than the food. The rice was no longer even warm, room temperature at best, and the pasta we ordered was barely warm. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because of the kind waiter who actually gave an effort to make us feel welcome and help us enjoy our visit."
Dawn R.,"Antioch, United States",1,12,1,2.0,7/6/2017,The worst service ever. They tell you 25 mins when the wait is an hour and there are empty seats. Would have given them one star but the cheesecake is good
Andrew N.,"Mukilteo, United States",1,13,61,2.0,8/5/2017,Rated a two stars tonight because as a well established restaurant they should not run out of soda. We were also not notified that our Tiramisu cheesecake was sold out until everyone's deserts were already served.
Ivy E.,"Oceanside, United States",1,15,14,2.0,8/5/2017,Food took so long to come out and we only ordered desserts. Our drinks also took forever!
Florendo R.,"Brentwood, United States",8,12,,2.0,1/5/2017,Terrible customer service. Waited almost an hour on the phone trying to place an order. Finally gave up
