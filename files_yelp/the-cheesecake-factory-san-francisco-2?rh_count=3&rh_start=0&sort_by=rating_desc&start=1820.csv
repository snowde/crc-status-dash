Michelle Manu Z.,"San Mateo, United States",13,152,533,2.0,26/4/2017,"Amazing cheesecake, absolutely tasty and delicious...but next time I will stick with it and bring it home.  Unfortunately the service was unbelievably slow. It took over 25 minuets to be seated, other good 15 minutes just to place the order and forever to finally receive the food! By the way, one of the forks that we found on the table was very dirty, some crusted food on it. Food was just not meeting our expectations: Fish and chips was totally bland, pizza was salty and super hard ( I'm sure it was re-heated at least once) chicken sandwich was dry and the amount of chicken inside was ridiculously small... Thumbs up for their burrito which was just ok and the mushroom burger, pretty tasty. Said that, considering the price of the food (in my opinion overpriced for what you get) and the terrible service,we absolutely will not ever eat here again. Still, let me say that their cheesecake is always super good, no matter which one you order, you will never be disappointed."
Luis P.,"San Francisco, United States",236,109,7,2.0,22/4/2017,"I mean, cheesecake factory is an assembly line ""upscale"" casual dinning restaurant, right? Well, you may need to remind the staff and patrons here. I guess the line out the door gets the the staff's head because they treat you like cattle here. There is no personality and the service is painstakingly slow. Do yourself a favor and try one of the many delicious local restaurants within a five minute walk. You will thank yourself for passing on this one."
Joe C.,"San Mateo, United States",0,15,,2.0,18/3/2017,"Loved the location and the ambiance.   Also the food was Excellent, however, i couldn't bring myself to give more than 2 stars after the horrible customer service i received. Our server was ok.  He was friendly and courteous but it took very long to get our orders once we were seated.  Also, he was inatentive as he only came by once to see how we were doing and never refilled our cups of water until the end of our meal. Finally he  seemed unfamiliar with the menu since he had to go ask about certain items we ordered a few times. But the true let down was from the poor customer service i received over the phone trying to contact the manager.  I had left my debit card on the table, so in an attempt to retrieve it right away, i called the restaurant to inquire if anyone had turned it in.  The young lafy informed me she had to transfer me to the manager and put me on hold.  I was literally on hold for 25 minutes before my wife decided to call.  She was put on hold as well for another 10 minutes!  Finally a manager picked up,  we gave him our infomation and, 2 minutes, later he told us that nothing had been turned in.  Seriously?   He never even asked us our servers name!  He then went on to suggest we call back in the morning to check again.   I called again this morning and was placed on hold again.  After another 10 minutes of being on hold, it was just easier to hang up and cancel my card.  Thanks for the help guys!"
April G.,"San Jose, United States",94,9,10,2.0,27/2/2017,"2 star because of what I found after I took my left overs home. The waiter was awesome, made sure me and my mom had everything we needed.  But when I was eating my left over fettuccine alfredo at home, I found a long piece of plastic along with my noodles. I thought it was an uncooked piece at first, but the texture gave it away..."
David A.,"Buford, United States",122,167,156,2.0,20/2/2017,"First off know that I dislike chains, but am willing to accept when there is one my wife very much likes, for example the Cheesecake factory. We frequent the Pleasanton location and have been to San Mateo as well as other ones in the US like Austin, TX.  This particular location is packed and disorganized. That can be expected from a tourist trap, but couple it with the poor taste of their drinks and it is not a winning combination. Same drink as other locations, not as good.  And let's get into prices: this location despite their poorer quality had higher prices than San Mateo or Pleasanton! The prices are even higher than that compared to the Austin location even though the Austin, TX location has Texas sized portions!"
Sam T.,"San Francisco, United States",6,97,13,2.0,18/2/2017,"I noticed how the employees packaging the cheesecake slices wore the same gloves to do everything, including refilling coffee for customers after the customers touched the cups and the arms of the cups, which is gross. I noticed them use a cake cutter or something of the sort to get the cheesecake slices, but their hands with the dirty gloves would still touch the cheesecake. I saw a slice of cheesecake fall on the ground, and after picking it up from the ground and the gloves touching the ground, she still didn't change her gloves and proceeded to fill up coffee and package cheesecake slices. It was a long wait for the slices that I ordered, so while I was waiting I saw this, and I felt grossed up. Unfortunately I know that this is common with most restaurants and eateries, but it shouldn't! I just didn't know what The Cheesecake Factory was one of those places! I hope that they see this and fix the problem! Gloves should be changed every time you handle a different task in order to avoid cross contamination; I've gotten sick from eating contaminated food and this is avoidable."
Bob M.,"Central San Jose, San Jose, United States",0,80,23,2.0,13/2/2017,"I ordered one of the most expensive dishes, the fillet mignon. I have eaten better steaks at other cheesecake factory locations."
Jhygs P.,"Sunnyvale, United States",7,8,21,2.0,7/2/2017,"Went to see my best friend in college who works for an Int'l airline and was in SF for an overnight crew lay over. Took her here to grab some dinner and to do some catching up. She had a glass of Zin & I had a glass of Sangria - this sangria is the most bland of all the sangrias I ever tasted my whole life, what ever amount of dollars I got charged for it, for sure wasn't worth it. We ordered fish taco, turkey/avocado sandwich  & sweet potato fries which tasted plain, zero yumm factor, honest. For desert, we had lattes & a piece of caramel cheesecake to share, I must say that my individually wrapped instant coffee taste 100% better than their coffee, but of course needless to say that the cheesecake was super good. My bill came up to $79.00 plus 18% tip because our server was very nice. Why 2 stars? Well, it's for employee's dishonesty and lack of integrity. I dropped my Gucci glass case that night and did not noticed it until the next day, I called to ask if they have it in their lost & found but the person I talked to said that they don't have it. I asked to speak to the day time manager but the guy wasn't sure or  have no any idea if they have a lost and found area or not. Just frustrating, it was just a glass case people, c'mon!"
Andy W.,"Piedmont, Oakland, United States",2,31,,2.0,26/1/2017,"If you want large quantities of mediocre food that arrives at a snail's pace but is served by friendly waiters, this is your place. We ordered four appetizers for our group.  Edamame - fairly tasteless.  Spinach dip - no taste.  Ahi Tartare - about a tablespoon of tasteless ahi on a mound of boring guacamole.  Only the portabella/avocado/zucchini fries were good. Main courses - hamburger and fries were quite good, ""skinnylicious"" Asian chicken salad had no taste.  I took most of it home and doctored it with soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil, sweetener and rice vinegar, and it was good. It took almost half an hour to get the appetizers, and quite a while after that for the main courses.  The waiters were very friendly, though, and we gave them a good tip because they were not responsible for the quality of the food. With the hundreds of good restaurants in the downtown area, I can't imagine going to the Cheesecake Factory unless you're a tourist who is afraid to experiment for the sake of a good meal.  However, if you insist on going, get a beer, a burger and fries, and cheesecake.  They appear to be the only safe choices. P.S. When you have about a hundred items on your menu, it's a pretty safe bet that you can't do all of them - or maybe even most of them - well."
Bonny P.,"Perkinston, United States",1,30,1,2.0,23/1/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory's all over and usually are pleased with them. This one doesn't get my best review because of a couple of issues. First portion size. I ordered the Ahi Tartar and it was really pitiful. There was 2"" of avocado, less than 1/2"" of tuna and almost no sauce. I did ask for extra won tons and they came, but dang the dish itself was pitifully skimpy. Then on to the burger. Big bun, a piece of meat that barely covered half of it. Either downsize the bun or upsize the meat. And apparently the chef doesn't know medium because the meat was woefully undercooked. I ordered plain tonic water, I got a gin and tonic. No bread until the middle of the meal. Our waitress really tried but there was a real language barrier. Thumbs down to this Cheesecake Factory."
Joshua M.,"San Francisco, United States",161,407,1538,2.0,12/1/2017,"On the upper floor of the SF downtown Macy's lies The Cheesecake Factory. Being in such a prime location, the wait can be especially long during peak hours. I've come here twice or so over the previous year and have found it to be rather mediocre overall.  The service was not great, but not terribly bad as well. The food however always ends up being especially bland despite its nice and flavorful appearance. Their fried appetizers are somewhat decent with good heat and crisp, but their pasta tends to be overcooked such that there is a lack of firmness. I've tried another Cheesecake Factory branch in the past and find this establishment to be quite lacking in food quality compared to it. The cheesecake here is quite disappointing as well with it being a mush that tastes of cream and sugar without much substance and depth of flavor. The main positive of this restaurant has to be its location though. If you're able to get an outdoor seat for lunch on a nice sunny day in SF then you'll be treated to a wonderful view of union square though more often or not, there's going to be construction going on."
La G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,14,5,2.0,4/1/2017,"Came here on NYD. Waited 1.5 hr, was seated, sever forgot to place our order in their POS system, came back 15 min later and asked for our order again, never came back to ask if we needed anything. At least the food was good."
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, United States",2152,1759,2038,2.0,31/12/2016,"Service was horrible. Food was just okay. Not commensurate with other Cheesecake spots we've been to. I suggest going to the bar or ordering something from their appetizer menu, the rest is hit or miss. The restaurant is nice and on the top floor. It was too cold to sit outside but I would image it to be a nice experience when the weather permits."
Matt G.,"Stockton, United States",0,1,,2.0,26/12/2016,"My experience at the Cheesecake Factory was quite unsatisfactory I waited 2 1/2 hours to gain entry and about 30 min to receive my food.all of my friends received their food about 20 min before me,I had to wait much longer the only reason I'm giving the star is for the customer service we had a great waitress"
Maurice D.,"Brentwood, United States",173,50,61,2.0,23/12/2016,"Sorry Cheesecake but today wasn't your day. Our food was hard, stale and even missing things.  Our experience was far below good. Beware of the awesome rooftop view seating....... the pigeons will get the best of you."
Jackie A.,"Oakland, United States",29,19,65,2.0,13/12/2016,"First of all, I LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but my experience at THIS location was horrible. Came here less than two weeks ago. The only good part was that we got seated in less than two mins . Our server sucked . He had no type of personality or Anything. He was just there . Ordered a bottle of wine & it took him 30 mins to bring it. He said the bartender was backed up. It's a bottle, not a cocktail. Can't you just go grab it?  Anyways, my wine glass was dirty , and I didn't notice the big sticky stain on it, until after I poured my drink In it. I told him about it. And all he said was ""oh"" oh??? Don't you mean sorry? You brought me a dirty glass. anyways, I also got food poisoning . Horrible ."
Kim K.,"Santa Monica, United States",0,22,,2.0,4/12/2016,"Only wanted a relaxing Sunday Brunch- ordered the crab hash and the dish came full of potatoes and a few strands of crab for $15. I would gladly pay $50 for a quality crab dish. I Felt it was not justified and asked to speak to the manager for feedback. They sent the manager Mariah who only walked over with an air of arrogance and attitude,  offered no apology or explanation. Her attitude ""too bad that's how we do it"". She has poor customer service relation skills and needs An attitude adjustment. She Should not be in a management position if this is how she handles a simple situation.  I appreciated the kitchen manager who was in charge of the whole restaurant. He was gracious and humble. He explained that they measured the portion. If this is the case then people should know that the $15 crab dish they ordered is really just potatoes. It really came down to how a person in management addresses customers. We also appreciated our waitress. Overall we would not return."
Amir G.,"Philadelphia, United States",2,2,10,2.0,30/11/2016,The service is not like other cheesecake factories I got a pork chop which i can say is among top 10 worst of my life!
Isha G.,"Daly City, United States",0,9,2,2.0,29/11/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat, I'm working in Macy's for the holidays and since I have a 30 minute lunch break, I thought why not order for pick up to make it quick and easy. I went to pick up my food and they sent me off and when I opened my bag, they didn't put my $8 cheesecake in my bag. Wtf. So I have to walk all the way back to the 7th floor to get my cheesecake. By the time I get it, all I have is 10 minutes to eat my food and get back to work, and all the said was ""hold on a sec, we're sorry."""
Chef Shareef P.,"Vallejo, United States",60,19,54,2.0,26/11/2016,Me and the wife anniversary. I have never been to Cheesecake Factory so I was really interested. In trying it heard a lot of good things. But we picked a bad night to come two days after thanksgiving. Really really busy 2 hour and 45 minute wait busy. W get the appetizers the crab bites and the ahi tuna tartare  Blue crab bites were really delicious a lot like crab  The Ahi tuna tartare on the other hand was mostly avocado how are you going to have a tuna tartare with mostly avocado I think that is sad and definitely not worth the price  We both border strawberry lemonade mine was entirely too sweet and hers was entirely too bitter  For our entrees my wife ordered the bang bang shrimp and chicken and I ordered the Hibachi steak with Wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus My wife's dish was too sweet not in enough spicy could have went to Panda Express and order something better than this for way cheaper May I ask for my steak to be cooked medium and it came out medium well I did not make a fuss seeing how we have just waited so long and I did not want to ruin our anniversary night we both order two pieces of Cheesecake to go which we intend on meeting tonight in the bed over a nice fat blunt
