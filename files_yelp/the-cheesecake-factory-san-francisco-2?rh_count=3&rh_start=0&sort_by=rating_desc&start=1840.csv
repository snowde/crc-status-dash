Elizabeth O.,"Burbank, United States",0,14,,2.0,14/11/2016,"Smells like a dirty dish towel- the cheesecake is great, but not really worth the wait. Portions are big yet everything is over seasoned"
Bethtina W.,"Oakland, United States",319,152,65,2.0,6/11/2016,"The food has tremendously gone to hell. It used be a good spot, but they cut so many corners now that the food is crap. We paid six extra dollars for chicken on the garlic noodles. We got one party wing. We ordered a salad with blueberries and they were so soggy that they were unrecognizable. Further, I'm pretty sure broccoli is supposed to be green.  I'm updating my review. I was still in the restaurant when I wrote the first part. Though our server was pretty rude in telling us that broccoli comes that way, a manager, Chris actually agreed the broccoli wasn't right and took it off the bill.  We did have some potato tot sort of thing, that was fried, but good. Overall, stick with the easy things."
Cat A.,"Los Angeles, United States",94,29,,2.0,11/10/2016,"As a loyal costumer and fan of cheescake factory I think yesterday's lunch was pretty disappointing. We order the white chicken chili and they brought another completely diferent dish, we tell the our server and they bring another wrong dish! After 3 times we finally got our chilli! Also, we order another dish with a side of mushed potatoes and they weren't even mushed! It was like a huge entire and hard potato in there. So sad to leave this kinda review in one of my favorite places"
Paul L.,"San Francisco, United States",36,11,,2.0,5/10/2016,They buzz you just to let you know that you have to wait some more. Total tourist trap. Go to burger bar instead.
Esmeralda P.,"San Francisco, United States",52,8,7,2.0,29/9/2016,"First time here and I was excited until we were seated. The hostess was not very friendly, we waited over 20min just to get our water and bread. We asked to sit at a specific table and told it was broken, yet they seated someone there not long after. I was very disappointed. Pros: Friendly waiters and nice view. However, I do not think I will be returning."
Monica Z.,"Concord, United States",0,7,2,2.0,14/9/2016,The wait was kind of long about 45 minutes. Our server was really nice once we got seated. We had a nice view. Once we order the food it also took a long time to come out. When they brought the food to us my dads plate did not come out they said it would be out shortly and we waited. Then the manager came to the table and said that his order had been missed and if he wanted a salad in the meantime. So they brought out a salad and finally he gets his food as we are all pretty close to finishing up.
Martin O.,"Bunratty, Republic of Ireland",12,1,,2.0,11/9/2016,I have eaten in various Cheesecake factories around the US however this was my worst experience to date. My Girlfriend and I arrived at 830 and were told we needed to wait 15 mins at 930 we eventually got our seat. Our waitress who did try to help as much as possible didn't take our order for another 20 mins. At 0950 my girlfriends main course arrived and at 1015 my main arrived. They were the exact same main which was very annoying.. Poor overall experience in this restaurant
Christopher K.,"Alameda, United States",5,53,,2.0,24/8/2016,"I am baffled by this place. Our 13-year-old daughter was keen on going here at the end of a family day out. I'd only heard its name as one more chain and had never thought of going there, but we agreed to try it out. My first impression: crowded, noisy and lame pop music. Waited for a table; the place is unpleasant to be in--really uncomfortably crowded--but we found a good spot on the outside balcony to wait. Nice view (the only real thing this place has going for it). We were lucky enough to be seated outside which was good (except probably for my wife--she was sitting next to a glass wall, with another table on the other side and placed in such a way that she was practically staring another patron in the face from inches away. They should move one of those tables.) It was cool, foggy and breezy outside, but the heat lamps did nicely. When I saw how surprisingly high the prices were, I hoped that it was better than my first impressions had suggested.... I had gumbo, a caesar salad with chicken for the daughter, salmon for my wife and pizza for our son. My wife got a substitution for the potatoes on the salmon plate, but it arrived with potatoes, but missing broccoli. Waiter replaced it. Caesar salad with chicken arrived with no chicken. Waiter fixed it. Wife said salmon was very good. Daughter said some of the chicken was OK, some was way too chewy. My gumbo was OK, but nothing special at all. Probably a little better than a Chili's or similar chain, but completely forgettable, and at a price twice what it was worth. We had some cheesecake, cheesecake and strawberry shortcake. They were all OK. Not memorable at all however.  Dessert made me thirsty, but waiter forgot to fill my water until asked a second time. At the end, we paid at least 50% higher than the food was worth (even for SF), and for marginal service. The really baffling thing is this: The place was packed, with a never-ending stream of people lining up to come in. It was really crowded (and this is late-ish on a Wednesday evening, not a weekend). And many of them looked really psyched to be there. Why? My wife said that most were tourists. But what are they doing here? What made them fly across the country to this city, and walk into a Macys and go up seven floors in an over-crowded elevator for this? Everyone has similar chains back home, right? I'm still shaking my head. Man, i once found a great little falafel place not far from there, got a great lunch special with wonderful lentil soup, etc, for almost nothing. Cost 1/4 the price and twice as good. I wish I could find it again...."
Mary Ann H.,"Millbrae, United States",2,4,8,2.0,21/8/2016,"Presentation was great but our lettuce had dirt and a black bug and our meat ball was raw in the center, we liked what we ordered but got grossed out after seeing that and second attempt of lettuce also had dirt :( but our server was very kind that's why we gave stars."
Andie H.,"San Francisco, United States",102,17,18,2.0,8/8/2016,"I had a fair experience with Cheesecake Factory. Fair in a way that I got what I paid for, yet, I wished that the accommodation was just as consistent. My aunt and I wanted to come here on a whim. Without a reservations, we waited to get line ---only there wasn't any. There wasn't a system they had to call people or to know where to approach when you're without reservation. The lady in charge didn't even take down my aunt's name right, so when we were called, we didn't know it was us. And we waited so long. Luckily the waiter who served us did well. The food had great portions, and the ambience was good. Hopefully, the staff will also be up to par."
Diana V.,"Las Vegas, United States",4,12,2,2.0,5/8/2016,"We've been to many a Cheesecake Factories. The food is very good and consistent. It's the service that varies. My son ordered chicken sliders and they brought hamburger sliders. When I told the waitress, she said""let me see what's in the computer"" as if that would prove something. Another waitress (neither our original) came by and asked us what we wanted. We all finished our meal before my sons correct order came. The attitudes were not what we'd expect at a Cheesecake Factory. Not a great experience even though the food was good."
Jacklyn G.,"Martinez, United States",0,5,,2.0,3/8/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Telling you now, if you're going to pick one, GO TO WALNUT CREEK! First- We waited 35 minutes for our pager to vibrate - pretty normal. SF Cheesecake is always crowded. However, when we went to the front desk, they had us wait to the left of the desk for our name to be called. Mind you, there were about 5 parties in front of us, still waiting to be seated. AFTER our pager had buzzed. Weird system if you ask me. Our table was nice, but the server.  The server seemed very confused and like she did not have a clear knowledge of the menu. She nearly put in an order for the wrong dish, and when my girlfriend asked for recommendations, she couldn't come up with anything. Weird, again. We waited for about 25 minutes for the last and certainly least....  THE FOOD. I ordered the ""Very Spicy"" Cajun jambalaya pasta. THE blandest pasta I've ever had in my entire life. Like, not even a dash of seasoned salt let alone any spice. And, they gave me shrimp only when the dish clearly is labeled as a dish with chicken AND shrimp. I didn't eat any, and ended up bringing it home to recook and season myself. Overall horrible experience in what was supposed to be a fun anniversary trip to the city.  My two stars are there because 1. My girlfriend enjoyed her chicken Madeira. 2. The Reese's Cheesecake was bomb."
Liang N.,"Fremont, United States",15,5,40,2.0,31/7/2016,"Third time came here, the food is just okay , not bad! best thing here is the cheese cake, 2 star for the cakes! But the service here is the worst one I ever been! We asked for help so many times , the waiters crossed by  saw us waved hands, but they just ignored ! We just wanna some more sauce and some more water!Finally, a waiter went to get sauce for my friend , but he came back after half hour , we almost finished! I know the business here is busy , lots of people waiting outside, they are busy, but if the service keep bad , all the customer will never come back again!"
Rhett B.,"San Francisco, United States",626,140,942,2.0,22/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is normally a great place to go for dates and grab a great meal. Now, I must say, my server (Michelle) and the food was BOMB!! It was amazing! I would absolutely go back for the food, BUT, the major reason I ranked the Cheesecake Factory so low is because the wait is ridiculous. The wait is ridiculous, along with the space in which you can wait. There is no room. The amount of people waiting to be seated along with the fact that you can't leave the top floor or you wont hear your name is called is crazy. They have to do better!! It makes everyone irritable!!"
Amy V.,"San Francisco, United States",515,167,47,2.0,30/6/2016,"Long wait even around 5:30pm. They should have came up with a solution by now... If it is always so busy like this... Boo. The chicken quesadillas were not worth it! Instead of putting a bunch of salsa and sour cream on the side, maybe they should've added more quesadillas. They were 4 for $12.50.  The crab and artichoke dip is a must try tho! Buffalo chicken wings were really flavorful tho. I realized I said ""tho"" twice...whatever tho"
MorePeas S.,"Oakland, United States",5,35,,2.0,30/6/2016,"Not great, here's why: - be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for your table and likely double if you come during peak times  - subpar service; the wait staff is too blasé with no notion of customer service. Considering the price point is as high or higher than other area restaurants, I'd  expect the level of service to be commensurate. Took 15 minutes to get water. Our fries came out 10 minutes after we got our burger, no knives or spoons at our table...the list goes on - blah mains; in San Francisco you can easily find higher quality food for the price The only bright spot was the cheesecake. Go there for a slice and save yourself the disappointment that comes with having a full meal."
Shay L.,"Los Angeles, United States",44,4,,2.0,29/6/2016,Don't come here after 10pm  all the everybody wants to go home  and  are not focus with your order and have bench of excuse  get ready for your meal to be late minimum 30 min!!!
Adreinne W.,"Brooklyn, United States",61,5,,2.0,24/6/2016,"The absolute worst Cheesecake Factory that I've ever visited.   The food is sub-par.  I ordered the same dishes that I usually get from the Maryland, New Jersey and Las Vegas locations.  They tasted bland, as if no seasoning.   The only reason to deal with the long wait times and crowds is delicious food.  This location misses the mark."
Robert R.,"San Marcos, United States",0,4,,2.0,20/6/2016,"I'm not one to complain but this last weekend I took my wife on a weekend birthday gate away to San Francisco. She chose to have her birthday dinner at the cheese cake factory since she loves the place, we eat there all the time in SD. I can honestly say this was the worst service I have received from any chain restaurant around. First they had said our wait was about an hour it took 2 hours, second when we got seated the table hadn't been wipe down at all and was sticky with no silverware, third we ordered drinks and got them well after our food arrived, forth I found a rock in my mash potatoes and accidentally chewed on it fifth our appetizer and food for the kids came out after my wife and I had finished our food and was a bit cold. The whole experienced ruined my wife day and both of us ended up with headaches. I will say they did try and make it up by not charging me for my plate and appetizer but still killed the experience for us."
Reno U.,"Mountain House, United States",220,204,820,2.0,10/6/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is on the top floor of the Macy's building in Union Square. I've gone here a few times when we go ice skating across the street and this place never ceases to keep me from laughing.  Mostly because there is always a loooong wait! Union Square is a tourist trap and we always get caught up in it every time we are there! We end up sitting or standing growing more impatient and then...here's the kicker...we always decide to leave!  We know Cheesecake Factory is quality, over-priced food that is always situated in high tourist areas. Why do we try to eat here only to end up on the bottom floor eating at the food court!  I cannot remember ever sitting down and eating here. Just waiting...and waiting...and waiting..."
