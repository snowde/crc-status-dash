Vipul Z.,"San Francisco, United States",32,55,21,2.0,27/5/2016,Not a great place for vegetarians. We had Evelyn pasta which was ok & Veggie burger which was very bland and lacked flavor. Lemonade were also forgetful. Dishes were very costly too. And to top it off we tried two cheesecakes & they were also good but not worth the hype that this place generates. Views from waiting area were amazing. Might not go back again.
Terrance B.,"San Diego, United States",10,6,1,2.0,4/5/2016,"After being in Hawaii and experiencing their restaurant. Quality isn't the same here. The food does not taste as good, we ate the chicken Breast littles and they were so dark they were almost burnt and they were dry. We also had the farfalle which is my favourite and it was dry and not very flavour full.  We ordered two Long Island iced teas each and my partner who gets tipsy on baily's couldn't feel anything. They were making very weak drinks and ripping us off. They were terrible drinks. DONT TRUST THE DRINKS! The Oreo cheesecake was amazing."
Kelly A.,"San Francisco, United States",47,102,30,2.0,22/4/2016,This place sucks but it's a chain restaurant so what do you really expect? Service is bad unless you get the one person that is in a good mood and not overwhelmed by the number of guests assigned to them Food is usually just ok because it is the Cheesecake Factory  They are always busy which is really sad tourists must really honk we have bad food in the us I am not sure why I have been here more than once Service is always slow
Riham B.,"San Francisco, United States",208,124,116,2.0,16/4/2016,"Two stars: One for the beautiful terrace with the excellent view. One because I like the cheesecase factory food.  I have been to SF maybe 5 times, and this time was the first time I was able to get a table at this place. Granted, this is because it's located in a huge Macy's in what is probably the most touristy part of the city, but still, the wait time here is always so crazy. The food is your typical Chessecake Factory food. Massive portions of many many calories. I usually go for the light menu, which is not really that light. If you are used to European portions, then order one main for two people. If you go for a main each and an appetizer, there will be a ton of leftovers. The portions are huge. The service is okay. Nothing too bad and nothing too special."
Suz V.,"Myrtle Beach, United States",0,13,20,2.0,12/4/2016,"30 minute wait anytime you come. Plate was very hot, food was cold?!  Daughter ordered pork chop. Served on top of baked apples. Pork chop absorbed apple flavor, which is nasty, and tough to cut through.  Was it worth the 30 minute wait, heck no! I'm definitely ordering something different, if I return. NOT IMPRESSED! The reason there is a wait is because staff is not attentive. Ordered cheese cake for dessert. It took around 30 minutes to get it?! Took 30 minutes to bring our meal.  They are in no hurry to get you served and on your way, so waiting guests can eat."
Cat N.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,2.0,21/3/2016,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, which can be either pretty yum or pretty blah. This visit was on the blah side. We arrived at this location and received a 'buzzer' at 11:50 am on Saturday, 3/19/16. After our buzzer rang about 10 minutes later (a few minutes earlier than the projected ""15 minute"" wait) we are told to wait nearby for someone to call our name. Suppress that wow-that-was-quick feeling. Watched other couples turn in their buzzers....and get called in to be seated, before us! After the third couple, we check and they say ""oh it says you are seated"" -clearly we are not. We notice this is also happening to another couple and we both get seated - at tables next to each other. Our waitress is prompt to get our drinks after stumbling over her not so well rehearsed script, but since the menu is extensive, we ask for a few minutes to go over it. We see that the couple next to us has placed their food order along with their drinks and promptly receives their order - before our food order is even taken. We wait....another server comes by to check on us and we end up giving him our order of two salads. My daughter's salad comes fairly promptly....mine...takes....a....long...time...and twice I'm told it's because they're making fresh falafel. The other couple leaves.  Eventually it's brought by the manager and it's good. I ask the manager for a slice of cheesecake to go (that was fabulous - dulce de leche!) because I don't want to end up waiting  forever for this too, and she does comp it for the wait, which was not why I asked her but ended up working out.  An hour and 55 minutes from when we entered, we leave - when it should have taken only the 55 minutes."
Joyce C.,"San Francisco, United States",116,75,50,2.0,21/3/2016,"I enjoy coming to this specific Cheesecake Factory location because of the amazing view on the patio although the food isn't all that great. The wait is always at least an hour long but you can kill time shopping. However I've never experienced such terrible service at the CF until yesterday. There is nothing special about the food. Bf and I got the tater tots appetizer, farfalle garlic pasta and the mushroom burger. It wasn't the worst but I had better elsewhere costing us less. We got the red velvet cheesecake which was extremely sweet for us.  When we got seated, we noticed right away that our plates was dirty. We asked our server TWICE for clean plates but she never brought it to us. She also didn't refill our waters and continued to clear our table when we weren't finished with our food. Clearly, there was some food left on our plates but she didn't bother asking for a box and took our plates instead."
Chino Z.,"San Lorenzo, United States",3,18,1,2.0,24/2/2016,"Over the years I've visited my fair share of Cheesecake Factory locations.  For the most part, with just a few exceptions their food is consistent which is so important to me.  If I'm going to eat at a chain I expect the food to be the same every time.  I rate their food 4 stars for consistency, flavor and presentation.  Being a chain restaurant I would definitely say they are one of the better casual dining chains.  Above an Olive Garden, Outback or Claim Jumpers, but definitely not a Ruth's Chris.  I've been most impressed by their ability to get Salmon right every time, never dry.   BUT FOR THIS LOCATION SPECIFICALLY, I couldn't give it 4 starts because of the overall experience.  First, the good stuff... The location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square so pretty damn good location.  They offer outside seating with views of the square.  Considering the overpriced tourist trap restaurants in and around the square, this location is generally in line with the average prices you would see across their different locations.  For being in Union Square, one might even say this place is a ""deal"" all things considered.    However, also being in a prime location means people everywhere.  It is a complete madhouse in there and beyond loud.  I'm already not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory's standby-only policy due to their refusal to accept reservations which is why I rarely dine here.  The front desk and whole waiting area is a disaster.  People standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some people sprawled out on the floor probably due to hunger, dehydration and exhaustion from waiting out this archaic process.  People are pushing on each other, throwing elbows and just lots of general overall rudeness you would expect to get from starving people in a loud, crowded, dimly lit, stuffy room probably resentful knowing that a reservation could have avoided some of this. If you go down the escalator one level there are couches and chairs in Macy's home furnishings department but even those fill up with weary Cheesecake Factory refugees.  Once you are finally selected to be seated, usually 30-45 minutes after the quoted time, you are seated in one of the more cramped dining rooms I've experienced at this chain.  I'm sure at this point people are so exhausted and relived to care much.   While the food and prices were up to par with other Cheesecake Factories across the U.S., I don't think I'll be visiting this location again.  The whole experience takes away from enjoying your food.  And if you're having a good time visiting Union Square, shopping, visiting the City or just having a good day in general I would advise not visiting this location anywhere near a common meal time or it will drain the life out of you and probably kill the great mood you were in."
Lisa L.,"San Leandro, United States",175,132,72,2.0,16/1/2016,"I came here on Christmas Eve with my friends visiting from out of state. Of course it was extremely packed. We arrived around 6pm to get our name on the wait list and we waited about 3 and a half hours until we finally got seated. I understand that on a holiday it can be very hectic but the workers were very disorganized and did not properly communicate to all of those who were waiting. They did not say we could choose to sit at the bar area, so when a family that just came in took the table, we were pretty outraged. They should have let everyone know that there are other seatings available besides the regular inside arrangement. However I will give this place two stars because the food was good and our waiter was very nice."
Bubba Z.,"Newark, United States",2,10,,2.0,11/1/2016,"Cheese""wait"" Factory. They should create a section to accommodate larger groups. Waited more than to 2 hrs. for a table for nine."
Vu N.,"Port Arthur, United States",235,10,2,2.0,6/1/2016,"Do NOT get the Baja chicken tacos. For some reason I really feel like this location has fallen off the reservation. Their food isn't fresh. Their utensils aren't clean. The service is nice, however. Whoever the chef today was should definitely taste his food. The rice is overcooked and their flour tortillas are hard. The charred chicken is absolutely petrifying."
Jennifer S.,"Roseville, United States",641,207,2,2.0,3/1/2016,"Arrived here about 11pm on New Years Day, we were hoping to have a couple drinks in the bar.  The restaurant was pretty crowded inside, we were lucky to find someone leaving in the bar and grabbed their table.  It took several minutes to get the table cleared, after several servers passed us without stopping.  Finally our server arrived, when we asked him for drink recommendations, he said ""I drink beer."" Umm..ok, you're a great help, not!  We ordered a couple drinks and some nachos.  Our service wasn't very good, our server looked uninterested with his job and like he didn't want to be there.  Drinks and food were pretty good, we got a piece of cheesecake on the way out and my boyfriend was in heaven, eating it back in our hotel room."
Fedi A.,"San Francisco, United States",11,33,143,2.0,14/12/2015,Honestly my first time not tipping a server: was I wrong for not leaving a tip?  My experience today at Cheesecake Factory went from a 10 to -1 when the servers switched. We sat in the bar area for lattes and a late lunch. Our first server (did not catch her name but we were there around 3:45pm) was sweet and amazing!!!!!! Then around 5pm she told us her day was over and introduced us to another server (will not mention name). He never checked on us and when we asked for our bill he seemed annoyed. When he brought back our change he overpaid us by $20. I brought it to his attention and he seemed annoyed again rather than thankful. I was surprised by his attitude- would he rather be short?  Corn soup was good; sent back my salmon dish because the lemon sauce tasted like mayo. Manager apologized and said they messed up the ingredients of the sauce by adding too much starch and thanked me for bringing it to their attention. On a positive note the Caramel Latte was delicious! Thank you to the first server!
Ceecee M.,"San Jose, United States",136,195,170,2.0,6/12/2015,"This place is crazy busy!!! We decided to stop by for dessert to wrap up our evening in SF. We were hoping to enjoy the view, but were greeted with a line out the door to see the host. We decided to take our chances with the bar opening seating and got lucky!!  I ordered the strawberry shortbread dessert and was not impressed. It was three large sandwiches with about half a cup of strawberries, three scoops of vanilla ice cream and a mountain of whip cream. The shortbread was not tasty at all. It was overly salty and way too much. The strawberries were glazed with syrup. I honestly do not recommend this dessert. My bae had the mango key lime cheesecake. I had a small bite and it was you would expect from the name.  The crowdedness of this place was almost a little stressful. I'm glad I tried it, but don't need to again."
Kara B.,"Minden, United States",0,6,4,2.0,27/11/2015,Very long wait. They were out of 3 things we ordered. No menu to pick new things when we were told they were out of things. Food came at all different times. If in San Fran go out to any other place.  Long wait over crowded average or less food.
Zara A.,"San Francisco, United States",36,86,38,2.0,27/11/2015,Pretty horrible experience. Waited over 2 hours for a table for 2. I always come to Cheesecake Factory so I know what the food and service normally is like. Ordered steak Diane/chicken Madeira and it was served to me cold. I let the server know and she said that she would 'make me a new one if I was willing to wait' which I was. Waited another 25-30 minutes only to be served the same plate which was placed under the boiler.  Thankfully the management handled this issue.
Katelyn T.,"Whitchurch-Stouffville, Canada",37,403,788,2.0,18/10/2015,"This location is extremely busy and a lot of the staff here are extremely unpleasant.  We came for a late lunch around 3pm and had to wait 20min for a table (which is okay, the wait is expected). When the hostess  took us to our table, the table and chairs were dirty. They didn't clean up the table after the last group. The hostess didn't seem to be in a hurry to help is clean up the table. She disappeared for a while, meanwhile we were standing there waiting for table to be clean.  They finally cleaned the table but did an awful job. Hostess came back with our small plates and utensils to set up the table. Plates were dripping wet so I politely said ""I would prefer some dry plates please"". I got no verbal response back from the hostess; she angrily walked away with the wet plates and utensils. Bathroom is not well maintained. Soap pump didn't have any soap. And garbage is overfilled.  Overall, food quality is the same as anywhere else, however, the ambiance here is terrible. It's so loud much like dining inside a subway train during rush hour, you can't have a proper conversation. Bathroom is not maintained.  You're in union square, I would suggest going elsewhere for food."
Martin J.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,5,,2.0,17/10/2015,"This visit by my wife and I to The Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy's in Union Square was quite a disappointment. Not for the quality of the food but for the cleanliness and attitude of our server. When our wait person finally came to greet us we first needed to request that one of our plates be replaced as we could see it had a green-colored grime residue. As she snatched it away in a surly manner we saw that she was the only server not wearing the black Cheesecake Factory apron. And also that she had grime marks and food stains on the front of her shirt. Her surly, couldn't care less attitude continued throughout our visit making us wait for her attention longer than her other customers. Note, the other staff members that we interacted with were helpful and caring and the food when it arrived was very enjoyable. It's a shame that our server took the shine off the rest of the our experience at The Cheesecake Factory."
Yalun S.,"South San Francisco, United States",128,18,2,2.0,8/10/2015,"The cheesecake is not bad, but the service is really horrible. The waiter was trying his best to kick us out within 30 minutes."
MJ M.,"San Jose, United States",0,12,1,2.0,3/9/2015,"So far, I believed this Cheesecake Factory always had the best customer service. I guess they're lacking in the department now. We were ignored twice by two servers and one Asian server blatantly said ""sorry man I'm not your server"" and walked away. Any person in the right mind will know how unbelievably rude that would be. This is the first time we were ever served with incredibly poor service in this location. Luckily, our server Jonathan was kind enough to see to the problem and offered to talk to a manager."
