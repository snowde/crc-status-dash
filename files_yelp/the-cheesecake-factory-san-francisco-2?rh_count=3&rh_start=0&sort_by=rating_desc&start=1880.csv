David T.,"San Francisco, United States",436,709,5302,2.0,25/8/2015,"I like The Cheesecake Factory chain, but this one is just too mobbed with tourists. The wait is long and the service is rushed. Try any other location than this one for your Cheescake factory fix."
Brenda G.,"Moss Beach, United States",228,25,5,2.0,11/8/2015,"The gentleman named Benaster at the register is terrible. When he confirmed my to go order, it was incorrect. I ordered 2 louisiana chicken pastas with no vegetables. The order was made with no vegetables AND no spices. He huffed and puffed while making me feel how inconvenient it was for him to tell the kitchen to add spices. He also made it a point to mention that ""it was a fill in cashier"" Whenever that means. When my order was ready, he said ""okay you're all set"" ...actually I also ordered a strawberry lemonade. He went to the bar to get it, came back, handed me the lemonade and walked away before I could ask him what his name was. Benaster was rude to the point that i felt offended. I asked another gentleman standing nearby what his name was, he replied ""Band.""  This interaction was still bothering me when I got home, so I called to speak to a manager. Anthony informed me that there was no employee there named Band. I described the young man and he informed me of his real name.  0 stars for the rude service while I was there. 2 stars for Anthony, thanks for taking care of me."
Lauren L.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,9,3,2.0,5/8/2015,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and usually go to the Hillsdale one. I was in San Francisco with my friends today and we decided to try the one here. Problem number one: the wait. It was a Tuesday morning-afternoon so you'd think it wouldn't be so busy, well it was so we had a wait time of 15 minutes. As soon as our buzzer went off, we were told to standby and wait for our waitress to take us to our seat, which lasted about ten minutes. I was confused at this point; why have the buzzer go off only to have us wait even longer? I went up to the desk to ask what we were supposed to be doing, and the girl rudely responded with ""we have a lot of tickets."" I don't know what that means but she could have handled my simple question much more professionally and kindly.  After more minutes of idly standing around, we were finally taken to our seat. Note that there are three people in our party, yet our table only had plates and silverware for two people. I failed to realize this until near the end though, and apparently our waitress never realized it either, even when serving our bread.  My friend had a couple of dollars in quarters that she needed to exchange for some dollars, so when she asked the waitress if she could, the waitress responded quickly with ""you gotta do that at the bakery,"" before she quickly disappeared again. She left my friend confused, we didn't know where the ""bakery"" was since the whole restaurant looked like a bakery.  Next comes ordering. Ordering was fine and our food was good. One of my friends and I got a new batch of water from the waitress, and immediately noticed something was off. Our water was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like tap water mixed with blood, and contained no ice. We asked for a new cup of water, and this time it tasted better, but still had no ice. Next came ordering the cheesecake. I first asked if they were serving the Peppermint Bark one, since our buzzer said ""Peppermint Bark cheesecake is back!"" The waitress responded curtly with ""that's only in the winter."" Feeling a bit disappointed and confused since the peppermint bark flavor was advertised but yet not available, I went with another flavor. Our waitress did not write down what we ordered and memorized it instead. When she brought over our cake, she didn't say a word the whole time and gave each of us our wrong cheesecake. She could have at least asked us who had what instead of slamming them down at our table and have us do the hassle of rearranging of who had what. My friend asked another waitress if she could get a to-go box for the rest of her cake. And the waitress rudely responded with ""it will be one moment,"" never stopping, and kept walking by. Needless to say my friend never got her box, and finally had to ask another waitress for it. We left with mixed feelings. The food was good except for that awful water, but the service was terrible. The waitresses are all rude and stuck up and do not engage with the customers at all. I will be sticking to the one in Hillsdale."
K J.,"Corona, United States",8,22,7,2.0,21/7/2015,"First, let me start by saying I have never had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory, until today. We waited 35 minutes for our table, no problem, we knew that. First waitress was attentive took our order   However when asked about how spicy a dish was, she said ""not at all"" well, it was. Appetizers were awesome as always.  Our waitress went on break.  Two other people brought out the meals, of the 4 entrees, one was very spicy, one very peppery, and the shrimp scampi had battered shrimp which was not explained on the menu. My chicken Madeira was very good (I like to include the positives) We would have told the waitress, but she was AWOL and it took almost 10 minutes to get side refills and that was because we asked another server to tell ours that our drinks were empty.  My husband had to hunt down the manager because our waitress couldn't be found. Ultimately, they took two meals off (the super spicy one got mostly eaten) and gave us two slices of cheesecake. The biggest issue was the amount of time it took to get it taken care of when it should have been a simple fix."
Nisheeth S.,"Ashburn, United States",46,10,,2.0,4/7/2015,"Such poor service. First, they sat us down right under the speakers, which we asked to turn down, and they didn't. As we were sitting down, we had also asked to sit near the window, which they informed us that that section was closed for a half an hour. We took our seats and maybe 5 mins later someone was sitting there! We then ordered lattes, which came out lukewarm in what looked to to be clear water glasses. The Avocado Egg Roll was fantastic as usual though, and the food didn't disappoint. They did screw up the pasta order as well though, so that had to be replaced.  Overall, very amateurish. 2 stars only because server was nice and Avocado rolls."
Wendy F.,"San Francisco, United States",62,247,571,2.0,21/6/2015,"Yup you get the nice view, but 3 hours of waiting?!?! Also very cheap service.  FOOD: My friends and I were going to have dinner here, but we had a 2 hours wait so we decided to have dinner first then come back here for dessert. There were 8 of us and we ordered 1) red velvet, 2) coffee, 3) strawberry shortcake, and 4) mango lemon. I really liked the mango lemon, which had a layer of mango mousse and jam at the top that added a stint of sour sting to the flavor. The others were okay and weren't impressive. It was also my friend's birthday so we asked them for a birthday celebration. In the past the restaurant bring us a special slice of cake with candles. But here they just put a candle on a cheese cake we ordered. How cheap is that?!?!? SERVICE: We made a reservation for 8pm, which was a 2 hour wait. But when we got there, they made us wait another 30-45 minutes. My friend ordered a glass of wine, which took them SO LONG to ""prepare"". You are suppose to drink the wine while eating cheesecake, not after you are done with them!! SETTING: You definitely get a nice view since it's at the top of the Macy's building. But I think the place is overhyped and it is SO CRAMMED with people waiting for their reservation. They seriously need to figure out a better way of organizing.  PRICE: We paid around $35 for everything ($4.50). It was a lot of food and we didn't finish everything, but probably because we were so full from dinner.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: Not coming back. Wait is so freaking long and I can get much better food and service elsewhere in downtown."
Sylvia Y.,"Santa Clara, United States",86,421,772,2.0,5/6/2015,"Definitely a significantly worse experience compared to the last time I came here. This time I came on a Thursday night thinking that I could also be seated almost right away since it was the case last time on a Friday night. Nope, it was about 20 minutes wait, which wasn't too bad I suppose. However, service was unbearably slow. Took 15 minutes for us to just get our water and bread. Another long wait before we got our food. They didn't bring out the salad dressing at the same time as my salad (I asked for it on the side) so i had to wait again. They also forgot to put chicken in my salad. They brought it out eventually but after I had a bite, i wish they hadn't. It was literally the dryest, toughest, most unappetizing chicken ever. It tasted like it had been microwaved, frozen, and then reheated in the microwave again.  The salad itself was probably 2.5/5. Absolutely nothing special and there was only one measly piece of asparagus in there. Talk about false advertising. Overall not a good experience at all. Servers were spilling drinks on diners left and right (thankfully not on me). 1 star for the view and another star for not giving me food poisoning or getting dirty stuff in my food. Most definitely an off day for Cheesecake Factory. I'll think twice about coming back again."
Elsa H.,"San Leandro, United States",14,35,112,2.0,4/6/2015,Came here on Thursday night. Took 30mins to get the artichoke dip. My pasta is cold but the sauce is warm. I guess they were busy because I never got my water refilled. It took forever to get the check. I only came here because of the location....
Medi M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,2,2.0,1/6/2015,Went to Cheesecake Factory on Sunday night and it was surprisingly super busy !! Estimated time was 30min to get a table but we end up by waiting for an hour !!!!! The hostess was nice and apologized for the long wait. Second part was the waitress she was so overwhelmed keep forgetting stuff  The two stars is for the food and the hostess !! Sorry it's my last time
Sandy T.,"San Francisco, United States",303,373,418,2.0,22/5/2015,"Reviewing the cheesecake only. And man it was waaaayyy too sweet. No wonder high school kids rave over this! I only recently came by because we had a voucher to redeem a slice of cheesecake. I never made it out here in my high school days and I must admit, I don't think I was missing out on much. Not in a hurry to come back and to be honest, nor do I really care to."
Chelsea W.,"Cloverdale, United States",6,28,10,2.0,18/5/2015,"If it werent for the quick service , view and having my favorite beer I would be rating this a single star. Ive eaten at the cheesecake factory before, but never this one. My boy friend reccomend it, he has eaten here before and said he did not recall his dinner being this disappointing before. I oredered an IPA (my usual), stuffed mushrooms, pork potstickers and the pasta Da Vinci. I do have to say everything was at a good temperature when served and our server was delightful. We also were seated very promptly. This was surprising considering how busy it usually is. I still feel the bread sticks would of been a better meal then the three course I ordered. the mushrooms were lacking something , but it wasnt the sauce they were in(sauce was BOMB). pot stickers were way to salty to eat more then one and what should of been the best part was far from it. the load of  noodles were very chewy and the sauce was bland. with the amount of noodles in my dish it was like a treasure hunt to find any mushrooms or chicken . i did not get a to go box"
Ind B.,"Pacifica, United States",0,17,,2.0,10/5/2015,"Ok, this restaurant is extremely busy. I took my mother in law for an early dinner on Saturday 5/9. The food is good, the view is good so I would consider as 3-4 stars. The waitress (Jessica) is quite nice , polite and attentive. So I gave her 5 stars. The reason why I put 2 stars was because the bathroom was disgusting! From toilet paper to sanitary napkins were on the floor.. Twice I used their bathrooms and there was no toilet seat cover. The toilet was wet and water was everywhere. Gross!!  I spoke with the front desk regarding the issues but when I came back to use their bathroom the second time, it seemed like the problems were still there. This is now about health and safety issues!! I would like to see the management to have their bathrooms check every 15-30 minutes during peak hours. This is a very busy well established restaurant. I hate to see people slip and fall in the bathroom!!!!"
Kelley Y.,"New York, United States",235,148,169,2.0,8/5/2015,"FOOD: I ordered the shrimp soft tacos from the SKINNYLICIOUS Menu and they were pretty good. I also really liked the pickled vegetables that came with it. Would I get it again? Meh, I don't know. What I really like is the dark brown bread-its delicious !! You can get this at any Cheesecake Factory though. My friend ordered the peach bellini and omg, this is delicious!!! Anyone who likes sweet drinks will love this! SERVICE: SLOW service!!! We asked for bread 3 times and the waitress forgot every time. We also asked if they can turn up the heater and they said no.  TIPS: Honestly, what I love about this one in particular is the view. You get to see Union Square at night and its really beautiful! Yes, it is FREEZING but its still a nice place to eat and view. WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? No, but for the view, Yes."
Lorrie T.,"Daly City, United States",0,81,50,2.0,4/5/2015,"The worst ever! Did not like there service at all felt being rushed to pay and get out of the restaurant, very rude people can't believe actually gave them a tip their professionalism is a zero. Even though I told them not to rush me they still did anyway wish could get my money back. Came here before few times with some people employees were nice but when came back by myself they rush me quite bad service there."
Jordan C.,"Portland, United States",1,3,,2.0,30/4/2015,"I've been a big fan of the CF growing up, however, this experience fell a bit flat. Service was actually satisfactory, but when I took that first bite of fish I knew I was gonna be stopping by ol Long John Silvers on the way home. I will say though the bartender made a pretty mean White Russian. I'll give these guys another shot for sure so hopefully the fish will be better next time."
chanchoy p.,"Oakland, United States",236,33,56,2.0,26/3/2015,"There was a blonde lady that looks like iggy azalea with a annoying attitude tone working the front as a hostess that was clearly not friendly or informative on customer service. She gave me a wait time for a group of 14 for 40-45 mins, in reality it took 60-65 mins to get our table. Our group was split to 3 tables indoor seating with horrible lighting. Luckily our waiter was friendly and attentive to our needs by the name of Orlando you the real MVP. I ordered shrimp scampi and steak. Steak was bland and I requested a medium rare, but it was well done. Mash potatoes was cold."
I. W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,3,2.0,20/3/2015,"The pros: nice view, one can sit outside, the waitress was pleasant, the sundae ice cream was an eye catcher.  The cons: The wait was way too long, the front desk women were rude, that brought the stars one notch down."
Kira G.,"London, United Kingdom",53,114,5,2.0,19/3/2015,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and it was a very short wait, as I was ok with sitting indoors. Food was very average. Sadly I couldn't control myself and was full following the bread that came before the food. Not a good situation to be in when the entrees contain, on average, three-meals-worth of food.  The only one I've tried that I'd go back to is the one in Walnut Creek!"
Michelle C.,"Rio Vista, United States",0,27,1,2.0,17/3/2015,"We have always loved The Cheesecake Factory. We usually go to the Walnut Creek location. Our first impression of the SF location was not so great. We stepped out of the elevator and we're not sure where to go. We walked up to 2 people at what turns out was the bakery. They never even looked at us. We stood there for a couple minutes when a man walked by who was obviously a manager or something, by the way he was dressed and giving directions.  He also walked by us. No eye contact. We eventually realized where we should be on our own. Call us stupid. But it doesn't change the fact that the awesome helpful friendly service we are used to in WC is lacking at this location. But then again it's San Francisco. They have so much continuous business that service isn't a priority. Our server Max was decent. The food however was a disappointment. The Italian was more like a turkey sandwich with a thin slice of the other meats that were un-tastable. The roast beef dip was so full of gristle we had to spit a bunch of it out. I won't eat at this location again."
Karen W.,"Fremont, United States",38,33,58,2.0,25/2/2015,"Food wise I would give a 4 star, but it gets only 2 this time for bad service from the time we walked up. The two kids at the front could barely be bothered with ud, then gave a pager for a 10 minute wait. During that 10 minutes, I saw several parties being seated who arrived after us. I approached the kid at the desk and asked why Noone else had a pager, and that several parties had been seated before us. He just said without looking at me that we were next. We were standing another come of minutes while another party got seated again before us. We ended up leaving. Customer service starts at the door. Coss this location off my list."
