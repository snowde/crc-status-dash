Carol M.,"Rio Vista, United States",0,3,,2.0,19/2/2015,The slow service was frustrating. Our drinks came a good 20 min. after our meal was served. Food was good but rediculously slow service made our time there frustrating. We were about to cancel dessert when it finally arrived.
MyOpinion K.,"South San Francisco, United States",0,6,1,2.0,11/2/2015,"I went here for my birthday. Food is good but the portions are average. My experience wasnt pleasent because you could tell my waiter was so over whelmed dealing with all the tables he had. I felt bad for him! Going to eat here was a once in a lifetime, ""hey i tried it"" type of thing for me. The lines are soo long. I made a reservation at 3:30pm the day we went and still had to wait an hour and half to be seated. Party of 11. What was the point in the reservation! Try it once if you havent been here but dont expect to much. What I did love was that the whole restaurant sang happy birthday when they brought out the little scoop of vanilla ice cream."
Frank Harmony T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,1,2.0,18/1/2015,"The staff downstairs at Macys  for reservations or information for the restaurant didn't volunteer information. I asked about the restaurant and he never said that I needed reservations or to give my name for a wait, or where the line was.  However our waitress and the staff upstairs were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was fun and unique. Very dark ok, almost too dark to read the menu.  More a bar atmosphere than dining. The food was ok, not great.  Large portions.   The bread was delicious, the crab artichoke dish had a ""fishy"" flavor. The chicken was ok a bit plain and the broccoli is very crunchy. Read almost raw and difficult to spear with my fork. The potatoes were ok if you ate with the chicken otherwise they were a bit salty.  I had an Asian pear martini. It was amazing and bumped this review up to a three Oops I take it back. I just went to the bathroom. It has tissue everywhere, broken toilet paper holders and the sink is desperate of being fully wiped down.   The floors in here are also very greasy. I slipped and I watched another lady slip on the way in. The waitress said oh yes the floors are slippery. No they r greasy and dawn would take care of that ."
Miss R.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,27,6,2.0,13/1/2015,"Okay first the good news- it's gorgeous to look at and the ambiance definitely has the wow factor, and the outside seating is has some of the most beautiful views of union square especially at night. And the customer service is great, people are friendly peppy even! :D it's the city!  So what's so bad you ask? It breaks my heart to say this but the eating utensils and the glasses are dirty and I found something in my food once. Another time I got food poisoning, as soon as I left within the hour, I threw up and was  $40 dollars poorer :( This makes me so sad because I love this chain man! So I will  just admire SF cheesecake from afar, and visit their sister store Palo Alto cheesecake factory :D One day I hope to come back to this beautiful one, when she's cleaned up a bit I love you Cheesecake Factory Union square ..until we meet again. Tip- if your just going to the bar or having some drinks, you may be fine. Alcohol will kill mostly anything lol"
Kari B.,"Denver, United States",1,23,,2.0,30/12/2014,"I wasn't expecting much from a chain restaurant to begin with, but I was with a group of women shopping and the allure of the restaurant being on the top floor made it seem like a fun idea.  We had a 20 minute wait even though the place was pretty empty. When we ordered, our waiter returned to inform us that they were out of 3 of the 7 things we'd ordered. Then, we had a really long wait for food that was mediocre at best. The pear and blue cheese flat bread was tasty, but I was disappointed in the soy ginger edamame. Great flavor, but half of the edamame pods were empty."
Judy K.,"Carmichael, United States",0,105,,2.0,27/12/2014,"4 hour wait for a table!   This place is ridiculous!  I love to eat here, it's my favorite location, but 4 hours is way too long. Need for people to put in reservations.  Also need to take names for parties on lower level.  Wrong to trapes all the way up, and make my way to counter to find out the wait is 4 hours."
Derrick T.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, United States",0,3,,2.0,25/12/2014,"Food's great but pricey. Attentive service but a smile would be nice. Tip for the holidays- eat a meal before going because the wait to get a table along with getting your food is enough time until your next recommended meal. Overall, 2."
Chace H.,"Rohnert Park, United States",0,1,,2.0,20/12/2014,"If you're going to call out a two hour wait time as a ""worst case scenario"", do not expect to sit us three hours into our wait with smiling faces. Food was ok. Ordered an alfredo with chicken and recieved a giant plate of carbs with literally 1 oz of chicken on it. Thats bullshit...spending three more dollars on an entree should feel like you SPENT three more dollars, not like you made a huge mistake. I've eaten at a few of these places, all are great except this. Its a shit-show. Batten down the hatches, streamline shit, and learn how to manage better!"
Lauren T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,2.0,20/12/2014,"I see why they call this place a tourist trap...and the food is mediocre. The only thing they had going on was the view, which since it was raining, really didn't have anything going for them."
Crystal C.,"San Francisco, United States",584,453,87,2.0,16/12/2014,"In San Francisco, a major foodie mecca, one wonders why they throw their money at tourist traps such as Cheesecake Factory. At least, that was what my friend and I wondered a couple Friday nights ago as we walked up from Market for a friend's birthday dinner. The plan had suddenly (and disappointingly) changed from drinks at Novella and maybe some tacos, to a full dinner at CF. Not a fan, to say the least. The staff was unaccomodating, not seating our party until everyone arrived, though there were 3 of us there already, waiting on one more walking up from Market, no one greeted us, no one offered water or bread, and we had a change of server three times in about an hour. I had a $9 glass of old Chardonnay and split two appetizers with my friend. The other girls had a burger and pasta. They all had cocktails which they all complained gave them a sugar headache. I'm not a fan of most chain restaurants, and I plan to never go back here. We split 3 ways and it was like $50 per person. Way too pricey for what it was.  Get it together Cheecake Factory."
Sarah T.,"San Francisco, United States",261,288,176,2.0,4/12/2014,"I used to be a real fan of The Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. How couid I not? They had like a hundred different flavors of cheesecake, and actually really decent and yummy food. In recent years though, the crowds have become way ridiculous and it looks like they're starting to cut corners on all the recipes I used to love. They just ain't that great anymore. WAIT TIMES: We dropped by the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday (on hindsight, not the best idea) and were seated after a 45 minute wait. They have a nifty little system where they text you a few minutes before your turn so you can do some shopping while you wait, which is nice. The servers though, are totally snobby and rude, but I guess they can afford to be since there are 1283719 more customers willing to take your place if you dare to complain. FOOD: Sigh. This is where it all went down hill.  Normally, I would be happy to wait for a plate of Cheesecake Factory's signature delicious garlic noodles. That garlicky flavorful butter sauce, piled high on al dente spaghetti? Delicious. Droolworthy. Amazing. Dare I say it? One of the best plates of American spaghetti I have ever had. This time though, the garlic spaghetti sauce was terribly diluted, it looked like sad egg noodles in watery soup, and tasted just about as bad. So bummed that they would do that to such an amazing recipe! Is that only true of this branch? Do the other branches serve it in all its original glory? I really need to know! We also ordered a bowl of guacamole - which was pretty pricey, but generous in portion. Unfortunately, the guacamole was seriously underseasoned and lack luster. Bummer. The standout of the meal was definitely the tuna tartare piled high on mashed avocados. It was really delicious. All in all, an expensive and disappointing experience. Now I have to start searching for a new comfort food joint D:"
Gia A.,"Redding, United States",164,17,14,2.0,28/11/2014,"I don't know what it was that failed their dish on the day I came but I had such high expectation for this place. My steak arrived cold and well done instead of medium rare, even the appetizers, and 3 other dish we ordered was bland. Even my sister who is a great fan of cheesecake factory was disappointed. It was too overpriced for a very unsatisfying meal. We barely even touched it. In the other hand, the cheesecake? AMAZING! definitely sticking to their cheesecake and for the outside view. That's the only thing they're good for."
Andrew S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,2.0,26/11/2014,"I ordered a medium rare burger.  It was over-cooked, overpriced, and under-sized.  Glitzy setting with mediocre chain restaurant food."
Dominica B.,"Fairfield, United States",0,2,1,2.0,10/11/2014,"I was there on Monday celebrating my birthday with 5 others of my family members.The service was not there.We finished our meal and my family ordered dessert. Our waitress brought there desserts and had placed a candle on someone else's dessert to sing to me and that was it. The bill comes and we were overcharged, as soon as our waitress comes back she says ""I do apologize here is your Fudge Sundae"" after we were already leaving.I was just disappointed especially me being that it was my birthday."
Athena M.,"Irvine, United States",28,11,24,2.0,2/11/2014,"We came here on a Saturday night (non-holiday weekend) for my sister's birthday.  She had roughly 10 people in the party and we all promptly arrived at 6pm. We put down our names and the host told us it'll be about a 2 hour wait. We figured this would happen so others sat around chatting while some of us went to the bar to get some drinks. About an hour in, we went back up to the host stand and they told us it'll be another 45 minutes. Okay. Cool. We'll be seated sooner than expected. Again, others went to the bar and some went outside to enjoy the pleasant evening, taking in Union Square. When the 45 minutes were up, the host told us it'll be 2 hours. There was no way the party wanted to wait another 2 hours; we were hungry at this point. After explaining that we've been there since 6, the lady retracted her statement saying it'll be 10 minutes; they are cleaning up our table right now. Luckily, we were seated before we decided to go elsewhere. The waitress was friendly and took in our orders. She also helped in accommodating our tardy guest, who didn't think they'd be able to make it on time. We ordered drinks and was  delivered to our table almost instantaneously. Our food came in 30 minutes later, and she came around the table every once in awhile to check on our food and add more drink orders. What I really liked about our service was her splitting the bill before we asked for it. Service was great, the Steak Diane was on point, and some of their drinks were good.  Would I come here again? Probably only if I am with one other person. The wait time is ridiculous."
Megan C.,"Grand Rapids, United States",111,79,22,2.0,2/11/2014,I was forced to go here with my mom who was visiting. She saw this on Big Bang Theory. The portions are way way too big! My chicken bellagio dish could have fed 3 ppl. They should also do cheesecake flights instead of the very large slices because after eating their giant portions the last thing I needed was a super size slice of cheesecake.
Shemi E.,"Daly City, United States",0,7,3,2.0,29/10/2014,Very long waiting!! Been there yesterday and I waited for more then hour for a table and then 30min more for my appetizer. Not the place for you if you don't have at list 2 hours to spend. The food is ok not more than that.
Jarleen V.,"San Jose, United States",827,256,348,2.0,28/10/2014,"I hate to write such a low rating review for a place that I used to love so much. My experience here was just a mess. I'm generally a nice person who doesn't let the smallest things bother me, but when I'm hungry, I am the lady version of the Hulk. My boyfriend, his mom, and I were in the city for the weekend and decided to eat here at the Cheesecake Factory, rather than the pier (where we really wanted to go), but we didn't want to drive over and find parking again. It all started when we checked in with the hostesses for 3 people. They gave us a buzzer for a wait of 15-20 minutes. We are pretty patient people but it came to a point where my boyfriend had to ask if we were going to be seated soon. We ended up sitting outside, which we didn't mind - because it was very warm inside. I thought the view was beautiful, but all the birds flying around and swooping other people's food was quite a show. My boyfriend who is terrified of birds didn't enjoy our seat but we did say that we didn't mind sitting in or out. We even saw a bird fly into their glass doors! All you heard was a loud THUD. Lol! We ordered the spinach and cheese dip for an appetizer. The portion looked amazing because we were starving to death. (Just kidding, but you get it.) When we took our first bite, it was okay because we were hungry but um...? It was SO bland. Literally no taste - it was like tasting air. We were bummed because we always get this appetizer when we come to CF and this one was meh. We had it sent back to the kitchen. When we got it back, it just looked like they added more to it and it tasted like more cheese. Personally, it just needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper. When we seasoned it ourselves, it tasted a thousand times better. Maybe they were lacking in seasoning their food? I don't know. My boyfriend ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and that tasted amazing as always! We both love that dish. I ordered the Garlic Noodles. I seriously had high hopes for this because again, I was seriously so hungry! When my food arrived, I was ready to dig in until I flipped my chicken... I FOUND A HAIR. This has never happened to me and I was very disappointed. I told our server, she apologized and so did a manager(?), I was offered a soup/salad but I honestly just wanted my main entree. They had it remade but I feel like this time they added more sauce to it, which I didn't like. I took a few bites and had it packed to-go. I love Cheesecake Factory and their wide varieties of food on their menu. There's so much to choose from, along with their famous desserts. My experience here was so poor, but thank you to the lady that served us for being patient with us!"
Rodney T.,"Oakland, United States",29,11,4,2.0,22/10/2014,"Went out with two friends and since we were in Union Square we decided to try the Cheesecake Factory. Ordered Halibut and it was not good; indeed, it was dry and wasn't very appealing at all. There is nobody to blame but myself, I should expect fresh at the Fish Market or at a local restaurant that specializes in seafood but not at a Chain restaurant. I'll probably go back but I wouldn't order the same selection."
Elaine Y.,"San Francisco, United States",32,69,497,2.0,19/10/2014,"Waited over 2 hours for a table on a Saturday evening!!! Well, it wasn't my idea to dine here :,( Food was ok Service was terrible Wait was ridiculous  What we ordered for a party of 2 plus take out: 1.Skinnilicious Factory chopped salad 4/5  (Decent portion, reasonable price and low calorie)  2. Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane combo with a side order of broccoli  1/5 (3 large size breaded shrimp, 3 scoop of mashed potatoes and 3-4 small pieces of steak) I like my steak medium cooked, it came out well-done so I sent it back! It yoked about 40 minutes for it to come out again so we ended up pack it for to go. The side of broccoli took that long also. Unbelievable! 3. Meatloaf 2/5 4. Shrimp and chicken gumbo 2/5  5. Tiramisu Cheesecake 4/5 6. Blueberries White Chocolate Cheesecake 3/5 Worst experience ever!"
