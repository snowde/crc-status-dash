Josh Q.,"San Francisco, United States",33,414,,2.0,12/10/2014,"It's an average spot, but for a restaurant located in the center of touristy Union Square, the food and prices are surprisingly acceptable.  Several dishes have lunch and dinner portion sizes, and the lunch portions are huge - even for me.  The Pasta da Vinci stands out for me, even if it can get greasy.  The bread is also very good.  In terms of drinks, the bottomless lemonade is way too sweet.  Seems to be a theme here - everything is large, oversized, way too sweet/greasy, but a good 'value' if you're into that kind of thing."
Jenny H.,"San Jose, United States",122,6,3,2.0,5/10/2014,"I've eaten at Cheesecake countless times but this is the second time at this location. I got the luau salad and once again, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the luau salad is my favorite at the Cheesecake Factory, but this location doesn't seem to make it that well. I would have given this 3 stars, but the waitress wasn't very nice, the bread was old, and the silverware were dirty."
John L.,"Roseville, United States",0,17,,2.0,1/10/2014,"My wife and i met a couple of friends for lunch on 9/30/14. The wait time was almost nothing which was a shock. I expected at least 1 hour.  The waiter who seemed nice enough took our order and we were brought our drinks.  Our friend got up to greet my wife who arrived a bit later. As she got up, she knocked over a glass of wine. Another one was brought.  The wait time for the food was crazy. About 1 hour when the place was not that busy.  When the bill came I informed the waiter about possibly taking the 2nd glass of wine off the bill since it was accidentally knocked over.  After asking us if it was full when it was knocked over and we said yes, i could tell that he very reluctantly removed it from the bill.  Great food but the wait time to get the food is crazy."
Katie V.,"San Francisco, United States",43,132,44,2.0,30/9/2014,"We all knew it was gonna be a mediocre time. We all knew it, but when you one day decide you want Cheesecake Factory anyway and go and find it's a 2-3 hour wait, and then try to come back again and it's the same thing, and again in a different location and it's the same deal...well, it becomes kind of a ""Challenge Accepted"" kinda situation. Different time?? Nope. Different day?? Nope. After the busy season is over (AND before regular dinner hours)?? YES. Finally. Shortest wait ever, just 45 minutes after arriving a Saturday evening around 4:45. We were seated by 6pm (a little longer than 45 minutes but hey, less than 2-3 hours!). Service was terrible for a place that should know how to handle crowds. There was a period where there were a ton of empty tables around us, and yet our server was nowhere to be seen. They forgot our appetizer and took about an hour to bring us our food. I ordered a skinny drink and thought it wasn't what I asked for, but she had said it was so didn't question it...later, looking at the check, she'd given me the wrong drink. Oh, and finally, I love cheesecake and I love carrot cake. There was an item called ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake"" on the menu, and I thought it was just exactly what it said: a carrot cake CHEESEcake. Nope. It was a carrot cake with cream cheese filling, like any regular cake, and usually I'd appreciate that, but NOT WHEN I WANT CHEESEcake. Maybe I should have asked, but it was in the cheesecake section. How hard could it be to call it ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake"" instead of ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake""? Oh well. It was a pretty standard, 5/10 carrot cake anyway. But if I wanted carrot cake, I'd definitely have gone somewhere else. Oh yeah, and the food that we did get was ok. My boyfriend got the orange chicken and it tasted about half as good as the kind you can get at Trader Joe's. I got a turkey burger and it tasted a little less dry than cardboard (I wanted to ask for ketchup but our server disappeared again). But our friend ordered a pizza that looked pretty good! Annoyances aside, it was what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory, I guess. Now I remember why I never go."
Jessica W.,"Sacramento, United States",72,264,1162,2.0,15/9/2014,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located at the top of Macys in Union Square. It is  mnawfully busy. We ordered to-go and it was so crazy packed with people standing everywhere because there was not much seating area. That made It very not comfortable trying to find the line as well as standing in line waiting to have or to-go order taken. I think the way the restaurant's designed made togo very uneasy to access with the commotion of workers and guest piled along the middle of the restaurant in front of the cashier, to-go and elevators. If you are claustrophobic, it will be a problem."
Sandra L.,"Manhattan, United States",4,17,4,2.0,12/9/2014,"Not the experince I was hoping for, this location has such high expectations due to thelocation , and they did not come threw. Granted they have no real control over the 45 min wait time for a table. My problem is with our coming in cold which I can not accept, as a busy place they should not be serving a plate that waited to long and got cold. The drinks came on time and they wete good, I was even going to leave a 3 star review, but the manager was rude when we complained about the cold plate and did not even care. I will not be going to visit this location again, and I do not reccomend"
Reenson X.,"Honolulu, United States",1,67,14,2.0,10/9/2014,"The locations is pretty cool, especially the terrace. The food is mediocre, mostly average. The staff is nice but here are some things: It was pretty cold outside and the heat-lamps were not providing enough warmth. We asked if they could turn them up a little. ""No, that's not possible."" Five minutes later, some other waiter came and turned them up. No blankets either.  My friends from abroad asked for wi-fi. Again, ""No, sorry.""  We weren't served bread whereas every other table that was seated after us got bread. ""Sorry, we are baking it fresh right now."" We ordered two Heineken. ""Sorry, we are out.""  That's a lot of ""no's"" for one night..... especially when the food is not convincing."
Jessica B.,"Elk Grove, United States",11,2,,2.0,21/8/2014,"Great Food, Service was good, but Extremely Long wait times and if you like to be stared at while you eat then have fun with that because people outside stare and watch you eat and lean on your chairs while your eating dinner or lunch or whatever it is your eating since they have no where else to wait, also if you go when macy's closes good luck going back down the elevator, if you're claustrophobic good luck with that also since there are no other ways down and you're basically stuffed into an elevator..... i was not happy about the experience i had yesterday."
Dee C.,"Salinas, United States",1,14,,2.0,3/8/2014,"The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the ridiculously LONG wait times and crappy customer service! The food is really good but everything else sucks!     Visited this place yesterday at about 8:00 pm and did not get seated until 10:00pm!!! I tried to make reservations but was told they do not make reservations. Decided to wait because the last time I was here, I enjoyed the food but was in a hurry to catch the baseball game so I couldn't have some cheesecake. The lady at the check in was quite rude! I was with a party of eight and was told it would be a wait which we expected. She couldn't accommodate such a large party which I find ridiculous and she couldn't guarantee we could sit together!! There was also a man in a suit walking around (manager? I don't know) he was extremely rude. We asked him for a menu to look at food choices and he said to go get it in the front and he walks away! Then we set down the menu and he takes it without asking if we were done looking at it. As he's walking away we said ""excuse me sir, we are not done with that!"" He continues on his merry way! After 2 hours, we finally get seated and that was a problem because they wanted to split up our group and sit us on opposite sides of the restaurant!!! They ended up sitting us together but it was after my husband got loud.  We sat down and didn't have enough utensils, no bread, no drinks. It took about 30 minutes to order our food! The waitress was very nice but everyone else in that place that we encountered was rude! The food though was great as was the cheesecake!"
Issac W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,2.0,3/8/2014,Pasta carbonara was over boiled and buffalo wings were too salty. Only good thing was the night view of Union Square.
Misheel M.,"El Cerrito, United States",17,9,,2.0,28/7/2014,"Two stars for the view and the friendly service (but not the speed) I understand how hard it must be to be a waitress at a big restaurant but a 30 minute wait for drinks and another 45 for food doesnt cut a deal for me after waiting so long to be seated. I blame the management.  I only keep coming back with friends because it's one of SF's must come places that has a decent price on food and beverages and a killer view of downtown because I never seem to be satisfied with the food unless it's a burger or salad (food that no one can go wrong with)  Every time i try something different like pastas or rice dishes, the plate comes completely off from the description on the menu! When a dish only mentions vegetables, rice and meat with tomato or white sauce, i dont except it to be watery, almost like a soup! When i read ""sauce"" on a menu, i except the saucy to compliment the dish, not drown the dish (rice dishes and pastas) Trying different food goes completely wrong here so next time i will just order salad or a burger and not be deceived by what they write on the menu."
Sarah H.,"Austin, United States",2,54,16,2.0,21/7/2014,"This was a nice location while on vacation in SF. I loved that there was a gluten free menu with lots of choices. BUT, it's not a confidence builder when the edamame comes out with several noodles mixed in the bowel. Were they prepared in the same container? Used the same utensils?  Who knows?  I asked to cancel my GF pasta order (which still came to the table anyway) so who really knows if The Cheesecake Factory is gluten friendly or not. I didn't choose to find out.  On the bright side, the kids enjoyed the cheesecake."
Marcos F.,"San Francisco, United States",5,21,,2.0,17/7/2014,"Seasonal cheesecakes are a terrible addition to the menu, especially the pumpkin cheesecake during Halloween. Someday CCF should notice that these cakes are not an upgrade to the menu but a downgrade."
Muneera M.,"San Francisco, United States",125,154,47,2.0,9/7/2014,"So yah- it's a chain and this one kind of sucks. I typically like the cheesecake factory, only because it is super family friendly and makes outtings easy with so many options and big portions that you can share. The quality of the food and taste is chain like totally mediocre, not the greatest when you are in SF. There are way better places to eat. I rated this one a two star because it is beyond loud in there, you know when you can't hear the person next to you kind of loud. We got there at 10pm on a sunday night and there was still a 50 minute wait.  They have a pretty patio that overlooks Union Square, which is always nice, but it gets pretty chilly up there might want to bring a blanket ;)"
Anna L.,"San Jose, United States",540,73,41,2.0,5/7/2014,"Minus one star for service... We came here yesterday with a party of 4 for Fourth of July late night dinner/snacks and was dining outside on the roof area. My friend invited three more people to the party (they haven't yet arrived). So, we waved to a waitress and asked if it's possible to maybe arrange seating for us to sit down at another area for a larger party. The waitress then rudely goes ""Oh, you can just go ask the host.""  Not that we don't have legs, arms, or that we cannot physically go ask the host ourselves. However, as an etiquette, at least OFFER nicely and say things like ""I'm actually not sure if I can personally arrange that for you, but, let me go ask the host for you."" Nope. She didn't, she just left us hangin'. We also asked if we could order and she told us that we need to wait for our own waitress...UM. OKAY. We don't want to talk to you anyway....-__-"" I'm a host at a restaurant; hence, why I feel like it's necessary to complain about this type of situation because come on, that's extremely rude for an environment like Cheesecake Factory! (Not that I've experienced better service before here...and the wait here is just ridiculous in general...) Anyway, we ended up dining with just four people and was able to calm down because our waitress was pretty funny and somewhat lightened up the mood for us. Appetizers we got included the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Factory Nachos, Crispy Crab Wontons, and Buffalo Blasts. So much for healthy, everything was fried food, haha! We also got for dessert Tiramisu Cheesecake, and Strawberry Cheesecake. Both were average I would say. I favored the Factory Nachos a lot more over the others. It was not as greasy and oily as the Buffalo Blasts and Eggrolls, but it was worth a try.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory's food was mediocre, and I hope they'll learn to improve their customer service a little bit better because I'm out of here!"
Danielle O.,"San Francisco, United States",1,65,,2.0,20/6/2014,"Um, I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory, but I don't feel your food is worth getting steam-rolled and crushed to the death by the people in back of me because the stupid idiots in front of me don't realize that the escalator going up to the restaurant doesn't stop moving just because they got off it.  MOOOOVE your stupid ass over to the side, instead of staying in the center, Fool!   Maaaan!! Provided you survive the escalator episode, you will try to make it over to the ""reservation"" counter where you tell them how many people are in your party, where you prefer to sit (inside or outside) and then the staff hands you a flashing, vibrating pager while they tell you that you will be seated after a short wait.  AHAhahaHAAAHAAA...   From this point of the ""amusement park ride"" line, you will be standing for oh a good 45 minutes or an hour give or take, while everybody and their great grandma keeps bumping into you, because they think the line will move faster, even though the people in front of the line haven't moved an inch.   Once you have reached the front of the line, another staff person will usher you to a table. The comfort and space of the table where you are ultimately seated is directly proportional to the amount of cosmetic surgery, designer clothes and jewelry you have.  The ushers make sure the ""skinny/pretty"" folks have at least two extra chairs to place their purses and cute little shopping bags.  Sorry, but if you're average looking and casually dressed, you will be placed at a table where you will have barely enough room to put one elbow on, let alone your appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks. Speaking of the food...  Once you are seated, after having waited in line for so long, you will be so hungry that you will inhale whatever appetizer you order, along with any bread the server gives you.  I ordered a Steak Diane, which when I got it, seemed to be so much smaller than the photos of the dish that other Yelpers have taken.  Steak was cooked well-done which made it very dry.  The mushrooms and sauce had nice flavor, but the overall portion of the dish was too small. I had my hopes up for a mind-blowing dessert at least.  I figured after all that the ""Cheesecake Factory"" should at least meet my standards for great cheesecake... I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake which was pretty unremarkable.  It didn't taste particularly fresh, the texture was a little dry and hard in some spots.  The flavor was kind of blah, with the Kahlua and coffee flavors both not standing out.  In general, the whole feel of the dessert was like something commercially or mass produced, not 'homemade'. No love added as the secret ingredient. Now that I really analyze it, I guess that the Cheesecake Factory is appropriately named.  The whole experience was a lot like being a part of an assembly-line production -  being shuttled from point A to point B, to point C, served by wait staff with painted-on smiles, food given to you to consume as quickly as possible so that they can give you the check, you can pay (more than the quality and quantity of your food is worth) and then leave.  Then, for them, it's on to the next crash-dummy, I mean customer.  No, thank you, Cheesecake Factory.  If I wanted to hang out and eat at a place where I felt like a number, I'd sooner go to a fast food restaurant..."
Drea W.,"San Francisco, United States",23,59,10,2.0,4/6/2014,"What the FUCK is happening to San Francisco? Since being back in the Bay Area from the East Coast I've found that many of my fav places either SUCK at customer service now and/or the food is not up to my standards- of how I remember it being. I feel that that I had suggested that a new friend and I meet up here as I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years (In SF). We originally were sitting outside in which the waiter; Steven was very attentive. We asked to be seated inside as the chill began to pick up and they had not yet turned on the heated lamps and the damn pigeons were too gangsta for me! Steven sat us inside and we were introduced to a new waiter (can't recall his name) mainly because we were then given a NEW waiter AGAIN. We were about to order but a unidentified (staff member?) said: ""Hi, I'm not sure who sat you here but I have this area reserved so If you can follow me to a new place to sit"". Long story short we ended up waiting awkwardly with drinks in our hand waiting for a table to be cleared and cleaned. I began to be a little pissed. THIS PART TOOK THE CAKE. We were now introduced to Ezekiel a.k.a Zeke. He seemed a little off to begin with but I decided to ignore it. My friend and I wasn't ready to order yet as we were still trying to get situated from the numerous moves we made. I want to mention that Zeke's other tables were in front, behind, across and adjacent front us. This detail will provide to be VERY important lol So it took Zeke 20 mins to return to us to ask what had we decided on. During that time he walked by us a minimal of 3 times- taking other table orders... checking on near by diners and it wasn't until I damn near stared him down that he FINALLY came over. He took my order- my friend arrived before I did and had ordered a pasta dish outside so we didn't want to order anything else at the time. I ordered the Garlic noodles (Noodles, asparagus, garlic butter sauce, chicken (BONELESS) with tomatoes). I get this EVERY TIME I come to C.F. Plus: My friend and I got to have a LENGTHY conversation. DOWN SIDE: It took Zeke an hour to come to our table to say: ""Oh the reason it's taking so long is because the chicken is with bone and it takes longer"". I let him know that I got this dish every time and the chicken is ALWAYS boneless and I never had to request it boneless. lol WHAT THE FUCCCK!! (I screamed that in my head). He said I can rush and tell the cook to make it boneless. He tried to tell me some bullshit about a change in the menu but the item I ordered had been on the menu for EVER!!! Anywho, he went to request to have it boneless. Took 30mins (That's now damn near 1 hr 45 mins) to come with flavorless crap! I mentioned that the food was flavorless and did not have a garlic taste to it. Zeke said: ""Well, I can give you some Parmesan cheese for it- that's all I can do"". He left and I asked another waiter to get the manager; Lisa- who was VERY sympathetic. I explained everything and what really hurt was the fact that he wasn't a sucky waiter to everyone else, just to me and my friend- whom we happen to be Black and Indian. I won't say it was a racial thing but he was ATTENTIVE, WARM, BUBBLY and ACCOMMODATING to his other tables and we couldn't even get our water refilled or any damn BREAD- I LOVE THEIR BREAD lol Anywho, Tina sent his ass home!  I doubt I would go back. The face of SF is def. changing and all these changes is driving down the quality service MY City was once known for. If I want sucky-rude waiters, I might as well move back to the East Coast."
Chad H.,"Elk Grove, United States",77,16,5,2.0,28/5/2014,"My wife and ate here for dinner. Even though we were in SF and had so many other options, we chose to use a gift card we had for this restaurant. I had the chicken carbonara and my wife had the bang bang coconut chicken and shrimp. Both meals were mediocre at best. My carbonara was way to salty and my wife's dish was over the top on the coconut. We were disappointed. The service was only ok. For a restaurant that gets so much hype, they are totally overpriced and the food underperforms. We won't be going back."
Andrew C.,"Toronto, Canada",54,279,467,2.0,14/5/2014,"I'm a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory and the food is generally consistent with what I've had at other locations. Just a few things: 1. The coke I ordered had a weird metallic taste in it. 2. Patio doesn't have enough shade so make sure you have sunblock and sunglasses (our waiter was wearing sunglasses the entire time). 3. Tons of tourists here.  If you go during peak hours, prepare to wait for a long time."
Marlowe A.,"Lincoln, United States",0,3,,2.0,13/5/2014,"I want to explain why I gave 2 stars.  1. I'm not a native of San Francisco so  decided to grab something within walking distance and I know I enjoy Cheesecake Factory and so I decided to order out.  2. Before I left my hotel I called to order out. I was put on hold for 5 minutes. I started walking and by the time I got there I was on hold for a total of 20 minutes. I showed the manager my phone and explained the situation. She apologized and took my order but with NO comp, free drink, appetizer, cheesecake, NOTHING.  As a customer, I feel devalued and my view is that my business is unappreciated.  I gave 1 extra star because the man at the bakery saw I was upset and whispered that he would give me some fries.  You sir, I appreciate. The woman on the other hand, I really suggest that you learn to treat each customer with the respect and value them completely regardless of age/race/appearance.  I am disappointed and will not be giving them my business anymore."
