Shannon B.,"Elk Grove, United States",352,50,13,2.0,4/4/2014,TERRIBLE SERVICE. Our waitress was unattentive and never checked on us. Our water was never refilled. It took her over a half an hour before she asked us what we wanted to eat and to even bring us the water. It was my best friends birthday and she gave us the dessert menu to pick her cheesecake and didn't come back till we had to ask another server to get our waitress. If you don't have 4 hours of your day to spend do not come here to eat.
Priscilla F.,"San Francisco, United States",17,92,93,2.0,8/2/2014,"Although I know Cheesecake Factory is a famous dining place for local and tourists ... But everytime I came here , I will have a stomach ache afterwards.  Yesterday when u got home, I had a terrible stomach ache. I'm never coming back , since it has been the second time !  My experience here wasn't great as well , our server is rude and are not respectful. I forgot her name , but she was serving us then walk away to chat with other customers. Extremely rude when replying to our questions ! The food wasn't that fabulous after all"
Jenelle B.,"Northwest, Portland, United States",167,92,178,2.0,5/1/2014,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory a lot and I was very surprised at how horrible the service we received today. Party of three celebrating my brother's birthday. 45 minute wait to be seated as usual in downtown San Francisco and after being seated it took a while until our waitress decided to come by the table and ask for our order of drinks. After that was done, we waited and waited for what seemed like 20 minutes until we actually received our waters and basket of bread.  This rating mostly has to do with the service we received today. If better service is given in the near future then I will update my review.  If you do not mind the wait at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory then I would definitely suggest this restaurant as an option. I hope you receive better service than we did. Must be a new waitress."
Julian R.,"Pullman, United States",0,3,,2.0,15/12/2013,"I'll start off with the positives.  The view from the top floor of Macy's was awesome.  The variety in the large menu is excellent. Also the portion sizes are great since I eat a lot. The cheesecake is also good if you have room after dinner  Negatives: The wait was 1.5 to 2 hours. Obviously I thought the food was good enough to warrant this long wait.  Our waiter was pretty much non-existent.  I think there was a span of at least an hour before he came by after getting our food only after I stared him down to mention the next issue. I had the Carlton salad. It tasted great. But finding part of an avocado peel WITH THE STICKER that has the barcode for scanning was a little weird and worrisome. For some people finding this would be a deal breaker but I'm not eating the peel. But it makes me wonder how the quality control is in the kitchen. Our waiter gave as a free cheesecake because of this. I actually didn't cause too much of a fuss. I actually would have preferred getting a discount but whatever.  I give two stars because the food is tasty, but the service was mediocre. Never was asked how our food was and we couldn't get refills on our water. Avocado peel with the sticker was also a deal breaker."
J M.,"Los Angeles, United States",25,25,10,2.0,19/10/2013,Ordered Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken and got Alfredo soup.  BLECH!  Service was mediocre at best.  Only halfway decent thing was the cheesecake.  I'd recommend another place over this one.....definitely NOT worth the wait!
Amanda J.,"Washington, DC, United States",1440,892,308,2.0,6/9/2013,"I'm not one to review a chain, but seriously, this Cheesecake Factory is an experience unto itself. My friend and I came in the day before national cheesecake day with the Facebook offer for a half priced slice of cheesecake.  We gave ourselves 3 hours just to make sure we didn't need to rush to our next engagement.  At 1:00 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, this didn't seem unreasonable.  We were wrong. First, this place has the strangest atmosphere.  There are locals, tourists, homeless people, and the employees all jammed into the top floor of Macy's.  We were taking the elevator up, and there was a psychotic homeless woman harassing everyone.  Remember her, she'll come back later. So we manage to get up to the hostess, get a buzzer, etc.  We're given a wait time of 45 minutes.  Fine.  45 minutes pass, and everyone who had come in before us plus two groups of 7 and 12 after us had been seated.  So I walk up to the hostess, and she clearly had never entered our names... Ok.  Mistakes happen (until you read the other Yelp reviews and see this is common.  Ugh.).  She says we'll be next.  Total time to get seated:  1.5 hours Our waitress came right over with water, got our orders right away, and was efficient. Random Digression:  Suddenly, we turn around to find the CRAZY homeless woman sitting behind us at a table for six.  She had finished her piece of cheesecake and was arguing with her poor waitress that the cheesecake should be free because she can't read her coupon.  Seriously.  For whatever reason, the waitress walked away.  So the crazy homeless woman starts going around the tables that haven't been cleaned yet taking the food off of them.  She proceeds to eat anything left on other tables.  What she couldn't eat, she was placing on her table.  She then had the nerve to ask the waitress for boxes.  The waitress comes back with boxes and her bill.  So she boxes everything, and apparently, left a pile of change.  She then RAN out of the Cheesecake Factory.  Moral of the story:  Your waitress will appreciate a good tip. Meanwhile, we got our slices of cheesecake.  My Kahula coffee cheesecake was good, but the slices here were quite a bit smaller than branches.  Our waitress was decent, though, and she got us in and out without major real pain.  Except that she lost my friend's credit card and had to go searching for it...Not good. I wouldn't come back here.  San Francisco has much better things to offer.  But 1/2 price cheesecake is pretty cool, and the people watching factor will lead to some great stories later."
Monica H.,"San Jose, United States",927,683,956,2.0,24/8/2013,You just have come to the most touristy Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area. Spare your life. We were with my aunt who is visiting from Asia...  And hell no we took her here for food.. we only wanted to snack on cheesecake after a long shopping day.. There was a 40minute wait for a table at around 4pm. Good thing my smart self found the bar area where it's first come-first served basis. I chatted it up with one of the diners almost done with their meal..saved my spot..and whala.... Got seated in 4 minutes... hailed our server for no menus..just plain cheesecake... ate it..savoured it... and we were out..... Easy.
Aarie C.,"Oakland, United States",10,37,5,2.0,22/8/2013,"Stars for the view from the balcony seating.  My love had a little over an hour for her lunch break, and we thought wrongly that it would be an ample amount of time to eat here.  It was irritating to wait for so long to be seated as we watched and coveted an empty table for two outside, and when we were finally to be seated the host told us that we couldn't have that table because someone else at the bar requested it. Wtf? We sat there anyways and let him deal with it.  Our server was SLOW and inattentive. We weren't acknowledged until 10 minutes after being seated! The couple next to us was seated after us and even asked ""Have you guys been waited on yet? There are so many people working here."" Finally the guy (who didn't even give us his name!) brings us water. We ordered then. He poured us more water once, we had to ask for more bread. He never bothered to check on us after we got our food.  He completely disappeared when we needed boxes and our check... We waited another ten minutes and decided to leave the food and pay at the host's booth. The host was too busy to help us. The last straw. You would think that even after horrible service someone would be around to collect the money! Even a free meal was not worth the time wasted by this place."
Deanna Y.,"San Francisco, United States",777,280,1029,2.0,17/8/2013,"I avoided the Cheesecake Factory for years. I heard their food was okay, so nothing drew me here, but I finally had to check it out for myself. Popped in for lunch with a group of friends.  Everything was...underwhelming to say the least. I was so annoyed after my meal, mainly because I had such a such a classic order: a soup, salad, and sandwich combo. You'd think you couldn't really mess any of those up too badly right? Wrong. The best part of my meal was the complimentary bread sticks :(  The clam chowder would have been good, except it was way too salty. My turkey club sandwich literally tasted like turkey sandwich meat, lettuce, and tomatoes, slapped onto day old sourdough bread, with too much mayo. It was so unappealing that I didn't even eat it, which is rare for me. I took it home and pan fried it to make it acceptable. My brother liked it though. Shrug.  And the salad. I love caesar salad. If there's ever an add-on salad option at a restaurant, I always, always get caesar, but the salad was just terrible! It wasn't really the flavor, but the fact that the salad was horribly overdressed. My romaine was drowning in the dressing, which was so thick and creamy that I had to scrape some of it off. It was just way too heavy and again, I didn't finish it. If you get a salad with any type of creamy dressing, GET IT ON THE SIDE.  I don't understand why this place is so popular. There are always hoards of people waiting in the lobby. My guess is their convenient location, ability to accommodate large groups and their hotel island resort type of decor...oh and their delicious cheesecakes. But their cheesecakes shouldn't be their only saving grace. The food is sub-par and the high prices certainly do not reflect quality. Save your money and try one of the million other restaurants downtown."
Victoria J.,"San Francisco, United States",93,598,972,2.0,16/8/2013,The promised 3-4 minute line at the bakery from the hostess downstairs lasted a total of 10 minutes. I'm an impatient girl who doesn' t like misinformation.
Susan C.,"San Francisco, United States",2,54,,2.0,3/8/2013,"You, as a local, would never go here voluntarily but you have visiting relatives whose first wish is to go to Union Square and then eat at the Cheesecake Factory.   So you roll your eyes and go up to the top of Macy's and get in line.  If you've planned ahead sufficiently, go before peak dining time, so you ""only"" have to wait 30 minutes for a table.    Once you are seated, you grudgingly admire the view over Union Square  (if you are lucky enough to get a good table), and you flip through the textbook sized menu.  You wisely share an entrée - it doesn't really matter which as it will be a huge platter of forgettable comfort food no matter what you order, and save room for the obligatory cheesecake.  You admit that it is pretty good, and you'll even enjoy it for breakfast the next day (since you won't be able to finish it in one sitting).   For all that you've eaten, the bill isn't too large, and, besides, your visitors are taking you out tonight anyways. Then the next night, you take them to your favorite neighborhood bistro.  Unfortunately, when they come back next year, they will still say ""Oh, let's go back to the Cheesecake Factory."""
Robbie P.,"Friern Barnet, London, United Kingdom",1,7,1,2.0,1/8/2013,"The food was bland, the best part being the drinks. The Blueberry Mojito was a real treat.  Other than that, it was all very generic. The Sliders tasted on the same level as a McDonald's burger, while the pasta I ordered lacked any kick or real flavour.  The cakes were nice but not outstanding. At the prices The Cheesecake Factory was charging, I will not be visiting again."
Toby I.,"Santa Monica, United States",71,382,,2.0,29/7/2013,"If it weren't for that sweet waitress I would give this place 1 star. It's packed to shit, but thats not why I didn't like it. I put my name down they said 30 minutes.  Then I wait 1 hour. I go up to them and say WTF? They go.. OOPS yeah you have been waiting a long time, we'll seat you next.  I HATE that i have to be on top of them and why do i have this useless buzzer? it will never go off.  We got seated outside and the waitress was nice.  I asked for jamaican shrimp with chicken. Came out without chicken.  She brought out the chicken on the side and didn't even charge me for it.  I think when you're hungry , like super duper ghandi hungry you want your food.  And if you have to wait an extra 30 minutes, for no reason you just get pissssssed off.  At least I did.   I wouldn't come back to this place... there are so many good restaurants in SF why go to a chain restaurant?  I went because my friend wanted to go so i obliged.  I now know why I have only eaten here 2 times in 7 years."
Kaye M.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,66,38,2.0,22/6/2013,It's been over 3 years since I came back to eat here. I ordered their special which is the Fresh Grilled Salmon with Mashed potatoes and Broccoli and the four cheese pasta. The Salmon was great but the mashed potatoes were too salty. The four cheese  was dry. Service was horrible. This guy name Daniel was not too friendly. my son was talking to him and he just ignored him. I usually give more than $10 tip but gave him 7$ which he doesnt deserve.
Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, United States",304,1561,73,2.0,12/6/2013,"It's not every day that I needed to burn some time before an event and I had HOURS to burn...not just a few minutes.  And the place I needed to go was in Union Square so I needed to stay well around here.  On a Saturday afternoon.  I couldn't even script any higher degree of difficulty than that.  So around 4pm, I attempt to find an empty seat at the bar of this insanely busy restaurant, thinking, ""No Way That It Should Be Busy at 4pm...Who Eats At 4pm?""  Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with my logic and well there was a huge wait for tables...the bar was full...the seats in the waiting area were full...the standing room in the waiting area was full...and every ten minutes...there's an employee there who kept his eye on the menus that were being looked over in the waiting area!    I think I can enjoy going the Cheesecake Factory in general IF there was a way that I could be seated without waiting, not required to talk in elevated voices during the meal, and  not be rushed to leave the table when the server leaves the check at the table...(hint hint we want you to leave so we can sit a few of the HUNDREDS of people who are waiting for a seat). So honestly, I don't see that situation happening.  Mind you, I am a fan of their food and I'm not a hater of the portion sizes and love their cheesecake flavors too.   But I value my dining experience more and the food is not worth the fight to get a table here."
Minch Z.,"Davis, United States",0,6,,2.0,11/6/2013,"In my opinion, ONLY come here for the cheesecake. Make a phone call and take it to go. It's the ONLY thing that worth it. You don't want to spend over an hour waiting in line and the food is overpriced."
Beth F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,2.0,5/5/2013,"I can see the appeal of the Cheesecake Factory, but today the service let me down.  1. They got my drink order wrong, and the correct one did not appear until after I finished my appetizer (and they still charged me $12.50 for it!). Shirley Temples had no maraschino cherries. I hate the things personally, but that is what makes them magical for little girls!  2. They sat my family at a table where I was essentially sitting in the aisle, getting bumped by wait staff every time they passed.  3. The reason I went there was to pick up a whole cheesecake I had pre-ordered for a friend's birthday. After a long discussion with a woman on the phone, and with our waiter who told me they were decorating it, the cake did not have any birthday message on it as I requested. A $50 birthday cake!  I would characterize the food as fine, and as another noted the portions were big. But I won't be going there again."
Andy M.,"Hayward, United States",371,187,115,2.0,18/4/2013,"Two thoughts: 1. Cheesecake here is just like cheesecake at any of the other Cheesecake factories.  2. The food here is horrible.  The wait is always long and the service is not the best. I usually really enjoy cheesecake factory food but the times I have eaten at this location have all been horrible. My pasta dish was so smothered in sauce I felt like I was eating soup. Food comes out extra slow, and meat is always over-cooked and dry.  I'm am really sorry to say but I will make it a point not to dine here again. I'll stick to the other cheesecake factory locations."
Nicole E.,"Fremont, United States",46,80,18,2.0,8/4/2013,"I'll write this with the disclaimer that I really do like other Cheesecake Factory locations. The chain as a whole tends to have decent food, and consistent service. But this place is kind of what I would imagine hell to be like. First of all, you have to pack into this little elevator, and nobody has a concept of personal space. Just wait for the next one, you guys. Hosts/hostesses have this rude attitude. I know it's probably going to be over a 1.5 hour wait at any given hour of the day, but please you don't have to be so pretentious about telling me that. Come on. Servers are trying, but they're busy and tend not to be attentive. Service is quite sub par compared to other locations. The food is still good. I just don't think it's worth the musty elevatory ride, 1.5 hour wait for the table, and 45+ minute wait for the food. Seriously, if you're in San Francisco to visit... take it from a local: There are 1,000 better restaurants you can eat at within this little 7x7 mile square. Go experience something better."
Violet D.,"Maryville, United States",0,14,,2.0,23/3/2013,Someone in the kitchen was way to generous with the pepper.  Service was OK. Food was not as good as other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to in the past.
