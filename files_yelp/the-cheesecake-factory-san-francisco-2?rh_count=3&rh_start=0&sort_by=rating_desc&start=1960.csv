Matthew G.,"San Francisco, United States",1,18,,2.0,12/3/2013,"As much as I enjoy their desserts, I have always found their service to be subpar and lackluster. With its location in Union Square, it is almost always overcrowded as well (expect wait times of over an hour on weekend evenings). The time from ordering to actually receiving food is always a lot longer than it should be, and if you are hungry, you will start to become irritable by the time the food actually shows up. This is nice to visit if you are a tourist (and want a great view of union square), but you can do so much better as far as dining goes in SF."
Stella R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,2.0,22/2/2013,"I have eaten here about 3 times, and each time was feeling well directly after my meal.  Why come back because, well I get gift certificates, friends want to go etc. Each time I got sick I thought it was isolated, because it case was a little different but the end result was the same. I though it was because I ate too much, or the food was too rich, but it tasted good. The last time I ate there as usual I order the mac and cheese balls which I love, and again I ran into their bathroom. The other day my friend went and was also sick and this is what triggered the review. Would I return to this location, weird but yes, but I would only order drinks and salads."
Gerry B.,"Westminster, United States",986,557,569,2.0,22/2/2013,"We were recommended this restaurant by friends , perhaps our expectations were too high , it's not that it wasn't good but we felt a little let down , maybe our choice of food was to blame , maybe because we sat outside when we ask not to I'm not sure , Service was OK without being outstanding same with the food , we didn't go back again during our 2 week stay - I'm sure others have had great experiences here so don't be put off by this review."
Brittany S.,"San Carlos, United States",5,95,45,2.0,24/1/2013,Sucks overpriced for crappy frozen food.. Theres so many great places to eat and explore in SF dont waste ur time eatting here
Jessica H.,"San Francisco, United States",131,268,241,2.0,21/1/2013,"This place pisses me off. Really. They always market themselves as a fancy place to have dinner or lunch, and the view overlooking Union Square is nice (if it's not cold and you're not afraid of seagulls and potential attacks). But really now, the wait for a table is ridiculous, and the wait for your food afterwards is equally miserable. And with that, the food is eh. The entire experience from wait until check too about 2.5 hours, with eating only being about half an hour. This does not make me a happy camper. The cheesecake is the real selling point, but its expensive and at that point, you might as well get it to-go and get a bench at Union Square and enjoy it there."
Lisa L.,"San Francisco, United States",562,187,175,2.0,13/1/2013,"Oh Cheesecake Factory... why must I always wait so long for my delicious cheesecakes D:   haha my wait was over an hour long but I guess that's what you get when you go there after work at the location in downtown san francisco :P  I'm not sure if it's just me but it seemed like the girl who took our number down was kind of mean.  And our waiter was really slow.. We waited forever to get menus, to get our food, and he barely checked on us.  I'm not sure if he was new or something but I was on a time crunch and he just stalled with taking the check and all. I was a bit disappointed with but hopefully next time will be better?"
Joy-Lu B.,"Daly City, United States",52,85,10,2.0,3/1/2013,"I will say this again but probably for another establishment, they should just stick to making their namesake... and just make cheesecakes.  Their food is tough and bland, that is all."
Alice L.,"SoMa, San Francisco, United States",1,1,,2.0,28/12/2012,"I had high expectation for the Cheesecake Factory because i haven't been to one for a long time. I went with my dad yesterday at 5 and got a table for two pretty quickly, which was nice. We ordered an appetizer (raw tuna wrapped into tempura), a salad, and a seafood main course. I was going to order an appetizer salad since we had lunch at 2, but the server told us the salad wouldn't be enough so we decided to go for a full size. Turned out the salad was like the size of a main course, which was way too much than what i wanted. I mentioned to the server that it was not what he describe to be ""enough"", but we decided to keep it anyway. After we finished the appetizer and most of the salad (still a little bit leftover), I asked the server to wrap up the rest and bring us the main course. He just gave us the cheque and cancelled our main course!!! The service was so bad!!!! (although the food was ok)."
phil c.,"San Francisco, United States",196,51,9,2.0,18/12/2012,"I can't believe I used to love the cheesecake factory. I guess back when I was broke and used to eating fast food and lower quality chained restaurants I felt like teh CF was one of the 'fancier' places.  I came here yesterday and we ordered the avocado eggrolls I guess they were ok, almost like the frozen eggrolls you get at the supermarket freezer section. Also got the fish n chips (lunch portion) and yeah it was a lot of food. I got a stomach ache after... Also the raspberry lemonade...I believe it had 50% sugar. Not my cup of tea, maybe I'm just getting old. The waiter was adequate though."
Storm C.,"Alhambra, United States",22,277,205,2.0,5/12/2012,"The place is nice, on top of Macy's and has the view of Union Square. Food is okay, been to other locations and they are all the same. The service here needs to be checked by management. The waitress is ""RUSHING"" us, and we have only been seated for 30 minutes and mind you we waited 1 hour for the table. She keeps asking if we are done, when clearly our plates where still full and one time she asked, my friend was in the process of picking food from the plate with his fork. ??? do you think he's done?"
Allison K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,39,13,2.0,1/12/2012,If ur a patient person it's the  perfect place for u :) if not don't bother the food is great but the staff has a lot of fake ness to their service they were all happy n smiling then they walk away with a mad face
Liv A.,"San Francisco, United States",397,806,1516,2.0,20/10/2012,"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants at all costs, but I ended up here with 2 friends on a weekday evening after shopping in Union Square. Honestly, I don't even like cheesecake. We just wanted something close by and it was getting late so went to the tourist trap. Definietly crowded with tourists left and right. It took us about 30 min to get seated. We had to sit outside bc there were no tables inside. Thank goodness for the overhead heaters otherwise, we would have froze to death out there. Another thing about CF that boggles my mind is that the menu is too big and most of the dishes are a ton of calories.  I ended up ordering the white chicken chili with brown rice off the skinny menu. I had it before and knew that it was decent. My friend decided on a burger and the other one picked some beef dish. Why did our waiter disaapear for 45 minutes? It took another 15 minutes for us to even wave a different server down. We asked where our waiter was and why the food still hadn't come out. The manager comes over and brings us our food. Of course, everything is cold bc it's been sitting there for who knows how long, waiting for the waiter to bring it to our table. It wasn't until we were finished with our meals that he showed up again....not even apologizing for his absence. Unprofessional!  2 stars goes to the honey wheat bread."
Kristen M.,"Union City, United States",314,94,4,2.0,5/9/2012,"The San Francisco Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the worst locations of the restaurant to eat at if you want timely and courteous service. The food is great but the customer service and attentiveness of the waiters/ waitresses is definitely lacking.  The few times I've been here I've been mistreated as a customer but still I continue to return. The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant.  The nice thing about this place though is the view you have from the top of Macy's. It is pretty awesome. And like with any other Cheesecake Factory place the food and desserts are awesome"
Camellia S.,"Los Angeles, United States",581,163,50,2.0,5/9/2012,"Other than the view, this place is not the best option for a nice meal in SF! The service was extremely slow, the place was extremely crowded, the food was cold, the pasta totally undercooked, and the staff just seemed confused and panicked. We were seated outside, even though it was cold. We asked them to turn on the heater but that took a while.  I ordered the Pasta da Vinci and it was totally undercooked. I like my pasta cooked al dente but this was overdoing it!  Although this spot offers up a gorgeous view and a superb photo opportunity, it still doesnt meet my expectations when it comes to food spots in the city."
Stephen S.,"Chicago, United States",73,786,102,2.0,20/8/2012,"It's the cheesecake factory so you know what to expect in general. This location in particular is especially crowded which has always confused me in San Francisco when there are options galore. I was disappointed they wouldn't give me a taste of a wine by the glass prior to ordering it especially because the server had no idea how to describe a wine or any ability to provide recommendations. As I said, it's the cheesecake factory."
Dominique W.,"Lakewood, United States",0,2,,2.0,13/8/2012,"The cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants. But today the service was HORRIBLE! The food wasn't that great and on top of that we waited about 30 minutes for our food. Our waiter at first, Parker, was very attentive made sure we had everything, but when we switched tables our other waitress was not that great simply because she forgot about us and just wouldn't check up enough times. I hope next time my service is better."
Victoria M.,"Richmond, United States",5,7,,2.0,7/8/2012,"Horrible seating situation going on here. Everytime we go it's a very long wait but this time....Ooh god! It was the last day before my mother went back to Mexico so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so cheesecake factory it was.  They don't take reservations even for large parties so we decided to wing it. Big mistake, they told us it would be an hour long wait (typical) but 4 of us would be seated at one table and the other 4 at another table separately,(not so typical) not even close to each other! And if we waited for a table large enough we would get it by closing time; it was 8:30 on a Saturday. They close at 12:30! Really you guys couldn't so better huh? Needless to say we ended up at CF in Walnut Creek, but that's a whole other HORRIBLE review. (let's just say bad bad bad customer service).  Only reason why it gets two stars is because the food is regularly okay and so is the service but we didn't get to that part that night."
Monica D.,"San Francisco, United States",45,72,,2.0,5/8/2012,"The best thing about this place is the CHEESECAKE! We waited 30-45 minutes for a table. The service was SLOW.  The items that we ordered came out way too fast, that we couldn't even eat them fast enough. My dinner selection was the Farrelle w/ Chicken.  THE CHICKEN WAS DRY & BURNT so  bad that I had to cut around it. I brought it home so that it didn't look tacky to eat that way.  I might be back.  Will try other locations to see how the service is there."
Angela F.,"Hawthorne, United States",40,119,220,2.0,25/7/2012,I have alwaysgone to the cheesecake factory in other states but very dissatisfied about the one in ST. I expected better from their Union Square location. The wait was a long time and the service was less than I expected. Sorry CCF maybe your were concerned about your customers happiness.
Christy M.,"Bakersfield, United States",0,17,2,2.0,21/7/2012,"We had dinner there on Friday.  We were both pretty surprised how bland our dinner tasted.  Tom had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya.  I had the ahi tuna over rice.  Tom mentioned how there wasn't any taste to  his food.  He ordered this because the menu stated it was spicy.  The onions, bell peppers, pasta and chicken were tasteless.  My ahi was seared okay, but I needed soy sauce to add flavor. We do not plan on eating there again because of the amount of time we had to wait, the tasteless food and know there are such a variety of restaurants to choose from. Hope you can use this review."
