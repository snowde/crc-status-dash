Lily Z.,"Alhambra, United States",16,138,5,2.0,6/7/2012,"On separate occasions I have ordered: jambalaya pasta, fish tacos, and a crispy chicken sandwich. Every one of them was at best, subpar. Add that to the long waits because tourists are told to go here.  I've only gone so many times because it was one of a few sit down, casual restaurants situated in the middle of the downtown area. If you do plan to go, try to get outside seating on a good day and just go for their desserts. I've only had their cheesecake once and it was pretty good. I've had some other dessert that was good too. After all, they are known for their cheesecake/desserts. It is a to-go place if you want something sweet."
ibby m.,"San Francisco, United States",0,47,4,2.0,6/7/2012,"I don't like chain restaurants and only came here for dinner last night because we had a gift card. The long wait was expected. Once we sat down, a very professional server approached us and took our drink orders. She stated that our waiter is on break and that he will follow up with us shortly. Since we reviewed the menu while waiting, she also took our order. I ordered a mojito and she suggested a glass of water while waiting for my cocktail. That told me that the bar was backed up. I appreciated her suggestion. However, after 10 minutes, no water. She walked by our table a few minutes later and I asked her for the water. She said our regular server would be along with that. 15 minutes in and the water shows up with the cocktail. It's just water. I don't think anyone should wait that long for something so simple. We ordered two mushroom/onion/cheese burgers with side salads. I ordered medium ad hubs ordered med rare. Mine was ok, his was not med rare at all. Barely any pink. The mushroom and onions were so skimpy and there was only once slice of cheese when the menu said two slices. I mentioned the skimpy toppings to our server and he didn't offer to get more. He simply said that's the way it is. For a 1/4 lb  burger that was smaller than the bun with 6 pieces of mushrooms and 3 pieces of onion, I was shocked at the $11 price. I noticed the lady next to me also complain about her food. There was a missing ingredient as well. Oh I forgot, the mushrooms were Luke warm and the cheese was a bit cold. The other reason I'm giving a low rating is because our regular server barely communicated. No thank yous, no acknowledgments, nothing.  At the end, he only asked if we wanted dessert. Hell no. Not going to help your up selling when you can't help make your customers happy. We tipped 10% to reflect the minimal and skimpy service. Next time I will give my gift card away."
JERRY B.,"Daly City, United States",0,87,,2.0,6/6/2012,"Last Sunday, I placed a to go order for an  item hours in advance, as I know this location is constantly busy.  Instead of getting a glamerburger cooked medium well, with cheddar. I got a burger, that was beyond charcolaed, and without cheese. I'm sorry but if i'm going to pay cheesecake facotprices,I would expect them to know how to cook a burger. This is nothing new, as quality clearly, is not what you always get at the CK Factory. Perhaps, Mcdonalds, or Jack in the box, could do a better job, at half the price"
Adelina W.,"San Francisco, United States",171,413,693,2.0,14/5/2012,"I don't love it, but I don't hate it. The line is always long. If you think you can skip the line and eat at the bar, think again. That's equally as packed as the waiting area. The menu choices are abundant. You're overwhelmed with the choices and the portion size that you really don't have room for cheesecake. The service is lacking, good luck finding someone to help you get anything here but they're quick with the check. My advice is to just come by if you want cheesecake. Put your order in at the takeout window and head to Union Square to eat it."
Shamiya M.,"San Francisco, United States",7,31,2,2.0,13/5/2012,"I love going to this place because their four cheese pasta is amazing. The service has always been great. I go there knowing it will be a long wait and when I am finally seated, the servers are usually on top of their game. I went recently with my family on Mother's Day and had a crappy experience. Our server Ciarra was a little slow  and even messed up an order, but I understood that it was a holiday so I let that go. When it was time to pay for our bill we gave her part cash and part credit card. When I got the credit card statement back things didn't add up. We were missing $20! We told Ciarra and she claimed we didn't give it to her and pulled out random cash and said that is what we gave her. She was totally lying and probably stole the cash or let the cash fall out.  She totally ruined our day and my family's experience at the Cheesecake Factory."
Jael K.,"La Jolla, United States",0,5,,2.0,1/4/2012,"So I just went to this place with my boyfriend. They told us the wait was gonna be 35 to 40 minutes, but it turned out to be only 20. For a sunny Sunday afternoon, that was pretty good I would think.  We were seated on the outside patio, which is super nice and has a great view. The bf ordered fresh strawberry cheesecake - yummie. I had the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, which I usually get, and which was as good as ever. Unfortunately, that's all the positive things I can say about this place. Service was HORRIBLE. From what I've read on here, maybe it's because we're both students. Anyways, we were treated like two 13-year-olds who had no business being in this place. Only we're both in our twenties. Unlike everyone else, we did not get any complimentary bread and butter. Our waitress did not even bother to say ""there you go"" or ""you're welcome"" or ""enjoy"" anything the like. We had to repeatedly ask for refills - they never once just gave us one (in fact, I never even got a refill on my water; but even my bf, who paid for his coke, had to be really persistent). Then they brought us our check when we hadn't even finished half our cheesecakes, which I thought was pretty rude. And it's not like we were taking our sweet-ass time. It was more like they were trying to get rid of us asap. Meanwhile, everyone else around us was treated friendly. Nah, not going back there. If it weren't for the nice patio and the yummie cheesecake (which of course is the same as in every other CF), I'd have given 1 star."
Nadav M.,"Montreal, Canada",22,251,177,2.0,26/3/2012,This place has a habit of taking way too long for the food as well the waiters in a way ignore your service and I was given warm water when I clearly asked for ice. Also the waiter didn't turn on the heater when i told him when i sat outside. I might not be coming here. I'll perhaps start going to Pleasanton or Walnut Creek.
Melinda H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,9,,2.0,13/3/2012,"The service was very slow. I mean very slow. We waited about an hour and a half.. ok.. that's not too bad (at least for this place.. considering we are in a heart of one of the most busiest city..) got seated.. waited.. the server came to ask drinks.. waited waited..... got our drinks...waited waited waited the server came to take our order.. waited waited...... it would run out the space writing about how much we waited.. for everything!! so make the long story short, the food was good as always. but the service was very very slow, I must say."
Erica L.,"San Carlos, United States",158,428,90,2.0,11/3/2012,"Server was great! I had the old fashion burger. o m g... saltiest thing i've had in a longgg time! the FRIES were salty too!!! they were so salty that my tongue started to hurt! I've been to cheesecake factory maybe 2 or 3 times, but i never remember enjoying my meal that much.  Cheesecakes are pretty good. a little bit on the sweet side, but I like their flavors that they offer."
Rocco D.,"San Diego, United States",0,63,,2.0,26/2/2012,Not really good to be honest.  I've tried the meatloaf and it pretty much tasted like shit.  I figured all Cheesecake Factories were bad but then I tried one in Portland and it tasted fine.
Rico R.,"Silver Spring, United States",16,146,44,2.0,9/1/2012,"San Francisco restaurant with a New York attitude, aside from our waiter, everyone had an attitude, even the manager. Food took for ever; unorganized and unfriendly staff. Food was good but it took forever. After waiting for about 20 minutes, the hostest gave our table to another couple that had just arrived. Don't recommend, so somewhere where they care for their customers."
James J.,"New Orleans, United States",0,22,,2.0,5/1/2012,"I used to love this place. I have visited the SF one on about 3 occasions and I only go, because someone wants to go. But the food is average at best and the wait is too long and the service - bad.  I think SF has a way of messing up a wet dream. But the Union Square location no way."
Karry D.,"San Francisco, United States",66,27,,2.0,30/12/2011,"So, I came here to eat with my relatives - my sister, my sister in law, and my two nieces. I'm never coming again. Service and food pretty much sucked that night. My chicken costoletta was pretty oily unless it's the sauce but... I could see the oil separating from the sauce... hmmm... yum? NO! I ended up using the bathroom 2 hours later from it...  And goodness, service is horrible. We may look like children but geez... I have the Asian curse, damn you! I look young so don't ignore a small girl like me who is asking for your attention, waiters and a waitress. Yes, you got that right - I had three waiters, a female and two males. It was cool that the female went on break and the replacement told us... but... NO ONE TOLD US SHE CAME BACK! I kept looking for the bald, clean-shaven waiter but he was nowhere to be found. It's cool that she apologized but... seriously?! I'm tired."
Mike L.,"Oakland, United States",29,526,51,2.0,17/12/2011,"This place is like a machine, with lots of stuff and lots of waiting.  It's gotten to be somewhat of a joke.  A mass of people and a two hour wait.."
Kelly H.,"San Francisco, United States",82,33,15,2.0,17/12/2011,Expensive regular food like chicken salad sandwiches. The service isn't that great.. the workers kinda ignored us because we were just a bunch of kids. And the food wasn't that great. Most likely not going back again.
Anna V.,"Livermore, United States",441,56,38,2.0,15/12/2011,"Positives: awesome outdoor terrace overlooking union square, food is satisfactory and the waiters do seem to try to help Downside: it's so big, there's so many people (employees and customers both) and therefore customer service sucks! Once we got our table, it took us 2hrs and 25 minutes to complete our meal and we were with our 3 & 5 year old kids so it was quite torturous for that last hour!  We even ordered our meals within 5 mins of sitting down and ordered our dessert within 10 mins of getting our food. Very disappointing experience."
Hannah C.,"San Francisco, United States",357,110,351,2.0,15/12/2011,"My girlfriend and I decided to eat here after many hours of shopping at Macy's.  It's convenient enough.   The only reason this place always had a long wait list was because they do not take reservations.  Portions always seemed enormous but to me they only appeared large because they're actually served in huge sized bowls and plates.  Food is mediocre at best.   We shared Chicken Madeira (sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce and served with mashed potato).  That's their ""most popular chicken dish!""  MMMM overcooked asparagus and chicken.  It was edible when we were starving and didn't want to wait but I wouldn't order it again.   They have a huge selection of cheesecakes but I'm not a fan of their dense and toothache sweet cheesecakes.  Served in huge slices and price was proportional  to the size.  If I ever order cheesecakes, my pick would always be the fresh strawberry cheesecake but we didn't order any desserts this time.  We couldn't wait to get out of there after having to cramp at the corner of the bar to eat our dinner.  It was madness."
Tanya N.,"Mountain View, United States",95,396,371,2.0,27/11/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory always reminds me of going outlet shopping in Buffalo with my friends back when I lived in Toronto. We always made it a point to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory where the portions are huge, their complimentary bread is delicious and of course, the two page menu of cheesecake.  The one in Macy's in always packed and the standard wait time seems to always be 1.5 hours.  I had a friend come in town who LOVES this place so we waited for two hours to be seated.  Since it's in Macy's we roamed around the department store for about an hour and then sat around the sofas on the 7th floor below the restaurant until our buzzer went off.   Service was good.  Our waitress seemed to be on hyperdrive but I guess you have to be since it's so busy.  I had the Tomato Basil Pasta which was the worst pasta I've had - even compared to food court pasta.  It was clearly pasta that has been sitting under the warmer for too long as the pasta along the edges were dried out so they shrunk in size a bit, hard and chewy.  Terrible.  I tried mixing it with the sauce but nothing could be done.  I think when this place get too crazy they try to find short cuts to make service faster but this was a fail.  Utterly disappointed.  I then shared a lemon raspberry cheesecake slice which was great since it was one of the lighter cakes there I didn't walk out completely stuffed.  Service was great, they had warm bread (love warm bread) and the cheesecake were awesome.  The main sucked."
Michael D.,"San Francisco, United States",212,168,10,2.0,25/11/2011,"I'm all shook up.  If you're a sucker for views you'll be weak in the knees, but cheesecake lovers beware.  Dense, grainy, and ultra sweet, Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake is a little more ""Vegas Elvis"" and a little less ""Blue Suede Shoes"" Elvis."
Paisley P.,"Newport Beach, United States",9,245,,2.0,23/11/2011,"Well, this was up and down. We were in a larger group, and we knew we were gonna have to wait a bit since we were a big group and coming on a Friday night, but they seated us somewhat quickly, except we were on the terrace outiside. It was May, and even with heaters, we were freeeeezzzzziiinnnggg. The service was pretty slow but we had a very nice waiter. The food was pretty good and the cheesecake was awesome. The menu overwhelms me with its endless high-calorie options. Would want to come back, but it better be inside and the service should be better."
