Anonymous P.,"San Pablo, United States",1,272,477,5.0,14/6/2013,"Damn how long has it been since I've been here to this location?? Well before Friday's dinner date with my girlfriend, it was about 9 years ago since I've been here so it was time once again to explore ;) Always a wait bc well it's the Cheesecake Factory. A tourist attraction and a definite hotspot for drinks and cheesecake!! Ooo a BEAUTIFUL combo I say!!  We ended up finding a table by the bar, yes we LOVE our alcohol and we're damn proud of it too. Our waitress *sorry sweetie I forgot your name* was sweet and attentive to our every need. We were offered complimentary bread and decided to have more drinks. My gf decided on the Pyramid Beer in a Short Glass and I decided on my girly drink and went with the Georgia Peach blended with alcohol drink. *I'm not a big fan of beer but the Georgia Peach definitely hit right spot. Light alcohol blended to make this drink fruity and oh so sweet!! Now for appetizers we decided on on the Asian Chicken Wraps; YES I was on a healthy streak. Tender chicken pieces, veggies layered into a big ol lettuce made this appetizer a HEALTHY yet AMAZING tasty snack. My gf also decided on the Grilled Bleu Cheese and Pears on flat bread. *Now I'm no fan when it comes to bleu cheese but with sweet pears on this flat bread was a must try for my belly.* Sadly we were too stuffed to try any cheesecake but next time I vowed to trade in my alcoholic needs for my sweets addiction just to satisfy one of my cravings..  To be continued..."
Steven V.,"San Bruno, United States",0,6,,5.0,7/6/2013,"I must say this is a difficult review to write.  You have to be jerking my chain, a native San Franciscan writing a five star review for The Cheesecake Factory, however, the facts are the facts.  This was not my first choice but a friend really wanted to have lunch here.  I made reservations for 12pm, good call because this place was hopping.  We got seated quickly and every server we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful.  The food was excellent.  I ordered the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  It was amazing (unless you eat like you are on flippin death row go with the lunch portion).  Another person had the Salmon, which she really enjoyed.  The Club Sandwich was also well received.  Then some Oreo Cheesecake and Peanut Butter Cheesecake.  Truly a fabulous lunch.  Raved about it so much my wife ended up going there the next day.  I can't say enough about the service...it was on par with the food.  We had three different servers ask us if everything was satisfactory.  They weren't a bother like just filling some type of quota, they all seemed genuine.  It was a great afternoon and a great meal.  Go figure, The Cheesecake Factory.  Like coach Mark Jackson would say ""Call my bluff."""
Cara H.,"San Francisco, United States",3,49,36,5.0,4/6/2013,"In my opinion, the food here is AMAZING.  I waited approximately 20-30 minutes for a table, (so worth the wait!) and when it was time to order, I decided to order Fried Calamari, as well as a Smokehouse BBQ Burger. The Fried Calamari, hands down, was DELICIOUS. It was like heaven in my mouth. When the Smokehouse BBQ Burger finally came right when I finished my Fried Calamari, I took a bite out of it, and that was just as good. The bacon was just amazing.  I'll definitely be back, guaranteed."
Martha T.,"Tracy, United States",0,3,,5.0,18/5/2013,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times, but never really cared for it. I would always avoid this place when in Union Square because it's always so busy with a long wait. However, a few weeks ago I finally went and I'm glad I did. We had to wait about 20 minutes, but it wasn't too bad because we stepped outside and enjoyed the view. The food was very yummy and the portions were huge! My mom and sister had some of my food and I had enough to take home for dinner the next day. It's worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a good place to eat."
Marcio C.,"San Francisco, United States",481,9,13,5.0,5/5/2013,"So I came into the Cheesecake Factory today, not my first choice considering I'm not a huge fan of chains but WOW my mind has literally been blown. The service here is top notch. I felt like an A-list celebrity at a swanky new happening joint. The person to commend for this stellar trip was none other than my amazing server, Elias. The man is a master of his craft. I can't praise him enough. The food was great, the drinks were  exquisite, and the atmosphere was superb. Like I said, though the whole experience wouldn't have been same if it weren't for Elias. The man took me on a culinary joy ride, dropped me off at a reasonable time, and didn't even ask to come upstairs (I'm speaking hypothetically of course). What a class act. I'll definitely be coming back and asking for that dream of a man."
Amy C.,"Newark, United States",1518,982,1731,5.0,21/4/2013,"Oh The Cheesecake Factory, how I love you so!  The menu is extensive with many variety of dishes to choose from and of course a whole lot of different cheesecakes to fulfill how ever big your sweet tooth may be! I love the outdoor seating area overlooking Union Square especially at night time because it's kinda of romantic seeing the city at night with it's sparkling city lights.  Service has been always great all the times I've been here & other TCFs. My most recent visit I had the Mac & Cheeseburger which was sooo freakin delish! Soo cheesy & I LOVE it! Then I also had their 50th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and it was so very chocolatey; definitely get this if you're a chocaholic like me! ;) Sometimes, the wait time can be long depending on the time of day & what days you come in, but that's a given cause it's a popular place. You can find parking in the Union Square garage or if you try really hard- you can find a street spot if you're lucky."
Janice C.,"San Francisco, United States",253,72,1962,5.0,4/4/2013,"This is probably the only restaurant chain that is Yelp worthy.  No other restaurant chain can compare to The Cheesecake Factory. I've dined at many Cheesecake Factory locations over 15 years and this location is by far my favorite.  It's located on the 8th floor of the Macy's building in Union Square.  You can dine outside (they've got heaters out there for cold nights) & see great views of union square.  I especially like dining here during the Christmas season where you can see the Christmas tree and people ice skating below. A lot of people complain that this place is too busy & there's a long wait but there's a reason for that...it's that good!!!  If you don't want to wait come during off-peaks hours (late night), find a seat at the bar, or take your order to go.   Once you're seated you get to enjoy fresh baked loaves of wheat & sourdough bread served with a side of butter. Their entire menu selection is large.  That's what I love about this place.  You'll never get bored of their menu.  There's so many items I want to try but have not had the chance to.  Their portion sizes are huge and their prices are very reasonable. My menu favorites: Appetizers:   Thai lettuce wraps-this could be a meal of its own because the portions are large.  Large slices of chicken satay served with veggies, coconut curry noodles, & 3 delicious dipping sauces - peanut, sweet red chili, & tamarind cashew. Fire cracker salmon rolls-spinach & crispy wrapped salmon served with sweet chili sauce.  definitely a must-try. Entree: Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta-my all time favorite!  Chicken n shrimp spiced with cajun seasoning, onions, tomato, n peppers served over pasta.  This can also be served over rice but I love their regular & spinach pasta.  Save some leftovers cuz it's even more amazing the next day! Dessert: They've got a huge cheesecake selection as well as other desserts. I like the fresh strawberry & the white chocolate caramel macadamia but cheesecakes. Drinks: Their bar does not disappoint!  Their bartenders are definitely stingy with their alcohol!  I can never finish a single cocktail because the alcohol definitely will get to me.  I like their specialty drink -Factory peach Bellini (champagne, peach, n peach liquer). They offer a special complimentary dessert for any bday celebrants :) There's so much more The Cheesecake Factory has to offer that my review can't justify.  Go visit one today!!!"
Isaac H.,"San Francisco, United States",45,523,459,5.0,28/3/2013,When I first came here for my 22nd birthday. There was a long wait. I did not care. Come here for the good food and the chocolate cake. Also there is a good view of Union Square from here.
Warrick P.,"Henderson, United States",19,5,24,5.0,28/3/2013,"As a frequent flyer at the CKF I can say with some authority that this location is top on my list. There is only one negative and that's the long wait... But that a testimony to how good it is. The grub is always brilliant, but it's the views from the outdoor seating coupled with some of the best service in SF that gets this CKF top marks every time. Wait staff at CKF on Union Square, you guys rock !"
Paula M.,"London, United Kingdom",76,334,1727,5.0,28/3/2013,"Been a big fan of the cheesecake factory since discovering it in the US many years ago.  Words cannot describe the feeling of tucking into one of their many varieties of cheesecake.  My only disappointment, but testament surely to how fantastic I can only assume the restaurant is, is that on visiting the restaurant twice in one week (weekend and weekday) it was packed and looked to be that you had to wait a while for a table. :( boo.   First visit I settled for just a cheesecake take out (which was so big and rich that as much as I tried, I ate it over two days!!) the second I was more determined so left with a main meal take out as well as a cheesecake of course.   This was a good value take away meal I felt and thoroughly enjoyed the naughtiness of consuming my delightful takeaway in the privacy of my hotel room.  Hoping one day I will actually eat in a restaurant big bang theory style ;)"
Domo H.,"Phoenix, United States",126,45,81,5.0,19/3/2013,"Our waiter, didn't catch his name, was awesome. He took good care of us. I imagine he had a large section so sometimes it was a while before we saw him, but it was okay.. His friendly smile made up for that. The food is the same, no matter which factory we go to (amazing). I appreciate their consistency. Yes, they're a bit busy (long wait, etc) but that's a sign of a good restaurant, in my opinion. For the portions that you get the prices are really good! The drinks are where they getcha!"
Angela L.,"San Francisco, United States",81,41,39,5.0,8/3/2013,"i always leave this place super full! the servers are always really friendly. I've always LOVE their Louisiana chicken pasta! I went there today at around 3 with my boyfriend and we were able to get the lunch special which ends at 5pm. I was pretty happy that the louisiana chicken pasta is on the lunch special so instead of pay around $16 for it, its only $11.50. The portion that came out was able the same as the original dish so i was pretty happy with it.  The wait on a friday was only 5 mins compare to a weekend which takes an hr or more for a table."
Sarah V.,"East Oakland, Oakland, United States",0,9,3,5.0,22/1/2013,"Pasta, cheesecake, and cosmos. What more can a girl want?"
Shi Shi P.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,224,15,5.0,19/1/2013,"I came here the other day because it was conveniently located to where we were shopping...not my first choice.  I received some bad news so we stepped in for a much needed drink at the bar. We were greeted by the most charismatic, sincere, beautiful sharp server. Her name was something like Ashwini (i checked the receipt)  She was intuitive and did not bother us when we were talking but made sure to check in when the time seemed right She was super funny and even got my vodka gimlet order right which no one seems to get down the first time. She cheered me up not even knowing that she was doing so.  We ordered cheesecake to go and ummm...delicious!!! We ordered the pineapple upside down and the original with strawberries...soooo good! I will def be back because of her!!!"
Mimi W.,"South San Francisco, United States",2,162,6,5.0,12/12/2012,"Love this place, chicken potstickers, sliders, calamari and bistro shrimp pasta are a must have when dinning here"
Chris L.,"San Francisco, United States",665,1731,1158,5.0,11/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory has so many great memories - it's like an adult McDonald's.  Bad for you calorie-wise but good experience.  We have come here several times and when the wait is long, we'll wait around the bar area like vultures for a spot.  Once I get a Georgia Peach drink, I'm good to go and usually I order the pasta.  And the salmon firecracker rolls.  And I eat the brown bread with butter.  I feel like such a fatty writing this review but I love Cheesecake Factory!  Esp the view of Union Square and all the tourists who look confused while waiting for their table.  It's really a madhouse eating here - last time, I was walking and realized I had kicked a small child with my stiletto when he jailbroke from his dad and ran between people.  I'm surprised he didn't fall!  or cry... haha"
Tina B.,"Patterson, United States",5000,152,90,5.0,18/11/2012,"I love the cheesecake factory. Everything I've tried here is really good. I usually order four cheese pasta and pasta da vinci every single time I come to the cheesecake factory but I wanted to try something different this time. I ordered stuffed mushroom and fried crispy artichoke heart as appetizers. Both was deliciously yum yum. I would order it again. For my entree, I couldn't decide what to eat and came across the Factory combo which had Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira serve with mash potatoes. That sounded good and I ordered it. The steak was one of the best steak I've ever had in my entire life. It was cooked to perfection. Full of flavor, juicy and it was like a party in my mouth. Just writing a review on it makes me want some more. The chicken madeira was pretty good. Not the best but it's good. Some part of it was bland, some part tasted a lot like wine and some have a lot of flavor. Whoever did the mixing for this chicken didn't do a good job at it. The mushrooms on the chicken madeira and steak was really good. I love mushrooms in case you haven't noticed. I can eat mushrooms with almost anything. Not a big fan of their mashed potatoes. TOO HARD and not a whole lot flavor to it. Just kinda boring.  The bread they give you before your food comes out is the best. I can eat that all day and night and won't get sick of it.  My husband ordered the mushroom burger and he said that it tasted really good. Not so dry like other restaurant burgers. The fries was cooked well but please HOLD THE SALT. The french fries was drowning in salt. NO BUENO. For dessert we had the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake and OMG this was HEAVEN. I was already full but I couldn't put the fork down after one bite. It was addicting and crazily yummy. I will definitely order it again next time. This cheesecake factory is located on the upper level above Macy's building in SF. So of course parking definitely sucks and it is always crowded. Expect a long wait whenever coming here."

Alix J.,"San Francisco, United States",107,183,30,5.0,14/10/2012,"Besides waiting an hour and 10 minutes, which is normal I think on a Friday night I took my mom out for her birthday. We sat outside on the deck, it was perfect because it wasn't too cold and the heat lamps were on. The lights of the surrounding buildings and view of the square was beautiful at night! I had the garlic noodles for my meal and my mom ordered a chicken dish with mash potatoes, the skinny margaritas we ordered were amazing!  Will our waiter was so nice and helpful, I told him it was my mom's birthday and we ordered pumpkin cheesecake to share. Will along with another waiter and waitress came with the cake and sang Happy birthday after they lit the candle! When I paid the bill Will came back and said my name along with thank you."
Jenny L.,"Placentia, United States",350,226,226,5.0,7/10/2012,"I've reviewed this place a few times already but I can't help it! Such a perfect location for a nice evening date. After about a 20-25 min wait on a Friday night, we scored seats on their rooftop terrace.  We had such a nice view as we were eating dinner, I couldn't have been more pleased with my pick for dinner that night. I got my usual, the chicken bellagio, and it did not let me down. I love how much pesto flavor I can taste in the pasta and the crispyness of the chicken with the salty prosciutto just makes the dish so addicting. But I always have trouble finishing this massive plate of food. It can literally feed 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are.  I also tried his smokehouse bbq burger which was pretty damn good, not even going to lie. Especially if you're a guy. This is a man's burger. The fries were super crispy but not crispy so that there was nothing left inside.  All in all, a must try if you've never been to cheesecake factory, especially at this location. Definitely should get a seat outside if you can, it wasn't chilly at all! Just slightly cool but there were heaters everywhere that did a good job of keeping us warm without making us sweat or anything."
