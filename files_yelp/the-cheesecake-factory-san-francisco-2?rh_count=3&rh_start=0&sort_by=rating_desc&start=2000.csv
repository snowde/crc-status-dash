Tom L.,"Santa Clara, United States",410,480,171,2.0,7/11/2011,"I think there is a shorter waiting period  to purchase a handgun in California than for a table at The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not a fan of the food here ... at all. The menu is huge, and everything they serve has the boring flavors you would expect from a large chain.  I am a fan of their cheesecake selection. Every piece looks like it will give you instant diabetes, but it's the price you have to pay for deliciousness. The Oreo Cookie cheesecake is the best, buy a piece for your girlfriend and she will forgive you for not going to Sex and the City 5 with her."
Natasha M.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",353,379,76,2.0,4/11/2011,"I am not a fan of chains, the bigger they are the less like them. For what it is, it has a darn good view. Otherwise.... it is same same food, huge menu so good if you have a picky traditional eater. I just do not get why it is SOOO popular, it is not that good.  The salads are always over dressed too the point of... want salad with that dressing? The plates are cold when you serve pasta? WTF!  Great now my pasta is turning cold, thanks. I really loved the corn bread tamale spicy thing. That was yummy and kinda different even."
Mari S.,"San Francisco, United States",180,199,351,2.0,18/10/2011,"Be prepared to wait.........and wait.........and wait.........and wait.....some more..... and a little more........ I'm not kidding. Cheesecake Factory DOES have good food, big portions and DELICIOUS cheesecake. BUUUUUUT the WAIT is just ridiculous.  Yesterday my Mom & I came to Cheesecake Factory in hopes to have a few drinks and appetizers around 5pm. We got our pager with an estimated 15 minute wait (manageable), then another few minutes wait between the time they paged us back and we were seated (manageable again). But what the real problem was occured once we were seated. We asked for an outside table because it was a beautiful afternoon in the City. Upon being seated, we sat, and waited...and waited...and waited... NO ONE - NOT A SINGLE SOUL came to our table to even GREET US, ask us if we would like water, apologize for the delay, NOTHING.  After about 10 - 15 minutes of just sitting and being completely ignored by servers & all different types of wait staff walking by back & forth (and even greeting a table seated 5 minutes after us), we said ""f*ck it"" (well I did) and we decided to walk out.  I know that Cheesecake Factory always comes with a wait, but seriously, I don't find it acceptable to make a guest wait that long without even a ""hello, your server will be with you shortly"", ""we apologize for the wait"" or  ""would you like some water?"". Bad bad badd. This is the first time I've walked out of a restaurant in years, and HUNGRY too!! Thanks for wasting my time, Cheesecake Factory."
Michelle W.,"Daly City, United States",225,280,4,2.0,4/10/2011,"I used to love coming here years ago... huge portions, decent prices, good food. It seems as though the portions have shrunk, prices are still the same, food isn't as fantastic as I remembered.  The dishes I did enjoy were the sweet corn tamales, fried calamari, and chicken tenders.  Not to mention, this particular one is always crowded due to its prime location.  The wait is much shorter, say compared to the Cheesecake Factory in Sac. The factor that brings it down the most are the watered down alcoholic beverages.  Several times I've ordered the peach bellini, which barely had any alcohol content.  I've ordered other drinks, which were stronger, but the price is quite absurd for a sugary mixed drink. If I go back, I'll have to take a straight up shot."
Crystal C.,"South San Francisco, United States",451,224,184,2.0,6/9/2011,"This was my favorite restaurant growing up. And I used to love eating here. After this experience. Not so much! They messed up my meal, (I'm picky). And the spaghetti was way too salty. Service was slow. I would trade this with Bjs anyday! It was better back when I didn't know what good was.."
Dominique W.,"Pleasanton, United States",62,43,10,2.0,29/8/2011,Service kind of sucked our waiter brought out a dirty glass twice. Dirty utensils. Food was ok. Much better in Pleasanton. Our waiter did start doing good until she walked by and I said no tip. Then she became hands on...
Jessil P.,"Daly City, United States",3,14,2,2.0,1/8/2011,"I CANNOT believe what I had went through at this Cheesecake Factory. Not only was it super crowded with a bunch of bodies everywhere, I mean literally EVERYWHERE, but after we were given our buzzer the wait was an hour and a forty-five minutes long. Nearly 2 hours! It would have just been an hour and a half but we spent the last fifteen minutes of our waiting time waiting for someone to show us to our table. Anywho, once we sat down everything began to go much smoother. Our food was brought to us the way we asked and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was kind and funny as well. Although the food was delicious, I'm sorry to say but I will most likelu not be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory for a lonnnnng time."
Katie M.,"San Francisco, United States",212,135,322,2.0,27/7/2011,"I was here a while back for my friend's birthday, and it was a really fun experience, mostly because we were a big group and we really enjoyed the breathtaking view of Union Square. Everyone ordered some sort of steak, and the portions were varied depending on the cut. I was really satisfied with my Grilled Rib-Eye Steak... but then again, I love steak. I'm an easy girl to please. I had the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake for dessert, which was all right.  The line is always really long, with a 30+ minute wait no matter the size of your party. You can opt to sit in the balcony dining area outside for a shorter wait, but c'mon, it's SF. It's usually freezing at night. At least there's a bar to pass some time at, but drinks are overpriced. I don't think I'd go back just because it wasn't worth the money. I think this place is way too overhyped, just because of the chain's reputation and its location. I've been to some really expensive but also really spectacular steak places that I'd definitely visit again - Cheesecake is not one of them."
Jeff C.,"Orem, United States",115,230,37,2.0,25/7/2011,2 things that are good. The view and the cheesecake. I had a very bland hamburger. The portions are huge!Overpriced mostly a tourist trap. Go if you want but in San Francisco there are many better opportunities.
Noor M.,"Champaign, United States",10,68,36,2.0,21/7/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. It has some exquisite cheesecakes and thats it. Most of their entrees are overpriced and taste average at best, the restaurant is also crowded and extremely noisy, yet most of us insist of dining here. Is it the beautiful view, overlooking Union Square that attracts us, or then, is it just the thought of going to the famous ""cheesecake factory"" which coaxes us into wasting our money? The wait varies between 10 minutes to 45 minutes. During this time, one can go order drinks at the bar, or then, wait around staring at the view. Once seated, we are presented with a basket of delicious breads and a some butter.  Most of the dishes are over-priced (as I mentioned before) and the presentation is nothing fantastic, either, however, the helpings tend to be HUGE. Now that we are smarter (after having been to Cheesecake Factory several times) My husband and I tend to order one appetizer, one main course and one dessert.  The dishes were have tried are -  Potato Soup - - don't bother ordering it Clam Chowder - - not bad  Fettuccini Alfredo  - - absolutely bland Shrimp with Angel Hair - - shrimp were tiny but well seasoned Fresh Grilled Salmon - - pretty standard Shrimp Scampi - - once again, pretty standard Fish and Chips - - below average The desserts we have tried -  Linda Fudge Cake - -  must try The original cheesecake - - delicious and oh-so-light 30th Anniversary chocolate cheesecake - - perfection Godiva Chocolate cheesecake - - I think I died and went to chocolate heaven Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake - - mmm... Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake - - scrumptious Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake - -  my new favorite! The drinks we have tried -  hot chocolate - - delicious strawberry lemonade - - out of the box lemonade - - weirdly sweet I would recommend that you go to enjoy the view and the dessert, possibly having dinner somewhere else before coming here; it'll be easy on your stomach and your wallet. Overall rating - 3/4"
Kevin D.,"San Francisco, United States",72,102,12,2.0,17/7/2011,"Alright overrated restaurant...rude. This place is so pedestrian and subpar. The wait to eat here is so absurd, and you'd think the wait to get in this pseudo heaven of a restaurant would be worth it in the end, but it's not. Just go to the Elephant Bar and save your time. So not the business."
Jack W.,"San Francisco, United States",19,86,,2.0,12/7/2011,"Went on a Saturday night and experienced just about the longest wait for a dinner ever - 1.25hrs - because they don't take prior reservations. Ambiance isn't half bad, and the food was mediocre at best, though extremely greasy, fatty, and come in large portions. I had the lemon chicken and wasn't impressed, but I wasn't expecting anything great... it is the Cheesecake Factory after all. You get what you pay for. Time: 7:30pm, Sat. Food: lemon chicken Price: $18/person after taxes and tip"
Melissa F.,"Hayward, United States",0,13,,2.0,21/6/2011,Came here on a Friday night for a birthday only me and my friend. We didn't get there until exactly 730 and they told us to wait for an hour and we did (at this point we are starving too) and we got called at exactly 8:30 and didn't eat until about 9:45.  They lose 3 stars from me because the wait is always LONG! Yet I still love their service they have really friendly people that work there.
Julie C.,"Aurora, United States",139,74,7,2.0,9/6/2011,"I had only been to a Cheesecake factory a few times before moving to the city, but after coming to sf my friend who is in love with this place kept making us come here. This place is kind of love-hate for me. I really love the wheat bread they give you to start (so sweet and delicious) and I have to admit the cheesecakes are divine. But I'm not as impressed with the food. First off their menu seems to never end due to lots of ads cluttering the menu. This also makes it difficult to find a dish more than once while looking at the menu. I used to always get the four cheese pasta, but the last  time I had it they skimped out on the mozzarella and put too much ricotta for my liking. After that I usually tried different things. My problem was that most of the dishes are expensive, huge, heavy, and really unhealthy. By the time you have finished the ample bread and your entree, most likely you will be too stuffed to get  cheesecake. So i suggest getting something small and light and saving room for the delicious cheesecake. Another lesson learned, don't come here often it will burn a hole in your wallet and a will leave you needing to buy a looser pair of jeans at the macy's downstairs."
Shad B.,"New York, United States",213,96,6,2.0,29/5/2011,"Although I like the food and the cheesecake, I am not sure if the 1 1/2 hour wait is worth it.  It is always crowded and the service was mediocre."
Don Y.,"Daly City, United States",111,31,23,2.0,23/5/2011,The food is great service is great 2 Starts why? they do not value their customers after spending 230 dollars in 3 hours with friends from back home my glass was chipped i cut my lip i showed it to the manager and  he did not care he gave me a $25 gift card hahahaha really its that how they value their customers ever again ever ever -10 how could you think that your bartender its not going to check the glass where you serve my drink i was mad i am still furious about this imagine if  i had drink that piece of glass where would i be now?  Unacceptable never again. BY THE WAY ALWAYS CHECK YOUR GLASS YOU NEVER KNOW.
Maggie J.,"San Francisco, United States",1,9,,2.0,20/5/2011,"Too busy, noisy, and not organized. We would have had to wait 45 minutes to sit on a Thursday afternoon around 2- the hostess kept trying to get us to try the bar and I was not going to wait that long on an empty tummy.  I like the terrace- the view is great, but I hate the pigeons and seagulls trying to steal my food. Last time we got a table on the terrace tourists kept standing right next to our table to take pictures.. C'mon people I'm trying to eat in here! The time before that we had a table inside and we didn't have a server for about 10-15 mins and all of a sudden 2 waiters were trying to fight over our table-- not very organized. By far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
Ben M.,"Fox Island, United States",76,6,,2.0,27/4/2011,"Let me start off by saying two stars is generous. The absolute biggest problem with our experience here was the long wait and horrible service at the front desk.  When we arrived, we were told we would have an hour wait. We thought it was a little long, but we decided we needed to run over to the Apple store anyway, so we did it. We left, came back half an hour later. We asked, and were (rudely) told that it would be twenty minutes longer. Forty minutes later, our buzzer finally went off - the total wait was about an hour and ten minutes. We were then told to wait to the left of the counter, which we did, for five more minutes. The waitress came and took us halfway to our table, when she stopped and told us to wait in the hallway because she had forgotten what table she was taking us too. When she came back, she led us to our table, where we were again asked to wait while it was cleaned. Finally, we were able to sit down.  The bad part was over. From here on, we found that the waitress was friendly, and the food (pepperoni pizza) was fairly good. However, we would absolutely never return and be asked to wait an hour and ten minutes.  As a side note, I hope you're not claustrophobic, because you are obliged to cram into the elevator with fifteen other people for the ride up to the top of Macy's. Every elevator is full, and you often spend five or more minutes waiting for another elevator."
Anisha G.,"Oakland, United States",88,375,25,2.0,27/4/2011,"The service here was ridiculous. We sat at the bar, and ordered lunch. The bar tender forgot to put in my order -- it was too obvious. I waited there for 15 minutes after my cousin got her burger and asked for it a couple times. I was told, it walked away.  I finally got my sandwich, it was good, nothing amazing. I got sweet potato fries too which were okay too. They compensated our beers which was a nice gesture."
Michelle M.,"Belmont, United States",197,1852,605,2.0,25/4/2011,"What....a.....mess!  The wait here is always super long.  At least 1 hour (sometimes 3 hours during x-mas season).  Once you get seated, you think you are safe, but really you are not.  These poor city kids working as waiters are run to pieces, thus don't give you the quality service you think you might get after patiently waiting to be seated. My friend never got her meal, out of our group of six  The cook forgot to make her order.  To compensate her, they gave her a free slice of cheesecake, but it didn't fix her hungry stomach.  While at the table we saw people bringing their checks up to the waiters, you aren't supposed to do that!  But because this place is so out of it, I guess that is okay here? In conclusion, I'd only order slice of cheesecake here TOGO.  It is not worth it to subject yourself to this unorganized madness.  Out of towners can have at it for the view and ""experience.""  But local peeps, you know much better places to check out in the smaller districts."
