Sarah V.,"Englewood, United States",0,79,,2.0,22/4/2011,"Just your average Cheesecake Factory, but atop the Macy's at Union Square. It's generally filled with tourists, so be prepared to wait a long while. I would highly recommend the outdoor seating area for one of those spring/summer days!"
Glenn P.,"Mountain View, United States",40,23,,2.0,18/4/2011,"Unless you're sitting outside with a view of Union Square, its just another Cheesecake factory.  The outside seating is what makes this place special, nothing else!!! The place is always packed, usually you have to wait some 30 minutes just to get a place to sit.  Honestly, its not really worth the wait or the drive to SF just to go there.  You could just find another Cheesecake Factory somewhere else.   Its basically just another chain!!!!"
Nick B.,"San Francisco, United States",47,81,3,2.0,16/4/2011,"For the price, this place should be way better. We waited almost an hour for food, and were barely checked on. One of our salads arrived with no dressing, and it took them about 15 minutes to get bread on the table. Our meals were unimpressive - a cobb salad with very little bacon or egg, and all the ceasar salads were drab. Their bread was delicious, however.  Overall this place seems terribly overrated to me, and I doubt it would ever exist if it weren't in such a pricey location. People love paying more for a name like Cheesecake Factory, even if the food totally doesn't warrant it. The place is typical, crowded, standard, and ho-hum. You'd be far better off spending half as much at a local eatery, and saving yourself the hassle of waiting an hour and getting subpar service and food."
Patrick M.,"Escondido, United States",11,9,,2.0,15/4/2011,"a huge menu. Normally I know exactly what I want within a minute of receiving the menu... but this one took FOREVER to weed out my meal for the evening.... everything sounded so good! Emphasis on ""sounded."" The biggest downside was the wait, but that's to be expected on a Saturday evening during the Christmas season. The cheesecake was too ""mushy"" for my taste. And I'm no Cheesecake elitest... if it's cheesecake, it's going in my mouth in copious amounts! It was a ""meh"" experience overall. We had gift cards, which brightened the experience a bit, but the long wait and so-so food (especially the dessert... I mean C'MON! how are you gonna mess up cheesecake when it's IN YOUR NAME!?!?!?) brought the night down a bit.  I've experienced Cheesecake factory. I'm not convinced it's something I'll ever feel compelled to do so again"
Janice K.,"Santa Clara, United States",64,16,,2.0,13/4/2011,"Cheesecake Factory never really disappoints me till I came to the one in San Francisco. The wait can get pretty ridiculous, but that's normal for some places. I've decided to eat outside so I wouldn't have to wait any longer than I have to, because I was pretty hungry. It was pretty cold out there, which is expected for SF towards the evening time. What annoyed me the MOST is how long I had to wait for a server to come to our table, and get us water. Come on PEOPLE water!!! Then it took forever to get our food ordered, and to top it off getting OUR FOOD!!! I've never waited so long for food. I thought maybe they were short staffed and it was terribly busy, BUT I was wrong. I came another time and it was the SAME shananigans -_- so disappointing, so I've come to conclusion that I will avoid eating at Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco."
Grace C.,"Seattle, United States",145,23,9,2.0,13/4/2011,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Most CF's promise a classy ambiance, the same menu regardless of location and MOUTHWATERING cheesecakes. However, each place doesn't always deliver the same service, which is what my 2 stars are here for. When I first heard about this Union Square Cheesecake Factory on top of Macy's, it sounded like a elegant must-see. Unfortunately, the bazillion people waiting in the lobby were thinking the same thing.  My biggest frustration was the server we had. I am usually forgiving to flustered staff (they deal with a lot) but this one was quite cold. Very cold! Icy glares, icy response, icy service. I noticed, however, she was cherry and responsive to her other tables behind us. I'm not a big fan of basing a food review on this one-time personal experience but it definitely put a sour note to my night. Plus, the cheesecake I ordered was the smallest piece a Cheesecake Factory has ever presented to me.  With so much to explore in beautiful San Francisco, there are many awesome local restaurants and small businesses to support that I'd much rather eat at."
Daniel L.,"San Francisco, United States",73,107,33,2.0,11/4/2011,"People always rave about this place. All of my friends talk about this place. Whenever i am going to or leaving work ( i work at Downtown), i always hear people talk about the cheesecake factory. This restaurant is super overrated.  I mean i understand, it is one of those Class B-C fancy restaurants but honestly, the food is not that great. I have eaten here about 7 times and not once did i enjoy my experience there. Why? The food was not good and very pricey. Now to the cheesecake, it is called the cheesecake factory after all. They have a lot of selections for cheesecake. I have to admit that they do have a few unique and tasty cheesecakes. However, for close to 7 dollars a slice, most of the selections are not worth it at all! I would recommend just going to a local bakery or Costco to get some cheesecake. They place is way too overrated, does not live up to it's hype at all."
Rebecca H.,"Dublin, United States",345,2142,212,2.0,6/4/2011,"The food is ok, it's mass produced huge quantity stuff, but consistant across all locations. You always know what you will get.  The service is fairly horrendous.  Forgetting things, taking them to the wrong table, taking forever to bring dressing for the salad, it just wasn't a great experience.  It's a good place to bring kids, it's loud and crazy and another screaming kid added to the mix doesn't really change the environment much.  Avoid the bathroom, it was so gross and stinky, it seriously smells like a cat box."
Sabrina A.,"Mountain View, United States",512,1197,211,2.0,10/3/2011,"I've eaten at a few Cheescake Factories and really, I like it.  Sure, it's huge portions of pretty good food with pretty good cocktails.  I've liked the sandwiches, the pastas, the steak and tons of other dishes.  Usually the staff has been good, I like the decor and in general I have a pleasant experience? Why the 2 stars? During Christmas time my family came up to enjoy the decorations, Macy's SPCA window, the big Christmas tree and take my niece to see all the pretty things I did as a child.  We were all having a great time until Cheesecake Factory. We come up and see tons of people waiting, ok we understand.  It's an hour and a half wait but we can get a pager and come back.  Ok, great.  We come back and wait and wait.  10 minutes after we are told it will be longer, 20 minutes after we are told it will be a little longer - all with rude attitudes.  I get it though, it's busy, people want to eat and I can imagine it's sorta stressful . . . . But it takes forever for our waitress to help us.  It takes 45 minutes to get our food we ordered right away.  They forget salad dressing and fries of two different dishes randomly and when I ask?  No one comes back or not until the very end.  Service was so spotty and horrible.  Though our waitress was friendly, she wasn't to be seen or help.   The waiting and lack of service really killed the experience and while the food was good, it sure put a dent in our Holiday plans that day and mood.  While it was busy, the wait and service was unreasonably bad."
Gloria Y.,"San Francisco, United States",100,148,77,2.0,27/2/2011,"I used to look forward to dining here.  The menu is extensive and the portions never disappoint.  However, this time I was not impressed.  This was about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night.  We came here for a post-movie midnight snack.  We were seated about 40 minutes before closing time, which most likely explained the rushed service we got.  I almost slipped twice walking to our table and walking from our table to the restroom.  The restroom was gross.  Open toilet paper rolls were literally sitting on the floor. Yuck.   We ordered the thai chicken wrap, which was surprising flavorful and tender.  The mini corndogs were bleh...I wouldn't be surprised if they were the frozen ones sold at Costco.  I really wanted to have a slice of cheesecake, but I felt like the waiter wanted to see us go so he can go home.  This place is no longer the place I looked forward to visiting anymore.  There are so many other worthwhile places deserving of my hard-earned money."
Erika G.,"Livermore, United States",368,754,449,2.0,23/2/2011,"Working lunch today again... No wait at 1130am - score! Server was very nice and attentive.  Brought bread, gave us time to figure out what to order -  we were chatting so much we didn't even get to look at the menu's yet.  Refilled drinks without asking, checked to make sure we were ok.  So that was good. BUT I ordered the Rosie's Special (or something like that) half sandwhich - carved roasted turkey on a STALE baguette, cup of soup - baked potato was creamy and thick but the potatos crunched!  They werent in there long enough to be cooked fully.  and small side salad.   Generally it would be good but stale bread, undercooked potatos not so good!   2 stars because I now have tummy issues since lunch!  So much so I ALMOST had to use a BART STATION BATHROOM! OMG! But I made it home. Whew, thank goodness!  I think I am gonna stop coming here for a while. Which is too bad because I usually take meetings here - now I think I will suggest somewhere else."
Jean L.,"Burbank, United States",424,331,141,2.0,20/2/2011,"Your standard Cheesecake Factory, with about 1-1.5 hour long waits if you come in the middle of the lunch or dinner rush. The view is nice enough, but a lot of other restaurants are more romantic with less commercial fluff n' stuff (e.g. the Grandviews at the Hyatt, Top of The Mark at the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins) that promise a great view. Plus, you won't have to freeze and enjoy the view (sitting on the patio can be blisteringly cold at times). All the aforementioned places have floor-to-ceiling windows.  I would come here if I just wanted something safe + cheesecake and didn't care about waiting in a crowded place for it. I would go somewhere else if I wanted to try unique foods in a wonderful, relaxed atmosphere."
stefanie h.,"San Francisco, United States",30,192,,2.0,19/2/2011,"i'm dumbfounded by this place.  truly dumbfounded.  by all cheesecake factories actually.  but especially by the union square one.  in a city full of unique restaurants, this must be one of the most consistently busy restaurants.  granted, they do have a nice view of union square...but really, cheesecake factory?  and the SF location isn't the anomaly...every cheesecake factory seems to have absurdly long waits 24/7. i picked up a slice of cheesecake to-go (i had to try the namesake ""stefanie's red velvet""), and waited 15 minutes for them just to open the freezer, take out the pre-cut slice, and pack it up.  15 minutes. things that i will give cheesecake factory: decent cheesecake and wide selection.  and by wide selection, i mean, like, a 50-page menu. cheesecake factory is like the mecca of chain-restaurants.  mediocre food, exaggerated decor, and cheesy theme x10.  would be fine if the wait wasn't always 45 mins +.  but if you're a tourist, please try one of SF's many unique offerings; there are other cheesecake factories elsewhere, and the wait isn't any shorter over here."
Clare C.,"San Francisco, United States",13,72,,2.0,11/2/2011,"Service has a lot to be desired. Of the last four times I've frequented the Cheese Cake Factory in the last couple of months, I've either had and overly aggressive, in your face tip chasers or server who forgets you're there!  Also, it's really not necessary for a server to come check on a meal four times...literally!!  I experienced that during the week when I was having an important business meeting.   On a positive note, the food is typically pretty good. The turkey burger is great, pasta da vinci is typically very good, the ahi tuna appetizers are great. The Godiva cheesecake is to die for!"
Teo B.,"New York, United States",10,39,,2.0,17/1/2011,"weak 10 $ sangria, bad food. but it looks nice. and tehy have a  nice patio(if you are in that touristy things)  I had a burger,and I was so sick all night after, felt so heavy. sangria was really really weak and the waiter really rude and he looked pissed off for whatever reason. It was December, so we just had to wait 30 min to get a sit at the patio, but our table was a table away from the heater so I freezed my ass out. Really american place, worth no personality. So many great places to have food in san francisco for so less money and in better places with better tables. Never again. ever."
Moko R.,"San Francisco, United States",1,200,6,2.0,31/12/2010,What's up with tourists loving cheesecake factory? haha. glad i didn't have to wait in line with the gazillion people there.  i picked up my tiramisu cheesecake and left. yay!!!
Alyssa G.,"San Francisco, United States",58,94,,2.0,31/12/2010,"I hate to give such a poor rating to a place with delicious drinks and desert and which I have had great experiences in the past, but the service a this location is TERRIBLE. I understand what a busy location it is, being in union square, and I can be very forgiving. However, waiting for 2 hours to get seated, then continuing to wait for a drink (the wrong drink), and finally waiting for our completely absent server to mosey over so we could simply get the check left me feeling very neglected. My friend was promised shoestring onions for his burger that never came, and although the food is good (especially the Buffalo Blasts appetizer) I think in the future I will pass on the Cheesecake Factory."
Surge C.,"San Diego, United States",305,588,1302,2.0,26/12/2010,"DISCLAIMER: REVIEW BASED ONLY ON THE TERRIBLE SERVICE, NOT FOOD. I love Cheesecake Factory. However, this is not the location I would choose to go to again. Our wait was less than 10 minutes for my boyfriend and I, yet the hostess forgot she told us that and immediately sat the couple who came in after us and asked for a seat. Strike 1. When I mentioned this, she apologized and proceeded to take us to an open table with one of the worst waiters I have ever had. I wish I could remember his name...UGH. We repeatedly asked for break, which he did not bring until the VERY END of our meal. Are you kidding me?! Then he kept forgetting to bring my cocktail and kept apologizing for it. Well, if you were TRULY sorry, I doubt you would make this mistake about 3 times. He was another waiter that had a disappearing act problem. We did not even get the tab from him. Of course I left, unsatisfied, pissed off, and normally I will leave some sort of tip because I feel bad, but he gave us such terrible service, I made sure to leave the EXACT amount in cash. Cheesecake Factory in Union Square...you need to step up your game and obviously replace some people on your staff. For being in such a popular location, I would expect way more."
Cammy C.,"Sacramento, United States",424,229,304,2.0,21/12/2010,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times now, and honestly the only thing that keeps me coming back is the ambiance because its on the 8th floor of Macys and you get a nice view of Union Square. First of all, the wait for a table is almost ALWAYS 3+ hours...it doesnt help that the hostesses are rude and terribly inexperienced.  The food of course is like all the other Cheesecake Factories, its hit or miss depending on what you order. This past weekend we ordered 3 dishes and they were all either too salty, too cheesy, or the chicken was dry. And you pay quite a pretty penny for this food! Granted, the portions are fair for the price you pay, so I feel it's only worth it if you are eating with friends so you can order a few things and share. The best part of the meal is always dessert, who goes to Cheesecake Factory and doesn't order cheesecake right? My favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. There's 1700 calories in each slice but worth eveerrryy bite. But I guess that's why its called the ""Cheesecake"" Factory and not the ""Dry Chicken Marsala"" Factory."
