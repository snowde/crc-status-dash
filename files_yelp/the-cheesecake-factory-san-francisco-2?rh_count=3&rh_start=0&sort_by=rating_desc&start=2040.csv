James W.,"San Francisco, United States",26,18,,2.0,15/9/2010,"I finally found out why its called the Cheesecake factory. Its because you come here for Cheesecake ONLY as I so painfully learned. The food was marginal, and overpriced.  It was crowded with people and the lines were long.  The one extra star was for the prime location above Union Square."
Ilya K.,"San Francisco, United States",129,10,,2.0,14/9/2010,"Chain restaurant with an extravagant, over-the-top interior design Bland-tasting food in huge portions, as if to justify the $$ prices. Fancy location with good view over the Union Square but that's about the only thing remarkable about the experience of eating there."
Albert S.,"Union City, United States",0,15,,2.0,5/9/2010,"On top of Macy. I gave management a piece of me. The worst wait time, I ever had. The food was cold when I got it. They should told of the wait time,2 hours wait time.They should of told me what wait willI be, I will wait or stay loyal customer and be back..  I got a $50 refund from management. I used it on Palo Alto Cheese Cake Factory. Wait  time non-existentand food better."
Gourmet Princessa L.,"San Francisco, United States",25,198,245,2.0,30/8/2010,"Ugh! Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in ages and doubt the food quality there has changed and I was right! Friends got my aunt and I GC to Cheesecake Factory for our birthdays so we went and spent them there. As usual, the one at Macy's Union Square is a zoo. The lines are eternally long, the place filled with tourists eager to eat something familiar instead of exploring SF flavors and the service is spotty. I don't ever remember a time I go there that it wasn't at least a 45 minutes wait time. Why don't they take reservation is beyond me?  We got there at 6PM thinking that we go for an early dinner and hopefully the line is shorter, boy we were wrong. We were told at the time we checked in that there was a 50 minutes wait. The reservationist gave us a buzzer and sent us to the bar so that we could drink ourselves silly with the expensive beer and wine prices. What she neglected to tell us was that the bar tables at the bar area are opened for grabs on a first come first serve basis. Great customer service huh? Had we know that the bar area serve a full menu and doesn't require wait time, we would have grab the 2 tables that became vacant. That was ridiculous! We waited for 30 minutes and went back to check on the status and that was when she told us that if we wanted to sit outside on the patio, we could have been seated sooner. Hello! Why didn't you say that at the time we checked in? Playing hard to get? Again, things like this pegged my dumb-people meter in one day. While we were waiting for our table, we observed an immoral and uncivilized incident. An older gentleman approached one of the bar tables where a couple (white male and Filipino female) were seated to ask if he could have 1 of their 2 extra empty chairs so that he could take it to the other side and sit down while he waits endlessly for his table. The couple told him NO and that they needed both of the chairs. The older gentleman left and asked the next table and got assisted this time by a nice lady. As we watched the 2 mean, uncivilized and immorally disrespectful couple at the table stuffing their ugly faces with food, they weren't expecting any guests to join them, but they had their jackets and purses on each of the chair. Shamed on them! We were so angry and so disgusted with these people's behavior. I hope you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself for treating an older, weaker person and you weren't even asked to do anything for him, but give him one of your 2 unused chairs. Yes, you, the fatty white boy who looked at your I-Phone the whole time you were stuffing fatty food into your mouth and your Filipino girlfriend who thinks she looks like Kim Kadashe wearing her low-cut top, but has nothing to show for. Shame on you! You deserved to eat at places like the Cheesecake Factory AKA an upscale Danny's!  Finally a table became available and we sat outside even though it was cold. We just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there. By now, it was an hour later, we were hungry, tired from all the standing and pissed that we had to wait because someone didn't do a good job. The food was typically fast food in my opinion. I had: Steak Diane with medallion of steaks. I asked for medium and it came out well done. So they overcooked my steak. At this point, I didn't even bother to send it back knowing that the second order will come back the same.  My dining companions had: Jambalaya Linguine - the linguine pasta was a little overcooked, but at least the jambalaya has good flavor and lots of huge shrimps.  Steak Collate with Onions Rings and Sweet Potatoes Fries - The steak was ok, not very good quality meat and the onion rings has too thick of batter and sweet potatoes fries were too salty.  The soup of the day was Creamy Chicken Soup with Artichokes and Bellpepper - mah! The soup can lukewarm, very starchy, not creamy and bland.  We split a piece of strawberry cheesecake and could barely finished that. The cheesecake wasn't very light or fluffy and the strawberries were covered in way too much syrup and too sweet and lost its natural strawberry flavors. At least our server is friendly, efficient and very professional. So we got good services and he was very intuitive about what we need before we even asked. Overall, not my favorite restaurant especially if I had to dine with the kind of low class patrons they have. No thanks. Please don't give me anymore gift certificate to the Cheesecake Factory. The first time is a torture, the second time would be a disaster."
Chris B.,"South San Francisco, United States",35,89,39,2.0,20/7/2010,"FANCY without  the taste!  I like this place a lot it looks really nice and all, has a good vibe and even the food looks pretty tasty but then you bite into it and its just ehh.  I ordered the Bistro Shrimp and I wasn't impressed at all.  The shrimp was flavored really poorly and tasted really fishy.  This place is all hyped up and has a ton of people but its just not that good.  I dont know why but I have never got anything that good here, It kinda reminds me of Macaroni Grill but not as good.  The Service was amazing lady was on point and there in a second everytime I needed something which was nice."
Kristen M.,"San Jose, United States",18,21,,2.0,14/7/2010,"The San Francisco Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the worst locations of the restaurant to eat at if you want timely and courteous service. The food is great but the customer service and attentiveness of the waiters/ waitresses is definitely lacking.  The few times I've been here I've been mistreated as a customer but still I continue to return. The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant.  The nice thing about this place though is the view you have from the top of Macy's. It is pretty awesome. And like with any other Cheesecake Factory place the food and desserts are awesome."
Steph G.,"San Jose, United States",0,273,,2.0,13/7/2010,"The best advice that anyone can give you about this place is to avoid it like the plague during weekends, if you want to eat some time before the following Monday. OMG, the freakin line is crazy! Now, I probably should have known this, but my friend and I took the chance to go there on a Saturday night. We got there about 6pm. There was a huge crowd by the elevator. Once we were finally in the restaurant, I pushed my way through the crowd and asked how long it would take. The guy working there said 2 and a half hours before we can get a buzzer!!!! In short the buzzer will ring to let you know your table is ready. BUT you cannot leave the vicinity of the restaurant, otherwise the buzzer won't work... And we waited. And we waited. And we waited. And... we waited some more. And then we finally got a buzzer!!! And we waited... And we waited... Then we went to the restaurant to check out the desserts. Too bad the place was so crowded that you couldn't even see them.  We were finally seated around 9pm. Wow, all this wait, and for what? The food was ok, but it cannot make up for the long wait. 2 stars for the food and the wait staff, but honestly, you could have driven to a better restaurant across town, eaten and been home int he time that it took to eat here."
Arianna G.,"Modesto, United States",3,41,4,2.0,15/6/2010,"Let me start by saying I would not have gone to the restaurant of my own free will. Unfortunately the group that I was with had it dead set in their minds to go here, despite the awesome variety that the City has to offer. While the majority of the group seemed pleased by their meals I have to say that overall this place fails to deliver. This is a chain restaurant that is filled with people. Filled!!! I ordered a steak and I had them change whatever the heck was supposed to come with it so I got a side of veggies and a small salad as opposed to what it generally is. The steak was a bit over-cooked though still edible, the veggies drenched in butter, and the salad was a regular little house salad.  The service was horrible and it took forever to get refills of bread and water. (Mainly concerned about the beverages!) Quite frankly by the time I paid my bill I was happy to get the heck out of there and never go back. The only thing about this place worth anything was the view and you didn't really need to get a table to walk out to the balcony for a bit. Maybe if we'd just gone there was cheesecake it would have been tolerable, but quite frankly I can get cheesecake at lots of other places."
meesh m.,"Walnut Creek, United States",7,72,1,2.0,15/4/2010,Food is not great and alcoholic drinks are mostly just mix. The reason I continue to go back is because it's a good spot for guests to have lunch overlooking union square. Two stars mostly for ambiance. Today I had a decent waiter and food came out quick but I have mostly had poor service in the past. I'm always kind of mad at myself for going because I know the food will be a let down.
Miguel V.,"San Francisco, United States",318,164,51,2.0,22/3/2010,"I don't have much to say about this place. The line took forever, There was nothing exciting about the food, The staff was blah, and the food was over priced. I am a big fan of cheese cake, but was so bummed about the rest of the meal I didn't fall in love with the cheese cake.  The pigeons are a pain in the behind. Over all the view was pretty good, but there are plenty of other restaurants in the city with SPECTACULAR views."
Dessa S.,"San Francisco, United States",8,95,43,2.0,20/3/2010,Love the view because it's on top of Macy's but the food here is overpriced. Desserts are good of course but that really does not make up for the fact their food sucks! Their Orange Chicken was hard & their sauce just gross to say the least. Veggies weren't cooked properly and the rice was still undercooked. Been here twice hoping it would get better but both times were disappointments. NEVER GOING BACK.... SORRY!!!! big hype for no reason!
Jennifer L.,"Snohomish, United States",2,54,,2.0,19/3/2010,"The hostess staff here was really rude.  While we were waiting over an hour for the table they said would take 30 minutes, I watched one of the hostesses put on a big fake smile for each customer and immediately after they turned away she would roll her eyes at them.  Does she not realize that there are other people watching her besides the person she is currently talking to?? Geez.  In addition to that, the hostess staff seemed really unorganized.  They said it would take 30 minutes for a table and we waited an hour before our buzzer went off.  After that we were told that we had to stand over to the side to wait for our name to be called.  It was another 15 to 20 minutes before we were taken to a table, which only happened after we checked twice to make sure they hadn't forgotten about us.  The food was ok, and the server was nice enough, but it's hard to get past this first impression."
Chantay X.,"San Pablo, United States",15,130,18,2.0,26/2/2010,"I don't know how I feel about this place. I really don't think I've gotten a chance to get a good feel for it. I went the first time some years back on my birthday. Me and a friend sat at the bar. I ordered the chicken ""littles"" (little fried boneless pieces of chicken) it was decent enough, well seasoned and the portion was huge! It was just an okay experience. I went again last weekend for a friend's birthday and wanted to try the jambalaya pasta (sounds sooo good) but by the time dinner came I wasn't very hungry so didn't get to try that. Plus we were heading to a show afterwards so I didn't wanna have to carry any food bag around. So I ordered a small plate which was the little crabcake balls. It came with six balls and a little (literally) dipping sauce. It was so doughy it wasn't the most pleasant texture. I really didn't like it very much at all. Definitely wish I had gotten something else. I also hate the crowdedness of the place. People bumping into you and not saying excuse me and getting all up in your personal space. I wanted to push some folk. But I didn't. Also my party had to ask for bread and refills and more butter. Not cool. And I ordered a drink at the bar (martini) it was $9 and the bartender didn't even fill it up to a decent level.  Also the elevator was jacked up so we had to take the thousand mile escalator ride up to the top. And at the end of our meal one elevator was working and the line was crazy to get on it so we had to be escorted through the kitchen and all through the back way to get out. Macy's was closed so we couldn't take the escalator. It was a freakin' journey and could have been pretty dangerous if there had been a fire other emergency. This place needs to get it together."
Yelper Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,98,1,2.0,16/1/2010,"I went to eat at Cheesecake Factory tonight, and I went to the bar section where the seats are first come, first grab when it is available.  So the hostess said if you see a person about to leave at the seat at the bar area, then just grab it, since they do not have a wait list for the bar area.  So I took a walk around at the bar area, and I noticed a table where they just got their bill from their waiter.  So I stood like 3 feet away from them, not even staring at them, since my back was behind them.  The white female beetch customer said out loud, ""Please don't hover around our table, I hate hovers"".  I was not even facing her direction, since my back was behind them, but she knew that I was carrying a pager that shows that I was to get paged for my table.  So, that gave it away that I was waiting for a table, and that white racist beech had the nerve to say that.   The food is good, but Cheesecake Factory really needs to organize a wait list for the bar area, if they tell the customers to grab a table when you see they are about to leave.  I was not even hovering their table, I was 3 feet away watching the television at the bar, but she can tell that someone is waiting by my pager.    She had no manners at all, because it is known that people at the bar are going to grab a seat whenever it was available.  Then, a white kid was waiting there, and she didn't say anything to him, and she gave the white kid the table, she is so racist."
Susan L.,"New York, United States",229,493,50,2.0,12/1/2010,"Whenever I come to Cheesecake Factory, I can't help but feel like a fat American. Their corporate mission must be to load as many calories as possible into ever customer. They have all kinds of tricks - grated cheese on everything, portion sizes bigger than my torso, appetizers thrown into the deep fryer, oversized beverage glasses, and of course, 1,000 calorie cheesecake. Some things in that ginormous menu are delicious but the majority are worse than the Olive Garden. My team's favorites are: crab wontons (fried), avocado rolls (fried), calamari (fried), macaroni and cheese balls (fried) and buffalo strips (fried). See a pattern yet? Aside from all the food that makes me want to purge afterwards, their service is horrendous. We always make a reservation, 15 minutes before we plan to arrive, and every time they make us wait 30 minutes for our table. Wtf could possibly cause this wait? A 5-yr-old could figure out how to seat everyone on time better than they can. During our last visit, their computer system supposedly crapped out twice, causing all of our delays. Considering the vast empire of Cheesecake Factories across this country, how do they not have a functioning and reliable computer system? I was blown away but no matter how negative this review is, holy moly that slice of cheesecake was divine!!!"
S N.,"San Leandro, United States",14,153,122,2.0,31/12/2009,"It's too bad they don't take reservations after 5:00pm(?) We were a party of five, when we arrived about 7:00pm & we were immediately  told the wait is 1.5 hours. Since it was my daughter's birthday & this is where she wanted to eat. We decided to wait. If it was left to me I would not have waited. We got our name in the system & was told to come back in 1 hour & they would issue a beeper when our table was ready. So at 8:00 we got our issued beeper & roamed downstairs in the furniture dept where everyone else was sitting & waiting since the bar was jammed packed. When you get to this point the wait time zooms by. We got seated in least than 10 minutes. Once we were seated outside terrace they have several heaters going & the view is really what your there for. There was a group of women celebrating something right next to us & being very loud celebrating. The menu is really extensive with much to chose from. Our waiter Chris was very attentive & was willing to give advice on food selections., he was the bonus. We started off with crab & cheese won tons which came right away. If you are hungry this dish appeases the taste buds. Most of us ordered pasta by now the time was 8:45. My husband & I decided on sharing carne asada dish that comes with tortillas. I know not the kind of food I really wanted to eat. The food is more on presentation than taste period. At dessert we ordered their famous cheesecake, my daughter recieved a banana cheesecake with ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate! Good touch there! We weren't all overstuffed afterwards which is a good thing since the time was 10:30. All in all if you want the tourist experience then try it. But be very prepared to wait!"
Charmian W.,"San Francisco, United States",179,73,15,2.0,29/12/2009,"This place is one of those places where you pay a tad bit more for the view, because the food wasn't all that great. I came here for the first time today with my friends for lunch - only ordered the ""Lunch Special"" Garlic Noodles with Chicken; total including tax was $13.09. For a total of $15 and a spectacular view of Union Square, here's what I got: - Decent service. The waitress was cheerful and helpful enough, but I suppose there were a ton of other customers as well since she didn't come by that much.. Also, her tone kinda implied that we SHOULD order something to drink - we're poor students, give us a break and give us water already! - Chicken was superrrr dry!!! Drier than my leather purse, seriously. It didn't have a lot of taste either. - Noodles had better flavor than the chicken, a tad too salty though. - Large portion, but it looked as if I could finish everything and still be fine. Turns out the bottom of my bowl was 1/4-filled with all the oil used in the cooking, so towards the end my noodles were super saturated with oil. I don't like wasting food, so by the time I was done, I couldn't look at my friends' cheesecakes without feeling the need to puke. - We sat outside - there are these heater tower thingies but they don't do much when there's wind. View was nice, but too bad we couldn't sit indoors. Come dressed in layers, because SF weather can get nasty..  - For a place with barely OK food, it was surprisingly quite packed. We tried coming here several days ago but didn't actually eat here till today - they told us the wait time was 3 hours last time we were here. - Friends liked their cheesecakes. I'd say one slice is pretty pricey though - around $6-8 per slice. =// - Only sit outside if you don't mind pigeons. A few of my friends screamed a bit with pigeons flying/walking around our table - there were several instances where I thought my food was going to get soiled with feathers/bird poo. I even watched some pigeons land on other tables to pick at the food left untouched by the customers. If anything, I'd rather not come back here. Location is great so maybe a pre-prom/winterball/other school formal dance dinner with friends might be good, otherwise just go to Westfield/SF Center food courts and get something cheaper&yummier to eat."
Ces T.,"San Francisco, United States",8,35,1,2.0,27/12/2009,"was here last Saturday..waited for 100 minutes to get a table,the Front Desk people we're rude and yes the waiter who was assigned for our table was mean..i've been here a number of times before and it wasn't anything like this. the food as always was great it's just the crappy service that made it a bad dining experience. i'll just go to another Cheesecake Factory location next time."
Jackie T.,"San Francisco, United States",60,67,53,2.0,14/11/2009,"If you're going to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, don't even bother with any of the other locations. This is the only one worth indulging 3000 calories at - for the view ALONE. You can't beat the view of Union Square from 8 stories high on a warm San Francisco day (after the 2 hour wait, that is).  Food is mediocre. Although the complimentary bread is always soft and warm. Cheesecake is divine. (Most contain nuts, but the red velvet does not!) They've suddenly posted the calorie content per cheesecake slice and that makes me feel guilty, depressed, fat, and sad all at the same time :/ Oh well, nothing else to do except drown my sorrows in more cheesecake! My advice: Skip the food. Order a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go. And people watch as you pig out while sitting on the steps of Union Square :)"
Rachel H.,"San Francisco, United States",52,253,12,2.0,19/10/2009,"OMFG Cheesecake. The wait for a table here is insane. Absolutely insane. Also, it is absolutely flooded with fat white tourists. It was like the boat to Alcatraz up in there. If you are at all claustrophobic, then DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT come here for dinner. During dinner time the escalator stairs from the mall are closed and completely inaccessible, so the only way up is a medium sized elevator packed to the brim with fat white people, which you must stand in line to get inside. You will endure a few terrifying moments packed in with 20 people, majority 250-350 pounds each, as the elevator shrieks in indignation (""I'm not paid enough to deal with this shiiiiiiiiit!"" the elevator cries as it takes us up). Also, there seems to be no Emergency Stairs at all. If there was, they were well hidden. Isn't there some kind of law against that? That MUST be against code. In fact, for lack of Emergency Stairs/signs pointing out Emergency Stairs, I am taking 3 stars off because I felt like I was in danger the whole time. If they change this, my rating will go to 5 stars. Anyway, the dinner. We had to leave and come back so I could have some of my anxiety medicine, otherwise I would not have been able to deal with it. Once that kicked in, we got some drinks and mooned over the view from the patio. I had a Lemon Drop (which was refreshing and divine), boyfriend had a Mojito (which was also most excellent). I was very relaxed from fresh air, medicine, and drink by the time we were called to our table. The dinner: The portions here are insanely huge (which explains the overwhelming presence of fatties) so if you're a normal sized person I advise you to skip the appetizers, no matter how hungry you may be from the hour long wait. Or, have a meal made up of JUST appetizers, that works too. We had: Artichoke, spinach dip for appetizers. The artichoke came with two sauces for dipping. One thing that really impressed me about Cheesecake Factory is the sauces. If you have a good sauce, it really pulls the meal together, and the sauces here were pretty amazing. I would love to have taken some of these sauces home with me. They were both pretty delicious. For dinner, I had the Beef Ribs and the boyfriend had some kind of sandwich that he claims was amazing. I didn't try it though, because it looked boring. The Beef Ribs were f-ing delicious. They come large, thick, and pre-separated. Each rib is individually lined with what looked to be two different kinds of BBQ sauce, and the sauces were again delicious. Not too spicy. They are also fork-and-knife tender, so don't be afraid of a mess when you order it. You also get onion rings and french fries with it, though I opted for mashed potatoes instead. I was getting pretty wasted from the Lemon Drops by the time dessert arrived, which was the Red Velvet Cheesecake. OMFG, Cheesecake. OMFG OMFG OMFG. It was sooooo good. Even though we couldn't finish our dinners we managed to kill at least half of the heaping slice of cheesecake. Then, into the to-go box it went. It was pretty reasonably priced. For two appetizers, two entrees, four cocktails and dessert, $118 including tip. And, we took home enough food for 2 more meals each. Pretty good value considering the location. I recommend bringing a nondescript bag to put the leftovers in because the homeless will try to fight you for them on the way home. Serious. All in all, once I got over the claustrophobia, it was a pretty good experience. Our server, a nice lady with short blond wavy hair, was very attentive, especially considering how busy she must have been. If they can fix the crowded elevator situation, and CLEARLY MARK THEIR EMERGENCY STAIRS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, then I feel I can easily bring my rating to five stars. Until then, I think I will only come here for lunch from now on."
