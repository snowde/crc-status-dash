Bruce W.,"San Francisco, United States",56,160,10,2.0,10/9/2009,"So you take the elevator up and u see a mass of people, you spot the counter and they tell you to wait an hour or two, So you look for a place to sit, nope the seats are already taken, mind you its only enough seating for one group. So finally your pager goes off, you go back to the counter and you wait a while longer. Finally in a shining white uniform comes the waiter/waitress. You are taken to your table and given the menu,  You try to read it but it take a while for your eyes to adjust since apparently you are now sitting in a dimly lit cave. So what did I have? well being here once before and being disgusted I decided to make it easy for them. Meatloaf, I have to say it was pretty good, even the waiter was attentive, but the atmosphere? No thanks Id rather go to hmmm Claim Jumpers or Elephant bar. Nice Try though."
Stacy Y.,"San Francisco, United States",25,68,16,2.0,30/8/2009,"It's a chain restaurant that I would put on par with Chili's, TGI Fridays or Outback. The taste of their food is generic and well honed to their target of suburban tourist.  If it weren't for the location of this place it would simply be dull and predictable.  Put it on top of Macy's in the middle of Union Square with outdoor seating many stories up and you have a tourist attraction."
Mace M.,"San Lorenzo, United States",132,370,26,2.0,27/5/2009,"This restaurant is highly over rated. Are all CFs this way? Not in my experience, but this one is absolutely horrid. Yes, the decor is gorgeous, and yes the restaurant and bar have amazing ambiance, but the service is some of the worst I've ever had, and the general operations of this restaurant are so out of tune, I don't see how they stay in business.  This Cheesecake Factory is much like having a 1971 Buick Riviera. A huge bucket, with a massive oil leak, and a shitty water pump, and you're amazed that even though it is a pile of junk, it still somehow manages to operate. My last visit, will remain my last visit, unless I hear they have had some drastic changes. I went in with some friends, three to be exact, and went up the elevator to the top floor and went to put our name in. It was going to be a forty-five minute wait, that is fine, especially for the dining experience which my friends hadn't had yet. The three-quarter-hour wait turned into just over three hours- pay attention, this is why they didn't get one star- which we spent in the bar. The bar, is amazing. Ample seating and standing room, great bar tenders and even better drinks, a bit pricy but it is expected at a place like this. Then, this is where the downward spiral begins. We get seated outside, which is fine because it wasn't cold and they had the patio heaters on low, too, which helped. So, we're starving and we glance at the menu and are immediately ready to order, but it takes about twenty minutes for our waiter to get us waters and take our order. To our amazement, there isn't really anything left to order! We kept ordering things from the menu to find that they were ""out"" of a lot of stuff. In the end, we ended up all ordering the same thing because we were assured they weren't out of that. Our waiter runs off to put our order in, and comes back promptly, now what? It seems that they only have enough to make three orders, needless to say I'm not even hungry anymore, and I opt to share with my friend. I didn't see our waiter for the rest of the meal, as we were served our dinners by some other wait staff, and never got a refill, or anything.  I don't know what kind of restaurant they think they have, but with no reservations, and ALWAYS a long wait, poor service and running out of food- this is just an unacceptable dining experience, and I warn anyone who reads this to avoid this place at all costs."
Jon H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,21,,2.0,15/5/2009,"My friend and I came here last weekend before the dinner rush, so we were seated almost right away. I think that and the bread were the only positive things about my experience. The pork chops I ordered tasted like they were soaked in laundry detergent, the fried macaroni balls were still cold inside, and my friend's Four Cheese Pasta was dry and bland. Not only that, the ground was sticky when we walked on it. I probably won't be coming back."
Montina M.,"Daly City, United States",29,12,,2.0,1/4/2009,The food is so-so but the well mannered dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives is worth the trip downtown from time to time.   The reason for 2 stars... I had dinner at the bar with my bf last Friday.  I am very careful with my belongings and put my purse on the floor near my feet for security.  My wallet was somehow stolen right out of my purse and I got a call from my bank about irregular charges of almost $400 by the time I was leaving the restaurant.   When I went into the bank (across town from the restaurant) on Monday the rep I spoke to told me he had someone with the SAME story last week!!  I wish that the Cheesecake Factory would at least notify their patrons so that we can be extra cautious.  In their defense everyone I delt with was very nice and helpful... I just think they need to do a little more to put a stop to this!
Winnie C.,"San Mateo, United States",21,314,1,2.0,27/3/2009,"I never understood the draw of this place.  Personally, I make it a point to stay away, but some *ahem* friend insisted ... TWICE! First impression - nice decor.  Great location overlooking Union Square.  Opens till late. (all good) Upon arrival, you go to the reception to check in and put your name down.  Then you wait ... and wait some more.  Meanwhile, you have conversations with random strangers in the same boat as you since there's really nothing for either of you to do but to wait ... a LONG time.  You wander around the bar and ""gift"" areas checking out their cheesecakes and getting hungrier by the minute. Finally, you name's called.  With an eagerness you didn't know you had before (you're probably starving by now), you elbow the crowds aside as you get back to the front desk ... you now get a BUZZER! and you get to wander off into the rest of the floors of Macy's while you wait some more.  Not too sure about the range of those buzzer thingys, most people just stay on the top floor of Macy's (linens) looking at endless sheets and towels (woohoo!) During this time, you have no doubt gotten a chance to check out the menu so you know exactly what you want to get as soon as you get seated.  Another half hour or so goes by and your plastic coaster thingy buzzes and flashes.  You trade in your flashing coaster and get put into the ""holding pen"" and wait for somebody to show you to your table. You finally get seated.  At this point, you really don't care where your table is as long as you get your food NOW.  Hopefully before you faint from low blood sugar. The food: there's a wide variety of different kinds of food here.  So you're bound to find something that will catch someone's fancy (on the menu at least), no matter how large your group is.  What we eventually got (food-wise) wasn't necessarily bad ... it's just unremarkable.  Maybe the long wait's their way to nudge people into thinking that the food is better than it is? Prices:  not too bad, but not cheap either.  I could find better places to go in the same price range without the ridiculous wait. Overall:  it's ok.  If your friends insist on coming here.  Go ingest something first.  Preferably a full meal.  Perhaps then, you'll only be hungry when you order instead of starved."
Miranda P.,"Seattle, United States",6,89,5,2.0,26/3/2009,"Before eating at this location I'd always thought of The Cheesecake factory as being an alright chain restaurant. I didn't go out of my way to eat there, but if someone suggested it I didn't complain. Well, that's changed. One good thing was that we didn't have to wait long before we got seated, and though we sat outside on a cool day, the heaters kept us warm. That's the best part of my experience.  What bothered me was that I ordered a steak and asked it to be cooked ""medium"", and received medium-rare. It was cooked medium on the outsides, but once I got to the middle it looked as if it had sat on the grill for one minute before getting brought out. The center was cold and tough, and the steak itself was bland. I wanted to send it back to the kitchen to be cooked some more, but my server was nowhere to be seen. Actually, my server changed three times during the course of my meal, so if they were around I probably didn't realize it. I felt so sickened by the $29 slab of raw meat that I lost my appetite and simply waited for everyone else to get done eating. I didn't see the waiter until the check came. I think it is safe to say that I'll avoid eating at the Cheesecake Factory from now on."
Taylor S.,"San Francisco, United States",118,162,172,2.0,18/3/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory sits above Macy's and overlooks Union Square, but don't let the location sell you. You're going to wind up waiting for quite a while without a reservation, and you're probably going to end up standing in a dozen photos being taken by the tourists around you. The portions are always large (sometimes excessive), but never specifically amazing for the prices you pay. I enjoy the decor and the presentation of staff, but the ambient noise reminds me of a cafeteria.  San Francisco offers a remarkable variety of restaurants, all a small walk or ride away. Be adventurous, poke around at other options before settling with something so mediocre, at best."
Mary F.,"Berkeley, United States",403,186,62,2.0,1/3/2009,"Dang, I've just noticed that I'm a straight up 5 star ho. I give em out like candy on Halloween. Like booty on 'Casual Encounters'. Not this time. Cheesecake Factory, you have personally wronged me. If this was the 18th century, I would have challenged you to a duel. A friend of mine was in town from Canadia and I wanted to take her to some touristy SF stuff. We capped off a day at Fisherman's Warf and Alcatraz with dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. My expectations were mediocre and they still boo-dy-boo-ed all over them. Everything went downhill after the deepfried mac and cheese (don't judge me!).  They sat the most obnoxious table full of guys next to us. One kept straight up starring at me during the entire meal. Fool, this ain't dinner AND a show. When they got drunker, they tried to talk to our table via the WORST intro lines imaginable ""Hey umbrella girl, your umbrella fell off your chair"" ""Wanna eat some of our spinach dip while your friend is in the bathroom?"" Forreally reals?! That's your intro?? No wonder you're sitting at a table full of dudes with no girls.  Anyways, that's not entirely the fault of the Cheesecake Factory but then I got my main course with a cashew in it.... the one thing on this planet I am allergic to. REALLY?!?! I've eaten goat stomach lining cleaned with a hose, monkey brains, even survived a mimosa my other friends had to go to the hospital to get treated for E-COLI for..... and you motherf*ckers test me with a cashew?!? Really, no big deal.  At least I tried to keep it cool. I discretely whispered to the waitress that a cashew landed in my food and I was allergic and her hands flew in the air as she gasped ""OMG (literally 'Oh-Em-Gee', I did not know this restaurant was set in the internet) OMG!! I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION!!!"" For the rest of the night, I could see other patrons stealing glances at me to see if I had gone Eddie Murphy a la The Nutty Professor from a reaction. She called the manager who was far more gracious and he took the dish off our bill.  Then we ordered some cheesecake from their almost embarrassingly long and decadent menu... as if to prove to my visiting guest ""Look, America is fat AND excessive!"". But shit, we could not go to a place and not order something explicitly stated in their name. So we ordered. And waited. And waited... and waited. 15 minutes later, we were told that the printer in the cheesecake kitchen was broken and they had to reorder it for us and she'd be back when it's 'ready'. Really?!?! Reorder it?!?! Girl, you could have just walked back there with a knife and sliced. us. a. piece. of. cheesecake.  Ugh... Cheesecake Factory, I don't think I have anything less to say to you."
Karen C.,"San Francisco, United States",256,163,3,2.0,1/3/2009,"This place is located on the top floor of the Macys builiding downtown. This place is always busy and the wait is always longer than an hour unless you go during abnormal eating times such as 4pm-5pm or 9am. Even then, there's still a wait, just not the hour wait you have at other times.  There's outside and inside seating. The outside seating has heat lamps so you won't get cold, but actualy, it's the top of the building so it gets pretty windy. And there aren't enough heat lamps to get you warm. One time i went and it was so cold and windy, that it just put me in the bad mood and set the rest of my visit up badly. I didn't want to stay there and then they didn't ahve the menu item I wanted. It's great when the weathers nice and sunny but when does that usually happen in San Francisco? The smoothies here are pretty good. They're pretty special and elaborate and i always like ordering them. The customer service is mediocre to bad. They pretty much just take your order and then you never see them again. A different person brings out the food and they hardly ever come back to check to see if you're okay.  I bought two gift cards for my boyfriends parents for christmas for dinner there. And they ended up giving it back to us to eat since they never go there. And when we tried to use them, we found out one of them didn't work. That's what i get for trusting a kitchen employee who doesn't know how to work the cash register to do my giftcards. What a waste of 25 bucks. If you're going to implement a gift card, you should get someone who knows how to do it to do it right, not get someone who loses people's money in the process.  The portions of the food are well worth their money. I usually have trouble finishing my plates and I eat alot. By the time i finish, i never have room for dessert. Boo =[ The food itself is mediocre. First time i ate it I thought it was great, but as i went back. The food wasn't worth the wait. And even without the wait, the food wasn't that great. It was just bleh. I could go somewhere else for cheaper and less trouble and get the same quality of food. They really should change up their menu once in awhile cause they only have a few select things that are actually worthy and then those get tiring quickly. One time i did try the strawberry shortcake and that was damn good. I would definitely order that again. Everything about it was just perfect. The shortcake was awesome, the strawberries were fresh. The whipped cream seemed fresh whipped. And the portions were enormous. I could have eaten this for dinner itself.  All in all, the food portions are worth the price here. The food itself, not so much. Customer Service is bleh. And the wait is jsut wait too long since this is the only cheesecake factory in the area. You have to go an hour away to find another place. So along with all the tourists in the downtown area with the San Franciscans, it's just too many people. Sometimes there isn't even enough room for you to wait.  Oh, no reservations. I'm not sure if reservations would make them better or not. It might slow things down or make things quicker for people who are actually on time. It would be nice if there were reservations though. That way i could actually eat when i'm hungry. 2 stars."
Justine D.,"Newark, United States",493,465,139,2.0,24/2/2009,"I always eat at The Cheesecake Factory when I'm in Honolulu.  It's tradition. As I was wondering around Union Square with my boyfriend we both looked at each other and realized that it had been far too long since either one of us had frequented this chain.  Hunger pains set in and why not? He was on vacation.   I like the view of the Cheesecake Factory over looking Union Square on a nice day.  The heat lamps can only provide so much warmth.  It was raining so as a result we choose to sit inside.  The view would have made the ambiance, much nicer.   The wait was short on Wednesday.  I enjoy my $10 cocktails and glasses of wine, or however much they cost.  In terms of food everyone knows the portions are ridiculous.  I honestly don't really care for anything, but the delicious dark bread and appetizers.  I always get the spicy ahi tempura rolls.  They are insanely good and quite filling.  On this occasion I tried the crusted chicken romano.  Disgusting.  If I had been hungry I definitely lost my appetite.  It was too rich.  It just made me nauseous.  I ended up taking the whole thing home to donate to other hungry mouths.  The boyfriend got the steak Diane cooked medium well.  I don't like my steaks burned personally, but he liked it. And our server was either crazy or krazy.  Drugs make you nuts as evidenced by her.  She was a poster child for what not to do while on the job.   Now I remember why I only eat at the Honolulu location."
Ashley H.,"San Francisco, United States",370,477,11,2.0,22/2/2009,i did not like our server!!!!! when your wit is too slow it comes out as sarcasm!!!!! not funny. what was even worse the whole floor was so damn slippery!!! its like they took grease and rubbed it over every damn inch of that floor!!! and then the table next to us had left and they replaced the table settings but didnt clean up the empty sugar packs on the floor...what a half ass job in keeping ur damn restaurant clean!!! i really had to do a lot to not slip on the floor. boo cheesecake factory for being so damn dirty!!! thats sooo unnecessary
Kelly F.,"Stockton, United States",3,24,2,2.0,6/2/2009,"The service was fine.  Decor, all right.  Food, delicious. The menu is endless. I had the wonton stuffed with buffalo wings as an appetizer, the shrimp bistro and my boyfriend had the hibachi steak. All were scrumptious. But the wait or view is NOT worth it. We waited an hour in the small noisy space by the escalators then waited another 10 minutes after the called out names. Next time if I want some Cheesecake Factory, I'll go to Sac."
S T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,59,,2.0,27/1/2009,the food was just not that good.  i had a dry sandwich with salad that had way too much dressing.  the fries that came with my friends lunch was good but that can't be too hard to make.   surprisingly we were able to get a table quickly on a weekday during lunch hour.  our server was pleasant and the cheesecake we got was pretty good.  2stars because i guess i was just expecting more from the food and was let down considering the price.
Ashley D.,"Santa Monica, United States",108,121,14,2.0,23/1/2009,"Too much hype. The food is good, yes, but the place is ALWAYS packed, and I once waited for 2 hours to get food because it was the birthday girl's selection. I wouldn't have gone otherwise. It's nice to sit outside on a nice day or evening, but that's just about the only good thing, with the exception of huge portions, big enough to take home for lunch the next day! I wouldn't come back by choice. I wouldn't rate the service highly either."
Ken W.,"Richmond, United States",43,136,3,2.0,16/1/2009,"After writing cheesecake on their website, one of their customer service reps called me and asked me about my experience.  Afterwards, he explained that the problem would be addressed and I should expect a little something in the mail as an apology.  I received a $20 gift card from cheesecake.  I'm glad they have such a huge emphasis on trying to better their service."
Lindsay A.,"San Francisco, United States",92,203,7,2.0,13/1/2009,"I'm reluctant to review the Cheesecake Factory but have been pressured into doing so since I went there with some out of town visitors for some cheesecake. I don't actually mind eating at Cheesecake Factory's if I'm in a place that is all chain restaurants but since SF has such good food options it pains me a little to go here. Generally speaking their food is pretty good, but I'll just base this review on my experience for cheesecake yesterday.  Went there with my sis and her boyfriend since they had a hankering for some cheesecake (specifically from CF)... the place was pretty empty being about 4:30 on a Monday night in the middle of January. However, it still took them a while to give us an empty table so we opted to sit at the bar. None of the empty tables were cleaned off and were littered with old plates, food, etc. We sat down anyway hoping someone would come clean off our table. They cleaned off the table next to us first for some people that were about to sit down, ignoring the fact that we were sitting in filth. Finally someone came to clean it and brought us bread but no utensils, napkins or plates. Again, the people that sat down next to us were given propper utensils right away. grr. We were hungry and wanted to eat the bread so we were forced to act cavemanish and open a butter paket and dip the bread in it and eat it in from our hands.  Watresss takes FOREVER, finally brings us our drink order and allows us to order. Cake comes pretty quick, I just had a glass of wine and took a bite of each of their cheesecakes. Everything tasted pretty good. Again it took a while to get the check and a box to bring the remaining cheesecake home. We get the bill and she charged me for a more expensive glass of wine so had to wait while she  corrected it. Ugh.  Like I said, their food is good and reliable when I'm out of town - usually in Texas or somewhere else that only has chain restaurants. But my experience at the SF version really let me down service-wise, especially with the length of time it took to get the table cleaned in a dead restaurant."
Archie G.,"San Jose, United States",1116,1026,42,2.0,9/1/2009,"With this San Francisco location, it is best to come when you are not hungry. The wait is so ridiculously long, you will be hungry by the time they seat you.  While you wait, think about these two questions: 1) Why so many people want to wait 45-minutes to an hour in line to eat mediocre food and bad cheesecake? 2) How can a restaurant with a menu several pages long that has approximately 239 food choices, have so little to offer? The food here is always uninspired. While the food is disappointing, the prices make it even worse. I have friends you who keep dragging me here, so I keep trying different things on the menu. In the end, I feel as if I they are taking stuff out of a freezer, warming it up, and putting it up on my plate. The servers annoy me as well. Every single time I order something, they have to remark how that is a good choice and how delicious that particular entree is. And then it comes out and I am forcing myself to swallow. So yeah, I do not appreciate liars. Nor do I appreciate this restaurant. Or it's crappy cheesecake.  Skip it and find a real restaurant with some sincerity, culture, and most importantly, flavor."
Janice C.,"San Francisco, United States",528,2174,5892,2.0,6/1/2009,"A word to the wise: don't go here if you are past the point of hunger and want to be seated right away. Even at typically dead hours for a restaurant (say, 2 or 3 pm) there is still a wait. Yes, minimum of 30 minutes.  If you happen to be in the area, this is a great place to down a couple of drinks while you rest your tired feet from all day shopping at Union Square. The drinks are pricey, usually in the $10 plus range. I'm not really a cheesecake kinda girl, but the Kahlua cheesecake is totally worth the calories. (or maybe, even the wait)"
