Jo Z.,"San Francisco, United States",18,42,4,2.0,5/1/2009,"OMG! don't bother going to this place it's over rated, its super crowded all the time and the host are rude! food is nothing exceptional i'd rather go to TGIF..i think the only good thing i ever had here was the lunch special which is pizza and salad...and the chocolate mousse cheesecake..thats it!"
Brock H.,"San Francisco, United States",64,52,,2.0,21/12/2008,"Do yourself a huge favor- if you come to San Francisco, eat somewhere you can only dine when you come here! The Cheesecake Factory is the ultimate in cheesy chain restaurants. The menu is way too big, the food is of poor quality (and you can tell it's all mass-produced), and usually it's just full of tired, grumpy tourists. Maybe if you're PMS-ing or just in need of some serious sugar/fat/calories, you can come for a slice of cheesecake. But if you do, you have to get the dulce de leche one. It's actually pretty good. Trust the name of this joint. It's The CHEESECAKE Factory. Please, please don't come here for anything else. Discouraging facts: -There is always a huge wait and the buzzers only work on the eighth floor. Hm, no browsing the furniture department, I guess. -Right around the corner is Crepe o Chocolate. Try having a sandwich there! It's fresh, delicious, and the same price (or cheaper!). -The portions are HUGE. Do you really want to carry left-overs around with you for the rest of the day? (Assuming you're a tourist, here to shop.) Need I say anything more?"
M J.,"Los Angeles, United States",381,224,3,2.0,11/12/2008,"Long wait to be seated, long wait to be served.  Very polite waiters and waitresses. Food- my first experience here was terrible, to be honest. I ordered the garlic noodles.. The garlic flavor was extremely overpowering, as well as the salt and lemon. I barely touched it. My second time here, I had the miso salmon, which I enjoyed very much at Elephant Bar. It was okay.  I think I have yet to find ""the meal"" at Cheesecake.. Oh, and I've never tried their cheesecake! I'd come again just to try that."
Paige C.,"Oakland, United States",53,89,19,2.0,11/12/2008,"The good as everyone mentioned is the location, that really is the only thing this place has going for it.  Even with union square being only five blocks away from the apartment, we still only come here with out of town friends/family that are afraid to try any place they don't recognize the name (ie. only ""chain"" restaurants).  So we usually take them to the factory.  The sight looking over union square especially when an event is happening is quite a view.  If you have a chance, eat outside near the edge looking over the square.   The bad is just about everything else.  Service is completely hit or miss depending on the waiter, food is bland and an over-powering taste comes from the base ingredient in most of their meals.  The place gets really packed on the weekend and waiting for a table becomes quite a mess with the hostess providing very little info or help.  Overall higher quality and better tasting food can be found within walking distance for less trouble and a cheaper bill."
Vee V.,"San Francisco, United States",2,20,6,2.0,12/11/2008,"Went here twice and still can't figure out why it is so popular.  The most recent time we went was a Monday night and we were told that they were out of bread yet other table waiters were serving bread. Confused, we asked another waiter, and he was able to find us a fresh batch of bread.  As our food was served (at different times) we could hear our waiter continue to tell other tables that there were no bread.  The food is average. The service needs alot more work. I just dont think the food or service is worth the usual 30 minutes wait..."
maria a.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,2.0,5/11/2008,if you like waiting an hour and half  to eat what tastes like frozen food and pay an overpriced dinner tab this is the place. there entrees aren't that good. a good place to have appetizers though. there drinks are good too. Oh! and yes there wide array of cheesecakes is great!!! there yummy! but the rest of the food here kinda sucks
Sarah S.,"Sacramento, United States",100,181,40,2.0,4/11/2008,HMMMM *OVERPRICED *OVERRATED *OVERPACKED (not a word I KNOW...) This place is filled to the brim with tourists. The only good thing is that the portions are huge and that there buffalo salad is ORGASMIC... besides that I've made better cheese myself.  IN REVIEW..... get the buffalo salad to go and have an orgasm in the comforts of your own home. (2 stars for the fact that they make one of my favourite salads and the ahi on the appetizer menu is pretty dank too)
Bee D.,"Vallejo, United States",386,541,1513,2.0,26/10/2008,"Ms T and I were high as a kite after seeing Hill Harper at Macy's (on the first floor). $130 later I was sporting his new watch, an autograph for my son and a smile which is still on my lips, we decided to go upstairs for some late lunch. Seems like a bunch of our other Harper fans decided to do the same. We waited 45 minutes, me on the outside deck and Ms T resting her trotters inside. We were seated on the terrace and waited a few for the waiter. Since we had waited so long, we knew what we wanted and placed our order right away. Ok, I'm just gonna cut to the chase: 1/ We didn't' get our bread and water until we got our drinks. Suggestion - When you have people waiting 45 minutes for a table, bring water and bread to the table right away, it would be appreciated! 2/ Keep track of when tables are seated, it is disconcerting to be seated before another table, yet have your waiter leave your table, hit theirs and then place the order.... remember, we were starving during that 45 minute wait. 3/ Our waiter wasn't as attentive as he could have been. He remained at the waiters station, coming and making rounds occasionally. We had to put our empty glasses at the edge of the table so that someone would notice that we needed refills - unacceptable. Most likely, nothing will change. Due to the location, the tourists and the ""name,"" people will keep coming..... most likely, not me.! My food was meh - Ms T enjoyed the worlds biggest burger, she had to cut it up to fit it in her mouth! (ha, ha)."
Spanky M.,"San Francisco, United States",1,389,10,2.0,24/10/2008,"Ask yourself.. Is Elephant Bar the best place ever? Is PF Changs the best chinese food you have ever eaten? Does the thought of a Starbucks double latte, half calf, iced mocha frappacino get you wet? If you answered yes to any of these then you will LOVE Cheese Cake factory.  Another designed for suburbia, put in the city for suburbanites travesty of taste.   Was the meal worth its wait in pennies?  Bluntly, Yes.  Large portions that probably get better the next day.  Thus while the initial presentation may be crap, it may make up for it the next day.   Taste?  Well I had the Ahi tuna and it was good, very good but that was in Portland.  I had the Albacore here and while the albacore was above Can grade the white rice and asianesque bed of vegetables was well lacking in style and creativity.  Which brings me to why thisplace only gets 2 stars. Having a target group of 20-50 suburbanite  somethings with little taste beyond Applebee's it can not get any crazier than adjectives in the english language will allow it to be.  It must appease palates that prefer Outback steaks and Chili's as Week night out meals and Cheesecake factory as the special occasion meal.  That being said it is not for the indiscriminate palate that requires more imagination and pizzaz in its dishes.  Service...Slow... this is why the wait is 1hr.  Because while i tried to push the server along so he could turn his table and get another seating and more tips, he decided to dilly dally and take forever to do anything.  And because the service is slow people figure they can camp out for an extra half hour after they eat holding up the line of people anxsiously awaiting to put their cankles to rest .  If the service is quick generally you will have less camper sbecause the tone has been set and your table turn overs will be faster.   Decoration...See questions above.  Cheesy!"
Nicole M.,"Lanham, United States",56,39,1,2.0,5/9/2008,"Well, I've always heard people raving about how I should go to the Cheesecake Factory and a friend of mine offered to pay for lunch today so I thought why not?  The wait wasn't nearly as long as I thought it'd be but we were also only two people and not picky about location. Took around 15 - 20 minutes for them to get us a place to sit inside, despite a moderately sized lunch crowd.  No air-conditioning. As hot as it was today. They said the AC had broken the night before and they had very little ventilation going which meant we were sweating bullets. Our server brought out some water and breezed away, not to be seen again for another 20 minutes. Boo.  He finally shows up, I order the Kobe Burger. GREASY. I mean don't get me wrong, I like greasy but it seemed a little out of place at a supposedly mid-level restaurant. The beef itself was just a little bland, like a burger I probably could've ordered at some offbrand place on Market Street. To their benefit though, the portions were HUGE...but in this instance, it was a case of quantity over quality.  My biggest gripe? When my friend put her money in for the check, our waiter asked if she wanted change. Sorry, but one of the biggest things I'd always been taught as a waitress was to NEVER ask that question. Just bring your customer their change back and if they want to leave a tip, they will. Asking if the customer wants change is a little like begging and in a high-traffic place like Cheesecake Factory it shouldn't even cross your mind to ask. Aside from all that, it was okay I guess. I wouldn't go again unless I had a specific reason for doing so (birthday, etc)."
Cat of a Donut J.,"San Francisco, United States",60,147,,2.0,4/9/2008,"OH no, pass on that. General 3 stars rating does is a perfect reflection I think. OK, threw up after ""medium well"" burger, that were rather ""medium-rare""...Greazy, doing a no-good meal  1 star for the waitress - she was superfriendly 1 star for the chocolate cheezecake - yummy f**ker! ;)"
LiZANN S.,"San Francisco, United States",13,53,1,2.0,30/8/2008,"Cajun Jambalaya Pasta being the most ""popular dish""? shut that shit up. there was no jambalaya representation whatsoever. not even spicy. at least the linguine was fresh."
B B.,"Seattle, United States",6,118,12,2.0,13/8/2008,"What the crap is so special about this Cheesecake Factory? We got there at 5pm on a Thursday, and it was a 45 minute wait. When we left at 9pm, out of curiosity I checked, and it was a 90 minute wait. What?! And we had to mosh our way out of there. The only thing good about this location are the comfy (and expensive) couches on the floor below which I napped on before we were buzzed. Note: Don't lay on the beds, otherwise you get sternly scolded by sales staff. Apparently, they don't care about you napping on the couches."
Eric Y.,"Millbrae, United States",327,695,1295,2.0,3/8/2008,terrible service the last time i went. the waitor looked like she was dead or drunk the previous night.  she didn't understand a single word we said. we asked for ice water and it didn't come after she said okay. we asked for napkin and she never brought it over. we complained abuot our food being slow and finally the manager came over to say sorry. nothing else happened
Miss D.,"San Francisco, United States",3,70,,2.0,2/8/2008,"to be honest..the only reason this place got two stars is because of their cheesecake. It's the bomb....but other then that...this place deserves less then a star. The wait..is FUCKING LONG...to other people who complain about an hour wait. psh...you won't believe mine. My birthday's in December a few days before Christmas. And of course I had my birthday dinner held here and since you can't reserve, I came FUCKING EARLY to get 25 seats. I told everyone dinner starts at 7pm, guess what time I was here by. FUCKING 1PM JUST TO GUARANTEE MY SEATS BY 7PM. Yes I know I'm crazy but I wanted to get my seats ON TIME. RIDICULOUSLY...AS EARLY AS I WAS..I FUCKING DIDN'T GET MY SEATS TILL FUCKING 8:30PM. They told me I had to have more then half my party here BY 7 and we didn't even come close to getting seated until 8:30pm. Although my birthday wasn't a total wreck, still...the wait here is not worth it at all. Besides..even though I was there at 1pm, of course, I'm downtown..I went shopping all day till 6:30pm and came back hoping to get seated soon. This place is never worth the wait, my advice, just get cheesecake to go, otherwise don't eat here....the food is alright..not anything different or all that great. It's just like another American restaurant."
The Black Cat C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,171,145,2.0,1/8/2008,"What is so good about this place? Just because its fancy? street view? I only been once, in 2001. My 2 kids go there once in a while with my x. Both of them said there's nothing to eat, at least, nothing they like. The waiting is so ridiculous. I have friends who were from France, and they wanted to try and waited for over TWO hours!"
Scott G.,"Brooklyn, United States",30,424,9,2.0,31/7/2008,My most recent experience here sucked.  Our server never brought us a glass of water we asked for and then managed to fuck up our bill my doubling everything we ordered.  This place gets WAY to hectic and crowded with tourists and others I don't wish to be with.  Not worth the 50 minute wait.
I M.,"Oakland, United States",12,108,85,2.0,27/7/2008,"I have eaten here before.. probably twice. but it was a looooooong time ago.  A few months back, I was starving and really needed to eat something. and i was already in Macys, so I figured what the fuck? 45 minutes - 1 hour for a table? There? Christ. If I'm going to wait that long for food, it better be the BEST FOOD EVER (and someone else had better be paying for it). Walked out. Forgot where I ate instead. Not like it really matters."
Bebe E.,"San Francisco, United States",239,107,7,2.0,19/7/2008,"What's with all the non-sanfranciscans wanting to eat the the Cheesecake Factory?  Sure, it's a nice, fancy-looking restaurant.  But it's always crowded! The wait the last time I went was about an hour and a half.  Good thing my date was very charming company or else I would have said ""F*** that"".  So we got our buzzer thingie, and made our way down to the Starbucks on Powell St.  Then took a romantic *sigh* walk around Union Square... then I spilled coffee on my new white top. Klutz.  ARGH! We both laughed it off, and headed back to the restaurant.   We got our pager at 7 pm.  We were not seated until 9.  Actually about 9:10 to be exact.   The food is meh.  Nothing you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else in the city. I'm not a dessert person, so I really cannot tell you about the Cheesecake.  But I'm sure you can't go too wrong with the stuff."
Ryan C.,"Oakland, United States",25,156,,2.0,11/7/2008,Ridiculously long wait for sub-standard food.
