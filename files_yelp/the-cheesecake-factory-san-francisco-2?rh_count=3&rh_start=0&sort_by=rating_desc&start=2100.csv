Luis T.,"San Francisco, United States",6,23,,2.0,23/6/2008,"When  we arrived there I knew there would be a wait, but I had never heard of a bar area not letting you sit at there tables while you wait to be seated. Me and a couple of my friends we're basically told, these tables are for paying customers only. I was shocked that they even told that to us, good thing right after that we got seated. Once we were seated and placed our drink orders it only took about 20 minutes to get the drinks, and then they even forgot one of the drinks which we had to wait another 10 minutes to get.  We placed our food order and that was done in somewhat of a timely manner. But once we did get our food we just had to sit there because the staff forgot to set the table up correctly. One of the orders wasn't  done correctly and then they even had to say we're going to have to charge extra since it is a side order that you want, even though it would have came with the meal, just on the side. The food was good and that is the only reason overall the restaurant was able to attain the review that I gave it. The tuxedo chocolate cheesecake was great for dessert and I definitely recommend that to anyone that still has room for food after the generous portions of food they give you.  So overall I must say to be clear on what you order and don't wait for the waiter to check up on you, you check up on them to make sure everything goes smoothly."
Tony L.,"San Jose, United States",605,239,,2.0,22/6/2008,"Wait two hours to eat overpriced mediocre food? No thanks. Yes, the view is great from the balcony. Yes, the desserts are fabulous. But as far as coming here for dinner - no freakin way."
Hellyn M.,"San Francisco, United States",77,20,,2.0,19/6/2008,"I left this place full and confused, a feeling that most chain restaurants seem to inspire.   The avocado egg roll appetizer was a fun combination, crispy, soft and very tasty.  It's worth trying once.  The fried macaroni balls were bland and a gooey mess.  I had ordered the seared tuna tataki salad which was decent.  The rest of our meals were okay, fun and appetizing but nothing grand nor complex.  Definitely expect a long wait time if you arrive in the evening without reservations.  But once seated, the service is pleasant and attentive.  However, I got the impression the wait staff was hurried since it was very busy and they mixed-up some of our orders, then overcharged our bill with items we never had.  This lead to a very confusing experience.   This is my first and only experience with the Cheesecake Factory, and soon to be a forgettable one."
Csndra L.,"Anaheim, United States",5,93,2,2.0,15/6/2008,"I am writing this review as I am sitting at this restaurant right now. Pleasant brunch up until dessert time...but.. 1) Waitress forgot about our cheesecake order after she came by twice within the 10 minute gap so we decide not to get it anymore. Didn't come back til 15 min later. .......She just came by right now, omgwtfbbqholyshit. 2) Walked by us multiple times and did not say ""what would you like?"" 3) Kinda hated the fact that they kept switching waitresses on us. o,O.. 4) Sat us at a unwanted spot outside until we had to request if we can move. Kept on telling us to hold on, whats the big deal? Its just a seat. Aye all this over brunch.....drama.. Oh and there's some little kid behind me right now and her dad talking loud, give us some fucking space would ya... OH! It's not even that busy right now, so slow service don't you think? -,-.... It is 3:22pm right now and we still haven't gotten our check back."

Becka T.,"Bay Area, United States",70,72,12,2.0,28/5/2008,"I like the idea of the outdoor rooftop seating, overlooking union square... but the family of pigeons that dined with us KILLED the concept.  My burger was pretty good...medium rare just the way I like it. The seared ahi tuna appetizer roll was pretty good too.   The major downfall were the crowds of people waiting for seating, which made the environment chaotic and unorganized. The set up of the restaurant is cramped and complicated. Someone had to ask us if they could borrow a vacant chair from our table so their elderly grandmother didn't have to stand while waiting for their table.  Not accommodating at all! This place is just like a pricier version of elephant bar, macaroni grill, or applebee's. Overall, kinda ghettttoooo... and not too exciting... Cheesecake Factory ..ain't all that"
Manton R.,"Santa Clara, United States",453,237,10,2.0,3/5/2008,"If you're reading me, you're probably considering going to the Cheesecake Factory.  Well, here's my two cents.  If you want to wait about 1.5 hours to get seated, go for it.  The food is good but not spectacular.  My only gripe with Cheesecake Factory is the long wait.  Oh, even if you go on a Tuesday night, you'll be waiting a good hour.  Their desserts are delicious and they shadow their entrees.  The Cheesecake Factory is just a standard American style restaurant that's dim inside and requires a good wait time in order to get seated."
L C.,"San Francisco, United States",2,208,,2.0,18/4/2008,The wait time is alway too long.  The service and the food is hit or miss.   I never sit outside because of all the pigeons (rats with wings)
Chaser D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,2.0,6/4/2008,I went there 3times and ate only once and nooone can take me there again. the best thing about this place is the location. top of macys... you watch union square... its good. the wait is a killer. why should I wait 90mins for a 30mins meal ??? and its pricy too. drinks = weak or the weakest. you need to have 3-4 but thn ended up going to restroom. Cheesecake= overpriced garbage. They don't even make the cheesecake in the restaurant. Totally worthless. service = you need to get a service to rate the service.  first u need to wait to be seated.  second you need to wait for a waiter to come and get your order.  third if he/she gets your order good luck if you can see him agaiin in the next 30mins. ohhh if he forgot something or you need anything... hmm dont worry he ll bring it with the check. they might even wrap it and make it to go if you still cant get it although you pid for it. dont complain just take it home. or eat outside while walking down on powell st.
Tony L.,"San Francisco, United States",58,86,7,2.0,26/3/2008,"I am a local and don't have a decent dessert and coffee place in my neighborhood here in Visitacion Valley.  So I stayed around my workplace and trudged down to Macy's on Union Square.  If you crave cheesecake, be patient as there is a monumental wait.  I had Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake and it was delicious.  I read the reviews regarding the overpriced drinks and kept with the tap water.  Service was surprisingly fast and efficient.  They even checked with my table quite often to refill the iced teas."
Kathleen B.,"Long Island, United States",135,451,17,2.0,22/3/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory has a weird garbagey smell to it, and it's always SO crowded every night of the week as it's: 1.  On top of Macy's in Union Square. 2.  The only Cheesecake Factory in the city. 3.  Small in reference to other Cheesecake Factories Regardless, I'd still come here after work for some STRONG drinks and appetizers with my coworkers.  So it was either Coconut Mojitos, Tropical Martinis, Strawberry Martinis or Dirty Martinis (depending on our moods).  The apps we would all get would be the Roasted Artichokes and Mac and Cheese balls. Aside from that, you'd find the ladies of Macy's Estee Lauder here most every weekend night.  :)"
Cellina B.,"San Francisco, United States",171,78,6,2.0,14/3/2008,"I've been here on numerous occassions and let me just say last night was probably the last time I go here for awhile. The wait takes forever!!! I've been here with a friend on a weeknight and it always takes a half hour to an hour just to be seated. Next thing you know you are seated, and next thing you know you are waiting for your drink, which takes forever. Don't expect your food for another half an hour.  If you do plan on venturing into this overrated animal/tourist carnivale then I would highly recommend that you opt for a table on the patio.  Why you ask? Well for one thing you get an amazing view of Union Square, and two it is much quieter than inside. There are heat lamps too. You can actually have a conversation rather than shout.  Also, if you decide to eat here then make sure you've had some drinks prior to arriving because the drinks are not that strong, plus you don't want to be around those god awful tourists in a sober state of mind.  Overpriced chain restaurant that attracts your idiotic Tourist.  Housewine costs $7.50 a glass and they barely even fill it. It's like hello I'm not wine tasting so fill er up. The portions are too big so I opted for an overpriced tomato and mozzarella salad. By the time the food came, I was barely even hungry and by then you don't even want to try the cheesecake.  The menu reads like a poorly written novel, not only that, but it is loaded with a bunch of crap, yes the food, and advertisements for Macy's. Terrible!  Cheesecake= overpriced garbage. They don't even make the cheesecake in the restaurant. Totally worthless.   The other thing that really chaps my hide is that the servers always remind me of a deer caught in the headlights. They just don't get it or they need some self-esteem classes because they are insecure and they just don't get it. You ask them a question and they kind of sit there with this dumb look on their face. So yeah, this is a good place to go when you have no clue about what is good in San Francisco. People who have no clue= TOURIST.  Why did I end up here that night? My girlfriends and I were having our weekly Spinster night. Being overly obnoxious, what better place for us to go than the Cheesecake Factory!"
Tiffany R.,"Livermore, United States",4,1,18,2.0,9/3/2008,my friends and i had resveravtion for 10 people at 12:00. we did not get the table until 1:00. the forks had food on the that was so disgusting. i ordered  thai chicken pasta. the chicken was dried. the food was ok.
Carl Z.,"San Francisco, United States",5,264,16,2.0,6/3/2008,"Unbelieveable how you can go to heaven and get high without the use of drugs or monosodium glutamate. *3-26-08: HOWEVER... as much as I adore that special ingredient, cream cheese (the sole joy catcher for cheesecake), my extraverted side just cannot tolerate such crowds and costs that float far above this ""factory"" located on the 8th floor of an already overpriced apparel outlet (Macy's). Do to these coupled factors, I've plucked away 3 stars, so 2 stars to them."
GEL R.,"Daly City, United States",33,11,3,2.0,17/2/2008,"So on Valentines Day  my boyfriend and I took my little sister here and her boyfriend on a double date, since they've never ate here before......... The place was PAAACKKEDD, and on top of that our server messed up on my order 3 fucking times. So while everyone else got their food, I'm sitting waiting for mines since they came out with the wrong order, not just once, but TWICE.... Dont' get me wrong the Herb Crusted Salmon was preeetty darn good, but the Steak diane was gross.. The cheesecake were alright.  I felt bad for the server since he's probably running around serving other people, so when we left I left him a generous tip. Despite the fact that I wasn't well satisfied......... Ok so the next day I check my bank statement, and guess the fuck what.. THEY CHARGED ME TWICE! UGH  How disturbing is that?? Anyways next time I'm making sure I get my moneys worth when I eat there again, and I'll probably be alot more demanding. =]"
angie c.,"Berkeley, United States",0,46,,2.0,12/2/2008,"I've been here several times. I don't really mind the long wait to be seated. It's expected at any restaurant in a busy, tourist-loving city during a rush. Having said that, I think service should be at least halfway decent especially when dishes are like $20 each and a slice of cheesecake is nearly $10. It generally is. Sadly, service here is not always consistent! I usually get decent waiters. Not awesome, but decent. They're nice, get the job done, some small talk, etc and I usually tip them 20% or more. But this one time I went, we left something like $.83. It actually wasn't my idea. My bf insisted we leave nothing, then decided it'd look more humiliating if we left some coins instead of nothing. He used to be a waiter at Pf changs (and was really good at what he did) and the lack of service REALLY pissed him off. So here's the summary of our lunch: First of all, we're just given sourdough bread. We ask for the wheat too. The waiter told us they were out. I see other tables with wheat bread in their baskets. Okay..so maybe they ran out before we got seated so I'm just indifferent to the whole situation. But then later we see other waiters with their bread baskets that included wheat bread. We request wheat bread again from our waiter (we had to hunt him down), he says their still out (didn't even go check). This guy flat out LIED to us. I mean...if you're going to lie, then at least be smart about it, asshole. So here I am already annoyed before I even decide what I want to order. Waiter comes back to take our order and leaves. We sip on our drinks while we wait. Then we sip and wait some more.  Appetizer finally comes. We eat and wait some more. Sip and wait. And during all that waiting, he didn't stop once by our table to check up on us. Food finally comes and not as hot as it should be, obviously sitting in the window for a good few minutes before it was served. Our drinks only have ice in them by this time. He literally dropped off our food and left, not taking notice of our now empty drinks. We ended up asking a busboy to refill our drinks 'cause our guy was too ""busy"", and by ""busy"" i mean laughing with his other waiter buddies. The same busboy got me a new fork later on 'cause I had dropped mine. Something's wrong when the busboy is doing your waiter's job too. And it's pretty f'ed up."
Domini A.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, United States",519,89,14,2.0,2/2/2008,"I went to cheesecake factory for a drink and a little snack TWICE with the same ex. Great view terrible service.  No good snacks, really, in any decent time FILLED with people who i, in my elitist cloud of disdain for all bad footwear, really DIDN""T like and the bartender couldn't mix drinks for SHITE. Terrible service ? took forever, both at the table and at the bar. But the view is nice.  If you don't want to break in to a building and hack in to the roof ( like, if your parents are visiting or something) then maybe it's useful to drop a 20 or two, have a glass, a straw, and something unpalatable inside of it, and appreciate union sq. and it's entourage. Otherwise, please don't bother. THe dome at the westfield is free and you could technically pack your own almost anything in the correct receptacle."
Kelsey E.,"San Francisco, United States",693,221,27,2.0,1/2/2008,"When my friends say they are going to Union Square and will find a place to eat dinner, I usually beg them to not go to the Cheesecake Factory. Yet for some reason they never take my advice and end up having the same meal and experience they had before every high school dance. You know the kind: easy for big groups, loud, standard party food, a menu 562 pages long to appeal to what everyone likes. I feel like I should be in a prom dress every time I go there. The first, most obvious downside is the wait. By the time you get seated, Jesus might actually be making the 2nd coming rounds. Don't think you can get around the wait, it is crowded at all times. The food is not worth the time it takes to get it, it's anything you can get at a TGIFridays, except it's served in a classier setting. I mean, it's not like I don't enjoy the appetizers (who doesn't like popcorn shrimp!), it's just that it's nothing special and there are so many more things around Union Square that are magically delicious.  The only reason I'd swing by this place is to get in line for a slice of cheesecake, which is dense, really sweet, and suuuuper rich, so if that's what you're looking for it will hit the spot. However, again the line for this is usually unbearable.  If you're in the Union Square area, try Scala's Bistro, Anjou, or Cafe Claude (which is just as inexpensive for most items as the Factory). Unless, that is, you're on your way to the prom, in which case the Cheesecake Factory would get my vote."
Tommy P.,"San Francisco, United States",203,346,7,2.0,31/1/2008,"While the location is nice Cheescake Factory has always failed to impress me and this one is no exception. Just seems like they try to cover to many types of food and in the process don't excel at any (except cheesecake). Also the prices here are way to high. Just seems like for the price you pay for food, drink and desert here you could do a lot better, especially in a town like SF with so many fine dining options."
Rene M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,35,,2.0,22/1/2008,So I still don't understand why people wait for over an hour just to eat at this restaurant.  The food is not that good; they just serve you mass quantities of it.  I guess people just like the location of the restaurant and the convenience of strolling through Macy's while they wait for their table.
