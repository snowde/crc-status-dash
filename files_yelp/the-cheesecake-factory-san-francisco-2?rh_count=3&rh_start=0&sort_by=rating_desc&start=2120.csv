Tyler D.,"San Francisco, United States",19,96,2,2.0,31/12/2007,"This place is pretty and such, but I seriously was not impressed with the service or the food. I mean the wait is anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours for what? The food is not that great and I do not like cheesecake that much. I don't understand the hype about this place. The way people flock here you would think that it's the next great thing, but it just comes off as the same old tired restaurant that has more stock in its name than the food they serve."
Angie Y.,"San Francisco, United States",3,159,,2.0,30/12/2007,"The food and cheesecakes probably deserve 3 stars, but the wait! Reservation obviously doesn't mean anything to this place, so don't bother, and be ready to show some aggressive side of you to get a table even after you got the beeper rings. Just went back after 6 years of hiatus.  Just can't understand why I still remebered the name 'Cheesecake Factory'. (Erase it.. earse it from memory..) Yes.. it's all my fault.."
Bevy M.,"Castro Valley, United States",172,440,83,2.0,26/12/2007,"Although I've had good experiences at other branches (mainly in SoCal -- Newport Beach and Beverly Hills), I feel compelled to bitch them out about the disrespectful way they treat customers with regards to wait times.   Why not take reservations like most normal restaurants?   To tell customers that it's a 45 minute wait, then keep us waiting for double that amount of time?  I would like to send them a bill for all the time TOTALLY WASTED because they were either: 1) lying bastards 2) incompetent with table management and time estimates 3) complete idiots 4) insensitive slobs 5) apathetic because they have so much business they don't need their customers I think that if enough customers said ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore,"" and then voted with their feet, Cheesecake Factory might get the message and change their inhumane practices.   In the meantime I will choose from the many other wonderful alternatives in the area, with whom I can easily book a reservation via Open Table!"
Edgar G.,"San Francisco, United States",220,404,9,2.0,21/11/2007,"The food is mediocre, the service is OK, overall it isn't a place I would go on a regular basis. I don't get why people still come here when the food isn't even all that great. I'm assuming the cheesecake is better."
Rebecca H.,"San Francisco, United States",222,482,,2.0,18/10/2007,"WHY DO ALL MY OUT OF TOWN RELATIVES WANT TO COME HERE?!? San Francisco is a town with a lot of great restaurants, and yet when my relatives visit, this is the first place they want to dine. It fills me with endless frustration. Sure there is a nice view and the portions are huge, but c'mon... there are a lot better places to eat.  Trying to be objective, this place has the standard Cheese Factory fare, with the overly large menu filled with ads. So three stars for that. I have to knock off a star, however, because of the long long long wait (sometimes it's more than 2 hours), no room at the bar when you are forced to wait, servers to frequently forget to place orders (I get that they have too many tables, but it sucks that it always happens to be my order that gets forgotten), and pushy rude customers. If you really must get your cheesecake fix from here, I suggest you grab a slice and go."
Michael R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,2.0,15/10/2007,"The wait here is crazy on a weekend.  Good food is a hit or miss here.  They have HUGE servings of food.  So take your pick of either ""quanity"" or ""quality"".   The thing that rawks my socks off is the ""Thai Chicekn Salad Wrap"" with the yummy sauces.  I do advise you guys to steer clear of the green one.  It tastes as green as it looks.   The cheesecake is worth coming for.  The selections are just too much.  That's why you should bring your girlfriend/wife etc...and order a bunch and just pig out."
Hannah Lee H.,"San Francisco, United States",16,25,,2.0,8/10/2007,"The wait is evil.  (Buzzers don't even work in most of Macy's).  The tables are too close together.  The patio is blasted by 75 MPH winds.   The servers are daft.  The menu has 8,000 ways for food to be fried and dipped in ranch sauce.   2 stars for okay cheesecake and strawberry shortcake.  Zanze's makes better cheesecake.  Hell, even I can make better cheesecake, not that I actually ever do make it.  But I can dream!   I go here only because it is my BFF's favorite.  I keep trying to convince her to go to Grand Cafe instead.  But she is hooked.  (I'd spell that ""hoodwinked""). If you do find yourself here, and they offer you the deck, scream ""Hell No, We Won't Go!""  It is so windy and cold out there.  Eat there only at risk of getting deep inner chill."
J Q.,"San Francisco, United States",19,113,12,2.0,6/9/2007,"Cheesecake factory.. ugh What should you get this time? That roasted chicken rosemary dish, the wannabe kobe beef dish with the wasabe/mashed potatoes, the ridiculous factory burger, the over-the-top drink selection. When you look at someone's menu, and you see ads on ever other page it should tell you something is up.. As far as location goes; yes, it's nice to sit atop Union Square and watch the city before you head back down to the masses, but the restaurant isn't worth the price. Location: 5 stars Atmosphere: 3 stars Service: 3 stars Menu selection: 2.5 stars Return-factor: 3 stars Last impression: 2.5 stars"
Rene D.,"New Orleans, United States",392,810,130,2.0,24/8/2007,"I'm not a fan of chain food. We live in an area that is written about  and praised around the world for our quest for sustainable, organic, artisanal, delicious, local food. Chain food does not fall under any of these categories.  So, this place makes a decent drink, and I was shocked that you could see and taste crab in the crab won tons. And, not crab spelled with a K. I had the Tuna Tataki Salad, which was not a ginormous pile of lettuce with three strips of tuna, but a decent amount of very tender slightly seared tuna with nicely dressed mesclun. The sliced tomatoes on the side however were far from ripe, and I was happy they were easy to ignore.  My friend had the Santa Fe Salad - an urn of salad with things non-salad eaters like:corn, black beans, chicken, avocado, sort sort of cheese, and a pile of thinly sliced onion rings. Who decided fried onions belonged on a salad? Oh, yeah - 'Weight Management Salads'? puh-leeze. The cheesecake is tres Gentile. Too,too fluffy, and why the whipped cream? Isn't there enough dairy fat on the plate as is? It's conceived by the same group that believes pudding belongs on a salad bar. Our server was nice, and followed her corporate script to the letter without seeming mechanical. I'm still baffled why people line up to eat here, but if you're with out-of-towners who are terrified of change, this is a safe bet."
Amy O.,"San Francisco, United States",51,79,,2.0,5/8/2007,"Cheesecake Factory has the longest f'ing wait times during the dinner and weekend rushes. The food is pretty good, the portions are double the normal, and the price matches. My biggest complaint is the bakery. I've gone twice to get a cheesecake to go, a whole six-incher. You'd think I would be out of the restaurant with my cake in ten, fifteen minutes. Oh no. No, no, no. Due to the guy behind the counter (Luis), his minimal grasp of English, and the cheesecake-packing ladies behind him, I've waited thirty to forty minutes for a cake requiring only packing and bagging.  Every time, it's like they forgot about my f'ing order. When I go up to Luis again with my receipt after fifteen minutes and politely inquire how much longer it will be, he takes the receipt and looks at it in surprise, goes to one of the other ladies who looks at it like she's never seen the order, and disappears off to who knows where. He will then come back and hand me my receipt and tell me it's coming. I usually wait another ten minutes before watching him drop the boxed cake in a bag and shake the box in the bag to get it balanced. IT'S A F'ING CHEESECAKE, DON'T SHAKE IT AROUND. I'm beginning to think as good as the cheesecakes are, it's not worth the shit I have to go through with Luis and co. I haaaate the bakery staff. They make me so angry, I curse whenever I speak of them. Getting me my cake should only take five minutes! Time management, people, TIME MANAGEMENT."
Renae H.,"San Mateo, United States",233,336,1,2.0,30/7/2007,"Cheesecake Factory I'm just not patient enough to deal with you.   Once every year or two someone in my family says ""Ooooh, let's go to the Cheesecake Factory"" and I can't talk them out of it, so off we go.   The food is ok, some of the dishes are actually pretty good, but you can't make reservations so you wait, and wait, and wait and after that you wait some more.  When you finally get seated you repeat the process again with the waitstaff and to me an inattentive waitstaff is the kiss of death. I'm sure I'll end up here again, but it won't ever be my idea."
Bernard M.,"Palo Alto, United States",232,124,1,2.0,27/7/2007,"Don't know why everyone in SF is writing about ""big portions"" since they seem normal to me. Of course I'm from the land of whole milk and flowing cholesterol, Chicago, so their portions are just right.   Anyway, Cheesecake Factory is standard fare. Some good dishes, some bad. Some great cheesecake and some so-so cheesecake. One thing that seems weird to observe is that this Cheesecake is very busy. Often a long wait.  This is a sign of a bad restaurant culture when one of the hottest restaurants in the heart of your downtown is Cheesecake Factory."
Selino V.,"San Francisco, United States",57,100,2,2.0,18/7/2007,"This place is a bung hole. How often do you get a combo of bad food, high prices, horrible angry staff, and obese Americans? Every day at Cheesecake Factory. Gavin needs to walk into that place and declare it a public hazard. I'd rather see a nail place there or a check cashing joint."
Cynthia B.,"Hercules, United States",912,1062,87,2.0,14/7/2007,"I have never been to this location but two times one of the employees brought me cheesecake from there.  I love cheesecake.  The first time the cheesecake was HEAVY, not rich enough, too sweet and like something you might get in the frozen section at any supermarket.  Probably because that's not too far from the truth.   The second time I was brought a slice I accepted it because I was hungry and broke.  It wasn't even fun to eat, more of a chore.  It definitely wasn't worth the calories. It's not horrible cheesecake, but after eating other cheesecakes in Berkeley in past years and of course at Zanze's it made the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake look pretty bad.  What a let-down.  Now I don't have a good impression of the Cheesecake Factory, my guess is they are more interested in giving you calories than you giving you great taste and quality."
Nikki c.,"Oakland, United States",338,1040,,2.0,6/7/2007,"The wait just is NOT worth in, especially in a city where there are so many other dining options.  I don't think I've been back here since I turned 21.  The best thing I can say about them is they are fairly accommodating of big parties.  The little buzzer thingys are handy.  One day I ended up shopping with a friend for about 45 mins while she was waiting for a table.  Ummmm, you could be halfway through your meal at a GOOD place by then."
Oribel ..,"Daly City, United States",2,97,,2.0,20/6/2007,"2 stars just for the view off the deck (outside dining area). We went here last night, split an entree of Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onions in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce) for $14.69. It sounds good right? It's not. Since we have been waiting for 50 minutes to be seated and we were really hungry, to kill the time we were just hanging out at the deck. The deck was wonderful though. We could see the beauty of San Francisco especially since the sky was clear. Unfortunately, the food was not great (and this comment came from someone who was really hungry waiting for 50 minutes at which point any mediocre food would taste great) The pasta was dry and lacking of sauce, it really wasn't worth for the price. The chicken had gristle and was tough. The complimentary bread basket was much better than the pasta. (Now I'm longing for Pasta Primavera). I believe even frozen pasta could have been better than this. We also got Key Lime Cheesecake which was good. Don't come here for the food. (I would choose Elephant Bar's food anytime over Cheesecake Factory's) Don't come here expecting free or easy parking because there wasn't easy. Don't come here expecting to be seated soon. The waiting time is unbelievable. Tips: The best bet to find parking is at Union Square parking garage which charges $2.50 for 1 hour, $5 for 1-2 hours, $8.50 for 2-3 hours, and so on (I don't remember). With the usual long wait at the Cheesecake Factory, you can expect to stay around 3 hours. But don't worry, you don't have to bring cash to pay for the garage because the machine accepts credit card (Master, Visa, Discover, Amex)"
Colleen B.,"San Francisco, United States",142,1304,22,2.0,4/6/2007,"Anytime I plan to go shopping I eat first. There is nothing more loathsome than having to eat with a bunch of rabid bargain shoppers who are willing to either dine on foodstuffs that have been basking away under a heat lamp all day, or this experience. There is no reason I should receive a beeper when I walk into a restaurant. With the prices at the Cheesecake Factory I expect the slightest level of personal interaction, take my name for fuck sake! Be courteous, if you choose to work in a turn & burn dining arena accept that you have to be nice to lots of jerks that come en masse at all hours of the day. I know, Union Square is full of tourists, they need the comfort of a chain in order to feel as if they're still back in whatever suburban community they crawled out of in order to visit our fine city.  There is no reason for locals to eat here, really. The rooftop is nice, if it wasn't for the bland food and the barrage of pigeons it would almost be a decent place to kick it with dessert and a cocktail."
N K.,"Berkeley, United States",57,95,16,2.0,17/5/2007,"The only decent thing about the cheesecake factory is the cheesecake. Just get it to go and eat it at the lounge of a hotel elsewhere. The worst experience that I had dining here was because of this one cocky waiter who, for some odd reason, decided that we were to be the unlukcy dumb costumers to be tortured. He was so bitchy, for no reason and incredibly cordial to everyone else surrounding us. I'm not sure why, we didnt smell, we weren't rude, and we didnt' come in when they're about to close. He would literally be smiling to the table next to us asking them if everything were alright, they needed more water, if they were ready to order, if he could bend over backward,etc. AND THEN he turns to us and become a complete ass. I asked him if we could have some bread, to which he replied: Dick: Oh you want bread"" Me: Yea.. Dick: You dont have to have it Me: ok... From then on, i didnt even bother coming here.  With a line wait that long, you'd think that people are lining up for a ticket to heaven."
Arlene C.,"San Francisco, United States",153,408,336,2.0,13/5/2007,"If you don't mind waiting even when you have made a reservation, and taking 2 hours for lunch no matter how early you get here, then this is your place. My favorites are the Crabcake and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon (Chris Rock's favorite) sandwiches. I recommend getting the Shrimp sandwich without the middle slice of food to make it more appealing. The fish tacos are good here too. The Dulce de Leche is my favorite cheesecake. You'll have enough for another meal, no matter what you order. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day and overlook Union Square. So, so food and huge portions. Good place when you need to wear the Terry Tourist hat."
Erica B.,"Oakland, United States",22,33,27,2.0,9/5/2007,"I really wanted to like it. The Cheesecake Factory has always been my old faithful in any city I've been to. It's been near and dear to my heart since I was introduced to the Cheesecake Factory my freshman year in college. I was expecting the tasty food and drinks that I am accustomed to getting at any other CF, alas this one failed to meet the mark. Lets start with the drink. Since it's been as hot as blazes in the Bay Area (nope, not complaining), I ordered a nice refreshing mojito...except it wasn't. It mostly tasted like rum, lime juice, and sugar. I likes my mint so I was very disappointed by the mint shavings that were floating around in the drink. Food wise, the Buffalo Blasts were what earned most of the 2 stars for this visit, because really, how can you mess those up? I'm pretty sure they come pre-made. My entree was less than stellar. I got the crusted chicken romano since my favorite dish (Pasta with Pesto, Chicken and Mushrooms) had been removed from the menu. So the chicken romano was bland, the waitress didn't offer freshly grated parm (which I wanted) and as usual, the portion could feed a small family. I was expecting the cheesecake to save the day, but again, denied. My cheesecake was broken in places and it seems as if they attempted to stealthily cover it up with whipped cream. It tasted like cheesecake, which was good, but the presentation left a lot to be desired. All in all, this is probably the worst CF I've ever been to. While the wait time was decent (20 minutes on a Tuesday night) the food and service was not. Will I go back? No."
