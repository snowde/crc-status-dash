Sophie D.,"San Francisco, United States",40,304,,2.0,6/5/2007,"This is the kind of place my friend's 14-year-old sister and her ""BFFs!"" go to when they want to pretend to be adults and dine alone.  Why wait 45 minutes to be seated at a noisy restaurant that lacks any sort of charm or personality? While the menu is huge and you can order many yummy appetizers or entrees (or duh, the desserts), it really isn't worth it. Dining on top of Macy's with a sea of older tourists or 14-year-olds? No thanks. I'll go elsewhere for my cheesecake."
Kat J.,"Washington Crossing, United States",64,270,139,2.0,29/4/2007,"Love Cheesecake Factory but this location sucked.  The view is awesome, especially yesterday when it was sunny and the square was full of people lounging about and listening to the live music. So while we stood around waiting for our table (45 minutes at 4:30pm), we had a good time. Many people around us got drinks at the bar and brought them outside and we all stood in between the letters of the Macy's sign. But once you sit down to eat, you can't really see anything anymore - just the tops of buildings and the wind picks up and you're cold. The service was pretty bad as you could tell the waitstaff is losing their minds with the millions of people ordering things. We had to wait 10 minutes for our bread and drink order as they ran out of bread and the bar staff was backed up. Then, I ordered a salad with the dressing on the side and it arrived sans the dressing. I had to wait about 10 minutes before the dressing made it to my table. However, I love Cheesecake Food as their menu has fantastic variety and the drinks are very taste...expensive, but full of alcohol so you're not getting ripped off. So I'll go back to Cheesecake, just not this one."
Jennifer D.,"Tracy, United States",46,209,4,2.0,11/4/2007,"So dissapointed in this place.  First, the wait was stupidly long (and we went on a tuesday night for cryin out loud!), we were given the vibrating beeper and told it would be between 30 and 50 minutes.  When at long last the beeper buzzed we were then funneled to another wait area where we stood around for another twenty minutes waiting for our names to be called to be seated.  The seating was croweded and we ended up next to some jerks who aside from being painfully loud and obnoxious, also chimed in on our conversation (I was there with a friend visiting from out of state, so we hardly got to play much catch up with all the noise and distraction).   Our server was great, very kind, kept up with refills and keep us informed of the status of our order, but our order ""got lost"" so we had to wait even longer for food that was really not worth the drama.   On the upside, the mojitos were good."
Don H.,"Walnut Creek, United States",8,77,,2.0,8/4/2007,"Does anyone ever actually get to eat here? My girlfriend and I have been many times, often not at peak hours, and have never been told the wait would be less than 90 minutes. I know good food is a little scarce in Union Square, and this place falls more into the category of passable than good, but come on! 90 minute wait at 3pm? Don't even think about getting a drink while you wait, either. The bar area is more crowded than a Chinatown sidewalk.  The salmon firecracker rolls and the modest selection of steaks are all acceptable, but not worth the wait time."
Joy C.,"Orinda, United States",72,554,23,2.0,5/4/2007,"The cheesecake is pretty good (esp. tiramisu), food is consistently good, but not worth the price."
miriam b.,"San Francisco, United States",114,1315,1,2.0,29/3/2007,"i knew the architect's mom, but just go to a cheesecake...fatt butt factory in la-la-land..(translate for you: chicas in Los Angeles order iced tea and their boyfriends order the whatevers because the chicas watch their figures in the SiliconedHollyBollyland of muchoplastica)..you're gonna have a faster chance at getting seated and served before they call your name in this place. heard you can sometimes find their pumpkin cheesecake at Costcos..."
Drue C.,"Denver, United States",332,901,,2.0,22/3/2007,"Okay, please, someone, tell me why in the world the menu needs to be 100 pages long!!!???? It is almost as long as the wait for a table most of the time, and almost as long as it takes to track down your server for anything (even though there are 100 of them in sight at any given time, along with 100 pigeons if you dine outside)."
Kymberli C.,"Clayton, United States",136,1486,5781,2.0,20/3/2007,"I know it's our fault for coming here on a Saturday evening but we didn't mind the wait for an hour and a half, we just got drinks at the bar, got a little faded... but when we finally got seated our waiter took forever to serve us.  Our food took like 2 hours to come out.. no joke. 2 hours. We saw people being seated way after us and they were served and they left and our food didn't come yet. :(  He even forgot one of our drinks in the beginning and it came out way later too... boo!"
Erick A.,"Los Angeles, United States",22,121,2,2.0,2/3/2007,"An hour wait for a table?  30 min wait for our first round of drinks?  Room temperature spinach dip accompanied with stale tortilla chips? LAME.    i've been to the san diego and irvine locations and i don't remember them being this tragic.  what a waste of space with one of the most beautiful views of the city!  avoid this tourist trap.   i really hate to admit that the dulce de leche cheesecake we shared was fabulous, but it really was.  two stars for that."
Bernie L.,"Portland, United States",32,247,,2.0,2/3/2007,"I don't really ""get"" the whole cheesecake factory concept. Why is it called the cheesecake factory when i hardly ever see people actually order cheesecake? or a better question would be why does everyone and their mamas like this place so much? Having never actually had a full meal there, i'm only able to extrapolate certain things, but it's enough for me not to really want to grab dinner there... EVER. First, the things it's got going for it: a nice view; convenient location; a bar that serves a pleasantly strong manhattan; and some good, but not particularly inventive appetizers (e.g., fried macaroni and cheese balls). The things that kind of annoy me: the wait!! who the hell are all these people? shouldn't they be in walnut creek or something?; the associated striving for suburbanite acceptability - i.e., it has the facade of trendiness, unless you've actually been to a trendy restaurant; and overpriced menu for that type and quality of food. I suppose it's mainly the demographics of the restaurant that irk me. I know, I know... i'm a typical bay area snob. i can't help it... i've been trained well. but i really have to wonder why people want to come here. The wait is long, the food is average, and it's expensive. So what if you just went shopping in union square or just saw a show at the orpheum? there are SOOO many other culinary options to be had!!! for shorter waits and possibly smaller bills. You're in freakin' SF... ACT LIKE IT!!"
Ryan C.,"Berkeley, United States",22,96,5,2.0,22/2/2007,"i've been here 3 times, each time sucked. I don't get the hype, is it cause it's on top of a fuckin macy's??? Service is horrible, food is horrible, one time my food was even cold. However, they make damn good cheesecake. I like the godiva cheesecake."
R S.,"Brooklyn, United States",13,224,12,2.0,30/1/2007,"oh how I hate you... you're like that ugly younger sister we locked in the closet and forgot we had. Or we wanted to forget about anyway. Thanks for the gum in my water... Thanks for the long wait, followed by any even longer wait to eat because our food wasn't prepared to the head chef's expectations... After waiting two hours you don't care, you'll eat anything, so please just bring the food out. Thanks for no refills and for not comping anything even after all said above. Your saving grace, you're a chain, and fortunately I have had better experiences at alternate locations."
Kara F.,"San Francisco, United States",4,30,,2.0,19/12/2006,"I have never seen the appeal of this place.  From the second you walk into Macy's the entire experience is annoying.  First you wait forever to get in the elevator.  Then the people who got on the elevator last, get out first, and therefore put their names on the waiting list before you.  Taking the escalators up 8 stories is not practical either because of all the slow-walking Macy's customers.  Then you get upstairs and have to wait forever to get seated at a cramped table and have to wade through 100 pages of menu to figure out what you want to order.  The food is not bad, there are just a lot better places to eat while shopping or playing around in Union Square (like the Nordstrom Caf!)."
Honey L.,"San Francisco, United States",57,130,,2.0,12/12/2006,"Slow everything.  We waited an hour for a table and then ate some mediocre food.  It was so loud we couldn't talk without yelling.  There was a nice server, but slow service.  Prices are decent for the amount of food.  After dealing with Christmas crowds I wasn't in the mood to deal with the drunk people yelling at the sports show on the tv.  I also saw a tourist from Arkansas spit a huge lugie off the balcony outside.  That's the crowd you'll be eating with at this place."
Rachel B.,"Hayward, United States",122,684,111,2.0,12/12/2006,"If I wait in the 10 items or less line with a Stouffer's frozen entree and a Sara Lee cheesecake I'd probably have a better meal than I have ever had here, with a shorter wait. The cheesecake is like a brick, none of the flavors taste like more than cream cheese to me.  Go a few extra blocks to North Beach or SOMA, even if you have been shopping Union Square all day and it *seems* like the best option for dinner."
charlene l.,"San Francisco, United States",12,49,,2.0,11/12/2006,"the food is totally disgusting and greasy.  the cheese cake is good, but not that good.  the line is always so long, and the service is bad.  great view of union square though. to me, cheese cake factory just screams yuppy tourist trap.  only worth it if you are seriously craving cheesecake."
Melissa R.,"San Carlos, United States",211,89,4,2.0,1/12/2006,I have three words for this place: TOTALLY OVER-RATED.   Two stars because the food was edible and it had great views.
Dave R.,"Oakland, United States",0,26,,2.0,6/11/2006,"Had a 2+ hour lunch here, because the service was so slow.  The best part was when the server finally arrived with our drinks, the glass of red wine had ice in it.  Not a few cubes, but filled with ice.  He then tried to tell us (straight face & not kidding) that that particular syrah is always served  with ice.  We had to convince him to double check that fact.  Five minutes later, we get a glass of wine sans ice.  I know that he was new there, but how new do you have to be to serve red wine on ice?"
Shannon V.,"San Francisco, United States",92,402,,2.0,25/10/2006,"Some visiting Texan totally bogarted a bar seat instead of letting this lady (this lady, writing it) have it. i go home and cry when i realize that tourists specifically put this on the agenda when they're in town. some of them even press their pleats. the food is not horrible, actually, there are some menu things i cringingly really like (and of course the cheesecake heart attack is yum), but it is never, ever worth an hour plus wait."
J G.,"Richmond District, San Francisco, United States",55,222,,2.0,6/10/2006,"WTF? It's the same food all over the Continental US! Why the hell would you wait in line for hours to have the same meal you could have anywhere else in the US? The menu is like the Hitchhikers Guide paperback and completely overwhelming. The service... wait... what service? It's like fast food amplified. Sorry, the cheesecake might be good but I just don't have the patience."
