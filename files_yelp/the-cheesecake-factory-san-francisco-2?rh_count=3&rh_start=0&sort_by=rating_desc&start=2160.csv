Lise L.,"El Cerrito, United States",186,320,5,2.0,5/10/2006,"The food is filling and not total swill, but I usually dont find it all that exciting either. There is lots of it, but I prefer quality to quantity any day. Generally not worth the price or the wait, definitely not worth both.  I give it two stars for the bar - I love some of the desserty drinks and they are so fun and filling they make the wait bearable."
Autumn K.,"Helsinki, Finland",508,1139,4,2.0,26/9/2006,"Let's get something straight right off the bat: I'm not really a chain restaurant kinda person. I just can't handle a million generic menu items, a restaurant that seats 1,000 people, and having to carry a remote device to be notified when my table is finally ready. But alas, I gave in and met friends there. Twice. The first time, I got drunk and had to leave before we were even seated because by the time I was less than confident in my ability to walk, we had been waiting TWO hours!!!  The second time I went for the ovrewhelming noise, overpriced drinks, and mediocre food, and stayed for the puke fest that followed...and Nooooooooo, I was not drinking excessively that night. I had only had one glass of wine. And it was a puke FEST because there was more than one of us doing the puking. Two of us who shared food both got sick. So there."
Rory V.,"San Francisco, United States",27,39,,2.0,19/9/2006,"So I usually don't go to the cheesecake factory, but we were down at Union Square and wanted to sit outside, since it was such a beautiful day today. We arrived for lunch about !2:00ish and only had to wait 10 mins for a table outside, good start.... So our waiter comes and introduces him, and we order cocktails... 10 mins later still waiting for cocktails. water and bread would be nice by now....  20 mins, still no cocktails, no bread and now water.  30 mins, our waiter introduces us to a new waiter and says goodbye. As though we felt attached to him by this time. Seriously.  40 mins, cocktails finally arrive, the waiter says he'll come back to take our order.  55 mins, he's back and takes our order and tells us they don't have two of the dishes we ordered, so we change.  1hr 15 mins, apps arrive and he informs us that they don't the eggplant sandwich that I ordered. SO I ask him what else he recommends for a vegetarian. He looks at me with a blank face, and I kid you not, says ""Not Much..."" Omg, So I wait 10 seconds for a diiferent response, which doesn't come, so i grab the menu from his hand and start looking for something else. I finally found a four cheese pasta.  1hr 30 mins, food arrives, everyone else likes their's, mine's a 5 on scale from one to 10. Still no bread or water. So we order more cocktails and water. Good parts:  Outside seating, cocktails Bad Parts: Service, food, time factor, service, food, and service, did i mention service?"
Amy M.,"Oakland, United States",247,281,2,2.0,6/9/2006,"HUMONGOUS PORTIONS.  I don't think I can stress this enough.  My family (6 people) normally order appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts...  no way jose!  Not here, we ordered all that and took twelve LARGE to-go containers back to the car.  Holy cow!  I guess it's reasonably priced for how much food you're bombarded with, but honestly, who can eat that much?  That's just sad.  Great service, nice seating.  If its located on, in or near a mall it automatically gets docked at least two stars in my book.  Thanks, but NO THANKS!"
R K.,"San Francisco, United States",34,186,16,2.0,28/8/2006,"I dare not ever go to the Cheesecake Factory unless bringing guests from out of town. The food is not good, the palce is expensive, and the plates comes in way too large of portions. The place is packed on top of Macy's. The only redeeming value is that the place has lovely outdoor seating that has a nice view of Union Square."
Tony A.,"Southwest Ranches, United States",7,55,,2.0,21/8/2006,"Superlong wait, the food was just ok at best. My hamburger was lousy, the meatloaf was off...The only good things were the waitress who was very perky and the deserts were excellent. Will not wait over 15 minutes for this place again."
Bethany D.,"San Francisco, United States",53,86,,2.0,14/6/2006,"The best place to bring an out of town cousin, because tourists are convinced that this is the best we have in the city. I have to admit, at first I was enticed by the ""escalator to heaven"" vibe that you can't help but feel as you are carried to this restaurant at the top of Macy's. After a long day of shopping, any food looks good to me, and the view is much nicer than being holed up in the cellar to eat at Wolfgang Puck's. I was seated outside, and of course ordered the most extravagant cheesecake slice I could find on the menu. The waitstaff was obscenely slow, and it was a little odd that they brought us bread as an appetizer since we were only having dessert, but the thing that influenced my negative opinion of this place was the pigeons! Within seconds of recieveing my cake, I was attacked by a flock of pigeons that hurridly ate everything on my plate! And I wasn't the only one with this problem, about three or four parties at the next tables were also getting their food demolished by these pigeons. Even after all that, I still had to pay full price for the cheesecake I certainly did not eat. I guess the whole idea of eating outside, high up, is nice, but they seriously need to work on their ""customer satisfaction"" level."
Malika K.,"Los Angeles, United States",93,108,24,2.0,12/6/2006,"Looks like an over-sized Starbucks, maybe they had the same interior designers. I like the exclusive location,(on the top floor of Macy's)but by no means is this restaurant exclusive! Expect a two hour wait if you don't want to squeeze yourself into the bar. Yes they have a large variety of cheesecakes but it's quantity over quality. If you want good cheesecake just go to Blue Plate. I have a friend who really enjoys this place for some reason so I do eat here on occasion. The food to me is mediocre, similar to Apple bee's with an Asian fusion twist. *update* 12/30/6 Why do I continue to torture myself?? Over an hour wait for a table today...and then, why were all our plates, silverware and water glasses not clean? Why did our waitress neglect us?  Just a tip...if your gonna wait it out for a table mosey on down to the furniture floor with your pager there is an extreme lack of waiting room in the restaurant."
Vik S.,"San Jose, United States",78,230,3,2.0,9/6/2006,"As always, this place is an absolute madhouse upon your dissent from the escalator.  Does every tourist with no lack of common sense or manners come here?  I felt like a mouse in a cage and there were huge crowds of impolite people who treated people like inatimate objects as they pushed their way thru the chaos.  The food:  meh....ordered the ribeye - it was a salty, overly spiced, overly cooked ( medium rare is not supposed to be dark and chewy People !! ) mess.   the avocado eggrolls we tried were pretty good though.   the service:  ""happy"" gentleman,  a bit forgetful and inattentive... argh...I am going to have to move on, never again CAKE !!!"
Mori Y.,"Berkeley, United States",157,134,22,2.0,20/4/2006,"The line is pretty hellish getting into this rooftop eatery overlooking Union Square.  I'm not sure if the pager they give you when you sign in is corteous, or a nice way of saying 'f*ck off and go waste your money downstairs for a while!'  It's like any other Cheesecake Factory in America; huge portions, so-so food, decent drinks, and sub-standard over-marketed cheesecake.  HOWEVER, what makes this CF different is that you are being waited on by the finest actors and actresses that San Francisco has to offer.   Cheers!"
Melanie D.,"Mountain View, United States",41,203,1,2.0,16/4/2006,"I came here with my dinner companion last night because he had a generous gift card.  Otherwise, dinner would have been completely outrageous.  $75 for two drinks, two entrees and two desserts seems like a lot when you didn't even really like your entree and your nose was too stuffy to enjoy your dessert completely.  I tried their Jamaican shrimp and, unlike other places where I have had it, the sauce was thick like glue rather than light and flavorful.  The mango salsa was a lot on the skimpy side but at least the shrimp was cooked properly - not too tough, just tender.  Drinks were delicious but we didn't realize until later they were $8/each.  Seriously?  They were a bit small for that price.  We had cheesecake for dessert and while they were rich and creamy and good, my stuffy nose prevented me from enjoying it to the fullest, which was a tad disappointing.  I think the nicest part was the view we had from the outdoor seating of the little square in front of Macy's.  The lights twinkled from the buildings.  It wasn't as loud outside as in the restaurant (thank goodness) so even though it was a tad cold, I enjoyed it a lot more.  Overall, overpriced and disappointing entrees but a very nice view and solid desserts earn it 2 stars."
Bernardo C.,"Oakland, United States",23,96,,2.0,7/4/2006,"I'm going to steal a portion of Shoe Pavilion motto and say,  ""If you eat the Cheesecake Factory, you pay too much!"" Sorry girlfriend, this is place is overrated and I think most of the people here agree with me.  I think you just like it love because you believe its ""hype&trendy.""  I think its ""lame &...lame.""  The food sucks and the drinks are are too expensive for its size.  Its a tourist trap sweetheart, and the place looks like a tourist trap.  Thats why its always crowded.  Its not the food but the look that makes the place.  I'd rather eat at the Olive Garden for the pasta we usual get. I have to give the Cheesecake factory an extra star though for their staple, ""cheesecake.""  The Tuxedo & Godiva cheesecake is really good"
Michael M.,"San Francisco, United States",213,642,274,2.0,24/3/2006,"I really can't rate a place very highly when you have to wait for your name to be called.  You think you are set and ready to be seated, right??  No way .... you have to wait again by the post for them to seat you.  Wait times are easily 1 hour.  Nice patio, though.  I do like the bruscetta appetizer though, and the Lousiana Chicken Pasta.  Portions feed Paul Bunyan.  I cannot comment on the cheesecake because I really don't like it.  My ex really loved this place, and ""we"" took her whole family one night, and she stiffed me for the entire bill for 15 people.  I don't mind paying for half, considering it was HER family, but the whole thing??"
Amy L.,"San Francisco, United States",135,651,469,2.0,6/3/2006,"The good: it has a menu that will suit just about everyone and it has some really great cheesecake---and I generally hate cheesecake.  The bad: this location is super busy.  Expect 2 hour waits, unattentive waitstaff, and a very hurried atmosphere.  There are now enough other Cheesecake Factories around the Bay Area you have others to choose from.  Times visited: 5+"
Jackie I.,"San Francisco, United States",28,194,,2.0,7/2/2006,"Excuse me? How long is the wait? Bullshit! I'm completely baffled by the large crowds that gather at the Cheesecake Factory. The food is mediocre at best, overpriced and the wait staff are all indifferent to the idea of providing good service."
Jenni D.,"San Francisco, United States",107,313,,2.0,31/1/2006,"Go for coffee and cheesecake on the patio when the weather warms...you won't be disappointed.  If you go for food, drinks or dinner on a weekend, you'll be pissed.  Initially I was an avid fan of the ridiculously diverse menu (thai pasta to burgers to calamari) and the fully stocked bar.  I realized after about the third go (had to make sure it wasn't ""what I ordered"") that the ""diverse"" menu just means that they're not great at anything, merely ok at most things. Not much better than the average TGIRUBYAPPLEBES type entrees. Drinks are fine, but not as strong as they ought to be for the 11-14 dollar asking price.  Would be ok except for the ridiculous wait (almost constant) and the silly method of queuing customers.  First you give your name to the host, then you're called for a buzzer, then you're buzzed and put in another line...then you get a seat.  If you're going to put in an hour and a half wait, I'd head somewhere a little more special than this."
Sarah C.,"Redwood City, United States",335,284,124,2.0,20/12/2005,"If you're going to eat there DO NOT eat outside unless you're a pigeon lover. The pigeons literally eat their meals right next to you. If you shoo them away they come right back. I lost my appetite completely last time I was there. The foods okay, but not great."
Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, United States",100,2101,2101,2.0,24/10/2005,"What is perfectly acceptable in a suburban mall is offensive in Union Square. The only explanation for its popularity is that, for too many tourists, familiarity breeds content."
Mariangela S.,"San Francisco, United States",174,608,2,2.0,22/8/2005,"I admit, I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants in my day. The best one is still the original in Marina del Rey. When I lived in Boston, they opened one in an upscale mall - and the wait was 3 hours! Cheesecake Factory has an amazing business - it is the model of efficiency and branding. The menus are bound and include advertising.  It is a tourist haven though, and the wait in Macy's can last for hours. I don't have the patience, so it's a rate occasion I go there. Ok, well I was there recently. Everyone else waited for an hour, and I showed up when they were already seated. The healthiest thing was the fish tacos - although it could have fed 6 people! Trust me, stick to the fried items, frooffy drinks, and the cheesecake!"
Zell C.,"San Francisco, United States",70,425,23,2.0,17/8/2005,"I don't understand why everyone loves this place (okay, maybe 75% of its customers are tourists). The wait is ridiculous for some pricey, mediocre food.  I do admit I hold a special place in my tummy for a slice of cheesecake, but that's probably the only thing I'll ever get here. When friends drag me along, I usually order the lemon herb chicken or the chicken marsala. One word of advice: Don't ever order the fish tacos."
