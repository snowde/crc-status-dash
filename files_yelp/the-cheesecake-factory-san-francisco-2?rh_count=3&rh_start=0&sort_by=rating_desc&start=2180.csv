Marina K.,"San Francisco, United States",111,255,1,2.0,16/8/2005,"I actually like the food here. Out of the 300 things to choose from their menu, I think I've ordered about 10 different things, and haven't hated any of it. I just cannot allot more than two stars for any restaurant that consistently has at minimum of 30 minute wait time, when there are EMPTY tables in the dining room! I swear they do it on purpose, to build up the hype among the tourists. The service is usually subpar, often times requires one to repeat their order after the server has put in the request, re-request your drinks, and sometimes they'll even forget about you all together. And their dishes, while tasty, loses their appeal when you see it's massive Denny's type portions. Each dish can feed 3 people!!! And is 1.5 days worth of calorie consumption, oh and stay away from the salad, it looks like someone's garden got hoed up and put on a plate. But like I said, I have enjoyed ever meal I've had there. Definitely split your plates though, or expect to take a doggy bag home. My fav dessert there is not the cheesecake, but actually the strawberry shortcake. They use real buttermilk biscuits, and vanilla ice cream with strawberries. VERY good, and not too sweet. Oh... also, as a small note, you can tip the hostesses to get a seat slightly quicker... 15 minutes instead of the usual 30+"

Michael G.,"San Francisco, United States",229,521,498,2.0,22/4/2005,"The number of tourists that overrun this joint makes the D-Day invasion look like a pillow fight. Desserts are best ""to go."" There are just too many other choices near by. If in Marin, the Cheese Cake Factory is a bit less crowded, with little to no wait."
danielle b.,"San Francisco, United States",1,69,,2.0,20/4/2005,O.k. Sydney L. what night and time did you go and only had to wait 20-60 minutes?  If it was in the early part of the week before 7p I can see that.  Do not go here on Fri-Sat.  I have no problem with a no reservation policy but 90min to 2 hours.  Come on.  There are too many places in S.F. to put up with what my Mom is convinced is a bunch of pre-cooked/frozen food because no way can you have a 20 page menu and it's all fresh.  With so many choices I suppose there should be something for everyone.  The Daily Grill and Max's up the street are two alternatives w/similar fare.  They give you a lot and the prices aren't bad.  Some of the pastas are o.k.  I've had better cheesecake.  LUMPY mashed potatoes are not homey; just bad.  The apps/salads are the most inconsistent.  Better to try at lunch when they FIRST open or go early in the week.  They do have a full bar (lots of mixes) for those of you willing to torture yourselves and wait 2 or more hours.
Nic O.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,9/1/2018,"If I could give a zero-star rating, I would. Two women sit at the bar area. We order food and drinks as well as dessert as we are celebrating a birthday. It's football Sunday with 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter. Our previously COMPLETELY unattentive waitress just suddenly cops an attitude and says loudly ""you know you can LEAVE ANYTIME NOW"". I was shocked. I still had wine in my glass and half a cheesecake on my plate. I said to her ""I'm watching the game"". I hope she wasn't surpised by receiving a tip that reflected her service and attitude. As a tourist, it definitely turned me off of going to chains instead of sampling local mom and pop places. This location was a no-no per the culinary cabbie for a reason."
Oxana B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,1.0,8/1/2018,"We got lettuce wraps for 15$, not worth it. The  4 little pieces of chicken were burnt. The 17$ toscan chicken  on the other hand was not cooked. So we were chewing on some plain chicken. Don't expect quality food from them, you'll be disappointed."
Casey S.,"Alameda, United States",1264,1302,269,1.0,5/1/2018,"I know there's that whole stigma going around that millennials don't like chain restaurants, but The Cheesecake Factory was just plain bad. Sure, the view of Union Square is nice, but it took an hour and a half just to get a table for two on a random Tuesday evening. Once we were seated, service came by intermittently. The jambalaya pasta wasn't great or terrible, but I got a bad case of food poisoning the following day. If you're in the area, I'd just go to Bartlett Hall or Katana-Ya instead."
SJ B.,"Vallejo, United States",1,47,6,1.0,1/1/2018,Wait is ridiculous and cashier was rude about my order for cheesecakes. It was just one measly cheesecake!
Joseph R.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,4,1,1.0,30/12/2017,"Waited 15 minutes to check in downstairs. Had to come back 40 minutes later to check in upstairs to get a buzzer, then kept going back to the desk and ask when will I be seated and each time they kept pushing people ahead of us. Then finally complained and they sat us in the back table in patio. We already knew what we wanted to order and ordered immediately sitting down. Which then took us another 45 minutes to get one dish mind you there was two of us. So I ate my food alone until a manager came out and brought the 2nd dish. He just apologized for the wait. I had to literally ask him is there anything else he can do for me besides an apology, maybe discounts free drinks free something. He then gave us a cheesecake for free. NOT COOL!!! This turn out to be a 3 1/2 hour event when it should've been 2 hours."
Sonny I.,"Hercules, United States",0,2,,1.0,29/12/2017,"It's our wedding anniversary, we had lunch here, arrived at 12:30 pm of 12/29/17. We were told wait time is 50 minutes. There's a lot of people waiting so I wasn't surprised we got the table after 1 hour & 15 mins. The lady who accompanied me to the table was looking for the other 2 as we reserved for 3 people, told her they went downstairs. She told me next time at least 2 people must be waiting & not just leave (well, if they were true to their words wait time was 50 minutes, they would have been around). Anyway, told her they bought a sandwich in Starbucks as my daughter was hungry waiting.  We were ready to order as we were really hungry(obviously it's almost 2 pm). Anyway to make the long story short, we got the main course order after over an hour, steak BURNT & we were told the other order was lost & was given to another table. So they have to cook it again....another wait. We never complained to anybody (we always don't when we eat in a resto) as we're afraid they might put something on our food before they serve it. Waiter was not even apologetic about the situation."
Bobby V.,"Riverside, United States",119,6,8,1.0,28/12/2017,Waited 2 hours and the almost an hour for our food. The hostess was really rude. I'll never come back to this place
Gina T.,"Fullerton, United States",0,11,,1.0,27/12/2017,"Restaurant AND Door Dash review: Food was cold, not even Luke warm. Fries missing. Waited 2 hours for my food. Canceled my original order because they were out of wings but still charged my card anyway. Mistake ordering a second time. I called the restaurant to let them know and they didn't care nor apologize and intentionally put me on hold for 9 minutes and never returned to the phone. I will never go back there. Driver was also unapologetic and said there was nothing he could do because ""he's just the driver"". Never using Door Dash again. Literal 4th time I've had orders with incorrect items or missing items."
tammy z.,"Los Altos, United States",0,4,,1.0,26/12/2017,"Aside from what others have said about food being served cold and of poor quality, my feet stuck to floor as if a previous occupant had spilled a drink and it was never cleaned up."
Scot M.,"Turlock, United States",81,33,18,1.0,24/12/2017,I love this restaurant but I was super disappointed in the quality of my disk. We had a big group so it added to the issue. But... My food was cold. One other person had to send his steak back. I think they should expect big groups especially this time of year. It's too bad because they have an amazing menu but that means nothing if the food is chilly.
ßenjämin Ä.,"Los Angeles, United States",11,193,54,1.0,23/12/2017,"Raw chicken!! Completely unacceptable by any means. Clearly this means the kitchen staff was rushed to get food out with no supervision by the kitchen management. Sloppy, sloppy food preparation practices. This place should be avoided unless you feel like taking a chance at catching salmonella poisoning."
Jann B.,"San Francisco, United States",135,83,112,1.0,19/12/2017,"On hold for 15 min in hopes to put in a to-go order. Called back to speak to someone else and was placed on hold again.  The hostess I spoke to mentioned that she was unable to take my order and that someone from the bakery would be able to assist me. However after another 8 min or so of waiting, I eventually hung up.  -_- Come ooooon."
Arlene A.,"Kenmore, United States",0,19,,1.0,17/12/2017,"We ate there on a Friday night knowing it would be busy. They told us they don't take reservations, but gave us instructions to come back at a certain time and we would get a buzzer. A forty minute wait for the buzzer only led to another 15 minute wait for someone to take us to our table. All four of us had something wrong with our meal...no dressing on a salad, no chicken in the fettuccine, and then we were told that a shared plate had been sent to the wrong table! So two of us had to wait while the others ate...never a good moment. Then our waitress went on her break....but nobody else had been assigned to us nor did we know until she finally returned. Not the best time we have had at a Cheesecake Factory...."
S.J. T.,"Richmond, United States",1,13,,1.0,17/12/2017,"If I could give this place no stars I would however I guess yelp is the only one that feels sorry for these places so I'll begin. Arrived at around 1005 am.. Seated at approximately 1020. Had a weird ass Server. Looked like a character from the Adams Family movie... My guest and I didn't receive our food until around 1053... I order the Brunch combo and that includes pancakes.. the butter was hard as a brick.. Eggs were scrambled hard as if they used the concrete on a hit ass day in the south... will not return under any circumstances for this bullshit. Guests who sat 2 tables down received their food within 15 minutes of ordering. Customer service at the counter sucked as well.. cheesecake, step your game up.. I should've just went to McDonalds and got the hot cakes and sausage breakfast with plastic wear."
Elle B.,"Pinole, United States",0,6,,1.0,9/12/2017,"This is a review about the man in the front counter who was taking cheesecake orders. An African-American male,  his name is Gary (name on my receipt) he is very unfriendly,  very poor customer service. He shouldn't be in the front counter. Dec 8th, Friday, we had office lunch there, our server was very nice though,  but on our way out,we decided to get cheesecake for take out. We spent over $400 on lunch, the food was good, everything was fine  it's just that this guy at the counter was totally an a_ _! I ordered plain cheesecake,  he asked me if it's a slice, I said"" No, I want one whole round cheesecake"" He said ""What?"" I repeated myself and he said, ""Please elaborate"" and he moved the big cheesecake cardboard menu next to him to point to me the menu. As an order taker,  you should ask what size I want or tell me the sizes of cheesecake they carry, especially for customers who are not familiar with the sizes they carry-- they have 6 inches, 7 inches cake etc. Aside from that,  I waited a good 15 mins for my 6inch cheesecake order which I didnt really mind if he would have just said ""Thank you for waiting,  sorry about that, or have a nice day"" or whatever, but nothing, he just bagged the cheesecake and turned his back. No Thank you, no eye contact, no nothing.  Very rude. So I yelled ""THANK YOU "" he just pretended he didn't hear me, I guess."
Abbie K.,"Rohnert Park, United States",93,12,1,1.0,4/12/2017,"Wow this is the worse place to go to ever!!!!!! I sat out side they didn't warn us on how chilli it was gonna get. The server wasn't even nice from the get go! When we asked to change our seats inside she got upset, we said we know it's an inconvenience but it's was making our food experience miserable. She then told us after we left the table that are food was ready after waiting over an hour. She basically said that if our food was cold it was are prob. Then we talk to the manger MIke and he did not care at all. We told him that we would pay for our drinks and leave. He didn't care at all and when I asked him why he didn't care he said nothing. We paid 30 for to drinks. When he gave us the check back he also gave us the wrong change and tried to short us $10. Don't come here worse customer service ever. Warning your better off with anything other than this."
