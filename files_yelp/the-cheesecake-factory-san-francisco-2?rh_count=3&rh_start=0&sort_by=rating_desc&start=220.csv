Donna Lee S.,"Holtville, United States",0,17,,5.0,4/9/2012,I sat at the bar. It's the Cheesecake Factory... You can never go wrong here. It never seems to fail me. If you want to be in an elegant and affordable setting I would highly suggest this place. I'm not to sure on the servers here but I do new the bartenders were really friendly
John W.,"Sacramento, United States",15,70,12,5.0,12/7/2012,"This location, as with most other Cheesecake Factory locations, is always crowded.  The food is usually very good, but the service is hit and miss.  Because of the large crowds, the waiters can sometimes be overwhelmed and not particularly friendly.  Some of the seating, particularly at the back of the restaurant (opposite side from the bar), is very close and it feels like you're sitting at your neighbor's table.  The floors are also always very slippery.  The outside view of Union Square, though, is always beautiful. On our most recent visit, our waiter (Andrew P.) was extremely nice.  In addition to excellent service, he offering us advice on where we could see the 4th of July fireworks.  We'll be sure to ask for a table in his section next time we visit this location. If you have time to wait for a table, this is a great restaurant with a huge selection of meals and enormous portions.  Bring your appetite!"
Elena A.,"San Francisco, United States",79,41,309,5.0,1/7/2012,"I 1st came to this Cheesecake Factory location in (2007) with my boy friend. I heard so many good things about it, I was just dying to try it out. My employee's would always brag about it. So, I got him to take me there. That visit was all I imagined & more. So, I recently rounded up my friends back in February of this year & off we went.  It is always quite a long wait. So, be prepared. If you don't have ant patience you better venture else where.  Now this, Cheesecake factory just happens to be located in Macy's Union square you catch the elevator & up you go to the floor with amazing food & ambiance. I love the interior of this place it's like a formal but contemporary. The lighting is dim to set a romantic tone. It is just gorgeous on the inside makes yo feel like your really somewhere special. You also have the option of outdoor seating & heated outdoor seating at that. As they have torches or heating lamps set up. The view is amazing as your over looking union square, sky scrapers & the outdoor ice skating rink. My friends & I took this seating option. Now, on to my favorite part the food. I had the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane:mouth watering  Shrimp Scampi sautéed in buttery garlic white wine sauce,  sprinkled in basil and tomato. The steak Diane is something to talk about juicy Angus Beef Steak cooked to perfection  covered with black peppercorns smothered  in a  rich mushroom wine sauce with a side of wonderful  garlic mashed potatoes. This honestly has to be the very best steak I've had in a while & I have not came across a steak as good since unfortunately. This whole meal was worth every last dime. I'm yearning for it as we speak.  Now let's get down to the Cheesecake part of the Cheesecake factory as that is what they are known for. I had the over the top  Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. Let me tell you what this bad boy consist of: velvety Hershey's Cheesecake along with soft luscious Chocolate Cake. It is oh so moist. That's not all its  topped with Creamy Chocolate Frosting with a whole wall of Chocolate Chips. Oh, this is it for any chocolate lover. It is rich but not over bearing. It's heaven in every bite. Not only is it delicious but it  is a work of art. It is almost too pretty to eat. My boy friend doesn't even like sweets & he loved there cheese cake & that says a lot. I love them I must come back soon. There food is calling me! -Elena ;)"
Roxana L.,"New York, United States",70,82,67,5.0,8/6/2012,I absolutely love cheesecake factory!! It's one of those places where you can pretty much order any type of food (burgers/pastas/chinese/mexican/sushi...) which is why it's so awesome :) Most recent visits: -Pastas: I've tried many different pastas they offer and my favorite would be the fettucini with chicken and sundried tomatoes.  The sundried tomatoes = the best! It really gives the whole dish a bang! -Burgers: New found love. Must get the smokehouse bbq burger! This is seriously a really good burger: bacon/onion rings/melted cheddar and the bbq ranch sauce yummm!!  -Blueberry cheesecake was really good too! My favorite part was the crust!! My first 5 star review because I always leave feeling full and happy =) *Be sure to avoid eating too much of the free bread because the portions they serve are HUGE! Save room for cheesecake too.
Patrik S.,Sweden,4,13,,5.0,25/4/2012,I had the Godiva chocolate Cheesecake and it was as good as it gets!
Aaron S.,"Hamburg, Germany",22,51,3,5.0,18/4/2012,"If you don't like Cheesecake then you are not truly living! True Cheesecake is creamy, smooth, and a bit sweet. All these things you will experience when you have Cheesecake from the world famous Cheesecake Factory. If you are in San Francisco it is a must stop while you are there. They also are known for other specialties such as apple and cherry pie. You can even make a meal out of it! That's right I said a meal! Ok they have a fully functioning restaurant as well so it is not just Cheesecakes but let's be honest you are going there for the Cheesecake!"
Ryan A.,"San Leandro, United States",39,20,56,5.0,14/4/2012,"So this is my first time visiting the cheesecake factory. I noticed that it was packed, so it must be that good. I really enjoyed the short time it took for me to wait. When I had gotten my seat, Doug the waiter asked me if it was my first time visiting cheesecake factory. Indeed it has been my first time, so he helped by telling me many different things that were on the menu including soups and his favorite. I had some wheat bread that was slightly like a piece of a baguette but it was hot fresh sweet and delicious. My food is hot fresh and prepared to my exact specifications ""medium-well"" and I take my first bite of this flavorful steak and salmon. I felt as though my taste buds were crying tears of joy. It was that good. The Raspberry Lemonade I had ordered was also good. This was so good I got full and I hardly get full. Nice service Nice environment Bring your appetite you won't regret it"
Michelle C.,"San Francisco, United States",1,34,12,5.0,8/4/2012,"Good inexpensive food. Been going there for years. The food is good, the appetizers are delicious! Hang with my girlfriends there it's a nice place to hangout and spend time and catch up"
Talal A.,"San Francisco, United States",10,4,,5.0,4/4/2012,great view .. great food .. great service ... never had to wait more than 5 minutes in week days ofcource love it
Paul B.,"Dallas, United States",176,241,2,5.0,22/3/2012,"The food and service at this Cheesecake factory are nothing out of the ordinary. It's pretty much just like any other Cheesecake factory in those respects. But the view! This Cheesecake factory sits on the top floor of the Macy's building in Union Square Park, and it really is a great view. It is a chain restaurant, but it feels like you're eating at the coolest spot in the city when your'e there.  Expect a long wait if you go there. It's a cool spot, and everyone else knows it, so it could take you a while to be seated. I think it's worth it though. Enjoy!"
RickyRicardo J.,"San Jose, United States",2,9,,5.0,12/3/2012,"Love Ashely great customer service!!! She's great, awesome, fantastic!!!!!! He gets a 10 I will come back"
Cynthia D.,"San Francisco, United States",403,66,4,5.0,11/3/2012,"I have been here at least three times and I gotta say I love this place.  The only catch is the long wait (because there's no reservations) but you just gotta time it right. But thank god for Macys. Cheesecake Factory is right above Macy so you can explore around the top two floors until the table is ready.  I love to eat, I eat a lot but this place really makes me full. You know what I'm talking about right? Those days where you are too full that you might puke? Yeah, only go there with an empty stomach you won't regret it. During lunch, their portions may not seem like a lot, but trust me it's HECKA FILLING. If you look hard enough, you don't have to kill your wallet for a good lunch. They do have that extra SF Health Charge thing going on but hey, it tastes good, you get good bread and butter, you get good service. You get to eat in a lively, clean, comfortable, fancy setting. What more could you possibly want?  If you are looking for a five star restaurant with a dress code, then get out of here. You gotta look somewhere else. This place is perfect for prom night, birthday dinner or even a casual lunch.  If you come here for dinner and it's a bit chilly outside, don't fear. That's why we have heat lamps invented. If you choose to eat outside, you can totally eat on the patio ish area where you get an amazing view of Union square. Here's a SF secret, come to the Cheesecake factory at night time during Christmas time, you get to see the tall bright tree. That's like a room with a view but a dinner with a view and a heat lamp. HOW COOL IS THAT? Here's another SFsecret, come during the chinese new year parade, you can watch the parade without the crowds and stinkbombs.  The icing on top would be that if you do choose to eat outside, you can have a candle lit on your table. SF can be pretty windy so if it is windy outside and you choose to have a candle on, it might go out in a few minutes.  I recommend all of my friends to come here when we have money and time. If you have nothing to do and you want to eat a lot of American food, definitely this is the place to go, especially right after shopping."
Stephen W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,11,,5.0,26/2/2012,"I have gone here at least 20 times; that should say something! The food is consistently good, and I am full when I leave. The menu is huge with just about anything anyone could want to eat. I love the crab cakes, although they are one of the more expensive and smaller dishes. The atmosphere is good and the staff is professional. I will be back again!"
Angela T.,"Santa Clara, United States",44,28,23,5.0,23/2/2012,The atmosphere was great.  Eat on the patio for shop'tastic view! I recommend the white chili chicken. It's a little spicy but WOW what a delicious meal.
Ashley P.,"San Jose, United States",132,23,4,5.0,7/1/2012,"I've never had The Cheesecake Factory before this because I was determined to try this location first. I grew up in Fremont and during High School and my friends and I would try and go every time we were in San Francisco but the wait was always just too long. I tried to go again while visiting the city during my college years and alas the wait was too long for us. Finally six years after my first attempt to dine here I finally came here with my boyfriend and his mom during a lunch on a random Tuesday afternoon. SUCCESS!! The view was amazing and we got to sit near the window (not outside because it was too cold). Our waiter was awesome and even hooked us up with some very delicious ""hot sauce"" but I think it was just chili sauce used for their ahi salad or something. I had the Crusted Romano Chicken with Alfredo pasta. SO DELICIOUS!!! I'm wanting to go back soon just for that! My boyfriend got the jambalaya pasta which was good but definitely does not beat his mother's jambalaya. His mom got the orange chicken which was good too. I liked that the portions were huge but I wish their bread basket had some better breads in it, they were too tough for my liking. OOO and I got the red velvet cheesecake which was SO AMAZING! I'm a red velvet girl for sure and it was everything I wanted and more! My boyfriend got the snickers cheesecake and I do not know how it tasted myself because he devoured it before I even got a chance to try a bit, I think he liked it.  We will have to come back again soon."
Tisha H.,"San Pablo, United States",3,50,32,5.0,11/12/2011,"This place is amazing!! the view from the roof top.. Breath taking! My fiance and I decided to go to the cheese cake factory at the last minute last night.. They close at 12:30.. we arrived at 12:10am.. they still seated us and fed us hot fresh delicious food.. It's my birthday weekend and i must say the service was even better than the food.. Our waiter was super funny, chill, and laid back! we had such a great experience that we left the waiter a $15 tip!! IDK if it was the service or the extremely strong Spiked milkshake that he gave me.. Thank You Cheese cake factory for another wonderful time! :)"
Blessed Z.,"Daly City, United States",50,38,61,5.0,26/11/2011,I love cheesecake factory! last night was amazing me and my girlfriend watches the christmas tree lighting at union square and decides to have dinnner here again! Our waited (we didnt catch his name) but he was amazing. I asked him what can get me full because I didnt eat the whole day and suggested the chicken little in my head I said that doesnt sound like its gonna make me full so I gave it a try. Once the order came to our table me   girlfriend.was shocked and amazed how much food it was on a huge plate! Very good suggestion! For dessert I got the red velvet cheesecake. But then my girlfriend was stuck in a dilemma between getting the macadamian something cheesevake or the tuxedo cheesecake. So our waitersaid both was very delicious and had told us that go with whatever your craving for but presentation wise I would go with the tuxedo cheese cake. And we went with that! Wow it was greeeeeeaaaatttttt & got us so full. It sucks cuz ee couldnt finish it so we decided to just give it to the homeless person who had asked for it. The thing I.dont like about this place is waiting in line for so long. And they dont do reservation. Sucks for the people that   wait 4hours just to be seated. Overall this place is amazing. Specially when you get the   the patio. Great view of the whole union square with a nice breeeze!
d p.,"Linden, United States",3,45,13,5.0,12/11/2011,This place is awesome we were in the city for fleet week and tried this for the first time delish and we sat outdoors the views were great - a little cold they could use another heater or two but over all very good cant wait to return to this location we have however eaten at the Arden Fair mall location in Sacramento and that one is also good and we will be trying the others too
Tawny P.,"Montclair, United States",46,62,49,5.0,9/11/2011,"Ok, so we all know that the Cheesecake Factory is DELICIOUS!! Especially their Cheescake of course!! BUT HELLO!!! DID YOU SEE THE VIEW?!!
