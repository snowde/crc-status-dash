Brian B.,"San Diego, United States",289,127,68,1.0,28/11/2017,"I totally get why you only average 3 stars you have zero focus on service! I arrived told 20 min wait. Got pager waited in the bar. While waiting I noticed at least 10 2 tops open. 15 min Later a seat opened at the bar. I ordered a small salad and chicken Marcella. After 40 min nothing arrived, I asked bartender and he said its coming. Also again asked about bread said it was coming also another 10 min goes by now here for 50 min and a manager stops by to say sorry salad is taking so long we ran out of croutons. I said I'm good without croutons brought salad he asked if I wanted cracked pepper I said yes. Never cam back! I was out of tea food I could eat at one hour I gave up! Asked for a manager got same manger who did not bring pepper and he said sorry and walked off! Seriously guys service remember what that is? Never again Cheesecake Factory I guess you just want tourists !  Oh one more thing in the hour and 10 minutes I was at Cheesecake my pager never went off and the tables the two top by the bar were never seated empty the whole time I was there! When I asked about it as I left she told me she could not find me in system! Really?"
Delone J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,27/11/2017,This is an overrated place for people and majority of the people are tourists. The restaraunt is usually crowded with a lot of people. One day i decided to go there with my girlfriend at night and the wait time was REALLY LONG. It was an hour of wait time. As we waited and got seated the workers were really rude and didn't take our orders. The food card and they were large portions but it tasted really basic. I paid 40 dollars for only two orders not including tips. The pasta was not good and it made my girlfriends stomach hurt.
Brooke T.,"San Ramon, United States",13,37,3,1.0,25/11/2017,"I'm usually a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this time something was off. First, all but one of our meals were brought out. We waited 10 minutes while our food got cold, and still no other order. Then the manager comes along stating that the pasta was taken to a different table...you'd think that since all the meals were cold and that we still needed to wait for them to remake the pasta that at a minimum the pasta would have been taken off the table, but nope! Then, we go and order a whole Cheesecake and we get home to find out it's FROZEN. So now only was the dinner shit, we couldn't even enjoy the dessert. Based on the numerous times we saw the manager running around and apologizing to tables, it's clear something needs to change. It was definitely a huge let down and a waste of an hour wait."
Jean D.,"Laguna Beach, United States",0,22,,1.0,17/11/2017,"You will wait 90 minutes for table, your thing buzzes, and then you will Wait another 45 minutes. Get it together you guys, I won't ever be back! Update...still Here. NEVER EVER Also- 22 min line to get in the elevation to get OUT of this shit show.  Angry staff yelling instructions about elevator rules. Horrible horrible place. Anyone with anxiety, don't come Here or die."
Elizabeth Z.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,12/11/2017,"This is my first maybe second time here I can't remember, and I have a decent amount of patience but I got here at 9 and I'm not leaving until 10:30 it took about 10-15 mins to get me 3 boxes. Just sucked for a pretty new customer"
Jalpa P.,"Santa Clara, United States",3,14,,1.0,10/11/2017,"Very very bad Management we waited for more than 100 mins (6000 secs) for a party of 8 to get the table. Manager was David and he told us we will get the table in 90 mins, we patiently waited but never got any response from cheesecake staff of how long will it take.. People come to cheesecake for good food but there MAN and TIME management needs a lot of improvement I wish they can be more predictable about the wait times or atleast have some courtsey to appreciate our time."
Sierra W.,"San Francisco, United States",457,25,2,1.0,24/10/2017,"Tip begging? Disgusting. ""Benaster J"" really made us uncomfortable. I come to cheesecake all of the time but it's about time that we find somewhere else to come weekly."
Nathan V.,"South of Market, San Francisco, United States",0,2,,1.0,22/10/2017,Getting a table is long enough but I guess that's nothing because I expected to have food on my plate is twenty to thirty minutes but no I had to wait one hour and they didn't even bother to tell us how long it would take or that our waitress went on break not only that but apparently it takes forty five minutes to make a simple soda and they even forgot to add flavoring I do not suggest going here.
Kay E.,"West Covina, United States",23,3,,1.0,12/10/2017,"We went to get some dessert to go tonight.  There was a 35 minute wait to place an order for a slice of cheese cake to go.  The lady at the counter was very apologetic and said they are trying a new system and it is slowing them down.  After finally placing our order we waited an additional 10 minutes.  The desert was put on the counter, but no one was there to pack it and release it to the recipient.  Finally a person came and started packing. When I told him that we waited 45 minutes for a slice of cheese cake his response of ""we have many things to do"" really upset me.  I do not recommend this place.  Terrible customer service."
Cory T.,"San Francisco, United States",94,26,5,1.0,5/10/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory! But on this visit I have to say I will probably never return. Yes this location always has a wait, it's hit or miss with customer service. I had places an order for the Mac and cheese burger. I waited about 45min and someone other then my waiter brought out my food. I noticed lots of bacon sticking out, so I mention that she must have the wrong table. She then informed me that that's what I ordered! I then told her I have never eaten bacon in my Whole life. She said well that's what you ordered, And walked away. I then asked the next person I saw and asked her for my waiter, and she told me he was on a break. I told her the situation, she left, came back and said he put in a bacon burger. She then left as well. At no time did anybody offer to get me what I wanted. My server came back and I informed him, her was very sorry for the mistake. At this point I had ate the fries but nothing else. He offered to replace my burger, I told him I couldn't wait any longer for what I had ordered. I brought me the check and offered me some cheesecake. He made it sound like he was going to give it to me for the mistake. I asked for it to go, he then gave me the cheesecake, and my check. I had still been rung up for the burger, I then noticed also the cheesecake. So I paid for a burger I didn't even eat.  I will never be back!!!"
Magda G.,"Stockton, United States",0,12,8,1.0,1/10/2017,"This was the first time we ate breakfast here. We came to celebrate my sons birthday and have some breakfast. The hostess was very welcoming and accommodating. With that said, our server wasn't too pleasant. I ordered coffee and I had to waive someone down to ask for sugar. By the time I got my sugar, my coffee was cold. That's how long it took to get service. We were in the corner and was frustrated to see 4 people grouped together and no one offering any help when I'm raising my hand. I felt like it took a long time to receive our food too. Thank god for the bread they served or we would have been starving. When the food arrived, it arrived cold. Our server must have left it up there for sometime. He failed to provide us all with silverware. I had to get up to get my own silverware because no one would come by. The food was not to par. Most of the food was left on our plates. Needless to say, the service and food sucked! It was an expensive mistake!"
Gerald-Mina K.,"Marin, United States",48,13,,1.0,30/9/2017,"Knew there was going to be a wait, as this location is always busy, but don't tell us 55 minutes for a party of 5, and stupid us waited 2 hours. Don't mind waiting, but tell us the real wait time, so we can decide for ourselves if we want to waste our time waiting. Then they try to sit us outside when we specifically asked for inside, causing us to wait another 15 minutes. The system here needs to be improved. Most disorganized Cheesecake Factory ever. Too bad we were craving their food. On top of all that, the AC was broken, so it was stifling in the restaurant. Hope someone from corporate reads these reviews, will also be reaching out to them directly."
Yanci K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,6,1.0,27/9/2017,"I never tried the food terrible like here,if I can I will give no star,I will pass here forever"
Paula V.,"San Francisco, United States",454,74,77,1.0,17/9/2017,"Really upset with how much time I was put on hold for this order (about 45 min and called three times), the amount of waiting time my friends had to go through in picking up the cake (lost order for payment and lost order for pickup/questioning payment?!), with the quality of this presentation. I REPEAT, I am NEVER ordering a cake here ever again. This presentation is unacceptable to me especially for calling in an order 6 hours early and paying extra for the birthday note."
K H.,"Webster, United States",0,22,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Been here several dozen times. I do takeout with pickup out at the curb. The last visit was so bad that I am considering never coming back. I love the Crispy Cuban rolls. This time the dipping sauce was white and bland, not mustardy with pickles. The French country salad was all bitter red raddicio and no asparagus, 2 tiny pieces of pecans and 2 pea size of goat cheese. No beets! The main course was OK. The manager offered no apology and said Corporate changed the dipping sauce. Bad move if it's true.  Some times the entree varies in consistency as does the size of the cheesecake."
Daniela L.,"Lompoc, United States",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Our experience here ruined the Cheesecake Factory hype for us. There was a 40 minute wait and we ended up waiting one hour and a half because one of the hosts gave our table away to another group and we let the other hosts know and they all seemed to ignore us. We finally got our table after an hour and a half and our server was rude.  Not going back, go somewhere else it's not worth the hype."
Pierre R.,"Pleasanton, United States",2,7,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Let's keep this short like their service and sweet like their views.  Pros: Terrace views* Cons: Terrible service, mediocre good, *pigeons all over the terrace"
Mark R.,"South San Francisco, United States",91,121,286,1.0,4/9/2017,This place just ruined my birthday.  If you're thinking about coming here with more than ten people think twice or you'll be waiting two hours for a table.  And they kept lying to us about the availability of our table because they accidentally gave it to another party.  I could careless about the view it's not that great.  And the food was not that great.  The server was great and she did her job wonderfully.  The one star is for her.  And for the Cheesecake Factory and their hostesses a big middle finger.  Im never going back to any Cheesecake Factory again.
Alfred R.,"Daly City, United States",9,3,1,1.0,3/9/2017,"This place is ludicrously overrated.  Today I came here with a party of 11 and we were waiting here for 2 hours.  Customer service was abysmal, the host and hostesses kept telling us over and over that it would be another half hour every half hour.  The wait seemed endless and even when we were seated things didn't look up.  We waited a good 20 minutes before a server came over and asked to take our orders.  I know that this is a hotspot for tourists and the like, but that's no excuse for the disappointing service my family and I experienced today.  I don't even need to talk about the food to know that I'm never coming back here."
Marsh M.,"Suisun City, United States",10,1,,1.0,2/9/2017,"This doesn't even deserve 1  star but a big fat 0. My boyfriend and I were at the city and decided to eat at Cheese Cake factory since it's been years that we ate in that particular restaurant. It was too hot in the restaurant like they try to coo you, the hostess was rude, she told this guy to give us a seat and he just sped and not even looking if we were behind him, the waitress sucked. The food was alright but not the best and took too long. My recommendations? If you ever go to the city, don't waste your time, money in the restaurant, find somewhere else that is way far better that Cheese Cake Factory."
