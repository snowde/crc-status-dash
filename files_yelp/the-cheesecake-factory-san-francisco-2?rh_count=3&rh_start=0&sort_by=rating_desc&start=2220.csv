AndRea J.,"Oakland, United States",75,13,6,1.0,24/8/2017,Where should I start with this location. Its at a nice location. The staff are very rude to customers. Some of the host walk off to get on the phones.the servers and managers eat off desert and regular food plates before they get to the customers. They have friendly pets aka rottens. They give out dirty dishes and stuff thats been on the floor.  If you ever eat here stand by the kitchen and just watch the workers cook your food smh its nasty. If I could give no stars I would. They need to bri g ppl in thats passionate about what they do.
Lorraine G.,"Simi Valley, United States",0,3,2,1.0,21/8/2017,"Absolutely horrible. Management Will, is extremely horrid and disrespectful. I will never eat here again. Management treated me and my party as if we were scum. If you want to be treated like crap and disrespected eat here. We asked for a window seat to see the view and the restaurant denied us and made us feel bad for requesting. The manager threatened to not give us service because we were upset they could not respect our anniversary request. We were so uncomfortable we did not want our meal and management threatened to call security in us."
H W.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,5,,1.0,21/8/2017,"If you absolutely *must* eat here for some reason, do it during off-hours, not when there's a dinner-time rush - that way you increase the chances that there will be semi-decent service and conscientious preparation of your entrees. Otherwise, it's a madhouse, and you will wait an absurdly long time for a table, for your food, and finally for your check. And when you get your food, it very likely will not be prepared right.  I do feel bad for the front desk staff, as I know they're trying hard to keep the flow of guests and tables moving along smoothly. But some members of the waitstaff here are not at all pleasant, and it is very clear that they'd rather be doing something else. I spent half of my meal here looking for the waiter. I had to get up and chase him down to get the check, as I'd spent too much time craning my neck and waving my hand to get his attention.  Even if you've enjoyed eating at other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past, be wary about eating at this Union Square location. The huge number of guests on certain nights and the fact that many of these out-of-towners won't be back in town again for the foreseeable future, if ever, might make the staff here less likely to provide good service. (Though with sites like Yelp, you'd think the prospect of crappy reviews would still provide some incentive for semi-decent service.)"
Sabrina R.,"Livermore, United States",9,36,25,1.0,19/8/2017,"Terrible service! We waited for 45 minutes, but we didn't get a table. So we bought cheesecakes, but we waited for 20 minutes while 3 servers were chatting  behind the desk instead to give attention for the customers. I am very very disappointed."
Baihuan Z.,"San Francisco, United States",70,1,,1.0,19/8/2017,Got my order wrong twice. Asked for medium on my steak and got well done twice. Waiting so long just for them to do my steak wrong too.
Natalie V.,"Boston, United States",23,2,,1.0,17/8/2017,"I usually don't write reviews, but my visit to cheesecake was so horrible it deserved one. I would put ZERO STARS if I could. A couple of friends and I went for dinner and were sat on the terrace. We were sat in the very back on a sticky and unclean table, which was a little black table not one of the granite tables, next to the where they take all the dirty dishes. They knew it was disgusting too because after repeatedly wiping the table down we were asked if we'd like extra napkins to place on the table.  Our server, Sierra H., came quickly to get our order. Approx 5 minutes later we asked politely if it was possible to switch to a different table and our server curtly told us that because she already put in our order we couldn't move. No wonder she tried to get us to order as fast as possible. When our server brought our napkins with our forks and knives, both my fork and knife had left over food on them. For drinks, we just got water and two of the cups were yellow and dirty.  To top our terrible visit off, once we paid and were getting ready to leave our server loudly said ""wow I f***ing hate teenagers"". At first I wasn't sure if I heard her correctly, but my friend then said she also heard her say that about us. This was the WORST customer service I've ever had at restaurant. Don't come here."
Tatiana A.,"Santa Clarita, United States",46,1,,1.0,17/8/2017,"If it were up to me, i would give ZERO STARS! I'm a first time San Francisco traveler, and so after a long day of walking and climbing up hills we decided to go to Cheesecake to relax and eat some good food. First off, they sat us at this cruddy table. It was really dirty and super sticky. Also, they served us water in dirty cups. They were yellow and disgusting. Then our waitress was super rude. I went with my two friends, and we are all in university. We asked the waitress, Sierra H., if we could move tables and she gave us attitude saying we can't move because it was too late and put our orders in. We did not give her a hard time and we understood, so we just accepted it and made the best of it. By the end of the night we were leaving and we heard her talking crap about us saying, ""I just hate serving f***ing teenagers,"" directly implying to us. We had never given her any type of attitude, only asked if we could move tables and did not give her a hard time for anything. And I have worked in the food industry before, and never have I said such things in front of the customer, even if they did deserve it. So I would suggest not coming here unless you want terrible service."
Lynne P.,"Nob Hill, San Francisco, United States",0,52,2,1.0,14/8/2017,"Sad to leave this review for a place I normally love  but feel I must.  Summary of the service at the bar when anyone OTHER THAN BIANCA AND GABRIELLA are your servers is excellent.  If they are, expect them to totally ignore you while they chat to each other, give you the smallest pour on a glass of wine that you have EVER seen, never ask you if you meal is OK, eye rolling at a request to fill your water and just all around HORRIBLE service.  I am not alone in this review.  I have met several regular customers that refuse to even sit at the bar when they are working.  Complaints to management have done nothing.  And if you ever expect to hear a ""thank you"", don't hold your breath.  Very sad."
Kim P.,"Los Angeles, United States",8,51,185,1.0,13/8/2017,"DO NOT SEAT OUTSIDE!!! GROSS!!! I can't believe that I had lunch here, especially when I have a pigeon phobia LOL It was like a...""welcome to the pigeon world! ;D"" Haha I'm such a brave girl who went surfing without not knowing how to swim, but when it comes to pigeons....I am the biggest loser ever Lol Pigeons were everywhere. I know most people are not afraid of them so you probably wouldn't care... but guess what?! I know you all care about sanitation when you come to the restaurant, and let me be honest with you. There is literally NO way for Cheesecake Factory to keep this place clean. None of servers cared about it. These pigeons walked around to find foods, SAT ON THE TABLE even if there was no food (I saw them touching empty plates that was set for next customers), ATE LEFTOVERS(servers didn't take them away for so long), flew above your head & foods....etc. It was really, really gross. I strongly recommend you to sit inside if you want to enjoy your lunch/dinner. And what about foods? - fried mac and cheese : comes with 4 balls of fried mac and cheese. crispy enough and it wasn't too greasy or cheesy thanks to tomato sauce that came with. Pretty good. - avocado salad(?) : baaaaad....i could taste that avocado and greens were not fresh at all. Tortilla chips tasted weird too. I would never get this again, or at least not from this location. I left 70% of it. - chicken salad : I don't have a picture but this is what my moma got. She said chicken was too hard that she left all of them.  Overall, super baaaaad....! My sister got pepperoni pizza and popa got a burger and both of them looked okay. Not sure about taste as I didn't try."
Kira B.,"Daly City, United States",0,11,1,1.0,5/8/2017,"No no no. Nice view if you wanna come and just take a picture. Would be nice to seat and grab a drink or a cheese cake but that would take you 3 hours of waiting. The food is not good at all. My shrimp angel hair pasta was without pasta, 4 shrimps and just all the plate full of tomatoes. It was just not eatable."
Jess G.,"San Jose, United States",0,12,14,1.0,5/8/2017,"Came in today with my husband for a quick bite. We were seated in only 20 minutes which is by far the shortest time I have ever waited for a table at this location. Needless to say, we were super pleased! That's where the pleasant surprises ended. We were assigned to a waiter named Joshua G. He did not offer us bread, he did not offer us plates, he did not offer us drink refills. When my husband finally asked him for a refill, he returned with a warm soda bottle. Really? We decided we had enough and asked him for two boxes and the check. And he swats my husband's hand like a child and tells us ""not now I'm going to take another order!"" Horrible service. Joshua G, get an attitude adjustment or find another job."
Roberto V.,"Southwest Orlando, Orlando, United States",41,2,,1.0,31/7/2017,"Visiting the town and decided to go for something familiar. Bad Idea, the place is disorganized and waiting time is not what they tell you. I was given an hour and end up waiting for 1:30 minutes, just for the buzzer to go off and if you are familiar with with the restaurant you know you have to wait on the side for your name to be called. Got seated and thank got I didn't have to go Thur their menu, however the waitress took about another 10 to come to the table. 15 minutes and counting no bread and we where told it will be 2 minutes for it.  From the moment the buzzer went off till now it's been 45 minutes and no food or bread in site. The sad part it's that today is Monday.  So if you are considering it for the weekend good luck. Not the place to come and expect great service.  Totally disappointing experience"
Stephanie U.,"Porter Ranch, United States",44,3,,1.0,28/7/2017,"Bad service. Trash food. After being seated, we waited tremendously long for a waitress to ask what we want to drink/ eat. Wouldn't recommend to anyone , outrageous customer service , we waited for our food for an hour and after getting our food no one inquired if it was good or if we needed anything . The pasta was uneatable , wasn't fully cooked and it was clumpy it even stuck to my spoon . We questioned if it came out of the freezer. It appears two other couples had the same problem. Honestly for a high quality restaurant the food or service wasn't anything close to it . HA even McDonald's gives the type of food it promises. Bathrooms had no toilet paper and my stall had no lock. What a disappointment."
Angela P.,"Cerritos, United States",1,3,,1.0,17/7/2017,"I decided to visit this location because I wasn't able to find any other restaurant that was appealing. I went at about 12 P.M. and waited for 20 minutes to get seated. Everything was pretty good until we ordered and began waiting for our food to come out. It wasn't very busy at this time but the service was extremely slow and our waiter barely came to check up on us throughout our wait. It is extremely hard to get the waiters' attentions here. Our first entree came out 30 to 40 minutes after we ordered and because our second entree was nowhere to be seen, we asked the waiter about our dish and was told about ten minutes later (again slow service) that they had accidentally served our food to another table and that they would cook it again. The wait time was supposedly 10-15 minutes but it was far longer than this. We asked for another glass of lemonade and the check after we finished our meal and this also took a long amount of time. As I said before, the waiters do not come to check up on you very much so we needed to go up to the front desk ourselves and pay. Not only was the service itself bad, but they made a mistake in our check as well. One of the dishes that we had ordered was charged for twice instead of once. We had to ask for a manager but even then we had to wait for another 15 minutes to see them and wait for an 5 extra minutes for them to find the specific waiter that served us. Experiencing all of this, I am positive that I will never visit this location again."
Juana O.,"Oxnard, United States",4,9,12,1.0,7/7/2017,"I traveled from Ventura County to San Francisco for a family trip this past weekend. We decided to eat dinner at this location because I've been to this restaurant in different cities. I enjoyed the food as always and was quite impressed by how great the interior looked like. However, the service was rather terrible. There is no communication between the staff members. My family had waited for a table for about an hour, but was told to wait for another three hours. We in no way were going to stand there the entire four hours. There wasn't even any proper seating in the waiting area for anyone. I had to talk  to both managers in order for my family and I to be seated. The waiter had also messed my entree order up. The restrooms were also not sanitary. They had an awful stench of urine. I had expected my experience to be very well but was left disappointed. So disappointed that I in fact did not want to leave one star. I would have left no stars at all."
Bryce T.,"San Francisco, United States",1,11,,1.0,1/7/2017,"I called to place a pickup order for 2 pieces of cheesecake. The girl who answered said she would put me on a brief hold while she transferred me to someone who would take my order. After precisely 10 uninterrupted minutes of listening to hold music, I hung up. This isn't my first time feeling completely ignored by this business. I recommend going elsewhere."
Sheryl M.,"Danville, United States",110,374,55,1.0,25/6/2017,"Walked up to get a table for (3). There were (5) employees behind the counter and not one made eye contact or acknowledged our presence for at least (2) minutes. Even once we were acknowledged the lady was not very friendly. So, we were off to a rude start.  Once seated, it took about (5) minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink orders. Once that was done, it took another (5-10) minutes to actually get said drinks.  We finally ordered and we got a burger, veggie burger and flat bread. Nothing wow'd any of us.  The food and service are much to be desired. Bottom line is, due to the location, they clearly don't care about customer service because they don't have to.  The totality of this experience is one reason I don't eat at chain restaurants often."
Kat Z.,"Daly City, United States",15,36,21,1.0,22/6/2017,"Review is in regards to the horrible hostess that was working at the front desk checking customers in. As our table was getting ready and my phone went off indicating that my party needed to check in with the host at the front desk, I was greeted by a tiny Asian girl with an attitude that was disgusting. I proceeded to smile and as I was going to announce that I'm checking in for my table she cut me off and asked for a name. Surprisingly I told her my name and was rudely cut off by her giving me a side eye, followed by her rolling her eyes. In shock, I just stood there trying to figure out what happened and my boyfriend stepped in and firmly said ""Look, we're just here to check in. You guys said our table is ready."" With hesitation she replied ""I guess I can help you guys."" Never in my life have I experienced such horrible customer service! About 10 people came up to the front podium doing the same and they were NOT treated the same way I was. I'm beyond disgusted by her attitude and the way she handled the situation. If you work in customer service, be prepared to provide such. If not, work somewhere else. It's such a shame to have nasty employees taint such a good company."
Vina R.,"State College, United States",121,2,,1.0,7/6/2017,Extremely BAD service!!! I've been to other cheesecake factories and had a great experience but this one I would give a TOTALLY NEVER-go-to suggestion!!!
Chris G.,"Monterey, United States",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2017,There was a waiter under my table and I kicked him so many time till something was broken and the were finger nails in my pasta fuck u guys catch me at 1310 Louis way hella soft
