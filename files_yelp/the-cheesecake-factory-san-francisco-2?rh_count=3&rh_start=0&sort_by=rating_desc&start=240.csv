Adamma I.,"Oakland, United States",24,71,,5.0,31/10/2011,"I really really really appreciate the tastes, the ambiance,the huge quantities, the overwhelming variety, the rush of energy from all the people standing in line for an hour waiting their turn to experience the glory of the fabled CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Tip go to the Bar and hoover like a Vulture keeping an every watchful eye on the patrons. Even be as bold as the Raven/Crow and ask somebody, ""Hi are you almost done yet?"" For no wait time go after 9 definitely by 9:30pm its nearly empty. The Bar area also includes 3 0r 4 tables. This is how I receive faster seating. This Restaraunt is LOUD, fast paced, food and drinks come out slow, dishes are broken often, the dark bread is tasty, the view is AWESOME, the prices are like oooo that hurts so I am so glad it tasted good. The waiters I have had so far are quick to answer questions and take orders and it seem like it took 45 minutes for my food and drinks to come. Sorry I don't recall what I ate it was just good. The alcoholic Salty Caramel Millkshake($10) I drank had a dollop of Vodka, I mean I tasted the potency for 10 seconds then it was pure salty sweet yumness. My entree plus tax came up to $15 plus tip cost me $30 altogether. I go every six to 9 months cause of the price point which includes the admission to the city via BArt. I have eaten here 3 times."
Emma H.,"San Francisco, United States",214,425,202,5.0,17/10/2011,"I love me some Cheesecake factory. I always get the Renee's Special. ""Half a sandwich"" is really a whole sandwich- the chicken salad is bomb. The soup is always ridic. good and the salad is the healthy part :) this is a platter of food for $9 people. Skip the cheesecake in my opinion, overrated and over priced unless you go when it's piumpkin cheesecake season, in that case get like 20 whole cheesecakes."
T L.,"El Cajon, United States",7,58,,5.0,9/10/2011,"I had my birthday dinner here today and loved every minute of it! The service was a little slow but they were PACKED so I can't blame them too much. The view was amazing and luckily we got a seat right by the window outside.  The wait was around a little over an hour and they said it would be longer so we were pleasantly surprised by that. The food was delicious and the cheesecake was absolutely amazing! Love the avocado egg rolls and would highly recommend the four cheeses pasta! The hot chocolate is super rich and didn't finish it but not bad...  Overall, a great expereince."
Alex G.,"Hoboken, United States",387,129,7,5.0,28/9/2011,"It is always a great experience dining here. The food is always tasty and the service is seldom sub-par. I recommend the chicken parm sandwich; it is to die for.  Follow that off with a slice of the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, and you are surely in for a rich, tasty dinner."
Dawn D.,"Bellflower, United States",82,47,14,5.0,26/9/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory and what a wonderful location on the top floor of Macy's.  Service was wonderful. We had appetizers, drinks and of course dessert.  Wonderful time!"
George C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,21,6,5.0,24/9/2011,I LOVE THE CHICKEN DI PANA!!!!!!!!!!! Always go with my close friends it's wonderful :) and you dont have to go just for the cheesecake there are other great dishes
Alina R.,"San Francisco, United States",89,31,1,5.0,17/9/2011,"I went here for my birthday (today) with a few of my friends. It took 30min for us to be seated, and the place was pretty packed. I don't know how it's on other days, but it seems that Friday is quite a popular day for everyone to go places, especially here. So anyways, after we were seated at the patio (which is a really nice view), we ordered our drinks, and then we ordered the food. I tried the Factory Burger, which was pretty good, and my friends ordered the Mac and Cheese one. Since one of my friends mentioned to the waiter that it's my birthday, a few waiters came with a cheescake that said happy birthday. and it looked sooooooo pretty! They even sang happy birthday to me which was cool, but it felt awkward getting everyone else's attention. lol. But yea, the food is good, but it's a bit pricey. Even if it's pricey, it's still a must go place in the city!"
Monalisa M.,"Miami, United States",212,334,95,5.0,10/9/2011,Drink: Pina Colada Appie: Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Entree: Crispy Spicy Beef Dessert: Pumpkin Pumpkin Cheesecake You'll thank me later.
Emilia Z.,"San Francisco, United States",12,2,2,5.0,9/9/2011,"I just love this place. I enjoy there no matter with or without friends. Even eat alone, there is a perfect choice."
Blck R.,"Fremont, United States",13,124,363,5.0,8/9/2011,"Never mind what I had to eat. The service (my waiter) was the best that I had in months. Andrew was more than professional and more than courteous. Guys like this can make someones day; a good day.  Thanks Andrew, you rock! Five Trans-fats out of Five..."
Shirley M. J.,"Folsom, United States",178,1058,6484,5.0,6/9/2011,"Ok-I admit I am so very weak!  It's Labor Day 2011:  I broke down, resigning eating here again.  Oh, boy~the wait time was 40 minutes, but I waited downstairs in Macy's furniture department testing out the furniture-the chaise lounge chairs, the dining room chairs, beds like Goldilocks without the blonde hair and sans the Three Bears . . . Anyway, I arrived at my outdoor table-windy, but nice-there are propane heaters to my right and overhead.  The breathtaking views from my table are essential supplying a San Francisco-esque added ambiance. Dinner:  Beet/Arugula petite salad, Ahi Tuna appetizer, Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi, Baron De Rothschild Cabernet Sauvignon Wine, Espresso Cafe, H2O, Chocolate Truffle Cake and the standard complementary warmed breads completed my dinner very well. Oooh~I ate too much!  Burp!"
Robyn G.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,42,,5.0,25/8/2011,I have tried both the white chocolate & vanilla cheesecakes. Bother were delicious however I would definitely go back for the vanilla!
Susan C.,"Toronto, Canada",6,190,,5.0,7/8/2011,"My favourite restaurant in America! Of course, my San Fran trip would not been complete without going to The Cheesecake Factory.  I came on Forth of July and it was crazy. But, I was told the 45 minute for a table for 3 was the norm for this location. We had two waiter, since our original one went on break and we got a new one, but both were extremely nice and gives a good recommendation on which pasta plates are amazing. The food portion is huge and filling. I should have just shared my plate with my cousin, but I didn't believe her on how big the plates are. It was so tasty, but since it was so filling, I was upset we couldn't fit in dessert.  I will def. return to any Cheesecake Factory and make sure I save some room for a cheesecake! :D"
Mike W.,"Washington, DC, United States",37,481,8,5.0,30/6/2011,"I hate admitting that I love this chain restaurant, but I do.  Cheesecake factory, Union Square is very reasonable with a to die for view from their roof top terrace."
Savier M.,"Oakland, United States",82,141,34,5.0,29/6/2011,"How in the world do we allow for companies to serve us this trash. Our bodies are nature-made temples that deserve the best this world has to offer. Carcinogenic buffers are not a necessary component of good food. But DAMN are they good. I have fallen prey to the deep-fried macaroni and cheese balls many times but when I went to the San Francisco location, me and fam set it off right with the appetizer platter. Impending heart attacks were nigh because there was a enough salt to kill a baby. Next, I moved onwards to the Miso Salmon entree. Normally fish on top of rice or potatoes is a perfectly healthy dish but not tonight. My salmon was a greasy, wet mother****er with fake flavorings. I gulped this down quicker than a shot of Captain Morgan and I have no shame. Speaking of shame, did I mention the Tiramisu. It is a bonafide killer and you would do best to share this with a friend or two. I tried to eat it by myself and I am now writing this from Cheesecake Factory Heaven. I lied. I am alive and healthy but not due to this delicious place."
stevewynn R.,"Washington, DC, United States",0,3,,5.0,23/6/2011,"As good as it gets in San Fran. If your looking for good food with a wide selection to please a big group or family and VERY flexible opening times for both lunch and dinner (as its non stop service) then this is your place. If you are also a fan of Cheesecakes, then perfect. The menu can be overwhelming. I personnaly love the factory nachos and wings. The burgers and sandwiches they have are perfect and pastas, chicken dishes very tasty. For dessert try the vanilla bean cheesecake if your a vanilla lover. its just amazing! Great service...only but is waiting time to get a table which can be over 20min on rush hour (between 7.30 and 9PM)"
Julia S.,"Honolulu, United States",25,142,118,5.0,22/6/2011,"Ahhhh! I love this location so very much!  I'm used to the scene of cramming 2 people in a 1 sq ft space multiplied by an entire restaurant.  It is truly great on a crisp, fall night - keeping warm with drinks and outdoor heaters while overlooking the partial city view.  Being stuck inside is *Meh, looks like a chain restaurant* feeling.  If I'm staying a few days in SF, I definitely take my friends to this location who've never been before.  If my friend is a local, then no way; we will eat like a local and go elsewhere."
Chris S.,"San Francisco, United States",240,102,9,5.0,20/6/2011,"Huge portions, lots of selection of dishes, reasonable price, stiff drinks, quality food and a kitchen that is open until 12- what is there not too love? I am sure that some of the other review here (didn't read them yet) talk about the crowd.   There are no reservations (for parties of 8 or more maybe they do?) so the wait can get bad.  I tend to go there for late eats (after 10PM) which there is never an issue.  Also, I eat at the bar area (where there are small table tops too) so I really have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.  Never had the cheesecake there I must admit - not my thing but I understand the red velvet is to die for. Average bill is under $25 with cocktails so I definitely give this a strong recommend."
J V.,"San Mateo, United States",5,77,44,5.0,7/6/2011,"Their cheesecake is so delish!! I love it!! My favorite is the vanilla bean cheesecake, its simple just the way I like it, not too sweet, creamy & cool. Mmmmm... Their key lime is also a must try. If you like sweet cheesecake i reccomend the dulce de leche cheesecake or the chocolate coconut cheesecake.. just try them all!! Their food portions are big & the house bread they serve is great!!"
chloe b.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,5.0,13/5/2011,"starting with the front desk, i really felt welcome when stepping off of the overly crowded elevator. i can only imagine the amount of people that go through a day. the hour QUOTE TIME we were given seemed reasonable. if you're patient enough to wait it's nice because you can stroll around the area and come back when your table is ready. there have been a few occasions when we had to wait an extra couple minutes, but that's more than understandable. the server i had last week was very attentive and made sure everything was taken care of. she refilled the bread for us after my friend would devour it every ten minutes. i couldn't decide upon what i wanted at first (i mean the menu is literally a book), however she helped me sift through, finally deciding on the chicken madera. it turned out to be perfect, exactly what i had hoped for. after my friend and i finished we certainly didn't have any space left when offered cheesecake. it may not always be perfect, but the five stars is for how welcoming the staff was. this place is always worth coming to."
