Becky U.,"Concord, United States",193,367,236,5.0,11/5/2011,"Where else can you go to enjoy company with a good drink, good food and great view of Union Square, SF.  Been here plenty of times for all kinds of occassions.  The downfall is the wait! But if you are with great company, time flies."
Arthur S.,"South San Francisco, United States",0,27,,5.0,10/5/2011,"despite the long wait, the food is amazing and the menu has everything you can possibly imagine. there is something for everyone!!"
Steve C.,"Manhattan, United States",4,260,2,5.0,25/4/2011,"What can I say? I'm a sucker for the cheesecake factory. The waits are ridiculous, but what are you gonna do? I like the chicken madeira. I order it every time. I always make a point to order gin martinis here, because they pour like 3 shots of gin into it (count for around 8 seconds). Note: one time they charged me only $9 for a hendrick's martini. I thought I was in heaven. Turns out the guy rang me up wrong. The most recent time I was there I noticed the bill was like $14 for a Hendrick's martini."
Bennett W.,"San Francisco, United States",643,958,2243,5.0,27/3/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is the best especially since this one is at the top level of Macy's Union Square. I agree with Ernest that the food there maybe a bit pricey. But it's still worth it and I give them 6 stars for the cheesecakes! The staff here are very friendly and customer service is efficient but it can be better. I am craving for a cheesecake as I edit this review! This restaurant is always busy so there will be a wait when you come here. It is popular and tops the list of busy restaurant at the same time. There is patio dining available. I'll come here again if I am at the Union Square Macy's location!
Prashanth R.,"Sterling Heights, United States",49,117,12,5.0,15/3/2011,"1112 reviews and it still has only 3 stars.. hmmm. I would like to disagree and give it 5 stars.  I think the shortcoming about the this place is the wait time but don't try to go to a romantic spot if you are in a group of more than three people. It's definitely going to take longer for you to find a place to sit. Especially in the terrace.  The two times I've been here, it was only two of us and the wait time was reasonable. fifteen to twenty five minutes. But you won't feel that time go by when you are with someone you enjoy your time with. Right!!?  Anyway, the choices are plenty. If you are a vegetarian then it's a little hard but you can still manage. The food came in on time. The view was awesome and the setting was great.  I would definitely go here again."
Paula H.,"San Diego, United States",64,361,149,5.0,14/3/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake factory. But this location is exceptional. It was Christmas and we sat outside on the huge deck overlooking the ice skaters in Union Square.
Ringo M.,"San Francisco, United States",556,309,918,5.0,6/3/2011,"Nothing beats the cheesecake factory. For me growing up, cheesecake factory was the restaurant you only go to if there is a special occasion. I would always look forward to the free bread, the fruit smoothie, and some delicious fried stuff. Even after being to many more 'creative' and 'fancier' restaurants now in my old age, none of them would ever bring me that pure joy feeling that I get when i arrive at 8th floor macy's andseeing the huge 'The Cheesecake Factory' block letters by the busy reception desk. We chose to eat outside on a cold day, and while the view was cool, it also makes your food cold 10 times faster, so don't eat outside if you're a slow eater. We decided to go with 4 appetizers and share 1 entree so we'll have enough room for the cheesecake. And even though we told ourselves we won't eat the bread this time so we can finish our food, we ended up eating the bread anyways : ) BUENO! Fried Artichoke Hearts I don't even know how the artichoke tastes like honesty, but its fried really well, and it comes with a garlic-ish dipping sauce. automatic plus in my book. Spicy Chipotle Pasta We subbed the Angel Hair in for the Penne because I like to slurp my food haha. I didn't eat much of it, but it was good. It was not too spicy, but spicy enough and the thing that put it over the top was that it had this crunchy thing on top that gave the whole dish a nice crunch! Avocado Eggrolls This is our favorite. I think just having this dish on our table brings back happy times. Basically, its just fried eggroll with avocado and guacamole stuffed inside. You put some delicious green sauce on it and add some of that white crunchy thing, and then it just brings a smile on your face. No Bueno Peach Smoothie I didn't know smoothie does this, but after a while, it kinda tasted watered-down or diluted or whatever. AND it wasn't hella good to begin with either Chicken Samosa It was just another fried thing but with curry stuff stuffed inside. Meh, Fried Calamari I think the calamari didn't give enough of a texture substance. It just tasted like fried stuff with cocktail sauce, which is actually pretty good, but i would rather have my calamari more chewy. I know this generous 5 star rating is more a personal sentiment rating than an actual rating, but i really like the cheesecake factory. I have a good time everytime i come here and that's what its all about right? Sure, the service isn't always there, the wait is crazy, the food aren't mind-blowing and the cheesecake probably isn't worth 8 bucks either, but the cheesecake factory will always have a special place in my heart. and in my tummy too : )"
Cristina T.,"Daly City, United States",34,9,,5.0,6/2/2011,"I love their pasta, drinks and desserts and the al fresco dining is wonderful!"
John W.,"Daly City, United States",51,25,,5.0,25/1/2011,"This is my favorite place when I feel like American food. The portions are really worth it. I love their Shrimp pasta and the the combo dinner with choice of 2 with either shrimp, steak, chicken, salmon. My favorite cake is the red velvet cake. Hate the wait though."
Victoria L.,"San Francisco, United States",759,70,1,5.0,20/1/2011,"Love LOVe LOve Cheesecake Factory forever! Even if the wait can be long, even if the server wasn't always there watching us, even if it's crowded, even if somethings are kinda expensive.... I love how beautiful the place is and the cheesecake is always delicious! The salad dressings are the bomb. The bread is good- warm soft crunchy. I ordered from the snack part of the menu that i never seen before which was perfect for the evening after a day of shopping! A little house salad that was not ""small"" but just the perfect amount and a margherita pizzette which was delicious as well. The meal only costed me less than ten dollars and I had leftovers as well!  I didn't get a chance to get the cheesecake tonight but I love the red velvet the most!  This place looks formal but is really a place i can eat at everyvnight. There is a big menu that I can live off of! Bring your date, your friends, and your family!"
Brittany K.,"Edmonton, Canada",811,550,236,5.0,14/1/2011,"My last day in SF before flying home to snowy Edmonton = my last chance to eat outdoors in the sort-of sunshine to celebrate my birthday! I just snuck in and out of the actual restaurant, ordering a Reese Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Try saying that one five times fast! The decor in this place is pretty amazing, and I hope I have more time to eat in next time I'm in the area. But it was a treat simply to sneak a peek into this infamously busy dessert heaven. My slice was ready to go in a flash and topped off with whipped cream on the side. (Not being a fan of whipped cream, this was awesome. I simply hate when the cream is added right on top without my asking!) I took my cake to the square out front of Macy's and dug in. Chocolate cake inside of peanut butter cheesecake? I could have died. And in fact, I almost did when I couldn't even finish the damn thing. There's only two things I really love unconditionally love in life: Reese Peanut Butter, and cheesecake. Not to finish an amazing combo of the two is a sure sign of the richness and size of my piece. I am counting down the days until I can come back and defeat that cheesecake!"
Andrea B.,"Richmond, United States",133,164,6,5.0,6/1/2011,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  1.  I love all of your different locations. 2.  I love your menu.  3.  I love how your portions are so big.  You, my friend, are contributing to the rise of obesity in this country and I love you for that.  4.  I love your jumbalaya.  5.  I love your strawberry lemonade.  6.  I love your strawberry lemonade.  7.  I love your strawberry lemonade.  8.  I love how I never have to wait long for my service or food.  9.  I love your strawberry shortcake.  10.  I LOVE YOUR HONEY BREAD, DAMNIT!  11.  I love how I wanted you to cater my wedding.  12.  I love YOU!"
Rickey B.,"Merced, United States",3,38,5,5.0,2/12/2010,My favorite cheesecake factory of the few I have been too.. love the downtown union square view from the 8th floor.. for some reason I always end up drinking a long island while sitting on the roof.. it never let's me down.. food is always on point I order something different every time just to see if I will be satisfied and I am.. nice place for a first date but it does get crowded and cold during the night time.
K H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,23,,5.0,30/11/2010,"As its name ""hints"", this place is cheesecake heaven. If you're gluttonous about your cheesecake like I am, I recommend the cookie dough cheesecake. Everything I've gotten from here has been smeared in delicious sauces and they have the most divine portabella burger I've ever had. What's also great about dining here is dining outside on the top floor of Macy's, enjoying a glorious view of Union Square."
Mel P.,"San Francisco, United States",288,831,,5.0,23/11/2010,The Banana Cream Cheesecake. HELL YES! You must eat it. Delicious. Drool...
Karen L.,"Seattle, United States",297,904,341,5.0,8/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, but it is definitely one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Every Cheesecake Factory I go to, the food is always superb! I only order the pastas because I don't think the other stuff is worth ordering. I love the pastas here!! The last time I came here, I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta and it was SO GOOD. My friend ordered a salad and it was huge! The portions of their pastas are also really big! I can never finish the entire thing by myself. The service was great, and the view is great too! The restaurant is above the Macy's so you get a great view of Union Square. We sat outside, even though it was a bit chilly, but they have those heater lamps, so it wasn't so bad."
Dawn R.,"Culpeper, United States",78,419,883,5.0,24/10/2010,"Our server was amazing! Yes there was a long wait, but it was beyond worth it! We really wanted to sit on the patio overlooking Union Square, but it was raining so we weren't able to. I wasn't too impressed with their cocktails, but the food more than made up for it. We started off with Buffalo Blasts...amazing! They're like shredded buffalo chicken lightly fried with dipping sauces. I highly recommend it. For entrees, I got the bang bang chicken & shrimp - delicious!! It's got a Thai feel to it but isn't too spicy. The toasted coconut equals it out. It comes over white rice & I couldn't recommend it more. For dessert (to go!) I got the Chocolate Tuxedo cheesecake - yummy! Not too rich but sooo delicious! My husband got the Red Velvet cheesecake & couldn't stop talking about it. If we're ever back in San Fran, we'll definitely hot this place up again & hopefully get to sit outside this time!"
Karen M.,"Oakland, United States",98,644,488,5.0,5/10/2010,"Likes: good food each time I've eaten here, love the cheesecakes and variety. Dislikes: the long LONG wait!"
linda L.,"San Francisco, United States",231,195,128,5.0,16/9/2010,"This review is only for my take out RED VELVET CHEESE CAKE! yeah, you heard right, i SAID Red Velvet Cheese Cake and it's to die for! For the past few weeks, my girlfriend Christine have been raving about HOW good their red velvet was! OMG had it last night and she is TOTALLY right!  I pre-ordered a 10 inch RVCC to go $56 (not bad right?)... it didnt look that yummy, but boy it looks better than it tastes! The frosting wasnt too sweet, and their cheesecake wasnt over powering at all... in my opinion, it's a perfect balance *heaven* will be back for more :) Oh it's the best red velvet in town! Forget TTTC red velvets, Cheese Cake Factory it is! :)"
Brandon L.,"Spring Hill, United States",41,165,127,5.0,6/9/2010,Plain and simple. I LOVE eating on the top floor of the Macy's building overlooking union square! The food here is amazing! It tastes ten times better when your sitting outside on a clear day looking at the beautiful city! Thank God for San Francisco!
