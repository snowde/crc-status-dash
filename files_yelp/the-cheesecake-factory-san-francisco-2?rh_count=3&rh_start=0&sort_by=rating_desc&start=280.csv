EmmettsGuRL C.,"Daly City, United States",112,103,494,5.0,28/8/2010,Love the view. Love the salmon. Love the key lime cheesecake. Love the cocktails. Been meaning to try the tiramisu. But expect to wait...... a long time
Betty T.,"New York, United States",4,30,,5.0,16/8/2010,"I wanted Mexican food.  In the Mission.  Soooooooo not happening on my SF trip with kids in tow.  Soooo not into chain restaurants.  I absolutely wanted to hate this place but it actually turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip.  So, instead of Mexican in the Mission that I wanted we went to the Cheesecake Factory, that seems logical, right? So it's in Macy's on the 8th floor and there's outdoor seating! So cool.  Great view of Union Square.  The day we decided to go there was a band (Moonalice) playing in the square- so even though we had to wait 15 minutes for a table we had an amazing view of Union Square and listening to some tunes.   This place has everything but the kitchen sink on it's menu, so I thought I was at least going to make an attempt to squelch my Mexican food craving (yay!).  Had some wine actually called Cheesecake Factory (which was very good, btw).  We ordered some spicy quacamole to start.  We were hungry (we had just spend the day at the California Academy of Sciences) so it seemed like the guac was taking a long time.  We asked our waitress, Katherine (who was also one of our better servers during our two weeks of eating out and eating badly) ""what gives?"" and she said that ""the guac is made to order"", I guess they were busy toiling away to make it spicy and it would be out in a moment.  It finally arrived and it was super delish! Nice and spicy and fresh! Give me lots of yummy guac and you make me a very happy woman!  The guac and chips also came with some very yummy sour cream and salsa!  So, in keeping with the Mexican theme, I also ordered some chicken tacos.  This was pretty good too! Oh joy! The chicken left a little something to be desired in the way of texture- I believed it was in cubed chunks which were kinda on the chewy side, but was definitely ok...the sides of beans and rice were really yummy.  Looking at some of the other plates it's kind of overwhelming the way they serve their food and the portions are humongous.  You could probably order a pasta dish here and eat lunch for at least a couple of days.  I'm not into big portions and left quite a bit of my meal behind. I was very pleasantly surprised by this place.  As I mentioned before I'm not really into chains like this, but we had a great time!  We also made a friend! We were stalked by a seagull outside the plexiglass sort of pretend window (we were outdoors), I guess it was some sort of seagull barrier.  My mom (she had the chicken medeira, which she thoroughly enjoyed and ate most of, I won't even mention what my kids ate) decided to give the seagull some French fries and almost had her fingers nipped off!  My kids named the seagull Frenchie, who from then on stalked us for the rest of the meal.  He glared at us from his perch outside the plexiglass and looked longingly at our plates.  I almost thought he might fly over and join our party.  We offered Frenchie wine through the plexiglass, but only French fries seemed to do.  Frenchie rejected sourdough bread!  We had a photo shoot with Frenchie and then we bid adieu avowing to return the next day for lunch prior to returning to New York, alas it was not to be- all that fun caused us to be very weary the next morning and we just made our check out deadline by the skin of our teeth.  Oh yeah, the cheesecake is good too. : )"
Sophie g.,"Richmond, United States",256,20,10,5.0,26/7/2010,But why not.? i love the red velvet cheese cake! had a wonderful dinner i ordered the ribs...

Norm G.,"Antioch, United States",32,23,,5.0,25/7/2010,"Located on the 8th floor of Macy*s women store in Union Square. You are greeted at the main entrance which you are greeted by a worker and one elevator which is a con because it is always packed.       After reaching the 8th floor you are greeted by nicely decorated restaurant with warm decor. Me and my party was greeted by a very courteous staff at the front desk who told us that our wait would be a hour. While we waited very good selection of music was played and the bar was packed'     After waiting less than a hour we where seated and greeted buy a great Waiter and servers who answers and  fulfilled  any questions or task asked. The menu Selection.. In one word seem endless option's and such wide selection of food from hamburgers to orange chicken.    Last but not least just a huge variety of cheesecakes and other deserts but why get another type of desert? This is the Cheesecake factory from Kahlua cheesecake from the best to me which is Red Velvet Cheesecake. In the end prices are mid level but you get a huge selection of  food, a excellent view of the city and much more."
Chris W.,"San Francisco, United States",12,35,1,5.0,24/7/2010,"Torn between a 4 and a 5.   We had a toddler at our table and was very impressed that as soon as we sat down, they brought out a plate w/ tiny slices of bread and bananas.  It's already a really big hassle to fight the crowds there w/ a stroller and to deal w/ dining out w/ a baby.  It was a very nice touch of them to have that small plate ready for us.   The food was good for a chain.  I think the portions are too big and it is a challenge to finish everything on your plate.   I'm surprised to find that their baby high chair was in good shape as opposed to all of the broken ones at the newly opened Burger Bar."
Sujin H.,"Burbank, United States",184,58,4,5.0,24/7/2010,"Mmmmm, no matter where I am, LA or SF, Cheesecake Factory never fails me.  I went for my friend's birthday (party of 8) and although we had to wait for a long time (was expected) we got seated by a nice waiter. Some portions were family-style whereas others were not, but we shared everything nonetheless.  Ughh, simply amazingg. We ordered so many dishes (sorry, forgot which ones) and had 4 slices of cheesecake for dessert, 2 ppl sharing 1 slice. I don't think anyone finished their slice (they're pretty big) not because it was gross, but because we were full from our meal. What can I say? Their cheesecakes are hands down the best. Next time, I think I'm going to order the cheesecake first so I can finish it! This place is great for anything- dating, catching up, casual dinner, birthdays, etc. Love Cheesecake Factory!"
Lovi K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,45,,5.0,1/7/2010,"Tiramisu cheescake are the first words in my mind! You have to try it tiramisu+cheesecake= awesome. I've ate here a lot of times and have never been disappointed with any new thing i try expect for just this one time i ordered thai noodles and it was like a plate with noodles and peanut butter, but the rest of the time i had chicken bugers pasta, everything was delicous, service is really nice, friendly waiters, who actually communicate with you . There is a minium of like 30 minutes waiting whenever i go though, but parking is across the street."
Nicole G.,"Stockton, United States",3,51,27,5.0,10/5/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is an old faithful.  Any one I go to is usually consistent and I do love the pulled pork sandwich and fried mac and cheese.  This CF garners up 5 stars for their outside seating which gives you the best view of Union Square since the restaurant sits on top of the Macy's building.  They really shouldn't offer outside seating though on cold, windy days.  Their heaters are not adequate enough for you to fully enjoy your dinner because your jaw is too busy shivering instead of chewing."
Ivan F.,"San Francisco, United States",38,98,6,5.0,8/4/2010,"After eating somewhere regulary, especially if it's a chain, I somewhat forget to review my experience. The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places. I ate there this week to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend. Couple things about this particular site is that it's centralized in the heart of San Francisco. A ""tourist trap"", if you will. Now, I'd have to disagree about the ""trap"" part because locals frequent this spot just as much as visiting tourists do. Everytime I eat at the The Cheesecake Factory I usually order one of 2 things. Either the Chcken Madeira (which comes with some bombass mashed potatoes) or the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms and some bowtie pasta served just the perfect way, between al dente and done. This time around, I had the Marsala and my homegirl tried the Madeira (my recommendation). She loved it and since my dish looked good, she picked at my plate, tried it and loved it! Since the joint is known for it's namesake, we made sure to make room for what else? Cheesecake. I ain't gonna front, the cheesecake that makes my tummy happier than anything is the dulce de leche. Can't go wrong. The waiter tried to entice me with the red velvet cheesecake so my homegirl had that and decided to pick at mine, again. Of course I didn't mind because it was her birthday. A couple things about this joint: I really dig the fact that they're open as late as 11pm on weekdays and 12:30a on weekends and there's always alot of people.  Oh and by the way, I suggest you sit outside and enjoy the ambience...especially on a nice day."
Sean O.,"Daly City, United States",63,183,58,5.0,7/4/2010,"I don't think anyone really needs a review on The Cheesecake Factory.  It is what it is.  For what it is, though, it's pretty outstanding.  The menu is extensive and is certain to have something for everyone and everything is tasty, too.  The crowds can be super annoying, but we went at 10:30, put our name in then did some shopping.  We were seated promptly at 11 am.  This seems to be the way to go if you have a hankering for cheesecake. If found the service there to be excellent.  Everyone was really nice.  I really don't see anything wrong with liking a chain restaurant or admitting the food is good."
Brenda C.,"Fullerton, United States",691,260,15,5.0,17/3/2010,"This review is STRICTLY for their side dish of MAC & CHEESE. I've been here numerous times and I've usually stuck with the same stuff (grilled salom, garlic pasta, or chicken & biscuits). However, I wasn't very fond of the mash potatos so I requested a substitution. The server started naming side dishes "" blah blah blah MAC & CHEESE. bllll""  ""WAITTTT  .. did you just say mac & cheese. SOLD"" let me describe it to you, as I start drooling. MAC & SUPER EXTRA CHEESE baked to perfection topped off  with a dash of bread crumbs. As you dig into the melty dish, strings of cheese will cling onto your fork. The warm heavy cheese will melt in your mouth and bring you to Nirvana.  I'm not even lying. PS - Also, try their red velvet cheesecake. Absolutely EFFIN' delicious. Howeverrr,  one slice is 1500 + calories =[   .. BUT HECK .. its called ""CHEESE""CAKE FACTORY for a reason! Eat on!"
Ali H.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,15,,5.0,9/3/2010,"If you go here there is only one thing to order... HIBACHI STEAK If you get any other meal and are not completley satisfied I have 4 words for you... I told you so We went to SF and ate here for dinner and had an exquisit Hibachi steak meal. We saw that the next table order some delicious looking pasta so decided to come back for lunch in a couple of days. Two days later we ordered the ""lunch size"" (it was enough to feed a small family!) fettuccine  chicken with sun dried tomatoes and the lunch size bbq chicken avocado salad which I decided to order after walking past a table that had ordered it. I have 4 words for myself...I told you so...why mess with a good thing?? Both the pasta and salad looked WAY better than it actually tasted. I could have had heaven in my mouth and ordered the hibachi steak again but noooooo, we decided to try something new...don't do it I tell you!! Just stick with the steak!!! You can thank me later. Your welcome!"
Brianne G.,"Pinole, United States",2,48,,5.0,13/2/2010,"Cheesecake Factory on Union Square..oh how I love thee. My husband has brought me hear a few times, plus Ive been a couple times with co-workers and family. Yes the wait can get rather irritating or what not but once you are seated, you'll probably drool all over the novel sized menu. The food is always absolutely delishuuuuzzz. Yes the portions are huge, but you know what? Id rather pay $$ money for huge servings of wonderful food, than $$$$$ money for a teeny serving of wonderful food...you dig? Even the food presentation is excellent :)  See you tomorrow Mr. C Factory, you didn't think I could pass up Valentines Day without paying a visit did you?? come on now."
Michelle N.,"San Francisco, United States",219,271,460,5.0,27/1/2010,"Note:  this review is for cheesecake take-out only. I was very pleased with today's experience at Cheesecake Factory.  Earlier in the week, I placed an order for the small red velvet cheesecake to bring to a friend's farewell party.  I come in to pick up the cake this afternoon and was told that they did not have any of the small size available, but if I wanted I could get the large size for the price of the small.  I was asked if that size would be too big, I could get  1/2 of a large size.  I told the manager that 1/2 of a cake wouldn't do because it would be poor presentation at the party I would be attending.  So, I opt for the full large cake.   Great customer service!  The cashier was also super friendly....enjoyed our brief chat while I waited for my cake to be boxed."
Stephanie K.,"Oakley, United States",8,14,5,5.0,24/1/2010,"My husband took me here for lunch on my birthday. Surprisingly, I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before, even though I have lived in San Francisco all of my life. We went there right when it opened, at 11am, so we were seated right away. The hostess tried to seat us at a table, but I asked if we could sit at a booth so we could have a view, and she let us.  DRINKS: I got the strawberry lemonade and hubby got the raspberry lemonade. The strawberry was wonderful, but also VERY sweet, so you have to like that sort of the thing. The raspberry was less sweet, but in our opinion, not as good, so when we got refills, hubby changed his order for the strawberry. The glass also comes with a sugar rim. APPETIZER: We got the crabcakes. So yummy! It comes with 3 small sized crab cakes and it's served with a tartar sauce and a mustard dipping sauce, which were both tastey. You also get the complimentary bread at the table. I think it was brown bread and french bread, and it is served with room temperature butter. Both were good. ENTREES: Hubby got the filet mignon, which was a great portion, tender, very juicy, and had great flavor. The menu says it comes with french fries and onion rings, but it was mostly french fries and only two onion rings. The onion rings were okay, and the french fries were really good. I got the bistro pasta which was AWESOME! It is spaghetti pasta with crispy, battered shrimp, arugala, mushrooms, and tomatoes in a rich cream sauce. Then they top it off with freshly grated parmesan cheese to your liking. Ohhhh... my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I gave hubby some of my dish, and he said he was jealous and wished he ordered the same thing. We definately found a new favorite! DESSERT: We were picking up my birthday cake to have with a bunch of family later that evening. The 7 inch cheesecake wasn't going to be big enough for everyone we were having over, so we considered getting the 10 inch. When we dicovered that the price of the 10 inch was pretty much double the price of the 7 inch, for (HELLO!) only 3 extra inches, we opted to get two 7 inches instead. That way we could try two different kinds and get way more for the price. We got the Godiva chocolate and the Snickers cheesecakes. Both were delicious, but I am such a chocoholic, I thought the Godiva was just divine, and definately better! Our waiter was very nice too, and was very patient when hubby and I were taking forever to decide which cheesecakes we were getting. The only down side is that when we decided, he took forever to bring them out to us so we could go. It was worth it for the great experience we had!"
Vika H.,"Oakland, United States",27,58,70,5.0,19/1/2010,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory. I been to the Pleasanton, Walnut Creek, and this one in Frisco. I like the one in Walnut Creek because it's not too crouded as the other two. The one in Pleasanton seemed too little like a tight space when you're sitting at a regular table for 2-4 people, it's also the smallest I've ever been too. The one entree I ALWAYs order is the chicken madeira. My all time favorite here. The miso salmon is also good. Their appetizers are also good. Can't remember the names but their were a few that's delicious. As for the cheesecakes, I never had anything other than the strawberry one. Don't want to try the others. I'm good with just the strawberry cheesecake. Ummm ummm good.  I also been to one in Utah and Arizona and what do I always order, Chicken Madeira. That's all."
Dominic T.,"San Francisco, United States",499,344,375,5.0,12/1/2010,"I ate here countless times over the winter break and even before then. The wait is disgusting but you just have to go at the right time and also find things to do within that wait time. That shouldn't be a problem though, considering Macy*s is right below you and there is a Starbucks a few floors down.  I've had a number of birthday gatherings here too. If you go for lunch, have everyone arrive promptly and plan ahead. No reservations, so don't try calling ahead. They'll just tell you to come down and pick up a pager like everyone else and wait your turn. Foodwise, the portions are gargantuan! When ordering, please save room for cheesecake, if that is your intention for coming to the establishment. Lunch portions are also above average. A wide range of appetizers are available and seasonal lunch specials (more like snacks) are also on a separate insert or sometimes on the table. If you hate waiting for food, have no fear. The bread is to die for! For most people I know, they love the ""brown bread""/whole wheat bread. It's delicious and has a touch of sweetness that hits the right notes in your mouth. The sourdough is also noteworthy but a bit on the rigid side, typical though.  I used to always get the farfalle with chicken pasta but I got tired of it. I still stick with the pastas though since I can't go wrong with them. When in doubt, order a salad or pasta.  Burgers are more than a handful and mouthful! I remember the day I got my braces, I came straight to The Cheesecake Factory to eat with my grandma. Just biting down on the bun hurt like a mother!  My favorite cheesecake is Stephanie's ultimate red velvet. It's extremely high in calories, sugars, and oils but if that doesn't matter to you, try it! I've also had the key lime cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake (delicious!), and others.  There are occasional promotions throughout the year and I've took advantage of several of them. Most recently was the ""every $30 spent = 1 slice of free cheesecake"". Another was national cheesecake day. And plenty others. I'm glad that those happen because it's not a cheap place to dine. Just the frozen iced mango I get every time amounts to $5 or so and it's the same volume as a Power size at Jamba Juice. I don't think reviews can do the place justice. Everyone has his/her own experience at the Factory."
Louisa L.,"Manhattan, United States",210,295,2,5.0,23/12/2009,"I don't care what other people say, about how it's totally over-rated...but I have to say that THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE RESTAURANT!  The prices are very decent, and they give you huuuge portions. So even if something is relatively pricey, u definitely get ur money's worth. Some of my favorite foods: +AVOCADO ROLLS: soooooooooo delicious, i order them EVERY time I come. I think it's the sauce that makes it taste so good, but I LOVE IT! +Spicy chicken chipotle pasta: i get this pretty much every time too. I'm a fan of spicy food, so I absolutely love this too! +CHEESECAKE CHEESECAKE and more CHEESECAKE! all are very delicious, but my favorites are probably the tuxedo, tirimisu, dulche de leche, white chocolate macademia nut, and new favorite red velvet cheesecake =P I come here whenever I want to celebrate something, or when I'm just happy. The wait IS very long....which is the downfall to this restaurant, but I like the union square cheesecake factory cuz the outside patio area is actually pretty nice if it's a warm night out =) u get a nice view of the square too."
Chrissy A.,"San Francisco, United States",14,83,,5.0,23/11/2009,"I love the Cheesecake factory! I am obsessed with their menu, and their bread and butter! Hugeass portions! I never get something I don't like when I am here!"
Lerka J.,"San Francisco, United States",6,56,8,5.0,4/11/2009,"LOVE IT!  Huge portions!!!!  Awesome view!!!!!  I always take Thai Lettuce wraps...they are delicious and healthier than anything else..so I eat them all guilty free lol  Love their complimentary bread (dark one!)  ps Don't even feed the seagull outside, because it won't go away!)"
