Mel T.,"San Francisco, United States",180,310,818,5.0,11/10/2009,"Ok, really, this review is biased because now when I think of Cheesecake Factory, all I can think of is the new addition to its cheesecake menu - Red Velvet Cheesecake.  I wonder if that thing is baked with crack because seriously, that cheesecake is DELICIOUS.  Not too cheesey, not too heavy, and not too sweet, it really is THE best cheesecake I've tasted..in my life...ever.  I know I have a problem - I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that today was my THIRD DAY IN A ROW of heading downtown just to order that slice of heaven (was talking to the counter guy yesterday, who said they're under contract to offer the Red Velvet Cheesecake for at least a year), but it is so worth it (I feel like Rachel and Chandler on Friends.  Anyone else catch that episode?). If I had to rate Cheesecake Factory itself (you know, minus the miraculous Red Velvet Cheesecake), I'd give it...a 3.5.  The wait, particularly at this location, is always outrageous, the food is so-so, and the service is hit or miss (on this past Thursday's visit, Danae was awesome - ask for her!!).  Apparently consistency is not key at this place.  To save yourself from all this, just order the Red Velvet Cheesecake to go.  You won't be disappointed!! P.S.  Twenty-five cents from each slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake sold is donated to Feeding America. P.P.S.  A serving size of Red Velvet Cheesecake is, um, 1500 calories (holy hell).  Deathly, albeit still worth every bite.  *sigh*  Guess who'll be hitting up the gym come Monday?"
Betty C.,"San Francisco, United States",373,695,189,5.0,30/8/2009,"It's a touristy chain restaurant and we live in the city but we are still giving Cheesecake on top of Macy's a 5 star for our experience.  We came here for a late night bite after attending a fundraiser for the typhoon victims in Taiwan. It was about 11pm when we arrived and the place was packed as the elevator door opened. Luckily the hostess told us it was only about a 15 minute wait and the buzzer rang only after a few minutes. We were escorted to a table outside and the view was beautiful but it was chilly outside and by the end of our meal we were ready for some heat! The place is definitely touristy, everyone around us seemed to be visiting and our waiter asked us where we were from but we weren't bothered by it. We ordered the burger and the cajun chicken tenders. Both plates were huge! We have never seen such a big portion for chicken bites and a big scoop of fresh mashed potatoes and corn came on the side.  The burger also came with a huge serving of fries.  We had to order the cheesecake of course and the pecan caramel chocolate cheesecake was undeniably rich decadent and delicious.  The cappuccinos we ordered also hit the spot on a cold San Francisco summer night. Our waiter was great and really friendly!  If you want to come here and not wait, come for a late bite like we did! We had a great time."
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, United States",676,953,2057,5.0,28/8/2009,"5 stars for the gorgeous view overlook downtown. By far my FAVORITE cheesecake factory. (Check out my photo!) - Taken with my camera phone and still breathtaking. The city lights are worth the 30 minute wait for an outdoor table on a thursday night. Just buy a drink at the bar inside and step outside to the waiting area and catch up with good friends! There was a place to put my Haywire Hefeweizen down as we waited for our buzzer to go off. Yes, this place is crowded, but it's in the middle of downtown San Francisco, it's only expected! And thank you to our waitress who cracked jokes with us all night. I ate so much of their ""brown bread with oats on top"".. you know what i'm talking about!! The one that no one actually knows the name of. I had enough slices that I had to opt for the Thai lettuce wrap appetizer. Not my proudest moment as I should've gone with my gut feeling, the avocado eggrolls, but it was a large serving for an appetizer. Here are my usual favs from Cheesecake though: -They have a great lunch pizza + salad deal (you certainly get what you paid for) -Pasta Carbonara -The Club sandwich (I like my thin crisp fries) -All smoothies are great -Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake"
H. A.,"South San Francisco, United States",3,117,2,5.0,22/8/2009,"Seems a little silly that I'm reviewing a chain restaurant in San Francisco, but I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. The food is always consistent and the cheesecakes are all delicious.I don't think I have ever had anything here that wasn't good, they are generous with their portions, and there is so much on the menu to choose from.  I come here often and like to sit outside on sunny days.  I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!"
Nicole F.,"Eastvale, United States",4,64,14,5.0,22/7/2009,"I remember, without knowing, just ordering an handsome size of Caesar salad with dressing without meaning to; it was A LOT of food!  You get so much food that if I ever do take it home, it just ends up soggy, or worse, in the trash.  However, this will serve as a warning for next time, a lesson learned, that I will focus on spending money on the main course and, of course, on the cheesecake.  In addition to their signature dessert cakes, I would, hands down, recommend the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer.  Overall, this venue is located in an excellent location (on top of Macy's over looking Union Square), and I'd like to think that it's not as hectic and crowded as it is during the Holidays, once around the time that I visited.  The servers are excellent as far as serving your food on time and presenting themselves professionally (prepare to tip big!).  The inside is subdued, romantic, yet family-friendly.  You can get the option for a romantic feel by arriving in the evening, or just take the family out for a lunch, early dinner outing with some nice cloud-obscued sf weather."
Renee S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,57,1,5.0,30/6/2009,So what if you have to wait the whole night for a seat???  So what if its usually so crowded you cant walk? So goddamn what!  Their cheesecake is worth it!  Their cheesecake is TO DIE FORRRRRRRRRRR.  Omg cheesecake. the most delicious cheesecake. in all kinds of flavors. with delicious cream on top. mmmmm
Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, United States",182,1861,2456,5.0,27/6/2009,"I know people are quick to poo-poo this place because it is a chain restaurant, Macy's advertises to you with every flip of the menu page & it is always busy as hell...but I secretly love this place. I have such fond ""back in the day"" memories of this place: my college girls & i stumbling out (from one too many girlie drinks) clutching our half eaten vanilla bean cheesecake slices in their signature to-go container/bags. Or waiting TWO HOURS for a table big enough to accommodate 11 people on a Saturday night because one of my girls INSISTED we spend all her birthdays here. Good times, good times... Yes the wait is bitchass, yes its 85% tourists, yes its a chain restaurant, but in their defense, the food is consistently great & the menu selection is so massive, it's as thick as a book. Basically, they have whatever you want to eat between shopping & sightseeing.  My favorite foods here include:  - crabcake sandwich (crispy outside, moist inside & served with zesty tarter sauce) - avocado eggrolls (that tamarind dipping sauce is off the hook) - the new ""small plates"" menu... the stuffed mushrooms & shrimp scampi crostini are delicious (plates are too small to share, in my opinion) - Louisiana chicken pasta (spicy, HUGE portion) - miso salmon - dessert: adam's peanut butter fudge ripple & fresh banana cream - drinks: frozen iced mango smoothie, strawberry cremsicle (you don't even know there's alcohol in there) & pomegranate mojitos. The ambiance is great-dim, not too loud, beautiful ceiling/wall paintings. If you get seated outside, there are (very functional) heating lamps & the most awesome views of Tiffany & Co, Niketown & the other stores lining Union Square. Service is always fast & friendly. It's good stuff, people."
Neil R.,"Newark, United States",233,369,124,5.0,4/6/2009,"I haven't been here in ages and I was here a bit ago and it was bloody gorgeous. The view of the city, the scene, the decor of the restaurant, and honestly the staff rocks man. The hostess had killer sense of humor, the waiter was polite and prompt with our orders and he knew about my fav. band - Coldplay!  The food/drinks never disappoint. Try their Louisiana pasta with Strawberry Lemonade and if you have room, get their 30th Anniversary cheesecake dessert. Pure SEXXX!  Added plus: They play COLDPLAY and other GREAT music! The inside is really gorgeous... I was in awe with the colors and designs of the ceiling. Nice!  Sooo def. check this place out. Great with family or friends and even better with a hot date after dark! ;-)"
Nelli K.,"San Francisco, United States",61,42,3,5.0,29/5/2009,"mmm, i love the chesscake factory. mmmm avocado rolls."
J H.,"Granite Bay, United States",0,65,13,5.0,20/5/2009,"Even though Cheescake factory is a chain restaurant, there is nothing like eating on the terrace eight floors up overlooking Union Square on a sunny day. Food is very good although with the size of their portions you might want to share. Maybe go for appetizers so you can have dessert."
Janet Z.,"San Francisco, United States",233,438,1710,5.0,9/3/2009,I came here last year for my friend's birthday! I always get the lemonade! Free refills! The FRIED CALAMARI was good! it comes with this refreshing little salad and their ROASTED VEGETABLES AND GOAT CHEESE PIZZA  is good! I love the combination of all off the veggies! it is just something about eggplant that makes the pizza oh soo gooood. I would def come here just to get that pizza. The last time I came here I ordered the THE FACTORY BURGER and it was pretty good! That was when I discovered that cheddar and beef go so well together my boyfriend at the current time got the DOUBLE B.B.Q. BACON CHEESEBURGER it was pretty massive and for a guy like him he didn't even finish it and believe me he is huge!
Jose D.,"Pittsburg, United States",4,31,3,5.0,2/3/2009,i think this cheesecake factory is very good the service was good the food was Delicious and all the food food we ordered got to our table FAST!! also the wait was not that long and the atmosphere was very fun and comfortable and the waiters were very kind whether you are looking for a fast bite or a long dinner this is the place to go.
Kozy T.,"Hayward, United States",4,14,9,5.0,10/2/2009,"I used to go this restaurant on every Sunday to have lunch with different friends. Actually, I just wanted to eat the yummy cheese cake and I know every meal here in cheese cake factory is so huge!! I can't consume it!! So, I recommend those who don't wanna eat much for cheese cake after meal as dessert to order AVOCADO EGGROLLS!! This is appetiser but still it is not so small and not so big. Also, It's sooooooooooo delicious! I really love it!!  Plus, my favorite cheese cake is LEMON RASPBERRY CREAM CHEESECAKE!! Try it!!"
Kayla T.,"San Francisco, United States",155,7,,5.0,5/2/2009,By far my favorite restaurant of all time! Their salads are bomb! The menu is endless so there is something for everyone.  The portions are huge.   The service is always great and I love the decor.  The only down side is they don't take reservations.  I've waited up to two hours on a Saturday night.  We didn't get seated until 12:30am!  It was worth it though!!!
Sooner S.,"CA, United States",187,67,,5.0,26/1/2009,"I love this place. It's a great place for picky people because of the large selection of food on the menu.  They have lots of food, drinks and desserts to choose from.   My favorite thing to order is the Chinese Chicken Salad.  Its got crisp wontons, orange and sesame seeds and the special Chinese plum dressing is oh so good.  It's really big and good to share with a date or friend. The next time you're downtown shopping, I suggest you take the time to have lunch at The Cheesecake Factory above Macy's."
Tiffany H.,"Alameda, United States",465,643,1932,5.0,24/1/2009,"Come on, guys!  What's there to hate about the Cheesecake Factory besides the wait?  And the occasional loony server?  The food is great, the amount is enough to feed a small country, the price is right, the desserts (whether or not you like cheesecake) are fantastic, and the vibe is awesome!  I always have a great time here with my friends and family and just knowing that I'm in the downtown SF Cheesecake Factory out of all the other possible ones just makes it that much better.  Cheers to that!"
Dee-Dee S.,"La Jolla, San Diego, United States",113,374,5,5.0,18/1/2009,"Wow.  Where do I start with this place? I love The Cheesecake Factory, although in LA, the locations are so far apart and sparse.  Whenever I go to San Francisco I always have to stop here for the view and the food.   I went there with my cousin on a Monday night at 6pm, the wait was OK (although I anticipated it since this place is so popular), and the service was incredible.  We dined al fresco and had the view of Union Square...so awesome!  We both ordered salads and were impressed by the size of them; my Chinese Chicken Salad was so huge I had to take it home. =P I'll continue stopping by here every time I go to the city."
HL N.,"Daly City, United States",1,21,,5.0,18/1/2009,"I don't give 5 stars out easily, if ever, but something happened tonight in this usually so crowded we don't wait restaurant. Not only because it's a tourist attraction and popular local haunt known for it's desserts, but their portions are HUGE, good, and so forth. Back to the unusual occurrence: after packing in enough food for the seven of us on a birthday event, one of my young daughters placed the leftovers on the floor in the bag, which tipped, and spilled onto the floor. We apologized and 2 workers came by to clean up the food. I figured, oh well, there goes the pasta, but no, our server comes back a few minutes later with a COMPLETE brand new order? Huh, what gives, isn't it too bad Charlie? I was so impressed, I gave another 20 on top of the 18% gratuity that was factored in the bill. Now you know why people such as Jerry Rice come here (I ran into him a couple of years ago here). This is a must visit if you're a tourist, or were born here 50+ years ago, as I was."
Carlie R.,"San Francisco, United States",45,19,,5.0,12/12/2008,"Love coming here. The food is very tasty and the cheesecake? Well, what can I say. I'm addicted to cheesecake. My favorite food here? Well that would have to be the Artichoke lunch mmmmmmmmm. Have never had to wait very long for my food. Service has always been great, but, then, I get here early for lunch. Will have to try it sometime for dinner."
