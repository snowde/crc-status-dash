Christine C.,"San Francisco, United States",190,196,88,5.0,23/11/2008,"Best time to go: 10PM. Worst time to go: anytime before then. You expect to wait the 2 hours for a table. I've done it plenty of times. It sure is worth it though.  Ryry and I's Cheesecake Factory staples: Avocado Rolls - avocado buttery goodness and the tamarind-cilantro is so good I lick every delicious drop before the server takes the dish away. Pasta da Vinci - cooked in a Madeira wine sauce with chicken, mushrooms and penne pasta. Not heavy like most chain-restaurant pastas... it's beautiful. Frozen Iced Mango - yummy mango-y goodness, non-alcoholic. We've also tried: The Portabello Mushroom Sandwich - huge and delish!  Thai Lettuce Wraps - listed under appetizers but really a dish unto itself! A heaping of lettuce, chicken, two kinds of dressings, carrots, bean spouts, wonderful! Firecracker Salmon Rolls - good but only 4 rolls. Louisiana Chicken Pasta - a bit on the heavy-cheesy side. Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms - gigantic portion, really a dinner for 2! There are too many dishes to try in their never-ending menu! Everything is really good. The only down side is the possible wait for a table. It's too popular for it's own good! ***Side Note: Since you really can't get away without ordering a slice of cheesecake, take it to go because you're going to be way too full to eat it at the restaurant."
Jonathan L.,"Tampa, United States",457,120,205,5.0,13/11/2008,"Pros: Great location, middle of downtown, San Francisco. Good atmosphere to have a conversation and enjoy good food. Super full to even try cheesecakes from here but I swear, next time I will eat some cheesecake. Good service.  Cons: Average wait for seating is an hour. It can get a little crowded. But other than that. Five stars for great restaurant."

CHI H.,"Milpitas, United States",75,57,17,5.0,10/10/2008,"This place is awesome! Beautiful view and good food is the best when youre in good company. It was busy though when my friends and I went here, but probably because it was during Christmas time. We had to wait 45 minutes! All good, that's what the bar is for. We were all in a good zone when we got seated. It's not cheap, but it's not pocket burning expensive either. Order your food, and then get a Flying Gorilla. Trust me. You'll love it. It tastes like chocolate. Oh and mmmmmm, a cheesecake! duh."
Nikita K.,"San Francisco, United States",105,550,460,5.0,9/10/2008,"MY FAVORITE PLACE. there are very many cons well just the long wait for everything. The food though covers for the wait. The pasta was large and so good. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is to die for, and im serious. SO GOOD!"
Jose C.,"Richmond, United States",48,211,47,5.0,28/9/2008,"i went here last friday for my birthday with a freind of mine to eat this place is actually preatty cool the wait was kinda long about 30 minutes but the views of downtown san francisco from there padio made it all worth the wait it,s on the 7th floor of macys in union square in downtown san francisco when we finally sat down i ate some chicken pasta and a cheesecake for a desert it was really good i,m giving this place 5 stars because of the views of the city the staff was really freindly and the service was not that bad even if the place was kinda busy i will definatly return here in the future...."
Larry J.,"San Francisco, United States",35,205,140,5.0,1/9/2008,"It pains me to give a giant chain like the Cheesecake Factory 5 stars.  I am not a fan of chains but I will explain why I give the place high marks.  This is the only place where I get a really good sized salmon. In fact, the largest salmon fillet I've ever had at a restaurant was at The Cheesecake Factory. It was as large as the size I would buy at the grocery store. When ever I go to a seafood restaurant and order salmon, I am always disappointed with the size. The price for their salmon was under $20 too.  It was very well seasoned and the garlic mashed potatoes were excellent.  For drinks I had a Long Island Iced Tea.  The bartender did a phenomenal job and it tasted great. I've also had their Mai Tais. They are excellent and so are their mojitos. These are cocktails that aren't simple to make. If a bartender can make these right then I give them a thumbs up. That combined with salmon & garlic mashed potatoes that can satisfy my discriminating taste? They will certainly get a 5 star rating from me.  I've also had their burgers, pasta, other seafood, cajun dishes and Mexican dishes. This place does them all really well. No wonder why there is a 2+ hour long wait.  Cheesecake? Of the 30+ times I've ate Cheesecake Factories around the USA, I've only had their cheesecake once. I lost my sweet tooth when I was like only 10 years old. Not much in to sweets but I do occasionally like to have a plain thick & creamy cheesecake with nothing on it. Yum, yum!"
Leah E.,"San Francisco, United States",246,363,915,5.0,1/9/2008,"It was our date night.  We decided to use our $25.00 gift certificate from last Christmas.   We waited for an hour. Part of it we spent just admiring the view of the City from the top floor of Macy's.  The rest window-shopping for furniture downstairs.   We were seated on the patio.  It got really chilly. Good thing that BF was sitting by the heat lamp.  I had my leather jacket.   We ordered all appetizers.  We loved the crispy avocado and the ahi tempura.  We thought the buffalo chicken was salmon but the waiter said it was ground chicken mixed in with buffalo sauce then deep fried.  It was good, though.  We had to order calamari because it was BF's favorite.  Everything was good.  The bread was fresh and warm.  The portions were huge. We ended up barely touching the chicken appetizer and ended up taking it home. Their glass of Cheesecake's Cabernet by Robert Mondavi was generous and must have been just poured from a newly opened bottle.   Sipping good wine with a view of Union Square, the feel of the cold wind on your cheeks, your sweetie smiling in front of you--that's all part of it.  The City lights starting to turn on while the sunset was coming into view.   We had Godiva cheesecake. Gotta have cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, right?  We ended up taking two more slices to go.  You can go to any Cheesecake Factory but going to the one at Union Square is an experience--the waiting, the crazy crowd, the view, the tourists--they are all a part of a wonderful dining experience in San Francisco.   I had some pictures taken by the cable car, pictures of Union Square,  etc. Bought BF new shoes at Aldo's and a purse for me. It was fun playing tourists in my hometown.   It was a beautiful date night."
Steve N.,"Brentwood, United States",199,453,403,5.0,27/8/2008,"The wait is long, but worth it.  I've been to 2 other locations, but none were 8 stories over Union Square!  The outside seating and view alone are worth it to me. Also, the Lemon Raspeberry cheesecake is a must have.  Don't say you've been to CF until you've had this. Don't do it! The drinks are expensive.  I'm learning this is more and more common these days.  So, I've decided to go in knowing I'm paying for the drink and everything I can see while I drink it.  That's what I'm paying for.   I won't buy $10 drinks to stand in YOUR living room and you wouldn't either.  Get it? The food can be hit or miss.  Nobody's perfect, but CF is fairly consistent in serving their best items without any problems.  The Chicken Piccata is amazing and something we always get together.  The Steak Diane is also a top choice for my wife and me.  I will say that the very extensive menu is not all great foods, so ask the server what to stay away from.  That move saved us one time, so don't be afraid.  After all, it's your meal. And yes, tourists go there.What would SF be without tourists??  So, if you're a resident or local, get over yourself.  Act like you looked into visiting a place like this and plan for it!  I put my name in for the 2 hours wait, then took my gorgeous wife over to Victoria's Secret and had some fun there for a bit.  Then we walked, talked, and held hands in and around Union Square.  Then we shopped for sexy lingerie at Macy's together.  Then we went back to wait with 20 MINUTES left.  It is what you make of it, my friends.  I love going here.  Bring some cheese with you if you're just gonna whine about it!"
Charleen S.,"Redwood City, United States",83,91,4,5.0,19/8/2008,"When I first discovered The Cheesecake Factory, it was love at first sight. I think this was my first location and I love it, but it's always sooooo crowded and busy. To me though, it's worth the wait. It's a nice little spot above Macy's in Union Square. If you get an outside table you get a nice view of Union Square and all the shi-shi stores around there (Tiffany and Co., etc...) Service is good, I have no complaints there. To me, eating here is an experience!"
Ryan B.,"Plano, United States",270,152,15,5.0,18/6/2008,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory location by far for the view and ambiance. Every other CF's are either parked at the mall or some kind of shopping establishment. Of course with the location, there is a long wait, but it's not bad considering Macy's is just right there and you are free to wander around to kill time. If you plan to dine in the outdoor patio, please bring at least a sweater. SF summers are usually spoiled by the wind and or the fog that likes to creep up in the afternoon and evening hours. This particular night we went, it was both.  For the food, typical of CF, the portions are plenty and sometimes it's enough for 2 people to split. My good friend and I decided to get sandwiches. I had the grilled shrimp and bacon club which is pretty damn good. She had the grilled chicken and avocado club on rye bread. Both were fantastic. We both agreed the shredded lettuce was a bit too messy and it would have been better if they used larger slices instead. You can never come here and not have the cheesecake. Fresh strawberry is always a favorite. I guess it's not strawberry season yet. The strawberrys although big, red and juicy looking, were  a bit tart. Overall, this will now have to be my favorite CF of them all which explains the 5 rating."
Carolyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,66,1,5.0,30/5/2008,I really enjoyed eating here.  Despite the crowd we were served in a timely manner and I really like their salads. I even got to enjoy meeting the 3 people at the table next to me! All Cheesecake factories tend to be busy and noisy - I guess that seems to be consistent across the country as the Maryland one and the L.A. one was the same.
Denny R.,"Petaluma, United States",45,188,,5.0,20/5/2008,Great food and large portions.  It has a huge menu but I always have the same thing..the bacon and prawn club...best sandwich ever!  They make a mean mojito as well :-)  Just expect a long wait...
Laurice R.,"Torrance, United States",101,135,46,5.0,1/5/2008,"So my husband and I came to San Francisco for our first time and decide to check out the Cheesecake Factory for our 13 year anniversary dinner.  Of course we've been to our local Cheesecake Factory many times and have always loved it. We started off at the bar, because as always there was a wait.  I ordered the Well-Mannered Martini (kettle one vodka, olive juice, and hand stuffed blue cheese olives) YUM-O!  My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, also very tasty.  Edamame as a pre-dinner snack and we were set! This one was very nice, dare I say better than our local restaurant.  The ambiance was so romantic and we were seated with a perfect view of the city.  As the sun set and the lights of the city came on, it was the perfect setting for our ""date"". We both decided to order something off the menu that we'd never had before.  I got the Bang-Bang-Shrimp (it usually comes with chicken, but we don't eat meat; fish only on occasion) which was to-die-for delicious.  My husband ordered a stir-fry veggies with shrimp and noodles plate (i can't remember the name) and it was incredible.  We just shared because they were both SO good.  The portions are huge so of course we took the rest to-go and also order banana cream pie cheesecake for the hotel after-party, lol. Our waiter was attentive, not the best, but decent.  He took a break mid-way and was replaced with Miss No-Personality.  Later he returned to find us still there on round 3 of drinks. We were definitely satisfied and will definitely return next time we're in the city."
Dave Y.,"San Francisco, United States",3,11,,5.0,25/4/2008,"My wife Becky and I just love this place!  You can get hibachi steak, teriyaki chicken, Baja chicken tacos, Mandarin-style spicy cashew chicken, and Thai lettuce wraps all at the same place!  It's like a culinary world tour! Totally worth the hour plus wait."
Ray R.,"Newark, United States",41,163,7,5.0,7/4/2008,"Like babies- seen one, you've seen em all. So blah blah blah about the restaurant and its food. This review is for the service. I had the pleasure of being helped by the by the amazing SOPHIA, my bartender who quickly became my waitress. Not only is she totally cute, with her shades of gold eye-shadow but the girl can make an AMAZING MOJITO! Dare I say even better than moms. OMG.  She kept up with the conversation between my friend and I as if we have been hangin out since high school. And made sure we were very well taken care of. Need less to say, I didn't want to leave."
Tevina T.,"San Francisco, United States",24,93,9,5.0,30/3/2008,"Ahh, it's been a while since I last came here. Maybe wow, a good few years or more. For a while I was hovering my mouse over 4 or 5 stars, and finally I've settled for five as I recall the pleasant experience I had at the Cheesecake factory. My boss decided to take me here one night (because I had never been before). I don't think we had reservations, do they even take 'em? Not sure, but anyway, we had to wait for quite a while since it was prime time for dinner, but they gave us one of those electronic light things that start spasming when your table is ready. Well, there was a ton of people, so we decided to go downstairs and frolic around in Macy's. I remember they had this mini pool table they set up for people to use (and decide if they maybe want to get a mini pool table for some reason) and my boss and I went one and one; it was intense. Ok, not really. It was pretty funny goofing around in the store which made the wait go by pretty fast.  Once we were seated, I ordered some sort of tropical fruity drink type thing because it sounded awesome at the time. When I got it, it was the nastiest drink I've ever had. Felt like I was drinking pure evil and tap water. Now, I'm not the type to complain and be like O HI THERE THIS TASTES LIKE SH*T, MIND GIVING ME SOMETHING BETTER? But thankfully, our waiter saw the look of disgust on my face and came over, very politely offered to switch my drink to something I would like. I was surprised at this, and very happy because then I went with something I actually knew. Gooood ol' soda, no extra charge. How awesome is that?  Overall, I remember the experience being pretty awesome. The atmosphere was nice, kind of loud, but that allowed us to eavesdrop easily into other people's conversations and laugh at them. I mean, uh.... Anyway, their cheesecake was awesome as well. Can't remember what I got, but it was damned good because I would love to go back again."
