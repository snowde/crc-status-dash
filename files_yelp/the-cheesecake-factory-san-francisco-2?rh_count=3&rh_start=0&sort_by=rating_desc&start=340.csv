Jenn N.,"Brentwood, United States",722,778,894,5.0,6/11/2007,"I dream about their rasberry lemon cheesecake. Often. There are so many great places to eat in the city.  I wondered why there was such a long wait for this place.  I just wanted my cheesecake. Then they took us out on the balcony, over-looking Union Square.  It was at night and the lights were breathtaking.   That's why.  Question answered.   Waitress was cute, quick and friendly."
Shane W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,5.0,26/10/2007,"Oh... my... God... Becky, this is the greatest food ever! I mean look at the menus and you can see that you'll never tire of this place: the menu is extensive (like 15 pages or something or other). The decor is festive and has spectacular views of Union Square, it can be crowded at certain times throughout the day, but when you're eating one of their extraordinary desserts or drinking one of their delectable cocktails, you wouldn't care if they sat you on the escalators. The service could be the worst in the city (but it's not), there could be cracks in the wall (which there isn't), the main chef could have a googley-looking mole on this forehead (which I don't think he does), and I would still eat here. I'm a guy and I feel prego when I leave cause I can't stop eating their gorgeously tasty food (even though they are very generous protions). I know it's the Cheesecake Factory, but I crave their Tirimisu (even if I can go to North Beach) and I act like the weirdest pig when I consume those things... it's disgusting, but this is still making me hungry... think I'll go have a Cheesecake-Factory-baby right now... um."

Dee C.,"San Francisco, United States",717,339,50,5.0,6/8/2007,"Talk about guilty pleasures... Not only guilty of indulging delicious delights, but most of all enjoying an ultimate no no... The chain foods of all chain foods... Yes, I am a giver and lover to mom and pop restaurants all throughout the city, but The Cheesecake Factory sucks me in every time.  The crowds, the noise, nor the tourists can keep me away from my hour wait (I recommend; shop while you wait) for an outdoor seating on a beautiful day, hey even on a cloudy mist Summer day.  Funny thing is, I don't come here for the cheesecake, but for the hearty lunches and atmosphere. Or maybe... for the energy to shop at union square! Actually yes, the shopping is the only reason I'd be in Union Square to begin with. Now that Bloomies is right around the corner I find myself at the cheesecake factory a little more often.  The food selection is abundant. The Salads are my favorite. And get this, they even have a weight management selection. In the meantime it is good to know, but I have not tried.  To be seated outside is ideal, but remember you are in San Francisco! The weather is unpredictable from one minute to the next and there are no overhangs outside, but there are heaters. The last time I was there, I had to take my sunglasses off because of the mist. But oh well, my time there was still pleasant.  The bar selection is also fabulous! And please my friends, remember this isn't strictly a tourist place. I have run into many friends shopping that all choose and are excited to go to the top of Macy's to grab a bite to eat and not only that, but have randomly run into friends in the restaurant. It is a mecca of locals indulging in their guilty pleasures. Most just dont admit to paying for over priced meals at this popular chain restaurant. GET A FRUITY GIRL DRINK... They are fun once in awhile! Cheers!"
Ahnui Y.,"San Francisco, United States",103,69,,5.0,16/7/2007,"I will tell you what a good idea consists of. A lazy sunday, shopping for some jeans, china patterns, bras at Macy's, then going upstairs, doing a couple of shots of HYPNOTIQUE at the Cheesecake Factory, then spending $600 on pants."
Roger C.,"San Francisco, United States",16,23,,5.0,15/7/2007,"Cheesecake factory is my favorite casual place to eat. You spend at least 15 minutes just looking through the menu because they have everything. Their service is always really good no matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to. The food is very good and if you dont like it, just say so and they'll give you something else. They are really nice. Yup, there is always a wait, but its worth it. What to order? Everything is good even their Factory Nachos appetizer. I just dont know how they can make something as simple as nachos so good. Anyways, I highly recommend ordering the Thai lettuce wraps, miso salmon, or the Pasta Da Vinci. Very impressed with the level of service I receive everytime I go there. Restaurants with good service is hard to come by these days."
Katie G.,"Vancouver, Canada",81,105,,5.0,23/10/2006,"OMG, like, this is the best place ever. Kidding...but its one of those places where you get EXACTLY what you are expecting. So in that sense, there is no disapointment factor. I just moved to the USA, but had traveled to various cities in this country about 30 times in my life. And every time I came, I wanted 2 things: Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs. Typical but nonetheless good quality restaurants that cater to American overconsumption just don't exist in Canada - they are cheap and shitty, or expensive and good. The best cheesecake is the Carrot Cake one. Now that I live in a place where these cakes can be shipped, I may be tempted to order a whole one just for myself."
Emily S.,"Stockton, United States",286,904,829,5.0,29/9/2006,"I friggin' love this place.  If we had one close by, I probably would be sick of it.  They offer beyond cheesecakes,  there is always a line and it is always good!  Not the line, of course!"
Scott K.,"Manhattan Beach, United States",22,144,31,5.0,26/6/2006,"i love it here! True Story: my friends parents were visiting from sweden and didn't know that the cheesecake factory had HUGE portions. they each ordered ad app, salad, meal desert.. ha, can you imagine. they thought that americans ate WAY TOO MUCH food. we do, but it's still funny..."
Claud M.,"Oakland, United States",28,44,34,5.0,13/6/2006,"PROS:  the view from the terrace over union square, excellent atmosphere, good service, large portions, and DELICIOUS FOOD! CONS:  touristy, HOARDS of ppl, long wait, and eating outside can be quite chilly. Ironically, I could do without the cheesecake though..."
Edward I.,"Jersey City, United States",67,536,11,5.0,14/5/2006,"Average priced food, large portions and long waits which is perfect when you're hanging out with old friends, gives you time to talk about how crappy work is and realizing how much better your job is when seeing the servers wait on the impatient hungry people that go there. If you're into trying to get fast food and hate waiting, go to Burger King."
brenda b.,"San Lorenzo, United States",81,308,9,5.0,4/5/2006,"Since it is called the Cheesecake Factory, and they do offer a variety of different Cheesecake, they get 5 stars for delivering what they intend.  I like the Godiva cheesecake, and the fact that offer whipped cream on the side.  That said, I wouldn't recommend getting one of those annoying vibrating pagers that alert you to get back in line to return said pager so that you could wait to be served by a waiter who would rather not serve you.  Just walk over to the cheesecake counter, place your order, even during the busy times, it should take them no longer than 10 minutes, and LEAVE!!  The entrees may be SUPERSIZED, but so is their prices.  Run out with your cheesecake and dignity intact.  Because after you pay for dinner, beverages and dessert, plus tip, you sure won't feel like you got a good deal.  You'll feel like you've been had."
Vicky L.,"Jersey City, United States",756,873,380,5.0,30/1/2006,"people, it's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY, just get the cheesecake!  You cannot go wrong with a slice of the WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE.  It is delicious and for that I give this place a 5!   For everything else, probably a 3, but again, it's called the CHEESECAKE FACTORY for a reason, people must have misread the sign to say ""PASTA FACTORY."""
Valeria E.,"Ithaca, United States",13,30,57,4.0,6/1/2018,"We had a pleasure the meet the 2018 in the Cheesecake Factory at the Union Square! Besides the fact that we spent 2 hours waiting for a table, everything else was perfect. The service was very fast and server Nick was on the top of all our requests. I absolutely love when the servers advise you some dishes and listen to your preferences without pushing their own taste too much. Although the restaurant was supposed to close at the midnight, the guests were not rushed and were welcome to finish their cheesecakes with champaign overlooking the celebrating crowd from the balcony. A great start a new year!"
Andrew F.,"Oakland, United States",0,3,,4.0,4/1/2018,"This is probably good restaurant in bay area. Usually they always busy. But we got lucky and waited only 20min( original estimate was 45min). Our server was so friendly. The bread is so fresh and I had Steak Diana, my wife had chicken piccata. Food was delicious. We'll be definitely go back to this restaurant."
Maimuna F.,"Union City, United States",12,27,15,4.0,2/1/2018,"Although the hosts were very rude in the front and not kind at all, our server made it up. My cousin from Germany came to visit so we decided to take her out to SF and eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory with a view of the tree and ice skating rink. Our server name was Nicholas (Nick) and he was very kind and nice. He greeted us right away and brought us drinks as soon as he could since it was very busy. I love Cheesecake bread and butter so I asked for two baskets and without any hestitation he brought out two baskets! So nice! Other cheesecake factory tell me I can't or give me attitude. We ordered our food & got it very fresh and hot. His service was amazing, next time I come I want him again to be our server! Amazing job Nick"
Raja S.,"Beverly Hills, United States",0,3,,4.0,27/12/2017,There is a pretty long wait time but out of all the Cheesecake factories I've been to (about 7 so far) I'd say it's the best.  The food is the same as most of the others. It's just the location that can have a nicer view and also the long wait time that plays a major role here.
Jim E.,"Oakland, United States",42,207,102,4.0,24/12/2017,This place has a HUGE selection and once again I over ate! the pigeons on the table next to us appeared to enjoy their meal as well.. Lol   our server was very nice ! We sat out on the terrace which was great!
Rachel S.,"Stockton, United States",0,19,10,4.0,19/12/2017,"Visited San Francisco for a Christmas Shopping trip on weekend of Santa Con. Would give 5 stars but due to craziness of thousands of people enjoying their ""merriment"" & hundreds trying to eat at this restaurant, made the entire seating experience severely stressful! The staff was ridiculously overwhelmed (not their fault) & they definitely were the most disorganized & in over their heads. I didn't care because I knew that it was going to be well worth the wait! Once seated, received the best service & the food, drinks & dessert were amazing! Not to mention the ambiance & view outside on the patio!!! The Bistro Shrimp Pasta is the best wine based pasta sauce I've ever had!! Not an exaggeration. Gluten Free Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to die for!"
Eamon S.,"Burbank, United States",119,114,54,4.0,17/12/2017,"Was on a family outing to San Francisco to see the Christmas lights. We decided what better place than the Cheesecake Factory for some lunch. I've been told the view is great at the top of Macy's, and sure enough it was great!  After the initial 1hr or so wait for a table. We were seated and greeted by Oscar. He was fantastic and really made our experience even better! We ordered our dishes and enjoyed our experience. I had the Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries which was delicious, and topped it off with a cucumber lemonade and a beautiful salted caramel cheesecake.  Will definitely be coming here again when in the city."
