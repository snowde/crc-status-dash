Jenna G.,"San Francisco, United States",46,363,39,4.0,5/12/2017,"Cheesecake factory is pretty standard, and this location is extremely crowded. They don't have reservations, so on a Saturday night in December the wait was 1.5-2 hours for 2 people!! Bar is open seating though, so we sat there. I got a martini to drink, which was really good and had blue cheese stuffed olives NOM. For my main dish, I got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. I've had it before, it's only okay. Not super flavorful and the shrimp was definitely overcooked. However, I love the thinness of angel hair pasta. My boyfriend got the chicken and shrimp curry which I tried. It was pretty good, but heavy. I couldn't eat a whole plate of it. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a good place for a not too expensive meal, so great for families. They have a large variety on the menu too, but it's not the best for food snobs. Also their pumpernickel bread is bomb!!"
Arev L.,"Los Angeles, United States",16,164,256,4.0,22/11/2017,"Tuesday night, we got there around 6:15pm. Super crowded. We requested to be seated outside so we got our table at 7:28p.m. the wait were longer. Understandable.  Server was nice man. Sadly, he took a break right after he took our order. He told his partner that we need our drinks and bread.Then the waiting game start again. Waited for another 40 minutes for a basket of bread. By that time, I actually stand up and walked in, to complaint, (the table next to us which came after us, already finished with their bread. )  AND I have a very hungry young kid.  Amazingly, as I walked in, the waiter walked right in front of me with a basket full of bread. the smell of the warm bread calmed me down. Anyway, less than 5 minutes that we got the bread, our food started to came too 8:22. Had to flag to get drinks refill. Then our original waiter came back from his break dressed up in a festive hat and tie. ( He was very nice older gentleman, I didn't catch his name, sorry ).  Good conversation, good companion, good food, that's all that matters!!"
Randall O.,"Hayward, United States",84,55,84,4.0,12/11/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and left with a SUPER filled belly. I highly recommend sharing your meal with your friends, unless you're already planning on taking home leftovers. This Cheesecake Factory is located next to Union Square, and if you choose to dine outdoors, then you get a nice view that overlooks SF's most popular tourist attraction. We came here in early November, so the big tree and the ice rink was already set-up! The only major con about eating outdoors are all the pigeons, so if you're not a fan, then make sure you specify that you want indoor seating only. Since we came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was a standard 30-minute to 1-hour wait. When we were finally seated, we had an awesome waitress who had lots of energy and also gave us amazing service. For food, we started with the Factory Nachos, which was a huge nacho dish complete with guac, salsa, spicy chicken, jalapeños, and sour cream. We shared this amongst 4 people, and it was so good that it went away in less than 10 minutes. After our appetizer, my friend and I split the Factory Burger. It was super moist and packed with flavor, and describing it is making my taste buds water because it was so succulent!  Of course, we had to order a cheesecake to finish off our meal. We got the specialty birthday cake cheesecake, which tasted like a funfetti ice cream cake! ALSO, the complimentary bread that they serve always wins me over, especially the whole wheat. Overall, we had a great lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. If I come here next time, then I hope to get the same waitress (I actually forgot her name, but she had this unicorn pin!) because she was a real MVP!"
Holmes B.,"Mooroolbark, Australia",0,18,,4.0,10/11/2017,It would score 5 stars if they allowed bookings!!!  The food is delicious and you can take any guests there who are picky eaters and are guaranteed they will like something. Portions are massive and prices are fair and they let you take home leftovers which is fabulous. Every cheesecake flavor has been amazing except for the original strawberry which is a massive shame since it is most popular.  The waiters have been excellent every time we have gone and service was prompt however we went at off times.  You can see how quickly trying to get a table would be an absolute nightmare in busy periods. They need to figure out a better system fast and at least allow a certain amount of bookings. We would go more often and with guests if we knew we could organize a table easier.
Siva L.,"San Bruno, United States",0,2,6,4.0,5/11/2017,"The wait for this place is ridiculous. All that can be avoided just by accepting reservations, I had a party of 16 and the waitress was extremely rude because of how tight our table was. Then she went on break and we ended up with such a nice waiter for the rest of our meal. The food, however is great! As well as the cheesecakes."
Ann D.,"Apex, United States",8,25,,4.0,4/11/2017,"This was our go to for a couple of meals while in San Francisco. The staff were very friendly. We enjoy this restaurant although stay with the cheaper fare such as hamburgers. We made the mistake of ordering filet mignon steaks and they were not of high quality and way under cooked. The staff was very nice to try and fix it, but overall this is not the place you order a steak. We always enjoy cheesecake though and so after one meal we did order some and it was good. A little on the dry side but good."
Doran B.,Hong Kong,22,8,15,4.0,25/10/2017,Ordered cheese cake to go at 11:00pm on the way back to out hotel. Staff was helpful but it was a bit slow.
Rebeca J.,"Carmel, United Kingdom",0,5,,4.0,17/10/2017,"We enjoyed our visit to cheesecake factory, menu is very long and it's frustrating that prices aren't on the menu for cocktails. Cheesecake is excellent though. Would visit again."
Tim B.,"Butlers Marston, United Kingdom",0,33,39,4.0,12/10/2017,Apart from the front desk not being overly welcoming and it was hectic. Once shown to our seat the service could not have been better by Laurin! The food portions were huge and delicious but did not leave much room for cheesecake... so we got take out the day after! The restaurant is a great location overlooking Union square.
Tiffany M.,"Silicon Valley, United States",17,139,169,4.0,2/10/2017,Like any Cheesecake Factory you can expect the same standard recipes on the menu and great level of service! What sets this location apart from most other locations is the amazing view up above Union Square from the outdoor sitting area! It's great if you can sit outside. Just know this location is flipping amazingly busy so try off eating rush hour times for greater accommodating needs.  Definitely try this location sometime it's fun!
Tom B.,"Los Angeles, United States",432,41,2,4.0,1/10/2017,"Probably the most well-lit Cheesecake Factory I've been to. This location is on the top level of the Macy's. If you come, be prepared to wait a while. There's the ability for rooftop seating which is nice, but we opted to sit inside because some lady was feeding the birds so they were rowdy. We had a great experience with our severs. Good experience overall."
Mark K.,"San Rafael, United States",2,69,190,4.0,29/9/2017,"I have been coming here on and off for years, and have finally been ""coerced"" into writing a review. Like many Cheesecake locations, this place has its quirks. However, the food is good to very good the vast majority of the time, and the service here - unlike some other locations - is often spot on and more. In fact, it is unusual when I come here and find myself grousing about something. Having said that, let the review begin. This location is in the Macy's store at Union Square, up at the top - there is an elevator you can take (inside main entrance to your right), or you can slow journey up the many flights of escalators, taking in the various store floors as you go. As a note, if you arrive at a busy time, just hang out one floor down at the foot of the last escalators - lots of sofas on display, and if you're civil in behavior Macy's doesn't seem to mind if you park it for a little while; not sure the beeper reaches there, so leave someone upstairs if needed. This location has what I would call four dining zones - a bar, an area to the left of the bar (as you face it) and a larger room to the right, past the cheesecake display which tempts you upon entry. There is also an outdoor deck, but with limited shade, and with propane heaters for those summer days in SF! So, there is a bit of a choice of seating - tables or booths, as well. The menu is extensive (more than 250 items offered daily!) and does change in small ways now and then. Can't recommend anything, as I have too many favorites and you'd need several visits to try them for yourself. However, this last visit we had the Korean Fried Cauliflower (crispy cauliflower tossed with sweet and spicy sauce, toasted sesame seeds and green onion). First time for this, and of course, one of those rare issues - about 20 minutes after ordering a manager appeared (never a good sign) and said they were still making the sauce, so the dish would be a little delayed. Not a problem, except that the cauliflower arrived cold. Pretty sure it should have been warm-er. Still the taste was amazing, and although served with a ranch side (?!) the taste of the sauce was more than enough. Will have again! The other appetizer was the lightly breaded fried zucchini sticks, which I always enjoy - WITH the ranch side! We had salads for main entrees, a  Chinese Chicken Salad (chicken breast, rice noodles, lettuce, green onions, almonds, crisp wontons, bean sprouts, orange and sesame seeds, tossed in Chinese plum dressing. This was presented well, but the dressing (especially compared to other places we had this type of salad) was bland - no flavor whatever. Very disappointing. The other salad was the Cobb (with chicken and bacon on the side) and a sub of ranch dressing (which is a little tangy - try it!). Very good salad! And of course, we had to have cheesecake for dessert, and the Key Lime was perfect - tangy, tasty and not overwhelming in size. Don't forget the bread! What I call brown bread, and a sourdough type are offered - I only enjoy the brown bread, warm and soft!  I noticed the butter this visit was not offered in the usual foil wrapped pads, but a square in a small dish - forget to reorder? Not sure if this will become the regular way of serving butter, but if so -- note to manager -- PLEASE, let it get to room temperature before serving. Way too hard to spread, even on warm bread. Anyway, a couple of hiccups, unusual here at this location, but overall worthy of 4-stars. Service was attentive, polite, at times humorous and social, and professional. Will review again - someday! - so in the meanwhile, check it out for yourself."
Sweatha R.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, United States",9,7,,4.0,4/9/2017,"Nice food, very kind staff also really liked the cheesecake. I would recommend people to go to this place. The prices are very reasonable"
Diana W.,"San Francisco, United States",73,413,48,4.0,30/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is...you know exactly what you'll get when you visit one, and this one is no exception.  The menu is reliable, and the service friendly at this location.   I suppose the stellar star would be the view from the outdoor patio tables, as you're in the skyseats over Union Square.  (This one is filled to the brim with tourists-not that that's bad, but you know the drill.) We had a regular 2 person, middle of the row half booth, which was fine.  Our wait was about 40 minutes on a Thursday night-there is usually a crowd lined up to put a name in for a table...so be ready to hang out a bit.  There aren't a ton of seats to wait on, so mostly people just stand around all over the place around the desk-which looks like madness. All in all, I'd definitely pop in again for a slice of cheesecake to go from the bakery counter.  (I do like the banana one!)   For dinner though, unless I was craving a certain Cheesecake Factory specialty, I'd probably just go somewhere more local in the area...there are tons of great restaurants on every street around Union Square.  :) Have fun! TIP: *  You can only put your name in the queue in person, so first come, first seated. * I don't know what the new Cakepay app is for, except for linking your payment cards, as it won't hold you a place in line...but while you wait, feel free to download it from the app store and fiddle around with it, you have time on your hands-LOL! *Use the Macy's escalators to the 8th floor to get right up to the checkin counter or if you can cram in, the elevator also goes right there..."
Kathleen L.,"Kitchener, Canada",23,4,,4.0,25/8/2017,It was a crowded and busy Thursday night and there was a wait but it was shorter than what we were told! We sat outside on the patio which was warm enough with the heaters! Our server Laurence was attentive and kind and we overall enjoyed our food (French Country salad and Chicken Reisling). Great view of Union Square at night!!
Shubhra P.,"Union City, United States",0,3,6,4.0,25/8/2017,Amazing Cheesecake. Chipotle Pasta is a must try.  Food is amazing here. Our server Katie was nice. We got seat pretty quickly given it was a Friday evening. Will definitely try again
Kathy D.,"San Francisco, United States",2,33,10,4.0,21/8/2017,"We went around 3:30 & waited for about 15 minutes. Me and my friend got two appetizers. The fried cheese was a bit bland but definitely satisfied our cravings and the cuban roll was so flavorful! For the pasta, I got the farfalle. It was a big portion and I felt like they added too much sauce. Other than that, everything was fine. Good service."
Steven W.,"Anaheim, United States",172,746,2081,4.0,19/8/2017,Will always have a line and wait time. You take the elevator up from Macy's. They do have outside dining with a view of Union Square but the restaurant itself is already large!
Alice L.,"San Francisco, United States",24,184,658,4.0,16/8/2017,"Same as before, I love coming here and I love their food. However, the servers really need to step up. Our waitress was friendly tonight but the rest of the staff felt like they either just don't want to be here or I'm bothering them by asking for a simple napkin.  I was told the wait for a table inside for 2 on a Tuesday night at 9:00pm was 50 minutes. However, it ended up being only 25 minutes. Also, I appreciate the host for recognizing who were in line vs. who were cutting the line."
Scott M.,"Springfield, United States",2,55,41,4.0,26/7/2017,"Incredible view of the city. Top floor of the Macy building with outdoor seating. The food is great, as expected. Problem is the food is so good and the portions so large, it has to be my only meal of the day because if I ate before, there is no room for desert. When you're on vacation, it's tough to take my leftovers.  Food was great and the seating was quick, however, our first server had to go on break and the guy who covered for him was either new or had too many tables. Didn't see him much. 5-star food, 3-star service this time."
