Mikhail F.,"Stanwood, United States",0,11,1,4.0,25/7/2017,"If you're a tourist in the Bay Area, this is a must. The food and service is good. Just like any other Cheesecake Factory nationwide. You're pretty much in it just for the Patio views. It's on the 8th floor of the Macy's Department Store and it has its own elevator. The view of Union Square and the surrounding buildings is lovely if you like watching the hustling city. This is a very busy restaurant located in one of the most congested and busiest parts of San Francisco. So expect long lines and waiting times on the weekends and during the summer."
Bharath S.,"Cupertino, United States",104,3,,4.0,8/7/2017,Always enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory! Surprisingly low wait times and delicious cheesecake make for a great weekend brunch :)
Karin H.,"CA, United States",8,12,12,4.0,5/7/2017,"Very good food, salads, burgers, Sammies, steak, Shepards pie. Mid-range price. Also good drinks.  Kidsfriendly. They have a kids menu up to 10 years. Think ahead and book a table or you might have to whait about 1 hour for seating.  Good waiters. A bit messy.  Supergood cheesecake about 8 dollars a piece. Separately packaged doggie bags, cause you'll need it!"
Kristine F.,"Hayward, United States",446,567,3746,4.0,1/7/2017,"We've got lots of Cheesecake Factories in the Bay Area. What's so special about this one? 8th floor outdoor rooftop of Macy's in DT SF, that's what! The view of union square is worth the wait, doesn't matter if you're a tourist or local. Heating lamps for those always cold folks or opt for dining indoors. Take the special elevator directly up or save time waiting and use 7 sets of escalators to view what Macy's women's/home has to offer. Take note of Starbucks on the 4th floor, Burger Bar on the 6th, and Boudin/Jamba/etc. in the basement. 35 min wait for two at 9pm Saturday night for outdoor seating! Time went by relatively fast but boy was the atrium packed! There was one rude hostess that obviously needed to go home and take a chill pill, but everyone else was polite. Someone probably told her to take a break cuz she disappeared for 20 min. Sometimes I forget how many tourists there are in the city; hosts ask for a US phone # and many didn't have one. Another observation: the bill holder has a card explaining customary tips in the US. Must be nice for servers to be paid better than minimum wage in the U.K. and elsewhere. Patrizah A. took great care of us-- super sweet and cheerful with a genuine smile, checked back at the right times and offered cheesecake recommendations since they discontinued white chocolate blueberry. The new cold brew Coffee & Cream Chocolate Supreme is a hit with caffeine lovers. Ultimate Red Velvet! Window seats! Our original table wasn't clean so we got better ones on the left side with fewer people around. Those seats got filled right before we left at 11! 12:30am closing time on weekends.  Food! I tried something new but similar to my Chicken Bellagio. Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta with crisp coated thinly pound chicken atop mildly spicy bow tie Cajun pasta with mushrooms and bell peppers. Yum! Couldn't finish this 2200 cal dish (oh heck no, half was for the next day) since I cleaned out my little Caesar salad and indulged in calamari. Sophie N. got the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, asparagus add on. Succulent shrimp! Strange how this dish is listed as Garlic Lemon Shrimp online, asparagus already added in. Excellent experience on the rooftop once again-- I hope it stays that way! Have patience and if you're so hungry you whine while in line, do everyone a favor and grab a snack downstairs in the basement, or mobile order some Starbucks!"
Amin S.,"Wilshire Center, Los Angeles, United States",113,10,10,4.0,30/6/2017,"Our server Ronda was fantastic. Super polite, friendly and smiling the whole time. I recommend sitting outside it's wonderful and warm till the sun goes down then it gets cold really fast"
Eric R.,"Twin Peaks, San Francisco, United States",113,118,472,4.0,20/6/2017,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan! Okay, I'll be honest I'm a cheesecake anything fan. So, you had me at cheesecake! I don't come here frequently, maybe once or twice a year. And even though I always walk out with cheesecake to go d'oh... I usually have a meal while I'm there too.  The location on Union Square in the heart of San Francisco makes this Cheesecake Factory maybe the busiest in the entire chain. The confusing part about this location is finding the entrance. If I recall, the actual restaurant is on the 8th floor of the historic Macy's building and you can only get there via the elevator entered at street level. I've been to this location several times and every-time there's a wait. Is it worth the wait? Probably not, but if you like cheesecake like I do then it's well worth it. It's up to you to decide. Oh, maybe this tip might help too... there's two lines (1) for the restaurant (2) for takeout. So make sure you're in the right one!  The lunch & dinner menu is typical American grub like hamburgers, but also small plates, salads, and specialties too. Who's fooling who? It's a chain restaurant, but I admit my weakness here is their cheesecake! My favorites include the original cheesecake, the fresh strawberry cheesecake, the tiramisu cheesecake... oh please! To be perfectly honest any cheesecake in front of me will be happily devoured. And the freshness, taste, and endless selection is what separates Cheesecake Factory from all the rest!  In a way I am glad I'm usually here only once a year. Imagine if I was a regular? My waistline? C'mon plus no stairs to burn off the cheesecake calories?! Hmph! I'll be back again pressing that 8th floor elevator button..."
Greg C.,"Castle Rock, United States",4,27,6,4.0,14/6/2017,"I get teased a bit for going somewhere and eating at a chain restaurant, rather than a local place. I lived an hour from any chain restaurants (other than a Red Lobster -- disgusting) so that's why I had that mentality. Now that I live in the Bay Area, I have plenty of options and am trying local places more often. When I went into The City two days ago, however, I did meet up with a friend for lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.  This location is really cool, in my opinion, and the two times I've eaten here, I ate outside overlooking Union Square -- great views from up there on either side of the Macy's sign (no, literally!).  I ordered the Georgia Peach cocktail, as recommended by the server when I asked, and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (also recommended when asked). Both were absolutely delicious. ZERO regrets. I am a big guy, I hadn't eaten breakfast, and wasn't eating lunch here until after 1 PM. I ordered the lunch sized pasta and STILL had leftovers to take home. That brown bread (What IS that bread? There's a debate online, and there's too many different answers!) may be the best thing here, honestly. That's not meant as an insult, but I've never tasted a better bread in my life.  My complaints here are as follows: the staff at the check in counter. They are a little ""gossipy"" and are clearly discussing others in whispered voices, looking around, and then giggling about it. That doesn't make one comfortable and is quite unprofessional. The other complaint/issue (and it's not even the fault of The Cheesecake Factory) is that if you sit outside, there will be birds flying VERY close to you/around you often. They also walk all over the tables and eat at the food left behind by customers. It just seems a little bothersome and unsanitary. However, I did ask to sit outside."
Jason G.,Auckland,0,5,,4.0,3/6/2017,"The meal sizes are generous and the service was good overall. Expect long waits at peak times, with limited seating while waiting. As you'd expect, the cheesecake is good and you have plenty of options. Some prices are omitted from the menu, so be sure to ask if you're on a budget. Beware that a 4% surcharge applies for ""employment related expenses""."
Sarah J.,"Azusa, United States",74,9,1,4.0,21/5/2017,Wait time horrendous. Food delicious! Free bread what more more could I want. I recommend the passion tea and the chicken pot stickers my son loves those. My husband is fan of the green tea.
Mike O.,"Daly City, United States",22,115,43,4.0,18/5/2017,"Came in tonight for dinner before watching a movie with my friend. Got here around 6, got seated right away. I'm pretty used to the long waits here on a Friday night, but nothing today. Got seated, and our server asked for our drinks, I just asked for water, my friend got iced tea which came out extremely quickly. We took a while to look through the menu because there's so much selection and a lot of new and not so new stuff since the last time we were here. It's funny how the calorie count is so high on most of the dishes, but if you've been to The Cheesecake Factory before you know it's because of the pure size of the dish. Ordered the calamari for appetizer and we both got the shrimp scampi with the steak Diane. Food came out fairly quickly and tasted pretty good. I would have actually gotten something bigger, but I didn't want to take leftovers into the theater after. It was the right amount of food and I was too full to order dessert. I don't think I made it to dessert the last several times I've been here because I'm so full from the entree. The cheesecake here is amazing, but I don't know if I'll ever get to have one again because I'm always stuffed from the entree. It's nice to know that I can get seated rather quickly on a regular weeknight. I'll be back again and again."
Peter J.,"Walnut Creek, United States",83,873,83,4.0,15/5/2017,"So, I ventured into The City to meet Vango/Mom for Mother's Day. This location,one has to enter through the Macy's. The entrance is on the Union Square side of Macy's. Then one takes the elevator to the eight floor to arrive at Cheesecake Factory. This was a rather ideal time. They opened at 9am yesterday, my mom and I arrived shortly after that. We were seated right away. I wasn't quite sure if they have a Brunch menu, but it turns out that they do. I decided upon ordering the French Toast, and my mom chose to have an Egg White Omlette. Jackie was our server in the beginning, she did a fantastic job, and sadly she had to take a brake, and pass us of to Joanne, she was great to. When my French Toast arrived, it was a wonderful presentation. It looks like they use French Bread here. It was served sprinkled with powered sugar, and small amount of diced strawberries on top. Yes, I took a picture, and will include that. It was getting pretty busy because of Mother's Day. This location also has outside seating, my mom and I dined inside. we had just the right amount of food to eat. This location is a reasonable walk from Powell Street Bart. Edgar, yes, I said ""Hi"" to Edgar. The water is a little tricky, you have to stand in just the right place. Overall, I'd have to say that it was a satisfying experience."
May Q.,Hong Kong,4,14,89,4.0,14/5/2017,I hate the number about calories but I love the rich ingredient in the cake. What can I do?
Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, United States",866,705,1110,4.0,11/4/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite chain restaurants. This particular one is extra nice because it's located on the top floor of Macy's which overlooks Union Square. The view up here is absolutely amazing. With that said, this also means it's quite a touristy spot and it's crazy crowded. They gave a buzzer for when your table is ready, which allowed us to wander around the floors only to wait some more even after our buzzer went off. It's a Monday night and somehow still incredibly packed. We ended up sitting inside, which got quite stuffy. It also didn't help with how hot it got as we shared a bottle of wine. One of my favorites here has to be their complimentary bread, especially the honey oat one --yum! Make sure to ask for extra of those. Between the two of us, we ordered to share the Crab Cake Bites ($8), Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($18), and Steak Diane ($29). Everything was yummy and came in huge portions! I know the menu gets intimidating here, but my go-to has and will always be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Since we were so stuffed, it didn't leave us room for the cheesecake. Yet, we still got a complimentary ice cream since it was my birthday. This is still one of my favorite spots though!"
Reuven R.,"San Jose, United States",41,16,,4.0,6/4/2017,"Nice location ,the outside has a really nice view ,and the service and food are great as always,toke them some time like 20 minutes I think to sit us down,but expect that everything was really delicious ."
L S.,"Daly City, United States",1,16,4,4.0,31/3/2017,The four-star rating is an average of several factors: Wait time  Menu selections - out of stock Wait staff service  View fom the balcony   Food quality
Cho M.,"San Francisco, United States",50,4,10,4.0,29/3/2017,Cheesecake and Bread are so good. But I don't like their food. I hope their food taste better if i go there next time. Love the environment.
Nadine Y.,"Toronto, Canada",67,1,4,4.0,28/3/2017,"Only waited for 15mins for a seat. Great view, awesome food and service. Definitely coming back."
Steve S.,"Los Angeles, United States",299,200,261,4.0,22/3/2017,"I absolutely love this Cheesecake Factory.  I usually sit at the bar and have a drink and eat. I truly love the Cheesecake Factory just because it literally has everything - EVERYTHING. It's amazing.  Goes from burrito, to chicken pot pie, to burger to orange chicken, to fish tacos, biscuits and gravy, fish n chips - I think you get the picture here.   Reason number 2 is consistency - no matter what day, or hour ... your food will always be delicious.  They have a great bar! I have never had a bad drink here.  I often order drinks with tonic and have never felt my drink was ""weak"" or not to measure.  If you come here and have never tried an item you want to try ... do it. Take a leap of faith.  Anything you order will be a fair representation or standard of how it should probably taste."
Andrea G.,"Monterey, United States",0,3,,4.0,21/3/2017,"Stopped in very last minute on a Sunday around 2-3 pm or so, and like I imagined there was a long wait time and it was busy. It took about 25 minutes to get a table outside in the dinning patio, but the view was well worth It. There is a large variety of plates on the menu, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was good, not the best, but good. My mother ordered a mushroom hamburger and it was very good. I would come back, and I do recommend on eating here if you don't mind waiting a long time to get a table, oh and it's also very crowded."
Thiago F.,"Oakland, United States",0,15,3,4.0,15/3/2017,"The good: the food, and the cheesecake. The bad: the crowd. What really bothers me is that the cheesecake slices are getting smaller (I used to have them like biweekly up until a couple months ago) and they tell the customers nothing's changed =/"
