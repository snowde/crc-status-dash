Michelle M.,"Los Angeles, United States",16,41,3,4.0,13/3/2017,This has got to be the best view in all of Union Square!! Love the rooftop dining and view. Restaurant was very busy when we went and about a 2 hour wait!
Ronn M.,"Foster City, United States",23,57,70,4.0,5/3/2017,"""Rene's Special"" is what I crave for everytime. Turkey or Chicken sandwich...and the great soup of the day. I kid you not. Nuff said. It's  ono."
Denis S.,"San Pedro, United States",1,44,2,4.0,27/2/2017,OK so cheesecake factory has OK food and drinks but this location is a 4 star because you just can't beat the view and they have heaters set up outside so it's so enjoyable. So trust me go eat here and enjoy Union square!!
David G.,"CA, United States",482,1659,5005,4.0,15/2/2017,"I love this cheesecake factory location; especially the dinning patio outside overlooking Union Square. The food is consistent, the menu varied, and service is always pleasant and helpful. Prices are pretty reasonable for the portion and quality. BTW they have now listed the calories for each dish......dam....1900 calories?  that is a whole days worth....yikes!!!! Wait times are insane so be prepared for at least an hour to two hours wait on busy nights. Great bar...and dont forget their amazing cheesecakes....god they are good!"
永林,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,4.0,13/2/2017,"There are many people, so we wait long time here.  I really like their cake.  I want to take my friend to go to Cheesecake Factory next time."
J L.,"Dallas, United States",0,6,,4.0,29/1/2017,"Great views, food and service! Pretty convenient location if you're staying in Downtown San Fran. They've outdoor and indoor seating. We dined in but enjoyed the great views of Union Square while we waited to be seated. We waited between 20-40 mins which isn't bad because the restaurant was packed. The food was great. We ordered zucchini, portobello and avocado fries as our appetizer. We wanted a country salad and some soups brought before our entrees. Usually this is a problem because they bring them with the main dishes but we told the waiter and he brought everything the way we wanted. We had the orange chicken and herbed salmon. Kudos because the latter was cooked perfectly. Our experience was good enough that we went again during our stay."
Sara B.,"Berkeley, United States",0,1,,4.0,13/1/2017,The last time I was there it took us 2 hours to get a seat but the food was great. I recommend the pasta marinara. And for a baby : they love  fries
Rebecca B.,"San Francisco, United States",211,14,37,4.0,10/1/2017,"Never rate a place for their service unless they're blatantly racist.  The service: Could be better, but they're always busy so it's understandable and I could care less about shitty service. Food is FOOD.  Ambiance: I usually get seated on the right side of the restaurant, but I got seated at the left side near the bar. There is less light on this side. However, I could see the outdoor balcony and the rustic decorations set the perfect mood. The food: REALLY GOOD. Or I was just really hungry. I ordered the chicken marsala pasta. Reeeaaally good. We also got a margarita pizza which I could not get enough of. Tip #1: The wait isn't so bad when you spend it a floor below the factory in the Furniture department of Macy's. The workers are friendly and hide their annoyance very well. I recommend choosing leather couches that recline. 10/10. Tip #2: Order a strawberry lemonade. Unlimited refills, sugar at the rim, YUMMY.  Tip #3: Keep refilling the heavenly brown bread. It'll make you too full to order the cheesecake thus saving money which can be used to pay the meter. (Who goes to The Cheesecake Factory to get cheesecake anyways? Am I right?).  Have fun"
Dominique M.,"San Ramon, United States",2,16,6,4.0,6/1/2017,"We went to Cheesecake Factory at Union Square, San Francisco on New Year's Day for breakfast. We arrived around 11am and there was no line. Yeah! We decided to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view. It was a tad cold, but we made that choice. The quality of food was the same as any other Cheesecake factory and they even accommodated a special request. HOWEVER, the service was horrible. It took forever to have the wait staff come to our table and equally long to bring coffee, take our order, serve the food, and then bring the bill. It may have been that it was a holiday weekend, but we did not leave there until after 1:30pm. It should not have taken that long!"
Vivian L.,"San Francisco, United States",49,12,7,4.0,5/1/2017,"One of my go-to restaurants when I'm shopping around Union Square and can't find a nice place to eat.  Unfortunately, a major downfall is the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. The several times I've been here, I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table, and that's on a good day. The wait and amount of people is absolutely insane during busier hours and the holidays. Definitely not the place to go if you don't have a lot of time to kill.  Otherwise, I think it's a good date spot to pick that isn't too expensive, has friendly customer service, and a large sized portions for meals. They always serve a couple of loaves of bread, along with quality butter, after they take your menu. This is a huge plus for me, since the actual order can take somewhat long to get to your table. Sitting outside is also really nice, especially when while the sun is setting. It's a little too cold to be sitting outside during the winter, but spring/summer is fine, and there are a few outdoor heaters. From my several visits, I've had:  Shephard's Pie: A huge plate of beef and veggies, topped with mashed potatoes and a parmesan cheese crust. Super filling and tasty, though I wish the meal instead came as a smaller portion with a variety of other sides to make it more interesting. Pasta Carbonara: I've ordered this the most! I love the creamy, cheesey sauce, and thin noodles. My default pasta choice. The server always asks if additional parmesan on top is preferred.  Factory Burrito Grande: A really, really huge burrito with different sauces on the side, and for $15! Pretty good and extremely filling - I got through a third and had to take the rest to go.  Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae: My favorite dessert! For $9, this is a really delicious, rich brownie sundae. On one occasion, I've come here looking to ONLY eat dessert, which was totally fine. The plate is huge, and even shared between two people, it's enough to make you full.  Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake: My favorite pick of cheesecake, I have a thing for tangy, tart desserts. Overall, I think their cheesecakes are a bit pricey per slice, as the slice is also quite small, but if you've never tried it before, it's worth buying a slice or two."
Sean M.,"Dublin, United States",432,474,621,4.0,4/1/2017,"Ok so I RARELY review chains, mainly because I try and avoid them as much as possible.  I have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in maybe 12 years or so and was hesitant. But, friends wanted to go and there are not a ton of family friendly options downtown SF. So, we went. First, the line was INSANE. Like 1.5 hours for a table. Not sure if it's regularly that bad or because it was holiday weekend. We got a table outside quicker because we were fine with it. We could suffer through the cold.  The menu is ridiculous. They have everything. And lots of it. We decided to go all in and eat junky. We had a few fried appetizers then decided on burgers and fries. We're vegetarian but they substituted veggie burgers into another burger combo with no problems. It was fantastically unhealthy food.  Feeling absolutely stuffed, we still got a slice of cheesecake which is the size of a full meal there!  I'd 100% go back if we were in sf and we're craving a spot like this. Great view of Union Square as well.  Great times and more than OK food!"
Donghyun L.,"Oakland Gardens, United States",7,6,,4.0,31/12/2016,"Although there were so many people and we had to wait more than an hour to be seated, we were able to leave our name and phone number and were told to come back later so that the waiting was not hard at all. The service was good and the food was pretty goos too. It was really comfortable to not have to wait in a line in front of the restaurant but instead were able to shop until it was our time to be seated"
Morgan M.,"Denver, United States",182,251,2071,4.0,31/12/2016,"This location is actually in Macy, it's very busy like every other one. We only waited 30 min for lunch on a Wednesday. Our server was friendly, service is kinda slow but not bad. The Chinese chicken salad was amazing and huge for the lunch portion, I can't imagine what the whole portion would be ! Pretty location ! It would be fun to sit outside and over look the city !"
Lynnae G.,"Oakland, United States",0,4,3,4.0,29/12/2016,"So I'm native to the Bay Area and it's no surprise that there is always a LONG wait here at the Cheesecake.   If you want a quick bite then this ISN'T the place to come. Show up with an appetite, the meals are huge. The wait time can be as long as 30min. -- 1hr45min so be prepared. Lastly, while waiting go visit Macy's downstairs or hang out at the Macy's Starbucks or Tout Sweet Cafe."
Oriana T.,"Dernancourt, Australia",10,19,,4.0,29/12/2016,"The line for a table was 2 hours long and the take away line was 30mins long, that's how you no a place is good! Got the original strawberry and the chocolate cheesecake! And by far the best cheesecake of my life! So creamy and soft and full of flavour! The only reason I give it a 4 is because the slices weren't overly big for what you pay but that's just me being greedy!"
Lola D.,"Concord, United States",18,10,27,4.0,23/12/2016,"Came in about a week ago on a Monday night...busy! Were told about 45 minute wait for a table for 2. Got a table at the bar while waiting. Ordered the avocado roll and burger (cooked medium-rare when asked for a medium). Lagunitas IPA could be a little colder. Can't help that it's so crowded and busy during the holidays. However, they played lovely Christmas songs and Christmas decorations were up. Nice and efficient staff Pros: Fun place to take out-of-town guests because of the spectacular view of Union Square Tip: Probably best to avoid during the holiday season and weekend evenings"
Rachel D.,"Cincinnati, United States",174,230,262,4.0,22/12/2016,"My boyfriend and I go to the Cheesecake Factory every year on our big holiday shopping day, and after a day on your feet hitting every store, the huge meal here is always a treat. Also nice, no matter what city you're in, you always know what you're going to get. I got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and he got the meatloaf. I'd probably stick with some of my favorites next time (shepherds pie, any burger, or the wasabi steak) but he was super happy with his meatloaf. We ended with the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake which was amazing!! Definitely would recommend! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is our waitress didn't bring us the brown bread with the oats on it, she only brought the sourdough (good, but the brown one is my favorite :)) will definitely be back!"
Diane H.,"San Francisco, United States",3,26,,4.0,10/12/2016,"Seriously over crowded but for a meal here during the holidays most restaurants are very busy.  Also, even with the massive crowds the service was done well and prompt. Food was pretty good.  Had the fried mac n cheese from a  previous reviewers suggestion and it was really good.  Very filling though.  Don't order a lot or you wont eat your meal. Will definitely go back after winter when I can enjoy that amazing view from the patio seating.  Was raining when we were there."
Naveen N.,"Midtown, Detroit, United States",7,348,,4.0,28/11/2016,Standard Cheesecake Factory menu. Waitstaff was friendly but very slow. Cheesecake was delicious.
Rachelle Y.,"San Francisco, United States",485,113,86,4.0,28/11/2016,"The usual spot to take all your friends visiting SF. It's in the heart of city, located inside Macy's on the top floor. As cheesy as that sounds, the menu is filled with your all-American generic food options with some variation. You can never go wrong with pasta, burgers, etc.  This place is pretty well known for their ""brown"" bread which is actually rye bread. Load up on some carbs prior to your entree, and you will have no room for cheesecake. Eat with caution.  Since their menu is ridiculously long and extensive, here are some common entree's I like to order in rotation: - Miso Salmon: a fat, juicy, teriyaki based filet of salmon resting on a bed of brown rice, surrounded by snow peas and miso sauce.  - Louisiana Chicken Pasta: a huge portion of bow tie pasta with a cajun kick of flavor, with crispy chicken tenders on top - Avocado Egg rolls: this appetizer can fill me up. Each egg roll is filled with a bite of soft avocado and can be dipped in a tangy tamarind sauce.  Mind you, all these portions are HUGE. They really emphasize on family style portions.  In terms of dessert, how can you visit the Cheesecake Factory without having cheesecake? It would be a sin not to share a slice. My personal favorites are: - The 30th Anniversary: CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH FUDGE AND CHEESECAKE. C'mon.. It's the best of both worlds. - White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: It has a little fruit in it so it HAS to be a little healthy.. Ammiright?!  I refuse to try any other cheesecake. I'm loyal to my soil. Wait time can be long, just because it's located in the middle of Union Square. Enjoy the seating outside, and bask in the SF weather. The Cheesecake Factory will always have a special place in my heart."
