Adrienne B.,"San Mateo, United States",108,23,452,4.0,17/11/2016,"Everything on their menu is absolutely amazing.  My favorite dish here is the Thai Glazed Salmon.  It's probably the best salmon dish that I've ever ordered from any restaurant.  But, of course, given their name, I also LOVE their cheesecake.  I just had their Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake this past weekend.  I should warn you though: this place gets packed! And I can see why.  The ambiance is great, the food is great, the service is great too.  However, I had to deduct one star for no phone reservations.  You have to make you reservation there in person.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Just make sure you have a lot of time on your hands.  It's definitely worth the wait!"
Noah W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,4.0,14/11/2016,"The quality of the food is good, so as the services. It would had been five star if it wasn't for the prolong waiting...luckily there are so many places for shopping nearby to distract my empty stomach. Lol"
Caroline P.,"Berkeley, United States",53,84,323,4.0,1/11/2016,"We were here on Sunday evening. The place was nice, as we remembered from the last time we ate there, 2 years ago. We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table.  The menu was really appealing and I was torn between a few options. The crispy chicken costolleta was really good and well cooked. It came with 5 green asparagus and a bunch of french fries (I asked for a substitution as it comes with mashed potatoes on the menu and it came with no charge). The chicken was crispy as expected and the lemon sauce was really good. Asparagus were pretty good too and still crunchy as I like them. Fries were okay, a bit cold. The service was nice, our waiter was really nice and helpful. My husband went for the veggie burger and was quite happy with it too.  We then ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to share, we ate it too fast to even snap a picture :-)  While waiting we enjoyed the view on Union Square (and its holiday ice rink opening tomorrow). I'll have to come back to try the Evelyn's favorite pasta :p And maybe another kind of cheesecake (I'll have to decide between chocolate hazelnut, mango key lime ou dutch apple caramel... Tough choice)."
Gigi E.,"Danville, United States",13,9,,4.0,24/10/2016,"Compared to the Stoneridge and the Walnut Creek locations, the food is equally as delicious, but the view was more amazing. Being on the top floor of Macy's, it overlooks Union Square and has a good view of the surrounding shops and streets as well. The food was great, as always, with the cheesy pastas and the exceptional cheesecakes(the Godiva ones especially). Great place to dine with family and friends!"
Mankiran K.,"Sacramento, United States",0,2,,4.0,20/10/2016,Best Cheescake factory I've been to! Food came out quickly and was super delicious. And our waitress was very attentive. You can't beat the views.
Fa R.,"Montreal, Canada",25,278,549,4.0,14/10/2016,"I've been coming here for many years and always liked it. Not high gastronomy for sure but many good things: -beautiful roof terrasse over Macy's with a lovely Union Square view.  -Great cheesecakes, dozens flavours to choose from -great healthy menu available  -nice waiters/hostesses  -fair prices -great lunch deals I love the pumpkin cheesecake. They now also have a red velvet one but haven't tried it yet."
Marco C.,"Gilroy, United States",9,41,91,4.0,25/9/2016,"2 out of the 3 dishes we order were great, one will be the last time I order that(chicken jambalaya with shrimp  aka spicy) not so spicy and it was not that flavorful.. other then that try the egg roll sampler so good."
Jess M.,"Los Angeles, United States",20,94,15,4.0,19/9/2016,"Waited for 30 min for our table around 5:30 pm. The place was super busy, so we didn't mind the wait. Easily got some seats at the bar to ride us over. The outside terrace was great, and gave us a perfect view of the USC marching band rally! Service was a little slow, but nothing too unbearable. I got the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was delicious, and my friends loved the Steak Diane! I loved that we could request a ""window"" table on the terrace overlooking Union Square!"
Kenny L.,"Newark, United States",2,9,1,4.0,15/9/2016,"One of my favorite places to go to whenever I'm in the city. The wait can be crazy but I also find my self coming back. Food is delicious, service is nice, and the view outside of the balcony is great too."
Karan N.,"St. John's, Canada",4,30,55,4.0,5/9/2016,"This is the type of restaurant you go to, to say you went there. It's a chain restaurant with a rich history in of course, cheesecakes. I went there for lunch today and it certainly met my expectations.  Firstly, they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. The wait for lunch was around 20-25 mins, whereas the wait for dinner is around 60-90 mins.  It's a really busy restaurant with mostly tourists eating there. It has a busy atmosphere, but has a nice vibe. Our waiter was really friendly and the service was great. Prices are quite reasonable and the Cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had."
David P.,"San Francisco, United States",63,9,4,4.0,28/8/2016,"We went at this Cheese Cake Factory for my past birthday and I really enjoyed my experience. I only took an appetizer of Chiken Wings but that was necessary to be able to eat one of these amazing cheese cake. Staff was OK, ours wasn't even able to open our wine bottle but honestly, he was really chill in general. We had a good experience at this cheesecake factory."
Kam L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,18,59,4.0,16/8/2016,"went here for lunch at 12:30 with a friend. we were able to easily get seats at the bar. we were served by ashmini who was super kind and attentive. she was friendly and wonderful company. i told my friend i wanted to give her a hug after; he said i probably shouldnt do that haha. we ordered the egg roll sampler and the bang bang shrimp along with some sangria. the sangria was surprisingly strong. the egg roll sampler was ashmini's recommendation and a good one at that! a nice tasting of four different rolls. the bang bang shrimp needs a different batter- perhaps panko- also got a little soggy, too much sauce. we also shared a caramel cheesecake that was devine."
Suzette C.,"Fairfield, United States",56,83,715,4.0,7/8/2016,"We were all hungry after checking out my sister's Academy of Arts Pre-College summer program exhibit. Out of all the places to savor my little sister chose the Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend parking in a garage (prices range from different businesses) and walking to this location or taking the bart. Parking on the streets in the city can be hard to find. Go exploring after to get your money's worth!  This restaurant is located inside Macy's right where Union Square is. On a Saturday around 1 pm we waited 30 minutes for our outdoor table. Keep in mind you are in San Francisco and in the middle of an endless shopping area. It wasn't a surprise there was a wait. One of the wonderful things that I love about going to the city is listening to the background of tourists who are ecstatic to be here in San Francisco :). It makes waiting more entertaining!  I appreciated the fact that our waiters were still attentive and would ask us if we needed anything else throughout our lunch despite it being busy. Great customer service! Also the dining place itself was very clean and tables were immediately bused when customers left. At chains like the Cheesecake Factory, I tend to order what I know is good and stick with it.  What I recommend: Americana Cheeseburger ($13.95) - This burger consists of American/cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, and secret sauce. A moist burger with ingredients that may seem basic, but coexist to leave you deliciously satisfied until the last mouthful. I find that this entree can be lovingly shared between two people.  Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake- Ever find yourself thinking that your eating cake when your at the Cheesecake Factory? This one is a CLOUD in your mouth compared to some of the flavors that are offered on the menu. The caramel cheesecake isn't taxingly sweet. The caramel mousse and vanilla crust only enhances this simple recipe without overwhelming you and your stomach! Overall this place makes me a pleased customer! I would come back here for a future lunch or dinner."
Jaryl C.,"Singapore, Singapore",2,2,3,4.0,4/7/2016,"The wait times are incredibly long (about an hour and a half), but they do provide a wireless finger which guests on the waiting list can carry around the mall as they shop and buzz them when it is their turn. The entrees also did take around half an hour to prepare, I had the Pasta Carbonara and it was pretty good. My group and I had 5 cheese cake and they all tasted really good. Especially the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Quite happy with my experience if I overlook the long waiting times."
Yordano R.,"Hayward, United States",290,39,3,4.0,2/7/2016,"Michael at the bar it's amazing, please give him a raise . All bartenders are good but Michael will def.  spice try night up..."
Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, United States",223,56,79,4.0,30/6/2016,"Looking for a solid chain restaurant near Union Square? Well fear not! The Cheesecake Factory is here! I know, I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory, nothing really to get all excited about. But my experience this time was actually very decent. The ambiance of the place is pretty neat. You have a nice marble floor, the craziest view of Union Square above Macy's, and if you don't want to eat outside (which we elected not to in order to avoid pesky pigeon poop) you can be seated at these cute little wooden booths.  Our waiter was very nice and caring. A kid at our party is allergic to eggs, thus we asked the waiter to separate the buns and the patties of the sliders that we ordered. He readily complied. What a chum. We ordered a Lunch Special Famous Factory Meat Loaf, Lunch Special Shepard's pie, Fried Calamari, Sweet Potato Fries, sliders, fried chicken. I personally had the lunch meat loaf as I had the Shepard's pie before. The waiter asked if we wanted bread, and I highly suggest that you don't miss out on it. They give you three bread sticks--two rye and one French bread with lots of butter packs. I'm a sucker for bread, and this bread wasn't bad. CALAMARI (~$16.50): Decent, they give you a decent amount for ~$16.50 along with two dips--cocktail sauce and garlic sauce. Good effort. SWEET POTATO FRIES (~$12.50): I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these were solid. LUNCH SPECIAL FAMOUS FACTORY MEAT LOAF (~$13.50): My main dish. They give you two SIZABLE slices topped with onions and sided with succotash and mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. The meatloaf was decent, but had a tad too much rosemary flavor it to. After consuming the calamari, sweet potato fries, and the bread, this was too much for me to finish and I took half of it home.  LUNCH SPECIAL SHEPARD'S PIE (~$13.50): My favorite of all the dishes I sampled--the ground beef topped with mash potatoes was a wonder to behold. I could eat something like that all day. Sure, it's a simple meal, but the amount was HUGE and it was very tasty.  FRIED CHICKEN (~$13.50): The fried chicken was OK, it wasn't all flour like the frozen Tyson chicken you get at the frozen section of the local supermarket, and the meat was surprisingly moist. :) TASTE: 4 stars--portions are good, food is surprisingly decent. SERVICE: 3 stars--they didn't refill our water. That's a boo boo. But the waiter took care of my demands. AMBIANCE: 5 stars--nice view and beautiful interior. PRICE: 4 stars--it's a solid price for a lot of food. TOTAL: 4 stars--I'd come here again. Bottom Line: THE FOOD IS SOLID. The ambiance is nice. I wanna bring my date here next time. Heck, I might just bring myself."
Fi M.,"San Francisco, United States",15,99,2,4.0,8/6/2016,"We really didn't know what to expect of our first visit to the Cheesecake Factory, but after our long and fairly chaotic wait for a table and a fri, we actually had a great time. We weren't exactly expecting gourmet cuisine (& it certainly wasn't) but it was okay grub at an okay price. Better than the dreadful Olive Garden. My bf loved the cheesecake we tried for dessert too (although I thought they were pretty pricey!). I think he could coax me back."
Joy W.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, United States",187,441,2629,4.0,5/5/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory at this location is known for its long wait times, balcony view of Union Square, and of course their cheesecake. If you just want to try the cheesecake, skip the wait and just order it to go at the display case. They come in single servings too.  If you do decide to take the elevator to the top floor of Macy's and the escalator to the restaurant for a meal, don't be too deterred by the wait. You can hang out on the beds and couches in Macy's furniture section until your beeper goes off.  The restaurant itself is quite nice with murals and columns. There are lots of booths and a bar inside. The balcony overlooking Geary St. is also a nice way to enjoy a meal.  How about the food? The cheesecake is not bad and the list is extensive, but I'm not a cheesecake lover. The rest of the menu is very overwhelming, as are most chain restaurant menus that aim to have an all-encompassing and somewhat confusing selection.  The last time I dined here, the wait wasn't long at all. It was a very warm day, so the mai tai & the mojito tasted refreshing. The bread was fresh and fluffy.  Seared Tuna Tataki Salad - lightly seared ahi, with avocado, tomato and mixed greens, w/ wasabi vinaigrette: The bright red tuna was seasoned well with sesame seeds seared onto the surface.  Grilled Rib-Eye Steak: It's probably not rib-eye, but it did have beautiful grill marks. It cut well, and was actually pretty juicy. Banana Cream Cheesecake - topped w/ Bavarian cream & bananas: I'm not a cheesecake lover as I usually find it too dense for me, but I do like banana cream desserts. The banana slices and the banana cream were smooth enough to balance out the dense-ness of the cheesecake.  Compared to most chain restaurants or department store restaurants, I think Cheesecake Factory is A-ok. I think the ambience bumps this location up a notch. I admit I never crave a meal from the Cheesecake Factory and none of the dishes really stand out to me, but I do think it is a decent option in this area when the wait isn't too long. Considering the ridiculous wait times, I can't understand why they don't take reservations."
Mark D.,"San Francisco, United States",3,7,3,4.0,5/5/2016,Best tourist area to eat at and especially the food and servants are always nice.
Yikai L.,"New York, United States",91,331,504,4.0,3/5/2016,"Pasta quite yummy, and a perfect cheesecake would light my night!"
