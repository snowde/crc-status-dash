Will L.,"Pasadena, United States",51,91,71,4.0,1/5/2016,"Why on earth would I give a Cheesecake Factory five stars. Well when you can sit perched on top of SF union square on a warm day and eat like a true American with oversized entrees and drinks, what's not to love.  Fact: the union square cheesecake is the second highest grossing cheesecake in the nation, so it will be packed no matter what time you go. Be prepared or grab a spot at the bar where there's pretty good turnover.  I'm not going to give a recount of everything I've eaten there but know they have a new kale quinoa salad (the bigger one of the two) that is delicious. It's a great pairing with the buffalo chicken bites.  Wash that down with a cocktail of your choice in a classic Cheesecake Factory glass and you're in business.  Pro tips: Park across the street under the park. It's reasonable. And the patio seating is worth the wait."
Jeff S.,"San Francisco, United States",40,12,50,4.0,30/4/2016,"My favorites are Hibachi Steak and Crab bites. Taste is always excellent! But in a slow night, I still get some delayed services. Anyway, I'll keep coming back here because of tastes of the foods."
Chinda O.,"Oakland, United States",249,42,105,4.0,20/4/2016,"I came here because my significant other wanted to eat the food he haven't had in a while. The food here is always good but he complained that it wasn't as good as how it use to be. I could care less on how it use to be just as long as the entrees have good flavors, but I do agree that this place could use some happier waiters."
Steve G.,"San Pedro, United States",127,2,10,4.0,10/4/2016,Nice place to unwind and watch pigeons attack leftovers on the outside patio. Attentive staff who brought us mimosas quickly. A lot of rude customers who need to stay home
Audrey L.,"Bukit Timah, Singapore, Singapore",436,798,1122,4.0,29/3/2016,"Four stars for the bruléed french toast, which is served only during brunch on Sundays. This french toast was surprisingly crispy and well cooked -- just enough egg, but not too much to be soggy. Just enough powdered sugar to add that sweetness. The syrup is served on the side so you can add to your liking. Of course, you can't go wrong with torching a bit of sugar on the surface of the toast. Wow, they weren't kidding when they said this is the ""best"" french toast ever."
Sean F.,"Emeryville, United States",52,13,,4.0,28/3/2016,"Came here for the first time this evening. Sat at the bar because the place was absurdly busy. Robert M was our bartender. Despite being extreeeeemely busy and my food having to be sent back twice, Robert remained on point the entire time and was able to fix it in a timely manner. It's entertaining to watch this guy when the bar is crazy busy. He gets it done! I recommend coming in to see him if you stop by! Excellent service."
Diana F.,"San Francisco, United States",95,62,29,4.0,26/3/2016,"Eating at the Cheesecake Factory in downtown SF is a must-do on most visitor's lists. It is very iconic in that this Cheesecake Factory is located at the top level of Macy's in the heart of downtown SF and it overlooks Union Square. If it's not too chilly/windy, I'd recommend trying to sit outside because that gives you a direct overlook of Union Square. This location does not take reservations and you have to talk to the hostess directly in order to be put on the waiting list. You can call ahead to ask what their estimated wait time would be, but keep in mind this can change very quickly. When you arrive and give your name to the hostess, you will be given a buzzer which will vibrate when your table is ready. While you are waiting, feel free to take the escalators down 1 floor to the furniture section of Macy's and relax on some of their couches. The buzzer will still have a signal on that floor. Their food tastes just like any other Cheesecake Factory that I've been to, but it is a nice feeling dining in downtown SF."
Ras U.,"Paris, France",271,184,225,4.0,18/3/2016,I would eat here all the time I would only get one thing the four cheese pasta with no chicken and no basil. Every time I would get a four cheese pasta with chicken and basil. I went here on Valentines day and I ordered my pasta as usual and the mistake was made again. They took it back and gave me new one. I ate about 70% of the food and found a piece of chicken in the pasta. My meal was comped and they gave us a cheesecake but I rather pay and get the right meal.
Diane T.,"San Jose, United States",0,44,2,4.0,13/3/2016,"I took my friend here last month and our first experience was good. The only thing that keeps me from saying it was great is that the wait was extremely long, it was crowded and loud, and drinks were super expensive! The bread they served wasn't fresh. I was also pretty disappointed, because we didn't get seats outside to see the nice view on top floor... But other than that, the service was very friendly and professional! I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp and everything tasted delicious for the most part. Definitely recommend going to this place if you're around SF."
Alex D.,"Bakersfield, United States",1,15,3,4.0,7/3/2016,We ordered spicy chicken nachos and and Louisiana chicken pasta.. Nachos were extremely good pasta was OK service was great food was OK at the end so I ordered an additional slice of cheesecake Terra masseuse and oh my God best thing ever... Also for the food arrived fairly quick so I was not waiting for too long
Essie K.,"San Diego, United States",68,500,254,4.0,27/2/2016,"I decided to grab lunch at the Cheesecake Factory with a friend. It's located at the top of the Macy's building in Union Square. They have an elevator to the right at the entrance that takes you straight up to the restaurant.  The restaurant is pretty big but they always seem to be busy. Given it was a nice sunny day, we opted to sit in the outdoor patio area. A must if the weather is good! The patio overlooks Union Square. Though it wasn't overly crowded, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and it took another 15 minutes to order our food. Overall the food quality is worth 3 stars. It's just average American food- not terrible but nothing special. It's nice that they have a large selection of entrees so everyone has something to eat (even a skinny menu for those who are on a diet or want to eat healthier). The beautiful view bumped up the rating to 4 stars.  Love the complimentary bread basket with butter and if you have room left at the end, you should try their assortment of cheesecakes.  Definitely a tourist attraction and come semi-hungry because you'll be waiting for a while."
Emmylou R.,"Temecula, United States",63,67,170,4.0,27/2/2016,I usually like most foods on their menu but their chicken mushroom lettuce wraps was just too salty
Santos V.,"Berkeley, United States",97,26,6,4.0,22/2/2016,"This place is great. The view is epic (get seated outside)! I really enjoy their food and their somewhat attentive staff.  I've come here around 5 times and there's only two things that really can get in the way.  1) They don't take reservations but they're still busy most of the time! This doesn't make sense when they don't even have a general waiting area. Prepare to sit on the floor or leave for a while. 2) That is where another issue arose. They have one elevator (with a ridiculously low capacity) to lift/lower 8+ floors. Not to mention they don't have accessible stairs! This slow elevator is literally the only way to leave the place. 100+ people, one elevator, 8+ floors, with 10 people leaving at a time...  If the place doesn't catch on fire or you manage to survive one anyways, you'll probably have a great time looking over the square. The food is good and the dessert even better! Try it if you're not in a hurry."
Grace C.,"Richmond, United States",6,81,407,4.0,17/2/2016,"Like it a lot! Food, service, location, price are all above standard! The only thing is the music is too loud, I can only hear myself but no one else."
Lynette P.,"San Francisco, United States",135,9,1,4.0,16/2/2016,Good food but the greatest thing here is the garlic bread with cheese!! OMG!! I go there just to have that amazing bread!
Icy H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,1,4.0,26/1/2016,"Good cheesecake and large portions, but there's always a wait at this location. My favorite is thai lettuce wraps and strawberry cheesecake."
Bekka L.,"Monterey, United States",4,39,3,4.0,21/1/2016,"I insisted on going here while in the city.  The food is always good, service is great and the view off of the patio is awesome.  They had the heaters up, so it wasn't too cold.  Great portions on the food and we got seated rather quickly (about a 10 minute wait).  My ONLY complaint is about the pigeons.  I know I know, they are the pet bird of SF, but boy, are they bold and apparently addicted to cheesecake.  It's a wonder they aren't fatter.  The waiters do a pretty good job of shooing them away, but it seems like something could be added to keep them off of the tables.  Maybe some of those owls sitting around in obvious spots?  I don't know... but if you don't want to eat with wildlife fluttering over and on your table, you might want to eat indoors.  I will eat here again the next time I'm in the city... but definitely going to ask for an indoor seat."
Chris L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,48,15,4.0,20/1/2016,"I actually had a very good service experience here and the food was solid.  It wasn't amazing but the service made up for it.  We had a burger and pasta which wasn't anything fancy but everything came fresh and executed perfectly.  I actually would go back because of the service, great location and view from the roof.  My expectations were not high and was satisfied with what I paid for.  I would absolutely recommend others for a solid dining experience."
Amanda B.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",72,126,158,4.0,20/1/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. It took me about 10 minutes to get a table (in a weekday!). While I was waiting I choose what I wanted to eat, so, when I got to the table the waitress came quickly and I ordered a Caesar Salad with chicken. That was the biggest salad I've even seen in my life! Really, I could easily have shared it with 3 more people. Obviously, I couldn't eat all of it and I still needed space in my stomach for the cheesecake!  I ordered the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake, which is delicious! I'll probably go back there before I leave San Francisco. It's a lovely place, nice ambience, but prices are a little expensive. However, if you're going only for the Cheesecake, I think it's worth it."
Millie E.,"Stockton, United States",21,28,46,4.0,16/1/2016,"This review would have had 5 stars if our outdoor heater was working but we were seated by one that was broken -_- Besides that, my boyfriend and I were in the city for the weekend for our anniversary and this dinner was by far the best food wise that weekend. We both got steak dishes. Both were cooked perfectly medium and my ceasar salad was amazing as always here. Funny thing is we had dinner the night before at Scoma's and paid $95 which for the price wasn't as worth it as compared to our meal at cheesecake factory :) So 2 thumbs up here! (Just please Oh please fix that outdoor heater to the far left. Sitting outside in January is a bit nippy) :)"
