Jennifer K.,"San Francisco, United States",4,26,1,4.0,13/1/2016,"This is my guilty pleasure restaurant. You know, one that you secretly love but don't tell anyone that you do because everyone seems to think this belongs in the Better-Than-Sizzler-But-You-Can-Do-So-Much-Better list of restaurants (BJ's and Outback included in that list). I've had some great experiences here and some okay experiences. My favorite entree is always the Pasta Da Vinci. I like my pasta like I like my friends - saucy. Sometimes my pasta is too dry, and sometimes it's soaking with Madeira wine sauce. I personally prefer the latter. Their crab and artichoke dip is AMAZING and I will always go for their red velvet cheesecake. Crab cakes are a hit or miss, but a little too pricey for me take that risk often."
MrsFrank H.,"Elk Grove, United States",26,26,20,4.0,11/1/2016,Had the pleasure of being seated outside. The view is amazing. They had heaters. The food was good and of course the cheesecake was amazing
Jasmine C.,"Menifee, United States",311,52,99,4.0,2/1/2016,My boyfriend and I arrived right when they opened at 11am. This is the perfect time to go especially if you want a good seat with the view. Don't hesitate to sit outside because they have heaters surrounding you all around. Service was quick and they were so nice. Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and Kobe Burger. Both orders were great in portions.
jiopkly Y.,"Oakland, United States",118,42,4,4.0,26/12/2015,"As you had may notice 'Cheesecake Factory' is famous of their cheesecake. Which I have to highly agree, but I did have better cheesecake in the past. Beside that, the food is really good and I do love the atmosphere which they install. One of the food I would recommend you to try is ""Artichoke with crab cake"". A great dish to match with any type of salad you prefer.  Beside the food, the service was great and have well attended manner."
David G.,"Seattle, United States",97,35,3,4.0,21/12/2015,"If you've ever tried to find a restaurant in Union Square, you know what a zoo it can be.  We had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macys.  Fantastic views, even in the rain.  Great patio when it's nicer out.  The elevator going up opens at 11:00 am and is usually backed up with people.  I recommend taking the escalator up as far as the 6th floor then taking the other elevator up to the 7th.  You will be the first in line!  Anyway, the food was so/so but what a selection!  Pizza, sandwiches, salads, chicken dishes, breakfast and of course, cheesecakes.  I opted for the omelet which was just okay but a fun experience anyway.  Try something different and enjoy the views."
Epi S.,"Burlingame, United States",0,16,21,4.0,17/12/2015,We went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. This place is crazy busy and we waited for 45-50mins for a table of two. Service was fast and our waitress was very pleasant. Ms.Tania was kind enough to get me another pina colada when I told her that there wasn't enough alcohol in my drink. We waited for a table outside and it was worth the way. Tasty food and plenty variety of food. Thank you Tania for the great service & Happy Holidays!
Christian I.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,4.0,13/12/2015,I only got cheese cake but it was super good and the view from outside sitting was beautiful. There was a long wait and really crowded but it was worth it.
Katie C.,"San Diego, United States",105,135,122,4.0,9/12/2015,"With downtown SF in full Christmas mode, I knew I had to see the sparkling white lights, wreaths, ribbons, and trees for myself. We arrived at the restaurant with hopes that we could be seated on the balcony and be able to see the activities and decorations below. Unfortunately, it was a chilly night and we opted for indoor seating.  We ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (my go to) and bang bang chicken and shrimp. The chipotle gave the pasta dish a nice tasty kick and the chicken was well portioned in the dish. The meal was so delicious and filling that I, unfortunately, had no room for cheesecake.  The restaurant is in a prime location and is, to no one's surprised, overwhelmed with guests. While other parties were frequently checked upon, our server was nowhere to be seen from the time our order was taken and the time our meal was over. When she dropped the check off at our table, the highest suggested tip was circled. I found this action rude based on her absence."
Katie H.,"Fletcher, United States",0,4,,4.0,11/11/2015,"It's a very good place.  The view is beautiful.  We can see the downtown from the terrace.  There are many different cheesecake choices.  It's expensive, but the cheesecakes are very good and it's excellent quality.  People can buy a piece of cake or the cakes for 6-8 people.  It's wonderful for a birthday.  The waiters are very nice too!"
Aldrin C.,"Las Vegas, United States",155,20,6,4.0,8/11/2015,Just be prepared to wait about 45 min to get a table. But let me tell you it was worth the wait for a good food! And experience! My service was the best! Great customer service experience.
John B.,"Stony Stratford, United Kingdom",0,15,1,4.0,20/10/2015,"So my second time in a week at this place and I've deducted a star. The food is still great and the staff are nice, even if they did get the order slightly wrong. However, the queuing thing was a bit of a joke today. When it was rammed at the weekend and there was a long wait, the delays made sense. Today, ten of the twelve tables in the outside roof terrace were empty and the inside was a ghost town. We still had to wait ten minutes to be seated on the terrace. Why? There were servers available. There was a full complement of kitchen staff (you can see them) so why did we have to wait? It's almost as though even if we were the only customers, we would still be made to wait. Very bizarre. On the positive, food good."
Melissa B.,"San Diego, United States",6,5,,4.0,18/10/2015,"We only sat at the bar, our Spicy cashew chicken was extra spicy tonight. Love our bartender Gabrielle!!!!! We came here twice during our stay in SF and she was our bartender both times. See her, she's awesome!!!!!!!!"
Joanne R.,"Eden Prairie, United States",2,41,,4.0,13/10/2015,Beautiful view on a clear night. Husband had the Chicken DaVinci and I had the Skinnylicious salmon with steamed vegetables. We split a limoncello dessert. As usual the food was great. Only downside was the hour wait.
Annette S.,"San Francisco, United States",33,155,61,4.0,12/10/2015,"I know this place is subpar for most but I love it here cause I always know what I'm gonna get. I always get salads and I'm never disappointed, which I love most about this place. And who doesn't like warm bread and butter to start, despite the fact it's too filling. I've never had bad service here either which is always a plus.  Oh and I've also never had bad cheesecake either, but is there such a thing?"
JustinE Y.,"San Francisco, United States",126,100,410,4.0,12/10/2015,"Busy and touristy spot for sure but I still like to visit here once a while.  Outside heated patio with union square view. Blend Pina Colada drinks are right on our spot. Sweet desserts style are just too good to resist. Portion just like all the chain restaurant, BIG! I couldn't finish an entree by myself.  Good place for party and family celebration!"
Jordan B.,"Vallejo, United States",52,305,471,4.0,10/10/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is nice but super crowded !! Ordered jambalaya and the cucumber lemonade, yum! Our waitress was very nice; if you go Saturday night be prepared to wait two hours. Awesome view outside on the balcony of the city and union square."
Eric P.,"Oakland, United States",3,113,30,4.0,7/10/2015,Yummy.  The only danger is overeating. I get indigestion when info here because I eat too much of my own food me then ate dessert too.  Nice clean bathrooms with beautiful fixtures and architecture.  I love the Oreo cheesecake.
PJ T.,"Daly City, United States",19,129,273,4.0,4/10/2015,you go the view and the cheesecake.  everything is what you expect from the factory.  we went at Saturday for lunch (2pm).  elevator from the ground floor take you all the way to the top.  Little wait for the patio.  only 15-20 minutes.  not bad.
Nando G.,"Placerville, United States",0,12,16,4.0,29/9/2015,Great location. Nice ambience and friendly staff. Food is good and portions are pretty generous. Prices are very reasonable given their large portions and their awesome location
Josh H.,"San Francisco, United States",201,71,655,4.0,27/9/2015,"What can you say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been uttered a thousand times over? The place has amazing views from the patio over looking Union Square park, there is more on the menu then you will find in an entire food court at most malls. And the staff is always dressed head to toe in white to show how they have somehow managed not to spill anything on themselves throughout their shift.  Came here with a couple of co-workers for lunch and I was stunned to hear that it was their first time inside of the place. There was a long line to get up to the counter to receive a buzzer for a table so we worked our way over to the bar and took a seat. The bartender who greeted us was more than accommodating and asked if he could start us with something to drink. I knew what I was after since I was going to pair my beverage with my dish, and I was thinking Cuban sandwich the entire way there so you know I had to go with a Mojito.  Now the hard decision to make www which mojito to get, I usually go with the Pineapple since it screams the essence of equator living. I ordered one for myself and told my lunch mates that they should follow suit. The bartender offered his suggestion of Blueberry Mojitos for them since they had never tried them and it was now time to sit back and watch him do his thing. After a few shakes and a perfect pour we were ready to enjoy the deliciousness that is a Mojito.  We were passed our menu's and it was a kick to watch the faces of my co-workers as they flipped through the book (yes, it is thicker than some Daniele Steele novels) to see what they could possibly get themselves into. Page after page is packed full of every thinkable type of food from Asian to French back to Classic fav's such as mini Corndogs...  We placed our orders for a couple of Cuban sandwiches as well as a couple of appetizers and watched a lil sports on the tv mounted above the bar and waited for our grub to arrive. Within 15 minutes we were gorging ourselves on our delectable delights. The Cuban sandwich is pretty respectable and is pretty close to the real thing. It's my go to when I come and I will probably be back for another soon enough. Before taking off we had to get a refresh on drinks and then we settled up and got outta dodge before we started seeing double.  Oh yeah... They have a nice choice of Cheesecake slices available as well, if that's what you thought this place was all about."
