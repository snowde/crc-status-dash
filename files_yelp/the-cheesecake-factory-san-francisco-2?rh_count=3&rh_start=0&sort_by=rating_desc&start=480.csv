Joyeta S.,"San Francisco, United States",255,78,52,4.0,23/9/2015,Cheesecake Factory I have been going to for 5 years. It's awesome for the ambience and the cheesecake. Most of the entrees are good too. You have to know what to pick though. I love the Thai glazed salmon which is not on the menu. I also like chicken Madeira. It's a good time to go there with a bunch of people in your party.
Christina C.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, United States",211,268,174,4.0,11/9/2015,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory almost my whole life. I loved it as a kid. Then I realized the foodie movement had brought way more interesting restaurants my way...but it's still pretty good. I have to eat gluten free (Celiac) and they recently got a menu for me! But I haven't tried it yet to be honest. I came here recently for gluten free cheesecake!!!! The best part of the cheesecake factory to be honest, come on. The only gf option is the Ghiradelli chocolate cheescake...OMG! It was SO rich but also SO good! I had to stop myself after 3-4 bites because it was too much. So glad to have a gf cheesecake option here!  Also, this location is crazy busy. We came here around 10pm, and there was still about an hour wait for 4 people...what!! We decided to buy cheesecake at the bar and take it to the park across the street. Much better."
Jacob S.,"San Francisco, United States",21,10,8,4.0,7/9/2015,"30th Anniversary cheesecake is so sweet, Mango key lime highly recommend and it taste fresh and not so sweet.  This is my first time to eat there, restroom was awful, but serves were very impressive. Love it!"
Mat U.,"Hayward, United States",1,11,,4.0,17/8/2015,"Normally don't have the patience hence I get a to go order. It's the second time that I had their kaluha cheese cake, Oreo and mango. The Kalhua is paired very well and is awesome. Must try once."
Gilbert C.,"Los Angeles, United States",32,18,15,4.0,14/8/2015,When we got to the restaurant there was an hours wait for a table. We opted to wait and share a table in the bar and were served and out of there is under the hour. Food choices are vast and size is big as well so we opted to share a dinner between the two of us. Same for the dessert and we were both full so good choice.
Cindee T.,"San Mateo, United States",44,221,487,4.0,11/8/2015,"Expect to queue. Worth the wait and visit. My third visit to Cheesecake Factory in the city. Enjoyed every single visit - at least for the food. Visited at mid day with two overseas guests, wait was approx 20mins, the shortest of the three visits that I had.  We were seated promptly but the server took years to come by. Was the least friendly and inattentive server I have met at Cheesecake Factory. Ordered onion rings, Vietnamese rolls, red velvet cheesecake and 2 other cheesecakes which I can't recall right now. The food as usual were yummy. The Vietnamese rolls are not the authentic Vietnamese roll but they tasted fine. The onion rings were super good.  The cheesecakes were of course the main highlight. My guests were overwhelmed with the options available and were so torn having to choose three out of the entire list.  All the cheesecake tasted fantastic. Key Lime Cheesecake is my ultimate favorite among the list. Definitely worth visiting and worth the wait. Try to visit during mid day might help to shave off some wait time."
Zoë B.,"Lafayette, United States",28,5,1,4.0,10/8/2015,"Service was good for a busy night, but we waited for an hour to be seated outside and then a seagull watched us eat for our whole meal. It was more than a bit unnerving."
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, United States",395,752,957,4.0,5/8/2015,Traffic to get here? Absolutely terrible. Wait times for a dinner table? Absolutely way too long (think 30-90 minutes) Prices? Absolutely overpriced. Why do I continue to come here time after time as I get older? I have no idea. Maybe it's because of the complimentary brown oat bread and the cheesecake...
Nicky V.,"San Francisco, United States",115,46,13,4.0,29/7/2015,"I give 4 stars due the location. As an SF native I enjoy the convenience of good food and a great ambiance whether it be for date night, meeting friends, or showing family from out of town a nice lunch. I enjoy the brunch menu it is very good, All in all I've eaten (over 20) I have never had a bad experience food or service wise"
Judy Y.,"Davis, United States",114,22,49,4.0,28/7/2015,"I love the cheesecake in here, and I also love the pastas. However, the steak for the meals isn't as good as why I excepted. The decoration of the restaurant is very fancy. I came to celebrating my birthday, and I have to tell that the waitresses are nice because they sang birthday song while the cheesecake was ready to serve. So sweet of them :)"
Chantille T.,"Richmond, United States",264,52,246,4.0,24/7/2015,"4 stars for the beloved Cheesecake Factory in Union Square! Food always amazing and the atmosphere just as great. The wait: Usually takes longer than 30 minutes with assumption time expectancy for 20 minutes but surprisingly the wait was just fine and expected. Plus I knew the host so we were seated quite quick.  Service: Our waitress was quick with her mouth but not quick enough with our food. We started off with a couple of appetizers, the Fried Zucchini and Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. We asked for bread and didn't come until 10 minutes later. Our waitress was quite forgetful too. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya and my friend ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza. Wrong sliders came out, but no problem, everyone makes mistakes but I suggested to add the Stuffed Mushrooms and our waitress questioned my choice of quantity of appetizers. So I just refused and didn't order it. Throughout our dinner, she kept asking me if I still wanted to order the Stuffed Mushrooms and I said no. Once we got the check, the waitress checked off the amount she should be tipped.  Food overall: Always amazing and I will always recommend the place!"
Ericka M.,"Lakeshore, San Francisco, United States",18,40,20,4.0,20/7/2015,"Long waits yes, but what do you expect when it doesn't take reservations? Very solid food, when it comes to it being a chain restaurant. A friend who was visiting from Australia and I walked in, we waited maybe 30 min max, before we were seated. We ordered guacamole to start and it arrived quickly. She had the eggs with potatoes & toast, and I had the chicken di Pana, both were nothing short of delicious. There were no service issues, and the food was delicious. See you again sometime !"
Shannon Z.,"Huntington Beach, United States",522,36,95,4.0,13/7/2015,"First off, if you come here you have to sit outside on the patio. The view is amazing. Anyways when I stopped by here I came expecting to get the fried mac n cheese as my appetizer and the meatloaf as my entree. Unfortunately they were out of both so I got the ahi carpaccio appetizer and spaghetti. The ahi was excellent and well seasoned but the spaghetti was significantly undercooked. Our waitress was very sympathetic and quickly got me a new plate. I could tell she felt bad about the multiple inconveniences. For dessert I got the godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was delicious. I'm a sucker for anything rich and sickeningly sweet. My overall experience was not unpleasant but I was bummed they didn't have some of my favorite items. Maybe these shortages occur often since the restaurant is in a tourist area."
Gwen S.,"Oakdale, United States",0,35,12,4.0,7/7/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a favorite, sometimes the wait is long, but always worth it in the end. HUGE servings, Split an entree! Cheesecake is to die for!  If you don't sit outside, make sure you visit to see the view.  It's an extra special evening during the holidays!"
Wendy L.,"Berkeley, United States",667,1217,63,4.0,3/7/2015,"You have to know what you're going to the Cheesecake Factory for. It's not for artisan crafted food meticulously made for each diner. It is, however, very tasty food that is well-executed by a chain. It can take a while to get through the book of a menu. I have a go-to menu item that I order (the Cajun pasta) but that felt a bit too heavy for lunch. Instead, I had the grilled fish tacos which felt like a good compromise. As one might expect, the portion was huge - 4 tacos with rice and beans. Definitely worth of two meals, but tacos don't keep well so...I ate them all.  We had a reservation for 10 people and they were about 15 minutes late in seating is because they ""didn't have a server."" I'm not sure what that means considering that it was the lunch hour and when we were finally seated, I saw that the vast majority of their tables were empty. Something operationally off here but it was otherwise a good experience."
Michelle T.,"San Jose, United States",46,54,69,4.0,23/6/2015,"It's not just another Cheesecake Factory........ It's a Cheesecake Factory with a view! I've tried to get into this restaurant a few times but the wait was so long, I always backed out.  I am not surprised - the Boiling Crab 20mins away from me, in San Jose, has a 2-hr wait... can't imagine to be seated right away (for dinner) in this place at Union Square.  Tip: try to come in the morning for brunch, on a Sunday.  We only waited 15mins.  I'm sure city lights would be a better view, but it's not so bad during the daytime (check out the pic).   Other than that, yea... it's Cheesecake Factory.  I recommend the place to couples on dates, and the cheesecake to stressed out people like me, needing a reward.  Ha!  We actually had brunch (and it was too early for cheesecake).  The lemon-ricotta pancakes were really fluffy and had a cheesecake hint to it.  The omelette was cooked well and was not oily. I probably would've complained too had I dined there on a busy night, but, it was a good experience overall!"
Ashleigh M.,"Destrehan, United States",89,63,128,4.0,10/6/2015,"Last night my family and I went to dine at this establishment. We got there early so we didn't have to wait long so that was great after a long day of flying on the plane. The bread that they serve is fantastic and hot! The food took a while to come out after we ordered, but that was expected at a large restaurant! All the food my family got was great, I ordered the fried mac & cheese which was awesome! Then for dessert we all shared a Oreo cheesecake which was the best I've ever had! They have so many options for you to choose from there, definitely will go back!"
Peter S.,"San Gabriel, United States",11,44,36,4.0,8/6/2015,It's Cheesecake Factory. The same flavor and quality no matter which one you go to. The only bad thing here is the elevator.  About 2-3 rounds of wait to get to the top during peak hours.
Sam N.,"Big Bear Lake, United States",14,36,39,4.0,31/5/2015,Good food good service good price the only issue is the parking  Thanks cheese cake factory
Leina K.,"San Francisco, United States",71,436,467,4.0,16/5/2015,"You know what you're signing up for when you go to the Union Square Cheesecake Factory.  It's going to be at least a 30 minute wait and there is never any room at the bar. With that in mind, I like this location. It's in the middle of it all and during the day, sometimes it's nice to sit outside on the top floor and people watch (beware of birds though). People have always been friendly at this location (granted it is their job) and they know that the more efficient they are, the more tables they'll have that night. For the most part, I'm no fuss when I'm here. I order the same thing every time (da vinci pasta and georgia peach drink) and it always comes out great."
