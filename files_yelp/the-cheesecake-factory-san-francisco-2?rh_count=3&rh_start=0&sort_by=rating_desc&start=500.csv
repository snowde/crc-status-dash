James R.,"Suisun City, United States",167,496,658,4.0,14/5/2015,"I will say I've been to a couple Cheesecake Factory's, but this one is definitely the best one. I've been to this one several times, so I know what to expect. Tonight after my original plans were canceled I came here with two of my close friends for some dinner. We arrived around 7:50pm and were told the wait would be about 30-35 minutes. No big deal we had plenty of time and ordered some drinks at the bar and lounged outside by the big sign overlooking Union Square (quite a nice view). We were seated around 8:20pm. One tip I will say is that while there is always a bit of a wait the outside seating usually is quicker (there are heat lamps all around, so it's still very warm and the view is great especially with the fog rolling in). One other tip I will say to do is while waiting look over the menu! The menu has a ton of options and by knowing what you want now you can get your order in ASAP. Anyways, after we were seated it took probably 5-10 more minutes to get the waiter to our table and we ordered. I ordered the chicken and biscuits and a nacho appetizer. It took roughly another 20-30 minutes to get the rest of our food, but I am the type that likes to talk and after a few drinks we didn't even notice the time passing by. Our waiter Javier was very nice and was never pushy or impassive. The nachos were great! They had a sweet taste to them and everything came together nicely and nothing tasted soggy (like some nachos can be). The chicken and biscuits was also very good! I didn't realize they came with mushrooms (which I hate) but they were easy enough to identify and move over. The chicken was nice and juicy and the gravy went well with the meal. Since we were out we all decided to order some cheesecake. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and it was superb like usual. Overall, a nice spot.  A tad pricey, but if your in the city and looking for a consistent place with a nice view check this spot out. Just remember that there's a bit of waiting, but it's worth it at the end."
Michael Angelo R.,"San Francisco, United States",14,43,95,4.0,7/5/2015,Good food. Courteous servers. Loud music. Nice view on the patio (view of the union square).
Carla W.,"New York, United States",0,5,4,4.0,7/5/2015,Great service. Great food. Long wait times to sit inside however we sat outside with the heaters. It's worth going!! Be prepared to pay a lot of you want to have a few alcoholic beverages!
Rachel S.,"Alameda, United States",0,8,1,4.0,4/5/2015,I normally don't like barbecue sauce but my friend told me that I have to try the barbecue Salamon in the Cheesecake Factory and it was one of the best Salamon I ate and the sauce was perfect not too much strong I highly recommend and I will give  five star because the amazing service definitely will come back again
Erica S.,"San Rafael, United States",0,33,,4.0,3/5/2015,"So let me say the atmosphere is amazing, the view is wonderful and the food always delivers to be great! I must minus some point however for a crazy wait, and when another customer was flashing their flash light in my face trying to read their menu obnoxiously I flagged down a waitress to ask her to politely tell this chick to stop it- it had been 10  min already, the waitress went to get the manager which was good, however they wanted me to move my seat...ummm why can't you go ask her to stop? Next time I would  just go ask myself so that ticked me off. But if you're a tourist it's a fun place to eat!"
Oz Z.,"San Leandro, United States",15,75,,4.0,27/4/2015,Very nice place to have lunch in a hot sunny day outside patio looking over the civic center Had great service the only thing that sucks even with reservation you have to wait 20-30 mnts
Ledam O.,"Daly City, United States",44,77,51,4.0,25/4/2015,"I love this place for food and drinks and view! I only hate how busy it gets and sometimes the wait seems unbearable, however it's a given since a lot of tourists go here. It is centralized in the heart of Union Square.  I usually get the Hibatchi Steak which comes with mashed potatoes, cut up steak, asparagus, all this over caramelized onions/mushrooms/beansprouts.  I also like the crab dip, calamari, and baked mushrooms.  Must try all! Its funny how I dont get cheesecake though, because after every meal im always full. beware, parking is not free, no free parking around this location!  Service is 7/10"
Elizabeth W.,"London, United Kingdom",8,10,,4.0,15/4/2015,"On the highest hill, on top of the tallest tower, there was a cheesecake factory.  Sitting high up amidst the clouds, the people ate their large, cheap meals, and they rejoiced.  They wept when the wait was long and there were so many people that no one had any personal space in the waiting area.  They wept when two steaks were ordered and one came out.  Bottom line Cheesecake Factory is an American staple.  It's kind of sick because its so big, but you have to love it.  Long live red velvet cheesecake."
Soraya S.,"Novato, United States",7,5,1,4.0,1/4/2015,"i just love cheese cake, food is good large portions , good service, great location, one star less because they made me wait for like 30 mins to be seated , but i still enjoyed"
Kevin L.,"San Francisco, United States",331,89,101,4.0,28/3/2015,"TIME - What's great about cheesecake factory is the hours of operation. On weekdays they go from 11am-11pm, Fri and Sat 11am-12:30am and Sun 10am to 11pm.  FOOD - I love the Louisiana chicken, and for those who wants to eat healthier they have that options too. The portions are large, so if you want to go to cheesecake factory for their cheesecake, I suggest you make room for that if you have a meal before the cake. I love their banana cream one.  Not so great is the wait times. Sometimes you wait for hours, depending on what time you arrive there. So be prepared for that too."
Debbie D.,"San Francisco, United States",373,324,1110,4.0,28/3/2015,"I rarely come to cheesecake factory unless I'm in the area. I've celebrated my birthday at cheesecake factory couple of times and I enjoyed their food.  Tonight I got their Louisiana pasta ($17) and I love it, sauce is creamy and the breaded chicken was crispy and meaty. This place is known for the view and the atmosphere so expect to pay $$$. Wait time was estimated 40 mins on a Friday night but we got called in earlier so no complaints :)"
Leeana B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",116,28,14,4.0,26/3/2015,"I mean it was iight. I was eating about 2 feet away from Iggy Azalea and I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to get the same dish she got. She got a bunch of random crap on her plate then she spit it out and started rapping about all the ingredients that was on it then called it her single for her next album.  Overall...it was aiight."
Josue V.,"San Francisco, United States",20,130,135,4.0,14/3/2015,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food at this Cheesecake Factory. Be ready for the most insane wait times, but they are warranted due to the fact that this restaurant is pretty much the only one open past 10pm on a weekend night. My gf and I had to wait only 45 min, which was quick compared to the 2-3 hour waits I heard for the groups in front of us. Once we got seated the waitress was patient with us and did not rush which I appreciated. We started with the crispy Cuban rolls and the loaded baked potatoes tots. Both were very good and the sauces were on point. I decided to go with a classic for dinner, fettuccini Alfredo, made well and no issues. I always believed that cheese cake factory is overpriced and still do, but nonetheless it was a pleasant late night meal and if you get reservations take em!"
Georges B.,"Oakland, United States",11,122,,4.0,5/3/2015,"The best thing about this place is the view. Other than that, it's your average Cheesecake Factory: very large portions, average quality food, good drinks, above average desserts."
Miranda B.,"Alamo Heights, San Antonio, United States",3,27,5,4.0,26/2/2015,"4 stars because the wait took FOREVER! But the view outside was worth it. The food was also pretty good, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo w chicken- pretty good. Sad I didn't get to try the cheesecake!! Next time"
Lawrence G.,"San Francisco, United States",1540,20,,4.0,18/2/2015,"I would say the best place to eat when your going on a date, anniversary or taking your significant other for lunch or dinner time, bcause they have a variety of lunch and dinner dish available to order & eat people! My favorites dishes would be their Italian Spaghetti w/ cheese and meat sauce, I really like the taste of their side Ceazar Salad w/ chilcken along w/ ranch sauce!!! I also like ordering that along with their raspberry iced tea and getting two bottles of Corona Beers is amazing combination - the atmosphere is really good in the afternoon especially when your table is outside on the balcony area overlooking the city view of downtown San Francisco & at night time when your w/ your girlfriend, special partner or close friends - its a very romantic place w/ good servers, great atmosphere, & the restaurant set up is really nice like the lighting, set up of the tables, & location of the bar is awesome right on the center of the place when you walked in you cant miss it fellas/ladies... The servers really care about how you feel & they check on you on how you like the food that you order, & ask you about if there is other things like desserts or drinks you want to order, so they can assist you & your company! I recommend & gives this place two thumbs up, and my own experiences here has been pleasant, fantastic, and my friends and I really enjoy & love this place!!! =)"
Ania P.,"Bordeaux, France",77,204,671,4.0,17/2/2015,Wonderful view and fat ass food! Made my day! The service is as good as in every Cheesecake Factory :)
Jennifer B.,"Orange County, United States",751,87,32,4.0,28/1/2015,"LONG wait lines, but I can never avoid this place since my boyfriend is obsessed with their pizza. I always try to find something new to eat whenever we come here. Last time I got a cheeseburger which was surprisingly, AMAZING! I've also gotten the Cajun Chicken Littles plate numerous times because its so good, but don't let the name fool you, the plate is HUGE and it could serve two! The quality of service usually depends on which day you go. Most of the time we try to go on week days to avoid the massive crowds and have usually gotten better service than on weekends."
Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, United States",81,1838,8185,4.0,28/1/2015,"I can't resist going here when I find myself in Union Square around dinner time.  THE WAIT: We showed up around 6pm and the wait was about 45 minutes for 2 of us for a window seat on the patio. They were pretty accurate - we got caught up shopping in Macy's and came back after an hour and they had already called us. We still got a patio table but not a window seat with a direct view. There are heating lamps out there that make the cold pretty bearable, but I still had to wear my jacket and sit directly under it (which also meant I wasn't facing the view but looking back at the restaurant). THE SERVICE:  Our server was very friendly and professional and always checked on us when needed. MUST-HAVES: Avocado egg rolls! Do NOT get the Diane's Steak as it's completely bland. * Avocado rolls appetizer - 4 stars pic:  Really tasty! Thick and subtly crunchy shell, soft avocado filling. I didn't love the dip, which was sweet and sour, but the rolls really didn't have much flavor without the dip so I had to go with it anyway. * Diane's Steak - 2 stars pic:  This was very flavorless. The steak had zero seasoning on it. There was a little bit of sauce with the mushrooms but it really didn't add much. The mashed potatoes have a bit more flavor but then those were pretty hard and dried out. * Jambalaya - 3.5 stars pic:  Petty tasty & spicy, a very big and pretty enjoyable entree, especially compared to the steak! The chicken was fairly tender, but shrimp not super fresh and lacked that nice crunch. * Oreo Cheesecake - 3.5 stars pic:  Can't really go wrong here. Oreo everything: in the whipped cream, in the cake, on top, on the plate. I would just say that the oreos sprinkled around were pretty dried out and hard."
Frank R.,"Bend, United States",1,88,1,4.0,14/1/2015,"I love cheesecake. It was a very nice experience. We had coffee and Cheesecake. Nothing more and not a thing less. ASHLEY was an awesome server. Happy, professional, and prompt... The outside patio area looked nice as you overlook Union Square, but then The Birds arrived. Pigeons and Gulls, oh my."
