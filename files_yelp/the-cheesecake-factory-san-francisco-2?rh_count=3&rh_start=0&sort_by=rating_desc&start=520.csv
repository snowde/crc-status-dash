Valentin R.,"San Francisco, United States",6,11,,4.0,6/1/2015,Long wait list and a very hectic location. Typical cheesecake and decent service. Love the cheesecakes though!
Cands W.,"San Jose, United States",269,25,2,4.0,27/12/2014,"I think a lot of people give low ratings to the Cheesecake Factory because of the wait time. We ate there the day after Christmas so it was extremely busy. Our wait time was 1.5 to 2 hours for a table of 4 so if you plan on eating there, reserve ahead of time! (Just a heads up: they do not accept reservations over the phone. You have to reserve your table in person.) It wasn't a big deal to me because the restaurant is located basically in Macy's so we spent our wait time shopping!  Customer service is really good and the food was really good too! All the portions are huge though so if you don't like to eat too much, I would recommend sharing your meal with someone. All the dishes are pretty expensive but I believe it was worth it! :D If you go in the winter time, I suggest that you try outdoor seating. We opted out of it because we thought it was going to be too cold. However, they have heat lamps outside and it was not even one bit cold! If you reserve for outdoor seating, your wait time might be shorter too. The view is AMAZING as well; you get to see the entire Union Square. During the winter time, it is beautiful with all the lights! Even if you eat indoors, after your meal you should go outside to look at the view. Overall, great service and great food, just a little pricey and long wait times."
Javier P.,"Redwood City, United States",1,9,10,4.0,23/12/2014,The ambiance is perfect. Nice and dimmed and being on the eighth floor just makes it sweeter. The view from the balcony seats are just awesome and specially now since the city is adorned with christmas joy.  The steak Diane medallions never fail. Merry christmas everyone!
Roger M.,"New York, United States",173,15,7,4.0,14/12/2014,"The food is fantastic. The grilled pork chop with the potatoes are fantasticn the cheescake variety is amazing. I had the white chocolate rasberry cheesecake and it was great. My knock on the place is there is an over abundance of items on the menu that makes it hard to narrow down what to eat, I would prefer they narrow it down to best sellers or specialties."
Alex T.,"San Mateo, United States",1,16,,4.0,8/12/2014,"For some reason, the miso salmon in this location just tastes better than other three locations I have been to. So,I will stick to this one for a while. My wife once ordered the fresh spring roll, which was just so so. But, come on, this is not a Vietnamese restaurant anyway.  Definitely recommend it"
Linda J.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, United States",11,61,,4.0,4/12/2014,"Had a nice lunch here in the Macy's location. The location is great and the restaurant is decorated nicely. A great place to watch the annual Christmas Tree lighting in Union Square.  We both ordered from  the ""skinny menu"". and were very pleased. My husband had the  Mexican Tortilla salad-it was huge and filled with many things and delicious! I had the three soft chicken tacos with veggie salad and that also, was amazing. We will certainly stop at Cheesecake Factory  again. Prices were reasonable too."
Debra O.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,2,4.0,4/12/2014,Love the atmosphere the view and the food. No matter what you order it's all delicious. my favorite is their kale salad. When I'm not with family or friends I order to go and avoid the long wait. The wait is the only reason I rated it a four instead of five.
Robert B.,"El Dorado Hills, United States",12,134,93,4.0,3/12/2014,My chopped salad was very good as was the peppermint stick cheesecake that my wife ordered. It was a grand view of Union Square from the 7th floor of Macy's Department Store.   The decor is great with Egyptian Pillars. The service was first rate as well.  A huge menu was a pleasant surprise.
Tiffany D.,"Pittsburg, United States",85,75,47,4.0,3/12/2014,After a long men's Macy's trip this place hit the spot!  Didn't take long to get seated. Granted we visited on a Tuesday @3pm. We love sitting outside despite the chilly weather- make sure you request this a head of time AND ask for a window seat!  We ordered Louisiana pasta and chicken Alfredo- they have lunchtime portions available until 5pm. Not for us though!! Both dishes came out hot and fresh. Both were on point but the Louisiana pasta was exceptionally good. I would for sure get this again.   We topped off our Linner (lunch/dinner) with turtle cheesecake and coffee! Bomb!!
Shan M.,"San Mateo, United States",1,26,13,4.0,26/11/2014,"I really love the food here despite it being on the pricey side. I came here with a friend because I had a $50 gift card. We really enjoyed our experience here being that we sat outside with the amazing union square view. Unfortunately, our waiter kind of sucked because he kept avoiding our table and took forever to give us the check. He was also very obviously annoyed when we kept changing our minds on our orders and i understand that we were being obnoxious as well but he should expect this while working at a full service place. He also made a mistake of charging me something I didn't purchase and took forever again to fix it. Other than that, I loved it here."
Jessica X.,"San Francisco, United States",98,15,,4.0,24/11/2014,"This is my go-to whenever my friends and I finish shopping or roaming the streets of downtown! It never fails to disappoint me! Although, the wait can get a bit long. It all depends on the hour, the occasion, and etc. However, my friends and I usually don't tend to wait over 30 minutes on average. Given we go in around lunch time (11-12ish). I've tried just about half of their very extensive menu. So far, no complaints. Everything tastes pretty good! It doesn't hurt to say that the portions are also more-than-generous. If you're a big eater, dinner size would be no problem, but for folks with a more smaller to normal appetite, it might be a bit of struggle for you to finish.  Service is a good pace. I wish it could be a bit more timely or quicker, but with the traffic this place gets, it's understandable. The staff members do work very hard to stay on their toes and serve you.  Pricing is not bad for what you're getting. Good food and good atmosphere! Not too noisy and perfect for small to large groups!"
Yanakon D.,"San Francisco, United States",38,40,563,4.0,27/10/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory might not be the best place to go for food in SF because it's always packed with tourists but it's still a place to go for a slice of cake when you're downtown. When I crave for cake I always have to run here because of the varieties that I can't deny. The original is good, the ultimate red velvet is a must, the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake is delish and the lemon meringue is awesome. It seems a little pricey but the huge food portions worth the price and they're equally tasty."
Mary W.,"Daly City, United States",130,87,544,4.0,21/10/2014,"I have always, always been a fan of the CheeseCake Factory no matter where I am at. I have loved all the food I have tried and been very happy.  I have gone to this one specifically just to get a piece of cheescake to share with my boyfriend and friends. Any flavor is delicious, I recommend trying all their seasonal ones when they come out! Any chocolate with peanut butter ones I love, red velvet, caramel, all of them are BOMB! I can not wait to try their new pumpkin one, hopefully one cheat day I can get a piece to share! I ate here with my boyfriend last week for our anniversary and we got to sit at the bar right away, perks of only having two of us, didnt have to wait, we had the artichoke and  crab dip, yum! I ordered the caesar salad, and it had a little bit of kick, with the perfect amount of dressing, and I choose to add a salmon filet, another DELICIOUS choice! My boyfriend got his typical favorite, chicken billagio pasta, it was also very yummy! If you have a smaller party this is a fun place to go and sit at the bar to watch a game or not have to wait. If you want to wait to sit on the patio, bring a jacket, and smaller parties wont have to wait to long 10-15 min."
Loretta C.,"Los Angeles, United States",3524,954,21688,4.0,9/10/2014,"This is a decent Cheesecake factory, with the same good quality food as other locations.  I like that this is located at the top floor of the building (the sign said 7th but it is on the 8th floor).  The wait is a bit long and it is very fast paced since there are always tourists here, but the food is great, and the view from the balcony is amazing.  I look forward to coming back here again  :)"
Bernie C.,"San Francisco, United States",10,147,,4.0,16/9/2014,"I'm so fancy, but you already know... Actually, no, I'm not.  First things first, I'm a realist!   I get it, I get why they don't take reservations, because if they did, there might as well not be any walk ins.  I get it.  However, the wait during pretty much any time of the day is pretty intense.  Peak hours, you can wait up to 1 hour and a half (depending how many folks you have).  Most of the time, if you have a small party, maybe 30 minutes or so.  It's not all that bad honestly.   I really like the ambiance of the place.  It's really nice to sit outside when it's not too windy.  Chilly is cool with me, but the wind just throws things off (literally).  For the most part, I've always had really nice staff members help us out.  The food, is what it is.  I think is pretty good food, but man the price is pretty narly.  I guess you don't really pay for the food but for the location.   I had a birthday there once, and the nice waitress gave me a free ice cream with a cool candle.  I appreciated that very much."
Natasha N.,"Los Angeles, United States",6,10,1,4.0,15/9/2014,"The best thing about this cheesecake factory is their location, right in the heart of union square giving you a nice view right below of all the hustle and bustle. The food as compared to other locations is pretty decent, wait staff is attentive and frequently stop by to ask if you need anything.My fav dish is the jamaican black pepper shrimp and it didnt disappoint at this location either. After a long day shopping/sight seeing its a nice treat to yourself. Deducting a star for wait time which seems to be a norm at mostly all cheese cake factory locaitons."
Hortensia M.,"San Leandro, United States",88,7,5,4.0,13/9/2014,Ok I like to give the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because service they're friendly and attentive but your wait time to be seated is at least 45 minutes which is a bummer  Now the food is great but its never hot  My favorite dish is the Steak Diane the gumbo the Jamaican black pepper shrimp the Cajun pasta and the Grande burrito  love all their drinks they're strong   I come here often with my boyfriend he order the same thing every time the steak diane
Quyen T.,"San Francisco, United States",2,18,,4.0,27/8/2014,"Went here on a Tuesday night ! Nothing much to say 40 minute wait to get seats , I requested the roof with the side window and they were really accommodating. No matter who I spoke to at cheesecake, host, bidder, or waiter . Everyone was really nice and professional with their service so I can tell people here are well trained!  A little bit pricey a dish for 20$.  Love their Long Island ice tea!  Good dinner nice view good service and drinks! Did I mention free bread!!  Negative 1 star for the wait"
Luke S.,"Berkeley, United States",1,2,,4.0,26/8/2014,"Perfect location and if you sit outside,the view is so damn good.The starter bread is nice,I will definitely get more if I wasn't go there with another four people.Lunch is too much if you want some cakes,which is the must order.The only bad thing is that with so many people,waiting for a seat is the have-to."
Mia C.,"Orangevale, United States",41,858,533,4.0,23/8/2014,Best Cheesecake Factory  I've ever been to. They are located on the roof of the Macy's building in Union Square.  The view from here is amazing. We went there for a late night dinner after 9pm and left happy. Of course I loved the cheesecakes for which they are famous for. The pastas we tried were delicious.
