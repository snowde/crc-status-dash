Becca S.,"San Francisco, United States",10,14,,4.0,18/8/2014,This place is ALWAYS packed. Be ready for a wait and a bit of chaos - lots of families and tourists. Love that they're open late and their take out is pretty quick. Patio seating on a clear day is relaxing; you can see all around downtown and people watch over Union Square Park.
Cecile S.,"San Francisco, United States",38,250,1,4.0,8/8/2014,"food: 4/5 service: 4/5 decor/atmosphere: 4/5 Don't come here anymore, but still a fan. I came here multiple times and enjoyed myself each time. I wouldn't say it is the best in the city, but its a place where I know I would get decent food. The portions are huge here and I always have left overs. Each dish is about $12-20. This place is a chain and runs like one. They are strict on how the servers treat you and how each meal comes out. It is never gourmet, but its still good. I only come here now for late night cheesecake since this location is open till 12am.  Only time I had issues was that they tried to maximize their seating and had all these tables up against doorways and walkways. A lot of people complained cuz the doors were knocking stuff over, wind was blowing stuff off tables, and servers kept bumping against people. Many parties and myself had to ask to change to a different locations. I hope they went back to their regular seating arrangement."
Mike T.,"San Francisco, United States",2,18,3,4.0,30/7/2014,"i went there couple week ago during weekend with family of four, i ordered a steak and my family of four ordered their set of meals and we ordered a fancy chocolate cheesecake, which i end up in love with.  I do not use to eat cheesecake before, but i know i want to go again after my first bite. i think the seating, however, are very limited probably because these seats are very good -viewed to outside.  But i still enjoy that meal with my family.  We will probably go there again next few weeks."
eunnah s.,"Castro Valley, United States",118,21,9,4.0,29/7/2014,"This cheesecake factory is pretty great.  My sister and I love getting like four appetizers and sharing especially during happy hour.  The food is good, it's pretty much the same as every other cheesecake factory.  The service is all right, but the waiting area is always too crowded.  They probably should expand it bit and put more seating for waiting people.   the view is nice if you get to sit out on the balcony, but usually it's way too cold for that, so most of the time, the view doesn't really matter.   I recommend eating here.  It's just a generic cheesecake factory."
Ben Z.,"San Francisco, United States",116,102,8,4.0,29/7/2014,"I was once told that Cheesecake factory is the ""fancy"" place you take your date when you're in High School. Needless to say, my overwhelming fear of shame never let me set foot in a CF again... until this past Friday night. My GF and I ended our night there at the bar, and you know what? It was pretty fun! The place was crawling with tourists though, but I very much enjoyed the vibe inside. The bartender was very nice and fast. We ordered 2 cheesecakes, because my GF is INCAPABLE of sharing.  Seriously though, we've almost broken up because my bite of her pizza was too big.  I just read her review and she said that she's going to order 1 cheesecake next time... YEAH. RIGHT."
Julianna I.,"San Francisco, United States",493,319,94,4.0,27/7/2014,"So who eats at Cheesecake factory when they go to SF (unless you are a tourist?) Well, me and my boyfriend (who live in SF did!) And it was probably one of our best dates. We had dinner close by, but then we wanted to see the rooftop bar here. So we came at 9pm on Friday night and noticed that CF was pretty happening. It was crowded, full of young people (maybe all tourists). We got 2 seats at the bar, ordered 2 delicious cheesecakes and 2 rounds of Long Island Ice Teas and got pretty drunk. It was A LOT of fun. I would go again, but next time maybe only get one cheesecake because they are pretty big and really sweet."
Joaquin A.,"Mountain View, United States",117,31,5,4.0,20/7/2014,"I've experienced a lot of Cheesecake places and this is still one of my favorites mainly for the view.  If you aren't in a rush or don't care for a wait (which could be an hr or more), then yeah dine here. If you do end up waiting, you can go downstairs to Macy's - no big deal. Recently, I've been getting their Teriyaki rice dish. Now, some people might be like nahhh its not that great, but for me - its pretty decent. I enjoy it. Especially since I always get the costelleta.  You can never go wrong with the dessert here.  Also, if you end up being outside - hope you have a jacket. It does get windy TIP: If you want some eye candy best believe you'll find at least a handful of waiters and customers that be looking right - definitely a bonus if you just wanna people watch ;)  Also, the service is a hit or miss...You can get a great waiter or a waiter that is pretty spacey like the one I had recently, but with the view and eye candy - it makes up for it :)"
Rocio G.,"San Antonio, United States",118,146,64,4.0,19/7/2014,"I mean, you have to know what to expect coming here. Know that it's going to be packed with tourists, that the wait is going to be crazy long, and that your server will be pushed to the limit. Also though, know that there's a great view, the menu has a million choices (and there's a separate kid's menu), and the food is going to taste exactly as you expected. I recommend the herb crusted salmon salad. My husband likes the orange chicken. Baby loves the kid's mac and cheese. If you're in for a wait, hang out at Macy's- lounge in the furniture section or do some shopping. There's a time and place for a SF Cheesecake Factory experience. Just know what you're getting yourself in to."
Camille B.,"Berkeley, United States",67,145,104,4.0,15/7/2014,"Cheesecake factory is Cheesecake factory. Huge portions, great prices, friendly service and delicious food. What makes this one special is it's location in Union Square. It is several stories up and provides a great view if you get a window or outdoor seat. Be prepared to wait though! My first and only time there, I waited 1h 15min."
Tony C.,"San Francisco, United States",10,52,17,4.0,15/7/2014,"I've been here countless of times and it's always busy. Locals and tourists alike come here often. Wait can be long. My friends and I always get there early. We like sitting outside rather than the inside. When the fog in SF fades, it's nice to dine out in the warmth. You get a good view of the Union Square and the other buildings nearby.  The food here was great. I ordered one of their pasta (Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta) for around $14 I think and the portion was pretty big. I also tried their burgers on another trip, not that great compared to the pasta. One of my friend ordered the fillet mignon and he said it turned out good but was very expensive (around $30). They ask you how well you want it to be done when you order it. And of course, the meal wouldn't be complete without the cheesecake. I believe we shared the Hershey's Chocolate one for desert. There's also alcohol drinks, such as cocktails. The Long Island Iced Tea was fresh and cold as expected.  Service can be slow when busy like in any restaurant. Server greets at your table and will serve for you for the entire dine. Staffs were friendly. Water cups were filled and complementary bread with butter is always provided after ordering your meal. The place is pricey, but for the taste and quality, I would give it another try whenever I have the extra money."
Candace M.,"Charleston, United States",2,32,4,4.0,5/7/2014,"Typically not a chain eater on trips, BUT we were looking for something close and open late near Union Square.  The Thai lettuce wraps are always a favorite, and the beet salads was great.  Finished off with a Oreo cheesecake, so all and all....a good night."
Brian H.,"Benicia, United States",66,94,28,4.0,30/6/2014,"i enjoy coming to the cheesecake factory in San Francisco.  The food is good and the service is excellent.  It can be busy so be prepared to have a relatively short wait.  The Cheesecake is why we come and enjoy the menu.   We usually sit in the bar, you can people watch, watch TV usually sports and enjoy."
Esther J.,"San Francisco, United States",2,4,,4.0,27/6/2014,"I've eaten here a countless number of times.  Despite the wait being ridiculous (usually an hour during dinner rush, more or less) I honestly really like this particular Cheesecake Factory.  It's a busy place but the atmosphere isn't bad, service is decent, and the view is nice if you sit outside because it's right in the middle of downtown.  The long wait is mitigated by the fact that one floor down, it's the Macy's furniture floor, so go find a nice couch and take a break from all that walking around downtown you were probably doing.  This Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to go if you're not feeling too uppity but still want something better than Applebees.  Also the best part is the ginormous portions; I'm a girl, I eat a lot but these portions are definitely quite sharable.  And don't forget the free bread, everybody loves free bread. I'm just going to make a quick list of what I think are the best dishes to order here.   Entrees: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Cajun Jambalaya Pasta Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread Small Plates/Appetizers: Ahi Tartare Firecracker Salmon Nothing's mindblowing but the food is pretty darn good and the amount you get for the price is definitely worth it.  Eat here."
Vic M.,"Chico, United States",0,359,608,4.0,24/6/2014,"Went here for lunch. The food was good the service was okay and for the price overall this  Cheesecake Factory deserved a 4 rating:. The Kobe hamburger was excellent. The ""skinny licious"" tacos were excellent as well."
Marquelle S.,"Summerville, United States",8,21,,4.0,19/6/2014,"Prepare for a wait. There will always be one but if you're not in a hurry it is worth it. The staff has always been very friendly and attentive at every visit. The atmosphere is loud so if you want to have a quiet conversation, this may not be the most ideal place. However, the food is wonderful and this place has sinfully delicious Oreo and Red Velvet Cheesecakes."
Ali S.,"Huddinge, Sweden",11,110,196,4.0,18/6/2014,You always now what you're gonna get which I love about the Cheesecake Factory. We had the Moroccan chicken which is our favorite dish. The food is average but you have to be honest why you really keep on coming back here.. The cheesecakes of course! We've almost went through all of them and they're delicious. :-)
Karm P.,"Fremont, United States",18,19,37,4.0,10/6/2014,Cheesecake Factory what can i say.........cheesecakes are best here.......long waits for a table suck cuz this place is always packed due to a lot of shoppers and tourist not a bad thing but just a wait.......food is ok as always menu been same a long time needs an update.....but again the CheeseCakes make up for everything..
Natali Q.,"Fairview, United States",1,21,25,4.0,10/6/2014,"The wait time is more than 30 minutes here, the lobby gets extremely full. Staff is friendly and efficient in taking orders,  asking if everything is alright and serving our food with due time. Overall experience was good, except for the lengthy wait time."
Karen J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,104,42,4.0,10/6/2014,yummy food if you know what to order. nice staff mostly except for one lady I came across. Waiting time usually 40 mins or an hour
Mel T.,"Long Beach, United States",167,88,173,4.0,30/4/2014,"CHEESE CAKE FACTORY! Haha, you're a chain you. Although this place is really typical and it is kind of ""whatever"" to some, I actually really enjoy this place. I'm pretty fond of the food here and the portions. It is a bit on the pricier side, but there are really decent portions for what you pay for. Which is hard to get for a place with a nice atmosphere as well.  I've come here for many formal events and I think it's one of the perfect places to have them. Especially with big groups, because you can make reservations and they're pretty good with that. Of course, as usual, the tip will be automatically added to your bill. My default dish is fettichini alfredo, can't go wrong with it! Just add chicken, shrimp or whatever ya like to it."
