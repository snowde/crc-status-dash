Jennifer J.,"Eugene, United States",2,12,7,4.0,29/4/2014,"We got in quick, the food is tasty and predictable from location to location. It's a great place for lunch and a view of Union Square. There are so many great restaurants in San Fran you feel a bit guilty eating at a chain restaurant but I enjoyed the experience. Also the staff was friendly and can give great advice for us tourists!"
Ram B.,"Dublin, United States",5,20,,4.0,28/4/2014,Food in this place is great and Service is excellent too. But i just hate that people need to wait for more than 45 mins to get a place. There is no option for reservations too. I hope the wait time improves.
Dan B.,"Baldwin, United States",0,24,7,4.0,19/4/2014,"Great view if sitting outside, but they only allow 4 people to a table, so our party of 7 had to be seated at 2 tables next to each other. This was silly because we still had the same waitress so why not just push the tables together? Silly rule, and we still had to wait 30 min even though one whole side of the outside was empty. Food was excellent, but the sangria was just fruit juice, and at $11 a glass, I will never buy this again at cheesecake. Three of us ordered 2 glasses just to be sure we didn't get a bad batch but both glasses were the same, so avoid it!"
Tamisha L.,"Richmond, United States",5,6,7,4.0,19/4/2014,Had brunch here. The wait was 45mins which made my date impatient but did window shopping at Macy's while we waited. Had calamari and peanut sauce appetizer which was delicious. The tomato basil pasta was horrible but I left with the most unhealthy portion of red velvet cheesecake that was to die for. Had the nicest and most patient waiter and overall enjoyable time.
Zaheem B.,"Elk Grove, United States",104,204,178,4.0,11/4/2014,"The bar staff was nice enough to create a jalapeño margarita for my girlfriend, which did not disappoint. This left a great impression on us and made our dining experience great."
Wanda M.,"Daly City, United States",228,147,59,4.0,8/4/2014,"I came here to celebrate a mini-reunion with my graduating class from high school. We came during the holiday season so it was quite busy. Since they don't take reservations, and we planned to get together around 6pm, one friend and I showed up extra early around 4pm to reserve a table for 10 people. We told them that this was for our reunion. We were pretty disappointed we couldn't all sit together, we were placed at two table, one behind the other, and we couldn't talk or see the other table. We saw a bunch of vacant tables that sat 4, right next to each other. We would've needed three, but the host didn't listen to our request. It was a bit disappointing, but we were going to make the best of it. Six of us squeeze into one table, the remaining four sat behind us.  Our waiter was awesome!! I wish I caught his name. He was really friendly and funny and gave good recommendations.  I [think] i ordered the louisiana pasta (or something like that). It was really yummy and full of flavor. The portion was pretty big so I took what I couldn't finish home. I also ordered the Asian Pear Martini and it sure packed a punch :). The others all enjoyed their food as well. So even though we didn't all sit together, we still had a great experience. We might have our next reunion here but we will be very persistent about sitting together."
Benita M.,"San Francisco, United States",149,397,1162,4.0,3/4/2014,"You know, I would have given it 5 stars... But had to ding 1 star. Read below to find out why... Walking in, oh my word, those cheesecakes looked SO FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS. Came at 1:30pm, 5 minute wait for inside table, 15minutes for outside. I chose inside. Got a table at the far back corner. +Service was excellent. Very patient and understanding waiters/waitresses. ~Kind of loud inside but it was lunch time, noise is a must. +Very clean restaurant. Sat down, ordered a Crispy Crab Wonton Appetizer ($10.95). Really good. Fried very nicely. Inside was nice and warm. Dipping sauce (sweet chili sauce) accompanied it well. My entree was a Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. Oh boy this was really good. Tasted like bacon, and there isn't any. A little too salty in my opinion, was grabbing for water a lot. I couldn't finish it and brought it home. Once I got home, I noticed there was a LOT of oil at the bottom. Not much of a turnoff, until I started eating and I saw a tiny piece of metal scrap in my pasta... Gross. It was a metal scrap fallen from cleaning pots and pans. Totally disgusting... Kind of sad I didn't get to try the cheesecake. Got too full but heard lots of compliments for them. It was a very pleasant afternoon. Everything was great, up until I found that metal scrap. I don't know if I want to return.. but if it's for the cheesecakes, different story :)"
Lorena M.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, United States",5,6,,4.0,3/4/2014,This by is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location. The view is incredible and the service is pretty good even though they are ALWAYS busy when I go on the weekend.  If you want to avoid a long wait I'd recommend coming on a week day otherwise be prepared to wait over an hour for a table.
Dennis Y.,"Honolulu, United States",12,73,8,4.0,30/3/2014,"Man, we got lost finding the front entrance (we're from Hawaii), guess we weren't really paying attention that it was inside another store (Macy's, as we only glanced and saw the sign while driving around Union Square). We headed for a really late night dinner this past Thursday (after sightseeing and then resting at the hotel, 55 Park Wyndham), walking towards the place about 10:10pm. My phone gps is saying we are there, but 'saw' no Cheesecake Factory, so we walked around the block again, seeing Macy's looking closed (even though their neon sign is saying ""open tonight""). Tried calling, but no pick up after 7 rings, so decided to walk around the block again. Tried calling this time and finally someone said yes, they were open and was located upstairs..We go by that entry and finally see security guards by the elevators (no one was around the first time, so we thought our info was wrong about the location or hours), and went up. Mind you, it is now 10:25pm, and it suppose to close at 11pm.  Thinking don't think they really will close at 11pm as there were so many people still waiting, we finally get seated about 10:45pm... Wife orders soup, but waiter says don't think they have any left, but would check anyway.  I order the cuban sandwich and son orders the shepard's pie.  Bread is provided, tastes good (always like their breads), and he comes with the soup! Says no charge, it was the last serving and wouldn't charge us!  My first time to eat a cuban sandwich, and love it...people around and it's 11:20pm...including us...they don't rush us out... Cheesecake slice was $7.50, with a big wallop of whipped cream - that was delicious too. Good service and foods, and the mens bathroom was nicely maintained at that time of the night.   Just need to make it more visible to patrons that the restaurant is open (somehow)--don't assume like we did that as there weren't anyone on the ground floor, we thought the doors were locked."
Warren C.,"The Beach, Toronto, Canada",196,142,107,4.0,27/3/2014,Expect a wait for a table. Sometimes you can luck out in the bar area and get a table there.  The place is always busy. I really like this place.  The food is very good and reasonably priced.   I would recommend this place to anybody and will definitely return when I am in SF again.  The staff were all great.   A few tips: * Avoid eating the bread and you might have room for dessert * Serving sizes are massive.... don't eat it all and you might have room for cheesecake.   * don't forget to go out on the balcony and take in the nice view of Union Square.
Taelor R.,"San Francisco, United States",374,6,3,4.0,21/3/2014,"Bomb drinks! Michael at the bar, so friendly and cute pony tail. But table service not so good. Don't get Heidi as your server."
Elizabeth V.,"San Jose, United States",4,21,10,4.0,18/3/2014,Came to this Cheesecake Factory because we were in the area. It was around 2PM and the elevator was so full. We entered the restaurant and it was packed. They seated us (2 people) fairly quickly and our waiter was very nice. Our food was delicious as well. I've had several plates at Cheesecake and none of them have ever let me down!
Tracy O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",7,28,8,4.0,18/3/2014,"Gluten free menu - just ask for it! Even have gluten free buns, very tasty too. Fries can't be cooked separately but they offer mashed potatoes or other sides. Cocktails also yum!"
Blanca P.,"Edgewood Park, San Carlos, United States",23,5,,4.0,16/3/2014,"The wait time can be a bit ridiculous, super long but expected considering it's a tourist hot spot. But totally worth it. Came here for drinks and dessert. Strawberry shortcake was absolutely delicious! The drinks are a bit on the weak side but still delicious."
S L.,"San Francisco, United States",119,163,,4.0,6/3/2014,We came here around 8-9pm on a weekday. It was pretty full; we had to wait around 20 minutes to be seated. My review is only for their cheese cake. I tried their fresh banana cream cheesecake and thought it was glorious. Very very good.
John B.,"Danville, United States",98,437,1626,4.0,3/3/2014,"We had a very nice lunch here. Check out the pictures. The stuffed portobello mushroom appetizer was memorable. Nice location too, Union Square on the top floor in Macys. Great Views from Window seats."
Kevin R.,"San Francisco, United States",192,113,455,4.0,25/2/2014,"This place is great! The only downfall is if you don't get there early enough you have to normally wait for a table for about an hour or so.  Worth the wait on a nice day and you get a window or outside seat. All the staff is very friendly here.  The food is pretty good as well.  In fact there are not many items you could not find on their very extensive menu.  Oh yeah, the views are cool as well."
Anna P.,"Los Angeles, United States",233,473,1191,4.0,21/2/2014,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory. This place does get a little bit crowded, but hey, it's the location :) They have outside seating, overlooking SF from a rooftop :) Food-wise, you'll get exactly what you'll get in any other Cheesecake Factory."
Oliver D.,"Union City, United States",70,102,61,4.0,13/2/2014,"I'm a big fan of this certain Cheesecake Factory location. I love how it's in Union Square.  If the weather isn't too cold and you're dressed fairly warm, definitely ask the people at the front for an outside table. You get the view of SF and rooftop dining is always awesome. I like getting outside tables during the holidays; you get to see people ice skating below which adds to the warm Christmas atmosphere that time of year. You'll have to wait a while before you can get a vacant seat. They'll take your name and hand you a device which lights up and vibrates when your table is ready. Since this Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of a mall, a lot of people usually go to the floor below because it's a furniture store; plenty of couches to wait in which is convenient. Food really is a hit or miss.  First off, that brown bread they serve you is delicious. Very sweet. Their pasta with tomato sauces are usually pretty bland. My recommendation is to go with a pesto pasta. Pesto sauces are usually hard to mess up if you're a chef and are very tasty.  As for the service, I'm really beating myself up for this because I forgot our waiter's name (This was a couple months ago), but he was extremely nice. Probably one of the best waiters my girlfriend and I have ever had. He was a very young Latin looking kid. Maybe in his late teens or early 20s. I even looked for the receipt before making this review so I can find his name, but I couldn't find it. I think his name was Oscar, but I could be wrong. Give that guy a raise, please. He goes above and beyond. My girlfriend was concerned with the Union Square parking garage because it was past midnight. She asked the waiter if he knew what time the parking garage closes. He said he doesn't know, but he'll check. I thought he was just going to ask his coworkers, but he went ahead and looked for the garage's phone number and called them for detailed information. He did a lot of other kind things, but this review is already long enough as it is so I'll just cut it here. With all that said, this place is a decent place to eat out at. Nice view, great service, and good food. Decent location for date night as well."
Shaughni N.,"San Francisco, United States",95,20,19,4.0,31/1/2014,"this place is good. I was seated right next to my coworker which is funny because there was a sea of people there when we arrived. The service was good for a busy mainstream restaurant. The server only visited us twice within the hour we were there which was okay, but it would have been nice to be around a little more to refill drinks, etc.."
