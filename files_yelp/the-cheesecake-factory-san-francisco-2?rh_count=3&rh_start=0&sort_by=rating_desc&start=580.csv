Chris C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,25,,4.0,31/1/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants.  I've eaten at this location, and also the ones in Las Vegas, St. Louis, and Walnut Creek.  They have a wide variety of foods with plenty of vegetarian options and a dazzling array of different cheesecake varieties.  Their cheesecakes are literally the standard by which any other restaurants' cheesecakes should be judged -- they are so delicious I have never tried any of the other desserts they offer.  If you're counting calories, be sure to make an informed decision regarding your order -- their food often has a lot.  If there's any criticism I can make, it's that they don't take reservations.  This doesn't present a problem around lunch, but at dinner time -- especially on weekends -- you may have to wait a long time to get seated.  That being said, there's a good reason it's popular - the food is mouth-watering."
Lawrence A.,"Oakland, United States",292,17,17,4.0,26/1/2014,I love the Cheese Cake factory but wait times can be long it is in the heart of Union Square. Love eating outside here and seeing the great view of the city.
Lorie N.,"San Jose, United States",524,539,551,4.0,22/1/2014,"I love coming here on a perfect day and sitting outside on the terrace where you have the most amazing views of Union Square.  Having gone this past Monday for Martin Luther King's day it was unusually warm for the city and we scored a table in under 15 minutes.  I ordered a Steak Diane for the first time and was surprised at how tasty this was. The chunks of meat were seasoned nicely with the wine sauce and the mashed potatoes were so good that I couldn't help forking small mounds into my mouth. Before I knew it my meat was being ignored. Is that possible?  Apparently so.    And the weather?  Just perfect. Sunny, with the heat lamps on the lowest setting-- just enough to keep us so that we could sit comfortably without our jackets on.  If you have the opportunity, sit outside to experience this yourself. The views are worth it alone. Pair it with good friends, yummy food and you couldn't ask for a better day."
Liang Y.,"Hayward, United States",65,17,49,4.0,22/1/2014,Strawberry lemonade is my favorite! Highly recommend of that because there is no any place can make that lemonade with strong true strawberry taste~ also every time I go there I will order fried calamari or fried popcorn shrimp. Always very soft and crispy for the deep fried staff.  I am not really like the main food at there. I don't know why maybe the sauce is not really tasty or they put too much creamy such as the pasta and some cheese staff.. Anyway service is good and people all nice.
Lauren P.,"San Francisco, United States",32,8,32,4.0,19/1/2014,"View from this location is above par. The lobby ambience is especially worth mentioning, as it has the bustling ambience of a Las Vegas casino. Truly a San Francisco tourist staple. Tuna tartare small bite is also noteworthy."
Steph Q.,"San Francisco, United States",19,80,25,4.0,13/1/2014,"Melissa V, you are an awesome waitress. Came here about a horrendous service by Toast where I had to just walk out and come here for some TLC. :) Ordered breakfast food along with some cheesecake that is still sitting safely in my fridge ( I think ).  The omelette was good and the breakfast 2 eggs is what to be expected.  Really appreciated the quick and attentive service. Especially since I hate ice in my drinks and my waitress always made sure I was happy :)) THank YOu!"
Emily L.,"San Francisco, United States",81,9,1,4.0,11/1/2014,"Crab cakes are worth the normal hour wait time for Friday night dinner. Ordered appetizer crab cakes (3) with mustard and tartar sauce, and tried some Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, and my belly was already 3/4 satisfied.  Portions are larger than you would expect. Overall, I recommend the crab cakes, and if you are into eating numerous amounts of flavorful mushroom and chicken, try the Chicken Marsala. Topped the meal off with Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, which was like a chocolate coffee mousse bomb in your mouth!"
Katherine H.,"Gilroy, United States",0,9,,4.0,10/1/2014,"Great view, my go-to place for SF. They don't take reservations, so we always go and save time because there's always a wait. Food is always delicious. If its nice enough to sit outside, that's always a treat!"
Serena Z.,"San Francisco, United States",0,56,,4.0,9/1/2014,"My friend brought me here once and we got cheesecake. I got the macadamia cheesecake, it's sweet and yummy. They also they have the strawberry shortcake here, which I have never had before. It's just nice to look at the display filled with a variety of cheesecakes. This place is located inside of Macy's."
Laura B.,"Boston, United States",5,103,39,4.0,1/1/2014,"Very good but We had to wait two hours....so long!! Cheesecake are really good and the beef is good too! You can see Union Square and the Christmas tree !!  This is a good place for birthday, dinner with friends and family."
Bekkah R.,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",79,248,790,4.0,27/12/2013,"Le boyfriend and I came here for lunch yesterday after hiking and climbing at Baker Beach and were very pleasantly surprised. The food here is actually really good, especially considering that this is a chain restaurant. We ordered the warm asparagus salad, tomato&cheese flatbread, spicy chicken chipotle pasta and the fettucine alfredo with a strawberry milkshake and a oreo milkshake. For dessert we had the snickers cheesecake and the chocolate mousse cheesecake to go.  First off, when they say small plates, they actually mean small plates. The warm asparagus salad was a very small portion, but I could have eaten buckets of it. I love green asparagus! The tomato&cheese flatbread was all right, but you could make it better at home. The fettucine alfredo was good, I liked it, so did le boyfriend but he thought that I make it better at home. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it very much. The only downside was the amount of sauce. The pasta was drowning in sauce, so by the time I had finished the pasta, half the sauce was still on the plate. Which is a waste because then you're throwing away half of the delicious and creamy sauce. I just realised that I would now love to have that leftover sauce with some garlic bread for dipping. Why did I not think of this yesterday?? Anyway, on to the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Le boyfriend said: ""It's unlike any pasta I've ever had before. In a good way."" So that's some pretty high praise from him. :) And I must say, his plate did look delicious! Especially with the asparagus which I only realised at the end of the meal I would have loved to have had it with my pasta. Seriously, I love green asparagus.  As for the service. Our server, was sweet, friendly and helpful. He really deserved the tip. I know tipping is kind of the standard here in the U.S. but I still only tip when people actually deserve it. I can't remember our server's name though and don't have the receipt to check, but I hope he reads this and knows how much we appreciated him. So again, thank you for your wonderful service. Now, the cheesecakes. As you may know, cheesecake is my thing and I'm very picky about it. Considering that this is a chain restaurant I didn't have any expectations for the cheesecake, so I was pleasantly surprised by them. I liked them and even le boyfriend liked it and he used to hate cheesecake and will only eat the one my dad and I make. The first bite of the snickers cheesecake tastes a bit weird, but don't worry, the rest of it really does taste like snickers. And cheesecake, obviously. The chocolate mousse cheesecake is just dreamy. We both loved it and I would definitely order it again. So, to sum it up: surprisingly good food, friendly service and good cheesecake. I'll definitely come back here. If not on this trip, then definitely on our next trip to San Francisco. ;)"
April W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,4.0,23/12/2013,"Is this the only company in the world that makes service people wear all white? What kind of sick person would arrange that. White pants  are extremely degrading in the first place-compound this with a long white apron, white shirt, a tie and the combination is fashionably lethal. People who are serving food and running around like maniacs all day would probably be better off wearing all black to muffle the bruising betrayal of food splotches adorning their outfits. Those white pants are the scarlett letter of the service industry. I go there to eat so much that I hate myself.  The food is good if you are into that sort of thing."
Frank G.,"Sacramento, United States",373,286,93,4.0,19/12/2013,"In a rush to just eat somewhere, in the middle of a shopping trip in Union Square, with dozens of others needing or wanting to do the same, we were delightfully surprised at the quality of food, the service, and the atmosphere at this top of the city, above-the-ice-rink, above the square, restaurant. Though we were seated indoors to facilitate time, the outdoor views and seating, just outside our window, looked lovely and, even in December, seemed to work for many smiling people. Our wait wasn't bad at all and the staff was effective at handling such a demanding draw.I'm a vegetarian and was very pleased with the corn tamale cakes, which tasted almost like a veggie dessert. It may be listed as an appetizer, but I consumed it as my entree with appreciation for the chef."
Jon W.,"Dallas, United States",5,15,,4.0,13/12/2013,"We had a wonderful time at the Cheesecake factory. The pricing were very reasonable, and the food - wow. I can honestly say I had some of the best Thai chicken and rice I have ever had!!!  If I had one bad thing to say is the time it took to get served. However it is in the middle of Union Square so this ins understandable. It also took a while for our server to come and take our order once we sat down but let that not take away from the amazing food. If you are going to San Francisco, you should pop in for a meal!!"
Susan S.,"Petaluma, United States",31,128,73,4.0,9/12/2013,"Before I start the full review, my friend & me order two bloody Marys, she can't drink spicy so the bartender suggests just tomato juice for her drink we agree, mine is fantastic & spicy. My friend decides she needs more kick cause it's just vodka & bland tomato juice so we pony up to the service station & try to get the bartenders attention which we do. We wanted some of the good stuff I had in my drink added to my friends drink, just a smidge. But instead he tells the server to splash some Tabasco into the glass. That's not we expected for $9.00 drinks, he already got our tip so we were has beens. Now the rest. What a madhouse. Extreme Noise, people waiting, coming & going. This restaurant is total cookie cutter, descent fair, huge portions. And being on the 7th floor of Macys over looking union square makes for a prime location. I can't think of another restaurant that can be this successful with their large selection, portions & fair prices as well as lunch prices served til 5pm. Nice.  We ordered the avocado rolls, six large pieces served with in a crunchy fried egg roll, they might want to offer a lighter version, like endive but keep the large portion of avocado.....maybe some more herbs or spices in the avocado too. The wait staff doesn't write anything down or at least our waitress. She didn't write down we wanted the lunch portions & prices. So when we received the bill each entree was $5 more. Oh we brought it to her attention & she claimed we didn't request it, though we specifically ordered from the lunch menu & told her so & we were seated at 3pm. Is this a bait and switch? There are so many tourist there & customers that may not speak up or know how to read an American check, so I think this is standard practice. Hint, the portions are huge & a lunch portion along with all the other stuff you may order is more than sufficient. After the avocado egg rolls we both ordered salmon & the portion was great, perfectly cooked, hollandaise sauce adorned the bottom of the plate with perfect al dente asparagus on top & a nice portion of rustic red mash potatoes. For such a manic environment & apathetic waitressing & bar tending the kitchen made up for anything that was a miss. In closing I would recommend this place for location, fair prices & large portions, don't expect much from the wait staff, we still gave the staff a good tip ;-)"
Donna C.,"Lafayette, United States",29,239,25,4.0,14/11/2013,Visited on 8/13/13 for dinner. Surprisingly good. A bit of a wait but we stood outside and took in the view.  We've been to the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and Boulder and were underwhelmed. This was different.  Margaritas to start were quite tasty. Hubby had enchiladas and I got the chicken tacos great black beans. Both were great. Kids had pasta Alfredo with chicken and pasta with butter. Kids snacked on bread before dinner.  In short - pleasant experience; we'll go back our next trip to SF.
Robin Z.,"Berkeley, United States",15,21,,4.0,10/11/2013,I love this place so much. The warm bread served before the meal is so good and therefore worths the long waiting time at meal times. I strongly recommend to try the Fresh Grilled Salmon.
Darryl B.,"Orange County, United States",645,379,127,4.0,10/11/2013,"The great thing about Cheese Cake Factory, is no matter which location you dine at, they all seem to up to the same excellent standard.  The food is always worth the cost and it always very clean and pleasant with excellent customer service... This location is nice if you want to get away from the San francisco madness for a fee minutes. Patio has some excellent city views.. geez almost forgot, you haveeeeeee to enjoy a slice of cheese cake..."
Janey L.,"Union City, United States",69,149,47,4.0,9/11/2013,"I've always liked Cheesecake Factory, and I love the Cheesecake Factory at Union Square!! If you sit outside, you get a nice view of the Union Square :) you can turn it into a romantic dinner! but the wait is longer for the outside seating so we just sit inside lol too hungry to wait. Although the food&drinks feel a bit overpriced, they do give you big portions. Few favorites:  Shrimp Scampi - big big shrimps with angel hair pasta in creamy tomato sauce?, I wish it was more ""lemoney"". Avocado Eggrolls - crispy hot avocados...can't go wrong with them avocados! Navajo Sandwich - crispy bread with yummy feelings. not too heavy. one of my fav's but I didn't see it on the menu...maybe they don't serve it anymore? or I just missed it. Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp - yum yum yum, sweet&savory. It's kinda hard to describe the taste but it's definitely good! Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - extremely tender chicken chunks...kinda boring taste at first but gets better. Mojito - overpriced watered down...meh never again. Banana Cheesecake & Red Velvet Cheesecake - two of my fav cheesecakes!  Also love the black bread they serve before the meal...oh so good. Our server at union square was really nice too forgot his name though!"
Debby D.,"Burlingame, United States",3,147,2,4.0,7/11/2013,"a college international buddy invited me to be here and I was born in SF and I didn't even know about it. I really liked the outlook and the view, but I remember there was this one waiter, he was only working there 2 week and he was so friendly. I don't mind eating there but there wait is loonnng. somehow I eat all this food, I cant eat the main dessert haha"
