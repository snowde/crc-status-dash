Aislinn E.,"Oakland, United States",179,11,,4.0,2/11/2013,"Not a fan of chain like restaurants like this, due to the fact I live in the bay area. However, this was not even bad food wise, still able to stay healthy with my habits and drinks weren't as bad either"
Susana G.,"Hayward, United States",38,11,1,4.0,17/10/2013,"I would come here more often if It didn't take soooo long.  You wait in line to get in the elevator, you wait to request a table, you wait for a table and when you're buzzed you wait in line to tell them you've been buzzed. Once you get to the table, it's a great place.      The  food is delicious, the menu is huge and so are the portions.  You can come here with 10 people and there will be something to satisfy everyone.  Burgers, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, you name it they have it.  You can't beat the views either."
Leana L.,"San Francisco, United States",322,889,281,4.0,16/10/2013,"I come here every now and then at the request of a friend or my sister. There's almost always a wait (especially if you want to sit outside -- but the view from outside is worth it!).  FYI: They don't take reservations Our server was excellent -- friendly, professional, and attentive. I ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp from their skinnylicious menu. Delicious. Also, their pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecakes are back in season! Go for the view, stay for the cheesecake!"
Gelene V.,"Los Angeles, United States",221,98,24,4.0,7/10/2013,"I love the combination of shopping and stopping by here to grab a quick bite to eat. Although the wait for a table can get somewhat lengthy, you can take a beeper and shop stores in its vicinity without it going off. Another way to pass the time is to stand outside at the balcony and people watch above Union Square.  I recommend ordering the pasta here as most other dishes range between unappetizing to delicious (unpredictable depending on day and location). Some dishes that have constantly been good and I'd recommend are  - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta I also love the whole wheat grain bread they serve, I always make them refill the bread tray!! As for cheesecakes, I LOVE the red velvet cheesecake. If you love red velvet cupcakes, you're going to love this cheesecake. Some other ones I also recommend is Classic, Fresh Strawberry (Classic with Strawberry Syrup and Strawberries), and Oreo. Warning: Oreo is a little on the sweeter side. Pro-tip: If you're only stopping by to pick up cheesecake, simply go to the back to the Cheesecake register. No need to wait in line :)"
Kassondre J.,"Novato, United States",1,37,21,4.0,15/9/2013,"Finally I went to a cheese cake factory for my boyfriend and I to celebrate our anniversary early. The food was amazing! &   The price was very reasonable. The only thing about this place I didn't like was the wait time, and they don't except reservations. Other than that the view is beautiful and our waiter was very polite! When he went on brake, he introduced us to a lady who was going to be helping us untill he got back. She was also very friendly. I will diffidently be back!"
Allyson W.,"Milpitas, United States",50,11,,4.0,4/9/2013,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for date night on Labor Day evening around 7pm, and I was surprised that the wait was less than an hour. Even though it took about 40-50 min to get seated when they said 30 min. The receptionist was friendly and patient despite so many people crowding her.  For appetizer we had the crab bites, and for dinner I ordered the lemon tomato basil angel hair shrimp pasta, and my boyfriend got a basil cream sauce pasta with breaded chicken, prosciutto and arugula on top. Both were delicious!! Our waiter was friendly, never forgot about us, and was helpful. It was my boyfriends first time here and he loved his food. For dessert we had the Oreo cheesecake. So good but I wish we saved room for it during dinner.  The only complaint I had is since we sat outside during the evening, the lighting was BAD. By the end of dinner, couldn't see my food or my boyfriend."
Helen O.,"Brooklyn, United States",225,93,140,4.0,29/8/2013,"Came here for lunch during a weekday and was seated for 2 in under 5 minutes. Great for working folks who only have an hour of lunch to spare. It was a beautiful sunny day and I would've loved to sit on the patio but because of time constraints, we opted to sit inside, which was lovely nonetheless. Our waiter was extremely nice AND helpful. Our cups of water were always full. We couldn't decide between 2 appetizers, he recommended the *vietnamese tacos*, which were AMAZING. Definitely get those when you're here. My boyfriend got the *soup and sandwich lunch special* which he said was only okay, but it was a great deal for the amount of food you get. I got the *chipotle chicken pasta* and it was really yummy. Sweet and spicy and not too much sauce. Overall, a very pleasant experience here with great food. Always a fan of their warm soft bread yummmm"
Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, United States",293,518,1894,4.0,1/8/2013,"NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY GONE WRONG - THOUGHT IT'D BE A SWEET DAY Instead, I was stuck in an elevator for 45 minutes... This location is on the 8th floor of Macys. I entered the elevator, excited as can be to celebrate the debut of the new Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake (plus 50% off any slice!), only to find myself so close, yet so far from satisfying my sweet tooth. The elevator inched upwards to the restaurant, when suddenly, I hear something very similar to a large piece of metal falling. Next thing I know, the elevator stops, but the doors refuse to open. The innermost set of doors shakes before opening, but the outermost doors only slightly part. As people try to pry the doors open, another piece of metal seems to fall, giving the terrifying idea that the elevator is falling apart. We all look at the max capacity sign: 10 people max. We count exactly 10 in the elevator. One person attempts to press the button for help, but to no avail. Great. Panic strikes as first, one girl states she is claustrophobic, another constantly complains it is getting hotter and harder to breathe. Definitely a harrowing experience. We shout for help at people passing by, but it takes a long time before someone finally calls the fire department. Now what? Well of course, in this new age of technology, everyone whips out their smart phone to take photos and videos to post online. Sigh. #instagraminsteadofcallforhelp Eventually, we were saved. I'm very grateful the elevator did not drop, I'm not a roller coaster fan, at all. The manager Christopher M. was super nice and considerate, offering to take care of my meal and often checking to see how I was doing. Living out my name, I felt like a true desserts princess! He recommended starting with the Strawberry Martini to calm my nerves, a deliciously strong yet sweet drink. Then I had the Steak Diane, which was perfectly cooked. Juicy and well-seasoned. Also had Mai Tai, which comes in an interesting glass and looks quite tropical. Finally, ended with the featured S'mores Cheesecake, which had amazingly gooey, toasted marshmallow and was not overwhelmingly sweet. At this location, the ceilings are not as high as the other locations I've frequented. However, there's a patio with a nice view of Union Square (plus pigeons walking around your feet and hopelessly staring at your food). My only complaints (minus the elevator experience, which really wasn't Cheesecake Factory's fault): The indoor floors are slippery, and my group did not receive the complimentary bread until our entrees arrived. Incredible meal and friendly service (thank you so very much Christopher!), but what a night! Still a Cheesecake Factory fan nonetheless. Lesson learned: Take the stairs/escalator, TRUST ME."
Evie B.,"Livonia, United States",202,407,51,4.0,1/8/2013,"Typically I do not like chain restaurants - usually mediocre food at inflated prices BUT this place was very enjoyable. Got there early enough so that we didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes. Our waiter was a little cool at first, but quickly warmed up- engaging and friendly- quick. Pacing of food was good. I hate when you order multiple courses and they come all at once- but they kept a nice pace. Chicken taquitos were yummy- served hot and flavorable. Caesar salad- fresh, crisp, but lacking in dressing- request extra dressing on side- also ask for small dinner Caesar which isn't listed on the menu. Shrimp platter- hot- fresh and abundant! Cooked to perfection. Served with fries and coleslaw( not just a tbsp). All good Chicken piccata - yummy- 2-3 thin seasoned slices of chicken- yummy piccata sauce, served with noodles- little over cooked and dried out. Chicken Madeira - yummy yummy sauce, thin slices of chicken, served with mashed potato- dry. Cheesecake slices/ ohhhhhh myyyyyy goooooodness! Freaking delish! Huge huge slices. We had to get them to go and eat 3 hours later! Lol The prices are steep... 3-4$ higher than what they should be..I think each dish avg. $18... Which didn't inc. the option of soup or salad. Maybe these were SF prices (as all restaurants in that area were steep $) I hear they are opening one in novi mi... I hope so!"
Rick L.,"Carson City, United States",39,152,218,4.0,27/7/2013,"Good food, we sat on the patio on the roof. It was nice. There was a pigeon getting all the scraps on the floor. The service was a little slow.  But they were busy. We always like the food at these restaurants.  I have never eaten at this location.  It is in Macy's. on the top floor.  Cheese cake is good and the salads are great."
Nick B.,"San Leandro, United States",111,190,99,4.0,25/7/2013,"So Macy's Women's in Union square doubles as a food court, a bakery, a Starbucks, a Burger joint and finally Cheesecake Factory. It's got a beautiful view of the city from the patio and price and food quality is consistent with all other Cheesecake Factories. Wait time wasn't that much longer than any other of their locations which was surprising considering all the foreigners wearing backpacks and speaking French, Japanese and a host of other languages. Bravo!"
Jabez J.,"Oakland, United States",21,115,48,4.0,22/7/2013,"We went to the SF Union Square Cheesecake Factory yesterday, which was a windy Sunday evening.  The restaurant was packed!  There were several tourists milling around.  Some were willing to sit outside on the rooftop because to them the weather was not bad at 55 degrees (SF Style).  For others we wanted an inside seat.  Well after 50 minutes we were seated outside which got colder so we decided that we now wanted to sit inside.  Our host, Kameron Burroughs was definitely accommodating he was able to get us an inside seat within 20 minutes.  Additionally, he got us bread, butter and water to start until our waiter was able to attend to us.   Our food was delicious from the Chicken Madera to the Chicken Samosa, however, the spinach and cheese dip was not flavorful and the chips were stale.  The manager came immediately and remedied the problem because he replaced my dish with another Chicken Samosa and he did not charge us for the 2nd order.  Despite the cold, windy atmosphere, unflavorful dish and long wait it was well worth it.  Oh and BTW our Dulce and Dutch Apple Strussel Cheesecakes were delicious. Highly recommended."
Gregory N.,"Morgan Hill, United States",182,269,,4.0,21/7/2013,"It's a chain, so you know what you're going to get:  good but overpriced, spicey food.  Cheesecake is to die for.  But this one off Union Square is unique due to the 8th story view over Union Square."
Alice K.,"Springfield, United States",23,10,6,4.0,19/7/2013,"I went there a while ago with one of my friends and we were waiting for like 45 mins and couldn't get the seat yet. So, we didn't want to wait anymore and left. I went there again with another friend of mine at 11:30noon on Tuesday and it was already packed. Luckily no wait at all. We took the seat from outside as it was nice weather and quite nice to see union square. They have a huge menu and couldn't even decide what to choose. The customer service is very good. I ordered Miso Salmon lunch portion and it was quite big, I couldn't even finish it.  It was soooo goooood and I was like no wonder this place is always packed. Worth every penny there. :D We ordered Tiramisu cheesecake as in desserts. That was a cheesecake to die for.   :D"
Bakulia K.,"San Francisco, United States",4,23,,4.0,11/7/2013,"I love food here, its very light and easy and delicious, the only thing is you have to wait forever to get a table. Once Ive waited literally an hour. And its very crowded."
Sumalatha R.,"Elkhart, United States",9,14,,4.0,9/7/2013,"Good food, generous portions and great dining experience in this restaurant."
Danielle S.,"Sacramento, United States",136,202,15,4.0,5/7/2013,"For the most part a Cheesecake Factory is a Cheesecake Factory is a Cheesecake Factory. This Cheesecake Factory, however, is an exception due to the location. Perched atop the Macy's in Union Square they have a great patio for you to take in the beautiful view! If it's cold (it IS SF afterall), they do have some heaters to make your visit more comfortable. There is always a super long wait and the lobby area is quite the cluster f, but once you're seated you are greeted with an expansive menu of delicious food including a new lower calorie menu. I've never read a bad meal here and this visit was no exception. The Caesar salad is one of my personal favorites and I decided on the lettuce wraps to compliment the salad with a Long Island ice tea to finish off the meal. The server was perfectly attentive and I appreciated his suggestions. If you are visiting the city and looking for nice view, this is the place for you!"
Tan H.,"San Jose, United States",0,33,,4.0,1/7/2013,"I dont know why they call it a cheesecake factory if they make BURGERS,FRIES,AND THE CHEESECAKE SO DELICIOUS! i will definitely come back for more"
Eline M.,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",2,8,,4.0,24/6/2013,"Oeh.. I love this place!! I stayed 2 months in San Francisco and I've visited the Cheesecake Factory a lot!!!  The burgers, chicken, pastas, cheesecakes.. everything is really good! (Especially the famous Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake. :) )  The prices are ok, the service is good and the view is amazing if you have a seat outside. The only con - is, that it's always crowded. You've to wait a long time for your table. Most of the time (at least) 45 minutes.."
Cindy L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,14,11,4.0,20/6/2013,"Today was my first time at TCF and it was delicious (at least some of it was). FOOD (3/5): I ordered a Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. The noodles were a bit hard and didn't seem ""fully"" cooked or at least cooked to a level where they didn't taste like starch. The sauce was kinda watter-y and not as delicious as I had previously envisioned prior to ordering it. Had a bite of the chicken and wasn't really feeling it. Wasn't the best fettuccine, and way overpriced. Wouldn't order again. The only thing that has me coming back for more is the cheesecake. I've had my fair share of cheesecakes from local bakeries to storebought, and TCF's cheesecake is just AMAZING. I had a caramel de leche cheesecake. It tasted a little bit like heaven. It wasn't too sweet and was very smooth. The whipped cream added an excellent touch and presented the cheesecake in a very elegant way. Although it was a bit pricey for me ($6-7 per slice), it was SO GOOD I'm willing to come back more! AMBIENCE (4/5):  My friends and I did not have to wait at all for seating inside (which was great), however I would recommend others to sit outside as the view is stunning. Wasn't too loud and tables were pretty evenly spaced for me so I didn't feel too confined or stuffed.  SERVICE (4/5): Waiter was very friendly and helpful. Gave us nice suggestions since my friends and I were all first-timers at TCF.  OVERALL: 4/5 I think I'm probably being pretty generous with a 4 star review but I swear for all cheesecake lovers you MUST try TCF. The food wasn't so great for me, but hey I only got pasta so maybe I'll come back and try something new next time and update my review. All in all- good service, nice setting, and mouth watering cheesecake :)"
