Winnie H.,"San Francisco, United States",2,7,,4.0,20/6/2013,"This is thee place to be when you're enjoying the holiday spirit of downtown SF. I've always come here at least once in the winter time and have received consistent good service. There's something about the ambience that makes you feel at ease and helps you savor the food.  Compared to other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in San Jose/Walnut Creek/Santa Clara/Santana Row, the food and service are similar. But the location, being at the top floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square, is a major plus to the experience."
Cath M.,"San Francisco, United States",319,1086,1075,4.0,15/6/2013,"**TAKE-OUT ONLY** Came here this past Wednesday night to get desserts... just making it time before they closed. Service was prompt even though I could see the eyes of the employees that they were all tired...  * Pineapple Upside cheesecake  * Godiva Chocolate cheesecake * Original cheesecake My favorite of the three was the original! I know, I was shocked myself. I think I was just overwhelmed with the sweetness of the other two. The original was creamy and was just right. I dreaded the gym the next day but... here's to living aloha!"
Ryan M.,"San Leandro, United States",441,35,3,4.0,3/6/2013,"If it wasn't for the friendliness of the hosts and the deliciousness of the food and cheesecake, this place would be getting a much lower score. Honestly, the wait isn't really worth it. My party of 8 had to wait over 2 hours for a seat. (We went around 5:45.) I mean I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the wait is just ridiculous. It might've been just our big party because the few times I went before our party had 2 people. (They told us the wait would be an hour and a half, but we just waited half an hour. So I hoped it'd happen this time! But it didn't sadly.)  On to the food. I had the Hibachi steak. I wasn't really sure what it was, but I trusted the Factory. The steak was already cut up (I like to actually cut my own steaks) and was marinated a lot with their sauce. It tasted great. The sauce was awesome too. My friends couldn't finish their plates so I just dipped their food into my left over sauce and it was delicious!  I shared a tiramisu cheesecake. I normally don't eat tiramisu just because I don't like the taste. But for some reason mixing it into a cheesecake makes it that much better.  I'd recommend this place, but if you don't want to eat at 9:30, come around 5 or 5:30. Get here early or you're having a late dinner."
Emilse P.,"Richmond, United States",20,19,6,4.0,9/5/2013,"I hope you're not starving! Because if you are, you're better off buying a hotdog from the guy around the corner (they're not so bad). I don't understand why a place with such popularity hasn't expanded to another floor. I was here at the beginning of December, I don't know if wait time is ever any less than 2 hours. I must say that those pagers don't always work & I know it's busy but the hosts aren't very attentive, I had to walk up & ask if it was our turn yet, and our names weren't even written down. Or maybe they got crossed out?  We sat directly across the host's booth and they never called us. I was content with how they handled the situation though. They host apologized, took the pager & took us to a table. Not a place to bring strollers. We had to fold it up & lay in across a chair so the waiters could walk by. The food was great! Everything was delicious & the prices are not extremely high. I will be visiting again soon!"
Eliza F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,49,80,4.0,26/4/2013,"This review is solely for the cheesecake. BEST. CHEESECAKE. EVER. This is by far the best best best cheesecake I've ever had! But, at 7+ dollars PER SLICE, it's probably the most expensive slice of anything I've ever had.  Worth it to try, especially if you're in the area! Went at 10:30pm so there weren't a ton of people, which was nice as I can imagine how busy this place gets on weekends!"
Jeromy G.,"Foster City, United States",602,660,1032,4.0,22/4/2013,"I like coming here. We come here often when we are in the city mainly because when were are done shopping or running our errands its the only good thing open that is close by. It sucks that when it's late they shut down the Macy's where there are couches we sit on while waiting to be seated. There is always a long wait so be prepared, don't come starving because you will die. Anyway it's nice because it's up high in union square and it's just a fantastic view so that's something real special. The food is always consistent and tasty when we get it so that is nice. They have a large menu with different food choices so you can find something you like or just try something new. The bread is always warm and good, the only place where I will pick wheat over white bread. The service is just ok because there are so many people to take care of but the food is good. We usually get the steak diane and the sides are always done right so I don't mess with consistency once it starts to deteriorate I will try something else but until then I stick with a classic. Good date place if you are in a time crunch to find a place to eat, good default place to have as a backup plan."
Alex C.,"San Francisco, United States",75,141,1154,4.0,20/4/2013,"04/16/2013 Lunch in one hour? Not impossible, doable, one just needs to eat quickly and scadaddle!  Service is extremely attentive, and they will certainly meet your needs - I told my waitress that I only had an hour to eat, and she made sure that I got my good as quickly as possible. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (just as good as I remember it), and a glass of Moscato (MMMMMMM, sweet and satisfy). I also sat near the bar area, therefore, I was immediately waited on. My food came out 15 minutes into service, and with eating, I had 10 minutes to spare - see, it's possible to dine within an hours of lunch on a work day! Yes, this is a chain restaurant, a very good one in fact, and I don't mind being a repeat customer."
Nora F.,"San Diego, United States",405,235,45,4.0,15/4/2013,"This cheesecake factory is one you have to go to! I don't frequent all of the other ones because their menu is overwhelming and their drinks are overpriced.  This one's view was just beautiful.  You look out of the window and you see all of San Fran.  We ordered a few items from the fit and fare menu and I think it's better than their regular menu.  The only issue was that one of the orders should have been made vegetarian but there was meat in it when it came out.  But the waiter took care of everything and it ended being comped anyway.  Their veggie burger is just amazing, you have to try it once."
Mike P.,"San Jose, United States",17,58,4,4.0,1/4/2013,"Always super packed, but never lacks on the service. Usually a long wait but stepping outside to see the amazing view is a great way to pass the time. Never a lack of good food to choose from."
Sonny W.,"Fremont, United States",19,375,189,4.0,22/3/2013,always always always a long wait but service is pretty good and i just LOVE the dark bread...always asking for seconds.   They also treat the kids well and get a plastic cup with straw.  Booths are roomy  and portions are big.  And dessert! I think they load the food with grease or butter cuz after lunch I did not need to eat dinner....ate the next day....
Wendy A.,"San Francisco, United States",15,2,,4.0,7/3/2013,Godiva chocolate cheese cake is to die for.. Service is good but there are always a lot of people dining in so you'll have to wait.
Jason F.,"Vacaville, United States",4,32,9,4.0,19/2/2013,"1500+ reviews ,so it's not hard to see this place is popular. Eat outside at night ,they have heaters. Great view of Union Square and downtown area. I had the pork chops and they were better than average. Great list of desserts and of course cheesecake of all varieties . Nice friendly staff."
Amanda R.,"San Francisco, United States",92,162,4,4.0,5/2/2013,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory multiple times, and they have always been on their game. On the most recent visit, we were in a time crunch because we had to get to a show in an hour, and our servers were very accommodating and helped us get in and out. I love that they have the Skinnylicious menu now, although I don't see how those portions could really only have 600 calories or less. I'll take it though if that's really the case. I get something different every time, but my food has always been good. I love that you can get Italian, Mexican, and Asian food all in one restaurant. It's not going to be gourmet or perfect cuisine, but it does the job. I of course love the cheesecake too, but I try to abstain whenever I have the willpower."
Joe C.,"Newport Beach, United States",14,172,,4.0,23/1/2013,"Prepare to wait if you go around lunch time. I ordered the ""Seared Tuna Tataki Salad"". The salad and tuna are very delicious. My friend ordered the ""Grilled Rib-Eye Steak"" and it was great tasting as well. We really enjoyed our lunch here. I understand how people are complaining about the pigeons walking/flying around, but that's the joy of nature and sitting outside. Will definitely return. :)"
Emily T.,"Los Angeles, United States",554,260,613,4.0,14/1/2013,"I had a wonderful time here with my daddy on a Wednesday afternoon. We found everything to be delightful. The host told us the wait was going to be over 30minutes, turned out to be only 15 minutes. Some may say that's simply killing time, but be real...you're there for the ambiance not the food.  I'm sure everyone knows what the Cheesecake Factory is all about. It's a tablecloth and linen sort of place, with a large catalogue-like menu and very cheap yet bountiful plates of pasta. You can get the same type of service and food anywhere, but what sets this Union Square location apart from the rest if the heated patio seating.  I usually order the jambalaya cajun pasta dish, and a plate of red velvet cheesecake to top everything off. But their breakfast sandwiches were great too, with a generous portion of salad and soup. I'm also a HUGE fan of their complimentary whole wheat bread."
David C.,"San Francisco, United States",3,26,,4.0,6/1/2013,"The herb salmon they have is pretty good. The herbs gives that salmon fillet an extra ""bam""! The second thing they have here that's worth coming here for is of course, their signature Cheesecake.  Although I've read from reviews and heard from my personal friends that this place wait for the food is LONG, but I guess luckily for me I just came at the right time. This place is located in Union Square (Macy's) and to get here you literally take the elevator. Great view depending where your seated, which is the reason why it's crowded during the day from all the tourists."
Kinner J.,"Napa, United States",41,145,43,4.0,3/1/2013,Love coming here for the grilled salmon lunch! It is very hard to resist the delicious cheesecake!!! TIP: Eat early or late because the wait can get VERY LONG. We came during the peak of the lunch hour and waited more than 30 minutes for an inside table. I have come in the past at odd hours and been seated almost immediately. If you go out onto the patio there are great views of Union Square. At Christmas time it is fun to look at all the lights and the large tree. When indulging I really like to get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake -- if you like chocolate you won't be disappointed!!! They also have seasonal cheesecakes that are very good (summer = mango keylime!)
Amy Y.,"San Francisco, United States",114,81,83,4.0,30/12/2012,"The 4 stars only goes to the cheesecake. Step 1: Go into Macy's main entrance across from Union Square Step 2: Turn to your right and wait for the elevator Step 3: Once inside elevator, go to 8th floor If you are only here for Cheesecake, go to step 5 If not, Step 4: Go to the left to the mai'tre D and wait at least an hour. (go downstairs one floor to sit on the Macy's furniture if too crowded in the lobby) Step 5: Go to the right and order a slice of cheesecake! (Or 2) ***Cheesecake: Less cheesy and more on the creamy side.  900 CALORIES PER SLICE!! Share it with your honey ;) More sweet/tart depending on the cheesecake. Ranges from Key Lime to Red Velvet. ***Enjoy the view outside (don't have to eat to see it)"
Linnea H.,"Pacifica, United States",73,165,,4.0,15/12/2012,"This was my face when I logged onto Yelp and saw that The Cheesecake Factory had only 3 stars with 1526 reviews- O___O Yeah, there's always a wait. I don't really expect anything else since it's in, essentially, the heart of San Francisco. You know, where the tourists go?  Anyways, my friend and I, or my mom and I, come here when we are not in any hurry and would like to spend the evening in San Francisco. They have outdoor seating so you can enjoy your meal with a great view of Union Square.  When my mom and I went yesterday, it was an hour wait. They called us at exactly 1  hour on the dot. While waiting, we had a glass of wine and went outside to enjoy the view. We were thinking of taking the escalator down to browse Macy's while we waited, but decided against it.  Once we were seated, our waitress was pleasant and the food arrived promptly and was delicious. We were in and out of there quickly since, during our hour wait, we looked at their menus and knew exactly what we wanted by the time we were seated. Seemed like the most logical idea at the time. Overall I had a good experience- like always."
Justin L.,"San Jose, United States",280,51,42,4.0,7/12/2012,At this cheesecake factory they have a balcony sitting area that overlooks union square and we always wanted to sit there. The wait time wasnt that bad for a wednesday night and we had seats right by the edge. Our waiter was new to the job but he did a great job. He was friendly and he hooked it up with extra bread for us to take home.
