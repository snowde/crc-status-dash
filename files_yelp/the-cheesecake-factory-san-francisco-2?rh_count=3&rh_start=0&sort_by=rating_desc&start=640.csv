Tram N.,"San Jose, United States",542,350,1174,4.0,30/11/2012,"I can count the number of times I've been here on one hand, and it's because I never crave for Cheesecake Factory. It's nice to go for special occasions even though this place isn't all that special to me. The last time I came here, I was greeted by the beautiful Union Square tree lighting. It was such a gorgeous view of Union Square and I believe this time of year is the best time of year to come dine here! Crab and Aritichoke dip: AMAZING! Big enough for two people. I love the slices of toasted french bread that comes with it. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp: Huge portion. I added soy sauce to this and it became so much better. I think I didn't exactly like the balance of the toasted coconut with salty chicken. Kind of threw off my palette especially since I am a savory person. Tropical margarita: Amazing! Although, the tequila made my stomach hurt. That's not faulty of Cheesecake at all, though. Smokehouse BBQ Burger: The beau really loved this burger. He brought home left overs and ate it while it's cold and said it was still good! That's when you know you got a great burger. The meat was cooked to perfection, as asked. I thought everything was reasonably priced for the amount of food we had."
Carol C.,"Alameda, United States",198,883,6321,4.0,23/11/2012,"This is almost an annual ritual for my sisters and me to dine at the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday and then head to SF Chinatown. Check in time:  11:57 AM.  I was told by a young gentleman at the front registration desk that the wait would be approximately one hour and ten minutes.  Okay, I will wait for that duration.  It's understandable as the place was packed ""to the rafters""...awww...j/k.   Pager buzzed and flashed at 12:17 PM...wow a 20 minutes wait...not bad at all; I was seated at 12:20 PM.  Oldest sister was a few floors down in one of the department making a purchase.  Waiter was cool that we weren't all seated yet.   We're ready to order at 12:55 PM...not the fabulous waiter's fault that there was about a half hour delay.  Jason was very attentive and friendly.  He was prompt in serving whatever we ordered.  He periodically checked and inquired whether everything was okay. My sisters had the strawberry and raspberry lemonades...too sweet and they diluted them.  I decided to go with the Arnold Palmer.  Green tea is not a choice of tea to complement lemonade...restaurant does not serve it in this manner.  Choice was either black tea or passionfruit tea.  Okay - passionfruit tea with the lemonade - 3.25 stars (taste and presentation)...too bad this was not the Arnold Palmer from the Westside Club at the   Coliseum. Garlic noodles - spaghettini with fresh asparagas, shiitake mushroom, sun ripened tomato, topped with parmesan cheese...dish needed more garlic flavoring...3.5 stars. Barbecue ranch chicken salad - one of our favorite salads on the menu...4 stars. Dessert:  We wanted something different from our usual tiramisu.  One mango key lime cheesecake, please, for three people to share.  Quite delicious - subtle sweetness of the mango combined with the right amount of tartness of the key lime, graham cracker laced with shredded coconut...4.5 stars."
Alaric S.,"Walnut Creek, United States",22,74,542,4.0,4/11/2012,"The service will NEVER improve here. After coming here for years, the service has always been stagnant. Its best if you bring a date, or a small group of friends so that time passes by quicker. Tried the bbq chix pizza and had the coconut chocolate mousse cheesecake, twas bomb. There was an out of town couple that was courteous enough to let us order drinks at the bar, and as we were waiting, an asian couple sits down, NOT by the host, and takes over a couple who was getting ready to leave, and jumps ahead of everyone else who was going to wait 45-60 for a table. Had to give it a 4-star cuz, we were there til' late, not cause of the service, but my friends and I were catching up. Everyone had left when we were just getting started lol."
Sofia R.,"San Francisco, United States",572,667,2522,4.0,1/11/2012,"My brother took me out for lunch here one day....partly because he's never been to Cheesecake Factory before. I've only been to a Cheesecake Factory once before and I remember thinking that my experience was average (food wise). This time wasn't that different.  This branch is a lot busier than others simply because it's located in downtown San Francisco.The wait was about 30 minutes but we just went downstairs to look at the furniture. Be wary of wandering out of the restaurant floor because the little machine they give you while you wait might not receive the signal to alert you. There were three of us: me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We eat a lot, so we ordered a lot. We got stuffed mushrooms and fried mac n cheese balls for appetizer, we each got huge dishes for meals (I ordered the tomato basil pasta), and two of us each got cheesecake slices.  The appetizers were okay. The stuffed mushrooms were not to my liking (small and not really stuffed) and the fried mac n cheese was too salty for my taste like the last time I had it. My pasta was very bland. The ahi tuna salad thing my sister-in-law got was boring without the tuna. The mushroom swiss burger my brother got was good but not memorable. Pretty average. The cheesecakes were good. My brother got the chocolate coconut cream and I got pumpkin pecan. His was good but I felt like the coconut taste was artificial. My pumpkin pecan was good.  I would recommend...it's just a very heavy cheesecake. All cheesecakes there are heavy.  Overall, food was whatever. I don't mind too much because I didn't pay for it at the time.  I added an extra star only because the service was really great and it should be noted."
Rose F.,"San Ramon, United States",101,27,9,4.0,25/10/2012,I love the Cheesecake Factory not only for it's delicious cheesecakes. I think their food is even better than the cakes. I love the interior design inside the cheesecake factory. Prices are a little bit expensive but for sure it worth the quality of the food and the nice environment you sit. One great aspect of cheesecake factory is their waiters and waitresses. They are so so so great. I am sure that their management has selected their staff very carefully. The only problem is that the tables are so close to each other so sometimes I feel there is not much privacy and everybody can hear what I am talking. Other than this I have no other problem with this lovely place.
Joanna S.,"San Francisco, United States",2,17,,4.0,23/10/2012,"I love eating here. The staff is very nice and accommodating (  for my friend's 23rd birthday dinner, I asked them to secretly decorate a cheesecake for her and it was a success! )   I love the food here! I definitely recommend the Jambalaya pasta, miso salmon, and the pasta da vinci. The portions here are huge! I am always stuffed and I never finish my entree. I always order the cheesecake to go though! it's delish nomnomnom~"
John M.,"San Francisco, United States",5,41,1,4.0,21/9/2012,"Came here cause I was craving for some cheesecake. Just hate it every time I come here, I need to wait."
Rachel H.,"San Francisco, United States",83,399,3,4.0,25/8/2012,"This place never disappoints. The service is always top notch, and the waiters never rush you. The views are also pretty cool, especially during Christmas time. I always get three things when I come here, which are the hot caramel apple cider, the chicken di pana, and the Hershey cheesecake.  The only downside to this place is the wait time. Good thing I can shop while waiting!"
Kim D.,"Fairfield, United States",761,337,2691,4.0,14/8/2012,"Came here for lunch and left fully satisfied with PLENTY of leftovers to take home as well. I had the fettuccine chicken alfredo with sun-dried tomatoes and my friend had the chicken marsala with mushrooms over bow-tie pasta, and we were both content with our menu choices. Their lunch specials are something to look into, especially if you want to leave room for dessert.. Which you must! There's so many different kinds of cheesecake options, and they even have low carb cheesecake for those watching their diets. But I say if it's cheesecake, might as well go all the way. And you get a free slice if it's your bday!"
Michael T.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",56,97,,4.0,12/8/2012,"CHEESECAKE. I would totally order it if I didn't get full off of the food I ordered for the main course! Every time I do order cheesecake though, it just has to be the Strawberry. The Cheesecake is never heavy, but it's almost always...heaven. I ordered a smaller appetizer since I wasn't that hungry - the Avocado Egg Rolls. These were surprisingly healthy (ignore the fact they're deep fried), and the mix of avocado/tomato/onions (more like very chunky guacamole) was incredible. Even though there was no meat, these egg rolls were very filling. The Egg Rolls also come with a tamarind peanut dipping sauce - a must try with the egg rolls! Even though the wait can be long for seating (at one point people were waiting for indoor tables for 2 hours, but we chose outdoor seating where the wait time was 30 minutes), the cheesecake is definitely worth the wait. The only thing I didn't like was that the restaurant was extremely crowded and very loud, but...CHEESECAKE. It's worth it."
Karen C.,"Las Vegas, United States",0,4,,4.0,9/8/2012,"My friend and I had dinner here late in the evening on a recent trip to San Francisco.  After some confusion about where the restaurant was located and some very amusing attempts by us to locate it using our smartphones, we realized it was located upstairs in Macy's in Union Square.  We feared they would be closed since it was around 9 pm and a Thursday night but they were open and packed! We asked for first available seating which turned out to be outdoors and perfectly lovely, just a little chilly.  The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is because I felt their directions to us regarding seating were confusing.  When we agreed to sit outside, they did not give us the buzzer and told us to just stand to the side (near the elevators).  There were so many people and waitstaff coming an going that I feared we had gotten lost in the shuffle and would not be called.  After a little arguing with my friend, he assured me that we would be called soon.  And he was right, we were called in about 10 minutes, as soon as they had cleared a table for us.  Had we wanted to sit inside, I'm sure we would have waited much much longer. The night was lovely and foggy, but that's perfect San Francisco.  The view of Union Square was great from the upstairs balcony. We both ordered salmon.  My friend tried the bar-b-que salmon and I had the herbed salmon.  It was wonderful and juicy.  My friend also had a strawberry lemonade which he said was really really good.  You could see the strawberry seeds floating in his glass.  Yum! Unfortunately we were too full to try any cheesecake, which I really wanted my friend to try.  But, maybe next time.  Their portions are large enough that sometimes you need to come to The Cheesecake Factory just for dessert. We would certainly eat here again."
Rex X.,"Berkeley, United States",42,63,92,4.0,4/8/2012,"Half off cheesecake, what what?! Totally there! I invited along my international friend and the two of us set out for the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. The line to get into the elevator was pretty long, so we had to wait a round before we got in. We arrived at the host counter around 6:15pm, and we were told that the wait would be 35 minutes. Not bad!  When we came back, our buzzer vibrated at 35 minutes on the dot, and we were seated outside. Both of us were starving, but we decided to share an appetizer and main dish because 1. I don't eat very much 2. we were told to expect large portions and 3. to save room for cheesecake. That ended up being the wisest decision of the night. We finished their complimentary bread (I prefer the darker ones, very nomnomie), gobbled down the appetizer (avocado rolls, absolutely heavenly), and by the time our main dish arrived we were forced to slow down else risk stomach explosion. My only gripe about our experience at the restaurant was that the servers seemed to be assigned to specific tables, and our particular server was especially busy juggling several tables inside and outside. Thus, when we needed anything, we had to wait until she was available to get her attention. There were literally four servers behind the staff area out on the patio all of 20 feet away from our table staring at us as we tried to signal for the check, and none of them moved. I can understand that the tip we leave won't go to them, but really?  We ordered a cheesecake slice to share (lemon raspberry) and I bought another (red velvet) for a friend. The cheesecake tasted amazing, but is very, very rich, and given the state of our stomachs, we had a very hard time finishing it. I ended up taking most of my slice home. The red velvet slice came in a box literally triple the size of the one that we had to pack away the lemon raspberry. My butthead of a friend decided to not come and claim it for a week, thus effectively occupying one shelf in my fridge for a good 6 days -____-. I obviously need new friends."
Vincent C.,"Imperial Beach, United States",19,60,4,4.0,3/8/2012,"I love cheesecakes... especially when they're half off! Okay, maybe that was irrelevant, but they're half off during ""National Cheesecake Day"" -- dine in only and limit of one! Anyway, I really dislike big restaurant chains... but who can resist Cheesecake Factory?! I've been to a lot of locations and this one is probably THE best location. I mean, c'mon, rooftop location, seeing the skyscrapers, chill weather, sun's out? Yes, it's awesome. So make sure you pick balcony/outdoor seating. Makes everything better. In addition to the location, their servers were great here. I love GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE as always :) We had two different wait staff because one had to go on a break, but they were both great. Checked up on us frequently, refilled our waters, asked if we needed anything else. Great! The wait can be long sometimes here, but this location is huge and it can accommodate a lot. The waiting area might be cramped sometimes, but be patient! Food is a little expensive here, but it is well worth it. Main dishes like pastas are usually good for two (or 1.5)... just eat their bread (which is complimentary and good with black vinegar + olive oil too!). For my main dish, I got pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes... soooo good (even after taking home and reheating it!). For cheesecake, I got the new OREO DREAMblahblah CHEESECAKE! Thick and creamy. Yum. Would go back, especially if there's a special occasion. Visit this place when you're in SF and hungry! :) No reservations... unless you have a big group, they might let you make a reservation."
Lee P.,"Winchester, United States",54,597,1417,4.0,26/7/2012,"Great family dining venue....even with the crowd we encountered on both occasions we went, we were seated within the wait time we were told.  The sheer size of the menu can be daunting but we were all very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. More importantly the staff were very attentive, efficient,and friendly making dining in the great big hall a pleasant experience!"
Marvin C.,"San Francisco, United States",100,46,41,4.0,26/7/2012,I came here a couple times just went yesterday for my girls birthday. We were told the wait was 20 - 25 mins only waited 10 mins to get seated and yes they were busy like always guess we got lucky. Our waitress was very nice and polite. The food was pretty good big portions and the cheesecake is always delicious. I thought it was hilarious how the workers came up singing happy bday to my girl. Overall we had a good time. Plenty of food to choose from and the view is real nice.
Tim M.,"San Francisco, United States",114,125,36,4.0,24/7/2012,"I have to give this place better than 3 stars because Ive been here numerous times without a problem. Besides the fact that you cant make a reservation, this place in downtown-union square is nice. If you go for brunch I would recommend the eggs benedict or something along the lines of that... maybe a florentine (or w/e they call it there). They make a good benedict in my opinion. For lunch I usually order a salad/soup with a sandwich or Im feeling healthy and get one of their chicken plates. A side of creamy mashed potatoes is good too!  And DONT, i repeat DONT, forget to order one of their smoothies. Yeah, theyre expensive at $5-6 but theyre damn good! I always order one when I go there no matter what. They come with some skewered fresh fruits so I guess its all worth it 0.o Last but definitely not least is their outdoor seating that overlooks union square. Great view. If youre with 2-4 people than ask to be seated outside on a nice day, you'll enjoy it. Not sure if tourist know about the outdoor seating before hand but now you do!"
Philly S.,"Oakland, United States",10,53,,4.0,22/7/2012,"Nice food, expensive cheesecakes. Had 4 burgers and a salad, overall it was good, but not perfect."
Laurens D.,"Walnut Creek, United States",160,89,7,4.0,16/7/2012,"Like any other restaurant, this place has gotten so much hype, but doesn't always deliver. Yes it is a nice restaurant, plenty to choose from on the menu, but the service can be hit and miss, depending on the location. If you've ever been to The Cheesecake Factory, you know it's never empty. The San Francisco location is my favourite, especially the outside patio that over looks Union Square, which on a nice summer afternoon/evening, can be a very pleasant eating experience.... sometimes if you are lucky enough, you have the pleasure of eating with San Francisco's finest... the seagulls. Despite their being two Cheesecake Factories with in 25 minutes of me, I still choose to go to the San Francisco one. I love a busy restaurant, as long as the location and ambience is nice. I always go for the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta, but from word of mouth, I've heard that almost anything is good. Their portions are big, sometimes a little too big, and their cheescakes are divine, I have just about tasted every one of them, and they have yet to disappointment in terms of taste, presentation and overall satisfaction."
Jim L.,"San Francisco, United States",63,68,49,4.0,11/7/2012,Some mad chicken samosas and that cilantro sauce was a treat too. Always dine outdoors under the stars and 8 stories above the crowds. Did you know they close at midnight on weekends? Freakin recession does crazy things to business but I'm lovin it. Just don't bring your kids here unless you tie them down because that ledge is short and one of these days one of them is gonna bounce off.
