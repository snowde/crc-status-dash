Maile N.,"San Francisco, United States",287,1464,857,4.0,4/7/2012,"This place is always crazy busy!  In fact, I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory across the country at anytime of the day when they weren't crazy busy.  Either get in line to put your name and party number down and deal with the wait of at least 30 minutes or try to get a seat in the bar area. Love their Chinese chicken salad - lovely, tasty, piled high with rice noodles!!  Perfect with a mojito in the summertime!!  Oh and don't forget to get cheesecake to go because I don't know about you, but I am always too full to eat dessert but I still want it - for later!!  Mmmm! P.S.  It felt so good to finally use the $25 gift card for Cheesecake Factory today!"
J P.,"Minneapolis, United States",0,9,,4.0,29/6/2012,Good Restaurant and super good service. I got there on prime time about 7PM on Friday evening and they still got is a table fairly quickly and the server was good as well. She stopped by many times to see how we were doing and if we need anything. Food was on time and was good. They need to reduce there prices though; for 2 people we ended up spending about $70 for just dinner and one drink. Its expensive but good location and good service.
Christine M.,"San Francisco, United States",479,607,210,4.0,26/6/2012,"im on the fence about this place....always so packed and crowded and everyone wants to go here...why!??!? i would remember when we would try to do big groups and have fancy dinners here....food wasn't memorable but just a nice atmosphere maybe? drinks were yummy.  came here today for lunch and got to sit outside and it was so nice out! calamari- decent, first bite was extremely salty for some reason, but normal after that. mushroom flatbread- yum, just like a pizza, good amount of cheese miso salmon- my bf can make this but he wanted to see if it tasted any better and it did sound good today. the sauce was good, but salmon was a lil too cooked, i like it when it breaks apart easily with your fork. thai...something noodles- peanut sauce, it was too salty sweet? not sure, but a bit overpowering.  and our waiter was great! so i added one more star! we barely ate half our meal and had to to-go it. we also had a giftcard so that was nice. but to come again...unless its the ONLY place to go...probably not"
Sara W.,"San Jose, United States",1187,579,48,4.0,30/5/2012,"There are a lot of Cheesecake Factories, but I wanted to review this one because of the outside seating on the top of the Macy's in Union Square. It's a great place, though it gets super busy and the wait can be 3 hours, maybe longer! I love the veggie burgers because they're made with beets and they're soft and the flavor is great. Good portions and good quality. I always enjoy my visits here."
Marge M.,"Hayward, United States",41,37,789,4.0,30/5/2012,"Lots of people come here and for a reason. Let me just get it out of the way. The cheesecake is to die for, almost each and every one of them. My favorite, the turtle cheesecake. Yumdiliyumcious! And, the view is amazing if you get to sit outside. Food (quality and size) and service is 3.5-4 stars. Having said that, expect to wait for awhile if you're visiting on a weekend when the place is commonly packed. Weekdays are less crowded except for lunch hours. If you're by yourself or have a friend with you, go straight to the bar where you'll have no problem finding a seat."
Aneesh P.,"San Francisco, United States",2,14,1,4.0,22/5/2012,"I love their pastas, and cheesecakes. Only thing is sometimes your host take things for granted. This weekend  we were there for lunch, and ordered stuff from lunch menu. Finally, when it arrived it was the full regular one. These are HUGE potions. So, make sure that you tell them clearly ""LUNCH"". This is probably due to the sheer volume of customers they have but costed us extra $15. Any time past 2pm is good to get in for lunch, so that you don't have to wait in q."
Diana B.,"San Diego, United States",13,44,1,4.0,12/5/2012,"After a long day of shopping in Union Square, my fave thing to do is come up here and get a cosmo.  Best cosmo anywhere, and I only drink them here because they are consistently yummy.  The hot spinach dip is really good.  I don't want to know how may calories are in it though.  Ignorance is bliss."
Susan C.,"Oakland, United States",0,1,1,4.0,7/5/2012,The food is really great! I recommend the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip and the Tex Mix Eggrolls as appetizers. Amazingly good! I usually order pasta from here. I LOVE the Chicken Ramona in White Sauce. So DELICIOUSSSS.  The only Con about this place is the long wait. The food is worth it though.
Andrew A.,"San Francisco, United States",113,35,,4.0,1/5/2012,"Awesome food at an even better price. Just make sure you eat before you get on the wait list.  I've literally put my name down on the list just to go back to Union Square for happy hour at a nearby restaurant. After loading up on drinks and appetizers, we proceeded back to Westfield to kill some time. After we finished walking around, we went back to Macys to walk around some more. We were finally seated after a two hour wait. We started off with several appetizers including the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip, Fire-Roasted Artichoke, Thai Lettuce Wraps, and Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. The Fire-Roasted Artichoke put the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip to shame, but both were pleasant. I don't know why we ordered two sets of chips and dips.The Thai Lettuce wrap was too complex for a brute like me. I refuse to pay for a meal just to make it myself. The Spicy Ahi was winner of the appetizers though. I honestly didn't expect it to be that great, but it was and more. Flipping through the menu, I noticed ""We use premium Certified Angus Beef®or American Style Kobe for all of Our Burgers"". I asked the waiter is it REAL Kobe beef? He told me yes. For $13.95, I absolutely refused to believe it was. After going back and fourth and questioning my waiter's integrity and morals, I decided I had no grounds to judge whether it was real Kobe beef or not seeing how I've never tried it. So I ordered it! My KOBE burger came and the moment of truth was in my fingertips. It wasn't Kobe beef. But don't get me wrong, it was still a solid grade A burger with some of the best fries around. But at the end of the day, it was still just regular beef. We didn't order cheesecake because a total of 7 appetizers, multiple rounds of drinks, salad/soup, and an entree was more than enough to satisfy four people (gluttony will be the death of us). The bill came out to be around 140$ between four people ordering a feast fit for a king. Not bad. Overall a good choice for a meal if you have some time on your hands. Definitely on the Must Do List when going down town for the first time."
Derek F.,"San Ramon, United States",85,85,46,4.0,1/5/2012,"I am going to simplify this for you because if you have eaten at 1 cheesecake factory, you have eaten at them all. -Long wait times -Embarrassing cocktails -Skimpy appetizers +Lunch/Dinner portions +VIEW VIEW VIEW This location is all about the view. Don't expect anything different from this place other than the view of Union Square. Cheesecake Factory in general gets a 3 from me. but the view from this place warrants a 4."
Shea S.,"Milpitas, United States",1,24,4,4.0,1/5/2012,Love Love Love....the view is awesome. Its too crowded though we had to wait half an hour which I didnt really enjoyed because I was so hungry..that's why I left out one star!Over all great food and I came home full.
Rachel E.,"Houston, United States",93,938,219,4.0,24/4/2012,"I know, 4 stars? I'm surprising even myself. But seriously, dinner at The Cheesecake Factory Friday night was really good. Service was awesome - like 5 star restaurant awesome. We never had to wait for refills, wonder where our waiter was, etc... There was a 20 minute wait so we ordered some drinks at the bar (I had the ritz martini which was DELICIOUS) and wandered outside to people watch over union square. Great view! I don't think we even had to wait the full 20 minutes before our table was ready. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad which was super tasty! And enormous...  As far as chains go, this is a really good one. Will definitely return!"
Karina N.,"San Francisco, United States",5,33,,4.0,22/4/2012,"First time going there and the service was really good (maybe it was because I beat the lunch rush, went there half an hour after it opened). I forgot our waitresses name but she was so nice and very helpful. The restaurant itself had a nice decor. The cheesecake was delicious as ever!! I could buy a tons! However, the food was only 'okay'. I ordered the Garlic Pasta with Chicken and the chicken was a little too burnt and the pasta was way too salty! My friends also ordered pasta and they said it either had too much pepper or also too salty. I would come back but maybe not for the pasta."
Osama Q.,"Sunnyvale, United States",9,24,10,4.0,14/4/2012,"This was a great experience. My best one in san francisco yet. I went on Thursday early evening and the place was already full. There was a queue but not very long. I didnt have to wait  more than 8-10 minutes to get a table which was in the patio. I ordered the avocado eggrolls for appetizer and kobe burger for the main course and ofcourse for desert, the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries and cream. everything was very good in taste. The waiters were friendly, attentive and quick. I didnt have to wait more than expected for the food to arrive and it was still hot when it arrived. All in all a great experience. Can't wait to go again!"
Cindy N.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,4.0,10/4/2012,"Love this location! On sunny days or warm nights I always opt to sit outside, the view is beautiful! Food is always good, LOVE their spinach and cheese dip."
Jenny M.,"Santa Clara, United States",6,37,19,4.0,9/4/2012,"The wait wasn't too bad for a Friday evening. I came a little early..around 6PM before the crazy dinner rush started however. My friend and I were absolutely craving the calamari so we definitely ordered that right when we sat down. They definitely lessened their portions and jacked up their price... I got the BBQ Chicken pizza which was SOOOOOO delicious. I was very surprised, but I would definitely recommend it."
Thomas D.,"San Francisco, United States",232,652,729,4.0,9/4/2012,"Had a great lunch here today after shopping at Macy's Mens' Store around the corner.  The service was excellent.  We sat in the bar area to avoid waiting for a table and couldn't have been happier there.  It's the same menu without having to wait.      I ordered the white bean hummus with seasoned pita bread strips to start things off.  I forgot how generous the serving sizes are at the Cheesecake Factory.  (The last time that I ate at one of their restaurants was last August while I was in Honolulu).   The hummus was very tasty. This starter could have fed 4 people.  We had the rest packaged up in a ""to go"" container. I had a passion fruit iced tea with my blue cheese/bacon burger.  They refilled me 3 times.  The burger was excellent and cooked medium (as I ordered it). And, it was still warm when served!  The accompanying fries were good as well. Opted for the low carb cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream for dessert.  (low carb cheesecake??--really? )                                                          I wish they had a wheelbarrow to roll me out of the restaurant when we finished lunch.  The amount of food that we ate was sinful."
Wilson T.,"San Francisco, United States",304,444,32,4.0,9/4/2012,"Little bit on the pricey side for American/Italian food but the food IS pretty good. Granted I know every meal I eat here is like a whole day's worth of calories. So the wait was really long! And when I got the table for 3, my friends hadn't arrived yet and their policy is everyone must be present. So I explained to the hostess that I was the ""boyfriend"" who had to wait in line for the ""girlfriend"" and her friend and she was super nice because she makes her boyfriend do that all the time! So good thign I saved us that table. I order a calamari appetizer and the garlic butter sauce is really good. The calamari is well fried also. My friend got the chicken alfredo which was delicious and I forget what the other one was but it looked good too. I also had a rocky road spiked shake with whiskey and liquer and it was delightful.  All in all a good meal, but even an appetizer and drink put a whole in my wallet close to $25. Pros: Good food, good service, nice view. Cons: High in calories/fat, expensive and long waits."
Erika C.,"San Francisco, United States",267,923,3169,4.0,31/3/2012,"I have had many meals here.  With a huge menu, everyone has something they can order.  The only major downside is the wait.  There is always a wait.  Four stars, however, for the cheesecake and again, the huge menu where most things taste decent. Once, the bf and I came here and we saw a young Asian guy with an elderly caucasian man.  My bf noted that they were an odd-looking pair of dining companions.  The Asian guy was around 19 or 20, probably Chinese, and wore a sort of mismatched dress shirt and blazer.  He looked out of his element but happy to engage with the old guy.  The old guy looked comfortable and eager.  There was a weird energy about them.   After listening to their conversation, I decided that the Asian guy was a gigolo. That was an interesting evening to eavesdrop.  Anyway, on to the factory food! Fried Macaroni and Cheese - We usually order this.  It's pretty good, and comparable to other places that serve arancini.   Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - Not the best I've had but reliably good. Factory Nachos - I don't like nachos with melted cheese.  Bring on the processed gooey cheese!  Skip. Firecracker Salmon - These are actually really good; we usually order these along with the fried mac. Crabcakes - Not good enough of a crabmeat to bread crumbs ratio.  Skip. Old Fashioned Hamburger and Wild Mushroom Burger - Both are pretty good, both are ginormous.  I can only half of the burger and fries.  I only had it when I was craving a burger, otherwise, there are better burgers to be had.  But not many are bigger than these. Pasta Carbonara, Shrimp with Angel Hair, Pasta Da Vinci, and Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes - That's four pastas up there.  They're all about the same so I don't see a point in separating them out.  It is better pasta than the average chain.  The carbonara and Da Vinci taste better of the four. Steak Diane - This was okay.  What am I doing, ordering steak at Cheesecake Factory?  I don't know, I was craving it and I was curious.  It was just okay, I definitely wouldn't order it again.  I've had better and I've had worse.   Grilled Pork Chops - I don't normally order pork chops, but there is one restaurant in the Bay Area where I really like their pork chop with potatoes gratin and compote, and I've been trying to find something comparable since.  This was not it.  It had a similar flavor (fruit and potatoes) but fell way short.  It's just okay. Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - Ohhhh mannn.  This is SO GOOD.  I don't normally like cheesecake.  This is the one exception.  Cheesecake Factory's fresh strawberry cheesecake.  I used to get this to go and eat it in a hotel lobby or Union Square with a cup of hot coffee.  It is the shit."
