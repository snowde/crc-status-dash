Jenn B.,"Oakland, United States",902,603,209,4.0,31/3/2012,"I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of girl, but Fridays are no meat days for Catholics and I had a voucher for a free slice of cheesecake (buy gift cards and they'll give these to you as a bonus!), so I figured I'd have a ton of options at Cheesecake Factory, with its novel of a menu. I usually get the grilled cheese sandwich but I knew I was going to order myself a slice of cheesecake so I decided to be healthy and order from the skinnylicious menu. The ahi tartare is listed as an appetizer, but I knew I was at CF, home of ridiculously large portions. My assumptions were wrong. This appetizer is definitely more of an appetizer for one, or maybe two. It was surprisingly small. I made up for it by inhaling a slice of dutch apple cheesecake, which was justified in my head because it had fruit. (HEALTHY!) The place was packed but there were several open stools at the bar and the servers there were attentive as can be. In and out in well under an hour."
Karen P.,"San Francisco, United States",12,83,16,4.0,25/3/2012,"Great food! Friendly service , we sat at the bar area so we didn't have to wait long, we were promptly greeted and told the specials. We order papas bravas, delicious sauce on the side, but it came at the same time that our entrees. My boyfriend had the chicken bacon club, it was delicious, I had the fettucini with sundried tomatoes, it was good but it needed some kind off veggie in it, something crunchy or fresh , because you could only eat so much of the pasta with that sauce, it was a bit too much. I wanted cheesecake but I was full!  We left happy and with left overs, .... I will give them 3 and 1/2 stars, but I can't, and since it was a positive experience , so be 4 :D"
Yvonnr L.,"San Francisco, United States",107,23,19,4.0,21/3/2012,It's better than before but not exceptional!!! They have a Helthy menu for people that cares about what the eat but I still see everyone ordering the 1000+ cal meals.
Yuliem D.,"San Leandro, United States",10,29,,4.0,18/3/2012,"I loved the food and prices are reasonable for the portions.  Only reason it gets a 4 is because our waiter kept forgetting about us, which is understandable since this is a bit of a touristy place and it's always busy but then again, that's why you hire more people right?"
Luis O.,"San Francisco, United States",9,17,,4.0,18/3/2012,"The food is ok and a bit pricey, but it's just something about the Cheesecake Factory that's just very fun. I love coming here and feeling like I'm having an amazing time in the big, bustling city with my friends. They have several options for cheesecake, and they are very good. This place isn't great if you're trying to stay healthy, but it's worth a visit at least once and make sure to sit outside!"
Mahta P.,"San Francisco, United States",260,80,2,4.0,13/3/2012,"It is possible to eat healthy at the Cheesecake factory. I swear. Salmon with broccoli and carrots all sauces on the side. Not bad. It's also possible to eat two days of calories and dangerous levels of sugar and fat if not careful when ordering.  All in all, the salmon was yummy. Will I give up going to The Plant anytime soon? No. But in a pinch the Cheesecake Factory can work."
Linna L.,"Los Angeles, United States",351,106,16,4.0,12/3/2012,"A Cheesecake Factory is just like any other Cheesecake Factory . . . except when the Cheesecake Factory sits on top of a Macys! Seriously, that and the lure of cheesecake are the only reasons why I would ever consider coming here.  It may seem like I'm ragging on this restaurant, but I have no real complaints.  I mean, it's just like any other chain restaurant: variety of food and drinks, nice decor, decent service, and solid food. But the experience of sitting out on the patio (if it's not that cold outside or if it is cold, and you can brave the cold) or even sitting next to the huge windows that look out into the patio makes the wait worth it! I know people often complain about the wait, but I think if you come here at like 6:00 on a weekday, you'll likely beat the dinner crowd and have your choice of tables. I would say this is definitely one of those places to take your out-of-town friends and family when they come visit the city. Not only is it in a really pretty part of town (next to the Tiffany's and Louis Vuitton stores), but there's a huge tourist draw. Imagine your friends saying: ""Yeah, [your name here] took me to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. It's right on the roof of Macys! Woah . . . it was such a cool experience. We even got to see seagulls hanging out on the roof's edge and got to take in the beautiful views of the city while we drank wine and had awesome cheesecake."" Yup, that would be bonus points for you."
Tony T.,"Hayward, United States",6,75,15,4.0,29/2/2012,This particular Cheesecake Factory location is great because it's right in Union Square.  We came here during lunchtime and we only had to wait 10 minutes.  Not bad for a Friday afternoon.  The food was good.  Portions were great!  Service was excellent.
Jennifer J.,"San Francisco, United States",371,204,159,4.0,28/2/2012,"Love this place, although the wait is ridiculous. However, on a nice day, definitely wait for an outdoor table. The view of the city is absolutely amazing and it's a good place for date lunch/brunch. Not recommended for huge groups (pricing AND wait) although the food is quite delicious (I've had good experiences at MOST Cheesecake Factories)"
Matt H.,"Oakland, United States",1234,96,261,4.0,27/2/2012,"Oh my, Cheesecake Factory (any of the locations) always makes my day bright- but this one is especially awesome.  Located at the mega Macy's at Union Square in SF, the menu here is pretty outstanding- especially the dessert menu.  It's a bit pricey, and often times the wait times are long, but what do you expect? It's a touristy spot, and that's what you'll get if you go there.  Well...that and perfect dessert, great customer service, and a pretty crazy looking burger if that's your thing."
Victor L.,"San Francisco, United States",46,549,110,4.0,27/2/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is a very solid restaurant.  I have been to several locations throughout California and this one is like the rest.  Great service, good food, large portions, scrumptious cheesecake.   The only downside to this place is that there is always a long wait.  But, if you go to the balcony, there is an amazing view.   Once your beeper starts to vibrate, head back inside, give it to the person at the front counter, and they will seat you shortly.  The menu is so vast.  There are small bites, appetizers, soups, salads, main courses, specialty dishes, and of course cheesecake!   The most recent time we went, we ordered the fried cheese, stuffed mushrooms, chicken marsala and mushrooms, and red velvet cheesecake.  We only ordered one entree because we always get two and can barely finish half.  The fried cheese tastes like mozzarella sticks, but more sophisticated.  They are crispy, and the inside is piping hot.  The stuffed mushrooms are delicious too.  The sauce is a bit oily, but still good.  As for the chicken marsala, it tastes like something very familiar.  For those of you who have had Yakisboa, teriyaki flavor, it tastes exactly the same as the sauce they use.  Try it and tell me it doesn't!   The red velvet cheesecake was very good, except we were extremely full by the time we ate it.  I would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full.   Cool place. I would urge everyone to try this at least once."
Elisa L.,"Toronto, Canada",353,327,472,4.0,26/2/2012,"I was going to come here with a group of ~8, which btw.. was a 2 hour wait (luckily we called in prior to find this out, we didnt actually wait there for 2 hours). Came here for real with my bf, we chose the outdoor table which was only a 20min wait. Indoor seating would have been 40 min.  Their portions are huge despite the priciness. Esp. on the cocktails. We only got dessert, so I don't know about the wait. Overall good service though. Oh, and we had delicious bread served to us.  PS. I love how their menu is like 30 pages long, with every other page being a Macy's ad."
Johanah I.,"South San Francisco, United States",112,107,53,4.0,23/2/2012,"Came here the day after Valentine's Day, and it was a really nice experience. I came here around 6-7pm on a Wednesday night, so the place was loud and packed with people sitting on the 'waiting' benches or outside lounging on the chairs. My friend and I got there and they asked us to wait for 30 minutes, so that`s not bad at all. I liked it because their timing was right on, we waited around that time and we had to wait another 5 minutes to get seated. My friend really wanted to eat outside, and I wasn`t so sure about it because of my fear of having birds fly over me, and I thought I was going to freeze that night because  the wind was picking up. What I didn`t know until I went outside was that they have those nice heater lamps around every table, and I didn`t see any birds at all. Everything else was great, the service was very friendly and attentive. All of the foods come in HUGE portions! Not joking! We ordered appetizers, entree's, and cheesecake, we ended up having to take most of the food home! It`s definitely a nice place to go back to if you`re patient with waiting, no rush, because especially since this restaurant is in a popular spot located on the top of Macys, expect this place to always be BUSY! Also if you are willing to spend a pretty penny on good food, come here! I would love to come back again some time :)"
Rachel L.,"Alameda, United States",27,48,2,4.0,22/2/2012,Food = Excellent Service = Very Good Line Wait = Poor Cheesecakes = Excellent Im giving a rating of 4 stars for the food and delicious cheesecakes.
Katie A.,"Addison, United States",17,72,10,4.0,22/2/2012,"You can always find something to eat on the expansive menu. The kitchen does a great job of handling the multitude of selections. A Vegan guest at our table was thrilled with the options. The view from the top floor is beautiful - even if you sit right inside the windows. Lunch portions are still large and shareable. The passion fruit iced tea is not heavily flavored, but is very refreshing. We always enjoy a visit to this location."
Ford P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,4.0,21/2/2012,"The cheesecake factory is always a safe bet to bring people, it is not very exciting but it has a huge menu that anyone could find something they like in. The best with the S.F. restaurant (and one of the main reasons that I come back) is the location, to sit outside on the veranda with the city skyline outside is always a nice feeling, so the 4 stars is mostly for the location even though as I said nothing is wrong with the food..just not so exciting."
Jen H.,"San Diego, United States",334,1885,187,4.0,20/2/2012,"Solid 3.5 stars, but I bumped it up 0.5 star b/c of where we were sitting! I really enjoyed sitting outside in the balcony even though there were a few annoying birds flying around while we were eating.  Nevertheless, the view was breathtaking. I came here for Sunday Brunch. Ordered: 1) Lunch portion: Louisiana Chicken Pasta: 3.5/5 ; I would've given the dish 4 stars if the thin pieces of chicken were not breaded and fried---i didn't even taste the chicken 2) Strawberry lemonade: 3/5--pretty good and free refills!! I skipped out on their delectable cheesecakes because I was saving my stomach for another dessert place, but when I got there, there were 25 people out the door--so no dessert for me that day :( Now, i regret it and should've ordered a piece togo!"
Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, United States",672,313,59,4.0,29/1/2012,"Normally, I'd give a Cheesecake Factory a three-star review, but what sets this one apart is the stunning view over San Francisco. Located on the top floor of the Macy's Building, you can sit on the balcony and overlook the entire city. Simply gorgeous. Aside from that, it's a Cheesecake Factory like any other. The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy. The restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation. Service is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy. The food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that. Honestly, I doubt that it was even inspired by a Mandarin dish! Hard to avoid the cheesecake at the end of the meal, too! I think my favorite is the Oreo cookie cheesecake! Definitely puts a good end to the meal! Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and isn't anything too special. There are some items on their menus that I like well enough, but there are also a lot of items on the menu that I meet with a resounding ""meh."" Commentary on the Cheesecake Factory aside, this particular location really benefits from stunning views over San Francisco, and that's ultimately what salvages this location from what would otherwise be a three-star review."
Diana C.,"Corona, United States",204,691,796,4.0,19/1/2012,"The ambiance is very upscale although the attire is casual. Located on top of the Macy's it is very convenient that an elevator takes you there. Everything is a tad expensive. They also do not have a happy hour although their bar is packed at the usual happy hour time. I've come here more for the view outside. If you manage to get seating outside, you get an awesome view of union square. It is especially pretty during Christmas."
Sonya T.,"Los Angeles, United States",143,112,20,4.0,3/1/2012,"I only came to this location because I wanted to dine on the rooftop patio. It was an hour wait on a Saturday Night, but my bf & I were okay with chilling in Union Square for an hour.  The view was beautiful from our table, and our server provided excellent service. Good and medium-priced food."
