Suki B.,"Oakland, United States",261,282,234,4.0,29/12/2011,"Although, I usually like to stay away from chain restaurants...I'm a sucker for Cheesecake Factory!  Their Chicken Madeira is simply amazing and their Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake is seriously a piece of sugary HEAVENNNN! You can never go wrong by going here."
Michael S.,"Washington, DC, United States",4,19,2,4.0,27/12/2011,"I should start out by saying the Cheesecake Factory is definitely an experience that you have to plan for. It is SUPER busy every time I have gone in for dinner, less so during lunch, but note that they don't make reservations. I think this in itself speaks for its reputation. The wait can be anywhere from five minutes to an hour and five minutes for dinner, so I usually come prepared with a water bottle and a couple of granola bars. I recommend getting a seat on the patio as you overlook Union Square park and during the holidays is especially pretty. Being that it is San Francisco and it can get cold outside, they do have heaters to toast you right up. There is a massive variety of food (including cheesecake obviously) with massive portions. A bit on the pricey side, but the experience is worth. The service has been a hit or miss, but quite honestly, I just go there for the fun environment, the good food, and the CHEESECAKE! Some complain that the service it too crummy to go back to, but when you're with a good group of friends, I know I'd rather not have a waiter who constantly checks up every two minutes. Again, if you expect an attentive wait staff who will rub your feet every time they walk by, I'd say skip this. But the food is great, the views are worth noting, and the menu is impressive. I can't describe it any better than saying it's definitely a fun experience that you must try."
Deniece B.,"Stockton, United States",119,263,85,4.0,26/12/2011,"The food is good and they give a bunch of food for a reasonable price. The service is ok, the tables and utensils are horrible. I come here all the time when I visit the city, and it seems like they get worse and worse. Today the utensils were greasy and dirty, tables dirty, menus sticky. I hope they improve!"
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, United States",1464,987,1073,4.0,22/12/2011,"Located on the SEVENTH floor, and from the SEVENTH floor, take another escalator to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY FLOOR. Hour long wait is typical, go ahead and sit on the couches on the SEVENTH floor in the meantime if you wish.   We were seated in the patio, after having been given a choice.   I ordered the Flying Gorilla Milkshake -- which is basically chocolate / banana milkshake with chocolate bits and fluffy whipped cream... I've actually never ordered a milkshake at a restaurant before so this was new... oh and they also add a (brand?) ""banana liquor"", so a SMALL bit of spike... Also ordered the Asian Pear Martini... the coloring of the drink looked a bit ""dirty"" and there were also those small baby seeds characteristic of pears in the drink, but just made it have a thick texture (thick for a martini, ironic).  Taste was wonderful.   The waiter was nice enough to bring out two breadbaskets, one after another.  Not all of us ordered food at the table, and he was understanding of that.   Plenty of heat lamps all around, very very comfortable.  Don't mind the draft, you don't feel the draft when situated under a majestic metal heat lamp...  They have over 50+ desserts (cheesecakes, only?) on their menu, as the waiter was quick to point out...  ***FYI: And, for a limited time only, you can receive a complimentary slice of cheesecake with the purchase of a $25 gift card to be redeemed at a later visit starting 12/26/11."
Sharjah M.,"San Francisco, United States",35,132,97,4.0,20/12/2011,"Their white chocolate raspberry truffle is bomb dot com! I wasn't really into the pasta but the cheesecakes are off the hook! Especially of course its what they are known for! One time my friend and I came to Cheesecake Factory and we were just there for desserts.  I am hooked! The only problem is that parking sucks! Take bart or park at the garage on 4th and mission or on the weekends wait until after 6pm to park on the streets.  What sucks though is the over hour wait! My first time we waited over an hour because it was raining so the people that were seated outside are seated inside the restaurant.  But anyway, prepare yourself for the wait cause it can definitely test your patience."
Daniel D.,"Concord, United States",827,462,315,4.0,12/12/2011,"So.. My GF called this place at 8:30pm on a super busy Saturday and were told it was going to be a 2 hour wait! OMG! B -- S -- Typical SF parking = sucks or you can pay the big $$$ -- Prepare to WAIT unless you get lucky :p -- Way too many options -- Huge portions -- Service can be hit or miss -- Bar area for my drinkers -- Cheesecake to-go -- SF Healthy Tax included in your bill We thought about going elsewhere, maybe even The Burger Bar or Nordstrom's Bistro Cafe but something inside me said ""cheesecake."" Despite what seemed like a thousand people out in Union Square and probably another 100+ people waiting to be seated, we put our names in for 2 at around 8:45pm. Around 9:15pm, my GF checked in with the hosts and we were told it would be another 50 minutes. For some reason it didn't phase me and BOOM, our pager started vibrating. We had water and bread in only a few minutes. Our waiter was super attentive and we got our food in less than 15 - 20 minutes. We even got 2 Passion Fruit Mojitos that were pretty strong but tasty :) Our food came out hot and fresh. The portions were huge like usual and we ended up getting some cheesecake to go because we were so full. I was really impressed with our server, but I think he was off so the new guy was just ok after taking our table over. Normally I'd give 3 stars but the fact that we were sat down in less than half the time we had expected and the service was good, I'm giving them 4 stars.  *Warning*  In general, I try to avoid this chain restaurant but it's a decent choice when in Union Square and when you're not trying to spend $100+ on dinner."
Jay B.,"Los Altos, United States",77,39,22,4.0,12/12/2011,"After attending the Nutcracker I usually take my kids to Union Sq to see the Christmas tree /ice rink and then onto Macy's to see Santa and then The Cheesecake Factory. Make sure during the holiday season to get your name down on the wait list first before you do your Macy's thing. The wait can be an hour or longer. If your not shopping then relax on one of the many plush couches that Macys have on display one floor down the escalator.  I will say this about the Cheesecake Factory. Once you are seated you are pretty much guaranteed to be taken care of by really attentive ,nice, non pushy waitstaff. These guys make the dining experience here a whole lot better. 5 stars to them. Every time I have eaten here I get the best service. As far as the food , I stick with the burgers and fries. It's a huge menu. I'm not a fan of huge menus because it's hard to have good quality control. It's like good diner food.  The cheesecake is light and delicious. I gave this place  4 stars over all. maybe because we make it a part of nutcracker holidays is why I'm partial? I've eaten inside and out side. Outside has a fantastic view of Union Sq. It,s worth the trip if your tired of shopping or sightseeing and want to take in a great view and rest for a while and you don't mind descent diner style food. They have a bar too. and the best part for our family is that it's kid friendly. The worst part is it's REALLY crowded!"
Amanda L.,"Tracy, United States",1,13,,4.0,3/12/2011,The food is amazing and huge portions!!!!! The only thing that is irritating is that it's so crowded. I have to make sure I have a block of time to give myself to eat.
Anji W.,"San Francisco, United States",785,202,1755,4.0,30/11/2011,"The drinks were good and the food was delicious. We came on a sunny day and sat outside. The service was good as well. The waiting time was kinda long, but at least we had a great view and good company. So overall, pretty awesome day! ^_^"
Mariam B.,"Modesto, United States",193,24,2,4.0,17/11/2011,"I go to Cheesecake factory in every city that I go to. It has so much variety and everything that I have tasted has been GREAT!!!  Appetizers: I usually get their spinach & artichoke dip, buffalo blasts and their avocado rolls.  Entrees: If your in the mood for pasta, the Thai Chicken Pasta is to die for. If you want a salad, I would go for the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Sandwhich, Shimp & Bacon Club is awesome there. Their Pizza & Salad Lunch Combo is a great deal and really good too.  Dessert: I am not much of a tiramisu fan, but I must say that their Tiramisu Cheesecake is absolutely delicious!!! The whip cream is the best part!!!  Pretty much anything you get at Cheesecake will not disappoint.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that sometimes it has slow service."
T L.,"San Francisco, United States",26,439,383,4.0,16/11/2011,"Love the gumbo, mango raspberry smoothie, and the breadbasket! So much to choose from on menu and the portions are big enough to feed a trucker. If you have enough room don't forget the Tiramisu cheesecake. Minus 1 star for the waiting game but you can go shopping while you wait."
Liz W.,"Boston, United States",136,276,227,4.0,14/11/2011,4 stars is only for the Hibachi Steak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is SO DELICIOUS.  I'm actually not a huge fan of the cheesecakes here....but maybe I just need to come here more and try different flavors.  It's always nice to enjoy views of union square while waiting...but dayum is this wait WAAAAAYYY TOOO LONG. you will probably keel over from starvation or blow up from anger before you are fed.  But....just get the hibachi steak and all bad feelings will dissipate....
Christina X.,"Millbrae, United States",249,46,12,4.0,14/11/2011,"It's a first come first serve basis here. There's always a lot of people here, so come early. Sundays arent that crowded usually. I love how they have a lot of variety in their menus; a lot to choose from, especially the appetizers! It's convenient that the furniture section of Macy's is right down the escalator. You can relax on a sofa until your table's ready! The service here is really good. The  bread here is yummy too. The entrees here are decent, depends on what you order. The cheesecakes are delish, obviously; so many different kinds too! 4 stars."
Mel G.,"Tucson, United States",131,1891,,4.0,13/11/2011,"The main reason I'm giving this location 4 stars is because of the spectacular view you can get overlooking Union Square downtown.  My boyfriend and I grabbed some drinks here earlier tonight, and went outside to enjoy the view.  Yes, the wait is really long, but my recommendation is to go there for some drinks, where you don't have to put up with the wait.  So great."
NC B.,"San Francisco, United States",581,120,36,4.0,5/11/2011,"The service and menu is EXCEPTIONAL! Ive been in this location at least 100 times. seriously, The view from the top of Maceys is amazing, The menu has EVERYTHING from mexican, italian, to chinese and burgers. Best dishes: Avocado eggrolls, spaghetti Carbonara, Chicken Madeira. ONLY CONS: waitime to get a table is OBSCENE!!! 2 hours in a tuesday night for a party of 2??? really!!! They should take reservations or do something about it.  Also there is literally no seating in the waiting area."
Jerry L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,4.0,4/11/2011,"The CCF is something that never surprises you in a negative or positive way. However, the food is generally good and prices are all right. The CCF is a great general-purpose restaurant and the menu is very extensive."
Julia D.,"London, United Kingdom",247,588,234,4.0,3/11/2011,"This is something that I have to come out to my friends about---I love it here.  My favorite things are the BBQ ranch chicken salad, the apple cobbler, and the unlimited sodas.  I'd recommend getting a table at the bar if there's a long wait.  Mario is my favorite server--he is also a former intern at Lauren Conrad's fashion line, yeah...so he's great.   I think this is a fun place to people watch.  I have never been bored here--which is a big statement."
nima s.,"American Canyon, United States",0,39,,4.0,1/11/2011,"The wait list to get seated was soooooo long (45 minutes).   If it wasn't for the birthday dinner I would have left.  But I decided to walk around Macy's for a bit and check out the incredible view outside until our pager lit up.  I mentioned to the waiter that we were short on time to get to a show after the food and he sped things up a lot for us which was awesome.  The warm bread to start things off was nice and soft.  The bang-bang chicken and shrimp Thai dish was really yummy and flavorful.  The cheesecake was not as special.  Just plain ol cheesecake like every other place.  Our waiter did a great job and made our experience here good.  Wasn't as pricey as I expected.  The view if you sit outside can be worth the long wait.  The ""No reservations for nighttime"" should be changed."
Jiordan C.,"San Francisco, United States",66,142,489,4.0,23/10/2011,"I go to this particular Cheesecake Factory just for the view, the bread, and the cheap breakfast options (eggs any style, toast, etc.). I rarely get real food or cheesecake (though their flavors are great) if and when I go. They have pretty upbeat service, which I really appreciate in an otherwise overwhelming setting. Also, they don't rush you or ignore you when it's extra packed and busy. But that bread... you know, that dark, oat-crusted loaf that comes before the food - worth the wait. I know it's weird, but it's really good bread."
Joye C.,"San Francisco, United States",3,10,,4.0,22/10/2011,"No matter which day or time of the day you step into The Cheesecake Factory, you will have to wait. I have been here on many different occasions and all of my wait times have been more than an hour. It's worth the wait though! The most recent visit I've had was on a Saturday night. It was an hour and 45 mins of wait for a table of two indoors, but an hour and 15 mins for outdoors. Since we had plans with other friends later in the night, we chose to sit outside. Thank goodness it wasn't freezing that night! The view was beautiful at night, overlooking Union Square, and the vibe was just perfect. We tried the fish tacos, which was just ok; I couldn't taste the fish at all because everything else was more flavorful. We also tried the onion rings, chicken croquettes, and fresh strawberry cheesecake. SUPER DELICIOUS! We had to force ourselves to finish everything and by the end of the night, we left happily satisfied :)"
