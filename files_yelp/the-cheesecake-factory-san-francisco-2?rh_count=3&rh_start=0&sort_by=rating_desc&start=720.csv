Nora S.,"San Francisco, United States",406,186,14,4.0,22/10/2011,"Things you might see at the Cheesecake Factory bar on a Tuesday night: European porn stars, tourists from New Zealand discussing the Rugby World Cup, an escort exchanging money with her pimp. In other words, prepare for a wild night!  The food is of a good enough quality and the service is EXCELLENT (what up, Mario!!!).  If you don't mind waiting for a table (it can be around half an hour), or feel comfortable hovering at bar tables where people look like they might be leaving, this is a fine place to come."
Analleli G.,"San Francisco, United States",9,31,,4.0,17/10/2011,- At the top floor of a mall? I believe. - Obviously great food...it's Cheesecake. Don't buy something just because it's expensive and you expect for it to be amazing though. Food will be good. - Clam chowder is the BEST!!! - Wait for me on a Friday night was 1 hour and 15 minutes ish.
Mallory M.,"Miami, United States",255,186,195,4.0,12/10/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a nice little treat. It's definitely one of the most touristy restaurants in SF, but it's worth the wait.   The trick at the CCF is to make sure you eat slowly or save some of your meal for later so you can actually get to the massive dessert list. Not only do they have like 30 kinds of cheesecake, they also have some other pretty spectacular choices.  Be prepared to wait at least an hour or more, but try and hit it on a sunny afternoon and sit outside!"
Fouad M.,"San Diego, United States",13,228,3,4.0,10/10/2011,I went there with family and friends during our trip to San Francisco few months ago. We decided to stop by to get some drinks. The place was packed and we had to wait for few minutes to get a table. The server was very friendly and professional. She took our order and brought us drinks fairly quickly. We had few rounds of drinks before we continued with our tour of the city.
Tien H.,"San Francisco, United States",9,99,8,4.0,9/10/2011,"It's a great place to eat and enjoy a slice of delicious cheesecake, but I stopped in to buy a whole cheesecake the other day and boy did they pissed me off. Honestly, all they had to do was bring the cake from the freezer, put it in a box, bag it, and give it to me, but I literally waited half an hour till I was able to get my cake. That is RIDICULOUS!  They had a lot of people just standing around too, yet it took them that long to get my cake boxed up and hand it to me. I find that unforgivable in terms of service. HOWEVER, the cheesecake is always delicious, the food is tasty and the portion size is quite nice."
Daniel H.,"San Francisco, United States",24,38,14,4.0,9/10/2011,"great food and service for inexpensive price, however there is always line takes anywheres from 15 to 60 minutes"
Miyu S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,4.0,5/10/2011,I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday last week.
Diana C.,"San Francisco, United States",7,32,,4.0,25/9/2011,"Great place for tourists....And locals who want to be reminded what an amazing city San Francisco is. The outdoor seating is on the top floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square. It is a perfect view. The food is very good for a chain. I love their flatbreads, their fried avocado rolls and their pastas. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. The cheesecake is great, but given their portion sizes, I rarely make it to dessert.  Mainly, this place is worth it for the amazing view. The wait is usually at least half hour to an hour but considering that it is inside Macy's it's no big deal to shop a bit in the meantime. The service is hit or miss depending on the waiter. There are so many staff members that you can get lucky with a really nice waiter or not so lucky. Definitely recommend this place!"
M C.,"Olivehurst, United States",294,2010,7472,4.0,19/9/2011,Nicely located right across the street from Union Square and on the top floor of Macy's. The place is grand and has nice decor. It is perfect for those who loves cheesecake or wants something different.  Serves is kind of slow.
Stella Y.,"Los Angeles, United States",819,704,512,4.0,15/9/2011,"I think having about 4 menu pages of cheesecake qualifies calling them the cheesecake factory! Unfortunately, i didn't have a slice (or 2!) due to the rather large plate of food that was ordered. I had the chicken bellagio which sounded oh so delicious with its crusted chicken on top of Basil pasta with a cheese cream sauce. The first bite was good but a little bit disappointing. The chicken and pasta had 2 things in common: both were very flavorful but overly salty and dry. The pasta was also a bit undercooked, thus not too soft to the bite. Food was 3 stars. What pushed it over for 4 stars was the gorgeous sunny day with outdoor seating, a fantastic 8th floor view of union square and the best date that was smart enough to make a reservation so that we didn't have to wait! Next time, i should just skip  lunch and ordered dessert like i wanted to in the first place!"
Gracie B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",374,25,1,4.0,11/9/2011,"Beware, I just found a piece of metal (like a piece of a hook) in my calamari! I love the Cheesecake Factory...it is my favorite restaurant. I was just a bit disappointed to find a piece of metal in my calamari appetizer."
Denise C.,"Pacifica, United States",3,51,,4.0,30/8/2011,"Can you say CROWDED?. WE came here for my daughter's 21st birthday dinner. We waited 2.5 hrs. Please note that this place does not take reservations. Need I say more, HOWEVER, ths place is a great for big parties and great views. I have to say, it was worth it, The birthday girl had a  blast. CF is still ""cracking"" even though its been around for a long time.  The cheese cake to order? GODIVA WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE!!!  sooo worth the million calories, per bite.  I ordered the jambalaya. it was good. The lettuce wraps are awesome, I highly recomment this. It's also fun to build your own ""taco"" lettuce wrap. Yes!I would go again!!!! Denise"
Johny C.,"Redding, United States",1,17,,4.0,27/8/2011,"I was in San Fran for the night and stayed right in Union Square. My wife and I were hungry, so we walked across the street to the Cheesecake Factory.  The Food was delicious!  My wife had pasta dish with pounded chicken and white sauce(can't remember the name). She loved it and I took a couple bites and thought it was great too.  I was feeling that I wanted a sandwich type meal, so I ordered the Philly cheese steak. It was very good. The fries were the bomb!  All of this leads up to the real reason you go to this place, THE CHEESECAKE!  I had just the basic cheesecake with cherry topping, and my wife had the chocolate cheesecake. It was the best ever. We shared and both of us were stuffed. Great food!  The reason for 4 stars, is that the wait for this place sucks. Well worth the wait once you start eating the great food.  Oh yeah, views from the outdoor area are incredible at night. You look right down on Union Square.  This is a must stop in San Fran."
Marie Lynn M.,"San Francisco, United States",1,15,,4.0,20/8/2011,"Huge portions and very yummy! I went here with my friends and we had a pretty big group. It was such a long wait--2 horrible hours!--but it was worth it. The waiter, Billy, was so funny and fabulous. This place is great!"
Meghana S.,"Berkeley, United States",192,66,29,4.0,20/8/2011,"It takes forever to get a table here, but the wait is worth it. The food is pretty good, the service is so-so, but the cheesecakes are amazing! My favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake! Also give their crabcakes a try."
Julia L.,"New York, United States",269,313,19,4.0,17/8/2011,"avocado egg rolls. A serious MUST. It's the best appetizer they have!!  Besides just the amazing appetizer though... The Cheesecake factory is really lovely. It's set way up on the top of the Macy's building overlooking Union Square which is soo much fun. I usually try to go here when I have family visiting or when I'm in for a nice night out because it's such a spectacular place. Although I DO have some suggestions.  Do NOT come hungry if it is the weekend due to the fact that they are always packed on the weekends if you come hungry you will be even MORE hungry and grumpy by the time you sit down. It's usually about an hour or so wait so be patient While waiting, I suggest that you go down to the furniture section... they say that the pager doesn't work there... but every time I have sat down there it totally does, I think that the Macy employees just get annoyed so they say that just to bug ya. but DO NOT quote me on this because for all i know that may have changed.  TRY the Steak... medium rare will melt in your mouth... seriously some of the best steak I have had and if you're more of a fish person... get the Salmon with asparagus and potatoes... you will not regret it. Both entrees will leave you so satisfied and wanting more annd OF COURSE the Cheesecake.  Get any kind of flavor that looks delicious... it's all good as it should be since it is the title of the restaurant. ENJOY! :]"
Lovely S.,"Cicero, United States",0,7,,4.0,16/8/2011,"I am a regular customer of the cheesecake factory. I absolutely, LOVE the food but at times the waiters/waitresses can be subpar. The appetizer and entree I recommend are the: Shrimp Scampi (Entree) Tex-Mex Egg Rolls (Appetizer) The atmosphere is lively and fairly loud; the background music they play is great. I personally like the set-up of the cheesecake, the booths are roomy and it in my opinion has been beautifully decorated.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
Vikki K.,"San Francisco, United States",115,201,84,4.0,15/8/2011,"I came here the other night with family. It was my first time eating a meal here in a while because my friends and I usually swing by around midnight (when they close at 12:30 hehe!) for dessert. I swear they hate us. My dad waited for a table around 6:15 and they had one at 7 (so a 45 minute wait) but we couldn't get there until 8:45 and they were able to push our reservations back. The pager is supposed to work in the Macy's building but for some reason, ours did not. We got seated around 9 pm and the hostess led us to our seats. It was a clear night in San Francisco so the view was gorgeous and made for many picture opportunities.  Our server was very sweet and came out with the breads (the white and brown chocolate tasting one) and our waters. We started off with the avocado eggrolls and calamari. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder and the fry station was backed up so our waiter gave us another bowl of clam chowder on the house. The clam chowder tasted so fresh and had tons of pieces of clams in there. I must have had a piece of a clam or two in each bite! My family ordered the chicken alfredo, chicken madera, petite filet mignon, skinny turkey burger and salad and chicken bellagio.  I personally had the Chicken Madera with chicken, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken was covered with a delicious cheese that melted the chicken, sauce and mushrooms together. It was very very delicious! Might I add that the portions are SUPER LARGE so you will always have to doggie bag. We ended the meal with a white chocolate macadamia cheesecake which was as fluffy and sweet as I last remembered it to be. Definitely a great place to take out of towners and tourists! :0"
Angel J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,13,,4.0,12/8/2011,I love sitting on the deck watching the sites at Union Square. It's the city so you're always entertained. Good food and even better dessert.  Their portions are huge!  I would give it five stars but they are too popular and as a result service suffers.
Karen W.,"Austin, United States",117,85,21,4.0,10/8/2011,Gotta love consistently good food in ample portions. Great spot to see all the goings on in Union Sq.
