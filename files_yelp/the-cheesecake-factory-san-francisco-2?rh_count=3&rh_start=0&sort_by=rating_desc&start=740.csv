Erika M.,"Los Angeles, United States",249,156,66,4.0,3/8/2011,"I don't care if this is a tourist trap.  I absolutely love this place (specifically at this location.)  The view of Union Square is awesome, especially around Christmas, when they have the ginormous Christmas tree.  And the food is good, too.  You can't go wrong with any of the pastas.  My favorite salad is the Luau Salad.  It's so refreshing, and I love the crunch from the wontons.  It's a huge salad, and I have shared it with 3 people.  Of course, you can't leave without a slice of cheesecake!  My personal favorites are the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle.  Mmm... they are so heavenly."
Rheine T.,"San Lorenzo, United States",501,136,138,4.0,29/7/2011,"I will lower down the 5 star to a 4 star because of the wait.  This place can be really busy, so get ready to wait for about 5? no 30 minutes.  Came and ate Fettucini Alfredo, asked for extra cheese, they grated it in front of me with no hassle. I also asked for a cherry pepsi, and well the gentleman said they don't have it, but they got really creative.  After waiting for 4 minutes, he came back with a tall glass of pepsi with cherries on the bottom!  Ordered a cheesecake for dessert, it was really big for a slice, so I had to take some home for later.  It may be pricey, but it's worth the good food!"
Chengyu Z.,"Berkeley, United States",211,1,,4.0,27/7/2011,"I am a foreign student here. I went to this restaurant two weeks ago. In general, it was a nice place to have dinner. The decoration was cozyHowever, there were so many guests that day that service staff hardly had time to serve us.But the most important part was fine--the food! We had seven people and all the dishes we ordered were delicious especially the cheesecake. What's more, the components of dishes were really huge so we didn't finish them all. And the prices there were average level. In brief, it's a good choice to have dinner there. And making a reservation in advance is a time-saving."
Ivan L.,"Santa Ana, United States",407,411,30,4.0,25/7/2011,"Uhhh its a cheesecake factory, I would call it a midscale place since its a chain and its not black tie, although somewhat expensive... the food is generally consistent and service is the same. I'm not sure but if you've never been to a Cheescake factory start there and explore some other places on yelp =X... I will say that if you are lucky enough to find a cheescake factory that will make you the off item (its was on their old menu) food that is a mashed potato omelette get it...,. it is freaking glutenous and wonderful."
lib c.,"Daly City, United States",90,45,27,4.0,23/7/2011,"Me and my boyfriend love it here x). We always hit up the Cheesecake Factory whenever we're in downtown. We usually get buffalo blasts, split a mushroom burger, and if we have room-- cheesecake. The service is pretty good here but the wait is torturous lol."
Anh H.,"Oakland, United States",86,41,6,4.0,11/7/2011,"the bait: heavenly baked brown bread w/ butter, crisps, yet very delicate buffalo blasts, mahi mahi grilled fished tacos and scrumptious strawberry martinis.  until these items are completely taken off their menu and despite my best efforts to abstain from this place, i'm hooked. i continue to tolerate the ridiculously large crowds as you enter the 8th floor, guaranteed 30-60 minute wait and hit or miss parking.  the conclusion:  i guess the appetizer, entree and drinks are worth the while."
Taryn S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,29,,4.0,26/6/2011,"yuuuum!  definitely worth the wait (and it's a looong wait).  love their pastas and salads. everything is pretty good, just like every other cheesecake factory. I love this one because it's right in the middle of union square on top of macys.  the staff here are really sweet and friendly.  some nights are really crowded and stuffy. it gets a little hectic not knowing if your table is ready or whatnot. the elevator rides up and down are also a bit stuffy. standing in a tiny elevator with 20 strangers is never comfortable."
Jessica A.,"San Francisco, United States",638,215,416,4.0,26/6/2011,"When I'm looking to have a nice lunch/dinner in downtown SF, this is one of the places that comes to mind. It's located on the top floor of Macy's Union Square. GREAT VIEW of Union Square. Even better view on a nice SF day, but those are a hit or miss, haha! Pasta Da Vinci - LOVEEEEEE!!!!! I first tried this a couple years back & loved it. Then, they took it off the menu, but they still would make it if I ordered it. & then it's back on the menu again. My friend, who isn't a fan of white sauce, enjoyed it too. It's SOOOO GOOOD! Satisfied each & every time :) Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake - YUM! YUM! YUM! Probably one of the best red velvet goodies ever! It's tastes sooo rich. Not too sweet either. It's a huge piece (w/ a bajillion calories, haha!), so I recommend sharing.  Portions are huge. Even if I have the lunch portion, I still have leftovers.  Customer service is really good here. They're really nice & I typically don't have any complaints. The wait here is RIDICULOUSSS!!! I try not to come at peak times..especially on the weekends. Be ready to wait! Luckily, there's shopping right there (but the pagers don't go too far)."
Joe P.,"Sacramento, United States",10,151,,4.0,20/6/2011,With this location sitting on top of the 8th floor in Union Square how could it not be good ? Been here several times and very consistent .Food is good as well as the service.Good drinks too.
Gisele M.,"Santa Cruz, United States",31,98,24,4.0,13/6/2011,"Another restaurant chain that I liked and that I will certainly visit again. It was my first time and I liked both food and service. For a crowed place, I though the experience would be worst. Of course you need to be prepared to wait around 25 to 40 minutes to get a table since you are right in the middle of Union Square, but overall, I liked it.  I had the Bistro Shrimp Past and loved it! I got all the flavors and textures I was waiting for... and I believe I can say that I know a lot about shrimp pastas. ;)"
Alla B.,"South San Francisco, United States",195,25,1,4.0,9/6/2011,I like the cheesecake factory. It's situated on top of the macys in downtown and if you choose outdoor seating you have a lovely view of union square while you relax on a heated patio. They play lovely toned down jazz music and have a large selection of all kinds of food which is generally delicious (though I recommend splitting it). It is a long wait if you have a large group but for a smaller group (even up to 7) you can be seated within 20 minutes. It's a very relaxing dining experience.
Diana B.,"San Ramon, United States",112,345,431,4.0,6/6/2011,"I went on a double date at this particular Cheesecake Factory. You could totally feel this is a ""DATE"" place. When you are there, it screams ""first date"". I wasn't on a first date- This place is great during the summer, because you can sit outside on the patio day and night, without freezing your bum off. You just get amazing views of the city, without paying to dine at an expensive restaurant. I enjoy Cheesecake Factory's ambiance, but the dim lighting is sometimes too much... I like to see my food and friends! Their Tuexedo Cheesecake is amazing... Best I have ever had!"
John F.,"Celebration, United States",71,394,290,4.0,5/6/2011,"The reviews had us wondering if the experience was going to be as pleasant as the Cheesecake Factory we came to love in Buckhead, Atlanta, GA.  Though not as good as that one this place is well worth your visit and for sure ask for patio seating on a nice day so you can enjoy the wonderful view of Union Square.  We only had to wait for 20 minutes for our table and the service was fairly quick.  They worked hard to correct an error with our meal so no loss of stars there as errors happen and they went beyond in making sure we were taken care of.  We'll visit here again hoping for a repeat of this visit as we really did enjoy the view, food, which they provide rather large portions, and the service.  Good job Cheesecake Factory and wonderful location.   One tip I would have for others is use the escalators to bypass the line waiting for the one small elevator.  Sure you have to take a number of them to get up but the views along the way are nice and you can still beat those waiting on the cramped elevator car going up."
Ryan D.,"San Diego, United States",17,79,71,4.0,31/5/2011,Great place. The menu is a book. The wait on a fri night was 20 min at 5.30pm. Our 2 year was being a little pill that made use leave early...even the nice waitress offered to hold him. I had to scarf my food down to get the he'll out of there but what I did taste of the green chili burger it was the shit!
Jade N.,"Honolulu, United States",460,284,791,4.0,29/5/2011,"Plain and simple.  My sisters, cousin, and I were walking around and I was craving for the Dulce de Leche cheescake.  Yes....we went there to order two slices to bring back to our hotel.  The wait was worth it.  LOL.  The wait in the elevator and the wait to get the damn cheesecake....all for my cravings :)"
Jonathan C.,"San Bruno, United States",155,37,3,4.0,28/5/2011,This place is a landmark in San Francisco. The food is awesome. It is inside Macy. Good tourist place and good food.
Van N.,"San Leandro, United States",0,380,483,4.0,25/5/2011,Wait is too long at this location. Always at least 45 minutes. Sometimes up to 2 hours. I remember several times coming here only to be disappointed I wont be able to eat unless I decided to wait. I was hungry so a wait is definietely not in the plans. Otherwise the service is fantastic and the portions are big! Cheesecake is heavenly
Karen Y.,"San Rafael, United States",74,102,275,4.0,22/5/2011,"A wait to get seated is a given here as there are no reservations, I've come to accept that and plan accordingly based on the time or day of the week it is. Expect around an hour wait on weekends and maybe Friday nights.   :( slippery floor that gives me a scare every single time I'm there because one of my feet always slides on the greasy marble. overpriced drinks. often very oily food.  :) huge selection of food and, of course, cheesecakes to suit your cravings. complimentary sourdough and wheat/rye bread. very generous portions. very rich and boldly-flavored food, which are in my opinion DELICIOUS.  Three dishes I'm most familiar with:  Avocado Eggroll appetizers are yummy, crispy with a sweet-sour tamarind sauce but I can't eat more than one or two of these because there is so much avocado it's a bit overwhelming.  Quesadilla appetizer- crispy tortilla with cheese, green onions, chiles, chicken, sour cream and guacamole. Delicious and very filling. Bistro Shrimp Pasta- CRAVE this pasta whenever I'm at the Factory. The menu description tells you exactly why: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. Lastly, what makes everything worthwhile is a nice fat slice of cheesecake of your choice.. I can never get bored with all the different kinds they have, let the piggying out commence!!"
Annie S.,"San Francisco, United States",1189,541,490,4.0,20/5/2011,"Pros: - The view outside... SOOO. PRETTY. ASJFDLKASJLKFW. Especially at night during the holidays when the huge tree and ice rink are set up at Union Square. - The complimentary bread!! It's so good... I shamelessly ask for 234234 refills... heh  - All the different kinds of food on the menu - Large portions - Four Cheese Pasta (my favorite there-especially because I like cheese) - Red Velvet Cheesecake Con: - No reservations. The wait SUCKS. A LOT. My friends tried to throw me a surprise birthday dinner here one time... but long story short, the hours of waiting threw off plans and killed the surprise because they couldn't distract me for that long lol. I guess the wait is not so bad if you go downstairs and chill on one of the sofas at Macy's furniture section, but I don't think the Macy's employees like that."
Diane S.,"Houston, United States",306,948,153,4.0,20/5/2011,"This restaurant has the best view of union square! Outside seating isn't ideal since its always cold in ssf but they do have heaters. I love coming here during Christmas watching the people ice skate in union square so pretty. Portions here are very generous. I like their pastas. Pasta da venchi and evelyn's is really good. Free bread. The brown one is really good. minus one for plastic glasses, really get some glass ones! The wait is longer at night be prepared to wait at least 30 mins. Moderately priced, but well worth it!"
