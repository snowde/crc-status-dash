Sue M.,"Dearborn, United States",14,12,,4.0,16/5/2011,"Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait as long as it seems that others have. We had an amazing server and the food was great."
Amy L.,"Santa Clara, United States",401,747,273,4.0,15/5/2011,"I'm a pretty big fan of the Cheesecake Factory franchise. A normal entree is 2-3 meals for me, so I usually ask them to put 1/2 to go, on the get go. It helps me pace myself! My personal favorite is the Da Vinci pasta [yumm]. And their stuffed mushroom appetizer.. Oh gosh. And their bread! Their whole wheat bread is a little sweet, which I love. If you know how to control your portions, Cheesecake Factory is so worth it. The only problem with this one is that it's louder than most, but that's to be expected. I mean, it's on top of Macy's in Union Square! But the view... Mmm I love it! It might take awhile to be seated, but I like going out to the balcony and looking out over the city. I wasn't as in love with their red velvet cheesecake as I have been with other Cheesecake Factorys', but my best loved their Godiva cheesecake! :P"
Michael-Paggy W.,"San Mateo, United States",4,17,,4.0,15/5/2011,"It like going to Disney Land and getting on one of those roller coaster rides....you have to get in a long line, enter the elevator and go on top of Macy's. While in the elevator, you anticipate the excitement and fulfillment and how your tummy is going to thank you after you bite into that delicious cheese cake.  Went there with girlfriends and sat outside: it was really nice: We shared the following: -Ahi tuna roll, dipped in tempura and fried -Thai Chicken pasta -Miso Salmon -Key lime mango cheese cake They were all pretty good and of course I had to have a glass of champagne!!"
Erin H.,"Carlsbad, United States",167,390,64,4.0,12/5/2011,"I know...it's Cheesecake Factory. I'm pretty much only writing this to tell you about the new item - The Weight Management Grilled Chicken is amazing. And it's only 590 calories, yet I couldn't even eat half of it which means you can eat all those calories and more back with desert!  This place is usually very busy given it's location. The bartender that was there last night was obviously having a bad night - he was um - not very friendly. At all. Once we were seated service was decent and were seated at a booth right next to the patio so we had all of the view but none of the windy chill we saw everyone outside suffering with.  It's just nice to know there's a Cheesecake around when you're too overwhelmed or nervous to try the local fare."
Molly P.,"San Francisco, United States",9,191,9,4.0,9/5/2011,"I think this place gets mostly tourists, so as an SF local, I just have to say, this place is good!  Yes, the line can be ridiculously long, but one you're seated, the service is consistently good, and the food is always exactly the way it was the last time you had it, which I appreciate - at least there are no surprises.  Sitting on the deck with the heat lamps and view of Union Square is just really lovely.  I recently discovered the ""small plates"" section of the menu and love it, since I can never finish the huge entree servings.  I'm a fan."
Andrew W.,"San Francisco, United States",438,431,823,4.0,5/5/2011,"Food wise for all The Cheesecake factories our there are all about 3/5 for what you pay and what you get. The difference between this Cheesecake Factory is its location. This one is located on the top floor of Macy's, in Downtown San Francisco. One of the best views of SF if you eat outside on the balcony. On some occasion if there aren't enough people sitting outside and you are the only table, you might see pigeons patrolling, but they won't attack you so its not much of a problem and you can always just eat inside. What I recommend: Eat a sandwich or burger out on the balcony on a sunny day (rare in SF but great experience) Steak Diane Chicken Madera"
Julie M.,"San Francisco, United States",7,52,18,4.0,30/4/2011,"AWSEOME FOOD! BUT the wait is torture like 1 hour to sit down and 30 mins for the food to arrive,"
kimiko l.,"San Francisco, United States",43,22,38,4.0,20/4/2011,"On of my Favorite spots in Macy's. Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls ( comes with purple cabbage), with a side of mashed Potato's and asparagus. If I'm really hungry I will order the BBQ Salmon. Last but not least Cheese Cake, over 15 flavors. My Faves are Lemon Raspberry and Red Velvet. My BFF LOVE'S the Apple Pie. They have a big selection of food and a whole lot of Cheese Cake!! :) There's something here for everyone."
Lorissa W.,"Hercules, United States",95,520,118,4.0,19/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has become my weekday lunch venue.  I know that sounds pathetic but it's one of the few places in SF where you can sit down in a clean and nice looking dining room that overlooks the city and where you can order almost anything.  Albeit the prices are high but it's SF so The Cheesecake Factory is actually cheap for the ambiance and vast menu choices. Today, my mother ordered Evelyn's Favorite (13.95) but 10.95 if you order the lunch version.  It's smaller but it's still a good amount of food.  My mother is a big eater but she was basically pleased.  I wasn't hungry today so I just ordered their basic eggs dish which is surprisingly cheap (6.95).  Be forewarned that they only serve poached eggs on Sundays because that is when they have the egg poaching machine on.  I was hoping for roasted tomatoes to go with my egg dish but if you choose tomatoes instead of potatoes, you get three large slices of raw tomato.  My two sunny side up eggs were perfectly cooked and my English muffin was a little charred on one side but still pretty good.  I liked that they offer strawberry jam which happens to be my favorite type of jam.  All in all, we enjoyed our food.  On weekdays, the wait is only about 15 minutes to be seated and our waitress was really attentive."
Stephen S.,"San Diego, United States",181,108,16,4.0,9/4/2011,"Cheesecake factory got lucky that my group got smart. We went for dinner on a Monday night and the wait was 30-35 minutes which would have gotten them 3 stars, but we decided to hang out by the bar until a table opened. We were probably there for ten minutes before a table opened up. We asked one of the waiters if we could sit there and order food and he gave us a little attitude but indicated it was acceptable. We jumped on it and were on our way. Our server was really cool and we had fun joking around with her all night. She came right away and was generally there when we needed her. No one else was in the mood for beer but I ordered a tall glass of Stella which wasn't cheap but it wasn't too much and it did the job. The massive menu was no trouble for me (if there are too many options I just read and then pick something I remember lol). Two people in our group got burgers and one got the shrimp and chicken gumbo. Our food camp out in an oddly and annoyingly asynchronous order but it all came in good time (and the bread was actually a damn good complimentary appetizer). My burger was excellent. I asked for medium rare and it looked and tasted just right. The flavors were original, interesting, and delicious. I devoured it in between bites of sweet potato fries which were awesomely crunchy. All I heard about the gumbo was that it was spicy but not too spicy and that sounds pretty damn good to me. In the end I was a little buzzed and quite satiated. Despite the annoying problems, this place is awesome in my book."
Mary Ann M.,"Aliso Viejo, United States",209,279,30,4.0,8/4/2011,"This place never fails me.  I have never tasted anything that wasn't up to par.  Some of my favorites include:  chicken marsala, ribeye steak, herb crusted salmon, miso salmon, and crab rangoon.  I like to have some red or white sangria with my lunch/dinner too.  And don't forget the cheesecake with strawberries on top!  My favorite part!"
ILSC S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,4.0,7/4/2011,"Last Saturday I went to the Cheesecake Factory on Geary St. with my friend. It was my frist time visiting there. Maybe it was around 12PM, so it was very crowded. If I had been there with many people, I mgiht have had to wait for a long time. It was noisy but lively. I liked that mood. Also the décor was sophisticated.  We were able to choose where we wanted to sit like on the terrace or inside. We chose to sit inside, but if you choose the terrace, you can see all of Union Square. The food is not cheap but the portions and taste are really awesome. Before the main course, pieces of bread come out for free.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak, and Pasta Carbonara. It was around 35$. The steak was little bit salty but it was tasty. The Pasta was also delicious but there was not enough sauce, so we asked the waitress for more.  The servers were mostly kind. The only thing that bothered me was eventhough it was that even thought it was Saturday at lunch time, it took a long time when I asked for something.  Overall I recommend people go there,  It will not be a waste of money or a waste of time."
Alicia A.,"Contra Costa, United States",93,190,127,4.0,1/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is a-ok. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but this one in particular has a huge advantage because of its amazing view. I looked down and I was waving at my best friend Tiffany :)"
Mimi L.,"Torrance, United States",3209,1017,9804,4.0,31/3/2011,"i am a fan of cheesecake factory, it was a regular date dinner spot with my ex. we used to go to the one in Pasadena all the time. went to this one in union square with my bf on his biz trip,  it was so big, much bigger than any cheesecake factory in LA. and we asked a seating at sky terrace, we could overlook entire union square, it was amazing view! food is as good as always, drinks are tasty, don't know about cheese cake, cuz I am lactose intolerance. I supposed it is one of the best, cuz it is famous for cheese cakes right? :P good service, good food, portions are large. good for casual dinner date, friends hangout, a couple drinks, or family dinner. this place is good for pretty much everything . :)"
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, United States",78,357,149,4.0,29/3/2011,"Cheesecake factories tend to be consistent. I was visiting SF and went here with a friend for dessert only. Red Velvet + White Chocolate Raspberry cheesecake is a winner. Thing I like about this place is that they give you those ringer things that vibrate when your table is ready. Furthermore, you can take the escalator downstairs and lounge on the couches in the Macy's furniture store as you wait. Amazing view of Union Square outside."
J K.,"Los Angeles, United States",199,128,,4.0,25/3/2011,i Love the outdoor dining looking over the union square at night!  food is delicious i think it's the best cheesecake factory..better than the one in san jose. the service was nice.  carbonara pasta and pork chop was great and strawberry lemonade! mostly strawberry cheesecake! but the downside is that i went during the christmas break and i had to wait almost two hours to get seated and there were pack of people seriously. i think it's usually packed with people.
Annie D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,4.0,18/3/2011,"I personally love the Cheesecake Factory, and I believe it's one of my favorite restaurants. I have loved every single food item I've tried.  The big question is choosing between sitting indoors or out on the patio. The patio has a lovely view of Union Square - which is very beautiful around Christmastime. The downfall is freezing, because if you're an SF native or are visiting SF, you should know that 90% of the time, SF will be cold. Esp. downtown. Sitting indoors is cool too; love the decorating. The only parts I don't like about the Cheesecake Factory are its prices along with its wait time. The longest I've waited for my name to be called is 1 hr. 35 min."
Christina S.,"San Francisco, United States",6,201,,4.0,16/3/2011,"Nice place and good food.  However, it's always busy over there.  We went around 11:30am and still had to wait 45 minutes for a table.  The waiter was really friendly and our food came surprisingly fast.  Overall, it's a nice place, just make reservations first."
Patrick O.,"Sacramento, United States",148,282,,4.0,8/3/2011,Excellent location with a spectacular view of Union Square. The ideal place to take your girl to dinner during the holidays. If you don't have reservations you will of course have to wait for dinner. But at least you have Macy's to roam around in and mess around while waiting. The bacon cheese burger was awesome. Big portion for a very fairy price. Lighting is dim making it fairly romantic as well. This location is three times better than the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory.
april p.,"Daly City, United States",5,30,,4.0,6/3/2011,"This place makes me feel like i'm in Las Vegas...flashy.  Farmhouse burger with pork belly and fried egg...so messy, so fantastic.  Kids had the crabcake sandwich and  the shrimp and bacon club, both excellent.  Friendly service and i totally regret not a getting some cheesecake to go. I won't pass it up next time and we will definitely wait for the awesome outdoor seating."
