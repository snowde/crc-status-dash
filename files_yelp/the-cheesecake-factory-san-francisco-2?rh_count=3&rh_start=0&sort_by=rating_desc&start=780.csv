joe b.,"San Francisco, United States",46,183,17,4.0,1/3/2011,I keep trying to hate this place.  No luck so far.
Jacqueline N.,"San Jose, United States",312,248,84,4.0,13/2/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory. It's a nice restaurant. My friend and I were roaming San Francisco and decided to come here to eat since we just couldn't decide on anywhere else. It was on top of the Macy's building which you can walk out and wait for your table there. The view is lovely, of course! You can also sit outside which wouldn't be too bad since they put up some sort of plexiglass to keep the wind from hitting you. There are heat lamps, too. We were sat within 15 minutes. I ordered the steak diane-- delicious! I love the mashed potatoes that come with it and the sauce is amazing. My friend got the chicken madeira which is another favorite of mine. The sauce they put over that chicken is so good. We decided to be fancy and get a bottle of wine. We chose a german riesling that was about $35 a bottle. Worth it. The service was good. The server kind of took out plates a little prematurely, but I guess since we wanted to get dessert we didn't mind too much.  White chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Talk about orgasm in your mouth! Sorry for that inappropriate comment. But it was just so good. BTW, other times I've gone here (Other locations) I've gotten the Louisiana pasta, breakfast burrito, fried artichoke hearts, fried calarmari, herb crusted salmon-- all good!"
Ernest S.,"San Francisco, United States",202,18,,4.0,31/1/2011,"Cheesecake Factory The restaurant located on top of Macy's Building.  Food: ah... 3 stars.... Its okay... and its a bit pricey.... Cheesecake: I give them a extra star. The cheesecake was good. Dining: I would say... If you gonna bring your girlfriend to this place. Take her outside with this lightly dimmed area... Best place to have a date..  Waiting: Unless you trying to get to know the girl... You might not wanna spend 2 hrs waiting in line for a seat. LMAO..... Waiting is incredibly long..... Sadly... Reservation: Nope... Not that im aware of... Side Note: No, I didn't bring a date to this place. Maybe in the future.. ;) 4 stars for a place to dine on your first date. Who knows? You might get laid coming here ;) - Just Kidding.."
Jay B.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",104,409,360,4.0,30/1/2011,"We come here when we are in the city. The view from the outside is pretty cool.  The wait is PRETTY LONG!!  Your better off at the bar if you want some drinks and something to eat.  The food is alright but with some drinks, its delicious :)"
Melissa P.,"Manteca, United States",146,18,3,4.0,29/1/2011,Fan of the AMAZING food here and will always be back for more!! Been here a few times on day trips with my girlfriends and will usually have great service. Drinks are pricey but perfectly made. The shrimp scampi is AMAZING!!! Don't forget to get some cheesecake!!! Gets packed any day of the week and eating outside has an amazing view of Union Square. Oh and i LOVE staring at Tiffany's & Co. across the way!!!
Rebekah T.,"El Cerrito, United States",4554,2003,10334,4.0,25/1/2011,"Too early for an update? Not when you have Cheesecake photos like mine... Don't drool on your keyboard. :)  After going out to dinner and drinks, we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert and a little extra dinner for the hungry guy. We ordered Margaritas, Regular and Pomegranate for me. He ordered some Chicken Basil Penne dish. I was stuffed already.  The desserts were great. He's had quite a few and I'm new to the CF. He lets me believe I'm picking out which kind we are getting. We ordered the German Chocolate Cheesecake and Apple Strussel Cheesecake:  I'm having a hard time deciding which kind of cheesecake I like best, further research will be needed."
Dayae K.,"Los Angeles, United States",182,331,7,4.0,18/1/2011,"Had a very pleasant time at this cheesecake. First, it's on top of Macy's in the heart of San Francisco. The view from the restaurant was very nice. The only reason why I'm writing a review for the restaurant was because our server, Tiffany, was seriously one of the best waitresses I've had at a restaurant. My friends and I were starving and she was very quick, friendly, and caring. The food at cheesecake is always pretty delicious. I especially like their Asian chicken salad and Thai noodle salad."
Christine B.,"Brooklyn, United States",137,191,44,4.0,17/1/2011,"Normally I love the avocado egg rolls but my mistake was ordering this appetizer as my main meal.  It was a little too much after 2 pieces.  My friends' food was awesome though.  I didn't get a good view because we were sitting inside but the place that made this a 4 for me was our waitress (Tiffany hooked it up with the bread and was always super attentive to us).   If you want to eat at this Cheesecake, make sure to check in and get your name down first because the wait is likely to be 1-2 hours (also be sure to request outside seating).  Then just go shopping, do whatever and come back when the time is rizight.  Then you shall be a happy camper (and not feel like a hungry psycho)"
Jennifer P.,"San Francisco, United States",82,23,16,4.0,17/1/2011,"I like this place. I love how it is on the top floor and you can see then view from the outside patio through the macy's sign.. the service is always great every time I go there. The food is always consistent so it could never really go wrong. But One thing i hate about this place is the waiting time. Me,and friends come here a lot but we would have to wait 30mins to 1hr to be seated. There are limited seats and wainting area while we wait and it is always crowded everytime i go. When i get seated i always order appitizers and drinks. Pina Coladas are so good. you can't even taste one bit of the rum in the drink. it will creep on you. for raw fish lovers, try the ahi tartare (raw tuna on top of avocado with some kind of sauce with tortilla chip. sounds wierd but so good. now on to the entree, i would recommend people to try steak Diane or chicken teriyaki. For dessert, try red velvet cake or white chocolate resberry truffle cheesecake. really really indulging."
Stephanie G.,"Vacaville, United States",115,65,158,4.0,17/1/2011,"Beautiful day + great view of Union Square + hunger pains = Eat @ Cheesecake Factory's sky terrace My husband and I were very pleased with our most recent visit. We arrived on a Saturday evening at 5pm and only had to wait 25min for a seat on the sky terrace. That's quick! I don't know if my husband slipped a little extra to the worker but we were lucky enough to eat directly next to the ledge and overlook at all the ice skaters below. (During the winter season only.) We will probably go to Hell because we started laughing at people who fell on the ""ice"". Anyways, our waiter was very attentive to our needs and quick to act. He was also laidback and didn't hover over us while we ate. I gave this place 4 stars because it started to get a little chilly as the sun was going down and yet the standing heater next to us wasn't on and yet all the others were..."
Cassandra J.,"San Francisco, United States",82,523,12,4.0,17/1/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants that's a big chain so there's nothing overly special about them, has a lot of typical standard food that you can find elsewhere and usually better, but also manages to nail it just right on ""dear lord this is amazing"".  I've gone several times with coworkers and friends.  I can honestly say this is a great place to go with a few friends for a few drinks and desserts.  The cheesecake menu can't be beat and the drinks, while nothing to write home about, are decently priced and quite refreshing.  Getting a table on the balcony overlooking Union Square is the cherry on top for a great evening out. Be prepared for some nasty lineups and waits.  More often than not, the wait is at least 20 to 30 minutes, unless you have reservations.  This place is also extremely busy and chaotic.  Every time I've gone, it's jam packed.  The dishes are also really large so expect to bring home leftovers (the waiters warn you of this). I almost always get pasta or pizza dishes while I'm here.  I'd like to say I've never been disappointed, but if you go to a chain restaurant often enough you're going to get hit with a dud at least once.  My most recent trip was served with an overcooked fettuccine dish that just didn't taste good at all.  I did make up for it with the Macaroni and Cheese Ball appetizer, which alone makes it worth going to, along with a Reese Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake! Prices are decent, but can run a bit high if you're not careful.  If you have time to spare and enjoy a very large menu with a wide range of dishes, as well as some delicious cheesecake at the end, this is the place to go."
Stephanie D.,"San Pablo, United States",181,42,36,4.0,16/1/2011,"I owe my dues to this CF location just for the location & nostalgia it brings dating back to high school. It was the miso salmon & 50,000 cal. vanilla bean cheesecake slice that contributed to my baby fat because I found the word 'no' distasteful in general...every..other..weekend. Birthdays, group dates, first date, friend dates...were all at this Cheesecake location. I mean, CF isn't the best but it isn't thee worst CHAIN either. Housed on top of the Macy's in Union Square this CF is a busy one yet the times i've been there i have always managed to get seated within 15 minutes tops. Food, decent considering this is a chain but does have decent options for most tastes.  My top 3 CF picks: 1. Miso Salmon 2. Fried macaroni (I love the stuff) 3. Vanilla bean cheesex...cake. I do appreciate the cheesecake. There's something about open rooftop dining that I fancy, especially since this CF overlooks shopping of Union Square.  No other ground-level cheesecake location will have me frequent them either."
Eva H.,"San Francisco, United States",224,277,322,4.0,13/1/2011,Service: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5 Wait: 2.5/5 Price: $$ Presentation of food: 3.5/5 Presentation of restaurant: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 Louisianna Chicken Pasta Red Velvet cake
Erika L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",2,6,6,4.0,11/1/2011,"went there before the new year eve, and the wait was 2 and half hour, i was in shock to hear that but worked out perfectly because we went for ice skating for an hour in the union square. Food was nice, nothing fancy but service was excellent even in such a busy hour. Had couple of margaritas and it was good. overall had a descent time but their patio is beautiful and surround by heaters to protect you from SF chilly weather."
Sonya D.,"San Diego, United States",1610,651,37,4.0,11/1/2011,"This location is really nice. I love how the outdoor seating has a nice view of the city/big buildings surrounding it. It's also packed with people, so it took us at least 30 min to get a table. The food here is consistently good for being a big name chain. We started out with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were really yummy and came with 3 super tasty dipping sauces. After I ordered the Luau Salad, which had a better presentation than taste. I think I was a little disappointed because I was trying to be healthy, and instead it was practically all deep fried cracker. But if you're in the mood for that type of thing, it would be delicious. Their cocktails are also tasty and made strong. The guy I was with ordered the Fettuccine with Sundried Tomatoes and Chicken, which was really good. There are many other items on their extensive menu that I want to try, and why haven't I had the cheesecake the last two times I've come?? So good!"
Eric C.,"Berkeley, United States",65,330,5,4.0,10/1/2011,"Short story: How to score a table for 8 on New Year's Eve. Family was out shopping in the afternoon and we eventually decided to get dinner at Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy's in Union Square. This Cheesecake Factory has RIDICULOUS waits during weekends, so I was nervous how long we would have to wait. 4:30pm, I arrive at the counter and asked requested a table for 8. The hostess responded, it'll be a 2h 15m wait, here's a pager, come back in 1h 45m with your entire party since the buzzer only works on the top floor. I rejoin my family in the basement of Macy's. We walk around the ice rink at Union Square. 1h later, in the middle of Union Square, the buzzer sounds. Oh crap. We're still waiting for 2 people who thought dinner wouldn't be for another hour. I head back the up elevator with the buzzer vibrating in my back pocket, so loudly that everyone in the elevator hears it. I explain to the hostess that we weren't planning to be seated until 6:45pm. No problem, just come back when your party is all here. 6:15pm, everyone arrives at the Cheesecake Factory and I tell the hostess we're all here. 15 minutes later, we're seated. Food: the usual -- yummy, with huge portion sizes. Table: seated in a booth, but the floor was nasty and needed to be mopped. the floor was extremely sticky near the bathrooms. Service: the waiter who replaced our waitress while she took a 30 min break was a lot friendlier and attentive to our needs. Tip: Elevator has a weight limit. It'll beep and it won't move if the load's too heavy. That means someone has to get OUT of the elevator before it'll move."
Jae C.,"San Diego, United States",3,106,442,4.0,10/1/2011,"I've been to a LOT of cheesecake factories and in my opinion, this particular cheescake factory is thee best! The view is priceless. It's located on the top floor of the giant Macy's so it basically overlooks San Francisco.  Their pasta dishes are usually HUGEEE. and their cheesecakes are pretty good. All cheesecake factories basically offer the same dishes. I just enjoy going to this particular one because of the gorgeous view."
S Y.,"San Francisco, United States",285,387,5880,4.0,8/1/2011,"Okay, shoot me cause I don't even like cheesecake! I know, I know- people think I'm crazy! But cream cheese has never made a fan outta me, nor has cheesecake. Trust, I've tried and tried to like it. Being the dessert whore that I am, this is what I do at Cheesecake... After a meal, I order the Godiva Chocolate Brownie sundae, tiramisu, or strawberry shortcake to eat in. Thennnn I have my chocolate cake TO-GO, to have all to myself at home later haha. I must pay tribute to my most favorite-est chocolate cake ever, Chocolate Truffle Tower cake! I realize in my first review I didn't give credit where credit was due. Thin layers and layers of moist chocolate cake and chocolatey mousse, then frosted with chocolate truffle frosting (not too rich) and then the sides are coated with shards of chocolate. It's then topped off with possibly the best whipped cream ever. The whipped cream holds up on its own too- stays thick and creamy for days... it doesn't melt down to a watery mess over your yummy cake after some time. For years, Cheesecake Factory has made a regular out of me for this cake."
Grace Anne D.,"Concord, United States",266,364,623,4.0,7/1/2011,"I've never been to The Cheesecake Factory but I've had their red velvet cheesecake that was given to us from a family friend and it was delicious! So this one is at the top floor of Macy's. Beautiful view, we asked to sit outside. It was super cold outside but at least they had those warmer lamps. Our waiter was very nice and was patient, I liked how he sort of took command with who orders first and how the order of the table was gonna go (because there was 8 of us). We ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake (no surprise) and it was good, maybe I wasn't in the mood for something sweet but it was really sweet for me that we ended up not finishing it. :( I wanna try their food next time :)"
