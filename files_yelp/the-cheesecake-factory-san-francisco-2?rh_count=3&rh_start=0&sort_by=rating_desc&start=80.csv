Elena M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,36,5.0,4/6/2016,"I love everything about this place except the birds on the table, but what can they do about it. The food is so good. Even long wait does not scare me away from this place."
Stacy U.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",69,26,10,5.0,24/5/2016,"Who doesnt know about The Cheesecake Factory(CCF). Despite, they dont take phone reservation, only based on walk in and the long painful waiting I love this restaurant.  Today 6 of us had birthday dinner in CCF.  Steaks r always the yummiest things in the menu, if u r willing to eat a whole cow (yea the portion is generous)! I had big lunch so I skipped my beloved steak and ordered some small plates, it was really good. Fried tempura with sauce, and nacho appetizer.  One thing I have to mention is our waitress. Her name is Kristina, who was so nice, efficient and professional. Since Cheesecake factory is so big, sometimes u'd lose contact with ur servers. But not this time. She was there whenever we need her. And she uses the words like madam, my lady, my dear.... which is so cute.  I always appreciate the good services, which truly can lighten up the whole dining process."
Andy X.,"San Francisco, United States",2,12,,5.0,17/5/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. Although it is on the pricey side, the food makes up for it. My favorites here are the pastas and the buffalo wings. My goodness, the wings are so good. Cheesecake is what people usually come here for, but by the time I'm done with my meal, I'm already too stuffed for cheesecake. Food is delicious, you can go outside on the balcony to eat with a nice view of Downtown SF. It's also located in Downtown so you can get some shopping done afterwards."
Monsour R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,5.0,10/5/2016,I love this place ambiance and location. The best Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Take your date here. A must

Victoria M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,5.0,9/5/2016,"The waiter was very polite and the food came in a timely manner. Also, the waiter refilled my Sprite without asking!! Pretty sweet."
Kelly G.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,13,1,5.0,27/4/2016,Tried the gluten-free chocolate cheesecake and it was very yummy and decadent. Was able to substitute ice-cream for the cream.
Dustin O.,"Concord, United States",121,11,1,5.0,24/4/2016,"Dropped in for lunch,  food was what you'd expect from CF, but the service was amazing!!! I go out to eat 3-4 times a week and this was the best service I've had in years.  Kathryn F. is the definition of an attentive server.  My order was taking promptly, my drink never went empty, and my very specific order was delivered exactly as I requested. Definitely going to be back to this location soon."
Morgan A.,"Downey, United States",11,27,2,5.0,24/4/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, nothing fancy. Their location is awesome. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the view. There was quite a bit of birds flying/walking around but I don't think that's something they can fix. The turned the heaters on when it was getting colder. The service was great, and so was the food."
Jefferson D.,"Daly City, United States",87,5,,5.0,21/4/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory last week. I got a Margherita pizza and an Oreo cheesecake. The pizza was pretty good, thin and crispy dough, perfect quantity of cheese. The Oreo Cheesecake was amazing, very tasty, sweet and huge. Our server was very polite. The pizza was $15 and the Cheesecake $7, it is a great price for that great dinner. I definitely recommend the Cheesecake Factory."
Portland M.,"Hillsboro, United States",0,14,,5.0,17/4/2016,Underrated. This place deserves more credit for their location and service. Food was excellent and fast even during the rush.
Billy F.,"Indio, United States",1,2,5,5.0,31/3/2016,"Great service, great food. The wait 10 minutes. No problem. Love the food the waitress Erika, love her. First time here, it's on the 8th floor but I think it's very cool. Please come it's amazing."
Heather T.,"Irvine, United States",0,28,8,5.0,28/3/2016,The Cheesecake Factory has a Super Food menu! I had the Vegan Cobb salad and it was amazing! Thank you for providing great vegetarian and vegan options. Seating outside is very nice.
Brenda C.,"Berkeley, United States",0,59,11,5.0,17/3/2016,"I hadn't been here in YEARS..and forgot about the overly large portions they serve, so we will have leftovers for a couple days.  I had the grilled fish tacos with a wonderful. Cilantro rice and black beans.  My granddaughter had the fetticine.  The 5 stars were worth it!  We waited about 15-20 min to be seated and after seated we were promptly services and received our orders. Food tasted --well--- like typical restaurant chai food and it was served and presented with perfection.  Having dinner at The Cheesecake Factory was great and unexpected.  Having a fun dinner with my granddaughter while she's here in Spring Break ---well of course---it was priceless."
Bryan C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, United States",57,20,61,5.0,13/3/2016,"Was here during the last Week of Christmas and man was it busy. The wait was crazy but the host/ess were very efficient. What's more fun it's situated on 8th floor of an insane sized Macy's. The clientele was mostly tourists like myself and very pushy and rude but the servers kept a smile on their face the entire time. I ordered grilled salmon the way they used to make BBQ salmon over succotash with a side of sweet potato fries. Had a apple strudel cheesecake with a side of ice cream. The food was excellent in presentation and taste / texture. The view from the patio was pretty amazing. During that time there was a Christmas tree and a roller skating rink with many people having a good time. I want to thank the waitress Gabriella for such a great experience and for keeping a smile when the table with the trash family started belittling her for some butter... As my wife and I understand how incredibly hard it is to be a server we hope you don't let ""little"" people degrade the joy you bring to people. We will visit again soon!"
Vanessa Z.,"San Francisco, United States",15,28,257,5.0,6/3/2016,Just love the food and service there! We ordered shepard's pie & garlic lemon shrimps on angel hair pasta. The setting is good.
Maiya P.,"Harbor City, United States",1,6,,5.0,14/2/2016,The service was amazing from the manager down to our wonderful server Demetris!!!!! He went all out giving us three servings of bread. He refilled our water numerous times and even split the check up. And get this we had 16 people!!!!!! That's what I'm talking about
Blake D.,"Aliso Viejo, United States",1,4,,5.0,7/2/2016,"I had the best customer service experience here at this specific Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco out of any experience anywhere. The manager Julie was the most patient, thoughtful and sweetest woman ever. We had some minor hiccups with our dishes but she handled the whole experience with such ease and with such an amazing attitude that it made the whole situation so much easier to deal with. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a dining experience paired with unprecedented customer service. Thank you Julie"
