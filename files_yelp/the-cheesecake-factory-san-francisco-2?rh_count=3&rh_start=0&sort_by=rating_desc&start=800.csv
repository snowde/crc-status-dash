Nand D.,"Berkeley, United States",0,31,,4.0,7/1/2011,"Took two girls here on first dates, including my wife.  Food is always good, and portions are filling.  Only thing is the wait.  Expect 45+ minute waits, even at off peak times.  At least you can wander around Macy's with the pager.  They are very good at keeping their estimated wait time.  I almost never eat cheesecake here, because I'm usually full from the entrees and appetizers."
Lena S.,"San Francisco, United States",17,39,19,4.0,4/1/2011,Going here is always fun... usually I'm with my boyfriend and friends..  Went here recently for New Years Eve... oh man talk about PACKED and a 2 hr wait.. but it was still good.. from the view to the people working there..  When I go here I always have to have pasta... something about it is just soo delicious plus they grate fresh parmesan cheese over the pasta... even though I usually have them grate about half the cheese but hey what can I say... I love cheese on pasta... YUMMY...
Jason C.,"Morgan Hill, United States",5,43,,4.0,3/1/2011,Great view of the Geary St garage and park. Ahh I remember those days with my friend Olga sitting outside watching the shoppers bustling about. Cheesecake Factory by itself is a 3 star place but this location gives it one extra. Make time between Thanksgiving and Christmas so you can spy on the beautiful christmas tree in the park above the Geary St parking garage. I don't get a chance to see the huge one at Rockafeller Center in NY so the one in San Francisco is the closest I can be most of the time.  It's way bigger than anything I ever have. (I've never had a real tree :(
Jan P.,"San Leandro, United States",1707,462,1259,4.0,2/1/2011,"It gets very crowded and touristy around the afternoon here - so come through early if you can if you want to avoid the crowd and wait time.  Immediately, we got seated right away for 2 at a nice table spot next to the window glass that overlooks Union Square - the view was quite spectacular!  First things first - Host team, thumbs up! Y'all are very welcoming. I like it when the hosts address me, instead of me having to get their attention.  My server was an awesome server, he was very attentive. It took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted; he was very patient with our ordering time. Not to mention, he kept our glasses filled with water the entire meal. Which is quite a feat, considering we drink like fish. Chicken Marsala and bed of mushroom - savory, very rich in flavor & thick.  Pepperoni pizza - nothing too special here. Good for someone who doesn't know how to order.  The cheesecake was great. Goodness! I had the original cheesecake.  $6.75 for a slice, folks.  It was a great experience, all around. Very good, very decadent, and very fun to share."
Grace M.,"Las Vegas, United States",10,12,3,4.0,2/1/2011,"Oh Cheesecake Factory...how I adore thee. I come here quite religiously with one of my best friends and end up having a great experience every time. Every one of our waiters were exceptionally nice ESPECIALLY when we went there for new years eve, our server Michael was the sweetest darling ever. He was just so kind and really sincerely felt like he cared about our well being not like other servers who just suck up. Therefore we gave him a 30% tip and our phone numbers. Yup. That's how good he was. Couple negatives are: the location. Yeah it's on top of Macy's and you get to see the view of Union Square from outside but when you think about it, the elevator wait & the escalator inconveniently placed in the middle of all the madness is just stupid. I give this place 4 stars cause of that and the ridiculous long waits. THOUGH the furniture section of Macy's is conveniently a hop skip and a jump down the escalator so unfortunately for the furniture sales associate, that's a great place to sit back and relax on $2000 sofas during your 2 hour wait ;D Anywho, I've tried a variety of plates here but I've officially fallen head of heels for the Chicken Bellagio on the 'special menu' card... Two large pieces of chicken on a bed of basil pasta topped with arugula, prosciutto, with cream sauce..  OOoooo just typing that makes my mouth water...I LOVE IT. And the price is perfect. If you've been to Cheesecake before, you'll know how generous the proportions are and for $12.95, I think that's a great deal since I always end up taking half of it togo so I can savor it at home :D I also love their pastas but for $15.95 a plate, that's just wayyyyyyy to expensive. I recommend eating the pasta ONLY during lunch when it's considerably cheaper. Same for their crab cakes...three tiny palm sized cakes for $11.95??? Uh, no. (but they were sooooooo goddang good!)  Now cheesecake. I always never end up getting any cause I'm always so stuffed from eating the complimentary bread and then the meal but once in a while I give in. I absolutely love the Kahlua Chocolate Coffee Cheesecake, The Tuxedo, and the Classic Cheesecake with Fresh Strawberries. YUMMM~! ALSO. Their frozen Peach Bellini and for the non alcohol Strawberry Lemondae. GET IT. DRINK IT. ENJOY IT. I did. Freakin' fabulous."
Julie C.,"San Francisco, United States",90,387,1343,4.0,28/12/2010,"I come here whenever I get the chance - mainly for the outdoor, high rise seating view.  It is absolutely breath taking to be sitting on the top floor on a beautiful sunny day in Downtown SF.  You get the breeze, the sun, the nice service and some pretty delicious food. The must orders:  Avocado Rolls as the appetizers, the Mango Raspberry as the drink, and salad of almost any kind... I stick with the Cobb Salad on most occasions.  I use to have the pastas a lot, but then I noticed either the flavors got bland or my taste for pastas here went away.  I believe they have a dish called Bang Bang Chicken here and that's tasty as well.  They also have good desserts. The wait can be quite long - there are days when I've waited for a good 50 minutes, but you get to roam around Macy's while you wait."
Amanda S.,"Campbell, United States",293,418,17,4.0,26/12/2010,"There's honestly nothing SUPER special about this place. It's just like any other Cheesecake Factory- but there is a pretty amazing balcony with gorgeous views of San Francisco. If you end up in the city on a bright and sunny day and find yourself in Union Square I definitely recommend it. Also if you're finished with a day full of shopping come in for a nice hot spiked drink and watch the ice skaters and all the gorgeous christmas lights! The portions.. are.. HUGE. even when I order a ""lunch"" portion which is supposed to be significantly smaller, I still take home half of it.  I've had pretty much everything here. Usually my girls and I order a TON of apps and share a huge salad. The road side sliders are a great way to start off. The fried macaroni and cheese is pretty good but in my opinion a bit salty..? Southern fried chicken sliders are yummy and have a small kick (paprika?) that I love! The sweet corn tamale cakes are actually fairly decent for the size and yummy. The samosas.. yeh I've had better. Crabcakes- stfu. So yummy. I have never met a crabcake I didnt like.. Last time I was here I had the fish tacos. SO EFFING AMAZING. I wanna say it was around $13 and I got 4 huge delicious tacos filled with veggies and avocado. UGH. I died. I like every salad minus the iceburg salad (who seriously wants to pay $12 for a head of lettuce?) and their mixed drinks are delicious. In the past 8 years I've dined at any Cheesecake Factory I've yet to have any of their cheesecake... I'm not a huge fan.. but if I ever do I'll report back!"
Sujan H.,"Sydney, Australia",290,185,652,4.0,25/12/2010,"Whether you are a tourist or a SF resident I think TCF is a fun place to come.  Waiting does suck and if you haven't got time to wait, just come up hear to soak up the view of Union Square (if you are a tourist).   Having said that what we had (Shrimp Scampi & steak, Chicken medallions) were good.    My mum who was visiting from New Zealand enjoyed being in a huge restaurant with so many people.  We were too full for any dessert but will come back for cheesecakes (probably to go) another time."
bryan d.,"Moss Beach, United States",3,6,1,4.0,22/12/2010,"I am always excited to eat here. I consider it one of my favorite restaurants, it serves delicious food and has a very good peach smoothie. It is always crowded but the wait is worth it.  The only bad experience I had here was yesterday, the service was terrible. It took over 5 minutes for my lemonade to arrive and my baja chicken tacos were given to me after my friend had already finished her lunch! Not to mention I finished all my tacos before my rice and beans were brought to the table."
Sin-Yaw W.,"San Jose, United States",78,608,104,4.0,19/12/2010,"If you come to San Francisco and its Union Square, you need to visit Cheesecake Factory on top of the Macy building.  Find a table outside on the balcony that overlook Union Square.  This is the best vantage point. Of course, the foods are good.  I had a beer and my company ordered cheesecakes.  All other tables came large portions of foods that are decadent yet artery clogging. But that's not the point.  Where would you lunch with a seagull next to you, but safely behind a glass wall?   The bird would touch you if it weren't for the glass. They ran out of pumpkin cheesecake though.  Oh well..."
Hilary L.,"Berkeley, United States",315,43,6,4.0,17/12/2010,"This place is amazing, and also very dependent on your order, so my love for the place changes depending on what I get. Yesterday I went on a thursday night and it was jam packed, had to wait for over an hour, but once we got seated, there were freshly baked bread on the table ready for us, which is wonderful because we were starving. Then I ordered the crusted salmon with Diane steak, which was delicious, the Diane steak anyway, the salmon was okay. the steak had great flavor and nice chewy mushrooms which tasted great when you eat one after the other.  They also served great creamy red potatoes and were just amazing. The price was as expected, not too overloading and not cheap, my place came out to be 20$ but it was a very large portion which I took some of it to go. I also ordered the factory chopped salad witch was delicious-the mix of apples in there was definitely a plus. Then we ordered the towering cake which was comprised of sooo many layers, but it was moist with just the right amount of chocolate that wasnt too overindulging. I also ordered the cheesecake before, and definitely know why those things are famous, there is no way you could go to cheesecake factory without ordering what they're famous for. Its absolutely amazing, and im not such a big fan of sweets, but always have to get one of these whenever im there. So i ordered two meals, a salad, and a desert and the total came out to be 75$ which includes tip and tax, pretty pricy for two people, but somewhat expected. The atmosphere is great, dim lighting, clean place, on top of san francisco's macys, giving you a great view of the city, there's a Tiffany's co. right across, and making the view that much better. But there was also the christmas trees and things like that. Overall, this place is a must go for those who havent."
Arnel B.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,62,2,4.0,16/12/2010,"Let me say first of all, I am not a food snob. While I LOVE discovering new restaurants and cafes, I am not going to avoid good food because it is made by a corporation. I have to say, I love the cheesecake factory. I don't think I have ever had bad food here. This location has an amazing view, and a staff that has always been courteous to me. The location is always extremely busy, so I am taking away one star for the long waits."
David O.,"Foster City, United States",15,205,727,4.0,12/12/2010,"I would say the Cheesecake factory has inexperienced to moderately experienced wait staff & management, based on the other reviews and my experience for this union square location  they seam lean more on the inexperienced side. When I arrived I noticed most of the beautiful marble floors were quite greasy / slippery most likely from dropping dishes throughout the day and not taking the time to clean it up properly. When we arrived we were told there would be a 45 minute wait, so we got a glass of champagne and went outside to look an the view of Union Square with all of the holiday decorations and lights. We did get our table in the anticipated time, for us the waiters were good and food as well however we did wait longer than usual for the dinner to arrive but the food was tasty. Our table had a very nice view of the dining room and the skyline so for us the over all experience was quite positive."
Sean B.,"Alameda, United States",16,61,3,4.0,10/12/2010,"Great views of union square if you sit outside...huge menu...most entrees are huge, reasonably priced...and of course..the cheesecake...the other desserts are pretty good too...the brownie sundae and apple crisp..."
Yanira N.,"McLean, United States",0,3,,4.0,7/12/2010,Love this place. Specially the creolle style food - spicy and great - shrimp and beans!  Portions are huge. The cheesecakes themselves are also very good ;-).
VB L.,"San Mateo, United States",971,720,826,4.0,5/12/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has the best appie menu, but this one has all the other stuff to go with it.  First, you can't beat the view.  I spent the whole time watching ice skaters while waiting for my table.  The crew was squeegeeing off the patio because it had poured rain earlier and they were really in a crunch for tables.  Buzz buzz buzz goes my placeholder telling me my table was ready and the cheery staff showed me the way.  I got a great little table with a good view.  People were being seated outside because the weather was clearing and the Christmas tree in Union Square highlighted the Christmas music inside the restaurant.  I ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls and Sliders, both done to perfection.  Although the waiter was SO busy, he was a sweetheart and joked with me about sitting down to enjoy the meal with me.   All of a sudden the rain started again and BOOM ~ chaos!!  All the people outside had to be moved inside.  Birds flying everywhere to get the food abandoned by folks.  People pouring inside with nowhere to sit, watching their food drown in the puddles of water accumulating on their plates.  Through all of this, the staff was awesome!  Everyone was taken care of, the birds chased away and the food shuffled off to some hidden location.  The food was great and the entertainment value superb.  I'm going back tomorrow.  Gee, I hope it rains again."
Darlene Q.,"Temple City, United States",15,241,58,4.0,2/12/2010,"This is nice to be above Macy's. I can just go shopping after or before I eat. They serve a lot of food so I have to walk it off after I eat, so I go shopping."
Christopher J.,"Eureka, United States",59,12,3,4.0,28/11/2010,"I spent the day after Thanksgiving here, enjoying the tree-lighting ceremony in Union Square, and it was fantastic!!! We had a table on the patio of the restaurant, which is located on the 9th floor of the Macy's building on Union Square. The patio had a great view of the square, and the huge Christmas tree they had decorated for the holidays. We had a rather large group, and they were nice enough to give us two tables on the patio. First of all, this restaurant has a huge menu, probably twenty pages, the first three just drinks! I could eat there many times in my life and have something different every time! To drink, I had a Ritz Martini, which is Courvoisier cognac, champagne, orange juice, and Cointreau. It was perfectly proportioned, not too strong, but tart and sweet, delectable! We also ordered a bottle of 2009 (which is admittedly a young bottle) Colores Del Sol Malbec, a delicious Argentinian red. For its age, this was a very well-executed wine, very expressive and rich.  We started out with some appetizers, a delicious raw ahi roll, flash-fried tempura style and served with fresh green onion slivers on top. Absolutely delicious when dipped into the sweet sesame dip that it came with! For an entree, we shared the Chicken Stuffed tortillas, which technically was a quesadilla, but so much better. The perfect amount of cheese, didn't overpower the chicken at all, with a tasty jalepeno/cilantro garnish, and black beans and a corn polenta on the side. Though the restaurant was incredibly crowded due to the event going on in the square, our waitress gave us incredible service. She even brought out a more adept waitress to open our bottle for us, as she was worried about messing it up (ha ha ha.)  I was very impressed with her friendly professionalism, and fine service despite the massive crowd of people in the dining room.  Definitely will go back, may even make that exact spot a post-Thanksgiving tradition! I'd recommend to anyone who asked."
Katherine A.,"Honolulu, United States",137,128,245,4.0,19/11/2010,"What kind of crazy tourist goes to Cheesecake Factory for dinner when there are a handful back home in and around Los Angeles? Me. Well, I was sold when I found out it was on top of a Macy's. Took the elevator up and they asked me whether I wanted indoor or outdoor seating. Wait outdoor? Yes, there is amazing view of Union Square when you decide to eat outdoors. I'm a sucker for amazing views and that sold me. Service was great, ain't complaining there. I think I'll be coming here more often when I'm up here in SF just for the view. I love Cheesecake Factory anyways so its a win for me!"
Angelica D.,"Oakland, United States",181,112,247,4.0,6/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one place you'll have to try at least once. Love their avocado eggrolls! And, of course, the cheesecake! They have a pretty wide selection of food, but if you're goal is the cheesecake, I'd suggest eating somewhere else first (or at least well in advance), because you won't have any room by the end of your meal for any of that cheesecake goodness. It's also in a great location and was one of the few decent places nearby powell that are still open around 10:30 p.m. During peak hours, it gets really busy, and you'll want to come early if you have any hope of getting seated."
