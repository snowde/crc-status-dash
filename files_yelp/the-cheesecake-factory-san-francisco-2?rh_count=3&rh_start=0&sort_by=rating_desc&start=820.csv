Bleep S.,"Tucson, United States",273,788,1032,4.0,26/10/2010,I can only speak for the plain cheesecake topped with strawberries. Indescribably delicious....
Mimi P.,"Orange, United States",493,708,5548,4.0,15/10/2010,"I am a big fan of the cheesecake factory.  You can never go wrong here.  They have great appetizers, salads, pastas, and fish.  The shrimp scampi is one of my favorites; also try the miso glazed salmon.  The sauce is delish- might be sweet some people tho.  And of course, don't forget about their selection of cheesecakes.   I love the cheesecake factory in SF because of the location.  You can enjoy lunch and take in the city.  Everytime I come up to the bay area, I try to find time to stop by for lunch.  Only downfall is that the wait can take a long time."
Serena S.,"Menlo Park, United States",4,14,5,4.0,9/10/2010,I had a salad it was very good. The portions are very big.The wait staff was very helpful.  I also left my iphone on the bar  and when I returned for it more than 2 hours later someone had turned it in thank goodness. This store is inside Maceys at the top floor and has a great view of Union Square.
Eileen M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,5,,4.0,15/9/2010,"I have never been here for dinner because the lines have always been too long. However, I love going for lunch when the lines aren't as intimidating. It is such a lovely place to go when it's a nice day because the view is amazing, you can see all of downtown. My mother and I like to order a pizza and a salad with a few beers it's the perfect amount of food for two people and it is pretty inexpensive. The waiters every time I have been there have been very nice, I would recommend this place to anyone coming into town."
Nat R.,"Martinez, United States",11,122,157,4.0,12/9/2010,"Dude, don't just dock off stars cuz the line is too long.  That's the thing, it is so popular that the wait is averages an hour. Their Louisiana Chicken Pasta is solid, and they always give you more than you can eat in one sitting. When you wait, they will ask if you want to eat outside or in.  Usually the wait is longer for indoor seating, since I guess folks are concerned it is too cold outside.  If you can, choose outside, at least for the unique dining experience.  There are heat lamps that will warm you and your significant other."
Jason C.,"San Diego, United States",28,17,1,4.0,6/9/2010,"It's Cheesecake Factory for god's sake.  There's a million things on the menu. If you can't find something you like, stay home and cook for yourself.  Because it's a chain, I'd automatically give it 3 stars, but this particular location gets an extra star for the fantastic outdoor deck overlooking Union Square."
Vira P.,"San Francisco, United States",336,1141,1134,4.0,28/8/2010,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  You'll always find something you'll like and in big portions.  I now order a bunch of appetizers and small plates when eating with family and close friends.  I find myself feeling full but not stuffed and I have room for dessert. The location is the reason for my rating.  It's at the top of Macy's in Union Square and you can sit outside and enjoy the city.  I was lucky enough to have my party seated right away, because most of the time you need a reservation. If you want to eat here from Fri evening-Sunday, you most likely need to call ahead.  Otherwise, if you're there on a weekday like me, you'll get seated quickly.  But call ahead anyway just to make sure."
Betty L.,"Vancouver, Canada",60,164,,4.0,25/8/2010,"Even though I was never a fan of American chains, I was pleasantly surprised by The Cheesecake Factory.  After a long day of shopping at Union Square, I was  really hungry and tired.  I didn't have to wait long for a table.  The server was really nice and friendly.  Portions were huge.  I went with two other people.  When we saw the huge portions we decided two order two dishes for sharing.  The oriental chicken salad was pretty good because the sauce was light and refreshing.  It didn't make the rest of the salad soggy.  There were lots of greens and chicken.  Too bad they added a lot of the fried tortilla like chikps on top.  The guacamole was pretty good too.  The avacados were fresh and had a good tartness to it.  Like we requested, it was spicy.   However I found the mojito to be a bit too sweet and not enough limes in there.  Yet once again it was a  huge drink. Overall it's a good place for a quick bite after a looong day of retail therapy."
Brian W.,"Orange County, United States",37,85,20,4.0,25/8/2010,"Despite my tough standards for chains, Cheesecake Factory almost always delivers. I've gone enough to find their menu predictable and bland, but their food excels in its class. I'm reviewing this location (as a tourist from So Cal.) due to the view. The view of Union Square is an excellent touch which separates this from every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. But I was the third party in line, and would not wait hours to simply have the view. Back to the food though, very satisfying for its class and you almost cannot go wrong with most everything on the menu. And of course, your cheescake is a delight. Four stars as an all around restaurant and chain, although the MANY great restaurants in SF deters me from any future visits to this location."
Song C.,"San Francisco, United States",486,373,134,4.0,23/8/2010,"** Best to go on a week day. Worst to go on the weekends because of all the  shoppers and tourists. ** I think I celebrated a birthday here ... it was def on a week night. Too many good dishes to name but you can never go wrong with the burgers, steaks or pastas. If you are looking for a light meal, try the salmon.  Salads are gi-normous!  Chicken is always a safe bet. Tuna carpaccio and avocado egg rolls are the must haves!"
Amanda S.,"San Francisco, United States",91,47,7,4.0,22/8/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Yeah, at first I thought this restaurant only served cheesecake, which I thought was weird. Anyway, they don't JUST serve cheesecake..its more than that! I've always ordered different dishes--ordered a pizza, jambalaya pasta, angel hair pasta and a tons of fun burger. I love their complimentary bread and butter! All of the portions are HUGE! And the dishes are delicious. I always have leftovers because I'm a small person :) Expect to pay about $10+ a dish. The service is great, overall. Never a problem with any of the waiters/waitresses! They are very friendly. This place is perfect for a date, birthday, anniversary, whatever you want it to be. One thing I don't like are the wait times to get a table. They don't take reservations. So its best to arrive there once it opens. If not, you're better off taking a pager and wandering around the floors of Macy's, or going somewhere else. Another thing I am not too fond of is the outdoor seating. Yes, the view is breathtaking but during one of my visits, pigeons were flying around occasionally and trying to eat my food. And San Francisco weather can be very windy, so my hair would blow all over the place while I'm eating my food. And it was so cold! Not sure if they installed heaters by now. Make sure you get a cheesecake after your meal! It's what they are known for. I tried their Kahlua Cheesecake--delicious!"
Lacy K.,"Oklahoma City, United States",10,77,,4.0,21/8/2010,The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the variety of the menu. This location has a good view from the patio.
Henry C.,"Torrance, United States",3328,403,8,4.0,20/8/2010,"Cheesecake Factory....The name says it all... I can't imagine anyone in US who lives by one of these chain locations and have never been to one.  So to make this short and sweet, I will assume (even though I shouldn't) that everyone knows the food and it's concept and move toward my straightforward experience. Our party got the following on the trip to San Francisco Marghareta Pizza:  Simple and tasty!  Can't be the good old traditional taste of Mozza cheese, basil, and tomato! The Crunch Burger:  I think that's what's called on the menu.... humongous burger with fries....didn't taste it but looked really filling and tasty though Calamari:  I love the cheesecake factory calamari with the green sauce that they got...Very  yummy indeed! Cajun Jamalaya Pasta:  Full cajun flavor with lots of spices but was a bit on the salty side... slightly disappointing how salty it was compared to the one served by my neck of the woods.  Can't expect the exact taste I guess. Factory Meat Loaf:  Large portions of tasty meatloaf, (something I don't usually get), with Corn and veggies on the side (special request for steam veggies is available!)  Actually terrific meat loaf and would definitely get it again. Finally, got the fresh strawberry cheesecake...General consensus:  TOO SWEET!!!  All the cheesecakes offered here are good but is on the sweet side, so I guess no one in my party really enjoyed sugar ""that much"" so it wasn't anything to brag about.... The location was awesome...On top of the Macy building (8th floor) and was seated outside on the patio overlooking UNION SQUARE.  Loved the view and really enjoyed this meal for this reason....Good thing the wait was ok as we got there little earlier and it was on a weekday, otherwise, I can see it being a pain waiting for a table there.. it finally got way too crowded when we were about to leave, so best go early if possible. Waiter was friendly and overall service was the typical Cheesecake Factory performance.  There was a special waiter who was slightly annoying though... he/she kept wanting my meat loaf!!!  Literally!!! The waiter was this huge seagull... sitting on the ledge... serving me personally......staring at my food....................for about 15 minutes!!!!!!!!!"
Skylar S.,"Los Angeles, United States",52,177,14,4.0,18/8/2010,"The food is good enough. The service is pleasant enough. The line, however, is always long (hours during peak times) and let's face it. For the quality of food served, the place is a bit on the overpriced side. However, this place is popular enough and will always be loved by the teenage crowd who seem to love this place.  Overall, pleasant enough, but not GREAT GREAT."
Eric R.,"Austin, United States",0,7,,4.0,18/8/2010,Cuban sandwich is pretty good. The oreo cheesecake was awesome
Jeff O.,"San Francisco, United States",8,55,14,4.0,8/8/2010,"I love this place for their Chinese chicken salad, chesecakes and their avacado egg rolls. The wait is what takes the star away."
Marisa R.,"San Francisco, United States",200,195,16,4.0,2/8/2010,"The wait is sooooooo long if you go at peak times.  But, it is damn worth it.  They have a menu the size of the Bible.  There's something for everyone!!  I love the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. And their brown bread (free).  Slow service for the most part. But, once in awhile you get lucky and get a good one.   Ambiance is really nice because it's on the top of Macy's and the view is beautiful."
Britany F.,"San Francisco, United States",1,57,,4.0,2/8/2010,"I usually always bring friends visiting from out of town to this cheesecake factory because of the amazing view of union square from the top of Macy's.  It is usually pretty freezing at night in San Francisco, but there are heat lamps out on the patio that make it bearable with a jacket.  If you can' take the cold, the inside seating is nice.  The food and service are good--typical cheesecake factory.  The only problem is that on weekends the wait to be seated is super long. Like 2 hours. And, no, you cannot make reservations.  To alleviate our boredom, me and my guests usually head to the furniture area in Macy's to sit on the couches and talk until our buzzer buzzes.  Next time I think I might bring cards. Even though the people working there claim that the buzzer does not work outside of the building, that is a complete lie.  I took mine across the street and into another store and it worked just fine.  Also, last time I was there it was really busy.  My friend's pasta took a slightly long time coming out.  Because of this ""wait"" (of like ten extra minutes) the manager gave it to us for free (without us even asking).  It was a nice gesture."
Sherrell D.,"Pittsburg, United States",10,57,16,4.0,30/7/2010,I've been to this location on more than one occasion both times were totally different.  First time:  I had a large group with me it was a Saturday evening so it took forever. The group was over 10 people and after a few hours of waiting we got our table it was later on in the evening around closing so everyone wanted to go home... the service could have been better regardless of how long you've been on your feet... Any way the food was great but they forgot to put in my friends order and she ended up getting a free meal out of there mess up .. Bonus points.  *Minus: Can't call ahead for reservations. *  Second Time:  It was just my brother and I. (lil' dinner here just cause!)  Looked at a few Yelpers! suggestions to sit on the patio and we were seated very quickly. The view was wonderful as we looked down over Union Square! The service was great we didn't have to ask for any refills or anything our waiter was on it!  with a meal under our belts + cheesecake it was over ... sleepy time for sure!  *Minus: - Patio seating is wonderful if you like to eat with the Pigeons. they cleaned up the tables faster than the wait staff You would think with a restaurant like this the situation wouldn't be this way.  * (The Staff did clean the tables in a quick & sanitary manner. Better believe I was looking!)  Come during a week night if you can ASAP you will get seated quickly in or outside.
Kathleen M.,"Hercules, United States",30,13,5,4.0,19/7/2010,all i gotta say is... RED-VELVET-CHEESECAKE!!!!! was the best cheesecake i've ever had.  definitely worth it to get that.
