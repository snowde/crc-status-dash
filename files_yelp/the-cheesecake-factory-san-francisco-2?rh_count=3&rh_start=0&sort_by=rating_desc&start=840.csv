Daniel S.,"San Francisco, United States",402,271,32,4.0,18/7/2010,"Ive only been to The Cheesecake Factory a couple times. Both times I had a good experience. Their cheesecake is REALLY good. (Sorry I forgot which one exactly I ordered, but it is ""The Cheesecake Factory"" so yes you got to try a cheesecake from them! ha!) but as of my meal I just settled for one of their burgers. It was ok. Nothing to amazingly special about it. Just a good burger that was REALLY EXPENSIVE.  This place was also hard to find and it was hard to get a table. Had to wait like 20 min or so for lunch. Well yea this place is a tourist attraction so I wasnt mad or anything. Just surprised that you had to wait for lunch. Overall a good restaurant."
Jessica R.,"San Francisco, United States",105,371,269,4.0,18/7/2010,"One of my favorite restaurants.. Sorry if it sounds like a story rather than a review.. I took it from something I wrote a long time ago with a few edits. Three and a half years ago, my boyfriend asked to take me for an early birthday dinner. We went to Cheesecake Factory that resided on the top floor of Macy*s, where the outside terrace overlooked San Francisco's Union Square, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany & Co, Levi's, Niketown, etc. We waited to get seated and for dinner I got fettuccine alfredo (never again) but I can't quite remember what my boyfriend got. We ate dinner, and I was too full to eat a cheesecake but our waitress told me that we could not leave Cheesecake Factory without getting a cheesecake so I ordered one anyway. While we waited for our cheesecakes, my boyfriend asked, ""Are we getting anywhere?"" And I answered with a yes. Afterwards, he let me know that he was going to use the restroom to be polite, and came back in thirty seconds. I did not think much of it, I thought to myself, ""He is a guy, what do you expect?"" Finally, our cheesecakes came out. Mine had the words, ""will you be my girlfriend?"" around the cheesecake. I was totally dumbfounded because our waitress ended up giving me his [strawberry] cheesecake while he had mine [oreo cheesecake], and initially I read it too fast that I thought it had said ""happy birthday girlfriend?"" I was like, ""happy birthday girlfriend? I think she gave us the wrong cheesecakes."" ""Read it again."" my boyfriend said.  I can't believe that was three and a half years ago, already. We still come here when we have the chance, it's nice to eat outside during a nice day with a bit of a breeze. If you're only coming here for the cheesecake, you HAVE to try the Godiva cheesecake, it's to DIE for! Especially if you love chocolate! So yummy. One thing you must know, the wait is extremely long but once you've waited for a good 30 minutes to an hour for seats, you'd be hungry by the time so come full with food already in your system because the wait will make you HUNGRY. Or you can come with an empty stomach and starve yourself for the next half hour or so before getting seated. After this review, I think I want to visit soon for that Godiva cheesecake, nomz!"
Breniel L.,"San Francisco, United States",177,116,122,4.0,17/7/2010,"I like coming here. It's great, but I HATE the wait. It's such a pain. They don't take reservations or anything. The service is pretty good, most of the waiters I've had are pretty nice. I don't like how the beepers have a small radius...I really wish that I could go shopping while waiting.  I've gotten a variety of things here. I like the jambalaya and the pasta they have here. I barely ever finish everything that I have here. I really like the mango smoothie thing they have. I always get that and the firecracker salmon thing. I wished I liked cheesecake as much as the rest of the world does though."
Janice V.,"San Francisco, United States",369,600,798,4.0,11/7/2010,"My boyfriend and I love coming here since it is one of our favorite restaurants in the city. I love sitting outside on a sunny day and seeing the view of Union Square which i think is pretty romantic. I think it would be better if it was at night. I usually get an appetizer and a main course but by the time I get my main course I'm already full by their appetizers. It's weird because it takes a lot for me to be full but the Cheesecake Factory already fills me up with their appetizers. It's better if you come here with an empty stomach. I usually get their pastas because I love Italian and it's pretty yummy. My favorite food out of their whole menu is the cheesecake, duh! Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake to be exact. It's seriously to die for. If you love Red Velvet you must get this.  Btw, if you're gonna eat outside please don't be scared of the birds. Every time I sit outside, there's always people that are frighten of them and tend to look around to see if birds are gonna come at them. It's pretty funny looking at them being all cautious. Haha. Those birds only come at empty tables where they can eat the leftovers."
Dina D.,"Moorpark, United States",5,8,,4.0,7/7/2010,"So amazing!  My husband and I love coming here when we visit San Francisco.  The view over Union Station is lovely...so romantic to sit outside, have a cocktail and share a dessert...perfection!"
Jay C.,"Oakland, United States",55,191,173,4.0,15/6/2010,"Snickers Cheesecake! GRR! I want some...now! Overall, worth the 800 calories!   ;)"
Joe V.,"Boston, United States",182,137,3,4.0,10/6/2010,"I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory when I lived back east in Boston with my friend Kris, and other friends as well and out here in S.F. and another location in Palo Alto. The food is a bit pricey, but you get definitely get what you pay for as the portions are HUGE and I HIGHLY recommend getting the Red Velvet cheesecake for dessert. It is orgasmic to eat but not kind on your waistline. Last time we went was in SF on Geary Street in the Macy's Mall and the place was packed, but service was fast and exceptional, and our server was no nonsense. She earned her tip from us and I'd gladly want her to take care of us again. For starters we had the crab wontons, then partner had a turkey mushroom and onion burger, while I the crusty parmesan sandwich which were huge and I barely could finish it all. Overall, this place and food are really good. If you're hungry and have mean appetite, I recommend!"
Will B.,"San Jose, United States",21,125,2,4.0,27/5/2010,"Had dinner here on 5/22 around 8:00PM with my wife and adult grand-daughter.  We had over an hour's wait, but it WAS Saturday night and in the midst of the prom season, so no complaint here. I had the Steak Diane - excellent, my wife had her favorite - and messy - Thai Wrap and Britt had a chicken/pasta dish.  All of the meals were very, very good and the service even better.  Our waitperson Olivia was attentive and took care of all of our dining needs.  It's not an easy place to get to - but the Union Square Garage across the street is available with easy entrance/exit.   Would definitely recommend this location."
Pauline L.,"Kirkland, United States",447,194,1831,4.0,23/5/2010,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory in SoCal before, and it's always pretty good. Your typical, hang-out-with-friends, big portions, lively restaurant. Good tasting each time This review is about two dishes at this SF location. ATMOSPHERE: same decor as every other, but it's always nice. Very decorated. Loud loud loud. Busy and you gotta wait usually for a table, but it wasn't too long a wait. Patio seating is pretty cool, overlooking SF fromt he 7th floor of Macys. SERVICE: typical of big chains. Nothing fancy. Older teenagers working as efficiently and quickly as they can. Quick, good American service. FOOD: I am in love with their brown bread. I still don't know if it's just whole wheat bread or something else (definitely not pumpernickel or rye), but it's just so delicious! Slight sweetness. We went on a Sunday, so they were still serving brunch at 1pm. *Monte Cristo: mannnn. Having a bite of my friend's Monte Cristo has made me crave these savory french toast sandwiches ALL THE TIME now. I want one right now, and tomorrow, and the day after. It was hug eand was served with potatoes. Thick bread that's duly soaked up the egg-milk sugar mixture before being fried with ham and cheese sandwiched between, then dusted on top with powdered sugar and served with jam. Sooo good and I wished I ordered one myself. But definitely enough for two meals, unless you want to eat your daily calories in one sitting. ( ) *Some Shrimp spaghetti special: This was one of their specials for April 2010. It was all right. Light sauce, battered shrimp, peas. Not something I'd get again, but not necessarily bad either.  ( ) Price is what it typically is: chain restaurant prices of $10-25 per person. Decent, but you can't beat the prices around Berkeley. (See my review on Pasta Bene)"
Kathy V.,"Hercules, United States",865,677,3033,4.0,21/5/2010,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory? I do!!! I'm always down to go to Cheesecake Factory, I just have a hard time deciding what to order. I usually get the same things but have tried a lot on their menu. There was one year some friends of mine made a pack that we would come every two weeks and order something different, well that didn't last long because it was costing us $$$ and we always craved for our favorites!!!  Oh BTW, they added a kids menu @ Cheesecake factory!! (finally)  and an individual small menu with smaller portions!  Here are some of my faves: Appetizers- Avocado Egg rolls- 5 stars!  Fried Calamari-4 stars  Thai lettuce wraps- 3 stars  Spicy Ahi Tempura roll- 4 stars  Chicken pot stickers -3 stars  Road-slide sliders- 4 stars  Cobb Salad- 4 stars  Main Course food:  Shrimp Bistro Pasta -5 stars  Grilled Shrimp & Bacon club-5 stars  BBQ Salmon - 5 stars  Beef Ribs- 5 stars  Chicken Madeira- 5 stars  Chicken Marsala -5 stars  My favorite Cheesecakes are: Tuxedo & Red velvet  I must sound like a pig!! oh get this too, did you know by law in California at every restaurant has to have a Calorie Count Menu? I happened to see it @ Cheesecake factory and was turned off!!! Can you believe a slice of red velvet cake is a whomping 1,500 calories? ughhhhhh"
Corey Tess T.,"Anaheim, United States",752,647,636,4.0,10/5/2010,"You know when I think of this chain I am really uninspired, but they do have a HUGE menu. The chain itself is a great place to take a large group - or even a small group of people who all want something different. They have Mexican, Chinese, Salads, Roast Beef, you name it, they have something you want.. Now THIS particular Cheesecake is located at the top of the Macy's bldg and sports an awesome view! When in San Fran, I would usually never do a chain, but the view here really makes a difference, so wait for it! Good Mojitos!"
Joanna P.,"Champaign, United States",9,16,20,4.0,1/5/2010,"Really? 3 stars only. I think its better than that... I came to SF in the middle of the summer and going to a place like this, I would expect so many people. And when me and my bf came here there were lots of people. As soon as we approached the desk to have our seats, the lady told us the expected time frame would be about 30-45 minutes if we choose to stay outside overlooking the beautiful union square. To my surprise we were called right away, say maybe 20 minutes or less. Again.. in middle of the summer with jammed packed people. No reservations either. The complimentary bread was good. We got chicken marsala and mushrooms and bang bang chicken & shrimp. The marsala was good...I've tasted better marsala before though but this isn't that bad. What I really like is the Bang-bang chicken & shrimp. If you like curry flavor stuff, this is for you. Chicken was tender (for both) and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, we didn't get any dessert because we were soo full. I would love to come back here again. You can't beat the view!"
Meg W.,"East Bay, United States",266,885,371,4.0,26/4/2010,"When the clock strikes 6p at my office, and you're a staff member who's boss has tagged you as somebody who might miss the last bart train out for the want of trial exhibits, you get a magical email from the mysterious ""Mercy"" (makes sense her name is Mercy, really) saying something akin to *here's tonight's menu, your limit is $25, enjoy.* One night this week it was TCF.  After considering the *Weight Management* section of the menu, I threw caution to the wind and went with the spicy cashew chicken plus a side of steamed veg: $17.50 and $4.50 respectively.  ($17.50 for cashew chicken??? seems a bit, umm, pricey. If I was paying anyway.) All us chosen staffers got another email a bit later ""Come pick up your order on 19!"" Awesome. I could get used to this. Oh, hell, I already am.  The cashew chicken dish was huge. No, enormous. And damn good. More chicken than rice, really? Seriously.   I added more of my personal office-pantry chili paste, but it was spicy enough in it's own right for the average bear. The veg I got were completely forgettable, I couldn't tell you which were included. Skip those.  So, no I didn't have the signature cheesecake, or from what I hear, the signature long wait for a table, but I loved my spicy cashew chicken. Not sure it's worth missing the last train out, but still..."
Aphrodite L.,"San Francisco, United States",98,48,19,4.0,21/4/2010,"I went there on Tuesday night with my bf Most of the food we ordered was from the small menu: tuna tartare, fries, chicken, tuna salad. Everything was very good. My bf had a mojito and it was perfect for me but it was too sweet for him.. I had a strawberry martini, which I liked, but I have to admit that it was very sweet and very syrupy. I ended up asking the server for some lemon and some water to add to the drink... Service was very good, friendly and attentive."
Nadine M.,"Culver City, United States",64,89,15,4.0,3/4/2010,"not great service, but you CANNOT BEAT THE VIEW from the outside roof dining. We went for dessert only (we have cheesecake factory's where we're from and they do choose great locations -- the marina del rey and redondo beach ones come to mind -- and know the food is fine, if rich. We went on a cold nearly drizzly night during Spring Break and couldn't have been more thrilled to be there. Since we agreed to sit outside (they could use a few more heaters, btw) we got seated immediately and avoided the 1-hour plus wait.  With that view, how could you want to be anywhere else?  Terrific view, bring $$, a patient attitude for the sorta surly staff and consider the unbelievable white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake."
T L.,"San Francisco, United States",761,1357,5244,4.0,29/3/2010,"(See pics) More of 3.7 stars. So I have been here many times and always like to joke about the CCF elevator where each floor it shows a picture of the dishes. Instead of the pictures, they should have 700 calories, 1000, 1200, etc. until they hit the top floor and say bingo, 2000 calories!! Anyway, a group of us finally hit here for late night cheesecake desserts, my first time here to have cheesecake! I had the Tiramisu cheesecake because I love everything Italian, or at least resemble Italian. It turned out to be really good. I had the more bubbles than syrup coke, perfect chaser to the sugar. I tried a few bites from my friends' dishes and they were overall good, with loads of whipped cream like they own a whipped cream factory.. This neighborhood really needs more dessert places that open late, maybe an Asian one, than just bars. The forever wait is what keeps it from getting more than 4 stars."
Lorenzo A.,"Pembroke Pines, United States",104,67,39,4.0,25/3/2010,You get so much food for what you pay for! The view on top of MACY's overlooking Union Square at night is gorgeous. I always visit this Cheesecake Factory every time I visit SF. I highly recommend the fried macaroni & cheese balls. It's AMAZINGGGGGGG.
David W.,"Rochester, United States",1,163,140,4.0,25/3/2010,"This joint meant disaster for my diet. Whatever, it was soooo good. (well, the cheesecake, at least). The wait was a little longer than I would have liked, but I spent my time on the heated patio looking over Union Square. Somehow they were out of their tap beers (how does that happen?) but I guess people don't come there for the beer. It's all about the cheesecake! I got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. Oh my word. At first, when I was served my piece, I was disappointed by the portion (I paid $7 for THIS!?) but trust me, this stuff fills you up. You'll be forcing the last fork-full down. But it's soooo good; incredibly rich and yummy in ways I can't describe! You'll pay for it, of course: one slice has half of your daily caloric intake. But if you can get over that and put in a little more work at the gym to make up for it, you'll be so glad you came here."
Bibby L.,"Alameda, United States",44,150,,4.0,22/3/2010,"Amazing seafood and martinis. Huge servings of delicious cheesecake, of course. Service was a little slow, but they were absolutely swamped, so that makes sense. It's nice that it's above Macy's so you can look around while you wait for your table if there's a long wait."
Deborah C.,"San Francisco, United States",181,173,282,4.0,18/3/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has wonderful cocktails and appetizers/snacks!!! After spending hours at school doing projects, my friends and I stopped by around 10:30P.M on a weekday knowing we need some good food and a nice drink. As we get off the elevator, hosts were very welcoming and notified us immediately that we can take our time eating/drinking even though they close at 11P.M. (Side Note:  Enter restaurant before closing time) (1 star...DING!)  We found seats at the bar area.  We settled ourselves on the high chairs and a tall strapping male waiter comes by to check on us. He asked what we wanted to drink and we told him we need a few minutes.  He understood and ventured off to get us water and complimentary bread. Yums!  (2 stars...DING!) He returns and asked us very friendly on what we wanted. Here are the wonderful goodies we ordered from the menu!  Cocktails  1)  Pineapple Mojito 2) Passion Fruit Mojito 3) Tropical Martini  Small plates & Snacks/Appetizer 1)  Margherita Pizza 2) Chicken Samosas 3) Avocado Eggrolls   The best part was that all the food and drinks came came out in less than 15 minutes!  Awesome!  (3 stars...DING!) After an hour of gulping and grubbing, we left with happy stomachs. We wanted more, but controlled ourselves. =P Overall, this was a very satisfying experience at Cheesecake Factory.  (4 stars...DING!) We are coming back here again! :D"
