Mr. E.,"Redwood City, United States",3,20,10,4.0,11/3/2010,"I just love this place....I like the food it fills me up...what do you expect for under $20....think about this..they have so much overhead, if they are going to be in the bay area they have to charge that much just to survive,,,great place for everyone GO Cheesecake Factory!!!!!"
Kay R.,"Santa Monica, United States",128,179,54,4.0,2/3/2010,"I think this Cheesecake Factory is great.  I love the atmosphere, I love the location... definitely a nice spot to go to for a nice lunch or dinner celebration.  The wait can sometimes be a pain in the a** but it's worth it. Just came here again for a friend's birthday.  We were here for lunch and waited 10 mins for a table (if even that).  My friend and I shared a pizza (the one with artichoke) and the ceasar salad.  Soooo much food!!  It was enough for three people.  The salad was exactly how I liked it but the pizza was a bit off.  Even though it was good, the way they made it was super weird.  It's like instead of taking all the toppings and spreading them throughout the pizza, they took each one and sectioned it!  So there was an artichoke section, a bacon section, and a mushroom section!!  So freakin weird!!  Who does that?!? The cheesecakes were of course to die for delicious but I've never had a complaint on that. The only other thing that was blah was the service.  Our waitress was so blah and had a bit of a 'tude if you know what I mean.  At first we only wanted two plates for the salad but then our friend changed her mind and wanted to share too.  So when we asked her for another plate she said ""That's why I asked you earlier... well let me welcome these other people FIRST"" all frustrated with us or something.  Geeez!  Hello, isn't that your job?  To fill our glasses and make sure we have what we need??  I could go get the plate myself if you want to tip me.  Honestly, I'm not one of those jerky people that are like bossy and rude to servers but come on now, we just wanted an extra side plate.  I mean damn good thing I didn't ask for an extra napkin! Honestly because of that I would have given my experience a 3.5 but since I just love this place and would always want to go back... I couldn't just b/c of some snooty waitress."
Jillian O.,"Napa, United States",14,191,375,4.0,27/2/2010,"Be prepared to wait a long time for a table, especially on weekends. I love the chicken madeira and the Oreo cheesecake!"
Cloclo R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,4.0,23/2/2010,"With my friends, we tried The Cheesecake Factory on Thursday evenig at Macy's. There were about 15 of us and we didn't make a reservation. Some people were waiting to have dinner, but quickly we were seated to have dinner. Servers were nice and efficient. Dishes were huge and everybody enjoyed them. I ate an omelett ; some people ate pasta and some people ate pizza. But the best was the dessert. I ordered an original cheesecake because it's my favorite and it was delicious. Unfortunately, I wasn't hungry anymore  so I just ate two mouthfuls of my cheesecake. In conclusion I recommend this restaurant especially to taste their Cheesecake."
Cynthia W.,"San Francisco, United States",304,269,150,4.0,22/2/2010,"I like their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Sausage and Broccolini Pasta, and Fish and Chips. For appetizers, the Avocado Eggrolls and Fried Macaroni and Cheese are good too. But most recently, I had a Shrimp and Sausage pasta off their specials menu and it wasn't very good at all. I really like the interior and the heat lamps on the patio, but the wait (even for the elevator to get up there) can take a while (2 hours during weekend peak dinner time). A lot of the cheesecakes are too sweet for my taste, but then again, I'm the type of person who can only eat a few pieces of chocolate at once. So I usually look for cheesecakes with a sour counterpart (i.e. lime).  Being able to buy affordable food at a restaurant with a view like this one (overseeing Union Square from the top of Macy's) is pretty awesome."
Kat C.,"San Francisco, United States",773,630,2420,4.0,22/2/2010,"Cheesecake = heart stoppers (literally) Each cheesecake has all-time-high calories in each slice but it's so devilishly good... I'd been craving cheesecake for several months but denied myself the pleasure.  Until one day... White chocolate raspberry cheesecake mesmerized me through the cold display glass until I nearly lost it and jumped over the counter.  I got a 6"" ($20 something?  I know, super expensive... by the slice they range from $6+) all to myself and the guy asked how many ppl it was for. Me: Oh, it's just for me *smile* Guy: Oh.... uh.... that should be plenty... it's good for about 4-5 days in the fridge... Me: No, it'll be long gone before then. Guy: heh... .... oh It was gone in 2 days.  It's a nice treat once or twice a year... *again, the calories are insane... but so good :("
Verena S.,"Las Vegas, United States",69,22,,4.0,22/2/2010,"I'm in love with this place for its vibe and their cakes! I'm not a fan for their food...Like the typical chain restaurant, Cheesecake Factory has the standard-just ok food (not bad, but not great).  However, when it comes to their cheesecakes, I'm definitely a huge fan!! They're all so delicious. My favorite so far is the Red Velvet Cheesecake (I'm in love with this cake)! Further, the location above Macy's in Union Square is really cool. I think this location is a great place for a first date (if he/she is not a severe food critic). It's on the top of the building, has an amazing patio with great view, nicely heated, and you can also enjoy the sky/stars/moon/whatever. :)"
Michelle Y.,"Daly City, United States",32,184,,4.0,21/2/2010,I've been here oodles of times...They have a fabulous variety of dishes to choose from. Recommendations would be Luau Salad (my absolute favorite)...Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp...Crab Cake Sandwich...and DO NOT forget about the cheesecake...Godiva...Mmmmm.... Reasonable prices too and huge proportions!
Grace R.,"Cerritos, United States",45,62,,4.0,14/2/2010,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. If I don't know where to go for dinner, I always say ""Let's go to the Cheescake Factory"". I was a fan ever since college. Here's what I always order: Start with avocado egg rolls followed by some pasta dish (varies) and top off my meal with the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Yum! I wish I can eat this everyday, too bad it's always crowded and at least 1-2 hour wait depending on the time and day. That's why I give it 4 stars out of 5. I hate waiting for so long, but the food is always worth it. I guess that's why I'm always coming back."
Ron Z.,"Daly City, United States",159,206,932,4.0,5/2/2010,"If you're really hungry and want something filling, and you want to eat in nice, clean surroundings, you should check this place out. It's in the MACY's building in Union Square, and the views from the window seats are gorgeous. The food is you're standard American selection. Lots of baked and fried goods, salads, and burgers. The only standouts for me were the Orange Chicken, and the Caramel Chicken. These are the only things I order now when I eat here. And the cheesecake is still the best I've ever had (no matter what flavor you get). Still a bit pricey for me, but always fun."
Steph L.,"Daly City, United States",80,185,134,4.0,4/2/2010,"I wish this place wasn't so popular because then it would be less crowded and I wouldn't have to wait five years for a table.  The drinks are good and the service is always very friendly.  The food is nothing special, but gets the job done.  I am not a huge cheesecake fan, but the snickers cheesecake is gods gift to man-kind! I refuse to try anything else.  The main reason I gave this place four stars is because they have consistently great customer service!"
Sheila W.,"San Francisco, United States",73,30,26,4.0,1/2/2010,"I try to avoid chains esp. in San Francisco but there are some exceptions, like In&Out (on the road), Osha Thai, Pete's, etc.  The Cheesecake Factory has one particular dish that I am mad for which is the Miso Salmon.  It is delicious!  Their portions are def. American, and most likely there will be left overs to savor later.   The fourth star is really because the best part of this restaurant is the outdoor patio (with heat lamps) at roof top of Macy's overlooking Union Square - perfect for sipping cocktails.  My mom did point out the feeding pigeons on the tables left vacant, and that she didn't think it was very sanitary but this doesn't bother me since I'm not gonna eat directly off the table."
Monica M.,"Sacramento, United States",180,213,38,4.0,1/2/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top of Macy's in Union Square. We were seated on the patio Friday afternoon though there where clouds overhead, but the heat lamps kept us comfortable. What you can't help but notice are the pigeons walking around like they own the place. As soon as someone left the table to leave, the pigeons where all over it.  Where else can you see pigeons fight over a piece of leftover cheesecake?  The whip cream was flying!  Of course, with every Cheesecake Factory restaurant come the huge portion sizes.  I ended up with a side salad and lunch sized pasta dish.  Let's just say, that the pasta fed me for 2+ days after.    It did start to sprinkle right after we finished our salads and we went inside and were quickly seated before the heavens opened and it started to pour. The service was great and attentive though I was bummed I had to pass on their Blackout cake."
Jenny A.,"San Francisco, United States",4,16,,4.0,30/1/2010,"My husband and I have been going to Cheesecake Factory since we first started dating and it has not yet disappointed. Their cheesecakes are of course the best, but their pasta dishes are my favorite. I'm not a big fan of their meat dishes since I can go elsewhere for larger, juicier portions and not pay as much."
Po L.,"San Francisco, United States",144,627,1,4.0,27/1/2010,"If you have a large group with many different taste this place will be able to satisfy.  One thing good about The Cheesecake Factory is that they are very consistent on quality and taste.  The environment is clean with average service.  The portions are huge and will afford you another meal if you take it to go.  Avocado egg rolls are delicious and a must and of course, cheesecake to finish the meal.."
Shirley W.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, United States",312,92,4,4.0,16/1/2010,"Every Cheesecake Factory I've been to from LA to SF has never let me down in terms of ambiance and decor.   Our server was really attentive on a Friday night at 11pm, near closing time.  He ensured our cups were filled with water and wasn't offended that we ordered 4 cheesecakes and several drinks for 9 people. Their current special: Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake and their Velvet Cheesecake (which my friend says they run out pretty frequently)."
April Z.,"San Francisco, United States",17,74,5,4.0,15/1/2010,"I guess I can understand the 3 star average rating. It's a chain restaurant...it's known for the actual cheesecakes and not the  food...service is mediocre...there's long waits for popular meal times...etc. But I've actually always been a fan of this venue. The food is pretty darn decent for a price like theirs, and there's a LARGE variety! Anything from salads, to pasta, to salmon, to steak, to burgers - anything anyone in your party might want to eat. Sure that sounds a bit all over the place... but it's a chain restaurant meant to accommodate many people at a time! There's low-calorie meals, many different kinds of drinks (which also taste pretty good! just kind of expensive...$10 for a sangria??), andddd dessert that's not cheesecake. I only get their tiramisu for dessrt (not the tiramisu cheesecake) and the serving is big and yummy.  I always try to get my friends to come with me when we're looking for a place to eat lunch around downtown, but I rarely succeed. :("
Carolyn D.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,8,,4.0,31/12/2009,"Beautiful location, but that comes with a price. We had a wait time of 90 minutes, which was OK for us because we wanted to do some shopping. We started with Calamari and Onion Rings, both delicious. The dinner portions are ENORMOUS! I shared the Crispy Chicken Carboletta, which was perfecto. Other members of our party got the BBQ Salmon, which was OK, and the Jambalaya, also OK.  However, while one member of the party was eating the shrimp angel hair pasta, they came across a piece of RAW CHICKEN! Gross! We know it was an accident, but it was still pretty nasty. The management was very nice, and took the dish off the bill in addition to giving us two pieces of cheesecake. They seemed very sincere. Overall a good experience, with courteous waiting staff and management."
Amanda W.,"Naples, United States",724,123,25,4.0,28/12/2009,"food good. wait long time for table. drinks good at bar. BUT  after a day of tire kicking in the best shops in town,  reward yourself with a view that cant be topped in the infamous city of S.F. and a drink to quench the thirst of a weary shopper  Priceless."
Betty T.,"Torrance, United States",68,211,75,4.0,24/12/2009,"i've committed a crime.  i've tried 2 other cheesecake factories in two other locations before trying the one in my hometown of san francisco. please, please forgive this naiive and innocent creature typing this idiotic apology.  so. cheesecake factory. it's average. it's not too special, i'm afraid, and it's not that different from the other ones. the food was delectable as always, the service was good as always, etc.  the single thing that sets this apart from the other ones is the UNGODLY AMOUNT OF TEENAGE COUPLES FROLICKIN-- just kidding. really, the one thing that sets this place apart is the fact that you're on top of macys in the middle of downtown. if you eat outside, there are spectacular views and it makes the dining experience romantic."
