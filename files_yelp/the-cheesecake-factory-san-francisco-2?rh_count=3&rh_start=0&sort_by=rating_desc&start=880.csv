Nikhil B.,"San Jose, United States",33,118,4,4.0,23/12/2009,"Location! Location! Location!  That's what sets this restaurant apart from all the other cheesecake factory spots. Tucked away on the 8th floor of the Macy's in Union Square, this location allows great views of union square from behind the giant MACY'S lettering. You can eat either outside or indoors, the tables outside have adjacent heaters to keep the patrons warms.  We came here while the tree was up and there was an ice-skating rink set up next to the tree. This was a particularly clear night as well so our view was absolutely breathtaking. We were told that the wait was going to be 1hr45, but our table was ready in just a little under an hour. No complains there as you can just take the pager and lounge in the furniture and couches section just one floor below.  We just had the cheesecake on this particular night which was as awesome as ever. As for the food, based on experiences at other locations, one should expect very large portions.  To sum up, great location! Same ol' cheesecake food and service."
Rebecca S.,"San Francisco, United States",276,372,26,4.0,22/12/2009,"'Cheesy Cheesecake' is a tourist spot, but it's a great place to come after a date to get a drink, something sweet, and to check out one of the best views along Union Square until late. Get your drink at the bar and take it out to the patio. The view is worth sticking it out in the cold. GOTTA TRY my *fav* dessert: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake!! If you are a coconut fan, this is a *must*. It's got layers of chocolate cake, brownie, coconut & pecan frosting, with** the best** part: a huge layer of creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake right in the middle. Insane!!!"
Joseph S.,"Burlingame, United States",0,87,7,4.0,10/12/2009,"Great place to bring out of towners.  Park across the street in the underground parking beneath union square, go to the eighth floor to put your names in at the cheesecake factory, shop for an hour in Macy's or around Union Square, and get a table with a view overlooking the city.  The patio can be chilly, so make sure to bring your coats.  But the experience is great if you have tourist guests."
Angela N.,"Oakland, United States",297,187,31,4.0,8/12/2009,"I rolled through here last night instead of waiting in line at the Yelp Unwrapped party.  We got there and were told it would be a 35 minute wait.  Not too shabby considering how full the streets were with holiday shoppers. My girl and I cozied up to the bar for drink while we waited.  We quickly downed our first round to chase away the chill the 45 minutes we'd been waiting in line had already instilled in our limbs.  I had just ordered my second mojito when our pager went off...23 minutes. Awesome. The service was prompt and she could tell we weren't there to mingle for too long.  We placed our orders and had our food in about 15 minutes.  The food itself is decent...better than most chain-style restaurants.  I had the Shepards pie and really enjoyed it.  Perfect comfort food for the chilly evening.  My friend had the chicken and biscuits...and although she said it was good...it wasn't something she'd likely order again...too heavy and creamy. We topped off our meal by sharing a piece of peanut butter fudge cheescake.  It was ok.  Very rich and very sweet.  I had a few bites, but really, when it comes to cheesecake, I'm a minimalist.  I like it plain and MAYBE some strawberries or blueberries on top. We were out the door and headed back to the Westin for Yelp unwrapped in an hour. All in all, the view is spectacular and you can't beat the location.  That's really the best reason anyone would eat there anyway, right? =)"
Christine T.,"San Jose, United States",656,197,89,4.0,6/12/2009,"Slippery floors, cramped elevators, and second hand smoke.. this is what a typical dining experience in San Francisco should consist of! A 20 minute wait for a over crowded pasta place you surely can have at any ol' busy city. But what makes this one so special is the amazing view and their amazing service. Not to mention their amazing food that seems to always be exactly perfect. I don't know how to exactly describe an experience here since each time coming here is quite different and adventure. But if you're one for a great view of Union Square or even shopping till your feet go numb from the SF weather, this Cheese Cake Factory is open latteeeee. Just perfect for a nice relaxing sit down dinner before the long trip home (if you're a tourist)."
Keane L.,"San Francisco, United States",1007,1106,216,4.0,1/12/2009,"I saw obesity in action in the form of a double cheeseburger and a plate full of curly fries. I couldn't stop looking. It was like a lava lamp.  I'll admit it. I still love this place for what it is, especially during the holiday madness. Homogeneous chain atmosphere. Long ass wait. Sociological experiment... Once you've come to grips with that, you can enjoy their decent food and consistently good service. Just be sure to substitute out the fries and mayo from your sandwich if you plan on not exploding anytime soon."
Truc N.,"San Jose, United States",334,200,45,4.0,24/11/2009,"I used to love going to eat here every time we go shopping in the City.  We don't go as much anymore because we're broke!  =D   I love the calamari here!  It's crispy and tender and the best part is the garlic tartare sauce!  Delish!  I also love the thai lettuce wraps!  It's so fresh, so good, so tasty!!  Their crispy taquitos are always a treat!  One of my other favorite appetizers is the sweet tamale cakes!  Soooo good!  I've never had anything like it anywhere else!  Whenever my boyfriend and I would go eat here, we would always order a bunch of stuff!  That's because everything sounds so good and I can never decide on just one thing to eat!  If you want to sample their goodies, get the factory sampler!!  All the good stuff is included in that sampler!  Yummy!!  I've tried a handful of their cheesecakes and I like the dulce de leches cheesecake and the tres leches cheesecake.  One of my favorite places to eat at!!!  They are always crazy busy here so there's bound to be a wait!  Be patient, go shopping, go outside check out union square, come back and your table should be ready!"
Peter L.,"San Francisco, United States",3149,905,2630,4.0,24/11/2009,"The salmon ""egg roll"" is something I get each time, even though it's fusiony. The ribs too unless someone else orders it (then I'll just mooch off of them, lol), then I'd get the filet mignon. Other items like the pizzas, pasta dishes, even other steaks, are similar to elsewhere. Can't go wrong getting any of those, but they're not memorable either.  Portions seemed smaller than they used to be but were still plentiful. For desserts: strawberry cheesecake, white choc w/caramel macadamia cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, 30th Anniversary choc w/fudge cheesecake. Bliss. Great place to take out-of-towners to ""eat well"" and for them to still feel comfortable with the surroundings. Located on the 8th floor of the Women's Macy's (entrance on the Geary St side)."
Jenny T.,"San Francisco, United States",257,248,24,4.0,23/11/2009,"Pretty restaurant. We sat outside and enjoyed the view while we ate. It was a cold, windy night and the heat lamps didn't help much. Anyway I ordered the jambalaya that comes with noodles. It was so delicious! MMMM! :) The hostess was really nice, had a chat with her about makeup cuz she liked mine. The waitress was a bit slow and not too smiley but other than that, everything was perfect."
Kimberly Y.,"San Francisco, United States",225,23,89,4.0,18/11/2009,Atmosphere: i love it. it has a nice feel too it. it looks pretty too. if you go there i recommend asking for a booth because those are very comfy. Food: The breadsticks are amazing nice and warm and toasty. The food is okay i would get the pasta or salad if i were you. The cheesecake is amazing. So many flavors to choose from. If you want to eat the cheesecake i recommend sharing a main course with someone because the portions are giant. or take it home.
Melanie S.,"Livermore, United States",44,15,4,4.0,14/11/2009,"I love the cheesecake factory!! I have eaten at their other chain restaurants and I'm just now making a review.  I've tried almost all their dishes, but my favorite is the lettuce wrap and the orange glazed chicken. Also, you cant go wrong with the free bread appetiser especially the brown one. The portions are also huge (lunch or dinner) I always have to bring home a doggy bag every time i leave. Thus, I always have my cheese cake to go because i don't have enough room in my tummy. ;-( My favorite cheese cake is the tuxedo and recently they just added the red velvet cheese cake....oh yum!!!  The service is great they are always very attentive, at times you may get those sluggish server, but hey....If they want those tips they got to milk it. Oh by the way, you always seem to wait for at least 30-45mins to be seated. But well worth it!  I know that my family and i will always come back again."
Ryan R.,"San Francisco, United States",50,46,26,4.0,11/11/2009,"I have eaten here (lunch and dinner) many many times, but only had the time to review it now! Well, my internet is going to cut off in a couple of days. My cell phone cut off last week.... Because I'm moving to Japan, among the 27 countries I will be in for the next year. So what have I been doing? Eating at all the places that I won't find outside of th United States!! The cheesecake just isn't the same anywhere else. If I don't get my oreo cheesecake at least once a year It just doesn't feel right. And so what am I going to do right before I go? You guessed it! I docked 'em a star because sometimes they kick me out of the terrace area for taking too many pictures. I'm not in anyone's way! =P I don't want to get fat either, but you can't eat your fat and not have it."
Richard C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,84,,4.0,28/10/2009,"I've been here a good amount of times and I've never been disappointed. Now, I know, a lot of people complain about the wait and it is a tad bit ridiculous since it is usually 40+ minutes but then again, I can't fault them for having good business. The two things I do remember getting here is the angel hair pasta with shrimp and the jambalaya pasta, both were very good. The jambalaya pasta had the shrimp overcooked though but I'm assuming they cook it with the chicken so I can let it slide, besides, the pasta is done perfectly and I could have just eaten that and nothing else. My boyfriend got the steak and chicken combo and he liked his chicken but he felt his steak was a bit overcooked at some parts. We ended the meal with cheesecake (who didn't see that one coming?). He got the 30th anniversary cheesecake which is essentially mousse, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and whatever else layered onto it, it was a bit too rich for my taste. I went with the dutch apple caramel struesel and it was very good, I had no complaints about it except I was already so overstuffed with my pasta that I couldn't finish it (makes me want to cry a little now because it was so good). It's not some place that I can afford to come to everyday but every now and then isn't so bad. The wait is just terrible though so just try to keep that in mind when you come here."
Jen S.,"San Francisco, United States",6,55,,4.0,10/10/2009,"I think that the cheesecake factory is moderately priced and a great place to bring your friends and impress them on a nice day in the city. I have been here twice, once with my friends Melissa (after shopping on a holiday Monday, it was mayhem!), and once with my Boyfriend. Sitting out on the patio on a gorgeous mid week day for lunch is a fucking solid deal. I must admit, their regular menu is more than I would pay for a chain restaurant dinner, but their lunch menu is right on track! I remember being pleasantly surprised when the bill for two lunches and cheesecake came."
Frisco N.,"San Francisco, United States",1,15,16,4.0,2/10/2009,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory! The wait is super long! That's why I gave it a 4 Star. But the food is great and so are the drinks! Ladies, you MUST try the Georgia Peach! Aaaah! It's sooooo good! I have to have one whenever I come here. I also love the, I bealieve it's called, Thai Rice Rolls? Whatever they're called, they are AWESOME! Oh, and the Red Velvet Cheesecake is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Oh sweet Lord Baby Jesus!!! I think it's seasonal though=/ You have GOT to try it! Muy muy muy RICO=)"
T K.,"San Francisco, United States",20,62,6,4.0,21/9/2009,Reasons why I will keep coming back to this tourist trap 1. Shopping at Macy's and I'm hungry and too lazy to go anywhere else.  2. Red Velvet Cheesecake! - Their red velvet is one of the best that I have ever had. Super moist and the cheesecake just enhances the traditional version. (Basically why I rated it 4 stars - only a 2 star if they take Red velvet off their menu!) Service is spotty. Drinks are weak and yes its always too crowded.
Peter L.,"San Francisco, United States",235,42,24,4.0,18/9/2009,"the food is really good... i love the avocado rolls, that's what i always ordered here every time i came here... and i always order the fettucini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes, but i tried the other foods liked i liked it sometimes it's a pain to wait inline cause they're always so busy... and you have to park in the parking lot and it's expensive..."
Saori E.,"Los Angeles, United States",206,272,627,4.0,15/9/2009,"It's really what you'd expect of a nice chain restaurant. It's very reliable. My only complaint would be that the eggplant sandwich which I love, is slightly too greasy, especially since it comes with fries already.  I really like their Da Vinci Pasta-- here's a recipe to make it at home, actually:  Thai lettuce wraps are great, as are a lot of their tempting appetizers. Crab cakes, fish tacos, salmon, etc-- really everything I've had here has been satisfactory and above.  Great bread service, of course-- and they always listen to my ""just the brown bread please"" request :) Of course, their cheesecakes are to die for!!!!! My all-time favorite is lemon-raspberry. Sooo amazing. Tart/sweet/rich. Perfection. But please share-- unless you are only going for dessert. If you have an appetizer, an entree, and a cheesecake (not to mention the free bread), you WILL explode."
Steve L.,"San Mateo, United States",833,684,1066,4.0,8/9/2009,"I really didn't want to come here for a pre-theatre dinner, but I got out voted by my daughter and her friend, with my wife as the swing vote.  If this like the other Cheesecake Factory, I expected the waits to be longer, and especially longer at this location. Well, since it was 4:30PM on a Sunday afternoon, I figured the wait should be tolerable. We were told a half hour wait, ended up being just 20 minutes.  Instead of being seated inside, were seated out on the terrace, overlooking Union Square. It was a sunny, mild afternoon, with a clear sky, and great view of Union Square, and the people walking on the streets below. I haven't ate outdoors in a Cheesecake Factory location in a long time. The last time was sitting dockside at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach. The alfresco dining at the Union Square location was reminding me of that location.  The food itself was OK, and the portions were massive as usual. This location doesn't have a kid's menu like other locations, but they do make kid's portions of what's one their menu.  -Kid-sized Fettuccine Alfredo: This was a pretty portion for kid size. It was cheesy and creamy, but unfortunately, some of the noodles weren't completely cooked, and some pieces were hard and chalky.  -Kid-Sized Four Cheese Pasta: Penne pasta with a marinara sauce made of Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Also a pretty hefty portion for kid size.  -Luau Salad: My wife had this the last time we were at a CF in Orlando. A very visually appealing salad of lettuce, cucumbers, grilled chicken, peppers, carrots, mangoes, mac nuts, and sesame seeds, all layered with large wonton strips.  -Wasabi crusted ahi: This was pretty large slab of seared ahi, placed on a parabolic shaped bed of rice. Ahi crust was bread crumbs, made green with wasabi. I really looking for a little bite from the wasabi, but didn't taste it. Also came with side of vegetables in a miso sauce. It as more of a buttery sauce than a miso sauce, but was still good.  Of course we couldn't pass up the cheese cakes ( )  -30th Anniversary: Cheesecake layered with chocolate cake, and with chocolate chips and crispies on the frosting. Topped with chocolate ganache and lots of whipped cream  -Double Oreo Mudslide: Chocolate cheesecake with Oreos mixed in, topped with chocolate ganache and whipped cream. This was good! perfect for chocoholics.  -Key Lime: Needed something other than chocolate. Slightly tart and refreshing cheesecake with a graham cracker crust. Again with lots of whipped cream.  The downside of eating outside in the sun was that the cheesecakes softened very quickly, and started to become a floppy mess. But by then, we were already full from the cheesecake, and done eating.  No complaints on the service. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the other servers who brought out our food were very efficient.  As I said earlier, the food itself is OK, about the same consistency as the other locations, and would be a 3 star.  However, I'd bump it up another star for the perfect weather that day, which made it a happy and pleasant dining experience for us."
Sarah C.,"Sacramento, United States",270,1406,309,4.0,29/8/2009,"My parents and I came here on Thursday. They open at 11 and we probably got there around 11.15am. It wasn't busy at all. We got a nice booth that was by a window. My parents did not want to sit outside under the sun.  Our waitress spent like 2 whole minutes telling us the specials. She was really nice. We ordered two lunch specials, chicken piccata and the miso salmon. My dad ordered the meat loaf. And we got a side order of mash potatoes for my mom. I got a cup of strawberry lemonade and my parents got tea.  She came over with the box of assorted teas and my parents were able to pick. That was a plus. My strawberry lemonade was a bit sour. It would have been perfect if they added some sugar. The bread they gave was really good. We really enjoyed our food. My mom loved the miso salmon and I loved my chicken piccata. We were too full to get dessert but overall our experience was really good.  I am only giving the place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have been here for dinner and they are usually super crowded and really loud. One time, my friend and I were sitting super close to two other parties. That was not fun.  The price is pretty good for the amount of food you get."
