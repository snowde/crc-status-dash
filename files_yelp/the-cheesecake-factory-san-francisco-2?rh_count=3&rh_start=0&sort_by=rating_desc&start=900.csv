Brian L.,"Rohnert Park, United States",420,67,17,4.0,26/8/2009,"I remember coming here when I was still a tourist to the city! Needless to say, I've had some great memories here with friends...and I really appreciate its location and quality.  Overall, this place works really hard to deliver a great experience to everybody... So...Why 4 stars?  Every time I have come here, its guaranteed that you'll be waiting for a table...sometimes for over an hour!  What we usually do is make our reservation and head out to Union Square for shopping...Still, its a little frustrating that they wont accept reservations (at least last time I checked) As for prices and food quality...the food is great and the prices are just fine!  If you're visiting the city, this place is great! There's something on the menu for everybody!"
summer k.,"San Diego, United States",2,74,,4.0,24/8/2009,"Ah, The Cheesecake Factory. I really like this place. It's one of the few chain restaurants that actually has good food. The decor is nice - it's interesting, contemporary, and at the same time comfortable. But if you're at this location you really should sit outside on the balcony. You won't be giving yourself the full experience if you don't. I only sit inside if I'm with a group that's too large for the outdoor tables. Service isn't always the best; it's okay to good. It can get pretty busy, especially on summer weekends. Sorry, no reservations. In my experience, the wait can be anywhere from five minutes to over an hour. Usually it's been twenty minutes or under though. People seem to like to complain about the tourists here, but so what if there are tourists?? It's San Francisco! Union Square, no less. Get over yourself. If you really hate tourists that much then you probably shouldn't be in SF. Personally, I like coming and hearing all the different languages. People also seem to write it off because it's a chain and they're just too cool for chain restaurants. Again, get over yourself. Really, is your wait THAT long? I don't know who you're pissing off to have it drag out like that 'cause when I come, it's like fifteen minutes.  I like that their menu offers so many choices. Pretty much everything at The Cheesecake Factory comes in huge portions. It's a good value; you get one and a half meals out of one dish. I'd recommend their chicken dishes though, they probably do that the best. The chicken madeira and chicken marsala are superbly delicious. Sometimes I want to try their steak, but i know that at their portions that's a bad idea for me - I'll probably end up eating until I can't walk. I tried the small plates menu....my pizette and stuffed mushrooms were both really good. If you're looking to make a meal out of small plates, that wasn't quite enough to fill me up. A third plate probably would've done the trick (I just had some of my friend's leftovers instead). Dishes are not all that cheap considering they're small plates, $4-$7. You can get decent cheesecake at a lot of places, but theirs is indescribable. Oh so delectable, but also oh so pricey. It's seven or eight bucks a slice these days. They give you ridiculous amounts of whipped cream that you're probably not going to eat. It's good, thick, yet melt-in-your-mouth light, whipped cream. But I wouldn't mind less whipped cream and spending less cash! The cheesecake tastes like heaven, and there are a bunch of flavors to choose from...white chocolate raspberry, Oreo, chocolate coconut, brownie sundae, chocolate mousse... Good food, lots of variety, large portions, beautiful view outside, and scrumptious cheesecake."
Mark J.,"Yorba Linda, United States",4,56,10,4.0,22/8/2009,"It was chilly on the patio on Thursday night, but the atmosphere was great.  Loved the Fried Macaroni and Cheese balls."
Joon L.,"Brookline, United States",0,11,,4.0,18/8/2009,"I'd like to say as a big cheesecake factory fan, that this is the best cheesecake factory i have ever seen. They work late and hours and did i mention that view on top of the macy's department store is aboslutely gorgeous? The service is very very good and i highly recomend to go there"
ML N.,"San Francisco, United States",24,125,,4.0,7/8/2009,only in regards to these particular items: santa fe salad avocado eggrolls lemon raspberry cheesecake vanilla cheesecake. nuff said.
Shafaq C.,"San Francisco, United States",36,126,20,4.0,28/7/2009,"Who can say no to cheesecake? And the page full of flavors? Well... sometimes I do, because im already SO FULL from the entree! So yes, Cheesecake Factory is a commercial restaurant chain, but they serve pretty good food and this location in particular offers a great location and view with patio seating.  The entrees are pretty big in size and the booklet of options leads to a debate of decisions on what to eat....but I usually walk out of the Facto pretty satisfied.  My personal fav? The Bistro Shrimp Pasta. So crispy, so yummy.  And Because I'm a spice lover, i add in some crushed chili flakes that makes it even better. YUM. And so far, I haven't gone wrong with dessert.  So head over, take a seat, and enjoy the view of Union Square above Macys.. or even the busy indoor seating.  The food across Cheesecake Factories is pretty consistent and pretty satisfying :)"
Pia V.,"New York, United States",1795,884,1359,4.0,21/7/2009,"I used to come to this location a lot, and it is always quite busy.  The view from the patio is quite beautiful and worth the wait on a warm afternoon/evening. There is always a wait, so I suggest to call ahead for a reservation or be prepared for a 30+ minute wait.   I recommend the Jambalaya with pasta and the fresh strawberry cheesecake.  Their appetizers are really good too, I've never gone wrong with any of them yet.  Also, their salad portions are HUGE.  So if you order one side salad ... be prepared to share."
Paula G.,"San Francisco, United States",6,29,1,4.0,16/7/2009,"I love going to The Cheesecake Factory! I think that the portions are a good size- I mean you get what you pay for!  There always is a wait, but it's never too bad. Whenever I go here, me and my friends always eat the bread! It's really good =)    But the cheesecakes they have are amazing! I love getting the oreo one. Also, there are so many different flavors of cheesecake to choose from!"
Chris R.,"Honolulu, United States",19,1057,81,4.0,16/7/2009,I believe this is the first time I've visited The Cheese Cake Factory.  We had a great time here.  My main course salad and ice tea was delicious.  My hubby also enjoyed his burger too.  We were seated very quickly.  The wait staff asked if we want to sit outside or inside.  We choose to get a table inside because it was cold.  We were sitting facing the window looking out their balcony and union square.  This place does get crowded since it's mostly a tourist hot spot settled above Macy's Women.
Philip D.,"San Francisco, United States",22,85,,4.0,7/7/2009,"For those of you who think you are too good for a 'chain restaurant', all I have to say is lighten up!  So what if it's a chain??  The decor is fun, the energy is lively (even if you do have to wait a long time - get a drink at the bar!)  The outdoor patio is a great place to eat, relax, and watch the city.  And food is actually really tasty.  I'm a big fan of the Chipotle Chicken Pasta.  And while I normally don't get cheesecake, we had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake the last time and it was to die for.  So rich, tasted like a rich chocolate mousse. The place is lively and fun.. that's why I go there often.  Probably those who are too good for chains are no where near lively and fun in their own right."
Sarah S.,"Oakland, United States",13,108,,4.0,1/7/2009,I actually like this place.  Yes the wait is FOREVER long but at least the service is fast and the staff is nice. The food is not outstanding but it's good and the potions are big that fit their price just right. You just have to understand that any place in the city that is in Union Square is going to be super touristy and busy.  So go on a week day for an early lunch!
Elizabeth W.,"Raleigh, United States",34,147,92,4.0,1/7/2009,"San Francisco (Union Square) location only.  Must really like this place, because before we started living healthier, we took a bimonthly pilgrimage.  No reservations here, so for a no-stress experience, just be at the Macy's elevator or the top-floor escalator right at opening at 11am (or 10am on Sundays).  Convenient parking garage across the street.   If outside, get a table by the edge near an outdoor heater. If inside, insist on a booth by the window and they'll give it to you.  If you're with children and you don't insist, you'll likely be placed in an interior round booth with none of the spectacular downtown view.   For kids: Ask for the free kids' plate when waiter first comes - they'll bring them an oval dish with banana and bread slices.  The small plates menu has some great bite-size options for toddlers. Favorites: Iced Tea, Passion Fruit style Buffalo Blasts Fried Macaroni & Cheese Crispy Crab Wontons Crab Bites Chicken Samosas Ahi Tuna Roll Avocado Egg Rolls French Country Salad (note: 'To Go' counter sells Balsamic dressing in glass jars) Luau Salad Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club White Chicken Chili (take 1/2 home) Factory Burrito Grande (good for 2-3 people) Chicken Madeira Eggs over Fries (special order, prob charged under 'Farm Fresh Eggs') *Seasonal: Pumpkin cheese cake, Peppermint & Chocolate cheese cake (goes by a different name that is momentarily escaping me)   Not recommended: Shepherd's Pie Orange Chicken (though some people love this)"
Lille L.,"Oakland, United States",402,101,41,4.0,24/6/2009,"The secret to having an enjoyable experience here is to come at odd hours when it's *not* so crowded! I planned a late lunch for my friend's birthday and our party consisted of 12. I talked with the receptionist around 3:45pm on Tuesday. She didn't give me a buzzer because only half of us were present, but they still seated us 15 minutes later! The bread & butter was really good/fun to eat :P. I had the chicken bellagio after iPhone Yelping a picture of the dish. The chicken and prosciutto were really good, but the pasta was plain and oily. I wondered why they put so little sauce in, and found an article where the executive chef of Cheesecake said that in order to make dishes on the value menu profitable, ""Every ingredient had to be carefully balanced. What we found is that, where we may have used 3 ounces of a sauce before, 2 ounces actually was enough.""  No Bob Okura! 2 ounces is NOT enough! But it's okay, the decor, service, and $187 bill for a party of 12 makes this place deserve 4 stars from me."
Virginia S.,"San Francisco, United States",12,35,,4.0,16/6/2009,"I usually don't go to chain restaurants but the Cheesecake Factory is an exception here in SF. The porch seating is great for visitors, the cheesecake is always a crowd pleaser, and service is pretty quick.  For an extra special non-cheesecake treat, try the Chris' Outrageous Chocolate cake. Left me speechless."
kimberly w.,"Sebastopol, United States",0,46,,4.0,11/6/2009,"yes-- of course the bay area ""can do better than that.""  and we do.   however, if you find yourself downtown with multiple generations in tow-- kids want burgers and fries, someone wants a salad, and someone else wants a hearty dinner plate-- there's no better place to go to solve that argument. honestly, all of the food is pretty good.  the healthy salads (with the unfortunate name, ""weight management salads"" -- how much did they pay a really bad p.r. firm for that one?) are very good and have enough protein to satisfy.  drinks are pretty strong.  bread is good. cokes are refilled obsessively.   biggest fault is that the food is often oversalted.  that's probably why the kids like it so much.   with a fab view of union square and a fairly efficient beeper system for the usually long wait-- this is a super choice when downtown and in need of a decent meal at a reasonable price.  many of these dishes can easily be shared (they are mostly huge) which makes it even more economical.   would i suggest this place to my foodie friends or for an amazing adult date?  no.  do i go there when we need something to eat in a pretty atmosphere, with tourists or relatives along?  it's perfect."
JUDY L.,"San Francisco, United States",66,252,73,4.0,30/5/2009,"my first experience was yearrrrrrrrrrs ago when i had just broke up with my bf (which also happened right before my bday) ... so my cousin took me and my friends.. ordered a whole 6inch fresh strawberry cheesecake and we ate it at union square.. =] .. i still love that cheesecake!! the other day i had the chance to finally dine here.. however, we only got the nachos.. but those nachos were pretty damn good.. also ordered a peach bellini which was awesome too! love the heated outdoor patio!"
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, United States",14,70,,4.0,27/5/2009,"this place was jammed on a Friday night....i love cheesecake factory. The fried calamari is really good and their Cesar salad also. i usually get the bistro shrimp pasta. My favorite. Its cooked with mushroom, shrimps, and a perfect sauce. Also, the steak diana is very good...the sauce is delicious. The price is good. The only thing that sucks is the place is a little bit dirty. But the service was great!."
Garett T.,"San Francisco, United States",201,472,499,4.0,14/5/2009,"Having already been to two other Cheesecake Factories (Palo Alto and somewhere in LA), this particular visit is in comparison. Is it the best?  Most likely.  I really liked getting to sit outdoors on the 8th floor, with an excellent view of Union Square. Is the food great?  I liked everything I was served, bread, appetizers and all.  A bit pricy, but that was anticipated, and the plates are huge.  Plus, their food can indeed be spicy when listed as such in the menu, despite being told that wasn't true by the flippin' waiter! Do they serve drinks?  Yes.  I ordered a pineapple mojito, and it had good flavor, though it was not strong at all. Why is this review not 5 stars?  Two reasons.  First, and I expected this one, a TON of people went here, making us wait AT LEAST a literal hour, though we were able to browse around for awhile in the Macy's floor immediately below.  Second, I went in a group of 3, and we had told our waiter that we'd each like separate checks to pay individually, and he agreed.  But, did he do that?  No!"
Carrey W.,"Livingston, United States",63,106,94,4.0,11/5/2009,"We live in San Francisco and we still go to Cheesecake Factory.  It's just good food, and good decor.  We share, so the big portions are not wasted.  The lines here usually are too long, so our plan usually is to be there when they open. Recently we went for Mother's Day, and they took reservations for that day.  It was obvious that they were prepared, as there were lots of extra staff that day, and so the service we got was great.  The food as usual is great.  The only problem I had was the french fries that came with our salmon was not as great as in other places, but that's a small complaint.  That's because I can't find anything else wrong with this place.  We'll always go back to this place."
Clarence C.,"Vallejo, United States",0,1,,4.0,7/5/2009,"Where's my cheesecake. A day of shopping for things you need is always nice when you have the time and means to do so and what's even better is ending it off with a great selection of food, drinks and a dessert.  That being said I opted to go to The Cheese Cake Factory to get some reasonably priced food that taste great, a couple of cheap drinks and some yummy cheesecake to top it off.  Little did I know that this would take more time then the actual time I spent walking around Union Square.   Don't get me wrong, the food taste great and they gave me plenty.  (I had the Chicken Madeiri) Most Excellent.  All past the food which was a 5/5 let's move to the service,  I was having a real good time for the most part until I paid my bill.  See it how I paid before receiving my cheesecake that I order Murphy's Law came into play.  My cheesecake is brought to me in a haste and I was surprised. Low in behold it wasn't the right kind.  I was surprised I actually looked inside the bag, I never do, It was like a premonition.  Ok, not so bad right? Wrong?  Upon telling my waiter at the time who had been so nice to my guest and I had now turned into a total Terd.  What the Heck man? I know it wasn't my tip because I always tip generously, this guy must have been having a really bad day to treat me of all people in a bad way.  This guy totally ignored my request after telling him that I had the wrong cheesecake.  I had to personally go up to the hostess and ask her to get me a floor manager or someone higher than this guy who had turned out to be a jerk.  Long story short I had to basically sign my life away to get the correct cheesecake and to boot I didn't even get it for free."
