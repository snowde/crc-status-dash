Matt B.,"Irvine, United States",120,100,15,4.0,4/5/2009,"I loved the Godiva chocolate sundae. The fudge part was too sweet though. Also, there's a great view of union square from the patio. If there's not a long wait, you'll enjoy this place."
Rhea P.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,2,,4.0,26/4/2009,"I love going to the cheesecake factory. It's great for big or small parties (get a reservation) or for just going out. It is not to fancy, but is delicious. I am not a tourist, but I love it here. Though there will be a wait for a table, it's worth it. Also, you can go shopping in Macy's while you wait. If you do not have a preference of outside or inside, the wait will be shorter. Sitting outside, though cold, is a lot of fun. The service is good, and the food is delicious. Do not order both an appetizer and a main course. Appetizers are the size of main courses anywhere else, and entrees are almost to much for two. But it is extremely good. My dad, who hates these kinds of places, loves the food. I recommend Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. All the pasta's are good. In terms of drinks, they have incredible smoothies, but getting water is good so you can save up for dessert.  Dessert is delicious, and the wide variety of cheesecakes is always lots of fun. I don't like cheesecakes, so I ordered the chocolate cake. It is so delicious!! My friends ordered cheesecake and liked it very much. Just like the dinners, the desserts are huge. Five people couldn't finish two pieces of cake!! The only negative thing about the cheesecake factory is the wait, and it is worth it."
Paul R.,"Baton Rouge, United States",18,134,25,4.0,25/4/2009,"You just can't go wrong with this place.  I went here with a very picky party, which included two vegans.  We found something for everyone here.  All of the pastas (to my knowledge, anyway) are excellent, especially the Louisiana pasta.  This particular restaurant also has a nice outdoor seating area, from which you can see Union Square and various other buildings.  Service is good, although sometimes servers act rather perfunctorily.  This is a very good place, and I highly recommend it.  Just be sure to get out and see the other fantastic restaurants in San Francisco (especially the noodle bowl shops!)."
Kressler N.,"Orange County, United States",66,368,1730,4.0,24/4/2009,"Tourist trap?  Yes. Am I a tourist in SF? Yes. Ok, I know it's Union Square...and it's the famous Macy's...and it's the Cheesecake Factory.  And I also know it's SF and there are a million wonderful restaurants to eat at but sometimes I like the familiar and late on a Saturday night, there were few other choices that allowed my friends and I to eat/drink. We were lucky to find a table in the bar area so we sat down right away.  It is quite busy and I assume it's like this all the time.  My friends wanted a drink that was no longer on the menu so they asked if they could still make it and they did.  They also asked for the recipe and the bartender gave them the components so they could make the drinks themselves.  I ordered a Georgia peach which was super fruity and delicious.   None of us ordered cheesecake...and when I think about it, we don't usually order cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory.  Odd.  We did order the warm apple crisp and the mud pie...it was too much, even to share.   Overall, we had great service, food and drink..."
Monte R.,"San Leandro, United States",379,67,22,4.0,21/4/2009,the food is great. The tiramisu cheesecake is the greatest i'd give that five stars! The only i thing i hate about this place is the wait time on holidays and occasions. if you're going here for valentines day i suggest you sign in then walk around Frisco then come back 1.5 hours later.
Tiffany V.,"San Francisco, United States",579,701,656,4.0,18/4/2009,"I used to come here all the time when I was younger. I have no idea why this place has such a bad rep. I guess just because it's considered a tourist destination.  My brother and his wife wanted to meet my new loverman. Originally we were supposed to go to the restaurant above the SF Center but everybody got confused and thought it was The Cheesecake Factory so The Cheesecake Factory it was!  The place was packed as usual. We went at 12:30 on a Saturday. It was incredibly hot inside! I was like drenched in sweat. Haha. I really loved their bread basket. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but it was dark and amazing.  I ordered the Miso Salmon which my sister-in-law told me was one of her favorites. I asked her if it was like miso soup but it's completely different. I was wondering what it came with since it didn't say. It ended up coming on a bed of white rice which I didn't eat (empty carbs!) and some green beans. It was amazing! I hate when I get overcooked salmon but this one was cooked perfectly. I kind of wish it came with a different side though.  My loverman ordered the Herb Encrusted Salmon. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I have no idea whether or not it was good or not. Haha, I forgot to ask. My sister-in-law had the Boston Salad which looked amazing. I would've tried some had there not been meat all over it. She also ordered this salad from their new snack/small plates menu. It was some greens, goat cheese, and beets. She substituted the goat cheese with blue cheese. She kept raving about it. I hate beets and I'm allergic to mold so I question her tastes. My brother got the pasta carbonara which looked really oily but he said it was good. None of us ordered dessert, much to my sister-in-laws surprise. She really wanted to order a cheesecake but since we all weren't ordering anything, she didn't either.  My brother paid for our lunch. It ended up being $69 total, including a $10 tip. I really enjoyed the lunch and thought the atmosphere was  great and appropriate for the occasion. We had a great waitress too.  Minus one star because they don't post their nutrition information and because everyone knows all their food is a dieters nightmare."
Kathy D.,"Emeryville, United States",29,12,,4.0,18/4/2009,"The cheesecake alone makes this restaurant worth it.  This last time I went, I tried the White Chocolate Truffle with Macademias and Caramel.  YUM!  Of course, that was the end of the meal, but it was so good I had to mention it first =) They have a snack/small plates menu which I hadn't noticed before.  It is nice because a lot of their appetizers in the main menu could be entrees and cost as much.  My hubby and I had the Crispy Artichoke Hearts (very tasty with a yummy dip) and the Shrimp Scampi Crostini (also tasty, but rather skimpy on the shrimp).  Also, the bread that they serve is quite tasty, too. The menu is so massive that it takes me forever to decide what I want because so many things sound tasty.  We both loved our entrees.  I had the Chicken Madeira and hubby had the Kobe Burger.  I would order both again in an instant, but will probably try something else the next time just because there's so much to choose from. The only thing that bugs is the wait, but I think it's worth it.  Go during the week when it's not as much of a madhouse.  There's a reason why there's always a wait!"
arja r.,"San Jose, United States",19,10,5,4.0,17/4/2009,This is a great place to eat espically on a friday OR saturday night on the terrace. I love the eggplant sandwhich AND outragious chocolate cake. The steak diane is good but portions to small. The navajo taco is delicous as the pulled pork sandwhich.
Jeannette L.,"San Francisco, United States",37,324,1,4.0,16/4/2009,"The calories at this place will kill you alone. I'm rating this place on the basis that if you need to find a place with dessert late at night (open til 12:30am on Friday - trust me this was useful), you can stop by here and pick up a cheesecake for that forgotten friend's birthday. Life saver... Otherwise, it tastes like every other Cheesecake factory. What do you expect?"
Alice Z.,"San Francisco, United States",215,254,52,4.0,10/4/2009,"The good ol' Cheescake Factory. This is definitely a place where birthdays, dates, lunches, and friendly dinners are held through high school. I never celebrated my birthday here, but known many people who have. The service is okay, depends on who the waiter is. I HATE IT when the waiters hella look down on you and your friends because you're just a bunch of high school kids. That's easy, just no tip for this b*tch. (: The food is always good, I like the free bread that they offer with butter. My favorite dish is the Burger with Fries. It's an old time favorite(: I've tried the Louisiana Pasta, it comes with fried chicken breasts on top of the pasta. Creamy. But if i really wanted Italian food I'd go to BUCA, my favorite place in the world(: The Oreo Cheesecake is too sweet, don't get that. And I hate the long line waiting! Last time i went, waited for 1 hour! Anyways enjoy this place when you feel like going somewhere fancy shamscy!"
Mandy D.,"San Francisco, United States",89,355,209,4.0,8/4/2009,"Wait can be long, that's expected. For a shorter wait, go during lunch on the weekdays. If you're waiting for a while, take a look at the menu at the bottom of the escalator or grab a menu. That way, when you're seated after a long wait, you'll know exactly what to get. Depending on your server, it can be slow, but I never had a horrible experience.  The food: Whenever I'm craving for pasta, this is the place I would go. I almost always get the farfalle chicken with roasted garlic. By the time I'm finished with my meal, I barely have room for cheesecake because it's so heavy. The cheesecakes are worth a try.  One of my favorite mashed potatoes have to be from here. I liked it so much that I asked the server what was in it. He said there's no butter and from what he knows, there's chicken broth and heavy cream. So for you vegans/vegetarians out there, the mashed potatoes has chicken broth!"
Alina M.,"Sunnyvale, United States",5000,492,1034,4.0,24/3/2009,"I used to work as a hostess years and years ago here and as a hostess, I disliked it here. It was so packed, it was hard to walk around and show people to their tables, and it was unorganized and so chaotic. Oh wait, that's the same reason I dislike it here as a regular customer too... Located on top of Macy's overlooking Union Square, it's in a centralized location. And being in a centralized location, you'd think that it would be more organized but it is so freaking chaotic here. Starting from the bottom floor, you have to wait in line to go into the elevator except there are 2 elevators and tourists don't know that only ONE goes to cheesecake. When you get up to Cheesecake, you pour into a huge roomful of people and you think you're in the line to put your name on the list and you don't realize until minutes later that you're not in any line and in fact, you're just waiting in the area that people are waiting to be seated. Then you go to the front hostess counter where there's no real line so you push your way to the front and get your little beeper and it's normally a 25+ minute wait. Yo could go to the bar but it's super duper tiny so there's no space to sit. There are table but only 3 so good luck with that. So then you wait, but you can't sit because there's only 2 small benches for people to wait so you stand amongst dozens of people with your shopping bags getting heavier and heavier. So that's pretty much the worst part of it. If you can get through that, the rest is a breeze. Staff is pretty nice there. Food is delicious. If you eat outside and it starts raining though, there is no tarp over head so you have to go inside and wait all over again for a table. Why is it so hard to put a retractable tarp outside???  Working here, I met a lot of famous people. (I didn't know Mos Def was so short!!!)  Go here during non peak times and you don't have to deal with the mess."
brendan w.,"San Francisco, United States",1,4,,4.0,23/3/2009,"Really enjoyed it! big selection and tasty food just what i was looking for.   If your in a hurry this is not the place for you, no reservations an all. and to all those people complaining about the portions being too big...REALLY! just dont eat it all."
Keara C.,"San Francisco, United States",228,108,1,4.0,21/3/2009,"I have to give it up to the Cheesecake factory chain. I usually don't like chain restaurants but this one  upholds a very high standard in the quality of their food.  I've always had a pleasant experience at this SF one. That is because I know when to go. If you live/work in the area, go for lunch at around 11:30 or past 2 (lunch ends at 5 on the weekends) and dinner before 6:30. You will avoid all the lines with the tourist and such.  I love their lunch menu. Even though they call it ""smaller"" portions, they are almost as big as the dinner size but it's almost half the price (ranges from $7-12 vs dinner $13-25). My recommendations for lunch is the pasta carbonara. This is one of the best panchetta carbonara I've had because it doesn't have the ""egg-y"" taste. Because the pasta is tossed in yolk before serving, it's hard to master the dish and make sure that the yolk does not overpower the rest of the taste. Next I would recommend the BBQ chicken salad. I don't usually like chicken in my salad but this BBQ one is tasty and tender. It is tossed in a BBQ/light ranch dressing with beans, lots of avocado, corn, lettuce, and topped with onion rings. I also love the shrimp scampi angel hair pasta. It is cooked with fresh tomato, basil, garlic, and olive oil --- sometimes the most simple dishes turn out to be the best ones.  I do have a sweet tooth and I'm a sucker for cheesecake but I find that most of the cheesecake on the menu is waaay too sweet. When I eat my cheesecake i want to experience the cheesy taste and not oreo, chocolate, banana, and the other 30 absurd flavors they have. I usually stick with the vanilla bean one (make sure you ask them to go easy on the whip cream). It's rich in cheesecake flavor with a hint of vanilla bean. yummy.  The bread is good. Love the wheat. Lastly, the ambiance is gorgeous. It is situated at the top floor of Macy's, the center of union square. On a summer night (outside is heated) or a sunny afternoon, ask for outside seating. It gives a pigeon eye view of lovely downtown SF."
Vivian H.,"Seattle, United States",330,891,1610,4.0,19/3/2009,"This is where 99 out of 100 birthday lunches and dinners were held in high school. This is where I would go to eat with friends when we were feeling a little fancy... in high school. This is a restaurant you always go to at least once with each boyfriend. I love the view from this restaurant but I have never opted to sit outside, since I know how the wind in SF can be. The food is pretty tasty, especially the avocado eggrolls and Evelyn's favorite pasta.  The portions are always filling and I almost always have to take it home.  The bread is good too (that's always important to me). The wait to get a table always seems to go by really quickly for some reason. Now that I've been out of high school and the Cheesecake Factory ""trend"" that was a part of it, I opt to eat elsewhere and try new restaurants.  But really, there is nothing wrong with the Cheesecake Factory."
Crystal S.,"San Francisco, United States",366,104,5,4.0,16/3/2009,"This cheesecake factory is the best cheesecake factory I've been to by far. I've been to many over the State and no one compares to the one in SF. Not only is this restaurant centrally located in the heart of Downtown, it has such an amazing view! The terrace seating overlooks the beautiful Union Square. When it comes to consistency and quality, this Cheesecake factory has beaten all the rest. I've been to other cheesecake factories which food I had to send back... here... I've never had a problem. My recommendations are:  Bistro Shrimp Pasta Jambalaya Pasta Carpaccio Avacado Egg Rolls BBQ Chicken Salad Caramel De Leche Cheesecake Frozen Iced Mango All are great selections and what I order every time I go there!"
Barbara O.,"Martinez, United States",88,25,,4.0,2/3/2009,"Maybe it's just me but I've never had a ""bad"" experience at the cheesecake factory. Probably because I do realize that it is a chain restaurant so it's pretty absurb to think that you're going to get some ""to-die-for"" meal at this place. That being said I came here about 2 weeks ago on a weekday (I think it was a wednesday). We waited a little bit, but it couldn't have been longer than 5 minutes. We asked to eat outside since I had never done that before. I lucked out cause I got to sit right next to a heat lamp that actually did a good job keeping me warm. My friend and I each had one drink, split an appitizer, and each had our own piece of cheesecake and we ended up with a 50 dollar bill. But I must say, we were still pretty full. I personally like the cheesecake so I was satisfied. The only slightly annoying part of the night was the server who kept coming back every 5 minutes to check up on us. I like people to be attentive....but that was taking it to the extreme."
AimFee G.,"San Francisco, United States",15,15,,4.0,1/3/2009,"well, to start, this is our first review, so bear with us! it was busy as usual on a friday night. it took about 35 minues to get seated and there's nowhere to wait or sit so you have to stand. and theres also a line for the elevator. thats probably the worst part. other than that, the foods really good. the waiter was veryy very nice to us. they didn't forget anything we asked for. the bread and butter is hella good! and the snickers cheesecake is off the hook! i hella recommend that! the lightings very dim tho so you can barely read your menu. although it is simple, the chicken fettuchini is above average. the fried macaroni balls (in the appetizers) are pretty great too. and you should also try the ranch style burger.  so this is our first review with lots more to come!"
Victoria B.,"Turlock, United States",7,121,9,4.0,24/2/2009,"If anything, go here for the view! It is simply beautiful ! It is always crowded though so be prepared for a wait. The food is delicious and the cheesecake scrumptious! It's a chain, but so what? Get over it and your non-chain visiting self and go the Cheesecake, really."
