Ryan H.,"San Francisco, United States",13,45,4,4.0,24/2/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory Just saying the name makes my mouth water. I had become so accustomed to my nearest Cheesecake Factory that when moving to the city I felt a little like I was cheating on my old favorite, as the new location was quite different (in location and overall atmosphere). Yes it generally looked the same, but being in the middle of a busy city at the top of a Macy's department store was quite a change. But have no fear because what makes The Cheesecake Factory so utterly amazing has not changed one bit....the FOOD! YUM!   From appetizers, to salads, to pizzas, to pastas, to entrees, and of course cheesecake, The Cheesecake Factory will not let you down when it comes to what makes it one of my ALL time favorite chains. Personal favorites are the Fried Mac & Cheese appetizers (you heard me right), the Thai Chicken Pasta (peanutty goodness), the Chicken Madera (what wouldn't be good if it was smothered in mozzarella), and the Carrot Cake Cheesecake (heaven on a plate). Cocktails are grand too. A little pricey, but the portions are out of control, and if you go during lunch they have a whole slew of lunch items that seem just as big as the dinner portions but at a much more reasonable price. This location would have received 5 stars but there seems to ALWAYS be a long wait, which I guess is a testament of a good restaurant, but I am not a fan of waiting....especially when I am hungry!"
Naomi h.,"San Jose, United States",10,65,,4.0,16/2/2009,I love their cheese cake! so smooth and taste good... but this restaurant many ppl there on weekend.. I can't even find any seat and no feeling to wait.... So I go there only just ordered cheese cake to go...
Jay D.,"San Francisco, United States",5,50,2,4.0,14/2/2009,"I went here with a friend for dinner on a weeknight a few weeks ago. Judging from that last visit, and remembering my experience from this place in the past many years ago, my observation is that the quality of service and food are still the same. We sat outside under the heat lamps and the view of Union Square.  The ambiance of the plaza at night is beautiful, although I should have chosen a warmer night to eat outside....the outdoor heat lamps didn't really keep my hands and face warm enough from the cold. The food we ordered was very good.  I can't remember what we ordered, but I remember that we ordered 2 appetizers and one main dish.  One of the main dishes was a daily special not in the menu....a four-flavor thin crust pizza, which was OK.  I really didn't notice how special it was to be considered something not yet in the menu.  One of the appetizers was a cornbread appetizer with a special sauce surrounding it...I can't remember the name of it right now, but it was between excellent and very good.  We also ordered nachos with guacamole dip, salsa dip, and sour cream, which wasn't bad either.   Service - 4 stars Food - 4 stars"
Sonlay V.,"Southern California, United States",221,917,283,4.0,10/2/2009,"I really enjoyed this place. I received good service and enjoyed my food. Sure it was a little pricey, but I enjoyed myself. Also you get a great view if you decide to eat outdoors. It is really nice. The only reason why I put it 4 instead of 5 stars is that you are unable to make reservations. So you will have to wait maybe two hours to be seated."
Michael S.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,38,,4.0,5/2/2009,"I like this place. I don't mind the wait and the menu has something for everyone. I've always had good service and I like the atmosphere. I don't think that there is a better location in all of san francisco.     I'm a pretty easy to please when it comes to food, but this is still one of my favorite places for a reasonable meal."
Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, United States",212,574,10,4.0,3/2/2009,"I'm a little biased as I always LOVED the cheesecake factory during college in Seattle (and many friends were waiters there), but honestly where else can you go with SUCH a diverse menu?! This location is no exception (although you do have to brave the crowds of tourists in union square to get there--and of course this place is filled with them too!), although there will inevitably be a long wait if you come on a weekend!  The view is amazing, although sadly the last time i was here it was too cold to sit outside... The food and drinks are both great (come here just for drinks a couple times, as their cocktail menu is equally diverse!), and if you're desperate and sick of waiting for a real table, you can try to grab a bar table when/if someone vacates to eat dinner at! The bills can add up fairly quickly, but service is always great, and the food is what you'd picture, american (even regarding the asian etc foods, its all a very american version i'd say), but rarely a disappointment!"
Meghan P.,"Woodside, United States",3059,1070,12,4.0,2/2/2009,"I really miss the huge plate of onion strings that the Cheesecake Factory used to serve. Please please please bring them back! They would definitely be worth at least a star to me! This Cheesecake Factory is fun though because you can sit outside on the deck with an amazing view of Union Square. It's phenomenal! Then, you can order anything your heart desires from their extensive menu. I usually pick one of the extra, extra large salads such as the chinese chicken salad. The drinks at this Cheesecake aren't quite as yummy as those I've imbibed at others... they are still creative though! If you have any space left after dinner, you should definitely opt for their namesake cheesecake. Yum, yum, delish!"
Audrey L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,76,,4.0,31/1/2009,"I probably would never go here for dinner- because of the insanely long wait. I've had lunch out here on the rooftop, which was well worth it, especially when the weather was beautiful. Their food is pretty good, while their cheesecake is divine. Just grab it to go and sit on the bench across from Macy's. Yum!"
Carly W.,"San Francisco, United States",4,127,,4.0,20/1/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone! Yes, the line is usually ridiculously long, but I think that it is worth the wait. I would recommend going at off times.  For appetizers I recommend the avocado egg rolls if you like avocado and the sweet corn tamale cakes!! I would go back just for those two things. For dinner, I have tried the stuffed chicken tortillas, pasta carbonara, and the shepherds pie. I would recommend any of these three items. They give you huge portions too, so expect to take food home.  I am not normally a fan of cheesecake, but I have tried a couple different kinds at the Cheesecake Factory and have liked them all! Also, just a warning, they are very rich."
Tina W.,"New York, United States",160,101,15,4.0,19/1/2009,"The cheesecake here is ridiculously amazing! And coming from a person that normally despises cheesecake, that's really saying a lot. The wait for this restaurant was also ridiculous. I think we got in line at around 3pm and were seated around 5:30pm. Also unfortunate is the fact that their actual food is pretty average despite what you pay."
JenJen W.,"Palo Alto, United States",39,338,23,4.0,19/1/2009,The food here is not bad but warning the portions are HUGE! It's definitely a great place to come with a group of people!  I came here one time for my birthday and they ended up giving me a free slice of cheesecake!  I love the cheesecakes here!  They have many different flavors and I ususally go for the chocolate type :)  Just try to avoid high peak time...this place is always packed!
Gill C.,"San Francisco, United States",359,379,1573,4.0,17/1/2009,"OK, I know it's a chain, and usually the wait for a table at this location is absolutely absurd. However, it was a balmy January week night, and was willing to bet that getting a table at the bar wouldn't be too problematic.  Well, the CF experience didn't start off well.  After we checked in, our hostess disappeared and we waited by the reception desk for what seemed like 10 minutes. All was forgiven when she led us to one of the best tables in the house, outside and by a heat lamp. The view was amazing and the outside temperature was perfect.  After perusing the ginormous menu, we decided on a few cocktails, an appetizer, and a salad.  Cocktails -- The blended Bellini.. I know, those 2 words shouldn't go together, but it worked and went down so smoothly.  Our app was the Crispy Crab Wontons, which is their version of Crab Rangoon. Fresh Crab meat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts and Sweet Chili Sauce. OMG this was so lovely. It wasn't greasy fried, and with ample wontons (maybe 8). You could really taste the crab and couldn't stop popping these in my mouth.  Before the salads arrived, I started to get full from the basket of the warm bread and wontons.  So, the salad was the French Country Salad -Mixed Greens, Grilled Asparagus, Fresh Beets, Goat Cheese and Candied Pecans. I always order any menu item that includes goat cheese, so this was a no brainer. Requested it be beet-less. This was an 'appetizer salad' but was a perfectly sized portion. There would be no way I'd finish an entree sized salad. It was a good salad, but was disappointed that the cheese wasn't warm and that there wasn't enough pecans.  Our service was decent, and I know it can't be hit or miss depending on the day and time of day you go. No dessert was consumed at this dinner, but I usually get the original cheesecake or oreo.  Overall, this was a lovely CF dining experience. What's not to enjoy when you have a warm winter evening, an excellent dinner companion, and good food!"
Jeff T.,"Daly City, United States",56,76,5,4.0,14/1/2009,"Got there today around 6:30p.m... The fiance and the roommate and I got seated pretty quickly... This time on the side where the bar's located.  I never sat on that side before.  The food was good... I ordered the Salisbury steak. I got full from eating the mash potatoes.  Ordered two 7 and 7's.  Didn't really taste the Seagrams...  My roommate had three martini's with regular vodka...  It taste like crap.  So, thumbs down to the drinks.   Waiter and waitress were very friendly and tend to our needs when they had the time.  So it was an ok experience..."
Miss H.,"San Francisco, United States",262,324,262,4.0,14/1/2009,"Although the wait at this location is RIDICULOUS (even at 10pm for dessert on a weekday), it's still my favorite because it's in good ol' SF! I've been here 5 million times but only recently was I able to finally sample their cheesecakes! Between 11 people, we shared the key lime, kahlua, mudpie, fresh strawberry, and black & white cheesecakes. $5 a person (incl. tip), it's sooooo worth it since you can try different ones without getting sick of a single flavor."
BL T.,"San Francisco, United States",18,13,,4.0,14/1/2009,"Well here goes nothing. It's my first attempt at doing this. I have been reading alot of the reviews by other people and I feel like I'm a little bit out of my league here. Anywho, I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Everything I have ever eaten here has been terriffic, stupendous and yes, even yummy. Guess I could also add tasty. Service depends on what day and time of day you are there. All in all, service is ok. I'd give it 5 stars but they did away with my favorite item. The onion appitizer. It was so good. I used to go there just for that and a beer. Made my day. They still have some dishes where they put those yummmy onions on them but not to many. If your going there on a Sunday morning I'd like to suggest you get there about 10:30 to beat the crowd."
Jacqueline D.,"Vallejo, United States",88,53,,4.0,13/1/2009,"Sometimes the line/wait gets a little CRAZY, too long, but thats because everyone likes eating here.  I enjoy their pasta and of course their desserts.  One of my faves is the ghiradelli pie or something to that manner.  I loved going here with the BP interns at Nordies, lol.  After our monthly meetings we would go here and just relax and chat it up.  The price is pretty expensive, and depending on ur server you can either have the best time or a so-so time, its a toss up on that one."
Jayna B.,"San Francisco, United States",1,13,,4.0,10/1/2009,"I can't complain. BF and I received a gift certificate from my parents so we went down there today to use it up. Yes... the wait is horrible but we knew it would be so that wasn't a problem.  It was maybe my 4th time at this location, 7th dining at this chain.  If you aren't prepared to wait, go to another restaurant and save yourself the frustration. I ordered the soup, salad and 1/2 sandwich combo for $10.  I got a bowl of soup, lots of green and an entire sandwich.  Apparently there was a mistake so they gave me a whole.  I immediately set aside 1/2 of my sandwich as the plate in front of me could easily feed 2 people.  My BF and I enjoyed our food --  I expected my soup to be like a canned version but it was quite tasty.  I wish they still had the veggie burger on the menu as it was very good.  There was probably tons of fat in it but it was yummy and part of the reason I go back is that I hope it'll reappear. One complaint is that they could have been a little more generous with their pour on the wine.  Portion sizes are so large on everything else I wonder why they needed to skimp on my glass of not fancy white wine.   Oh and I wish they'd tone down the decor.   Keep the sphinx murals in Vegas."
Danielle S.,"Crestview, United States",9,53,,4.0,8/1/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has some pretty damn good food, but expect to pay a pretty penny. Given the fact that it is in Union Square and at the top of Macy's, expect to wait a while. I don't think they take reservations, which I think is pretty silly considering how insanely busy they are. Their outdoor seating area is beautiful and the view is amazing, just be prepared to get a visit from a pigeon searching for food. All in all the food is good, and dessert is just as good, and the wait staff can be a hit and miss, but they are good for the most part."
Amy X.,"San Francisco, United States",125,303,797,4.0,1/1/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory. Definitely over-rated. I went on Christmas Eve and had to wait 2 hours. I think so many people like this place because it's not too expensive and it is REALLY pretty inside. Also, I really love the menu. They have so many different seletions. My favorite is the Chicken Madeira. The chicken isn't dry and there is cheese and mushrooms on top with mashed potatoes on the side. It was VERY delicious. It's supposedly the most popular dish. I would come to the cheesecake factory more often if it weren't for the long wait."
Patra B.,"San Francisco, United States",1259,552,2173,4.0,28/12/2008,"My roommate and I were in charge of dessert for our friend's holiday party.  Unfortunately, the place we wanted to get cheesecake from was closed for the holidays until after New Year's.  =( We were just going to go to Costco to get a ginormous cheesecake, but as we were shopping our hearts out in Union Square, we decided to check out The Cheesecake Factory.  Round and round we went up the escalators...then we had to squeeeeeze our way through the massive crowd waiting to be seated.  Since it was the day after Christmas, they were sold out of alot of flavors.  We ended up getting an Oreo Cheesecake(   ) and a White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake(   ).  Both were quite delicious.  I've never tried a cheesecake that I didn't like from here. Just a note:  Let the cheesecake sit out for a bit or it'll still be frozen inside.  =P"
