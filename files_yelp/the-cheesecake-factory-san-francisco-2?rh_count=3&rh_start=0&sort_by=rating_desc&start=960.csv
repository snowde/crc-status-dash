Al B.,"Los Angeles, United States",20,474,59,4.0,26/12/2008,"This is a very cool location. It's always busy and there is almost always a wait (20-40 min usually), so expect that. If the weather permits and you are so inclined, ask to sit outside on their patio. You get to have an open-air view of Union Square and the surrounding hotels and skyscrapers. It's pretty unique. Service is adequate although because the restaurant is so busy, the servers never seem to get a chance to breathe. Breakfast is pretty amazing. Their brioche french toast is to die for. The omelettes are also very good. Portions are very generous. Lunch and dinner are also great. The Luau Salad is very fun. To enter, you will need to take the Macy's escalators or the express elevator from the ground floor from the Geary St. entrance to Macy's. As for parking, the Union Square garage across the street is probably your best bet. There are other parking structures in the area as well."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, United States",1536,1308,2750,4.0,22/12/2008,"I have a love/hate relationship with this location: PROS: - Cool view of Union Square - Couches on the floor below for you to sit and relax if you have a 1 hour plus wait - Good food - Balcony seating CONS: - 2 hour wait on a Friday night D; - a bitch to get up to (8 floors up via escalator OR 30 minute wait for the elevator) - Complete chaos on a busy night It's worth it if it's your first time (either at this location or at Cheesecake Factory), otherwise go to another not-so-busy location."
Vickie B.,"Irvine, United States",80,74,28,4.0,29/11/2008,I enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory on top of Macy*s during the holidays. The only problem was waiting for 10-20 minutes for a table. The service is great here.
Kelly L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,4.0,26/11/2008,Yummy food!  Great view if you sit outside.  I love that.  Nice staff.  A little expensive for me (i'm a student though) but not bad.  I love the banana cream cheesecake mmmmmmm!  Go here :)
Hiromi N.,"San Francisco, United States",429,986,199,4.0,21/11/2008,"Don't be a hater, baby!  I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  I leave overly full...and after almost an hour wait, that is the way one should feel.    Yeah, there are more inventive restos in the City, but come on...when you want consistency and something that you know will not disappoint...well...I am Cheesecake factory. The wait is the only thing that really drags me down...really down...the line can be ridiculous...I want to eat w/in 30 minutes of arrival...anything more than that turns me off. Last trip there was for lunch after the Join the Impact Rally in front of City Hall. I was in the mood for a salad... BUT... Oh well...settled for some pasta bolognese.... Lunch for 2:  37.65 sans tip (2 lunch meals, 1 side of Mashed potatoes, 1 soda and 1 cheesecake...yyummmmmyyy)"
Jon J.,"San Francisco, United States",4,67,4,4.0,20/11/2008,"Cheesecake factory is as classic as Tony Roma's, with their Complete Menu to variation. Their servings are enormous! but its the variation comes in good quality as well as quantity."
Christina S.,"San Francisco, United States",218,322,1,4.0,18/11/2008,The avocado egg rolls are to die for and worthy of the wait PERIOD
Michelle D.,"Hayward, United States",19,125,116,4.0,16/11/2008,"i absolutely recommend eating outside on the balcony around dusk, preferably with a hot date. its really quite refreshing to just kick back, relax and enjoy a semi candle lit dinner (BTW, the BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA is wonderful) the skyline of the city lights up around you and you can watch people skating below at the skating rink.  ps. its mandatory you eat cheesecake while you're there...no matter how stuffed you are! they have the nice selection."
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, United States",1078,153,707,4.0,15/11/2008,"Robert the bartender is absolutely worth the wait!!!!  Fast, efficient, and attentive. We are always able to grab a seat at the bar when tying to avoid the typical hour wait. The pink lemonade, passion fruit mojitos, and bikini martinis are a must. Spinach dip,  Santa Fe salad, fish tacos, chipotle chicken pasta dish are our favorites.  As far a cheesecake white raspberry macadamia, Dulce DE luche, chocolate chip cookie dough, brownie sundae cheesecake are just a few of our favs. The best nights to go are Monday and Tuesdays. :)  The french toast at Brunch is also AMAZING!"
Eda L.,"San Francisco, United States",26,25,,4.0,4/11/2008,"I get overexcited when I see their menu. WHAT TO GET?!?! I've never been let down with the Herb Crusted Salmon with the Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus. It's YUM.. oh  yes. Their Original Cheesecake is none like any other. My mom and I used to pack a slice or two to go when the sweet-tooth acted up. Sweet, fond memories.. strictly referring to the consumption process that is. Minus 1 star for the waiting line powered by Energizer: it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.. and on."
Jamie L.,"Oakland, United States",340,688,472,4.0,26/10/2008,"I haven't been here for awhile, but when I come I do leave content, nonethless. I can't remember what I usually get, but this time around, I got the Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. I found that me, bacon, cheese, and meat have been on my menu list lately.  Sadly, the only disappointment was their daiquari was a smoothie. Yet, the service made up for that and the huge portions of food. And very resonable I might add. Lastly, this place would get a five if it wasn't so crowded everytime we came. Its worth the visit though."
Eric A.,"San Francisco, United States",327,240,20,4.0,16/10/2008,"Decently priced, sit down restaurant chain establishment. I've had better dinners, but paid 3 times as much to achieve them. It's a chain restaurant, what do you expect? The prices aren't that bad. The food is well prepared, and tastes good, and the outside balcony is heated. Dinner can not be topped if on a night when you can see the fog rolling into Union Square, under heated lamps, and enjoying a dinner with close people.  I'm not the hugest fan of the cheesecake, only because I only enjoy traditional New York stuff (and legit New York Cheesecake is THE BEST!!!).  The wait can be a major turn off, especially around dinner time, and the bar prices are well over priced, but hey your at a national chain restaurant in the city. what do you expect? Overall good times."
Ju D.,"Bay Area, United States",6,199,89,4.0,12/10/2008,"This is the first time in a long time that i've been back to cheesecake factory.  why?  becuase the long lines always deter me away.   but tonight, I came here with my bf anyway. on a friday night, we got lucky with parking at the after 6pm time.  came upstairs to the restaurant about 6:30pm and put our name down quickly.  okie, that will be 25-40 mins wait.  alrite, so we did just that with our light-up buzzer pager.  as we waited, more people started come through, the line never got shorter.   when the red lights came up! yay, exactly 40 mins wait, as expected.  of course we waited a few more minutes by the pillar for our names to be called and get our seats.  we got a cute 2-person booth.  very quaint.  as soon as we sat, our waitress came by and introducted herself, along with a trainee staff beside her.  after a bit, we decided on our dish and ordered.  throughout the whole time, our servers were both very diligent and attentive.  they worked fast yet cortially. my bf had the kobe beef burger and i ordered the grilled skirt steak.  we also had the strawberry colada.  too sweet and not enough liquor.  =P   the entrees were delicious.  one suprising thing is that our orders came out so fast!  we were quite hungry from the long wait and were trying not to down too much bread.  but as soon as we finish our first piece of bread, our dishes were out hot and ready!  my first thought was it wasn't our order, but it is!!!    yes!!!    the kobe burger is huge & tall, probably a quarter pounder.  good size for my hungry guy.  cooked medium, as requested.  it tastes good in that its not very greasy, moist and tender.  burger had mushrooms but no sauce, but still tasted good (we added in ketchep for our preference).   the fries are excellent!  crisp but not oily!   and my grilled skirt steak, about 6 pieces.  grilled and topped with variaty of mushroom sauce (shitake, etc).  this is great too!  the beef is cooked very well (not tough at all!!!), and came with large portion of corn & veggie mix on the side, with mash as well.  good balance.    very filling and tasty.  needless to say, we both finished everything.  we tried, but coudn't save our stomachs for the cheesecake, so ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake ($6.95) to go.   we devoured it that evening with a hot mug of green tea.   the cheesecake is a must when you're here.  All the entrees are excellent at a decent price.  many range from mid $15 and up.  the burger was only $15 and the skirt steak is $20.  the cocktail about $10.   altogether, the bill came to be $55 (bill total).  not too bad for two hungry people!"
Marc E.,"Daly City, United States",63,172,4,4.0,7/10/2008,dang! thai lettuce wraps are a meal by itself!  good stuff!! the ahi carpaccio is to freakn' die for!! i want it...now!!!!! the jamaican black pepper shrimp was awesome!!  cheesecake! mmmmmmmmmmm!! so many to choose from!
foodi e.,"San Francisco, United States",8,74,,4.0,6/10/2008,"Over the years, we've collected (not literally) a lot of receipts from here. We usually come for dinner but the hubby & I have had a few lunch dates. Food is solid. Their portions are huge yet still affordable.  Service is generally ok, depending on the server. But the wait-another story. Bring something to do. Unless you enjoy staring @ the ceiling, because after a while, you run out of things to look at. haha.  Our regulars: ~ calamari ~ firecracker salmon rolls ~ ""chicken pot pie"" soup  ~ kobe burger ~ 4 cheese pasta w/ spaghettini ~ shrimp scampi-my style-with mashed potatoes instead of noodles & a side of garlic dip & firecracker sauce... oooh yeah.. ~ & of course, a lemonade, ice tea (love the smell!) & coke we've basically tried most of the items on the menu.. they're all pretty good.. we had dinner here last night & tried their fried mac n cheese for the first time & it was soooo goood. it's a meal in itself.. the hubby was in food heaven..   =D setbacks: ~ dining area by the restroom is not as well ventilated as the opposite side.. it gets really stuffy & uncomfortable.. ~ floors are super slippery at times ~ there's an a-hole of a manager in SF..  ~ chairs are uncomfortable ~ the hubby doesn't enjoy dim lighting.. i, on the other hand, enjoy it.. ~ don't take reservations & long waits on most days ~ not enough seats for people waiting.. they could put some on either side of the escalator.. ~ SF- rude tourists could get really annoying ~ pigeons out in the patio are gross! (it's not their fault, i know! but still gross!) ~ if you come late saturday, they tend to run out of my favorite soup ~ NO KIDS MEALS!!! & they can't even do half portions.. pshhh..  ~ & most recently, they closed off one of the doors going out into the balcony..  other locations we've been to: ~ Palo Alto ~ Valley Fair, SJ ~ Oakridge, SJ ~ Marin SF is still my fave b/c of the view & accessibility to shops.. despite all ther setbacks, for the most part, we still enjoy eating here.. i mean.. what do you really expect from a chain? i have nothing against it, i'm just saying.. if it weren't for the food this rating should only be a 3..."
Johnell H.,"El Cerrito, United States",0,5,,4.0,5/10/2008,"I like the cheesecake factory simply for the atmosphere, food, drinks (Georgia Peach), cheese cake and I have never had bad service i just can't always afford bridge toll, and parking."
Annie S.,"San Francisco, United States",106,332,512,4.0,3/10/2008,"I've always wanted to come here and I finally had the chance to! The downside: a 40 minute wait. I ordered the luau salad (lunch portion $10) and it was freakin' delicious. I would totally order it again. I also tried some of my friend's Thai Chicken Pasta. (lunch $10) That was really really good, too. I also tried some Chicken Piccata (lunch $10)... that was alright. Not my favorite. But the best of show goes to the cheesecake. White chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. TO DIE FOR, LITERALLY...."
Jon J.,"San Francisco, United States",188,8,,4.0,29/9/2008,"Only reason why i gave 4 stars is because this one waiter was kinda stuck up to us. We told the manager and she greatly apologize, but other than that the food was great, kinda pricey, but good. Only had one bad time there with a waiter, but all in all its pretty good."
Tiffany T.,"San Francisco, United States",251,39,14,4.0,26/9/2008,"I was originally thinking about giving this place 3-stars. But.. I gave them an extra star for the yummy cheesecake I had the other night. I do like this place because they close late. I don't like this place because you can't come here during dinner hours and not expect to wait 2 hours for a table!  So this time, the bf and I were smart. =) We went to catch the 740 showing at Metreon, got outta the theaters around 9 something, then walked our way over to Cheesecake factory and got a table in no time, no wait. That's the way I like it, NO WAIT DAMMIT!! Anywaysss.... Since their food portions are too large for me to consume all by myself, we decided to share, so that we can end off the night with a slice of cheesecake. Ordered an appetizer, entree, and cheesecake, which I haven't eaten for a very long while now to think about it.  - Factory nachos with spicy chicken - pretty good; I would probably order that again if I come back with a group of friends. But you can get nachos at any Mexican joint in SF - Farfelle chicken with roasted garlic (?) - ehhh.. I wasn't in the mood for pasta, but this dish was okkk... - Limited edition 30th Anniversary cheesecake - yuuummmm!! this was probably the only thing I was satisfied with throughout the night. A layer of original cheesecake, then another layer of chocolate cake (x2). Totally satisfied my sweet tooth. =D I'm usually not a very big fan of franchise restaurants, other than BJs. Cheesecake Factory would probably be a second or third choice. I'm in the mood for cheesecakes. I see that Zanzes over on Ocean Ave has pretty rad ratings. Maybe I'll try that place and let you guys know how that goes. I'm out!"
