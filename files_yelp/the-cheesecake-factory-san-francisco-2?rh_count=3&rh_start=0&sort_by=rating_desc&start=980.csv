Michael P.,"San Francisco, United States",49,42,1,4.0,22/9/2008,"Worth what you'll spend?  Probably. Good service?  Better than average. Decent ambience?  If you don't mind tourists. Food/drinks tasty?  Scrumcious. Free refills on soda?  Yippers. Bonus points for?  Seating in the bar without a wait, if you can grab a table. The Cheesecake Factory appeals to the little kid in me that grew up in the suburbs with chain restaurants.  It's usually a zoo during peak business hours, and they are kind of militant about getting people seated all at once.  The process of getting a table is definitely not my favorite part about dining here.  What I do like is the varied menu, which means most anyone you bring can find something to eat.  It's not super cheap, but the portions are huge and two people can easily split an entree.  It's predictable, centrally located in Union Square, and always lively.  Come here if you want something familiar and you don't mind a 30-60+ minute wait."
Ani M.,"Glendale, United States",93,53,3,4.0,21/9/2008,"I love the Cheesecake factory in general, it's one of the few chain restaurants I enjoy, but the one in Union Square is definitely my fav! It's on the top floor of the Macy's. Sit outside because you get a great view, but watch out for pigeons!!"
Melissa N.,"Bay Area, United States",34,84,39,4.0,14/9/2008,"Cheescake Factory will always be a favorite spot for me, no matter what. The food is the same no matter which restaurant you are at - consistency is very important. To top that off - the cheesecake is to die for. All of them. Every single one. Now, granted, I've never had ALL of them...but from experience, I think I can say that they serve some dame rockin cheesecake. They also serve some other great dishes. I've eaten many different things from the Cheescake Factory and they never seem to disappoint me - EVER. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the bread they serve first and foremost when you get there, and I have always had really decent service. Nothing to jump up and down about, but good service.  Visited the C.F. in the city this last weekend for the 100th time (jk) and had a really great time - EXCEPT  I unfortunately had to help a horrified mother while her son got sick and puked at the table. Now, realistically, everyone should/could have helped this little man, but no...I was the only person to get up from my table, run over and shove a plastic bag under his face. He had been puking into a plastic cup, while his mom was tending to her other, younger child. It was rough. I felt so horrified for her, and she was MORTIFIED! Gold star for me! The sad thing, is that none of the staff came over to help her...I was a little upset about that. Other than all of this, I had a relatively nice experience - luckily, my inner mom (no I'm not a mom yet) kicked in and I was able to help a woman in need. Boo to everyone else who sat on their ass and WATCHED!"
Austin N.,"San Francisco, United States",1120,132,45,4.0,6/9/2008,"Despite many bad reviews on Cheescake Factory, you need to try it yourself. There is a reason why the wait time can range from 5 minutes to 4 hours. Obviously, if you waited 4 hours, there is something good. I've been here around 15 times now, and almost everything is consistent. I say that because, my Miso Salmon was overcooked, undercooked, and perfectly cooked. The service has been consistent throughout all my visits.  When someone orders a burger, I always think.. ""Why come to cheesecake factory and have a burger."" Seriously, unless you're getting a kobe beef burger, otherwise Jack in the Box is down the street. Anyways, my current favorite dish that's a must try is the Chicken Madeira. It's absolutely delicious and flawless. If you want some steak, combine it with the Steak Diane for $20.  All in all, I love this place and it's a treat to always come here. The restaurant's atmosphere is very nice and pleasing. Good place to bring a date or even friends. It's a relaxed atmosphere with a hint of sophistication."
Heather I.,"Spokane, United States",0,39,,4.0,29/8/2008,"Ok, so it's a chain restaurant, which I try to avoid in SF, but I love the location of this Cheesecake. It is fun sitting out on the balcony, even if it's a foggy night (the heat lamps work great). Perfect spot to take tourist friends, even if only for dessert. My favorites are Adam's peanut butter and the Oreo cheesecakes....yum! Also, their crispy chicken tenders are yummy. Expect quite a wait; never been there when it wasn't chaos."
Vincent B.,"San Francisco, United States",14,62,3,4.0,29/8/2008,"I've had some inconsistent experiences coming to CF. Sometimes the service is great ... and sometimes, well ... just be prepared to play the waiting game. But one thing I've always enjoyed are their plates. I'm not a big fan of giant portions, but eh, why not? ... it's still pretty good so just take it home if you can't finish it.  Yes, it's not the best restaurant in town and YES the wait is incredible, but who cares?! Just eat."
Andrew T.,"Rome, Italy",381,441,11,4.0,23/8/2008,"i actually despise cheesecake but i LOVE the pasta's here. its a great location and there is not much better in the city than eating good food outside over-looking union square about 20 stories up. the wait is definately long, but what do you expect for a chain restaurant in union square? the good thing is they give you a beeper, that has a pretty good range(you can go shopping at macys and still feel it vibrate). i love coming here for lunch when they have $7.95 lunch portion pasta's(still a big portion). definately a fave of mine"
Marvin J.,"Brentwood, United States",65,110,83,4.0,10/8/2008,"Hey, I happen to LIKE the Cheesecake factory.   Yeah, it's a little overpriced, but some of the quality, and quantity, of the food is pretty darn amazing. This also happens to be a great spot to stop and rest the dogs after a full day of shopping (which a friend and I did - see pics). We ordered a side of fries and the Fire Roasted Artichoke.....hella good! I also had.....haha...of course!  Alcohol!  Trust me - don't walk into the Factory with expectations....the view, food, price.....and you'll have a great time."
Lisa B.,"San Francisco, United States",47,103,23,4.0,8/8/2008,"I had one of those shop-til-you drop kind of days, (not really, I only was shopping for lingere for a boudoir photo-session, but I""m not your typical girl, with tons of shopping stamina...I'd rather just never have to shop again, ever) I stopped in for a bite to eat here, and was surprised and disappointed at times, enough to merit 4 stars (I contemplated giving it 3, but the cheesecake was so damned good.) I was put off by the fact that they double booked our table.  When our pager went off (after twenty minutes, not the ten we had been promised) by the time she walked us over to the talbe, there was another couple sitting at it.  So we had to wait another ten or 15 minutes, and we were sat outside. It was foggy and sort of chilly outside, but it was really loud inside, so I didn't mnd.  Outside, there were heaters to heat the outside.  (I'm contemplating taking another star off for lack of ecology and heating the great outdoors) We ordered a Ravenwood Zin and the waiter obviously didn't know how to uncork a bottle, went through the cork, so there were bits, in my wine.  He offered to get another bottle, but when I looked at the cork, this wasn't the bottle's fault, and he would just do it to another bottle...so I just asked for a fresh glass, hoping all the cork was in the first pour. The hamburgers were overpriced and a bit bland, certainly nothing that would bring me back. But the cheesecake was delicious.  The decaf coffee was essentially tasteless and very thin and weak...like water had been added...nothing I'd get again, either. So, 3 or 4 stars...I dunno...perhaps 3.5 would be adequate."
sibani b.,"West Covina, United States",128,228,,4.0,8/8/2008,"On the top of the Macy's department store, this Cheesecake Factory location has outdoor seating that allows a view of Union Square (which is over-rated, but whatever) under heat lamps. It can get really windy in their outdoor section. They need more heat lamps, but it is too crowded to fit any more. The waits are terrible. They give pagers but they only work on the floor, so people coming out of the elevator that goes directly to the restaurant from the ground floor of Macy's are bombarded with peopleness as soon as they exit. They should offer to telephone people when their tables are ready so at least people can go one floor down and look at boring furniture in Macy's. Once, however, I went on a Sunday late afternoon and only had to wait 20 minutes. For me, that is an eternity; for Cheesecake Factory, that is a miracle. I've already talked about outdoor seating. Indoor seating is fine. The decor is pretty wannabe luxe but it totally works. Sometimes, the music is WAY too loud. I mean, it's Abercrombie loud, and I'm not old, so it really is loud. The last time I went, my hostess was fabulous. She was very bright and cheery. I told her it was the first time I was seated on the east side of the dining area. She welcomed me without a soupçon of patronization. It was great. The waiter was super-busy and I could see various tables of people being less than nice to him, but he was very diligent and had a cool name I can not remember. I could barely hear him say anything under the volume of music, but he was very patient and recommended a great Bellini. Mmm. The spinach dip is always a safe bet. The chicken Madeira, steak Diane and shrimp scampi were all extremely good. The shrimp was battered and fried and too tasty. Of course, the whole purpose of the Cheesecake Factory is to serve cheesecake. The cherry cheesecake is okay. I actually prefer the 6g carb cheesecake. It is yummy enough to satisfy my cheesecake craving but not sinful enough to make me eat the whole shebang. I can't give this place 5 stars because it does not give me the sense that I could develop a personal relationship with it. I like places that feel personal. This place just processes tourists."
Priscilla W.,"San Francisco, United States",242,606,2207,4.0,4/8/2008,"The infamous wait can range anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending what time you go. Make sure when they ask for your name for the wait, give them your last name too. I was almost confused with someone else who was 20 minutes after me. Sometimes the service isn't that great - I asked for a straw, and I never got one... but I don't blame them because this place is so busy! Sometimes they forget to give you bread, and when they finally remember, it's when your main dish has arrived. Defeats the purpose, doesn't it? Their avocado egg rolls is a must! They're so fresh and delicious! They cut it diagonally, so it looks larger. But we all know it actually isn't. Their hot spinach and cheese dip is really good as well, but very filling if you're sharing it with only one person. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich blew me away! (I usually hate eggplant, but it was pretty good here.) Never order salads from here, they're never worth it. But other than that, I've been satisfied with every order I had (mainly, pastas). I only eat here for special occasions, such as birthdays and graduations. The inside is lovely, and outside gets you a great view. However, I wouldn't recommend sitting outside because San Francisco weather is unpredictable. If you do decide to eat outside, beware of that idiot sitting one table over who is feeding the pigeons - his food on the floor may be the pigeon's sh*t on your table or possibly on your food. There's also smokers who are unbelievably inconsiderate of the people who are sitting down and eating."
Ken G.,"San Francisco, United States",413,1652,37,4.0,4/8/2008,"Okay...I'll start off by saying that chain restaurants are usually not my thing.  They usually have predictable menus and pretty bland food and people who don't really want to work there. What Cheesecake Factory does that is so different from everyone else is that they try to please everybody, which is perfect for families.  Anyone who's seen their menu notices the 30-40 different entree's available to order - considering they also go across a range of cuisine from Native American, to Thai, to Mexican, to Italian, they do a decent job of making everything taste pretty good.   What they really excel at, however, are the burgers and salads - they give you huge portions and they make everything taste so impressive. The burgers come in a range of choices, but no matter which one is ordered, they are all juicy and full of flavor (the kobe beef is impressive!).  The salads are great since they give you a hefty portion of something that usually doesn't fill you up very well.  Salads such as the BBQ chicken or Chinese chicken are full of flavor and very healthy - it's a great way to eat out, have a good, flavorful meal, but not worry about too many calories/fat in your diet. Of course, the best things at Cheesecake Factory are the cheesecakes - absolutely amazing!  Whether you like fruit, chocolate or coffee, they have something for everyone.  They even have good desserts that aren't cheesecakes.  My personal favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake - a flourless dark chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, chocolate cheesecake and a dark chocolate ganache - how can you not like this?!?!? In short, I'm strangely impressed by this place...my advice is to stick to the following: -Salads -Burgers -Cheesecake Anything outside of these items can be hit or miss. BTW, try to plan accordingly when you go...there's ALWAYS at least a 45 minute wait to get in."
Lindsay S.,"Athens, United States",73,282,26,4.0,3/8/2008,I am in love with this particular Cheesecake Factory's location.  After riding the elevator up to the extravagantly decorated restaurant we enjoyed drinks (my favorite is the banana daquiri) and delcious food on the terrace overlooking Union Square.  The view is absolutely gorgeous and the food is great.  My favorite is the California Cheesesteak.  I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake so I can't review that part but I hear the Oreo cheesecake is to die for.
Kira G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,4.0,30/7/2008,"I know, I know.  Chain restaurants aren't haute cuisine, but every once in awhile I love going there for some avocado rolls and cheesecake. And the portions are HUGE!"
Jason A.,"San Jose, United States",443,335,954,4.0,30/7/2008,"It took me 4 to 5 dine-in's at Cheesecake Factory to realize that the only thing worth the price is the complimentary bread and Burger/Sandwich Specialty Menu. Any other pasta dish or salad entree is a flat-out ripoff (yeah, I said it!) CF's glorified Double-Double, or ""TONS OF FUN BURGER"" as they call here, was more than enough to hold me over for the 4-hour+ shopping spree my family & i had in Union Square. Sitting on top of Macy complex, you get a great view of the square off the restaurant's terrace. Hosts/Hostesses at the front desk were very accommodating for our party of 18, not to mention a very friendly & quick-service waitress. Amber, I think was her name; she had a lot of cheerleader qualities from what I remember, but who remembers their server's name anyway? Nevertheless, the cheeriness made the dining experience much more entertaining for the kids' table. Parents took care of the bill which left our wallets untouched for the shops on Powell and Post. Great day. Have at it if you don't mind the crowded Macy's elevator or high escalator scale."
Green Mango Y.,"San Francisco, United States",57,103,34,4.0,30/7/2008,"I like this place. Even though this is a big chain and commercialized and all,  the deck is always great. Service is pretty good and clean. They have a great selection of appetizers or lunch or dinner.  I just found out they have great menu for brunch on Sunday. That will be my next visit!  It is too bad that we have to wait long time and their buzzer doesn't work other floors in Macy's to kill time anymore like it used to be.  It's great for casual dates, with group of people (though they don't take reservation so it will be hard to have more than 4people, I imagine)"
Elena N.,"San Francisco, United States",1406,2423,10560,4.0,28/7/2008,"This is one of my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations.  It's on top of Macy's so it's got a great view of Union Square.  The wait at this location can suck from time to time.  I'd say on average, I've had to wait 45 minutes.  If you can, sit at a table by the bar.  They have the same menu and you don't have to wait.  I love the grey goose martinis here and last time, I got the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls.  They were so good!  And of course you have to try the cheesecake!  Just remember the portion is big so you many want to share with a friend."
Lily X.,"San Francisco, United States",0,88,2,4.0,27/7/2008,"Ok sooo... BFF day was today and we had trouble choosing a restaurant... we picked restaurants out of a hat and Cheesecake Factory it was!.... We got there and it was an extremely long wait...  But we did get our seats within 30 minutes... So waiting on the side for a waitress to lead us in..., one of them steps on my feet by accident really hard and says nothing! I mean can i at least get an apology? so we get to our table and then the waitress was really nice... Sure, sometimes it was hard to get her help, buttttt, she always came to make sure everything was going smooth and she knew what we wanted without us having to ask for it.   The spicy cajun pasta was alright... not as spicy as i had hoped for, but it was alright..  The oreo cheesecake was pretty good.. very sweet.. but good....  and the frozen ice mango drink was really good.... :] Other than the wait and the foot stepping, this experience was pretty good. if you have time and you want some not bad food, go to cheesecake factory. -x3 shells"
Peter T.,"San Diego, United States",302,835,382,4.0,22/7/2008,"My ex-girlfriend LOVED this place. The food is pretty damn good considering its price. 20 dollars will get you the Steak Diane. Filet medallions with some sort of gravy with shitake mushrooms with some mega soft mashed potatoes. For the same price, you can lessen the steak portion and add a 6- something ounce salmon filet. The salmon is rubbed in herbs and is slightly undercooked which i find to be a glaring strong point in fish. Two drawbacks. Service and wait-time. Even on a monday afternoon around 2-3 you will find yourself waiting 20 minutes for a table, and on  weekends? You'll be lucky to wait less than an hour and a half. Worth the wait? Maybe if you are visiting out of town.  As for the service? similar to hard rock cafes. Hardcore corporate. The service staff is very friendly, but i sense that they feel over worked and that they are under a lot of stress due to the  management and corporate. I have attended this particular Cheesecake the better part of a dozen times, and only once have i had a personable conversation with a server. For the most part, they walk around with a corporate smile, and give corporate service. I feel so bad for them! Treat your employees better cheese cake, then you'll get that fifth, and well earned star."
Kristin Y.,"Brooklyn, United States",163,275,1,4.0,19/7/2008,"i give the cheese four stars for food.... service can tend to be hit or miss; but the food always pleases me! went for lunch on friday and was thinking that since it was going to be a table for five we would have a 30 minute wait! HAZAH...they were able to sit us in a nice big booth in the back immediately. i ended up gorging myself on pot stickers, quesadilla and then some apple turtle somethin somethin cheesecake! i had originally wanted the tres leche, but they were out. no worries i was still able to inhale my cheesecake regardless. uhhh... i should have asked my work husband to carry me..i mean roll me out. the only thing about the cheese is that it is no in and out quickly endeavour. we sat down at 12; walked out at 2. lucky for me i had taken the rest of the day off to go shopping, but my friends had to go back to work. suckas! :p"
