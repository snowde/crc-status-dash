Arkady G.,"Tujunga, CA",2,28,8,2.0,12/24/2017,"Came on vacation for the holidays, couldn't even enjoy a normal lunch. Food and side items came separately, manager his name is David did not work to help us out to make our stay for lunch better. I do not recommend this location cheesecake factory has great food, asked for this location terrible service and they were not willing to work with"
Leslie D.,"Fowler, CA",4,18,6,5.0,7/31/2017,"We are from a town about 3 hours from San Francisco.  We have eaten here at least a dozen times in the last 10 years, and have never had a bad experience at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory.  Wonderful service, beautiful view, and excellent food.  I had the breakfast burrito (first time to have that here)- and I couldn't help it, I said out loud to my hubby ""this is F'in delicious!"" I ate the entire ginormous burrito, and didn't have room for cheesecake - on National Cheesecake Day... Definitely a ""recommend"" place to eat!"
Amy V.,"San Francisco, CA",515,167,47,2.0,6/30/2016,"Long wait even around 5:30pm. They should have came up with a solution by now... If it is always so busy like this... Boo. The chicken quesadillas were not worth it! Instead of putting a bunch of salsa and sour cream on the side, maybe they should've added more quesadillas. They were 4 for $12.50.  The crab and artichoke dip is a must try tho! Buffalo chicken wings were really flavorful tho. I realized I said ""tho"" twice...whatever tho"
Joy P.,"Toronto, Canada",172,42,145,3.0,12/19/2016,"My friend and I were walking around Union Square to find a place to eat Sunday brunch at. Unfortunately, all the top places we Yelped had a long line up, so we opted for The Cheesecake Factory. I was pretty excited considering the fact that there's none in Canada. The restaurant is at the top floor of the shopping centre and you have to take an elevator to go up. Luckily, they had plenty of seats and the view was incredible! We would've sat at the outside patio but it was raining before so all the tables and seats were wet.  I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict, because I actually had this at a restaurant in New York (called Friedman's, check out my other review) so I wanted to see how it compared to the Cheesecake Factory. I was really surprised when it came out because it wasn't what I expected. Rather than pieces of fried chicken, it was chicken strips which really lowered my expectations. The side of potatoes were a really nice touch, and they weren't salty which I liked. The creaminess of the poached egg and hollandaise sauce was a really nice balance to the saltiness of the chicken strips. My friend ordered the Bruleed French Toast, and HOLY this thing was huge. It's not like your regular french toast, it was more like french baguette...Unlike a baguette though, these wee INCREDIBLY soft and fluffy. I highly recommend this! For dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake and this was delicious. I loved the big dollop of whip cream and the amount of details put into this slice."
Kat V.,"Redding, CA",0,15,4,2.0,1/8/2018,"It was an extremely busy night and the wait was 2 hours. They give you a ticket and tell you to report - only to give you a beeper so, they aren't really being honest about how long it takes. We had 2 kids so it was extra long for them.  Finally got seated and the waitress brought drinks. That was messed up - they brought the wrong drink for the youngest (who wanted tea but ended up with water).  While that was happening - I noticed my silverware was dirty (stuck on dried food) so everyone checked theirs and we came up with 3 dirty forks out of 6 and 2 knives. That's when we noticed that the table settings were incomplete and possibly someone had high-graded the settings (no napkins, no spoons, etc). We pointed out to the waitress and she reported it to the manager and brought all new place settings (good job here).  We ordered and after about 20 minutes, a guy walked up (did not introduce himself) to tell us there were no meatballs for my HB's spaghetti and did he want something else (causing more delays). at this time - we again complained about the dirty silverware. This guy seemed unimpressed and brushed us off to hustle away. When the waitress returned, we asked who the other person was and she said he was the Assistant Manager.  All-in-all, the food was good but the problems with the wait, silverware, and running out of food made this a bad experience.  At the end of the meal, we sort of expected some kind of discount on a drink or a meal but - when no concessions were made - my son got very angry and asked to see the manager.  Another long wait and some OTHER guy came over. He must have been the sacrificial lamb as he was NOT the manager or assistant.  He was nice enough but my son told him why we were upset.  We did say that it was not the waitresses fault in general.   SO - my advice is to wander up there for the view and then go somewhere else for food."
Ryan M.,"Cameron Park, CA",11,155,62,2.0,7/17/2017,The two stars are for the restaurant being on the seventh floor of the Macy's building and the outstanding patio views. The lack of any more stars is solely due to poor customer service. We were seated on the patio and not visited by our waitress for about 10 minutes. It was 90° and we were not offered water. We received water after we received our beverage order which was 10 minutes too late. Our waitress end up having a little bit of an attitude so we requested to speak to the manager. Sergio was very attentive and apologetic even offering us free dessert.  However I'm afraid he missed the mark. Dining is all about service. I will say he did circle back with us later to see how our meal was (my pineapple chicken dish was dry and my ladies rigatoni was not very tasty). That said we did turn down a free dessert in an effort to just leave. What a restaurant as big and busy as the cheesecake factory does not realize is they will not see us as a customer again.   There was also a customer at the table across from us who ended up leaving because he had to wait too long to get a drink and food order in.  This lunch experience did put a slight damper on our day in San Francisco.
Rachelle Y.,"San Francisco, CA",485,113,86,4.0,11/28/2016,"The usual spot to take all your friends visiting SF. It's in the heart of city, located inside Macy's on the top floor. As cheesy as that sounds, the menu is filled with your all-American generic food options with some variation. You can never go wrong with pasta, burgers, etc.  This place is pretty well known for their ""brown"" bread which is actually rye bread. Load up on some carbs prior to your entree, and you will have no room for cheesecake. Eat with caution.  Since their menu is ridiculously long and extensive, here are some common entree's I like to order in rotation: - Miso Salmon: a fat, juicy, teriyaki based filet of salmon resting on a bed of brown rice, surrounded by snow peas and miso sauce.  - Louisiana Chicken Pasta: a huge portion of bow tie pasta with a cajun kick of flavor, with crispy chicken tenders on top - Avocado Egg rolls: this appetizer can fill me up. Each egg roll is filled with a bite of soft avocado and can be dipped in a tangy tamarind sauce.  Mind you, all these portions are HUGE. They really emphasize on family style portions.  In terms of dessert, how can you visit the Cheesecake Factory without having cheesecake? It would be a sin not to share a slice. My personal favorites are: - The 30th Anniversary: CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH FUDGE AND CHEESECAKE. C'mon.. It's the best of both worlds. - White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: It has a little fruit in it so it HAS to be a little healthy.. Ammiright?!  I refuse to try any other cheesecake. I'm loyal to my soil. Wait time can be long, just because it's located in the middle of Union Square. Enjoy the seating outside, and bask in the SF weather. The Cheesecake Factory will always have a special place in my heart."
tammy z.,"Los Altos, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Aside from what others have said about food being served cold and of poor quality, my feet stuck to floor as if a previous occupant had spilled a drink and it was never cleaned up."
Greg C.,"Castle Rock, WA",4,27,6,4.0,6/14/2017,"I get teased a bit for going somewhere and eating at a chain restaurant, rather than a local place. I lived an hour from any chain restaurants (other than a Red Lobster -- disgusting) so that's why I had that mentality. Now that I live in the Bay Area, I have plenty of options and am trying local places more often. When I went into The City two days ago, however, I did meet up with a friend for lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.  This location is really cool, in my opinion, and the two times I've eaten here, I ate outside overlooking Union Square -- great views from up there on either side of the Macy's sign (no, literally!).  I ordered the Georgia Peach cocktail, as recommended by the server when I asked, and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (also recommended when asked). Both were absolutely delicious. ZERO regrets. I am a big guy, I hadn't eaten breakfast, and wasn't eating lunch here until after 1 PM. I ordered the lunch sized pasta and STILL had leftovers to take home. That brown bread (What IS that bread? There's a debate online, and there's too many different answers!) may be the best thing here, honestly. That's not meant as an insult, but I've never tasted a better bread in my life.  My complaints here are as follows: the staff at the check in counter. They are a little ""gossipy"" and are clearly discussing others in whispered voices, looking around, and then giggling about it. That doesn't make one comfortable and is quite unprofessional. The other complaint/issue (and it's not even the fault of The Cheesecake Factory) is that if you sit outside, there will be birds flying VERY close to you/around you often. They also walk all over the tables and eat at the food left behind by customers. It just seems a little bothersome and unsanitary. However, I did ask to sit outside."
Crystella FaFa Z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,6,5.0,6/4/2017,"As usual, it is full of people awaiting in the queue for being seated even if just 5.30pm. If for sitting outdoor, it would be taking 15 more mins. Very typical American restaurants with consistent good quality good and services as I had before. Recommended!"
Jean D.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,22,,1.0,11/17/2017,"You will wait 90 minutes for table, your thing buzzes, and then you will Wait another 45 minutes. Get it together you guys, I won't ever be back! Update...still Here. NEVER EVER Also- 22 min line to get in the elevation to get OUT of this shit show.  Angry staff yelling instructions about elevator rules. Horrible horrible place. Anyone with anxiety, don't come Here or die."
K F.,"Detroit, MI",0,83,,2.0,7/11/2017,"Food: The food was good and there is a wide selection. Rating: Four stars Service: The service was slow, half-hearted, and unattentive. Rating: One star Atmosphere: The silverware and glasses had some residue.  The atmosphere depends on where you are seated.  In the rear, the restaurant is mainly functional.  Overall, this location was underwhelming. Rating: Two stars Location: The downtown location is great for people visiting Union Square. Rating: Four stars"
Cissy W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/23/2017,NO REPLY FROM YOUR WEBSITE AND RESTAURANT. how can you overcharge your customer by FALSIFYING TIP? you are breaking law to make money now???!!!! that is low and sneaky! i took couple friends to have dinner last month. i found out cheesecake factory OVERCHARDE us $20 dollars. and no one take responsible for this! even their manager!
Mike O.,"Daly City, CA",22,115,43,4.0,5/18/2017,"Came in tonight for dinner before watching a movie with my friend. Got here around 6, got seated right away. I'm pretty used to the long waits here on a Friday night, but nothing today. Got seated, and our server asked for our drinks, I just asked for water, my friend got iced tea which came out extremely quickly. We took a while to look through the menu because there's so much selection and a lot of new and not so new stuff since the last time we were here. It's funny how the calorie count is so high on most of the dishes, but if you've been to The Cheesecake Factory before you know it's because of the pure size of the dish. Ordered the calamari for appetizer and we both got the shrimp scampi with the steak Diane. Food came out fairly quickly and tasted pretty good. I would have actually gotten something bigger, but I didn't want to take leftovers into the theater after. It was the right amount of food and I was too full to order dessert. I don't think I made it to dessert the last several times I've been here because I'm so full from the entree. The cheesecake here is amazing, but I don't know if I'll ever get to have one again because I'm always stuffed from the entree. It's nice to know that I can get seated rather quickly on a regular weeknight. I'll be back again and again."
Anil R.,"Oakland, CA",59,63,7,2.0,8/4/2017,"The cheesecake club was going up on a Tuesday night at before 8pm.  Service: took too long to greet us. Apps came out timely, entree took almost an hour.  Finally brought entree and chicken was cold. Biggest pet peeve. Manager came out and gave a half hearted excuse. Anyways great portions as always but didn't have an appetite to eat anymore.  I see why the ratings are low."
Lisa W.,"San Francisco, CA",106,183,1089,3.0,5/21/2017,"I only been to the The Cheesecake Factory once at the Hillsdale location instead. My friend and I wanted pasta so we opted to come here on a Saturday night. It's around 6:30, union square so it's fair we wait an hour bc of how busy it can get. I know it's really hectic to get everyone's plates out in time due to how overwhelmed it was. We were told a 40 minute wait but got seated 1-1 hour and ten minutes later. We quickly ordered bc we were so hangry. We got fried zucchini for starters while my friend chose the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and I got the same thing I got last year, the Cajun jambalaya pasta. Their complementary bread came fast and as soon as we were done with that, our appetizer came. The fried zucchini was amazing. Now I know it might not sound so good, but it was so amazing where I'd say it can curve your tastebuds for chicken nuggets/tenders. After we finished that, our food took super long to come out. Waited at least 30 minutes to come to us only to find out our food has been sitting there. When I tried to dig in to my pasta, I couldn't. The pasta was so dry and hard and the food was lukewarm. Now I'm not the one to complain but if it's something like this, I can't eat it. I let my server Patricia know and she was super calm about it. She quickly apologized in behalf of the kitchen and brought me another one. Except this time, it came out in less than five minutes blazing hot. I'd say 2 star for the food and an extra star for my server. Other than that, I don't recommend Cheesecake Factory. Everything is mediocre and it's overrated."
May Q.,Hong Kong,4,14,89,4.0,5/14/2017,I hate the number about calories but I love the rich ingredient in the cake. What can I do?
Bethtina W.,"Oakland, CA",319,152,65,2.0,11/6/2016,"The food has tremendously gone to hell. It used be a good spot, but they cut so many corners now that the food is crap. We paid six extra dollars for chicken on the garlic noodles. We got one party wing. We ordered a salad with blueberries and they were so soggy that they were unrecognizable. Further, I'm pretty sure broccoli is supposed to be green.  I'm updating my review. I was still in the restaurant when I wrote the first part. Though our server was pretty rude in telling us that broccoli comes that way, a manager, Chris actually agreed the broccoli wasn't right and took it off the bill.  We did have some potato tot sort of thing, that was fried, but good. Overall, stick with the easy things."
Joy W.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",187,441,2629,4.0,5/5/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory at this location is known for its long wait times, balcony view of Union Square, and of course their cheesecake. If you just want to try the cheesecake, skip the wait and just order it to go at the display case. They come in single servings too.  If you do decide to take the elevator to the top floor of Macy's and the escalator to the restaurant for a meal, don't be too deterred by the wait. You can hang out on the beds and couches in Macy's furniture section until your beeper goes off.  The restaurant itself is quite nice with murals and columns. There are lots of booths and a bar inside. The balcony overlooking Geary St. is also a nice way to enjoy a meal.  How about the food? The cheesecake is not bad and the list is extensive, but I'm not a cheesecake lover. The rest of the menu is very overwhelming, as are most chain restaurant menus that aim to have an all-encompassing and somewhat confusing selection.  The last time I dined here, the wait wasn't long at all. It was a very warm day, so the mai tai & the mojito tasted refreshing. The bread was fresh and fluffy.  Seared Tuna Tataki Salad - lightly seared ahi, with avocado, tomato and mixed greens, w/ wasabi vinaigrette: The bright red tuna was seasoned well with sesame seeds seared onto the surface.  Grilled Rib-Eye Steak: It's probably not rib-eye, but it did have beautiful grill marks. It cut well, and was actually pretty juicy. Banana Cream Cheesecake - topped w/ Bavarian cream & bananas: I'm not a cheesecake lover as I usually find it too dense for me, but I do like banana cream desserts. The banana slices and the banana cream were smooth enough to balance out the dense-ness of the cheesecake.  Compared to most chain restaurants or department store restaurants, I think Cheesecake Factory is A-ok. I think the ambience bumps this location up a notch. I admit I never crave a meal from the Cheesecake Factory and none of the dishes really stand out to me, but I do think it is a decent option in this area when the wait isn't too long. Considering the ridiculous wait times, I can't understand why they don't take reservations."
Kevin C.,"Hayward, CA",28,1,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Poor service. Bad management.  We had about a two hour wait period between reserving out table to the time we received our food.  Issues on top of that.  -they tricked us into buying a more expensive menu item. They told us they ran out, but said we could swap it out for another item, which we did, but instead charged us the price of item we swapped for ($20). -i asked for the regular serving version of my salad, they brought me the skinnylicious version. I asked if they could bring me the other because the portion wasn't sufficient. Instead all they did was take it back and put it on another plate.  -complained to management about the bill issue on the swapped food item. He came back to our table, apologized, left the bill, and walked away. Before I could check the bill he was gone, just to realize he didn't do anything about the bill. They also charged me for the regular priced salad, even though they never brought me that one.  I do not recommend this place. The only way I would really return is if I had a gift card."
