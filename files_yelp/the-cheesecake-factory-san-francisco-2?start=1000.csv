Jabez J.,"Oakland, United States",21,115,48,4.0,22/7/2013,"We went to the SF Union Square Cheesecake Factory yesterday, which was a windy Sunday evening.  The restaurant was packed!  There were several tourists milling around.  Some were willing to sit outside on the rooftop because to them the weather was not bad at 55 degrees (SF Style).  For others we wanted an inside seat.  Well after 50 minutes we were seated outside which got colder so we decided that we now wanted to sit inside.  Our host, Kameron Burroughs was definitely accommodating he was able to get us an inside seat within 20 minutes.  Additionally, he got us bread, butter and water to start until our waiter was able to attend to us.   Our food was delicious from the Chicken Madera to the Chicken Samosa, however, the spinach and cheese dip was not flavorful and the chips were stale.  The manager came immediately and remedied the problem because he replaced my dish with another Chicken Samosa and he did not charge us for the 2nd order.  Despite the cold, windy atmosphere, unflavorful dish and long wait it was well worth it.  Oh and BTW our Dulce and Dutch Apple Strussel Cheesecakes were delicious. Highly recommended."
Cindy L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,14,11,4.0,20/6/2013,"Today was my first time at TCF and it was delicious (at least some of it was). FOOD (3/5): I ordered a Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. The noodles were a bit hard and didn't seem ""fully"" cooked or at least cooked to a level where they didn't taste like starch. The sauce was kinda watter-y and not as delicious as I had previously envisioned prior to ordering it. Had a bite of the chicken and wasn't really feeling it. Wasn't the best fettuccine, and way overpriced. Wouldn't order again. The only thing that has me coming back for more is the cheesecake. I've had my fair share of cheesecakes from local bakeries to storebought, and TCF's cheesecake is just AMAZING. I had a caramel de leche cheesecake. It tasted a little bit like heaven. It wasn't too sweet and was very smooth. The whipped cream added an excellent touch and presented the cheesecake in a very elegant way. Although it was a bit pricey for me ($6-7 per slice), it was SO GOOD I'm willing to come back more! AMBIENCE (4/5):  My friends and I did not have to wait at all for seating inside (which was great), however I would recommend others to sit outside as the view is stunning. Wasn't too loud and tables were pretty evenly spaced for me so I didn't feel too confined or stuffed.  SERVICE (4/5): Waiter was very friendly and helpful. Gave us nice suggestions since my friends and I were all first-timers at TCF.  OVERALL: 4/5 I think I'm probably being pretty generous with a 4 star review but I swear for all cheesecake lovers you MUST try TCF. The food wasn't so great for me, but hey I only got pasta so maybe I'll come back and try something new next time and update my review. All in all- good service, nice setting, and mouth watering cheesecake :)"
Mariela D.,"San Francisco, United States",1763,759,2657,3.0,28/9/2010,"Took my sissie Victoria D. here on her birthday. It's become somewhat of a ritual to dine here with my sisters. Chain restaurants don't really need reviews since they tend to offer the same experience. But the SF one stands out simply because of it's amazing view of Union Square. Sure, you'll have to shoo away a hungry seagull or two as they watch you dine from the other side of the glass. You may also have to use your silverware as a paperweight to stop your napkins from getting blown away. And on most days it can be a bit cold, but the heat lamps make it bearable. But if you don't like the outdoors, there's always inside seating - I just can never bear to dine inside when I could be enjoying beautiful views of my bustling city. The HUGE menu can be both a pro and a con. No matter what you're craving, it's likely Cheesecake Factory can fill that craving. It can just be hard to make up your mind. Wait times can also be long, even on weekdays but especially on weekends. On my last visit, I had the fish tacos. They came wrapped with corn tortillas, topped with cabbage, avocado and a special sauce. The fish was crispy and delicious. My sister had the orange chicken and rice. It was crispy with a crunchy orange glaze.  Their menu is consistently good, and so is the service. If you love Cheesecake, this place is a no brainer. I never order any, but I always bring some home for my husband :)"
Becca S.,"San Francisco, United States",10,14,,4.0,18/8/2014,This place is ALWAYS packed. Be ready for a wait and a bit of chaos - lots of families and tourists. Love that they're open late and their take out is pretty quick. Patio seating on a clear day is relaxing; you can see all around downtown and people watch over Union Square Park.
Angela L.,"San Francisco, United States",81,41,39,5.0,8/3/2013,"i always leave this place super full! the servers are always really friendly. I've always LOVE their Louisiana chicken pasta! I went there today at around 3 with my boyfriend and we were able to get the lunch special which ends at 5pm. I was pretty happy that the louisiana chicken pasta is on the lunch special so instead of pay around $16 for it, its only $11.50. The portion that came out was able the same as the original dish so i was pretty happy with it.  The wait on a friday was only 5 mins compare to a weekend which takes an hr or more for a table."
Jess S.,"Hayward, United States",0,10,1,1.0,1/6/2014,Oh cheese cake. I've been here so many times but I've never got the service I received this last time.  On a Wednesday. I was shopping and I was around the corner. Called to ask for wait time and they said 10 mins. Perfect! Made my way up and within 5 mins the wait became 1 hour.  The hostess are extremely rude. I worked in the industry before and I've never had such customer service. I talked to the manager about how rude they were when I was trying to show them my phone that I was just told what I was told two seconds ago  and he didn't care and didn't even apologize.  We made our way over to the bar and i instantly saw 6 kids sitting at the bar area. I've never seen in my life that kids are allowed at the BAR area.  I can keep going about how the service sucked and the waitress didn't do a better job either.  Def not coming here again and not recommending it either! blondies pizza down the street has better service.
Monica H.,"San Jose, United States",927,683,956,2.0,24/8/2013,You just have come to the most touristy Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area. Spare your life. We were with my aunt who is visiting from Asia...  And hell no we took her here for food.. we only wanted to snack on cheesecake after a long shopping day.. There was a 40minute wait for a table at around 4pm. Good thing my smart self found the bar area where it's first come-first served basis. I chatted it up with one of the diners almost done with their meal..saved my spot..and whala.... Got seated in 4 minutes... hailed our server for no menus..just plain cheesecake... ate it..savoured it... and we were out..... Easy.
phil c.,"San Francisco, United States",196,51,9,2.0,18/12/2012,"I can't believe I used to love the cheesecake factory. I guess back when I was broke and used to eating fast food and lower quality chained restaurants I felt like teh CF was one of the 'fancier' places.  I came here yesterday and we ordered the avocado eggrolls I guess they were ok, almost like the frozen eggrolls you get at the supermarket freezer section. Also got the fish n chips (lunch portion) and yeah it was a lot of food. I got a stomach ache after... Also the raspberry lemonade...I believe it had 50% sugar. Not my cup of tea, maybe I'm just getting old. The waiter was adequate though."
Washington D.,"South Reno, Reno, United States",4,101,3,1.0,12/9/2014,"Terrible, terrible, TERRIBLLLLLLLLLE! I was at the front waiting for a table with my friend and had this little girly-boy punk, act out when I was asking for a table. Stating, ""wait your turn!"". I wasn't having a good day and went off on him, which to be honest. I said more than I should and in front of his manager and all his coworkers. Took that stool right under his little small disfigured feet. Manager took him in the back and they both got into a screaming match between him (dummy #1) and his manager. Guess dumb and dumber, finally had a reality check. DONT be rude, I don't take my day out on you unless you act like a jerk. Glad you are fired and life goes on for people who VALUE they're JOBS (SO SHOULD YOU)!!!!!!! Be respectful or don't work in customer service. Where people exist so should a tude adjustement, ship up or ship out!"
Ruthe Ann G.,"El Cerrito, United States",49,193,17,3.0,21/8/2015,"I came here last monday (aug.17th,2015) with some friends that were visiting from Texas. I will say for a monday night it was really crowded!! We called in seeing if we could put our name in or make a reservation, they simply told us we could do neither because they do not do that. We said okay, went there to wait. It was a 45 minute wait for inside and 5-10 for outside. It was pretty chilly out but they promised it would be comfortable because of the heaters they have out there. My friends have a 3 year old and I have to say, it was pretty chilling unless you were right underneath that heater! It wasnt comfortable, so i took a star off that. The food was okay, nothing special at all. THe service was sucky! It took us two hours for 3 meals to get served and eaten. it was a long dinner! Too long especially for a three year old, so i took another star off of that which leave 3/5 stars. I would not necessarily say i would go back but the smores galore cheesecake was good!"
Emily L.,"San Francisco, United States",81,9,1,4.0,11/1/2014,"Crab cakes are worth the normal hour wait time for Friday night dinner. Ordered appetizer crab cakes (3) with mustard and tartar sauce, and tried some Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, and my belly was already 3/4 satisfied.  Portions are larger than you would expect. Overall, I recommend the crab cakes, and if you are into eating numerous amounts of flavorful mushroom and chicken, try the Chicken Marsala. Topped the meal off with Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, which was like a chocolate coffee mousse bomb in your mouth!"
Sebastian P.,"Ceres, United States",1,11,2,3.0,3/8/2014,This place was good. Not the best service lady gave us a mean response at the check in we were there for at least one hour and a half when we were seated the waiters were very nice seem to  be the only  nice workers there. In addition if you sit outside there is a nice view.
Stephanie T.,"San Francisco, United States",130,379,733,3.0,13/9/2011,"I have a love/hate relationship with The Chessecake Factory, I love their food and I hate it's caloric content. The nutrition facts on their menu scares me. On a recent trip at the request of my mother and aunt, I ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and a small mushroom flatbread. The artichokes were cooked to perfection and were served with a delicious balsamic aioli. This was a large appetizer it came with three artichoke halves, I was able to take one home for lunch the next day, it kept really well and was just as good the next day. The mushroom flatbread was the perfect size. It came with wild mushrooms, garlic, shallots, and fresh herbs. It was really good and it was one of their healthier options."
L R.,"San Bruno, United States",0,1,,1.0,29/2/2016,"Horrible, horrible place, poor service we were completely forgotten about had to remind them after 25 minutes we were waiting to be seated and the place  was empty. Our food came out and it looked like it had been thrown together. Complained to the so called manager Juile and she pretty much brushed us off. She was very disrespectful along with the waitress Michelle. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE!! So if your thinking about dining here RUN, you will have a better experience at Mc Donald's, Taco Bell etc.  Yes it was that bad"
Mylinh P.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,,5.0,28/3/2015,"This is a very busy place. The wait is about 90 minutes. However, I was able to get some shopping done at Macy's while the kids and hubby enjoyed the view outside on the balcony. Our waiter is Eric Wong, and he was AWSOME. Always come by with a smile. Very accommodate and professional.  Look for him when you there!  He'll make your 90 minutes wait worth it!!!"
Monique R.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,8,,5.0,3/2/2016,"I called in my order picked it was ready on time, I had the pleasure to be assisted by Norma she was amazing she helped me out as quickly as possible, she saw that I was in a rush and she quickly walked across to the bar area retrieve my drink so that I can get out as quickly as possible. she was courteous and quick she deserves to be acknowledge for being so great with customer service. Thank you Norma for making a difference in my last visit to your location!!"
Tom D.,"Angels Camp, United States",32,25,15,3.0,16/12/2014,"The food and service was really good here,  The drawback is the super long wait.  I do not mind waiting if we can sit or even have a cocktail or beverage to enjoy the time.  The bar and seating is unattainable and it is very challenging to get a chair or table while you wait. It was even impossible to walk to the bar to try to purchase any beverage.  If you like super crowded places and standing around to wait for a table this place is good.  Again I have to say once you sit down the experience is good."
Lamees A.,"San Diego, United States",2,39,,1.0,18/8/2014,Waiting was too long. But if you pay receptionist you will get in earlier than what you think just like in the movies. Very disappointing.
Jessica H.,"San Francisco, United States",131,268,241,2.0,21/1/2013,"This place pisses me off. Really. They always market themselves as a fancy place to have dinner or lunch, and the view overlooking Union Square is nice (if it's not cold and you're not afraid of seagulls and potential attacks). But really now, the wait for a table is ridiculous, and the wait for your food afterwards is equally miserable. And with that, the food is eh. The entire experience from wait until check too about 2.5 hours, with eating only being about half an hour. This does not make me a happy camper. The cheesecake is the real selling point, but its expensive and at that point, you might as well get it to-go and get a bench at Union Square and enjoy it there."
Sandy B.,"Ventura, United States",100,23,17,3.0,19/7/2012,"To be honest the Cheesecake Factory used to be in my top 5 but no longer. Some dishes are still great but some are now terrible.  I have always loved the decoration, though we have had to complain about the service at least half the time in recent visits. Some of the problems. They forgot to put the chicken in a salad, also it is always too noisy."
