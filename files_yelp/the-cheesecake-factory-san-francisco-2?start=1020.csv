Marvin F.,"Reno, United States",3,17,3,1.0,1/1/2015,DO NOT CALL FOR TAKE OUT. This place literally take FOREVER to get back to you. I was put on hold for HALF AN HOUR. I never got a hold of them and so I hung up and decided to get take out someplace else. Never calling them again.
Natasha B.,"Novato, United States",200,2,,1.0,15/2/2016,"My boyfriend and i planned on eating dinner here last night (valentines day) but after waiting 30 minutes to get into the elevator only ro get upstairs to see people were juat waiting to LEAVE. There was absolutely no organization with table seating, no organization with greeting guests NOTHING! I got shuved trying to get out of the elevator by the angey mob trying to leave this shit show. Therw was not one manager in sight. Not ONE! It has always been something i wanted to do on valentines day. Eat outside on the eigth floor of the cheesecake factory. They werent taking reservations or anything. As a server hostess and bartender for the laat 6 years i know how hard it is to run a restaurant that is first come first serve but this was absolutely ridiculous and so chaotic and unorganized. Everyone who i saw leaving was extrenely unhappy. Needless to say we didnt even end uo gettinf a tabke and had to pay $57 in parking to wait at a shitty serviced restaurant we didnt even end up eating atm if youre going to do first come dorst serve on a night like that at least have some organization. So disappointed."
Christine B.,"Sacramento, United States",476,378,223,3.0,14/8/2012,"I would call cheesecake factory a good go to restaurant when you have a group of indecisive people. On a Friday night, my friends and I arrived at 530 for a table for 11. They had us wait 1 hr and 45 minutes, then once we were called we stood around for another 15. Seated at last at 730pm. Then orders were taken half an hour later, food in another half hour and we ere out of there by 1030. Be prepared for a long ordeal and experience when you come here. Don't come in a large group hungry! What I like about cheesecake is the consistency - this cheesecake even if they are packed - they deliver the same consistent food and service as any other packed Cheesecake would. The maximum for outside seating is groups of 6. if you're a large group - you're automatically put inside. ***DO NOT GIVE INTO EATING ALL THE BREAD IF YOU ARE STARVING AFTER TWO HOURS OF WAITING. YOU CAN HOLD ON LONGER SO YOU CAN EAT DINNER!!"
Lauren P.,"San Francisco, United States",32,8,32,4.0,19/1/2014,"View from this location is above par. The lobby ambience is especially worth mentioning, as it has the bustling ambience of a Las Vegas casino. Truly a San Francisco tourist staple. Tuna tartare small bite is also noteworthy."
Stevie D.,"San Francisco, United States",41,99,,5.0,16/1/2014,"See, this is why chain restaurants persist despite the chagrin of many who raise their snooty noses at those who enjoy them (and yes, life-long locals like me love Union Square and chain restaurants--when they're good--despite what townies may tell); The Cheesecake Factory SF offered some excellent service, gave delicious food, and while the prices weren't the greatest, they were relatively cheap for the portion sizes and the amazing view from the 8th floor veranda. I ordered the chicken N' Biscuits, but as soon as I found out it was a broiled chicken cutlet rather than a traditional fried piece, I asked for the change and they did it with a smile, and no argument!  Service was courteous, friendly and kind. Just remember, this place has huge portions and heavy calories, it's not the place for a diet (but then again, you already knew that didn't you)! P.S: The cheesecake really is as good as they say it is."
Phuong V.,"Oakland, United States",1078,405,48,3.0,20/9/2012,"This has got to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory out of all of CF's I have been to. San Francisco just gives you this amazing feeling that you are on vacation. It is located inside of a Macy's which makes it even better. Definitely a touristy area, so be prepared for a wait. The portions here are great, so someone small like me can never finish a whole plate of food. I can eat a third of it and the rest of the 2/3's  are taken home. It kinda sucks because by that time I am so full there is absolutely no room for dessert. Cheesecake is here is amazing, I don't think you can go wrong with any flavor. My favorite is the original with strawberry sauce. It is plain and simple with a hint of tartness from the ripe strawberries. Whenever my friends and I are in the city and we are indecisive with dinner venues, CF is safe choice.  Dishes I recommend.  1. You can't go wrong with any pasta dish 2. Chicken Madera (sp?) 3. Chicken and Dumplings  All very heavy dishes, no wonder I get full so fast!"
Katy D.,"Palo Alto, United States",469,93,224,5.0,23/10/2014,"Cheesecake factory is hands down ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS! I know it's a corporate restaurant so that is why it gets lower stars on reviews. Yes, the wait is ALWAYS long. Always guaranteed an hour wait AT LEAST. But I think it is worth it, espicially in this location because you can see Union Square. I love San Francisco, even though I come here so often, but it NEVER gets old. The holidays are the best times here, even though it does get crowded. Their brown sweet molasses bread is the BEST, and so is the sourdough. I love ALL their pastas. The top pastas for me are: pasta da vinci, Cajun Jambalaya. Another great dish is the Chicken Marsala with Madiera wine sauce which is to die for!! Definitely worth trying, and DO save room for the Red Velvet Cheesecake, the BEST cheesecake I have ever had! Very moist red velvet cake with moist cheesecake and white chocolate pieces on the side. PERFECTION!"
Linda X.,"San Francisco, United States",658,195,35,3.0,11/10/2012,"Four Stars Came here for dessert after a sushi feast. Hot Chocolate and Tuxedo Cheesecake to share! Two Stars The wait is probably horrendous if your party's not down to sit around the bar.  Tips and Fun Facts Round tables near the bar is open-seating! They have really cool to-go cups for your hot drinks (I'm not a noob, they're seriously really cool)."
Robert B.,"Boise, United States",109,151,20,3.0,15/5/2014,Not a big fan of this chain. Went with a group of friends and it was okay. Had the chicken katsu which was about 15 bucks and was good. I'd just rather pay the normal 10 bucks for it at a Hawaiian BBQ place and not deal with the madhouse that the cheesecake factory is. Feels very touristy but they do have quite the selection of desserts. Good for sweets but not my pick for a dinner spot.
Darius B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",261,100,12,3.0,26/5/2014,"Arrived about 90 minutes ago and was told that there would be a 25 minute wait for 2.5 people. I can understand waiting for 10-20 minutes beyond what they quote, but I've been waiting here for over an hour still have not been seated. I would only recommend this spot if you had time to waste and nothing better to do. I would tell you about the food and rest of service once I actually am seated. The food was actually really delicious, I had the Hibachi steak which was tender and juicy. The server was good so I had to bump up a star, but I honestly would not have planned on waiting so long had I known ahead of time about the actual wait."
Mary W.,"Daly City, United States",130,87,544,4.0,21/10/2014,"I have always, always been a fan of the CheeseCake Factory no matter where I am at. I have loved all the food I have tried and been very happy.  I have gone to this one specifically just to get a piece of cheescake to share with my boyfriend and friends. Any flavor is delicious, I recommend trying all their seasonal ones when they come out! Any chocolate with peanut butter ones I love, red velvet, caramel, all of them are BOMB! I can not wait to try their new pumpkin one, hopefully one cheat day I can get a piece to share! I ate here with my boyfriend last week for our anniversary and we got to sit at the bar right away, perks of only having two of us, didnt have to wait, we had the artichoke and  crab dip, yum! I ordered the caesar salad, and it had a little bit of kick, with the perfect amount of dressing, and I choose to add a salmon filet, another DELICIOUS choice! My boyfriend got his typical favorite, chicken billagio pasta, it was also very yummy! If you have a smaller party this is a fun place to go and sit at the bar to watch a game or not have to wait. If you want to wait to sit on the patio, bring a jacket, and smaller parties wont have to wait to long 10-15 min."
linda L.,"San Francisco, United States",231,195,128,5.0,16/9/2010,"This review is only for my take out RED VELVET CHEESE CAKE! yeah, you heard right, i SAID Red Velvet Cheese Cake and it's to die for! For the past few weeks, my girlfriend Christine have been raving about HOW good their red velvet was! OMG had it last night and she is TOTALLY right!  I pre-ordered a 10 inch RVCC to go $56 (not bad right?)... it didnt look that yummy, but boy it looks better than it tastes! The frosting wasnt too sweet, and their cheesecake wasnt over powering at all... in my opinion, it's a perfect balance *heaven* will be back for more :) Oh it's the best red velvet in town! Forget TTTC red velvets, Cheese Cake Factory it is! :)"
Rocio G.,"San Antonio, United States",118,146,64,4.0,19/7/2014,"I mean, you have to know what to expect coming here. Know that it's going to be packed with tourists, that the wait is going to be crazy long, and that your server will be pushed to the limit. Also though, know that there's a great view, the menu has a million choices (and there's a separate kid's menu), and the food is going to taste exactly as you expected. I recommend the herb crusted salmon salad. My husband likes the orange chicken. Baby loves the kid's mac and cheese. If you're in for a wait, hang out at Macy's- lounge in the furniture section or do some shopping. There's a time and place for a SF Cheesecake Factory experience. Just know what you're getting yourself in to."
Rick L.,"Carson City, United States",39,152,218,4.0,27/7/2013,"Good food, we sat on the patio on the roof. It was nice. There was a pigeon getting all the scraps on the floor. The service was a little slow.  But they were busy. We always like the food at these restaurants.  I have never eaten at this location.  It is in Macy's. on the top floor.  Cheese cake is good and the salads are great."
Alvaro H.,"San Francisco, United States",49,3,,5.0,3/9/2014,"I like this place. Everything I tried was good, large sizes and very good views. Recommended. Probably very tourisitic and overcrowded on weekends but it is worth it."
Gabita H.,"Berkeley, United States",4,25,12,1.0,7/1/2015,Here for the view!!! Bad customer  service ... Rude and uninformed staff ... Luckily Zachary was great ... The hostess should not speak badly  about customers in Spanish because some of us do understand ;)
Sasha V.,"Oakland, United States",0,11,11,1.0,1/2/2015,"4 stars for the food & 1 star for the seating/table arrangement. What a coincidence that we were seated in the same exact ridiculously small shitty table(inside restaurant) not the booth, during the past 2 visits we were there after waiting for an hour. I would rather go to the one in walnut creek. While we were having our food, a family of 4 adults & a child were about to be seated at the adjoining table(small tables combined to make a big table). But there was no place to keep the high chair for the baby. Eventually they left the restaurant pissed & without having dinner after waiting for an hour to get the table. Although i love the food here, but i won't be here again."
Totto S.,"Frankfurt, Germany",0,3,,1.0,4/3/2015,The worst service on the planet! Have no understanding how to arrange and organize it. Food is average as well. Cant recommend at all!
Philip C.,"San Francisco, United States",139,280,614,3.0,22/7/2013,"We dropped by for brunch one Saturday.  Our name was taken and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was friendly and took our order quickly.  Our meal came promptly and our server kept our lemonade glasses refilled. My husband had the popcorn shrimp to start and liked it very much. For our main course, he had a shrimp club sandwich while I had a lunch margherita pizza and a green salad.  Both our dishes were very good and plentiful so we took a half of his sandwich and half of my pizza home for a later meal. We also took home a slice of cheesecake apiece and we enjoyed them very much. The prices were a little high and I did not like being seated at a table next to the servers' station because I could hear their chatter as they waited for more customers."
Cammy C.,"Sacramento, United States",424,229,304,2.0,21/12/2010,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times now, and honestly the only thing that keeps me coming back is the ambiance because its on the 8th floor of Macys and you get a nice view of Union Square. First of all, the wait for a table is almost ALWAYS 3+ hours...it doesnt help that the hostesses are rude and terribly inexperienced.  The food of course is like all the other Cheesecake Factories, its hit or miss depending on what you order. This past weekend we ordered 3 dishes and they were all either too salty, too cheesy, or the chicken was dry. And you pay quite a pretty penny for this food! Granted, the portions are fair for the price you pay, so I feel it's only worth it if you are eating with friends so you can order a few things and share. The best part of the meal is always dessert, who goes to Cheesecake Factory and doesn't order cheesecake right? My favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. There's 1700 calories in each slice but worth eveerrryy bite. But I guess that's why its called the ""Cheesecake"" Factory and not the ""Dry Chicken Marsala"" Factory."
