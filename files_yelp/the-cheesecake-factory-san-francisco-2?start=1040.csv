Jim S.,"Burbank, United States",1,73,,3.0,24/8/2014,"The food is good, the ambiance is nice, and the people are friendly.   The one issue I had with dinner was the pressure to increase tips.  There is a rather prominent tipping guideline on the receipt, along with a not-so-subtle ""gratuities not included"" message.  When the waitress dropped off the check, she mentioned ""just so you know, the tip is not included"".  Given that the service was average, I tipped the standard amount.  I think it came to 17%.   On the way out, we ran into our waitress.  She had seen the receipt and was rather upfront about it.  I can't remember the exact words, but something like ""I know you guys aren't from here, but I just want to let you know that tips are normally higher in San Francisco because of the cost of living in the city.  Would you like to make any changes?""  I was practically too dumbfounded to speak.  I mean, I know they rely on tips for income (although California mandates minimum wage PLUS tips for staff) but I tipped the normal amount for service that was decent but nothing special.  My friends, one of whom lives in SF, were equally shocked.   We just got out of there ASAP, and probably won't go back."
Jamie B.,"Mountain View, United States",9,99,,3.0,30/5/2013,"Yes, it's a tourist haven (or tourist hell, depending on the night). Yes, it's a chain. And yes, it's on top of the 2nd largest Macy's in the world. But it's a nice spot to treat a friend to an after-finals dinner, which is just what me and the boyfriend did for our roommate and a friend of his.  In the interests of full disclosure, we let them pick the eatery.  I've been here a few times, usually for celebratory purposes, and I have no specific complaint except that the elevator ride is usually tight quarters and there isn't a lot of standing space around once you put your name in for a table. Hosts and hostesses are perfunctory bordering on rude, but you have to figure that they see lord knows how many people during the course of any given day, and we all know the public can make the saintliest person curse like a sailor. On this particular outing, it was just a 20 minute wait, so our little crew shuffled outside to take in the pretty fantastic view of Union Square at sunset. The bar is also a nice spot to go if you're a small party - if you can snag a table or bar seats, skip the wait and eat there.  We ate outside, which is normally not advised at sunset in SF, due to COLD, but they have heaters in their outdoor patio area. A few ambitious seagulls and pigeons do make it over the plastic partitions protecting patrons from the precipice (go alliteration!) but they are generally well behaved. I noticed a pair of pigeons actually strolling the aisle from table to table.  Got the bread, devoured the bread, love the bread. Now, as most anyone who's visited any TCF knows, portions here are ginormous. I usually get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta because, well...it's a huge plate of noodles with 4 pounded thin and breaded chicken pieces on top. And it's kinda spicy. And delicious. And makes two meals. Boy got a burger (big surprise), roomie got their pork chop, which I have to assume was good since he left nothing on the plate, and he is a small guy! Roomie's friend got fish n chips.  I was good and only ate half of my meal, and I was just hungry enough to want a few bites of cheesecake, so we ordered one slice for the table to share. Opted for the Kahlua coffee chocolate cheesecake. It was just as decadent as it sounds, and three bites was more than enough to slake my sweet tooth.  Service here is typically pretty good, our server was on point and was nice enough to let us know when he went on his dinner break, introducing us to his cover guy. I really do appreciate little touches like that.  So, yeah. There's a bazillion options in this area, most are local, and a lot are better. But this place cranks out a decent meal (and superplus portions) for a decent price. A-ok indeed."
Gerry B.,"Westminster, United States",986,557,569,2.0,22/2/2013,"We were recommended this restaurant by friends , perhaps our expectations were too high , it's not that it wasn't good but we felt a little let down , maybe our choice of food was to blame , maybe because we sat outside when we ask not to I'm not sure , Service was OK without being outstanding same with the food , we didn't go back again during our 2 week stay - I'm sure others have had great experiences here so don't be put off by this review."
T W.,"San Francisco, United States",3,36,,1.0,1/12/2014,"After 2+ hours wait in line and food orders, what we got is terribly made dishes I've have tasted in my life. What happened to you, Cheesecake Factory?"
Ashley T.,"San Francisco, United States",760,408,957,3.0,1/5/2013,"Every time I go to Cheesecake Factory, the menu overwhelms me, so I stuff myself with the amazing molasses bread. I could eat baskets of the slightly sweet bread with the chewy oats on top! I came here again for the first time in a couple years, and the portions were just as big as I remembered. The Skinnylicious chicken pasta was really good, with pieces of juicy grilled chicken and pasta that was cooked to the chewy texture I like. The fresh tomatoes and basil were a nice extra touch too! I also had that rare burger craving, so we tried the Kobe burger which was huge. I loved the caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms on top, which gave it an Asian flavor. The bun was nicely toasted, and the meat was perfectly cooked. Overall, food here is good, but nothing that's particularly extraordinary. Except for the cheesecake! First of all, the variety of cheesecake alone makes me excited. I tried the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake for the first time, and it was chocolate heaven. I loved that it had chocolate cake on the bottom and a layer of mascarpone cheese, which made it less heavy overall (as opposed to having the entire thing be cheesecake). The chocolate cheesecake was perfect with the other two layers. My favorite part was the crust on the back, which was chocolatey and crunchy and perfect!  This is definitely a place to indulge, so wear your loose pants."
Vernon J.,"Oakland, United States",0,8,,5.0,28/1/2016,I and a friend went for dinner and the food is so good! The cheesecakes is excellent. My favorite cakes is the Red Velvet Cheesecake and The Strawberry Cheesecake. I would highly recommended this location or Stoneridge Mall location to eat.
Minh C.,"San Francisco, United States",267,2,,5.0,28/1/2016,Isaac our waiter is awesome. Food is always generous in portions. Went here for my bday. Love the cheesecake selection.
Shan M.,"San Mateo, United States",1,26,13,4.0,26/11/2014,"I really love the food here despite it being on the pricey side. I came here with a friend because I had a $50 gift card. We really enjoyed our experience here being that we sat outside with the amazing union square view. Unfortunately, our waiter kind of sucked because he kept avoiding our table and took forever to give us the check. He was also very obviously annoyed when we kept changing our minds on our orders and i understand that we were being obnoxious as well but he should expect this while working at a full service place. He also made a mistake of charging me something I didn't purchase and took forever again to fix it. Other than that, I loved it here."
Janice V.,"San Francisco, United States",369,600,798,4.0,11/7/2010,"My boyfriend and I love coming here since it is one of our favorite restaurants in the city. I love sitting outside on a sunny day and seeing the view of Union Square which i think is pretty romantic. I think it would be better if it was at night. I usually get an appetizer and a main course but by the time I get my main course I'm already full by their appetizers. It's weird because it takes a lot for me to be full but the Cheesecake Factory already fills me up with their appetizers. It's better if you come here with an empty stomach. I usually get their pastas because I love Italian and it's pretty yummy. My favorite food out of their whole menu is the cheesecake, duh! Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake to be exact. It's seriously to die for. If you love Red Velvet you must get this.  Btw, if you're gonna eat outside please don't be scared of the birds. Every time I sit outside, there's always people that are frighten of them and tend to look around to see if birds are gonna come at them. It's pretty funny looking at them being all cautious. Haha. Those birds only come at empty tables where they can eat the leftovers."
Linnea H.,"Pacifica, United States",73,165,,4.0,15/12/2012,"This was my face when I logged onto Yelp and saw that The Cheesecake Factory had only 3 stars with 1526 reviews- O___O Yeah, there's always a wait. I don't really expect anything else since it's in, essentially, the heart of San Francisco. You know, where the tourists go?  Anyways, my friend and I, or my mom and I, come here when we are not in any hurry and would like to spend the evening in San Francisco. They have outdoor seating so you can enjoy your meal with a great view of Union Square.  When my mom and I went yesterday, it was an hour wait. They called us at exactly 1  hour on the dot. While waiting, we had a glass of wine and went outside to enjoy the view. We were thinking of taking the escalator down to browse Macy's while we waited, but decided against it.  Once we were seated, our waitress was pleasant and the food arrived promptly and was delicious. We were in and out of there quickly since, during our hour wait, we looked at their menus and knew exactly what we wanted by the time we were seated. Seemed like the most logical idea at the time. Overall I had a good experience- like always."
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, United States",78,357,149,4.0,29/3/2011,"Cheesecake factories tend to be consistent. I was visiting SF and went here with a friend for dessert only. Red Velvet + White Chocolate Raspberry cheesecake is a winner. Thing I like about this place is that they give you those ringer things that vibrate when your table is ready. Furthermore, you can take the escalator downstairs and lounge on the couches in the Macy's furniture store as you wait. Amazing view of Union Square outside."
Cheri S.,"San Francisco, United States",179,114,35,3.0,3/5/2013,"I've been to this location multiple times and this place is okay. There's just a ridiculous wait every time. I like how they serve traditional American as well as newer dishes (I always love my meatloaf and potatoes). The bread served at the beginning is hot and delicious. As for their cheesecakes, they have many varieties but I always stick to the original cheesecake. Very rich, very creamy. They're not called Cheesecake Factory for no reason. If you don't want to wait but would still like to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I'd recommend going to another branch, such as the one in San Mateo."
Christian J.,"Stockton, United States",17,28,15,5.0,6/6/2014,"ive been here 3 or 4 times and i have yet to have terrible service like everyone else is saying. service for me has been mainly good and the food for me has been coming out faster than i expected. the food is great especially for the price you pay. i dont recommend eating outside while its cold or windy because even though the heat lamps are on the highest setting, youll barely feel it.  i highly recommend the katsu chicken. my new favorite dish."
Priscilla W.,"San Francisco, United States",242,606,2207,4.0,4/8/2008,"The infamous wait can range anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending what time you go. Make sure when they ask for your name for the wait, give them your last name too. I was almost confused with someone else who was 20 minutes after me. Sometimes the service isn't that great - I asked for a straw, and I never got one... but I don't blame them because this place is so busy! Sometimes they forget to give you bread, and when they finally remember, it's when your main dish has arrived. Defeats the purpose, doesn't it? Their avocado egg rolls is a must! They're so fresh and delicious! They cut it diagonally, so it looks larger. But we all know it actually isn't. Their hot spinach and cheese dip is really good as well, but very filling if you're sharing it with only one person. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich blew me away! (I usually hate eggplant, but it was pretty good here.) Never order salads from here, they're never worth it. But other than that, I've been satisfied with every order I had (mainly, pastas). I only eat here for special occasions, such as birthdays and graduations. The inside is lovely, and outside gets you a great view. However, I wouldn't recommend sitting outside because San Francisco weather is unpredictable. If you do decide to eat outside, beware of that idiot sitting one table over who is feeding the pigeons - his food on the floor may be the pigeon's sh*t on your table or possibly on your food. There's also smokers who are unbelievably inconsiderate of the people who are sitting down and eating."
Joakim A.,"Umeå, Sweden",2,9,,5.0,10/12/2014,"If you like a big bomb of delicious cheesecake- this is the place. Go here hungry, and leave full of energy!"
S B.,"San Mateo, United States",1,7,,5.0,7/7/2015,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in a while because I am not usually impressed with the food or service, however I received a gift card and decided to go for it. This particular location was fantastic! The view was amazing and the service was wonderful- both at the bar and at our table. Our server Michael was very helpful and did a great job being attentive even though he was busy. The food was also well done! We ordered a few things to share off the skinnylicious menu and they were fabulous. I will definitely be returning!"
Alex T.,"San Mateo, United States",1,16,,4.0,8/12/2014,"For some reason, the miso salmon in this location just tastes better than other three locations I have been to. So,I will stick to this one for a while. My wife once ordered the fresh spring roll, which was just so so. But, come on, this is not a Vietnamese restaurant anyway.  Definitely recommend it"
Rosie W.,"San Jose, United States",381,448,268,3.0,17/5/2012,"One of my favorite Cheesecakes Factory's. I rarely ever come here because it's always packed and I'm never in the mood to wait a couple of hours to eat. But every so often, I'll come here with an out of town friend. It's a neat location - located at the top floor of downtown sf Macy's. There's an outdoor section that overseas Union Square. They give you these page devices that have a pretty big range so you can shop around in Macy's until it goes off. On a nice day, it's cool to sit outside in the outdoor patio, but most of the time its cold and windy (but they have heated lamps!)"
Nina W.,"Walnut Creek, United States",24,6,6,5.0,16/9/2013,"So good as always, although we had to wait 20 min while there were tables free, it shows they didnt have enough waiters or waitress. Asian chicken salad was awesome but u should ask for much more dressing. slider was so good too, it is in appetizers, but that is a big dish."
Linda J.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, United States",11,61,,4.0,4/12/2014,"Had a nice lunch here in the Macy's location. The location is great and the restaurant is decorated nicely. A great place to watch the annual Christmas Tree lighting in Union Square.  We both ordered from  the ""skinny menu"". and were very pleased. My husband had the  Mexican Tortilla salad-it was huge and filled with many things and delicious! I had the three soft chicken tacos with veggie salad and that also, was amazing. We will certainly stop at Cheesecake Factory  again. Prices were reasonable too."
