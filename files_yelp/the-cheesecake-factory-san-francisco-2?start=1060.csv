Judy K.,"Carmichael, United States",0,105,,2.0,27/12/2014,"4 hour wait for a table!   This place is ridiculous!  I love to eat here, it's my favorite location, but 4 hours is way too long. Need for people to put in reservations.  Also need to take names for parties on lower level.  Wrong to trapes all the way up, and make my way to counter to find out the wait is 4 hours."
Corey Tess T.,"Anaheim, United States",752,647,636,4.0,10/5/2010,"You know when I think of this chain I am really uninspired, but they do have a HUGE menu. The chain itself is a great place to take a large group - or even a small group of people who all want something different. They have Mexican, Chinese, Salads, Roast Beef, you name it, they have something you want.. Now THIS particular Cheesecake is located at the top of the Macy's bldg and sports an awesome view! When in San Fran, I would usually never do a chain, but the view here really makes a difference, so wait for it! Good Mojitos!"
Nat ..,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,1.0,20/4/2016,Make sure you bring your own to toilet paper when coming to this restaurant. Literally all the stalls in the women's restroom had no toilet paper. I really needed to use the restroom and I had to go out of my way just to ask for toilet paper. Some lady at the cheesecake section kindly went out of her way and her job description to get me toilet paper. I asked to speak to the manager regarding this issue do you think she cared? Of course not all she did was apologize. That wasn't enough for me when I have to go out of my way searching for some damn toilet paper as if I was at a damn department store. Like seriously shitty service except for the lady who helped and got me toilet paper. Oh wait and it doesn't end there when I was using the restroom everyone was complaining how there was no toilet paper so I passed the toilet paper along as if we were in summer camp or something. It wasn't until 10 minutes later they decided to bring to restock on toilet paper!!
Vin Z.,"New York, United States",0,60,43,3.0,24/12/2014,The food is always good. Miss the wasabi tuna entree. The wait is always long & the bar area is not large enough to accommodate the large crowds & long wait. Hopefully bathrooms are cleaner tonite than usual.
Mia C.,"Orangevale, United States",41,858,533,4.0,23/8/2014,Best Cheesecake Factory  I've ever been to. They are located on the roof of the Macy's building in Union Square.  The view from here is amazing. We went there for a late night dinner after 9pm and left happy. Of course I loved the cheesecakes for which they are famous for. The pastas we tried were delicious.
Christina L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,5,,1.0,23/12/2014,"Consistent with all other poor reviews - this is for the service.  Food is decent, but be prepared to wait an inordinate amount of time!  Also, do not kid yourself into thinking you will have any better luck ordering to-go.  As a local I have tried both dine-in and take-out multiple times, each time optimistic, every time met with epic failure.  Even for phone ahead orders for a pre-made frozen cheesecake I had to wait AN HOUR.  Seriously?! When inquiring about the wait, I was told they were ""understaffed"" and ""had to go all the way to the freezer to get the cake"" uhmmm...either your freezer is next door you're not considering your answer before providing it.  Sorry, good food of not, there is no excuse for this type of service, especially not after such a long wait!"
David G.,"San Francisco, United States",2,13,1,1.0,9/4/2014,Who likes to ice skate? If you do this is the perfect place for you. The floors are so amazingly greasy that if your not wearing non slips its like ice skating. All of their food was either frozen or from a can im 100 percent  sure of it. restaurants like this are whats wrong with American cuisine. Literally i paid 20 dollars for some cheap noodles with canned tomatoes. If only people knew what real food tasted like in this country more people would be able to tell. Any body who's given this place more than two stars doesn't know how to tell the difference between  canned and frozen food and fresh food period.
Sin-Yaw W.,"San Jose, United States",78,608,104,4.0,19/12/2010,"If you come to San Francisco and its Union Square, you need to visit Cheesecake Factory on top of the Macy building.  Find a table outside on the balcony that overlook Union Square.  This is the best vantage point. Of course, the foods are good.  I had a beer and my company ordered cheesecakes.  All other tables came large portions of foods that are decadent yet artery clogging. But that's not the point.  Where would you lunch with a seagull next to you, but safely behind a glass wall?   The bird would touch you if it weren't for the glass. They ran out of pumpkin cheesecake though.  Oh well..."
Ryan M.,"San Leandro, United States",441,35,3,4.0,3/6/2013,"If it wasn't for the friendliness of the hosts and the deliciousness of the food and cheesecake, this place would be getting a much lower score. Honestly, the wait isn't really worth it. My party of 8 had to wait over 2 hours for a seat. (We went around 5:45.) I mean I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the wait is just ridiculous. It might've been just our big party because the few times I went before our party had 2 people. (They told us the wait would be an hour and a half, but we just waited half an hour. So I hoped it'd happen this time! But it didn't sadly.)  On to the food. I had the Hibachi steak. I wasn't really sure what it was, but I trusted the Factory. The steak was already cut up (I like to actually cut my own steaks) and was marinated a lot with their sauce. It tasted great. The sauce was awesome too. My friends couldn't finish their plates so I just dipped their food into my left over sauce and it was delicious!  I shared a tiramisu cheesecake. I normally don't eat tiramisu just because I don't like the taste. But for some reason mixing it into a cheesecake makes it that much better.  I'd recommend this place, but if you don't want to eat at 9:30, come around 5 or 5:30. Get here early or you're having a late dinner."
T L.,"San Francisco, United States",761,1357,5244,4.0,29/3/2010,"(See pics) More of 3.7 stars. So I have been here many times and always like to joke about the CCF elevator where each floor it shows a picture of the dishes. Instead of the pictures, they should have 700 calories, 1000, 1200, etc. until they hit the top floor and say bingo, 2000 calories!! Anyway, a group of us finally hit here for late night cheesecake desserts, my first time here to have cheesecake! I had the Tiramisu cheesecake because I love everything Italian, or at least resemble Italian. It turned out to be really good. I had the more bubbles than syrup coke, perfect chaser to the sugar. I tried a few bites from my friends' dishes and they were overall good, with loads of whipped cream like they own a whipped cream factory.. This neighborhood really needs more dessert places that open late, maybe an Asian one, than just bars. The forever wait is what keeps it from getting more than 4 stars."
Bert K.,"Mountain View, United States",61,1206,,3.0,7/2/2011,"On a sunday night 7pm, we took a chance and rode the elevator to floor 8. It was not crowded nor noisy (it's Sunday evening) and many patrons, as usual, looked satisfied and having a good time. It was a gorgeous, balmy San Francisco warm evening: the lights in Union Square twinkled and the stars beckoned us to dine outside : we gladly obliged and requested patio dining.  The attendant said it  would be about twenty minutes. After twenty minutes, we were seated as promised: outside, cozily right up to the window. We had a fabulous view of Union Square and a quarter moon shone high up in the night sky as if to wink !  the city lights twinkled and invited us to gaze out and enjoy the warm Indian Summer like breeze.  Kudo's for the Mark West Pinot Noir : it smelled of sweet berries and it's body was light as was it's tannins. We ordered the French Country Salad and the Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimps. To get you started a basket of warm bread with butter is brought to you: both white and a tastey brown bread. The French Country Salad was large and full of very fresh lettuce and only a few pieces of grilled asparagus and avovado :(  the dressing was fine, but for $8.95, they coulda done a bit better. The Angel Hair Pasta was a sizeable plate, with six phat succulently sauteed shrimps, interspersed with chopped tomatoes and a bit of garlic, def. enough for two medium eaters. The pasta was good and the shrimps were mouth watering sweet. Very Scrumptious. Customer service: ok to good. Decor: typically Cheese cake factory, sleek and clean. Bathrooms: typically super clean and well lit."
Vivian D.,"San Diego, United States",455,55,,3.0,29/5/2013,"How do I explain my confused feelings for this place... It's really pricey for OK food, but the ambiance is romantic and great for large groups and for dates... and the dessert is to die for and not so overpriced. The only thing I really like on their menu is the carbonara.  Everything else tasted really ""whatever"" in comparison to other specialty restaurants.  Their menu is really large and gives a large selection but it's all ""not that special"". The restaurant is Huuuuuuge~~ so flagging down your waiter/ess is kind of annoying... so service is also MEH, but once in a while there's a really charismatic waiter, but again, this is rare. I have really mixed feelings for here and can't explain why I come back here to eat other than the convenience and the great cheesecake. Try the oreo cheesecake, it's to die for."
Marquelle S.,"Summerville, United States",8,21,,4.0,19/6/2014,"Prepare for a wait. There will always be one but if you're not in a hurry it is worth it. The staff has always been very friendly and attentive at every visit. The atmosphere is loud so if you want to have a quiet conversation, this may not be the most ideal place. However, the food is wonderful and this place has sinfully delicious Oreo and Red Velvet Cheesecakes."
Christian I.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,4.0,13/12/2015,I only got cheese cake but it was super good and the view from outside sitting was beautiful. There was a long wait and really crowded but it was worth it.
Jess W.,"San Francisco, United States",66,554,528,3.0,16/5/2010,"I waited a hour for a table for 3 on a Friday night, which is pretty good. Do not come here and expect a table waiting for you. If you're lucky, you might get a window seat and the view of gorgeous!  The food is decent. The prices are the same at all their other restaurants. My favorite is mash potatoes and meatloaf since I'd eat it almost anywhere. The chicken wings, were way spicy. Sniffing it made my eyes water and my nose tickle. I am probably biased since I do not enjoy eating spicy food.  Anyways, I met a classmate that works here. He says that the waiters despise customers when they come in 10-20 minutes before closing time. They rather go home instead of serving you for tip. He also stated that if you piss your waiter off, they really SPIT in your food. So watch your mouths people!"
Joshua L.,"San Francisco, United States",734,213,10,3.0,12/4/2012,"The Costco of chain restaurants. The wait is forever, the servings are all enormous, and you always end up buying (and spending) more than you really need to. Love it or hate it. USEFUL TIP: If the wait is 30-45 minutes or longer, try the bar. If your party is 4 or less, you can most usually find a seat and they offer the same table service in the bar, except with no reservations!"
cheryl d.,"Union City, United States",8,22,32,1.0,2/3/2012,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I have never been more INSULTED and HUMILIATED in my entire life. Party of 4 adults 6 kids.   Sub total 171.20    Tax 14.55  SF fee (2.5%) 4.28 Total bill 190.03 Gratuity was not automatically added to the bill for some reason. I left 191.00 and an extra 20 dollars.  On our way out... the server GOPAL comes rushing up to me in front of my family and other dining guests and says...  Gopal: ""You left me a 2 dollar tip on a 190 dollar bill!?!"" (he was shaking and his tone was very angry) Me: ""Wait, what?"" Gopal: ""Yeah YOU left me a 2 dollar tip on a 190 dollar bill."" Me: ""Um no I didn't"" I then proceeded to follow him to the server station because he felt the need to prove me wrong. He counted the money again and found the extra 20. Gopal: ""Oh yeah we get that a lot here, sorry."" Me: ""Uh yeah"" and I walked away. Everyone in my family could not believe what was happening. I was in total shock. Granted it wasn't a huge tip but it was okay service and that warrants a 10% tip in my opinion. And after the way he confronted me he didn't deserve anything at all.  So if you do decide to dine here and you sit in Gopal's section MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE HIM A TIP! Other wise he will come after you!!! I will never come back to this location again."
Carolyn C.,"Los Angeles, United States",20,22,22,3.0,20/6/2013,great service and always crowded at this location. We have to wait for nearly 40min before a table was available. The bread is always good :)

Jeff A.,"Chicago, United States",0,6,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory. I would say I typically have pretty high expectations, and Cheesecake typically comes through. Always a great reliable place for lunch/dinner. My wife and I are here at 11:45am on New Years Day in between shopping. When we got off the elevator, the lobby was PACKED. Uh oh. We put out names in and find the wait is 30-35 mins. I go for a stroll around the restaurant, and I find no less than 40 tables open. I work in the restaurant industry, so I understand you guess your staffing needs and if you're wrong, you're bogged down. But come on Cheesecake Factory. It's New Years Day in the middle of the biggest shopping area in San Francisco. You KNOW you'll be packed, especially at 11:45am for the lunch crowd. I hate to see what happens in a half hour when most of the lunch crowd comes in and a lot of them are turned away by this wait. They're just losing revenue, and losing a loyal follower in me. You've got one more shot Cheesecake. Please don't let me down."
