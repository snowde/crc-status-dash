Nadege B.,"Los Angeles, United States",6,12,1,1.0,18/10/2014,"I eat here pretty often and am usually satisfied with my food an service. On this particular Saturday I took some friends from out of town and was mortified at the service! Burnt food, undercooked food, cold food passive aggressive manager who clearly was not trained in non violent communication. The server just emotional spillage all over the place nasty attitude coming out of everywhere! They tried to passively kick us out, by not asking if we want desert set the bill on the table.... I mean seriously I know we look like some young hooligans...clearly you racial stereotypes but JESUSE CAN YOU SHOW US A LITTLE RESPECT?!?!??!? Ridiculous!!!"
Lily K.,"Sausalito, United States",52,465,100,3.0,2/2/2013,"Came here with co-workers to discuss some software system stuff we use..and it proved to be a nice place to get together, a bit loud, but it was neat eating so high up in a building.  Ordered the shepherd's pie. Some of the filling and veggies were crunchy...not quite my taste for shepherd's pie. So 2-3 stars there. Opted to try the tiramisu for dessert. There's a tiramisu cheesecake and a regular tiramisu. I've had the cheesecake before, it's really good, so I ordered the regular tiramisu. The regular tiramisu had really good flavor, but the texture was off. It was mushy and watery, which made it a little difficult to eat. I still say the flavor was great though! Go for the outdoor seating."
Chad H.,"Elk Grove, United States",77,16,5,2.0,28/5/2014,"My wife and ate here for dinner. Even though we were in SF and had so many other options, we chose to use a gift card we had for this restaurant. I had the chicken carbonara and my wife had the bang bang coconut chicken and shrimp. Both meals were mediocre at best. My carbonara was way to salty and my wife's dish was over the top on the coconut. We were disappointed. The service was only ok. For a restaurant that gets so much hype, they are totally overpriced and the food underperforms. We won't be going back."
Ed U.,"San Francisco, United States",4220,3903,30016,3.0,12/2/2008,"Now I'm sure if I was still an acne-laden adolescent in my powder blue tuxedo on my way to the senior ball with the bespectacled secretary of the chess club, the Cheesecake Factory would be my first choice for impressing her once I pinned the $2.75 plastic corsage on her handmade polyester dress. I swear this place still gives off that geek vibe to me even though I doubt I could have afforded this place in high school. The suburban and global masses that converge upon this place is still staggering, so make sure you allot at least two hours for the time it takes to wait and get through a meal here. And that's only if you're not picky where you sit since they offer outdoor seating. Oh and you get that corporate red-light buzzer complete with an unnecessary advertisement attached to it. How better to impress your prom date than to hold one of these buzzers. Jamie W. and I were lucky (if you can call it that) to wait only about half an hour on Sunday afternoon for a table. I had not been here in such a long, long time, and I finally remembered why it is still such a zoo...a humongous menu and portion out-of-control. I must have been in a high school cafeteria mood since I ordered the $15.95 Famous Factory Meatloaf, which consists of two big chunks of slightly burnt ground beef topped with grilled onions with a major pile of heavily creamed mashed potatoes on one side and a succotash side on the other (see the photo). Jamie went for the $12.95 Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad which came shaped like Twin Peaks as if to signal to us...""Wha' ya' kidding me? You ordered two entrees?"" Lots of fresh ingredients on the plate but kinda saucy with the vinaigrette dressing (see the photo). Overall, the quality of the food is pretty good for a chain. Just go to an Olive Garden to make sure I'm right. We didn't leave room for cheesecake since we devoured the hot rolls quickly once we sat down. I actually don't regret the decision since the refined sugar would have made me too wired for a night at the theater. But will I come back to the madhouse wait? Hmmm, probably not soon....but hey, they're not stingy on free refills. FOOD - 3 stars...it ain't heavy, it's the Cheesecake Factory...suburban upscale for the Costco crowd in the heart of the city AMBIANCE - 3 stars...kinda Baroque tacky if you actually look hard enough, but there are so many people milling about, you probably won't notice SERVICE - 3.5 stars...courteous in a corporate trained way..too big a pitch given on the cheesecake if you ask me TOTAL - 3 stars...if you have a burning desire to see where tourists graze, by all means, come here"
April W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,4.0,23/12/2013,"Is this the only company in the world that makes service people wear all white? What kind of sick person would arrange that. White pants  are extremely degrading in the first place-compound this with a long white apron, white shirt, a tie and the combination is fashionably lethal. People who are serving food and running around like maniacs all day would probably be better off wearing all black to muffle the bruising betrayal of food splotches adorning their outfits. Those white pants are the scarlett letter of the service industry. I go there to eat so much that I hate myself.  The food is good if you are into that sort of thing."
Grace Anne D.,"Concord, United States",266,364,623,4.0,7/1/2011,"I've never been to The Cheesecake Factory but I've had their red velvet cheesecake that was given to us from a family friend and it was delicious! So this one is at the top floor of Macy's. Beautiful view, we asked to sit outside. It was super cold outside but at least they had those warmer lamps. Our waiter was very nice and was patient, I liked how he sort of took command with who orders first and how the order of the table was gonna go (because there was 8 of us). We ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake (no surprise) and it was good, maybe I wasn't in the mood for something sweet but it was really sweet for me that we ended up not finishing it. :( I wanna try their food next time :)"
Eliza F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,49,80,4.0,26/4/2013,"This review is solely for the cheesecake. BEST. CHEESECAKE. EVER. This is by far the best best best cheesecake I've ever had! But, at 7+ dollars PER SLICE, it's probably the most expensive slice of anything I've ever had.  Worth it to try, especially if you're in the area! Went at 10:30pm so there weren't a ton of people, which was nice as I can imagine how busy this place gets on weekends!"
Christine M.,"San Francisco, United States",479,607,210,4.0,26/6/2012,"im on the fence about this place....always so packed and crowded and everyone wants to go here...why!??!? i would remember when we would try to do big groups and have fancy dinners here....food wasn't memorable but just a nice atmosphere maybe? drinks were yummy.  came here today for lunch and got to sit outside and it was so nice out! calamari- decent, first bite was extremely salty for some reason, but normal after that. mushroom flatbread- yum, just like a pizza, good amount of cheese miso salmon- my bf can make this but he wanted to see if it tasted any better and it did sound good today. the sauce was good, but salmon was a lil too cooked, i like it when it breaks apart easily with your fork. thai...something noodles- peanut sauce, it was too salty sweet? not sure, but a bit overpowering.  and our waiter was great! so i added one more star! we barely ate half our meal and had to to-go it. we also had a giftcard so that was nice. but to come again...unless its the ONLY place to go...probably not"
Donnie F.,"Colma, United States",183,31,83,3.0,15/3/2011,"Highlight: great service, friendly staff, and bomb ass cheese cakes! The buffalo chicken blast, deep fried macaroni cheese, crispy crab bites, ahi tartare , and chicken samosas was HELLA good!! Great view of union square.  Cons: weekends here are crazy! The wait time is pretty long. U have to take an elevator up that can only fit 10 people MAX.  I always leave this place with a satisfied stomach. Prices are somewhat high depending on what you eat. The appetizers filled my stomach last time I came here. They have a good selection of wine and a very diverse menu. Best time to go here is during odd times on the weekdays."
Kara B.,"Minden, United States",0,6,4,2.0,27/11/2015,Very long wait. They were out of 3 things we ordered. No menu to pick new things when we were told they were out of things. Food came at all different times. If in San Fran go out to any other place.  Long wait over crowded average or less food.
De C.,"Oakland, United States",0,4,,1.0,19/2/2012,"Went today for lunch with a dear friend and while I was eating my nachos, BIT INTO A PIECE OF METAL!!!!  Upon closer inspection, it looked like a piece of a knife or other sort of metal cutting surface.  Luckily, I was not cut nor were my teeth hurt, but boy did it scare me!  I brought it immediately to the attention of the wait staff who brought over the manager who asked how I was-- all was okay but they only took off my entre, not my drink and I had to pay over $30 for my friend's food and my drink...  Needless to say, I will NOT be going back!  If I can't trust my safety, I can't eat in a place...  You are warned..."
Gayi L.,"Newport Beach, United States",3,43,8,1.0,9/10/2014,"I dont know anyone has ever complained about this.  It s ridiculas this cheesecake factory just had a One Tiny elevator.  As I remember elevator note said that elevator only can fit in 8 people.  Everytime I saw the alarm rang,  people still fit in.   That elevator still ran up to the top floor but you could hear the horrible voice.  Come on,  cheesecake factory has to keep people safe,  right?  You earn that much from the customers,  cant you think of this?  Also I believe lots of people don't mind taking stairs but where is?  I start think of fire exit... hope they could check out this issue."
Anny T.,"Yuba City, United States",201,17,2,3.0,8/10/2013,My group and I ate there on a Friday night so of course it was busy. 1 hour and 30 minute wait. Feet started hurting but that's what we get for coming at the busiest hour.  Loved dining on the rooftop. Our server was very friendly.  Everyone enjoyed their food but my ahi tuna steak was cooked for way too long. I like mine seared and for the center to just melt in my mouth. I didn't complain because it was way too busy there and I figured a replacement order would come out once the rest of my party was done eating (they were scarfing down their food after that nearly 2 hour wait). The wasabi crust was good.. And it was the only thing that was good about my plate.  I tried my husband's ribeye and it was good. Cooked perfectly.  I was in a good mood though (my husband's birthday!) so oh well. This place is more for the fun atmosphere than a good hearty meal.
Angel P.,"Sacramento, United States",27,46,12,5.0,30/8/2014,"I ordered the Chicken Alfredo with Chicken and fresh grated cheese to my likings; the pasta sauce was super creamy and flavorful! Chicken wasn't too oily or not too dry, just perfect. It's a lot for one plate and person! At the end of your dinner, get yourself so,e Cheesecake, worth getting! Great customer service also! Only com is the waiting but also worth it! If you go at night, the view is beautiful!"
Michelle V.,"Manteca, United States",141,47,173,1.0,8/8/2015,service sucks- food been sitting under a heat lamp to the point of pasta being hard. 2 of 4 meals come out. last two meals came out 10min after two other orders. Water not refilled.
Jenny H.,"San Jose, United States",122,6,3,2.0,5/10/2014,"I've eaten at Cheesecake countless times but this is the second time at this location. I got the luau salad and once again, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the luau salad is my favorite at the Cheesecake Factory, but this location doesn't seem to make it that well. I would have given this 3 stars, but the waitress wasn't very nice, the bread was old, and the silverware were dirty."
Kacy D.,"San Francisco, United States",1,8,,1.0,28/1/2012,"Worst experience at a restaurant ever. Ever! Terrible service.  My boyfriend and I live a few blocks away so we like to come to the cheesecake factory to enjoy their huge menu, but our last visit solidified the fact that we will never be going again. Our waitress, Janeise, was absolutely horrible. She took forever to take our order and was extremely rude and passive aggressive. After we ordered our food we waited for it to come out for an hour, until our waitress decided to come to our table and tell us that she forgot to write down our orders and she asked us to tell her them again. She comes back 10 minutes later to tell us that the kitchen was no longer serving the dish that my boyfriend ordered, threw down a menu, sighed, and told him to pick something else. We sat down 11:00, and did get the bill until 12:40. It was so late that we didnt even take time to eat, we boxed up our food and left  in disappointment.  Worst part about it? As we were waiting for our food we overheard our waitress talking to the people at the table next to us. They were tourists visiting from France and were not accustomed to the idea of ""tipping"". They paid their bill and left her a 15% tip and Janiese complained to them that they should have paid her at lease 20%... Absolute worst experience my boyfriend and I have ever had in a restaurant. I was surprised that they didnt comp us a desert, or even our meals for having to wait so long, and Im extremely dissapointed that my once favorite restaurant has servers like Janeise tarnishing its reputation."
Zara Y.,"Sausalito, United States",5,64,4,5.0,4/4/2015,"Amazing view from the rooftop! The food is standard cheesecake factory quality. Giving them 5 stars because I forgot my purse at the restaurant, which contained all my bank cards and multiple forms of ID. I was back in Sausalito before I realized. I called them and they found my purse. I asked them to put it somewhere safe overnight for me. They checked my husband was who he said he was when he went over to pick it up for me the next day.  Thank you, cheesecake factory!"
Michelle N.,"San Francisco, United States",219,271,460,5.0,27/1/2010,"Note:  this review is for cheesecake take-out only. I was very pleased with today's experience at Cheesecake Factory.  Earlier in the week, I placed an order for the small red velvet cheesecake to bring to a friend's farewell party.  I come in to pick up the cake this afternoon and was told that they did not have any of the small size available, but if I wanted I could get the large size for the price of the small.  I was asked if that size would be too big, I could get  1/2 of a large size.  I told the manager that 1/2 of a cake wouldn't do because it would be poor presentation at the party I would be attending.  So, I opt for the full large cake.   Great customer service!  The cashier was also super friendly....enjoyed our brief chat while I waited for my cake to be boxed."
Chace H.,"Rohnert Park, United States",0,1,,2.0,20/12/2014,"If you're going to call out a two hour wait time as a ""worst case scenario"", do not expect to sit us three hours into our wait with smiling faces. Food was ok. Ordered an alfredo with chicken and recieved a giant plate of carbs with literally 1 oz of chicken on it. Thats bullshit...spending three more dollars on an entree should feel like you SPENT three more dollars, not like you made a huge mistake. I've eaten at a few of these places, all are great except this. Its a shit-show. Batten down the hatches, streamline shit, and learn how to manage better!"
