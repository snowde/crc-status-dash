Valentin R.,"San Francisco, United States",6,11,,4.0,6/1/2015,Long wait list and a very hectic location. Typical cheesecake and decent service. Love the cheesecakes though!
Janice W.,"San Rafael, United States",0,3,,1.0,30/6/2016,"What a disappointing experience for us and our grandchildren.  The service was pathetic.  Our server Isaac T. took our orders, brought drinks and bread and then some 35 minutes later told us our order would be arriving soon.  Someone else brought our order.  We never saw Isaac again, no one came over.  We had to ask a busboy to clear our table.  Isaac reappeared and don't know what we were thinking, but ordered a piece of cheesecake and asked Isaac for the check.  The check arrived and my husband then had to find someone to take our payment.  My husband asked ""where was our server"" and the reply, ""he went out to eat"". No one came to tell us he was on a break, which must have lasted the whole one hour and 20 minutes that we were left to fend for ourselves.  My husband called after we left and spoke to the Manager, Mark, who said ""SF law provides breaks for employees"". But wouldn't common courtesy be nice if someone told us the server was on break and have someone cover in his absence.  Apparently, not the case at Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco.  We have dined at many Cheesecake Factories from Hawaii to Virginia, but none have had such poor customer service or follow up with management."
Sonny W.,"Fremont, United States",19,375,189,4.0,22/3/2013,always always always a long wait but service is pretty good and i just LOVE the dark bread...always asking for seconds.   They also treat the kids well and get a plastic cup with straw.  Booths are roomy  and portions are big.  And dessert! I think they load the food with grease or butter cuz after lunch I did not need to eat dinner....ate the next day....
Matt G.,"San Francisco, United States",2161,1911,3823,3.0,19/9/2006,"It has been 6 years since Matt has stepped his size 12 foot in Cheesecake Factory of Union Square. Everytime Matt comes here, there is always a long wait and extremely bad service occurring frequently, which pissed Matt off.  After a extended layoff in coming to the restaurant, Matt decides to comeback and see if they have corrected the restaurants' problem that everybody is complaining from reading their shitty reviews.  The Fantastic Four came here on Tuesday night, and the wait (15 minutes in compare to 1hour 45 min) was shorter this time around. A slight improvement from the last time. The waitress was nicer to the Fantastic Four this time, by giving us  a table quickly and coming back frequently filling up our water. Which was cool!!  Matt ordered the Shepherd Pie for $12.00. It tasted OK, but it was a good size. Wifey ordered the the New Orlean Pasta. The pasta didn't look too appealing, and it looked like Hurricane Katrina damaged the pasta, but it was OK as well.  The Rugrats ordered and splitted a Caesar Salad and Bruschetta. Most kids hate vegetables, but Mr. Rugrat loves Caesar Salad. He might grow up to be a Vegan.   We bypass desserts this time, which disappointed wifey, who was eyeing and salivating at the dessert counter like Odie. We got out of the restaurant in a tad over an hour, which seems short. Six years ago, Matt would rate this restaurant a one-star, like most of you would. This time it's a 3 star, certain thing has been corrected from the last time we came. But they need more work to be a five-star."
Shannon B.,"Elk Grove, United States",352,50,13,2.0,4/4/2014,TERRIBLE SERVICE. Our waitress was unattentive and never checked on us. Our water was never refilled. It took her over a half an hour before she asked us what we wanted to eat and to even bring us the water. It was my best friends birthday and she gave us the dessert menu to pick her cheesecake and didn't come back till we had to ask another server to get our waitress. If you don't have 4 hours of your day to spend do not come here to eat.
Cynthia D.,"San Francisco, United States",403,66,4,5.0,11/3/2012,"I have been here at least three times and I gotta say I love this place.  The only catch is the long wait (because there's no reservations) but you just gotta time it right. But thank god for Macys. Cheesecake Factory is right above Macy so you can explore around the top two floors until the table is ready.  I love to eat, I eat a lot but this place really makes me full. You know what I'm talking about right? Those days where you are too full that you might puke? Yeah, only go there with an empty stomach you won't regret it. During lunch, their portions may not seem like a lot, but trust me it's HECKA FILLING. If you look hard enough, you don't have to kill your wallet for a good lunch. They do have that extra SF Health Charge thing going on but hey, it tastes good, you get good bread and butter, you get good service. You get to eat in a lively, clean, comfortable, fancy setting. What more could you possibly want?  If you are looking for a five star restaurant with a dress code, then get out of here. You gotta look somewhere else. This place is perfect for prom night, birthday dinner or even a casual lunch.  If you come here for dinner and it's a bit chilly outside, don't fear. That's why we have heat lamps invented. If you choose to eat outside, you can totally eat on the patio ish area where you get an amazing view of Union square. Here's a SF secret, come to the Cheesecake factory at night time during Christmas time, you get to see the tall bright tree. That's like a room with a view but a dinner with a view and a heat lamp. HOW COOL IS THAT? Here's another SFsecret, come during the chinese new year parade, you can watch the parade without the crowds and stinkbombs.  The icing on top would be that if you do choose to eat outside, you can have a candle lit on your table. SF can be pretty windy so if it is windy outside and you choose to have a candle on, it might go out in a few minutes.  I recommend all of my friends to come here when we have money and time. If you have nothing to do and you want to eat a lot of American food, definitely this is the place to go, especially right after shopping."
Kendall M.,"Costa Mesa, United States",5,17,1,5.0,19/2/2014,"This place is just fabulous. The location is fun, above Macy's in the square, great to people watch and you can be served outside on the patio. The service is great, the sweets...... Omg.... Delicious. The prices are surprisingly reasonable and all in all, this is a really fun place. We love it."
Macie B.,"Eureka, United States",32,13,9,5.0,8/10/2014,"Love, love, love Ahi Carpacchio....but might order something new. It's only a 10min wait for our table at 6pm!"
Cecile S.,"San Francisco, United States",38,250,1,4.0,8/8/2014,"food: 4/5 service: 4/5 decor/atmosphere: 4/5 Don't come here anymore, but still a fan. I came here multiple times and enjoyed myself each time. I wouldn't say it is the best in the city, but its a place where I know I would get decent food. The portions are huge here and I always have left overs. Each dish is about $12-20. This place is a chain and runs like one. They are strict on how the servers treat you and how each meal comes out. It is never gourmet, but its still good. I only come here now for late night cheesecake since this location is open till 12am.  Only time I had issues was that they tried to maximize their seating and had all these tables up against doorways and walkways. A lot of people complained cuz the doors were knocking stuff over, wind was blowing stuff off tables, and servers kept bumping against people. Many parties and myself had to ask to change to a different locations. I hope they went back to their regular seating arrangement."
Ash R.,"Honolulu, United States",247,167,134,3.0,10/11/2010,"They have a good selection of choices to pick from and their food is pretty consistent. My friend loves the fried Marconi and cheese but i personally don't think they are great. The avocado fried eggs rolls is pretty good.  The worst place of Cheese Factory is waiting to be service since they don't take reservation. Don't ever go on friday nights, the wait in line is so long."
Brian B.,"Dublin, United States",277,55,2,1.0,19/1/2012,"As everyone knows, the food here is mediocre at best. So, why the 1 star... I arrive during my 1 hour lunch break to catch up with a friend. As we walk in, we're told the wait is 5-10 minutes, not bad. Over an hour later, after about 7 ""just 5 more minutes"" we are finally seated (and I have to make up some lame excuse to my boss for returning to my desk so late). Immediately upon sitting down an exposed NAIL in the chair tears my brand new suit beyond repair. As the waiter comes to take our order he ask how we're doing, so I tell him not very good since I was just kept waiting for over an hour, will be late for work, and my suit was destroyed by a nail in my chair. He responds ""Oh, that's too bad. We'll get you a new chair."" I'm never coming back here again."
Evita-Marie R.,"Seattle, United States",132,133,22,3.0,6/12/2012,"Beautiful View. Ok Food. Ok Service. The cheesecake factory is probably on the top of my list as far as chains. I've celebrated many birthdays and occasions at Cheesecake Factory. My last experience at the one in SF however kind of let me down. We went here last sunday for an late lunch/early dinner. During our 2+hr dinner. Our server had changed 3 times-- it made it very confusing when we needed something. It also took extra long for our drinks and food to come out, probably because the server who took our order was different than the server bringing our food & the server who brought our food was different from the server who checked us out. It did not make for a smooth dinner.  The food is usually very pleasing. However his last time, the presentation lacked. My salad looked as though the greens weren't that fresh and someone did not put much effort to make it look... like something you'd want to eat. My fish came out the same way-- very sloppy and sad to look at.  Nonetheless, these reasons would not halt me from EVER coming back to the cheesecake factory-- afterall, I grew up eating here. Everyone has an off day & maybe staffing was challenged that day-- however, hopefully next time will be a better experience."
Diana B.,"San Diego, United States",13,44,1,4.0,12/5/2012,"After a long day of shopping in Union Square, my fave thing to do is come up here and get a cosmo.  Best cosmo anywhere, and I only drink them here because they are consistently yummy.  The hot spinach dip is really good.  I don't want to know how may calories are in it though.  Ignorance is bliss."
Karen L.,"Seattle, United States",297,904,341,5.0,8/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, but it is definitely one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Every Cheesecake Factory I go to, the food is always superb! I only order the pastas because I don't think the other stuff is worth ordering. I love the pastas here!! The last time I came here, I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta and it was SO GOOD. My friend ordered a salad and it was huge! The portions of their pastas are also really big! I can never finish the entire thing by myself. The service was great, and the view is great too! The restaurant is above the Macy's so you get a great view of Union Square. We sat outside, even though it was a bit chilly, but they have those heater lamps, so it wasn't so bad."
Hannah C.,"San Francisco, United States",357,110,351,2.0,15/12/2011,"My girlfriend and I decided to eat here after many hours of shopping at Macy's.  It's convenient enough.   The only reason this place always had a long wait list was because they do not take reservations.  Portions always seemed enormous but to me they only appeared large because they're actually served in huge sized bowls and plates.  Food is mediocre at best.   We shared Chicken Madeira (sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce and served with mashed potato).  That's their ""most popular chicken dish!""  MMMM overcooked asparagus and chicken.  It was edible when we were starving and didn't want to wait but I wouldn't order it again.   They have a huge selection of cheesecakes but I'm not a fan of their dense and toothache sweet cheesecakes.  Served in huge slices and price was proportional  to the size.  If I ever order cheesecakes, my pick would always be the fresh strawberry cheesecake but we didn't order any desserts this time.  We couldn't wait to get out of there after having to cramp at the corner of the bar to eat our dinner.  It was madness."
Richard R.,"Santa Barbara, United States",2,10,5,3.0,5/10/2014,Honestly went there for the view. Food is okay food is okay. Dessert is outstanding. Great place to take the family to eat.
Stephanie G.,"Vacaville, United States",115,65,158,4.0,17/1/2011,"Beautiful day + great view of Union Square + hunger pains = Eat @ Cheesecake Factory's sky terrace My husband and I were very pleased with our most recent visit. We arrived on a Saturday evening at 5pm and only had to wait 25min for a seat on the sky terrace. That's quick! I don't know if my husband slipped a little extra to the worker but we were lucky enough to eat directly next to the ledge and overlook at all the ice skaters below. (During the winter season only.) We will probably go to Hell because we started laughing at people who fell on the ""ice"". Anyways, our waiter was very attentive to our needs and quick to act. He was also laidback and didn't hover over us while we ate. I gave this place 4 stars because it started to get a little chilly as the sun was going down and yet the standing heater next to us wasn't on and yet all the others were..."
Shemi E.,"Daly City, United States",0,7,3,2.0,29/10/2014,Very long waiting!! Been there yesterday and I waited for more then hour for a table and then 30min more for my appetizer. Not the place for you if you don't have at list 2 hours to spend. The food is ok not more than that.
Carlos B.,"San Francisco, United States",9,8,3,5.0,28/10/2014,"One of my favorite places in San Francisco! AMAZING FOOD! everything on the menu is incredibly good and on top of that, they have THE most amazing mojitos i have tried in San Francisco. 100% recommended."
Emilse P.,"Richmond, United States",20,19,6,4.0,9/5/2013,"I hope you're not starving! Because if you are, you're better off buying a hotdog from the guy around the corner (they're not so bad). I don't understand why a place with such popularity hasn't expanded to another floor. I was here at the beginning of December, I don't know if wait time is ever any less than 2 hours. I must say that those pagers don't always work & I know it's busy but the hosts aren't very attentive, I had to walk up & ask if it was our turn yet, and our names weren't even written down. Or maybe they got crossed out?  We sat directly across the host's booth and they never called us. I was content with how they handled the situation though. They host apologized, took the pager & took us to a table. Not a place to bring strollers. We had to fold it up & lay in across a chair so the waiters could walk by. The food was great! Everything was delicious & the prices are not extremely high. I will be visiting again soon!"
