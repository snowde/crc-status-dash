Robert R.,"San Marcos, United States",0,4,,2.0,20/6/2016,"I'm not one to complain but this last weekend I took my wife on a weekend birthday gate away to San Francisco. She chose to have her birthday dinner at the cheese cake factory since she loves the place, we eat there all the time in SD. I can honestly say this was the worst service I have received from any chain restaurant around. First they had said our wait was about an hour it took 2 hours, second when we got seated the table hadn't been wipe down at all and was sticky with no silverware, third we ordered drinks and got them well after our food arrived, forth I found a rock in my mash potatoes and accidentally chewed on it fifth our appetizer and food for the kids came out after my wife and I had finished our food and was a bit cold. The whole experienced ruined my wife day and both of us ended up with headaches. I will say they did try and make it up by not charging me for my plate and appetizer but still killed the experience for us."
Robbie P.,"Friern Barnet, London, United Kingdom",1,7,1,2.0,1/8/2013,"The food was bland, the best part being the drinks. The Blueberry Mojito was a real treat.  Other than that, it was all very generic. The Sliders tasted on the same level as a McDonald's burger, while the pasta I ordered lacked any kick or real flavour.  The cakes were nice but not outstanding. At the prices The Cheesecake Factory was charging, I will not be visiting again."
Beth D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,12,,3.0,22/11/2015,"Ok, Cheesecake Factory! Everything's better. Food is much improved over our visit a year ago and service was also much better. It's such a handy location we caved and gave it another shot after swearing we'd never set foot in the place again. After two recent successful visits, we've changed our tune. If you're in the Union Square area, give it a try."
MJ M.,"San Jose, United States",0,12,1,2.0,3/9/2015,"So far, I believed this Cheesecake Factory always had the best customer service. I guess they're lacking in the department now. We were ignored twice by two servers and one Asian server blatantly said ""sorry man I'm not your server"" and walked away. Any person in the right mind will know how unbelievably rude that would be. This is the first time we were ever served with incredibly poor service in this location. Luckily, our server Jonathan was kind enough to see to the problem and offered to talk to a manager."
Alix J.,"San Francisco, United States",107,183,30,5.0,14/10/2012,"Besides waiting an hour and 10 minutes, which is normal I think on a Friday night I took my mom out for her birthday. We sat outside on the deck, it was perfect because it wasn't too cold and the heat lamps were on. The lights of the surrounding buildings and view of the square was beautiful at night! I had the garlic noodles for my meal and my mom ordered a chicken dish with mash potatoes, the skinny margaritas we ordered were amazing! Â Will our waiter was so nice and helpful, I told him it was my mom's birthday and we ordered pumpkin cheesecake to share. Will along with another waiter and waitress came with the cake and sang Happy birthday after they lit the candle! When I paid the bill Will came back and said my name along with thank you."
Peter L.,"San Francisco, United States",3149,905,2630,4.0,24/11/2009,"The salmon ""egg roll"" is something I get each time, even though it's fusiony. The ribs too unless someone else orders it (then I'll just mooch off of them, lol), then I'd get the filet mignon. Other items like the pizzas, pasta dishes, even other steaks, are similar to elsewhere. Can't go wrong getting any of those, but they're not memorable either.  Portions seemed smaller than they used to be but were still plentiful. For desserts: strawberry cheesecake, white choc w/caramel macadamia cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, 30th Anniversary choc w/fudge cheesecake. Bliss. Great place to take out-of-towners to ""eat well"" and for them to still feel comfortable with the surroundings. Located on the 8th floor of the Women's Macy's (entrance on the Geary St side)."
Serenity A.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",159,40,42,5.0,15/4/2015,"the ambiance alone makes this place worth waiting in line for...downtown city views, drinks appetizers and delicious cheese cake!"
J. H.,"Oakland, United States",6,11,7,3.0,11/4/2014,"I would rate this place 5 stars or more for the occasion and the memories, but I cannot. Came to this restaurant around the first week of January. This was one of the first places I went to for my first date with my boyfriend, and it was quite a memorable night. We talk about it a lot til this day and look forward to coming back again (When he graduates and hopefully finds a job here *fingers crossed*) On with the review though, and less with the cheese. ____ The Wait: Can't talk about the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square without mentioning the wait! It's almost like a strange conversational blasphemy...Gotta talk about the wait. Let's just say it's the kind of wait where, you have to go window shopping just to kill the time. If the person at the front desk says 30 min, they mean 30 min and maybe a few after. If they say an hour, they mean an hour. They provide you with one of those portable electronic ringers to let you know your seat is ready. Just be patient. We had to wait an hour and some minutes, which was fine with us because it gave us time to window shop (don't buy anything in Union Square unless you make a six figure salary, seriously. What are you? A wallet serial killer?) and walk about downtown. Even explore the huge Macy's store. Sofas are conveniently placed next to the restaurant's entrance if you don't plan on walking anywhere to kill time. If they've moved it by the time you read this review: sorry bud. Your couch is in another floor. (Mario reference was intentional). ____ The Service: Service was great in my opinion. I didn't have any rude service. The people at front desk had to raise their voice almost to yell to inform us of stuff over the crowd, so don't take it as them being rude. They're just trying to do their job. Our waiter was a very cheery gay man who was very funny and checked in on us at appropriate times. He didn't check in on us excessively which was very kind of him. He was available to us whenever we needed him though. Wish I remembered his name! But wherever you are dude, you're great. Keep it up. ___ The Atmosphere: We sat on the balcony part and it can get a bit chilly yes, but they got space heaters for that and we were placed conveniently next to it. Nice fancy atmosphere. A bit dark on the inside, but it sets the date mood. Great view of the city at night and very clean and nice. Very crowded though. As soon as you get to the restaurant via escalators, you'll notice how loud it is. It's a popular place though, so don't be surprised. ___ The Food: I can't remember 100% what we ordered. I just know my boyfriend got a pizza, I got some sort of chicken pesto tomato garlic pasta, and we got vanilla bean cheesecake. Let's just say pasta is not this restaurants forte. I'll mention the bad first then the good. -Cons: You could tell the pasta was made with canned tomatoes, poorly chopped up garlic and boxed pasta. The chicken was very dry too and the plate overall tasted pre-made. The pasta was not boiled well, because I had some half cooked noodles and some over cooked noodles. It was a mixture of both. The sauce had way too much garlic and not enough flavor. It tasted like watered down tomatoes and that it came straight from a can. I felt like there wasn't a lot of love put into my dish. The portion was very big, which I didn't mind. Overall, the dish could have been done better if each part was cooked well. -Pros: The pizza was great. It was yummy warm and flavorful. The crust was thin but still crunchy and not stale. I wish I ordered the pizza instead of pasta, because I found myself eating off the same plate as my boyfriend more than my own.  The cheesecake was the star of the show. We were very full but we still wanted to eat all of the cheesecake, but we had to save it. Even after saving it in a box, it still tasted delicious. The vanilla was fragrant and just the right amount of sweetness. The cheesecake was very airy but sweet and delightful. The whip cream was whipped to the right consistency and I felt like I was eating sweet clouds in my mouth. A nice light cheesecake, not full of a lot of strong flavors but it was juuuust right. Probably the best cheesecake I had in my life so far. I look forward to trying more from there next time.  ___ Other comments:  Not much besides go for the cheesecakes. Every other dish is kind of questionable. If you want to take someone on a date, this is one of those places to put on your list. I miss this place, and we'll come back for it on another date. I'll order something other than the pasta though. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Gong L.,"Union City, United States",12,29,,5.0,4/12/2014,Every time I go to Cheesecake factory I have to wait for a long time but I personally think is worth it.
Jenny M.,"Santa Clara, United States",6,37,19,4.0,9/4/2012,"The wait wasn't too bad for a Friday evening. I came a little early..around 6PM before the crazy dinner rush started however. My friend and I were absolutely craving the calamari so we definitely ordered that right when we sat down. They definitely lessened their portions and jacked up their price... I got the BBQ Chicken pizza which was SOOOOOO delicious. I was very surprised, but I would definitely recommend it."
Joanne R.,"Eden Prairie, United States",2,41,,4.0,13/10/2015,Beautiful view on a clear night. Husband had the Chicken DaVinci and I had the Skinnylicious salmon with steamed vegetables. We split a limoncello dessert. As usual the food was great. Only downside was the hour wait.
Ashley S.,"Coquitlam, Canada",108,115,42,3.0,13/10/2012,"This was my first experience at a Cheesecake Factory and I had high expectations. I visited with a group of about 25 as we were in town to run the Nike Womens Marathon. It's a good thing we had a reservation because they were really lined up! I tried to order 3 different beers before I found one they had in stock. Kind of annoying...  I was very happy with my meal. I had the Crab and Artichoke dip and the Margherita flat bread (both on the menu as 'Small Plates' but either one on it's own could have filled me! The flat bread was the winner on taste. It was delicious. Unfortunately, when it came time for the bill all hell broke loose. Despite telling our server a needed separate bills, he did not do it (I was a server for 8 years and I know that, although a tad time consuming, it isn't hard and makes payment much simpler). Â We had to wait an additional 20  minutes before he came back. So annoying! I'd be back for sure, just nor with more than 6 people."
Amora B.,"Richmond, United States",0,8,6,5.0,10/10/2014,Try the the shrimp pasta. mMMMMmm delicious!!
Kate B.,"Mission Viejo, United States",0,8,,3.0,10/11/2014,The food was delish! I had the Miso Salmon and my friend ordered Chicken Madera. I love all the food at the CF. Trying to get a table took over an hour and the waitress was scare and frazzled. Yummy food and mediocre service. Perhaps more staff would be the answer.
Monica M.,"Sacramento, United States",180,213,38,4.0,1/2/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top of Macy's in Union Square. We were seated on the patio Friday afternoon though there where clouds overhead, but the heat lamps kept us comfortable. What you can't help but notice are the pigeons walking around like they own the place. As soon as someone left the table to leave, the pigeons where all over it. Â Where else can you see pigeons fight over a piece of leftover cheesecake? Â The whip cream was flying!  Of course, with every Cheesecake Factory restaurant come the huge portion sizes. Â I ended up with a side salad and lunch sized pasta dish. Â Let's just say, that the pasta fed me for 2+ days after. Â   It did start to sprinkle right after we finished our salads and we went inside and were quickly seated before the heavens opened and it started to pour. The service was great and attentive though I was bummed I had to pass on their Blackout cake."
Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, United States",105,499,248,3.0,23/9/2010,"The wait is always long. I would come here for dessert only but I can't justify the wait :P  Their portion is monstrous but the food is not very good. I liked the dark rye bread though and I liked that they warm it up. I ordered their Caesar salad because I remembered it being one of the best Caesar salad I had. Maybe chef wasn't feeling well that day but my salad was...gross. The oil and cheese (I think and I hope) were separated; reminded me of rotten milk. And there was absolutely no flavor. The chicken to salad ratio was off and the chicken was dry and bland. Totally not what I remembered.  My boyfriend had one of their pasta with shrimp scampi and fresh diced tomatoes in an Alfredo sauce. It was good...much better than the salad but definitely not comparable to the pasta we had at Bella Trattoria.  Service was slow but pleasant. Good thing they gave us big mugs of drinks so we didn't have to ask for refills until our server popped up once in a while. Decor/Ambiance: same as any Cheesecake Factory. Warm, gold-ish dim lighting. Big pillars (the ones here are shorter). Ginormous booths. Lots of Â energy (rustle bustle)."
Tom L.,"Santa Clara, United States",410,480,171,2.0,7/11/2011,"I think there is a shorter waiting period Â to purchase a handgun in California than for a table at The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not a fan of the food here ... at all. The menu is huge, and everything they serve has the boring flavors you would expect from a large chain.  I am a fan of their cheesecake selection. Every piece looks like it will give you instant diabetes, but it's the price you have to pay for deliciousness. The Oreo Cookie cheesecake is the best, buy a piece for your girlfriend and she will forgive you for not going to Sex and the City 5 with her."
Vy L.,"San Francisco, United States",59,19,42,3.0,28/3/2011,"I've been here so many times and I've ordered so many birthday cakes from here so I thought I should write a review. This place would have been a 4 star except there is one thing that I absolutely HATE about it. Â It doesn't take reservations. Â Really? Â EVERY time that I'm here, I end up waiting at least an hour. Â I hate waiting and make reservations ALWAYS, but this place makes that impossible. As for food, I am addicted to their bread. Â It's ways so warm and soft (: Â As for the rest of the food, everything seems pricey but that's because portions are HUGE. Â Seriously. Â The pasta is about 4 meals for me. Â  Cheesecakes. Â Oh cheesecakes. Â I love cheesecake. Â This place definitely does not disappoint with all the flavors to choose from. Â I've also ordered whole cakes from here before for my birthdays and my brothers birthday. Â I have no complaints about the cheesecakes. It is decorated just like any other Cheesecake Factory, but a definite plus is the view of Union Square if you're seated outside. Â Service is usually good, but nothing amazing. Â  I'd come here if you don't mind the wait and want the view. Â Otherwise, I'd go to any other Cheesecake Factory."
Nick S.,"Alameda, United States",7,185,,1.0,1/4/2014,This Cheesecake Factory is not good. The service is slow. The food is not good. The food is overpriced. The place is aways a wait.
Emily W.,"San Francisco, United States",136,186,43,3.0,27/1/2012,"I think the wait just takes away EVERYTHING. Â I only go there when I get too lazy while shopping in downtown.  - The Wait -  The infamous wait is usually 45 min according to them, but you have to add at least 30+ minutes to that..  - Food -  The food is alright. Â It's a chain restaurant so there is not much to say about it. Â I once ordered their ""special"" Pillsbury Steak. Â I didn't really know what it was and the waiter did not explain at all. Â What I got was.. actually less than a Pillsbury steak.. It was comparable to my high school cafeteria meat loaf. Â  The Cheesecake is a must-order item, but it's one of those things that I would just take one bite and be done with. Â It's way to sweet and way too expensive for a slice of heartattack. - Staff - I once requested a ""window"" seat outside on the balcony and my waiter said yes and later let others take the table I was supposed to get... Â  - View -  Very good view from the balcony."
