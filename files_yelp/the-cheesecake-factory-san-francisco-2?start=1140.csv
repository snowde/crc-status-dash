feli p.,"Cincinnati, United States",0,7,,1.0,11/3/2014,"So sad about it. I went to the cheesecake factory in ohio and north carolina before and I loved it so much that I was so excited to go. Maybe to excited? We went fot my birthday. Our waiter was so slow. we had to wait half an hour to get seated - thats alright its always crowded. The table they gave us was really small. One of the forks on  my place was really dirty and the table didnt really looked cleaned at all.  That made me uncomfy right from the beginning. We ordered food and drinks at the same time, food was served first and we had to ask serval times for our drinks. The  broccoli which came with my chicken was undercooked, almost raw. Nobody asked about the food so I didnt get the chance to tell them. We barely saw our waiter. The table next to us left during their dinner and the one on the other one waited more than 3o min without anything just to order. At least the cheescake was alright. :("
Kristine K.,"San Francisco, United States",184,108,113,1.0,26/2/2014,"This review is for the blonde hostess. Asked for a table for two and the girl puts us in the smallest, most cramped table in the corner. At first I didn't mind it because there was no one next to our table but then she seats 3 guys to the table right next to us. Like seriously? There's so many other tables! So then we get asked to move and we move to a table on the other side. We try to put two small tables together to make a table for 4 and the hostess goes and asks and says we couldn't do that. So then we move again and the girl brings us to a table that fits 8! We asked for a bigger table but it didn't have to be that big. I don't know if she did it out of spite or to be funny but she wasn't very accommodating. She didn't even ask before she sat us if it was okay. She just showed us the table and walked away."
Kinner J.,"Napa, United States",41,145,43,4.0,3/1/2013,Love coming here for the grilled salmon lunch! It is very hard to resist the delicious cheesecake!!! TIP: Eat early or late because the wait can get VERY LONG. We came during the peak of the lunch hour and waited more than 30 minutes for an inside table. I have come in the past at odd hours and been seated almost immediately. If you go out onto the patio there are great views of Union Square. At Christmas time it is fun to look at all the lights and the large tree. When indulging I really like to get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake -- if you like chocolate you won't be disappointed!!! They also have seasonal cheesecakes that are very good (summer = mango keylime!)
Frank G.,"Sacramento, United States",373,286,93,4.0,19/12/2013,"In a rush to just eat somewhere, in the middle of a shopping trip in Union Square, with dozens of others needing or wanting to do the same, we were delightfully surprised at the quality of food, the service, and the atmosphere at this top of the city, above-the-ice-rink, above the square, restaurant. Though we were seated indoors to facilitate time, the outdoor views and seating, just outside our window, looked lovely and, even in December, seemed to work for many smiling people. Our wait wasn't bad at all and the staff was effective at handling such a demanding draw.I'm a vegetarian and was very pleased with the corn tamale cakes, which tasted almost like a veggie dessert. It may be listed as an appetizer, but I consumed it as my entree with appreciation for the chef."
Tim M.,"San Francisco, United States",114,125,36,4.0,24/7/2012,"I have to give this place better than 3 stars because Ive been here numerous times without a problem. Besides the fact that you cant make a reservation, this place in downtown-union square is nice. If you go for brunch I would recommend the eggs benedict or something along the lines of that... maybe a florentine (or w/e they call it there). They make a good benedict in my opinion. For lunch I usually order a salad/soup with a sandwich or Im feeling healthy and get one of their chicken plates. A side of creamy mashed potatoes is good too!  And DONT, i repeat DONT, forget to order one of their smoothies. Yeah, theyre expensive at $5-6 but theyre damn good! I always order one when I go there no matter what. They come with some skewered fresh fruits so I guess its all worth it 0.o Last but definitely not least is their outdoor seating that overlooks union square. Great view. If youre with 2-4 people than ask to be seated outside on a nice day, you'll enjoy it. Not sure if tourist know about the outdoor seating before hand but now you do!"
Soraya S.,"Novato, United States",7,5,1,4.0,1/4/2015,"i just love cheese cake, food is good large portions , good service, great location, one star less because they made me wait for like 30 mins to be seated , but i still enjoyed"
donna c.,"Greenbrae, United States",0,12,,5.0,5/6/2016,"Had the most amazing server at Cheesecake factory today! I have special dietary needs right now and went there to eat because I read online the soup of the day was Cream of Chicken.  I cannot have anything lumpy, only liquids.  When Pedro told us that the soup had artichoke hearts and mushrooms as well as bits of other veggies and chicken, I became very depressed and we were going to leave.  My husband and I have not been able to eat out for a month and Pedro made me feel so special by offering to have all the lumpy ingredients strained out so that we could enjoy a meal out together.  When my husband asked Pedro if he could please make sure the kitchen did just that, he came over and replied he would personally take care of my soup, so that I did not need to worry.  When he delivered the soup he made sure to ask me to please let him know if it was ok.  When he came back to our table to check i told him he made me feel very valued and special and he simply replied ""you are special""!  The best dining experience in a very long time!  Pedro you are truly 1 in a million! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. I only hope your employer knows how special you are!  OH and the soup was very tasty!"
Liz W.,"Boston, United States",136,276,227,4.0,14/11/2011,4 stars is only for the Hibachi Steak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is SO DELICIOUS.  I'm actually not a huge fan of the cheesecakes here....but maybe I just need to come here more and try different flavors.  It's always nice to enjoy views of union square while waiting...but dayum is this wait WAAAAAYYY TOOO LONG. you will probably keel over from starvation or blow up from anger before you are fed.  But....just get the hibachi steak and all bad feelings will dissipate....
Song C.,"San Francisco, United States",486,373,134,4.0,23/8/2010,"** Best to go on a week day. Worst to go on the weekends because of all the  shoppers and tourists. ** I think I celebrated a birthday here ... it was def on a week night. Too many good dishes to name but you can never go wrong with the burgers, steaks or pastas. If you are looking for a light meal, try the salmon.  Salads are gi-normous!  Chicken is always a safe bet. Tuna carpaccio and avocado egg rolls are the must haves!"
Elenie V.,"San Pablo, United States",292,82,27,5.0,17/7/2014,Was cool. Although I wish there were cheesecake samples because he ghiradelli chocolate cheesecake was too sweet and not good.
Stephen S.,"Chicago, United States",73,786,102,2.0,20/8/2012,"It's the cheesecake factory so you know what to expect in general. This location in particular is especially crowded which has always confused me in San Francisco when there are options galore. I was disappointed they wouldn't give me a taste of a wine by the glass prior to ordering it especially because the server had no idea how to describe a wine or any ability to provide recommendations. As I said, it's the cheesecake factory."
Bekkah R.,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",79,248,790,4.0,27/12/2013,"Le boyfriend and I came here for lunch yesterday after hiking and climbing at Baker Beach and were very pleasantly surprised. The food here is actually really good, especially considering that this is a chain restaurant. We ordered the warm asparagus salad, tomato&cheese flatbread, spicy chicken chipotle pasta and the fettucine alfredo with a strawberry milkshake and a oreo milkshake. For dessert we had the snickers cheesecake and the chocolate mousse cheesecake to go.  First off, when they say small plates, they actually mean small plates. The warm asparagus salad was a very small portion, but I could have eaten buckets of it. I love green asparagus! The tomato&cheese flatbread was all right, but you could make it better at home. The fettucine alfredo was good, I liked it, so did le boyfriend but he thought that I make it better at home. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it very much. The only downside was the amount of sauce. The pasta was drowning in sauce, so by the time I had finished the pasta, half the sauce was still on the plate. Which is a waste because then you're throwing away half of the delicious and creamy sauce. I just realised that I would now love to have that leftover sauce with some garlic bread for dipping. Why did I not think of this yesterday?? Anyway, on to the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Le boyfriend said: ""It's unlike any pasta I've ever had before. In a good way."" So that's some pretty high praise from him. :) And I must say, his plate did look delicious! Especially with the asparagus which I only realised at the end of the meal I would have loved to have had it with my pasta. Seriously, I love green asparagus.  As for the service. Our server, was sweet, friendly and helpful. He really deserved the tip. I know tipping is kind of the standard here in the U.S. but I still only tip when people actually deserve it. I can't remember our server's name though and don't have the receipt to check, but I hope he reads this and knows how much we appreciated him. So again, thank you for your wonderful service. Now, the cheesecakes. As you may know, cheesecake is my thing and I'm very picky about it. Considering that this is a chain restaurant I didn't have any expectations for the cheesecake, so I was pleasantly surprised by them. I liked them and even le boyfriend liked it and he used to hate cheesecake and will only eat the one my dad and I make. The first bite of the snickers cheesecake tastes a bit weird, but don't worry, the rest of it really does taste like snickers. And cheesecake, obviously. The chocolate mousse cheesecake is just dreamy. We both loved it and I would definitely order it again. So, to sum it up: surprisingly good food, friendly service and good cheesecake. I'll definitely come back here. If not on this trip, then definitely on our next trip to San Francisco. ;)"
Quyen T.,"San Francisco, United States",2,18,,4.0,27/8/2014,"Went here on a Tuesday night ! Nothing much to say 40 minute wait to get seats , I requested the roof with the side window and they were really accommodating. No matter who I spoke to at cheesecake, host, bidder, or waiter . Everyone was really nice and professional with their service so I can tell people here are well trained!  A little bit pricey a dish for 20$.  Love their Long Island ice tea!  Good dinner nice view good service and drinks! Did I mention free bread!!  Negative 1 star for the wait"
Luke S.,"Berkeley, United States",1,2,,4.0,26/8/2014,"Perfect location and if you sit outside,the view is so damn good.The starter bread is nice,I will definitely get more if I wasn't go there with another four people.Lunch is too much if you want some cakes,which is the must order.The only bad thing is that with so many people,waiting for a seat is the have-to."
Alicia A.,"El Sobrante, United States",120,183,299,3.0,14/3/2010,The thing about this location.. is the view from the balcony- quite romantic- when its not freezing cold.  Its also very classy.. with a bunch of mood light and over priced basic items like a cheese burger and fries.  But thats not why you go to the Cheese Cake Factory.. otherwise it would be the Burger Factory.. now wouldn't it? You go to eat 800 calorie and up - slice cheese cake.  Yum YUM. This is the part that freaked me out.. the fact that if you look at the cold case that holds the cheese cake.. each and everyone is labeled with the calories per slice.  I about had a heart attack once I noticed that.. how are you supposed to enjoy your indulgence.. if all you can think about is the freaking calories your eating?  You can't! Downgrade for the labeling of the cheese cake.. up grade for the excellent service and view..but ask for the balcony once it gets warmer.
Hannah W.,"Outer Richmond, San Francisco, United States",7,10,8,5.0,13/7/2014,"Excellent service despite the 1 hour wait to get a table! Got the balcony seat thankfully! It was a nice, breezy, weekday night and it was still extremely busy! Shoutout to our waiter, John (I think!?) who was only there on his 2nd day yet still did an even better than great job! I ordered some kind of pasta, with roasted tomatoes - I really do love tomatoes. And the sauce was very minimum, I thought that would be a problem until I realized how juicy the tomatoes were! Delicious! And the Cheesecake! Oh, don't even get me started on the cheesecake. Considering that I am very lactose sensitive and don't take in dairy products very well at all, I still insisted on trying their cheesecake and I did not regret it one bit. I had a very great experience at the Cheesecake Factory!"
John B.,"Stony Stratford, United Kingdom",0,15,1,4.0,20/10/2015,"So my second time in a week at this place and I've deducted a star. The food is still great and the staff are nice, even if they did get the order slightly wrong. However, the queuing thing was a bit of a joke today. When it was rammed at the weekend and there was a long wait, the delays made sense. Today, ten of the twelve tables in the outside roof terrace were empty and the inside was a ghost town. We still had to wait ten minutes to be seated on the terrace. Why? There were servers available. There was a full complement of kitchen staff (you can see them) so why did we have to wait? It's almost as though even if we were the only customers, we would still be made to wait. Very bizarre. On the positive, food good."
Justin L.,"San Jose, United States",280,51,42,4.0,7/12/2012,At this cheesecake factory they have a balcony sitting area that overlooks union square and we always wanted to sit there. The wait time wasnt that bad for a wednesday night and we had seats right by the edge. Our waiter was new to the job but he did a great job. He was friendly and he hooked it up with extra bread for us to take home.
Joanna P.,"Champaign, United States",9,16,20,4.0,1/5/2010,"Really? 3 stars only. I think its better than that... I came to SF in the middle of the summer and going to a place like this, I would expect so many people. And when me and my bf came here there were lots of people. As soon as we approached the desk to have our seats, the lady told us the expected time frame would be about 30-45 minutes if we choose to stay outside overlooking the beautiful union square. To my surprise we were called right away, say maybe 20 minutes or less. Again.. in middle of the summer with jammed packed people. No reservations either. The complimentary bread was good. We got chicken marsala and mushrooms and bang bang chicken & shrimp. The marsala was good...I've tasted better marsala before though but this isn't that bad. What I really like is the Bang-bang chicken & shrimp. If you like curry flavor stuff, this is for you. Chicken was tender (for both) and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, we didn't get any dessert because we were soo full. I would love to come back here again. You can't beat the view!"
Farah Z.,"San Francisco, United States",7,3,,3.0,31/7/2014,"The line is ridiculously long. The counter where they take reservations is always packed and crowded with people who're trying to put down their name. It's not really safe for people to be down there since waitress are trying to bus around. It's madness, but food is good. long wait, but good food."
