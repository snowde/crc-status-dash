Linna L.,"Los Angeles, United States",351,106,16,4.0,12/3/2012,"A Cheesecake Factory is just like any other Cheesecake Factory . . . except when the Cheesecake Factory sits on top of a Macys! Seriously, that and the lure of cheesecake are the only reasons why I would ever consider coming here.  It may seem like I'm ragging on this restaurant, but I have no real complaints.  I mean, it's just like any other chain restaurant: variety of food and drinks, nice decor, decent service, and solid food. But the experience of sitting out on the patio (if it's not that cold outside or if it is cold, and you can brave the cold) or even sitting next to the huge windows that look out into the patio makes the wait worth it! I know people often complain about the wait, but I think if you come here at like 6:00 on a weekday, you'll likely beat the dinner crowd and have your choice of tables. I would say this is definitely one of those places to take your out-of-town friends and family when they come visit the city. Not only is it in a really pretty part of town (next to the Tiffany's and Louis Vuitton stores), but there's a huge tourist draw. Imagine your friends saying: ""Yeah, [your name here] took me to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. It's right on the roof of Macys! Woah . . . it was such a cool experience. We even got to see seagulls hanging out on the roof's edge and got to take in the beautiful views of the city while we drank wine and had awesome cheesecake."" Yup, that would be bonus points for you."
Steve L.,"San Mateo, United States",833,684,1066,4.0,8/9/2009,"I really didn't want to come here for a pre-theatre dinner, but I got out voted by my daughter and her friend, with my wife as the swing vote.  If this like the other Cheesecake Factory, I expected the waits to be longer, and especially longer at this location. Well, since it was 4:30PM on a Sunday afternoon, I figured the wait should be tolerable. We were told a half hour wait, ended up being just 20 minutes.  Instead of being seated inside, were seated out on the terrace, overlooking Union Square. It was a sunny, mild afternoon, with a clear sky, and great view of Union Square, and the people walking on the streets below. I haven't ate outdoors in a Cheesecake Factory location in a long time. The last time was sitting dockside at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach. The alfresco dining at the Union Square location was reminding me of that location.  The food itself was OK, and the portions were massive as usual. This location doesn't have a kid's menu like other locations, but they do make kid's portions of what's one their menu.  -Kid-sized Fettuccine Alfredo: This was a pretty portion for kid size. It was cheesy and creamy, but unfortunately, some of the noodles weren't completely cooked, and some pieces were hard and chalky.  -Kid-Sized Four Cheese Pasta: Penne pasta with a marinara sauce made of Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Also a pretty hefty portion for kid size.  -Luau Salad: My wife had this the last time we were at a CF in Orlando. A very visually appealing salad of lettuce, cucumbers, grilled chicken, peppers, carrots, mangoes, mac nuts, and sesame seeds, all layered with large wonton strips.  -Wasabi crusted ahi: This was pretty large slab of seared ahi, placed on a parabolic shaped bed of rice. Ahi crust was bread crumbs, made green with wasabi. I really looking for a little bite from the wasabi, but didn't taste it. Also came with side of vegetables in a miso sauce. It as more of a buttery sauce than a miso sauce, but was still good.  Of course we couldn't pass up the cheese cakes ( )  -30th Anniversary: Cheesecake layered with chocolate cake, and with chocolate chips and crispies on the frosting. Topped with chocolate ganache and lots of whipped cream  -Double Oreo Mudslide: Chocolate cheesecake with Oreos mixed in, topped with chocolate ganache and whipped cream. This was good! perfect for chocoholics.  -Key Lime: Needed something other than chocolate. Slightly tart and refreshing cheesecake with a graham cracker crust. Again with lots of whipped cream.  The downside of eating outside in the sun was that the cheesecakes softened very quickly, and started to become a floppy mess. But by then, we were already full from the cheesecake, and done eating.  No complaints on the service. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the other servers who brought out our food were very efficient.  As I said earlier, the food itself is OK, about the same consistency as the other locations, and would be a 3 star.  However, I'd bump it up another star for the perfect weather that day, which made it a happy and pleasant dining experience for us."
David C.,"San Francisco, United States",3,26,,4.0,6/1/2013,"The herb salmon they have is pretty good. The herbs gives that salmon fillet an extra ""bam""! The second thing they have here that's worth coming here for is of course, their signature Cheesecake.  Although I've read from reviews and heard from my personal friends that this place wait for the food is LONG, but I guess luckily for me I just came at the right time. This place is located in Union Square (Macy's) and to get here you literally take the elevator. Great view depending where your seated, which is the reason why it's crowded during the day from all the tourists."
Suki B.,"Oakland, United States",261,282,234,4.0,29/12/2011,"Although, I usually like to stay away from chain restaurants...I'm a sucker for Cheesecake Factory!  Their Chicken Madeira is simply amazing and their Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake is seriously a piece of sugary HEAVENNNN! You can never go wrong by going here."
Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, United States",672,313,59,4.0,29/1/2012,"Normally, I'd give a Cheesecake Factory a three-star review, but what sets this one apart is the stunning view over San Francisco. Located on the top floor of the Macy's Building, you can sit on the balcony and overlook the entire city. Simply gorgeous. Aside from that, it's a Cheesecake Factory like any other. The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy. The restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation. Service is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy. The food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that. Honestly, I doubt that it was even inspired by a Mandarin dish! Hard to avoid the cheesecake at the end of the meal, too! I think my favorite is the Oreo cookie cheesecake! Definitely puts a good end to the meal! Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and isn't anything too special. There are some items on their menus that I like well enough, but there are also a lot of items on the menu that I meet with a resounding ""meh."" Commentary on the Cheesecake Factory aside, this particular location really benefits from stunning views over San Francisco, and that's ultimately what salvages this location from what would otherwise be a three-star review."
Georges B.,"Oakland, United States",11,122,,4.0,5/3/2015,"The best thing about this place is the view. Other than that, it's your average Cheesecake Factory: very large portions, average quality food, good drinks, above average desserts."
Brendan J.,"Los Angeles, United States",51,365,72,3.0,31/7/2010,"The bottom line about this cheese cake factory - Customer service - slow b/c its always busy. But the servers are pretty cool and nice. The management takes your comments on their website pretty seriously . I received a call a few days after I commented about something not being good.  - The food - good quantity.  - The cheese cake - my personal favorite (drum role) ""'The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake"" - Parking - is tough in downtown SF. If you find a spot consider your self very lucky and dont push your luck with anything else the rest of your day.  - Long Wait - every time I have been here I have been here, its been atleast an hour wait. Try the bar if you cant wait that long. You may get lucky."
Emi K.,"San Francisco, United States",300,162,19,3.0,29/7/2010,"Hmmm I've been to this place two times.  Both times, we had to wait for about an hour.  It was super crowded both times that me and my bf went.   The first time, we went for dinner.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, i LOVE this! it's soo good =] Then my bf ordered some kind of pasta and I had a turkey burger.  It was okay. Not the greatest. I don't see whats so good about this place o.O it reminds me of Elephant Bar or something similar lol The 2nd time we went was during lunch.  I thougth it would be fun to try to eat outside in the patio.  It was a SUNNY day in SF.  Boy was it so wrong to sit outside.  There was pidgeons everywhere. I nearly lost my appetite as they walked by, flew by above my head, and watched you eat. It was HOT and really uncomfortable for my bf and I. I am never eating outside again.  But next time, I come here, I shall try the salmon =]"
J S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,24,,1.0,18/3/2012,Service was very poor! my entree was not hot and we waited for over an hour to be seated!!! I will not return here. this place needs alot of work. The cheesecake was not even that good. I hae eaten at several Cheesecake Factory's throughout the US and they hae never disappointed.  Scratch this one off your list!
Jorge L.,"Campbell, United States",0,1,1,5.0,9/9/2014,"Ashley the waitress was amazing, the wait was a little long but the service was excellent."
Camellia S.,"Los Angeles, United States",581,163,50,2.0,5/9/2012,"Other than the view, this place is not the best option for a nice meal in SF! The service was extremely slow, the place was extremely crowded, the food was cold, the pasta totally undercooked, and the staff just seemed confused and panicked. We were seated outside, even though it was cold. We asked them to turn on the heater but that took a while.  I ordered the Pasta da Vinci and it was totally undercooked. I like my pasta cooked al dente but this was overdoing it!  Although this spot offers up a gorgeous view and a superb photo opportunity, it still doesnt meet my expectations when it comes to food spots in the city."
Aja S.,"Pinole, United States",8,29,,3.0,18/6/2012,"SO my friend and I decided to come here to have lunch....well more like ""hors d'oeuvre"" during lunch hours. By the time we reached the restaurant, the place was already packed!!!! As for drinks I started with a passion fruit mojito, and whats ""special"" about it is that it happens to be my first time trying it. When I first sipped into that drink of goodness, I immediately blown away on how delicious it tasted! it was fresh, minty, cool, tropical, sweet, and tarty..this wont be last time ordering it ever again. Ok I'm gonna stop raving about mojitos :)         Appetizers and Small Snacks was what we ordered just because we wanted lots of variety! and indeed we did get lots of variety. As a matter of fact we ordered so much variety that it filled up the table (that takes up 4 people space wise). In no particular order we ordered their buffalo chicken wings, that were covered in some tobasco like hot sauce. It also comes with a blue cheese dressing, and I HATE blue cheese so we asked to have ranch instead. However after dipping celery (came with the wings) in this so called ""ranch"" I realized it wasn't ranch at all, but BLUE CHEESE DRESSING!!  I was like ""nooo! tip reduction!!""...-joking- I just let it slip by and besides it saved me a few calories right?? chicken wings in general were alright nothing to jump up and down about.   Vietnamese tacos were delish! the pork, and the pickled vegetables make a perfect couple. Only I wish the pork was tender, instead it was stringing and a little dry. Artichoke and Crab was alright, I tasted better at other places. It was a little bland, with too much cheese and actually spotted a blot of cream cheese in the middle of the dip. I guess I can now say so that's part of their ingredient to making it creamy. Last but not least, Fried Calamari! Out of all the dishes we ordered my favorite was the fried calamari! it came with cocktail sauce, and some mayo/lemon/dill sauce. Calamari tasted fresh even though they were most likely frozen, I even spotted some cute little small tentacle calamari babies which I was pretty amused to see. Batter over it was bland, without the sauces my palate would've eaten dead bland calamari minions."
Brian H.,"Benicia, United States",66,94,28,4.0,30/6/2014,"i enjoy coming to the cheesecake factory in San Francisco.  The food is good and the service is excellent.  It can be busy so be prepared to have a relatively short wait.  The Cheesecake is why we come and enjoy the menu.   We usually sit in the bar, you can people watch, watch TV usually sports and enjoy."
Ruby E.,"Orange Park, United States",20,3,2,1.0,2/9/2011,"My friend and I visited this establishment during our weekend vacation to this beautiful city.  Being in San Francisco, we had a plethora of dining choices of which to choose - but we decided to meet our friends at the Cheesecake Factory because of its extensive menu, late hours and excellent view/location. We came to regret that decision.  After being treated extremely rudely by our waiter, ""Adam J"", we decided to complain to management.  We were directed to the Assistant General Manager, Ed Miller.  As we watched him approach our table, we saw him briefly discuss the situation with Adam and roll his eyes.  When he arrived at our table, his first words were ""I apologize for what you guys think happened"". We were shocked and disgusted by the manner in which Ed approached us.  He was obviously already on the defensive because he did not want to take the time to listen to the situation.  And the situation did not improve.  After Ed dismissed our complaints without even a slight show of genuine remorse, we quickly gathered our things and departed the restaurant.  As we were leaving the dining area, we joined another dining party in the elevator.  They too were complaining about the ill treatment that they were given! We were a party of 4, plus a 2-year old child.  We were all over the age of 30.  We were a happy group that just wanted to enjoy the view, a good meal and a bottle of wine.  I have never encountered such a rude, unhappy waiter paired with an equally unhappy, unprofessional and bullheaded manager.  It is obvious to me that the wait staff at this location needs additional training in the field of customer service.  I have never had any complaints about a Cheesecake Factory - until now."
Anna V.,"Livermore, United States",441,56,38,2.0,15/12/2011,"Positives: awesome outdoor terrace overlooking union square, food is satisfactory and the waiters do seem to try to help Downside: it's so big, there's so many people (employees and customers both) and therefore customer service sucks! Once we got our table, it took us 2hrs and 25 minutes to complete our meal and we were with our 3 & 5 year old kids so it was quite torturous for that last hour!  We even ordered our meals within 5 mins of sitting down and ordered our dessert within 10 mins of getting our food. Very disappointing experience."
Angelica D.,"Oakland, United States",181,112,247,4.0,6/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one place you'll have to try at least once. Love their avocado eggrolls! And, of course, the cheesecake! They have a pretty wide selection of food, but if you're goal is the cheesecake, I'd suggest eating somewhere else first (or at least well in advance), because you won't have any room by the end of your meal for any of that cheesecake goodness. It's also in a great location and was one of the few decent places nearby powell that are still open around 10:30 p.m. During peak hours, it gets really busy, and you'll want to come early if you have any hope of getting seated."
Rodney T.,"Oakland, United States",29,11,4,2.0,22/10/2014,"Went out with two friends and since we were in Union Square we decided to try the Cheesecake Factory. Ordered Halibut and it was not good; indeed, it was dry and wasn't very appealing at all. There is nobody to blame but myself, I should expect fresh at the Fish Market or at a local restaurant that specializes in seafood but not at a Chain restaurant. I'll probably go back but I wouldn't order the same selection."
Victoria L.,"Daly City, United States",19,14,5,5.0,15/7/2014,"I love the big portions they have every time I go and visit. I remember the last time, my sister, mother, nephew and I went, we ordered a kid's pizza, a pasta and cheesecake. We were extremely full! Love the service and where it's located. They're easy to reach and in the middle of a place to shop!"
Bonnie G.,"The Haight, San Francisco, United States",49,44,8,3.0,11/5/2012,"You'll wait forever for a menu too full of options and get a seat near really loud people from Georgia and stuff your face with tasty but basic foods that cost too much. Yep, they have cheese cake that tastes like it came from a factory. The outdoor seating that looks over Union Square will impress your Grandad visiting from Wyoming. Great for tourists, nothing special for foodies or natives."
Carolina S.,"San Francisco, United States",33,265,17,3.0,8/7/2010,"I'm honestly thinking of giving them less than three stars and here are my reasons why. If you've read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm one more for quality than quantity. It's not that I'm trying to give people less food for their buck, but if you can give me as in my last case with them a $10 omelet with breakfast potatoes and toast, then please give me a healthy meal, please, I'm not trying to consume food for two people! Most Americans are not pregnant!  Don't get me wrong, the omelet (Californian- with avocado, mushrooms, three types of cheeses etc) was divine, but FOUR EGGS! REALLY? Two slices of toast AND breakfast potatoes? It should have been mandatory to have some kind of fruit plate in that platter and some kind of bulky green in the omelet. How else are you supposed to consider downing this as just lunch? Because of the thickness in the omelet, I was only able to consume half of it while still having half of my toast and my potatoes.  If you come here and have never experienced a Cheesecake Factory, please be aware, it's a high tourist trap, especially in this city where the city views from the balcony are actually worth having a drink or two. With that said, possibly the best and most authentic food I've tasted here has been the cheesecakes, which I'll always get to go for parties, special occasions and what not. But as I say, if you're looking for authentic Asian cuisine, or for that matter, a normal sized platter, don't stop here as the service tends to be slower than normal."
