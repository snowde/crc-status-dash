Pam S.,"Upland, United States",589,656,482,3.0,16/12/2009,"First of all it is the typical Cheesecake Factory as far as menu goes... the wait is ALWAYS incredibly long so when we go we plan to sit at the Bar no further expectations than that. You can either take the escalators or the elevators. The view is breathtaking and truly a urban experience as far as getting the ""feel"" of the city. I recommend sitting outside at least once. The service at the Bar is always rushed for the Bartenders as they are handling drink orders for the tables as well. Our drinks were strong and tasty and the appetizers we ordered were plentiful. I do suggest if you venture up to the top floor of Macy's to try this Cheesecake Factory - come with the mindset that you will more than likely have a wait but hey your in one of the most beautiful cities in world enjoy the experience go browsing in Macy's... although I am not sure the pagers work that far =/ Respectfully Reviewed"
Chloe J.,"Hilo, United States",31,5,,3.0,13/7/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is delicious but this location is so busy. I always get the farfalle chicken pasta or the steak diane. Service is good and the food is good but because of the location the wait gets long and they don't take reservations either.
LEIGH-ANN T.,"Fair Oaks, United States",0,15,2,1.0,29/8/2015,Haven't even been served water but am so ready to walk out. Must have patience or Valium to eat here!
Nando G.,"Placerville, United States",0,12,16,4.0,29/9/2015,Great location. Nice ambience and friendly staff. Food is good and portions are pretty generous. Prices are very reasonable given their large portions and their awesome location
Benjamin I.,"San Francisco, United States",54,288,42,5.0,16/3/2014,"Every time that I have been to The Cheesecake Factory here in town, I have really enjoyed the experience.  The atmosphere really couldn't be any better (sitting on a terrace overlooking Union Square), the service is as friendlier than most restaurants in town, and the food is good, reasonably priced, and always consistent."
Yuliem D.,"San Leandro, United States",10,29,,4.0,18/3/2012,"I loved the food and prices are reasonable for the portions.  Only reason it gets a 4 is because our waiter kept forgetting about us, which is understandable since this is a bit of a touristy place and it's always busy but then again, that's why you hire more people right?"
Adelina W.,"San Francisco, United States",171,413,693,2.0,14/5/2012,"I don't love it, but I don't hate it. The line is always long. If you think you can skip the line and eat at the bar, think again. That's equally as packed as the waiting area. The menu choices are abundant. You're overwhelmed with the choices and the portion size that you really don't have room for cheesecake. The service is lacking, good luck finding someone to help you get anything here but they're quick with the check. My advice is to just come by if you want cheesecake. Put your order in at the takeout window and head to Union Square to eat it."
Florence D.,"Oakland, United States",83,123,7,1.0,26/2/2012,"I guess it is hard to write this review without addressing my slight bias towards large chain restaurants in the middle of neighborhoods that are home to so many delectable, local spots.... Now that that's off my chest, I can start my review. The wait time was about 45 minutes, but we were told it was going to be about 25 minutes. Once our buzzer thing went off, I was directed to ""wait over there"" with a large group of other people waiting to get seated by a hostess. After 5 more minutes of waiting, we were brought to our table set for 4. But we were a group of 5..... No, sorry, bringing up a chair to stick at the end of booth sized for 4 isn't going to cut it. So, after waiting a few more minutes, we were brought to a table that was meant for really 5 people. Our waiter took our orders, and told us that the kitchen was backed up for about 30 minutes, but he ""wasn't really supposed to tell us that."" So yes, service took really long.... My salad came, with a scant few slices of chicken inside. We renamed it the hidden treasure salad instead. Glad my only reason to come here was to accomodate a picky eater... Definitely will NOT go back again. I will not regret it!"
Candace M.,"Charleston, United States",2,32,4,4.0,5/7/2014,"Typically not a chain eater on trips, BUT we were looking for something close and open late near Union Square.  The Thai lettuce wraps are always a favorite, and the beet salads was great.  Finished off with a Oreo cheesecake, so all and all....a good night."
Christine L.,"Manhattan, United States",2,8,,3.0,22/8/2014,The food is good and so is the cocktail. The service is good as well. But the price is more than it should be. I would recommend to try the cheesecakes and nothing else.
Star B.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, United States",83,54,4,3.0,28/5/2014,"It's just an average restaurant with a great view... The food is nothing special, but I could see why two years ago when I first moved to SF I thought it was so great..."
Janine R.,"Calgary, Canada",175,644,160,3.0,3/7/2012,"Wow this restaurant is busy! Thank goodness our hotel called ahead of time and bumped us up on the waiting list. I didn't find the food that great. It was average, and that's why I'm giving them an average rating. They have really good cheesecake and delicious bread, but the entree was so-so. The service was incredibly slow, it's a good thing we were on vacation or I would have probably been more upset.  I don't know if this restaurant is worth the hour wait to get in....."
Lawrence G.,"San Francisco, United States",1540,20,,4.0,18/2/2015,"I would say the best place to eat when your going on a date, anniversary or taking your significant other for lunch or dinner time, bcause they have a variety of lunch and dinner dish available to order & eat people! My favorites dishes would be their Italian Spaghetti w/ cheese and meat sauce, I really like the taste of their side Ceazar Salad w/ chilcken along w/ ranch sauce!!! I also like ordering that along with their raspberry iced tea and getting two bottles of Corona Beers is amazing combination - the atmosphere is really good in the afternoon especially when your table is outside on the balcony area overlooking the city view of downtown San Francisco & at night time when your w/ your girlfriend, special partner or close friends - its a very romantic place w/ good servers, great atmosphere, & the restaurant set up is really nice like the lighting, set up of the tables, & location of the bar is awesome right on the center of the place when you walked in you cant miss it fellas/ladies... The servers really care about how you feel & they check on you on how you like the food that you order, & ask you about if there is other things like desserts or drinks you want to order, so they can assist you & your company! I recommend & gives this place two thumbs up, and my own experiences here has been pleasant, fantastic, and my friends and I really enjoy & love this place!!! =)"
Anji W.,"San Francisco, United States",785,202,1755,4.0,30/11/2011,"The drinks were good and the food was delicious. We came on a sunny day and sat outside. The service was good as well. The waiting time was kinda long, but at least we had a great view and good company. So overall, pretty awesome day! ^_^"
Ashley P.,"San Francisco, United States",54,93,10,3.0,23/2/2012,"I've been here a number of times- with the guy and with family and friends.  The thing about this place...it's food IS good, but you need to know when to go. Being that we're in SF, and this CF is located in Union Square...nighttime/weekends are ALWAYS packed. I've waited 90 minutes before for a table. Lunchtime is much better in terms of waiting. Despite the wait time, I've never encountered a rude or unpleasant waiter/ress. The staff is usually pretty prompt and attentive- amazing, considering how slammed they always are. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer is PDA. Try it! They also make a mean Long Island Iced Tea, IMO. Overall, this place is nice to go to periodically- but there's so many other places out there to explore with shorter wait times and diverse selections. :)"
Rachel H.,"San Francisco, United States",83,399,3,4.0,25/8/2012,"This place never disappoints. The service is always top notch, and the waiters never rush you. The views are also pretty cool, especially during Christmas time. I always get three things when I come here, which are the hot caramel apple cider, the chicken di pana, and the Hershey cheesecake.  The only downside to this place is the wait time. Good thing I can shop while waiting!"
Noor M.,"Champaign, United States",10,68,36,2.0,21/7/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. It has some exquisite cheesecakes and thats it. Most of their entrees are overpriced and taste average at best, the restaurant is also crowded and extremely noisy, yet most of us insist of dining here. Is it the beautiful view, overlooking Union Square that attracts us, or then, is it just the thought of going to the famous ""cheesecake factory"" which coaxes us into wasting our money? The wait varies between 10 minutes to 45 minutes. During this time, one can go order drinks at the bar, or then, wait around staring at the view. Once seated, we are presented with a basket of delicious breads and a some butter.  Most of the dishes are over-priced (as I mentioned before) and the presentation is nothing fantastic, either, however, the helpings tend to be HUGE. Now that we are smarter (after having been to Cheesecake Factory several times) My husband and I tend to order one appetizer, one main course and one dessert.  The dishes were have tried are -  Potato Soup - - don't bother ordering it Clam Chowder - - not bad  Fettuccini Alfredo  - - absolutely bland Shrimp with Angel Hair - - shrimp were tiny but well seasoned Fresh Grilled Salmon - - pretty standard Shrimp Scampi - - once again, pretty standard Fish and Chips - - below average The desserts we have tried -  Linda Fudge Cake - -  must try The original cheesecake - - delicious and oh-so-light 30th Anniversary chocolate cheesecake - - perfection Godiva Chocolate cheesecake - - I think I died and went to chocolate heaven Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake - - mmm... Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake - - scrumptious Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake - -  my new favorite! The drinks we have tried -  hot chocolate - - delicious strawberry lemonade - - out of the box lemonade - - weirdly sweet I would recommend that you go to enjoy the view and the dessert, possibly having dinner somewhere else before coming here; it'll be easy on your stomach and your wallet. Overall rating - 3/4"
William P.,"Oakland, United States",6,11,1,1.0,30/9/2011,"This place is not what it used to be.  I was sad and disappointed.  A few friends went for a birthday party.  When we first got there the hostess told us that the wait would be 20-30 mins.  No biggie, we went to the bar and got a few drinks while waiting.  When our pager finally went off, we took our drinks with us. The server from the bar chased us down and told us that we had to pay before we left. He said that it was too difficult for him to transfer our drinks to our table.  That's different. We've always been able to bring our drinks with no problems.  Not wanting to argue, we decided to close out our tab.   So when we got to the hostess counter, they took the pager and made us wait another 10 mins.  Why page us if you're going to make us wait some more?  Anyway, we were finally shown our table. Our server seemed pretty attentive in the beginning.  Giving us adequate time to review the menus and then took our order.  This is where my biggest disappointment came.  I had ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta.  When the dish came, it had almost no shrimp on it. And the shrimp that was on it looked like it was from what you would use to make a shrimp salad.  The shrimps were the size of nickels. Thoroughly disappointed.   My friend ordered the Pasta Marinara and had to send it back 2 times because it was too salty to eat. They comped her food but by the time her food finally was edible, the rest of us were done eating.   By now our server has disappeared and is nowhere to be found.  We had to flag down someone else to box our leftovers.  And instead of bagging it for us, she just threw us the boxes.  When we were finally done, we had to stand in the long line to take the elevators to the ground floor because the escalators were blocked off.   I don't think I'll be coming back here again. I was hoping for good food and service which I've always gotten, but instead the bad service and mediocre ingredients just left me sad and disappointed."
Greg G.,"Alameda, United States",1435,408,1580,3.0,10/7/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is the ULTIMATE 3 STAR restaurant.  It isn't great, but it doesn't totally stink. You can slice it right down the middle. Pros: The place is grand. Everything here is big. The restaurant decor has a fine dining feel while still clearly being incredibly casual. The view of Union Square is nice. The menu is HUGE, and there are (probably) literally hundreds of options to choose from. Portion size is big- too. Free bread baskets are warm- and the cheesecake is awesome. Cons: This place is SO big that it takes forever for a waiter to reach you. There are tourists (with KIDS) constantly banging on the booth directly behind you. Even though the menu is so huge, EVERYTHING tastes similar. All pastas taste the same- all Mexican options taste similar. Prices are high. This place is awesome if you have a gift card- but if you go expect to drop at least $60-$80 (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 cheesecake). Expect your food to be good, but don't get anything similar to what your date is getting or it will taste the same. Expect to enjoy yourself, but to wait forever for your water to be refilled since there are SO many other guests eating here, too."
Nathaniel M.,"Poulsbo, United States",14,14,13,3.0,29/1/2011,"The food was just alright, but nothing amazing.  I had the Jamaican Shrimp and I think I was expecting it to be a lot better than it was.  It was also supposed to come with grilled plantains, but they didn't make it onto the plate (more on that later). We shared the Thai Lettuce appetizer and it was very very good, although a little messy.  You'll have to go wash your hands after you're finished with it.  Perfect size for two people. The service was so-so.  After our waitress brought our food out we didn't see her again until she brought the bill.  I wanted to ask her about the grilled plantains not coming out, but she never came back to check on us.  I asked when she brought the bill, and she gave me a free piece of cheesecake because of it, which was nice. Looking back on it now, with all the amazing restaurants in SF, I would have rather eaten somewhere else."
