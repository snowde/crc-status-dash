Kathy D.,"San Francisco, CA",2,33,10,4.0,8/21/2017,"We went around 3:30 & waited for about 15 minutes. Me and my friend got two appetizers. The fried cheese was a bit bland but definitely satisfied our cravings and the cuban roll was so flavorful! For the pasta, I got the farfalle. It was a big portion and I felt like they added too much sauce. Other than that, everything was fine. Good service."
Sheryl M.,"Danville, CA",110,374,55,1.0,6/25/2017,"Walked up to get a table for (3). There were (5) employees behind the counter and not one made eye contact or acknowledged our presence for at least (2) minutes. Even once we were acknowledged the lady was not very friendly. So, we were off to a rude start.  Once seated, it took about (5) minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink orders. Once that was done, it took another (5-10) minutes to actually get said drinks.  We finally ordered and we got a burger, veggie burger and flat bread. Nothing wow'd any of us.  The food and service are much to be desired. Bottom line is, due to the location, they clearly don't care about customer service because they don't have to.  The totality of this experience is one reason I don't eat at chain restaurants often."
Amin S.,"Wilshire Center, Los Angeles, CA",113,10,10,4.0,6/30/2017,"Our server Ronda was fantastic. Super polite, friendly and smiling the whole time. I recommend sitting outside it's wonderful and warm till the sun goes down then it gets cold really fast"
Bon B.,"Oakland, CA",4,48,,2.0,10/3/2017,"Horrible food.  Horrible service.  Franchise restaurants are not good.  Our waiter came and asked what we wanted to drink. His whole demeanor was do direct and rude.   He later came and plopped his elbows on our table and asked what we wanted to eat. He didn't write anything down. Nor did he ask if we were here to celebrate, which we were, for a bday.  Later he comes back and introduced our real waiter, who had been on break. Thank goodness!  But our waiter never came around. It wasn't a busy evening. But we sat there for ten minutes waiting for him to walk by so that we could get our bill.  Maybe he sensed our dissatisfaction with the entire place bc he didn't offer us the dessert menu.  I could not wait to leave. But I had to wait because I had to wait for the waiter so I could ask for the check. I got a bonus too....a hard piece of string(????) in the mashed potato that came with the herb crusted salmon that wasn't even fresh. Didn't bother boxing up the leftovers.  Yuck."
Holmes B.,"Mooroolbark, Australia",0,18,,4.0,11/10/2017,It would score 5 stars if they allowed bookings!!!  The food is delicious and you can take any guests there who are picky eaters and are guaranteed they will like something. Portions are massive and prices are fair and they let you take home leftovers which is fabulous. Every cheesecake flavor has been amazing except for the original strawberry which is a massive shame since it is most popular.  The waiters have been excellent every time we have gone and service was prompt however we went at off times.  You can see how quickly trying to get a table would be an absolute nightmare in busy periods. They need to figure out a better system fast and at least allow a certain amount of bookings. We would go more often and with guests if we knew we could organize a table easier.
Madeline X.,"Oakland, CA",4,11,8,3.0,10/3/2017,This was by far my worst experience ever I love this place and the food is great and in GIANT portions but the waiter was TRASH he just gave us our things and left right away he didn't even write down my order
Fanny W.,"San Francisco, CA",16,31,19,5.0,12/14/2016,"I typically avoid this place Friday nights and weekends in the evening. So dinner on Thursday before 6pm was great. Barely any wait time for a table. Service is usually great, most people are pretty attentive except for our waitress that night. She only checked up on us about once? It didn't bother us too much until we were trying to flag her down to grab some boxes and the check. Food is ALWAYS great and the portions are HUGE. It was my first time ordering cheesecake for dessert and it was a mistake to order two slices, one for me and my boyfriend. Neither one of us ate more than half. We need to keep in mind to share the next time around."
Shubhra P.,"Union City, CA",0,3,6,4.0,8/25/2017,Amazing Cheesecake. Chipotle Pasta is a must try.  Food is amazing here. Our server Katie was nice. We got seat pretty quickly given it was a Friday evening. Will definitely try again
Liberty A.,"San Francisco, CA",20,28,329,5.0,1/1/2017,Cheesecake heaven! Superb view of Union Square. Line can get too long but usually moves pretty fast.
Lawrence A.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, CA",91,2,,5.0,12/23/2017,Nick gave us great great great service. Was a busy day because of the holiday season but still had a good amount of time for our table. Gave us everything we needed and gave us recommendations on where to go in the area. The wait was shorter than expected and the food was worth the price. Thank you Nick
Lindsay C.,"Kennesaw, GA",1,12,6,3.0,11/8/2017,"I only gave this three stars because the food was good, but the service left much to be desired. I went to this location with a group of 4 (including myself) after a long day at a conference. Our waitress never so much as cracked a smile and seemed rather annoyed that we were taking up space in her section. We all had empty glasses and only one of us got a refill and that was only because he specifically asked for one. She didn't even bring us back our check after we paid - another waiter brought it over, even though our waitress was clearly still working since she stopped by the table to next to us within minutes of our check coming back. We never got a single thank you (other than the scribble on the receipt) or any sign that we were welcome customers. Seriously very disappointing."
Morgan M.,"Denver, CO",182,251,2071,4.0,12/31/2016,"This location is actually in Macy, it's very busy like every other one. We only waited 30 min for lunch on a Wednesday. Our server was friendly, service is kinda slow but not bad. The Chinese chicken salad was amazing and huge for the lunch portion, I can't imagine what the whole portion would be ! Pretty location ! It would be fun to sit outside and over look the city !"
Shenna J.,"Washington, DC",23,100,16,3.0,7/1/2017,Super packed and busy for a Saturday afternoon. Not a fan of the service and the crowd.
Ann D.,"Apex, NC",8,25,,4.0,11/4/2017,"This was our go to for a couple of meals while in San Francisco. The staff were very friendly. We enjoy this restaurant although stay with the cheaper fare such as hamburgers. We made the mistake of ordering filet mignon steaks and they were not of high quality and way under cooked. The staff was very nice to try and fix it, but overall this is not the place you order a steak. We always enjoy cheesecake though and so after one meal we did order some and it was good. A little on the dry side but good."
Rachel D.,"Cincinnati, OH",174,230,262,4.0,12/22/2016,"My boyfriend and I go to the Cheesecake Factory every year on our big holiday shopping day, and after a day on your feet hitting every store, the huge meal here is always a treat. Also nice, no matter what city you're in, you always know what you're going to get. I got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and he got the meatloaf. I'd probably stick with some of my favorites next time (shepherds pie, any burger, or the wasabi steak) but he was super happy with his meatloaf. We ended with the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake which was amazing!! Definitely would recommend! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is our waitress didn't bring us the brown bread with the oats on it, she only brought the sourdough (good, but the brown one is my favorite :)) will definitely be back!"
Kirsten V.,"Vacaville, CA",28,44,24,1.0,5/20/2017,"We've been to this restaurant many times while staying downtown and this was the worst. We had the usual Saturday night wait of an hour and then more waiting for the food. My husband had the wrong burger brought out which was rectified when the server showed up with the right one.  However my daughter's pasta never showed up. When the server realized he disappeared for a while and when he came back asked if the manager had stopped by. Nope. NEVER heard word one from the manager. NEVER offered any compensation for waiting another half hour for her meal to show up. Rather than wait any longer or ask for the manager to make an appearance we paid the bill and left. I usually try not to dock the waiter for a kitchen screw up, but felt we had no choice this time. I think the manager owes his waiter the remainder of the tip for not attending to a customer who was inconvenienced. The cherry on top of all this was when I went to use the ladies restroom. Paper towels overflowing from the trash bins and no toilet paper. Women were grabbing paper towels before they went in. Ugh!"
Jeff L.,"Long Beach, CA",2,9,1,3.0,10/28/2017,"Poor service. The blonde hostess was rude and immature. The food was horrible, bread was non existent for 45 minutes waiting due to a shortage. Who gives 5 pieces of chicken the size of a millimeter/dime when it costs extra? Which apparently is a pre portioned 5 oz. Usually I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I guess the chef smoked too much weed to go with all the burnt bacon, the San Francisco treat. Also it was a struggle to get water. It's 9pm on a Saturday night. Keep this in mind. But the manager was nice and took note of the food being under par"
Ferran A.,"South of Market, San Francisco, CA",73,5,9,5.0,6/11/2017,"Amazing salmon and pasta with shrimps, with a great rooftop with a view to Union Square. Is not expensive at all for the high quality food and the location. Don't forget to try the cheesecake of course!"
Pierre R.,"Pleasanton, CA",2,7,,1.0,9/6/2017,"Let's keep this short like their service and sweet like their views.  Pros: Terrace views* Cons: Terrible service, mediocre good, *pigeons all over the terrace"
Nadav H.,"Waldo, FL",0,39,8,5.0,10/25/2017,"I really liked this restaurant. Despite its name, you don't need to eat a cheesecake there, or any cake. None of us did. They actually have a huge menu with all sorts of food, so everyone will find some they like. The restaurant is at the 8th floor, so if you can find a table outside (you'll need to be lucky), you'll enjoy the view."
