Iris L.,"Newark, United States",0,57,,3.0,20/7/2014,"View is good, cheesecake are delicious, but food is just so so, besides there are always a long long line waiting for seats. Not recommended"
Andrew A.,"San Francisco, United States",113,35,,4.0,1/5/2012,"Awesome food at an even better price. Just make sure you eat before you get on the wait list.  I've literally put my name down on the list just to go back to Union Square for happy hour at a nearby restaurant. After loading up on drinks and appetizers, we proceeded back to Westfield to kill some time. After we finished walking around, we went back to Macys to walk around some more. We were finally seated after a two hour wait. We started off with several appetizers including the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip, Fire-Roasted Artichoke, Thai Lettuce Wraps, and Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. The Fire-Roasted Artichoke put the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip to shame, but both were pleasant. I don't know why we ordered two sets of chips and dips.The Thai Lettuce wrap was too complex for a brute like me. I refuse to pay for a meal just to make it myself. The Spicy Ahi was winner of the appetizers though. I honestly didn't expect it to be that great, but it was and more. Flipping through the menu, I noticed ""We use premium Certified Angus Beef®or American Style Kobe for all of Our Burgers"". I asked the waiter is it REAL Kobe beef? He told me yes. For $13.95, I absolutely refused to believe it was. After going back and fourth and questioning my waiter's integrity and morals, I decided I had no grounds to judge whether it was real Kobe beef or not seeing how I've never tried it. So I ordered it! My KOBE burger came and the moment of truth was in my fingertips. It wasn't Kobe beef. But don't get me wrong, it was still a solid grade A burger with some of the best fries around. But at the end of the day, it was still just regular beef. We didn't order cheesecake because a total of 7 appetizers, multiple rounds of drinks, salad/soup, and an entree was more than enough to satisfy four people (gluttony will be the death of us). The bill came out to be around 140$ between four people ordering a feast fit for a king. Not bad. Overall a good choice for a meal if you have some time on your hands. Definitely on the Must Do List when going down town for the first time."
Esther J.,"San Francisco, United States",2,4,,4.0,27/6/2014,"I've eaten here a countless number of times.  Despite the wait being ridiculous (usually an hour during dinner rush, more or less) I honestly really like this particular Cheesecake Factory.  It's a busy place but the atmosphere isn't bad, service is decent, and the view is nice if you sit outside because it's right in the middle of downtown.  The long wait is mitigated by the fact that one floor down, it's the Macy's furniture floor, so go find a nice couch and take a break from all that walking around downtown you were probably doing.  This Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to go if you're not feeling too uppity but still want something better than Applebees.  Also the best part is the ginormous portions; I'm a girl, I eat a lot but these portions are definitely quite sharable.  And don't forget the free bread, everybody loves free bread. I'm just going to make a quick list of what I think are the best dishes to order here.   Entrees: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Cajun Jambalaya Pasta Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread Small Plates/Appetizers: Ahi Tartare Firecracker Salmon Nothing's mindblowing but the food is pretty darn good and the amount you get for the price is definitely worth it.  Eat here."
John W.,"Sacramento, United States",15,70,12,5.0,12/7/2012,"This location, as with most other Cheesecake Factory locations, is always crowded.  The food is usually very good, but the service is hit and miss.  Because of the large crowds, the waiters can sometimes be overwhelmed and not particularly friendly.  Some of the seating, particularly at the back of the restaurant (opposite side from the bar), is very close and it feels like you're sitting at your neighbor's table.  The floors are also always very slippery.  The outside view of Union Square, though, is always beautiful. On our most recent visit, our waiter (Andrew P.) was extremely nice.  In addition to excellent service, he offering us advice on where we could see the 4th of July fireworks.  We'll be sure to ask for a table in his section next time we visit this location. If you have time to wait for a table, this is a great restaurant with a huge selection of meals and enormous portions.  Bring your appetite!"
Marcos F.,"San Francisco, United States",5,21,,2.0,17/7/2014,"Seasonal cheesecakes are a terrible addition to the menu, especially the pumpkin cheesecake during Halloween. Someday CCF should notice that these cakes are not an upgrade to the menu but a downgrade."
Blacknight J.,"Berkeley, United States",0,13,,3.0,11/9/2014,Waited long to be seated. Got a table outside and enjoyed the moment with my girl friends..but wasn't impressed with food.
Rus M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,19,,1.0,30/9/2013,"I went there for the second and last time time. Waited for 30 minutes with the buzzer in my hand and they hadn't seated us even though the people who came in at the same time as us got seated. So when we inquired they said you are next.  Finally a waitress came to sit us down and they had got the wrong table (inside) even though we asked for outside. Typical they wrote down whichever comes first.  We finally get an outside table which wasn't wiped down. Get seated - I inspect the little dish on which they place the cutlery and it's filthy!! I had the exact same issue last time I came here, where I look down at the dish and it looks used or unwashed :-I forgave the last one but this is a repeat offender.  We get served some water and the glasses are dirty!!! There is scum from food still on the inside and outside of the glass.. yuk!   we order our food just two simple salads and 25 minutes later no food!  We get very irritated as it's been over an hour since we got there and we're still hungry, and so we walked out.  NOT coming back again. Crowded, touristy and not worth it. Save your money for a food court, cheaper and faster."
Amy F.,"San Francisco, United States",1,75,,1.0,25/2/2012,"I used to love The Cheesecake Factory in college but haven't been back in years. Decided to come after getting a gift card for my birthday.  The SF location is one of the busiest in the country and the wait is always really long. Slightly annoying but expected. The food, however, is way worse than I remember. Either the SF kitchen can't handle the number of customers or my taste buds have really changed. We ordered lots of small plates to share and they were all bland (some disgusting and inedible). I loved the cheesecake but could have easily gotten that to go and eaten it at home. Best thing about the experience was our waitress, who was adorable (and way friendlier than I would be if I had to deal with irritating tourists all day!). Come for the view (nice to overlook Union Square) but only stay long enough for them to box up your cheesecake."
Mariam B.,"Modesto, United States",193,24,2,4.0,17/11/2011,"I go to Cheesecake factory in every city that I go to. It has so much variety and everything that I have tasted has been GREAT!!!  Appetizers: I usually get their spinach & artichoke dip, buffalo blasts and their avocado rolls.  Entrees: If your in the mood for pasta, the Thai Chicken Pasta is to die for. If you want a salad, I would go for the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Sandwhich, Shimp & Bacon Club is awesome there. Their Pizza & Salad Lunch Combo is a great deal and really good too.  Dessert: I am not much of a tiramisu fan, but I must say that their Tiramisu Cheesecake is absolutely delicious!!! The whip cream is the best part!!!  Pretty much anything you get at Cheesecake will not disappoint.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that sometimes it has slow service."
Pauline L.,"Kirkland, United States",447,194,1831,4.0,23/5/2010,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory in SoCal before, and it's always pretty good. Your typical, hang-out-with-friends, big portions, lively restaurant. Good tasting each time This review is about two dishes at this SF location. ATMOSPHERE: same decor as every other, but it's always nice. Very decorated. Loud loud loud. Busy and you gotta wait usually for a table, but it wasn't too long a wait. Patio seating is pretty cool, overlooking SF fromt he 7th floor of Macys. SERVICE: typical of big chains. Nothing fancy. Older teenagers working as efficiently and quickly as they can. Quick, good American service. FOOD: I am in love with their brown bread. I still don't know if it's just whole wheat bread or something else (definitely not pumpernickel or rye), but it's just so delicious! Slight sweetness. We went on a Sunday, so they were still serving brunch at 1pm. *Monte Cristo: mannnn. Having a bite of my friend's Monte Cristo has made me crave these savory french toast sandwiches ALL THE TIME now. I want one right now, and tomorrow, and the day after. It was hug eand was served with potatoes. Thick bread that's duly soaked up the egg-milk sugar mixture before being fried with ham and cheese sandwiched between, then dusted on top with powdered sugar and served with jam. Sooo good and I wished I ordered one myself. But definitely enough for two meals, unless you want to eat your daily calories in one sitting. ( ) *Some Shrimp spaghetti special: This was one of their specials for April 2010. It was all right. Light sauce, battered shrimp, peas. Not something I'd get again, but not necessarily bad either.  ( ) Price is what it typically is: chain restaurant prices of $10-25 per person. Decent, but you can't beat the prices around Berkeley. (See my review on Pasta Bene)"
Shaughni N.,"San Francisco, United States",95,20,19,4.0,31/1/2014,"this place is good. I was seated right next to my coworker which is funny because there was a sea of people there when we arrived. The service was good for a busy mainstream restaurant. The server only visited us twice within the hour we were there which was okay, but it would have been nice to be around a little more to refill drinks, etc.."
Angelina T.,"Denver, United States",10,87,12,1.0,7/11/2011,"I expected so much more from you, Cheesecake Factory. I entered through the mall and the guys on the first floor convinced me to abandon my plan to take Frontera express to the park (downstairs) for the balcony of the Cheesecake Factory that overlooks the park. After that, it was all over. When I reached reception upstairs, they practically ignored me before taking my name. About 5 minutes later, I was seated outside. I was attended by a server and a trainee server. I ordered pasta and salmon. I was waiting quite a while (enough so they came out to apologize). The pasta was obviously ready long before the salmon because when I received the pasta, it looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for about 15 minutes... the pasta was hard. The server didn't notice or chose to ignore it when she brought it out, so I had to send it back. They didn't cook a new batch, because when I received it the second time, there were some overcooked pasta tips hiding in the middle of the dish. Another disappointing aspect was the music on the balcony. There was a live band playing in the park, but CF still chose to play cheesy pop music out on the deck. Overall, a terrible experience not worthy of the CF name. Needless to say, I won't be back to this location."
Charles Y.,"Berkeley, United States",142,277,6,3.0,18/6/2015,not bad but I came here after I got a cavity filled so it was sensitive to sweet and I got the cheesecake with Reeses and snickers and butterfinger and stuff and it hurt my tooth a lot and it hurt for hours so they shoulda taken that into account smh
Jenny T.,"San Francisco, United States",59,128,101,3.0,8/9/2012,"The portions are huge! I came here around 1pm on a weekday for lunch and the wait for a table was only 15 minutes. Our waiter was excellent and friendly. The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice. There are tables available outdoors, but I only recommend choosing that if there is nice SF weather. If you want room for cheesecake at the end, I recommend sharing an entree with someone. My recommendations: - Renee's Special: I chose Chicken Almond Salad Sandwich and the sandwich was so delicious! This special is so huge because it comes with a big bowl of soup with a large portion of green salad. Besides the Chicken Salad Sandwich, you have the option of choosing Fresh Turkey Sandwich instead. - Chicken Bellagio: This dish was very good. I loved the taste of the basil pasta. The two pieces of crispy chicken was yummy. I can't wait until my next visit so I can try their cheesecake."
Suzannae L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,3/9/2015,"I love cheesecake, but I think it's a better idea to order to go rather than dine here eating cheesecake. The Cheesecake, especially the Godiva cheesecake is very sweet, and it's hard to finish it all in one sitting. Other than that, all the staff are very friendly and welcoming."
NC B.,"San Francisco, United States",581,120,36,4.0,5/11/2011,"The service and menu is EXCEPTIONAL! Ive been in this location at least 100 times. seriously, The view from the top of Maceys is amazing, The menu has EVERYTHING from mexican, italian, to chinese and burgers. Best dishes: Avocado eggrolls, spaghetti Carbonara, Chicken Madeira. ONLY CONS: waitime to get a table is OBSCENE!!! 2 hours in a tuesday night for a party of 2??? really!!! They should take reservations or do something about it.  Also there is literally no seating in the waiting area."
Dominic T.,"San Francisco, United States",499,344,375,5.0,12/1/2010,"I ate here countless times over the winter break and even before then. The wait is disgusting but you just have to go at the right time and also find things to do within that wait time. That shouldn't be a problem though, considering Macy*s is right below you and there is a Starbucks a few floors down.  I've had a number of birthday gatherings here too. If you go for lunch, have everyone arrive promptly and plan ahead. No reservations, so don't try calling ahead. They'll just tell you to come down and pick up a pager like everyone else and wait your turn. Foodwise, the portions are gargantuan! When ordering, please save room for cheesecake, if that is your intention for coming to the establishment. Lunch portions are also above average. A wide range of appetizers are available and seasonal lunch specials (more like snacks) are also on a separate insert or sometimes on the table. If you hate waiting for food, have no fear. The bread is to die for! For most people I know, they love the ""brown bread""/whole wheat bread. It's delicious and has a touch of sweetness that hits the right notes in your mouth. The sourdough is also noteworthy but a bit on the rigid side, typical though.  I used to always get the farfalle with chicken pasta but I got tired of it. I still stick with the pastas though since I can't go wrong with them. When in doubt, order a salad or pasta.  Burgers are more than a handful and mouthful! I remember the day I got my braces, I came straight to The Cheesecake Factory to eat with my grandma. Just biting down on the bun hurt like a mother!  My favorite cheesecake is Stephanie's ultimate red velvet. It's extremely high in calories, sugars, and oils but if that doesn't matter to you, try it! I've also had the key lime cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake (delicious!), and others.  There are occasional promotions throughout the year and I've took advantage of several of them. Most recently was the ""every $30 spent = 1 slice of free cheesecake"". Another was national cheesecake day. And plenty others. I'm glad that those happen because it's not a cheap place to dine. Just the frozen iced mango I get every time amounts to $5 or so and it's the same volume as a Power size at Jamba Juice. I don't think reviews can do the place justice. Everyone has his/her own experience at the Factory."
Bonnie Z.,"San Francisco, United States",336,459,632,3.0,5/5/2010,"The full three stars are for the yummy cheesecake, despite being $7 a slice. But the tiramisu was delicious, rich, and pleasing.  Downgrade 2 stars for the ridiculously long wait and poor service regarding our tables. Came in with a party of 11 and we got split into two booth tables, so our whole party couldn't even converse with each other. Half of our party even came into the city an hour earlier to snag a table, but the total wait was still around 2 hrs. I guess that was still better than waiting 3 hours for a big table.  Food: I want to say that it's on par with Chili's and other chain restaurants. I got the Smokehouse BBQ burger (medium-rare). It came with onion rings and fries. The fries were nice and crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. The onion rings were actually stacked within the burger, but I just pulled them aside to eat separately. And the burger was HUGE. I ate half of everything and saved the rest for lunch the next day.  Price: A bit on the expensive side, which is expected from eating out in SF. What was NOT expected was that they still charged us a  18% gratuity for our party even though we split the bills between our two tables.  Service: Our waiter seemed curt and too much in a rush. He also insisted my friend order a different dish, because my friend's original choice ""is not as good."" Who says that to patrons? But our replacement waiter (Stevie) was wonderful and always refilled our water and brought us lots of bread and butter.  I don't think I'll come here again with a big group of ppl. Or at least I will not come for a meal. The better plan would be to eat somewhere else, come to CCF for dessert (take-out at the counter), and eat it outside in Union Square."
Karen J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,104,42,4.0,10/6/2014,yummy food if you know what to order. nice staff mostly except for one lady I came across. Waiting time usually 40 mins or an hour
