Eric M.,"San Francisco, United States",118,38,,3.0,28/7/2015,"First off, I love the Cheesecake Factory! It has great food and, of course, amazing cheesecake. I can't help but always think about the Big Bang Theory when I go eat there. Also, for LOTR fans out there, the thin column looking pieces in between tables seem to resemble the tower of Sauron. All geekiness aside, let's get down to the reason why I only gave this place 3 stars when I said how much I love the food. One word: Tourists. Because this place happens to be smack dab in the middle of tourist central, the restaurant is constantly busy and extremely over packed by people. Do expect to wait 30 to an 1hr for a table. The restaurant is located at the top of Macy's, so if you do get a seat outside, you'll get a great view of Union Square. It's unfortunate that I have to get the place 3 stars, but I'm not a big fan of crowds and super long waits. Definitely go there and enjoy the food, though."
Nora S.,"San Francisco, United States",406,186,14,4.0,22/10/2011,"Things you might see at the Cheesecake Factory bar on a Tuesday night: European porn stars, tourists from New Zealand discussing the Rugby World Cup, an escort exchanging money with her pimp. In other words, prepare for a wild night!  The food is of a good enough quality and the service is EXCELLENT (what up, Mario!!!).  If you don't mind waiting for a table (it can be around half an hour), or feel comfortable hovering at bar tables where people look like they might be leaving, this is a fine place to come."
John D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,29,,1.0,30/8/2013,"We were told by the incredibly arrogant receptionist that we had to wait for 40 min. While waiting, we saw several empty and ready tables.  When we told that the receptionist (twice) she couldn't care less. We walked out and won't return. Arrogant receptionist = bad restaurant"
Lily Z.,"Alhambra, United States",16,138,5,2.0,6/7/2012,"On separate occasions I have ordered: jambalaya pasta, fish tacos, and a crispy chicken sandwich. Every one of them was at best, subpar. Add that to the long waits because tourists are told to go here.  I've only gone so many times because it was one of a few sit down, casual restaurants situated in the middle of the downtown area. If you do plan to go, try to get outside seating on a good day and just go for their desserts. I've only had their cheesecake once and it was pretty good. I've had some other dessert that was good too. After all, they are known for their cheesecake/desserts. It is a to-go place if you want something sweet."
Stephanie K.,"Oakley, United States",8,14,5,5.0,24/1/2010,"My husband took me here for lunch on my birthday. Surprisingly, I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before, even though I have lived in San Francisco all of my life. We went there right when it opened, at 11am, so we were seated right away. The hostess tried to seat us at a table, but I asked if we could sit at a booth so we could have a view, and she let us.  DRINKS: I got the strawberry lemonade and hubby got the raspberry lemonade. The strawberry was wonderful, but also VERY sweet, so you have to like that sort of the thing. The raspberry was less sweet, but in our opinion, not as good, so when we got refills, hubby changed his order for the strawberry. The glass also comes with a sugar rim. APPETIZER: We got the crabcakes. So yummy! It comes with 3 small sized crab cakes and it's served with a tartar sauce and a mustard dipping sauce, which were both tastey. You also get the complimentary bread at the table. I think it was brown bread and french bread, and it is served with room temperature butter. Both were good. ENTREES: Hubby got the filet mignon, which was a great portion, tender, very juicy, and had great flavor. The menu says it comes with french fries and onion rings, but it was mostly french fries and only two onion rings. The onion rings were okay, and the french fries were really good. I got the bistro pasta which was AWESOME! It is spaghetti pasta with crispy, battered shrimp, arugala, mushrooms, and tomatoes in a rich cream sauce. Then they top it off with freshly grated parmesan cheese to your liking. Ohhhh... my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I gave hubby some of my dish, and he said he was jealous and wished he ordered the same thing. We definately found a new favorite! DESSERT: We were picking up my birthday cake to have with a bunch of family later that evening. The 7 inch cheesecake wasn't going to be big enough for everyone we were having over, so we considered getting the 10 inch. When we dicovered that the price of the 10 inch was pretty much double the price of the 7 inch, for (HELLO!) only 3 extra inches, we opted to get two 7 inches instead. That way we could try two different kinds and get way more for the price. We got the Godiva chocolate and the Snickers cheesecakes. Both were delicious, but I am such a chocoholic, I thought the Godiva was just divine, and definately better! Our waiter was very nice too, and was very patient when hubby and I were taking forever to decide which cheesecakes we were getting. The only down side is that when we decided, he took forever to bring them out to us so we could go. It was worth it for the great experience we had!"
Denise C.,"Pacifica, United States",3,51,,4.0,30/8/2011,"Can you say CROWDED?. WE came here for my daughter's 21st birthday dinner. We waited 2.5 hrs. Please note that this place does not take reservations. Need I say more, HOWEVER, ths place is a great for big parties and great views. I have to say, it was worth it, The birthday girl had a  blast. CF is still ""cracking"" even though its been around for a long time.  The cheese cake to order? GODIVA WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE!!!  sooo worth the million calories, per bite.  I ordered the jambalaya. it was good. The lettuce wraps are awesome, I highly recomment this. It's also fun to build your own ""taco"" lettuce wrap. Yes!I would go again!!!! Denise"
Sanaya S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,7,5.0,20/7/2014,The staff there gets the five stars more than the cheesecake. Ofcourse the cheesecake is delightful but the staff has immense patience and it is a delight to be served by them. I had the red velvet cheesecake and it needs no explanation. It's amazing and moist and creamy!!!!!!
Katie M.,"San Francisco, United States",212,135,322,2.0,27/7/2011,"I was here a while back for my friend's birthday, and it was a really fun experience, mostly because we were a big group and we really enjoyed the breathtaking view of Union Square. Everyone ordered some sort of steak, and the portions were varied depending on the cut. I was really satisfied with my Grilled Rib-Eye Steak... but then again, I love steak. I'm an easy girl to please. I had the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake for dessert, which was all right.  The line is always really long, with a 30+ minute wait no matter the size of your party. You can opt to sit in the balcony dining area outside for a shorter wait, but c'mon, it's SF. It's usually freezing at night. At least there's a bar to pass some time at, but drinks are overpriced. I don't think I'd go back just because it wasn't worth the money. I think this place is way too overhyped, just because of the chain's reputation and its location. I've been to some really expensive but also really spectacular steak places that I'd definitely visit again - Cheesecake is not one of them."
Anthony N.,"San Francisco, United States",96,165,139,3.0,2/1/2012,"The only reason why I ate here was because my parents wanted to come. I would never come here myself because I think the wait is ridiculous and the food is not worth the wait. I went on a Thursday night and the wait time was 2 hours...  The food here is what is expected of a Cheesecake Factory. The basically serve everything you can think of and their ""special"" is about 2 pages long. Not a good place for those who are indecisive. The portion is extremely large and can get two average people. The food overall is good but not great and I do not think it is ever worth the wait."
Nadine M.,"Culver City, United States",64,89,15,4.0,3/4/2010,"not great service, but you CANNOT BEAT THE VIEW from the outside roof dining. We went for dessert only (we have cheesecake factory's where we're from and they do choose great locations -- the marina del rey and redondo beach ones come to mind -- and know the food is fine, if rich. We went on a cold nearly drizzly night during Spring Break and couldn't have been more thrilled to be there. Since we agreed to sit outside (they could use a few more heaters, btw) we got seated immediately and avoided the 1-hour plus wait.  With that view, how could you want to be anywhere else?  Terrific view, bring $$, a patient attitude for the sorta surly staff and consider the unbelievable white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake."
Savier M.,"Oakland, United States",82,141,34,5.0,29/6/2011,"How in the world do we allow for companies to serve us this trash. Our bodies are nature-made temples that deserve the best this world has to offer. Carcinogenic buffers are not a necessary component of good food. But DAMN are they good. I have fallen prey to the deep-fried macaroni and cheese balls many times but when I went to the San Francisco location, me and fam set it off right with the appetizer platter. Impending heart attacks were nigh because there was a enough salt to kill a baby. Next, I moved onwards to the Miso Salmon entree. Normally fish on top of rice or potatoes is a perfectly healthy dish but not tonight. My salmon was a greasy, wet mother****er with fake flavorings. I gulped this down quicker than a shot of Captain Morgan and I have no shame. Speaking of shame, did I mention the Tiramisu. It is a bonafide killer and you would do best to share this with a friend or two. I tried to eat it by myself and I am now writing this from Cheesecake Factory Heaven. I lied. I am alive and healthy but not due to this delicious place."
Perla L.,"Santa Cruz, United States",0,31,4,1.0,11/7/2015,"Food is tasty but service is bad!!! can't make a reservation on the phone so you have to be actually there before you can make a reservation. we have a reservation for 14 people(ages 12 and above), we were expecting that they will sit us in just one big / long table since we are 14 people, they sat us in 2 separate small table far from each other and we told them that since the table next to us will accommodate us that they should sit us there but the server said that it is reserved for small group,after 30 minutes they sat a group of 12 (adult ages 40 and above) people there. So 14 people is large group and that 12 people is small group???!!!!!"
Julia L.,"New York, United States",269,313,19,4.0,17/8/2011,"avocado egg rolls. A serious MUST. It's the best appetizer they have!!  Besides just the amazing appetizer though... The Cheesecake factory is really lovely. It's set way up on the top of the Macy's building overlooking Union Square which is soo much fun. I usually try to go here when I have family visiting or when I'm in for a nice night out because it's such a spectacular place. Although I DO have some suggestions.  Do NOT come hungry if it is the weekend due to the fact that they are always packed on the weekends if you come hungry you will be even MORE hungry and grumpy by the time you sit down. It's usually about an hour or so wait so be patient While waiting, I suggest that you go down to the furniture section... they say that the pager doesn't work there... but every time I have sat down there it totally does, I think that the Macy employees just get annoyed so they say that just to bug ya. but DO NOT quote me on this because for all i know that may have changed.  TRY the Steak... medium rare will melt in your mouth... seriously some of the best steak I have had and if you're more of a fish person... get the Salmon with asparagus and potatoes... you will not regret it. Both entrees will leave you so satisfied and wanting more annd OF COURSE the Cheesecake.  Get any kind of flavor that looks delicious... it's all good as it should be since it is the title of the restaurant. ENJOY! :]"
Laurens D.,"Walnut Creek, United States",160,89,7,4.0,16/7/2012,"Like any other restaurant, this place has gotten so much hype, but doesn't always deliver. Yes it is a nice restaurant, plenty to choose from on the menu, but the service can be hit and miss, depending on the location. If you've ever been to The Cheesecake Factory, you know it's never empty. The San Francisco location is my favourite, especially the outside patio that over looks Union Square, which on a nice summer afternoon/evening, can be a very pleasant eating experience.... sometimes if you are lucky enough, you have the pleasure of eating with San Francisco's finest... the seagulls. Despite their being two Cheesecake Factories with in 25 minutes of me, I still choose to go to the San Francisco one. I love a busy restaurant, as long as the location and ambience is nice. I always go for the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta, but from word of mouth, I've heard that almost anything is good. Their portions are big, sometimes a little too big, and their cheescakes are divine, I have just about tasted every one of them, and they have yet to disappointment in terms of taste, presentation and overall satisfaction."
Mitchell M.,"Concord, United States",0,21,4,1.0,26/4/2016,"Once again a horrible experience at the Cheesecake Factory. Terrible service. We were first brought waters and then the waiter didn't return until it was time to order the entree. He was quite scarce throughout our meal. Cleanliness was terrible. The table was sticky and when I opened my menu, it was coated in a film of old food and spilled drinks. My menu actually stank so bad that I washed my hands after handling it. The food was ok tasting. I ordered the baja chicken tacos. They tasted the way I expected them too. I did get a stomach ache 4 hours after I ate. I felt the same way after the last two times I ate at the cheesecake factory.  I really don't understand why everyone wants to eat here. It's crazy busy, the food isn't anything special, the service is terrible, the cleanliness is LACKING, and I always get a stomach ache. In all, this place really sucks. If you are visiting SF, there are a ton of very original places to go that beat this place by far."
Diana C.,"San Francisco, United States",7,32,,4.0,25/9/2011,"Great place for tourists....And locals who want to be reminded what an amazing city San Francisco is. The outdoor seating is on the top floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square. It is a perfect view. The food is very good for a chain. I love their flatbreads, their fried avocado rolls and their pastas. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. The cheesecake is great, but given their portion sizes, I rarely make it to dessert.  Mainly, this place is worth it for the amazing view. The wait is usually at least half hour to an hour but considering that it is inside Macy's it's no big deal to shop a bit in the meantime. The service is hit or miss depending on the waiter. There are so many staff members that you can get lucky with a really nice waiter or not so lucky. Definitely recommend this place!"
Mel G.,"Tucson, United States",131,1891,,4.0,13/11/2011,"The main reason I'm giving this location 4 stars is because of the spectacular view you can get overlooking Union Square downtown.  My boyfriend and I grabbed some drinks here earlier tonight, and went outside to enjoy the view.  Yes, the wait is really long, but my recommendation is to go there for some drinks, where you don't have to put up with the wait.  So great."
Mel T.,"San Francisco, United States",180,310,818,5.0,11/10/2009,"Ok, really, this review is biased because now when I think of Cheesecake Factory, all I can think of is the new addition to its cheesecake menu - Red Velvet Cheesecake.  I wonder if that thing is baked with crack because seriously, that cheesecake is DELICIOUS.  Not too cheesey, not too heavy, and not too sweet, it really is THE best cheesecake I've tasted..in my life...ever.  I know I have a problem - I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that today was my THIRD DAY IN A ROW of heading downtown just to order that slice of heaven (was talking to the counter guy yesterday, who said they're under contract to offer the Red Velvet Cheesecake for at least a year), but it is so worth it (I feel like Rachel and Chandler on Friends.  Anyone else catch that episode?). If I had to rate Cheesecake Factory itself (you know, minus the miraculous Red Velvet Cheesecake), I'd give it...a 3.5.  The wait, particularly at this location, is always outrageous, the food is so-so, and the service is hit or miss (on this past Thursday's visit, Danae was awesome - ask for her!!).  Apparently consistency is not key at this place.  To save yourself from all this, just order the Red Velvet Cheesecake to go.  You won't be disappointed!! P.S.  Twenty-five cents from each slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake sold is donated to Feeding America. P.P.S.  A serving size of Red Velvet Cheesecake is, um, 1500 calories (holy hell).  Deathly, albeit still worth every bite.  *sigh*  Guess who'll be hitting up the gym come Monday?"
Michael T.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",56,97,,4.0,12/8/2012,"CHEESECAKE. I would totally order it if I didn't get full off of the food I ordered for the main course! Every time I do order cheesecake though, it just has to be the Strawberry. The Cheesecake is never heavy, but it's almost always...heaven. I ordered a smaller appetizer since I wasn't that hungry - the Avocado Egg Rolls. These were surprisingly healthy (ignore the fact they're deep fried), and the mix of avocado/tomato/onions (more like very chunky guacamole) was incredible. Even though there was no meat, these egg rolls were very filling. The Egg Rolls also come with a tamarind peanut dipping sauce - a must try with the egg rolls! Even though the wait can be long for seating (at one point people were waiting for indoor tables for 2 hours, but we chose outdoor seating where the wait time was 30 minutes), the cheesecake is definitely worth the wait. The only thing I didn't like was that the restaurant was extremely crowded and very loud, but...CHEESECAKE. It's worth it."
Blck R.,"Fremont, United States",13,124,363,5.0,8/9/2011,"Never mind what I had to eat. The service (my waiter) was the best that I had in months. Andrew was more than professional and more than courteous. Guys like this can make someones day; a good day.  Thanks Andrew, you rock! Five Trans-fats out of Five..."
