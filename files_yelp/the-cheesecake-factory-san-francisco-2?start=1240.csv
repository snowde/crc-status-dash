Joye C.,"San Francisco, United States",3,10,,4.0,22/10/2011,"No matter which day or time of the day you step into The Cheesecake Factory, you will have to wait. I have been here on many different occasions and all of my wait times have been more than an hour. It's worth the wait though! The most recent visit I've had was on a Saturday night. It was an hour and 45 mins of wait for a table of two indoors, but an hour and 15 mins for outdoors. Since we had plans with other friends later in the night, we chose to sit outside. Thank goodness it wasn't freezing that night! The view was beautiful at night, overlooking Union Square, and the vibe was just perfect. We tried the fish tacos, which was just ok; I couldn't taste the fish at all because everything else was more flavorful. We also tried the onion rings, chicken croquettes, and fresh strawberry cheesecake. SUPER DELICIOUS! We had to force ourselves to finish everything and by the end of the night, we left happily satisfied :)"
R K.,"Fremont, United States",0,14,,1.0,30/6/2015,"Manager Joe was completely rude and money chasing person. Can't believe cheese cake factory would even hire someone so rude and someone so pathetic in service. Not only was he rude but refused to seat us and started arguing about what foods we ordered at the bat and whether we had already paid for it and thus would not seat us despite our turn coming after 30min wait. Shame to see such horrible hospitality in San Francisco and in Cheesecake Factory. Owner of CCF please take note and decide whether or not you should hire (or fire) such employees or what service you want to have. You jus got six customers who won't be returning anytime soon - thanks to your rude and pathetic money chasing ""manager"" joe."
Vincent C.,"Imperial Beach, United States",19,60,4,4.0,3/8/2012,"I love cheesecakes... especially when they're half off! Okay, maybe that was irrelevant, but they're half off during ""National Cheesecake Day"" -- dine in only and limit of one! Anyway, I really dislike big restaurant chains... but who can resist Cheesecake Factory?! I've been to a lot of locations and this one is probably THE best location. I mean, c'mon, rooftop location, seeing the skyscrapers, chill weather, sun's out? Yes, it's awesome. So make sure you pick balcony/outdoor seating. Makes everything better. In addition to the location, their servers were great here. I love GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE as always :) We had two different wait staff because one had to go on a break, but they were both great. Checked up on us frequently, refilled our waters, asked if we needed anything else. Great! The wait can be long sometimes here, but this location is huge and it can accommodate a lot. The waiting area might be cramped sometimes, but be patient! Food is a little expensive here, but it is well worth it. Main dishes like pastas are usually good for two (or 1.5)... just eat their bread (which is complimentary and good with black vinegar + olive oil too!). For my main dish, I got pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes... soooo good (even after taking home and reheating it!). For cheesecake, I got the new OREO DREAMblahblah CHEESECAKE! Thick and creamy. Yum. Would go back, especially if there's a special occasion. Visit this place when you're in SF and hungry! :) No reservations... unless you have a big group, they might let you make a reservation."
Cands W.,"San Jose, United States",269,25,2,4.0,27/12/2014,"I think a lot of people give low ratings to the Cheesecake Factory because of the wait time. We ate there the day after Christmas so it was extremely busy. Our wait time was 1.5 to 2 hours for a table of 4 so if you plan on eating there, reserve ahead of time! (Just a heads up: they do not accept reservations over the phone. You have to reserve your table in person.) It wasn't a big deal to me because the restaurant is located basically in Macy's so we spent our wait time shopping!  Customer service is really good and the food was really good too! All the portions are huge though so if you don't like to eat too much, I would recommend sharing your meal with someone. All the dishes are pretty expensive but I believe it was worth it! :D If you go in the winter time, I suggest that you try outdoor seating. We opted out of it because we thought it was going to be too cold. However, they have heat lamps outside and it was not even one bit cold! If you reserve for outdoor seating, your wait time might be shorter too. The view is AMAZING as well; you get to see the entire Union Square. During the winter time, it is beautiful with all the lights! Even if you eat indoors, after your meal you should go outside to look at the view. Overall, great service and great food, just a little pricey and long wait times."
Alina R.,"San Francisco, United States",89,31,1,5.0,17/9/2011,"I went here for my birthday (today) with a few of my friends. It took 30min for us to be seated, and the place was pretty packed. I don't know how it's on other days, but it seems that Friday is quite a popular day for everyone to go places, especially here. So anyways, after we were seated at the patio (which is a really nice view), we ordered our drinks, and then we ordered the food. I tried the Factory Burger, which was pretty good, and my friends ordered the Mac and Cheese one. Since one of my friends mentioned to the waiter that it's my birthday, a few waiters came with a cheescake that said happy birthday. and it looked sooooooo pretty! They even sang happy birthday to me which was cool, but it felt awkward getting everyone else's attention. lol. But yea, the food is good, but it's a bit pricey. Even if it's pricey, it's still a must go place in the city!"
Joanna S.,"San Francisco, United States",2,17,,4.0,23/10/2012,"I love eating here. The staff is very nice and accommodating (  for my friend's 23rd birthday dinner, I asked them to secretly decorate a cheesecake for her and it was a success! )   I love the food here! I definitely recommend the Jambalaya pasta, miso salmon, and the pasta da vinci. The portions here are huge! I am always stuffed and I never finish my entree. I always order the cheesecake to go though! it's delish nomnomnom~"
Julian R.,"Pullman, United States",0,3,,2.0,15/12/2013,"I'll start off with the positives.  The view from the top floor of Macy's was awesome.  The variety in the large menu is excellent. Also the portion sizes are great since I eat a lot. The cheesecake is also good if you have room after dinner  Negatives: The wait was 1.5 to 2 hours. Obviously I thought the food was good enough to warrant this long wait.  Our waiter was pretty much non-existent.  I think there was a span of at least an hour before he came by after getting our food only after I stared him down to mention the next issue. I had the Carlton salad. It tasted great. But finding part of an avocado peel WITH THE STICKER that has the barcode for scanning was a little weird and worrisome. For some people finding this would be a deal breaker but I'm not eating the peel. But it makes me wonder how the quality control is in the kitchen. Our waiter gave as a free cheesecake because of this. I actually didn't cause too much of a fuss. I actually would have preferred getting a discount but whatever.  I give two stars because the food is tasty, but the service was mediocre. Never was asked how our food was and we couldn't get refills on our water. Avocado peel with the sticker was also a deal breaker."
Sujin H.,"Burbank, United States",184,58,4,5.0,24/7/2010,"Mmmmm, no matter where I am, LA or SF, Cheesecake Factory never fails me.  I went for my friend's birthday (party of 8) and although we had to wait for a long time (was expected) we got seated by a nice waiter. Some portions were family-style whereas others were not, but we shared everything nonetheless.  Ughh, simply amazingg. We ordered so many dishes (sorry, forgot which ones) and had 4 slices of cheesecake for dessert, 2 ppl sharing 1 slice. I don't think anyone finished their slice (they're pretty big) not because it was gross, but because we were full from our meal. What can I say? Their cheesecakes are hands down the best. Next time, I think I'm going to order the cheesecake first so I can finish it! This place is great for anything- dating, catching up, casual dinner, birthdays, etc. Love Cheesecake Factory!"
Lianne D.,"San Francisco, United States",437,169,122,3.0,18/8/2011,"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon. Not too crowded, I was able to get a table for 3 within ten minute. Luckily it was beautiful in Downtown because I would of been upset for getting seated by the door. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. It was delicious! Very saucy which I love and the flavor was just right! Not too spicy and you can definitely taste the honey. We also ordered a White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. I swear they give you more whip cream then cheesecake! Overall, it was good! A little too sweet but, thank goodness I was sharing!  Service was alright. I feel like for a place that looks like elegant should not be giving a service like Mel's Drive Inn (no offense)"
Vikki K.,"San Francisco, United States",115,201,84,4.0,15/8/2011,"I came here the other night with family. It was my first time eating a meal here in a while because my friends and I usually swing by around midnight (when they close at 12:30 hehe!) for dessert. I swear they hate us. My dad waited for a table around 6:15 and they had one at 7 (so a 45 minute wait) but we couldn't get there until 8:45 and they were able to push our reservations back. The pager is supposed to work in the Macy's building but for some reason, ours did not. We got seated around 9 pm and the hostess led us to our seats. It was a clear night in San Francisco so the view was gorgeous and made for many picture opportunities.  Our server was very sweet and came out with the breads (the white and brown chocolate tasting one) and our waters. We started off with the avocado eggrolls and calamari. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder and the fry station was backed up so our waiter gave us another bowl of clam chowder on the house. The clam chowder tasted so fresh and had tons of pieces of clams in there. I must have had a piece of a clam or two in each bite! My family ordered the chicken alfredo, chicken madera, petite filet mignon, skinny turkey burger and salad and chicken bellagio.  I personally had the Chicken Madera with chicken, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken was covered with a delicious cheese that melted the chicken, sauce and mushrooms together. It was very very delicious! Might I add that the portions are SUPER LARGE so you will always have to doggie bag. We ended the meal with a white chocolate macadamia cheesecake which was as fluffy and sweet as I last remembered it to be. Definitely a great place to take out of towners and tourists! :0"
S L.,"San Francisco, United States",119,163,,4.0,6/3/2014,We came here around 8-9pm on a weekday. It was pretty full; we had to wait around 20 minutes to be seated. My review is only for their cheese cake. I tried their fresh banana cream cheesecake and thought it was glorious. Very very good.
Lauren P.,"San Francisco, United States",84,160,12,3.0,26/10/2013,"you know what you're going to get when you step foot into a cheesecake factory.  it's a chain restaurant and it feels like a chain restaurant.  but the food is decent and because it's a chain restaurant, you know what you're going to get -- yay for being predictable! this particular location is smack dab in the middle of union square which is tourist central.  and, no matter what time of day it is, this place is packed.  i mean, you-need-to-wait-45-minutes-for-a-table kind of packed. come patient.  come hungry."
Pia V.,"New York, United States",1795,884,1359,4.0,21/7/2009,"I used to come to this location a lot, and it is always quite busy.  The view from the patio is quite beautiful and worth the wait on a warm afternoon/evening. There is always a wait, so I suggest to call ahead for a reservation or be prepared for a 30+ minute wait.   I recommend the Jambalaya with pasta and the fresh strawberry cheesecake.  Their appetizers are really good too, I've never gone wrong with any of them yet.  Also, their salad portions are HUGE.  So if you order one side salad ... be prepared to share."
Robin Z.,"Berkeley, United States",15,21,,4.0,10/11/2013,I love this place so much. The warm bread served before the meal is so good and therefore worths the long waiting time at meal times. I strongly recommend to try the Fresh Grilled Salmon.
Aislinn E.,"Oakland, United States",179,11,,4.0,2/11/2013,"Not a fan of chain like restaurants like this, due to the fact I live in the bay area. However, this was not even bad food wise, still able to stay healthy with my habits and drinks weren't as bad either"
Chelsea W.,"Cloverdale, United States",6,28,10,2.0,18/5/2015,"If it werent for the quick service , view and having my favorite beer I would be rating this a single star. Ive eaten at the cheesecake factory before, but never this one. My boy friend reccomend it, he has eaten here before and said he did not recall his dinner being this disappointing before. I oredered an IPA (my usual), stuffed mushrooms, pork potstickers and the pasta Da Vinci. I do have to say everything was at a good temperature when served and our server was delightful. We also were seated very promptly. This was surprising considering how busy it usually is. I still feel the bread sticks would of been a better meal then the three course I ordered. the mushrooms were lacking something , but it wasnt the sauce they were in(sauce was BOMB). pot stickers were way to salty to eat more then one and what should of been the best part was far from it. the load of  noodles were very chewy and the sauce was bland. with the amount of noodles in my dish it was like a treasure hunt to find any mushrooms or chicken . i did not get a to go box"
Michelle W.,"Daly City, United States",225,280,4,2.0,4/10/2011,"I used to love coming here years ago... huge portions, decent prices, good food. It seems as though the portions have shrunk, prices are still the same, food isn't as fantastic as I remembered.  The dishes I did enjoy were the sweet corn tamales, fried calamari, and chicken tenders.  Not to mention, this particular one is always crowded due to its prime location.  The wait is much shorter, say compared to the Cheesecake Factory in Sac. The factor that brings it down the most are the watered down alcoholic beverages.  Several times I've ordered the peach bellini, which barely had any alcohol content.  I've ordered other drinks, which were stronger, but the price is quite absurd for a sugary mixed drink. If I go back, I'll have to take a straight up shot."
Analleli G.,"San Francisco, United States",9,31,,4.0,17/10/2011,- At the top floor of a mall? I believe. - Obviously great food...it's Cheesecake. Don't buy something just because it's expensive and you expect for it to be amazing though. Food will be good. - Clam chowder is the BEST!!! - Wait for me on a Friday night was 1 hour and 15 minutes ish.
Ringo M.,"San Francisco, United States",556,309,918,5.0,6/3/2011,"Nothing beats the cheesecake factory. For me growing up, cheesecake factory was the restaurant you only go to if there is a special occasion. I would always look forward to the free bread, the fruit smoothie, and some delicious fried stuff. Even after being to many more 'creative' and 'fancier' restaurants now in my old age, none of them would ever bring me that pure joy feeling that I get when i arrive at 8th floor macy's andseeing the huge 'The Cheesecake Factory' block letters by the busy reception desk. We chose to eat outside on a cold day, and while the view was cool, it also makes your food cold 10 times faster, so don't eat outside if you're a slow eater. We decided to go with 4 appetizers and share 1 entree so we'll have enough room for the cheesecake. And even though we told ourselves we won't eat the bread this time so we can finish our food, we ended up eating the bread anyways : ) BUENO! Fried Artichoke Hearts I don't even know how the artichoke tastes like honesty, but its fried really well, and it comes with a garlic-ish dipping sauce. automatic plus in my book. Spicy Chipotle Pasta We subbed the Angel Hair in for the Penne because I like to slurp my food haha. I didn't eat much of it, but it was good. It was not too spicy, but spicy enough and the thing that put it over the top was that it had this crunchy thing on top that gave the whole dish a nice crunch! Avocado Eggrolls This is our favorite. I think just having this dish on our table brings back happy times. Basically, its just fried eggroll with avocado and guacamole stuffed inside. You put some delicious green sauce on it and add some of that white crunchy thing, and then it just brings a smile on your face. No Bueno Peach Smoothie I didn't know smoothie does this, but after a while, it kinda tasted watered-down or diluted or whatever. AND it wasn't hella good to begin with either Chicken Samosa It was just another fried thing but with curry stuff stuffed inside. Meh, Fried Calamari I think the calamari didn't give enough of a texture substance. It just tasted like fried stuff with cocktail sauce, which is actually pretty good, but i would rather have my calamari more chewy. I know this generous 5 star rating is more a personal sentiment rating than an actual rating, but i really like the cheesecake factory. I have a good time everytime i come here and that's what its all about right? Sure, the service isn't always there, the wait is crazy, the food aren't mind-blowing and the cheesecake probably isn't worth 8 bucks either, but the cheesecake factory will always have a special place in my heart. and in my tummy too : )"
Jean L.,"Burbank, United States",424,331,141,2.0,20/2/2011,"Your standard Cheesecake Factory, with about 1-1.5 hour long waits if you come in the middle of the lunch or dinner rush. The view is nice enough, but a lot of other restaurants are more romantic with less commercial fluff n' stuff (e.g. the Grandviews at the Hyatt, Top of The Mark at the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins) that promise a great view. Plus, you won't have to freeze and enjoy the view (sitting on the patio can be blisteringly cold at times). All the aforementioned places have floor-to-ceiling windows.  I would come here if I just wanted something safe + cheesecake and didn't care about waiting in a crowded place for it. I would go somewhere else if I wanted to try unique foods in a wonderful, relaxed atmosphere."
