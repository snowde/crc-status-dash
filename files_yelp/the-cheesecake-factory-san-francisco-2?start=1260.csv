Black K.,"Oakland, United States",9,205,161,3.0,2/4/2010,"Cheesecake Factory SF is good for only one thing, and one thing only... THE DESSERTS! Don't brother trying to eat there unless your comfortable with a 60-90 minute wait. And that's on a good day!  Unfortunately, being located on top of the Union Square Macy's makes this particular location a haven for tourists...and that really sucks.  The only good news about the intergalactic wait time is that you can take the escalators down one level an browse thru the Macy's home section while you pray that your ""personal Cheesecake Factory pager"" buzzes you up a table. lol So... If you like extremely crowded, loud, restaurants packed floor to floor with either tourists or teenagers on their way to the prom, located about 12 stories above the street with only two elevators and a escalator to get out... then you will LOVE this particular Cheesecake Factory... Did I mention the desserts rock! Better yet, just order your dessert to go and save yourself from the 90 min wait time... lol"
Tamisha L.,"Richmond, United States",5,6,7,4.0,19/4/2014,Had brunch here. The wait was 45mins which made my date impatient but did window shopping at Macy's while we waited. Had calamari and peanut sauce appetizer which was delicious. The tomato basil pasta was horrible but I left with the most unhealthy portion of red velvet cheesecake that was to die for. Had the nicest and most patient waiter and overall enjoyable time.
Grace L.,"San Diego, United States",1143,621,560,3.0,20/2/2011,"It's really hard not to like this location. Some people would throw it out the door just for the crazy long wait alone, but there's so much more. Have you ever sat outside on the patio on a nice sunny day with the view of the hustle and bustle below? I have. It was splendid. This time, we were here to celebrate one of my bestie's birthdays. For a Saturday night, the wait was atrocious - a whopping hour and a half for a party of 3. But we put our names down and ventured off the 8 story Macys. And yes, that's one of the coolest things about this location is that your pager works throughout the entire store. We got back with half an hour left, and I ordered a Pyramid Haywire Heff from the bar. I think Lovie's drinking preferences are growing on me. We finally sat down. We ordered the avocado eggs rolls, tempura shrimp, and mini corn dogs. All of which were delish. We went in with our main dishes with an eagerness that has been building up throughout the entire day. Lisa had a monstrous heaping of pulled pork sandwich goodness. Jaclyn had a beautiful spread of steak and shrimp with garlic herb mashed potatoes. I had a perfectly bleeding medium rare Monterey burger with avocado. I've been on a real avocado kick lately, can you tell?!?  Last but not least were the cheesecake. We were so stuffed, we took our cheesecakes to go. I enjoyed my luscious red velvet cheesecake for breakfast the next day. Nothing like a sugar rush to get your day going. The reason for the 3 stars is the service. Though our waitress was on par for most of the night, she forgot to sing happy birthday to my friend! And it took this super kind lady from New Zealand who was sitting next to us to say to our waitress that she forgot about the birthday. Vicky from New Zealand was super nice...she look pictures of all three of us. I wish I had taken a picture with her too. Anyways, we'll be back here again eventually. I gave bestie a gift card to Cheesecake, so we're guaranteed to be back sometime."
Virgo M.,"Bay Area, United States",221,767,81,3.0,2/7/2011,"Really, I have never written a review here? Maybe cuz it's just OKAY.  All three stars are for the cheesecake....everytime and any flavor. I haven't yet sunk my teeth into today's choice--Pina Colada. However, I'm hopeful it's gonna be totally delish. (edit: it was) The food here and at every other CF I've been to is just OK. I actually prefer the CF spinoff restaurant ""Grand Lux"" in Vegas for food selections. Today, I had ahi sushi rolls (yuck), a small arugula salad (plain) and a peach smoothie (decent.)  The location atop Macys overlooking Union Square is of course--devine.  I'll be back....it's the CF after all."
Katie A.,"Addison, United States",17,72,10,4.0,22/2/2012,"You can always find something to eat on the expansive menu. The kitchen does a great job of handling the multitude of selections. A Vegan guest at our table was thrilled with the options. The view from the top floor is beautiful - even if you sit right inside the windows. Lunch portions are still large and shareable. The passion fruit iced tea is not heavily flavored, but is very refreshing. We always enjoy a visit to this location."
Harold W.,"Manhattan, United States",49,122,55,1.0,15/8/2013,Original server was very nice and courteous  then came the shift change. After waiting for over a hour for a table the new server decided to not come over our side of the room and never even came by to check on us after the hand off. After waiting  a while for no service I went to the front and ordered cheesecake for my table while we wait. It wasn't until we were all done and waiting for her that she came over and saw empty cheesecake plates then went to another server to complain out loud. The new server became our waiter and instead of apologizing for a long wait and no service    He decided to threaten us by saying he will kick us out if we order at the front again. Horrible customer service this time and I go there twice a month for 8 months now and never had such this kind of rudeness.
Derek F.,"San Ramon, United States",85,85,46,4.0,1/5/2012,"I am going to simplify this for you because if you have eaten at 1 cheesecake factory, you have eaten at them all. -Long wait times -Embarrassing cocktails -Skimpy appetizers +Lunch/Dinner portions +VIEW VIEW VIEW This location is all about the view. Don't expect anything different from this place other than the view of Union Square. Cheesecake Factory in general gets a 3 from me. but the view from this place warrants a 4."
Lea T.,"San Francisco, United States",24,214,24,5.0,29/1/2014,I love this place!  I like to shop alone when I have some serious purchasing to do and this is the perfect place to take a break and have lunch.  You can sit at the bar without getting bored because you can chat with your neighbor or the friendly bartenders.  There is usually no wait because most people eventually end up at a table.  I also love there drinks - there's nothing bad on the menu.  Mmmmm.
Robie C.,"Stockton, United States",0,5,,3.0,2/7/2014,This is a really good place I recommend it to anyone. Service is wonderful the food is great and everyone is nice.
Oleg H.,"San Francisco, United States",208,561,28,3.0,2/1/2010,"""Really? Cheescake? OK - they have an awesome roof deck, but get ready to wait"" I heart CF on top of macys - but its almost never an awesome experience. Most of the time there's a wait, and last 3-4 times ive gone here there was a confusion with seats and food (specifically which table ordered what), having said that its probably expected considering the location combined with brand recognition leading to a highly crowded chaotic restaurant."
Amiee H.,"Beaverton, United States",423,880,179,3.0,31/12/2009,"Perched on the top of the gi-normous Macy's right in the heart of Union Square, this particular branch of The Cheesecake Factory franchise is more hype than actual good food. The fact that it takes around 2 hours to get a table, really kills your mood by the time you actually get seated. This dining experience is at most worth a one time deal.  Food: Ordered some pasta dish, doesn't matter what it is, because it was so mediocre. My friend got some fried chicken with mashed potatoes, also sub par. And of course, for dessert, how could you dine at The Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake right? So we got the limited holiday Pumpkin Cheesecake and that tasted pretty good.  Ambiance: WAY TOO FREAKEN CROWDED. Everyone that worked there is way too busy to care about you. I completely understand that being so completely swamped has it's limitations, but don't you think a chain this big can afford to hire more people to offer better service to everyone instead of spreading all their workers super thin? The best seats are the ones on the balcony where you get to overlook union square. It really is a nice relaxing view after a long day of hustling and bustling around the city.  Price: SUPER SUPER expensive for NOT that great of food! That's all I've got to say.  Service: Decent for how busy they were.  Overall: There's so much hype for this place, that I'm sure everyone would go try this place just for the heck of it. But after one dining experience here, I'm sure you'd all agree that the food, the service, the ambiance and the price is NOT going to draw you back!"
Monalisa M.,"Miami, United States",212,334,95,5.0,10/9/2011,Drink: Pina Colada Appie: Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Entree: Crispy Spicy Beef Dessert: Pumpkin Pumpkin Cheesecake You'll thank me later.
Erica L.,"San Carlos, United States",158,428,90,2.0,11/3/2012,"Server was great! I had the old fashion burger. o m g... saltiest thing i've had in a longgg time! the FRIES were salty too!!! they were so salty that my tongue started to hurt! I've been to cheesecake factory maybe 2 or 3 times, but i never remember enjoying my meal that much.  Cheesecakes are pretty good. a little bit on the sweet side, but I like their flavors that they offer."
Kressler N.,"Orange County, United States",66,368,1730,4.0,24/4/2009,"Tourist trap?  Yes. Am I a tourist in SF? Yes. Ok, I know it's Union Square...and it's the famous Macy's...and it's the Cheesecake Factory.  And I also know it's SF and there are a million wonderful restaurants to eat at but sometimes I like the familiar and late on a Saturday night, there were few other choices that allowed my friends and I to eat/drink. We were lucky to find a table in the bar area so we sat down right away.  It is quite busy and I assume it's like this all the time.  My friends wanted a drink that was no longer on the menu so they asked if they could still make it and they did.  They also asked for the recipe and the bartender gave them the components so they could make the drinks themselves.  I ordered a Georgia peach which was super fruity and delicious.   None of us ordered cheesecake...and when I think about it, we don't usually order cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory.  Odd.  We did order the warm apple crisp and the mud pie...it was too much, even to share.   Overall, we had great service, food and drink..."
Jon K.,"Millbrae, United States",481,127,79,3.0,24/2/2011,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is like a magnet for tourists; but who can blame them. The location sits on top of Macy's with a great few of the City and Union Square and even has some pretty good choices of food.  If you plan to have dinner here you've got to get in line really early; like most say, it can get really busy with the combination of tourists and locals who go to take in the view and dining. I personal had to wait 1 hour for my group of 7; but turn bad news into good news by heading around the mall or downstairs into Macy's (there's almost always a sale!).  Our group ordered an array of appetizers because most of us weren't that hungry for a large meal so we all picked plates that appealed to us. The fried mac n cheese tastes the best when it is freshly brought to your table, otherwise it cools and loses a lot of taste and flavor quickly. The avacodo rolls were probably one of the top picks of the night, very well seasoned with great texture. Of all the places I've recently ordered sweet potato fries from, Cheesecake has got this recipe down; the combination of sweet and saltiness flavors just hits your pallet perfectly; the basket lasted maybe 10 minutes. We also ordered the buffalo wings, sliders, a side of normal fries and fried calamari, all which tasted good, but were nothing to really brag about.  As an entree, my gf and I shared the garlic pasta with chicken where we substituted angel hair instead of spaghetti; the dish smelled amazing! However, it seemed as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time because the top bits of shitake mushroom on our dish were more cooked than the ones underneath and the pasta seemed dry, perhaps because there was little sauce present in the dish. Still, both of us really enjoyed this dish and felt it was bold in flavor and taste.  The only true downside to the meal which unfortunately was a really big downer was that throughout the entire meal, it was almost impossible to get the attention of our waitress. Once we were seated it seemed as if we had another wait simply to get our orders of water. On multiple occasions we were forced to call another waiter over to order our drinks, our dinner and to get the check. Having struck out on all the important times to hit our table we saw the waiter from the table on the other side of the room more often than we saw her.  Like any other busy restaurant, get there early and beat the crowd so you can enjoy the food and the view. I've been to this place 20+ times, which has got to show something; this restaurant usually has good food and good service; I guess everyone's entitled to their bad days right? At least, I'll be back for another taste later on this year that's for sure."
Tina F.,"San Francisco, United States",281,106,,3.0,17/4/2012,"Super busy which is pretty obnoxious,but it's a great location with a beautiful view. I like to go during the winter to look out onto the Union Square ice skating rink. Cheesecake is amazing and there is an extensive menu filled with many options."
Tracy O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",7,28,8,4.0,18/3/2014,"Gluten free menu - just ask for it! Even have gluten free buns, very tasty too. Fries can't be cooked separately but they offer mashed potatoes or other sides. Cocktails also yum!"
Vivian H.,"Seattle, United States",330,891,1610,4.0,19/3/2009,"This is where 99 out of 100 birthday lunches and dinners were held in high school. This is where I would go to eat with friends when we were feeling a little fancy... in high school. This is a restaurant you always go to at least once with each boyfriend. I love the view from this restaurant but I have never opted to sit outside, since I know how the wind in SF can be. The food is pretty tasty, especially the avocado eggrolls and Evelyn's favorite pasta.  The portions are always filling and I almost always have to take it home.  The bread is good too (that's always important to me). The wait to get a table always seems to go by really quickly for some reason. Now that I've been out of high school and the Cheesecake Factory ""trend"" that was a part of it, I opt to eat elsewhere and try new restaurants.  But really, there is nothing wrong with the Cheesecake Factory."
Emma H.,"San Francisco, United States",214,425,202,5.0,17/10/2011,"I love me some Cheesecake factory. I always get the Renee's Special. ""Half a sandwich"" is really a whole sandwich- the chicken salad is bomb. The soup is always ridic. good and the salad is the healthy part :) this is a platter of food for $9 people. Skip the cheesecake in my opinion, overrated and over priced unless you go when it's piumpkin cheesecake season, in that case get like 20 whole cheesecakes."
Meghan P.,"Woodside, United States",3059,1070,12,4.0,2/2/2009,"I really miss the huge plate of onion strings that the Cheesecake Factory used to serve. Please please please bring them back! They would definitely be worth at least a star to me! This Cheesecake Factory is fun though because you can sit outside on the deck with an amazing view of Union Square. It's phenomenal! Then, you can order anything your heart desires from their extensive menu. I usually pick one of the extra, extra large salads such as the chinese chicken salad. The drinks at this Cheesecake aren't quite as yummy as those I've imbibed at others... they are still creative though! If you have any space left after dinner, you should definitely opt for their namesake cheesecake. Yum, yum, delish!"
