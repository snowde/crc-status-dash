Johanah I.,"South San Francisco, United States",112,107,53,4.0,23/2/2012,"Came here the day after Valentine's Day, and it was a really nice experience. I came here around 6-7pm on a Wednesday night, so the place was loud and packed with people sitting on the 'waiting' benches or outside lounging on the chairs. My friend and I got there and they asked us to wait for 30 minutes, so that`s not bad at all. I liked it because their timing was right on, we waited around that time and we had to wait another 5 minutes to get seated. My friend really wanted to eat outside, and I wasn`t so sure about it because of my fear of having birds fly over me, and I thought I was going to freeze that night because  the wind was picking up. What I didn`t know until I went outside was that they have those nice heater lamps around every table, and I didn`t see any birds at all. Everything else was great, the service was very friendly and attentive. All of the foods come in HUGE portions! Not joking! We ordered appetizers, entree's, and cheesecake, we ended up having to take most of the food home! It`s definitely a nice place to go back to if you`re patient with waiting, no rush, because especially since this restaurant is in a popular spot located on the top of Macys, expect this place to always be BUSY! Also if you are willing to spend a pretty penny on good food, come here! I would love to come back again some time :)"
Tien H.,"San Francisco, United States",9,99,8,4.0,9/10/2011,"It's a great place to eat and enjoy a slice of delicious cheesecake, but I stopped in to buy a whole cheesecake the other day and boy did they pissed me off. Honestly, all they had to do was bring the cake from the freezer, put it in a box, bag it, and give it to me, but I literally waited half an hour till I was able to get my cake. That is RIDICULOUS!  They had a lot of people just standing around too, yet it took them that long to get my cake boxed up and hand it to me. I find that unforgivable in terms of service. HOWEVER, the cheesecake is always delicious, the food is tasty and the portion size is quite nice."
Matt B.,"Victoria, Canada",104,58,3,3.0,5/9/2011,"My coworkers and I shared nachos and guacamole as an appetizer.   The dip was really addictive, but maybe I just like avocados too much.  I ordered the Four Seasons pizza which has four variations of toppings on the same pie.   The only reason I wouldn't be tempted to come back was because we arrived at one of their peak business hours (lunchtime) and it was a little crowded and noisy for my taste."
Scotty D.,"Pleasanton, United States",2049,1139,1426,3.0,25/6/2011,"PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CHEESECAKE! OMG WOW! ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CHEESECAKE! SAME THING! ok so has anyone ever actually been able to successfully finish some cheesecake after eating a full on meal here? the portions are sooo damn huge here! even a starter salad is as big as an entree salad at any other place. any given entrees quite the huge portion so you always get more than your moneys worth. i love that they serve a sweet brown bread with the meal, it's sooo darn good.  you must get the fried macaroni and cheese balls in marinara and the factory made meatloaf. both are TO DIE FOR! and as for the cheesecake i suggest you grab some to go. you must try my favorites.... pineapple upside down cheesecake crazy carrot cake cheesecake pumpkin cheesecake pumpkin pecan cheesecake adam's peanut butter cheesecake all in all the cheesecake factory is a good dining experience and with an insanely huge menu you cant go wrong. JUST GO HUNGRY!!!"
Vijay R.,"Fort Worth, United States",0,8,,1.0,12/5/2015,Very rude staff... I asked for a mango key lime cheese cake to go after seeing it in the display... Staff always said the cake isn't available ... Hopeless
Paul B.,"Dallas, United States",176,241,2,5.0,22/3/2012,"The food and service at this Cheesecake factory are nothing out of the ordinary. It's pretty much just like any other Cheesecake factory in those respects. But the view! This Cheesecake factory sits on the top floor of the Macy's building in Union Square Park, and it really is a great view. It is a chain restaurant, but it feels like you're eating at the coolest spot in the city when your'e there.  Expect a long wait if you go there. It's a cool spot, and everyone else knows it, so it could take you a while to be seated. I think it's worth it though. Enjoy!"
Karen Y.,"San Rafael, United States",74,102,275,4.0,22/5/2011,"A wait to get seated is a given here as there are no reservations, I've come to accept that and plan accordingly based on the time or day of the week it is. Expect around an hour wait on weekends and maybe Friday nights.   :( slippery floor that gives me a scare every single time I'm there because one of my feet always slides on the greasy marble. overpriced drinks. often very oily food.  :) huge selection of food and, of course, cheesecakes to suit your cravings. complimentary sourdough and wheat/rye bread. very generous portions. very rich and boldly-flavored food, which are in my opinion DELICIOUS.  Three dishes I'm most familiar with:  Avocado Eggroll appetizers are yummy, crispy with a sweet-sour tamarind sauce but I can't eat more than one or two of these because there is so much avocado it's a bit overwhelming.  Quesadilla appetizer- crispy tortilla with cheese, green onions, chiles, chicken, sour cream and guacamole. Delicious and very filling. Bistro Shrimp Pasta- CRAVE this pasta whenever I'm at the Factory. The menu description tells you exactly why: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. Lastly, what makes everything worthwhile is a nice fat slice of cheesecake of your choice.. I can never get bored with all the different kinds they have, let the piggying out commence!!"
Liu W.,"Inner Richmond, San Francisco, United States",2,1,,3.0,3/11/2013,I really don't understand of their administration as there are tons of table here but they let the customers wait and wait and wait. Even though the foods really and the service of dishes are really great but the way they let us wait for 30 min (even there are tons of table) is uncompromisingly unacceptable .... Improve your administration ... Or you destroy yourself by yourself ...
Karm P.,"Fremont, United States",18,19,37,4.0,10/6/2014,Cheesecake Factory what can i say.........cheesecakes are best here.......long waits for a table suck cuz this place is always packed due to a lot of shoppers and tourist not a bad thing but just a wait.......food is ok as always menu been same a long time needs an update.....but again the CheeseCakes make up for everything..
Jae C.,"San Diego, United States",3,106,442,4.0,10/1/2011,"I've been to a LOT of cheesecake factories and in my opinion, this particular cheescake factory is thee best! The view is priceless. It's located on the top floor of the giant Macy's so it basically overlooks San Francisco.  Their pasta dishes are usually HUGEEE. and their cheesecakes are pretty good. All cheesecake factories basically offer the same dishes. I just enjoy going to this particular one because of the gorgeous view."
Karina N.,"San Francisco, United States",5,33,,4.0,22/4/2012,"First time going there and the service was really good (maybe it was because I beat the lunch rush, went there half an hour after it opened). I forgot our waitresses name but she was so nice and very helpful. The restaurant itself had a nice decor. The cheesecake was delicious as ever!! I could buy a tons! However, the food was only 'okay'. I ordered the Garlic Pasta with Chicken and the chicken was a little too burnt and the pasta was way too salty! My friends also ordered pasta and they said it either had too much pepper or also too salty. I would come back but maybe not for the pasta."
Kate C.,"San Francisco, United States",1,19,2,3.0,29/8/2012,"Same as all other cheesecake factory restaurants... but an hour long wait in line.  I love cheesecake factory food, but don't want to wait this long for it. Since I live 3 blocks away and don't have a car, this is the only one I can come............."
Elizabeth V.,"San Jose, United States",4,21,10,4.0,18/3/2014,Came to this Cheesecake Factory because we were in the area. It was around 2PM and the elevator was so full. We entered the restaurant and it was packed. They seated us (2 people) fairly quickly and our waiter was very nice. Our food was delicious as well. I've had several plates at Cheesecake and none of them have ever let me down!
Tanya N.,"Mountain View, United States",95,396,371,2.0,27/11/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory always reminds me of going outlet shopping in Buffalo with my friends back when I lived in Toronto. We always made it a point to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory where the portions are huge, their complimentary bread is delicious and of course, the two page menu of cheesecake.  The one in Macy's in always packed and the standard wait time seems to always be 1.5 hours.  I had a friend come in town who LOVES this place so we waited for two hours to be seated.  Since it's in Macy's we roamed around the department store for about an hour and then sat around the sofas on the 7th floor below the restaurant until our buzzer went off.   Service was good.  Our waitress seemed to be on hyperdrive but I guess you have to be since it's so busy.  I had the Tomato Basil Pasta which was the worst pasta I've had - even compared to food court pasta.  It was clearly pasta that has been sitting under the warmer for too long as the pasta along the edges were dried out so they shrunk in size a bit, hard and chewy.  Terrible.  I tried mixing it with the sauce but nothing could be done.  I think when this place get too crazy they try to find short cuts to make service faster but this was a fail.  Utterly disappointed.  I then shared a lemon raspberry cheesecake slice which was great since it was one of the lighter cakes there I didn't walk out completely stuffed.  Service was great, they had warm bread (love warm bread) and the cheesecake were awesome.  The main sucked."
Blanca P.,"Edgewood Park, San Carlos, United States",23,5,,4.0,16/3/2014,"The wait time can be a bit ridiculous, super long but expected considering it's a tourist hot spot. But totally worth it. Came here for drinks and dessert. Strawberry shortcake was absolutely delicious! The drinks are a bit on the weak side but still delicious."
Anthony V.,"Hayward, United States",147,179,,3.0,8/4/2012,I really enjoyed this place. I received good service and enjoyed my food. Also you get a great view if you decide to eat outdoors. It is really nice. Beware of the long lines since they don't take reservations. Don't eat here if you want to grab a quick bite of food.
Hao T.,"San Francisco, United States",2,1,,1.0,2/5/2015,"Today was my far the WORST experience I've ever had at Cheesecake Factory. The server was NEVER around our table. The server also got not all but most of our orders wrong. We asked for a Oreo milkshake but that never showed up so when the check came the Oreo milkshake was still on the bill. While it was our fault that we should've asked our server to get the drink for us he was never around our table. We had to resort to asking another server. So we confronted him about the milkshake and asked for it to be taken off our bill. He rolled his eyes, scrunched up his face and said, ""Next time you should ask your server to take your order and not another that applies to all the restaurants."" This experience was most unpleasant and I hope that they will teach their staff what proper manner is before they should serve their customers. Next time I come to The Cheesecake Factory I hope this will not happen again."
Tiffany V.,"San Francisco, United States",579,701,656,4.0,18/4/2009,"I used to come here all the time when I was younger. I have no idea why this place has such a bad rep. I guess just because it's considered a tourist destination.  My brother and his wife wanted to meet my new loverman. Originally we were supposed to go to the restaurant above the SF Center but everybody got confused and thought it was The Cheesecake Factory so The Cheesecake Factory it was!  The place was packed as usual. We went at 12:30 on a Saturday. It was incredibly hot inside! I was like drenched in sweat. Haha. I really loved their bread basket. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but it was dark and amazing.  I ordered the Miso Salmon which my sister-in-law told me was one of her favorites. I asked her if it was like miso soup but it's completely different. I was wondering what it came with since it didn't say. It ended up coming on a bed of white rice which I didn't eat (empty carbs!) and some green beans. It was amazing! I hate when I get overcooked salmon but this one was cooked perfectly. I kind of wish it came with a different side though.  My loverman ordered the Herb Encrusted Salmon. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I have no idea whether or not it was good or not. Haha, I forgot to ask. My sister-in-law had the Boston Salad which looked amazing. I would've tried some had there not been meat all over it. She also ordered this salad from their new snack/small plates menu. It was some greens, goat cheese, and beets. She substituted the goat cheese with blue cheese. She kept raving about it. I hate beets and I'm allergic to mold so I question her tastes. My brother got the pasta carbonara which looked really oily but he said it was good. None of us ordered dessert, much to my sister-in-laws surprise. She really wanted to order a cheesecake but since we all weren't ordering anything, she didn't either.  My brother paid for our lunch. It ended up being $69 total, including a $10 tip. I really enjoyed the lunch and thought the atmosphere was  great and appropriate for the occasion. We had a great waitress too.  Minus one star because they don't post their nutrition information and because everyone knows all their food is a dieters nightmare."
Daniel D.,"Concord, United States",827,462,315,4.0,12/12/2011,"So.. My GF called this place at 8:30pm on a super busy Saturday and were told it was going to be a 2 hour wait! OMG! B -- S -- Typical SF parking = sucks or you can pay the big $$$ -- Prepare to WAIT unless you get lucky :p -- Way too many options -- Huge portions -- Service can be hit or miss -- Bar area for my drinkers -- Cheesecake to-go -- SF Healthy Tax included in your bill We thought about going elsewhere, maybe even The Burger Bar or Nordstrom's Bistro Cafe but something inside me said ""cheesecake."" Despite what seemed like a thousand people out in Union Square and probably another 100+ people waiting to be seated, we put our names in for 2 at around 8:45pm. Around 9:15pm, my GF checked in with the hosts and we were told it would be another 50 minutes. For some reason it didn't phase me and BOOM, our pager started vibrating. We had water and bread in only a few minutes. Our waiter was super attentive and we got our food in less than 15 - 20 minutes. We even got 2 Passion Fruit Mojitos that were pretty strong but tasty :) Our food came out hot and fresh. The portions were huge like usual and we ended up getting some cheesecake to go because we were so full. I was really impressed with our server, but I think he was off so the new guy was just ok after taking our table over. Normally I'd give 3 stars but the fact that we were sat down in less than half the time we had expected and the service was good, I'm giving them 4 stars.  *Warning*  In general, I try to avoid this chain restaurant but it's a decent choice when in Union Square and when you're not trying to spend $100+ on dinner."
