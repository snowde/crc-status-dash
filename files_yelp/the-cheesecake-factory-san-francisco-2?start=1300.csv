Rachel L.,"Alameda, United States",27,48,2,4.0,22/2/2012,Food = Excellent Service = Very Good Line Wait = Poor Cheesecakes = Excellent Im giving a rating of 4 stars for the food and delicious cheesecakes.
Janice C.,"San Francisco, United States",528,2174,5892,2.0,6/1/2009,"A word to the wise: don't go here if you are past the point of hunger and want to be seated right away. Even at typically dead hours for a restaurant (say, 2 or 3 pm) there is still a wait. Yes, minimum of 30 minutes.  If you happen to be in the area, this is a great place to down a couple of drinks while you rest your tired feet from all day shopping at Union Square. The drinks are pricey, usually in the $10 plus range. I'm not really a cheesecake kinda girl, but the Kahlua cheesecake is totally worth the calories. (or maybe, even the wait)"
Crystal C.,"South San Francisco, United States",451,224,184,2.0,6/9/2011,"This was my favorite restaurant growing up. And I used to love eating here. After this experience. Not so much! They messed up my meal, (I'm picky). And the spaghetti was way too salty. Service was slow. I would trade this with Bjs anyday! It was better back when I didn't know what good was.."
Alex G.,"Hoboken, United States",387,129,7,5.0,28/9/2011,"It is always a great experience dining here. The food is always tasty and the service is seldom sub-par. I recommend the chicken parm sandwich; it is to die for.  Follow that off with a slice of the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, and you are surely in for a rich, tasty dinner."
Nhung T.,"Oakland, United States",208,773,,3.0,3/1/2012,"This place was super crowded, but I was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. As always, the food was good. I had the Caesar salad with chicken, it was really yummy and the dressing was light (3.5 stars). I also had the chicken salad sandwich; didn't like it too much. Think a tuna sandwich might tasted better but it was decent.. I love their white raspberry truffle cheesecake, my favorite. I can get an entire pie!!"
Tiffany H.,"Alameda, United States",465,643,1932,5.0,24/1/2009,"Come on, guys!  What's there to hate about the Cheesecake Factory besides the wait?  And the occasional loony server?  The food is great, the amount is enough to feed a small country, the price is right, the desserts (whether or not you like cheesecake) are fantastic, and the vibe is awesome!  I always have a great time here with my friends and family and just knowing that I'm in the downtown SF Cheesecake Factory out of all the other possible ones just makes it that much better.  Cheers to that!"
maria K.,"San Francisco, United States",42,99,4,1.0,22/3/2011,"This review is purely for the take-out service. Last night my friend and I were in a hurry. We needed to get in/get out fast and opted to call in for take out. They answered right away, and asked to put us on a ""brief hold. Oprative word here folks ""BREIF."" 5 minutes of holding later, My bff decided to call from her phone as well- and got a busy signal. While making a quick pit stop I handed my phone to her, ran in and out of the store, and when I returned she was STILL on hold on my phone, and now had her phone also on hold. Now 20 minutes later were AT the Cheesecake Factory still on hold, mind you no one has EVER picked up to say one moment, we'll be right with you. Zip. Zilch. Nada... now for 23 minutes. We asked to speak to the manager, and showed her both of our phones, on hold for now- 25 minutes with no answer. We ordered 1 meal and 2 cheesecakes, which mind you we had to wait another 15/20 minutes for them to cook. The manager comped the cheesecake, and charged her for the food ($20.) I feel like she shouldve comped the whole thing personally. That's just awful service! Why even have a phone number Cheescake factory? You clearly dont use it!"
Victoria C.,"Daly City, United States",853,318,230,3.0,29/11/2012,"What a wonderful night my husband planned for me.  Ice skating in union square, shopping at Macy's and dinner at Cheesecake Factory. The instant you walk in, the ambiance changes completely.  It's like you're in another place and you hardly notice that it's in Macy's.  On top to be exact, as it has spectacular views of Union Square.  It's a must see, especially since it's Christmas time and all of the lights are up.  So gorgeous! Waits can be long so make reservations.  Staff was great and our waiter was so nice.  He totally indulged all my wacky additions and subtractions to my salad.  Even though my order was wrong because of a misscommunication, he totally handled it well and brought me the corrected order right away. Among the many complaints I have about Cheesecake Factory as a whole, I was really shocked to see that their menu no longer has the calorie counts on them.  Seeing their previous calorie counts made me not want to eat there but at least I knew what I was getting into.  Because I felt like I was going into ordering blind, I opted for a Grilled Chicken Salad W/ Mango (normally known as the Luau Salad?)  I was NOT happy with the portions of everything.  They give you ENORMOUS amounts of the fatty food but they are totally stingy with the healthy stuff.  The lettuce was plentiful but the mangoes were chopped up really finely so I probably was given only 2 tablespoons at the most.  I expected big chunks of mango.  It was actually more of a ""salsa"" which added a ton of flavor to the salad so it didn't need any dressing.  Same thing for the bell peppers.  Tiny portions.  The chicken was a little better but dry as all hell.  I can only assume that they cook it days before and freeze it, then thaw it out.  No flavor what-so-ever.   Their menu is so overwhelming!  Make sure to take a look at the menu before you go so you aren't sitting there stressed about having to decide. The appetizer was completely tasteless.  We ordered the mac and cheese and it was very bland.  Not impressed with it's flavor of the sauce it was in at all. My husband's entree, a chicken pasta thing, wasn't good at all.  WAY too spicy, yet it lacked flavor.  Again, he got a huge plate that he only ate about 1/4 of, which is the correct serving for one person.  The rest is now sitting in our fridge, collecting mold. Their wheat bread was good but they started giving the packets of butter.  I remember getting fresh butter not too long ago. I have also never been a fan of their cheesecake so dessert wasn't an option.  I once tried like 6 flavors and not one was good.  I totally had Goldilocks Syndrome.  Coconut was too sweet, chocolate was too dry, plain was too bland, strawberry was almost good but still not impressive.  For literally a Cheesecake Factory, I would expect that each cheesecake would be phenomenal but they always miss the bar.  I can only conjecture that they are not made fresh at the restaurant and are mass produced from a warehouse somewhere and delivered.  But I could be wrong.  It would explain the bland, been frozen too long taste. I think I may have just out grown these generic, corporate restaurants.  I like my food to be fresh, tasty and healthy.  You won't really find that here but it's a great place to meet up with people and have drinks after work or before a night out on the town.  Even then, there are hundreds of other restaurants that are actually good."
michelle h.,"Oakland, United States",30,202,180,3.0,30/12/2011,"This location is just a-okay. I love their buffalo blast & ceasar salad. Once I came with bf, and they ran out of the buffalo blast! The wait can be a little frustrating...since there are so many people and shoppers! I like to put my name in for a table and grabbing the pager with me, and go shopping first. I go back upstairs 15 minutes from the time they tell you, and walahhhh the wait is over! Service wise...was just okay. They don't pay much attention to you since they have so many people...you kinda need to waive them down to get something. I prefer the Pleasanton location over this..I think the food tastes better there, and that the service is better."
Gaby B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,17/11/2014,Clean your tables before people is going to eat a dessert is no nice eat cheescake dessert witn dearty table :(
Jessica A.,"San Francisco, United States",638,215,416,4.0,26/6/2011,"When I'm looking to have a nice lunch/dinner in downtown SF, this is one of the places that comes to mind. It's located on the top floor of Macy's Union Square. GREAT VIEW of Union Square. Even better view on a nice SF day, but those are a hit or miss, haha! Pasta Da Vinci - LOVEEEEEE!!!!! I first tried this a couple years back & loved it. Then, they took it off the menu, but they still would make it if I ordered it. & then it's back on the menu again. My friend, who isn't a fan of white sauce, enjoyed it too. It's SOOOO GOOOD! Satisfied each & every time :) Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake - YUM! YUM! YUM! Probably one of the best red velvet goodies ever! It's tastes sooo rich. Not too sweet either. It's a huge piece (w/ a bajillion calories, haha!), so I recommend sharing.  Portions are huge. Even if I have the lunch portion, I still have leftovers.  Customer service is really good here. They're really nice & I typically don't have any complaints. The wait here is RIDICULOUSSS!!! I try not to come at peak times..especially on the weekends. Be ready to wait! Luckily, there's shopping right there (but the pagers don't go too far)."
Mahta P.,"San Francisco, United States",260,80,2,4.0,13/3/2012,"It is possible to eat healthy at the Cheesecake factory. I swear. Salmon with broccoli and carrots all sauces on the side. Not bad. It's also possible to eat two days of calories and dangerous levels of sugar and fat if not careful when ordering.  All in all, the salmon was yummy. Will I give up going to The Plant anytime soon? No. But in a pinch the Cheesecake Factory can work."
Alicia A.,"Contra Costa, United States",93,190,127,4.0,1/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is a-ok. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but this one in particular has a huge advantage because of its amazing view. I looked down and I was waving at my best friend Tiffany :)"
Mohamed S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,5.0,20/5/2014,Enjoyed the night and enjoyed the food taste and people help and nice treatment ...may be little expensive but it deserve
Patra B.,"San Francisco, United States",1259,552,2173,4.0,28/12/2008,"My roommate and I were in charge of dessert for our friend's holiday party.  Unfortunately, the place we wanted to get cheesecake from was closed for the holidays until after New Year's.  =( We were just going to go to Costco to get a ginormous cheesecake, but as we were shopping our hearts out in Union Square, we decided to check out The Cheesecake Factory.  Round and round we went up the escalators...then we had to squeeeeeze our way through the massive crowd waiting to be seated.  Since it was the day after Christmas, they were sold out of alot of flavors.  We ended up getting an Oreo Cheesecake(   ) and a White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake(   ).  Both were quite delicious.  I've never tried a cheesecake that I didn't like from here. Just a note:  Let the cheesecake sit out for a bit or it'll still be frozen inside.  =P"
Alice K.,"Springfield, United States",23,10,6,4.0,19/7/2013,"I went there a while ago with one of my friends and we were waiting for like 45 mins and couldn't get the seat yet. So, we didn't want to wait anymore and left. I went there again with another friend of mine at 11:30noon on Tuesday and it was already packed. Luckily no wait at all. We took the seat from outside as it was nice weather and quite nice to see union square. They have a huge menu and couldn't even decide what to choose. The customer service is very good. I ordered Miso Salmon lunch portion and it was quite big, I couldn't even finish it.  It was soooo goooood and I was like no wonder this place is always packed. Worth every penny there. :D We ordered Tiramisu cheesecake as in desserts. That was a cheesecake to die for.   :D"
Christy M.,"Bakersfield, United States",0,17,2,2.0,21/7/2012,"We had dinner there on Friday.  We were both pretty surprised how bland our dinner tasted.  Tom had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya.  I had the ahi tuna over rice.  Tom mentioned how there wasn't any taste to  his food.  He ordered this because the menu stated it was spicy.  The onions, bell peppers, pasta and chicken were tasteless.  My ahi was seared okay, but I needed soy sauce to add flavor. We do not plan on eating there again because of the amount of time we had to wait, the tasteless food and know there are such a variety of restaurants to choose from. Hope you can use this review."
Sharjah M.,"San Francisco, United States",35,132,97,4.0,20/12/2011,"Their white chocolate raspberry truffle is bomb dot com! I wasn't really into the pasta but the cheesecakes are off the hook! Especially of course its what they are known for! One time my friend and I came to Cheesecake Factory and we were just there for desserts.  I am hooked! The only problem is that parking sucks! Take bart or park at the garage on 4th and mission or on the weekends wait until after 6pm to park on the streets.  What sucks though is the over hour wait! My first time we waited over an hour because it was raining so the people that were seated outside are seated inside the restaurant.  But anyway, prepare yourself for the wait cause it can definitely test your patience."
Tj J.,"San Francisco, United States",12,40,5,5.0,19/3/2014,"7$ for a ccheesecake this good is worth it. Authentic, and homemade!!! What more can you want?? Good luck tryna get a seat outside cause its ALWAYS packed."
Serene H.,"San Pablo, United States",92,137,42,3.0,25/1/2012,"Had dinner here on a Saturday evening with my co workers. Beautiful scenery from the top outdoors. Friendly, but could be friendlier service. And good food :)  We walked in, to be told that there will be an hour wait for a table indoors. We really really really wanted to eat there so we said okay, we'll wait. Maybe pass time by walking around the city, yeah? But then they told us that if we wanted to sit outdoors, they had a table ready. So we accepted the table and went on our way.  The first thing I noticed while outside were the wonderful heaters to keep us warm :) I was so thankful for those. Had they not had them, we'd definitely be freezing.  We had about 15 mins to look through the menu, the waiter came around once to ask if we were ready to order. And no we were not, but some drinks would've been nice. This waiter did not ask if we would like anything to drink while waiting. Thumbs down.  My coworkers ordered the orange chicken, and pasta fettuccini. And I ordered the jambalaya pasta. Everyone was pretty satisfied with their food. Portions were huge so we had to pack some to go.  But right after! Another downside: my co worker found traces of food/soap residue on her glass for water. Disgusting. I'd hope they check their glasses before giving them out next time.  Dessert!! I had the ultimate red velvet cheesecake, my workers had the strawberry cheesecake, and the hershey cheesecake. One word: fantastic.  Overall pretty good visit. We had a good time. The bad evened out with good. I'll be back, but next time I know what to look for."
