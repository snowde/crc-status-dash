Julia D.,"London, United Kingdom",247,588,234,4.0,3/11/2011,"This is something that I have to come out to my friends about---I love it here.  My favorite things are the BBQ ranch chicken salad, the apple cobbler, and the unlimited sodas.  I'd recommend getting a table at the bar if there's a long wait.  Mario is my favorite server--he is also a former intern at Lauren Conrad's fashion line, yeah...so he's great.   I think this is a fun place to people watch.  I have never been bored here--which is a big statement."
Susan C.,"Toronto, Canada",6,190,,5.0,7/8/2011,"My favourite restaurant in America! Of course, my San Fran trip would not been complete without going to The Cheesecake Factory.  I came on Forth of July and it was crazy. But, I was told the 45 minute for a table for 3 was the norm for this location. We had two waiter, since our original one went on break and we got a new one, but both were extremely nice and gives a good recommendation on which pasta plates are amazing. The food portion is huge and filling. I should have just shared my plate with my cousin, but I didn't believe her on how big the plates are. It was so tasty, but since it was so filling, I was upset we couldn't fit in dessert.  I will def. return to any Cheesecake Factory and make sure I save some room for a cheesecake! :D"
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, United States",266,876,2178,3.0,20/9/2009,"This place is crazy busy, especially on a Saturday night! One of my friends picked this place for her bday dinner. They can only accommodate 8 or less a table. We had a party of 12. They do not take reservations. We waited about an hour and a half to finally get a table.  While we waited we went downstairs to Macy's and browsed around. The restaurant looks nice and clean. Also, I do like how it is on the 8th floor and if you go out onto the balcony you can look at the view of downtown SF. Overall, the staff was very friendly and the food portions were huge! You always take home leftovers."
kevan h.,"Berkeley, United States",59,169,25,3.0,30/11/2011,"Located in Union Square, prepare yourself for a long wait. Like most people have said, the food is nothing to gripe about: it's good ol' standard fare for a restaurant like this: very predictable, very pleasant and filling for hungry people. It'll put a dent in your pocketbook to be sure.  It won't be a dining experience so much as an eating one, and let's not kid ourselves: we're here for the cheesecake. We're here for the desserts. We're here because it's Union Square and located on the top floor of the Macy's, and that's what visitors to SF do. Plus, it's got a great view of the square, and it's certainly worth taking a picture, putting it on Twitter, and saying, ""Yes, I was here,"" and letting all my friends know. It's that sort of place."
Patrick V.,"San Diego, United States",20,49,84,3.0,9/1/2012,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of Macy's across from Union Square.  Seating options are indoor and outdoor.  There is usually a bit of a wait for a table depending on the time, you can call in advance to reserve.  Otherwise, you could end up waiting anywhere from 10-20 minutes. I personally prefer to sit indoors due to my paranoia of birds and bird droppings.  If the normally overcast sky of San Francisco is clear, this is a good outdoor dining area that will also give you a good view of the city. The food quality is pretty good.  Good ingredients, prepared well.  The style of food here is varied but does not stray too far from classic recipes.  There are traditional American dishes on the menu like Burgers, Meatloaf, Rotisserie Chicken, etc things that you would expect to see on a 'chain restaurant' menu but you will also see things like Fish Taco's,  Orange Chicken and Sheppards Pie on the menu.  The portions are HUGE!  I'm talking fat American size portions.  They do offer something they call ""lunch size"" portions on some of the dishes but most of them are way too big to finish in one sitting.  They have a full bar on one side of the restaurant. Prices are reasonable considering the amount of food.  I've never made it to desert which is a shame because their cheescakes and deserts look really good. Bathroom was clean and well kept!  Trust me, thats important.  You can tell a lot about a restaurant by seeing how well their bathroom is kept."
Brittany K.,"Edmonton, Canada",811,550,236,5.0,14/1/2011,"My last day in SF before flying home to snowy Edmonton = my last chance to eat outdoors in the sort-of sunshine to celebrate my birthday! I just snuck in and out of the actual restaurant, ordering a Reese Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Try saying that one five times fast! The decor in this place is pretty amazing, and I hope I have more time to eat in next time I'm in the area. But it was a treat simply to sneak a peek into this infamously busy dessert heaven. My slice was ready to go in a flash and topped off with whipped cream on the side. (Not being a fan of whipped cream, this was awesome. I simply hate when the cream is added right on top without my asking!) I took my cake to the square out front of Macy's and dug in. Chocolate cake inside of peanut butter cheesecake? I could have died. And in fact, I almost did when I couldn't even finish the damn thing. There's only two things I really love unconditionally love in life: Reese Peanut Butter, and cheesecake. Not to finish an amazing combo of the two is a sure sign of the richness and size of my piece. I am counting down the days until I can come back and defeat that cheesecake!"
Stella Y.,"Los Angeles, United States",819,704,512,4.0,15/9/2011,"I think having about 4 menu pages of cheesecake qualifies calling them the cheesecake factory! Unfortunately, i didn't have a slice (or 2!) due to the rather large plate of food that was ordered. I had the chicken bellagio which sounded oh so delicious with its crusted chicken on top of Basil pasta with a cheese cream sauce. The first bite was good but a little bit disappointing. The chicken and pasta had 2 things in common: both were very flavorful but overly salty and dry. The pasta was also a bit undercooked, thus not too soft to the bite. Food was 3 stars. What pushed it over for 4 stars was the gorgeous sunny day with outdoor seating, a fantastic 8th floor view of union square and the best date that was smart enough to make a reservation so that we didn't have to wait! Next time, i should just skip  lunch and ordered dessert like i wanted to in the first place!"
Bobby C.,"Koreatown, Manhattan, United States",38,112,52,5.0,15/2/2014,"One of my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations that I have been to! Pretty much everything is good on their menu! I've never had dish which I didn't like! My favorites are the complimentary wheat bread, the BBQ Salmon, and Chicken Bellagio! All their pastas are amazing as well! Awesome locations and awesome ambiance and environment inside!"
Brian K.,"Fremont, United States",0,23,,1.0,4/4/2015,"The waiting system they have is extremely ineffective. You stand in a line for 10 minutes to put your name in and they tell you it will be able 30-40 minutes and they page you or text you to let you know your table is ready. After they page you, you go up and fight through the same line to bring your slip of paper up there to ""check in"". Then you stand off to the side to wait another 30-40 minutes for your name to be called. I was joking around with people waiting who had also been paged and tried to keep a good sense of humor about it, but many of them were waiting 40+ minutes AFTER they had already been paged. I started noticing that people who were waiting with me went up to the servers to complain about their wait and soon after were seated. So eventually I had to go up again, like everyone else, to complain that I had been waiting for 35-40 minutes AFTER I had already been paged. The guy then misunderstood me thinking I had JUST shown up after missing my page, which REALLY made me mad. My sense of humor was gone at that point and I loudly explained that it was not the case. We were then finally seated five minutes later.  I am writing this review waiting for my food. This review has nothing to do with the food (i assume as good as any standard cheesecake factory), only with the ridiculously bad waiting system that they have. Never again will I come here during regular dining hours on a weekend."
Amanda S.,"Campbell, United States",293,418,17,4.0,26/12/2010,"There's honestly nothing SUPER special about this place. It's just like any other Cheesecake Factory- but there is a pretty amazing balcony with gorgeous views of San Francisco. If you end up in the city on a bright and sunny day and find yourself in Union Square I definitely recommend it. Also if you're finished with a day full of shopping come in for a nice hot spiked drink and watch the ice skaters and all the gorgeous christmas lights! The portions.. are.. HUGE. even when I order a ""lunch"" portion which is supposed to be significantly smaller, I still take home half of it.  I've had pretty much everything here. Usually my girls and I order a TON of apps and share a huge salad. The road side sliders are a great way to start off. The fried macaroni and cheese is pretty good but in my opinion a bit salty..? Southern fried chicken sliders are yummy and have a small kick (paprika?) that I love! The sweet corn tamale cakes are actually fairly decent for the size and yummy. The samosas.. yeh I've had better. Crabcakes- stfu. So yummy. I have never met a crabcake I didnt like.. Last time I was here I had the fish tacos. SO EFFING AMAZING. I wanna say it was around $13 and I got 4 huge delicious tacos filled with veggies and avocado. UGH. I died. I like every salad minus the iceburg salad (who seriously wants to pay $12 for a head of lettuce?) and their mixed drinks are delicious. In the past 8 years I've dined at any Cheesecake Factory I've yet to have any of their cheesecake... I'm not a huge fan.. but if I ever do I'll report back!"
nicole d.,"San Francisco, United States",14,6,,1.0,9/12/2012,I waited for over an hour for them to finally inform me they hadn't put in my order.
Leily P.,"Oakland, United States",53,615,39,3.0,3/12/2012,The wait is always an hour except how can you not love a place that offers cheesecake with as many calories as the food.
Karry D.,"San Francisco, United States",66,27,,2.0,30/12/2011,"So, I came here to eat with my relatives - my sister, my sister in law, and my two nieces. I'm never coming again. Service and food pretty much sucked that night. My chicken costoletta was pretty oily unless it's the sauce but... I could see the oil separating from the sauce... hmmm... yum? NO! I ended up using the bathroom 2 hours later from it...  And goodness, service is horrible. We may look like children but geez... I have the Asian curse, damn you! I look young so don't ignore a small girl like me who is asking for your attention, waiters and a waitress. Yes, you got that right - I had three waiters, a female and two males. It was cool that the female went on break and the replacement told us... but... NO ONE TOLD US SHE CAME BACK! I kept looking for the bald, clean-shaven waiter but he was nowhere to be found. It's cool that she apologized but... seriously?! I'm tired."
Erni L.,"San Francisco, United States",27,59,,1.0,10/3/2012,"Believe the other 1 star review. This place is horrible. The servers are horrible too. It doesn't worth the long wait time. Eat here only if you have too much money to spend or if you're a really fancy person who wants to spend big money.  The last time we came here, we were served by this woman (I didn't bother to remember her name). Guess what? Whatever we asked for was never given. I wanted a new napkin, she completely forgot about it until I have to remind her and then she forgot again. Bread was never refilled. Food was served COLD! She probably completely forgot about us. She didn't even come back to ask if everything is okay.  Urgh. This place is horrible. Save your money for other restaurants, please."
Betty C.,"San Francisco, United States",373,695,189,5.0,30/8/2009,"It's a touristy chain restaurant and we live in the city but we are still giving Cheesecake on top of Macy's a 5 star for our experience.  We came here for a late night bite after attending a fundraiser for the typhoon victims in Taiwan. It was about 11pm when we arrived and the place was packed as the elevator door opened. Luckily the hostess told us it was only about a 15 minute wait and the buzzer rang only after a few minutes. We were escorted to a table outside and the view was beautiful but it was chilly outside and by the end of our meal we were ready for some heat! The place is definitely touristy, everyone around us seemed to be visiting and our waiter asked us where we were from but we weren't bothered by it. We ordered the burger and the cajun chicken tenders. Both plates were huge! We have never seen such a big portion for chicken bites and a big scoop of fresh mashed potatoes and corn came on the side.  The burger also came with a huge serving of fries.  We had to order the cheesecake of course and the pecan caramel chocolate cheesecake was undeniably rich decadent and delicious.  The cappuccinos we ordered also hit the spot on a cold San Francisco summer night. Our waiter was great and really friendly!  If you want to come here and not wait, come for a late bite like we did! We had a great time."
Adamma I.,"Oakland, United States",24,71,,5.0,31/10/2011,"I really really really appreciate the tastes, the ambiance,the huge quantities, the overwhelming variety, the rush of energy from all the people standing in line for an hour waiting their turn to experience the glory of the fabled CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Tip go to the Bar and hoover like a Vulture keeping an every watchful eye on the patrons. Even be as bold as the Raven/Crow and ask somebody, ""Hi are you almost done yet?"" For no wait time go after 9 definitely by 9:30pm its nearly empty. The Bar area also includes 3 0r 4 tables. This is how I receive faster seating. This Restaraunt is LOUD, fast paced, food and drinks come out slow, dishes are broken often, the dark bread is tasty, the view is AWESOME, the prices are like oooo that hurts so I am so glad it tasted good. The waiters I have had so far are quick to answer questions and take orders and it seem like it took 45 minutes for my food and drinks to come. Sorry I don't recall what I ate it was just good. The alcoholic Salty Caramel Millkshake($10) I drank had a dollop of Vodka, I mean I tasted the potency for 10 seconds then it was pure salty sweet yumness. My entree plus tax came up to $15 plus tip cost me $30 altogether. I go every six to 9 months cause of the price point which includes the admission to the city via BArt. I have eaten here 3 times."
Taelor R.,"San Francisco, United States",374,6,3,4.0,21/3/2014,"Bomb drinks! Michael at the bar, so friendly and cute pony tail. But table service not so good. Don't get Heidi as your server."
Brooklyn A.,"Oakland, United States",2,7,,5.0,21/3/2014,Seriously love this restaurant! Everything I've had has always been amazing! If you love crab I recommend the crab bites!
Peter W.,"San Francisco, United States",21,72,28,1.0,17/10/2012,"This location has always been a giant clusterF of waiting and crowds when walking in for a table inside. Once you've sat down though it used to get better. At least you'd get big portions and servers for the most part are professional and cordial. Nope not this time. After an hour long wait, we are finally seated at a table for two. which is very narrowly separated from the other tables to either side. Everything is pretty normal until we get our food and I notice that our server keeps squeezing herself in between our table and the table next to us to talk to the customer closer... it's a narrow space and although she is thin, she barely fits in there and is bumping our table and even accidentally steps on my foot, to which she apologizes. No big deal, I'm not a prude so whatever. We finish up and while waiting for dessert, again she squeezes in but this time she bumps our table hard enough and as she turns she actually knocks my drink down towards me ... right into my lap. Great. Sprite in the pants. Again, not a huge deal. She's clearly flustered and mentions there's a bathroom behind me if I'd like to clean up. I wash up and get what sticky soda off my pants and out of my naughty bits that I can. I come back to see they've done a quick wipe of the table but my feet are still in a puddle of soda on the floor. Sigh... accident waiting to happen again right there but that's going to be their problem.  I think to myself that our cheesecake still hasn't come and if they had an inkling of good customer service, they'd just comp it. Our server drops off a replacement drink to me, without an apology or even a word of acknowledgement and proceeds to talk to the customers next to us. Ok.... Later when our cheesecake arrives, she's squeezed in on the other side (haven't you learned your lesson?) and she actually places it on our table while facing away from us, again not saying anything. Seriously? Why do I feel like the asshole here? I have to get her attention to ask for our bill. When I get it, nothing is discounted. I want to be clear that I'm not giving such a bad review for not being discounted or freebies. I'm not even giving a bad review for her spilling my drink on me. I'm disappointed that after such a stupid mistake you carry on without the courtesy and professionalism that is essential to providing good service."
