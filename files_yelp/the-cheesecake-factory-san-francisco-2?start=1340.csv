Joshua J.,"Reno, United States",9,48,9,1.0,10/1/2011,Horrible experience!  First visit to a Cheesecake Factory and I'll never go again.  Waited 2 hrs for a table.  30 mins for a side of ranch dressing.  Felt like I spent the whole night waiting! The only thing great is the cheesecake.  The food was nothing new.   If I ever go to a Cheesecake Factory  again it'll be to get cheesecake to-go and that's it.  This restaurant is WAY over hyped.
Jessie C.,"San Francisco, United States",240,24,3,3.0,13/2/2011,"What's that saying? Don't judge a book by it's cover? Even if the cover makes your mouth water and jaw drop (the view from the top).  The food it alright, actually, it's not that great. It looks wonderful on the menu though. However, it's overpriced, and *sigh* I guess you have to pay for a nice environment and a waiter who remembers your name. Their dishes are huge, but not necessarily good.  If I were you I might split a plate of pasta with a friend, and order a slice of cheesecake for dessert. But don't get too excited about the food."
Don Y.,"Daly City, United States",111,31,23,2.0,23/5/2011,The food is great service is great 2 Starts why? they do not value their customers after spending 230 dollars in 3 hours with friends from back home my glass was chipped i cut my lip i showed it to the manager and  he did not care he gave me a $25 gift card hahahaha really its that how they value their customers ever again ever ever -10 how could you think that your bartender its not going to check the glass where you serve my drink i was mad i am still furious about this imagine if  i had drink that piece of glass where would i be now?  Unacceptable never again. BY THE WAY ALWAYS CHECK YOUR GLASS YOU NEVER KNOW.
Rebecca H.,"Dublin, United States",345,2142,212,2.0,6/4/2011,"The food is ok, it's mass produced huge quantity stuff, but consistant across all locations. You always know what you will get.  The service is fairly horrendous.  Forgetting things, taking them to the wrong table, taking forever to bring dressing for the salad, it just wasn't a great experience.  It's a good place to bring kids, it's loud and crazy and another screaming kid added to the mix doesn't really change the environment much.  Avoid the bathroom, it was so gross and stinky, it seriously smells like a cat box."
Diana B.,"San Ramon, United States",112,345,431,4.0,6/6/2011,"I went on a double date at this particular Cheesecake Factory. You could totally feel this is a ""DATE"" place. When you are there, it screams ""first date"". I wasn't on a first date- This place is great during the summer, because you can sit outside on the patio day and night, without freezing your bum off. You just get amazing views of the city, without paying to dine at an expensive restaurant. I enjoy Cheesecake Factory's ambiance, but the dim lighting is sometimes too much... I like to see my food and friends! Their Tuexedo Cheesecake is amazing... Best I have ever had!"
Lawrence A.,"Oakland, United States",292,17,17,4.0,26/1/2014,I love the Cheese Cake factory but wait times can be long it is in the heart of Union Square. Love eating outside here and seeing the great view of the city.
Kelly G.,"Santa Clara, United States",318,1356,191,3.0,3/8/2009,"While the food is all the same in all the Cheesecake Factory... it makes for a familiar face in the midst of all the San Francisco's wide array of fooding locations.  The view is nice from outside on the patio, but given SF's weather, you'll probably want to ask for the heating lamps on. Even with them on, the winds probably blow away any heat you might hope to get.  Friends and I like to come here before or after a showing at the Orpheum Theater."
E R.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,2,4,1.0,14/4/2014,Awful food bad service great location but too noisy.if you like to have fun nice experience don't come over here
Daniel L.,"San Francisco, United States",73,107,33,2.0,11/4/2011,"People always rave about this place. All of my friends talk about this place. Whenever i am going to or leaving work ( i work at Downtown), i always hear people talk about the cheesecake factory. This restaurant is super overrated.  I mean i understand, it is one of those Class B-C fancy restaurants but honestly, the food is not that great. I have eaten here about 7 times and not once did i enjoy my experience there. Why? The food was not good and very pricey. Now to the cheesecake, it is called the cheesecake factory after all. They have a lot of selections for cheesecake. I have to admit that they do have a few unique and tasty cheesecakes. However, for close to 7 dollars a slice, most of the selections are not worth it at all! I would recommend just going to a local bakery or Costco to get some cheesecake. They place is way too overrated, does not live up to it's hype at all."
Shoua K.,"San Francisco, United States",17,14,,5.0,13/3/2014,"Wonderful location in union square above macys and the view from the outside patio is nice. The service is nice, portions are big, and pricing is reasonable. The brûlée French toast is amazing and the chocolate cake is delicious. I would definitely go back."
Stephen S.,"San Diego, United States",181,108,16,4.0,9/4/2011,"Cheesecake factory got lucky that my group got smart. We went for dinner on a Monday night and the wait was 30-35 minutes which would have gotten them 3 stars, but we decided to hang out by the bar until a table opened. We were probably there for ten minutes before a table opened up. We asked one of the waiters if we could sit there and order food and he gave us a little attitude but indicated it was acceptable. We jumped on it and were on our way. Our server was really cool and we had fun joking around with her all night. She came right away and was generally there when we needed her. No one else was in the mood for beer but I ordered a tall glass of Stella which wasn't cheap but it wasn't too much and it did the job. The massive menu was no trouble for me (if there are too many options I just read and then pick something I remember lol). Two people in our group got burgers and one got the shrimp and chicken gumbo. Our food camp out in an oddly and annoyingly asynchronous order but it all came in good time (and the bread was actually a damn good complimentary appetizer). My burger was excellent. I asked for medium rare and it looked and tasted just right. The flavors were original, interesting, and delicious. I devoured it in between bites of sweet potato fries which were awesomely crunchy. All I heard about the gumbo was that it was spicy but not too spicy and that sounds pretty damn good to me. In the end I was a little buzzed and quite satiated. Despite the annoying problems, this place is awesome in my book."
Victoria L.,"San Francisco, United States",759,70,1,5.0,20/1/2011,"Love LOVe LOve Cheesecake Factory forever! Even if the wait can be long, even if the server wasn't always there watching us, even if it's crowded, even if somethings are kinda expensive.... I love how beautiful the place is and the cheesecake is always delicious! The salad dressings are the bomb. The bread is good- warm soft crunchy. I ordered from the snack part of the menu that i never seen before which was perfect for the evening after a day of shopping! A little house salad that was not ""small"" but just the perfect amount and a margherita pizzette which was delicious as well. The meal only costed me less than ten dollars and I had leftovers as well!  I didn't get a chance to get the cheesecake tonight but I love the red velvet the most!  This place looks formal but is really a place i can eat at everyvnight. There is a big menu that I can live off of! Bring your date, your friends, and your family!"
Grace C.,"Seattle, United States",145,23,9,2.0,13/4/2011,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Most CF's promise a classy ambiance, the same menu regardless of location and MOUTHWATERING cheesecakes. However, each place doesn't always deliver the same service, which is what my 2 stars are here for. When I first heard about this Union Square Cheesecake Factory on top of Macy's, it sounded like a elegant must-see. Unfortunately, the bazillion people waiting in the lobby were thinking the same thing.  My biggest frustration was the server we had. I am usually forgiving to flustered staff (they deal with a lot) but this one was quite cold. Very cold! Icy glares, icy response, icy service. I noticed, however, she was cherry and responsive to her other tables behind us. I'm not a big fan of basing a food review on this one-time personal experience but it definitely put a sour note to my night. Plus, the cheesecake I ordered was the smallest piece a Cheesecake Factory has ever presented to me.  With so much to explore in beautiful San Francisco, there are many awesome local restaurants and small businesses to support that I'd much rather eat at."
Bennett W.,"San Francisco, United States",643,958,2243,5.0,27/3/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is the best especially since this one is at the top level of Macy's Union Square. I agree with Ernest that the food there maybe a bit pricey. But it's still worth it and I give them 6 stars for the cheesecakes! The staff here are very friendly and customer service is efficient but it can be better. I am craving for a cheesecake as I edit this review! This restaurant is always busy so there will be a wait when you come here. It is popular and tops the list of busy restaurant at the same time. There is patio dining available. I'll come here again if I am at the Union Square Macy's location!
Sumdum-Fooka U.,"Long Beach, United States",0,24,,3.0,3/7/2011,"It's the same fairly decent slop that they serve at all other Cheesecake Factories... A couple of key differences apply to this particular location, though: 1. It's almost always packed and ultra crowded (1hr + waiting times); 2. There are some sections where the views are really cool and (could almost) make the wait worthwhile. 3. If you want to check out euro babe-style tourists who are just oozing with sex appeal then this is an excellent place to go. Wait...Maybe that's a comment that applies to Union Square in general during this time of year."
Christine B.,"Brooklyn, United States",137,191,44,4.0,17/1/2011,"Normally I love the avocado egg rolls but my mistake was ordering this appetizer as my main meal.  It was a little too much after 2 pieces.  My friends' food was awesome though.  I didn't get a good view because we were sitting inside but the place that made this a 4 for me was our waitress (Tiffany hooked it up with the bread and was always super attentive to us).   If you want to eat at this Cheesecake, make sure to check in and get your name down first because the wait is likely to be 1-2 hours (also be sure to request outside seating).  Then just go shopping, do whatever and come back when the time is rizight.  Then you shall be a happy camper (and not feel like a hungry psycho)"
Ernest S.,"San Francisco, United States",202,18,,4.0,31/1/2011,"Cheesecake Factory The restaurant located on top of Macy's Building.  Food: ah... 3 stars.... Its okay... and its a bit pricey.... Cheesecake: I give them a extra star. The cheesecake was good. Dining: I would say... If you gonna bring your girlfriend to this place. Take her outside with this lightly dimmed area... Best place to have a date..  Waiting: Unless you trying to get to know the girl... You might not wanna spend 2 hrs waiting in line for a seat. LMAO..... Waiting is incredibly long..... Sadly... Reservation: Nope... Not that im aware of... Side Note: No, I didn't bring a date to this place. Maybe in the future.. ;) 4 stars for a place to dine on your first date. Who knows? You might get laid coming here ;) - Just Kidding.."
Henry C.,"Torrance, United States",3328,403,8,4.0,20/8/2010,"Cheesecake Factory....The name says it all... I can't imagine anyone in US who lives by one of these chain locations and have never been to one.  So to make this short and sweet, I will assume (even though I shouldn't) that everyone knows the food and it's concept and move toward my straightforward experience. Our party got the following on the trip to San Francisco Marghareta Pizza:  Simple and tasty!  Can't be the good old traditional taste of Mozza cheese, basil, and tomato! The Crunch Burger:  I think that's what's called on the menu.... humongous burger with fries....didn't taste it but looked really filling and tasty though Calamari:  I love the cheesecake factory calamari with the green sauce that they got...Very  yummy indeed! Cajun Jamalaya Pasta:  Full cajun flavor with lots of spices but was a bit on the salty side... slightly disappointing how salty it was compared to the one served by my neck of the woods.  Can't expect the exact taste I guess. Factory Meat Loaf:  Large portions of tasty meatloaf, (something I don't usually get), with Corn and veggies on the side (special request for steam veggies is available!)  Actually terrific meat loaf and would definitely get it again. Finally, got the fresh strawberry cheesecake...General consensus:  TOO SWEET!!!  All the cheesecakes offered here are good but is on the sweet side, so I guess no one in my party really enjoyed sugar ""that much"" so it wasn't anything to brag about.... The location was awesome...On top of the Macy building (8th floor) and was seated outside on the patio overlooking UNION SQUARE.  Loved the view and really enjoyed this meal for this reason....Good thing the wait was ok as we got there little earlier and it was on a weekday, otherwise, I can see it being a pain waiting for a table there.. it finally got way too crowded when we were about to leave, so best go early if possible. Waiter was friendly and overall service was the typical Cheesecake Factory performance.  There was a special waiter who was slightly annoying though... he/she kept wanting my meat loaf!!!  Literally!!! The waiter was this huge seagull... sitting on the ledge... serving me personally......staring at my food....................for about 15 minutes!!!!!!!!!"
Amy T.,"Houston, United States",973,503,162,1.0,27/12/2008,"I should have known to turn around and go back into the elevator and walk out of this place right when I walked in! After a long day of shopping in the city my friends and I were exhausted and hungry so we decided to eat at Cheesecake Factory because it was the shortest distance of walking. The wait was awful and there was no waiting area to sit in.  As we were seated we proceeded to wait to be served water and bread. Our food didn't take too long to come out. I asked for a refill on my water so the waiter took my cup. I waited around for several minutes and saw him walk by me with my cup of water and placed it on someone elses table! The other customer clearly did not need a refill because they had two filled cups of water that had not been consumed. I was able to recognize my cup because of the straw that I was using had my chapstick on it! As he walked by my table I asked him again for my cup of water and he said ""Oh, I'm sorry, I will get it now"" as if he wasn't aware that he just placed my cup of water on someone elses table. The poor guy with my cup of water actually didn't realize it and drank my cup of water. The waiter gave me a cup of water with a new straw and failed to mention the mix up.  This is why I will never come back to this place. Bad experience."
Janelle P.,"San Francisco, United States",101,9,8,5.0,4/3/2014,"Came here with my husband and our 10 month old daughter to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. Waited no more than 20 minutes to get seated (it was around 4pm, so we got there before the dinner rush). The hostess was very accommodating since we had our daughter in a stroller/car seat. We ordered calamari, herb-crusted salmon w/mashed potatoes and asparagus, fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken, banana cream cheesecake and white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. All the food was fantastic!!! And we received excellent service!!!"
