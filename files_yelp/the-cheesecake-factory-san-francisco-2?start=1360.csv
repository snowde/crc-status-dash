Ofa A.,"San Lorenzo, United States",0,1,,1.0,22/2/2016,"We waited 40 mins to be seated, we ordered Hennessey and coke, received the coke and waited an additional 30 mins for the Hennessey. Once receiving the Hennessey the cup was filthy. Everyone around us that was seated after us were served first. In a addition we waited another hour to receive our food. One ordered pasta they forgot the chicken, returned the plate the noodles were hard. Now mind you that plate was for a 4 month pregnant woman. Another ordered Smokehous BBQ chicken well done, cut it in half.... was NOT even close to well done. Gave the burger back and asked to redo my order this time pack it to go by the time I get it everyone else will be done eating. So as asked she redid my order packed it to go. I get home cut the burger open same Damn thing. Smfh. Above it all the waiter rolled her eyes once asked to pack it to go. In the end it was a shitty experience. What's the point of having a beautiful view with shitty customer service? And defeated the whole purpose of having dinner together. in the end we still walked out paying $108 dollars."
Natasha M.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",353,379,76,2.0,4/11/2011,"I am not a fan of chains, the bigger they are the less like them. For what it is, it has a darn good view. Otherwise.... it is same same food, huge menu so good if you have a picky traditional eater. I just do not get why it is SOOO popular, it is not that good.  The salads are always over dressed too the point of... want salad with that dressing? The plates are cold when you serve pasta? WTF!  Great now my pasta is turning cold, thanks. I really loved the corn bread tamale spicy thing. That was yummy and kinda different even."
Alyson P.,"North Beach/Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, United States",0,7,,1.0,11/9/2014,"I hardly EVER do reviews unless the restaurant is horrible or really great. So I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for awhile now only because nothing else is close enough to me. But I never do yelp reviews but I seriously can't stand the service here! From the waiters to the hosts to the managers. Worst customer service I've ever had. You would think they would treat their customers with respect and have the decency to at least say excuse me while they all bump into you when they walk by. I'm not exaggerating every time I've been here nothing but rude service I can't stand it anymore. Last time my friend and I sat outside we were waiting there for 90 minutes (not exaggerating) we spoke to 4 waiters and the manager Chris and still no help. They don't care about the guests here at all. They are impatient and have no respect. They don't even hide how miserable they are with their facial expressions. And also they too their eyes at you and ignore you. Another time I came I spoke to the host I front saying how long I was waiting, he then proceeded to laugh in my face and said ""I'm sure you have"". There seriously need to be drastic changes at this restaurant."
Victoria J.,"San Francisco, United States",93,598,972,2.0,16/8/2013,The promised 3-4 minute line at the bakery from the hostess downstairs lasted a total of 10 minutes. I'm an impatient girl who doesn' t like misinformation.
Analyst C.,"San Mateo, United States",9,248,458,3.0,23/7/2012,It was ok for a Wednesday night dinner- the wait was about 10 minutes. I love the crab cakes and the artichoke crab dip-!  If you're watching your waistline--don't come here!
Elizabeth W.,"Raleigh, United States",34,147,92,4.0,1/7/2009,"San Francisco (Union Square) location only.  Must really like this place, because before we started living healthier, we took a bimonthly pilgrimage.  No reservations here, so for a no-stress experience, just be at the Macy's elevator or the top-floor escalator right at opening at 11am (or 10am on Sundays).  Convenient parking garage across the street.   If outside, get a table by the edge near an outdoor heater. If inside, insist on a booth by the window and they'll give it to you.  If you're with children and you don't insist, you'll likely be placed in an interior round booth with none of the spectacular downtown view.   For kids: Ask for the free kids' plate when waiter first comes - they'll bring them an oval dish with banana and bread slices.  The small plates menu has some great bite-size options for toddlers. Favorites: Iced Tea, Passion Fruit style Buffalo Blasts Fried Macaroni & Cheese Crispy Crab Wontons Crab Bites Chicken Samosas Ahi Tuna Roll Avocado Egg Rolls French Country Salad (note: 'To Go' counter sells Balsamic dressing in glass jars) Luau Salad Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club White Chicken Chili (take 1/2 home) Factory Burrito Grande (good for 2-3 people) Chicken Madeira Eggs over Fries (special order, prob charged under 'Farm Fresh Eggs') *Seasonal: Pumpkin cheese cake, Peppermint & Chocolate cheese cake (goes by a different name that is momentarily escaping me)   Not recommended: Shepherd's Pie Orange Chicken (though some people love this)"
Francisco M.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,5,1,1.0,31/1/2014,Very nice view. But bad service I waited for 10 min before my server even brought me water but the blonde girls next to us received water and bread a min after being seated. By the time I received my drink the same waiter was re filling there's bringing more bread and flirting away. Bad service
Orin W.,"Pinole, United States",92,4,1,1.0,2/1/2014,"This place only has the location going for it. Don't come here if you want a Big Bang experience. We waited 1.5 hours to get seated, which we expected; but after 10 minutes of waiting for a server we were informed they were out of over a dozen cheesecakes. We ordered our to the best of our ability, and waited another 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive only to find out that the cheesecake I ordered was rock solid frozen.  I patiently asked to see the menu again and waited another 10 minutes to get the menu. Finally a slice arrived- it was mediocre cheese cake."
Giving Sincere K.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",88,135,,3.0,30/12/2011,"I had lunch here yesterday with a friend.  Christmas Crazy SF, right!!! But I got there early and asked if I could reserve a table for noon.  They took my reservation.  I met my friend and got there late 12:15-12:20.  But they took care of us!  We sat down with less than 5 minute wait!  WOW!  Impressive.   This place is always crazy busy, so I really appreciated that.  The food is great, but I had the Jambalaya over rice, and the rice was not cooked right.  Not so impressed... But the service was good.  Another plus.  I think for the most part, I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this one in SF seems too busy to really offer the service and quality of food that other Cheesecake Factory's that I've been to.  So 3 stars. *But still a fan...!"
Michael S.,"Washington, DC, United States",4,19,2,4.0,27/12/2011,"I should start out by saying the Cheesecake Factory is definitely an experience that you have to plan for. It is SUPER busy every time I have gone in for dinner, less so during lunch, but note that they don't make reservations. I think this in itself speaks for its reputation. The wait can be anywhere from five minutes to an hour and five minutes for dinner, so I usually come prepared with a water bottle and a couple of granola bars. I recommend getting a seat on the patio as you overlook Union Square park and during the holidays is especially pretty. Being that it is San Francisco and it can get cold outside, they do have heaters to toast you right up. There is a massive variety of food (including cheesecake obviously) with massive portions. A bit on the pricey side, but the experience is worth. The service has been a hit or miss, but quite honestly, I just go there for the fun environment, the good food, and the CHEESECAKE! Some complain that the service it too crummy to go back to, but when you're with a good group of friends, I know I'd rather not have a waiter who constantly checks up every two minutes. Again, if you expect an attentive wait staff who will rub your feet every time they walk by, I'd say skip this. But the food is great, the views are worth noting, and the menu is impressive. I can't describe it any better than saying it's definitely a fun experience that you must try."
Mimi W.,"South San Francisco, United States",2,162,6,5.0,12/12/2012,"Love this place, chicken potstickers, sliders, calamari and bistro shrimp pasta are a must have when dinning here"
Christine M.,"Los Angeles, United States",7,24,6,1.0,14/6/2014,"Maybe we just got a bad server but this was the worst service I have had at any restaurant.  The food was fine that's where the one star comes from.  We watched all the tables around us flip twice while we got the wrong drinks and wrong food our whole time.  It took us way longer than necessary and didn't even order dessert because it was so bad.  I will not be back, ever."
T L.,"El Cajon, United States",7,58,,5.0,9/10/2011,"I had my birthday dinner here today and loved every minute of it! The service was a little slow but they were PACKED so I can't blame them too much. The view was amazing and luckily we got a seat right by the window outside.  The wait was around a little over an hour and they said it would be longer so we were pleasantly surprised by that. The food was delicious and the cheesecake was absolutely amazing! Love the avocado egg rolls and would highly recommend the four cheeses pasta! The hot chocolate is super rich and didn't finish it but not bad...  Overall, a great expereince."
Kit P.,"San Francisco, United States",197,42,26,3.0,14/12/2012,Always full of hungry patrons waiting for their turn to be seated.  We came here several times for dinner with the fiance' and had to wait at least 30-45 minutes.
christine c.,"San Francisco, United States",46,377,1,3.0,8/7/2011,"This place is constantly out of control crazy. Even at 4 p.m. on a weekday it's PACKED. Usually I order take out from here, even if it's just a piece of cake or something, but just be prepared and warned, you'll always wait at least 10 or 15 minutes. Service is spotty, but it's the Cheesecake Factory and it's nuts. The food is the same everywhere since it's frozen, but it's delicious so whatever. I like the take-out almost better. Don't have to deal with the crazy tourists and the servers can't mess anything up or piss you off. Though, there is a cool patio and awesome view to enjoy both day and night. But do remember, just because you're in California doesn't mean it's warm. People on the patio, be prepared to wear a coat!"
Ryan H.,"Kannapolis, United States",12,92,24,5.0,3/10/2013,"Beautiful location atop Macy's in Union Square. Ask for a seat outside and you get a gorgeous view of the city. Apart from that, it is the delicious Cheesecake Factory we all love."
Kelly H.,"San Francisco, United States",82,33,15,2.0,17/12/2011,Expensive regular food like chicken salad sandwiches. The service isn't that great.. the workers kinda ignored us because we were just a bunch of kids. And the food wasn't that great. Most likely not going back again.
Cel Y.,"Berkeley, United States",215,89,278,3.0,9/7/2014,Oh wow the chicken Katsu was super salty!!Other then that everything else was good. The veggies with the brown rice and spicy miso sauce was amazing.
Marcio C.,"San Francisco, United States",481,9,13,5.0,5/5/2013,"So I came into the Cheesecake Factory today, not my first choice considering I'm not a huge fan of chains but WOW my mind has literally been blown. The service here is top notch. I felt like an A-list celebrity at a swanky new happening joint. The person to commend for this stellar trip was none other than my amazing server, Elias. The man is a master of his craft. I can't praise him enough. The food was great, the drinks were  exquisite, and the atmosphere was superb. Like I said, though the whole experience wouldn't have been same if it weren't for Elias. The man took me on a culinary joy ride, dropped me off at a reasonable time, and didn't even ask to come upstairs (I'm speaking hypothetically of course). What a class act. I'll definitely be coming back and asking for that dream of a man."
Lena S.,"San Francisco, United States",17,39,19,4.0,4/1/2011,Going here is always fun... usually I'm with my boyfriend and friends..  Went here recently for New Years Eve... oh man talk about PACKED and a 2 hr wait.. but it was still good.. from the view to the people working there..  When I go here I always have to have pasta... something about it is just soo delicious plus they grate fresh parmesan cheese over the pasta... even though I usually have them grate about half the cheese but hey what can I say... I love cheese on pasta... YUMMY...
