Tisha H.,"San Pablo, United States",3,50,32,5.0,11/12/2011,"This place is amazing!! the view from the roof top.. Breath taking! My fiance and I decided to go to the cheese cake factory at the last minute last night.. They close at 12:30.. we arrived at 12:10am.. they still seated us and fed us hot fresh delicious food.. It's my birthday weekend and i must say the service was even better than the food.. Our waiter was super funny, chill, and laid back! we had such a great experience that we left the waiter a $15 tip!! IDK if it was the service or the extremely strong Spiked milkshake that he gave me.. Thank You Cheese cake factory for another wonderful time! :)"
Geordie E.,"San Francisco, United States",25,419,89,3.0,25/6/2013,Always add 20 minutes to the promised wait time.
Ray C.,"Daly City, United States",93,158,54,3.0,10/8/2011,"Your experience at the CF will be pretty identical to any other location, save for a few things: - The view off the window seats or the balcony - Ridonkulous wait times - Macy's furniture floor right below the CF level (good for lounging -coughcough-)  Portions are quite large, and bread is good when hot. Butter is the unit-of-use packs. The rye bread is pretty popular and the fluffiest I've had at any restaurant. Touch of oats sprinkled on the crust of the loaves are nice. White bread is also fluffy, but the brown coloring of the rye makes it seem so much tastier for some reason. Reminds me of a chocolate muffin.. Large groups beware, you may wait a long time. Here once with a group of 12...waited 2.5hrs. More moderate groups (5-7) may take an hr. If you are visiting, the experience may be worth it for you. If you are local, eat local."
Clare C.,"San Francisco, United States",13,72,,2.0,11/2/2011,"Service has a lot to be desired. Of the last four times I've frequented the Cheese Cake Factory in the last couple of months, I've either had and overly aggressive, in your face tip chasers or server who forgets you're there!  Also, it's really not necessary for a server to come check on a meal four times...literally!!  I experienced that during the week when I was having an important business meeting.   On a positive note, the food is typically pretty good. The turkey burger is great, pasta da vinci is typically very good, the ahi tuna appetizers are great. The Godiva cheesecake is to die for!"
Susan C.,"Oakland, United States",0,1,1,4.0,7/5/2012,The food is really great! I recommend the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip and the Tex Mix Eggrolls as appetizers. Amazingly good! I usually order pasta from here. I LOVE the Chicken Ramona in White Sauce. So DELICIOUSSSS.  The only Con about this place is the long wait. The food is worth it though.
Ryan F.,"Vallejo, United States",199,18,7,3.0,16/9/2013,"Nice overview of union square if you are seated outside.  I gave this place 3 stars because although the view is great, the floors are really slimy (maybe from dropped beverages or food), my chicken was slightly burnt, and the food was just OK for its price.  However, the cheesecake was BOMB! I got the cookies and cream cheese cake and it was really good lol. Also, the waiter was prompt to my requests, friendly, and even boxed my unfinished food in a nice bag.  Overall an OK place to go if you wanted to eat out in Union Square San Francisco."
claudia y.,"San Francisco, United States",749,997,2370,3.0,9/8/2012,"we have been here before but felt like a big meal on a wednesday night so we went to cheesecake.   the elevators are slow.  take the escalator the wait is long.  if theres only two of you and the timing is right, wait for a seat in front of the bar. the portions are huge!  and the food is kind of salty  and fatty.  haha"
Hailen T.,"Colma, United States",45,6,,3.0,12/1/2012,"The food's good is worth the money you pay, but my biggest complaint would be the wait. In other words, this is NOT the place to go if you and your friends just decided on the spot where to go and eat. To sum it up, this is what local high school students would think as being ""semi-fancy"" (since I used to be one of them). In terms of quality of food, it's not bad, but nothing to get exited about either.  As for being a Cheesecake Factory, fans of the food item can rejoice since they offer a WIDE variety of cheesecakes. However, they do tend to overload it with whipped cream. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but like the rest of the food they serve, it's worth your money....but is it worth the wait is another matter entirely. Around 5pm or before is probably the ideal time since they don't take reservations. Any later, they tend to get packed even on random days of the week. For the lucky, 30 minutes or less. For the unlucky, 1 hour or more (not kidding and on special occasions, 2 hours)"
Jennie W.,"San Francisco, United States",128,112,4,3.0,18/10/2013,The Cheesecake Factory food is not bad but I wouldn't say its fantastic either.  The positive side is that they give big portions and the desserts are good.  The menu is so large its hard to decide what to order sometimes.
John F.,"Celebration, United States",71,394,290,4.0,5/6/2011,"The reviews had us wondering if the experience was going to be as pleasant as the Cheesecake Factory we came to love in Buckhead, Atlanta, GA.  Though not as good as that one this place is well worth your visit and for sure ask for patio seating on a nice day so you can enjoy the wonderful view of Union Square.  We only had to wait for 20 minutes for our table and the service was fairly quick.  They worked hard to correct an error with our meal so no loss of stars there as errors happen and they went beyond in making sure we were taken care of.  We'll visit here again hoping for a repeat of this visit as we really did enjoy the view, food, which they provide rather large portions, and the service.  Good job Cheesecake Factory and wonderful location.   One tip I would have for others is use the escalators to bypass the line waiting for the one small elevator.  Sure you have to take a number of them to get up but the views along the way are nice and you can still beat those waiting on the cramped elevator car going up."
Tina Z.,"San Francisco, United States",8,1,,3.0,23/11/2013,"Finally made it tonight! The steak is tasty,but the cheesecake is way more sweet for me, I'm going to be chubby T_T"
Denton S.,"St George, United States",9,36,,3.0,5/1/2012,"Was not the best one we've been to, but it was better than most restaurants still. They were lean on cheesecakes when we went, but the food was still pretty good. They have outdoor seating but not for large groups. We had good staff, and they took great care of us. The wait was not bad, and they took our strollers for us and put them in a secure area so that we would not have to worry about them. Would have been better if we could have connected to wifi while waiting"
Mallory M.,"Miami, United States",255,186,195,4.0,12/10/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a nice little treat. It's definitely one of the most touristy restaurants in SF, but it's worth the wait.   The trick at the CCF is to make sure you eat slowly or save some of your meal for later so you can actually get to the massive dessert list. Not only do they have like 30 kinds of cheesecake, they also have some other pretty spectacular choices.  Be prepared to wait at least an hour or more, but try and hit it on a sunny afternoon and sit outside!"
Nick B.,"San Leandro, United States",111,190,99,4.0,25/7/2013,"So Macy's Women's in Union square doubles as a food court, a bakery, a Starbucks, a Burger joint and finally Cheesecake Factory. It's got a beautiful view of the city from the patio and price and food quality is consistent with all other Cheesecake Factories. Wait time wasn't that much longer than any other of their locations which was surprising considering all the foreigners wearing backpacks and speaking French, Japanese and a host of other languages. Bravo!"
Marvin J.,"Brentwood, United States",65,110,83,4.0,10/8/2008,"Hey, I happen to LIKE the Cheesecake factory.   Yeah, it's a little overpriced, but some of the quality, and quantity, of the food is pretty darn amazing. This also happens to be a great spot to stop and rest the dogs after a full day of shopping (which a friend and I did - see pics). We ordered a side of fries and the Fire Roasted Artichoke.....hella good! I also had.....haha...of course!  Alcohol!  Trust me - don't walk into the Factory with expectations....the view, food, price.....and you'll have a great time."
Veronica N.,"San Francisco, United States",420,165,2,3.0,22/10/2012,"I really do love coming here for dinner and the atmosphere is amazing. Very comfortable, clean, friendly. Great for family and friends. The food is good and the service is great.  I did have one visit when the waiter attending us was extremely rude and seemed like he hated his job, but all the other waiters/waitresses from my other visits were phenomenal. They give amazing recommendations and are very familiar with the dishes. They also check up on you often to see if you need anything.  I've had the four-cheese pasta, mac and cheese burger, and several appetizers such as buffalo wings and of course a cheesecake for dessert.  If you're coming here just for the cheesecake, I wouldn't recommend it.The cheesecake is definitely good here, but there's better. On the plus side, they have a large variety of cheesecakes, so you are bound to find something you like.  The food is definitely well cooked, always served hot and well plated. The outside seating on the balcony is amazing at night and they do have heating vents to keep you warm.  I would say this place is more casual, not something you would have to dress up for.  I love the white-chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the white-chocolate chip one. One slice can definitely be split among two people. From all my past experiences I've never finished a whole slice with another person. We were all left full from the large portions of our main dishes + appetizers.  Skip the salads, they are very average and unless you find it a necessity I would pass this one up. There's nothing special about the salads and they fill you up before you even get to your food.  The food here isn't too amazing, given what you pay for it. I will likely come back again in the future."
Jeannie L.,"San Francisco, United States",75,396,113,3.0,20/7/2011,"I come here ever so often after Sunday movies with the bf -- if we find good parking.  The wait is always ridiculously long, of course. I always head to the bar to snag a table without the wait and normally have no issue.  We have a tendency to get the same dishes:  -Ahi tuna tempura roll *Love this. It's just really yummy and the dipping sauce that comes with goes with it perfectly. -Buffalo wings *You can't go wrong -Louisiana chicken pasta *I really enjoy this dish even though its a bizillion calories. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and never burnt. This time the sauce was a little more salty than usual but all in all still delicious.  Got some drinks too... the sangria is more ice and fruit than actual drink.  The service is always pretty good with the once in awhile case of getting someone who's just overwhelmed."
Erin H.,"Carlsbad, United States",167,390,64,4.0,12/5/2011,"I know...it's Cheesecake Factory. I'm pretty much only writing this to tell you about the new item - The Weight Management Grilled Chicken is amazing. And it's only 590 calories, yet I couldn't even eat half of it which means you can eat all those calories and more back with desert!  This place is usually very busy given it's location. The bartender that was there last night was obviously having a bad night - he was um - not very friendly. At all. Once we were seated service was decent and were seated at a booth right next to the patio so we had all of the view but none of the windy chill we saw everyone outside suffering with.  It's just nice to know there's a Cheesecake around when you're too overwhelmed or nervous to try the local fare."
L. L.,"San Francisco, United States",2,14,,1.0,29/9/2010,"I received a call back from one of the managers at Cheeseake Factory within 24 hours.  She listened to what I had to say, and said she would look into the situation.  Kudos to corporate for enforcing the restaurant to follow up."
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, United States",0,1740,1,3.0,1/11/2011,"Not sure if it's a big as other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, but it's just as nice and has the same enormous menu.  This location has the added advantage of having outdoor seating overlooking Union Square.  On those few really nice days and nights in SF, it is really spectacular.  On the other hand, it'll probably be too darn cold to sit up there anytime you go there! Elevator can take you directly upstairs to the restaurant from the Macy's lobby at Union Square.   Our service was fine and my omelette was pretty good.  The accompanying english muffin looked bakery made instead of from a machine.  We had no wait for an inside table just before noon on a Sunday."
