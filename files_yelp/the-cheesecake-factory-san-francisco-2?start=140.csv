Natalie V.,"Boston, MA",23,2,,1.0,8/17/2017,"I usually don't write reviews, but my visit to cheesecake was so horrible it deserved one. I would put ZERO STARS if I could. A couple of friends and I went for dinner and were sat on the terrace. We were sat in the very back on a sticky and unclean table, which was a little black table not one of the granite tables, next to the where they take all the dirty dishes. They knew it was disgusting too because after repeatedly wiping the table down we were asked if we'd like extra napkins to place on the table.  Our server, Sierra H., came quickly to get our order. Approx 5 minutes later we asked politely if it was possible to switch to a different table and our server curtly told us that because she already put in our order we couldn't move. No wonder she tried to get us to order as fast as possible. When our server brought our napkins with our forks and knives, both my fork and knife had left over food on them. For drinks, we just got water and two of the cups were yellow and dirty.  To top our terrible visit off, once we paid and were getting ready to leave our server loudly said ""wow I f***ing hate teenagers"". At first I wasn't sure if I heard her correctly, but my friend then said she also heard her say that about us. This was the WORST customer service I've ever had at restaurant. Don't come here."
Sierra B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/17/2017,"If you know me you know I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory & part of the experience is waiting which I'm always mentally prepared for considering it's my favorite! But this location was just so so poorly thought out. Anyone knows that the Cheesecake Factory is always busy so WHY would the SAN FRANCISCO LOCATION be the smallest one I've ever been to?! San Francisco is huge with so many people in and out daily, ALL year round. The Cheesecake Factory for a city like this, knowing how busy they are, should literally be several floors. I say this with more than my own experience in mind. The design of their location is seriously hurting their business. Not to mention it's also the top the floor of a Macy's, which is bound to be small anyways. Just poor planning on their part. I would probably go again simply because I love the good but with mental preparation because it's just a complete shit show."
Jamie C.,"New York, NY",204,44,63,3.0,11/2/2016,It's okay... the portions are really large here.  I came here to hang it with my mom after shopping around downtown. The service is mediocre. Takes a little while to catch their attention.  They start off giving you some free bread at the table. I like the rye bread.  We ordered the Thai Glazed Salmon over coconut rice (the dinner portion) $19.95. They had a lunch portion for $14.95 but my mom and I aren't heavy eaters so we shared. We still could not finish the whole portion! The meal was pretty good though.  I'd only stop by here if I'm in the area I would stop by. Otherwise there are plenty other spots to try out.
Alfred R.,"Daly City, CA",9,3,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"This place is ludicrously overrated.  Today I came here with a party of 11 and we were waiting here for 2 hours.  Customer service was abysmal, the host and hostesses kept telling us over and over that it would be another half hour every half hour.  The wait seemed endless and even when we were seated things didn't look up.  We waited a good 20 minutes before a server came over and asked to take our orders.  I know that this is a hotspot for tourists and the like, but that's no excuse for the disappointing service my family and I experienced today.  I don't even need to talk about the food to know that I'm never coming back here."
Ana C.,"Daly City, CA",13,21,25,5.0,8/3/2017,Like a 30 minute wait to seat outside. It was sort of windy but it was worth it. It's pretty expensive here but the food is really good. Our server was really nice too.
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,2.0,9/16/2017,"After not being able to find parking at the breakfast joint we wanted to try, we walked from the parking garage near Union Square and remembered that Cheesecake Factory does brunch on the weekends, so we figured what the heck.  Per the waitresses suggestion, I tried the chilaquiles with pork.  Not sure why I did this.... chilaquiles at CF?  Yeah, I know, I should have known better.  They were terrible.  More of a breakfast nachos than a chilaquile.  And there were about two tablespoons of pork fat on top, no pulled pork to be found.  It was so bad that I complained and sent it back.  They took it off of the bill.  My wife had the breakfast sandwich which she said was just alright, the brioche bread was a little dry. I will say that I did see some other good looking food options going out, lots of good looking french toast, pancakes and eggs benedict.  And, for SF their pricing is very reasonable compared to other places.  Just wish we would have tried other options.  Chilaquiles at CF, HA!  My fault I guess."
Scott M.,"Springfield, MO",2,55,41,4.0,7/26/2017,"Incredible view of the city. Top floor of the Macy building with outdoor seating. The food is great, as expected. Problem is the food is so good and the portions so large, it has to be my only meal of the day because if I ate before, there is no room for desert. When you're on vacation, it's tough to take my leftovers.  Food was great and the seating was quick, however, our first server had to go on break and the guy who covered for him was either new or had too many tables. Didn't see him much. 5-star food, 3-star service this time."
Marie D.,"Daly City, CA",28,20,5,3.0,8/7/2017,"Went today with my husband, we sat at the bar cause there was a open table. It took a minute before we got are menus and to get are order.  We both order the chicken piccata and spinach dip. They brought out my order and said the other one Is on its way. Well we waiting for like 20/25 minutes and guess what! It never came.. we ask The waiter and he went to see . I end up Sharing my food with my husband. And end up canceling his order. But the food was delicious and to top it all off we had two awesome cheesecakes. So it end up ok I guess"
Erica D.,"Martinez, CA",340,201,63,5.0,11/21/2016,"I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! IDC if it is a chain, i have some of he best service and food consistently, at all locations. This SF location is touristy but still delivers every time. Expect supr long wait times since it is on the top of macys and overlooks union square. This is a must during the holidays after a long dya of shopping.  Our server greeted us with waters. The quoted time was exact. The bread is always warm and fresh. It is necessary that everyone order the fried mac n cheese balls. If i were to die and have a final meal- this would be it. They are SO magical and yummy. Crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside! I had 4 cheese pasta which is also so yummy. penne drenched in a vodka sauce and copius amounts of cheese. So good. My bf had the Parmesan crusted chicken- this is a huge portion and could easily be shared. LOVE ITTTTT! My favorite chain restaurant, ever."
Jess M.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,94,15,4.0,9/19/2016,"Waited for 30 min for our table around 5:30 pm. The place was super busy, so we didn't mind the wait. Easily got some seats at the bar to ride us over. The outside terrace was great, and gave us a perfect view of the USC marching band rally! Service was a little slow, but nothing too unbearable. I got the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was delicious, and my friends loved the Steak Diane! I loved that we could request a ""window"" table on the terrace overlooking Union Square!"
Jazveline D.,"Fresno, CA",14,58,133,5.0,4/3/2017,"This has always been my favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurant to eat at. Great location and the outdoor seating is the best. Not only do I go to Macy's a lot for my shopping, but I get to go all the way up the escalator (7 floors up yay!!!) yes, I get excited about that just like my children do. Ok, back to my review. I love sitting outside for brunch when the weather is nice. Have always received great service here and enjoyed their food. This was the first time I actually took pictures of our orders, but I think I will be returning very soon!"
Ross S.,"San Francisco, CA",464,363,446,5.0,11/14/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, where you are allowed to be an American and stuff yourself until you can't walk. Our waitress was really nice, and very helpful. A+ for service. However, since this location is in union square, it is a tourist trap. So if you are looking to escape the tourist waves, this is not the place for you. Just depends what you are in the mood for. But I definitely recommend."
Keith H.,"Oakland, CA",263,375,568,3.0,2/29/2016,"A friend of mine was visiting town and staying right in the thick of things near Powell St.  I was somewhat stumped on places we could try that were not in the mall or potentially a chain restaurant, but after a visit to Kin Khao was unsuccessful (guess I should make sure it's open next the time I try to visit), we ended up at The Cheescake Factory.  Located on top of Macy's, this location definitely seemed like a popular option on a Saturday afternoon. The highlight definitely was the definitely the patio seating, which gives you a nice view of downtown San Francisco.  Given the nice weather, we decided to wait for the outdoor seating, and it only took about 15 minutes before we got a table.  I was a bit sketched out given the amount of pigeon activity out there, but we actually were able to eat our meal unmolested by our much maligned bird friends.   Our server was friendly and definitely circulated the tables with skill.  I ordered a Chinese chicken salad, which was what I expected: good if not memorable.  I also tried a virgin pina colada, which was full of the empty calories I was seeking.  As always, The Cheescake Factory has a staggering list of its namesake, but with the salad and the fried zucchini appetizer, both my friend and I were quite satiated.   If you end up visiting after getting some downtown shopping done, definitely get the patio seating (once the weather's permitting)!"
Jeff W.,"Berkeley, CA",51,8,,3.0,6/23/2017,"After attending college I have a newfound appreciation for the large portions here. The fact that an entrée can be 3 meals for the average sized girl is enough reason to come here.  Despite the giant portions, the food quality is decent but not spectacular. However, you can always count on Cheesecake Factory for good cheesecake! I recommend the banana ones."
Tom B.,"Los Angeles, CA",432,41,2,4.0,10/1/2017,"Probably the most well-lit Cheesecake Factory I've been to. This location is on the top level of the Macy's. If you come, be prepared to wait a while. There's the ability for rooftop seating which is nice, but we opted to sit inside because some lady was feeding the birds so they were rowdy. We had a great experience with our severs. Good experience overall."
Gerald-Mina K.,"Marin, CA",48,13,,1.0,9/30/2017,"Knew there was going to be a wait, as this location is always busy, but don't tell us 55 minutes for a party of 5, and stupid us waited 2 hours. Don't mind waiting, but tell us the real wait time, so we can decide for ourselves if we want to waste our time waiting. Then they try to sit us outside when we specifically asked for inside, causing us to wait another 15 minutes. The system here needs to be improved. Most disorganized Cheesecake Factory ever. Too bad we were craving their food. On top of all that, the AC was broken, so it was stifling in the restaurant. Hope someone from corporate reads these reviews, will also be reaching out to them directly."
Tim B.,"Butlers Marston, United Kingdom",0,33,39,4.0,10/12/2017,Apart from the front desk not being overly welcoming and it was hectic. Once shown to our seat the service could not have been better by Laurin! The food portions were huge and delicious but did not leave much room for cheesecake... so we got take out the day after! The restaurant is a great location overlooking Union square.
Rebeca J.,"Carmel, United Kingdom",0,5,,4.0,10/17/2017,"We enjoyed our visit to cheesecake factory, menu is very long and it's frustrating that prices aren't on the menu for cocktails. Cheesecake is excellent though. Would visit again."
Tammy C.,"Kaneohe, HI",23,19,20,3.0,9/4/2017,Love the cheesecake factory! Try the salted caramel with ice cream! It's to die for. Kind of  warm in San Fran but so well worth it! Missing home though!
Alayna S.,"San Jose, CA",203,94,93,5.0,10/27/2016,"- It looks like every night for this location is poppin. We came on a Wednesday night & it looked recently packed. Our server named Sierra was very friendly. Answered all our questions honestly about the food & both dishes we received were so good! I do have to say, this location is by far the best location w their food. It was fresh, hot & over all, well made. Their drinks don't play, the price & how strong they are. Woo!  - You must sit outside!! It was gorgeous on the balcony at night, heating lamps on, the dimmed lights. Really pretty!"
