G ..,"Austin, United States",222,54,,3.0,5/12/2014,"Do you strive to push your gastronomical limits? I know I do. This is why I choose to dine at Cheesecake Factory. Your overpriced meal may seem excessive, but really they're giving you a portion that could feed a family of four, so you're definitely getting your value. Keep in mind that creating a four person portion is not the same as creating just one, so it will take four times the amount of time to have your food carried to your table by a server dressed in a uniform similar to that of a mental hospital nurse. One of my goals is to someday be able to say ""I TOO have diabetes"" which is why I love to visit Cheesecake Factory every chance I get."
Lorissa W.,"Hercules, United States",95,520,118,4.0,19/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has become my weekday lunch venue.  I know that sounds pathetic but it's one of the few places in SF where you can sit down in a clean and nice looking dining room that overlooks the city and where you can order almost anything.  Albeit the prices are high but it's SF so The Cheesecake Factory is actually cheap for the ambiance and vast menu choices. Today, my mother ordered Evelyn's Favorite (13.95) but 10.95 if you order the lunch version.  It's smaller but it's still a good amount of food.  My mother is a big eater but she was basically pleased.  I wasn't hungry today so I just ordered their basic eggs dish which is surprisingly cheap (6.95).  Be forewarned that they only serve poached eggs on Sundays because that is when they have the egg poaching machine on.  I was hoping for roasted tomatoes to go with my egg dish but if you choose tomatoes instead of potatoes, you get three large slices of raw tomato.  My two sunny side up eggs were perfectly cooked and my English muffin was a little charred on one side but still pretty good.  I liked that they offer strawberry jam which happens to be my favorite type of jam.  All in all, we enjoyed our food.  On weekdays, the wait is only about 15 minutes to be seated and our waitress was really attentive."
Joy-Lu B.,"Daly City, United States",52,85,10,2.0,3/1/2013,"I will say this again but probably for another establishment, they should just stick to making their namesake... and just make cheesecakes.  Their food is tough and bland, that is all."
Carol M.,"Rio Vista, United States",0,3,,2.0,19/2/2015,The slow service was frustrating. Our drinks came a good 20 min. after our meal was served. Food was good but rediculously slow service made our time there frustrating. We were about to cancel dessert when it finally arrived.
Lily C.,"Sunnyvale, United States",27,36,5,3.0,20/10/2011,"Food wise, I've always been a fan. But the waiter we had that night was SOOOOO slow. It took him 20 minutes to bring the drinks and bread. Another 20 minutes for the food. And I waited forever for my cheesecake. And when the dessert came, it was halfway collapsed. In the end, he never came to collect the bill so we had to ask someone else to ring things up for us. I wrote on the receipt ""I'm sorry dude. You were TOO slow!"""
Mandy D.,"San Francisco, United States",89,355,209,4.0,8/4/2009,"Wait can be long, that's expected. For a shorter wait, go during lunch on the weekdays. If you're waiting for a while, take a look at the menu at the bottom of the escalator or grab a menu. That way, when you're seated after a long wait, you'll know exactly what to get. Depending on your server, it can be slow, but I never had a horrible experience.  The food: Whenever I'm craving for pasta, this is the place I would go. I almost always get the farfalle chicken with roasted garlic. By the time I'm finished with my meal, I barely have room for cheesecake because it's so heavy. The cheesecakes are worth a try.  One of my favorite mashed potatoes have to be from here. I liked it so much that I asked the server what was in it. He said there's no butter and from what he knows, there's chicken broth and heavy cream. So for you vegans/vegetarians out there, the mashed potatoes has chicken broth!"
Yael N.,"Beaverton, United States",106,81,1,3.0,20/6/2011,"I've eaten here several times, but I do not make a habit of it. My most recent experience was 2 nights ago, after about a 4 year absence. It was packed of course, but we (my party of 6) got seated about 40 minutes earlier than we thought because another large party was not present. Service was good, so was the food- I had the seared tuna tataki salad and fresh strawberries for dessert. I don't care for the cheesecake here, personally. Overall, a good experience. I still think The Cheesecake Factory as a whole is overpriced and overrated."
Tommy C.,"San Francisco, United States",140,215,6,3.0,25/2/2013,"I really like the CheeseCake Factory because you get a solid meal, a heaping portion, and a delicious selection of cheesecake. I came last year with my boyfriend and we very much enjoyed our meal. One negative about the restaurant is that waiting for a table can be a nightmare. I would normally suggest putting your name in and waiting at the bar, but the bar is microscopic and it's basically impossible to get a drink. For a restaurant of that size (and the projected caliber) the bar should be larger than just 8 chairs. Besides this, I remember our meal being very good and the cheesecake was perfect (as it always is). I'll come back to the factory if I have a gift card or it's an odd weekday night but never during tourist season or on the weekend. Great to just buy cheesecake, too."
Jack T.,"Arlington, United States",0,14,,3.0,8/10/2013,"Thankfully, this restaurant is on the top level of a mall -- they don't take reservations, so it pays to go to the front desk first thing when you enter the mall to ask for a table. Their bullet vibrators (god, I hope that's the right term for it) aren't made for long-distance signals, so you're pretty much confined to walking around Macy's. If you're not into shopping for discount clothing or overpriced home goods and Cheesecake is making you wait more than 30 minutes, it's probably not worth it -- the food is as you would expect at any Cheesecake: high quantity, low quality. The thing that drew me and my girlfriend to try this particular Cheesecake was the outdoor rooftop seating. The view is cool (overlooks Union Square), but even though they have heat lamps, it's much colder up there than you would think. Definitely bring a jacket if you're planning on sitting outside!"
Gisele M.,"Santa Cruz, United States",31,98,24,4.0,13/6/2011,"Another restaurant chain that I liked and that I will certainly visit again. It was my first time and I liked both food and service. For a crowed place, I though the experience would be worst. Of course you need to be prepared to wait around 25 to 40 minutes to get a table since you are right in the middle of Union Square, but overall, I liked it.  I had the Bistro Shrimp Past and loved it! I got all the flavors and textures I was waiting for... and I believe I can say that I know a lot about shrimp pastas. ;)"
MyOpinion K.,"South San Francisco, United States",0,6,1,2.0,11/2/2015,"I went here for my birthday. Food is good but the portions are average. My experience wasnt pleasent because you could tell my waiter was so over whelmed dealing with all the tables he had. I felt bad for him! Going to eat here was a once in a lifetime, ""hey i tried it"" type of thing for me. The lines are soo long. I made a reservation at 3:30pm the day we went and still had to wait an hour and half to be seated. Party of 11. What was the point in the reservation! Try it once if you havent been here but dont expect to much. What I did love was that the whole restaurant sang happy birthday when they brought out the little scoop of vanilla ice cream."
Katherine H.,"Gilroy, United States",0,9,,4.0,10/1/2014,"Great view, my go-to place for SF. They don't take reservations, so we always go and save time because there's always a wait. Food is always delicious. If its nice enough to sit outside, that's always a treat!"
Margarita V.,"Richmond, United States",340,180,490,3.0,23/7/2008,The starter bread was good.  My club sandwich was great.  My friend raaaved about his mashed potatoes. My sista's luau salad was an interesting delight.  Overall we had a nice meal for a Monday afternoon.  The waiter was totally BLAH tho. He forgot my other friend's side order of mashed potatoes [he couldn't resist getting his own]... too bad he NEVER got them! ...sigh. We only waited about 4 minutes for a booth. That's probably going to be a big reason i would wanna go back. Maybe next time we'll get a nice waiter instead of boring bob over there.
Melinda H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,9,,2.0,13/3/2012,"The service was very slow. I mean very slow. We waited about an hour and a half.. ok.. that's not too bad (at least for this place.. considering we are in a heart of one of the most busiest city..) got seated.. waited.. the server came to ask drinks.. waited waited..... got our drinks...waited waited waited the server came to take our order.. waited waited...... it would run out the space writing about how much we waited.. for everything!! so make the long story short, the food was good as always. but the service was very very slow, I must say."
Gregory N.,"Morgan Hill, United States",182,269,,4.0,21/7/2013,"It's a chain, so you know what you're going to get:  good but overpriced, spicey food.  Cheesecake is to die for.  But this one off Union Square is unique due to the 8th story view over Union Square."
Sara K.,"Newark, United States",185,384,87,1.0,14/8/2008,"Seriously, people need to shut up about the damned Cheesecake Factory. It's NOT THAT GOOD. The food is SO overpriced it's not even funny... And you know what else isn't funny? The wait. There is always. a. wait. No matter when you go. Middle of the day or middle of the night. There will be a wait. Not just with getting a table. There's also a wait for your server. The entire experience is just about waiting. Waiting waiting waiting. The only people not doing any waiting are the waiters (haha!). Yes, their cheesecakes are good, but not mouthgasmic. If their cheesecake sucked then people would be REALLY dumb to go there! The only thing I ever really loved there was the Raspberry Mojito, and they don't have those anymore. So now I really have no reason to step within ten feet of this wretched place."
Grace M.,"Las Vegas, United States",10,12,3,4.0,2/1/2011,"Oh Cheesecake Factory...how I adore thee. I come here quite religiously with one of my best friends and end up having a great experience every time. Every one of our waiters were exceptionally nice ESPECIALLY when we went there for new years eve, our server Michael was the sweetest darling ever. He was just so kind and really sincerely felt like he cared about our well being not like other servers who just suck up. Therefore we gave him a 30% tip and our phone numbers. Yup. That's how good he was. Couple negatives are: the location. Yeah it's on top of Macy's and you get to see the view of Union Square from outside but when you think about it, the elevator wait & the escalator inconveniently placed in the middle of all the madness is just stupid. I give this place 4 stars cause of that and the ridiculous long waits. THOUGH the furniture section of Macy's is conveniently a hop skip and a jump down the escalator so unfortunately for the furniture sales associate, that's a great place to sit back and relax on $2000 sofas during your 2 hour wait ;D Anywho, I've tried a variety of plates here but I've officially fallen head of heels for the Chicken Bellagio on the 'special menu' card... Two large pieces of chicken on a bed of basil pasta topped with arugula, prosciutto, with cream sauce..  OOoooo just typing that makes my mouth water...I LOVE IT. And the price is perfect. If you've been to Cheesecake before, you'll know how generous the proportions are and for $12.95, I think that's a great deal since I always end up taking half of it togo so I can savor it at home :D I also love their pastas but for $15.95 a plate, that's just wayyyyyyy to expensive. I recommend eating the pasta ONLY during lunch when it's considerably cheaper. Same for their crab cakes...three tiny palm sized cakes for $11.95??? Uh, no. (but they were sooooooo goddang good!)  Now cheesecake. I always never end up getting any cause I'm always so stuffed from eating the complimentary bread and then the meal but once in a while I give in. I absolutely love the Kahlua Chocolate Coffee Cheesecake, The Tuxedo, and the Classic Cheesecake with Fresh Strawberries. YUMMM~! ALSO. Their frozen Peach Bellini and for the non alcohol Strawberry Lemondae. GET IT. DRINK IT. ENJOY IT. I did. Freakin' fabulous."
Arnold T.,"San Francisco, United States",314,240,831,3.0,16/1/2011,"""Hi, how are you?  Can I have a table for 5?""  - a very calm and happy me ""What's your name?"" - says the hostess that looks like she's 13 ""Arnold"" - a still calm and happy me responds ""Come back in 2 and half hours for your buzzer."" - the hostess says this with an emotionless face ""How long is the total wait time?"" -  I asked as my brain starts thinking of alternative choices for dinner now ""5 and a half hours"" - says the hostess like it's nothing unusual   ""Wow..."" - though it was really a ""WTF"" in my head.   How many people have come here only to realize they have to go through an outrageous wait time.  I'm sure everyone has, unless you're a celebrity than maybe your time will be cut in half.  I really like eating here, but I really dislike waiting here.  I've taken naps on those Macy's couches a floor down waiting for my table many a time.  On one occasion, I woke up from a two-hour power nap only to find out there was forty-five minutes left for the table.  What's ridiculous is everyone will still pile in to wait and eat here.  Is there something special about this place?     What's special about this restaurant is the location of it.  It's on top of the Macy's building overseeing the heart of Union Square.  It's a sight to see when everyone is out and about shopping.  The outdoor seating, even on cold nights, isn't too bad especially if you have a heating lamp close to you.  I actually prefer the outdoor seating, because the lighting in the regular dining area is a tiny bit too dim for me. They give you bread at the beginning of the meal and by far the dark colored bread, which I call ""chocolate bread"", is far superior to the sourdough stuff it comes with it.  It's especially good if it's still warm, and I usually ask for an extra helping of that.  When you open the menu and scan through their choices, I'm telling you now.  The food is above average.  That goes for everything on the menu.  It's good, but doesn't have a ""Wow"" factor.  So it doesn't matter what you get.  It's going to be above average.  I've ordered their meat loaf the most and I get the ""you ordered that at Cheesecake Factory?"" question a lot.  I can't help it; I like meatloaf.  I like the fact they serve their breakfast menu all day.   Cheesecake Factory visit is never finished without a slice of cheesecake.  I'm a fan of cheesecake and it's hard for anywhere to beat the choices they have on their cheesecake list.  I'm a simple guy, so I usually tend to get the regular one.  The tiramisu and the carrot cake ones are my other favorites.   The biggest pro is the view and their different kind of cheesecakes.  Unfortunately, I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory location 3 stars due to the wait time.  There are just too many choices in that area to justify waiting that long to eat here.  If it wasn't for hand-held devices and smart phones, I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't wait that long."
Anisha G.,"Oakland, United States",88,375,25,2.0,27/4/2011,"The service here was ridiculous. We sat at the bar, and ordered lunch. The bar tender forgot to put in my order -- it was too obvious. I waited there for 15 minutes after my cousin got her burger and asked for it a couple times. I was told, it walked away.  I finally got my sandwich, it was good, nothing amazing. I got sweet potato fries too which were okay too. They compensated our beers which was a nice gesture."
Peter T.,"San Diego, United States",302,835,382,4.0,22/7/2008,"My ex-girlfriend LOVED this place. The food is pretty damn good considering its price. 20 dollars will get you the Steak Diane. Filet medallions with some sort of gravy with shitake mushrooms with some mega soft mashed potatoes. For the same price, you can lessen the steak portion and add a 6- something ounce salmon filet. The salmon is rubbed in herbs and is slightly undercooked which i find to be a glaring strong point in fish. Two drawbacks. Service and wait-time. Even on a monday afternoon around 2-3 you will find yourself waiting 20 minutes for a table, and on  weekends? You'll be lucky to wait less than an hour and a half. Worth the wait? Maybe if you are visiting out of town.  As for the service? similar to hard rock cafes. Hardcore corporate. The service staff is very friendly, but i sense that they feel over worked and that they are under a lot of stress due to the  management and corporate. I have attended this particular Cheesecake the better part of a dozen times, and only once have i had a personable conversation with a server. For the most part, they walk around with a corporate smile, and give corporate service. I feel so bad for them! Treat your employees better cheese cake, then you'll get that fifth, and well earned star."
