Cynthia C.,"San Francisco, United States",313,623,1613,3.0,13/11/2010,This place gets  points for always being solid on the miso salmon. I always order the same thing each time I'm here and it never disappoints. The salmon is always moist and the sauce they serve with it is just delicious.  The servings are gigantic so make sure you order to share or don't overdose on appetizers because you definitely need to save room for dessert.  I always have the vanilla bean cheesecake because I love the flavor of vanilla bean but they have a HUGE selection for your heart's desire.
William D.,"Paso Robles, United States",0,5,2,1.0,5/12/2014,Went on a Friday afternoon while shopping. 50 minutes to be seated but they text you so you can shop.   Once seated though it was a long wait to order. Long wait to be served. Over an hour and a half total and we took the desert to go !    Food was ok. Ran out of the cheese steak sandwich.  How do you do that?  $100 for four people with no booze.  Gotta be fifty better places for lunch within a block.  Don't go here
Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, United States",1450,1057,137,4.0,14/4/2008,"3 stars for the actual dining experience. They are known for their CHEESECAKE (hint hint the CHEESECAKE FACTORY), not their salads, entrees, beef, chicken, what have you. The decor is loud and obnoxious. I've said that in other reviews, and I'll say it again. The waiters wear ALL. WHITE. Who the hell does that? Honestly. ALL. WHITE. That's like asking for it. Plus, you know they're gonna get sued one day if some girl who works her ass off there gets TSS from being paranoid she's going to get her period during work. (ewww...) Anyways, the other day when my friend was coming over to pick up my motorcycle (that fucker wouldn't start!!! ::cries acidic tears of unhappiness::), he told me he was at Cheesecake Factory and I asked him to grab me a slice of the most peanut buttery cheesecake they had. I was kind of belligerent when I ordered this, I don't know if that means anything... Well he brought me the most mothereffing wonderful slice of heaven this Earth has to offer. I stood there and stared at it for like, 5 minutes before throwing it in the fridge and saying to myself ""This...is...for later."" And it was. I ate half of it on Friday, another 1/4 on Saturday, and finished it up on Sunday. It was SO good, in fact, that I WILLINGLY delayed finishing it. Seriously? When does THAT ever happen!?!?  Averaged out, 4 stars. 3 stars for dining experience, 23987293847 stars for the motherfuckin cheesecake that tasted like a peanut butter lovers heaven."
James W.,"San Francisco, United States",26,18,,2.0,15/9/2010,"I finally found out why its called the Cheesecake factory. Its because you come here for Cheesecake ONLY as I so painfully learned. The food was marginal, and overpriced.  It was crowded with people and the lines were long.  The one extra star was for the prime location above Union Square."
Katie Anne N.,"San Francisco, United States",631,1335,908,3.0,2/3/2011,"A slice of the red velvet cheesecake may be $10 but it is well worth the hefty price tag. I often get one to go and devour it in the privacy of my own home. I noticed that if you go to Cheesecake Factory during lunch, there is hardly a wait for a table."
Sherrell D.,"Pittsburg, United States",10,57,16,4.0,30/7/2010,I've been to this location on more than one occasion both times were totally different.  First time:  I had a large group with me it was a Saturday evening so it took forever. The group was over 10 people and after a few hours of waiting we got our table it was later on in the evening around closing so everyone wanted to go home... the service could have been better regardless of how long you've been on your feet... Any way the food was great but they forgot to put in my friends order and she ended up getting a free meal out of there mess up .. Bonus points.  *Minus: Can't call ahead for reservations. *  Second Time:  It was just my brother and I. (lil' dinner here just cause!)  Looked at a few Yelpers! suggestions to sit on the patio and we were seated very quickly. The view was wonderful as we looked down over Union Square! The service was great we didn't have to ask for any refills or anything our waiter was on it!  with a meal under our belts + cheesecake it was over ... sleepy time for sure!  *Minus: - Patio seating is wonderful if you like to eat with the Pigeons. they cleaned up the tables faster than the wait staff You would think with a restaurant like this the situation wouldn't be this way.  * (The Staff did clean the tables in a quick & sanitary manner. Better believe I was looking!)  Come during a week night if you can ASAP you will get seated quickly in or outside.
Meg W.,"East Bay, United States",266,885,371,4.0,26/4/2010,"When the clock strikes 6p at my office, and you're a staff member who's boss has tagged you as somebody who might miss the last bart train out for the want of trial exhibits, you get a magical email from the mysterious ""Mercy"" (makes sense her name is Mercy, really) saying something akin to *here's tonight's menu, your limit is $25, enjoy.* One night this week it was TCF.  After considering the *Weight Management* section of the menu, I threw caution to the wind and went with the spicy cashew chicken plus a side of steamed veg: $17.50 and $4.50 respectively.  ($17.50 for cashew chicken??? seems a bit, umm, pricey. If I was paying anyway.) All us chosen staffers got another email a bit later ""Come pick up your order on 19!"" Awesome. I could get used to this. Oh, hell, I already am.  The cashew chicken dish was huge. No, enormous. And damn good. More chicken than rice, really? Seriously.   I added more of my personal office-pantry chili paste, but it was spicy enough in it's own right for the average bear. The veg I got were completely forgettable, I couldn't tell you which were included. Skip those.  So, no I didn't have the signature cheesecake, or from what I hear, the signature long wait for a table, but I loved my spicy cashew chicken. Not sure it's worth missing the last train out, but still..."
jim b.,"San Francisco, United States",0,135,,1.0,27/6/2014,".....Please, relative to what you have to put yourself through, the crowds of tourists and out of towners, the high prices, the mediocre or worse food, why bother...the cheesecake is fine, the rest junk...if they were located anywhere else, not atop Macys they would be long gone....its a shame Foreigners and Tourists are exposed to this gosh awful place as an example of a San Francisco restaurant...go downstairs out on the street and have a Hot Dog, its good and a lot cheaper..."
Prince D.,"Concord, United States",0,2,,1.0,20/1/2015,"Horrible service. We were told a 10 min wait that ended up as a 40 min wait. I mean I understand it's SF but really?! It was a Tuesday and you told me 10... Anyways we got over that but I've never had such crappy service, our food comes back cold and stale(and I usually don't like my food hot) but this was just way too cold for anyone to want to eat. We never got asked how things were going inbetween. I will never go back here again."
Sus... B.,"San Francisco, United States",215,252,4,3.0,17/3/2010,"I see it as an upscale Denny's with booze, which isn't really a bad thing.  The heated patio and the kick-ass views from the top of Macy's make up for a lot of the mediocrity though. As with many chains, there are huge portions that are available on a novel-length menu, with an additional Sunday brunch menu.  Drinks are pretty strong and rather decent, though I strongly suggest saying ""pink VODKA lemonade"" rather than ""raspberry lemonade"" in case the server thinks you want it without liquor (ack!). The food is average - not horrible, certainly edible, though I found my huevos rancheros a bit gloopy and lacking in spice.  Oh, and I guess they sell cheesecake here too or something?  I'm always too full to even want to look at a slice the few times I've been here. Naturally after eating here, my brother and I promptly caught the F train to Fisherman's Wharf in order to get chocolate at Ghiradelli Square, me clutching my leftovers in a Cheesecake Factory bag. All I needed was a big camera and a fannypack."
Josh Q.,"San Francisco, United States",33,414,,2.0,12/10/2014,"It's an average spot, but for a restaurant located in the center of touristy Union Square, the food and prices are surprisingly acceptable.  Several dishes have lunch and dinner portion sizes, and the lunch portions are huge - even for me.  The Pasta da Vinci stands out for me, even if it can get greasy.  The bread is also very good.  In terms of drinks, the bottomless lemonade is way too sweet.  Seems to be a theme here - everything is large, oversized, way too sweet/greasy, but a good 'value' if you're into that kind of thing."
Bakulia K.,"San Francisco, United States",4,23,,4.0,11/7/2013,"I love food here, its very light and easy and delicious, the only thing is you have to wait forever to get a table. Once Ive waited literally an hour. And its very crowded."
Sabrina A.,"Mountain View, United States",512,1197,211,2.0,10/3/2011,"I've eaten at a few Cheescake Factories and really, I like it.  Sure, it's huge portions of pretty good food with pretty good cocktails.  I've liked the sandwiches, the pastas, the steak and tons of other dishes.  Usually the staff has been good, I like the decor and in general I have a pleasant experience? Why the 2 stars? During Christmas time my family came up to enjoy the decorations, Macy's SPCA window, the big Christmas tree and take my niece to see all the pretty things I did as a child.  We were all having a great time until Cheesecake Factory. We come up and see tons of people waiting, ok we understand.  It's an hour and a half wait but we can get a pager and come back.  Ok, great.  We come back and wait and wait.  10 minutes after we are told it will be longer, 20 minutes after we are told it will be a little longer - all with rude attitudes.  I get it though, it's busy, people want to eat and I can imagine it's sorta stressful . . . . But it takes forever for our waitress to help us.  It takes 45 minutes to get our food we ordered right away.  They forget salad dressing and fries of two different dishes randomly and when I ask?  No one comes back or not until the very end.  Service was so spotty and horrible.  Though our waitress was friendly, she wasn't to be seen or help.   The waiting and lack of service really killed the experience and while the food was good, it sure put a dent in our Holiday plans that day and mood.  While it was busy, the wait and service was unreasonably bad."
Nora F.,"San Diego, United States",405,235,45,4.0,15/4/2013,"This cheesecake factory is one you have to go to! I don't frequent all of the other ones because their menu is overwhelming and their drinks are overpriced.  This one's view was just beautiful.  You look out of the window and you see all of San Fran.  We ordered a few items from the fit and fare menu and I think it's better than their regular menu.  The only issue was that one of the orders should have been made vegetarian but there was meat in it when it came out.  But the waiter took care of everything and it ended being comped anyway.  Their veggie burger is just amazing, you have to try it once."
Matt H.,"Oakland, United States",1234,96,261,4.0,27/2/2012,"Oh my, Cheesecake Factory (any of the locations) always makes my day bright- but this one is especially awesome.  Located at the mega Macy's at Union Square in SF, the menu here is pretty outstanding- especially the dessert menu.  It's a bit pricey, and often times the wait times are long, but what do you expect? It's a touristy spot, and that's what you'll get if you go there.  Well...that and perfect dessert, great customer service, and a pretty crazy looking burger if that's your thing."
Van N.,"San Leandro, United States",0,380,483,4.0,25/5/2011,Wait is too long at this location. Always at least 45 minutes. Sometimes up to 2 hours. I remember several times coming here only to be disappointed I wont be able to eat unless I decided to wait. I was hungry so a wait is definietely not in the plans. Otherwise the service is fantastic and the portions are big! Cheesecake is heavenly
Jenny L.,"Placentia, United States",350,226,226,5.0,7/10/2012,"I've reviewed this place a few times already but I can't help it! Such a perfect location for a nice evening date. After about a 20-25 min wait on a Friday night, we scored seats on their rooftop terrace.  We had such a nice view as we were eating dinner, I couldn't have been more pleased with my pick for dinner that night. I got my usual, the chicken bellagio, and it did not let me down. I love how much pesto flavor I can taste in the pasta and the crispyness of the chicken with the salty prosciutto just makes the dish so addicting. But I always have trouble finishing this massive plate of food. It can literally feed 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are.  I also tried his smokehouse bbq burger which was pretty damn good, not even going to lie. Especially if you're a guy. This is a man's burger. The fries were super crispy but not crispy so that there was nothing left inside.  All in all, a must try if you've never been to cheesecake factory, especially at this location. Definitely should get a seat outside if you can, it wasn't chilly at all! Just slightly cool but there were heaters everywhere that did a good job of keeping us warm without making us sweat or anything."
Serena Z.,"San Francisco, United States",0,56,,4.0,9/1/2014,"My friend brought me here once and we got cheesecake. I got the macadamia cheesecake, it's sweet and yummy. They also they have the strawberry shortcake here, which I have never had before. It's just nice to look at the display filled with a variety of cheesecakes. This place is located inside of Macy's."
Debby D.,"Burlingame, United States",3,147,2,4.0,7/11/2013,"a college international buddy invited me to be here and I was born in SF and I didn't even know about it. I really liked the outlook and the view, but I remember there was this one waiter, he was only working there 2 week and he was so friendly. I don't mind eating there but there wait is loonnng. somehow I eat all this food, I cant eat the main dessert haha"
Hamida S.,"Fremont, United States",1,11,,1.0,6/1/2014,Waited an hour.    Waited another half hr to place order.   Waited additional half hr to be served.     Nachos were so deep fried that turned brown and broke the teeth if once try to eat it.      Quality of food and service is a big fat zero.    After dinning there I figure out why people go there.    May be to enjoy the view and say that yes they ate at union square
