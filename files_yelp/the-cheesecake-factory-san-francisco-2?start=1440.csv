Sara W.,"San Jose, United States",1187,579,48,4.0,30/5/2012,"There are a lot of Cheesecake Factories, but I wanted to review this one because of the outside seating on the top of the Macy's in Union Square. It's a great place, though it gets super busy and the wait can be 3 hours, maybe longer! I love the veggie burgers because they're made with beets and they're soft and the flavor is great. Good portions and good quality. I always enjoy my visits here."
Lorenzo A.,"Pembroke Pines, United States",104,67,39,4.0,25/3/2010,You get so much food for what you pay for! The view on top of MACY's overlooking Union Square at night is gorgeous. I always visit this Cheesecake Factory every time I visit SF. I highly recommend the fried macaroni & cheese balls. It's AMAZINGGGGGGG.
Gracie B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",374,25,1,4.0,11/9/2011,"Beware, I just found a piece of metal (like a piece of a hook) in my calamari! I love the Cheesecake Factory...it is my favorite restaurant. I was just a bit disappointed to find a piece of metal in my calamari appetizer."
Eric L.,"Boston, United States",81,5,,3.0,10/4/2010,Good service  but a baby was crying had some meatloaf with some mashed potatoes it  was okay velvet cake cheesecake was delicious till i saw the calories
Marge M.,"Hayward, United States",41,37,789,4.0,30/5/2012,"Lots of people come here and for a reason. Let me just get it out of the way. The cheesecake is to die for, almost each and every one of them. My favorite, the turtle cheesecake. Yumdiliyumcious! And, the view is amazing if you get to sit outside. Food (quality and size) and service is 3.5-4 stars. Having said that, expect to wait for awhile if you're visiting on a weekend when the place is commonly packed. Weekdays are less crowded except for lunch hours. If you're by yourself or have a friend with you, go straight to the bar where you'll have no problem finding a seat."
Sophie g.,"Richmond, United States",256,20,10,5.0,26/7/2010,But why not.? i love the red velvet cheese cake! had a wonderful dinner i ordered the ribs... Sooooo good! my boyfriend ordered the garlic noodles with chicken and shrimp this dish wasnt the best but overall the meal/atmosphere/ and cheesecake was good and our server lauren was very nice!
Skylar S.,"Los Angeles, United States",52,177,14,4.0,18/8/2010,"The food is good enough. The service is pleasant enough. The line, however, is always long (hours during peak times) and let's face it. For the quality of food served, the place is a bit on the overpriced side. However, this place is popular enough and will always be loved by the teenage crowd who seem to love this place.  Overall, pleasant enough, but not GREAT GREAT."
Ken G.,"San Francisco, United States",413,1652,37,4.0,4/8/2008,"Okay...I'll start off by saying that chain restaurants are usually not my thing.  They usually have predictable menus and pretty bland food and people who don't really want to work there. What Cheesecake Factory does that is so different from everyone else is that they try to please everybody, which is perfect for families.  Anyone who's seen their menu notices the 30-40 different entree's available to order - considering they also go across a range of cuisine from Native American, to Thai, to Mexican, to Italian, they do a decent job of making everything taste pretty good.   What they really excel at, however, are the burgers and salads - they give you huge portions and they make everything taste so impressive. The burgers come in a range of choices, but no matter which one is ordered, they are all juicy and full of flavor (the kobe beef is impressive!).  The salads are great since they give you a hefty portion of something that usually doesn't fill you up very well.  Salads such as the BBQ chicken or Chinese chicken are full of flavor and very healthy - it's a great way to eat out, have a good, flavorful meal, but not worry about too many calories/fat in your diet. Of course, the best things at Cheesecake Factory are the cheesecakes - absolutely amazing!  Whether you like fruit, chocolate or coffee, they have something for everyone.  They even have good desserts that aren't cheesecakes.  My personal favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake - a flourless dark chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, chocolate cheesecake and a dark chocolate ganache - how can you not like this?!?!? In short, I'm strangely impressed by this place...my advice is to stick to the following: -Salads -Burgers -Cheesecake Anything outside of these items can be hit or miss. BTW, try to plan accordingly when you go...there's ALWAYS at least a 45 minute wait to get in."
Aphrodite L.,"San Francisco, United States",98,48,19,4.0,21/4/2010,"I went there on Tuesday night with my bf Most of the food we ordered was from the small menu: tuna tartare, fries, chicken, tuna salad. Everything was very good. My bf had a mojito and it was perfect for me but it was too sweet for him.. I had a strawberry martini, which I liked, but I have to admit that it was very sweet and very syrupy. I ended up asking the server for some lemon and some water to add to the drink... Service was very good, friendly and attentive."
Marisa R.,"San Francisco, United States",200,195,16,4.0,2/8/2010,"The wait is sooooooo long if you go at peak times.  But, it is damn worth it.  They have a menu the size of the Bible.  There's something for everyone!!  I love the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. And their brown bread (free).  Slow service for the most part. But, once in awhile you get lucky and get a good one.   Ambiance is really nice because it's on the top of Macy's and the view is beautiful."
Hilary S.,"Toronto, Canada",110,252,40,3.0,5/9/2010,"The food here is so filling and is typical of an american slightly upscale chain restaurant. Yummy but not gourmet in the slightest. But I always leave stuffed out of my mind. I compare it to milestones or pickle barrel or similar in Toronto. Not as if that comparison helps anyone. The one thing about this location is that it's packed. As everyone says, wait time is minimum forty minutes consistently and they do not take reservations. It's also extremely loud because of how many people are hanging around and waiting. It's probably because of the location--on top of Macys in downtown, and swathed with tourists. But the location is also a good thing because sitting outside gives you an awesome view. And the heat lamps work (which is better than some places I've been to). When I'm waiting, I like to take the pager and go down one floor to the furniture show room and lounge out on one of the many sofas they have. It's a perfect way to wait with your friends after a busy day downtown."
Allie D.,"San Francisco, United States",93,115,5,3.0,30/4/2013,"I must say that it's just all about the view, and the food is just ordinary.  I came here on a whim since I was starving and in Macy's.  They sat us outside and it was pretty chilling, but they did turn on the heater.  I don't think this Cheesecake is any different than other locations.  I didn't notice a happy hour menu either, so I'm not sure if they offer that."
Julie M.,"San Francisco, United States",7,52,18,4.0,30/4/2011,"AWSEOME FOOD! BUT the wait is torture like 1 hour to sit down and 30 mins for the food to arrive,"
Kimberly C.,"San Francisco, United States",271,34,,3.0,1/6/2011,"My best recommendation for visiting this Cheesecake is to come with a friend or two max and sit at the bar, which is what I've done in the past 3 or 4 times I've come here.  Never try to enter with a big party for dinner or at any hour on the weekends unless you are ready to hunker down and wait for at minimum 40 minutes.  I'm not really sure why with such a big space the restaurant is disorganized and the lobby gets insane and uncomfortably crowded.   I'm still coming back to this Cheesecake because I know how to work it so that it fits what I want out of it.  Newbies should avoid unless you really want the Cheesecake experience."
Gina Y.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",1594,175,1044,3.0,14/7/2012,"I love their salmon rolls. Their plates are huge. However, I can't stand the long wait to get a table."
SC O.,Australia,0,11,1,1.0,18/8/2013,"Walked into this Cheesecake Factory for dinner and was told the waiting time is 30 minutes. Okay, fair enough, so I agreed to come back in half an hour. Came back in 30minutes, again I was told to wait ANOTHER 30 minutes. I didn't feel hungry anymore after hearing this! So I walked out and found myself a nice Japanese dinner a few blocks away from here."
Derrick T.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, United States",0,3,,2.0,25/12/2014,"Food's great but pricey. Attentive service but a smile would be nice. Tip for the holidays- eat a meal before going because the wait to get a table along with getting your food is enough time until your next recommended meal. Overall, 2."
Sassy G.,"San Francisco, United States",5,65,,3.0,16/8/2011,"My staple dishes when we patron the Cheesecake Factory.  I always leave happy and satisfied.  The only down-side is the wait so VERY VERY long!   Firecracker Salmon Spiced Fresh Salmon Rolled in Spinach and Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Sweet Hot Chili Sauce. Crabcakes Served with Mustard and Tartar Sauce. Shrimp with Angel Hair Large Shrimp Sautéed with Herbs, Lemon and Garlic Combined with Angel Hair Pasta, Tomato and Fresh Basil. Thai Lettuce Wraps Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew.

Neni E.,"San Francisco, United States",6,124,34,3.0,18/11/2012,"Had lunch with a friend here after the movies on Saturday. It was super busy, but we got seated within 30 min. after being told it was a 45 min. wait. We both order our drinks first. I'm on the verge of coming down with a cold....again....and needed something for my sore throat. Their cocktail menu listed a cocktail called Kentucky Tea (Wid Turkey whiskey, honey, and lemon) and it sounded just what I needed for this on-coming cold. We both were expecting the drinks to be in highball glasses, but they weren't. They were in these tall cocktail glasses (frou-frou drinks), but that was okay. It was yummy, but only kept it to one drink for me while my friend ordered another when she was done with hers.  So it's been a long time since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory to eat and  I know why. Not because the food is bad, but this location attracts a lot of tourists. Yeah, well, we were starving and didn't want to eat mall food or trek a long way, so opted for here. We both had burgers. I ordered the Cajun Burger (medium) with the fries while my friend had the BLT burger with blue cheese (?) and fries. I hadn't had a burger since before Lent this year, so needless to say, I devoured mine. The fries were pretty tasty too! Crispy. Just the way I like 'em! If my friend didn't eat hers, I would've finished them off too. My Cajun burger had andouille sausage and sauteed onions and bell peppers. No cheese on this particular burger, but that was okay. I'm lactose =). Nonetheless, my burger was delish and finished before my friend who only ate half of her burger. Oh, my burger was also on a brioche bun, which made it perfect!  For a chain restaurant, I had a pretty good experience for having my first burger here. It's only the second time I've had lunch here and I can't remember what I had the first time I ate here years ago. Oh, and of course, we ordered cheesecakes. My fave, Khalua for me and banana cream for her...to go though. I'd come back here to try one of their other burgers, but maybe when tourist season dies down =). Note sure if I'd try any of the other entrees, but their burgers, yes! Three stars because they need more seating area where people can wait to be called when a table is ready. Music selection could be better. Noise and too much crowding near the elevator and escalator while people are waiting for their tables."
kent c.,"San Jose, United States",45,266,364,3.0,17/5/2010,"Same ol' wait... Like it or not, this place get crowded mostly throughout the time they are opened til when they close. I had some relatives in town. I was told by the hostess that the wait would be an 1 hour for a party of 4. It was on a Saturday and we got there at 6pm. We didn't get seated until 7:45pm. I asked for the outside seats because it would've been faster, but we were still seated inside at the end. VERY disappointing because we came here mainly to enjoy the view.  SO, what to do you until then? You stare at the cheesecakes. or go shop in Macy's  =) I came to a conclusion that if you stick with the MISO SALMON ($20) your taste buds will be rewarded.   Hibachi Steak is very very tasty.  Strawberry Cheesecake ($7.50) - ultimate hardy bulge to the stomach.   I am still very torn about this place. It is a hit or miss for the experience (view) and service vs. food. ::INFO:: They only take reservations for the 1st hour of lunch time. Besides that first come, first serve to that lovely table."
