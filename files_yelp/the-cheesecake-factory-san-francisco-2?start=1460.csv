Justin G.,"Norman, United States",16,46,55,3.0,16/1/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. What do you expect? It's consistently decent food, but the only real reason to eat here is to get a table out on the roof overlooking Union Square. Otherwise, it's no different than any other Cheesecake Factory. Be sure to bring a jacket if you're going to be seated outside. It does get cold quickly!"
Jay B.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",104,409,360,4.0,30/1/2011,"We come here when we are in the city. The view from the outside is pretty cool.  The wait is PRETTY LONG!!  Your better off at the bar if you want some drinks and something to eat.  The food is alright but with some drinks, its delicious :)"
Julia K.,"San Francisco, United States",186,346,9,1.0,2/3/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed me so much to the point that I'd actually give them such a bad rating. This particular Cheesecake Factory is at the top of the Union Square Macy's. Definitely full of tourists, meaning the line is ridiculous. My party of 7 had to wait more than an hour! But anyway, once we were seated, our waitress was kind of not there. No matter at this point, since we had more time to look over the menu to be sure of what we wanted. My group that I went with loves appetizers. So, we ordered a bunch of them:  * buffalo wings * sliders * normal fries * fried calamari * fried mac and cheese * avocado rolls * sweet potato fries. Do you see a trend here? All of these appetizers were FRIED, except for one. Talk about high caloric intake. To me, all the appetizers besides the sweet potato fries and avocado rolls were good. Everything else was just mediocre. The one thing I have to complain about is that when we were finished with more than half the calamari, my brother's girlfriend found a hair fried up in one of the calamaris. We showed our waitress and the only thing she offered was to make us another one. Didn't offer to take it off our bill - look at our table! We have enough appetizers, we don't want any more especially if there's a chance there could be more hairs in there. When the entrees came, the meal only became worse. All of our entrees looked dry as if they were sitting under the heat lamp for an extended period of time. Even if we had a lot of appetizers and needed some time to finish, I don't think that was the issue. Our watress was seriously just a ghost. She would pop in every 20 minutes or so. After most of our appetizers were taken away, we still waited about 15 minutes before our entrees came out. Most likely there were ready and were just sitting in the window for 15 minutes while our waitress took her time to get our food.  I understand that Cheesecake Factory is popular and has a high throughput of people dining there - however, since the restaurant knows this, they would equip staff who knew how to manage their time better. It also didn't help that the waitress was not very helpful when it came to understanding my mom's english. My mom came to the US when she was 20, of course her English isn't perfect, but it's better than a lot of tourists who dine there! Our waitress should have been more accomodating and patient when taking our orders.  I could rant on and on and list the entrees we ordered, but I won't bother. Definitely NOT coming back here. Too much of a hassle."
Gloria Y.,"San Francisco, United States",100,148,77,2.0,27/2/2011,"I used to look forward to dining here.  The menu is extensive and the portions never disappoint.  However, this time I was not impressed.  This was about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night.  We came here for a post-movie midnight snack.  We were seated about 40 minutes before closing time, which most likely explained the rushed service we got.  I almost slipped twice walking to our table and walking from our table to the restroom.  The restroom was gross.  Open toilet paper rolls were literally sitting on the floor. Yuck.   We ordered the thai chicken wrap, which was surprising flavorful and tender.  The mini corndogs were bleh...I wouldn't be surprised if they were the frozen ones sold at Costco.  I really wanted to have a slice of cheesecake, but I felt like the waiter wanted to see us go so he can go home.  This place is no longer the place I looked forward to visiting anymore.  There are so many other worthwhile places deserving of my hard-earned money."
Lauren T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,2.0,20/12/2014,"I see why they call this place a tourist trap...and the food is mediocre. The only thing they had going on was the view, which since it was raining, really didn't have anything going for them."
Adam F.,"Las Vegas, United States",20,9,,3.0,3/1/2012,"I really like this place a lot and like to meet up with friends here every time I'm in San Francisco. In the warmer months it's nice to sit on the patio which overlooks Union Square, one of my favorite places in San Francisco to kill time or just hang out. The menu is absolutely GINORMOUS; if you're not careful you could easily get caught up for 30 minutes just figuring our what you want to order. In the cooler months I like sitting at their bar, having a few strong cocktails and people watching. No matter who your bartender is they consistently make a pretty mean mojito, one of my go to favorites. So why only three stars? It really is a three star restaurant by Yelp standards; this place is A-OK. The food is decent and they're a fast paced tourist trap. I've never had a dish here that blows my mind, but I've never had a bad plate of food either. The servers are always a little rushed, which is to be expected, but never rude and I almost never have to ask for anything twice or water refills. Bottom line; great place to hang out and have some food and drinks, especially compared to the pricier options in the Union Square area, which offer a far superior product with a price point to match."
Alison S.,"Vancouver, Canada",48,418,3,3.0,29/12/2010,"Ask a Canadian what they like about America and many of them will list things like lower taxes on shopping, the dollar now being at parity, outlet malls, and Cheesecake Factory. Despite the fact that we like to brag about our national obesity rate sitting (very slightly) lower, many Canadians that I've met (mostly male) have raved about Cheesecake Factory.  The reason is simply that you can get about $30 worth of food for $15.  Portions are HUGE.  I eat like a man and I still need to share. The downside to this: their food is quite heavy.  The saucy dishes definitely are more on the gravy-ish side.  I had an ahi tuna dish, which was lighter and easier to finish, but my friend managed to plow through only about 1/3 of her shepherd's pie and had to take the rest home. Another downside: the wait.  Come in on a Friday night and you're looking at a 1.5 hr wait AT LEAST.  It doesn't matter how small your party is.  My friend pointed out to me that we could do takeout, which we did, and it was fantastic. As for the cheesecakes, they come in many different flavours, and are quite flavourful and rich.  I'm not always in the mood for such a sweet dessert but when I am it hits the spot!  The vanilla bean cheesecake was tasty and probably a little lighter than the more chocolatey creations (although my universal favourite will always some kind of berry white chocolate cheesecake) I recommend for takeout mostly, or if you really love standing (you can also wander around macy's while you wait for a table, they give you a little buzzer thing)."
Michelle O.,"Ladera Ranch, United States",168,546,80,3.0,30/6/2010,"At the top of the Macy's building in Union Square, this CF is just like any of the others.  We decided we wanted dessert late and walked through blistering winds from the Nikko to CF.  The security guard downstairs ushered us into the only operational elevator and off we rode to the top floor still shivering from the cold. Once inside, they offered us outdoor seating under the heat lamps but that sounded absurd and declined.  With the dessert page open, suddenly cheesecake didn't sound as good as the items on the small plate & breakfast pages.  After much debate, I ended up w/the energy omlette--egg whites with sautéed spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was really good but also pretty filling!   The service there was mediocre.  We weren't impressed by anything specific and basically enjoyed a late night bite while looking out onto Union Square."
Cher L.,"Jacksonville, United States",0,9,,5.0,16/12/2014,"Not only was our food amazing but when my husband spilled his wine, our dear waiter Peter..took it off our bill....we will continue to come here as long as we live!!"
Drew F.,"Oakland, United States",42,113,228,3.0,14/2/2013,"Allways crowded and takes forever, but they do have a sweet view of union square n the food is yummy. Just make sure you call in a res or get there before 7pm so you can wait just down stairs lounging on a new sofa at the furniture store."
Jason A.,"San Jose, United States",443,335,954,4.0,30/7/2008,"It took me 4 to 5 dine-in's at Cheesecake Factory to realize that the only thing worth the price is the complimentary bread and Burger/Sandwich Specialty Menu. Any other pasta dish or salad entree is a flat-out ripoff (yeah, I said it!) CF's glorified Double-Double, or ""TONS OF FUN BURGER"" as they call here, was more than enough to hold me over for the 4-hour+ shopping spree my family & i had in Union Square. Sitting on top of Macy complex, you get a great view of the square off the restaurant's terrace. Hosts/Hostesses at the front desk were very accommodating for our party of 18, not to mention a very friendly & quick-service waitress. Amber, I think was her name; she had a lot of cheerleader qualities from what I remember, but who remembers their server's name anyway? Nevertheless, the cheeriness made the dining experience much more entertaining for the kids' table. Parents took care of the bill which left our wallets untouched for the shops on Powell and Post. Great day. Have at it if you don't mind the crowded Macy's elevator or high escalator scale."

Kevin L.,"San Francisco, United States",24,2,,5.0,20/7/2013,"I come here all the time with my friend and it never disappoints. The wait can get long depending on the time you arrive. The burgers are delicious, but you have to keep room for the cheesecake.  I have yet to try all of them."
Mimi S.,"Colma, United States",35,171,86,3.0,29/1/2010,"Ate here many many times only during dinner.  Every single time there is a long long wait.  Which becomes super annoying.  Tonight I came here for a friend's birthday.  We waited for over an hour, go seated, ordered our food.  I ordered the special Chicken Di Pana.  It was a huge portion for $12.95.  The buttery sauce was delicious, the chicken breast was deliciou, the mashed potatoes, and yes even the steamed mini buddle of broccoli.  After stuffing all of this in my face, my cousin pointed out a ""bug"" on the wall.  I looked, and it wasnt a typical ""bug"".  It was an effen ROACH ON THE WALL.  Making it's way up, down, side to side, and camoflauged itself by the seat.  We flagged down the manager and he comp'd our whole meal and gave us all the cheesecake we wanted.   ---- customer service was excellent ---- the food was mediocore but HUGE portions Even though we saw a roach, I would still come here for the food.  I just hope and pray they dont sit me back at the same spot where the roach appeared."
Lia K.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,10/2/2014,"Every time i went there, food were great. But service? What service? Today i was eating salad. Suddenly i felt like i was chewing something else not food. Then spilt. It was foil. I told our table waitress and she said sorry which was understandable. People make mistakes. I didn't care much and i enjoyed the rest of dishes. Every food was so great. However, since English is my second language, a few waitress think that i can't hear English at all. After i got our bill, i needed to break my 20bucks to two 10bucks. I was in a hurry. I tried to wait until our table waitress come. i couldn't find her. So i asked another waitress who was walking right my side. I asked her to do very nicely. She replied with frowned face and ""blah blah fu** me"". What's the matter with her? I don't know? She just wanted me to know that asking break money to other waitress was not inappropriate, or she just thought i couldn't hear or i couldn't understand what she would say? So she just said silently? I am not a deaf. I know i should have waited until our table waitress come, but i was in a hurry. Even though she was upset of me, she shouldn't have acted like that. Saying ""fu**"" word to the customer? I am so disappointed to the cheese cake factory. I am so sorry for my self to write bad story here. This is my first time to write here. Also i am so sorry for her. I am not going there ever again because of her rudeness."
Prashanth R.,"Sterling Heights, United States",49,117,12,5.0,15/3/2011,"1112 reviews and it still has only 3 stars.. hmmm. I would like to disagree and give it 5 stars.  I think the shortcoming about the this place is the wait time but don't try to go to a romantic spot if you are in a group of more than three people. It's definitely going to take longer for you to find a place to sit. Especially in the terrace.  The two times I've been here, it was only two of us and the wait time was reasonable. fifteen to twenty five minutes. But you won't feel that time go by when you are with someone you enjoy your time with. Right!!?  Anyway, the choices are plenty. If you are a vegetarian then it's a little hard but you can still manage. The food came in on time. The view was awesome and the setting was great.  I would definitely go here again."
Sumalatha R.,"Elkhart, United States",9,14,,4.0,9/7/2013,"Good food, generous portions and great dining experience in this restaurant."
Nick B.,"San Francisco, United States",47,81,3,2.0,16/4/2011,"For the price, this place should be way better. We waited almost an hour for food, and were barely checked on. One of our salads arrived with no dressing, and it took them about 15 minutes to get bread on the table. Our meals were unimpressive - a cobb salad with very little bacon or egg, and all the ceasar salads were drab. Their bread was delicious, however.  Overall this place seems terribly overrated to me, and I doubt it would ever exist if it weren't in such a pricey location. People love paying more for a name like Cheesecake Factory, even if the food totally doesn't warrant it. The place is typical, crowded, standard, and ho-hum. You'd be far better off spending half as much at a local eatery, and saving yourself the hassle of waiting an hour and getting subpar service and food."
Natalie N.,"Oakland, United States",244,745,97,3.0,15/7/2010,"TIP: Sit at the bar. If they have any wait whatsoever a lot of times the tall tables at the bar are totally empty and you still get table service. You just have to deal with the tvs and noise - but oh well. It's worth not waiting 45 mins.  The menu here is daunting. Its page after page of choices galore. Then I made a important discovery. The ""Small Plates"" menu!! They have tons of choices, for cheap, and you know the serving sizes here are always big. Their ""small"" is my ""medium"" when it comes to dish sizes. Loved the corn dogs, enjoyed the fries, and the salad was pretty good. Nothing super exciting, but also cooked (or fried!) very well. Service was a little slow when we told them we were in a bit of a hurry, but I think he was pretty busy."
