Johny C.,"Redding, United States",1,17,,4.0,27/8/2011,"I was in San Fran for the night and stayed right in Union Square. My wife and I were hungry, so we walked across the street to the Cheesecake Factory.  The Food was delicious!  My wife had pasta dish with pounded chicken and white sauce(can't remember the name). She loved it and I took a couple bites and thought it was great too.  I was feeling that I wanted a sandwich type meal, so I ordered the Philly cheese steak. It was very good. The fries were the bomb!  All of this leads up to the real reason you go to this place, THE CHEESECAKE!  I had just the basic cheesecake with cherry topping, and my wife had the chocolate cheesecake. It was the best ever. We shared and both of us were stuffed. Great food!  The reason for 4 stars, is that the wait for this place sucks. Well worth the wait once you start eating the great food.  Oh yeah, views from the outdoor area are incredible at night. You look right down on Union Square.  This is a must stop in San Fran."
Debra O.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,2,4.0,4/12/2014,Love the atmosphere the view and the food. No matter what you order it's all delicious. my favorite is their kale salad. When I'm not with family or friends I order to go and avoid the long wait. The wait is the only reason I rated it a four instead of five.
Jackie M.,"San Francisco, United States",148,259,108,3.0,7/5/2012,"3 stars just for the food itself. I love the vast choices I can pick. I have my favorites though, the chicken madeira, miso salmon, sundried tomatoes fettucini, and lemoncello torte for dessert. Any of these things will definitely fulfill any cravings that I have.  Other than the food, Cheesecake factory isn't really all that. When it isn't crowded it's awesome, but when there is a wait, it's absolutely dreadful! On top of that the service is definitely lacking. I've come here a million times and never have I had outstanding service. My most recent visit here was last week where our waiter was basically a ghost!  Another thing that repels me from coming here is the calories in the food. I'm no calorie counter, but damn, when I look at those numbers I get kind of scared."
Tom S.,"Kenwood, United States",267,1646,853,1.0,23/7/2006,"To all my fellow yelpers who rated this restaurant with more than 2 stars, I still love you, but it's time for you to call Overeater's Anonymous and get some help... Last time we were in Union Square Macy's we went up to the top to check it out again. I always get a hoot outt'a seeing the befuddled crowd. This visit,  half the population of Contra Costa county was waiting on-line.  I have a suggestion. Fight your way to the podium. Get your name put on the list. Go down, go out, get back in your car. Drive to the Cheesecake Factory (tm) restaurant in Corte Madera, Marin County.  Park, walk in, sit, order, drink, leisurely Eat 'til you burst. Do NOT have dessert!  NOW, Get back in your car, drive back to Union square, park. Go back upstairs to the podium, ask about how much longer it will be before you'll be called. You should only have about 5 minutes to wait before they'll seat you for dessert."
Maria T.,"Pacifica, United States",0,1,,1.0,30/10/2014,"This place suck..  If your going to have dinner here make sure you guys have the whole day or night to wait.. came @ 9:30pm for a party of 9.. yes we can wait, but host said it will be 30 mins top. So we wait. . 30 mins up no seat, waited for 10 more minutes before asking the host what's going on with our seat.  She said it will be another 15 to 20 mins.  I ask the girl why then she said the wait it only 30 mins in fact I'll be a hour the wait.  So pls don't ever come to the cheese cake factory in union St sf if your hungry. .  You'll just loose your appetite.. but again if your trying to loose weight this is a great place to go.. 1 star shouldn't be an option..."
Vicky T.,"San Anselmo, United States",0,3,,1.0,30/11/2014,"BAD Atention They ignored us for 2 hours nobody of those holsters called us, even dough We saw many guest entering and leaving that restaurant.  2 hours after We asked them again if they have any table for us their answered was that We have to wait for another hour or so after that hour passed they ignored us again finally We decided to cancell because We felt insulted and discriminated. We ignored who is the manager but They must to training their employees to be more efficient and less spoils.  By the way Taco Bell or Panda Express is even better than  garbage cake factory. George"
Ram B.,"Dublin, United States",5,20,,4.0,28/4/2014,Food in this place is great and Service is excellent too. But i just hate that people need to wait for more than 45 mins to get a place. There is no option for reservations too. I hope the wait time improves.
Lisa L.,"San Francisco, United States",562,187,175,2.0,13/1/2013,"Oh Cheesecake Factory... why must I always wait so long for my delicious cheesecakes D:   haha my wait was over an hour long but I guess that's what you get when you go there after work at the location in downtown san francisco :P  I'm not sure if it's just me but it seemed like the girl who took our number down was kind of mean.  And our waiter was really slow.. We waited forever to get menus, to get our food, and he barely checked on us.  I'm not sure if he was new or something but I was on a time crunch and he just stalled with taking the check and all. I was a bit disappointed with but hopefully next time will be better?"
Keane L.,"San Francisco, United States",1007,1106,216,4.0,1/12/2009,"I saw obesity in action in the form of a double cheeseburger and a plate full of curly fries. I couldn't stop looking. It was like a lava lamp.  I'll admit it. I still love this place for what it is, especially during the holiday madness. Homogeneous chain atmosphere. Long ass wait. Sociological experiment... Once you've come to grips with that, you can enjoy their decent food and consistently good service. Just be sure to substitute out the fries and mayo from your sandwich if you plan on not exploding anytime soon."
Michelle C.,"Castro Valley, United States",141,319,28,3.0,13/12/2010,The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. This past weekend I got to check out the Union Square location. Like most locations the wait was long although for a busy Saturday 2 weeks before Christmas the wait was not as bad as I thought it would be only an hour.  While we waited we got to cruise the Macy's furniture department and then hung out on the patio that had a very nice view of the hustle and bustle down below. I went for an old favorite the Shrimp Bacon Club sandwich with sweet potato fries. As usual it was a sloppy mess but worth it I need to remember to order it with less tomatoes next time I have the pleasure. A yummy sandwich and two mojitos later I was very satisfied with my dining experience and hope to visit this location again.
Kaye M.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,66,38,2.0,22/6/2013,It's been over 3 years since I came back to eat here. I ordered their special which is the Fresh Grilled Salmon with Mashed potatoes and Broccoli and the four cheese pasta. The Salmon was great but the mashed potatoes were too salty. The four cheese  was dry. Service was horrible. This guy name Daniel was not too friendly. my son was talking to him and he just ignored him. I usually give more than $10 tip but gave him 7$ which he doesnt deserve.
Rupa S.,"Dunedin, Tampa Bay, United States",18,2,1,1.0,29/1/2012,"I thought this place was as clean as can be, I was proven wrong!!! A cousin and I were  sitting at the bar and witnessed some nasty stuff, the bar tender washed his eyeglasses over the ice that is served in the beverages!!! Absolutely Disgusting, makes me want to call health inspectors on them."
Eric C.,"Berkeley, United States",65,330,5,4.0,10/1/2011,"Short story: How to score a table for 8 on New Year's Eve. Family was out shopping in the afternoon and we eventually decided to get dinner at Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy's in Union Square. This Cheesecake Factory has RIDICULOUS waits during weekends, so I was nervous how long we would have to wait. 4:30pm, I arrive at the counter and asked requested a table for 8. The hostess responded, it'll be a 2h 15m wait, here's a pager, come back in 1h 45m with your entire party since the buzzer only works on the top floor. I rejoin my family in the basement of Macy's. We walk around the ice rink at Union Square. 1h later, in the middle of Union Square, the buzzer sounds. Oh crap. We're still waiting for 2 people who thought dinner wouldn't be for another hour. I head back the up elevator with the buzzer vibrating in my back pocket, so loudly that everyone in the elevator hears it. I explain to the hostess that we weren't planning to be seated until 6:45pm. No problem, just come back when your party is all here. 6:15pm, everyone arrives at the Cheesecake Factory and I tell the hostess we're all here. 15 minutes later, we're seated. Food: the usual -- yummy, with huge portion sizes. Table: seated in a booth, but the floor was nasty and needed to be mopped. the floor was extremely sticky near the bathrooms. Service: the waiter who replaced our waitress while she took a 30 min break was a lot friendlier and attentive to our needs. Tip: Elevator has a weight limit. It'll beep and it won't move if the load's too heavy. That means someone has to get OUT of the elevator before it'll move."
Julia N.,"Elk Grove, United States",1303,601,65,3.0,5/12/2009,"I've noticed a couple of things every time I come to the Cheesecake Factory. 1) I never order the cheesecake and I don't know why. 2) I always forget how enormous the portions are. Wait, wait...I'm figuring this out as I type...The reason I don't ever order cheesecake is because the portions are so enormous that I get too full!! (light bulb flickers on)  I love the fact that you can order virtually anything in the universe at this place. They have everything from pizza, to shepard's pie, to orange chicken. None of it is exceptional per say but how can it be with a menu this big?! My last visit I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and the clam chowder. Both were pretty damn good. I got tired of the salad quickly, though.  On a nice day you should definitely sit out on the deck for some great views of Union square. Make sure you get here early, though, or be prepared for quite a wait. The lobby is always jam packed."
Tinna H.,"San Francisco, United States",736,931,150,3.0,30/11/2009,"The gray clouds rolled in. One could feel the air thicken with moisture. ""Out of curiosity, what is the protocol should it begin to rain?"" we asked our server.  ""You know, in the time that I've worked here, it hasn't happened yet, but we'd move everyone inside and remake the dishes.""  And then it became more than just a drizzle. The delicious bread was becoming more and more sponge-like in quality. We were reseated promptly, and our server personally made sure that we were taken care of inside as quickly as possible. Since we'd just ordered our food, there was no need to remake it. In fact, it was ready when we sat down at our new table. So the service is quite good. I attribute it to the restaurant being in tourist county, but I'm not going to complain. While you wait for your table, grab a seat downstairs in Macy's furniture department. Test out a new couch or two or three. You've got plenty of time. Just don't wander too far.  The food's heavy [lunch portions are usually more than enough for me] and basically puts you to sleep for the next few hours. You'll regret putting that holiday diet on hold for a meal at the Cheesecake Fatory [thanks Ryan V for the term!]. You might want to try out one of the beds on your way out."
Wilhelm Y.,"San Francisco, United States",706,1004,3592,3.0,9/11/2007,"Our party of eight was seated shortly after everybody had arrived.  Since we were all coming from different locations and meeting up at the restaurant the wait for our table really wasn't too bad.  I can not ever recall when this restaurant was not busy; the reception/waiting area was packed as usual. A server took us to our corner table, loaded us up with fresh bread and ice water then told us that the regular waiter was on break, and we would see him shortly.  The warm, soft breads were very good and another server returned to refill our water glasses at least twice while we waited for our waiter.  Our waiter finally appeared.  He apologized for the wait and spoke quickly in announcing the evening's special and the soup.  So quickly in fact that only half of our party caught what he had actually said ... ""a fresh salmon"" something, something ""served with French fries and broccoli and our soup is broccoli cheese"".  With that he told us he would let us look at the menu and return shortly to take our drink orders, and he disappeared again.  We had already waited so long that many of us had already memorized the catalog-sized menu. Meanwhile the young lady with the pitcher of ice water returned yet again to refill our glasses.  This routine was getting to be pretty comical.  Finally our waiter returned, cheerful as ever and asked if we were ready to order our drinks.  Several members of our party suggested he take the entree orders also, and our waiter seemed quite surprised that we were ready to do both tasks simultaneously.  He took our orders, quite carefully in fact, jotting down each little detail as a couple of members from our party were meticulous about what they wanted in their drink and/or on their entree.   The wait for our drinks took forever, and our waiter returned with a pitcher of ice water to refill our glasses.  He apologized for the wait and even brought us two more baskets of the fresh baked bread.  A short time later our drinks finally arrived, and we finally got a chance to make a toast to a successful Icer Air event and all of the different accomplishments related to that event.   Only one member of our party ordered salad to go with his dinner, and it arrived shortly after the drinks arrived.  The rest of us sat back and noticed the gargantuan portion of salad on his plate which he devoured quickly.  No sooner had he set down his fork when an army of four or five different servers brought out our entrees.  Every plate looked massive in proportion and delicious in presentation. I ordered the Chicken Madeira which is two pieces of chicken breast topped with soft and gooey mozzarella cheese and covered in a slightly sweetened brown sauce with big chunks of mushrooms and whole spears of fresh asparagus.  I believe it is a single chicken breast cut into two halves.  The chicken was quite moist and the sauce was flavorful.  This came with a gigantic scoop of red-skinned mashed potatoes that was so incredibly large I had trouble finishing it. As our waiter returned to remove each half-eaten plate from our table we contemplated whether or not to order dessert.  Six of our party did so ordering a variety of cheesecake slices from the plain Original to the Fresh Strawberry, the Key Lime, the White Chocolate Caramel Latte and the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple.  Although each slice was passed around the table I didn't sample any of the other selections, but my strawberry cheesecake was rich and delicious, an original slice of cheesecake with several fresh strawberries and sweet glaze.  Two dollops of plain whipped cream accompanied each cheesecake slice.  The only thing missing was a cup of hot tea or hot coffee.  Neither was offered. The overall service is spotty and not consistent at all times, and the restaurant is continuously busy, but the tasty food is served hot often on heated plates and the desserts are rich and decadent.  You probably won't find me eating here too often, but I think our overall experience deserves at least 3.5 stars."
Eric D.,"Santa Barbara, United States",39,7,1,1.0,9/1/2012,I have never gotten food poisoning (at least anywhere outside of South Korea) until Jan 1st 2012 at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco.  Ate a late brunch at the bar while watching football games.  Was in bed for three days.!   I generally avoid chain restaurants but have eaten at these a few times and thought they were just ok.  Be careful with this one!
Amanda R.,"San Francisco, United States",92,162,4,4.0,5/2/2013,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory multiple times, and they have always been on their game. On the most recent visit, we were in a time crunch because we had to get to a show in an hour, and our servers were very accommodating and helped us get in and out. I love that they have the Skinnylicious menu now, although I don't see how those portions could really only have 600 calories or less. I'll take it though if that's really the case. I get something different every time, but my food has always been good. I love that you can get Italian, Mexican, and Asian food all in one restaurant. It's not going to be gourmet or perfect cuisine, but it does the job. I of course love the cheesecake too, but I try to abstain whenever I have the willpower."
Ron Z.,"Daly City, United States",159,206,932,4.0,5/2/2010,"If you're really hungry and want something filling, and you want to eat in nice, clean surroundings, you should check this place out. It's in the MACY's building in Union Square, and the views from the window seats are gorgeous. The food is you're standard American selection. Lots of baked and fried goods, salads, and burgers. The only standouts for me were the Orange Chicken, and the Caramel Chicken. These are the only things I order now when I eat here. And the cheesecake is still the best I've ever had (no matter what flavor you get). Still a bit pricey for me, but always fun."
Sean O.,"Daly City, United States",63,183,58,5.0,7/4/2010,"I don't think anyone really needs a review on The Cheesecake Factory.  It is what it is.  For what it is, though, it's pretty outstanding.  The menu is extensive and is certain to have something for everyone and everything is tasty, too.  The crowds can be super annoying, but we went at 10:30, put our name in then did some shopping.  We were seated promptly at 11 am.  This seems to be the way to go if you have a hankering for cheesecake. If found the service there to be excellent.  Everyone was really nice.  I really don't see anything wrong with liking a chain restaurant or admitting the food is good."
