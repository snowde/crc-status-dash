Fergal C.,"Oakland, United States",0,7,,1.0,30/7/2012,The service and food were excellent until the point that I found a hair in the batter of my calamari. Whilst two of the staff were apologetic my bill did not reflect this terrible finding. Surely they would have not charged me for the calamari or taken something off the total price? Clearly there is such a throughput in this restaurant that they did not need my custom. I look the same as every other tourist! Terrible treatment to tourists paying top dollar for the food. Also the greeters at the front entrance were unfriendly and shoved a pager in my hand without any consideration. Overall - avoid this restaurant at all costs.
Jose T.,"Chandler, United States",48,198,282,1.0,27/8/2010,"4. ^^^ Yeah.. within a span of 6 years, that's the number of times I have ATTEMPTED to dine at The Cheesecake Factory. I said attempted because whenever I've been invited/forced to go there by a friend or acquaintance, we usually just end up at the bar.  We'd hang out there having drinks, and before you know it, it's 3 hours later and you're too drunk to eat.  Five times, we just gave up and ate elsewhere. I admit that one time, we were part of a large party, and we did attempt to see this thing through to the end.  (It was about a 3.5 hour wait.)  We were already tipsy when they sat us.  Have you ever been inebriated while attempting to pick what you wanted to eat from a Cheesecake Factory menu?  It's no easy task.  I remember ordering something and I didn't even eat it there.  I just had them pack it up, as I had already passed my hunger stage. It might have been easier and less time consuming for me to hunt down an animal, butcher it, and cook it myself."
Jackie T.,"San Diego, United States",72,276,73,3.0,21/12/2012,Suuuppppeeeeerr crowded. I'm not sure I would ever try to sit down and have a full meal here. I do enjoy getting their infamous cheesecakes to go though. Most of their cheesecakes are too rich for me. My favorite might just be the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.
Amy L.,"San Francisco, United States",193,510,555,4.0,7/2/2007,"PROS:  Tasty food, HUGE portions for the price, great location (you can shop while you wait for your table), and the view from the outdoor balcony is spectacular (unless you are one of those weird people who hate architecture and cities), AMAZING Godiva cheesecake! CONS:  Long waits, understaffed (I assume, because service is slow), evil addictive cheesecake has enough calories to feed both Olsen Twins for a lifetime. But, I'm a sentimental fool, and love this place despite the cons.  Besides, the leftovers taste even better the next day for breakfast...and lunch....and dinner!!!  (Yes, by this, I DO mean to imply that you get a huge amount of food for the $)"
Joshua C.,"Oakland, United States",80,359,11,3.0,15/11/2010,"I know, I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. I don't eat here often, but when I do, it's always a great experience. Friendly staff, plenty of food options and yummy cheesecake.  I had Sunday brunch here with some friends for a birthday celebration. The wait wasn't long and they seated us even though two people were running late. My food was actually really good (Crab hash) although the poached eggs were a little overcooked. The hollandaise sauce was scrumptious and I cleaned my whole plate. I was the only one leaving without leftovers.  We were there for a couple hours, never rushed by the staff and they were very attentive and pleasant during the whole experience. It's a chain, but they are very consistent with their food and service, so I can't complain.  Go early on a Sunday morning for brunch and beat the crowds. Also, if it's in season, the pumpkin cheesecake is the bomb."
Angela N.,"Oakland, United States",297,187,31,4.0,8/12/2009,"I rolled through here last night instead of waiting in line at the Yelp Unwrapped party.  We got there and were told it would be a 35 minute wait.  Not too shabby considering how full the streets were with holiday shoppers. My girl and I cozied up to the bar for drink while we waited.  We quickly downed our first round to chase away the chill the 45 minutes we'd been waiting in line had already instilled in our limbs.  I had just ordered my second mojito when our pager went off...23 minutes. Awesome. The service was prompt and she could tell we weren't there to mingle for too long.  We placed our orders and had our food in about 15 minutes.  The food itself is decent...better than most chain-style restaurants.  I had the Shepards pie and really enjoyed it.  Perfect comfort food for the chilly evening.  My friend had the chicken and biscuits...and although she said it was good...it wasn't something she'd likely order again...too heavy and creamy. We topped off our meal by sharing a piece of peanut butter fudge cheescake.  It was ok.  Very rich and very sweet.  I had a few bites, but really, when it comes to cheesecake, I'm a minimalist.  I like it plain and MAYBE some strawberries or blueberries on top. We were out the door and headed back to the Westin for Yelp unwrapped in an hour. All in all, the view is spectacular and you can't beat the location.  That's really the best reason anyone would eat there anyway, right? =)"
Michelle Y.,"Daly City, United States",32,184,,4.0,21/2/2010,I've been here oodles of times...They have a fabulous variety of dishes to choose from. Recommendations would be Luau Salad (my absolute favorite)...Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp...Crab Cake Sandwich...and DO NOT forget about the cheesecake...Godiva...Mmmmm.... Reasonable prices too and huge proportions!
Cassandra J.,"San Francisco, United States",82,523,12,4.0,17/1/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants that's a big chain so there's nothing overly special about them, has a lot of typical standard food that you can find elsewhere and usually better, but also manages to nail it just right on ""dear lord this is amazing"".  I've gone several times with coworkers and friends.  I can honestly say this is a great place to go with a few friends for a few drinks and desserts.  The cheesecake menu can't be beat and the drinks, while nothing to write home about, are decently priced and quite refreshing.  Getting a table on the balcony overlooking Union Square is the cherry on top for a great evening out. Be prepared for some nasty lineups and waits.  More often than not, the wait is at least 20 to 30 minutes, unless you have reservations.  This place is also extremely busy and chaotic.  Every time I've gone, it's jam packed.  The dishes are also really large so expect to bring home leftovers (the waiters warn you of this). I almost always get pasta or pizza dishes while I'm here.  I'd like to say I've never been disappointed, but if you go to a chain restaurant often enough you're going to get hit with a dud at least once.  My most recent trip was served with an overcooked fettuccine dish that just didn't taste good at all.  I did make up for it with the Macaroni and Cheese Ball appetizer, which alone makes it worth going to, along with a Reese Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake! Prices are decent, but can run a bit high if you're not careful.  If you have time to spare and enjoy a very large menu with a wide range of dishes, as well as some delicious cheesecake at the end, this is the place to go."
Rebecca S.,"San Francisco, United States",276,372,26,4.0,22/12/2009,"'Cheesy Cheesecake' is a tourist spot, but it's a great place to come after a date to get a drink, something sweet, and to check out one of the best views along Union Square until late. Get your drink at the bar and take it out to the patio. The view is worth sticking it out in the cold. GOTTA TRY my *fav* dessert: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake!! If you are a coconut fan, this is a *must*. It's got layers of chocolate cake, brownie, coconut & pecan frosting, with** the best** part: a huge layer of creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake right in the middle. Insane!!!"
Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, United States",708,1463,1718,3.0,27/7/2007,"Aside from the ridiculously long wait time, there are three things that bother me about the Cheesecake Factory in SF: 1) The menu is like a Macy's catalog. How can you focus on the gazillion choices of food when you are distracted by the advertisements? Who wants to get sliders when there's a 2 carat ring blinging in your eye? Why salivate over chicken madeira when you can drool over a man in a 3 piece suit? And why even think of dessert when designer purses serve as eye candy? I don't know any other restaurant that sells ad space in their menus. It's quite distracting. Effective? To a certain degree. Annoying? Yes. 2) I don't like pigeons pecking at my toes or swooping down to snag bread and bite size pieces off of my plate. Are the Alfred Hitchcock moments worth the breathtaking view from the top of the Macy's building looking down onto the square? Yes. 3) As cute and cuddly as those beanie babies were in the nineties, the nineties are over!! I don't want to stare at beanie babies when I ogle the cheesecake counter. What I do like about the Cheesecake Factory is the appetizer favorites. It's got the best of everything on 4 plates. They may have bumped up the price but it's still worth it if you are sharing it for a meal. As for the cheesecake, it's good (you can also get a cheesecake sampler from Costco on the cheap) and they have every flavor imaginable. I like their cheesecake but i will always gravitate towards the caramel apple dumpling before getting my own 5 lb slice of fat."
Albert S.,"Union City, United States",0,15,,2.0,5/9/2010,"On top of Macy. I gave management a piece of me. The worst wait time, I ever had. The food was cold when I got it. They should told of the wait time,2 hours wait time.They should of told me what wait willI be, I will wait or stay loyal customer and be back..  I got a $50 refund from management. I used it on Palo Alto Cheese Cake Factory. Wait  time non-existentand food better."
Tan H.,"San Jose, United States",0,33,,4.0,1/7/2013,"I dont know why they call it a cheesecake factory if they make BURGERS,FRIES,AND THE CHEESECAKE SO DELICIOUS! i will definitely come back for more"
Andrew S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,2.0,26/11/2014,"I ordered a medium rare burger.  It was over-cooked, overpriced, and under-sized.  Glitzy setting with mediocre chain restaurant food."
Amy L.,"Lake Forest, United States",331,377,286,3.0,3/10/2010,"Love how its right by the mall, but the food is just okay. I definitely go to cheesecake factory more for their desserts and cheesecakes as oppose to their food. There appetizers may actually taste better than their actual dishes. Cheesecake factory has a myriad of tastes and choices, you can get something Asian inspired to Italian pasta.  I love their avocado eggrolls, its definitely enough for lunch if you want something light.  Dishes: jambalaya pasta: disappointing. I ordered this and there was no sauce on it. It was dry, they put sundried tomatoe in it and it was still hard and inedible.  They do however, give a good portion for a good price. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends who has different tastes and preferences. This is always out default restaurant when we can't make a decision."
Ryan V.,"San Francisco, United States",213,201,13,3.0,28/11/2009,"My first encounter with a Cheesecake Factory was a sign of things to come. No, literally it was a sign. The night was dark, and I looked up at their lit sign to find the 'c' in 'Factory' was burnt out and it appeared to be called 'Cheesecake Fatory' And I should have heeded the sign's warning. After a day of stressful shopping on Black Friday, almost anything will please my appetite so I thought what the hell, I will try this place. The result was mediocre food in which each bite was probably 100 calories, and there were many bites.  The service was pretty good actually considering the circumstances. After getting rained on outside our server personally made sure we got to a seat inside as quickly as possible without being unaccounted for. I then resumed my 100-calorie bites and promptly passed out from salt overload when I got home."
J P.,"Minneapolis, United States",0,9,,4.0,29/6/2012,Good Restaurant and super good service. I got there on prime time about 7PM on Friday evening and they still got is a table fairly quickly and the server was good as well. She stopped by many times to see how we were doing and if we need anything. Food was on time and was good. They need to reduce there prices though; for 2 people we ended up spending about $70 for just dinner and one drink. Its expensive but good location and good service.
CoCo V.,"Alameda, United States",92,72,23,3.0,20/11/2010,"**3.5 Stars, so I'm a fan =) The decor and large menu is good enough for me. I like coming here with friends and family for a casual dinner.  Everyone always can find something they like since the menu is endless. Which i don't mind =) Most of the time, there is always a wait. Which is expected if you've been here before, so I always try and prepare myself to wait at least an hour. Service is really good most of the time. Occasionally there might be a slow or not very helpful waiter or waitress, but not too often.  Some of my favorite dishes are the Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich, OMG...really good! HUGEEE, but soo good! The Jambalaya Fettuccine is great also, but instead of the pasta noodles, get it with rice and extra sauce on the side, you will NOT be disappointed. And I always start off with their fried Zuccinni and Tuna Tartare small plate. So if you like tons of options and cheesecake? This is the place to visit! =)"
Crystal M.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,3.0,21/8/2013,"Wait time was extremely long for this Cheese Cake. Once we got our seats, it took the server long to get to our table. Once he got to our table to get drink menus, he walked away before we can even tell him we actually know what order. Throughout the night it was a look out to find our server. Food was okay, service was okay, hence, 3 stars."
Katherine A.,"Honolulu, United States",137,128,245,4.0,19/11/2010,"What kind of crazy tourist goes to Cheesecake Factory for dinner when there are a handful back home in and around Los Angeles? Me. Well, I was sold when I found out it was on top of a Macy's. Took the elevator up and they asked me whether I wanted indoor or outdoor seating. Wait outdoor? Yes, there is amazing view of Union Square when you decide to eat outdoors. I'm a sucker for amazing views and that sold me. Service was great, ain't complaining there. I think I'll be coming here more often when I'm up here in SF just for the view. I love Cheesecake Factory anyways so its a win for me!"
Sarah S.,"Kailua-Kona, United States",53,63,,3.0,4/2/2011,Epic amounts of food..  4 meals worth.......  The cheesecake was ok..  Someplace I'd go with a group of people who were low on cash.  :) View from the balcony is lovely..
