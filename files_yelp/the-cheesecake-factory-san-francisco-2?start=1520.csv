Jennifer J.,"San Francisco, United States",371,204,159,4.0,28/2/2012,"Love this place, although the wait is ridiculous. However, on a nice day, definitely wait for an outdoor table. The view of the city is absolutely amazing and it's a good place for date lunch/brunch. Not recommended for huge groups (pricing AND wait) although the food is quite delicious (I've had good experiences at MOST Cheesecake Factories)"
Norm G.,"Antioch, United States",32,23,,5.0,25/7/2010,"Located on the 8th floor of Macy*s women store in Union Square. You are greeted at the main entrance which you are greeted by a worker and one elevator which is a con because it is always packed.       After reaching the 8th floor you are greeted by nicely decorated restaurant with warm decor. Me and my party was greeted by a very courteous staff at the front desk who told us that our wait would be a hour. While we waited very good selection of music was played and the bar was packed'     After waiting less than a hour we where seated and greeted buy a great Waiter and servers who answers and  fulfilled  any questions or task asked. The menu Selection.. In one word seem endless option's and such wide selection of food from hamburgers to orange chicken.    Last but not least just a huge variety of cheesecakes and other deserts but why get another type of desert? This is the Cheesecake factory from Kahlua cheesecake from the best to me which is Red Velvet Cheesecake. In the end prices are mid level but you get a huge selection of  food, a excellent view of the city and much more."
Dee A.,"Union City, United States",42,97,71,3.0,24/7/2012,"Located on the top floor of Macy's.  This location has a outdoor patio seating with the nice view of the city.  The wait time is ridiculously long at this Cheesecake Factory but it's worth it.  The food is great, the portions are huge, and they have the best wheat bread made fresh daily.   Chicken croquettes, and chicken samosa is my all time favorite at cheesecake.  Try it with ranch and tamerind cashew sauce!!"
Shamiya M.,"San Francisco, United States",7,31,2,2.0,13/5/2012,"I love going to this place because their four cheese pasta is amazing. The service has always been great. I go there knowing it will be a long wait and when I am finally seated, the servers are usually on top of their game. I went recently with my family on Mother's Day and had a crappy experience. Our server Ciarra was a little slow  and even messed up an order, but I understood that it was a holiday so I let that go. When it was time to pay for our bill we gave her part cash and part credit card. When I got the credit card statement back things didn't add up. We were missing $20! We told Ciarra and she claimed we didn't give it to her and pulled out random cash and said that is what we gave her. She was totally lying and probably stole the cash or let the cash fall out.  She totally ruined our day and my family's experience at the Cheesecake Factory."
Johnson B.,"Oakland, United States",44,103,114,3.0,15/12/2009,Came here after the Yelp Holiday Party...we didn't realize the wait or crappy service because we were too drunk. The best thing on the appetizer sampler is the avocado wrap and the chicken carbonera is the best pasta.  We had the salmon which was dry so we had to dip into my best friend's plate.
Ivan F.,"San Francisco, United States",38,98,6,5.0,8/4/2010,"After eating somewhere regulary, especially if it's a chain, I somewhat forget to review my experience. The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places. I ate there this week to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend. Couple things about this particular site is that it's centralized in the heart of San Francisco. A ""tourist trap"", if you will. Now, I'd have to disagree about the ""trap"" part because locals frequent this spot just as much as visiting tourists do. Everytime I eat at the The Cheesecake Factory I usually order one of 2 things. Either the Chcken Madeira (which comes with some bombass mashed potatoes) or the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms and some bowtie pasta served just the perfect way, between al dente and done. This time around, I had the Marsala and my homegirl tried the Madeira (my recommendation). She loved it and since my dish looked good, she picked at my plate, tried it and loved it! Since the joint is known for it's namesake, we made sure to make room for what else? Cheesecake. I ain't gonna front, the cheesecake that makes my tummy happier than anything is the dulce de leche. Can't go wrong. The waiter tried to entice me with the red velvet cheesecake so my homegirl had that and decided to pick at mine, again. Of course I didn't mind because it was her birthday. A couple things about this joint: I really dig the fact that they're open as late as 11pm on weekdays and 12:30a on weekends and there's always alot of people.  Oh and by the way, I suggest you sit outside and enjoy the ambience...especially on a nice day."
Joe C.,"Newport Beach, United States",14,172,,4.0,23/1/2013,"Prepare to wait if you go around lunch time. I ordered the ""Seared Tuna Tataki Salad"". The salad and tuna are very delicious. My friend ordered the ""Grilled Rib-Eye Steak"" and it was great tasting as well. We really enjoyed our lunch here. I understand how people are complaining about the pigeons walking/flying around, but that's the joy of nature and sitting outside. Will definitely return. :)"
Roberto B.,"Montreal, Canada",3,7,,3.0,16/4/2011,"Went there with my missus while shopping for a couch at Macy's. The place was (very) nice, staff was friendly, and it didn't take us much time to find a place to sit by the bar. Food, though, was another story. It's one of those places that looks much better than what it actually is. My better half had the classic hamburger with salad. Of course I tried it (being an avid meat-eater), so I'd rate it 6/10. The meat was OK, the bun felt a bit cheap.... the pickles were great, though. My hamburger (a cheeseburger) was another story... It was served cut in half (!?) in a baguette-like piece of bread (I am assuming it was the way it was meant to be, but if that was the case, why changing something that worked fine?); the cheese was not completely melted, and the bread felt like if it was from the day before. And worse, the meat was less than satisfying. I'm giving the place 3 stars for the venue, and not for the food. So far, a hamburger at Pearl's is still the top-in-class. R."
P K.,"Redwood City, United States",1,33,,3.0,6/6/2011,"Super busy location for this Cheesecake Factory so be prepared to pay for parking and wait for a table or even a bar seat. I  ate here a few times but took a date here before and had to do a u turn when I stepped out of the elevator after I saw how busy it was.  With that aside, when you do get to sit down, the view is awesome and the food is quite tasty. I also remember them for having really great mixed drinks like Mai Tai's.  Make sure you blind fold your date on the way down since this Cheesecake Factory is located on top of a 7 story Macy's and if you had any money left over from dinner you definitely won't by the time you exit the building."
Eve C.,"Manhattan, United States",293,845,439,3.0,23/8/2010,Slightly hesitant to come here considering my last experience at the one in SJ. There's not much to say but that you won't get any surprises with your order. They offer a book as their menu so a plus side is that everyone should be able to find something they like. This location is nicer because if you sit outside you can overlook Union Square. Wouldn't be my first choice but it's a good one when you have a larger party.
Patrick M.,"Escondido, United States",11,9,,2.0,15/4/2011,"a huge menu. Normally I know exactly what I want within a minute of receiving the menu... but this one took FOREVER to weed out my meal for the evening.... everything sounded so good! Emphasis on ""sounded."" The biggest downside was the wait, but that's to be expected on a Saturday evening during the Christmas season. The cheesecake was too ""mushy"" for my taste. And I'm no Cheesecake elitest... if it's cheesecake, it's going in my mouth in copious amounts! It was a ""meh"" experience overall. We had gift cards, which brightened the experience a bit, but the long wait and so-so food (especially the dessert... I mean C'MON! how are you gonna mess up cheesecake when it's IN YOUR NAME!?!?!?) brought the night down a bit.  I've experienced Cheesecake factory. I'm not convinced it's something I'll ever feel compelled to do so again"
Ana G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,5.0,4/8/2013,This place is great. Portions are huge and one plate serves two. The customer service is great and the variety of cheesecakes is amazing. I will def be returning great place for dinner with family or friends. The variety of food selections is great also recommend it.
Dee C.,"Salinas, United States",1,14,,2.0,3/8/2014,"The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the ridiculously LONG wait times and crappy customer service! The food is really good but everything else sucks!     Visited this place yesterday at about 8:00 pm and did not get seated until 10:00pm!!! I tried to make reservations but was told they do not make reservations. Decided to wait because the last time I was here, I enjoyed the food but was in a hurry to catch the baseball game so I couldn't have some cheesecake. The lady at the check in was quite rude! I was with a party of eight and was told it would be a wait which we expected. She couldn't accommodate such a large party which I find ridiculous and she couldn't guarantee we could sit together!! There was also a man in a suit walking around (manager? I don't know) he was extremely rude. We asked him for a menu to look at food choices and he said to go get it in the front and he walks away! Then we set down the menu and he takes it without asking if we were done looking at it. As he's walking away we said ""excuse me sir, we are not done with that!"" He continues on his merry way! After 2 hours, we finally get seated and that was a problem because they wanted to split up our group and sit us on opposite sides of the restaurant!!! They ended up sitting us together but it was after my husband got loud.  We sat down and didn't have enough utensils, no bread, no drinks. It took about 30 minutes to order our food! The waitress was very nice but everyone else in that place that we encountered was rude! The food though was great as was the cheesecake!"
Jason F.,"Vacaville, United States",4,32,9,4.0,19/2/2013,"1500+ reviews ,so it's not hard to see this place is popular. Eat outside at night ,they have heaters. Great view of Union Square and downtown area. I had the pork chops and they were better than average. Great list of desserts and of course cheesecake of all varieties . Nice friendly staff."
Vanessa M.,"San Francisco, United States",103,5,7,1.0,18/9/2014,"The food is good here....but the service is poor.  very poor!!!  We'd been waiting for over an hr to be seated....when we finally brought our timer up and asked which order we were in and how long did they think  the wait would be now?  The manager, I believe his name is Matt Fiskum, was brought to us as other people who were obviously behind us on the list were being seated.  We had gone downstairs with the timer to get a drink at another bar in the meantime but had never been beeped we explained.  He said we were still on the list and that we'd just have to wait.  just like that.  We asked why the people who were behind us on the list were currently being seated.  He denied this and continued seating them..telling us he couldn't do anything to help us.  We both got upset at this point and he still would not do anything to help us.  We ended up just leaving without eating!!!  What happened to..the customer is always right.....or even just...""I'm so sorry for the inconvenience...let me get you seated right away.""  My God....this manager is definitely not setting a good example for the other employees!!!"
Christine T.,"San Jose, United States",656,197,89,4.0,6/12/2009,"Slippery floors, cramped elevators, and second hand smoke.. this is what a typical dining experience in San Francisco should consist of! A 20 minute wait for a over crowded pasta place you surely can have at any ol' busy city. But what makes this one so special is the amazing view and their amazing service. Not to mention their amazing food that seems to always be exactly perfect. I don't know how to exactly describe an experience here since each time coming here is quite different and adventure. But if you're one for a great view of Union Square or even shopping till your feet go numb from the SF weather, this Cheese Cake Factory is open latteeeee. Just perfect for a nice relaxing sit down dinner before the long trip home (if you're a tourist)."
Liberty C.,"San Francisco, United States",6,61,1,3.0,6/1/2011,"I use to want Cheesecake Factory alllll the time, then I don't know what happened. I guess I grew out of that phase, but occasionally I do crave for their pastas. The wait here is ridiculous, it can vary between 30 mins to hours, and it also depends on the number of people for your party. I can see people going here for special occasions but on a daily basis, it gets expensive! Although their cheesecake is sooooo good. The food portions are okay as well as the desserts but some are really sweet.  The service is good though, compared to most high end restaurants. I'm not sure if anything changed from the last time I went, but for some reason I'm thinking, I should go back to refresh my memory someday."
EmmettsGuRL C.,"Daly City, United States",112,103,494,5.0,28/8/2010,Love the view. Love the salmon. Love the key lime cheesecake. Love the cocktails. Been meaning to try the tiramisu. But expect to wait...... a long time
Ivadine M.,"San Jose, United States",188,89,1,3.0,18/10/2012,"I guess you have to go on a non-busy day to get a friendly service here. I took my friend out for his birthday here, told our waiter that it was his birthday, all he said was ""okay"" he did surprise us with a cake and a candle, but can you show more enthusiasm? Over all, it was okay.. I wouldn't mind coming back, but it would have to be weekday."
Wendy H.,"San Francisco, United States",104,1308,331,4.0,27/6/2006,"This is what I always order when I go to the Cheesecake Factory: 1) Chicken Marsala -- the best I've tasted at chain restaurants! 2)  Fresh squeeze Lemonade -- better than the fountain crap you get at other restaurants 3) cheesecake -anyone would do.  It's that good! Deducted a star for the service which is non-existent!  I know why there's always people waiting out front to be seated.  It's because they don't seat them right away.  This is a dirty restaurant secret of creating an ""illusion"" that the place is busy and to make you think that ""wow, I stumbled upon the mother of all restaurants!""   In reality, they're holding back on seating people.  I went once at 11:00 and they still made us wait a good 15 minutes w/ the other peeps.  When we got seated, I noticed that the dining room was only half way filled.  Not cool..."
