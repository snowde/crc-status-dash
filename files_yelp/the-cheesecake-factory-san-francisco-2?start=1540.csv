Adrienne G.,"San Francisco, United States",124,2310,2218,3.0,19/9/2007,"This place is ALWAYS crowded & it's like this all over the freaking country!  I have never walked past a Cheesecake Factory when there haven't been swarms upon swarms of people, waiting to be seated.....the business minds behind this establishment are absolute geniuses & definitely bizillionaries.  Why didn't I think of it first?! With only mediocre food to boast, the 2 reasons to come here are the AVOCADO EGG ROLLS & CHEESECAKE And if you're NOT a tourist, my suggestion is....get it To-Go or you'll have road rage from all the foot traffic.  WHO in their right mind would bumble around 100s of people, waiting well over an hour to eat here.....they'd have to be CRAZY! (Tourists should definitely experience this part of the madness that is Union Square.) Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Cookie-Dough Cheesecake is DA BOMB & the main reason I continue to experience the madness again & again.....and will continue to do so!  White-Chocolate-Macadamia-Nut is another fav.  Their Pumpkin Cheesecake is seasonal & worth a venture into the chaos..... .....but again, only long enough to grab the To-Go container....I'm not crazy enough to actually wait around to eat here!"
S. D.,"San Francisco, United States",28,43,32,3.0,15/10/2010,"It's just one of those places you have to go eat at when you're visiting Union Square. I like coming to Cheesecake for the view of the square below. Day or night, it's always nice looking down from atop the restaurant at the people below. There's always something interesting going on.   Cheescake there is pretty yummy. Aside from the wide selection of cheesecake, there is a lot on their menu to choose from. I mean A LOT of choices. Portions are always gargantuan so keep that in mind when ordering. I always overestimate how much I'll eat and I never get past a few bites when I get to the cheesecake.  I guess that's fine because then I have something to give to all the homeless begging for food in front. That being said, the food there isn't all that great. I came one time with an out of town guest and we were served hard undercooked pasta.  The management apologized and got us another plate. The food at the Cheesecake in Valleyfair Westfield is better.  But, like I said, view is good, portions are big, and there is a big menu."
Jackie T.,"San Francisco, United States",60,67,53,2.0,14/11/2009,"If you're going to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, don't even bother with any of the other locations. This is the only one worth indulging 3000 calories at - for the view ALONE. You can't beat the view of Union Square from 8 stories high on a warm San Francisco day (after the 2 hour wait, that is).  Food is mediocre. Although the complimentary bread is always soft and warm. Cheesecake is divine. (Most contain nuts, but the red velvet does not!) They've suddenly posted the calorie content per cheesecake slice and that makes me feel guilty, depressed, fat, and sad all at the same time :/ Oh well, nothing else to do except drown my sorrows in more cheesecake! My advice: Skip the food. Order a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go. And people watch as you pig out while sitting on the steps of Union Square :)"
Betty L.,"Vancouver, Canada",60,164,,4.0,25/8/2010,"Even though I was never a fan of American chains, I was pleasantly surprised by The Cheesecake Factory.  After a long day of shopping at Union Square, I was  really hungry and tired.  I didn't have to wait long for a table.  The server was really nice and friendly.  Portions were huge.  I went with two other people.  When we saw the huge portions we decided two order two dishes for sharing.  The oriental chicken salad was pretty good because the sauce was light and refreshing.  It didn't make the rest of the salad soggy.  There were lots of greens and chicken.  Too bad they added a lot of the fried tortilla like chikps on top.  The guacamole was pretty good too.  The avacados were fresh and had a good tartness to it.  Like we requested, it was spicy.   However I found the mojito to be a bit too sweet and not enough limes in there.  Yet once again it was a  huge drink. Overall it's a good place for a quick bite after a looong day of retail therapy."
Elena N.,"San Francisco, United States",1406,2423,10560,4.0,28/7/2008,"This is one of my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations.  It's on top of Macy's so it's got a great view of Union Square.  The wait at this location can suck from time to time.  I'd say on average, I've had to wait 45 minutes.  If you can, sit at a table by the bar.  They have the same menu and you don't have to wait.  I love the grey goose martinis here and last time, I got the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls.  They were so good!  And of course you have to try the cheesecake!  Just remember the portion is big so you many want to share with a friend."
Domo H.,"Phoenix, United States",126,45,81,5.0,19/3/2013,"Our waiter, didn't catch his name, was awesome. He took good care of us. I imagine he had a large section so sometimes it was a while before we saw him, but it was okay.. His friendly smile made up for that. The food is the same, no matter which factory we go to (amazing). I appreciate their consistency. Yes, they're a bit busy (long wait, etc) but that's a sign of a good restaurant, in my opinion. For the portions that you get the prices are really good! The drinks are where they getcha!"
Moe A.,"Beverly Hills, United States",335,193,46,1.0,27/10/2011,I don't like pigeons stealing my food. What a joke
Ladi Da A.,"San Francisco, United States",661,494,194,4.0,4/2/2007,"I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! However, the one in the City is kind of dark and feels a little more stuffy than the others.  It's too crowded due to it's location, too. I would recommend going to the other Cheesecake Factories located away from downtown.  There is a nice one in Corta Madera (I used to work in the area).  The one at Valley Fair in San Jose can get busy, but for some reason the food tastes better.  I've also been to the one in Palo Alto (parking sucks).  I thought I heard about them building another one around Burlingame or Daly City...can't wait!"
Karen M.,"Oakland, United States",98,644,488,5.0,5/10/2010,"Likes: good food each time I've eaten here, love the cheesecakes and variety. Dislikes: the long LONG wait!"
Jane M.,"Santa Rosa, United States",23,77,,3.0,20/12/2010,Went for a Holiday Luncheon and was seated with a group of 8 within 15 minutes. Food took forever and was average.Would I go back???I don't think so waitress was a little to perky for me LOL
Annie S.,"San Francisco, United States",106,332,512,4.0,3/10/2008,"I've always wanted to come here and I finally had the chance to! The downside: a 40 minute wait. I ordered the luau salad (lunch portion $10) and it was freakin' delicious. I would totally order it again. I also tried some of my friend's Thai Chicken Pasta. (lunch $10) That was really really good, too. I also tried some Chicken Piccata (lunch $10)... that was alright. Not my favorite. But the best of show goes to the cheesecake. White chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. TO DIE FOR, LITERALLY...."
Brenda C.,"Fullerton, United States",691,260,15,5.0,17/3/2010,"This review is STRICTLY for their side dish of MAC & CHEESE. I've been here numerous times and I've usually stuck with the same stuff (grilled salom, garlic pasta, or chicken & biscuits). However, I wasn't very fond of the mash potatos so I requested a substitution. The server started naming side dishes "" blah blah blah MAC & CHEESE. bllll""  ""WAITTTT  .. did you just say mac & cheese. SOLD"" let me describe it to you, as I start drooling. MAC & SUPER EXTRA CHEESE baked to perfection topped off  with a dash of bread crumbs. As you dig into the melty dish, strings of cheese will cling onto your fork. The warm heavy cheese will melt in your mouth and bring you to Nirvana.  I'm not even lying. PS - Also, try their red velvet cheesecake. Absolutely EFFIN' delicious. Howeverrr,  one slice is 1500 + calories =[   .. BUT HECK .. its called ""CHEESE""CAKE FACTORY for a reason! Eat on!"
Yuri E.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,3,1.0,27/4/2013,"Cheesecake Factory has always seemed to be a great place for a special occasion, however, our experience was terrible! My friends and I decided to celebrate my birthday on a Saturday knowing that it was going to be extremely busy we went ahead and put our name in for reservations at 5:15pm.  We didnt get seated until 845pm! The hostess excuse and reasoning behind their delay was due to them being extremely busy! No empathy or any way of saying sorry!!!!!"
Deborah C.,"San Francisco, United States",181,173,282,4.0,18/3/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has wonderful cocktails and appetizers/snacks!!! After spending hours at school doing projects, my friends and I stopped by around 10:30P.M on a weekday knowing we need some good food and a nice drink. As we get off the elevator, hosts were very welcoming and notified us immediately that we can take our time eating/drinking even though they close at 11P.M. (Side Note:  Enter restaurant before closing time) (1 star...DING!)  We found seats at the bar area.  We settled ourselves on the high chairs and a tall strapping male waiter comes by to check on us. He asked what we wanted to drink and we told him we need a few minutes.  He understood and ventured off to get us water and complimentary bread. Yums!  (2 stars...DING!) He returns and asked us very friendly on what we wanted. Here are the wonderful goodies we ordered from the menu!  Cocktails  1)  Pineapple Mojito 2) Passion Fruit Mojito 3) Tropical Martini  Small plates & Snacks/Appetizer 1)  Margherita Pizza 2) Chicken Samosas 3) Avocado Eggrolls   The best part was that all the food and drinks came came out in less than 15 minutes!  Awesome!  (3 stars...DING!) After an hour of gulping and grubbing, we left with happy stomachs. We wanted more, but controlled ourselves. =P Overall, this was a very satisfying experience at Cheesecake Factory.  (4 stars...DING!) We are coming back here again! :D"
Alaric S.,"Walnut Creek, United States",22,74,542,4.0,4/11/2012,"The service will NEVER improve here. After coming here for years, the service has always been stagnant. Its best if you bring a date, or a small group of friends so that time passes by quicker. Tried the bbq chix pizza and had the coconut chocolate mousse cheesecake, twas bomb. There was an out of town couple that was courteous enough to let us order drinks at the bar, and as we were waiting, an asian couple sits down, NOT by the host, and takes over a couple who was getting ready to leave, and jumps ahead of everyone else who was going to wait 45-60 for a table. Had to give it a 4-star cuz, we were there til' late, not cause of the service, but my friends and I were catching up. Everyone had left when we were just getting started lol."
John L.,"Roseville, United States",0,17,,2.0,1/10/2014,"My wife and i met a couple of friends for lunch on 9/30/14. The wait time was almost nothing which was a shock. I expected at least 1 hour.  The waiter who seemed nice enough took our order and we were brought our drinks.  Our friend got up to greet my wife who arrived a bit later. As she got up, she knocked over a glass of wine. Another one was brought.  The wait time for the food was crazy. About 1 hour when the place was not that busy.  When the bill came I informed the waiter about possibly taking the 2nd glass of wine off the bill since it was accidentally knocked over.  After asking us if it was full when it was knocked over and we said yes, i could tell that he very reluctantly removed it from the bill.  Great food but the wait time to get the food is crazy."
Chris S.,"San Francisco, United States",240,102,9,5.0,20/6/2011,"Huge portions, lots of selection of dishes, reasonable price, stiff drinks, quality food and a kitchen that is open until 12- what is there not too love? I am sure that some of the other review here (didn't read them yet) talk about the crowd.   There are no reservations (for parties of 8 or more maybe they do?) so the wait can get bad.  I tend to go there for late eats (after 10PM) which there is never an issue.  Also, I eat at the bar area (where there are small table tops too) so I really have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.  Never had the cheesecake there I must admit - not my thing but I understand the red velvet is to die for. Average bill is under $25 with cocktails so I definitely give this a strong recommend."
Stephanie J.,"Walnut Creek, United States",17,154,,3.0,12/3/2010,"Cheesecake is always good and to make it into a restaurant and dessert place.. OMG. Yum. My favorite cheesecake here is the tiramisu and chocolate flavored ones. To die for! Heaven in cake form. When I get actual food here, I just usually order the calamari because it's amazing here. Super crunchy, perfectly fried and not chewy one bit. The waiters are always friendly. The bad thing about this location is that it gets damn crowded. Make reservations or go in the early afternoon."
Fannie S.,"San Francisco, United States",27,1813,108,3.0,18/1/2008,"Food = good, and sometimes great.   Dessert (esp. cheesecake) = below average. I only go here for dinners...hearty portions.  Good energy.  Nice view of the city, if you're outside or near the windows. Service is usually good.   Decent drinks.  Parking is a pain, and since it is in the Macy's...it can get really packed too."
Nat R.,"Martinez, United States",11,122,157,4.0,12/9/2010,"Dude, don't just dock off stars cuz the line is too long.  That's the thing, it is so popular that the wait is averages an hour. Their Louisiana Chicken Pasta is solid, and they always give you more than you can eat in one sitting. When you wait, they will ask if you want to eat outside or in.  Usually the wait is longer for indoor seating, since I guess folks are concerned it is too cold outside.  If you can, choose outside, at least for the unique dining experience.  There are heat lamps that will warm you and your significant other."
