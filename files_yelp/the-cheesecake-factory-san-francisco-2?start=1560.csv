Louisa L.,"Manhattan, United States",210,295,2,5.0,23/12/2009,"I don't care what other people say, about how it's totally over-rated...but I have to say that THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE RESTAURANT!  The prices are very decent, and they give you huuuge portions. So even if something is relatively pricey, u definitely get ur money's worth. Some of my favorite foods: +AVOCADO ROLLS: soooooooooo delicious, i order them EVERY time I come. I think it's the sauce that makes it taste so good, but I LOVE IT! +Spicy chicken chipotle pasta: i get this pretty much every time too. I'm a fan of spicy food, so I absolutely love this too! +CHEESECAKE CHEESECAKE and more CHEESECAKE! all are very delicious, but my favorites are probably the tuxedo, tirimisu, dulche de leche, white chocolate macademia nut, and new favorite red velvet cheesecake =P I come here whenever I want to celebrate something, or when I'm just happy. The wait IS very long....which is the downfall to this restaurant, but I like the union square cheesecake factory cuz the outside patio area is actually pretty nice if it's a warm night out =) u get a nice view of the square too."
Minch Z.,"Davis, United States",0,6,,2.0,11/6/2013,"In my opinion, ONLY come here for the cheesecake. Make a phone call and take it to go. It's the ONLY thing that worth it. You don't want to spend over an hour waiting in line and the food is overpriced."
Vicky L.,"Jersey City, United States",756,873,380,5.0,30/1/2006,"people, it's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY, just get the cheesecake!  You cannot go wrong with a slice of the WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE.  It is delicious and for that I give this place a 5!   For everything else, probably a 3, but again, it's called the CHEESECAKE FACTORY for a reason, people must have misread the sign to say ""PASTA FACTORY."""
Joc V.,"Oakland, United States",88,666,141,3.0,11/4/2006,"It's not THAT bad.    Sure it's middle America.  Sure it's the culmination of a tourist's culinary adventure.  But even Cheesecake Factory has its place in a food lover's heart.  I'll go if I get passed out-hungry after 6 floors of Macy's.  I'll even enjoy the flash fried salmon rolls and dulce de leche cheesecake.  I've had worse.  I'm sure our guests from foreign countries brag to all their friends back home about this place, especially those from 3rd world nations.  Because Cheesecake Factory is what the US of A is all about: EXCESS!"
Teri C.,"Las Vegas, United States",1629,1012,2245,3.0,1/9/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory does well simply because it's a chain.  They know what works well for the masses, and that's what keeps them busy.  Whenever you have a group, everyone is bound to find at least one thing they like off their huge menu.   Sure, the wait is forever long.  Yes, even an hour on weeknights.  But for some reason, I keep on coming back.  I had some great service there, and I had some bad. I usually LOVE the sourdough bread and can't get enough.  However, there was this one time where it just didn't taste the same and I was highly disappointed.  Most people really dig that dark bread though.   The portions are huge and us being Americans, we expect huge. We complain when the portions are too small, so at least at The Cheesecake Factory, you're paying for what you get. I've gone and ordered appetizers galore and had a feast.  Other times I just order an entree and never made it to dessert.  I've had friends rave about their cheesecake while others give the thumbs down on their other desserts. All in all, I'll keep on returning there.  It's crazy loud and maybe that's too much for some people.  But with that kind of energy, sometimes you want to just be a part of it all. If you don't want to wait, grab a seat by the bar.  Have a drink there too.  But of course, get some cheesecake!"
Stella C.,Hong Kong,293,659,271,4.0,13/11/2006,"You can always rely on The Cheesecake Factory. Love their cajun jambalaya pasta, macaroni-n-cheese balls and their brown bread! And let's not forget their namesake cheesecake selection, I can never choose which one I want. Portions are large, so always remember not to eat your whole meal and bring the rest home --- just so you can have room to share a slice of cheesecake. This is definitely a place where you pack on the calories, so come hungry and leave your diet at home.  The wait for a table is a pain. No reservations allowed the wait can be up to 3 hours.  Because of the wait, coming here for lunch is never an option. We can never seem to slip in and out of here within the lunch hour, which is unfortunate because we would certainly frequent this place much more often if it was more efficient. Come here if you have the time or if you really want to stroll around Macys for 3 hours. Great view of union square, but just be prepared to wait."
Hen A.,"San Mateo, United States",3007,3154,4803,3.0,31/10/2011,"sunday shopping stroll...dinner at macy's...above and at the sign...waiting for buzzer flashing...neat view from outdoor patio...at the macy's m and twenty minutes of wait...near sunset and requesting indoors...small booth for two...vegetable sandwich and quite good...quite large...quite filling...endless diet coke refills prompt...mountain of fries instead of the salad....safe, & simple dinner without breaking the bank..."
Mike P.,"San Jose, United States",17,58,4,4.0,1/4/2013,"Always super packed, but never lacks on the service. Usually a long wait but stepping outside to see the amazing view is a great way to pass the time. Never a lack of good food to choose from."
Ming S.,"San Francisco, United States",146,132,390,1.0,13/12/2009,"Pieces of crap, literally. If the pigeons and seagulls aren't enough for you (if you get outdoor seating, indoor seating is usually much longer wait time), the poor service will definitely be another notch down if that's even possible. I came here twice for lunch, the first time was so so (2/5 stars). Went here again for the second time. This time, we got an outdoor table immediately, but wait, the waitress gave us the wrong table and we had to go back into the waiting area for another 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes wait, we got seated at a outdoor table full of pigeon crap, and a seagull looking at the diners for any trace of unprotected food. Waited for another 10 minutes for the waitress to show up, only for her to ask do you guys want some bread? We said yes, but the water and bread did not show up after she asked if we wanted some (call me crazy, but I expect this to show up within 5 minutes at most restaurants). After 40mins of wait, I've had enough... time to get the f out and never come back to this bird infested hole at top of Macy's."
Paumela B.,"Vista, United States",10,52,5,3.0,14/6/2014,this cheesecake factory is pretty much like other cheesecake factories i've been too. food is ok. service was good but a bit slow. overall it was ok.
Susan L.,"New York, United States",229,493,50,2.0,12/1/2010,"Whenever I come to Cheesecake Factory, I can't help but feel like a fat American. Their corporate mission must be to load as many calories as possible into ever customer. They have all kinds of tricks - grated cheese on everything, portion sizes bigger than my torso, appetizers thrown into the deep fryer, oversized beverage glasses, and of course, 1,000 calorie cheesecake. Some things in that ginormous menu are delicious but the majority are worse than the Olive Garden. My team's favorites are: crab wontons (fried), avocado rolls (fried), calamari (fried), macaroni and cheese balls (fried) and buffalo strips (fried). See a pattern yet? Aside from all the food that makes me want to purge afterwards, their service is horrendous. We always make a reservation, 15 minutes before we plan to arrive, and every time they make us wait 30 minutes for our table. Wtf could possibly cause this wait? A 5-yr-old could figure out how to seat everyone on time better than they can. During our last visit, their computer system supposedly crapped out twice, causing all of our delays. Considering the vast empire of Cheesecake Factories across this country, how do they not have a functioning and reliable computer system? I was blown away but no matter how negative this review is, holy moly that slice of cheesecake was divine!!!"
Shirley W.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, United States",312,92,4,4.0,16/1/2010,"Every Cheesecake Factory I've been to from LA to SF has never let me down in terms of ambiance and decor.   Our server was really attentive on a Friday night at 11pm, near closing time.  He ensured our cups were filled with water and wasn't offended that we ordered 4 cheesecakes and several drinks for 9 people. Their current special: Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake and their Velvet Cheesecake (which my friend says they run out pretty frequently)."
Warrick P.,"Henderson, United States",19,5,24,5.0,28/3/2013,"As a frequent flyer at the CKF I can say with some authority that this location is top on my list. There is only one negative and that's the long wait... But that a testimony to how good it is. The grub is always brilliant, but it's the views from the outdoor seating coupled with some of the best service in SF that gets this CKF top marks every time. Wait staff at CKF on Union Square, you guys rock !"
Jonathan L.,"Tampa, United States",457,120,205,5.0,13/11/2008,"Pros: Great location, middle of downtown, San Francisco. Good atmosphere to have a conversation and enjoy good food. Super full to even try cheesecakes from here but I swear, next time I will eat some cheesecake. Good service.  Cons: Average wait for seating is an hour. It can get a little crowded. But other than that. Five stars for great restaurant."
Gavnila G.,"Alameda, United States",0,32,1,1.0,22/1/2014,Nothing special except the atmosphere and the view and the balcony... burger was meh...i had better in much cheaper places... 124 including tip for dinner for 4..
Ekin O.,"Chicago, United States",18,66,27,3.0,9/1/2010,"The husband and I came here Sunday night to finally use that $25 gift certificate I had won in the holiday office party in 2008. I was worried it might have expired, but it didn't. The $25 didn't get us very far, but at least made a little dent in the total bill. The place was swarming with tourists (a lot of Europeans, strangely enough. I guess the size of the portions is exotic for them). Our wait was 45 minutes, so we pushed through the throngs to go over to the bar. Somehow we were able to hover over some other patrons who were leaving and snatch their seats on their way out. We had some drinks -- the Mondavi Cheesecake Factory Cabernet is actually pretty good and the mixed drinks are funny (very fru fru) but if you like sweet, you'll like them. Bartender was professional, curt, and busy.  Then our pager went off! Don't be fooled: when your little pager goes off it doesn't mean you'll be seated right away. It just means that you're supposed to go back over to the swamped front desk and then wait for them to call your name (additional wait time, about 5 minutes).  Our server was nice but, poor girl, seemed a little overwhelmed. She would disappear for 20+ minutes at a time. I was wondering if it was a smoke break or to quell her panic attacks. Either way, we were fine with the slow service because we wanted to take it easy. For us newbies, the menu took about 25 minutes to read anyway. It's very long. The sections are (more or less, in my mind I remember them as): Appetizers, More Appetizers, Little Bites that Are Also Appetizers, Chicken, More Chicken, Meat, Italian-American, Meat, Random Page of Some Stuff that Might be Reminiscent of Mexican, Cheesecake, Cheesecake, Cheesecake. We got the ""made to order"" guacamole which I was sad to find out was not made at our table but just made with the amount of spiciness we requested (mild, medium, or hot). I thought it would be more like Adobo Grill (in Chicago). Anyway, the guac was missing something but tasty enough. For dinner I got the 4 cheese penne (not authentic Italian but cheesy and very passable, and enough for 4 giants to split and still be satiated). Husband got the wasabi encrusted tuna tartar. He liked it a lot and surprisingly it wasn't that expensive for a big chunk of seemingly fresh fish. We sat inside which was NOISY but in a sort of fun, lively way. There's also the heated patio that looks out onto Union Square (if you're in one of the few tables that actually is set up near the railing) but the people sitting out there looking freezing. Overall, it was an experience. After hearing the Birthday song sung about 4 times, I got the feeling that this is a place where you go for a special occasion if you're a true blooded American who wants to eat and eat big when you're celebrating. I probably won't end up frequenting this establishment more than once or twice in the next decade (not because it's bad, just because it's not really my style), but if I ever want to feel like a tourist and take a ""staycation,"" or feel like a real American, I'd go again."
Corine G.,"Long Beach, United States",158,9,,1.0,14/11/2013,"Where to begin? Ah yes... Let's go back to New Years Eve 2012... After having no luck finding somewhere to eat that didn't require a reservation, we settled for Cheesecake Factory. Sure there was a one hour wait, but I was tired and hungry... We waited, and waited, until finally 2 hours later, we get seated... Outside, with no heaters... I was too busy imagining how delicious the food would taste to notice that my face and hands were numb. Oh well. We devoured our dinner. Service was good/quick, food was good, dessert was even better. They offered a complimentary glass of champagne to ring in the New Year... Sadly I had to turn that offer down since I was 8 months pregnant at the time... We wrap things up and proceed towards the elevator when BAM, I slip on champagne spilled on the floor. Fell face forward, but was lucky enough to land on my wrists... My wrists weren't so lucky though... No wet floor sign, no one trying to clean it up... NOTHING. Did I mention I was 8 months pregnant? While I pulled myself together in the restroom and called my doctor, my fiance and 2 other employees explained what happened to the manager, and what does he reply? ""Well was she drunk?"" NO I WASN'T DRUNK! Didn't you just hear that I'm pregnant? ""Well why did she fall?"" I FELL BECAUSE YOUR STAFF FAILED TO WIPE THE FLOORS. Once I met up with them, we exchanged contact information and he told us to expect a call from Corporate within the next week... That's it? You're not going to bother asking me if I'm alright? Do I need an ambulance? Free slice of cheesecake? We were too worried to bother with that then... Of course, we never received a call from corporate, but luckily for them baby was a-okay and that's all that really mattered..."
Brian L.,"Rohnert Park, United States",420,67,17,4.0,26/8/2009,"I remember coming here when I was still a tourist to the city! Needless to say, I've had some great memories here with friends...and I really appreciate its location and quality.  Overall, this place works really hard to deliver a great experience to everybody... So...Why 4 stars?  Every time I have come here, its guaranteed that you'll be waiting for a table...sometimes for over an hour!  What we usually do is make our reservation and head out to Union Square for shopping...Still, its a little frustrating that they wont accept reservations (at least last time I checked) As for prices and food quality...the food is great and the prices are just fine!  If you're visiting the city, this place is great! There's something on the menu for everybody!"
Nic Z.,"San Francisco, United States",3,57,,1.0,12/12/2011,"If I could give it one star, I would. Why, you ask, am I giving Cheesecake Factory minus stars if I could? Because we were waiting to eat, and I saw one of the waitstaff (bleach-blonde hair, short pigtails, ~3pm) go up to the line where the food is placed for the waitstaff to grab & deliver, and she took a handful of food off of one of the waiting plates, and stuffed it into her mouth. Not long after, a waitsaff person grabbed the plate to take to a waiting table after jiggling the plate (presumably to cover the hole where the pigtails girl grabbed from). Seriously gross. If I could've found a manager, I would have said something. I should've asked to speak with one). When I waited tables in college, my fellow waiters, let alone manager, would have slapped me if I'd done something like that."
Michael-Paggy W.,"San Mateo, United States",4,17,,4.0,15/5/2011,"It like going to Disney Land and getting on one of those roller coaster rides....you have to get in a long line, enter the elevator and go on top of Macy's. While in the elevator, you anticipate the excitement and fulfillment and how your tummy is going to thank you after you bite into that delicious cheese cake.  Went there with girlfriends and sat outside: it was really nice: We shared the following: -Ahi tuna roll, dipped in tempura and fried -Thai Chicken pasta -Miso Salmon -Key lime mango cheese cake They were all pretty good and of course I had to have a glass of champagne!!"
