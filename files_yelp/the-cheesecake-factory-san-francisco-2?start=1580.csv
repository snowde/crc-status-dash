Rheine T.,"San Lorenzo, United States",501,136,138,4.0,29/7/2011,"I will lower down the 5 star to a 4 star because of the wait.  This place can be really busy, so get ready to wait for about 5? no 30 minutes.  Came and ate Fettucini Alfredo, asked for extra cheese, they grated it in front of me with no hassle. I also asked for a cherry pepsi, and well the gentleman said they don't have it, but they got really creative.  After waiting for 4 minutes, he came back with a tall glass of pepsi with cherries on the bottom!  Ordered a cheesecake for dessert, it was really big for a slice, so I had to take some home for later.  It may be pricey, but it's worth the good food!"
Carl B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,14,,1.0,2/12/2012,"Arrived at 6:27pm on Sunday night to wait 45 mins...which turned into 1 hour 20 mins.  Finally got seated and they brought out the wrong order.  My friends ate while I had to wait for my corrected order.  After multiple excuses for time delays, our group was in and out of the restaurant in 3 hours 18 minutes causing us to miss a planned movie nearby.  THIS IS THE WORSE F&CKING SERVICE OF ANY RESTAURANT IN UNION SQUARE.  Incompetent minimum wagers seriously need to put their heads on straight and not over promise while under-delivering.  I WILL NOT BE BACK!  WHAT A WASTE OF 3+ HOURS."
Allison K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,39,13,2.0,1/12/2012,If ur a patient person it's the  perfect place for u :) if not don't bother the food is great but the staff has a lot of fake ness to their service they were all happy n smiling then they walk away with a mad face
Wendy A.,"San Francisco, United States",15,2,,4.0,7/3/2013,Godiva chocolate cheese cake is to die for.. Service is good but there are always a lot of people dining in so you'll have to wait.
Jay A.,"Camino, United States",7,89,,3.0,16/9/2012,"Very, very long wait. Slow elevator to the restaurant, which is on the top floor. Take the escalators instead (just remember on the 7th floor, you have to do a 180 degree turn around and walk through the furniture dept. a bit to find the escalator up to floor 8).  Food was outstanding, service was mediocre, but is to be expected for such a busy location. Parking is nightmarish, and expensive. Be forewarned. Leave the car at home, if at all possible."
Beth F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,2.0,5/5/2013,"I can see the appeal of the Cheesecake Factory, but today the service let me down.  1. They got my drink order wrong, and the correct one did not appear until after I finished my appetizer (and they still charged me $12.50 for it!). Shirley Temples had no maraschino cherries. I hate the things personally, but that is what makes them magical for little girls!  2. They sat my family at a table where I was essentially sitting in the aisle, getting bumped by wait staff every time they passed.  3. The reason I went there was to pick up a whole cheesecake I had pre-ordered for a friend's birthday. After a long discussion with a woman on the phone, and with our waiter who told me they were decorating it, the cake did not have any birthday message on it as I requested. A $50 birthday cake!  I would characterize the food as fine, and as another noted the portions were big. But I won't be going there again."
Ryan R.,"San Francisco, United States",50,46,26,4.0,11/11/2009,"I have eaten here (lunch and dinner) many many times, but only had the time to review it now! Well, my internet is going to cut off in a couple of days. My cell phone cut off last week.... Because I'm moving to Japan, among the 27 countries I will be in for the next year. So what have I been doing? Eating at all the places that I won't find outside of th United States!! The cheesecake just isn't the same anywhere else. If I don't get my oreo cheesecake at least once a year It just doesn't feel right. And so what am I going to do right before I go? You guessed it! I docked 'em a star because sometimes they kick me out of the terrace area for taking too many pictures. I'm not in anyone's way! =P I don't want to get fat either, but you can't eat your fat and not have it."
Sandy C.,"New York, United States",367,544,1513,3.0,6/12/2009,"My friends and I decided to come here mainly for the view. We got there and there was a wait. A 20 minute wait for the ""heated"" outside area and about an hour for indoor seating. We decided to go for the outside area since it was heated and of course the view. During our wait we went outside to check out the view and we were disappointed. They didn't lie to us, the outside was indeed heated - with patio heaters. Despite having patio heaters, just standing outside was really cold for us and besides clouds were forming, not a good sign. We asked to be seated inside and it was no problem. The food and service was good. And luckily, we made our decision to be seated inside because half way into our dinner it started to rain. Glad to be warm and dry...felt bad for those who chose to sat outside."
Vincent K.,"Emeryville, United States",421,813,70,3.0,10/9/2009,"Why, damn you Cheesecake factory for always being so ridiculously long yet making me forget with your sweet delightful cheesecakes at the end.  I always feel like I can't be bought out of my first impression of you and yet you push my patience and in the end bribe me to walk away with a sweet taste of oreo still in my mouth from that cheesecake.   It's no wonder this place has a consistent rush of customers each time I come here.  I even tried getting reservations for a large group of people for a birthday, but  as expected, they said they can't accomodate but the best they could do is make us wait 45 mins.   But this time I was here I felt a little bit more mature and ordered what the old crowd drink: Well mannered Dirty Martini - quite the eloquent sophisticated drink and all that makes it well mannered, believe it or not, is just the stuffed olive with blue cheese.   still good though. -Jambalaya with shrimp and chicken in the cajun spicy sauce - a little on the overcooked side, but rather dissapointing since everyone was raving about this. -Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira very good with mashed potatoes with bits - A good value for the meal, I just love combos and this one was a great exception. -Avocado Egg Roll in the sweet sauce - still my favorite thing to get from Cheesecake factory As for the Cheesecakes, we went crazy on it for our two birthday friends: -Red Velvet - soooo smooth -Blackout Cake ala mode - chocolate chocolate chocolate -Vanilla Bean - probably the simplest yet fulfilling cake -Oreo - who can resist oreo (shakes, ice cream, cookies, and now cheesecake)"
Kristen M.,"Union City, United States",314,94,4,2.0,5/9/2012,"The San Francisco Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the worst locations of the restaurant to eat at if you want timely and courteous service. The food is great but the customer service and attentiveness of the waiters/ waitresses is definitely lacking.  The few times I've been here I've been mistreated as a customer but still I continue to return. The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant.  The nice thing about this place though is the view you have from the top of Macy's. It is pretty awesome. And like with any other Cheesecake Factory place the food and desserts are awesome"
Brianne G.,"Pinole, United States",2,48,,5.0,13/2/2010,"Cheesecake Factory on Union Square..oh how I love thee. My husband has brought me hear a few times, plus Ive been a couple times with co-workers and family. Yes the wait can get rather irritating or what not but once you are seated, you'll probably drool all over the novel sized menu. The food is always absolutely delishuuuuzzz. Yes the portions are huge, but you know what? Id rather pay $$ money for huge servings of wonderful food, than $$$$$ money for a teeny serving of wonderful food...you dig? Even the food presentation is excellent :)  See you tomorrow Mr. C Factory, you didn't think I could pass up Valentines Day without paying a visit did you?? come on now."
Victoria V.,"Sebastopol, United States",5,61,67,3.0,4/1/2011,"Great view of SF and Union Square.  Best to have a earlier dinner and avoid waiting as long as you would during traditional dinner hours.  The staff here was aveerage, not rude just not as friendly as other locations."
Chris W.,"San Francisco, United States",12,35,1,5.0,24/7/2010,"Torn between a 4 and a 5.   We had a toddler at our table and was very impressed that as soon as we sat down, they brought out a plate w/ tiny slices of bread and bananas.  It's already a really big hassle to fight the crowds there w/ a stroller and to deal w/ dining out w/ a baby.  It was a very nice touch of them to have that small plate ready for us.   The food was good for a chain.  I think the portions are too big and it is a challenge to finish everything on your plate.   I'm surprised to find that their baby high chair was in good shape as opposed to all of the broken ones at the newly opened Burger Bar."
Nadav M.,"Montreal, Canada",22,251,177,2.0,26/3/2012,This place has a habit of taking way too long for the food as well the waiters in a way ignore your service and I was given warm water when I clearly asked for ice. Also the waiter didn't turn on the heater when i told him when i sat outside. I might not be coming here. I'll perhaps start going to Pleasanton or Walnut Creek.
Daniel S.,"San Francisco, United States",402,271,32,4.0,18/7/2010,"Ive only been to The Cheesecake Factory a couple times. Both times I had a good experience. Their cheesecake is REALLY good. (Sorry I forgot which one exactly I ordered, but it is ""The Cheesecake Factory"" so yes you got to try a cheesecake from them! ha!) but as of my meal I just settled for one of their burgers. It was ok. Nothing to amazingly special about it. Just a good burger that was REALLY EXPENSIVE.  This place was also hard to find and it was hard to get a table. Had to wait like 20 min or so for lunch. Well yea this place is a tourist attraction so I wasnt mad or anything. Just surprised that you had to wait for lunch. Overall a good restaurant."
Mike T.,"San Francisco, United States",2,18,3,4.0,30/7/2014,"i went there couple week ago during weekend with family of four, i ordered a steak and my family of four ordered their set of meals and we ordered a fancy chocolate cheesecake, which i end up in love with.  I do not use to eat cheesecake before, but i know i want to go again after my first bite. i think the seating, however, are very limited probably because these seats are very good -viewed to outside.  But i still enjoy that meal with my family.  We will probably go there again next few weeks."
Breniel L.,"San Francisco, United States",177,116,122,4.0,17/7/2010,"I like coming here. It's great, but I HATE the wait. It's such a pain. They don't take reservations or anything. The service is pretty good, most of the waiters I've had are pretty nice. I don't like how the beepers have a small radius...I really wish that I could go shopping while waiting.  I've gotten a variety of things here. I like the jambalaya and the pasta they have here. I barely ever finish everything that I have here. I really like the mango smoothie thing they have. I always get that and the firecracker salmon thing. I wished I liked cheesecake as much as the rest of the world does though."
Glenn P.,"Mountain View, United States",40,23,,2.0,18/4/2011,"Unless you're sitting outside with a view of Union Square, its just another Cheesecake factory.  The outside seating is what makes this place special, nothing else!!! The place is always packed, usually you have to wait some 30 minutes just to get a place to sit.  Honestly, its not really worth the wait or the drive to SF just to go there.  You could just find another Cheesecake Factory somewhere else.   Its basically just another chain!!!!"
Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, United States",3,18,1,1.0,19/12/2011,"Although the food is great, the portions are way too big and it leads to a lot of food being thrown away.I don't like that idea. Re: service. It is only passable. When we visited on Dec. 14 at 5 p.m., we had a 20 minute wait and there were LOTS of empty tables!  Second, I asked for iced tea.  I got it but no spoon and no sweeteners were provided. Lastly, we were not given a table knife at all!  When we left, there were a lot of people waiting for dinner. Still there were lots of empty tables so I don't know it they were short-handed for help or what but I would not want to go again and have to wait.  This is the second visit and the same applies."
Fatty A.,"San Francisco, United States",233,1805,12,3.0,28/2/2012,This place is always freakin busy.  The last time I came the food took over 30 minutes to come out.  Thats cool if they are slow but its not cool when the food is overcooked.  The pasta was mushy as shit.  Lame.  The last time I was here we were seated on the patio and some black guys started making a scene.  One of the black dudes was complaining there was a hair in his food and he obviously pulled the race card saying they got hair in their food cuz they was black.  He started cussing and causing the other people in the restaurant to be uncomfortable so they just comped their entire meal and gave them a gift certificate to come back.  I wish I were black so I can get me some free food.  :(
