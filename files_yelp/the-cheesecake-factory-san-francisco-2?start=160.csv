Jerianne G.,"Daly City, CA",1361,387,719,3.0,1/26/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, in many places. They've all had pretty much the same foods. So my review for this is strictly based on this location. Pros: - Available seating indoors or outdoors (outdoor seating is the best on a sunny day since you'll have a great view of Union Square. It's also gorgeous during the winter, but make sure to wear a warm jacket or sweater since it tends to be pretty cold in SF) - Located on the top floor of Macy's, so you know where to go if you want to walk off that cheesecake after. You're also near a lot of shops along Union Square, which is also pretty neat-o.  - Their cheesecakes, while the same in most locations, are always definitely a pro here. You can have them to-go or dine in and eat em there.  Cons: - Service is definitely a hit or miss, but it all depends on how busy it gets. - Since a lot of tourists and visitors like to come here after a day of exploring Union Square, be prepared to wait for a while.  - The food is standard, but definitely overpriced. - Parking around Union Square is difficult not only because of the price, but because of how packed it gets, as well as the traffic that comes along with being a touristy area. Be prepared to either wait in traffic, or to ask yourself whether or not you'd want to take public transportation.  - THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. Just wanted to let you all know.  You definitely have to try a Cheesecake Factory, at least once in your life. If not here, then elsewhere also."
Kay E.,"West Covina, CA",23,3,,1.0,10/12/2017,"We went to get some dessert to go tonight.  There was a 35 minute wait to place an order for a slice of cheese cake to go.  The lady at the counter was very apologetic and said they are trying a new system and it is slowing them down.  After finally placing our order we waited an additional 10 minutes.  The desert was put on the counter, but no one was there to pack it and release it to the recipient.  Finally a person came and started packing. When I told him that we waited 45 minutes for a slice of cheese cake his response of ""we have many things to do"" really upset me.  I do not recommend this place.  Terrible customer service."
Ms. M.,"Redwood City, CA",0,28,,3.0,9/21/2017,"The cheesecakes are great, but I find their salads really disappointing. They chop them up in tiny pieces and give you a huge plate to hide that there is very little of the ingredients stated on the menu. Go for the cheesecake."
Karin H.,"CA, CA",8,12,12,4.0,7/5/2017,"Very good food, salads, burgers, Sammies, steak, Shepards pie. Mid-range price. Also good drinks.  Kidsfriendly. They have a kids menu up to 10 years. Think ahead and book a table or you might have to whait about 1 hour for seating.  Good waiters. A bit messy.  Supergood cheesecake about 8 dollars a piece. Separately packaged doggie bags, cause you'll need it!"
Carla W.,"Bakersfield, CA",132,124,103,5.0,4/2/2017,"Bad news: my waffle took forever; we were one of the first to arrive at opening time. Good news and 5 stars because Brenda and Jessica were excellent servers. Manager Jessie was kind to adjust the bill since my waffle came out way later than my companions' dishes. I appreciate that they took action and didn't just provide verbal apologies with no compensation. I came specifically for the waffle with pecans, strawberries and chantilly cream. Ask for the cream on the side. The fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee are great. The hot chocolate was flavorful. The omelette was good too. We will be back. Even though they timing wasn't great, he staff LISTENED and reacted accordingly. I usually order Jambalaya pasta and Godiva cheesecake and both of these are consistently delicious."

Shashank B.,"Santa Clara, CA",9,4,,1.0,1/24/2017,Pathetic service. Make customers feel unwanted/ couldn't care less attitude across the management chain. The standard reply seems to be : Go to our home page and provide your comments..!! Seriously..!! I was expecting that the Cheesecake Factory management would atleast acknowledge and reply to an email written directly to them (based on email addresses and phone numbers provided by the Manager at the SF - Union Square branch)..  Looks like I'm expecting too much and not surprised that the same attitude seems to be percolating to the restaurants as well.. Looks like I've had my last visit to TCF in a long long time..!!
Christina G.,"San Francisco, CA",167,165,169,1.0,3/14/2017,"Ugh...I've had enough of the service here. It seems that each time I come here, I leave unhappy and frustrated. The location at Union Square is always crowded, meaning a long hour or so wait for a table for two on any night. That is understandable, as it is a big restaurant. After my friend and I patiently waited and opted for outdoor seating (despite the cold night since it was faster), we were finally seated. The waiter that dropped us off didn't give us menus, but said he would be right back with them. Another waiter came by and then said rudely that we were not supposed to be sitting out there, as seats are for paying customers only. Excuse me? We had waited our hour for a table like everyone else. He had judged us as some wandering tourists or whatever that were just chilling out there! We let him know that we were paying customers and intended to order. A few minutes later, he apologizes for his mistake. Ok, strike one. We make our order and try to let it go. The rest of the service was extremely slow. Later, I try to pay with a giftcard and notice that he doesn't deduct the fee. We wait another fifteen minutes from him to correct that mistake. Slow, slow, inattentive service. I do love the food and cheesecakes here, but it really isn't worth the terrible wait and service."
Siva L.,"San Bruno, CA",0,2,6,4.0,11/5/2017,"The wait for this place is ridiculous. All that can be avoided just by accepting reservations, I had a party of 16 and the waitress was extremely rude because of how tight our table was. Then she went on break and we ended up with such a nice waiter for the rest of our meal. The food, however is great! As well as the cheesecakes."
Tanya B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,7,3.0,6/11/2017,I come here when there is a group of us as it has a large menu and suits everyone's needs. Every time I have went to the Cheesecake Factory however I have had to wait for a table this is mostly evening time usually 40 minutes to an hour. The price is standard in San Francisco but it's location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square which is nice. Staff are friendly and once you are seated service is pretty quick. Food is good but nothing amazing.
Christiani C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,43,,1.0,1/19/2017,"I frequent the Cheesecake factory in Palo Alto and love it for it's excellent service, and since it's close to our company's headquarters.  Today I went there at 11:15 am, early, because I did not want to have any issues with getting a table. Further more it was raining all morning so I figure I would get seated right away.... WRONG. When I arrived there were about 6 hosts behind the desk standing by.  I approached a young skinny Indian guy and requested a table for 3. Since my guests had not arrived he told me that he could not seat me at a booth because he needed at least 3 people to be present. I mentioned that one of them was coming in right now... but there was no budging --  3 PEOPLE ARE NEEDED FOR A BOOTH.  I asked him if I could then get a table for 1 in the mean time and he said NO - ""you can only seat at the bar."" I asked if I could then make reservations and wait and again he said NO, no reservations are taken.   The lady manager just stood there hearing our conversation without saying a word.  I decided to seat down on the side and wait, but then I decided to walk to the seating area and it was completely empty, except for a table of a few business people, and another booth taken by 2 employees of the restaurant who were hanging out with a waitress working there ---   wait a minute, I thought it was 3 People for a booth?? I'll now give you my honest opinion... this is so silly because the whole place was empty... more than 7 booths empty - and the patio was close because it was empty. Nobody was coming in today because    1. it was so early  2. it was raining.  I finally was able to get my guests to arrived and we were seated.  I requested a booth by the window but even the waitress me standing half way... she had to go back to the host and ask if a seat by the booth was okay. A few minutes later she returns and I finally get seated.  The meal was good, the other waitress that arrived was polite, and when I asked her if it would get busy... she said the whole place had been empty the whole week because of the rain, and because it's after Christmas season.   AND GUESS WHAT? The whole place remained empty for the remaining 45 minutes that I was there.  I don't blame the young guy for following protocol but I think this is pretty absurd. I""m a patron, a paying customer who supports their establishments, but their snobbish behavior, and ""rules"" that at times do not apply - or they apply to preferential treatment... that's NOT OKAY. btw...  the previous review of the Indian guy visiting this place with his elderly parents really ticked me off. People shouldn't be treated this way.   DON'T REWARD BAD SERVICE.  ps.  oh yeah, I asked if they had wifi and the waitress said ""no."" Go figure."
Crystal L.,"Fresno, CA",1,11,,1.0,1/14/2017,"Only here because we got a gift card. Waited 30 minutes for a table we could see was open during the entire wait. Hostess got snippy with me when I pointed it out. She was ""waiting"" for it to be bussed and cleaned. I didn't know that was a 30 minute process she wasn't capable of doing. When I was a hostess I knew how to move plates and use a rag to wipe down a flat surface. I guess we all have different skills  Would not come back, even with another gift card."
Irma C.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/20/2017,"This is the most dirty Cheesecake Factory, the service was horrible.  They gave us plastic cups that looked from the 70s with stains and yellowed.  The server did not even offer drinks first she went straight to the dinner menu."
Delone J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/27/2017,This is an overrated place for people and majority of the people are tourists. The restaraunt is usually crowded with a lot of people. One day i decided to go there with my girlfriend at night and the wait time was REALLY LONG. It was an hour of wait time. As we waited and got seated the workers were really rude and didn't take our orders. The food card and they were large portions but it tasted really basic. I paid 40 dollars for only two orders not including tips. The pasta was not good and it made my girlfriends stomach hurt.
Nathan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,231,467,3.0,9/3/2016,"Tourist trap, a bit too busy. It's a must try at least once but the wait sucks! It has a great view if you have the time. Great food and accommodating servers but nothing special."
Essie K.,"San Diego, CA",68,500,254,4.0,2/27/2016,"I decided to grab lunch at the Cheesecake Factory with a friend. It's located at the top of the Macy's building in Union Square. They have an elevator to the right at the entrance that takes you straight up to the restaurant.  The restaurant is pretty big but they always seem to be busy. Given it was a nice sunny day, we opted to sit in the outdoor patio area. A must if the weather is good! The patio overlooks Union Square. Though it wasn't overly crowded, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and it took another 15 minutes to order our food. Overall the food quality is worth 3 stars. It's just average American food- not terrible but nothing special. It's nice that they have a large selection of entrees so everyone has something to eat (even a skinny menu for those who are on a diet or want to eat healthier). The beautiful view bumped up the rating to 4 stars.  Love the complimentary bread basket with butter and if you have room left at the end, you should try their assortment of cheesecakes.  Definitely a tourist attraction and come semi-hungry because you'll be waiting for a while."
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,2.0,12/31/2016,"Service was horrible. Food was just okay. Not commensurate with other Cheesecake spots we've been to. I suggest going to the bar or ordering something from their appetizer menu, the rest is hit or miss. The restaurant is nice and on the top floor. It was too cold to sit outside but I would image it to be a nice experience when the weather permits."
Edie G.,"San Francisco, CA",4,76,251,5.0,7/6/2016,"I like the Cheesecake Factory. The only problem with this location is, it is Always busy. There is always a wait up to almost 40mins. or more.  I only come here on special occasions. When I do, I like to dine al fresco. There is a nice view of Union Square and the buildings around it.  This time I came here for brunch. I ordered the French Toast. It doesn't look like the traditional french toast. It is very fancy and it is very good! I would order it again next time.  The cheesecakes they serve are very good too. It is kind of expensive, but it is definitely worth it. It's not like you would eat it everyday; so once in a while it is nice to treat yourself."
Sabrina R.,"Livermore, CA",9,36,25,1.0,8/19/2017,"Terrible service! We waited for 45 minutes, but we didn't get a table. So we bought cheesecakes, but we waited for 20 minutes while 3 servers were chatting  behind the desk instead to give attention for the customers. I am very very disappointed."
