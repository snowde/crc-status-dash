Lindy B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",88,192,104,3.0,16/3/2010,"I'm shopping, I'm hungry.  Haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in like forever (old Marina Del Rey hangout); so why not?  Well, it's 12:30 on St. Paddy's day parade day in SF and, well let's just say, CROWDED.  But I score a seat at the bar and sit to eat and enjoy.   The one thing I didn't remember about this place is the Menu, pages and pages of offerings.  Most of the items I wouldn't even consider for lunch (thousands and thousands of calories); but I settle on the Thai Noodle Salad, lightly dressed ($9.95) and a glass of Saint M (from Germany) Riesling when my bartender/waiter finally was able to look up to take my order.  Good thing I said ""lightly dressed"" because there was plenty of dressing on it; but overall it was good.  This chicken was cooked well, not dry, the veggies fresh, the noodles not all sticking together, and the wine was very very nice with.  Not a bad deal. LindySez: While I would have LOVED to have had a piece of cheesecake, I didn't have 10 friends to share it with, so my waist couldn't afford it."
bryan d.,"Moss Beach, United States",3,6,1,4.0,22/12/2010,"I am always excited to eat here. I consider it one of my favorite restaurants, it serves delicious food and has a very good peach smoothie. It is always crowded but the wait is worth it.  The only bad experience I had here was yesterday, the service was terrible. It took over 5 minutes for my lemonade to arrive and my baja chicken tacos were given to me after my friend had already finished her lunch! Not to mention I finished all my tacos before my rice and beans were brought to the table."
John G.,"San Diego, United States",20,211,,3.0,6/2/2010,"Good food and good service But this restaurant needs to have a more organized line, better service at the hostess/host desk to get a table! Once people got off the elevator -- everyone rushed toward 3 different girls taking down names and handing out those buzzers. It was Chaos at that desk. And the employees there did not take down names/people in any type of order. (Thursday, Feb 5, 7pm). This place would be great if there was a better system to take down names at the start of your restaurant experience at this restaurant."
Amanda S.,"San Francisco, United States",91,47,7,4.0,22/8/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Yeah, at first I thought this restaurant only served cheesecake, which I thought was weird. Anyway, they don't JUST serve cheesecake..its more than that! I've always ordered different dishes--ordered a pizza, jambalaya pasta, angel hair pasta and a tons of fun burger. I love their complimentary bread and butter! All of the portions are HUGE! And the dishes are delicious. I always have leftovers because I'm a small person :) Expect to pay about $10+ a dish. The service is great, overall. Never a problem with any of the waiters/waitresses! They are very friendly. This place is perfect for a date, birthday, anniversary, whatever you want it to be. One thing I don't like are the wait times to get a table. They don't take reservations. So its best to arrive there once it opens. If not, you're better off taking a pager and wandering around the floors of Macy's, or going somewhere else. Another thing I am not too fond of is the outdoor seating. Yes, the view is breathtaking but during one of my visits, pigeons were flying around occasionally and trying to eat my food. And San Francisco weather can be very windy, so my hair would blow all over the place while I'm eating my food. And it was so cold! Not sure if they installed heaters by now. Make sure you get a cheesecake after your meal! It's what they are known for. I tried their Kahlua Cheesecake--delicious!"
Saori E.,"Los Angeles, United States",206,272,627,4.0,15/9/2009,"It's really what you'd expect of a nice chain restaurant. It's very reliable. My only complaint would be that the eggplant sandwich which I love, is slightly too greasy, especially since it comes with fries already.  I really like their Da Vinci Pasta-- here's a recipe to make it at home, actually:  Thai lettuce wraps are great, as are a lot of their tempting appetizers. Crab cakes, fish tacos, salmon, etc-- really everything I've had here has been satisfactory and above.  Great bread service, of course-- and they always listen to my ""just the brown bread please"" request :) Of course, their cheesecakes are to die for!!!!! My all-time favorite is lemon-raspberry. Sooo amazing. Tart/sweet/rich. Perfection. But please share-- unless you are only going for dessert. If you have an appetizer, an entree, and a cheesecake (not to mention the free bread), you WILL explode."
Jenni Y.,"San Diego, United States",134,213,393,3.0,29/12/2009,I've heard that this Cheesecake Factory was super popular so I really wanted to check it out. I've gotta say that waiting an hour for a spot isn't really worth it even if it's on the top floor.  The food and service were all good and I don't see much of a difference from the one I've eaten down in San Diego's Fashion Valley  or UTC except that it's located on the top floor of the Macy's building. The view wasn't as great as I anticipated cuz we sat indoors and I got enough of the view on the 7th floor while waiting for a spot. I would've picked somewhere else to eat if I knew it wouldn't be THAT awesome since I could get the same thing elsewhere without starving myself. I only made myself stick around for that entire hour cuz I was really hoping for a special experience with this particular Cheesecake Factory.
Shafaq C.,"San Francisco, United States",36,126,20,4.0,28/7/2009,"Who can say no to cheesecake? And the page full of flavors? Well... sometimes I do, because im already SO FULL from the entree! So yes, Cheesecake Factory is a commercial restaurant chain, but they serve pretty good food and this location in particular offers a great location and view with patio seating.  The entrees are pretty big in size and the booklet of options leads to a debate of decisions on what to eat....but I usually walk out of the Facto pretty satisfied.  My personal fav? The Bistro Shrimp Pasta. So crispy, so yummy.  And Because I'm a spice lover, i add in some crushed chili flakes that makes it even better. YUM. And so far, I haven't gone wrong with dessert.  So head over, take a seat, and enjoy the view of Union Square above Macys.. or even the busy indoor seating.  The food across Cheesecake Factories is pretty consistent and pretty satisfying :)"
Kimmy F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,5.0,28/10/2013,"The service is great. The food is even better! It's a place that me n my friends all love! Went there this evening. Had steak Diane and BANG-BANG chicken n shrimp that the waitress, Jen, sugguested. Both of them were really good! I will definitely order them again next time!"
Emad G.,"Hayward, United States",51,26,5,1.0,8/12/2010,"I went with three other friends. They got their food but me...when finally came out, was just the steak and no sides, server told me the sides will be out shortly.....are you kidding me. The steak was so bad and over cooked. I sent it back with the server who kept giving me and my friends dirty looks, what a cosumer service. The Manager came and apologized and asked if I want the same dish I said yes....45 minutes later I had to flag the server to get me the check and the manager...still no food for me. the manager came out and told me the whole check is on the house but can't get me the steak !!!!!!! What a shame..I will never go back."
Jessica B.,"Elk Grove, United States",11,2,,2.0,21/8/2014,"Great Food, Service was good, but Extremely Long wait times and if you like to be stared at while you eat then have fun with that because people outside stare and watch you eat and lean on your chairs while your eating dinner or lunch or whatever it is your eating since they have no where else to wait, also if you go when macy's closes good luck going back down the elevator, if you're claustrophobic good luck with that also since there are no other ways down and you're basically stuffed into an elevator..... i was not happy about the experience i had yesterday."
T K.,"Granada Hills, United States",1,18,,1.0,28/3/2013,"First off, I've had good experiences eating at Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other areas, but this one in Union Square... ugh....dirty dishes, greasy tables, crumbs and who-knows-what on the seats.  On my way back, I realized the Muni metro train cars felt more clean than this restaurant.   I was so grossed out that my stomach was uneasy all night.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory. Never again.  The food is marginally better than say, a Denny's, ...but at least Denny's has clean dishes.  This review is only for the restaurant located in Union Square, but it only takes one bad experience like this to turn me off to the whole chain.  Yuck!"
Brittany S.,"San Carlos, United States",5,95,45,2.0,24/1/2013,Sucks overpriced for crappy frozen food.. Theres so many great places to eat and explore in SF dont waste ur time eatting here
Sam B.,"Santa Clara, United States",194,818,933,3.0,25/6/2012,I will never wait more than 30 minutes for a table in any restaurant (period). They might have good food with huge portion but it is not worth the wait at a crowded restaurant. I am giving them 3 stars because Cheesecake is really awesome especially the low carb. We usually have them to go and eat the Cheesecake at Crissy Field.
Erik L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,31/1/2012,"This is my first time ever at The Cheesecake Factory, and it was exactly like the way others described it here. I didn't know the wait would be so long!  They took at least 30 minutes to get my order.  I was seated at the patio and i sat there waiting, waiting, waiting. At least the view was beautiful, it was so lovely and you felt like an important person for just a second.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and i thought it was ok.  Nothing memorable or amazing about it. I wouldn't order that again. overall, it was just an average experience for me.  i felt the servers just weren't attentive or nice.  The food could've been better too, and the wait was just way too long."
Sarah V.,"East Oakland, Oakland, United States",0,9,3,5.0,22/1/2013,"Pasta, cheesecake, and cosmos. What more can a girl want?"
Kay R.,"Santa Monica, United States",128,179,54,4.0,2/3/2010,"I think this Cheesecake Factory is great.  I love the atmosphere, I love the location... definitely a nice spot to go to for a nice lunch or dinner celebration.  The wait can sometimes be a pain in the a** but it's worth it. Just came here again for a friend's birthday.  We were here for lunch and waited 10 mins for a table (if even that).  My friend and I shared a pizza (the one with artichoke) and the ceasar salad.  Soooo much food!!  It was enough for three people.  The salad was exactly how I liked it but the pizza was a bit off.  Even though it was good, the way they made it was super weird.  It's like instead of taking all the toppings and spreading them throughout the pizza, they took each one and sectioned it!  So there was an artichoke section, a bacon section, and a mushroom section!!  So freakin weird!!  Who does that?!? The cheesecakes were of course to die for delicious but I've never had a complaint on that. The only other thing that was blah was the service.  Our waitress was so blah and had a bit of a 'tude if you know what I mean.  At first we only wanted two plates for the salad but then our friend changed her mind and wanted to share too.  So when we asked her for another plate she said ""That's why I asked you earlier... well let me welcome these other people FIRST"" all frustrated with us or something.  Geeez!  Hello, isn't that your job?  To fill our glasses and make sure we have what we need??  I could go get the plate myself if you want to tip me.  Honestly, I'm not one of those jerky people that are like bossy and rude to servers but come on now, we just wanted an extra side plate.  I mean damn good thing I didn't ask for an extra napkin! Honestly because of that I would have given my experience a 3.5 but since I just love this place and would always want to go back... I couldn't just b/c of some snooty waitress."
Violet D.,"Maryville, United States",0,14,,2.0,23/3/2013,Someone in the kitchen was way to generous with the pepper.  Service was OK. Food was not as good as other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to in the past.
Verena S.,"Las Vegas, United States",69,22,,4.0,22/2/2010,"I'm in love with this place for its vibe and their cakes! I'm not a fan for their food...Like the typical chain restaurant, Cheesecake Factory has the standard-just ok food (not bad, but not great).  However, when it comes to their cheesecakes, I'm definitely a huge fan!! They're all so delicious. My favorite so far is the Red Velvet Cheesecake (I'm in love with this cake)! Further, the location above Macy's in Union Square is really cool. I think this location is a great place for a first date (if he/she is not a severe food critic). It's on the top of the building, has an amazing patio with great view, nicely heated, and you can also enjoy the sky/stars/moon/whatever. :)"
Karen T.,"San Francisco, United States",366,1253,2320,3.0,1/8/2010,"So after they took my shrimp poor boy away I've been looking for an alternative favorite and still haven't found something I crave for. After hearing how many calories is in the shrimp bistro pasta, I couldn't eat it anymore. For my birthday lunch I had the crab cake sandwich and it was good, but not amazing. Fries were perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Red velvet cheesecake was yumo! but like the pineapple one better. Tuna tartar was just ok, it was more avocado than tuna."
Lauren S.,"Stockton, United States",497,702,13,3.0,31/7/2009,"Whoa is this place overpriced or what? I went here for half off day, woo national cheesecake day! Got the red velvet cheesecake that was a pretty gooey flavourful mess. I wanted to die with how rich it is. The service sort of sucked and it felt like they wanted us to leave when we were talking and just chatting in the brief sunny moment that was had on Thursday on the patio. Is it really summer?"
