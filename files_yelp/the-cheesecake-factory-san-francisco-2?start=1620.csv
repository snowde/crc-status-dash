Angela F.,"Hawthorne, United States",40,119,220,2.0,25/7/2012,I have alwaysgone to the cheesecake factory in other states but very dissatisfied about the one in ST. I expected better from their Union Square location. The wait was a long time and the service was less than I expected. Sorry CCF maybe your were concerned about your customers happiness.
Gee L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,3.0,12/8/2014,"The restaurant is on the top floor of macys so it offers a beautiful view of the SF downtown/union square area.  Food was mediocre, and the service seemed very inefficient.  Since they don't take reservations, we had to wait more than 40 min for a table.  It was on a Wednesday night about 6pm."
Brian W.,"Orange County, United States",37,85,20,4.0,25/8/2010,"Despite my tough standards for chains, Cheesecake Factory almost always delivers. I've gone enough to find their menu predictable and bland, but their food excels in its class. I'm reviewing this location (as a tourist from So Cal.) due to the view. The view of Union Square is an excellent touch which separates this from every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. But I was the third party in line, and would not wait hours to simply have the view. Back to the food though, very satisfying for its class and you almost cannot go wrong with most everything on the menu. And of course, your cheescake is a delight. Four stars as an all around restaurant and chain, although the MANY great restaurants in SF deters me from any future visits to this location."
Ryan L.,"San Francisco, United States",17,222,5,1.0,30/11/2009,"Wow, this place probably has the best frozen cheesecakes ever.  Too bad I'm not looking for a frozen cheesecake.   A friend and I went against all notions of good taste and decided to come here for a cheesecake splurge.  We ignored the crowds of tourists and dirty, food-smeared floor to indulge in our cheesecake fantasies.   However, the cheesecake we were served was actually half frozen.  The waitress politely let us know that it simply must not have been thawed all the way.  Thawed?  Um, you'd think that a restaurant that's claim to fame is cheesecakes, wouldn't serve cheesecake that's been frozen --- yikes!"
Robert M.,"San Francisco, United States",18,50,1,1.0,19/7/2010,"It's really a hit-or-miss affair when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory.  Sometimes the service is quick, efficient, and even friendly.  Other times, it seems like I'm in the way and am a bother to the hosts and the servers.  I always expect a wait.  But 15 minutes after sitting until a server acknowledged my party?  Another 10 for bread and water and a promise that our server would be right with us.  Another 15 minutes or so until the food arrived.  And I can't imagine where our server went because we couldn't get refills or a check for another 10 minutes after finishing our meal completely. I've had far too many poor experiences now to make up for the good ones."
Jason C.,"Morgan Hill, United States",5,43,,4.0,3/1/2011,Great view of the Geary St garage and park. Ahh I remember those days with my friend Olga sitting outside watching the shoppers bustling about. Cheesecake Factory by itself is a 3 star place but this location gives it one extra. Make time between Thanksgiving and Christmas so you can spy on the beautiful christmas tree in the park above the Geary St parking garage. I don't get a chance to see the huge one at Rockafeller Center in NY so the one in San Francisco is the closest I can be most of the time.  It's way bigger than anything I ever have. (I've never had a real tree :(
Kev M.,"San Francisco, United States",15,293,93,3.0,3/5/2010,"Choose from their enormous 40 page catalog/menu for an array of large plates of salty, seasoned cuisine made for tourists. I can't say I disliked the experience nor the food, but the place is for the tourist masses. If you're a local, you probably know this already.   Sure, I did too, but sometimes you think, well, let's go there. And well, it was o.k."
Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, United States",182,1861,2456,5.0,27/6/2009,"I know people are quick to poo-poo this place because it is a chain restaurant, Macy's advertises to you with every flip of the menu page & it is always busy as hell...but I secretly love this place. I have such fond ""back in the day"" memories of this place: my college girls & i stumbling out (from one too many girlie drinks) clutching our half eaten vanilla bean cheesecake slices in their signature to-go container/bags. Or waiting TWO HOURS for a table big enough to accommodate 11 people on a Saturday night because one of my girls INSISTED we spend all her birthdays here. Good times, good times... Yes the wait is bitchass, yes its 85% tourists, yes its a chain restaurant, but in their defense, the food is consistently great & the menu selection is so massive, it's as thick as a book. Basically, they have whatever you want to eat between shopping & sightseeing.  My favorite foods here include:  - crabcake sandwich (crispy outside, moist inside & served with zesty tarter sauce) - avocado eggrolls (that tamarind dipping sauce is off the hook) - the new ""small plates"" menu... the stuffed mushrooms & shrimp scampi crostini are delicious (plates are too small to share, in my opinion) - Louisiana chicken pasta (spicy, HUGE portion) - miso salmon - dessert: adam's peanut butter fudge ripple & fresh banana cream - drinks: frozen iced mango smoothie, strawberry cremsicle (you don't even know there's alcohol in there) & pomegranate mojitos. The ambiance is great-dim, not too loud, beautiful ceiling/wall paintings. If you get seated outside, there are (very functional) heating lamps & the most awesome views of Tiffany & Co, Niketown & the other stores lining Union Square. Service is always fast & friendly. It's good stuff, people."
Greg R.,"Eugene, United States",0,19,,1.0,9/11/2012,"The cheesecake gift card division is fucked up. I made a mistake entering the person receiving the card, and I have contacted CC, by email, and made two phone calls, and the problem has not been solved. I would suggest NOT BUYING e gift cards."
David O.,"Walnut Creek, United States",127,1282,937,4.0,11/1/2008,"Come to the Cheesecake Factory hungry and you will experience, firsthand, the teachings of Confucius: Me:  Hello, we're hungry and we'd like a table for two. Hostess:  ""You must learn patience, Grasshopper!  Take this electronic pager.   When your mind has finally lost all hope for food, the buzzer will ring and you shall be seated."" 30 minutes later, my knees and back ache and I don't know if I'm waiting to eat or for a shot of morphine to dull the pain.   The pager buzzes red and we bring it back to the hostess.   We are told to wait a few minutes more... Well, my wife and I finally sat down some 35 minutes later on a Tuesday afternoon, around 2 PM, to eat our lunch.   I must say that the experience, once you finally do get seated and your waiter brings you your bread, is truly a pleasurable one. We were waited on by Dan T, a charming person who brought us our food with a smile and kind words.    We ordered way too much food:  Fried Mac & Cheese balls, Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Buffalo Blasts, and some Roadside Sliders with Cheese.   Because we'd waited a long time for our table, we thought we deserved a drink, so I went with the Well Mannered Martini, a beautiful martini with Ketel One served with 2 blue cheese stuffed olives.   My wife had a Stoli Sprite, her tried and true drink of choice. We ate a lot, and we still had a whole bunch of food to take home... enough, in fact, for 3 additional individual meals... So while the total bill was $85, tax and tip included, you can divide it roughly by 5 to figure out the cost of a meal per person... $17....   That's quite a good deal, methinkst, especially for such yummy food! I still have to dock 'em a star for the long wait.... There's no way I'd ever come here on weekends or weeknights... Weekday lunch is tolerable, but this grasshopper ain't got that much patience, sorry!"
Chelsea B.,"San Francisco, United States",50,49,17,3.0,10/7/2012,"i dont understand why i should wait til my ice from my cup melts to get a damn refill.  it is always super crowded in this place which is no surprise, its only in the largest damn macy's I've ever been in.  i liked the food, but not the fact i didn't get a refill to wash it down with."
JC G.,"Daly City, United States",93,24,,1.0,5/1/2015,"Bad! Bad! Bad! Customer service!!!!!!!! We came here Dec. 26,2014 at night and we waited almost 2 hours to get seated after we check in and another one in a half hour to get our order and another 45 minutes to serve our food. ....there so many empty tables and they told us it's reserved! Fuck you! !! Reserved we wait almost two hours? ????? What the fuck. ...you have many waiters but no one approached us until one hour in a half!!!!!! Damn!! We are not naked we all wearing casual and that's our first time in this fucking place , they have a lot of waiters but no one bother to ask what our order is we are starving to death! !!!!! And when we ask for our bill. .guess what? It took them less than half a minute only what the fuck!!!!!!! They just want our money!!! Who ever the manager on this place you need to quit your job! !!! You don't train your people right,  your staff are stupid because your a stupid manager your idiot and a bunch of idiot employee. ....you just have a good view from the balcony but bunch of stupid staff. ....I will never recommend ever this Macy cheesecake factory because this is an idiot factory!!!!!!!!!!!"
Kristy C.,"San Francisco, United States",47,7,,3.0,6/12/2009,"I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factorys to know that this one has a prime location on top of Macy's with an outside rooftop patio. From the downstairs SF car horns and street chatter to the view and quiet rooftop was so nice and relaxing. I ordered a burger and fries and my friend ordered a salad. They were both very tasty and yummy. So, the bad part of our luncheon was also the outside patio because of those DAMN pigeons. They are huge and walking around tables, picking at leftover bread in the bread baskets and flying inches from your head. It was very disgusting and I somewhat lost my appetite seeing all the birds flying around.  The rooftop patio was the best and the worse part of our luncheon which is very sad. Next time I go, I would want to sit inside despite the spectacular view on the rooftop..."
Stella R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,2.0,22/2/2013,"I have eaten here about 3 times, and each time was feeling well directly after my meal.  Why come back because, well I get gift certificates, friends want to go etc. Each time I got sick I thought it was isolated, because it case was a little different but the end result was the same. I though it was because I ate too much, or the food was too rich, but it tasted good. The last time I ate there as usual I order the mac and cheese balls which I love, and again I ran into their bathroom. The other day my friend went and was also sick and this is what triggered the review. Would I return to this location, weird but yes, but I would only order drinks and salads."
Shannel G.,"Round Lake, United States",39,179,16,3.0,5/4/2010,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Huge selection of food which will appeal to most everyone in your lunch/dinner party. The bartenders are friendly, though it does get pretty crowded as everyone is waiting to be seated.  The differentiating factor with this Cheesecake Factory is the view of Union Square and the fact that the population at the restaurant is likely more touristy. The only thing which disappointed me, was that when we were on the ground floor waiting for the elevator to go up to Cheesecake (8th flr), the hostess downstairs told us it's a 30 minute wait. Then when we got upstairs we were told 1hr and 15 min. We weren't in a rush, so it wasn't a big deal personally, but it was misleading and I didn't appreciate that."
Olivia D.,"Honolulu, United States",554,560,187,4.0,24/1/2007,"Normally, I wouldn't rate a restaurant with mediocre food this highly, but I appreciate the service I received. I was staying at a very loud hotel NYE weekend and needed to kill time so that I would return to the room only after the bar next door turned off it's window-rattling house music. I arrived at the Cheesecake Factory around 11:30, had a short wait, and was seated outside as requested. They were accomodating when I asked to be moved to another table nearby. Since we were just killing time and had just eaten a huge meal, we only ordered hot teas, a honey vanilla latte, and an order of fried calamari (I felt bad for ordering so little and I know how much servers hate serving hot tea.) I never felt pressured from our server to order more or eat faster, and when my tea came out lukewarm, she quickly got me a hotter one. She also cheerfully got me extra honey and lemons. I was so relieved they didn't make me feel like the nightmare customer I was feeling guiltily like. I also thought the appetizer was really good, especially from a restaurant with ""factory"" in the title."
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, United States",722,778,894,5.0,6/11/2007,"I dream about their rasberry lemon cheesecake. Often. There are so many great places to eat in the city.  I wondered why there was such a long wait for this place.  I just wanted my cheesecake. Then they took us out on the balcony, over-looking Union Square.  It was at night and the lights were breathtaking.   That's why.  Question answered.   Waitress was cute, quick and friendly."
Melody L.,"New York, United States",77,88,18,3.0,25/6/2010,"One of the few places I've been with a 20+ page menu, which creates somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades situation; nothing is below average, but nothing really jumps out at you (except for their delicious cheesecakes)  You get great value for the food, but again, I never feel like I crave a certain dish from here. The mixed drinks are better than the food. Their competitive edge is still their cheesecakes - most of the times I come here because I am craving their cheesecakes, not so much the food. The large space and outside patio are inviting and good for large parties. The view of union square from the patio on a sunny day or night with clear sky is absolutely amazing!  Service is completely arbitrary. I've waited 2 hrs even when I made a reservation and I've gotten seated immediately with the seat of my choice. Some waiters/waitresses are impatient while others are helpful and attentive...kind of wish there is more consistency (towards the better side of course)"
LoLa L.,"San Francisco, United States",59,104,14,3.0,20/6/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is for inexpensive, decent-quality dining.. .. I do like to have lunch on the outside patio, especially on a nice San Francisco day when you wanna get away from your desk and go a little further to eat and not at the sandwhich/salad place that you usually go to around the corner from your job.. ..but I had a suuuppperrr cool waiter, this time and she made the experience fun and the tab high because we really enjoyed our service and the food, so we ordered more and more.. in addition, it was my cousin graduation so we had a party of 35+, I felt like we took over half of the restaurant lol.. ..The drinks were a little watered down, but I still felt a buzz so I didnt complain, that's all I wanted.. not to be wasted, that's what the bar and karaoke is for, lol.. ..make sure to get a cheescake before you leave, or atleast a slice!"
Michael S.,"Ventura, United States",31,58,96,3.0,10/5/2010,Very busy restaurant...the food was not the best as most Cheesecake Factory's I've been to...but the VIEW was GREAT
