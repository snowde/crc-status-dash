Jade T.,"San Francisco, United States",156,325,1069,3.0,2/3/2010,"This is my least favorite Cheesecake Factory. I've always come here because whoever I'm with wants to come to the ""restaurant on top of Macys"", and even if it's a chain, I have found this location to always make dishes greasier than other locations. Not sure why... Service has always been okay, professional, but not overly friendly. Perhaps it's because they are always in a hurry. The wait here has never been under 20 minutes for lunch, 40 minutes for dinner. My suggestion would be to go straight to the top floor, then browse Macys after you have received your pager, otherwise those 40-60 minutes will go by VERY slowly. The view is nice on a sunny day or even at night, but probably not worth the wait unless you're really stuck on eating here. Everything else, it's your typical cheesecake factory.. with way too many options for food, a long wait if it's pizza, overpriced appetizers, and heavy duty entrees. Two things are great though (and those are consistent of every location I've gone)...  the cheese cake, and the drinks.. which have a tendency to be on the strong side."
M. R.,"Napa, United States",1,50,,5.0,23/7/2014,Love this place and the view OMG! Foods always wonderful and service is great. If you are looking for something to eat that is fresh and delicious I would recommend the Thai lettuce wraps to die for!
Frisco N.,"San Francisco, United States",1,15,16,4.0,2/10/2009,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory! The wait is super long! That's why I gave it a 4 Star. But the food is great and so are the drinks! Ladies, you MUST try the Georgia Peach! Aaaah! It's sooooo good! I have to have one whenever I come here. I also love the, I bealieve it's called, Thai Rice Rolls? Whatever they're called, they are AWESOME! Oh, and the Red Velvet Cheesecake is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Oh sweet Lord Baby Jesus!!! I think it's seasonal though=/ You have GOT to try it! Muy muy muy RICO=)"
Erika M.,"Los Angeles, United States",249,156,66,4.0,3/8/2011,"I don't care if this is a tourist trap.  I absolutely love this place (specifically at this location.)  The view of Union Square is awesome, especially around Christmas, when they have the ginormous Christmas tree.  And the food is good, too.  You can't go wrong with any of the pastas.  My favorite salad is the Luau Salad.  It's so refreshing, and I love the crunch from the wontons.  It's a huge salad, and I have shared it with 3 people.  Of course, you can't leave without a slice of cheesecake!  My personal favorites are the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle.  Mmm... they are so heavenly."
Steph G.,"San Jose, United States",0,273,,2.0,13/7/2010,"The best advice that anyone can give you about this place is to avoid it like the plague during weekends, if you want to eat some time before the following Monday. OMG, the freakin line is crazy! Now, I probably should have known this, but my friend and I took the chance to go there on a Saturday night. We got there about 6pm. There was a huge crowd by the elevator. Once we were finally in the restaurant, I pushed my way through the crowd and asked how long it would take. The guy working there said 2 and a half hours before we can get a buzzer!!!! In short the buzzer will ring to let you know your table is ready. BUT you cannot leave the vicinity of the restaurant, otherwise the buzzer won't work... And we waited. And we waited. And we waited. And... we waited some more. And then we finally got a buzzer!!! And we waited... And we waited... Then we went to the restaurant to check out the desserts. Too bad the place was so crowded that you couldn't even see them.  We were finally seated around 9pm. Wow, all this wait, and for what? The food was ok, but it cannot make up for the long wait. 2 stars for the food and the wait staff, but honestly, you could have driven to a better restaurant across town, eaten and been home int he time that it took to eat here."
Miguel V.,"San Francisco, United States",318,164,51,2.0,22/3/2010,"I don't have much to say about this place. The line took forever, There was nothing exciting about the food, The staff was blah, and the food was over priced. I am a big fan of cheese cake, but was so bummed about the rest of the meal I didn't fall in love with the cheese cake.  The pigeons are a pain in the behind. Over all the view was pretty good, but there are plenty of other restaurants in the city with SPECTACULAR views."
Cynthia W.,"San Francisco, United States",304,269,150,4.0,22/2/2010,"I like their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Sausage and Broccolini Pasta, and Fish and Chips. For appetizers, the Avocado Eggrolls and Fried Macaroni and Cheese are good too. But most recently, I had a Shrimp and Sausage pasta off their specials menu and it wasn't very good at all. I really like the interior and the heat lamps on the patio, but the wait (even for the elevator to get up there) can take a while (2 hours during weekend peak dinner time). A lot of the cheesecakes are too sweet for my taste, but then again, I'm the type of person who can only eat a few pieces of chocolate at once. So I usually look for cheesecakes with a sour counterpart (i.e. lime).  Being able to buy affordable food at a restaurant with a view like this one (overseeing Union Square from the top of Macy's) is pretty awesome."
Steph L.,"Daly City, United States",80,185,134,4.0,4/2/2010,"I wish this place wasn't so popular because then it would be less crowded and I wouldn't have to wait five years for a table.  The drinks are good and the service is always very friendly.  The food is nothing special, but gets the job done.  I am not a huge cheesecake fan, but the snickers cheesecake is gods gift to man-kind! I refuse to try anything else.  The main reason I gave this place four stars is because they have consistently great customer service!"
Deniece B.,"Stockton, United States",119,263,85,4.0,26/12/2011,"The food is good and they give a bunch of food for a reasonable price. The service is ok, the tables and utensils are horrible. I come here all the time when I visit the city, and it seems like they get worse and worse. Today the utensils were greasy and dirty, tables dirty, menus sticky. I hope they improve!"
Mary F.,"Berkeley, United States",403,186,62,2.0,1/3/2009,"Dang, I've just noticed that I'm a straight up 5 star ho. I give em out like candy on Halloween. Like booty on 'Casual Encounters'. Not this time. Cheesecake Factory, you have personally wronged me. If this was the 18th century, I would have challenged you to a duel. A friend of mine was in town from Canadia and I wanted to take her to some touristy SF stuff. We capped off a day at Fisherman's Warf and Alcatraz with dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. My expectations were mediocre and they still boo-dy-boo-ed all over them. Everything went downhill after the deepfried mac and cheese (don't judge me!).  They sat the most obnoxious table full of guys next to us. One kept straight up starring at me during the entire meal. Fool, this ain't dinner AND a show. When they got drunker, they tried to talk to our table via the WORST intro lines imaginable ""Hey umbrella girl, your umbrella fell off your chair"" ""Wanna eat some of our spinach dip while your friend is in the bathroom?"" Forreally reals?! That's your intro?? No wonder you're sitting at a table full of dudes with no girls.  Anyways, that's not entirely the fault of the Cheesecake Factory but then I got my main course with a cashew in it.... the one thing on this planet I am allergic to. REALLY?!?! I've eaten goat stomach lining cleaned with a hose, monkey brains, even survived a mimosa my other friends had to go to the hospital to get treated for E-COLI for..... and you motherf*ckers test me with a cashew?!? Really, no big deal.  At least I tried to keep it cool. I discretely whispered to the waitress that a cashew landed in my food and I was allergic and her hands flew in the air as she gasped ""OMG (literally 'Oh-Em-Gee', I did not know this restaurant was set in the internet) OMG!! I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION!!!"" For the rest of the night, I could see other patrons stealing glances at me to see if I had gone Eddie Murphy a la The Nutty Professor from a reaction. She called the manager who was far more gracious and he took the dish off our bill.  Then we ordered some cheesecake from their almost embarrassingly long and decadent menu... as if to prove to my visiting guest ""Look, America is fat AND excessive!"". But shit, we could not go to a place and not order something explicitly stated in their name. So we ordered. And waited. And waited... and waited. 15 minutes later, we were told that the printer in the cheesecake kitchen was broken and they had to reorder it for us and she'd be back when it's 'ready'. Really?!?! Reorder it?!?! Girl, you could have just walked back there with a knife and sliced. us. a. piece. of. cheesecake.  Ugh... Cheesecake Factory, I don't think I have anything less to say to you."
Candice B.,"San Francisco, United States",105,565,,3.0,18/12/2009,"Cheesecake factory on top of Macy's has the decor and the feel of a cheesy Vegas casino: the busy patterns make you dizzy and nothing looks authentic or real. Much like the decor, the menu is a big fusion of anything and everything Americans eat. And again, nothing authentic.  By the time you finish reading the novel-sized menu and finally decide on what to order: something healthy of course, afterall, you know about their giant portions, the calorie book will make your eyes pop out and gasp for air. A veggie sandwich has 1000 calories? Wait, how many miles do I have to run to burn that off again?  Since almost everything has four digit calories, you might as well loosen your pants and go for something tasty. I chose the Cajun pasta, because it's their ""most popular"" pasta dish. It has 1,176 calories, full of grease and spice. It doesn't necessarily taste bad, but makes me feel so gross afterwards. And the funny thing is, I didn't even finish it. After filling up on orange juice, bread and a side of asparagus (only 43 calories, because it came steamed and had no taste), I could only eat a third of the pasta.  If you look at it from an economic point of view, $17 for 1,176 calories, is a pretty cheap ratio. But seriously, is that what America's problem is? That food is so expensive we don't eat enough?  By the way, after the glimpse of the calorie book, I was too afraid to look at the amount of sodium in each dish. I didn't want to have a heart attack BEFORE I even starting eating.  Their bread is super delicious though. So that adds a star."
Natali Q.,"Fairview, United States",1,21,25,4.0,10/6/2014,"The wait time is more than 30 minutes here, the lobby gets extremely full. Staff is friendly and efficient in taking orders,  asking if everything is alright and serving our food with due time. Overall experience was good, except for the lengthy wait time."
Kevin W.,"Sacramento, United States",1,15,,1.0,7/1/2013,"Food is a B+ but, the service is an F-. The last time I went Geoffrey (waiter) provided very poor service. Tables seated after us received bread, water, and had orders placed at least 15-20 minutes before we could place our orders. Another example of his horrible customer service is when Geoffrey refused to fill up my tea pot because it was not completely empty. He just stated ""I'd hate for the tea to get cold"". Another time I was here they made me play musical chairs. After being seated at my table and receiving my food they made me move tables twice! By the time I could sit down and eat my meal it was already cold.  The food is good but, with this slow and lousy service I would never come back."
Steve Y.,"San Jose, United States",0,86,,3.0,12/9/2012,"This place is ok. We were kind of ignored by our servers though. The tex mex appetizer was pretty good, but my meatloaf was decent. The meat was kind of dry, not much sauce and the bottom was more oily than saucy. I dont think they even put any sauce over the meat.  The corn succotash was also kind of oily too.  This place is decent, but nothing makes it more special than other locations. Its on the 8th floor and it has a balcony that faces towards Union Square Park, but there is nothing much to see."
Justine D.,"Newark, United States",493,465,139,2.0,24/2/2009,"I always eat at The Cheesecake Factory when I'm in Honolulu.  It's tradition. As I was wondering around Union Square with my boyfriend we both looked at each other and realized that it had been far too long since either one of us had frequented this chain.  Hunger pains set in and why not? He was on vacation.   I like the view of the Cheesecake Factory over looking Union Square on a nice day.  The heat lamps can only provide so much warmth.  It was raining so as a result we choose to sit inside.  The view would have made the ambiance, much nicer.   The wait was short on Wednesday.  I enjoy my $10 cocktails and glasses of wine, or however much they cost.  In terms of food everyone knows the portions are ridiculous.  I honestly don't really care for anything, but the delicious dark bread and appetizers.  I always get the spicy ahi tempura rolls.  They are insanely good and quite filling.  On this occasion I tried the crusted chicken romano.  Disgusting.  If I had been hungry I definitely lost my appetite.  It was too rich.  It just made me nauseous.  I ended up taking the whole thing home to donate to other hungry mouths.  The boyfriend got the steak Diane cooked medium well.  I don't like my steaks burned personally, but he liked it. And our server was either crazy or krazy.  Drugs make you nuts as evidenced by her.  She was a poster child for what not to do while on the job.   Now I remember why I only eat at the Honolulu location."
Philly S.,"Oakland, United States",10,53,,4.0,22/7/2012,"Nice food, expensive cheesecakes. Had 4 burgers and a salad, overall it was good, but not perfect."
Melissa T.,"Fremont, United States",285,689,138,4.0,13/10/2006,"Apparently no one else wants to admit that the Cheesecake Factory rocks... Yes, it's noisy. Yes, it's a wee bit more expensive than say.. the Olive Garden.. and yes, you'll probably have to wait a while to get a table. It IS, however, very yummy. A great place to go with the girls to have a fruity drink and massive dessert. All Cheesecake Factories are pretty good, but this one has a nice view, too."
Carol Y.,"San Francisco, United States",446,942,526,3.0,8/11/2006,"Cheesecake Factories are famous for their huge portions and huge selection on their menu. This CF is located at the top of the Macy's in Union Square, so it's a great place to go after a busy day of shopping. There's outside seating on the balcony when it's warm and not too windy. however, the service and the wait gives cheesecake factory a lower rating.  if you really want to eat there -- try going during the weekdays or around 11am during the weekends."
Jannie Q.,"San Francisco, United States",29,270,58,4.0,25/2/2007,"Without fail:  Great food.  Long Wait.  If you're local, best to go to dinner before 6.  Then it is do-able.   Lots of great dishes to recommend: Appetizer: 1. Avocado rolls 2. Firecracker Salmon rolls 3. Thai lettuce wraps Entrees: 1. Chicken Madeira 2. Grilled Eggplant Sandwich 3. Crab cakes Usually come in big portions. Ask for lunch-sized portions or switch out the mashed potatoes for some Mixed Baby greens! Drinks: 1. Strawberry Lemonade 2. FROZEN ICED MANGO  Desserts: Any Cheesecake your heart desires!"
