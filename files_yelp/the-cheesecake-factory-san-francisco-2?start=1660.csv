Danster L.,"Orange County, United States",1683,730,2280,4.0,15/4/2007,"3.5 stars*** Ok, it was my birthday and my friend and I had decided we will eat here for my special day. The wait was not bad and parking was easy. However, it started to become an interesting dinner. The views from this location are very nice and thank goodness for heat lamps, or otherwise, we would of been freezing our butts off. Our waitress was nice but she seemed like she was in another world. She spilled my drink all over the table and that totally shocked me. But she cleaned it up very well and brought out extra napkins. There was a couple on my left fighting and a couple on my right who were non existent. The guy on the right side of me, left his date there to sit for half of the dinner by herself where she ended up paying and who knows what else. We ordered drinks, buffalo blasts, and cajun crispers. These dishes are my friend's and I's favorite CF dishes but they both came out kind of burnt. I posted up the pictures to show you all as well. The food was good but it was a little disappointment. Everything else was great and I would come back but when it is less crowded. 3.5 stars for the experience but 5 stars for my date! =) A memorable birthday which I will never forget!"
Colleen M.,"San Francisco, United States",653,518,359,3.0,27/12/2007,"Their food is decent, and it's always crowded and extremely loud. The one thing I love about this place is their outdoor seating during Christmas time. You can see the Union Square Christmas tree lit up like a fairy from below, and it's just beautiful. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is heavenly, and so is the strawberry cheesecake. Yummy. Don't go with too big a group though - the wait for a table is FOREVER."
Becky U.,"Concord, United States",193,367,236,5.0,11/5/2011,"Where else can you go to enjoy company with a good drink, good food and great view of Union Square, SF.  Been here plenty of times for all kinds of occassions.  The downfall is the wait! But if you are with great company, time flies."
Stephanie M.,"San Francisco, United States",561,285,82,3.0,25/4/2012,"There's nothing more sad than overly positive Yelp reviews of a Cheesecake Factory. I have never seen such a big novel..I mean..menu before, you can seriously eat anything here. In the history of the Cheesecake Factory's existence, there is ALWAYS a wait and tourists everywhere, but that's why they make them in malls. You could spend like up to two hours shopping and then return. If not you can chill in the balcony and snap tourist pictures. I've been coming here for years, I almost never save room for dessert because everything is so big. When I do, I usually go straight for the cheesecakes: Strawberry, Red velvet, Godiva Chocolate, Cookie Dough, Snickers, Pumpkin, and the million other flavors that are to die for! Man, that made me hungry.."
Crystal M.,"San Francisco, United States",3,55,9,3.0,7/4/2014,Great food! Just a really long wait at times. I had my 25th birthday dinner their and my family couldn't sit together cause it was so many people there but I made it work. They should start accepting reservations
Bee Q.,"San Bruno, United States",0,6,,1.0,6/10/2012,"Absolutely gross I had the so called Garlic Noodles w/ rubber shrimp, all I can say is my hubbies side clow slaw was the only thing that tasted good..."
Susan C.,"San Francisco, United States",2,54,,2.0,3/8/2013,"You, as a local, would never go here voluntarily but you have visiting relatives whose first wish is to go to Union Square and then eat at the Cheesecake Factory.   So you roll your eyes and go up to the top of Macy's and get in line.  If you've planned ahead sufficiently, go before peak dining time, so you ""only"" have to wait 30 minutes for a table.    Once you are seated, you grudgingly admire the view over Union Square  (if you are lucky enough to get a good table), and you flip through the textbook sized menu.  You wisely share an entrée - it doesn't really matter which as it will be a huge platter of forgettable comfort food no matter what you order, and save room for the obligatory cheesecake.  You admit that it is pretty good, and you'll even enjoy it for breakfast the next day (since you won't be able to finish it in one sitting).   For all that you've eaten, the bill isn't too large, and, besides, your visitors are taking you out tonight anyways. Then the next night, you take them to your favorite neighborhood bistro.  Unfortunately, when they come back next year, they will still say ""Oh, let's go back to the Cheesecake Factory."""
Monica D.,"San Francisco, United States",45,72,,2.0,5/8/2012,"The best thing about this place is the CHEESECAKE! We waited 30-45 minutes for a table. The service was SLOW.  The items that we ordered came out way too fast, that we couldn't even eat them fast enough. My dinner selection was the Farrelle w/ Chicken.  THE CHICKEN WAS DRY & BURNT so  bad that I had to cut around it. I brought it home so that it didn't look tacky to eat that way.  I might be back.  Will try other locations to see how the service is there."
Tawny P.,"Montclair, United States",46,62,49,5.0,9/11/2011,"Ok, so we all know that the Cheesecake Factory is DELICIOUS!! Especially their Cheescake of course!! BUT HELLO!!! DID YOU SEE THE VIEW?!! OH EM GEE!! This Cheescake Factory is not only good BUT its on top of the Macys building which when you go outside its so BEAUTIFUL!! You must come here to see this view!! I LOVE IT!! I think a date here would be awesome! the view alone is wounderful!!"
Anderson P.,"Oakland, United States",53,7,,3.0,10/5/2010,"Well I was definitely thrilled by being seated practically immediately on a Saturday evening. And outside at that. Another plus was order having my order out in less than 20mins. Although the waitress failed to bring the side of BBQ I asked for. Overall it was a break from the normal 1/2 an hour to 45min wait. But! And this is a huge ""BUT"" The drinks are a tad bit on the weak side. If I'm going to pay upwards of $9 for a drink I want my buzz worth! Outside of  that I didn't have much to complain about... This time."
Sascha M.,"New York, United States",593,812,7,3.0,6/4/2011,"After drinking at the Belden, we did a little shopping in Union Square and were starting to get thirsty and hungry again. I haven't had Cheesecake Factory in forever, so when my sister suggested it and said they now have these mini appetizers, I was sold.  We got strawberry martinis which were pretty good and chicken samosas and onion rings.  Yummy fatty snack food. There was only one bartender so the service was slow."
Archie G.,"San Jose, United States",1116,1026,42,2.0,9/1/2009,"With this San Francisco location, it is best to come when you are not hungry. The wait is so ridiculously long, you will be hungry by the time they seat you.  While you wait, think about these two questions: 1) Why so many people want to wait 45-minutes to an hour in line to eat mediocre food and bad cheesecake? 2) How can a restaurant with a menu several pages long that has approximately 239 food choices, have so little to offer? The food here is always uninspired. While the food is disappointing, the prices make it even worse. I have friends you who keep dragging me here, so I keep trying different things on the menu. In the end, I feel as if I they are taking stuff out of a freezer, warming it up, and putting it up on my plate. The servers annoy me as well. Every single time I order something, they have to remark how that is a good choice and how delicious that particular entree is. And then it comes out and I am forcing myself to swallow. So yeah, I do not appreciate liars. Nor do I appreciate this restaurant. Or it's crappy cheesecake.  Skip it and find a real restaurant with some sincerity, culture, and most importantly, flavor."
Miss H K.,"San Francisco, United States",446,959,1946,4.0,4/9/2006,"Food: The food here is good. I've tried several dishes here but I usually order the Chicken romano or four cheese pasta. Their cheesecake is also wonderful. My favorites are the Oreo and chocolate cake cheesecake. Price: Not bad. Most entrees are $12 and up and they have lunch sized portions for a cheaper price. Portions are pretty big. Service: Good, they have lots of help here and we've never experienced any problems here. I usually avoid this place during the evenings but Sunday mornings are usually always open. Location: Located on the 8th Floor at Macys Union Square. If you come on Sundays before 11 make sure to enter through the entrance near the LV store"
Neil R.,"Newark, United States",233,369,124,5.0,4/6/2009,"I haven't been here in ages and I was here a bit ago and it was bloody gorgeous. The view of the city, the scene, the decor of the restaurant, and honestly the staff rocks man. The hostess had killer sense of humor, the waiter was polite and prompt with our orders and he knew about my fav. band - Coldplay!  The food/drinks never disappoint. Try their Louisiana pasta with Strawberry Lemonade and if you have room, get their 30th Anniversary cheesecake dessert. Pure SEXXX!  Added plus: They play COLDPLAY and other GREAT music! The inside is really gorgeous... I was in awe with the colors and designs of the ceiling. Nice!  Sooo def. check this place out. Great with family or friends and even better with a hot date after dark! ;-)"
Ilya K.,"San Francisco, United States",129,10,,2.0,14/9/2010,"Chain restaurant with an extravagant, over-the-top interior design Bland-tasting food in huge portions, as if to justify the $$ prices. Fancy location with good view over the Union Square but that's about the only thing remarkable about the experience of eating there."
David W.,"Rochester, United States",1,163,140,4.0,25/3/2010,"This joint meant disaster for my diet. Whatever, it was soooo good. (well, the cheesecake, at least). The wait was a little longer than I would have liked, but I spent my time on the heated patio looking over Union Square. Somehow they were out of their tap beers (how does that happen?) but I guess people don't come there for the beer. It's all about the cheesecake! I got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. Oh my word. At first, when I was served my piece, I was disappointed by the portion (I paid $7 for THIS!?) but trust me, this stuff fills you up. You'll be forcing the last fork-full down. But it's soooo good; incredibly rich and yummy in ways I can't describe! You'll pay for it, of course: one slice has half of your daily caloric intake. But if you can get over that and put in a little more work at the gym to make up for it, you'll be so glad you came here."
Suabot J.,"San Francisco, United States",21,75,,3.0,7/6/2012,big portion of food but I'm not a big fan of the food taste. Vegas feel atmosphere and the cheesecakes are awesome.
Gill C.,"San Francisco, United States",359,379,1573,4.0,17/1/2009,"OK, I know it's a chain, and usually the wait for a table at this location is absolutely absurd. However, it was a balmy January week night, and was willing to bet that getting a table at the bar wouldn't be too problematic.  Well, the CF experience didn't start off well.  After we checked in, our hostess disappeared and we waited by the reception desk for what seemed like 10 minutes. All was forgiven when she led us to one of the best tables in the house, outside and by a heat lamp. The view was amazing and the outside temperature was perfect.  After perusing the ginormous menu, we decided on a few cocktails, an appetizer, and a salad.  Cocktails -- The blended Bellini.. I know, those 2 words shouldn't go together, but it worked and went down so smoothly.  Our app was the Crispy Crab Wontons, which is their version of Crab Rangoon. Fresh Crab meat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts and Sweet Chili Sauce. OMG this was so lovely. It wasn't greasy fried, and with ample wontons (maybe 8). You could really taste the crab and couldn't stop popping these in my mouth.  Before the salads arrived, I started to get full from the basket of the warm bread and wontons.  So, the salad was the French Country Salad -Mixed Greens, Grilled Asparagus, Fresh Beets, Goat Cheese and Candied Pecans. I always order any menu item that includes goat cheese, so this was a no brainer. Requested it be beet-less. This was an 'appetizer salad' but was a perfectly sized portion. There would be no way I'd finish an entree sized salad. It was a good salad, but was disappointed that the cheese wasn't warm and that there wasn't enough pecans.  Our service was decent, and I know it can't be hit or miss depending on the day and time of day you go. No dessert was consumed at this dinner, but I usually get the original cheesecake or oreo.  Overall, this was a lovely CF dining experience. What's not to enjoy when you have a warm winter evening, an excellent dinner companion, and good food!"
J V.,"San Mateo, United States",5,77,44,5.0,7/6/2011,"Their cheesecake is so delish!! I love it!! My favorite is the vanilla bean cheesecake, its simple just the way I like it, not too sweet, creamy & cool. Mmmmm... Their key lime is also a must try. If you like sweet cheesecake i reccomend the dulce de leche cheesecake or the chocolate coconut cheesecake.. just try them all!! Their food portions are big & the house bread they serve is great!!"
Lerka J.,"San Francisco, United States",6,56,8,5.0,4/11/2009,"LOVE IT!  Huge portions!!!!  Awesome view!!!!!  I always take Thai Lettuce wraps...they are delicious and healthier than anything else..so I eat them all guilty free lol  Love their complimentary bread (dark one!)  ps Don't even feed the seagull outside, because it won't go away!)"
