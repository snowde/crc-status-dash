Kathleen M.,"Hercules, United States",30,13,5,4.0,19/7/2010,all i gotta say is... RED-VELVET-CHEESECAKE!!!!! was the best cheesecake i've ever had.  definitely worth it to get that.
Alberto R.,"Alameda, United States",0,13,7,3.0,3/11/2012,"the wait is always toooooo long.  The food is average and the prices are ok.  You would assume that by now they'd get used to being busy so they would perform better, but the service still suffers.  We only saw our waiter once when he took our order and once when he brought the food and the last time he handed us the check."
Joe P.,"Sacramento, United States",10,151,,4.0,20/6/2011,With this location sitting on top of the 8th floor in Union Square how could it not be good ? Been here several times and very consistent .Food is good as well as the service.Good drinks too.
Taylor S.,"San Francisco, United States",118,162,172,2.0,18/3/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory sits above Macy's and overlooks Union Square, but don't let the location sell you. You're going to wind up waiting for quite a while without a reservation, and you're probably going to end up standing in a dozen photos being taken by the tourists around you. The portions are always large (sometimes excessive), but never specifically amazing for the prices you pay. I enjoy the decor and the presentation of staff, but the ambient noise reminds me of a cafeteria.  San Francisco offers a remarkable variety of restaurants, all a small walk or ride away. Be adventurous, poke around at other options before settling with something so mediocre, at best."
Rachel H.,"San Francisco, United States",52,253,12,2.0,19/10/2009,"OMFG Cheesecake. The wait for a table here is insane. Absolutely insane. Also, it is absolutely flooded with fat white tourists. It was like the boat to Alcatraz up in there. If you are at all claustrophobic, then DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT come here for dinner. During dinner time the escalator stairs from the mall are closed and completely inaccessible, so the only way up is a medium sized elevator packed to the brim with fat white people, which you must stand in line to get inside. You will endure a few terrifying moments packed in with 20 people, majority 250-350 pounds each, as the elevator shrieks in indignation (""I'm not paid enough to deal with this shiiiiiiiiit!"" the elevator cries as it takes us up). Also, there seems to be no Emergency Stairs at all. If there was, they were well hidden. Isn't there some kind of law against that? That MUST be against code. In fact, for lack of Emergency Stairs/signs pointing out Emergency Stairs, I am taking 3 stars off because I felt like I was in danger the whole time. If they change this, my rating will go to 5 stars. Anyway, the dinner. We had to leave and come back so I could have some of my anxiety medicine, otherwise I would not have been able to deal with it. Once that kicked in, we got some drinks and mooned over the view from the patio. I had a Lemon Drop (which was refreshing and divine), boyfriend had a Mojito (which was also most excellent). I was very relaxed from fresh air, medicine, and drink by the time we were called to our table. The dinner: The portions here are insanely huge (which explains the overwhelming presence of fatties) so if you're a normal sized person I advise you to skip the appetizers, no matter how hungry you may be from the hour long wait. Or, have a meal made up of JUST appetizers, that works too. We had: Artichoke, spinach dip for appetizers. The artichoke came with two sauces for dipping. One thing that really impressed me about Cheesecake Factory is the sauces. If you have a good sauce, it really pulls the meal together, and the sauces here were pretty amazing. I would love to have taken some of these sauces home with me. They were both pretty delicious. For dinner, I had the Beef Ribs and the boyfriend had some kind of sandwich that he claims was amazing. I didn't try it though, because it looked boring. The Beef Ribs were f-ing delicious. They come large, thick, and pre-separated. Each rib is individually lined with what looked to be two different kinds of BBQ sauce, and the sauces were again delicious. Not too spicy. They are also fork-and-knife tender, so don't be afraid of a mess when you order it. You also get onion rings and french fries with it, though I opted for mashed potatoes instead. I was getting pretty wasted from the Lemon Drops by the time dessert arrived, which was the Red Velvet Cheesecake. OMFG, Cheesecake. OMFG OMFG OMFG. It was sooooo good. Even though we couldn't finish our dinners we managed to kill at least half of the heaping slice of cheesecake. Then, into the to-go box it went. It was pretty reasonably priced. For two appetizers, two entrees, four cocktails and dessert, $118 including tip. And, we took home enough food for 2 more meals each. Pretty good value considering the location. I recommend bringing a nondescript bag to put the leftovers in because the homeless will try to fight you for them on the way home. Serious. All in all, once I got over the claustrophobia, it was a pretty good experience. Our server, a nice lady with short blond wavy hair, was very attentive, especially considering how busy she must have been. If they can fix the crowded elevator situation, and CLEARLY MARK THEIR EMERGENCY STAIRS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, then I feel I can easily bring my rating to five stars. Until then, I think I will only come here for lunch from now on."
Annie W.,"Vallejo, United States",2,66,,3.0,23/10/2013,"Long waits, lots of people, great view of union square, amazing cheesecakes, 3000+ cal meals, not strong enough drinks, nice service, and great company. What else could a girl want? Our waitress was great."
Seline Y.,"Manhattan, United States",0,9,1,5.0,3/6/2014,Love the food... especially the cheesecake and every one (with only 1 exception) I met who works here was extremely nice. I come here almost everyday when I'm in SF. Love it!
Diana C.,"Corona, United States",204,691,796,4.0,19/1/2012,"The ambiance is very upscale although the attire is casual. Located on top of the Macy's it is very convenient that an elevator takes you there. Everything is a tad expensive. They also do not have a happy hour although their bar is packed at the usual happy hour time. I've come here more for the view outside. If you manage to get seating outside, you get an awesome view of union square. It is especially pretty during Christmas."
Vika H.,"Oakland, United States",27,58,70,5.0,19/1/2010,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory. I been to the Pleasanton, Walnut Creek, and this one in Frisco. I like the one in Walnut Creek because it's not too crouded as the other two. The one in Pleasanton seemed too little like a tight space when you're sitting at a regular table for 2-4 people, it's also the smallest I've ever been too. The one entree I ALWAYs order is the chicken madeira. My all time favorite here. The miso salmon is also good. Their appetizers are also good. Can't remember the names but their were a few that's delicious. As for the cheesecakes, I never had anything other than the strawberry one. Don't want to try the others. I'm good with just the strawberry cheesecake. Ummm ummm good.  I also been to one in Utah and Arizona and what do I always order, Chicken Madeira. That's all."
Jeromy G.,"Foster City, United States",602,660,1032,4.0,22/4/2013,"I like coming here. We come here often when we are in the city mainly because when were are done shopping or running our errands its the only good thing open that is close by. It sucks that when it's late they shut down the Macy's where there are couches we sit on while waiting to be seated. There is always a long wait so be prepared, don't come starving because you will die. Anyway it's nice because it's up high in union square and it's just a fantastic view so that's something real special. The food is always consistent and tasty when we get it so that is nice. They have a large menu with different food choices so you can find something you like or just try something new. The bread is always warm and good, the only place where I will pick wheat over white bread. The service is just ok because there are so many people to take care of but the food is good. We usually get the steak diane and the sides are always done right so I don't mess with consistency once it starts to deteriorate I will try something else but until then I stick with a classic. Good date place if you are in a time crunch to find a place to eat, good default place to have as a backup plan."
Elise M.,"Los Angeles, United States",329,211,185,3.0,7/12/2008,"One star for the stellar location, atop the Macy's building.  One star for the bar.  And the final star for the Mac n Cheese balls. Actually, the balls alone deserve five stars, but this particular CF is such a clusterfu*k that it totally takes away from the spherical goodness. I worked in that Macy's for a while, and on the weekends we would watch the hordes of tourists head up the elevators only to come back down minutes later, having been told that there was a wait of an hour or more. Weekday lunch can be fantastic though, and during the warmer summer months a seat on the patio offers some choice viewing of city life."
T K.,"San Francisco, United States",20,62,6,4.0,21/9/2009,Reasons why I will keep coming back to this tourist trap 1. Shopping at Macy's and I'm hungry and too lazy to go anywhere else.  2. Red Velvet Cheesecake! - Their red velvet is one of the best that I have ever had. Super moist and the cheesecake just enhances the traditional version. (Basically why I rated it 4 stars - only a 2 star if they take Red velvet off their menu!) Service is spotty. Drinks are weak and yes its always too crowded.
Danielle S.,"Sacramento, United States",136,202,15,4.0,5/7/2013,"For the most part a Cheesecake Factory is a Cheesecake Factory is a Cheesecake Factory. This Cheesecake Factory, however, is an exception due to the location. Perched atop the Macy's in Union Square they have a great patio for you to take in the beautiful view! If it's cold (it IS SF afterall), they do have some heaters to make your visit more comfortable. There is always a super long wait and the lobby area is quite the cluster f, but once you're seated you are greeted with an expansive menu of delicious food including a new lower calorie menu. I've never read a bad meal here and this visit was no exception. The Caesar salad is one of my personal favorites and I decided on the lettuce wraps to compliment the salad with a Long Island ice tea to finish off the meal. The server was perfectly attentive and I appreciated his suggestions. If you are visiting the city and looking for nice view, this is the place for you!"
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, United States",1536,1308,2750,4.0,22/12/2008,"I have a love/hate relationship with this location: PROS: - Cool view of Union Square - Couches on the floor below for you to sit and relax if you have a 1 hour plus wait - Good food - Balcony seating CONS: - 2 hour wait on a Friday night D; - a bitch to get up to (8 floors up via escalator OR 30 minute wait for the elevator) - Complete chaos on a busy night It's worth it if it's your first time (either at this location or at Cheesecake Factory), otherwise go to another not-so-busy location."
Kozy T.,"Hayward, United States",4,14,9,5.0,10/2/2009,"I used to go this restaurant on every Sunday to have lunch with different friends. Actually, I just wanted to eat the yummy cheese cake and I know every meal here in cheese cake factory is so huge!! I can't consume it!! So, I recommend those who don't wanna eat much for cheese cake after meal as dessert to order AVOCADO EGGROLLS!! This is appetiser but still it is not so small and not so big. Also, It's sooooooooooo delicious! I really love it!!  Plus, my favorite cheese cake is LEMON RASPBERRY CREAM CHEESECAKE!! Try it!!"
jackee p.,"San Francisco, United States",0,17,2,1.0,11/8/2012,"This review is mainly to warn people about pick pockets that roam through Cheesecake Factory on busy nights. I can't believe that this place doesn't have proper security being that it is in the middle of Union Square!  I got my phone snatched from right out of my lap while sitting at the bar. RIGHT OUT OF MY LAP!! Luckily, I caught the situation in time and ran after the woman before she got into the elevator. The 3 hostesses looked at me with a blank stare as I yelled at them to call security. The manager came over to apologize after I sat back down, but I would have felt better if they had security to deal with."
Marie N.,"Reno, United States",4,114,3,3.0,29/3/2010,"1.  VERY long waits for tables.  I've never waited under 45 minutes and more often than not, it is 1 1/2 hours. 2.  Lines to get up the elevator and lines to get back down.  Second elevator is always broken. 3.  Bar area is far too small to handle all of the patrons that are waiting a life time for a table. 4.  Drinks, although tasty,  are very costly. This restaurant experience, my third in SF in two days, was the best and I find that hysterical!  The food was really good.  My husband had his third cheeseburger of the weekend and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I ordered the Thai chicken pasta which was phenomenal.  So much so that I""m going to try to recreate the recipe at home this weekend.  So you will understand when I tell you that I was absolutely crushed to find out that our waiter accidentally threw away my leftovers, of which there were at least one more full meal.  Luckily he was gallant and offered to whip me up another plate or get me a slice of cheesecake on the house.  I chose the Godiva cheesecake which is my favorite and will always be my favorite.  So, Cheesecake Factory saved the weekend gastronomically but I'll avoid this location in the future.  Walnut Creek is so much quicker..."
Audrey G.,"San Francisco, United States",63,46,40,3.0,30/4/2011,"As most of you know, the wait time here isn't that great, and neither is the front desk. The music is actually really loud, and it's hard to hear them when they shout your name.. Anyways, let's move on: - THIS REVIEW IS FOR MY NEW FAVORITE WAITER ANTONIO - Okay, so, where do I begin?! As me and my cousin were seated, Antonio did not hesitate to ask us what drinks we wanted. He came back super quick with our drinks (which, to a small girl like me, was quite a big cup) and gave us more time to figure out what we wanted to order. We ended up ordering the boneless buffalo strips to start, a small bowl or the fettuccine alfredo, and a spicy buffalo burger with sweet potato fries. I strongly recommend for people to order a small size - unless you're really really hungry, because large plates are huuuuuuuge. After we were done eating, we were handed the cheesecake menu. We didn't know what to order, so we asked Antonio to help us out. He actually took the time to sit down and help us! He strongly recommended us to go with the White chocolate Macadamia cheesecake since it was his favorite, and I'm so glad we listened to him. He knows exactly what goes well with what, and is such a sweetheart. He made my second experience here a lot better than my first!"
Phan H.,"San Francisco, United States",236,590,1,3.0,8/12/2011,"Long wait, cramped elevator, and freezing cold outside. Why do people come here? The hype and overrated view. We came here for dinner one night, but the wait was going to be 45 minutes, and went somewhere else. Later in the night, we came back for dessert, since I've never been here before. Had the cheesecake factory cab and a strawberry cheesecake. Both were very good and the price was a little pricey for how overrated the place was. Service was fast and friendly though."
Yuchi C.,"San Francisco, United States",92,472,12,1.0,17/4/2009,I would rather eat the whipped cream that's on top than the cheesecake. I would dump a guy with no second thought if he ever suggests going to CF. Grow up/wake up people...it's San Francisco...is it really necessary to stand in line for an hour to go to CF here? Isn't it a suburban thing?
