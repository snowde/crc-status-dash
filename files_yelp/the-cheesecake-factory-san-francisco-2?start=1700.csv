Victoria M.,"Richmond, United States",5,7,,2.0,7/8/2012,"Horrible seating situation going on here. Everytime we go it's a very long wait but this time....Ooh god! It was the last day before my mother went back to Mexico so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so cheesecake factory it was.  They don't take reservations even for large parties so we decided to wing it. Big mistake, they told us it would be an hour long wait (typical) but 4 of us would be seated at one table and the other 4 at another table separately,(not so typical) not even close to each other! And if we waited for a table large enough we would get it by closing time; it was 8:30 on a Saturday. They close at 12:30! Really you guys couldn't so better huh? Needless to say we ended up at CF in Walnut Creek, but that's a whole other HORRIBLE review. (let's just say bad bad bad customer service).  Only reason why it gets two stars is because the food is regularly okay and so is the service but we didn't get to that part that night."
Alla B.,"South San Francisco, United States",195,25,1,4.0,9/6/2011,I like the cheesecake factory. It's situated on top of the macys in downtown and if you choose outdoor seating you have a lovely view of union square while you relax on a heated patio. They play lovely toned down jazz music and have a large selection of all kinds of food which is generally delicious (though I recommend splitting it). It is a long wait if you have a large group but for a smaller group (even up to 7) you can be seated within 20 minutes. It's a very relaxing dining experience.
Makenna S.,"Richmond, United States",45,39,3,1.0,4/1/2010,"HOLYSHYT. The WORST dining experience I've ever had was at this restaurant. The BF and I eat at CF back in Sacramento, and we're usually quite pleased. The restaurant itself isn't horrible, albeit a tad overpriced. The last time we were here will prevent me from ever coming back to this location. We went on a Saturday night. We went pre-shopping, around 5:30pm or so, and were told it would be a 45 minute wait, which means 1 1/2 hrs, minimum. We decided to get something small elsewhere, shop, and come back. We returned at 7:30/7:45ish, were told the wait would be the same (it was WAY longer than 45 mins), and went to go fight for a decent place to wait in the lobby. Ok, A.) What the crap is up with them having virtually no seating in the lobby? People are going to have to wait to be seated at a table... slap some benches in there.  B.) It's always so horribly crowded in their poorly layed out lobby that you inevitably feel as though you're in the way. As I was struggling to perch on the base of one of their decorative poles, I looked down just in time to see a ROACH crawl by. As I was forced (by their lack of seating) to stand on an already swollen, injured ankle, that was the point that I wanted to leave. But the BF was hungry and cranky and so was I, so we stayed. When we were FINALLY seated (I had to ask the borderline rude hostesses a few times), we were seated outside. Those sad little heaters they have don't do anything.  We froze our asses off for a good 20 minutes before anyone even came over to acknowledge us. We didn't get drinks, a hello, NOTHING. We sat at the table, literally being ignored, for a good 20 mins before some sweet waiter, taking pity on our souls, stopped by and said, ""I'm not your server but I'll take your order."" Thank you, savior in tacky CF white.  In fact, we had no clue the entire evening who our server was. Random servers and bussers came by to refill drinks and drop off our food (usually to the wrong table), but we never actually got a server. My BF's wine didn't come until our food did (one glass should not take that long).  As usual, food was decent, not great, and overpriced. Service was slow, but that's to be expected when you don't have a server. I'd like to clarify that the servers and bussers were working their behinds off- none of this was in any way their fault, as far as I could tell.  I'm chalking this entire horrible experience up to the management. It was clear that they were painfully understaffed and the staff they had was overworked.  The staff did the best they could to make things better, hostesses aside. LOOK, UNION SQUARE CF: YOU'RE RIGHT BY UNION SQUARE. WITH A ROOF DECK. YOU NEED TO ANTICIPATE THE KINDS OF CROWDS YOU GET. ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.  MANAGEMENT, FIX YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. After the cockroach and being ignored, we'll never be back."
Sonya T.,"Los Angeles, United States",143,112,20,4.0,3/1/2012,"I only came to this location because I wanted to dine on the rooftop patio. It was an hour wait on a Saturday Night, but my bf & I were okay with chilling in Union Square for an hour.  The view was beautiful from our table, and our server provided excellent service. Good and medium-priced food."
John S.,"Buena Park, United States",468,218,72,1.0,3/1/2011,"This location gets REALLY crowded, and in true lame form, they weren't accepting reservations.  What kind of place doesn't honor reservations, especially for a group of 8?!  For our group, they quite rudely quoted me a two to three hour wait time.  How pathetic.  I can't understand or tolerate that kind of brusque rudeness, especially around the holidays.  The food might be decent, but the service is horrible.  GET IT TOGETHER, Cheesecake Factory!  If I ever decide to come back here, I'll update my review."
Viktur C.,"Hayward, United States",2,4,3,3.0,24/9/2011,Just like all Cheesecake Factory resturaunts but this one is the best I've ever been to location wise.The view from the balcony is awesome and overlooks Union Square. The only negative is that it can get really crowded sometimes which can lead to spotty service and loooong waits.  The avocado rolls are my favorite and my girlfriend loves the chicken Madeira.
Leejo J.,"Hayward, United States",3,28,,3.0,23/4/2010,"I like the location of this place and the whole setting of being in the terrace and overlooking the city. Other than that the food was Ok meaning the price is over-rated. Food quality is not the best have a little weak taste to it. I tried their Kobe Burger last time, the burger had no taste to it. I had to add hot sauce to add some taste to it. The place always have an hour wait. I like the crowd in there a lot of well dressed and high class looking party goers.. :) The food is also actually pricier compared to its quality or quantity. I would probably go there for like a special date. I guess its the location that matters. . :D"
John-Michael C.,"Singapore, Singapore",1002,1228,300,3.0,11/11/2008,It's funny to go through the macy's entrance to take the elevator up. On a nice day the view isn't half bad - it's generally windy though. The only really nice thing this spot has going for it is really the location and that it's central to the area so it's convenient to meet up.  I have become fond of the corn tamale things here...I think they are appetizers. And honestly I don't know if they are a dessert or not.  All in all I wouldn't generally come to this branch. It wouldn't be my first choice but I wouldn't shoot the idea down either. I do have a certain level of attachment here. But I'd rather go to another spot around the corner if I could get last minute reservations over at the St. Francis. ;D
Nikhil B.,"San Jose, United States",33,118,4,4.0,23/12/2009,"Location! Location! Location!  That's what sets this restaurant apart from all the other cheesecake factory spots. Tucked away on the 8th floor of the Macy's in Union Square, this location allows great views of union square from behind the giant MACY'S lettering. You can eat either outside or indoors, the tables outside have adjacent heaters to keep the patrons warms.  We came here while the tree was up and there was an ice-skating rink set up next to the tree. This was a particularly clear night as well so our view was absolutely breathtaking. We were told that the wait was going to be 1hr45, but our table was ready in just a little under an hour. No complains there as you can just take the pager and lounge in the furniture and couches section just one floor below.  We just had the cheesecake on this particular night which was as awesome as ever. As for the food, based on experiences at other locations, one should expect very large portions.  To sum up, great location! Same ol' cheesecake food and service."
Aaron S.,"Hamburg, Germany",22,51,3,5.0,18/4/2012,"If you don't like Cheesecake then you are not truly living! True Cheesecake is creamy, smooth, and a bit sweet. All these things you will experience when you have Cheesecake from the world famous Cheesecake Factory. If you are in San Francisco it is a must stop while you are there. They also are known for other specialties such as apple and cherry pie. You can even make a meal out of it! That's right I said a meal! Ok they have a fully functioning restaurant as well so it is not just Cheesecakes but let's be honest you are going there for the Cheesecake!"
Robert F.,"Berkeley, United States",3,20,,3.0,30/5/2012,"If it wasn't for the strawberry cheesecake and the view, it wouldn't be worth the wait"
Aneesh P.,"San Francisco, United States",2,14,1,4.0,22/5/2012,"I love their pastas, and cheesecakes. Only thing is sometimes your host take things for granted. This weekend  we were there for lunch, and ordered stuff from lunch menu. Finally, when it arrived it was the full regular one. These are HUGE potions. So, make sure that you tell them clearly ""LUNCH"". This is probably due to the sheer volume of customers they have but costed us extra $15. Any time past 2pm is good to get in for lunch, so that you don't have to wait in q."
Jay B.,"Los Altos, United States",77,39,22,4.0,12/12/2011,"After attending the Nutcracker I usually take my kids to Union Sq to see the Christmas tree /ice rink and then onto Macy's to see Santa and then The Cheesecake Factory. Make sure during the holiday season to get your name down on the wait list first before you do your Macy's thing. The wait can be an hour or longer. If your not shopping then relax on one of the many plush couches that Macys have on display one floor down the escalator.  I will say this about the Cheesecake Factory. Once you are seated you are pretty much guaranteed to be taken care of by really attentive ,nice, non pushy waitstaff. These guys make the dining experience here a whole lot better. 5 stars to them. Every time I have eaten here I get the best service. As far as the food , I stick with the burgers and fries. It's a huge menu. I'm not a fan of huge menus because it's hard to have good quality control. It's like good diner food.  The cheesecake is light and delicious. I gave this place  4 stars over all. maybe because we make it a part of nutcracker holidays is why I'm partial? I've eaten inside and out side. Outside has a fantastic view of Union Sq. It,s worth the trip if your tired of shopping or sightseeing and want to take in a great view and rest for a while and you don't mind descent diner style food. They have a bar too. and the best part for our family is that it's kid friendly. The worst part is it's REALLY crowded!"
Sue M.,"Dearborn, United States",14,12,,4.0,16/5/2011,"Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait as long as it seems that others have. We had an amazing server and the food was great."
Mike W.,"Washington, DC, United States",37,481,8,5.0,30/6/2011,"I hate admitting that I love this chain restaurant, but I do.  Cheesecake factory, Union Square is very reasonable with a to die for view from their roof top terrace."
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, United States",1078,153,707,4.0,15/11/2008,"Robert the bartender is absolutely worth the wait!!!!  Fast, efficient, and attentive. We are always able to grab a seat at the bar when tying to avoid the typical hour wait. The pink lemonade, passion fruit mojitos, and bikini martinis are a must. Spinach dip,  Santa Fe salad, fish tacos, chipotle chicken pasta dish are our favorites.  As far a cheesecake white raspberry macadamia, Dulce DE luche, chocolate chip cookie dough, brownie sundae cheesecake are just a few of our favs. The best nights to go are Monday and Tuesdays. :)  The french toast at Brunch is also AMAZING!"
Angela T.,"Santa Clara, United States",44,28,23,5.0,23/2/2012,The atmosphere was great.  Eat on the patio for shop'tastic view! I recommend the white chili chicken. It's a little spicy but WOW what a delicious meal.
Samantha R.,"San Francisco, United States",384,336,53,3.0,12/11/2008,"This is perfect for the people that are too lazy to make the extra trek to the food court but still can't help marathon-shopping...you know, the consumers who just keep going up (furinture, bridal registry, shoes, regular clothes, designer clothes, etc) and by the time you've got to the 7th floor they are like, ""I'm hungry..."" I am not a fan of the C-fact. Its like Vegas met up with the Sistine Chapel and said, ""Let's make a restaurant together, and don't forget Sphynxie."" Decor aside, the portions are extremely oversized. However, the dessert menu has a plethora of cheesecake (...shocker) and they are all pretty legit.  As far as locations go, I think this is the only C-fact I would review, because it is unique for one reason...the deck. It overlooks Union Square. It is a nice little city view on a non-rainy day, and I enjoy that aspect of the place.  mmm Oreo Mudslide...."
Crystal S.,"San Francisco, United States",366,104,5,4.0,16/3/2009,"This cheesecake factory is the best cheesecake factory I've been to by far. I've been to many over the State and no one compares to the one in SF. Not only is this restaurant centrally located in the heart of Downtown, it has such an amazing view! The terrace seating overlooks the beautiful Union Square. When it comes to consistency and quality, this Cheesecake factory has beaten all the rest. I've been to other cheesecake factories which food I had to send back... here... I've never had a problem. My recommendations are:  Bistro Shrimp Pasta Jambalaya Pasta Carpaccio Avacado Egg Rolls BBQ Chicken Salad Caramel De Leche Cheesecake Frozen Iced Mango All are great selections and what I order every time I go there!"
Oliver D.,"San Francisco, United States",87,68,58,3.0,12/1/2010,"I NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory before, but had the chance to on New Years Eve! Lets give this place a try...... My first impression as we waited for the elevator to take us up was that this place must be really good if it has its own customer elevator.... AFTER an HOUR WAIT! we were finally seated. ugh!  ""This place better be worth my craving taste buds!"" I ordered the ""Fish and Chips"" and an ""ORIGINAL Mojito"" The Mojito was REALLY good, but my ""Fish and Chips"" was just ORDINARY..... The cheesecake had to wait for another time, because i was too full =( the only highlight of this experience was our waitress! she was patient and personable..... CHEERS!"
