Penelope V.,"Concord, United States",62,77,,3.0,13/2/2012,"I only come to this Cheesecake Factory when my boyfriend's family is visiting SF. I came here last night with a party of 5 adults and 3 babies in high chairs. Maybe it was the weather or maybe it was Sunday, not sure but the wait was not bad at all.. it's usually 30-45 min wait with all the tourists. We told the hostess we needed 3 high chairs, she said she's make it work. We got to our table which was a booth... no high chairs... ummmmmmm... okay... so we had to wait for another table to be cleaned. The waiter brought our bread and some fruit for the kids which was very nice. After the waiter took our order and we settled in with drinks and get to catching up. After a little while we noticed the tables around us were all getting their food.. even though we had been there longer and our party sizes were relatively the same since the kids didn't order anything.  I wanted to order the meatloaf, i just love meatloaf and it's actually not bad here. Instead i tried something different and ordered the pork chops... which were fine except for the apricot glaze. I hate warm fruit... so maybe it really was good.. but I was not a fan. the mashed potatos and the spinach is always good here. Overall.... for a tourist spot, this place is decent... if you don't mind the loud hustle and bustle. I dont come here often but don't mind it the few times I come with visiting relatives. On a regular basis.. not so much."
Ashley P.,"San Jose, United States",132,23,4,5.0,7/1/2012,"I've never had The Cheesecake Factory before this because I was determined to try this location first. I grew up in Fremont and during High School and my friends and I would try and go every time we were in San Francisco but the wait was always just too long. I tried to go again while visiting the city during my college years and alas the wait was too long for us. Finally six years after my first attempt to dine here I finally came here with my boyfriend and his mom during a lunch on a random Tuesday afternoon. SUCCESS!! The view was amazing and we got to sit near the window (not outside because it was too cold). Our waiter was awesome and even hooked us up with some very delicious ""hot sauce"" but I think it was just chili sauce used for their ahi salad or something. I had the Crusted Romano Chicken with Alfredo pasta. SO DELICIOUS!!! I'm wanting to go back soon just for that! My boyfriend got the jambalaya pasta which was good but definitely does not beat his mother's jambalaya. His mom got the orange chicken which was good too. I liked that the portions were huge but I wish their bread basket had some better breads in it, they were too tough for my liking. OOO and I got the red velvet cheesecake which was SO AMAZING! I'm a red velvet girl for sure and it was everything I wanted and more! My boyfriend got the snickers cheesecake and I do not know how it tasted myself because he devoured it before I even got a chance to try a bit, I think he liked it.  We will have to come back again soon."
Yvonnr L.,"San Francisco, United States",107,23,19,4.0,21/3/2012,It's better than before but not exceptional!!! They have a Helthy menu for people that cares about what the eat but I still see everyone ordering the 1000+ cal meals.
Ying F.,"San Francisco, United States",636,342,458,3.0,3/10/2009,All I have to say is  Fried Mac and Cheese Balls.... You'll thank me later. Drools....
Michael D.,"San Francisco, United States",212,168,10,2.0,25/11/2011,"I'm all shook up.  If you're a sucker for views you'll be weak in the knees, but cheesecake lovers beware.  Dense, grainy, and ultra sweet, Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake is a little more ""Vegas Elvis"" and a little less ""Blue Suede Shoes"" Elvis."
Catherine N.,"Oakland, United States",10,61,52,3.0,30/7/2009,"Indeed this destination is quite the tourist attraction, but its a perfect getaway for great cheesecakes.  Its a great treat for my little cousins. They love the sweet cheesecakes and I find the wait to be satisfying, the place is constantly hustling with excitement. Teaches these cousins of mine the virtue of patience!!! And plus, while waiting you can stand outside and stare out at Union Square and the city, the busy come and go atmosphere is quite interesting to observe. The waitress was very polite, humorous and understanding of my cousins (5 and 7). They didn't shy away. So first off we got the Sliders, and the Favorite Appetizers. And that was all we got. It was a lot of appetizers among 2 adults and 2 kids. I didn't even move on to the entrees. By the way, I loved the Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce, it comes with the Avocado Eggrolls. They have awesome sauces. The Spinach and Cheese dip was exquisite. Last of all, halfway through the appetizers it was the big moment for those kids, cheesecake!!! It was pure bliss for them and ME!"
Kimberly Y.,"San Francisco, United States",225,23,89,4.0,18/11/2009,Atmosphere: i love it. it has a nice feel too it. it looks pretty too. if you go there i recommend asking for a booth because those are very comfy. Food: The breadsticks are amazing nice and warm and toasty. The food is okay i would get the pasta or salad if i were you. The cheesecake is amazing. So many flavors to choose from. If you want to eat the cheesecake i recommend sharing a main course with someone because the portions are giant. or take it home.
Bill L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",2,251,,3.0,5/3/2014,"a group of us came here for sunday brunch. there were 8 of us. first disappointment.  they seated us in two booths (of five each).  we pointed to a section of open tables which could have easily accomodated us.  needless to say, they would refuse. During the whole time we were there, no one was seated in the open tables. Now for the most important item - food Ordered calamari for both booths, french toast, santa fe salad, shrimp pasta, cheesesteak, fish taco, mac and cheese, crab salad. Calamari was the best of the lot.  all else was good"
Jim H.,"Castro Valley, United States",165,121,10,3.0,27/4/2010,"This cheesecake factory serve the same food as all the other ones, but for some reason it has an average of 2 hour wait.  Maybe its just the novelty of over looking union square on top of macy's.  However, there are not that many balcony seats here. The food is not bad, better than most chain restaurants, the steak was pretty tender, and the salad portion is huge.  I guess the long wait cause me to deduct a star, seeing that I can drive to the cheesecake factory at corta matea or san jose and will probably get my food faster than if I just waited here.  And all the other ones got better parking lots too! The wait is just not worth it, especially with the horrible SF parking.  Which is why i usually try to weasel out of going to dinner event at this place unless I am allow to be at least an hour late."
T L.,"San Francisco, United States",26,439,383,4.0,16/11/2011,"Love the gumbo, mango raspberry smoothie, and the breadbasket! So much to choose from on menu and the portions are big enough to feed a trucker. If you have enough room don't forget the Tiramisu cheesecake. Minus 1 star for the waiting game but you can go shopping while you wait."
Patrik S.,Sweden,4,13,,5.0,25/4/2012,I had the Godiva chocolate Cheesecake and it was as good as it gets!
Melanie S.,"Livermore, United States",44,15,4,4.0,14/11/2009,"I love the cheesecake factory!! I have eaten at their other chain restaurants and I'm just now making a review.  I've tried almost all their dishes, but my favorite is the lettuce wrap and the orange glazed chicken. Also, you cant go wrong with the free bread appetiser especially the brown one. The portions are also huge (lunch or dinner) I always have to bring home a doggy bag every time i leave. Thus, I always have my cheese cake to go because i don't have enough room in my tummy. ;-( My favorite cheese cake is the tuxedo and recently they just added the red velvet cheese cake....oh yum!!!  The service is great they are always very attentive, at times you may get those sluggish server, but hey....If they want those tips they got to milk it. Oh by the way, you always seem to wait for at least 30-45mins to be seated. But well worth it!  I know that my family and i will always come back again."
Dominique W.,"Lakewood, United States",0,2,,2.0,13/8/2012,"The cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants. But today the service was HORRIBLE! The food wasn't that great and on top of that we waited about 30 minutes for our food. Our waiter at first, Parker, was very attentive made sure we had everything, but when we switched tables our other waitress was not that great simply because she forgot about us and just wouldn't check up enough times. I hope next time my service is better."
Sarah C.,"Sacramento, United States",270,1406,309,4.0,29/8/2009,"My parents and I came here on Thursday. They open at 11 and we probably got there around 11.15am. It wasn't busy at all. We got a nice booth that was by a window. My parents did not want to sit outside under the sun.  Our waitress spent like 2 whole minutes telling us the specials. She was really nice. We ordered two lunch specials, chicken piccata and the miso salmon. My dad ordered the meat loaf. And we got a side order of mash potatoes for my mom. I got a cup of strawberry lemonade and my parents got tea.  She came over with the box of assorted teas and my parents were able to pick. That was a plus. My strawberry lemonade was a bit sour. It would have been perfect if they added some sugar. The bread they gave was really good. We really enjoyed our food. My mom loved the miso salmon and I loved my chicken piccata. We were too full to get dessert but overall our experience was really good.  I am only giving the place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have been here for dinner and they are usually super crowded and really loud. One time, my friend and I were sitting super close to two other parties. That was not fun.  The price is pretty good for the amount of food you get."
Joe V.,"Boston, United States",182,137,3,4.0,10/6/2010,"I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory when I lived back east in Boston with my friend Kris, and other friends as well and out here in S.F. and another location in Palo Alto. The food is a bit pricey, but you get definitely get what you pay for as the portions are HUGE and I HIGHLY recommend getting the Red Velvet cheesecake for dessert. It is orgasmic to eat but not kind on your waistline. Last time we went was in SF on Geary Street in the Macy's Mall and the place was packed, but service was fast and exceptional, and our server was no nonsense. She earned her tip from us and I'd gladly want her to take care of us again. For starters we had the crab wontons, then partner had a turkey mushroom and onion burger, while I the crusty parmesan sandwich which were huge and I barely could finish it all. Overall, this place and food are really good. If you're hungry and have mean appetite, I recommend!"
Karen C.,"Las Vegas, United States",0,4,,4.0,9/8/2012,"My friend and I had dinner here late in the evening on a recent trip to San Francisco.  After some confusion about where the restaurant was located and some very amusing attempts by us to locate it using our smartphones, we realized it was located upstairs in Macy's in Union Square.  We feared they would be closed since it was around 9 pm and a Thursday night but they were open and packed! We asked for first available seating which turned out to be outdoors and perfectly lovely, just a little chilly.  The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is because I felt their directions to us regarding seating were confusing.  When we agreed to sit outside, they did not give us the buzzer and told us to just stand to the side (near the elevators).  There were so many people and waitstaff coming an going that I feared we had gotten lost in the shuffle and would not be called.  After a little arguing with my friend, he assured me that we would be called soon.  And he was right, we were called in about 10 minutes, as soon as they had cleared a table for us.  Had we wanted to sit inside, I'm sure we would have waited much much longer. The night was lovely and foggy, but that's perfect San Francisco.  The view of Union Square was great from the upstairs balcony. We both ordered salmon.  My friend tried the bar-b-que salmon and I had the herbed salmon.  It was wonderful and juicy.  My friend also had a strawberry lemonade which he said was really really good.  You could see the strawberry seeds floating in his glass.  Yum! Unfortunately we were too full to try any cheesecake, which I really wanted my friend to try.  But, maybe next time.  Their portions are large enough that sometimes you need to come to The Cheesecake Factory just for dessert. We would certainly eat here again."
Anh H.,"Oakland, United States",86,41,6,4.0,11/7/2011,"the bait: heavenly baked brown bread w/ butter, crisps, yet very delicate buffalo blasts, mahi mahi grilled fished tacos and scrumptious strawberry martinis.  until these items are completely taken off their menu and despite my best efforts to abstain from this place, i'm hooked. i continue to tolerate the ridiculously large crowds as you enter the 8th floor, guaranteed 30-60 minute wait and hit or miss parking.  the conclusion:  i guess the appetizer, entree and drinks are worth the while."
Randy W.,"Santa Rosa, United States",17,35,3,3.0,2/11/2009,"We knew this was a tourist trap before we set foot in the door, though my sig other was exhausted and she opted for the Cheesecake Factory in a moment of delirium. I tried to talk her into someplace else, really! It's SF for heaven's sake and we're locals, though we were playing the part of tourists that day.  We came around lunch time on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all for an indoor table. The wait was 20 minutes for an outside table. The service was really good actually, though they forgot the cheese on my omelet. Without making a fuss and even saying I didn't mind the lack of cheese, they comp'd my plate entirely and I didn't pay a penny for my dish. The eggs still weren't very good, and without cheese it really wasn't all that good, but it was okay. My gf had a salad that was super junky. The bread that was brought to the table was overly yeasty and was making me sick to my stomach just smelling it. Ewww. We were surrounded by worn out tourists. It would have been more pleasant had we sat outdoors. Do yourself a favor and walk one to two blocks off the square for better, authentic food.  2.5 stars."
Chantay X.,"San Pablo, United States",15,130,18,2.0,26/2/2010,"I don't know how I feel about this place. I really don't think I've gotten a chance to get a good feel for it. I went the first time some years back on my birthday. Me and a friend sat at the bar. I ordered the chicken ""littles"" (little fried boneless pieces of chicken) it was decent enough, well seasoned and the portion was huge! It was just an okay experience. I went again last weekend for a friend's birthday and wanted to try the jambalaya pasta (sounds sooo good) but by the time dinner came I wasn't very hungry so didn't get to try that. Plus we were heading to a show afterwards so I didn't wanna have to carry any food bag around. So I ordered a small plate which was the little crabcake balls. It came with six balls and a little (literally) dipping sauce. It was so doughy it wasn't the most pleasant texture. I really didn't like it very much at all. Definitely wish I had gotten something else. I also hate the crowdedness of the place. People bumping into you and not saying excuse me and getting all up in your personal space. I wanted to push some folk. But I didn't. Also my party had to ask for bread and refills and more butter. Not cool. And I ordered a drink at the bar (martini) it was $9 and the bartender didn't even fill it up to a decent level.  Also the elevator was jacked up so we had to take the thousand mile escalator ride up to the top. And at the end of our meal one elevator was working and the line was crazy to get on it so we had to be escorted through the kitchen and all through the back way to get out. Macy's was closed so we couldn't take the escalator. It was a freakin' journey and could have been pretty dangerous if there had been a fire other emergency. This place needs to get it together."
Bleep S.,"Tucson, United States",273,788,1032,4.0,26/10/2010,I can only speak for the plain cheesecake topped with strawberries. Indescribably delicious....
