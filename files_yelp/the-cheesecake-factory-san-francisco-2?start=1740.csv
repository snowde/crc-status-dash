Eugen X.,"San Francisco, United States",2,5,,3.0,30/5/2012,"Today I went here for lunch with a group of 4 including me. I had the chicken picatta ,  the noodles came a little cold when I got it but the sauce was good. My friend had the build your own omelet and she said it was good. friend say the Tomato Basil pasta was really tasty and the sauce was just tangy enough. Four cheese pasta was lacking in sauce where the cheese overpowers everything she had.  PORTIONS ARE HUGE and when you get pasta u can have free fresh parmesan grated on top.  3/5 PS : waits are really long"
Darius A.,"San Bruno, United States",29,620,34,3.0,7/12/2011,This cheesecake factory is probably one of the worse ones I have been to. Everything came out cold. I really like the ones in Marin and Palo Alto but this one plain sucked. More of a tourist spot.
Will B.,"San Jose, United States",21,125,2,4.0,27/5/2010,"Had dinner here on 5/22 around 8:00PM with my wife and adult grand-daughter.  We had over an hour's wait, but it WAS Saturday night and in the midst of the prom season, so no complaint here. I had the Steak Diane - excellent, my wife had her favorite - and messy - Thai Wrap and Britt had a chicken/pasta dish.  All of the meals were very, very good and the service even better.  Our waitperson Olivia was attentive and took care of all of our dining needs.  It's not an easy place to get to - but the Union Square Garage across the street is available with easy entrance/exit.   Would definitely recommend this location."
Alexis B.,"San Francisco, United States",118,393,2,3.0,19/11/2008,"Go in starving, order an appetizer, leave happy. If you aren't starving then prepare to be feed for a week with the doggie bag they give you. You definitely get your monies worth here. And while the food isn't AMAZING, it isn't crap either. And it really is all about the patio. Everything about the interior of this place makes me think they are joking. But they aren't. They are totally serious with the tack.  But in the end there really is no reason to wait in line for 90 minutes for a table unless you have absolutely nothing else to do and are waiting for the patio. Go somewhere that is an experience worth having."
gEe C.,"Hayward, United States",83,105,48,3.0,5/12/2009,"If you come here to eat at this location you go for the outside seating on the rooftop patio, ya hear?   If the weather permits though.  Because, the view is just spectacular!  And I mean it.  I prefer grubbin' during lunch time because it's not all too busy and you don't have to deal with all the people.  But, everything else about Cheesecake Factory is the same.  Great food, big portions, bomb cheesecake, and the prices are alright.   Oh, and you can go downstairs and shop at Macys right after.  :)"
Tomas C.,"San Francisco, United States",24,17,,3.0,30/11/2011,"Wow... Loved the dynamite shrimp, but it was more like sparkler shrimp. The shrimp were great but left me wanting a lot more heat. Good value at 5 dollars. We moved onto the spicy meat pizza after and were much less than impressed. Not only was it not spicy but at 11 dollars it was kind of like wtf.. We might as well gotten two more orders of shrimp. All in all probably just ordered poorly, but the pizza was less than stellar. Atmosphere was noisy and the music was loud. Pretty buildings but hardly worth the price tag."
Philip D.,"San Francisco, United States",22,85,,4.0,7/7/2009,"For those of you who think you are too good for a 'chain restaurant', all I have to say is lighten up!  So what if it's a chain??  The decor is fun, the energy is lively (even if you do have to wait a long time - get a drink at the bar!)  The outdoor patio is a great place to eat, relax, and watch the city.  And food is actually really tasty.  I'm a big fan of the Chipotle Chicken Pasta.  And while I normally don't get cheesecake, we had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake the last time and it was to die for.  So rich, tasted like a rich chocolate mousse. The place is lively and fun.. that's why I go there often.  Probably those who are too good for chains are no where near lively and fun in their own right."
May B.,"Los Altos, United States",138,116,,3.0,7/2/2012,"The portions are HUGE. Even when I order the salads, (who gets full on salads??), well this place will make you full even on salad!! Make sure you don't stuff yourself and leave room for dessert. Their cheesecake is pretty good - again, take home box please :)"
Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, United States",212,574,10,4.0,3/2/2009,"I'm a little biased as I always LOVED the cheesecake factory during college in Seattle (and many friends were waiters there), but honestly where else can you go with SUCH a diverse menu?! This location is no exception (although you do have to brave the crowds of tourists in union square to get there--and of course this place is filled with them too!), although there will inevitably be a long wait if you come on a weekend!  The view is amazing, although sadly the last time i was here it was too cold to sit outside... The food and drinks are both great (come here just for drinks a couple times, as their cocktail menu is equally diverse!), and if you're desperate and sick of waiting for a real table, you can try to grab a bar table when/if someone vacates to eat dinner at! The bills can add up fairly quickly, but service is always great, and the food is what you'd picture, american (even regarding the asian etc foods, its all a very american version i'd say), but rarely a disappointment!"
Ronnel C.,"San Jose, United States",141,275,21,3.0,8/10/2011,I wish they seated us quicker but hey! People love this place so whatever!
Sheila W.,"San Francisco, United States",73,30,26,4.0,1/2/2010,"I try to avoid chains esp. in San Francisco but there are some exceptions, like In&Out (on the road), Osha Thai, Pete's, etc.  The Cheesecake Factory has one particular dish that I am mad for which is the Miso Salmon.  It is delicious!  Their portions are def. American, and most likely there will be left overs to savor later.   The fourth star is really because the best part of this restaurant is the outdoor patio (with heat lamps) at roof top of Macy's overlooking Union Square - perfect for sipping cocktails.  My mom did point out the feeding pigeons on the tables left vacant, and that she didn't think it was very sanitary but this doesn't bother me since I'm not gonna eat directly off the table."
Annie T.,"San Francisco, United States",505,653,11,3.0,7/6/2009,Sit at the bar... you'll get quicker service if it's crowded. Best item on the menu is the blue cheese stuff olive dirty martini. You can skip everything else. :)
Christina C.,"San Jose, United States",1,4,4,1.0,12/2/2015,"There is a host there with a tattoo on his arm that was being really rude towards my friends and I. First of all, the lady told us that it was going to be a 45 minute wait for a table seating outside on the rooftop. We were okay with that and they were going to text us when our table was ready because we were going to shop around union square while we wait. We came back 50 minutes later to check on our table and they told us it was going to be another 5-10 minute wait. We waited at the waiting room that they had for another hour. When my friend finally received the text that the table was ready, he went to go check in but another host was there. It was a young man with a tattoo on his arm who was giving my friend attitude saying he texted us 5 minutes ago and gave our table away. My friend barely received the text 2 minutes ago and they already decided to give our table away instead of walking around and calling our group. We were literally just a few steps away from them. It's not that hard to walk over and tell us our table is ready and how are you going to give away our table when you barely just texted us. What if we were shopping at a different store and recieved the text? That would have taken probably 10 minutes for us to arrive back at the Cheesecake Factory. In this case, we were already at the restaurant waiting so there was no need to give us attitude and give our table away. I don't understand what kind of service this location was giving, but it was totally unfair. We ended up hungrily waiting for 2hrs. We did not even receive an apology from him for his stupidity. I didn't get a chance to get his name. However, our waiter/server turned our day around. He was the only one who apologized and tried to make our evening better. It just shows how bad it is when the waiter has to apologize for the host. I am really disappointed with the service we received from the host during my visit. My friends and I will not be coming back to this location ever again. We will be telling our friends not to come to this location."
Christina X.,"Millbrae, United States",249,46,12,4.0,14/11/2011,"It's a first come first serve basis here. There's always a lot of people here, so come early. Sundays arent that crowded usually. I love how they have a lot of variety in their menus; a lot to choose from, especially the appetizers! It's convenient that the furniture section of Macy's is right down the escalator. You can relax on a sofa until your table's ready! The service here is really good. The  bread here is yummy too. The entrees here are decent, depends on what you order. The cheesecakes are delish, obviously; so many different kinds too! 4 stars."
"Wong, D.","San Francisco, United States",18,28,,3.0,25/6/2009,I haven't visited in awhile but I've eaten at this location several times. I'd say waiting for a table with a large party can be annoying but the large portions they give you once you get seated and have your meal are mostly worth it. I stick with the usual type dishes such as a sandwich or teriyaki chicken. I don't tend to go with the more exotic menu items. The service and food have been above average on the ocassions I've eaten there.
Karen W.,"Austin, United States",117,85,21,4.0,10/8/2011,Gotta love consistently good food in ample portions. Great spot to see all the goings on in Union Sq.
Mike L.,"Oakland, United States",29,526,51,2.0,17/12/2011,"This place is like a machine, with lots of stuff and lots of waiting.  It's gotten to be somewhat of a joke.  A mass of people and a two hour wait.."
Shea S.,"Milpitas, United States",1,24,4,4.0,1/5/2012,Love Love Love....the view is awesome. Its too crowded though we had to wait half an hour which I didnt really enjoyed because I was so hungry..that's why I left out one star!Over all great food and I came home full.
Ben M.,"Fox Island, United States",76,6,,2.0,27/4/2011,"Let me start off by saying two stars is generous. The absolute biggest problem with our experience here was the long wait and horrible service at the front desk.  When we arrived, we were told we would have an hour wait. We thought it was a little long, but we decided we needed to run over to the Apple store anyway, so we did it. We left, came back half an hour later. We asked, and were (rudely) told that it would be twenty minutes longer. Forty minutes later, our buzzer finally went off - the total wait was about an hour and ten minutes. We were then told to wait to the left of the counter, which we did, for five more minutes. The waitress came and took us halfway to our table, when she stopped and told us to wait in the hallway because she had forgotten what table she was taking us too. When she came back, she led us to our table, where we were again asked to wait while it was cleaned. Finally, we were able to sit down.  The bad part was over. From here on, we found that the waitress was friendly, and the food (pepperoni pizza) was fairly good. However, we would absolutely never return and be asked to wait an hour and ten minutes.  As a side note, I hope you're not claustrophobic, because you are obliged to cram into the elevator with fifteen other people for the ride up to the top of Macy's. Every elevator is full, and you often spend five or more minutes waiting for another elevator."
Colleen W.,"New York, United States",559,251,101,3.0,23/3/2009,"Your average food chain. Simple dishes priced around 900% up for profit. I had Everlyn's Favorite  Pasta for about $13-14. Nothing fancy. Oiled penne pasta, sun-dried tomatoes dunked in olive oil, a few specks of olive, pine nuts, like 2-3 artichoke hearts, a few small chunks of eggplant... very simple. The Jambalaya looked very appetizing... Mmm...Service was great! The cheesecake wasn't to die for, but it was decent. We had the Lemon Rasperry, Tuxedo, and the new Blueberry cheesecake. The tuxedo as a bit sweet, the lemon rasperry tasted a bit too generic, and the blueberry... a bit too generic too. The Cheesecake Factory would be a nice place to go to on a warm summer night-- with your best buddies. Sit on the balcony and gaze out at my beautiful San Francisco. Gorgeous."
