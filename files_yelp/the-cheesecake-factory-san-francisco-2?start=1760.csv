Tim S.,"San Francisco, United States",33,43,25,3.0,27/9/2009,"Came here for a birthday dinner with some friends. I really don't understand the ridiculous wait time. Most of the food isn't that great, but some are satisfying. I've been here many, many times and service as well as the quality of food has gone down. To start off, an estimated three hour wait time for a party of twelve. They took down the reservation at 6:15, but one of us decided to break up into two tables of six. That cut down the wait time to about an hour. When we got our table, it was pretty obvious we could have fit 12 people. We got a corner spot, with an empty table next to us. Food: For appetizers, we got fried calamari (good) and I tired a tuna civiche dish that one of my friend's ordered  (good).  I got the Chicken Marsala. I haven't gotten this in sometime so I decided to try it again. I now remember why I don't order this. The bow tie pasta was under-cooked while the chicken was somewhat dry, but I overcame that by soaking it in the Marsala sauce. One of my other friends also complained that his pesto angel hair pasta was hard and pretty dry. I prefer Buca's chicken Marsala (a bit juicier, as well as bigger portions). One friend got a Kobe burger, good size but it looks like they've tone down the portion of fries considerably. I wonder how their burgers sell once the Burger Bar opens up downstairs.  Another friend got the Meatloaf. It tasted like meatloaf, somewhat over seasoned, but nice portion. Service was alright. It was busy as usual, but no specials were mentioned, nor any recommendations and we had to ask for some drinks to be refilled. Dirty utensils didn't help either."
April Z.,"San Francisco, United States",17,74,5,4.0,15/1/2010,"I guess I can understand the 3 star average rating. It's a chain restaurant...it's known for the actual cheesecakes and not the  food...service is mediocre...there's long waits for popular meal times...etc. But I've actually always been a fan of this venue. The food is pretty darn decent for a price like theirs, and there's a LARGE variety! Anything from salads, to pasta, to salmon, to steak, to burgers - anything anyone in your party might want to eat. Sure that sounds a bit all over the place... but it's a chain restaurant meant to accommodate many people at a time! There's low-calorie meals, many different kinds of drinks (which also taste pretty good! just kind of expensive...$10 for a sangria??), andddd dessert that's not cheesecake. I only get their tiramisu for dessrt (not the tiramisu cheesecake) and the serving is big and yummy.  I always try to get my friends to come with me when we're looking for a place to eat lunch around downtown, but I rarely succeed. :("

Osama Q.,"Sunnyvale, United States",9,24,10,4.0,14/4/2012,"This was a great experience. My best one in san francisco yet. I went on Thursday early evening and the place was already full. There was a queue but not very long. I didnt have to wait  more than 8-10 minutes to get a table which was in the patio. I ordered the avocado eggrolls for appetizer and kobe burger for the main course and ofcourse for desert, the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries and cream. everything was very good in taste. The waiters were friendly, attentive and quick. I didnt have to wait more than expected for the food to arrive and it was still hot when it arrived. All in all a great experience. Can't wait to go again!"
Cindy N.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,4.0,10/4/2012,"Love this location! On sunny days or warm nights I always opt to sit outside, the view is beautiful! Food is always good, LOVE their spinach and cheese dip."
Jeff C.,"Orem, United States",115,230,37,2.0,25/7/2011,2 things that are good. The view and the cheesecake. I had a very bland hamburger. The portions are huge!Overpriced mostly a tourist trap. Go if you want but in San Francisco there are many better opportunities.
cc c.,"San Francisco, United States",0,133,,1.0,7/10/2012,"went to the The Cheesecake Factory today sunday,wanted to sit outside, there was 3 tables with people in them.,thats about 90 percent empty,went to the front desk to get a table and was told its all full up,,and there would be a 15 minute wait, what the hell the place is empty and they want you to wait 15 minutes,i left and got a sandwich and cup of coffeee some where else for 8 dollars the same price Cheesecake Factory  charges for a small slice of cheese cake with out a drink i wll not go back"
Robert M.,"Merced, United States",2,42,4,3.0,23/2/2014,"Always a wait, cheesecake are amazing as one would guess.  Can't go wrong with the Cheesecake,the menu is a book and the food is what you would expect from a chain.  The service has always been sub par for us."
Susanne M.,"San Diego, United States",11,123,,3.0,5/9/2009,"2 stars for the food (It's really nothing special people, don't be so easily fooled by their gi-normous portions), but gets an extra star for the LOCATION. The terrace is BEAUTIFUL to be on. I don't think you even have to be a customer to go on it, so just take the elevator up and enjoy the view of Union Square. Came here one afternoon for a late lunch, and had an Asian-pear martini (I said it was a *late* lunch :-)... which was yummy... and a quick meal. Portions are normally too large, but they have a lunch menu (I think available up until 3 or 4pm) which is cheaper and smaller in size. Still a bit big for my liking, but I didn't feel bad leaving just a little bit un-eaten. Overall, too expensive and nothing special, and the overall service is kind of crappy, but would be a good place if you have a group of people who all want to eat something different, and if you want to pay $12 for a yummy drink to a bartender who doesn't seem to care you exist."
Talal A.,"San Francisco, United States",10,4,,5.0,4/4/2012,great view .. great food .. great service ... never had to wait more than 5 minutes in week days ofcource love it
Miss H.,"San Francisco, United States",262,324,262,4.0,14/1/2009,"Although the wait at this location is RIDICULOUS (even at 10pm for dessert on a weekday), it's still my favorite because it's in good ol' SF! I've been here 5 million times but only recently was I able to finally sample their cheesecakes! Between 11 people, we shared the key lime, kahlua, mudpie, fresh strawberry, and black & white cheesecakes. $5 a person (incl. tip), it's sooooo worth it since you can try different ones without getting sick of a single flavor."
Stacy Y.,"San Francisco, United States",25,68,16,2.0,30/8/2009,"It's a chain restaurant that I would put on par with Chili's, TGI Fridays or Outback. The taste of their food is generic and well honed to their target of suburban tourist.  If it weren't for the location of this place it would simply be dull and predictable.  Put it on top of Macy's in the middle of Union Square with outdoor seating many stories up and you have a tourist attraction."
Sandy L.,"San Francisco, United States",232,141,29,3.0,30/8/2011,Pasta is not that good here but it's call the cheesecake factory for a reason. Cheesecake is good and i think the calamari is also very good. Nice place to have birthday parties tho.
Dominique W.,"Pleasanton, United States",62,43,10,2.0,29/8/2011,Service kind of sucked our waiter brought out a dirty glass twice. Dirty utensils. Food was ok. Much better in Pleasanton. Our waiter did start doing good until she walked by and I said no tip. Then she became hands on...
Fouad M.,"San Diego, United States",13,228,3,4.0,10/10/2011,I went there with family and friends during our trip to San Francisco few months ago. We decided to stop by to get some drinks. The place was packed and we had to wait for few minutes to get a table. The server was very friendly and professional. She took our order and brought us drinks fairly quickly. We had few rounds of drinks before we continued with our tour of the city.
Sarah S.,"Sacramento, United States",100,181,40,2.0,4/11/2008,HMMMM *OVERPRICED *OVERRATED *OVERPACKED (not a word I KNOW...) This place is filled to the brim with tourists. The only good thing is that the portions are huge and that there buffalo salad is ORGASMIC... besides that I've made better cheese myself.  IN REVIEW..... get the buffalo salad to go and have an orgasm in the comforts of your own home. (2 stars for the fact that they make one of my favourite salads and the ahi on the appetizer menu is pretty dank too)
Maria D.,"Denver, United States",301,1115,3,3.0,8/8/2008,"How much do I enjoy drinking outside? Putting up with the wait and with this rude crowd is how much.  Stick to the chain restaurant strategy: girly drinks, appetizers, free bread, dessert. Lest you end up with a totally overcooked burger, as I did."
Ivan L.,"Santa Ana, United States",407,411,30,4.0,25/7/2011,"Uhhh its a cheesecake factory, I would call it a midscale place since its a chain and its not black tie, although somewhat expensive... the food is generally consistent and service is the same. I'm not sure but if you've never been to a Cheescake factory start there and explore some other places on yelp =X... I will say that if you are lucky enough to find a cheescake factory that will make you the off item (its was on their old menu) food that is a mashed potato omelette get it...,. it is freaking glutenous and wonderful."
