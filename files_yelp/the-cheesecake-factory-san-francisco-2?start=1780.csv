Dee-Dee S.,"La Jolla, San Diego, United States",113,374,5,5.0,18/1/2009,"Wow.  Where do I start with this place? I love The Cheesecake Factory, although in LA, the locations are so far apart and sparse.  Whenever I go to San Francisco I always have to stop here for the view and the food.   I went there with my cousin on a Monday night at 6pm, the wait was OK (although I anticipated it since this place is so popular), and the service was incredible.  We dined al fresco and had the view of Union Square...so awesome!  We both ordered salads and were impressed by the size of them; my Chinese Chicken Salad was so huge I had to take it home. =P I'll continue stopping by here every time I go to the city."
Bebe E.,"San Francisco, United States",239,107,7,2.0,19/7/2008,"What's with all the non-sanfranciscans wanting to eat the the Cheesecake Factory?  Sure, it's a nice, fancy-looking restaurant.  But it's always crowded! The wait the last time I went was about an hour and a half.  Good thing my date was very charming company or else I would have said ""F*** that"".  So we got our buzzer thingie, and made our way down to the Starbucks on Powell St.  Then took a romantic *sigh* walk around Union Square... then I spilled coffee on my new white top. Klutz.  ARGH! We both laughed it off, and headed back to the restaurant.   We got our pager at 7 pm.  We were not seated until 9.  Actually about 9:10 to be exact.   The food is meh.  Nothing you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else in the city. I'm not a dessert person, so I really cannot tell you about the Cheesecake.  But I'm sure you can't go too wrong with the stuff."
Tiffany T.,"San Francisco, United States",251,39,14,4.0,26/9/2008,"I was originally thinking about giving this place 3-stars. But.. I gave them an extra star for the yummy cheesecake I had the other night. I do like this place because they close late. I don't like this place because you can't come here during dinner hours and not expect to wait 2 hours for a table!  So this time, the bf and I were smart. =) We went to catch the 740 showing at Metreon, got outta the theaters around 9 something, then walked our way over to Cheesecake factory and got a table in no time, no wait. That's the way I like it, NO WAIT DAMMIT!! Anywaysss.... Since their food portions are too large for me to consume all by myself, we decided to share, so that we can end off the night with a slice of cheesecake. Ordered an appetizer, entree, and cheesecake, which I haven't eaten for a very long while now to think about it.  - Factory nachos with spicy chicken - pretty good; I would probably order that again if I come back with a group of friends. But you can get nachos at any Mexican joint in SF - Farfelle chicken with roasted garlic (?) - ehhh.. I wasn't in the mood for pasta, but this dish was okkk... - Limited edition 30th Anniversary cheesecake - yuuummmm!! this was probably the only thing I was satisfied with throughout the night. A layer of original cheesecake, then another layer of chocolate cake (x2). Totally satisfied my sweet tooth. =D I'm usually not a very big fan of franchise restaurants, other than BJs. Cheesecake Factory would probably be a second or third choice. I'm in the mood for cheesecakes. I see that Zanzes over on Ocean Ave has pretty rad ratings. Maybe I'll try that place and let you guys know how that goes. I'm out!"
Michelle C.,"Rio Vista, United States",0,27,1,2.0,17/3/2015,"We have always loved The Cheesecake Factory. We usually go to the Walnut Creek location. Our first impression of the SF location was not so great. We stepped out of the elevator and we're not sure where to go. We walked up to 2 people at what turns out was the bakery. They never even looked at us. We stood there for a couple minutes when a man walked by who was obviously a manager or something, by the way he was dressed and giving directions.  He also walked by us. No eye contact. We eventually realized where we should be on our own. Call us stupid. But it doesn't change the fact that the awesome helpful friendly service we are used to in WC is lacking at this location. But then again it's San Francisco. They have so much continuous business that service isn't a priority. Our server Max was decent. The food however was a disappointment. The Italian was more like a turkey sandwich with a thin slice of the other meats that were un-tastable. The roast beef dip was so full of gristle we had to spit a bunch of it out. I won't eat at this location again."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, United States",119,374,19,5.0,10/8/2013,long wait for a table but worth the memories.
guess w.,"Pleasanton, United States",0,86,3,3.0,10/3/2010,This Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. The location is sorta weird - on the top floor at Macy's. Odd. The food is pretty much the same as the other chains. As long as the wait isn't a bizillion hours - as it usually is - then it's a - ok with me.
Brock H.,"San Francisco, United States",64,52,,2.0,21/12/2008,"Do yourself a huge favor- if you come to San Francisco, eat somewhere you can only dine when you come here! The Cheesecake Factory is the ultimate in cheesy chain restaurants. The menu is way too big, the food is of poor quality (and you can tell it's all mass-produced), and usually it's just full of tired, grumpy tourists. Maybe if you're PMS-ing or just in need of some serious sugar/fat/calories, you can come for a slice of cheesecake. But if you do, you have to get the dulce de leche one. It's actually pretty good. Trust the name of this joint. It's The CHEESECAKE Factory. Please, please don't come here for anything else. Discouraging facts: -There is always a huge wait and the buzzers only work on the eighth floor. Hm, no browsing the furniture department, I guess. -Right around the corner is Crepe o Chocolate. Try having a sandwich there! It's fresh, delicious, and the same price (or cheaper!). -The portions are HUGE. Do you really want to carry left-overs around with you for the rest of the day? (Assuming you're a tourist, here to shop.) Need I say anything more?"
Hasham Y.,"Philadelphia, United States",60,256,,3.0,5/7/2009,"this place always have a 1 hour wait unless you come after 9:30pm. Patio seating in summer over looking Union square is definitely worth it. On my recent visit i tried there salmon ( bbq) and it was delicious. I don't remember seeing ti before so it has to be there new offering as other wise i was missing out On different occassions i have tried crab cake sandwich, shrimp sandwich and tuna salad and have always left very contended. It is defintiely a bang for your buck"
TJ B.,"San Francisco, United States",39,88,28,3.0,5/7/2011,"Pros:  Crazy cool spot and view. Fried macaroni and cheese balls.-These are wickedly delish. Dulce de leche cheesecake-the best cheesecake on the menu. With that said, Most of the menu options are either bland or too heavy to eat. Everything is just average faire. Nothing spectacular. The spot is nice for afternoons and warmer days but on usual S.F. days, its way too cold. Not to mention, the birds hovering over head are a tad annoying.  All in all, this spot is more for tourists."
Michelle D.,"Hayward, United States",19,125,116,4.0,16/11/2008,"i absolutely recommend eating outside on the balcony around dusk, preferably with a hot date. its really quite refreshing to just kick back, relax and enjoy a semi candle lit dinner (BTW, the BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA is wonderful) the skyline of the city lights up around you and you can watch people skating below at the skating rink.  ps. its mandatory you eat cheesecake while you're there...no matter how stuffed you are! they have the nice selection."
Steve N.,"Brentwood, United States",199,453,403,5.0,27/8/2008,"The wait is long, but worth it.  I've been to 2 other locations, but none were 8 stories over Union Square!  The outside seating and view alone are worth it to me. Also, the Lemon Raspeberry cheesecake is a must have.  Don't say you've been to CF until you've had this. Don't do it! The drinks are expensive.  I'm learning this is more and more common these days.  So, I've decided to go in knowing I'm paying for the drink and everything I can see while I drink it.  That's what I'm paying for.   I won't buy $10 drinks to stand in YOUR living room and you wouldn't either.  Get it? The food can be hit or miss.  Nobody's perfect, but CF is fairly consistent in serving their best items without any problems.  The Chicken Piccata is amazing and something we always get together.  The Steak Diane is also a top choice for my wife and me.  I will say that the very extensive menu is not all great foods, so ask the server what to stay away from.  That move saved us one time, so don't be afraid.  After all, it's your meal. And yes, tourists go there.What would SF be without tourists??  So, if you're a resident or local, get over yourself.  Act like you looked into visiting a place like this and plan for it!  I put my name in for the 2 hours wait, then took my gorgeous wife over to Victoria's Secret and had some fun there for a bit.  Then we walked, talked, and held hands in and around Union Square.  Then we shopped for sexy lingerie at Macy's together.  Then we went back to wait with 20 MINUTES left.  It is what you make of it, my friends.  I love going here.  Bring some cheese with you if you're just gonna whine about it!"
Sarah S.,"Oakland, United States",13,108,,4.0,1/7/2009,I actually like this place.  Yes the wait is FOREVER long but at least the service is fast and the staff is nice. The food is not outstanding but it's good and the potions are big that fit their price just right. You just have to understand that any place in the city that is in Union Square is going to be super touristy and busy.  So go on a week day for an early lunch!
Melissa N.,"Bay Area, United States",34,84,39,4.0,14/9/2008,"Cheescake Factory will always be a favorite spot for me, no matter what. The food is the same no matter which restaurant you are at - consistency is very important. To top that off - the cheesecake is to die for. All of them. Every single one. Now, granted, I've never had ALL of them...but from experience, I think I can say that they serve some dame rockin cheesecake. They also serve some other great dishes. I've eaten many different things from the Cheescake Factory and they never seem to disappoint me - EVER. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the bread they serve first and foremost when you get there, and I have always had really decent service. Nothing to jump up and down about, but good service.  Visited the C.F. in the city this last weekend for the 100th time (jk) and had a really great time - EXCEPT  I unfortunately had to help a horrified mother while her son got sick and puked at the table. Now, realistically, everyone should/could have helped this little man, but no...I was the only person to get up from my table, run over and shove a plastic bag under his face. He had been puking into a plastic cup, while his mom was tending to her other, younger child. It was rough. I felt so horrified for her, and she was MORTIFIED! Gold star for me! The sad thing, is that none of the staff came over to help her...I was a little upset about that. Other than all of this, I had a relatively nice experience - luckily, my inner mom (no I'm not a mom yet) kicked in and I was able to help a woman in need. Boo to everyone else who sat on their ass and WATCHED!"
simon c.,"San Francisco, United States",31,45,,3.0,26/2/2012,"Food is great. Service is decent but the wait... well you get the point.  The view from the balcony is amazing... really awesome for a 3rd + date. Like all Cheesecake factories they don't skimp on the proportions. Overall good restaurant... that is if you want to wait, and I hate waiting."
Jessica R.,"San Francisco, United States",105,371,269,4.0,18/7/2010,"One of my favorite restaurants.. Sorry if it sounds like a story rather than a review.. I took it from something I wrote a long time ago with a few edits. Three and a half years ago, my boyfriend asked to take me for an early birthday dinner. We went to Cheesecake Factory that resided on the top floor of Macy*s, where the outside terrace overlooked San Francisco's Union Square, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany & Co, Levi's, Niketown, etc. We waited to get seated and for dinner I got fettuccine alfredo (never again) but I can't quite remember what my boyfriend got. We ate dinner, and I was too full to eat a cheesecake but our waitress told me that we could not leave Cheesecake Factory without getting a cheesecake so I ordered one anyway. While we waited for our cheesecakes, my boyfriend asked, ""Are we getting anywhere?"" And I answered with a yes. Afterwards, he let me know that he was going to use the restroom to be polite, and came back in thirty seconds. I did not think much of it, I thought to myself, ""He is a guy, what do you expect?"" Finally, our cheesecakes came out. Mine had the words, ""will you be my girlfriend?"" around the cheesecake. I was totally dumbfounded because our waitress ended up giving me his [strawberry] cheesecake while he had mine [oreo cheesecake], and initially I read it too fast that I thought it had said ""happy birthday girlfriend?"" I was like, ""happy birthday girlfriend? I think she gave us the wrong cheesecakes."" ""Read it again."" my boyfriend said.  I can't believe that was three and a half years ago, already. We still come here when we have the chance, it's nice to eat outside during a nice day with a bit of a breeze. If you're only coming here for the cheesecake, you HAVE to try the Godiva cheesecake, it's to DIE for! Especially if you love chocolate! So yummy. One thing you must know, the wait is extremely long but once you've waited for a good 30 minutes to an hour for seats, you'd be hungry by the time so come full with food already in your system because the wait will make you HUNGRY. Or you can come with an empty stomach and starve yourself for the next half hour or so before getting seated. After this review, I think I want to visit soon for that Godiva cheesecake, nomz!"
Jade N.,"Honolulu, United States",460,284,791,4.0,29/5/2011,"Plain and simple.  My sisters, cousin, and I were walking around and I was craving for the Dulce de Leche cheescake.  Yes....we went there to order two slices to bring back to our hotel.  The wait was worth it.  LOL.  The wait in the elevator and the wait to get the damn cheesecake....all for my cravings :)"
Narina A.,"Los Angeles, United States",146,154,6,3.0,4/11/2008,"If I go to Cheesecake Factory for a quick bite, I'm definitely splitting a meal with a friend because the portions are HUGE! I haven't decided if it's a good thing or not..hmm. A small Ceaser salad can be your whole dinner. In fact, it was my dinner once, and we're talking about a ""small"" Ceasar salad. Yikes! For those who complain that it's always crowded, well, think about, it's located at Union Square!!! And on a Saturday or Friday night (heck, even Thursdays), of course it'll be crowded. Lunch time is a breeze though. I honestly don't expect much from Cheesecake Factory, except to provide me with a candle if I'm sitting outside at nine o'clock at night (apparently they don't have enough candles). If I'm out downtown and just feel like getting a quick bite to eat, Cheesecake Factory is just fine, no biggie. But just that, nothing fancy. On the down side, the restaurant does not really live up to its title. I'm not really a fan of their cheesecakes because I feel as though they put a lot of junk (aka additives) to make it sweet. However, the tiramisu is not bad, though I've had better.  Lastly... I see tourists at the Cheesecake Factory sometimes and I can't help but wonder; of all the different restaurants in San Francisco, why come to CF? I live in SF and I rarely go to CF. It's a beautiful city with a LOT of various type of cuisine. Don't be afraid to try something new. Explore!"
Max H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,30,,3.0,21/2/2012,"The food here are great especially the CHEESE CAKES! but don't go during 5-7pm cuz u gonna wait FOREVER! no joke!  OH yea and the restroom, so so so so so small( i don't know the female one tho). 3 stars for this restaurant, good enough."
lib c.,"Daly City, United States",90,45,27,4.0,23/7/2011,"Me and my boyfriend love it here x). We always hit up the Cheesecake Factory whenever we're in downtown. We usually get buffalo blasts, split a mushroom burger, and if we have room-- cheesecake. The service is pretty good here but the wait is torturous lol."
Winnie C.,"San Mateo, United States",21,314,1,2.0,27/3/2009,"I never understood the draw of this place.  Personally, I make it a point to stay away, but some *ahem* friend insisted ... TWICE! First impression - nice decor.  Great location overlooking Union Square.  Opens till late. (all good) Upon arrival, you go to the reception to check in and put your name down.  Then you wait ... and wait some more.  Meanwhile, you have conversations with random strangers in the same boat as you since there's really nothing for either of you to do but to wait ... a LONG time.  You wander around the bar and ""gift"" areas checking out their cheesecakes and getting hungrier by the minute. Finally, you name's called.  With an eagerness you didn't know you had before (you're probably starving by now), you elbow the crowds aside as you get back to the front desk ... you now get a BUZZER! and you get to wander off into the rest of the floors of Macy's while you wait some more.  Not too sure about the range of those buzzer thingys, most people just stay on the top floor of Macy's (linens) looking at endless sheets and towels (woohoo!) During this time, you have no doubt gotten a chance to check out the menu so you know exactly what you want to get as soon as you get seated.  Another half hour or so goes by and your plastic coaster thingy buzzes and flashes.  You trade in your flashing coaster and get put into the ""holding pen"" and wait for somebody to show you to your table. You finally get seated.  At this point, you really don't care where your table is as long as you get your food NOW.  Hopefully before you faint from low blood sugar. The food: there's a wide variety of different kinds of food here.  So you're bound to find something that will catch someone's fancy (on the menu at least), no matter how large your group is.  What we eventually got (food-wise) wasn't necessarily bad ... it's just unremarkable.  Maybe the long wait's their way to nudge people into thinking that the food is better than it is? Prices:  not too bad, but not cheap either.  I could find better places to go in the same price range without the ridiculous wait. Overall:  it's ok.  If your friends insist on coming here.  Go ingest something first.  Preferably a full meal.  Perhaps then, you'll only be hungry when you order instead of starved."
