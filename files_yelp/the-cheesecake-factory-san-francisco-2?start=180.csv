Courtney B.,"Modesto, CA",135,45,40,5.0,7/17/2016,"I'm surprised by the amount of negative reviews, it was a busy Saturday night and the wait was 45 minutes, which seems pretty normal. Their nachos were the best I've ever had, hands down, and a good amount for a group. I got the pasta carbonara, was really good. The others got burgers and seemed to be happy with them. And I got the Pina colada, huge glass, and was delicious. Our server was friendly and accommodating, and for how busy the place was, I was very pleased!"
Vicky L.,"San Francisco, CA",193,34,23,5.0,12/5/2016,My go to restaurant downtown. Too bad it doesn't take reservations. Pasta divinci and rye bread (you can order a whole loaf to take home for $3) The month of December they offer a free slice of cheesecake with $25 gift card purchase but the free cheesecake can only be redeemed starting next month in January.
Khaye S.,"Vallejo, CA",8,93,1,5.0,11/2/2017,"if you think about it, this is a fancy restaurant with amazing food and service for such a low price. you could have a full entree for $20 or less. the wheat bread is amazing, and one tip, they sell it for $3 for a 20 inch (or more, not too sure). please grab their strawberry daiquiris! virgin or not, it is ahhhmaaazziinngg! I've tried many different kinds but nothing compares to theirs. I love the ambiance and the views on this location. try to get outdoor seating, its a lot better outside than the inside."
Evelyn J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,17,,3.0,11/20/2017,"Cheesecake factory has extensive menu and prices are quite pricey. We used to go in the Walnut Creek branch often. We finally gave up because it's just so busy and loud all the time. Few times we dropped by was earlier or a bit earlier and it was more relaxing. They have a nice interior design but there must be something wrong with the acoustics, it's all the same in all the cheesecake factory, just loud. And long cues of course!"
TigerLily F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,10,1.0,12/19/2016,"Terrible check-in procedure. Very unorganized and a bunch of chaos at the counter. Waited an hour and 20 for our buzzer to go off. Once it did, we stood in line to give the hostess the buzzer. Ppl crowded everywhere and once it was our turn to turn in the buzzer, it stopped vibrating. The hostess (short DragonBall Z looking character) said we weren't there in time to turn in it. And said we had to wait all over again. We were livid! Spoke to a manger about how unorganized the line /process was. She gave us a table 5-10 mins later.  Of course I know it's busy due to the holidays, BUT since it is n Union Square of SF, you'd think they'd have a better check-in procedure . Try roped off areas or a representative to assist with the lines ... somethin' It was so bad, a lady threw her Buzzer at the manager. Y'all need to get it together.  And a word of advice...if they say ""10-15 minutes to wait"", that means an hour. Don't come here too hungry expecting to be seated quickly."
H W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/21/2017,"If you absolutely *must* eat here for some reason, do it during off-hours, not when there's a dinner-time rush - that way you increase the chances that there will be semi-decent service and conscientious preparation of your entrees. Otherwise, it's a madhouse, and you will wait an absurdly long time for a table, for your food, and finally for your check. And when you get your food, it very likely will not be prepared right.  I do feel bad for the front desk staff, as I know they're trying hard to keep the flow of guests and tables moving along smoothly. But some members of the waitstaff here are not at all pleasant, and it is very clear that they'd rather be doing something else. I spent half of my meal here looking for the waiter. I had to get up and chase him down to get the check, as I'd spent too much time craning my neck and waving my hand to get his attention.  Even if you've enjoyed eating at other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past, be wary about eating at this Union Square location. The huge number of guests on certain nights and the fact that many of these out-of-towners won't be back in town again for the foreseeable future, if ever, might make the staff here less likely to provide good service. (Though with sites like Yelp, you'd think the prospect of crappy reviews would still provide some incentive for semi-decent service.)"
Daniela L.,"Lompoc, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/7/2017,"Our experience here ruined the Cheesecake Factory hype for us. There was a 40 minute wait and we ended up waiting one hour and a half because one of the hosts gave our table away to another group and we let the other hosts know and they all seemed to ignore us. We finally got our table after an hour and a half and our server was rude.  Not going back, go somewhere else it's not worth the hype."
Elizabeth Z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/12/2017,"This is my first maybe second time here I can't remember, and I have a decent amount of patience but I got here at 9 and I'm not leaving until 10:30 it took about 10-15 mins to get me 3 boxes. Just sucked for a pretty new customer"
Cho M.,"San Francisco, CA",50,4,10,4.0,3/29/2017,Cheesecake and Bread are so good. But I don't like their food. I hope their food taste better if i go there next time. Love the environment.
Ronn M.,"Foster City, CA",23,57,70,4.0,3/5/2017,"""Rene's Special"" is what I crave for everytime. Turkey or Chicken sandwich...and the great soup of the day. I kid you not. Nuff said. It's  ono."
AndRea J.,"Oakland, CA",75,13,6,1.0,8/24/2017,Where should I start with this location. Its at a nice location. The staff are very rude to customers. Some of the host walk off to get on the phones.the servers and managers eat off desert and regular food plates before they get to the customers. They have friendly pets aka rottens. They give out dirty dishes and stuff thats been on the floor.  If you ever eat here stand by the kitchen and just watch the workers cook your food smh its nasty. If I could give no stars I would. They need to bri g ppl in thats passionate about what they do.
Adri A.,"Sacramento, CA",104,34,19,1.0,5/24/2017,"Never got to eat, read my review and you'll know why. Working in the industry and having quiet a bit of knowledge on gluten, as well as dining at another location with servers/bartenders who are aware and knowledgeable of the menu they're selling.  1) We walk in and there had to be 40 people waiting in the lobby. Being a tourist city and location I get it, so we waited (as) patiently (as possible) with people bumping into us every which way we turned.  2) The sever has no knowledge what so ever of any food or liquor that is gluten free. Wife wanted the gluten free burger with fries (items on their gluten free menu) and a Long Island. He could not confidently say whether the fryer was cross contaminated. Ok, fine, no fries for the wife.  3) He comes back and says ""the bartender said they can't account for the Titos and Hendrix in the Long Island so they can't make it."" Are you kidding me?? As a paying consumer (and a bar manager) I could give two shits how you account for 0.5 oz of Titos and 0.5 oz of Hendrix. Charge me for the most expensive liquor and call it a day. At this point wife's irritated, rightfully so 3) We watched as a family of 7 or so let their 10 year old run around the restaurant with no shoes on like it's a playground and put his feet up on a clean table.  I'm done, we leave. Great call because we found The Rambler on yelp and enjoyed everything from the service to the food to the atmosphere."
Rhett B.,"San Francisco, CA",626,140,942,2.0,7/22/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is normally a great place to go for dates and grab a great meal. Now, I must say, my server (Michelle) and the food was BOMB!! It was amazing! I would absolutely go back for the food, BUT, the major reason I ranked the Cheesecake Factory so low is because the wait is ridiculous. The wait is ridiculous, along with the space in which you can wait. There is no room. The amount of people waiting to be seated along with the fact that you can't leave the top floor or you wont hear your name is called is crazy. They have to do better!! It makes everyone irritable!!"

Alexander S.,"San Ramon, CA",23,50,9,1.0,12/18/2016,"90 minutes. No food. Other tables seated after us with the same number of orders (4) got food before us. No explanation. Server said they'd get the manager since we decided to leave. 15 minutes later, no manager. Left. Thanks for the bread?"
Bella W.,"Eureka, CA",280,40,,5.0,6/10/2017,"I can't believe this restaurant is not rated with 5 stars because it is fabulous.If your rating the ""The Cheesecake Factory"" on it's wait time, I can understand giving a less than glowing review, but for any other reason, you must have had a ""one-off"" experience. I have eaten here many times, and it has always been one of my favorite chain restaurants. This particular one is extra nice because it's located on the top floor of Macy's which overlooks Union Square. The view up here is absolutely amazing."
Kathleen L.,"Kitchener, Canada",23,4,,4.0,8/25/2017,It was a crowded and busy Thursday night and there was a wait but it was shorter than what we were told! We sat outside on the patio which was warm enough with the heaters! Our server Laurence was attentive and kind and we overall enjoyed our food (French Country salad and Chicken Reisling). Great view of Union Square at night!!
Karan N.,"St. John's, Canada",4,30,55,4.0,9/5/2016,"This is the type of restaurant you go to, to say you went there. It's a chain restaurant with a rich history in of course, cheesecakes. I went there for lunch today and it certainly met my expectations.  Firstly, they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. The wait for lunch was around 20-25 mins, whereas the wait for dinner is around 60-90 mins.  It's a really busy restaurant with mostly tourists eating there. It has a busy atmosphere, but has a nice vibe. Our waiter was really friendly and the service was great. Prices are quite reasonable and the Cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had."
Mark K.,"San Rafael, CA",2,69,190,4.0,9/29/2017,"I have been coming here on and off for years, and have finally been ""coerced"" into writing a review. Like many Cheesecake locations, this place has its quirks. However, the food is good to very good the vast majority of the time, and the service here - unlike some other locations - is often spot on and more. In fact, it is unusual when I come here and find myself grousing about something. Having said that, let the review begin. This location is in the Macy's store at Union Square, up at the top - there is an elevator you can take (inside main entrance to your right), or you can slow journey up the many flights of escalators, taking in the various store floors as you go. As a note, if you arrive at a busy time, just hang out one floor down at the foot of the last escalators - lots of sofas on display, and if you're civil in behavior Macy's doesn't seem to mind if you park it for a little while; not sure the beeper reaches there, so leave someone upstairs if needed. This location has what I would call four dining zones - a bar, an area to the left of the bar (as you face it) and a larger room to the right, past the cheesecake display which tempts you upon entry. There is also an outdoor deck, but with limited shade, and with propane heaters for those summer days in SF! So, there is a bit of a choice of seating - tables or booths, as well. The menu is extensive (more than 250 items offered daily!) and does change in small ways now and then. Can't recommend anything, as I have too many favorites and you'd need several visits to try them for yourself. However, this last visit we had the Korean Fried Cauliflower (crispy cauliflower tossed with sweet and spicy sauce, toasted sesame seeds and green onion). First time for this, and of course, one of those rare issues - about 20 minutes after ordering a manager appeared (never a good sign) and said they were still making the sauce, so the dish would be a little delayed. Not a problem, except that the cauliflower arrived cold. Pretty sure it should have been warm-er. Still the taste was amazing, and although served with a ranch side (?!) the taste of the sauce was more than enough. Will have again! The other appetizer was the lightly breaded fried zucchini sticks, which I always enjoy - WITH the ranch side! We had salads for main entrees, a  Chinese Chicken Salad (chicken breast, rice noodles, lettuce, green onions, almonds, crisp wontons, bean sprouts, orange and sesame seeds, tossed in Chinese plum dressing. This was presented well, but the dressing (especially compared to other places we had this type of salad) was bland - no flavor whatever. Very disappointing. The other salad was the Cobb (with chicken and bacon on the side) and a sub of ranch dressing (which is a little tangy - try it!). Very good salad! And of course, we had to have cheesecake for dessert, and the Key Lime was perfect - tangy, tasty and not overwhelming in size. Don't forget the bread! What I call brown bread, and a sourdough type are offered - I only enjoy the brown bread, warm and soft!  I noticed the butter this visit was not offered in the usual foil wrapped pads, but a square in a small dish - forget to reorder? Not sure if this will become the regular way of serving butter, but if so -- note to manager -- PLEASE, let it get to room temperature before serving. Way too hard to spread, even on warm bread. Anyway, a couple of hiccups, unusual here at this location, but overall worthy of 4-stars. Service was attentive, polite, at times humorous and social, and professional. Will review again - someday! - so in the meanwhile, check it out for yourself."

But we picked a bad night to come two days after thanksgiving. Really really busy 2 hour and 45 minute wait busy.
