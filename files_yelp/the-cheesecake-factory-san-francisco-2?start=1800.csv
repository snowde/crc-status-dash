d p.,"Linden, United States",3,45,13,5.0,12/11/2011,This place is awesome we were in the city for fleet week and tried this for the first time delish and we sat outdoors the views were great - a little cold they could use another heater or two but over all very good cant wait to return to this location we have however eaten at the Arden Fair mall location in Sacramento and that one is also good and we will be trying the others too
Amber H.,"Castro Valley, United States",87,30,20,3.0,28/8/2011,"Deserves 3 stars... I usually LOVE cheesecake factory. Possibly because it's in SF but they have very over priced drinks, especially for a chain. My husband and I ordered the strawberry short cake and they served us dried biscuits instead of angel food cake, what is up with that (waitress recommended)?! Anyways the worst part was the wait which we could have handled if the hostess wasn't continually telling us 10-15 minutes and an hour and a half later we didn't even get to eat on the patio as we wanted to and we showed up at 9:30pm"
Alice N.,"Alameda, United States",0,13,8,3.0,23/12/2013,"Had a very lovely waitress but the wait for it was ridiculous (as always). I do love the cheese cake there (of course), I stick to my classic strawberry cheesecake. I don't recommend getting nachos there. The cheese hardens and it just taste like plastic, idk. I didn't particularly like my pasta dish but that was my mistake of ordering it. Overall. It was an average dining experience"
Harry G.,"Hillsboro, United States",56,19,10,3.0,23/8/2011,"Just another overprice chain restaurant.  My wife wanted to go and i had no other choice that taking her.  Food is OK, desserts are great.  If you must go and weather is nice ask to sit  outside, the view is amazing."
Joseph N.,"San Francisco, United States",119,313,7,3.0,16/3/2009,"(2.5 stars) There are some things in life that I used to love, whether in childhood or high school or even a few years ago, that just don't have the same appeal anymore.  When I watched Top Gun (my favorite movie as a kid) as an adult, I was sorely disappointed to find that it's just a lame story with cool fighter jet scenes interspersed between scenes depicting  homoerotic behavior.  Cheesecake Factory, my favorite place to eat in high school, has been similarly revealed as another mediocre chain restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good for a chain, but in San Francisco you can do much, much better.  That's why you don't see any Applebee's or Chili's or Red Lobster or TGI Friday's in this city; even with their low prices they don't have enough to offer. The good things about Cheesecake Factory are its huge menu that can accommodate pretty much anyone and the giant portions that they serve.  The bad thing about this menu is that nothing is done very well.  The appetizers (avocado eggrolls are my favorite) are decent but I have yet to try an entree here that I really enjoy.  The cheesecake is ok, its strength comes from the stuff they put on it as opposed to the actual cheesecake, but it will definitely satisfy that craving if you are a cheesecake fan. This particular location is nice because of the outdoor deck overlooking Union Square and downtown, but it's also bad because with all the tourists the wait can be like 2 hours.  The bar gets overcrowded, and everyone is just happy to wait for the same shit they could get in their home town. With no wait, this isn't a bad place to come when it's nice out and you aren't especially picky.  It's a decent brunch spot on a sunny day if you can beat the rush.  But if you're planning to come at dinnertime, or if you want to sit inside, or if you or anyone in your group is looking for a really good meal, don't come here."
Garett T.,"San Francisco, United States",201,472,499,4.0,14/5/2009,"Having already been to two other Cheesecake Factories (Palo Alto and somewhere in LA), this particular visit is in comparison. Is it the best?  Most likely.  I really liked getting to sit outdoors on the 8th floor, with an excellent view of Union Square. Is the food great?  I liked everything I was served, bread, appetizers and all.  A bit pricy, but that was anticipated, and the plates are huge.  Plus, their food can indeed be spicy when listed as such in the menu, despite being told that wasn't true by the flippin' waiter! Do they serve drinks?  Yes.  I ordered a pineapple mojito, and it had good flavor, though it was not strong at all. Why is this review not 5 stars?  Two reasons.  First, and I expected this one, a TON of people went here, making us wait AT LEAST a literal hour, though we were able to browse around for awhile in the Macy's floor immediately below.  Second, I went in a group of 3, and we had told our waiter that we'd each like separate checks to pay individually, and he agreed.  But, did he do that?  No!"
Diane S.,"Houston, United States",306,948,153,4.0,20/5/2011,"This restaurant has the best view of union square! Outside seating isn't ideal since its always cold in ssf but they do have heaters. I love coming here during Christmas watching the people ice skate in union square so pretty. Portions here are very generous. I like their pastas. Pasta da venchi and evelyn's is really good. Free bread. The brown one is really good. minus one for plastic glasses, really get some glass ones! The wait is longer at night be prepared to wait at least 30 mins. Moderately priced, but well worth it!"
Brian S.,"Moraga, United States",3,6,1,1.0,11/12/2010,"Well...I generally like Cheesecake Factory, so it saddens me to write this.   Despite our better judgment, I and four other friends decided to eat here on a Friday night at 8:00p.  We were told that it was going to be a two hour wait for anything inside or outside...OK, we expected that.  We walked around Macy's and Union Square for about an hour before returning to the restaurant.  At 9:00p, one hour after arriving, we were told that it was going to be another 10-15 minutes.  We were pleasantly surprised, but gradually became disappointed when that 10-15 minutes slowly turned into another hour.  So, it really was a two hour wait.  When we asked why we were told 10-15 minutes by someone else, the hostess curtly said that they must have read the list wrong, then quickly dismissed us. We we seated outside directly under a heater at two wobbly tables (pushed together) with only two place settings.  Our waiter greeted us fairly quickly, but then disappeared for 15 - 20 minutes.  (As the evening progressed, we came to realize that this was how it was going to be for the rest of our stay.)  When he came back, he took our order from memory, which made us really nervous.  We should have asked him to write it down, but we didn't.  He's a professional, right?  Well, the food came 30 minutes later and two of the orders were wrong.  We didn't have the time or the patience to correct them.  Three out of the five of us enjoyed our food, but felt badly for the other two.  During our meal, we had to flag down other waiters to find OUR waiter so we could get beverage refills and condiments.  We often observed our waiter talking with people and taking pictures instead of tending to his tables, hence the disconnect.  The condiments he brought were almost empty and one of our refills of Sprite turned out to be carbonated water.  During our meal outside, several times in fact, different people waiting on the balcony started smoking.  Several staff members walked by these smokers and said nothing to them even though there are ""No Smoking"" signs clearly posted.  One person in our party finally had enough, went over to an offending group with another waiter, and demanded that they put out their cigarettes.  That was uncomfortable for everyone and solidified our experience that night as awful and not worth the time or money we spent. The only positive thing I have to say is that we did have the cheesecake for dessert which is ALWAYS a treat.  Next time, though, when we're craving for cheesecake we're going to get it ""to go"" instead of waste our time in that location. If you don't care about your time, good customer service, or health laws in California, you will definitely enjoy this location."
Paula H.,"San Diego, United States",64,361,149,5.0,14/3/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake factory. But this location is exceptional. It was Christmas and we sat outside on the huge deck overlooking the ice skaters in Union Square.
Monica R.,"Benicia, United States",0,5,,3.0,1/4/2012,"Yum!! but i always feel because i'm a student, i get passed over for good service. And the last time i went, they totally were skimpy on the food :/ service has truly slipped!"
joe b.,"San Francisco, United States",46,183,17,4.0,1/3/2011,I keep trying to hate this place.  No luck so far.
Stefani C.,"SoMa, San Francisco, United States",0,5,,1.0,7/12/2013,"Worst experience ever!! It was my first time in the city and had heard this was a good place to check out. I checked in and was told to wait 30minutes and check in after. I did and afterwards was told it was an hour wait. My boyfriend and I decided to check out Macys while we were there. We checked in an hour after when the pager hadn't rang yet and we were told anther 10. Okay, by then we've waited so 10 minutes was okay. At that point it was 30 more minutes. stupid for even waiting!!! The food was gross! I am not one to brag about bad food but this was absurd! I ordered a burger and the meat was way over cooked and the bottom bun was broken in two! I had no refills and wasn't even offered dessert at the end! For peets sake! Where was the cheescake! NEVER REFERRING THIS PLACE!!"
Ashley J.,"San Francisco, United States",341,326,53,3.0,29/6/2011,"What's excellent about this place? The view of Union square. What's bad about this place? Nothing really. The food is average, and can be overwhelming with the amount you get (I suggest splitting an entree between 2 people, yes even if you're a hungry guy). It's a great casual spot to dine in Union Square, and it's open pretty late too. The cheesecake is ALWAYS good, but there's never room to fit it after eating your weight in pasta and complimentary bread. The one thing I'd suggest for all Cheesecake Factories is to lessen the amount of food you put on the plate. If everyone in your restaurant is taking doggie bags home, it should be a sign. One thing is for sure though-- the price here is very right. And if you split a dish, maybe add a salad and some cheesecake, you get a great well rounded meal for an even better price."
Natasha I.,"San Francisco, United States",39,121,94,3.0,14/8/2008,Okie this place has the most sinful and decadent desserts. Ever. Every slice is filled with happiness and goodness that ll surely get you singing :) No seriously I love their desserts. The main course is nice too with quite a selection. Do try their avocado spring rolls and spinach and artichoke dip. Quite nice. Overpriced ? Slightly. Minuses:  I would love to give them 5 stars which i do wanna give them but the wait is awful :( It can take anywhere from half hour to an hour to get a seat...What???
M W.,"San Francisco, United States",534,561,1264,3.0,24/9/2008,"My bf took me here tonight since i've never been here before and I guess my expectations were so high that I ended up being disappointed that it didnt turn out the way I'd expected. We got seated maybe 25 minutes after arriving and quickly ordered since we were both starving! We started off with the appetizer Boston House Salad and the crispy crab wonton- both were very good and the portions werent skimpy- I began to get full off just the appetizers! My bf ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and I ordered the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. We were a bit disappointed when our plates came out since the bow-tie pasta wasnt really soft - it wasnt really cooked all the way =/ (pasta is suppose to be soft, right????). I felt bad for bothering our server, William, about it but he was super nice and didnt hesitate one bit to take our plates back to the kitchen for a remake. The second time around tasted way better and the portions were so huge that my bf and I only ate 1/4 of our plates and took the rest home. For dessert we ordered the chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake which was just all right to me- it was really sweet tho! All in all I think the food here is decent and I'm glad to have finally tried it. This isnt a place that would make me running back for more.  2 stars for the food and 1 star for our friendly and attentive server William."
Lille L.,"Oakland, United States",402,101,41,4.0,24/6/2009,"The secret to having an enjoyable experience here is to come at odd hours when it's *not* so crowded! I planned a late lunch for my friend's birthday and our party consisted of 12. I talked with the receptionist around 3:45pm on Tuesday. She didn't give me a buzzer because only half of us were present, but they still seated us 15 minutes later! The bread & butter was really good/fun to eat :P. I had the chicken bellagio after iPhone Yelping a picture of the dish. The chicken and prosciutto were really good, but the pasta was plain and oily. I wondered why they put so little sauce in, and found an article where the executive chef of Cheesecake said that in order to make dishes on the value menu profitable, ""Every ingredient had to be carefully balanced. What we found is that, where we may have used 3 ounces of a sauce before, 2 ounces actually was enough.""  No Bob Okura! 2 ounces is NOT enough! But it's okay, the decor, service, and $187 bill for a party of 12 makes this place deserve 4 stars from me."

Julia S.,"Honolulu, United States",25,142,118,5.0,22/6/2011,"Ahhhh! I love this location so very much!  I'm used to the scene of cramming 2 people in a 1 sq ft space multiplied by an entire restaurant.  It is truly great on a crisp, fall night - keeping warm with drinks and outdoor heaters while overlooking the partial city view.  Being stuck inside is *Meh, looks like a chain restaurant* feeling.  If I'm staying a few days in SF, I definitely take my friends to this location who've never been before.  If my friend is a local, then no way; we will eat like a local and go elsewhere."
Jessil P.,"Daly City, United States",3,14,2,2.0,1/8/2011,"I CANNOT believe what I had went through at this Cheesecake Factory. Not only was it super crowded with a bunch of bodies everywhere, I mean literally EVERYWHERE, but after we were given our buzzer the wait was an hour and a forty-five minutes long. Nearly 2 hours! It would have just been an hour and a half but we spent the last fifteen minutes of our waiting time waiting for someone to show us to our table. Anywho, once we sat down everything began to go much smoother. Our food was brought to us the way we asked and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was kind and funny as well. Although the food was delicious, I'm sorry to say but I will most likelu not be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory for a lonnnnng time."
Cat of a Donut J.,"San Francisco, United States",60,147,,2.0,4/9/2008,"OH no, pass on that. General 3 stars rating does is a perfect reflection I think. OK, threw up after ""medium well"" burger, that were rather ""medium-rare""...Greazy, doing a no-good meal  1 star for the waitress - she was superfriendly 1 star for the chocolate cheezecake - yummy f**ker! ;)"
