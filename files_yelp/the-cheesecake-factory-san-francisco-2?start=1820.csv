Mike H.,"San Francisco, United States",244,119,154,1.0,30/8/2008,"I'm not even going to talk about the greasy food. Had a party of 10 and first started off with drinks, i ordered the soda while the ladies ordered fancy drinks. My soda was mixed by a monkey, it had no flavor and i was disgusted. I'm just going to leave it at the soda criticism because if i go on anymore i might be banned from yelp for my harsh remarks. =\  This place is only for tourists!"
Anecia L.,"San Leandro, United States",359,26,,3.0,16/12/2010,"This location is usually busy since it's in union square and on top of macys.  That's the nice thing about this location that it is on the 8th floor of macys so you get a really nice ambiance, although the Cheesecake factory always has nice decor and vibe to it.   My mom and I came here the other day for a late lunch and it was still really busy even though lunch time had past.  The great thing about the CF is that they have a great menu. I mean you could come here a bunch of times and get something different every time.  This time I ordered the BBQ salmon which I've probably ordered once or twice before so I obviously know what to expect.  My mom also ordered something from the special menu.  I always enjoy their complimentary wheat bread.  I don't really care for their french bread.  Our food came out in  timely matter but I noticed something with my dish, it was missing the onion strings.  I mean it wasn't a huge deal but I would expect them not to forget these things.  So I asked our waitress about it and she just made this excuse on why the onion strings weren't on my plate.  She just ended up giving me a side of onion strings.  Our waitress wasn't great either.  She was just there to do her job, not too friendly.  I just feel like she could of provided better customer service.  Another complaint is when my mom ordered hot tea they didn't have her choose what kind of tea she wanted.  So when she got her tea she got this flavor of tea she didn't like.  They usually serve you with the hot water and a box of mixed tea flavors to choose from.   Overall this location just needs better customer service and provide the proper food to their dishes."
Ravo Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,251,1608,3.0,22/7/2009,"Came here after my visit to the de Young museum to see the YSL exhibit back in December.  It was a longgg wait for a table for two.  I suppose it's worth it if you're a tourist and really want to take in a view of the city with their outdoor seating, but we just sort of wanted to eat.   It was my second time eating here, the first time I sat indoors, but this time we were lucky and got a seat outdoors.  It was kind of cold that day, but they had nice heat lamps to keep us warm outside.   Love the unlimited strawberry lemonade, super fab."
S R.,"Los Angeles, United States",3,18,,1.0,4/1/2011,"This company should not be in the food business if it can't service clients adequately.  From the wait to be called ridiculously long, to the wait to be seated, to the wait for the server to come by, to the order specifics being ignored....the food is not ""that"" great.  If you are in San Francisco, and curious, just go upstairs to see it and leave--the decor is kinda cheesy anyways."
Christina Z.,"Oakland, United States",18,170,,3.0,19/7/2011,"Came here to meet my friends for lunch. They were already seated at the bar area so I just met them there. Service was pretty good considering how busy it was. I only had had drinks here so I can't rate the food. As for their signature cocktails, they could had been stronger."
Mary T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",38,652,89,4.0,16/5/2008,"One year, I celebrated my birthday about a dozen times, within a two-week period with various friends and family. And on my actual birthday, I met up with the bestest friends a girl could have at this place. It was easy, even though there were better places to go. I've been here a handful of times, and it has always been the same. Long wait, lots of food, lots of drinks...but all with great friends. So, my experiences make this particular place worthy of four stars. And service has been always been stellar! Tonight, to celebrate my birthday...we are going to BBQ! Whoo-hoo! Then, tomorrow, after my graduation/convocation, we're going to partay! I love joint bday/graduation celebrations! This is my second one. :)"
James J.,"New Orleans, United States",0,22,,2.0,5/1/2012,"I used to love this place. I have visited the SF one on about 3 occasions and I only go, because someone wants to go. But the food is average at best and the wait is too long and the service - bad.  I think SF has a way of messing up a wet dream. But the Union Square location no way."
Kevin D.,"San Francisco, United States",72,102,12,2.0,17/7/2011,"Alright overrated restaurant...rude. This place is so pedestrian and subpar. The wait to eat here is so absurd, and you'd think the wait to get in this pseudo heaven of a restaurant would be worth it in the end, but it's not. Just go to the Elephant Bar and save your time. So not the business."
Dawn D.,"Bellflower, United States",82,47,14,5.0,26/9/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory and what a wonderful location on the top floor of Macy's.  Service was wonderful. We had appetizers, drinks and of course dessert.  Wonderful time!"
Shad B.,"New York, United States",213,96,6,2.0,29/5/2011,"Although I like the food and the cheesecake, I am not sure if the 1 1/2 hour wait is worth it.  It is always crowded and the service was mediocre."
Rocco D.,"San Diego, United States",0,63,,2.0,26/2/2012,Not really good to be honest.  I've tried the meatloaf and it pretty much tasted like shit.  I figured all Cheesecake Factories were bad but then I tried one in Portland and it tasted fine.
Ada T.,"Pittsburgh, United States",94,288,190,3.0,4/8/2008,"I mock and I mock The Cheesecake Factory, and yet I still find myself coming here a few times a year. I tell myself that no restaurant should have a wait to get into the elevator (TCF almost always does), I tell myself that no restaurant should have a wait to GET A PAGER (TCF occasionally does), I tell myself that San Francisco has so many more interesting places to eat (SF does). But despite this, and my requisite Bay Area chain restaurant snobbery, I keep eating here because honestly, there just aren't that many nice sit-down restaurants in the Union Square area where you can eat for less than $20pp. The menu is enormous and clearly designed to please any crowd, and everything is cooked in enough butter to taste good. And their brown bread is legitimately delicious.  That being said, I hate how tourists flock to this place. There are Cheesecake Factories EVERYWHERE, people! If you are going to visit San Francisco, then do it like you mean it."
Karen T.,"Brooklyn, United States",3,33,3,3.0,23/4/2011,"I tried the red velvet cheesecake and I must admit, it was good. But at almost $9 for a slice of cheesecake, it was definitely not worth it."
Kassondre J.,"Novato, United States",1,37,21,4.0,15/9/2013,"Finally I went to a cheese cake factory for my boyfriend and I to celebrate our anniversary early. The food was amazing! &   The price was very reasonable. The only thing about this place I didn't like was the wait time, and they don't except reservations. Other than that the view is beautiful and our waiter was very polite! When he went on brake, he introduced us to a lady who was going to be helping us untill he got back. She was also very friendly. I will diffidently be back!"
Spencer T.,"Antelope, United States",166,109,746,1.0,8/11/2010,This is the worst place for service in entire San Francisco area. Will is the worst waiter I have ever seen!!! It took an hour and a half to get a table half hour to order and an hour to get our food. He forgot my app. This is the worst worst worst time I've ever had!!!!
Andrea B.,"Richmond, United States",133,164,6,5.0,6/1/2011,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  1.  I love all of your different locations. 2.  I love your menu.  3.  I love how your portions are so big.  You, my friend, are contributing to the rise of obesity in this country and I love you for that.  4.  I love your jumbalaya.  5.  I love your strawberry lemonade.  6.  I love your strawberry lemonade.  7.  I love your strawberry lemonade.  8.  I love how I never have to wait long for my service or food.  9.  I love your strawberry shortcake.  10.  I LOVE YOUR HONEY BREAD, DAMNIT!  11.  I love how I wanted you to cater my wedding.  12.  I love YOU!"
Chris C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,25,,4.0,31/1/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants.  I've eaten at this location, and also the ones in Las Vegas, St. Louis, and Walnut Creek.  They have a wide variety of foods with plenty of vegetarian options and a dazzling array of different cheesecake varieties.  Their cheesecakes are literally the standard by which any other restaurants' cheesecakes should be judged -- they are so delicious I have never tried any of the other desserts they offer.  If you're counting calories, be sure to make an informed decision regarding your order -- their food often has a lot.  If there's any criticism I can make, it's that they don't take reservations.  This doesn't present a problem around lunch, but at dinner time -- especially on weekends -- you may have to wait a long time to get seated.  That being said, there's a good reason it's popular - the food is mouth-watering."
Gabriella C.,"San Francisco, United States",11,72,25,3.0,17/4/2011,"I kind of chuckle when I see thorough reviews of CF. Seriously? C'mon Its a chain restaurant and a tourist hot spot, we all know the food is decent to mediocre, and probably not as great as the experience you could've had at a mom n pop restaurant anywhere else in the city. Next!"
Micheol A.,"Union City, United States",0,13,,1.0,16/12/2013,"this cheesecake factory sucks. i love their location and the view. but the service sucks. the wait for an outside table is typically 45mins, we waited over 1hr and 5 mins. they weren't even going to seat my family together after we waited that long! i had to argue with the host/hostess to get us next to each other. then when we orderd my dads food came last when we were supposed to  get the bill. he got his food while we were leaving. wtf. where does that even happen. we didn't even get a sorry, the waiter was giving us attidude with her overweight ass. sorry bitch not everybody can be obese like you and give you pity. if i ever see her again best believe i will slap that bitch. so if i ever do go again, i will not tip, i will not be on my best behavior, i will just let loose and call out a fat ass waiter if i have too. thank you and good day."
M K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,139,14,3.0,23/12/2010,"If you want a slice of chocolate cake in Union square at 11:30pm, this is your joint.  Otherwise, during dinner, it is always horrendously crowded and the food isn't all that great.  Desserts and drinks only - forget the dinner."
