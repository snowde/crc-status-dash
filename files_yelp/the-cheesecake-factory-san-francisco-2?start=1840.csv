Wooka W.,"Richmond, United States",40,57,,3.0,27/6/2011,I didn't know this place existed actually..went shopping with a chick at Macy's (worst idea ever) spent hours at the make-up area! After that she made me climb like 10 floors talking about there's a cheesecake factory up here..I said can't we take the elevator..she said no..I started questioning if she was crazy..Later I found out you really can't take the elevator all the way up there..What where they thinking?? Service lines are forever you probably die of starvation before getting sat down..Food is expensive and mediocre. but the view is killer and chicks dig that! So I say tough it out after your wallets been milked dry..the day can't go worse it only gets better!
Larry J.,"San Francisco, United States",35,205,140,5.0,1/9/2008,"It pains me to give a giant chain like the Cheesecake Factory 5 stars.  I am not a fan of chains but I will explain why I give the place high marks.  This is the only place where I get a really good sized salmon. In fact, the largest salmon fillet I've ever had at a restaurant was at The Cheesecake Factory. It was as large as the size I would buy at the grocery store. When ever I go to a seafood restaurant and order salmon, I am always disappointed with the size. The price for their salmon was under $20 too.  It was very well seasoned and the garlic mashed potatoes were excellent.  For drinks I had a Long Island Iced Tea.  The bartender did a phenomenal job and it tasted great. I've also had their Mai Tais. They are excellent and so are their mojitos. These are cocktails that aren't simple to make. If a bartender can make these right then I give them a thumbs up. That combined with salmon & garlic mashed potatoes that can satisfy my discriminating taste? They will certainly get a 5 star rating from me.  I've also had their burgers, pasta, other seafood, cajun dishes and Mexican dishes. This place does them all really well. No wonder why there is a 2+ hour long wait.  Cheesecake? Of the 30+ times I've ate Cheesecake Factories around the USA, I've only had their cheesecake once. I lost my sweet tooth when I was like only 10 years old. Not much in to sweets but I do occasionally like to have a plain thick & creamy cheesecake with nothing on it. Yum, yum!"
Vincent B.,"San Francisco, United States",14,62,3,4.0,29/8/2008,"I've had some inconsistent experiences coming to CF. Sometimes the service is great ... and sometimes, well ... just be prepared to play the waiting game. But one thing I've always enjoyed are their plates. I'm not a big fan of giant portions, but eh, why not? ... it's still pretty good so just take it home if you can't finish it.  Yes, it's not the best restaurant in town and YES the wait is incredible, but who cares?! Just eat."
B B.,"Seattle, United States",6,118,12,2.0,13/8/2008,"What the crap is so special about this Cheesecake Factory? We got there at 5pm on a Thursday, and it was a 45 minute wait. When we left at 9pm, out of curiosity I checked, and it was a 90 minute wait. What?! And we had to mosh our way out of there. The only thing good about this location are the comfy (and expensive) couches on the floor below which I napped on before we were buzzed. Note: Don't lay on the beds, otherwise you get sternly scolded by sales staff. Apparently, they don't care about you napping on the couches."
Dina D.,"Moorpark, United States",5,8,,4.0,7/7/2010,"So amazing!  My husband and I love coming here when we visit San Francisco.  The view over Union Station is lovely...so romantic to sit outside, have a cocktail and share a dessert...perfection!"
Jack W.,"San Francisco, United States",19,86,,2.0,12/7/2011,"Went on a Saturday night and experienced just about the longest wait for a dinner ever - 1.25hrs - because they don't take prior reservations. Ambiance isn't half bad, and the food was mediocre at best, though extremely greasy, fatty, and come in large portions. I had the lemon chicken and wasn't impressed, but I wasn't expecting anything great... it is the Cheesecake Factory after all. You get what you pay for. Time: 7:30pm, Sat. Food: lemon chicken Price: $18/person after taxes and tip"
Hai T.,"Oakley, United States",76,134,26,3.0,3/7/2008,"Overrated. Yeah, thats what I think. If you can get past the normal 1-2 hour wait, there is a chance you'll be seated outside which will only make things worse. Now if its a nice day, then thats fine. But usual Frisco weather is often cloudy and breezy, so even with the heaters outside, you'll often get a brush of cold wind that could ruin your dining experience. Aside from the seating, the food is pretty good. Their portions are pretty hearty and the food often flavorful. I consider it an upscale TGIFridays. As for the cheesecake, I gotta say that I am not really a fan. I've tried a couple different flavors, but none of it has really stood out. Actually, I have to say that as far as cheesecake goes, your best bet would be Tahoe Joes...now their cheesecake is to die for! I strongly suggest going on a weekday, when the wait time is reduced. Food is worth the price, but not the wait."
Polette S.,"South San Francisco, United States",20,35,,3.0,5/10/2009,Went here for the first time for my friend's 21st birthday and I gotta say it was just like going to Chilli's or one of those types of restaurants...The view was very nice...San Francisco is just beautiful anyway...And it was super crowded especially because it was a Saturday and we had no reservation so our wait was an hour and a half which was all a blur since we had started drinkin ahead of time haha. Overall the food was good the Rye bread is super delicious and the Buffalo Blasts I think that's what they were called were pretty good.  Long wait for ok food in a well known location...That about sums it up!
Jackie M.,"San Francisco, United States",87,102,4,4.0,11/4/2008,"So I know it's probably not cool to like Cheesecake Factory but F it, I'm just gonna put it out there. I like CF despite it being a chain and the fact that at this particular location, you will have to wait anywhere from a half hour to an hour before you're seated. I especially like the SF CF because of its view of downtown. Recs for what you should order when you come here= thai lettuce wraps, navajo sandwich, CHICKEN MADERA, avocado egg rolls, southwestern cilantro salad, and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. When you come to Cheesecake, it's consistent. The bread is dank esp. when warm. The food is huge. The atmosphere is relaxed minus the crazy waiting area. So to all the haters....stop hating on the factory's  player status. Don't hate the player, hate the game. Cheese out!"
Meghana S.,"Berkeley, United States",192,66,29,4.0,20/8/2011,"It takes forever to get a table here, but the wait is worth it. The food is pretty good, the service is so-so, but the cheesecakes are amazing! My favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake! Also give their crabcakes a try."
Arianna G.,"Modesto, United States",3,41,4,2.0,15/6/2010,"Let me start by saying I would not have gone to the restaurant of my own free will. Unfortunately the group that I was with had it dead set in their minds to go here, despite the awesome variety that the City has to offer. While the majority of the group seemed pleased by their meals I have to say that overall this place fails to deliver. This is a chain restaurant that is filled with people. Filled!!! I ordered a steak and I had them change whatever the heck was supposed to come with it so I got a side of veggies and a small salad as opposed to what it generally is. The steak was a bit over-cooked though still edible, the veggies drenched in butter, and the salad was a regular little house salad.  The service was horrible and it took forever to get refills of bread and water. (Mainly concerned about the beverages!) Quite frankly by the time I paid my bill I was happy to get the heck out of there and never go back. The only thing about this place worth anything was the view and you didn't really need to get a table to walk out to the balcony for a bit. Maybe if we'd just gone there was cheesecake it would have been tolerable, but quite frankly I can get cheesecake at lots of other places."
Green Mango Y.,"San Francisco, United States",57,103,34,4.0,30/7/2008,"I like this place. Even though this is a big chain and commercialized and all,  the deck is always great. Service is pretty good and clean. They have a great selection of appetizers or lunch or dinner.  I just found out they have great menu for brunch on Sunday. That will be my next visit!  It is too bad that we have to wait long time and their buzzer doesn't work other floors in Macy's to kill time anymore like it used to be.  It's great for casual dates, with group of people (though they don't take reservation so it will be hard to have more than 4people, I imagine)"
Leah E.,"San Francisco, United States",246,363,915,5.0,1/9/2008,"It was our date night.  We decided to use our $25.00 gift certificate from last Christmas.   We waited for an hour. Part of it we spent just admiring the view of the City from the top floor of Macy's.  The rest window-shopping for furniture downstairs.   We were seated on the patio.  It got really chilly. Good thing that BF was sitting by the heat lamp.  I had my leather jacket.   We ordered all appetizers.  We loved the crispy avocado and the ahi tempura.  We thought the buffalo chicken was salmon but the waiter said it was ground chicken mixed in with buffalo sauce then deep fried.  It was good, though.  We had to order calamari because it was BF's favorite.  Everything was good.  The bread was fresh and warm.  The portions were huge. We ended up barely touching the chicken appetizer and ended up taking it home. Their glass of Cheesecake's Cabernet by Robert Mondavi was generous and must have been just poured from a newly opened bottle.   Sipping good wine with a view of Union Square, the feel of the cold wind on your cheeks, your sweetie smiling in front of you--that's all part of it.  The City lights starting to turn on while the sunset was coming into view.   We had Godiva cheesecake. Gotta have cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, right?  We ended up taking two more slices to go.  You can go to any Cheesecake Factory but going to the one at Union Square is an experience--the waiting, the crazy crowd, the view, the tourists--they are all a part of a wonderful dining experience in San Francisco.   I had some pictures taken by the cable car, pictures of Union Square,  etc. Bought BF new shoes at Aldo's and a purse for me. It was fun playing tourists in my hometown.   It was a beautiful date night."
Ryan D.,"San Diego, United States",17,79,71,4.0,31/5/2011,Great place. The menu is a book. The wait on a fri night was 20 min at 5.30pm. Our 2 year was being a little pill that made use leave early...even the nice waitress offered to hold him. I had to scarf my food down to get the he'll out of there but what I did taste of the green chili burger it was the shit!
Alok S.,"Fremont, United States",15,9,,1.0,25/11/2012,Pathetic. I had like a 5 inch plastic wrap come up in my hummus appetizer. I saw it while we were done with our main course. I brought it to my server's attention. She went back and removed the appetizer from my final bill.  Really. We spend 4  -5 times at a Cheesecake Factory a restaurant for this kind of quality . I wasp feeling sick thinking I ate food that had a plastic wrap from god knows where and top of that we complained to the manager who did nothing. I s expecting an apology and not to see a bill for our meal. Don't get me wrong we went to cheesecake since we can afford if but this kind service is ridiculous.  Don't go here AT ALL!!!!!!!
Amanda C.,"San Francisco, United States",301,39,,3.0,13/8/2011,"The food is great, but don't waste your time here. There are too many tourist here."
Satheene A.,"Albany, United States",0,68,,3.0,8/8/2012,"I really would have liked to give this place a better rating. Since we cannot make reservations (are they ever going to change this, it is SO annoying), we just showed up with my husband on a saturday night around 6.30pm. We were told it would be 1h20 wait. I really wanted to eat there, so we took a pager and went window-shopping around the block. After 1h20 we came back to the building and we were told we would be seated soon. My husband asked one of the hostesses if she knoew when was the last Bart train, she answered ""Just look it up on your smartphone"". He answered he did not have a smartphone. She gave him a look, then glanced at me and said with the most surprised look I've seen in a long time added to a smirk: ""neither of you has a smartphone??!"". We just said no. Casually. Because I really don't why we should. Not everyone is supposed to get the latest gadget just because his friends do. She answered ""well, I don't know then"". So we walked to the ""waiting area"" eagerly. FYI hostess: YOUR reaction in itself will make this our last visit to this location. About 30 min later we were finally seated. Table were too close from eachother. I could have reached in the plate of my neighbor easily. Of course, it was really noisy, but I was expecting this from the fact the restaurant was full.  MY food was great. Small plate of Fried zucchini with cheesy dip. Great. Not too greasy, a little crunchy, juicy, good size for a small plate (and $5) and great dip. My main was a chicken Marsala. It would have been big enough to share for sure. The sauce had a good flavor but was a little too watery. A slice of raspberry/white chocolate truffle for dessert: divine. Also had a good tropical smoothie; it was a little expensive for $6, but I guess that's Union Square.  Now my husband's food. First off he orders a Jack Daniel with Coke and I guess they used a new kind of transparent coke because there was none. We were both extremely surprised (and exchanged a look that was still not as expressive as the hostess') and I told him they must have forgotten. He did not want to call them back and have it exchanged. So we passed on to apps. He took fried the calamaris which was a huge platter of very greasy food. Too greasy. Then he ordered a steak Diane medium rare. It came out well over well-done. It was ridiculous how brown it was. Would it have been my steak, I would have sent it back immediately because there is no way I can eat something this cooked. He is far too nice and did not say anything. But he passed on dessert. The waiter came twice to our table  to tell us very weird jokes. I don;t know if he was trying to create a connection to get a better tip or if he was nervous but it was plain weird. Plus he came back only once (at mid-apps) to refill my husband's glass of water and was then left with an empty glass from the end of his apps to the end of the meal. That pissed him off so much he wanted to leave a 5% tip. My food was good so we ended up leaving an undeserved 20%. Thinking back, we could have left 5% since we are not coming back anymore.  I will now try the location at Walnut Creek. Maybe their hostess is less prejudiced and maybe they pay more attention to their food and customers since they might be less busy.  Disappointment."
Alice Z.,"San Francisco, United States",215,254,52,4.0,10/4/2009,"The good ol' Cheescake Factory. This is definitely a place where birthdays, dates, lunches, and friendly dinners are held through high school. I never celebrated my birthday here, but known many people who have. The service is okay, depends on who the waiter is. I HATE IT when the waiters hella look down on you and your friends because you're just a bunch of high school kids. That's easy, just no tip for this b*tch. (: The food is always good, I like the free bread that they offer with butter. My favorite dish is the Burger with Fries. It's an old time favorite(: I've tried the Louisiana Pasta, it comes with fried chicken breasts on top of the pasta. Creamy. But if i really wanted Italian food I'd go to BUCA, my favorite place in the world(: The Oreo Cheesecake is too sweet, don't get that. And I hate the long line waiting! Last time i went, waited for 1 hour! Anyways enjoy this place when you feel like going somewhere fancy shamscy!"
Patrick O.,"Sacramento, United States",148,282,,4.0,8/3/2011,Excellent location with a spectacular view of Union Square. The ideal place to take your girl to dinner during the holidays. If you don't have reservations you will of course have to wait for dinner. But at least you have Macy's to roam around in and mess around while waiting. The bacon cheese burger was awesome. Big portion for a very fairy price. Lighting is dim making it fairly romantic as well. This location is three times better than the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory.
Chie J.,"San Francisco, United States",72,167,25,4.0,6/3/2008,"Ok.  I DO NOT like chain restaurant.  And I HATE cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.  So why 4 stars? They have a really good Kobe (they call it ""Kobe Burger"" on their menu but American Style Kobe Beef) burger!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  It was very thick and juicy.  Even the tomato tasted great for a restaurant this level.   I'll definitely go back for the burger after 10pm when there is no wait."
