Darren O.,"San Francisco, United States",4,28,5,3.0,31/7/2011,The food is overrated and overpriced but the desserts are as good as you'd expect. Worth coming up for the views.
Maggie L.,"San Francisco, United States",23,113,4,3.0,21/6/2009,"I have been here way too many times and the only reason my party and I would wind up here is because it's conveniently located and it has a pretty big menu. I usually get a burger or the chicen piccata. The chicken piccata is huge so I would recommend splitting it. You must order a piece of cheesecake if you come here otherwise it's just a waste. Keyword is CHEESECAKE. Do not get some other common dessert. My absolute favorite is the Toblerone cheesecake. I wouldn't order any of their drinks, looks mostly like expensive smoothies to me.  Yes, this place gets crowded and I don't understand why they refuse to take reservations. I usually don't mind waiting in the lobby because my friends and I just gawk at the cheesecakes. The best place to sit is outside, the day or at night. You get a really great view of the St. Francis hotel."
Dee J.,"San Lorenzo, United States",18,134,,3.0,1/4/2008,"As I waited NEARLY 90 MINUTES to be seated, I looked down over the railing and calculated the odds that if I jumped at that precise moment, how many people I'd hit on the sidewalk below.  The food is okay....the portions are huge, so if you order something that tastes bad, you are stuck with a shit-load of foul food.  Or the homeless dudes out front are stuck with a shit-load of foul food.  The drinks are stupid weak....not even strong enough to give someone a weak wiener."
J. D.,"San Francisco, United States",1,48,3,1.0,12/9/2009,"Be prepared to wait anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours for a table. Also be prepared to stand the whole time because they only provide 4 benches for customers to sit and wait. They also will tell you that you can't leave and go down stairs and look around Macy's or the pager won't work. I've never been brave enough to try, and risk having to wait another 45 minutes -2 hours.  The host that took us to the table was not very friendly, and actually removed my place setting!! I figured the waitress would replace my place setting, I was wrong!! They didn't offer us bread &butter, but we ordered an Appetizer anyways. unfortunately I actually had to ask the server to provide me with utensils such as, a napkin, fork, and plate. The only polite person was our server. The BIG disappointment however was that the appetizer, and entree came all at the same time!!!  The food is rather substandard. I will never again visit this restaurant, given that San Francisco has so many other great dining options."
Chuck N.,"Washington, DC, United States",182,832,2677,3.0,18/6/2009,"TOOO. F'ing. Croooooowwwwded Meng! Which I guess is a testament of this restaurant's success, but DAYUM the long lines can sometimes act as a strong enough deterrent.  TIP! My buddies and I got here one time on a Saturday eve at 6:30PM the week prior to Christmas, prime time traffic. We ordered our entrées for take-out. We played throughout the building and returned 30 minutes later. Took the grub and went across the street to eat on the tables at the square/plaza. No wait, fresh food, and a vibrant environment. It was the best idea ever!  Final Call: *Unless you've got patience and can wait for 30 minutes plus, a party of more than 2-3 here is not a good idea.  --------------------- Me Gusta: 1. Portion per dollar      -it is kinda expensive for the type of food, but you get a butt load         (holla!). 2. Avocado eggrolls      -good with or without the accompanied sauce 3. Good service      -replenished bread and water promptly and plentifully Constructive Criticism: 1. Boo to the 30 min+ waiting periods! 2. I'd actually be willing to pay less for less food (I always leave with a doggie bag)"
Carolyn D.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,8,,4.0,31/12/2009,"Beautiful location, but that comes with a price. We had a wait time of 90 minutes, which was OK for us because we wanted to do some shopping. We started with Calamari and Onion Rings, both delicious. The dinner portions are ENORMOUS! I shared the Crispy Chicken Carboletta, which was perfecto. Other members of our party got the BBQ Salmon, which was OK, and the Jambalaya, also OK.  However, while one member of the party was eating the shrimp angel hair pasta, they came across a piece of RAW CHICKEN! Gross! We know it was an accident, but it was still pretty nasty. The management was very nice, and took the dish off the bill in addition to giving us two pieces of cheesecake. They seemed very sincere. Overall a good experience, with courteous waiting staff and management."
Carrey W.,"Livingston, United States",63,106,94,4.0,11/5/2009,"We live in San Francisco and we still go to Cheesecake Factory.  It's just good food, and good decor.  We share, so the big portions are not wasted.  The lines here usually are too long, so our plan usually is to be there when they open. Recently we went for Mother's Day, and they took reservations for that day.  It was obvious that they were prepared, as there were lots of extra staff that day, and so the service we got was great.  The food as usual is great.  The only problem I had was the french fries that came with our salmon was not as great as in other places, but that's a small complaint.  That's because I can't find anything else wrong with this place.  We'll always go back to this place."
Molly P.,"San Francisco, United States",9,191,9,4.0,9/5/2011,"I think this place gets mostly tourists, so as an SF local, I just have to say, this place is good!  Yes, the line can be ridiculously long, but one you're seated, the service is consistently good, and the food is always exactly the way it was the last time you had it, which I appreciate - at least there are no surprises.  Sitting on the deck with the heat lamps and view of Union Square is just really lovely.  I recently discovered the ""small plates"" section of the menu and love it, since I can never finish the huge entree servings.  I'm a fan."
Matt B.,"Irvine, United States",120,100,15,4.0,4/5/2009,"I loved the Godiva chocolate sundae. The fudge part was too sweet though. Also, there's a great view of union square from the patio. If there's not a long wait, you'll enjoy this place."
Dave Y.,"San Francisco, United States",3,11,,5.0,25/4/2008,"My wife Becky and I just love this place!  You can get hibachi steak, teriyaki chicken, Baja chicken tacos, Mandarin-style spicy cashew chicken, and Thai lettuce wraps all at the same place!  It's like a culinary world tour! Totally worth the hour plus wait."
Kristen M.,"San Jose, United States",18,21,,2.0,14/7/2010,"The San Francisco Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the worst locations of the restaurant to eat at if you want timely and courteous service. The food is great but the customer service and attentiveness of the waiters/ waitresses is definitely lacking.  The few times I've been here I've been mistreated as a customer but still I continue to return. The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant.  The nice thing about this place though is the view you have from the top of Macy's. It is pretty awesome. And like with any other Cheesecake Factory place the food and desserts are awesome."
Eda L.,"San Francisco, United States",26,25,,4.0,4/11/2008,"I get overexcited when I see their menu. WHAT TO GET?!?! I've never been let down with the Herb Crusted Salmon with the Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus. It's YUM.. oh  yes. Their Original Cheesecake is none like any other. My mom and I used to pack a slice or two to go when the sweet-tooth acted up. Sweet, fond memories.. strictly referring to the consumption process that is. Minus 1 star for the waiting line powered by Energizer: it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.. and on."
Catherine O.,"San Francisco, United States",579,364,2,3.0,27/3/2008,"You know when you can't decide or know where to get coffee, so you default to starbucks because of convenience? Cheesecake factory is the same concept for me.  Sometimes when I wandering Union Square and I just don't know where to go, I some how end up taking the elevator in Macy's to the Cheesecake level. I find myself stepping out of the elevator into pure chaos. A hellish hour for a wait for two?! GAH! Everyone and their mother eats here, I admit the cheesecake is pretty good (otherwise they wouldn't call it Cheesecake Factory)....although where's the factory..hmm aka kitchen? Anyways, the food is average, I wouldn't say spectacular, not cheap, not expensive! The good thing is they have a variety of foods from pizza, salads, pasta, burgers, to some asian dishes (that I probably wouldn't order).  They have seating inside, outside in the patio next to the pigeons that poop & gawk at your food, and at the bar. The outside patio overlooks the square & they even have heated lamps. So take a seat outside to share your dinner with a pigeon..oops I mean date. The service is not bad as well, nothing to rave or complain about.  Overall, average. Really though, WHY is the wait always long. Why? It's just food people...just food."
Jonathan C.,"San Bruno, United States",155,37,3,4.0,28/5/2011,This place is a landmark in San Francisco. The food is awesome. It is inside Macy. Good tourist place and good food.
kimiko l.,"San Francisco, United States",43,22,38,4.0,20/4/2011,"On of my Favorite spots in Macy's. Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls ( comes with purple cabbage), with a side of mashed Potato's and asparagus. If I'm really hungry I will order the BBQ Salmon. Last but not least Cheese Cake, over 15 flavors. My Faves are Lemon Raspberry and Red Velvet. My BFF LOVE'S the Apple Pie. They have a big selection of food and a whole lot of Cheese Cake!! :) There's something here for everyone."
Christian P.,"Los Angeles, United States",186,387,9,3.0,1/7/2008,Came here Monday after a long pride weekend and the service was  fairly attentive.. did take a while to get drinks and refills.. food came out pretty fast though. yes the wait here can be VERY VERY Long at times.. plan ahead!!!
Lizete S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,190,,3.0,17/8/2011,"We came by for drinks recently.  The wait for the outside area was over half an hour and we didn't feel like waiting so we opted for sitting at one of the tables near the bar.  Our waitress Brittany was convivial and we had an enjoyable experience.  We ordered some beers, coffee and a pomegranate martini ( not very strong ) and shared the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake dessert (very good).    We would return if in the neighborhood."
Chrestien H.,"Oakland, United States",201,9,,3.0,17/6/2008,"Ummm....Whats wrong with me? I can't believe, I let another one of my friends talk me into going to the Cheesecake Factory; I seriously have issues. I keep returning to this restaurant, hoping that one day they will have excellent food and great service---WOW who am I kidding....  Immediately when you get off the crowed elevator (which is loaded beyond capacity) you fight your way to the Restaurant's host to get one of those annoying pagers (I hate those BTW)----I  think restaurant pagers are synonymous with bad food and poor service. Anyways, upon getting your pager and waiting the standard 35-40 mins you are seated with a menu that looks more like an 8th grade yearbook (advertisements on every other page) and absolutely no sense of order. I am convinced that the reason why the menu's are so long is to keep customers busy, because the service is SLOW..... The Food: Not Bad, Not all that good either, I had the Chicken Ramano which was really bland...My buddy had the Double BBQ hamburger which actually looked really good!  The best thing about this restaurant is actually not the food, its the beautiful view of downtown San Francisco you get to experience while dining at the restaurant. This almost makes the bland food and the poor service worth it.  The Cheesecake is actually quite good! I would strongly recommend forgoing dinner and going straight for the Cheesecake...I had the strawberry cheesecake and my friend had the Oreo cheesecake. We both finished our cheesecakes in under 10 mins (we weren't competing, but I won!) So why 3 stars??? (-1) Star for slow service (-1) star for bland food and a confusing menu (+1) star for great Ambiance (+1) star for amazing cheesecake (+1) star for ample portions of food"
Miyu S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,4.0,5/10/2011,I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday last week.
Lacy K.,"Oklahoma City, United States",10,77,,4.0,21/8/2010,The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the variety of the menu. This location has a good view from the patio.
