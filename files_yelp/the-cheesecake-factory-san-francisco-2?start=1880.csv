LiZANN S.,"San Francisco, United States",13,53,1,2.0,30/8/2008,"Cajun Jambalaya Pasta being the most ""popular dish""? shut that shit up. there was no jambalaya representation whatsoever. not even spicy. at least the linguine was fresh."
Amanda L.,"Tracy, United States",1,13,,4.0,3/12/2011,The food is amazing and huge portions!!!!! The only thing that is irritating is that it's so crowded. I have to make sure I have a block of time to give myself to eat.
Karen C.,"San Francisco, United States",256,163,3,2.0,1/3/2009,"This place is located on the top floor of the Macys builiding downtown. This place is always busy and the wait is always longer than an hour unless you go during abnormal eating times such as 4pm-5pm or 9am. Even then, there's still a wait, just not the hour wait you have at other times.  There's outside and inside seating. The outside seating has heat lamps so you won't get cold, but actualy, it's the top of the building so it gets pretty windy. And there aren't enough heat lamps to get you warm. One time i went and it was so cold and windy, that it just put me in the bad mood and set the rest of my visit up badly. I didn't want to stay there and then they didn't ahve the menu item I wanted. It's great when the weathers nice and sunny but when does that usually happen in San Francisco? The smoothies here are pretty good. They're pretty special and elaborate and i always like ordering them. The customer service is mediocre to bad. They pretty much just take your order and then you never see them again. A different person brings out the food and they hardly ever come back to check to see if you're okay.  I bought two gift cards for my boyfriends parents for christmas for dinner there. And they ended up giving it back to us to eat since they never go there. And when we tried to use them, we found out one of them didn't work. That's what i get for trusting a kitchen employee who doesn't know how to work the cash register to do my giftcards. What a waste of 25 bucks. If you're going to implement a gift card, you should get someone who knows how to do it to do it right, not get someone who loses people's money in the process.  The portions of the food are well worth their money. I usually have trouble finishing my plates and I eat alot. By the time i finish, i never have room for dessert. Boo =[ The food itself is mediocre. First time i ate it I thought it was great, but as i went back. The food wasn't worth the wait. And even without the wait, the food wasn't that great. It was just bleh. I could go somewhere else for cheaper and less trouble and get the same quality of food. They really should change up their menu once in awhile cause they only have a few select things that are actually worthy and then those get tiring quickly. One time i did try the strawberry shortcake and that was damn good. I would definitely order that again. Everything about it was just perfect. The shortcake was awesome, the strawberries were fresh. The whipped cream seemed fresh whipped. And the portions were enormous. I could have eaten this for dinner itself.  All in all, the food portions are worth the price here. The food itself, not so much. Customer Service is bleh. And the wait is jsut wait too long since this is the only cheesecake factory in the area. You have to go an hour away to find another place. So along with all the tourists in the downtown area with the San Franciscans, it's just too many people. Sometimes there isn't even enough room for you to wait.  Oh, no reservations. I'm not sure if reservations would make them better or not. It might slow things down or make things quicker for people who are actually on time. It would be nice if there were reservations though. That way i could actually eat when i'm hungry. 2 stars."
Marvin C.,"San Francisco, United States",100,46,41,4.0,26/7/2012,I came here a couple times just went yesterday for my girls birthday. We were told the wait was 20 - 25 mins only waited 10 mins to get seated and yes they were busy like always guess we got lucky. Our waitress was very nice and polite. The food was pretty good big portions and the cheesecake is always delicious. I thought it was hilarious how the workers came up singing happy bday to my girl. Overall we had a good time. Plenty of food to choose from and the view is real nice.

You're not gonna loose 2 pounds! You are going to gain 18! Yeah, that's right, 18 pounds! (I didn't want to reveal my real weight, so I blurred the middle digit, as you noticed..) Portions are out-of-control, so as Kristine J. suggests, takes some home. Actually, ask them to box half your meal BEFORE bringing it to your table. It'll still be enough. Prices are very reasonable for what you get.   Most meals from the 427 choices they offer vary between $10-$20. And even if you're completely stuffed after your main dish, it's the freaking CHEESECAKE factory! So it doesn't even count if you don't eat one.   So forget about the scale for now.   Pig out, eat up, and stuff yourself up  the American way."
Janney B.,"San Leandro, United States",1547,497,11,4.0,19/12/2007,"My ex-boyfriend proposed to my ex-best friend at a Cheesecake Factory.  When I learned of this, I spent three weeks getting to know some guys named Ben and Jerry - and romanticizing the so-so years Mark and I were together in college.  Then, after the sadness passed, it turned to anger. I spent three years bitter at the two of them for breaking my heart.  Over and over again, I remembered how sad I was when we broke up, how happy she was when they got together, AND how romantic it must have been when he proposed on one knee in front of a crowd at the mysterious Cheesecake Factory. When I learned there was one here in SF, I was floored.  I had to go!  What I discovered was a place that was busy, had surprisingly tasty food, and was filled with tourists.  My sandwich?  $11.00 Learning that the a-hole who broke my heart proposed at a fancy version of Denny's?  PRICELESS."
coffeecake j.,"San Francisco, United States",95,258,21,4.0,16/6/2008,"GINORMOUS PORTIONS FOR SUPERHUMANS.pumperninkle bread  endlessness. vegeterian options.  decent substantial salads. cheesecake with peanut butter and cookie dough and coconut.   dont plan on going out or shopping after eating here. you will be very heavy and walking will feel weird when you stand up. like you are travelling through molassis.  dont sit outside, even if you think it will be warm enough. even though they have heat lamps. wait the extra 20-30 minutes for an indoor table. do go here with friends you havnt seen in18 years from highschool,  and bring your yearbook and go through every page and scrutinize everything and exist for a moment like you are in the mall in the town you grew up in."
Mary Ann M.,"Aliso Viejo, United States",209,279,30,4.0,8/4/2011,"This place never fails me.  I have never tasted anything that wasn't up to par.  Some of my favorites include:  chicken marsala, ribeye steak, herb crusted salmon, miso salmon, and crab rangoon.  I like to have some red or white sangria with my lunch/dinner too.  And don't forget the cheesecake with strawberries on top!  My favorite part!"
Emma Q.,"San Francisco, United States",2,86,,3.0,4/8/2011,"Update:  Crowd-control has improved, and the key lime cheesecake is quite nice."
Nicole M.,"Lanham, United States",56,39,1,2.0,5/9/2008,"Well, I've always heard people raving about how I should go to the Cheesecake Factory and a friend of mine offered to pay for lunch today so I thought why not?  The wait wasn't nearly as long as I thought it'd be but we were also only two people and not picky about location. Took around 15 - 20 minutes for them to get us a place to sit inside, despite a moderately sized lunch crowd.  No air-conditioning. As hot as it was today. They said the AC had broken the night before and they had very little ventilation going which meant we were sweating bullets. Our server brought out some water and breezed away, not to be seen again for another 20 minutes. Boo.  He finally shows up, I order the Kobe Burger. GREASY. I mean don't get me wrong, I like greasy but it seemed a little out of place at a supposedly mid-level restaurant. The beef itself was just a little bland, like a burger I probably could've ordered at some offbrand place on Market Street. To their benefit though, the portions were HUGE...but in this instance, it was a case of quantity over quality.  My biggest gripe? When my friend put her money in for the check, our waiter asked if she wanted change. Sorry, but one of the biggest things I'd always been taught as a waitress was to NEVER ask that question. Just bring your customer their change back and if they want to leave a tip, they will. Asking if the customer wants change is a little like begging and in a high-traffic place like Cheesecake Factory it shouldn't even cross your mind to ask. Aside from all that, it was okay I guess. I wouldn't go again unless I had a specific reason for doing so (birthday, etc)."
Tina W.,"New York, United States",160,101,15,4.0,19/1/2009,"The cheesecake here is ridiculously amazing! And coming from a person that normally despises cheesecake, that's really saying a lot. The wait for this restaurant was also ridiculous. I think we got in line at around 3pm and were seated around 5:30pm. Also unfortunate is the fact that their actual food is pretty average despite what you pay."
stefanie h.,"San Francisco, United States",30,192,,2.0,19/2/2011,"i'm dumbfounded by this place.  truly dumbfounded.  by all cheesecake factories actually.  but especially by the union square one.  in a city full of unique restaurants, this must be one of the most consistently busy restaurants.  granted, they do have a nice view of union square...but really, cheesecake factory?  and the SF location isn't the anomaly...every cheesecake factory seems to have absurdly long waits 24/7. i picked up a slice of cheesecake to-go (i had to try the namesake ""stefanie's red velvet""), and waited 15 minutes for them just to open the freezer, take out the pre-cut slice, and pack it up.  15 minutes. things that i will give cheesecake factory: decent cheesecake and wide selection.  and by wide selection, i mean, like, a 50-page menu. cheesecake factory is like the mecca of chain-restaurants.  mediocre food, exaggerated decor, and cheesy theme x10.  would be fine if the wait wasn't always 45 mins +.  but if you're a tourist, please try one of SF's many unique offerings; there are other cheesecake factories elsewhere, and the wait isn't any shorter over here."
Bevy M.,"Castro Valley, United States",172,440,83,2.0,26/12/2007,"Although I've had good experiences at other branches (mainly in SoCal -- Newport Beach and Beverly Hills), I feel compelled to bitch them out about the disrespectful way they treat customers with regards to wait times.   Why not take reservations like most normal restaurants?   To tell customers that it's a 45 minute wait, then keep us waiting for double that amount of time?  I would like to send them a bill for all the time TOTALLY WASTED because they were either: 1) lying bastards 2) incompetent with table management and time estimates 3) complete idiots 4) insensitive slobs 5) apathetic because they have so much business they don't need their customers I think that if enough customers said ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore,"" and then voted with their feet, Cheesecake Factory might get the message and change their inhumane practices.   In the meantime I will choose from the many other wonderful alternatives in the area, with whom I can easily book a reservation via Open Table!"
Drue C.,"Denver, United States",332,901,,2.0,22/3/2007,"Okay, please, someone, tell me why in the world the menu needs to be 100 pages long!!!???? It is almost as long as the wait for a table most of the time, and almost as long as it takes to track down your server for anything (even though there are 100 of them in sight at any given time, along with 100 pigeons if you dine outside)."
Lisa B.,"San Francisco, United States",47,103,23,4.0,8/8/2008,"I had one of those shop-til-you drop kind of days, (not really, I only was shopping for lingere for a boudoir photo-session, but I""m not your typical girl, with tons of shopping stamina...I'd rather just never have to shop again, ever) I stopped in for a bite to eat here, and was surprised and disappointed at times, enough to merit 4 stars (I contemplated giving it 3, but the cheesecake was so damned good.) I was put off by the fact that they double booked our table.  When our pager went off (after twenty minutes, not the ten we had been promised) by the time she walked us over to the talbe, there was another couple sitting at it.  So we had to wait another ten or 15 minutes, and we were sat outside. It was foggy and sort of chilly outside, but it was really loud inside, so I didn't mnd.  Outside, there were heaters to heat the outside.  (I'm contemplating taking another star off for lack of ecology and heating the great outdoors) We ordered a Ravenwood Zin and the waiter obviously didn't know how to uncork a bottle, went through the cork, so there were bits, in my wine.  He offered to get another bottle, but when I looked at the cork, this wasn't the bottle's fault, and he would just do it to another bottle...so I just asked for a fresh glass, hoping all the cork was in the first pour. The hamburgers were overpriced and a bit bland, certainly nothing that would bring me back. But the cheesecake was delicious.  The decaf coffee was essentially tasteless and very thin and weak...like water had been added...nothing I'd get again, either. So, 3 or 4 stars...I dunno...perhaps 3.5 would be adequate."
John C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,16/11/2011,I ordered the chicken Madeira I work around the corner at the apple store I have never had this problem here before I've been here two other times in the past three months and never experienced this ever. The chicken was rubbery and the meal was cold. The quality of the food has Definitly declined an I won't be returning anytime soon. I just hope they were having a bad day just hope that the quality of there food is no going south.
Mokirobinson M.,"Chapel Hill, United States",145,161,1,3.0,10/1/2006,"They got both tastes here, sweet AND salty.   I like CF because I get to feel like a complete girl and order giant, sweet, alcoholic beverages and no one bats an eyelash.  Then I sit on the patio, soak up the view and smoke to my heart's content (so to speak).  The whoosh of traffic usually drowns out the sound of cranky children.  Or you can sneak some pina colada into their sippy cups and they fall right to sleep.  Little angels.  The food is pretty nasty but if you stick with burgers or one of the 2,000 calorie salads you can roll out of there without feeling too greasy.  Look, it's cheaper than a trip to the fly-over states...go on, visit ""Amurica"" and then relax and sink into it."
Steven V.,"San Bruno, United States",0,6,,5.0,7/6/2013,"I must say this is a difficult review to write.  You have to be jerking my chain, a native San Franciscan writing a five star review for The Cheesecake Factory, however, the facts are the facts.  This was not my first choice but a friend really wanted to have lunch here.  I made reservations for 12pm, good call because this place was hopping.  We got seated quickly and every server we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful.  The food was excellent.  I ordered the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  It was amazing (unless you eat like you are on flippin death row go with the lunch portion).  Another person had the Salmon, which she really enjoyed.  The Club Sandwich was also well received.  Then some Oreo Cheesecake and Peanut Butter Cheesecake.  Truly a fabulous lunch.  Raved about it so much my wife ended up going there the next day.  I can't say enough about the service...it was on par with the food.  We had three different servers ask us if everything was satisfactory.  They weren't a bother like just filling some type of quota, they all seemed genuine.  It was a great afternoon and a great meal.  Go figure, The Cheesecake Factory.  Like coach Mark Jackson would say ""Call my bluff."""
Rodney H.,"North Hollywood, United States",0,5,,1.0,10/11/2013,"Well first time Ive ever taken back a steak, not once but the replacement also.  The rib eye 1/2 was fat.  The fillet Mignon I could not even chew .  Stick to the cheese cake.  I left hungy and 40.00 less in my pocketbook."
Hannah Lee H.,"San Francisco, United States",16,25,,2.0,8/10/2007,"The wait is evil.  (Buzzers don't even work in most of Macy's).  The tables are too close together.  The patio is blasted by 75 MPH winds.   The servers are daft.  The menu has 8,000 ways for food to be fried and dipped in ranch sauce.   2 stars for okay cheesecake and strawberry shortcake.  Zanze's makes better cheesecake.  Hell, even I can make better cheesecake, not that I actually ever do make it.  But I can dream!   I go here only because it is my BFF's favorite.  I keep trying to convince her to go to Grand Cafe instead.  But she is hooked.  (I'd spell that ""hoodwinked""). If you do find yourself here, and they offer you the deck, scream ""Hell No, We Won't Go!""  It is so windy and cold out there.  Eat there only at risk of getting deep inner chill."
