Keara C.,"San Francisco, United States",228,108,1,4.0,21/3/2009,"I have to give it up to the Cheesecake factory chain. I usually don't like chain restaurants but this one  upholds a very high standard in the quality of their food.  I've always had a pleasant experience at this SF one. That is because I know when to go. If you live/work in the area, go for lunch at around 11:30 or past 2 (lunch ends at 5 on the weekends) and dinner before 6:30. You will avoid all the lines with the tourist and such.  I love their lunch menu. Even though they call it ""smaller"" portions, they are almost as big as the dinner size but it's almost half the price (ranges from $7-12 vs dinner $13-25). My recommendations for lunch is the pasta carbonara. This is one of the best panchetta carbonara I've had because it doesn't have the ""egg-y"" taste. Because the pasta is tossed in yolk before serving, it's hard to master the dish and make sure that the yolk does not overpower the rest of the taste. Next I would recommend the BBQ chicken salad. I don't usually like chicken in my salad but this BBQ one is tasty and tender. It is tossed in a BBQ/light ranch dressing with beans, lots of avocado, corn, lettuce, and topped with onion rings. I also love the shrimp scampi angel hair pasta. It is cooked with fresh tomato, basil, garlic, and olive oil --- sometimes the most simple dishes turn out to be the best ones.  I do have a sweet tooth and I'm a sucker for cheesecake but I find that most of the cheesecake on the menu is waaay too sweet. When I eat my cheesecake i want to experience the cheesy taste and not oreo, chocolate, banana, and the other 30 absurd flavors they have. I usually stick with the vanilla bean one (make sure you ask them to go easy on the whip cream). It's rich in cheesecake flavor with a hint of vanilla bean. yummy.  The bread is good. Love the wheat. Lastly, the ambiance is gorgeous. It is situated at the top floor of Macy's, the center of union square. On a summer night (outside is heated) or a sunny afternoon, ask for outside seating. It gives a pigeon eye view of lovely downtown SF."
Emilia Z.,"San Francisco, United States",12,2,2,5.0,9/9/2011,"I just love this place. I enjoy there no matter with or without friends. Even eat alone, there is a perfect choice."
Wayne Q.,"Berkeley, United States",58,410,230,4.0,25/3/2008,"As much as I love the menu items at the Cheesecake Factory, coming to this Union Square location is just a nightmare waiting to happen.  If you can only make it there by car, forget it, as Union Square parking is a huge mess.  And if you have to put your name in in person and wait two hours for a table, at least try to get a seat on the patio if it's a nice day.  From there, you're sailing along, but it's simply too hard to justify the wait and the agony of wandering around to largely franchised stores in the area that you could visit, most likely, in your own little town. Still, much love for the Spicy Cashew Chicken, Avocado Egg Rolls, and Dulce de Leche and Snickers Bar cheesecakes, so I can't shovel too much disrespect!  Go to the Corte Madera location, you'll be happy you did."
Neil M.,"Maghull, United Kingdom",2,3,,3.0,7/9/2011,"When I heard about the Cheesecake Factory I instantly thought it would be great given that my favourite dessert is cheesecake. My girlfriend and I decided to eat lunch here whilst on holiday in SF. Firstly the chicken carbonara was excellent. The cheesecake however, I would say was disappointing. I found the original cheesecake to be a bit odd given the use of sour cream. Also on this occasion they did not have the Dulce de Leche Caramel flavour that I originally wanted. Therefore, forcing me to select the vanilla bean which was nice but the vanilla topping in addition to the vanilla cheesecake itself was a bit sickly and difficult to finish."
Christine R.,"Marin County, United States",1630,1015,14273,1.0,2/5/2008,"Horrible experience, as we waited for over 2 hours for a table, which was outdoors only & cold as hell.  The food served was cold & bland.  This place is over-rated & has been ever since it opened at Macy's.  No one should ever come here for the lousy food & sad wait service.  This place is never cheap.  Of course everyone who goes must have a slice of cheesecake.  Go to the Marin location, less chaotic."
Nicole W.,"Pinole, United States",42,200,18,3.0,30/3/2010,"The wait here is horrible! Usually about 45 minutes for dinner and they don't take dinner reservations. But once you're in the food is great, the cheesecake is even better and there is a pretty view of the city."
Martin W.,"CA, United States",6,18,,3.0,13/7/2009,"I've been to this particular location about four or five times so far (all for special occasions) and I just can't give it more than three stars.  To be honest, I gave it an extra star just because of their cheesecake selection (which is actually really good!).  The food is mediocre, my sister got this jambalaya dish and it was really bland.  I mean the appetizers were better than the entrees...why?!   The service was pretty slow; I don't know whether our server had a lot of other tables to care for or if she was just really slow.  Either way we didn't get our drinks refilled and I guess they don't really do quality checks.  It wasn't until we were almost done with our entrees where she then came and asked how everything was.   It was both the lack of service and the quality of the food that brought  this place down two stars.  They do have a large selection, but maybe if they shrunk the menu down a little and focused on quality...that might actually help them out. Also...the all white uniforms = stupidity...saw this one guy working there with white jeans...he had something brown on the backside of his pants...maybe chocolate sauce.  Still, it looked pretty horrible hahaha!  When will they learn."
Kathy D.,"Emeryville, United States",29,12,,4.0,18/4/2009,"The cheesecake alone makes this restaurant worth it.  This last time I went, I tried the White Chocolate Truffle with Macademias and Caramel.  YUM!  Of course, that was the end of the meal, but it was so good I had to mention it first =) They have a snack/small plates menu which I hadn't noticed before.  It is nice because a lot of their appetizers in the main menu could be entrees and cost as much.  My hubby and I had the Crispy Artichoke Hearts (very tasty with a yummy dip) and the Shrimp Scampi Crostini (also tasty, but rather skimpy on the shrimp).  Also, the bread that they serve is quite tasty, too. The menu is so massive that it takes me forever to decide what I want because so many things sound tasty.  We both loved our entrees.  I had the Chicken Madeira and hubby had the Kobe Burger.  I would order both again in an instant, but will probably try something else the next time just because there's so much to choose from. The only thing that bugs is the wait, but I think it's worth it.  Go during the week when it's not as much of a madhouse.  There's a reason why there's always a wait!"
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, United States",501,390,452,1.0,28/12/2007,"I'm writing this review after ""trying"" to eat here last night. Basically there was a long line for the elevator to get to the restaurant and when the doors opened it felt like I had landed in the middle of a mosh pit. It was an absolute zoo and you could barely get to the desk where you put your name on the waiting list. After being told it would be a whole TWO HOURS to get a table I decided that I might as well put my name down and get some drinks at the bar. The next thing I heard was ""come back in 25 minutes and I'll give you a pager"". After hearing that comment I decided to leave and go to Cortez (which is a much nicer and unfortunately more expensive restaurant). Waiting to receive a ""pager"" is simply not my idea of a great night out. Cheesecake Factory needs to get a grip. I don't know why they refuse to take reservations and they need to start informing people before they get on the elevator that there is a 2 hour waiting list...I'm betting most people would just say ""Screw This"" and go somewhere else. I've eating here in the past and the food is ""ok"". The portions are enormous but I'm more of a ""quality not quantity"" type of restaurant goer. For those of you visiting San Francisco there is really no need to eat here unless you have a serious cheesecake fetish (to their credit their cheesecake is really good). There are so many better options downtown once you get out of the Union Square area."
lulu p.,"San Francisco, United States",232,202,13,1.0,27/3/2006,"Little did we know that the elevator at the Cheesecake Factory doubles as a SCALE.  For all you FATTIES who were just getting excited about digging into your cheesecake, the Cheesecake Factory is about to burst your bubble.  We had to kick out 3.5 people before this elevator would move due to weight constraints.  WTF?!!!!  Once upstairs the place is like an amusement park:  the pagers, the vacuous space, the noise, the people sitting on the marble floor waiting to be seated, the ridiculous wait for a table, the LINE for the ladies' restroom....???!!!!!    After imbibing no fewer than 3 cocktails at the bar toting a ""pager""    it's no fun waiting in line for the restroom.  ARGH!  If they didn't have a BAR I think it would have gotten NO STARS!!!"
N K.,"Berkeley, United States",57,95,16,2.0,17/5/2007,"The only decent thing about the cheesecake factory is the cheesecake. Just get it to go and eat it at the lounge of a hotel elsewhere. The worst experience that I had dining here was because of this one cocky waiter who, for some odd reason, decided that we were to be the unlukcy dumb costumers to be tortured. He was so bitchy, for no reason and incredibly cordial to everyone else surrounding us. I'm not sure why, we didnt smell, we weren't rude, and we didnt' come in when they're about to close. He would literally be smiling to the table next to us asking them if everything were alright, they needed more water, if they were ready to order, if he could bend over backward,etc. AND THEN he turns to us and become a complete ass. I asked him if we could have some bread, to which he replied: Dick: Oh you want bread"" Me: Yea.. Dick: You dont have to have it Me: ok... From then on, i didnt even bother coming here.  With a line wait that long, you'd think that people are lining up for a ticket to heaven."
Sooner S.,"CA, United States",187,67,,5.0,26/1/2009,"I love this place. It's a great place for picky people because of the large selection of food on the menu.  They have lots of food, drinks and desserts to choose from.   My favorite thing to order is the Chinese Chicken Salad.  Its got crisp wontons, orange and sesame seeds and the special Chinese plum dressing is oh so good.  It's really big and good to share with a date or friend. The next time you're downtown shopping, I suggest you take the time to have lunch at The Cheesecake Factory above Macy's."
Maggie J.,"San Francisco, United States",1,9,,2.0,20/5/2011,"Too busy, noisy, and not organized. We would have had to wait 45 minutes to sit on a Thursday afternoon around 2- the hostess kept trying to get us to try the bar and I was not going to wait that long on an empty tummy.  I like the terrace- the view is great, but I hate the pigeons and seagulls trying to steal my food. Last time we got a table on the terrace tourists kept standing right next to our table to take pictures.. C'mon people I'm trying to eat in here! The time before that we had a table inside and we didn't have a server for about 10-15 mins and all of a sudden 2 waiters were trying to fight over our table-- not very organized. By far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
Joyce C.,"San Francisco, United States",21,58,73,3.0,8/12/2008,"The food here was just alright.  Nothing really left to say you know?  There's a bit of everything on the menu, average around $15 per plate.  The wait is far too long.  I went on a Thursday night and the wait was still 45 minutes. Though the cheesecake there was pretty awesome.  If The Cheesecake Factory won't make awesome cheesecake, who will?  It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory."
Ashley D.,"Santa Monica, United States",108,121,14,2.0,23/1/2009,"Too much hype. The food is good, yes, but the place is ALWAYS packed, and I once waited for 2 hours to get food because it was the birthday girl's selection. I wouldn't have gone otherwise. It's nice to sit outside on a nice day or evening, but that's just about the only good thing, with the exception of huge portions, big enough to take home for lunch the next day! I wouldn't come back by choice. I wouldn't rate the service highly either."
Athens r.,"Union City, United States",56,134,,3.0,3/6/2008,"Three star coz I still prefer the one in San Jose. I think the place down south has more pizzazz, scheme-wise its more attractive. Tables are just too close with each other leaving you no privacy for the most part of the dining. Could almost hear what the topic on the next table is and boy that is so distracting if you wanted a good dine. Our server seemed disturbed since she forgot to give our bread. She was also slow with the refills.  I had my Fave Bistro shrimp pasta, and a regular coke. Add a passion fruit mojito by the end of your long wait and that should do the compensating for the line. If there was a category merely for the food evaluation, that would be a five, but since I love details and kind of get the feel of every place I go to if its something new--that would count a lot. So yeah, just a three."
Sinan M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,7,,5.0,26/6/2013,"Great food, can eat outside, reasonably priced"
Lovely S.,"Cicero, United States",0,7,,4.0,16/8/2011,"I am a regular customer of the cheesecake factory. I absolutely, LOVE the food but at times the waiters/waitresses can be subpar. The appetizer and entree I recommend are the: Shrimp Scampi (Entree) Tex-Mex Egg Rolls (Appetizer) The atmosphere is lively and fairly loud; the background music they play is great. I personally like the set-up of the cheesecake, the booths are roomy and it in my opinion has been beautifully decorated.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
Suzanne P.,"Burlingame, United States",0,2,,3.0,16/10/2009,"I was disappointed by this place for a couple of reasons.  Firstly my parents from out of town came to visit and we went to the Cheesecake Factory  for lunch.  All went very well, so much so that my parents wanted to go back. The service was not good at all and my wine glass was dirty.  Our waitress changed it for another dirty glass.  I then had to wait ages before I could get her attention to get a clean glass.  I was half way though my dinner before I even got to taste the wine.  This was pretty shabby in my opinion and my parents were so disappointed.  So not a great recommendation from me this time!"
