Ryan H.,"San Francisco, United States",13,45,4,4.0,24/2/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory Just saying the name makes my mouth water. I had become so accustomed to my nearest Cheesecake Factory that when moving to the city I felt a little like I was cheating on my old favorite, as the new location was quite different (in location and overall atmosphere). Yes it generally looked the same, but being in the middle of a busy city at the top of a Macy's department store was quite a change. But have no fear because what makes The Cheesecake Factory so utterly amazing has not changed one bit....the FOOD! YUM!   From appetizers, to salads, to pizzas, to pastas, to entrees, and of course cheesecake, The Cheesecake Factory will not let you down when it comes to what makes it one of my ALL time favorite chains. Personal favorites are the Fried Mac & Cheese appetizers (you heard me right), the Thai Chicken Pasta (peanutty goodness), the Chicken Madera (what wouldn't be good if it was smothered in mozzarella), and the Carrot Cake Cheesecake (heaven on a plate). Cocktails are grand too. A little pricey, but the portions are out of control, and if you go during lunch they have a whole slew of lunch items that seem just as big as the dinner portions but at a much more reasonable price. This location would have received 5 stars but there seems to ALWAYS be a long wait, which I guess is a testament of a good restaurant, but I am not a fan of waiting....especially when I am hungry!"
Angelo F.,"San Francisco, United States",639,192,4,3.0,27/7/2007,"""Wait, what did you say?""  ""I'm married....so me and my husband.....etc.""  Thats pretty much how the conversation was after I took an aquaintance and her sister to The Cheesecake Factory.  As cool as both of them were, it would have been nice to know that she was married BEFORE I took her here (Or else it would have been KFC and not Cheesecake Factory). Oh this is a review of the place...not my D.O.A. love life.  So back to the subject.  Huge portions +1  Great views over Union Square +1 Fast seating even when crowded +1 Beautiful patrons +1   My noodles were a little too salty for me -1 Overall a good night......despite the ""m"" word being brought up. I'll have to take a single girl here one time."
M J.,"Los Angeles, United States",381,224,3,2.0,11/12/2008,"Long wait to be seated, long wait to be served.  Very polite waiters and waitresses. Food- my first experience here was terrible, to be honest. I ordered the garlic noodles.. The garlic flavor was extremely overpowering, as well as the salt and lemon. I barely touched it. My second time here, I had the miso salmon, which I enjoyed very much at Elephant Bar. It was okay.  I think I have yet to find ""the meal"" at Cheesecake.. Oh, and I've never tried their cheesecake! I'd come again just to try that."
Paige C.,"Oakland, United States",53,89,19,2.0,11/12/2008,"The good as everyone mentioned is the location, that really is the only thing this place has going for it.  Even with union square being only five blocks away from the apartment, we still only come here with out of town friends/family that are afraid to try any place they don't recognize the name (ie. only ""chain"" restaurants).  So we usually take them to the factory.  The sight looking over union square especially when an event is happening is quite a view.  If you have a chance, eat outside near the edge looking over the square.   The bad is just about everything else.  Service is completely hit or miss depending on the waiter, food is bland and an over-powering taste comes from the base ingredient in most of their meals.  The place gets really packed on the weekend and waiting for a table becomes quite a mess with the hostess providing very little info or help.  Overall higher quality and better tasting food can be found within walking distance for less trouble and a cheaper bill."
Jeremy W.,"San Francisco, United States",144,269,10,1.0,26/8/2006,"If you went to CostCo and bought a half ton of cheesecake, a half ton of frozen pot pies and 500 lbs of curly fries, then imploded the whole shot over a room full of people and asked them to pay $50 a head for the pleasure you'll have gone to this place.   Basically a two hour version of Burning Man with more cologne, senior citizens and ugly babies."
Miranda P.,"Seattle, United States",6,89,5,2.0,26/3/2009,"Before eating at this location I'd always thought of The Cheesecake factory as being an alright chain restaurant. I didn't go out of my way to eat there, but if someone suggested it I didn't complain. Well, that's changed. One good thing was that we didn't have to wait long before we got seated, and though we sat outside on a cool day, the heaters kept us warm. That's the best part of my experience.  What bothered me was that I ordered a steak and asked it to be cooked ""medium"", and received medium-rare. It was cooked medium on the outsides, but once I got to the middle it looked as if it had sat on the grill for one minute before getting brought out. The center was cold and tough, and the steak itself was bland. I wanted to send it back to the kitchen to be cooked some more, but my server was nowhere to be seen. Actually, my server changed three times during the course of my meal, so if they were around I probably didn't realize it. I felt so sickened by the $29 slab of raw meat that I lost my appetite and simply waited for everyone else to get done eating. I didn't see the waiter until the check came. I think it is safe to say that I'll avoid eating at the Cheesecake Factory from now on."
Lisa T.,"Oakland, United States",253,295,10,3.0,15/4/2007,"Face it: it's all about the patio. You're waiting in line for at least half an hour, then waiting in line for ten minutes more (because they have the screwiest, most complicated waiting system ever; how important do they think they are?) just to sit outside over Union Square after a Macy's shopping marathon. Or not: I've never shopped at Macy's. I ate here to escape a barrage of come-ons from web geeks at a conference at the St. Francis.  But know this: the food isn't worth the wait. It's just, you know --- burgers and salads and typical Americana fare, prepared just --- okay. Though they do give you lots and lots of it. To the point that it's actually wasteful. And I don't really get that... No one could possibly clean their plate, even if it was the most amazing Americana fare in America. If you survive the wait for the patio, just enjoy the novelty of dining there. And watch out for the pigeons."
SF N.,"San Francisco, United States",3,93,,1.0,31/5/2008,"This review is based on my first and only visit. Our server was this fat and bald middle aged white guy. He was so rude! I understand it was hectic and busy but he was so out of line. I felt like I was being yelled at for even asking a question about certain dishes. It took him 20 minutes to even get our order down and he was practically yelling at us. I felt so uncomfortable. I don't know why I even tipped him. Next time this happens anywhere, no tip. The food was not even all that. It is decent. The best thing is the desserts, maybe they should just stick to that. To the fat and bald white server, go play in traffic!"
Hiromi N.,"San Francisco, United States",429,986,199,4.0,21/11/2008,"Don't be a hater, baby!  I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  I leave overly full...and after almost an hour wait, that is the way one should feel.    Yeah, there are more inventive restos in the City, but come on...when you want consistency and something that you know will not disappoint...well...I am Cheesecake factory. The wait is the only thing that really drags me down...really down...the line can be ridiculous...I want to eat w/in 30 minutes of arrival...anything more than that turns me off. Last trip there was for lunch after the Join the Impact Rally in front of City Hall. I was in the mood for a salad... BUT... Oh well...settled for some pasta bolognese.... Lunch for 2:  37.65 sans tip (2 lunch meals, 1 side of Mashed potatoes, 1 soda and 1 cheesecake...yyummmmmyyy)"
Emily D.,"Oradell, United States",22,97,,1.0,19/10/2007,"I'm embarrassed to write this review, and I hang my head in shame that I even ate lunch at this place. Two-hour wait for a table for two for lunch. On the outside patio, there was a guy whose job (I could swear) was to walk around and spray pigeons with water so they don't steal your food. This place is a laughable tourist trap, and I see no reason to ever suggest anyone eat here. Ever ever ever ever."
Virginia S.,"San Francisco, United States",12,35,,4.0,16/6/2009,"I usually don't go to chain restaurants but the Cheesecake Factory is an exception here in SF. The porch seating is great for visitors, the cheesecake is always a crowd pleaser, and service is pretty quick.  For an extra special non-cheesecake treat, try the Chris' Outrageous Chocolate cake. Left me speechless."
Rick H.,"Oakland, United States",401,1285,1012,4.0,26/6/2006,"Cheesecake Factory is certainly more bark than bite, except for a few important attributes which cannot be overlooked.    First, the Macy's furniture department serves as your waiting area (and you *will* be waiting).  Second, it's rooftop outdoor seating area offers a unique and breathtaking view of Union Square and beyond.  A fabulous setting in which to enjoy lunch.  Third, the avocado eggrolls and the hot spinach and cheese dip are just awesome.  Finally, cheesecake. The best you're gonna find and like 40 varieties worth.  Otherwise, of the entrees, pastas and sandwiches that I've tried, none strike me as special standouts."
JAYCE B.,"Burlingame, United States",74,260,7,1.0,11/3/2007,"Same as Palo Alto but... -perched atop a building +1 -that building being Macy's -1 -overlooks union square +1 -I have yet to get a table with any sort of view -1 -shit tons of tourists -1 -it gets stupid packed -1 Not to be a Debbie Downer but in retrospect after my PA review, I'm severely over TCF. Like I don't even want to think about it, it just isn't for me but it doesn't mean that it isn't an ok place. It is good for... tourists, families, hungry people, non-picky eaters, dates with cheesedick guys that wear too much axe body spray and that whole cast of characters."
Amy D.,"San Francisco, United States",257,80,,3.0,4/1/2009,"Too crowded on weekend nights.  The view on the balcony area was gorgeous and the ambiance inside was cozy and warm, but the wait was 1.5 hours, so we got our food to go and ate outside around Union Square.  The service was fast but not overly friendly. Nothing to write home about. If you can help it, I would recommend going elsewhere for dinner on a weekend night!"
Amy X.,"San Francisco, United States",125,303,797,4.0,1/1/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory. Definitely over-rated. I went on Christmas Eve and had to wait 2 hours. I think so many people like this place because it's not too expensive and it is REALLY pretty inside. Also, I really love the menu. They have so many different seletions. My favorite is the Chicken Madeira. The chicken isn't dry and there is cheese and mushrooms on top with mashed potatoes on the side. It was VERY delicious. It's supposedly the most popular dish. I would come to the cheesecake factory more often if it weren't for the long wait."
Sonlay V.,"Southern California, United States",221,917,283,4.0,10/2/2009,"I really enjoyed this place. I received good service and enjoyed my food. Sure it was a little pricey, but I enjoyed myself. Also you get a great view if you decide to eat outdoors. It is really nice. The only reason why I put it 4 instead of 5 stars is that you are unable to make reservations. So you will have to wait maybe two hours to be seated."
Laura W.,"San Francisco, United States",299,204,13,4.0,24/9/2007,"I looooove the food at Cheesecake, I don't care if you want to call me a boring, conformist sheep, I still love it!! They give you way too much food, but once you get used to just eating half and taking the rest home, it's a great way to have delicious lunch all set for you the next day.  Almost everything I've eaten there has been amazing (and I love the cheesecake too, although I hardly ever have room for it anymore).  They give you lots of bread at the beginning, which is good because you're starving from waiting an hour to be seated.  But, the food is always worth it! Here are some of my favorites: Thai lettuce wraps - an appetizer that is so good I sometimes order it as a meal. Crispy Chicken Costelleta - sooo good, garlic butter mashed potatoes, asparagus, and the best sauce ever. Chicken Picatta - a classic, nice and delicious. The cocktails are also excellent (although VERY expensive... don't have more than one).  I've had the bikini martini, the mai tai, some peach thingy, and others that I can't remember anymore.  But I know all of them were good! I don't go all that often because of the wait, and because I like to try new places, but sometimes you just get that Cheesecake Factory craving... mmmmm!"
Ting R.,"Burlingame, United States",86,125,5,4.0,1/4/2008,"The food was actually quite good!  I DID NOT expect that from a franchised restaurant. We went there around 6pm on a Thursday, and the place was packed.  We waited about 30 mins.  We requested outside patio seats, which we regretted after sitting there, it was freezing cold on the top of Macy's building.  Anyways, we ordered chicken Masa and my friend ordered some kind of creamy pasta dish which i unfortunately forgot the name of it.  They were both very good. It looses one star because...well, my friend wanted to smoke after the meal but unsure if she could do it at the balcony, so we asked one waiter, he told me she had to go to desinated places, then I saw a woman sitting next table to us smoking, so i asked another waitress, she said yes you may smoke here, i was like wth?"
Jessica M.,"Albany, United States",178,263,27,3.0,17/6/2007,"Underwear shopping.  At Macy*s.  And then The Cheesecake Factory... on the 7th floor?  Random, but we were hungry and familiar with the CF, so we went.  It was a 15 minute wait for a party of two to sit outside.  The view is cool, but there are a lot of tourists.  Tourists are fine with me, but they add 90% of the general confusion, sitting in taken tables, etc. I was really excited to sit outside... until the pigeons invaded, crawling all over tables that were being prepped for incoming, non-pigeon guests.  Also, bugs kept getting zapped by our overhead heater and one fell onto my spoon, writhing in burn victim agony.  This HAS to be a health code violation!  HAS TO! We all know about The CF chain; eclectic popular dishes from around the world, blanded down to the midwestern American palate.  It tastes just fine, but I don't suggest making a special trip to go here."
Christina S.,"San Francisco, United States",6,201,,4.0,16/3/2011,"Nice place and good food.  However, it's always busy over there.  We went around 11:30am and still had to wait 45 minutes for a table.  The waiter was really friendly and our food came surprisingly fast.  Overall, it's a nice place, just make reservations first."
