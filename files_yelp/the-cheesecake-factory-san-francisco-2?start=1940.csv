Mijiza M. S.,"Palo Alto, United States",111,70,9,3.0,25/5/2007,"Cheesecake - FABULOUS!!! Food - ALRIGHT... Drinks/Cocktails - UGGHHHHH!!! Don't I repeat, DO NOT waste your time at the bar... the drinks are totally watered down and eh, not so great.  The cheesecake on the other hand is worth the sometimes hour wait.  Food is decent... but then again, since you have to wait so damn long for a table anything would taste good, because you are freaking STARVING by the time you get a table.  However, all is well when you save room for dessert.   TIP: Some select Barnes & Noble that have Starbucks in them serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes... you can save yourself the headache and hit up B&N and indulge in the yummy cheesecakes.  Unless of course you like waiting around with a vibrator thingy in your hand..."
Jacquelyne L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,37,,3.0,11/7/2008,"Chain restaurants are usually so blahsee, but The Cheesecake Factory is pretty darn reliable every time. I've been to a few of CF's across the country from Cali to Jersey and down south to off to no where in Florida. Granted in every CF the wait is ridiculous, it's hit or miss with the servers, and the host staff are usually some of the most pretentious people who think they have the power over when you eat. Oh yea... at the Cheesecake Factory where the average wait is about an hour - they do control when you can commence gorging. I love the Cobb Salad, it use to be the Symphony Salad with grilled asparagus and mushrooms which I miss, but the parmesan vinegarette is amazing! It really makes the salad one of the best I've had, even distribution of bacon and chicken in every bite, evenly tossed. Love it. CF offers a very diverse menu with a little bit of everything around the world. So you can't go wrong with an empty stomach looking for a hearty meal. I could name some favorites, but the salad ranks up there and the other entrees - to each their own. But be warned - the portions are HUGE. I never finish my salads, their lunch sizes are more digestible. Dinner portions will put you into food coma. Save room for Cheesecake, the varieties are awesome. Heavenly rich though, and good to share. I love the banana cream, fresh strawberry, kona coffee, heath bar and peanut butter - to name a few. Just tonight I had a pistachio chocolate swirl which is a seasonal special - OMG... taste just like pistachio ice cream in thick creamy cheesecake. Atmosphere is generic, SF host the Cheesecake Factory on the 8th Floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square. Pretty sweet view. Another cool one is at Menlo Park Mall in Edison, NJ - it's fairly big and has this huge starry dome. The one in Boca Raton, FL is like a little Tuscan villa."
Jay P.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,11,,3.0,27/9/2010,I always make sure we stop by here every time we're in San Francisco. I  cant get over the view of the union square from their outside patio. Food is alright but the wait is ridiculously long.  But I dont mind.
Selino V.,"San Francisco, United States",57,100,2,2.0,18/7/2007,"This place is a bung hole. How often do you get a combo of bad food, high prices, horrible angry staff, and obese Americans? Every day at Cheesecake Factory. Gavin needs to walk into that place and declare it a public hazard. I'd rather see a nail place there or a check cashing joint."
J R.,"Daly City, United States",8,56,21,4.0,2/10/2007,"Me and the husband usually head over to the Cheesecake Factory after spending a day and all of our money down at Union Square...I really like all the menu choices, and always get something different every time we are there...Their strawberry cheesecake is the main reason we go there! I really don't like the long wait and the crowded mess in the front....We have left a few times just becuase it was so over crowded and nuts in there....Sometimes we gave up on the wait and just froze our bungholio's off and sat outside..... All in all, Cheesecake Factory is good..But if you are in a rush then you should probably go somewhere else!"
Christine C.,"San Francisco, United States",190,196,88,5.0,23/11/2008,"Best time to go: 10PM. Worst time to go: anytime before then. You expect to wait the 2 hours for a table. I've done it plenty of times. It sure is worth it though.  Ryry and I's Cheesecake Factory staples: Avocado Rolls - avocado buttery goodness and the tamarind-cilantro is so good I lick every delicious drop before the server takes the dish away. Pasta da Vinci - cooked in a Madeira wine sauce with chicken, mushrooms and penne pasta. Not heavy like most chain-restaurant pastas... it's beautiful. Frozen Iced Mango - yummy mango-y goodness, non-alcoholic. We've also tried: The Portabello Mushroom Sandwich - huge and delish!  Thai Lettuce Wraps - listed under appetizers but really a dish unto itself! A heaping of lettuce, chicken, two kinds of dressings, carrots, bean spouts, wonderful! Firecracker Salmon Rolls - good but only 4 rolls. Louisiana Chicken Pasta - a bit on the heavy-cheesy side. Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms - gigantic portion, really a dinner for 2! There are too many dishes to try in their never-ending menu! Everything is really good. The only down side is the possible wait for a table. It's too popular for it's own good! ***Side Note: Since you really can't get away without ordering a slice of cheesecake, take it to go because you're going to be way too full to eat it at the restaurant."
Gabor C.,"San Francisco, United States",3,26,1,4.0,29/7/2007,"I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I love this place. If anything, I come here a little too often. The service and the food is great, the selection is huuuge.  If I were them, I'd raise prices because that line is just waaaaayy too long. I'd be willing to pay 50% more if I knew I didn't have to stay in line. When you arrive, they'll give you a little wireless buzzer to let you know when your table is ready. They'll tell you that you can't take it even onto a different floor. You'd think you're grounded but this isn't true. I've happily shopped at the Borders across Union Square and returned with 10 minutes left to go on the estimated wait time. They never found out."
Lisa V.,"Corte Madera, United States",0,26,,3.0,25/9/2011,"You know, when you have small children, your dining options are suddenly equally diminutive. Some people might complain about the food here, but you know what? The food here is pretty good. Yes, it is loaded with calories, but I consider that mitigating that to be the responsibility of the diner. Service is usually terrific, and the staff are especially kind and good natured about children, which is a huge, huge, bonus. And, again. When your dining companion is a toddler, your barometer is set a little lower than the average patron. That said, I've experienced some spacey servers, too, but overall good service and a suggested respite from shopping."
George C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,21,6,5.0,24/9/2011,I LOVE THE CHICKEN DI PANA!!!!!!!!!!! Always go with my close friends it's wonderful :) and you dont have to go just for the cheesecake there are other great dishes
Mark F.,"Kittery, United States",120,24,3,3.0,3/2/2009,"The Good: RanchHouse (Ranch Hand?  Something Ranchy) Burger, made with steak meat.  OMG.  Kick-ass!  And the fries on this thing...  wow... The Bad: Waiting.  Usually.  But the last time I went, there wasn't much of a wait.  Considering it was like, a weekday night after 10pm there shouldn't be. The Ugly: The bastard that kept going out into the balcony letting the cold air in. This place is a-aight.  And the waiters seem real knowledgable, friendly and helpful.  I'd come back.  But not on Friday night!"
Dawn R.,"Culpeper, United States",78,419,883,5.0,24/10/2010,"Our server was amazing! Yes there was a long wait, but it was beyond worth it! We really wanted to sit on the patio overlooking Union Square, but it was raining so we weren't able to. I wasn't too impressed with their cocktails, but the food more than made up for it. We started off with Buffalo Blasts...amazing! They're like shredded buffalo chicken lightly fried with dipping sauces. I highly recommend it. For entrees, I got the bang bang chicken & shrimp - delicious!! It's got a Thai feel to it but isn't too spicy. The toasted coconut equals it out. It comes over white rice & I couldn't recommend it more. For dessert (to go!) I got the Chocolate Tuxedo cheesecake - yummy! Not too rich but sooo delicious! My husband got the Red Velvet cheesecake & couldn't stop talking about it. If we're ever back in San Fran, we'll definitely hot this place up again & hopefully get to sit outside this time!"
riz l.,"San Francisco, United States",360,68,13,3.0,24/8/2008,"Out of all the things I could have ordered... I go for the soup. Ant got some tasty pasta, Gindin went for a sandwich, both looked great in their own right... I go for the soup. We just finished watching Death Race (unfortunately Stallone wasn't starring in it), and I came here to eat some sopa. The wait was at least 40 min, what can ya do its union square, tourists and travellers everywhere. I watched some youtube on my iPod to pass the time, had an anchor  steam too, then they ran out. Union Square has free wifi, ummm what else... Ok basically don't order the brocolli and cheddar soup."
april p.,"Daly City, United States",5,30,,4.0,6/3/2011,"This place makes me feel like i'm in Las Vegas...flashy.  Farmhouse burger with pork belly and fried egg...so messy, so fantastic.  Kids had the crabcake sandwich and  the shrimp and bacon club, both excellent.  Friendly service and i totally regret not a getting some cheesecake to go. I won't pass it up next time and we will definitely wait for the awesome outdoor seating."
Angela T.,"San Francisco, United States",100,54,8,3.0,2/7/2010,"I have been here many times before and never had a chance to write an review and since i was there on Wednesday for  my friend's b-day i should probably write a lil something. Its hard to give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because I never feel like there food is worth the wait.  The red velvet and strawberry cheesecake are my favorite and they have great mini sliders. I order the Chicken chipotle pasta, which was by far the best dish I ever had there. They give big portion so most of the time you can just share and  If you don't want to wait for a table, try going to the bar."
Kenneth J.,"Berkeley, United States",134,91,12,4.0,13/6/2007,"I don't know what attracts me to this place but I keep coming back despite the long wait time and the crowded elevator getting to the restaurant. The food is always consistent and the service friendly. If I had to complain about something, it would have to be the plastic water glasses. Somehow I think a place like this would have glass ones.  My personal favorite is the shrimp club sandwich but expect a sandwich explosion every time. 04/27/07 Dined here before a Jersey Boys performance and the staff was very accommodating in getting my wife and I there on time."
Kathleen B.,"Long Island, United States",135,451,17,2.0,22/3/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory has a weird garbagey smell to it, and it's always SO crowded every night of the week as it's: 1.  On top of Macy's in Union Square. 2.  The only Cheesecake Factory in the city. 3.  Small in reference to other Cheesecake Factories Regardless, I'd still come here after work for some STRONG drinks and appetizers with my coworkers.  So it was either Coconut Mojitos, Tropical Martinis, Strawberry Martinis or Dirty Martinis (depending on our moods).  The apps we would all get would be the Roasted Artichokes and Mac and Cheese balls. Aside from that, you'd find the ladies of Macy's Estee Lauder here most every weekend night.  :)"
Janice K.,"Santa Clara, United States",64,16,,2.0,13/4/2011,"Cheesecake Factory never really disappoints me till I came to the one in San Francisco. The wait can get pretty ridiculous, but that's normal for some places. I've decided to eat outside so I wouldn't have to wait any longer than I have to, because I was pretty hungry. It was pretty cold out there, which is expected for SF towards the evening time. What annoyed me the MOST is how long I had to wait for a server to come to our table, and get us water. Come on PEOPLE water!!! Then it took forever to get our food ordered, and to top it off getting OUR FOOD!!! I've never waited so long for food. I thought maybe they were short staffed and it was terribly busy, BUT I was wrong. I came another time and it was the SAME shananigans -_- so disappointing, so I've come to conclusion that I will avoid eating at Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco."
Cynthia D.,"Denver, United States",25,120,,3.0,2/9/2008,"After living here for several months and remembering that I saw people having drinks near the top of Macy's, I wanted to check out what restaurant was on top so that I too could have drinks and experience the view. I was surprised at first that a chain restaurant was in this location. Food/quality: I have been to other CF locations, and this was didn't measure up to other experiences I have had. The only good thing about this one was the drinks! As for the mexican style food I ordered, it was way too bland. My dinner companions felt the same way. As a chain, I realize it has to appeal to the masses, and attempt to be all things to everyone. But in the end, it cannot be mexican, or italian, or anything else...its specialty is its cheesecake offerings! Atmosphere:  The wait was over an hour long to get our seat on the outside patio overlooking Union Square. The view is the best part of this restaurant, and I suggest going at least once especially with out of town guests if only to have drinks. Service: The server was pleasant and attentive during the entire meal. Value:  I find it a bit overpriced for the quality of the food that you receive. The servings are usually big, and we did end up with leftovers, but as mentioned earlier, the food was bland."
Jonas E.,United States,81,80,,3.0,11/11/2008,"So I went to the cheesecake factory for the first time in San Francisco and it's the same as the other two I've been to. It generally gets busy during the day especially lunch and dinner so we decided to try it during lunch and the wait was only 20 minutes so it wasn't so long. Once we got to our table which was on the roof the atmosphere wasn't so bad just  a lot of pigeons come around and annoy you so follow the don't feed the pigeon rule please. Other than that the food is the same, decent in taste and way more expensive in price. So I would think twice about going to this Cheesecake factory in the city because there is a lot more places to dine and get a better meal but I wouldn't mind coming here once in a while."
Hellyn M.,"San Francisco, United States",77,20,,2.0,19/6/2008,"I left this place full and confused, a feeling that most chain restaurants seem to inspire.   The avocado egg roll appetizer was a fun combination, crispy, soft and very tasty.  It's worth trying once.  The fried macaroni balls were bland and a gooey mess.  I had ordered the seared tuna tataki salad which was decent.  The rest of our meals were okay, fun and appetizing but nothing grand nor complex.  Definitely expect a long wait time if you arrive in the evening without reservations.  But once seated, the service is pleasant and attentive.  However, I got the impression the wait staff was hurried since it was very busy and they mixed-up some of our orders, then overcharged our bill with items we never had.  This lead to a very confusing experience.   This is my first and only experience with the Cheesecake Factory, and soon to be a forgettable one."
