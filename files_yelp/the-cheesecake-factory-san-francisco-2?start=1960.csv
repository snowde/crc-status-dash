Jamie L.,"Oakland, United States",340,688,472,4.0,26/10/2008,"I haven't been here for awhile, but when I come I do leave content, nonethless. I can't remember what I usually get, but this time around, I got the Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. I found that me, bacon, cheese, and meat have been on my menu list lately.  Sadly, the only disappointment was their daiquari was a smoothie. Yet, the service made up for that and the huge portions of food. And very resonable I might add. Lastly, this place would get a five if it wasn't so crowded everytime we came. Its worth the visit though."
Kerry D.,"New Orleans, United States",348,323,23,3.0,9/11/2007,"I don't understand why anyone would come to a culinary capital like SF and go to eat at chain restaurant you could find in any monster mall in Texas (because that's where people go to eat in Texas...any chain restaurant off the nearest freeway exit) with portion sizes to match.  But you know what, I'm not going to hate on Cheesecake Factory as much as the rest of you.  Despite having a menu the length of War and Peace, blinking pagers and probably the bitchiest hostess staff known to man, it ain't that bad.   My few trips to Cheesecake have really only been around the holidays.  I'm a sucker for Union Square around Christmas time.  The lights, the crowd, the bite in the air and the hustle and bustle of mass consumerism just makes me tingly from head to toe.  I really like the Miso Salmon, but would recommend skipping the Thai peanut noodles (think spaghetti  covered in peanut butter....blegh).   My beef with Cheesecake is that I'm convinced the waitstaff stole my hat.  I literally had just got in the elevator when I realized I left my hat at the table.  I raced back up and went back the table and it was no where to be found.  I spent about 15 minutes of my life asking different people if they had seen it, but no luck.  I wouldn't be so suspicious if 3 employees hadn't complimented me on it earlier.   Shady Mofos."
Kanani S.,"Santa Rosa, United States",69,232,85,3.0,10/12/2012,"The place is beautiful, great views of Union Square and a nicely decorated restaraunt. The only problem is that they DON""T take reservations and they are almost always extremley busy. Came here at 5:30 on a Friday night and the wait was already an hour long, with two little kids waits like this are almost unbearable but the upside is that you're at Union Square, lots of places to take the kids to occupy them for that hour. Once we were seated our waitress was ok, nothing special about her. I ordered the chicken carbanora, it was just ok, i asked for extra bacon and i think they forgot it? The sauce needed a little more salt and pepper as well, it lacked in flavor. My husband had the hibachi steak w/ wasabi mashed potatoes, his meal was spot on. The kids had the mac n cheese and mini corn dogs w/ fries, both meals were good, the kids loved the mac n cheese. Given the chance I'd probably go again just because I love The Cheesecake Factory and some of their other items on the menu."
Tracy N.,"San Francisco, United States",13,25,,3.0,3/4/2008,"Why every time I try to go and enjoy a meal in the best location in San Francisco with the terrace on Union Square, I have to wait 40-50 minutes? They should give priority to locals!! If I have one hour lunch break I want to be able to enjoy the city I live in, I don't have all that time to wait in line... Their salad are amazing though!!"
spiff e.,"San Francisco, United States",55,462,146,3.0,1/8/2006,"Almost always a super long wait and the food isn't that super special.  But they do have some items that I don't mind getting again and again when I do go, like the avocado eggrolls, the crispy crab wontons, the georgia peach and the carrot cake.  Not all in one sitting though, that'd be craziness because their portions are huge, made to be shared (but I usually don't). Easy place to bring tourist friends after shopping since the patio offers a nice view of Union Square.  I wouldn't come here with family though, it's way too loud and theme-y."
Levi B.,"Cook, United States",10,169,28,4.0,26/4/2008,"YES, I am review number 500!!! Oh god that cheesecake was good.  I got a slice of the chocolate tuxedo. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM­MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.  The left overs were almost as good as the first go 'round.   We stopped in without a reservation on a Saturday night so there was no possible way of getting a table.  That was fine, we got our delicious cheesecake and went else where to eat.  It looked like it would have been cool to sit out on the balcony though, and eat and look out over Union Sq."
Corrie B.,"San Francisco, United States",18,38,,1.0,13/11/2007,My Cheesecake Factory Haiku by corrie b. cheesecake factory empty my wallet and soul I hate Union Square Thank you.
Montina M.,"Daly City, United States",29,12,,2.0,1/4/2009,The food is so-so but the well mannered dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives is worth the trip downtown from time to time.   The reason for 2 stars... I had dinner at the bar with my bf last Friday.  I am very careful with my belongings and put my purse on the floor near my feet for security.  My wallet was somehow stolen right out of my purse and I got a call from my bank about irregular charges of almost $400 by the time I was leaving the restaurant.   When I went into the bank (across town from the restaurant) on Monday the rep I spoke to told me he had someone with the SAME story last week!!  I wish that the Cheesecake Factory would at least notify their patrons so that we can be extra cautious.  In their defense everyone I delt with was very nice and helpful... I just think they need to do a little more to put a stop to this!
Olive Q.,"Daly City, United States",34,20,29,3.0,26/3/2008,"The service here is slow, and there's a pigeon problem when you eat outside.   Everything on the menu taste a little better than average.  The Habachi steak is my favorite.  The cocktails are pretty good that's if your waiter ever return with your drinks.  I've been here a few times, and it's usually the same situation everytime.  Also, Cheesecake factory is great example why you DONT order Asian food at an American restaurant.  Dont order the spring rolls or sushi. Does anyone know why their floors are ALWAYS so greasy?"
Jeff T.,"Daly City, United States",56,76,5,4.0,14/1/2009,"Got there today around 6:30p.m... The fiance and the roommate and I got seated pretty quickly... This time on the side where the bar's located.  I never sat on that side before.  The food was good... I ordered the Salisbury steak. I got full from eating the mash potatoes.  Ordered two 7 and 7's.  Didn't really taste the Seagrams...  My roommate had three martini's with regular vodka...  It taste like crap.  So, thumbs down to the drinks.   Waiter and waitress were very friendly and tend to our needs when they had the time.  So it was an ok experience..."
Ari C.,"Daly City, United States",169,356,443,3.0,17/6/2007,"Cheesecake Factory's ain't that bad. Really. I like the food, service is fine, but they're not worth the 3 hour wait. If you have a party of 5 or larger, you'll feel like you're in some psychology test measuring your patience. Once you're seated, it's actually a pretty nice restaurant with decent food. A bit noisy, but when you're on a date and totally into your date, just staring straight into your date's eyes is enough (awww) :) I'm just kidding, it gets pretty annoying actually. Food wise, I like one of their pasta dishes that has fish and arugula... I think. I'm bad with food names, sorry. The boy likes the jambalaya. I've never actually ordered their cheesecake though. I probably will someday, just cause it's called cheesecake factory. You're supposed to eat cheesecake made in their factory, right? A mini highlight of the night: I saw the SF Brown Twins ( ) here!"
Malika K.,"Los Angeles, United States",93,108,24,2.0,12/6/2006,"Looks like an over-sized Starbucks, maybe they had the same interior designers. I like the exclusive location,(on the top floor of Macy's)but by no means is this restaurant exclusive! Expect a two hour wait if you don't want to squeeze yourself into the bar. Yes they have a large variety of cheesecakes but it's quantity over quality. If you want good cheesecake just go to Blue Plate. I have a friend who really enjoys this place for some reason so I do eat here on occasion. The food to me is mediocre, similar to Apple bee's with an Asian fusion twist. *update* 12/30/6 Why do I continue to torture myself?? Over an hour wait for a table today...and then, why were all our plates, silverware and water glasses not clean? Why did our waitress neglect us?  Just a tip...if your gonna wait it out for a table mosey on down to the furniture floor with your pager there is an extreme lack of waiting room in the restaurant."
Geoff K.,"San Francisco, United States",81,199,3,3.0,25/11/2006,"Now I know why Americans are fat: restaurants like this.  You sit for two hours waiting to eat, and then you eat food that is either deep-fried or otherwise reconstituted to be as unhealthy as possible for you.  It honestly took me ten minutes to find something vaguely not unhealthy on the menu.  I'm not a health freak, but this place is absurd.   Also, there are just too many choices.  The kitchen must take up a floor of Macy's to be big enough to turn out all these options.  I will say they made a nice martini while we were waiting.  The decor is absolutely atrocious.  Think PF Changs on acid.  Our waiter was definitely high, which is understandable.  We split some spinach dip (good) and then I had a burger (quite good) while she had lettuce wraps that took up half the table.   I wanted cheesecake, of course.  But unless you're a morbidly obese red state tourist or an offensive lineman for the 49ers, I just don't see how you can have room for dessert after eating here.  I had to be wheeled out on a stretcher.   This restaurant is the epitome of why mass food sucks.  The fact that tourists dine at this spot in the middle of San Francisco is a crying shame.  That said, I thought my burger was pretty good.  And the place is inexpensive."
Becka T.,"Bay Area, United States",70,72,12,2.0,28/5/2008,"I like the idea of the outdoor rooftop seating, overlooking union square... but the family of pigeons that dined with us KILLED the concept.  My burger was pretty good...medium rare just the way I like it. The seared ahi tuna appetizer roll was pretty good too.   The major downfall were the crowds of people waiting for seating, which made the environment chaotic and unorganized. The set up of the restaurant is cramped and complicated. Someone had to ask us if they could borrow a vacant chair from our table so their elderly grandmother didn't have to stand while waiting for their table.  Not accommodating at all! This place is just like a pricier version of elephant bar, macaroni grill, or applebee's. Overall, kinda ghettttoooo... and not too exciting... Cheesecake Factory ..ain't all that"
Jacqueline N.,"San Jose, United States",312,248,84,4.0,13/2/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory. It's a nice restaurant. My friend and I were roaming San Francisco and decided to come here to eat since we just couldn't decide on anywhere else. It was on top of the Macy's building which you can walk out and wait for your table there. The view is lovely, of course! You can also sit outside which wouldn't be too bad since they put up some sort of plexiglass to keep the wind from hitting you. There are heat lamps, too. We were sat within 15 minutes. I ordered the steak diane-- delicious! I love the mashed potatoes that come with it and the sauce is amazing. My friend got the chicken madeira which is another favorite of mine. The sauce they put over that chicken is so good. We decided to be fancy and get a bottle of wine. We chose a german riesling that was about $35 a bottle. Worth it. The service was good. The server kind of took out plates a little prematurely, but I guess since we wanted to get dessert we didn't mind too much.  White chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Talk about orgasm in your mouth! Sorry for that inappropriate comment. But it was just so good. BTW, other times I've gone here (Other locations) I've gotten the Louisiana pasta, breakfast burrito, fried artichoke hearts, fried calarmari, herb crusted salmon-- all good!"
Nick G.,"Stockton, United States",0,1,,1.0,19/2/2012,"Was in town with my wife and kids visiting my sister who lives by union square... I had been to cheesecake factory several times when I worked in SF.. So I decided to take my family.. It was a Saturday so I knew it would be busy.. But we decided to make reservations.. We got to our table pretty quick.. Our server was pretty nice in the beginning.. I asked him for some suggestions on my chicken plate.. He offered a few and everything was ordered for dinner.. During our meal, we needed a few things that took awhile to get but it was busy so we were understandable.. After the meal, our server said he would be going on break... And introduced us to a lady.. She brought us our check and that was it.. I paid with a credit card.. And she brought the bill back.. I signed and put zero tip... Cause I had $10 cash in my pocket.. So, I left that on the table and we got up to leave.. The meal was pretty good and overall service was the same.. And for only 3 people eating I thought $10 was plenty for a tip.. As we walked to the exit, the server that was supposably on a break chased me down and asked ""sir..sir.. How was your dinner?? Was everything ok??"" I simply said.. Yeah.. Food was ok.. Why?? He then gave me an odd look and walked away.. I was totally confused.. Why did he run up to me when we were leaving and ask??? As we started down the escalator the girl that had replaced the server walked right behind the server and said ""hey.. They left $10 on the table.. Cheap asssses""... I was completely shocked and I wasent sure if I heard her right.. My wife then said ""did she just say what I think she said???""... I just couldn't believe it.. I am still in shock.. A few days after.. My wife sent an email to the cheesecake factory email and never got a response.. That's pretty sad that they can't even respond.. I don't think I will ever be going back.. Not even for the cheesecake.. =("
Sarah F.,"San Francisco, United States",194,497,,3.0,18/3/2008,"You must have patience to come here... the wait can be nuts.  Also, you must be REALLY hungry to come here, as the portions can feed a small village.   I do love the drinks here, especially the Bellini, which is ice blended.  However, I can never taste the alcohol, but maybe that's the point. I enjoy the turkey burger here, very much.   Last time I came here, I got food poisoning, which was *not* fun.  I think it was the spinach cheese dip.  It was delicious, but um, deadly.  The fish'n'chips are yum, however, the fries were a bit overdone. Everyone and their mother comes here, so I find it's nice to get the food to go, and eat in Union Square."
Mel P.,"San Francisco, United States",288,831,,5.0,23/11/2010,The Banana Cream Cheesecake. HELL YES! You must eat it. Delicious. Drool...
Laura L.,"Campbell, United States",71,76,49,4.0,29/3/2008,"GREAT food! i got the pasta carbinara and it was excellent. plus the portions are so huge i only finished about half of it and took the rest home. we did have to wait for about an hour till we were seated, but it was worth the wait. plus the Macy's furniture section is right there so we just sat in the comfy couches until it was time. it is pretty expensive, but seeing as it was practically 2 meals, it was OK. the place was pretty packed as well but my overall experience here was good."
Nico s.,"Oak Park, United States",169,33,6,1.0,18/3/2011,"I'm here and 20min later I was called, great right! Well the service diminishes here. We are seated and the waitress is training some guy, I order the sweet corn tomales twenty min later my guest ordered fried zucchini and in 5min they magically appear. For drinks we ordered 1 mango smoothies and onestrawberry martini. The waitress was just really really bad."
