Alyssa G.,"San Francisco, United States",58,94,,2.0,31/12/2010,"I hate to give such a poor rating to a place with delicious drinks and desert and which I have had great experiences in the past, but the service a this location is TERRIBLE. I understand what a busy location it is, being in union square, and I can be very forgiving. However, waiting for 2 hours to get seated, then continuing to wait for a drink (the wrong drink), and finally waiting for our completely absent server to mosey over so we could simply get the check left me feeling very neglected. My friend was promised shoestring onions for his burger that never came, and although the food is good (especially the Buffalo Blasts appetizer) I think in the future I will pass on the Cheesecake Factory."
Sonya T.,"San Francisco, United States",112,232,34,3.0,18/11/2008,"The reason why I am rating this now, is because I am f*cking hungry and nothing sounds better to me than a philly cheesesteak from the Cheesecake Factory with original cheesecake (topped with strawberries) for dessert.  YUMMY and surprisingly, cheap.  You can spend a lot here, and you just might, if you come during rush hour and have to wait 2 hours to get a table.  Here is a good tip -- try going at 830, it might not be too long, and you can hawk the tables in the bar area to get seated sooner.  And the pagers will reach all the way to the 3rd floor at Macy's (I've gone shopping many times, waiting to sit).   The buffalo wing popper thingies are also really good.  It's an appetizer.  I like Cheesecake Factory a lot."
Marie Lynn M.,"San Francisco, United States",1,15,,4.0,20/8/2011,"Huge portions and very yummy! I went here with my friends and we had a pretty big group. It was such a long wait--2 horrible hours!--but it was worth it. The waiter, Billy, was so funny and fabulous. This place is great!"
Jeff O.,"San Francisco, United States",8,55,14,4.0,8/8/2010,"I love this place for their Chinese chicken salad, chesecakes and their avacado egg rolls. The wait is what takes the star away."
Emily G.,"San Carlos, United States",15,160,,3.0,21/12/2010,"We were seated outside fairly quickly, for a change. My fish tacos, rice and beans were lukewarm, and I had to bug the waiter about my husband's overdue steak, which arrived well done, instead of medium rare. When I complained, the waiter played passive aggressive by making himself scarce. The food was just okay, as usual, (menu is way too thick), and the crowds and service get in the way. Just the normal Union Square challenges. Nordstrom's Bistro at San Francisco Center is still more reliable."
Cassandra L.,"Murrieta, United States",29,2,,1.0,9/6/2013,"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory in SF was horrible, and I will probably never eat at another one again. To start, I have a severe food allergy, so to those who also have one I'd strongly suggest not eating here. I have a severe peanut allergy and the waitress was honest and  told me all of the stations in the kitchen have peanuts, since they make a wide variety of Asian dishes. I was hesitant on ordering anything at all, as it would be at my own risk. However, she reassured me that I would be accommodated and she would let the kitchen know about my situation and they would be very careful. It made me feel safer  so I ordered my meal. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with my food, which oddly came with onion rings on top?? I thought that was a strange food combo, haha. 5 or 10 minutes had gone by since I had received my food when the waitress came by and said there had been a mistake with my meal. My plate was supposed to come WITHOUT the onion rings, which happened to be fried in PEANUT OIL. I was shocked that such a huge error was made without it being caught by anyone in the kitchen. I had her take back my meal and told her I was done eating for the night. The one thing I was trusting the restaurant to keep out of my food, was carelessly sitting on top! It is a horrible feeling to have to think about death while doing everyday things like sitting down to eat. It is also a horrible feeling knowing you're trusting your life with those handling your food, only to have a mix up that could have killed you! To me, it showed a lack of concern for my particular situation. I was never offered a comped meal or even an apology from the waitress or any other staff/managers for that matter. It was not a happy dining experience!"
Brandon L.,"Spring Hill, United States",41,165,127,5.0,6/9/2010,Plain and simple. I LOVE eating on the top floor of the Macy's building overlooking union square! The food here is amazing! It tastes ten times better when your sitting outside on a clear day looking at the beautiful city! Thank God for San Francisco!
Tony G.,"Fremont, United States",40,15,,4.0,13/5/2008,"OK, so I have tunnel vision. I love the Cajun Chicken Littles with their honey mustard and the mountain of mashed potatoes and seared ear of corn so much that I would never so much as notice another sexy entree. And the aptly named Black-Out Cake? At long last, plausible deniability for dieters. I'm sure if they charged by the calorie, I'd be their favorite customer."
Jane D.,"Fremont, United States",203,604,8,3.0,20/8/2006,Everyone is hatin this place. Its the biggest restaurant in the downtown San Francisco. I think it its to be expected. So if you go in with the expectation that you're going to wait until the next election..your experience will be fine. We sent my fiance to wait for a table while we shopped. He just played video games on his phone until our table was ready like 2 hours later. NO sweat...expectactions...its all about expectations...
Lauren F.,"San Diego, United States",656,700,112,3.0,13/12/2006,"3:00 weekday on the patio during a warm day.  That is the only time you should come here.  Lines are terrible, food is well priced for what you get, but the wait alone makes it totally not worth it.   What i never understood about this place (and ill be honest, i worked here for a year and a half), is how people can wait that long for food!  Valentines day, people come in and wait 3.5-4 hours just for a table that is so close to the next one there is no privacy.  Im sorry, but if my date was to ever even think about taking me here on valentines day, id break up with him or never talk to him again.   It shows me that: a) he didnt have the plans made ahead of time and this is totally last minute.  b) i could have eaten two meals in that time...make me a meal at home, more romantic than sitting in a lobby with crying kids, and  c) that this is the level he thinks of me.... But....go here on a wednesday at 3 and have a JW's pink lemonade on the patio, and you will be a happy camper.  Or sit at the bar, and ask for the cute bartender Mandy...tell her Lauren sent you. The staff is great too."
Autumn K.,"Helsinki, Finland",508,1139,4,2.0,26/9/2006,"Let's get something straight right off the bat: I'm not really a chain restaurant kinda person. I just can't handle a million generic menu items, a restaurant that seats 1,000 people, and having to carry a remote device to be notified when my table is finally ready. But alas, I gave in and met friends there. Twice. The first time, I got drunk and had to leave before we were even seated because by the time I was less than confident in my ability to walk, we had been waiting TWO hours!!!  The second time I went for the ovrewhelming noise, overpriced drinks, and mediocre food, and stayed for the puke fest that followed...and Nooooooooo, I was not drinking excessively that night. I had only had one glass of wine. And it was a puke FEST because there was more than one of us doing the puking. Two of us who shared food both got sick. So there."
Jasmin G.,"New York, United States",121,512,6,4.0,20/7/2006,"If you're visiting San Francisco, you should totally go here.  I've been to the cheesecake factory in Pennsylvania but the one in California is just so much better due to location.  Its located on the top level of the Macy's in Union Square.  There is an outdoor balcony where you can go to see the entire city.   Very fun experience.  I got a salad - I don't even remember what kind - but I always get the same thing when I go.  The portions are huge and the food is tasty.  The one thing that was a minus was that we asked for a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake and they were out of them, then we asked for oreo and they were out of those as well, we even asked for one more - and they were out of them!  I guess that means they sell fast - but come on..keep the cakes in stock!  Anyways, it was delicious - I love cheesecake factory..I haven't been to one since then and that was a year ago..but if you've read any of my other reviews i'm sure you can presume why.  If I lived in San Fran I probably would never go to CF, but I'm a tourist and its a tourist spot.  Oh one major minus is that the wait is insane and they don't allow you to call to make reservations.  That's definitely a minus"
Gina T.,"Redondo Beach, United States",29,15,7,3.0,15/9/2011,"This is one of my favriote restaurants in my favriote part of San Francisco.  Great service. Refreshing mix of locals, tourists and hipsters alike. Not to mention it is in the prime of prime of locations."
Stacey L.,"San Francisco, United States",35,192,20,3.0,21/3/2008,"The wait is just way......tooo.....looooong!  On weekends you can be waiting 1-1.5 hours for a table.  I used to come here often in high school.  I guess I didn't mind fighting the crowds and waiting then.  I don't have the patience now so I've been here a few times since HS.  The last time I came here was after a movie, around 9:45pm.  I didn't think I'd have to wait long for a table.  Boy was I wrong!  It was packed!  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table!  I don't like the fact that they don't take reservations. The portions are huge!  They have some good pasta dishes.  Their cheesecake is yummy.  I love the wide selection of flavors. Nice view.  Average service - sometimes they get busy and you have to wait awhile.  Indoor and outdoor seating. If not for the long long loooooooong wait, this place would probably get 4 stars."
Nancy Y.,"Los Angeles, United States",317,257,47,4.0,27/1/2008,"""Hi, welcome to the Cheesecake Factory, may I help you?"" During my brief stint as a hostess at the Cheese while I was in college, I chanted his line a billion times. So here's a rundown of how things work here and why things are the way they are here.  1) ""Unfortunately, the cheesecake factory do not take reservations"" - Yes, the wait time is ridiculous. 2 hours on a friday night, what are you thinking you might ask. To be honest, the Cheesecake Factory IS highly demanded. It really is that busy. As a hostess here, I know first hand that they do seat you in the fastest, most efficient way possible. The technology they use to schedule seating is much more advance than any other highly demanded dining establishment. Basically, the second that a guests leaves, that table will be cleared and ready to seat within 1 minute time. It's very difficult to do reservations because the demand is already high enough without reservations. 2. ""This menu is a novel!"" Yeah, you're not the only person that noticed. One of the reasons why people frequent the Cheese so much, even with the wait, is because the menu is highly eclectic. Can you think of any other place that can accomodate every person's taste? In the mood for asian? No problem. In the mood for pizza? No problem. Mex? There's Tex-Mex available... It's just the easiest non-planning option. And we all like consistency to know that the food is good every single time.  3. The desserts are NOT made in the restaurant. Yeah, sad as it may sound...they are all shipped day-of from the corporate headquarters in Calabasas Hills. Bet you can't tell can you? 4. If you want the booth seat, ask for it in advance. Those are most difficult to come by. You have to request for it in order to guarentee to get it. Otherwise, you could be waiting a very, very long time after you have been promised normal seating. I am reviewing the SF location, because the scenery there is absolutely gorgeous!! It is located on the top floor of the Macy's tower and provides an excellent view of the city. It's a very nice setting. I have tried most of the menu, but the best dishes are: Appetizers: Can't go wrong here. Most are great, but the spinach dip, artichoke, and avocado eggrolls are excellent Entrees: - Chopped salad - Chicken maidera - Steak Diane  - very, very tender. - Miso salmon Desserts/drinks: If you like sweet drinks, the best is the peach bellini. You barely taste the liquor at all. - Vanilla bean cheesecake - Strawberry shortcake - Pumpkin cheesecake -- this is highly seasonal, but it's a great alternative to pumpkin pie. It's really something you must try - Strawberry cheesecake On Sunday mornings, they have a special brunch menu. The belgian waffles and the eggs benedict are definitely the most popular pick. It's gorgeous and tasty!! Note that I no longer work at the Cheesecake Factory. But surprisingly, this is the place I will still go back and eat just because it really does provide a great atmosphere and great food."
Erika L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",2,6,6,4.0,11/1/2011,"went there before the new year eve, and the wait was 2 and half hour, i was in shock to hear that but worked out perfectly because we went for ice skating for an hour in the union square. Food was nice, nothing fancy but service was excellent even in such a busy hour. Had couple of margaritas and it was good. overall had a descent time but their patio is beautiful and surround by heaters to protect you from SF chilly weather."
Chengyu Z.,"Berkeley, United States",211,1,,4.0,27/7/2011,"I am a foreign student here. I went to this restaurant two weeks ago. In general, it was a nice place to have dinner. The decoration was cozyHowever, there were so many guests that day that service staff hardly had time to serve us.But the most important part was fine--the food! We had seven people and all the dishes we ordered were delicious especially the cheesecake. What's more, the components of dishes were really huge so we didn't finish them all. And the prices there were average level. In brief, it's a good choice to have dinner there. And making a reservation in advance is a time-saving."
Csndra L.,"Anaheim, United States",5,93,2,2.0,15/6/2008,"I am writing this review as I am sitting at this restaurant right now. Pleasant brunch up until dessert time...but.. 1) Waitress forgot about our cheesecake order after she came by twice within the 10 minute gap so we decide not to get it anymore. Didn't come back til 15 min later. .......She just came by right now, omgwtfbbqholyshit. 2) Walked by us multiple times and did not say ""what would you like?"" 3) Kinda hated the fact that they kept switching waitresses on us. o,O.. 4) Sat us at a unwanted spot outside until we had to request if we can move. Kept on telling us to hold on, whats the big deal? Its just a seat. Aye all this over brunch.....drama.. Oh and there's some little kid behind me right now and her dad talking loud, give us some fucking space would ya... OH! It's not even that busy right now, so slow service don't you think? -,-.... It is 3:22pm right now and we still haven't gotten our check back."
Mimy P.,"Berkeley, United States",5,18,,3.0,22/5/2011,"Today was the third time that I've visited The Cheesecake Factory and it was an okay experience. Unlike the past two times, we didn't have to wait at all for a table. I would suggest arriving early to avoid the long wait (i.e. more than half an hour).  I had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which is ""penne pasta tossed with broccoli, oven-dried tomato, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts"", quoted verbatim from their menu. Unfortunately, the reality did not match the description. There weren't any peppers or tomatoes in the dish. A bunch of the penne was clumped together. Overall, the dish was really bland. I would recommend their chicken marsala and mushrooms instead. I've had it in the past and it was much more flavorful.  The saving grace, however, was the service. The waiter was really attentive and checked up on us several times. Our bread basket and drinks were refilled several times. It was my friend's birthday so the waiters sung her happy birthday and gave her a free dessert as well."
Destry H.,"Alameda, United States",188,207,998,4.0,27/2/2007,"Without a question:  Great food.  Long Wait (Avg 1-1/2 hours ), Good drinks Then it is do-able. Many good appetizer & entrees. The host/hostess at times get snippy...you can contribute that to the volume of people always asking ""how much longer?"" None the less, once you're seated, service takes an upswing and the splendor of a great meal,drinks and desert take over!"
