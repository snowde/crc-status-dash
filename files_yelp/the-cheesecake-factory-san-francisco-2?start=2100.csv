John M.,"San Francisco, United States",5,41,1,4.0,21/9/2012,"Came here cause I was craving for some cheesecake. Just hate it every time I come here, I need to wait."
Michelle L.,"San Francisco, United States",160,31,24,4.0,8/7/2008,"This is how I like to end a day of shopping. There are some really good pluses about here. I think the inside is nice and roomy for restaurant attached to a department store. Then there is the view from the patio. It is pretty but I always find it too windy to sit outside.  The food is good. They have a good selection of American food. The portions are large and you can definitely share. Call me weird but I love their bread. I know its the most simple thing that they could offer but its warm and it taste sooooo good. I know that they are known for there cheesecake but I have always been too full to even attempt dessert.  Even after all the positive things, there is one thing I can't stand. The wait is absolutely horrible. I understand if you're in the area and want some good dinner but does everyone in the bay area all have to come out on the same night? I've been there right when they open so the wait is only like 5mins and I've been there when the wait is 2hours. Its a nice and cozy restaurant and I would love to go back."
Casey W.,"Santa Rosa, United States",2,8,1,3.0,26/2/2011,"The location of this place is what makes it. I mean on top of Macy's :). It's such a nice view. The food is good, but the cheesecake is amazing!! I suggest the Red Velvet cheesecake o my goodness it's delicious!! The pieces are huge so you can definitely share one, although you may want to get your own ;)."
Jessica D.,"San Francisco, United States",197,278,49,4.0,28/12/2006,"Is there a little factory hidden inside each Cheesecake Factory location? If there is then they manufacture some good (but overpriced) food.  Albeit that the Cheesecake factory atop Macy's at Union Square is a great spot to sit out on the patio (weather permitting) and have a cocktail it's a big time tourist spot.  Other than that, I demand you order a fruity drink.  I happen to love big buildings and the views of them from in, atop, and next to them. This restaurant in the sky is a nice place to begin a night out."
Dwayne A.,"San Francisco, United States",93,134,1,3.0,19/7/2007,"OK, I live in fear of leaving a meal hungry -- especially in foodie-riddled San Francisco where you get a little nubbin of something on a small plate dotted with ""a **insert pretentious fruit combo here** sauce"" and then max out your credit card to pay for it.  Been there, done that, over it. So, I can relax when I go to the Cheesecake Factory because the portions are actually too big even for ME to successfully finish without gaining a stretch mark or 5. However, the wait is dramatic.  Oh my god.  You ask for a table and they send you away, asking you to come back in 30 minutes ... to get your pager so you can wait another 45 minutes.  Yikes, y'all. And then the bar is so crowded it's nearly impossible to get a drink or sit down. It's also a little pricey. But of course, you actually get your money's worth, piled on your plate. So much saturated fat up in this house though.  There really should be a warning.  I got that hamburger that has STEAK on it.  yes, a hamburger topped with more beef.  And I liked it. The only other restaurant that is more likely to kill you is the ELEPHANT BAR where the portions are actually, if you can believe this, larger, IMHO. But this wait situation, man....so not worth the wait unless you have time to kill, are okay with shopping at Macy's for a while, and know that you won't actually be hungry for another hour when you get your table. Service is fine, of course, the staff seemed to be having a good time when I was there last and that's actually as important to me as the food. The view is very, very cool as well.  Make your own decision, love it or hate it!  At least you know what you're in for."
Sarcastic T.,"San Francisco, United States",33,446,7,3.0,30/8/2009,"I'm shocked I'm giving a chain restaurant 3 stars. The lines are long, the chaos is un-real, no reservations allowed and I'm STILL giving them 3 stars. Each time I've been here the staff have been pleasant and they seem to have over-hauled the menu recently. The well-mannered martini is tasty and the thai lettuce wraps are so yummy. Tried the beet and goat cheese salad and the ahi tuna and was pleasantly surprised by both. The tuna was mild and pretty heavy on the avocado and the beet salad was small (especially for the Cheesecake Factory) but overall - it was all decent. Obviously a great place if you have kids!"
Mace M.,"San Lorenzo, United States",132,370,26,2.0,27/5/2009,"This restaurant is highly over rated. Are all CFs this way? Not in my experience, but this one is absolutely horrid. Yes, the decor is gorgeous, and yes the restaurant and bar have amazing ambiance, but the service is some of the worst I've ever had, and the general operations of this restaurant are so out of tune, I don't see how they stay in business.  This Cheesecake Factory is much like having a 1971 Buick Riviera. A huge bucket, with a massive oil leak, and a shitty water pump, and you're amazed that even though it is a pile of junk, it still somehow manages to operate. My last visit, will remain my last visit, unless I hear they have had some drastic changes. I went in with some friends, three to be exact, and went up the elevator to the top floor and went to put our name in. It was going to be a forty-five minute wait, that is fine, especially for the dining experience which my friends hadn't had yet. The three-quarter-hour wait turned into just over three hours- pay attention, this is why they didn't get one star- which we spent in the bar. The bar, is amazing. Ample seating and standing room, great bar tenders and even better drinks, a bit pricy but it is expected at a place like this. Then, this is where the downward spiral begins. We get seated outside, which is fine because it wasn't cold and they had the patio heaters on low, too, which helped. So, we're starving and we glance at the menu and are immediately ready to order, but it takes about twenty minutes for our waiter to get us waters and take our order. To our amazement, there isn't really anything left to order! We kept ordering things from the menu to find that they were ""out"" of a lot of stuff. In the end, we ended up all ordering the same thing because we were assured they weren't out of that. Our waiter runs off to put our order in, and comes back promptly, now what? It seems that they only have enough to make three orders, needless to say I'm not even hungry anymore, and I opt to share with my friend. I didn't see our waiter for the rest of the meal, as we were served our dinners by some other wait staff, and never got a refill, or anything.  I don't know what kind of restaurant they think they have, but with no reservations, and ALWAYS a long wait, poor service and running out of food- this is just an unacceptable dining experience, and I warn anyone who reads this to avoid this place at all costs."
Sang N.,"San Francisco, United States",6,37,,1.0,13/10/2006,"Cheesecake factory is a fitting name. Although they have a large selection of cheesecakes, they're all the same. It's like there was a conveyor belt of plain cheesecake and someone added one different ingredient to each one: Plain cheesecake with chocolate chips, plain cheesecake with peaches, plain cheescake with a garnish and so on... boring!  The staff is stuck up. They think that memorizing a big yet unexciting menu makes them experts in food and wine. It only makes them experts in sysco products. Last time I was there (and I mean the last time), we were on the patio and we asked if we could move closer to a heater. The waiter said, ""sure"" so we moved. Moments later, the hostess came by and yelled at us. Then, since we apparently moved into another waiter's station, the new waiter came out and yelled at us too. Plus he was wearing cut-off cycling gloves... gross! He then ignored us the rest of the time. Unless you bring a rich white guy with you, don't bother coming here."
Chris G.,"Oakland, United States",14,62,5,1.0,31/1/2007,"Walnut Creek Called,  They want their stupid chain back!   Although I will thank you for allowing me to use your restaurant as a means of profiling and eliminating possible new friends.   Anyone that chooses to eat there cant possibly have any ""Friend"" qualities. One star for using you to profile possible friends."
Anita J.,"San Francisco, United States",163,137,119,3.0,31/10/2007,Service was okay. STEAK DIANE - medium rare is magnificent DULCE DE LECHE CARAMEL CHEESECAKE  wasn't all that i thought it would be. :/ Dinner view from the balcony... priceless
Preston B.,"Queens, United States",25,100,1,1.0,30/8/2006,"I don't get it? The ONLY thing that this place has going for it is it's cheesecake... NOTHING ELSE... so the wait is wildly long, it's crazy loud, like i can't hear the person next to me, and the sevice really isn't good. I have been there a few time, usually because other people want to go and I have no choice. And EVERYTIME... it takes like 20 minutes to get bread out to the table... so this last time I was like WHERE IS THE BREAD??? cause we had already ordered out meals and the bread wasn't even out, and the waitress (who barely spoke english) was like, It's cooking. Umm... alright... maybe you should anticipate this. It came with our meal... what is the point of it now? The food is overpriced for what you get, nothing is special about the food... you will never hear a person say I LOVE THEIR FOOD... just that they love the cheesecake. Our waitress said she had 10 tables and thats why she was barely attending to us. It always seems like a bad time there."
Annie W.,"Burlingame, United States",2,29,10,3.0,17/12/2006,"food was ok, service was good, the place is special( but too cold for sitting outside)  No reservation service, we have to wait....and that's a long line to wait!!! The cheese cake is nice, but i'm not cheesey-person...."
Jeff P.,"Melville, United States",182,841,193,1.0,8/7/2007,HELL ON EARTH! Unless you want to feel like you've left SF and entered some tourist ridden Midwestern vortex avoid this hellish incarnation of this chain.
Abe F.,"San Francisco, United States",126,19,4,3.0,23/5/2008,"Great Decor, location and setting Horrible ""Wait"" experience, not only here but at other location Good Portions and always hot when served.   Has anyone ever noticed how much expense was done for interior decorating and lighting but the salt & pepper shakers along with the sugar  pack holders look like they stole it from Denny's?"
Cloclo R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,,4.0,23/2/2010,"With my friends, we tried The Cheesecake Factory on Thursday evenig at Macy's. There were about 15 of us and we didn't make a reservation. Some people were waiting to have dinner, but quickly we were seated to have dinner. Servers were nice and efficient. Dishes were huge and everybody enjoyed them. I ate an omelett ; some people ate pasta and some people ate pizza. But the best was the dessert. I ordered an original cheesecake because it's my favorite and it was delicious. Unfortunately, I wasn't hungry anymore  so I just ate two mouthfuls of my cheesecake. In conclusion I recommend this restaurant especially to taste their Cheesecake."
Seda M.,"San Francisco, United States",63,39,19,1.0,29/10/2012,"I get that it is a chain restaurant And that you shouldn't expect much but this was beyond imagination!!! Our server had no interest in being a server, we asked him A question about the menu and he snapped. Then he left and didn't come back for 15+minutes. He was extremely rude and unhappy..  To make the long story short, Needless to say our server was the worst ever!!   It took forever to receive our food and When it finally arrived it was overcooked and burnt....we were so scared of our server and his bad temper that we didn't dare to say anything... The only thing that was good was the cheesecake..but to experience this horror for the cheesecake sure wasn't worth it... I have been there before several times  and never had such horrible experience... Reading others' reviews clearly indicates that what we experienced last night seems like a common Cheesecake Factory sf experience... So stay away!!!!"
Michael G.,"San Francisco, United States",229,521,498,2.0,22/4/2005,"The number of tourists that overrun this joint makes the D-Day invasion look like a pillow fight. Desserts are best ""to go."" There are just too many other choices near by. If in Marin, the Cheese Cake Factory is a bit less crowded, with little to no wait."
Yike Q.,"Berkeley, United States",0,3,1,3.0,16/2/2013,"I went there with my mother who wants to have a try of different cheese cakes. The food there was OK, not so special as I expected. The waiter was nice. However, he did not tell us that we had ordered MORE THAN ENOUGH! As a result, we took home half of the food we ordered and spent another day to finish! Not sure will go there again."
Renae H.,"San Mateo, United States",233,336,1,2.0,30/7/2007,"Cheesecake Factory I'm just not patient enough to deal with you.   Once every year or two someone in my family says ""Ooooh, let's go to the Cheesecake Factory"" and I can't talk them out of it, so off we go.   The food is ok, some of the dishes are actually pretty good, but you can't make reservations so you wait, and wait, and wait and after that you wait some more.  When you finally get seated you repeat the process again with the waitstaff and to me an inattentive waitstaff is the kiss of death. I'm sure I'll end up here again, but it won't ever be my idea."
Rene D.,"New Orleans, United States",392,810,130,2.0,24/8/2007,"I'm not a fan of chain food. We live in an area that is written about  and praised around the world for our quest for sustainable, organic, artisanal, delicious, local food. Chain food does not fall under any of these categories.  So, this place makes a decent drink, and I was shocked that you could see and taste crab in the crab won tons. And, not crab spelled with a K. I had the Tuna Tataki Salad, which was not a ginormous pile of lettuce with three strips of tuna, but a decent amount of very tender slightly seared tuna with nicely dressed mesclun. The sliced tomatoes on the side however were far from ripe, and I was happy they were easy to ignore.  My friend had the Santa Fe Salad - an urn of salad with things non-salad eaters like:corn, black beans, chicken, avocado, sort sort of cheese, and a pile of thinly sliced onion rings. Who decided fried onions belonged on a salad? Oh, yeah - 'Weight Management Salads'? puh-leeze. The cheesecake is tres Gentile. Too,too fluffy, and why the whipped cream? Isn't there enough dairy fat on the plate as is? It's conceived by the same group that believes pudding belongs on a salad bar. Our server was nice, and followed her corporate script to the letter without seeming mechanical. I'm still baffled why people line up to eat here, but if you're with out-of-towners who are terrified of change, this is a safe bet."
