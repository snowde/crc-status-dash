Jen S.,"San Francisco, United States",6,55,,4.0,10/10/2009,"I think that the cheesecake factory is moderately priced and a great place to bring your friends and impress them on a nice day in the city. I have been here twice, once with my friends Melissa (after shopping on a holiday Monday, it was mayhem!), and once with my Boyfriend. Sitting out on the patio on a gorgeous mid week day for lunch is a fucking solid deal. I must admit, their regular menu is more than I would pay for a chain restaurant dinner, but their lunch menu is right on track! I remember being pleasantly surprised when the bill for two lunches and cheesecake came."
Bob G.,"Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, United States",291,158,102,3.0,31/10/2004,Fun restaurant at the top of Macy's with great views over Union Square. On a hot day sit outside on the terrace amid the huge M-A-C-Y-S characters.  Expect a 30min wait to be seated during tourist season.  Best to enter on Geary Street.
Ahmad R.,"Los Angeles, United States",16,54,,3.0,29/11/2006,"People..dont let the small stuff detract you from the big picture... Ok..we can all laugh at the tourists and lil kids and grammas running around the 'factory. We can talk about how mediocre the food is..even the cheesecake (as quiet as thats kept) but one simple and cool point people miss.. This is the ONLY place in union square where you can get a mojito on Saturday at 10am. All those fancy hotel bars, Closed. other local bars, Closed the Cheesecake factory is in business...serving drinks. That is AT LEAST worth 3 stars.. thanks, im out!"
Natasha S.,"Oakland, United States",436,344,73,4.0,7/2/2007,"Actually, I really really like Cheesecake Factory food.   I'm not super crazy about the long waits at this one.  And given the option of walking over to Belden where there's bound to be a shorter wait and more culinary-schmulinary food, I would be the smarter not to come here. But every so often I get that craving.  Esp. if I'm in the need for some comfort & familiarity.  SO......OUT come the familiar frou frou cocktails.  My friend had a really bad appletini here once.  But then I had a really good caipirnha here once.  Presumably depends on who is tending.  The honey vanilla latte is also yum. OUT come the big, fat, bad for you appetizers.  Give me your avocado & tex mex egg rolls, spinach & artichoke dip, nachos, ahi tuna tempura rolls, buffalo wings, crab rangoon, popcorn shrimp.  Give me your grilled cheese, shrimp blt and Kobe burger (sis swears by this last one)!  Your multi-layered fudge cake (moist and soooo good)  and of course cheesecake.  Fav flavs: white choc raspberry truffle, strawberry, plain.  And the lo-carb cheesecake.  HAHAHAHA.  Not really.   OMFG!! I almost forgot to mention the piece de resistance -- FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  I repeat, FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  As good as it sounds."
Lauren G.,"New York, United States",37,206,,3.0,27/7/2007,"I forgot I ever ate here. I can't go back because the portions make me sad.  Sad that there is anyone out there who would be capable of finishing them. Pretty good for a chain restaurant though, they do have a menu the size of a local magazine so everyone can find something.  It's a pretty decent place to bring tourists because your overlooking Union Square. Only get beer here though, the cocktails are very, very light on alcohol - I had to send a couple back to have liquor added in. There is this black bean Jamaican shrimp dish with plantains that is really good. The chicken dumplings are also a good starter."
Yeh F.,"San Francisco, United States",20,46,3,4.0,7/8/2006,"So maybe I like it because it wasn't all that long ago that I was an out-of-towner, and even a tourist.  Yeah, it's expensive, but that's to be expected from this type of restaurant.  And the wait isn't that bad as long as you actually plan for it, instead of spontaneously deciding to go eat here.  The portions are HUGE though.  One of the first times I went there with three other people, we ordered the Appetizer Favorites along with a main course for each of us.  By the time we were done sharing the Appetizers, we were already pretty full, so none of us could even finish the main course.  Because of how full we get from eating the main course, we never actually end up having any dessert, despite the name of the place."
tamara w.,"Irvine, United States",171,174,1,3.0,7/1/2007,"Most of the times when I come here, it's because my coworkers and I are at Macworld and it's a tradition to come once a year.  Yes, that's right. I'm continuing my trend of reviewing places related to Macworld.  I'm not an Apple geek I swear.  I just exhibit at the show.   I don't understand why this place is always so busy and dark.  By the end of the day, I just want to sit down and relax but not fall asleep.  The darkness in here does nothing to help me there.  The food is average.  Be warned, the potpie is huge!  The salads aren't bad.  But who really comes here for the food?  I come here for key lime cheesecake!  But because the food portions are so big, by dessert time I'm full.  So I usually order my slice of cheesecake to go.  While my friends are eating their desserts, I take one bite of mine and put the rest away for when I'm not so tired.  It tastes pretty good the next day. Service can be hit or miss.  Most of the times we've come here, the service hasn't been too bad.  But truthfully, we're so zombielike after working at the show that we probably wouldn't notice.  We're just happy to be sitting down and not talking about software."
Jenny K.,"San Francisco, United States",145,107,9,4.0,2/12/2007,The wait time at the Cheesecake Factory at Union Square is so freakin' long. It took my party at least 1 hour - 1 1/2 hours to get a table.  The wait time at the Palo Alto restaurant is much better.  All I can say is their pasta is delicious and reasonably priced. I usually can take half the pasta home for left over.. Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes are the best & the yummiest. They offer so many flavours of cheesecakes.
Renee S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,57,1,5.0,30/6/2009,So what if you have to wait the whole night for a seat???  So what if its usually so crowded you cant walk? So goddamn what!  Their cheesecake is worth it!  Their cheesecake is TO DIE FORRRRRRRRRRR.  Omg cheesecake. the most delicious cheesecake. in all kinds of flavors. with delicious cream on top. mmmmm
Melissa R.,"San Carlos, United States",211,89,4,2.0,1/12/2006,I have three words for this place: TOTALLY OVER-RATED.   Two stars because the food was edible and it had great views.
Rachel T.,"San Francisco, United States",62,312,13,4.0,30/7/2007,"I give this place 4 stars for many reasons. It's retarded how long you have to wait for a table at this place, but you kind of figure out why once you're inside. The SF location is quite good. It's a lot better than any location I've been to. It's neat because it's high up and if you get seated outside, you can see out into the street. For someone who doesn't live in the city or go to the city often, it's neat for me. Anyone who goes to the Cheesecake Factory can admit the food is pretty good and usually have a good time there. It's not a bad place to meet up with friends and eat food and get some drinks. I've gone to some other locations in California but I really like the SF location. Expect a long wait though!"
Rickey B.,"Merced, United States",3,38,5,5.0,2/12/2010,My favorite cheesecake factory of the few I have been too.. love the downtown union square view from the 8th floor.. for some reason I always end up drinking a long island while sitting on the roof.. it never let's me down.. food is always on point I order something different every time just to see if I will be satisfied and I am.. nice place for a first date but it does get crowded and cold during the night time.
Tevina T.,"San Francisco, United States",24,93,9,5.0,30/3/2008,"Ahh, it's been a while since I last came here. Maybe wow, a good few years or more. For a while I was hovering my mouse over 4 or 5 stars, and finally I've settled for five as I recall the pleasant experience I had at the Cheesecake factory. My boss decided to take me here one night (because I had never been before). I don't think we had reservations, do they even take 'em? Not sure, but anyway, we had to wait for quite a while since it was prime time for dinner, but they gave us one of those electronic light things that start spasming when your table is ready. Well, there was a ton of people, so we decided to go downstairs and frolic around in Macy's. I remember they had this mini pool table they set up for people to use (and decide if they maybe want to get a mini pool table for some reason) and my boss and I went one and one; it was intense. Ok, not really. It was pretty funny goofing around in the store which made the wait go by pretty fast.  Once we were seated, I ordered some sort of tropical fruity drink type thing because it sounded awesome at the time. When I got it, it was the nastiest drink I've ever had. Felt like I was drinking pure evil and tap water. Now, I'm not the type to complain and be like O HI THERE THIS TASTES LIKE SH*T, MIND GIVING ME SOMETHING BETTER? But thankfully, our waiter saw the look of disgust on my face and came over, very politely offered to switch my drink to something I would like. I was surprised at this, and very happy because then I went with something I actually knew. Gooood ol' soda, no extra charge. How awesome is that?  Overall, I remember the experience being pretty awesome. The atmosphere was nice, kind of loud, but that allowed us to eavesdrop easily into other people's conversations and laugh at them. I mean, uh.... Anyway, their cheesecake was awesome as well. Can't remember what I got, but it was damned good because I would love to go back again."
Vik S.,"San Jose, United States",78,230,3,2.0,9/6/2006,"As always, this place is an absolute madhouse upon your dissent from the escalator.  Does every tourist with no lack of common sense or manners come here?  I felt like a mouse in a cage and there were huge crowds of impolite people who treated people like inatimate objects as they pushed their way thru the chaos.  The food:  meh....ordered the ribeye - it was a salty, overly spiced, overly cooked ( medium rare is not supposed to be dark and chewy People !! ) mess.   the avocado eggrolls we tried were pretty good though.   the service:  ""happy"" gentleman,  a bit forgetful and inattentive... argh...I am going to have to move on, never again CAKE !!!"
Bernard M.,"Palo Alto, United States",232,124,1,2.0,27/7/2007,"Don't know why everyone in SF is writing about ""big portions"" since they seem normal to me. Of course I'm from the land of whole milk and flowing cholesterol, Chicago, so their portions are just right.   Anyway, Cheesecake Factory is standard fare. Some good dishes, some bad. Some great cheesecake and some so-so cheesecake. One thing that seems weird to observe is that this Cheesecake is very busy. Often a long wait.  This is a sign of a bad restaurant culture when one of the hottest restaurants in the heart of your downtown is Cheesecake Factory."
Annie M.,"Lyndhurst, United States",42,52,,1.0,11/1/2008,"Have been to multiple versions of these on the East Coast and this was a HUGE disappointment. Weekend brunch. The coffee came in dirty cups, our toast was forgotten, my french toast was dry and my bacon was undercooked. My husband ordered an eggs benedict dish and the eggs came out like hard boiled eggs.  Very disappointed as we usually have very good experiences at Cheesecake in NY.  Guess we will come here for desserts only from now on."
Wilson C.,"Fremont, United States",170,177,,3.0,27/3/2008,"The cheesecake here is the best you'll ever have.  I mean it better if it's called Cheesecake Factory!   The food is generally pretty good I think, although overpriced.  You pay for the ambience here.  It's located on like the 6th floor or something of Macy's and has a balcony that overlooks Union Square which is nice.   Onto the bad.  The wait.  The wait is horrendous.  You basically go in and put your name on a list.  An hour later you'll get called and you think now that wasn't so bad.  Wrong!  They only call you to give you a pager!  Now onto waiting part 2; it's part 2 because there's a part 3!  After another hour waiting with a pager you'll get paged thinking your table's ready and they can somehow read your mind and have your food waiting for you already.  But much to your dismay, when you turn in your pager you go to your third and final waiting process to wait for your table to be prepared for you.  A good 2 1/2 hours later, you'll get seated. One time we went, our waitress was pouring water and spilled it onto our table and did not even apologize.  Generally the service is good though but that's a big knock for not apologizing and even got some water on me.   Come to think of it, I might be giving them too many stars.  I'll keep at it three just because their Cheesecake is that good."
Katrina C.,"San Francisco, United States",43,52,,4.0,20/12/2006,"I like the food offered at Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake and often stop by when i'm downtown, just to pick up a slice to go. It's not the best cheesecake i've had in my life, but the variations and flavors are cool to try out.  The mango/raspberry drink is my fave and chicken-fried steak is pretty good. The other items in the menu sound pretty tasty, some are kinda random, but CF is definitely worth a visit.  Minus 1.5 stars since it is pretty pricey and the wait is pretty long, but they give you a pager, so you can shop around Macy's while you wait."
Keagan M.,"Oakland, United States",85,138,8,4.0,23/8/2007,"One good thing good about this place and all their other locations is GOOD drinks!!  I always leave this place fucked up!  The wait may be insane but youre in San Francisco, Union Square...go shop!!  Or go to the bar and most likely you can snatch a table if youre agressive enough.   Though this place is my default Ive had things on the menu that werent that great, actually complained and didnt have to pay it was that bad.  But the chicken potstickers are bomb, I'll just eat that for dinner.  Recently I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and LOVE it!  Started making it at home actually. I have to say though I was so heart broken last time I went, my favorite Cheesecake of about 7 years, the Coffee Heath Bar Crunch is no longer being sold!!  So disappointing. Anyway the decor is great, the view outside is fabulous...the wait is crazy...go if youre not too uptight about life in general, you'll have fun."
