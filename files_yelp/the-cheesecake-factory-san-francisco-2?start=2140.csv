Theresa B.,"Los Angeles, United States",114,187,25,4.0,25/2/2008,"""Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco??! Why?!?"" Yeah thats what i said when my bf suggested we have dinner here instead of the cute little wine bar next to our hotel! Booo and hiiissss i said!!  I wanted to spend our night in an intimate setting not a place where families with their loud children and teenagers all dressed up in their emo clothing hang out!  He got his way...our wait was 2 hours on a saturday night! This restaurant is located on the 8th floor of the Macys store and you have to take the elevator to the 7th and then go up the escalator in the furniture section to the 8th floor.  Food was okay, we had lettuce wraps...he had his tons of fun burger and i had my usual...the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes! it turned out to be a good night! we had drinks at the bar..had two rounds actually so by the time dinner rolled around...i was feeling pretty relaxed! Ooh...our dessert was delicious...we had the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake that was not on their menu! Yumm....ohmigosh i wanted to come back for seconds the next morning!"

Danger A.,"Kensington, United States",18,42,,1.0,14/11/2005,I've never been there - nor will I ever.  CRAPPY CHAIN RESTAURANTS NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUTTA SF. We're serious about our food here. Just leave.
Solomon C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,21,,3.0,14/3/2007,"This is a tough one. Cheesecake factory really is nothing special when it comes to food-- people go there because its on top of a building, in the middle of shopping central, over looking union square. For some reason, I always sucker myself into going during christmas-- it's easy to make a night out of it. I mean... damn... they are doing all they can-- there are bus loads of tourists lining the halls of this place, so you just got to take it in stride. Get on the list for the pager. Go shopping for an hour. Come back and get the pager. Go look at the cute cats and dogs in the windows down on street level, stroll around the tree in union square, maybe eat a roasted chestnut or two, and before you know it..."
Luis T.,"San Francisco, United States",6,23,,2.0,23/6/2008,"When  we arrived there I knew there would be a wait, but I had never heard of a bar area not letting you sit at there tables while you wait to be seated. Me and a couple of my friends we're basically told, these tables are for paying customers only. I was shocked that they even told that to us, good thing right after that we got seated. Once we were seated and placed our drink orders it only took about 20 minutes to get the drinks, and then they even forgot one of the drinks which we had to wait another 10 minutes to get.  We placed our food order and that was done in somewhat of a timely manner. But once we did get our food we just had to sit there because the staff forgot to set the table up correctly. One of the orders wasn't  done correctly and then they even had to say we're going to have to charge extra since it is a side order that you want, even though it would have came with the meal, just on the side. The food was good and that is the only reason overall the restaurant was able to attain the review that I gave it. The tuxedo chocolate cheesecake was great for dessert and I definitely recommend that to anyone that still has room for food after the generous portions of food they give you.  So overall I must say to be clear on what you order and don't wait for the waiter to check up on you, you check up on them to make sure everything goes smoothly."
arlene d.,"South San Francisco, United States",5,167,43,3.0,5/4/2010,BRING BACK TRES LECHES CHEESECAKE!!!!!! I was very sad to not see it in the cheesecake selection and was told no more..whhhaat? Excuse me? This was over a year ago but I found my new favorite Godiva chocolate cheesecake mmmm...with milk it's soo good!! Their food is not bad I like the chicken herb with the mashed potatoes. Their servings are pretty good too I always take at least half to go.
Mark J.,"Yorba Linda, United States",4,56,10,4.0,22/8/2009,"It was chilly on the patio on Thursday night, but the atmosphere was great.  Loved the Fried Macaroni and Cheese balls."
J K.,"Los Angeles, United States",199,128,,4.0,25/3/2011,i Love the outdoor dining looking over the union square at night!  food is delicious i think it's the best cheesecake factory..better than the one in san jose. the service was nice.  carbonara pasta and pork chop was great and strawberry lemonade! mostly strawberry cheesecake! but the downside is that i went during the christmas break and i had to wait almost two hours to get seated and there were pack of people seriously. i think it's usually packed with people.
Alice L.,"SoMa, San Francisco, United States",1,1,,2.0,28/12/2012,"I had high expectation for the Cheesecake Factory because i haven't been to one for a long time. I went with my dad yesterday at 5 and got a table for two pretty quickly, which was nice. We ordered an appetizer (raw tuna wrapped into tempura), a salad, and a seafood main course. I was going to order an appetizer salad since we had lunch at 2, but the server told us the salad wouldn't be enough so we decided to go for a full size. Turned out the salad was like the size of a main course, which was way too much than what i wanted. I mentioned to the server that it was not what he describe to be ""enough"", but we decided to keep it anyway. After we finished the appetizer and most of the salad (still a little bit leftover), I asked the server to wrap up the rest and bring us the main course. He just gave us the cheque and cancelled our main course!!! The service was so bad!!!! (although the food was ok)."
Kathy K.,"Sacramento, United States",122,348,48,4.0,13/2/2007,"Never without fail, CF is ALWAYS packed. So for those who are surprised and annoyed, ummm well folks I hate to break it to you but..... 1) It's Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately for those of us who live in the fabulous SF and want for god knows what reason a piece of cheesecake and orange chicken, it is a chain, and out -of -towners who don't know better eat there because it is something they recognize away from home 2) It sits atop a Macys in the middle of Union Square. DON'T make me explain this one. 3) It's a large restaurant with lots of people and if you go to eat during peak eating hours, you will have to wait due to reasons 1 and 2 stated above. Now that I am done with my lecture, I have to agree that the wait is ridiculous at CF, but my solutions are to either go eat at an off time during the week or go to the bar.......weekends are always a nightmare so avoid at all costs if possible. Expect the wait and go a little early to get your vibrating tag and sit and enjoy the view or walk and get a drink at the bar and laugh at all of the frustrated looks on those waiting like you. If you practice enjoyment and patience I swear you'll get a table faster. If all else is lost, then sneak in near the bar, scope out the scene and see if anyone is leaving. Bar area is first come first served, so if you see people leaving a table, gently come up and say ""hi"" and ask if you can have their table when they are done. Be polite, but not too needy or aggressive. It is annoying and I have purposefully avoided giving people like that my table, prefering to defer to the nice people who don't hover like vultures as I am trying to eat my banana cream cheesecake in peace. If they are nice, it will be a smooth transition from their leaving to you sitting and avoiding the 90 minute wait for a table. The cheesecake is yummy and with so many varieties you cant go wrong with your choices. The portions are ginormous and easy enough to share with your friends or take home and enjoy the next day. I personally loved the seared ahi tuna salad and orange chicken. And their cheesy artichoke dip can't be beat."
Cristina T.,"Daly City, United States",34,9,,5.0,6/2/2011,"I love their pasta, drinks and desserts and the al fresco dining is wonderful!"
Chris B.,"South San Francisco, United States",35,89,39,2.0,20/7/2010,"FANCY without  the taste!  I like this place a lot it looks really nice and all, has a good vibe and even the food looks pretty tasty but then you bite into it and its just ehh.  I ordered the Bistro Shrimp and I wasn't impressed at all.  The shrimp was flavored really poorly and tasted really fishy.  This place is all hyped up and has a ton of people but its just not that good.  I dont know why but I have never got anything that good here, It kinda reminds me of Macaroni Grill but not as good.  The Service was amazing lady was on point and there in a second everytime I needed something which was nice."
Jamie W.,"San Francisco, United States",97,241,60,4.0,17/2/2008,"Big menu, big portions, free refills ... and I hear they serve cheesecake too. Ed U. warned me that the portions are on the humongous side, so I opted for a salad to share and negotiated a few pieces of Ed's meatloaf and potatoes.  The Chicken Tostada salad was pretty tasty ... I'd like to see more chicken in it for $12.95, but it was more than filling. On Ed's plate, I LOVED the garlic mash potatoes .. they were wonderful.  Smooth, creamy, yum-o! I can't imagine waiting more than 30-45 minutes for a table at the Cheesecake Factory ... but I guess some people do.  It was nice to try it out ... I'd recommend giving it a go at least once."
Denise M.,"South San Francisco, United States",202,1022,8,4.0,3/2/2008,"Good and bad with this place.  Mostly good though.  The food in general is yummy, but not consistent.  The bad - the waiting.  Oh good God, the waiting!  Even with a reservation, it's loud and crowded and just annoying.  People get pushy and they really don't care that they're standing at the mouth of the escalator, so you have no where to go.  You get the paging disk, and even after that thing buzzes, you have to wait for someone to call your name to seat you.  So you'd better be listening.   My absolute must have here is the Fried Macaroni and Cheese.  I'm a big mac and cheese fan - what better way than to fry it up and serve over creamy marinara sauce?  Thai lettuce wraps, sweet corn tamale cakes, crispy crab won tons, their clam chowder - all good.  For entrees, go for the chicken and biscuits, the crusted Romano chicken, the herb crusted salmon, or the bang-bang chicken and shrimp.  All delicious!   The restaurant serves up HUGE portions, so be prepared to doggie-bag half your dish. Desserts - need I really say?  Cheesecake all the way baby!  I'm very simple.  Strawberry cheesecake does it for me.  Big slice of their plain cheesecake with large glazed strawberries.  Two giant dollops of fresh whipped cream.  It's smooth, creamy, and oh so yummy.  If you do an appetizer and then go straight for dessert - then you're smart. Another good thing here is that if you have a Macy's Visa, you can charge it and get Macy's shopper points."
JUDY L.,"San Francisco, United States",66,252,73,4.0,30/5/2009,"my first experience was yearrrrrrrrrrs ago when i had just broke up with my bf (which also happened right before my bday) ... so my cousin took me and my friends.. ordered a whole 6inch fresh strawberry cheesecake and we ate it at union square.. =] .. i still love that cheesecake!! the other day i had the chance to finally dine here.. however, we only got the nachos.. but those nachos were pretty damn good.. also ordered a peach bellini which was awesome too! love the heated outdoor patio!"
Radha X.,"Oakland, United States",9,151,4,3.0,4/6/2008,"Always satisfied with the food, portion, drinks and usually service. Bad thing is the wait. Since they don't take reservations, you have to wait 45min + around peek time especially if you are a party of 4 or more. Very loud so don't expect a romantic dinner for 2.  USUALLy, the waiters/waitresses are really cheery and good at service. HOWEVER, if you get a scrawny asian guy named Kai, ur in for a frustrating night. We got him as a replacement while our waitress went on break. He never came back. We asked like 3 other waiters to find him and when he finally showed up, he greeted with a ""Sup?"" By the time, we got our condiments etc our food was cold.....Got home and told my sis about the guy and she had the same experience with him before! The guy was informal, unresponsive and just disappeared..... But in all, I always like going here if I'm in downtown or have time to wait."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, United States",213,642,274,2.0,24/3/2006,"I really can't rate a place very highly when you have to wait for your name to be called.  You think you are set and ready to be seated, right??  No way .... you have to wait again by the post for them to seat you.  Wait times are easily 1 hour.  Nice patio, though.  I do like the bruscetta appetizer though, and the Lousiana Chicken Pasta.  Portions feed Paul Bunyan.  I cannot comment on the cheesecake because I really don't like it.  My ex really loved this place, and ""we"" took her whole family one night, and she stiffed me for the entire bill for 15 people.  I don't mind paying for half, considering it was HER family, but the whole thing??"
David D.,"San Francisco, United States",2860,1088,519,4.0,19/5/2006,"Yes, I know, it's a chain store.  But the menu is huge, and the food is good.  Typically you have to wait an hour to get a table, because every high school student and young professional wants to eat dinner here.  The pagers work all over the top floor at Macy's though -- the store is above Macy's and has an outdoor balcony overlooking Union Square.  I like the Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  There's something for everyone on the menu, think TGIFridays x10.  Even with the wait I've never been disappointed.   Sometimes while we're waiting around a table in the bar will open up.  Full menu service.  A couple of times a table at the bar was even empty!   The decor is a little bizarre, like some Disneyland Egyptian tomb, but it's fun to look at.  And yes, once or twice I've also had the cheesecake.  Unlike most other people I was not impressed by it."
Meatball J.,"San Francisco, United States",63,44,,4.0,25/4/2008,"How many times have I tried to get in this place for lunch (and, back to work on time)? yeah, a million. not gonna happen! SO BUSY!  sooo, finally after all these years I decide to have lunch there on a weekend. (when I am not in a hurry). And I was impressed. The service was friendly, and fast. I feel sorry for the servers who have to wear all white though. Everyone can see when you spill some sauce on yourself! well... we hope that it's sauce. It was a beautiful day on the patio. awesome view of Union Square! And... the food is pretty terrific yet it is in MONSTER portions. so i suggest sharing your lunch with someone special ; )wink"
jason c.,"San Francisco, United States",0,25,,3.0,14/12/2010,"Wait is long, Food is average, Price is high.. I give it a 3 star for the great service"
