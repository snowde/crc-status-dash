ibby m.,"San Francisco, United States",0,47,4,2.0,6/7/2012,"I don't like chain restaurants and only came here for dinner last night because we had a gift card. The long wait was expected. Once we sat down, a very professional server approached us and took our drink orders. She stated that our waiter is on break and that he will follow up with us shortly. Since we reviewed the menu while waiting, she also took our order. I ordered a mojito and she suggested a glass of water while waiting for my cocktail. That told me that the bar was backed up. I appreciated her suggestion. However, after 10 minutes, no water. She walked by our table a few minutes later and I asked her for the water. She said our regular server would be along with that. 15 minutes in and the water shows up with the cocktail. It's just water. I don't think anyone should wait that long for something so simple. We ordered two mushroom/onion/cheese burgers with side salads. I ordered medium ad hubs ordered med rare. Mine was ok, his was not med rare at all. Barely any pink. The mushroom and onions were so skimpy and there was only once slice of cheese when the menu said two slices. I mentioned the skimpy toppings to our server and he didn't offer to get more. He simply said that's the way it is. For a 1/4 lb  burger that was smaller than the bun with 6 pieces of mushrooms and 3 pieces of onion, I was shocked at the $11 price. I noticed the lady next to me also complain about her food. There was a missing ingredient as well. Oh I forgot, the mushrooms were Luke warm and the cheese was a bit cold. The other reason I'm giving a low rating is because our regular server barely communicated. No thank yous, no acknowledgments, nothing.  At the end, he only asked if we wanted dessert. Hell no. Not going to help your up selling when you can't help make your customers happy. We tipped 10% to reflect the minimal and skimpy service. Next time I will give my gift card away."
Mori Y.,"Berkeley, United States",157,134,22,2.0,20/4/2006,"The line is pretty hellish getting into this rooftop eatery overlooking Union Square.  I'm not sure if the pager they give you when you sign in is corteous, or a nice way of saying 'f*ck off and go waste your money downstairs for a while!'  It's like any other Cheesecake Factory in America; huge portions, so-so food, decent drinks, and sub-standard over-marketed cheesecake.  HOWEVER, what makes this CF different is that you are being waited on by the finest actors and actresses that San Francisco has to offer.   Cheers!"
Dani N.,"San Jose, United States",34,88,4,4.0,20/7/2006,"After having worked in the restaurant business for 3 years now I am always quite weary of incorporated restaurants.  I prefer the more mom and pop or fusion minus the franchise. But then again, there are those times that a BJ's, Chili's or Cheesecake has it's place.  We spent a long Sunday afternoon shopping all over Union Square looking for the perfect rehearsal dinner dress for my sister and boy was she picky.  Final we found one in the special occasions spot in Macy's.  We wanted to grab some dinner and since this restaurant was right there.  We put our name in, only had to wait 45 minutes (wow quick! ha) and went back to shopping... The perfect dress needed matching shoes of course. Our server ( I believe his name was chris) was really great.  Charming yet not overbearing which is how most servers are trained.  He dealt eloquently with my quirky family and served us quite well.  Dinner was great, I always like to try new things but if in doubt the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is really good.  Dessert is consistent but my cappuccino was definitely lacking.  It was more of a latte but I am weird.   OVERALL... It was really Chris who made the night great and the fact that it was a beautiful day and we enjoyed dinner outside, my favorite."
Jess S.,"San Francisco, United States",93,121,6,3.0,21/9/2006,"I hate the Cheescakecake Factory for many reasons.  Now, you might be asking yourself, why does she review it...especially with 3 stars?  Well, let me tell you a story.  I've been three time: once with the parental units, once on the WORST date I've had in ages and once last night with some friends.   Okay, the first time...   - Food is okay, too rich and too much I felt, but who am I to complain?  The waiter was obnoxious with a capital O.  I see him every time I go there and I swear he recognizes me every time, possibly because I am pretty sure that to keep his job he can't act the way he did towards me to many people. Second time:   - Food is gross, company sucks and I end up paying. Third time:   - Bartender is rude, then I am feisty back and end up not being charged for anything (I left a great tip for it)  This is the reason for the three stars. Bottom line: If you don't eat cheesecake, it's just overpriced and loud."
foodi e.,"San Francisco, United States",8,74,,4.0,6/10/2008,"Over the years, we've collected (not literally) a lot of receipts from here. We usually come for dinner but the hubby & I have had a few lunch dates. Food is solid. Their portions are huge yet still affordable.  Service is generally ok, depending on the server. But the wait-another story. Bring something to do. Unless you enjoy staring @ the ceiling, because after a while, you run out of things to look at. haha.  Our regulars: ~ calamari ~ firecracker salmon rolls ~ ""chicken pot pie"" soup  ~ kobe burger ~ 4 cheese pasta w/ spaghettini ~ shrimp scampi-my style-with mashed potatoes instead of noodles & a side of garlic dip & firecracker sauce... oooh yeah.. ~ & of course, a lemonade, ice tea (love the smell!) & coke we've basically tried most of the items on the menu.. they're all pretty good.. we had dinner here last night & tried their fried mac n cheese for the first time & it was soooo goood. it's a meal in itself.. the hubby was in food heaven..   =D setbacks: ~ dining area by the restroom is not as well ventilated as the opposite side.. it gets really stuffy & uncomfortable.. ~ floors are super slippery at times ~ there's an a-hole of a manager in SF..  ~ chairs are uncomfortable ~ the hubby doesn't enjoy dim lighting.. i, on the other hand, enjoy it.. ~ don't take reservations & long waits on most days ~ not enough seats for people waiting.. they could put some on either side of the escalator.. ~ SF- rude tourists could get really annoying ~ pigeons out in the patio are gross! (it's not their fault, i know! but still gross!) ~ if you come late saturday, they tend to run out of my favorite soup ~ NO KIDS MEALS!!! & they can't even do half portions.. pshhh..  ~ & most recently, they closed off one of the doors going out into the balcony..  other locations we've been to: ~ Palo Alto ~ Valley Fair, SJ ~ Oakridge, SJ ~ Marin SF is still my fave b/c of the view & accessibility to shops.. despite all ther setbacks, for the most part, we still enjoy eating here.. i mean.. what do you really expect from a chain? i have nothing against it, i'm just saying.. if it weren't for the food this rating should only be a 3..."
Yanira N.,"McLean, United States",0,3,,4.0,7/12/2010,Love this place. Specially the creolle style food - spicy and great - shrimp and beans!  Portions are huge. The cheesecakes themselves are also very good ;-).
Nicole I.,"Oakland, United States",141,260,6,3.0,26/2/2006,"Definately not worth the long wait (maybe 30minutes or more depending on the day/night).  The portions are huge enough for a table to split.  The food was pretty bland, but our waiter was good.  We never had to wait long for anything and he was always helpful.     But, the cheesecake was so delicious!  Don't go for the food just the cheesecake.  The lines are a little shorter and then you can go someplace else to eat."
Melanie D.,"Mountain View, United States",41,203,1,2.0,16/4/2006,"I came here with my dinner companion last night because he had a generous gift card.  Otherwise, dinner would have been completely outrageous.  $75 for two drinks, two entrees and two desserts seems like a lot when you didn't even really like your entree and your nose was too stuffy to enjoy your dessert completely.  I tried their Jamaican shrimp and, unlike other places where I have had it, the sauce was thick like glue rather than light and flavorful.  The mango salsa was a lot on the skimpy side but at least the shrimp was cooked properly - not too tough, just tender.  Drinks were delicious but we didn't realize until later they were $8/each.  Seriously?  They were a bit small for that price.  We had cheesecake for dessert and while they were rich and creamy and good, my stuffy nose prevented me from enjoying it to the fullest, which was a tad disappointing.  I think the nicest part was the view we had from the outdoor seating of the little square in front of Macy's.  The lights twinkled from the buildings.  It wasn't as loud outside as in the restaurant (thank goodness) so even though it was a tad cold, I enjoyed it a lot more.  Overall, overpriced and disappointing entrees but a very nice view and solid desserts earn it 2 stars."
Lise L.,"El Cerrito, United States",186,320,5,2.0,5/10/2006,"The food is filling and not total swill, but I usually dont find it all that exciting either. There is lots of it, but I prefer quality to quantity any day. Generally not worth the price or the wait, definitely not worth both.  I give it two stars for the bar - I love some of the desserty drinks and they are so fun and filling they make the wait bearable."
Josh B.,"San Francisco, United States",51,60,,1.0,14/10/2006,"I hate this place for one reason. The menu. 2 problems: 1) Why the hell is it necessary to have 47 pages of items. What kind of restaurant is this? Pick a goddamn specialty and focus on that.  2) Advertisements in menus? I mean honestly, we're bombarded all day long with ads - when I go out to eat and enjoy a nice dinner, the last thing I want to see are new ads for CK underwear. Eb-dee eb-dee eb-dee ebdee, that's all folks."
Elaine W.,"San Francisco, United States",142,324,139,3.0,8/1/2012,"In the handful of times I've gone here with coworkers, friends, family...our experiences are always 50/50. The cheesecakes alone deserve 5 stars (my fave is the red velvet), service is a 3 on a good day, and the rest of the menu can range from 1 to 4. On our last visit, we went for Sunday brunch round 11am. Got two salmon platters, a coffee, and a mint sweet tea. The salmon platter was very well presented...smoked salmon slices, greens, tomatoes & onion, a scoop of cream cheese and a bagel. Everything was good except for the bagel which was not toasted and was rock hard/stale. We ended up asked for a basket of their complimentary sourdough and oat bread instead. The coffee was extremely watered down...evidenced in the glass cup it was served in - it looked more like tea than coffee. The mint tea was refreshing...I'm thinking of opting out of the sweetener next time cause it was too syrupy. Free refills were offered on both drinks...I thought it funny that the coffee was the same price as the mint tea $3.25...that's more like the price of a latte! On future visits I will skip the coffees and simple beverages and go for the mimosas and other cocktails. Also, if you dine here during the day, unless it's windy out, definitely opt for outside seating where you can get a great view of Union Square."
juls j.,"San Francisco, United States",0,181,3,1.0,1/3/2008,"I've been dragged here twice- once before I knew better and the second because it was a special request.  Well never again. I'd rather lick a sewer grate than experience this place again. As you can probably tell I don't get the hype.  The food isn't anything to write home about and usually too sweet even the pasta dishes.  In SF, food abounds and there's a plethora of fabulous options.  There's no reason to go here."
Bernard L.,"San Jose, United States",567,178,27,3.0,9/8/2010,"I love the food at Cheesecake Factory from the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. They have something for everybody. This location is insanely crowded due to the tourists in San Francisco so we had to wait for about an hour to get seated, which isn't too bad considering the amount of customers that come in. The view from the balcony is pretty awesome in its own right, although I wouldn't choose to sit there on a windy day. Also, there's something about the layout and decor of this restaurant that seems a little more upscale than the other Cheesecake Factory locations that I've been to."
Sabrina L.,"Los Angeles, United States",202,808,421,4.0,1/3/2007,"I don't hate Cheesecake.....I don't love it...but every time I go, I'm usually happy with the food! (And love the brown bread!) In college, someone used to go and buy cheesecake slices for us to all split and bring it back to the dorms. (Ahh...those were the days!) But I do enjoy their cheesecakes. What brought us to this location wasn't the food, however. It was the rain. Pure convenience...it was closest to where we were parked & it was *pouring*. So this was a quick place to duck in and grab a bite to eat. Surprisingly, the wait wasn't long at all! (tho this was for lunch and not dinner...) I can only imagine that it would be a wonderful place to dine on the patio on a sunny day! We did have a still picturesque view of rainy union square. I give 4 stars instead of 3 because the waitress/cooks let me make my own lunch: Grilled cheese with 4 different kinds of cheese + tomato on a deliciously toasty yet still-soft-in-the-middle egg bread. (The fries went cold really fast tho. : ( That was rather disappointing). I'll post a picture of my yummy grilled cheese sammy...  : )"
Rei E.,"San Francisco, United States",63,66,25,3.0,4/4/2007,"Definitely overrated for the wait, crowd, food, and prices.  However, the decor is really nice and the menu is vast if you need to feed a picky eater.  It's been a while since I've been there, so I actually don't remember what I've ordered.   I know I had some kind of jambalaya that was not very good.  There was something else with mashed potatoes, and I remember the potatoes being yummy...  The first time I went there with three people and we each ordered our own plate plus an appetizer  and a cocktail.  We asked the server if he thought that was too much food and he said no!!! But it was way too much food and the bill was scary... Now, it's more of a place I'll go for coffee and dessert.  Maybe a few appetizers.  But if the wait is too long, I don't stick around.  Dining in this city is too good for that."
Michelle N.,"Cardiff, United States",57,108,6,3.0,28/6/2007,"I first discovered the Cheesecake factory when I was in college in Boulder.  During the summers, I loved to sit outside on Pearl Street under the trees while I feasted on the more than generous portions of food.  I ate there often because one meal actually is equivalent to three for a girl my size.  And as a college student, I appreciated the leftovers after a night of partying or a day of studying.   Today as I was sitting outside of the Cheesecake factory looking down on union square drinking my cosmopolitan, it felt like summer in the city.  I love summer days and in San Francisco those days do not grace us as often as I would like, so I was pleased to be eating outside and soaking up some rays during lunch.  The food was tasty and plentiful as always, but the service was mediocre, which I guess is expected at most chain restaurants.   I will return to this Cheesecake Factory but only on another beautifully sunny summer day, when i don't mind waiting to sit down, waiting to get a drink, waiting for my food, and of course waiting to pay the bill."
Jorge D.,"San Jose, United States",320,108,18,4.0,27/8/2007,OK ok besides the long wait ALWAYS! I think its really worth the wait! A big selection of food and Chicken! plus BAR! If I had to vote on the RANCH DRESSING alone i'd give the CCF 5 stars! If your a ranch lover then this is the BEST ranch I've ever tasted!! YUMMY! Sometimes I totally decided my meal around the ranch! and one time even tried to steal it. If you don't like LONG waits and lots of people then this place is not for you...you can always grab your buzzer thing and go take a nap in the Macys furniture part :)
Lily X.,"San Francisco, United States",0,88,2,4.0,27/7/2008,"Ok sooo... BFF day was today and we had trouble choosing a restaurant... we picked restaurants out of a hat and Cheesecake Factory it was!.... We got there and it was an extremely long wait...  But we did get our seats within 30 minutes... So waiting on the side for a waitress to lead us in..., one of them steps on my feet by accident really hard and says nothing! I mean can i at least get an apology? so we get to our table and then the waitress was really nice... Sure, sometimes it was hard to get her help, buttttt, she always came to make sure everything was going smooth and she knew what we wanted without us having to ask for it.   The spicy cajun pasta was alright... not as spicy as i had hoped for, but it was alright..  The oreo cheesecake was pretty good.. very sweet.. but good....  and the frozen ice mango drink was really good.... :] Other than the wait and the foot stepping, this experience was pretty good. if you have time and you want some not bad food, go to cheesecake factory. -x3 shells"
Grace R.,"Cerritos, United States",45,62,,4.0,14/2/2010,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. If I don't know where to go for dinner, I always say ""Let's go to the Cheescake Factory"". I was a fan ever since college. Here's what I always order: Start with avocado egg rolls followed by some pasta dish (varies) and top off my meal with the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Yum! I wish I can eat this everyday, too bad it's always crowded and at least 1-2 hour wait depending on the time and day. That's why I give it 4 stars out of 5. I hate waiting for so long, but the food is always worth it. I guess that's why I'm always coming back."
