Meg L.,"San Francisco, United States",60,156,2,4.0,21/5/2006,"ok so I know this place is getting a lot of slack but I actually like it. Yes it is a chain, yes the wait is long, but the number of food options are beyond compare and the food itself is quite good, for the price you at least get a huge portion, which I understand is ""whats wrong with America"" but you don't HAVE to eat the whole thing, thats what doggy bags are for people. If you don't go at peak times the wait isn't bad at all and I have always received excellent service. I recommend it for groups as there are so many options and it is a fun place. Although it does attract tourists and would more likely fit in at pier 39 I don't mind it on top of Macy's, at least you get the view.  Oh and their cheesecake is delicious, get it to go after the meal though, otherwise you will be too tempted to eat it all at once."
Scott K.,"Manhattan Beach, United States",22,144,31,5.0,26/6/2006,"i love it here! True Story: my friends parents were visiting from sweden and didn't know that the cheesecake factory had HUGE portions. they each ordered ad app, salad, meal desert.. ha, can you imagine. they thought that americans ate WAY TOO MUCH food. we do, but it's still funny..."
Lorraine D.,"San Francisco, United States",123,163,,1.0,17/8/2006,"I used to have cravings for this food that defied the unacceptably long wait.  And then St. Patrick's Day happened and I haven't been in since.  What happened on that day was we were there on a slow night - we were only one of probably 4 groups of people, which means we should have been seated quickly, as the ladies at the front desk told us.  But instead we waited and waited.  And waited.  When they say ""fifteen minutes"" it actually means an hour.  And ""half an hour"" means two hours.    When they finally sat us, I found that there were whole sections that were closed when they could have sat us down and served us hours ago and let us be on our merry way.    The food - while it spans across the board into several different categories - is still average, at best ,and definitely not worth the long wait it takes to get the food.  Other things I won't miss - the slippery floors that feel like it was washed in grease (every time!).  The snotty people at the front desk who look like they can't be bothered.  The weird guys who cruise the bar (there's always at least one).  Or the people who consider this ""fine dining.""  Move on, people.  Find a new restaurant to eat at.  Get your lives back.  Discover real food."
Bernie L.,"Portland, United States",32,247,,2.0,2/3/2007,"I don't really ""get"" the whole cheesecake factory concept. Why is it called the cheesecake factory when i hardly ever see people actually order cheesecake? or a better question would be why does everyone and their mamas like this place so much? Having never actually had a full meal there, i'm only able to extrapolate certain things, but it's enough for me not to really want to grab dinner there... EVER. First, the things it's got going for it: a nice view; convenient location; a bar that serves a pleasantly strong manhattan; and some good, but not particularly inventive appetizers (e.g., fried macaroni and cheese balls). The things that kind of annoy me: the wait!! who the hell are all these people? shouldn't they be in walnut creek or something?; the associated striving for suburbanite acceptability - i.e., it has the facade of trendiness, unless you've actually been to a trendy restaurant; and overpriced menu for that type and quality of food. I suppose it's mainly the demographics of the restaurant that irk me. I know, I know... i'm a typical bay area snob. i can't help it... i've been trained well. but i really have to wonder why people want to come here. The wait is long, the food is average, and it's expensive. So what if you just went shopping in union square or just saw a show at the orpheum? there are SOOO many other culinary options to be had!!! for shorter waits and possibly smaller bills. You're in freakin' SF... ACT LIKE IT!!"
Kat J.,"Washington Crossing, United States",64,270,139,2.0,29/4/2007,"Love Cheesecake Factory but this location sucked.  The view is awesome, especially yesterday when it was sunny and the square was full of people lounging about and listening to the live music. So while we stood around waiting for our table (45 minutes at 4:30pm), we had a good time. Many people around us got drinks at the bar and brought them outside and we all stood in between the letters of the Macy's sign. But once you sit down to eat, you can't really see anything anymore - just the tops of buildings and the wind picks up and you're cold. The service was pretty bad as you could tell the waitstaff is losing their minds with the millions of people ordering things. We had to wait 10 minutes for our bread and drink order as they ran out of bread and the bar staff was backed up. Then, I ordered a salad with the dressing on the side and it arrived sans the dressing. I had to wait about 10 minutes before the dressing made it to my table. However, I love Cheesecake Food as their menu has fantastic variety and the drinks are very taste...expensive, but full of alcohol so you're not getting ripped off. So I'll go back to Cheesecake, just not this one."
patrick o.,"San Francisco, United States",94,199,1,4.0,6/6/2007,"I truly can't give this place anything less than 4 stars.  All of the memories, I've had with this place.   THIS IS A GREAT FIRST DATE SPOT.  The food is super consistent.  Nothing ruins a first date, than $hitty food.  The service is hyper-hyphy most of the time I have been here.   The wait is usually long enough that you can't help but talk to your date.  Nothing like those uneasy first date feelings, standing out on the balcony staring at Tiffany's with that girl, whom gives you those puppy dog eyes on your first date.   BIG BIG MINUS STAR for the ridiculous wait time.  I always say that they should just close down the floor under Cheesecake factory and make another Cheesecake Factory."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, United States",296,525,4,4.0,26/6/2007,"Wait maybe THIS is my favorite C.F. location!  Why you ask?  Well because it's in Macy's and there's outdoor seating.  On a nice day you can sit outside, about 5 stories high and gobble some good eats all while taking in a view of Tiffanys (among other things). P.S.  The wait here is RIDIC-ulous!  I'm always scared to ask because it's never under 1 hour!  Although when I came here with my friend who is a manger at the Four Seasons in Maui, all she had to do was show her card, and POOF we were whisked away to a table without so much as putting our names down...oh baby that's what I LIKE!"
Cynthia B.,"Hercules, United States",912,1062,87,2.0,14/7/2007,"I have never been to this location but two times one of the employees brought me cheesecake from there.  I love cheesecake.  The first time the cheesecake was HEAVY, not rich enough, too sweet and like something you might get in the frozen section at any supermarket.  Probably because that's not too far from the truth.   The second time I was brought a slice I accepted it because I was hungry and broke.  It wasn't even fun to eat, more of a chore.  It definitely wasn't worth the calories. It's not horrible cheesecake, but after eating other cheesecakes in Berkeley in past years and of course at Zanze's it made the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake look pretty bad.  What a let-down.  Now I don't have a good impression of the Cheesecake Factory, my guess is they are more interested in giving you calories than you giving you great taste and quality."
Amy O.,"San Francisco, United States",51,79,,2.0,5/8/2007,"Cheesecake Factory has the longest f'ing wait times during the dinner and weekend rushes. The food is pretty good, the portions are double the normal, and the price matches. My biggest complaint is the bakery. I've gone twice to get a cheesecake to go, a whole six-incher. You'd think I would be out of the restaurant with my cake in ten, fifteen minutes. Oh no. No, no, no. Due to the guy behind the counter (Luis), his minimal grasp of English, and the cheesecake-packing ladies behind him, I've waited thirty to forty minutes for a cake requiring only packing and bagging.  Every time, it's like they forgot about my f'ing order. When I go up to Luis again with my receipt after fifteen minutes and politely inquire how much longer it will be, he takes the receipt and looks at it in surprise, goes to one of the other ladies who looks at it like she's never seen the order, and disappears off to who knows where. He will then come back and hand me my receipt and tell me it's coming. I usually wait another ten minutes before watching him drop the boxed cake in a bag and shake the box in the bag to get it balanced. IT'S A F'ING CHEESECAKE, DON'T SHAKE IT AROUND. I'm beginning to think as good as the cheesecakes are, it's not worth the shit I have to go through with Luis and co. I haaaate the bakery staff. They make me so angry, I curse whenever I speak of them. Getting me my cake should only take five minutes! Time management, people, TIME MANAGEMENT."
Erin M.,"Woodinville, United States",117,501,87,4.0,23/8/2007,"As far as food goes, you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. I figure that's true for most chain restaurants like this. I remember the first time I opened a Cheesecake Factory menu... novel is a more appropriate description.  Anyway... most of us know about cheesecake factory food- relatively inexpensive, well-rounded, decent but not stunning food. Personally, I'm not into the food. But, this Cheesecake factory wins because of the awesome view. Most dining establishments with this kind of view of SF will charge three times as much per plate. Conversely, you can come to this location and buy a single slice of cheesecake, and it's alright to just enjoy the view. I esp recommend a meal here for tourists interested in Union Square (who isn't?!?) I love it."
Mark W.,"San Francisco, United States",131,518,8,3.0,2/1/2008,"This place seems like it is always bustling.  Maybe the American version of a Chinese ""Teahouse""?  This last time we went, we got the pager liked we normally would but they said that we could not go around with it to anywhere inside Macy's.  They said that we would have to wait in the Cheesecake Factory Waiting area.  I thought that was kinda weird because in the past, we were at least able to walk down the escalators where the furniture was but this time they said that it would not work down there.   In any case, that kinda sucks cause the wait was about 1.25 hours.  But we ended up just asking them how long the wait was going to be and we just decided to take a walk in Union Square for an hour or so and head back upstairs and as soon as we did, the elevator door opened up and the pager buzzed!  Perfect Timing!   So the thing you need to know about this place is the long wait, the large portions, the fair price for large portions and the decent food.  I guess it's still a chain restaurant but it's not too bad.  I guess every couple of years, it's a cool spot to go during the Holiday Season when we are down here.   Or....... Maybe it's better to come here when it's NOT the Holiday Season??  I'm thinking it's not as crowded...  Then again, I could be wrong...."
BL T.,"San Francisco, United States",18,13,,4.0,14/1/2009,"Well here goes nothing. It's my first attempt at doing this. I have been reading alot of the reviews by other people and I feel like I'm a little bit out of my league here. Anywho, I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Everything I have ever eaten here has been terriffic, stupendous and yes, even yummy. Guess I could also add tasty. Service depends on what day and time of day you are there. All in all, service is ok. I'd give it 5 stars but they did away with my favorite item. The onion appitizer. It was so good. I used to go there just for that and a beer. Made my day. They still have some dishes where they put those yummmy onions on them but not to many. If your going there on a Sunday morning I'd like to suggest you get there about 10:30 to beat the crowd."
Manuel M.,"San Francisco, United States",49,33,1,3.0,12/2/2008,"Pretty Average.  The only thing that makes this Cheesecake stand out is that you get a view with the meal, but that is only if you wait long enough to sit on the deck.  It's still a Cheesecake, you can get this service in suburbs all across America. It's a large American meal with lots of food for a semi-decent price. I only like taking people here as a joke and if I want them to feel comfortable and not too shocked by coming from a small town to a big city.  The wait is unbelievable. I tried to go there on a Saturday night and they told me it would be about an hour wait for dinner! I am not about to wait an hour for something I can make at home for half the price.  If you are looking for a nice meal in the area then walk a few more blocks and find a restaurant that isn't geared towards tourist.  If you are looking for a view, then just to in the Saint Francis elevators. You can get a whole view of the bay for free."
JERRY B.,"Daly City, United States",0,87,,2.0,6/6/2012,"Last Sunday, I placed a to go order for an  item hours in advance, as I know this location is constantly busy.  Instead of getting a glamerburger cooked medium well, with cheddar. I got a burger, that was beyond charcolaed, and without cheese. I'm sorry but if i'm going to pay cheesecake facotprices,I would expect them to know how to cook a burger. This is nothing new, as quality clearly, is not what you always get at the CK Factory. Perhaps, Mcdonalds, or Jack in the box, could do a better job, at half the price"
Bibby L.,"Alameda, United States",44,150,,4.0,22/3/2010,"Amazing seafood and martinis. Huge servings of delicious cheesecake, of course. Service was a little slow, but they were absolutely swamped, so that makes sense. It's nice that it's above Macy's so you can look around while you wait for your table if there's a long wait."
Kimberly B.,"San Jose, United States",104,428,25,3.0,7/2/2008,"I don't understand why this place is always so crowded, no matter what time you go in. We always have to wait the longest time to eat here, even if it's a party of two. I've had some good dishes here, like the miso salmon and their different variety of salads, but it seems like the prices are also steadily increasing for all their meals.  I would have to say that their cheesecake here is worth trying though, especially if you're a big chocolate fan because they incorporate a lot of different chocolate bars into their cheesecakes. I find it humorous that they have Splenda cheesecake and things like that. I mean come on, it's cheesecake. It's 450% of your daily intake of saturated fat. ;)"
Lovi K.,"San Francisco, United States",0,45,,5.0,1/7/2010,"Tiramisu cheescake are the first words in my mind! You have to try it tiramisu+cheesecake= awesome. I've ate here a lot of times and have never been disappointed with any new thing i try expect for just this one time i ordered thai noodles and it was like a plate with noodles and peanut butter, but the rest of the time i had chicken bugers pasta, everything was delicous, service is really nice, friendly waiters, who actually communicate with you . There is a minium of like 30 minutes waiting whenever i go though, but parking is across the street."
Tony T.,"Hayward, United States",6,75,15,4.0,29/2/2012,This particular Cheesecake Factory location is great because it's right in Union Square.  We came here during lunchtime and we only had to wait 10 minutes.  Not bad for a Friday afternoon.  The food was good.  Portions were great!  Service was excellent.
Eric R.,"Austin, United States",0,7,,4.0,18/8/2010,Cuban sandwich is pretty good. The oreo cheesecake was awesome
M C.,"Union City, United States",4,8,,4.0,11/5/2008,"Review Reliability/Frequency: I don't come here often, but each time the food is relatively the same quality. At least I can express my opinion if it is worth your money. Food/Selection: With a name like The Cheesecake Factory, one has to assume that the cheesecake is near-top quality. While it may not be the best thing in the world, the experience of tasting their cheesecake will still be worth it (granted you plan to have some).  The bread is free on them and not too shabby either. The times I've been there, the bread has been somewhat warm to give them their (adequate) texture of freshness.  Their menu consists of appetizers that lean towards the pricey side, but are usually great picks. An appetizer would be good to have with groups of four or five people.  Main entrees are usually of large enough portions with ranging prices of ~$15 to ~$25 so it isn't one of those expensive restaurants where you get a bite on a large plate. If you're one to have a small stomach, I would consider sharing your dish with another small stomach. Got an above-average-sized stomach like me? The portions are just right. The only thing I can really vouch for is the pasta, and to put it bluntly, it's ""not too bad"". Visual appeal is usually very good and well-made. Quality is definitely there, but nothing spectacular. To an inexperienced tongue, the taste and texture might be on the side of being too much. For some, the sauce may be too thick or doesn't have enough flavor, however at the same time is good enough to be said it's good. It shouldn't disappoint too much to either the inexperienced or experienced pasta-eater is what I'm saying. Service:  At the desk, they take your name and either have you wait by the side to have someone escort you to your seat or give you an electronic device to notify you of your available table. The waiters/waitresses are nice enough to come by to refill your water and ask if everything's all right. However, if you want to get ahold of your waiter/waitress, that may be slightly difficult, because they're rather busy tending to their tables.  Conclusion: It's definitely a good place to go to for a meal. And if the meal itself isn't good enough for your guest or yourself, there's the cheesecake to fall back on. Service is good, food isn't bad, and the interior lends into the dining experience a bit as well. Price also shouldn't be surprising for a well-known restaurant like this by Union Square, San Francisco. Tips: - Seating usually is not a problem during non-peak hours, because of the (heated) outdoor seating that's also available on the floor with a view.  - Good place for a date! Bottom-line: Food is good enough for a good time and to spend ~$20+ on."
