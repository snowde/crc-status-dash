Rebecca B.,"San Francisco, CA",211,14,37,4.0,1/10/2017,"Never rate a place for their service unless they're blatantly racist.  The service: Could be better, but they're always busy so it's understandable and I could care less about shitty service. Food is FOOD.  Ambiance: I usually get seated on the right side of the restaurant, but I got seated at the left side near the bar. There is less light on this side. However, I could see the outdoor balcony and the rustic decorations set the perfect mood. The food: REALLY GOOD. Or I was just really hungry. I ordered the chicken marsala pasta. Reeeaaally good. We also got a margarita pizza which I could not get enough of. Tip #1: The wait isn't so bad when you spend it a floor below the factory in the Furniture department of Macy's. The workers are friendly and hide their annoyance very well. I recommend choosing leather couches that recline. 10/10. Tip #2: Order a strawberry lemonade. Unlimited refills, sugar at the rim, YUMMY.  Tip #3: Keep refilling the heavenly brown bread. It'll make you too full to order the cheesecake thus saving money which can be used to pay the meter. (Who goes to The Cheesecake Factory to get cheesecake anyways? Am I right?).  Have fun"
N A.,"San Francisco, CA",18,259,903,3.0,4/20/2017,The food here is not great but fattening the only good thing in the menu are the cheesecake desserts which are decadently rich and fattening.
Caroline P.,"Berkeley, CA",53,84,323,4.0,11/1/2016,"We were here on Sunday evening. The place was nice, as we remembered from the last time we ate there, 2 years ago. We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table.  The menu was really appealing and I was torn between a few options. The crispy chicken costolleta was really good and well cooked. It came with 5 green asparagus and a bunch of french fries (I asked for a substitution as it comes with mashed potatoes on the menu and it came with no charge). The chicken was crispy as expected and the lemon sauce was really good. Asparagus were pretty good too and still crunchy as I like them. Fries were okay, a bit cold. The service was nice, our waiter was really nice and helpful. My husband went for the veggie burger and was quite happy with it too.  We then ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to share, we ate it too fast to even snap a picture :-)  While waiting we enjoyed the view on Union Square (and its holiday ice rink opening tomorrow). I'll have to come back to try the Evelyn's favorite pasta :p And maybe another kind of cheesecake (I'll have to decide between chocolate hazelnut, mango key lime ou dutch apple caramel... Tough choice)."
Logan R.,"Long Beach, CA",231,61,85,5.0,10/6/2016,Little ghetto? Maybe.. but the food is delicious and only way it gets dinged stars for quality is if you choose something you're allergic to and you aren't intelligent. Will come back. Parking is easy. Food is quick. Bread is warm. Servers are dealing with angry people here coming from the mall..
Shawn T.,"San Francisco, CA",3,32,11,5.0,7/16/2017,"Five stars, more if they had them, for the lemon ricotta pancakes. Super delicious. Good with or without maple syrup. Only served during Sunday brunch. And only eaten after a workout to ease the guilt. Union square location can get pretty busy but it is worth the effort."
Riham B.,"San Francisco, CA",208,124,116,2.0,4/16/2016,"Two stars: One for the beautiful terrace with the excellent view. One because I like the cheesecase factory food.  I have been to SF maybe 5 times, and this time was the first time I was able to get a table at this place. Granted, this is because it's located in a huge Macy's in what is probably the most touristy part of the city, but still, the wait time here is always so crazy. The food is your typical Chessecake Factory food. Massive portions of many many calories. I usually go for the light menu, which is not really that light. If you are used to European portions, then order one main for two people. If you go for a main each and an appetizer, there will be a ton of leftovers. The portions are huge. The service is okay. Nothing too bad and nothing too special."
Marco C.,"Gilroy, CA",9,41,91,4.0,9/25/2016,"2 out of the 3 dishes we order were great, one will be the last time I order that(chicken jambalaya with shrimp  aka spicy) not so spicy and it was not that flavorful.. other then that try the egg roll sampler so good."
Samantha M.,"Raleigh, NC",16,2,,3.0,7/16/2017,"Food is good , typical Cheesecake Factory. The patio 8stories up is awesome but holy moly it's got some slow service!!!!!"
Xiomara L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,19,15,1.0,4/30/2017,Ordered a fettucini alfredo and gave me food poisoning! Seemed like they microwaved the thing
Charis J.,"Milpitas, CA",0,1,,3.0,7/16/2017,"Food: Very pleased with all that we ordered. Meals are decently priced but their must-try is definitely a cheesecake. They have a lot of choices and you'll be sure to find one you like.  One weird thing though-- on the menu my mom was strictly looking for any entree with rice. She ended up going with the carne asada steak medallions. One the menu it said it would come with rice and fresh corn. The dish did not come with anything but the carne asada plate. Multiple people told us it didn't come with rice but that was literally all my mom was looking at on the menu when she ordered. Online it even says this: ""Certified Angus Beef Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice."" So we ended up having to order a side that was already supposed to be included in her meal. I should have asked for the menu again so we all could have looked over the menu for the discrepancy.  Wait: It wasn't bad for a busy Saturday. We waited about 30 minutes around 5pm.  Ambiance: We sat outside and that was really nice. There was a good view over Union Square and we got lucky since the weather was warm. The sun hid behind the hotels just in time when the food came.  Service: It was super slow. I get it though, I always am patient with slow restaurants because I can only imagine how hectic it can be. One red flag though was when I saw my waiter bring over a basket of bread to the table next to us. He had another one with him that he kept circling around with but he didn't drop it off to our table. We were right there. But that was fine. He eventually gave it to us after we got our meal. Like, okay that would've been nice when I was waiting awhile for the food, but again, that was fine. What ticked me off was when he finally delivered our cheesecake. He didn't bring the utensils and when he came back another few minutes without it still, my mom kindly reminded him. He gave her this stern look in the eye and rudely told her he was already going to get it. Like bro, she was very polite about it. She was just reminding you. Don't patronize your paying customers after already being lackluster with your service. I'll just assume he's had a rough day. At least the food was bomb."
Nathan V.,"South of Market, San Francisco, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2017,Getting a table is long enough but I guess that's nothing because I expected to have food on my plate is twenty to thirty minutes but no I had to wait one hour and they didn't even bother to tell us how long it would take or that our waitress went on break not only that but apparently it takes forty five minutes to make a simple soda and they even forgot to add flavoring I do not suggest going here.
Gabryella S.,"Miami Beach, FL",12,6,6,2.0,7/3/2017,"Service is terrible and extremely slow. Staff is rude and not prepared to solve a simple customer request that goes out of the planned. Get a seat inside, because outside is cold and windy - and you might get a visit from a nasty pigeon on your table."
Mikhail F.,"Stanwood, WA",0,11,1,4.0,7/25/2017,"If you're a tourist in the Bay Area, this is a must. The food and service is good. Just like any other Cheesecake Factory nationwide. You're pretty much in it just for the Patio views. It's on the 8th floor of the Macy's Department Store and it has its own elevator. The view of Union Square and the surrounding buildings is lovely if you like watching the hustling city. This is a very busy restaurant located in one of the most congested and busiest parts of San Francisco. So expect long lines and waiting times on the weekends and during the summer."
Wendy L.,"San Francisco, CA",9,100,596,3.0,6/16/2016,Haven't come here for a long time! We ordered the following: -Ahi Tartare (Tasted OK but there are only a few little tiny pieces Ahi Tuna) $7.95 -Meat Loaf (lunch factory / Tasted OK) $13.50 (Make sure to ask for more sauce) -Pasta Da Vinvi (lunch factory / Tasted OK) $13.95 *Friendly Server
Bharath S.,"Cupertino, CA",104,3,,4.0,7/8/2017,Always enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory! Surprisingly low wait times and delicious cheesecake make for a great weekend brunch :)
Linda S.,"San Francisco, CA",1,21,,5.0,7/24/2017,"Took my mom here for her birthday. Mom loves cheesecake factory me don't understand the hype until Thursday Wow. Mom had the Chicken and Biscuits she loved them. Here's where the five stars come in. Our waiter will not say his name don't want to get him in trouble. I was going to order the Tuffle honey chicken, I was at work just drooling over the picture. My Man says Nope you don't want that  the picture looks great but most of the staff tried it and it's Terrible, alrighty then lets try the fish and chips they were good but I love the fact he told me, he made a good day great. I work downtown and I don't like hanging out down here to many people. So if I'd had the chicken this would have been a different review."
Stephanie U.,"Porter Ranch, CA",44,3,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Bad service. Trash food. After being seated, we waited tremendously long for a waitress to ask what we want to drink/ eat. Wouldn't recommend to anyone , outrageous customer service , we waited for our food for an hour and after getting our food no one inquired if it was good or if we needed anything . The pasta was uneatable , wasn't fully cooked and it was clumpy it even stuck to my spoon . We questioned if it came out of the freezer. It appears two other couples had the same problem. Honestly for a high quality restaurant the food or service wasn't anything close to it . HA even McDonald's gives the type of food it promises. Bathrooms had no toilet paper and my stall had no lock. What a disappointment."
Shania A.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,,3.0,7/22/2017,"This is a great restaurant. For those who haven't been here before, this is a bar, restaurant, and bakery all in one, yet still perfect for kids.  Food: The kid's menu prices were from 6-8 dollars, but the serving sizes are quite large and hard for a child to finish but worth the money The adult menu prices were around 15 dollars, but the serving size is HUGE, so definitely get 1 plate for 2. The alfredo sauce pasta on the kid's menu was a bummer because it was just boiled pasta with a small amount of sauce, nothing special. We had to ask for more sauce because it was hardly flavorful and we had to add a lot of salt and pepper. Comes with a drink The sliders on the kid's menu were great, my kid couldn't finish them. It is just a bun and chicken though :( Comes with fries and a drink. Make sure to salt your fries because they are unsalted. We got this fried chicken platter that came with a ton of fried chicken that was so soft on the inside(20 pieces) and some corn salad(delish!) and a baked/mashed potato. Definitely worth 15 dollars. When they give you your water they also give you 2 types of bread and a delicious butter. Environment:  Really Loud The patio spots are easier to get but for us it was in the sun so we declined They told us the wait time was 30 min but it was definitely less The front is dark and not good for kids but the back is perfect Really crowded in both the eating area and the waiting area. There were just people standing around Needs to make the waiting area bigger, we could not move. The view out of the patio though is amazing and totally worth it. Sky view of the Union Square Kind of confusing to get to the restaurant. Also got a virgin mojito, great Salted Caramel cheesecake WILL be the BEST thing you have ever eaten Service: Our waiter was kind of slow and we switched waiters in the middle The waiters didn't bother checking up on us in the middle when we wanted something. We had to ask other waiters around or ask ours when she/he was roaming around Other than that pretty good but the people seating us were unattentive. Food was 4 stars, Environment 3 1/2 stars Service 3 stars P.S Most Cheesecake Factories take reservations for odd times, not peak times."
Mary Ann H.,"Millbrae, CA",2,4,8,2.0,8/21/2016,"Presentation was great but our lettuce had dirt and a black bug and our meat ball was raw in the center, we liked what we ordered but got grossed out after seeing that and second attempt of lettuce also had dirt :( but our server was very kind that's why we gave stars."
Cindee T.,"San Mateo, CA",44,221,487,4.0,8/11/2015,"Expect to queue. Worth the wait and visit. My third visit to Cheesecake Factory in the city. Enjoyed every single visit - at least for the food. Visited at mid day with two overseas guests, wait was approx 20mins, the shortest of the three visits that I had.  We were seated promptly but the server took years to come by. Was the least friendly and inattentive server I have met at Cheesecake Factory. Ordered onion rings, Vietnamese rolls, red velvet cheesecake and 2 other cheesecakes which I can't recall right now. The food as usual were yummy. The Vietnamese rolls are not the authentic Vietnamese roll but they tasted fine. The onion rings were super good.  The cheesecakes were of course the main highlight. My guests were overwhelmed with the options available and were so torn having to choose three out of the entire list.  All the cheesecake tasted fantastic. Key Lime Cheesecake is my ultimate favorite among the list. Definitely worth visiting and worth the wait. Try to visit during mid day might help to shave off some wait time."
