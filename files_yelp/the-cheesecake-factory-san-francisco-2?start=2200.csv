Betty T.,"New York, United States",4,30,,5.0,16/8/2010,"I wanted Mexican food.  In the Mission.  Soooooooo not happening on my SF trip with kids in tow.  Soooo not into chain restaurants.  I absolutely wanted to hate this place but it actually turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip.  So, instead of Mexican in the Mission that I wanted we went to the Cheesecake Factory, that seems logical, right? So it's in Macy's on the 8th floor and there's outdoor seating! So cool.  Great view of Union Square.  The day we decided to go there was a band (Moonalice) playing in the square- so even though we had to wait 15 minutes for a table we had an amazing view of Union Square and listening to some tunes.   This place has everything but the kitchen sink on it's menu, so I thought I was at least going to make an attempt to squelch my Mexican food craving (yay!).  Had some wine actually called Cheesecake Factory (which was very good, btw).  We ordered some spicy quacamole to start.  We were hungry (we had just spend the day at the California Academy of Sciences) so it seemed like the guac was taking a long time.  We asked our waitress, Katherine (who was also one of our better servers during our two weeks of eating out and eating badly) ""what gives?"" and she said that ""the guac is made to order"", I guess they were busy toiling away to make it spicy and it would be out in a moment.  It finally arrived and it was super delish! Nice and spicy and fresh! Give me lots of yummy guac and you make me a very happy woman!  The guac and chips also came with some very yummy sour cream and salsa!  So, in keeping with the Mexican theme, I also ordered some chicken tacos.  This was pretty good too! Oh joy! The chicken left a little something to be desired in the way of texture- I believed it was in cubed chunks which were kinda on the chewy side, but was definitely ok...the sides of beans and rice were really yummy.  Looking at some of the other plates it's kind of overwhelming the way they serve their food and the portions are humongous.  You could probably order a pasta dish here and eat lunch for at least a couple of days.  I'm not into big portions and left quite a bit of my meal behind. I was very pleasantly surprised by this place.  As I mentioned before I'm not really into chains like this, but we had a great time!  We also made a friend! We were stalked by a seagull outside the plexiglass sort of pretend window (we were outdoors), I guess it was some sort of seagull barrier.  My mom (she had the chicken medeira, which she thoroughly enjoyed and ate most of, I won't even mention what my kids ate) decided to give the seagull some French fries and almost had her fingers nipped off!  My kids named the seagull Frenchie, who from then on stalked us for the rest of the meal.  He glared at us from his perch outside the plexiglass and looked longingly at our plates.  I almost thought he might fly over and join our party.  We offered Frenchie wine through the plexiglass, but only French fries seemed to do.  Frenchie rejected sourdough bread!  We had a photo shoot with Frenchie and then we bid adieu avowing to return the next day for lunch prior to returning to New York, alas it was not to be- all that fun caused us to be very weary the next morning and we just made our check out deadline by the skin of our teeth.  Oh yeah, the cheesecake is good too. : )"
Louie C.,"San Bruno, United States",49,32,1,4.0,26/7/2006,Out of all the times I have come here I've only ordered the cheesecake once. I never have room for dessert! The portions are huge and that's not a bad thing!  I always have their salads. They're great! Try the bbq chicken ranch or cobb salad. Yum!
Mike V.,"Daly City, United States",173,171,59,3.0,27/9/2006,"Let's get an overall feel for this place... Parking:  there is none unless u park in a lot Price:  on my budget, I call it pricey...but if you don't mind spending about $20 a person, it's cool Menu:  Pretty good and diverse...typical stuff, burgers, plates, and all that other jazz Wait:  forever...takes forever to get a table (gotta carry that pager thingy) and takes forever to get food...reserve lots of time if u plan on eating here Actual Food:  pretty good...not great, but pretty damn good Service:  eh, a few funny people, lots of mediocre overworked folks... So there you have it..."
Ginni S.,"Cupertino, United States",41,310,,3.0,17/10/2006,"The LONG wait -- you have to even wait to get the beeper.  What's that about?  The portions are huge and the cheesecakes are great (except I'm always full by the time we're supposed to order dessert.) Major turn-off is still that huge long wait...I don't think I've ever been seated within 10 minutes, unless I sit at the bar.  I don't get it.  WHY???"
Rachel B.,"Hayward, United States",122,684,111,2.0,12/12/2006,"If I wait in the 10 items or less line with a Stouffer's frozen entree and a Sara Lee cheesecake I'd probably have a better meal than I have ever had here, with a shorter wait. The cheesecake is like a brick, none of the flavors taste like more than cream cheese to me.  Go a few extra blocks to North Beach or SOMA, even if you have been shopping Union Square all day and it *seems* like the best option for dinner."
Melissa W.,"Belmont, United States",31,281,,3.0,2/2/2007,"The good: perfect seared tuna salad. Nice little pile of dark greens, a few slices of good tomato, a little skimpy on the avocado slices but ok, and then some very nice perfectly seared rare Ahi. I was trying to stick to just meat and veggies and this made being ""on a diet"" so much nicer. The bad: Arriving shortly before noon for lunch we were told to seat ourselves in the bar and waved away. The tiny space directly across from the bar was quite full. I kept walking to the tables on the other side and sat down. We sat there 10 or 15 minutes before anyone bothered with us.  A waiter came and asked, ""Did you get menus""  ""No, actually, we didn't."" ""Did someone seat you here?""  ""No, we were told to help ourselves to seating in this direction."" (I showed him the hand wave gesture we have received.) ""That meant just the bar."" (Turns and flounces away with a big stupid smile.) The ugly: It's a chain with too much attitude (see above). So many much better places to eat so close by, everyone else has asked why this place is always so crowded and I can't say I know either. I came here for the big menu while I was being picky about what I eat."
A H.,"Denver, United States",45,112,7,4.0,8/2/2007,"I thought this place was pretty decent - I've been to the one in Chicago and this one in SF definitely tops Chi - the view is great if you are lucky enough to get seated overlooking Union Square, and in the summer, sitting outside, it must be wonderful. As my mid-west fiancee has taught me to expect, you should expect good value from a chain restaurant, and the CF doesn't disappoint.  Limited selection of rather overpriced draught beers, but that's OK.  The reasonable prices, massive portions and location more than make up for it.  Go for food, not drink and depending on the season and weather, it could be almost be romantic.  1 beer + 2 entrees = $36 (inc tax and tip).  It gets 4 start due to the location and the value for money.   It's busy - but that's a good sign, right?"
Erick A.,"Los Angeles, United States",22,121,2,2.0,2/3/2007,"An hour wait for a table?  30 min wait for our first round of drinks?  Room temperature spinach dip accompanied with stale tortilla chips? LAME.    i've been to the san diego and irvine locations and i don't remember them being this tragic.  what a waste of space with one of the most beautiful views of the city!  avoid this tourist trap.   i really hate to admit that the dulce de leche cheesecake we shared was fabulous, but it really was.  two stars for that."
Sophie D.,"San Francisco, United States",40,304,,2.0,6/5/2007,"This is the kind of place my friend's 14-year-old sister and her ""BFFs!"" go to when they want to pretend to be adults and dine alone.  Why wait 45 minutes to be seated at a noisy restaurant that lacks any sort of charm or personality? While the menu is huge and you can order many yummy appetizers or entrees (or duh, the desserts), it really isn't worth it. Dining on top of Macy's with a sea of older tourists or 14-year-olds? No thanks. I'll go elsewhere for my cheesecake."
Faye P.,"San Francisco, United States",28,129,3,1.0,16/5/2007,"Reasons to Avoid this Hellhole: 1. the long wait. what the hell. just go shopping at macys. 2. this place is a tourist trap. the midwesterners on vacation swarm to eat fat mounds of pasta and meat.  3. the plates fit enough food for three starving people. and people eat it all! 4. congealed fat. the reason why taking leftovers home is not so pretty a few hours later.  5. muffin tops abound 6. for some, this is the epitome of classy. oh come for your birthday and special occasions! god, really, there are so many other  great restaurants in sf that are not a chain.  7. say hello to coronary artery disease and fat lined blood vessels... this place will rob you. the cheesecake is the only decent thing about this factory. but in that case, you go because you want those fat drenched calories and thats ok. just don't kid yourself that the food is in any way gourmet."
J Q.,"San Francisco, United States",19,113,12,2.0,6/9/2007,"Cheesecake factory.. ugh What should you get this time? That roasted chicken rosemary dish, the wannabe kobe beef dish with the wasabe/mashed potatoes, the ridiculous factory burger, the over-the-top drink selection. When you look at someone's menu, and you see ads on ever other page it should tell you something is up.. As far as location goes; yes, it's nice to sit atop Union Square and watch the city before you head back down to the masses, but the restaurant isn't worth the price. Location: 5 stars Atmosphere: 3 stars Service: 3 stars Menu selection: 2.5 stars Return-factor: 3 stars Last impression: 2.5 stars"
Jen Y.,"Oakland, United States",146,474,54,3.0,13/1/2008,"I've been to this restaurant several times and have always ALWAYS had to wait for a table no matter what time of day it was. In the heart of Union Square it's pretty much inevitable it's going to be packed, especially on the weekends.  The waitstaff have always been very nice and knowledgable about the menu which is impressive because it's about a million pages long, almost like a diary in size. The food isn't bad, but it's not fantastic. Not bad enough to complain about it, and not good enough to rave. The Cheesecake Factory serves it's purpose at the time being and you leave stuffed because the portions are pretty generous. Of course you can't leave without getting desert. The hussle and bustle of the restaurant is kind of a turn-off as you are bombard with the crowd of people waiting for tables upstairs as you exit the elevator. They give you electronic buzzers to let you know when your table is ready. Although your table isn't exactly ready. You hand them the buzzer and they tell you to wait to the side (which can take up to 10 mins) and you have to listen out for a person to yell out your name amongst the hectic crowd while saying ""excuse me, excuse me,"" to people in your way as you try to get to him.  This place is worth a try, definitely. But it's usually not the type of  restaurant you'd go back to often."
Irv M.,"Oakland, United States",3,19,,1.0,2/4/2014,"expected to wait 30 min to get in on a Saturday, but not 40 minutes to receive our order! terrible service!! yuk!!"
Serena S.,"Menlo Park, United States",4,14,5,4.0,9/10/2010,I had a salad it was very good. The portions are very big.The wait staff was very helpful.  I also left my iphone on the bar  and when I returned for it more than 2 hours later someone had turned it in thank goodness. This store is inside Maceys at the top floor and has a great view of Union Square.
Charmian W.,"San Francisco, United States",179,73,15,2.0,29/12/2009,"This place is one of those places where you pay a tad bit more for the view, because the food wasn't all that great. I came here for the first time today with my friends for lunch - only ordered the ""Lunch Special"" Garlic Noodles with Chicken; total including tax was $13.09. For a total of $15 and a spectacular view of Union Square, here's what I got: - Decent service. The waitress was cheerful and helpful enough, but I suppose there were a ton of other customers as well since she didn't come by that much.. Also, her tone kinda implied that we SHOULD order something to drink - we're poor students, give us a break and give us water already! - Chicken was superrrr dry!!! Drier than my leather purse, seriously. It didn't have a lot of taste either. - Noodles had better flavor than the chicken, a tad too salty though. - Large portion, but it looked as if I could finish everything and still be fine. Turns out the bottom of my bowl was 1/4-filled with all the oil used in the cooking, so towards the end my noodles were super saturated with oil. I don't like wasting food, so by the time I was done, I couldn't look at my friends' cheesecakes without feeling the need to puke. - We sat outside - there are these heater tower thingies but they don't do much when there's wind. View was nice, but too bad we couldn't sit indoors. Come dressed in layers, because SF weather can get nasty..  - For a place with barely OK food, it was surprisingly quite packed. We tried coming here several days ago but didn't actually eat here till today - they told us the wait time was 3 hours last time we were here. - Friends liked their cheesecakes. I'd say one slice is pretty pricey though - around $6-8 per slice. =// - Only sit outside if you don't mind pigeons. A few of my friends screamed a bit with pigeons flying/walking around our table - there were several instances where I thought my food was going to get soiled with feathers/bird poo. I even watched some pigeons land on other tables to pick at the food left untouched by the customers. If anything, I'd rather not come back here. Location is great so maybe a pre-prom/winterball/other school formal dance dinner with friends might be good, otherwise just go to Westfield/SF Center food courts and get something cheaper&yummier to eat."
Carlie R.,"San Francisco, United States",45,19,,5.0,12/12/2008,"Love coming here. The food is very tasty and the cheesecake? Well, what can I say. I'm addicted to cheesecake. My favorite food here? Well that would have to be the Artichoke lunch mmmmmmmmm. Have never had to wait very long for my food. Service has always been great, but, then, I get here early for lunch. Will have to try it sometime for dinner."
Cristoper C.,"San Francisco, United States",4,27,,3.0,6/2/2008,Strawberry lemonade... I loved this. The right amount of sour with the right amount of sweetness; now this is a thirst quencher. Next comes the food.. lets see: Excellent? Nah. Good? Well... lets see.. there are good ones; and now you know why I gave it 3 stars. A few good meals and a great lemonade just isn't enough to push you to 4 stars. I wish I could give half a star; that strawberry lemonade was just delicious. I finished that first glass just seconds after it was given to us.
Betty T.,"Torrance, United States",68,211,75,4.0,24/12/2009,"i've committed a crime.  i've tried 2 other cheesecake factories in two other locations before trying the one in my hometown of san francisco. please, please forgive this naiive and innocent creature typing this idiotic apology.  so. cheesecake factory. it's average. it's not too special, i'm afraid, and it's not that different from the other ones. the food was delectable as always, the service was good as always, etc.  the single thing that sets this apart from the other ones is the UNGODLY AMOUNT OF TEENAGE COUPLES FROLICKIN-- just kidding. really, the one thing that sets this place apart is the fact that you're on top of macys in the middle of downtown. if you eat outside, there are spectacular views and it makes the dining experience romantic."
Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, United States",46,359,22,3.0,2/2/2008,"The positives--so many items to choose from, so if you didn't like what you had the last time you went, try something else. Also, when I went there, I had unlimited refills on my strawberry lemonade. Yum! Cheesecake isn't too bad either... The negatives--when I was there, it was a 20-40 min wait. And this was during lunchtime! You also have to take the right elevator or escalator to get here, and I got lost the first time I came. Obviously this is a tourist trap, so go to another cheesecake factory in the Bay Area if you have the means to drive."
Christina S.,"San Francisco, United States",218,322,1,4.0,18/11/2008,The avocado egg rolls are to die for and worthy of the wait PERIOD
