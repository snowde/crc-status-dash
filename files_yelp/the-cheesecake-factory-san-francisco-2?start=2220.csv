Eileen M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,5,,4.0,15/9/2010,"I have never been here for dinner because the lines have always been too long. However, I love going for lunch when the lines aren't as intimidating. It is such a lovely place to go when it's a nice day because the view is amazing, you can see all of downtown. My mother and I like to order a pizza and a salad with a few beers it's the perfect amount of food for two people and it is pretty inexpensive. The waiters every time I have been there have been very nice, I would recommend this place to anyone coming into town."
star w.,"Bay, United States",109,66,32,1.0,17/11/2008,Agree! Over Rated big time! So is the Elephant Bar ewwwwww!
Janet Z.,"San Francisco, United States",233,438,1710,5.0,9/3/2009,I came here last year for my friend's birthday! I always get the lemonade! Free refills! The FRIED CALAMARI was good! it comes with this refreshing little salad and their ROASTED VEGETABLES AND GOAT CHEESE PIZZA  is good! I love the combination of all off the veggies! it is just something about eggplant that makes the pizza oh soo gooood. I would def come here just to get that pizza. The last time I came here I ordered the THE FACTORY BURGER and it was pretty good! That was when I discovered that cheddar and beef go so well together my boyfriend at the current time got the DOUBLE B.B.Q. BACON CHEESEBURGER it was pretty massive and for a guy like him he didn't even finish it and believe me he is huge!
Donna Lee S.,"Holtville, United States",0,17,,5.0,4/9/2012,I sat at the bar. It's the Cheesecake Factory... You can never go wrong here. It never seems to fail me. If you want to be in an elegant and affordable setting I would highly suggest this place. I'm not to sure on the servers here but I do new the bartenders were really friendly
H. A.,"South San Francisco, United States",3,117,2,5.0,22/8/2009,"Seems a little silly that I'm reviewing a chain restaurant in San Francisco, but I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. The food is always consistent and the cheesecakes are all delicious.I don't think I have ever had anything here that wasn't good, they are generous with their portions, and there is so much on the menu to choose from.  I come here often and like to sit outside on sunny days.  I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!"
Claud M.,"Oakland, United States",28,44,34,5.0,13/6/2006,"PROS:  the view from the terrace over union square, excellent atmosphere, good service, large portions, and DELICIOUS FOOD! CONS:  touristy, HOARDS of ppl, long wait, and eating outside can be quite chilly. Ironically, I could do without the cheesecake though..."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, United States",41,15,,3.0,27/6/2006,"I've enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory at other locations but this one is the worst. Every tourist in SF must see The Cheesecake Factory and think ""Oh good, a restaurant i recognize"" because man oh man, this place is always packed.  My friends wanted to go there for a birthday. They didn't listen when i said the wait would be 2 hours. I got dragged along knowing I'd be hungry for hours - so I secretly ate a small dinner before heading over ;-) ... 1 BART ride and 4 hours later we were seated.  My friends were all mad at *me* for some reason! It sucks being the fore-bearer of bad news. I tried to warn them, oh well. Aside from the wait - the portions are asinine. I'd love this place if they had smaller portions, shorter waits, or at least took reservations.  At least the food is generally pretty good - but never great. I think the Cheesecake Factory is part of some conspiracy with McDonald's to make America fat because the portions are ludicrously large. Is this supposed to be some sort of replacement for guilt-inducing ""All you can eat"" places?  It's OK to order gargantuan dishes and eat it all - but ""all you can eat"" means you are a pig? I once went on a date to Cheesecake factory and we split a Santa Fe salad and were both quite satisfied.  It was hard to resist the urge to order tons of food after waiting so long to eat - resisting that ""omg I'm going to starve to death if I don't eat soon"" feeling - but I'm glad we did.  Portion control saved my wallet *and* my waistline that night!"
Emily F.,"Brooklyn, United States",10,85,,3.0,9/3/2007,"Just to prove I'm not a snob. Sometimes, you just can't put a price on heat lamps and an awesome view of Union Square. The bottom line:  I bet the Hartford CF doesn't have a view like that!  ERF I'm going to be dead broke by the time the last of these out-of-town guests departs!"
Patrice S.,"San Francisco, United States",32,70,11,1.0,4/4/2007,GO BACK TO SUBURBIA!  Someone gave me a $50 gift certificate to eat at your establishment. If I could ever actually get a table that would buy my fiance and me an AWESOMELY overpriced entree and a drink each. Maybe I'll just stop in for like three cheesecakes and treat all of my coworkers to dessert.
K W.,"San Francisco, United States",40,346,42,1.0,23/8/2007,No.  Just No.  Why is this place always so packed?  Why are the decibels in here off the chart?  Why do I need to go down one level to plop myself in the furniture section of Macy's while waiting for the beeper to go off?   Out of Towners:  Don't do it.   In Towners:  You know better. Food is fine.  Just the location and general feeling is not of relaxation and enjoyment.
William R.,"San Francisco, United States",157,124,2,1.0,28/8/2007,"8.25.2007 8:00 PM ""...I went to the Cheesecake Factory..."" ""...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!   YOU IDIOT!!!...."" ...was basically how most of my conversations started regarding this fuck stick establishment.  I didn't want to go here, for obvious reasons but my girlfriend wanted to check it out....  I wasn't too hungry at the time, so I agreed to deal with the wait and go where no reasonably decent San Franciscan would go.... An hour and fifteen minutes, 3 cigarettes, and a tour of the Macy's furniture gallery later, our stupid buzzer finally starts flashing and vibrating.   We're hustled over to out table and the first thing i notice, is that there are freakin' crumbs ALL OVER my seat: hey...buss boy....you have vinyl seats so you can WIPE THEM OFF.... Our waitress, good ol' Stephanie, greeted us immediately and took our drink, appetizer, and entree order in one panicky swoop.  If this was any other place, I'd be upset but I'm sure most people know exactly what they want when they're seated since they all had to endure the 1+ hours to sit.  Anyways, cheap white wine, garden salad, calamari, and chicken Marsala rounded out the selections.   30 minutes...i shit you not....30 minutes later, our wine arrives.  It's funny because I noticed another 2 top across the way seated after us, already had their din din! Another 15 minutes or so later, our calamari arrives first...COLD.  Salad and entree arrive shortly after... We told ol' Steph at this point that that our calamari was cold, she said ,"" sorry, I'm new..."" and took off.   The manager then approaches the table and asks me a few minutes later to confirm I was served cold calamari.... Anyways, when the calamari came, it was actually good...but HUGE portions.  We shared everything and it was too much food.  This place is geared more towards the So-Cal chain lovers or mid-west out-of-town glutton junkies...and the crowd is exactly that.   Worst part? I was too full for cheesecake when I really needed some cheering up... I think I can sum up the Cheesecake Factory's mission fairly simply: on Food -- give them quantity and STFU on service -- Turn and burn; who the f*ck cares on management -- f*ck em'; we'll never see them again anyways"
Lynn O.,"San Francisco, United States",11,127,34,3.0,13/10/2007,"I've been here several times before, most recently the other night to host some visitors from out of town (yes, it's prime for tourists in Union Square).  For the five of us, the total came to $109.15-- five!  Not including tip, and only including two drinks (lemonade with a cup full of ice: $3.95 each).  The kids were happy with their orders-- bang-bang chicken and something or other, and chicken costolleta (essentially, high end KFC style fare).  One parent looked disappointed by the miso salmon (salmon on top of rice with a few token snow peas as garnish-- the menu description leads you to believe the veggies play a bigger part in the meal), the other was happy with her Jamaican shrimp (lots of sauce in that one).  My eggplant sandwich looked pretty, but the taste didn't command $9.95.   There are not many vegetarian options aside from basic pasta (but who'd want to pay $10 upward for a plate of angel hair topped with tomato sauce you could make at home?), one veggie burger, and one eggplant sandwich.  Good luck dining here if you're vegan.  A whole lot of chicken dishes, though, and lots of salads and pastas with chicken, too.  The seafood variety was limited to salmon, shrimp, and tuna.  The nice thing about TCF is that at least it's okay to substitute, for example, fries for broccoli (take a look under ""side orders"" and choose your substitute) with no extra charge. As other reviewers mentioned, the service is pitifully slow, fairly inattentive, and table turn over is the servers' priority.  One of the hostesses was just lazily sitting behind the front podium as a small queue formed to get a table, letting the host do all the name taking.  (Regardless of whether or not it was her break time, that's just poor business practice.)  I noticed our server would suggest the more expensive dishes on the menu as well, so I suppose that's not all that uncommon of restaurant staff for squeaking in larger tips.  Definitely try to arrive as early as possible if you come here-- the wait gets longer and longer as the hours elapse (and TCF doesn't accept reservations)."
Zakkary Z.,"Eureka, United States",9,22,,4.0,16/10/2007,"I like the food and love the cheesecake, but I hate the wait. Here's the trick to get your fix without the crowd:  Get there when they open.  They have a cheaper (before 5 pm) lunch menu to make it worth your while. If I can't open the place then I get the cheesecake to go and enjoy the great food court in the basement."
Leah O.,"San Francisco, United States",5,37,1,4.0,30/10/2007,Went there on my first night in the city as it was really close to my hotel. Loved it. Its so much nicer than i expected with that name. Great terrace as well with amazing views in the evening. yes there was a bit of a wait....but I'd just landed from London so it didn't strike me as unusual. It was one of the few places with a good buzz on a wednesday evening...which was exactly what I wanted. Loved the food! Huge yummy portions....i spent so long looking at that ridiculously long menu...making many mental notes on what to order next time...as there will be a next time (and I don't even like cheesecake).
Keila E.,"Los Angeles, United States",84,161,,4.0,14/12/2007,"I love this place. I know, I know. The wait is notoriously dreadful..the food is generic...and its a motherfucking chain restaurant. But its tasty comfort food and the portions are big. Oh, and it is pretty expensive. BUT the portions are so darn big you can take half of it home!! The appetizers are delicious (especially the mac n cheese balls, the crab rangoon, thai lettuce wraps) I have had the burgers here and wasnt impressed. The pasta dishes are amazing and the chicken marsala is always a good option!  The last time I was here I got the hibachi steak that came with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. It was delish!!! The potatoes could have standed a little more wasabi but they were warm and creamy!  The cheesecake is always a must. I usually get the banana cream cheesecake (it has bavarian cream on it!!) but I have tried the tres leche cheesecake which was delightful.  Come here on a Tuesday or Wednesday on an off season for Macys. you wont wait at all."
Chili B.,"Los Angeles, United States",14,481,,4.0,19/12/2007,"Location location location.  Christmas shopping in Union Square on a Thursday night, there really isn't much choice when it comes to dinner spots.  Sure, it's a chain, they're all the same. The view is great, location can't be beat, food is always good, drinks are good. Desserts are delicious."
Angie Y.,"San Francisco, United States",3,159,,2.0,30/12/2007,"The food and cheesecakes probably deserve 3 stars, but the wait! Reservation obviously doesn't mean anything to this place, so don't bother, and be ready to show some aggressive side of you to get a table even after you got the beeper rings. Just went back after 6 years of hiatus.  Just can't understand why I still remebered the name 'Cheesecake Factory'. (Erase it.. earse it from memory..) Yes.. it's all my fault.."
Flora W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,100,1,4.0,11/5/2008,"It should be 3 stars but I just can't help it. Their cheesecake is sooo damn good.  I come here once in a while and their food is average but good for a franchise. The fire cracker salmon roll are pretty good. The buffalo wings are just too spicy for me. I can't really eat spice. Oh, I also like the popcorn shrimp. I've tried their sandwiches and I don't like any of them. They are just nasty. I usually stick with their pastas. I like the farfalle, spicy chipotle easy on the spice, and the louisiana chicken pasta. Their salmon is decent too I come here for their cheesecake of course. I love the oreo cheesecake and tiramisu! They are my favorite from the whole list. The chocolate godiva is pretty good too. They have a long list of all different kinds to choose from. I'm always satisfied with the cheesecake here! The cheesecake itself deserves 5 stars."
Dessa S.,"San Francisco, United States",8,95,43,2.0,20/3/2010,Love the view because it's on top of Macy's but the food here is overpriced. Desserts are good of course but that really does not make up for the fact their food sucks! Their Orange Chicken was hard & their sauce just gross to say the least. Veggies weren't cooked properly and the rice was still undercooked. Been here twice hoping it would get better but both times were disappointments. NEVER GOING BACK.... SORRY!!!! big hype for no reason!
Luis O.,"San Francisco, United States",9,17,,4.0,18/3/2012,"The food is ok and a bit pricey, but it's just something about the Cheesecake Factory that's just very fun. I love coming here and feeling like I'm having an amazing time in the big, bustling city with my friends. They have several options for cheesecake, and they are very good. This place isn't great if you're trying to stay healthy, but it's worth a visit at least once and make sure to sit outside!"
