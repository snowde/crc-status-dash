terrific h.,"Foster City, United States",2,43,,4.0,2/5/2008,"I used to think US' cheesecake is just strong cheese and making you stomach feel packed.  But then the taste of cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory makes me changing my view.  it's just so delicious.  I've tried various, still, the best is the original cheese cake. Personal suggestion: buy a take-away, at 11pm-12am, watching TV with cheese cake as post-dinner dessert, magnificent!!!"
Mr. E.,"Redwood City, United States",3,20,10,4.0,11/3/2010,"I just love this place....I like the food it fills me up...what do you expect for under $20....think about this..they have so much overhead, if they are going to be in the bay area they have to charge that much just to survive,,,great place for everyone GO Cheesecake Factory!!!!!"
Ash C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,28,,1.0,17/8/2008,"Wow.  The food here is atrocious, and it's DEFINITELY not worth your hard-earned money.  If anything, you're paying for CF's rent...not the food, service, or the drinks. My biggest problem with this place is the bar.  Getting a table in the evening will probably take an hour.  I think it's reasonable for me to want a drink or two while i'm waiting (oh, there's nowhere to wait, btw).  Believe it or not, the bar only has about 8 seats, and two bartenders working during peak weekend dinner hours.  It took me 20 minutes to order a beer.  F'ing ridiculous.  I kept thinking to myself, ""wow, they must really hate making money.""  If I have to go there next time (as in I'm dragged there, kicking and screaming), I'm bringing a loaded flask.  I'm not shitting you. Did I mention the food is atrocious?  I really tried to like this place during the 6 or 7 times I've been here.  But it's just terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible."
Alina M.,"Sunnyvale, United States",5000,492,1034,4.0,24/3/2009,"I used to work as a hostess years and years ago here and as a hostess, I disliked it here. It was so packed, it was hard to walk around and show people to their tables, and it was unorganized and so chaotic. Oh wait, that's the same reason I dislike it here as a regular customer too... Located on top of Macy's overlooking Union Square, it's in a centralized location. And being in a centralized location, you'd think that it would be more organized but it is so freaking chaotic here. Starting from the bottom floor, you have to wait in line to go into the elevator except there are 2 elevators and tourists don't know that only ONE goes to cheesecake. When you get up to Cheesecake, you pour into a huge roomful of people and you think you're in the line to put your name on the list and you don't realize until minutes later that you're not in any line and in fact, you're just waiting in the area that people are waiting to be seated. Then you go to the front hostess counter where there's no real line so you push your way to the front and get your little beeper and it's normally a 25+ minute wait. Yo could go to the bar but it's super duper tiny so there's no space to sit. There are table but only 3 so good luck with that. So then you wait, but you can't sit because there's only 2 small benches for people to wait so you stand amongst dozens of people with your shopping bags getting heavier and heavier. So that's pretty much the worst part of it. If you can get through that, the rest is a breeze. Staff is pretty nice there. Food is delicious. If you eat outside and it starts raining though, there is no tarp over head so you have to go inside and wait all over again for a table. Why is it so hard to put a retractable tarp outside???  Working here, I met a lot of famous people. (I didn't know Mos Def was so short!!!)  Go here during non peak times and you don't have to deal with the mess."
Kristine D.,"Mountain View, United States",132,724,517,1.0,30/12/2008,"This is the saddest addition to Union Square in my opinion!  Located inside Macy's, people trek up to this dressed up junk food distillery and think they've experienced classic San Francisco when they waddle out thicker around the waistline and lighter in the wallet.  There are so many other locales around Union Square to have a unique San Francisco experience!  There's Caruso's inside the St. Francis, several small bistros on Maiden Lane (a small side street off Union Square), Lefty O'Doul's (the original sports bar and the place my father held a job during college), Eppler's Bakery which has been a San Francisco tradition since my grandparents pushed strollers around the area and so much more!  Venture out people, don't simply worship at the altar of the big chain eateries."
Sonya D.,"San Diego, United States",1610,651,37,4.0,11/1/2011,"This location is really nice. I love how the outdoor seating has a nice view of the city/big buildings surrounding it. It's also packed with people, so it took us at least 30 min to get a table. The food here is consistently good for being a big name chain. We started out with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were really yummy and came with 3 super tasty dipping sauces. After I ordered the Luau Salad, which had a better presentation than taste. I think I was a little disappointed because I was trying to be healthy, and instead it was practically all deep fried cracker. But if you're in the mood for that type of thing, it would be delicious. Their cocktails are also tasty and made strong. The guy I was with ordered the Fettuccine with Sundried Tomatoes and Chicken, which was really good. There are many other items on their extensive menu that I want to try, and why haven't I had the cheesecake the last two times I've come?? So good!"
Martin G.,"South San Francisco, United States",307,198,17,3.0,3/6/2010,"The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time you will really wait is when paying the bill. But I think they do that on purpose the more you wait the more time you have time for your food to digest then you get hungry and get a slice of Cheesecake!! haha We love to sit out on the outside deck when the weather permits. The only thing about this place that may keep us from going all the time is the calorie count did you know many of their signature plates have the highest calorie counts in the US!!"
Bee D.,"Vallejo, United States",386,541,1513,2.0,26/10/2008,"Ms T and I were high as a kite after seeing Hill Harper at Macy's (on the first floor). $130 later I was sporting his new watch, an autograph for my son and a smile which is still on my lips, we decided to go upstairs for some late lunch. Seems like a bunch of our other Harper fans decided to do the same. We waited 45 minutes, me on the outside deck and Ms T resting her trotters inside. We were seated on the terrace and waited a few for the waiter. Since we had waited so long, we knew what we wanted and placed our order right away. Ok, I'm just gonna cut to the chase: 1/ We didn't' get our bread and water until we got our drinks. Suggestion - When you have people waiting 45 minutes for a table, bring water and bread to the table right away, it would be appreciated! 2/ Keep track of when tables are seated, it is disconcerting to be seated before another table, yet have your waiter leave your table, hit theirs and then place the order.... remember, we were starving during that 45 minute wait. 3/ Our waiter wasn't as attentive as he could have been. He remained at the waiters station, coming and making rounds occasionally. We had to put our empty glasses at the edge of the table so that someone would notice that we needed refills - unacceptable. Most likely, nothing will change. Due to the location, the tourists and the ""name,"" people will keep coming..... most likely, not me.! My food was meh - Ms T enjoyed the worlds biggest burger, she had to cut it up to fit it in her mouth! (ha, ha)."
Britany F.,"San Francisco, United States",1,57,,4.0,2/8/2010,"I usually always bring friends visiting from out of town to this cheesecake factory because of the amazing view of union square from the top of Macy's.  It is usually pretty freezing at night in San Francisco, but there are heat lamps out on the patio that make it bearable with a jacket.  If you can' take the cold, the inside seating is nice.  The food and service are good--typical cheesecake factory.  The only problem is that on weekends the wait to be seated is super long. Like 2 hours. And, no, you cannot make reservations.  To alleviate our boredom, me and my guests usually head to the furniture area in Macy's to sit on the couches and talk until our buzzer buzzes.  Next time I think I might bring cards. Even though the people working there claim that the buzzer does not work outside of the building, that is a complete lie.  I took mine across the street and into another store and it worked just fine.  Also, last time I was there it was really busy.  My friend's pasta took a slightly long time coming out.  Because of this ""wait"" (of like ten extra minutes) the manager gave it to us for free (without us even asking).  It was a nice gesture."
Carolyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,66,1,5.0,30/5/2008,I really enjoyed eating here.  Despite the crowd we were served in a timely manner and I really like their salads. I even got to enjoy meeting the 3 people at the table next to me! All Cheesecake factories tend to be busy and noisy - I guess that seems to be consistent across the country as the Maryland one and the L.A. one was the same.
R S.,"Brooklyn, United States",13,224,12,2.0,30/1/2007,"oh how I hate you... you're like that ugly younger sister we locked in the closet and forgot we had. Or we wanted to forget about anyway. Thanks for the gum in my water... Thanks for the long wait, followed by any even longer wait to eat because our food wasn't prepared to the head chef's expectations... After waiting two hours you don't care, you'll eat anything, so please just bring the food out. Thanks for no refills and for not comping anything even after all said above. Your saving grace, you're a chain, and fortunately I have had better experiences at alternate locations."
Don H.,"Walnut Creek, United States",8,77,,2.0,8/4/2007,"Does anyone ever actually get to eat here? My girlfriend and I have been many times, often not at peak hours, and have never been told the wait would be less than 90 minutes. I know good food is a little scarce in Union Square, and this place falls more into the category of passable than good, but come on! 90 minute wait at 3pm? Don't even think about getting a drink while you wait, either. The bar area is more crowded than a Chinatown sidewalk.  The salmon firecracker rolls and the modest selection of steaks are all acceptable, but not worth the wait time."
Michael G.,"San Francisco, United States",5,15,4,4.0,17/5/2007,"I like this place. Where else can you enjoy a seemingly infinite assortment of cheesecake while enjoying a beautiful view a top of Union Square. I recently went there with my gal at 6pm on a Tuesday evening. The wait was about 30 seconds and we were offered our choice of immediate seating either indoors or out. We sat inside right next to the windows and basked in the afternoon sun while enjoying the tasty bread, generous entrees, and delicious cheesecake for desert. I have been there during regular dinner time and endured the long wait. However, I already knew what to expect. But I've also been there at 11pm to enjoy a late desert and didn't have to wait long. This review is also about the bitter naysayers in previous reviews. With such a poor attitude, maybe you were the ones who pissed off the waiters and received bad service as a result. Yes, there are large crowds of tourists, but what do you expect? It's on top of a Macy's in Union Square! Maybe you're just mad that you're favorite mom and pop joint that never has a wait and has a tiny menu won't ever be able to afford a sweet location like this one.  And if the portions are too big for you,  share with a friend!"
Ryan B.,"West Hollywood, United States",167,145,11,4.0,24/10/2007,"Food - GREAT! Waiters - Hot/Sexy Decor - Stunning Views - Spectacluar 2.5 hour wait for dinner on a wednesday? - PSYCOTIC! all and all a great place, IF you dont have to wait 1/2 the day to get a table... Can you say open a SECOND LOCATION... theres a million dollar idea that took no brains!"
Honor G.,"San Francisco, United States",130,74,,1.0,8/12/2007,"This Cheesecake factory has the best view among Cheesecake Factories.. but it also has a terrible wait, and really bad staff. 1-you have to wait for 1 hour at least to get seated. When you go up to the front desk and ask them if you're up, you get weird answers such as ""you haven't waited enough"" 2-in SF, it gets cold at night. The outdoor seating is very nice. But the heaters are not properly placed. We were too far away from the heaters and the table behind us was too close to the heater. So we wanted it on and they wanted it off. The waiter could not figure out a solution for it, which is not cool. We froze half the meal until the other table left.  They need more wait staff it feels like. and they need to be more efficient at seating people. After the 1 hour wait, they gave us a 4 person table for only 2 people, so some other poor people kept waiting.  I think they also need to expand to a second floor or something. It's a good location for a Cheesecake factory for sure. The view of Union Square is quite nice. But I will never go back here again."
Angela L.,"San Francisco, United States",47,997,621,4.0,17/12/2007,"FOOD: 1.) Rigotoni pasta = With tomato sauce with pancetta, it was good but not super great or anything. 2.) Hitachi steak was really good, the special sauce was yummy, and the meat was cooked to a slight crisp around but very tender in the center. 3.) Rasberry lemon cheesecake = Very yummy. 4.) Strawberry lemonade = Normal, maybe could've used a little sugar. 5.) Apple cider = It wasn't SPARKLING apple cider. =( Poo. SERVICE: One hostess was really nice, the other was seemed annoyed at the busyness. They should make it clear where to stand in line to talk to the hostesses, because it was unfair how some people were attended first, while others were waiting longer. The wait can be terrible if it's a weekend and during Christmas time. Our waitress was nice and genuine, and recommended some good food! ATMOSPHERE:  Romantic = On the 7th floor of Macy's, with patio seating and a view of the Christmas tree in Union Square. Very nice interior decoration, reminds me of the ornate Las Vegas decor. They had high ceilings with murals on it, there were swirl patterns everywhere, roman columns, dim lighting, candles on the tables, the patio could've used more heat lamps."
Daneca V.,"Daly City, United States",35,55,,3.0,20/12/2007,"Just got back from my Christmas dinner with a small group of friends, and first off, yes they have a notorious wait. You want a table for 4 at 8 in the evening? You better not be in a rush and you better have money left over to pay for parking at the end of the day. Food wise, their huge portions are always tasty, the service is really attentive -even on a busy Wednesday night, a week from Christmas- and they've got a page and half for just cheesecake alone. I strongly recommend the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Fried Mac and Cheese. Mmm. Ooh and for the long waits, the home furnishings floor is just an escalator ride down so lounge on some of the couches while you wait, I promise the sales people leave you alone if you just leave your pager out."
Bruce W.,"San Francisco, United States",56,160,10,2.0,10/9/2009,"So you take the elevator up and u see a mass of people, you spot the counter and they tell you to wait an hour or two, So you look for a place to sit, nope the seats are already taken, mind you its only enough seating for one group. So finally your pager goes off, you go back to the counter and you wait a while longer. Finally in a shining white uniform comes the waiter/waitress. You are taken to your table and given the menu,  You try to read it but it take a while for your eyes to adjust since apparently you are now sitting in a dimly lit cave. So what did I have? well being here once before and being disgusted I decided to make it easy for them. Meatloaf, I have to say it was pretty good, even the waiter was attentive, but the atmosphere? No thanks Id rather go to hmmm Claim Jumpers or Elephant bar. Nice Try though."
Naomi h.,"San Jose, United States",10,65,,4.0,16/2/2009,I love their cheese cake! so smooth and taste good... but this restaurant many ppl there on weekend.. I can't even find any seat and no feeling to wait.... So I go there only just ordered cheese cake to go...
Jocelyn C.,"Alameda, United States",168,416,404,3.0,17/10/2011,"I wished I gave this 4-5 stars after a few times being here.  Service really sucks when trying to dine more than 10 people.  They don't even care if you get to sit together or not.  I mean, people love to go here cuz its known for their cheese cake and people have parties & have dinner here & then after go to the club or lounge.  This is why they should have reservations, cuz people have PARTIES! Its too crowded at this place, cuz its the SAN FRANCISCO LOCATION; more reason to be able to do reservations.  I've been to the Santa Clara location once & that really gave me a great impression of the place, plus it as parking lot that is free.  Also, YOU CAN MAKE RESERVATIONS! LOL  I can't stress it enough that this place needs some work to do.  The only good thing I will say about the San FrancIsco location is that the food is great & price is reasonable.  Also, the look of the place iS nice & its connected to the mall."
