Caroline J.,"San Francisco, United States",1343,192,157,3.0,26/10/2008,"Going out to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco is like visiting Italy and choosing to go to a Mc Donalds. With so many unique and delicious dining options in San Francisco, WHY would you choose to go to the same Cheesecake factory you could find in Sacramento, Chicago, or NYC? I don't understand why people settle for this restaurant and it's generic chain food in a city famous for it's culinary delights. I encourage you to leave the chain restaurants for boring road trips and enjoy the experience of dining in a world class city!"
Ali H.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,15,,5.0,9/3/2010,"If you go here there is only one thing to order... HIBACHI STEAK If you get any other meal and are not completley satisfied I have 4 words for you... I told you so We went to SF and ate here for dinner and had an exquisit Hibachi steak meal. We saw that the next table order some delicious looking pasta so decided to come back for lunch in a couple of days. Two days later we ordered the ""lunch size"" (it was enough to feed a small family!) fettuccine  chicken with sun dried tomatoes and the lunch size bbq chicken avocado salad which I decided to order after walking past a table that had ordered it. I have 4 words for myself...I told you so...why mess with a good thing?? Both the pasta and salad looked WAY better than it actually tasted. I could have had heaven in my mouth and ordered the hibachi steak again but noooooo, we decided to try something new...don't do it I tell you!! Just stick with the steak!!! You can thank me later. Your welcome!"
Kevin A.,"San Bruno, United States",42,45,73,3.0,27/9/2009,"so i went there with my girlfriend the first time. i knew it was going to be packed which it was. So we got there and were told to wait for 80 minutes which was dreadful but we did. there was so many people, and not enough room to sit. But we waited in total of 80 minutes because i wanted to eat there it was my first time. We were seated, took are order and ate some good food.food was served like in 12 minutes.  My girlfriend had some food that she wanted to take and i told the waiter if i can get it to go and  she said no problem and then she throw it away. i was like are you serious so i was thinking this is coming out of her tip and it did. then we ordered desert which took longer to get then getting the food.  i was disappointed it the waiter.  I know its busy but make sure you mean what you say (waiters). i mite not go to this place for a long time maybe for there BOMB cheese cakes"
Jo Z.,"San Francisco, United States",18,42,4,2.0,5/1/2009,"OMG! don't bother going to this place it's over rated, its super crowded all the time and the host are rude! food is nothing exceptional i'd rather go to TGIF..i think the only good thing i ever had here was the lunch special which is pizza and salad...and the chocolate mousse cheesecake..thats it!"
Josh M.,"San Francisco, United States",37,55,,3.0,8/12/2009,"Cheesecake factory has been around for awhile now. I've been to a ton,and the SF location is the best out of all of them. On a warm summer night, try to get a outdoor seat, it's an experience.  I only come here when I have visitors coming from out of town since they usually want to be downtown. It's a great view and experience for them.  On top of the view, the food isn't half bad. If I'm hosting a group, I don't want bad food. I also don't want to break the bank for my travelers or myself. Cheesecake offers a good variety of food for a good price. The cheesecake is okay here, plenty of other places in the city do it better though. Also, try the smoothies, they are yummy! These guys lose a star for the long waits and sometimes shoddy service."
Roger C.,"San Francisco, United States",16,23,,5.0,15/7/2007,"Cheesecake factory is my favorite casual place to eat. You spend at least 15 minutes just looking through the menu because they have everything. Their service is always really good no matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to. The food is very good and if you dont like it, just say so and they'll give you something else. They are really nice. Yup, there is always a wait, but its worth it. What to order? Everything is good even their Factory Nachos appetizer. I just dont know how they can make something as simple as nachos so good. Anyways, I highly recommend ordering the Thai lettuce wraps, miso salmon, or the Pasta Da Vinci. Very impressed with the level of service I receive everytime I go there. Restaurants with good service is hard to come by these days."
Rico R.,"Silver Spring, United States",16,146,44,2.0,9/1/2012,"San Francisco restaurant with a New York attitude, aside from our waiter, everyone had an attitude, even the manager. Food took for ever; unorganized and unfriendly staff. Food was good but it took forever. After waiting for about 20 minutes, the hostest gave our table to another couple that had just arrived. Don't recommend, so somewhere where they care for their customers."
Andrea C.,"Citrus Heights, United States",0,20,,3.0,10/4/2010,"I had been to the one in Sacramento just for some of that heavenly cheesecake desert but had never had any of their entrees. So I was in San Francisco with my friend the other weekend and we were hungry so we ventured on in (or should I say up?) I wasnt in the mood to be adventurous with some sketchy little restaurant. It was late and I was REALLY hungry. This place is located at one of the top floors of the Macy's Building in Union Sq. This place was super crowded. The hostess gave us a beeper and told us 15 minute wait. We chilled outside on the balcony until our beeper went off just 3 minutes later. Very impressive considering the size of the crowd. I was not expecting that at all. So yes, we were seated very quickly and I complimented the host on this. However, this place lives up to what everyone says. GREAT cheesecake, mediocre food.  My friend had a BBQ chicken salad and I settled on the chicken parmesean fettucini w/ sundried tomatoes after asking the waiter what he preferred because I was tired of staring at their huge menu(he had a bit of an attitude). I think he lied to me and just said anything to get me to order because something was a bit off in this pasta. Maybe it was my wacked out taste buds after quickly developing a 102 degree fever but something just wasnt right. It wasnt terrible and was a huge portion but it certainly was not worth $15.  So basically, this place has the case of style (if you want to call it that) with no substance. They put on a good show, but they dont put out."
Jenny T.,"San Francisco, United States",257,248,24,4.0,23/11/2009,"Pretty restaurant. We sat outside and enjoyed the view while we ate. It was a cold, windy night and the heat lamps didn't help much. Anyway I ordered the jambalaya that comes with noodles. It was so delicious! MMMM! :) The hostess was really nice, had a chat with her about makeup cuz she liked mine. The waitress was a bit slow and not too smiley but other than that, everything was perfect."
Jamie C.,"San Jose, United States",201,380,1,1.0,12/8/2008,"this is where high school kids go to when they're looking for a place to have dinner before prom. the only thing that separates this cheesecake factory from all the 1049832085208 cheesecake factories out there is the view of union square. the problem is, however, is that it gets old really fast. you'll have to forgive me for my bias, but after dining with a 30th-story view of new york city and a 360-degree view of seattle, this is some pussy shit."
Jason Y.,"San Francisco, United States",480,124,,3.0,29/8/2009,"This place can really be hit or miss at times. I use to always come here to have my monthly business meetings as i found the location simple and easy. The one thing I was surprised about however was what seemed like an unbearable wait time to get seats. It is somewhat understandable as Cheesecake Factory is located right in the heart of Union Square in downtown San Francisco. I always prefer taking an outdoor seat because I like to look at what the city has to offer in it's amazing background. The restaurant itself is actually quite small usually having long wait lines that form. The bar area is a nice place to sit and unwind as your waiting for your table and a pager is given to you so you know when to come back just in case like you feel the itch to shop at Macy's just located downstairs. The food however can be be described as pricey. When I came here in the past I always enjoyed how I felt like I was getting a good deal but as the years went by, it felt like prices were going up and portions getting smaller. Since I am a huge pasta fan it is only natural that I order the chicken fettucini alfredo along with sun dried tomatoes and each time I feel that it tastes different. On one hand it can be perfect, another time it could be too greasy, another time it could have no taste at all. What I'm trying to say is that it's hard to build consistency here. If I were to order a medium rare burger here every week I would expect the same thing every time. But this is not the case. Maybe it's because they are so overwhelmed with customers and orders I will never know but I feel that there are many other places that I can go to that will ofter me the same things at a better price and better consistency."
summer k.,"San Diego, United States",2,74,,4.0,24/8/2009,"Ah, The Cheesecake Factory. I really like this place. It's one of the few chain restaurants that actually has good food. The decor is nice - it's interesting, contemporary, and at the same time comfortable. But if you're at this location you really should sit outside on the balcony. You won't be giving yourself the full experience if you don't. I only sit inside if I'm with a group that's too large for the outdoor tables. Service isn't always the best; it's okay to good. It can get pretty busy, especially on summer weekends. Sorry, no reservations. In my experience, the wait can be anywhere from five minutes to over an hour. Usually it's been twenty minutes or under though. People seem to like to complain about the tourists here, but so what if there are tourists?? It's San Francisco! Union Square, no less. Get over yourself. If you really hate tourists that much then you probably shouldn't be in SF. Personally, I like coming and hearing all the different languages. People also seem to write it off because it's a chain and they're just too cool for chain restaurants. Again, get over yourself. Really, is your wait THAT long? I don't know who you're pissing off to have it drag out like that 'cause when I come, it's like fifteen minutes.  I like that their menu offers so many choices. Pretty much everything at The Cheesecake Factory comes in huge portions. It's a good value; you get one and a half meals out of one dish. I'd recommend their chicken dishes though, they probably do that the best. The chicken madeira and chicken marsala are superbly delicious. Sometimes I want to try their steak, but i know that at their portions that's a bad idea for me - I'll probably end up eating until I can't walk. I tried the small plates menu....my pizette and stuffed mushrooms were both really good. If you're looking to make a meal out of small plates, that wasn't quite enough to fill me up. A third plate probably would've done the trick (I just had some of my friend's leftovers instead). Dishes are not all that cheap considering they're small plates, $4-$7. You can get decent cheesecake at a lot of places, but theirs is indescribable. Oh so delectable, but also oh so pricey. It's seven or eight bucks a slice these days. They give you ridiculous amounts of whipped cream that you're probably not going to eat. It's good, thick, yet melt-in-your-mouth light, whipped cream. But I wouldn't mind less whipped cream and spending less cash! The cheesecake tastes like heaven, and there are a bunch of flavors to choose from...white chocolate raspberry, Oreo, chocolate coconut, brownie sundae, chocolate mousse... Good food, lots of variety, large portions, beautiful view outside, and scrumptious cheesecake."
Po L.,"San Francisco, United States",144,627,1,4.0,27/1/2010,"If you have a large group with many different taste this place will be able to satisfy.  One thing good about The Cheesecake Factory is that they are very consistent on quality and taste.  The environment is clean with average service.  The portions are huge and will afford you another meal if you take it to go.  Avocado egg rolls are delicious and a must and of course, cheesecake to finish the meal.."
Queen E.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,3.0,26/1/2012,"Even though i like the food here, I feel like the portions are just way too big. I often never get to finish my entree. I suggested splitting with a friend. Because I get full, I don't even have the room to try one of their cheesecakes. This place is expensive so I suggest bringing some cash with you."
Danielle S.,"Crestview, United States",9,53,,4.0,8/1/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has some pretty damn good food, but expect to pay a pretty penny. Given the fact that it is in Union Square and at the top of Macy's, expect to wait a while. I don't think they take reservations, which I think is pretty silly considering how insanely busy they are. Their outdoor seating area is beautiful and the view is amazing, just be prepared to get a visit from a pigeon searching for food. All in all the food is good, and dessert is just as good, and the wait staff can be a hit and miss, but they are good for the most part."
Claudia M.,"Fort Shafter, United States",160,316,200,3.0,11/8/2009,I came here for my friend's birthday on a sunday afternoon and the place was packed. But the wait was only 30 minutes so it was normal for me. The waitress we had was very polite and friendly. I ordered the terriyaki with steamed rice plate. It was $15. Very pricy for a plate filled with rice with a small slab of terriyaki. I thought it was way overpriced for my plate. Overall I think the atmosphere and the waiter service is great but this place is just very pricy for small dishes.
jooz k.,"Pleasant Hill, United States",0,2,,1.0,22/8/2006,"I'd come here often, if... 1. the WAIT wasn't 3 hours 2. if the food comes out warm, instead of sitting in the kitchen,  3. if the waiters payed a little more attention to the people who  tip em.  basically, i bet if this place was privately owned, it would fail.  this place only does so good because of the name it self.  yes it is a pretty place to wine and dine, but otherwise, go save yourself your 60 bucks and take it elsewhere."
Joel D.,"San Francisco, United States",2,16,,3.0,4/3/2007,"Great place, great food, great drinks. The view is awesome, and the service is decent. VERY long wait to be seated though.  I have been there a countless amount of times, and have had actual full coarse meals there about 20 times. Out of them 20 times I absolutely loved each and every meal. Never had a problem with any of the food ever. And as for their name ""Cheese Cake"" - it is definitely wonderful there too. I like ORIGINAL cheesecake with strawberrys (like normal people do), I am not into that weird new invention cheesecake with chocolate, and just a bunch of stuff cheesecakes are not suppose to have on or in them. And well, my experience with their cheesecakes have been excellent. I have ordered whole cheesecakes there as well for home.. GREAT !!! I really don't know what some of these other reviewers are talking about, the place is very nice and if you are a TRUE S.F. O.G. you EITHER know the perfect times to go so its not such a ""tourist trap"" , or (like most of us) you just stay the hell out of the whole downtown area anyway and not complain about it. When its time to go out, its time to go out, period,,, deal with it. The view is exceptional for sure, very nice to drink alot, talk, and just enjoy it. 3 stars from me because it is great for all the reasons I stated above, BUT the wait is too long, and it is located right in the middle of polictical, demographic, trendy, fashion brainwashing downtown.... And for my patented ""Is It A Get Laid At The End Of The Night Place"" review --------- YES !! this one qualifies. So take some ladies there guys !! Hell 2 at a time if ya can !! lol"
Barron E.,"San Francisco, United States",26,20,,3.0,27/3/2007,"It really should be 2.5 stars, but I'm round up because I like going there for drinks on weekend afternoons when I'm in the area. The food is typical chain stuff, nothing really that good, nothing really that bad. I tend to think that Cheesecake factory is a bit overpriced though. There are plenty of places in the city that have much better food for the same price or less. I do have to give them a thumbs up on the mojitos, they are big and they have a decent amount of alcohol. I think this place is clearly going to draw mainly tourists, given its location. Its too bad because they'll eat here and miss out on some culinary masterpieces the city has to offer."
Bryan Z.,"Mountain View, United States",7,33,,4.0,9/11/2007,"We had a party of 11 on a Sunday and only had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. That may seem like a while but you're in a gigantic Macy's so there's no shortage of things to meander through. I've eaten at this chain maybe 3 times in my life. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake so any restaurant that uses that as it's main selling point isn't high up on my list of places to eat. But I was glad to eat here b/c I got to spend time with my family and catch up. I had the Jambalaya pasta that had chicken and shrimp in it. It was a little spicy but I put crushed red pepper on everything I eat and drown burritos in hot sauce, so my tastebuds are skewed towards heat. The portions were huge (I had leftovers for lunch the next day), the food was really good, and the waiters that we had were all good... except for the guy who may have been flirting with my little sister. He was lucky I didn't need a steak knife with my meal."
