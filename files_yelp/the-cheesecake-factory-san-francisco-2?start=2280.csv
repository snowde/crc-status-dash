Dean L.,"San Jose, United States",4,11,,1.0,5/2/2014,"My wife and I went there this past Saturday. We called to see if they took reservations and they didn't. We arrived at about 5:45PM and they told us we had a one hour and 25 minute wait!!! Yeah, why would they ever take reservations. The hoards of people waiting in the foyer were ridiculous. After finally getting seated, my wife went to use their restroom. She said it was flooded and there was pee all over the place - so bad that she had to straddle the toilet to go. I used the men's restroom after dinner and while it wasn't as bad, there was pee all over the seat and floor as well. Just pathetic. The service was good and our waiters seemed very attentive. However, I ordered a ceasar salad, one of the larger ones and when I got it, there was hardly any dressing on it and ""one"" crouton. If I wanted to order just a head of lettuce, I would have. My wife's salad had hardly any dressing on it as well. The steak I ordered was supposed to be cooked medium and it was so rare and undercooked, I had to poke it to see if it was still alive. I asked our waiter and they took it back to re-cook it. When they came back 15 minutes or so later, they forgot to return the knife and fork and I had to wait another 5+ minutes before I could get someone to get me a new one. I've eaten at the factory in San Jose a few times and everything has been fine. This is the last time I will ever step foot in the San Francisco C. Factory."
Paisley P.,"Newport Beach, United States",9,245,,2.0,23/11/2011,"Well, this was up and down. We were in a larger group, and we knew we were gonna have to wait a bit since we were a big group and coming on a Friday night, but they seated us somewhat quickly, except we were on the terrace outiside. It was May, and even with heaters, we were freeeeezzzzziiinnnggg. The service was pretty slow but we had a very nice waiter. The food was pretty good and the cheesecake was awesome. The menu overwhelms me with its endless high-calorie options. Would want to come back, but it better be inside and the service should be better."
arja r.,"San Jose, United States",19,10,5,4.0,17/4/2009,This is a great place to eat espically on a friday OR saturday night on the terrace. I love the eggplant sandwhich AND outragious chocolate cake. The steak diane is good but portions to small. The navajo taco is delicous as the pulled pork sandwhich.
Daniel H.,"San Francisco, United States",24,38,14,4.0,9/10/2011,"great food and service for inexpensive price, however there is always line takes anywheres from 15 to 60 minutes"
Pineapple C.,"Orinda, United States",1,28,17,3.0,22/2/2010,I went on valentines day and there was 2 1/2 hour wait!! I had to go down the street to get something to eat because I got so hungry waiting. I had people practically hovering over my table while they waited to be seated. So crowded people had to wait in dining areas. Not romantic at all! I could barely hear my boyfriend talk. Definately did not live up to they hype around it. Waiters nice but brought wrong foods. Just wish I went somewhere else!
Jeremy S.,"Pittsburgh, United States",380,520,43,3.0,6/7/2008,"Hadn't been to cheesecake factory for like 10 years, but SO was wishy-washy about what she wanted to have and we were in the area.  Obviously best things about this place are the view and the people watching.  Food is okay regular chain restaurant burgers and sandwiches and greasy fries.  Service is efficient.  Very big mistake:  we decided to split a piece of cheesecake... ugh!  don't do it!  we both instantly regretted it.  not that it was bad, but because it was so rich!  it took a few hours for the cheesecake coma to wear off..."
Steve G.,"Anaheim, United States",8,149,21,3.0,25/1/2009,"The wait, the wait, and did I mention the wait?  It is always packed here and on a weekend you can expect a 2-3 hour wait.  At least you can go down the escalator to the Macy's furniture section.  The food is just like any other Cheesecake Factory but comes with a nice view of Union Square."
Clementine D.,"San Francisco, United States",68,104,,3.0,30/11/2008,"I came here last week with my family, and it was busy as hell...but a party of nine people who came in after we did got seated first. I was sooo angry about that...we complained a couple of times and it literally too like about two hours and a half before we got seated. The managers were nice enough and apologized and offered 4-5 appetizers for free, which made up a lot...so in a way it was worth the wait, but still disappointing."
e w.,"San Francisco, United States",8,432,1,3.0,1/11/2009,"I am surprised by how satisfied I generally am with this place and how affordable it can be compared with other places in the city.  I have never had a bad time at any ChF let alone this one.  For a shameless chain, this is top notch!"
Michelle C.,"San Francisco, United States",1,34,12,5.0,8/4/2012,"Good inexpensive food. Been going there for years. The food is good, the appetizers are delicious! Hang with my girlfriends there it's a nice place to hangout and spend time and catch up"
James C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,164,3,3.0,29/1/2009,"Everything I've eaten here tastes great, but the wait is too long.  Also, the male waiters are better than the female ones.  The female ones seem fake, while the male ones seem authentic.  I think that's the case in the real world too.  I'm sure most people agree with me."
Joseph S.,"Burlingame, United States",0,87,7,4.0,10/12/2009,"Great place to bring out of towners.  Park across the street in the underground parking beneath union square, go to the eighth floor to put your names in at the cheesecake factory, shop for an hour in Macy's or around Union Square, and get a table with a view overlooking the city.  The patio can be chilly, so make sure to bring your coats.  But the experience is great if you have tourist guests."
T C.,"San Diego, United States",0,47,,1.0,25/1/2011,"We had an awful time at the CF on Sunday night (sadly, a crappy end to a perfect day). The wait was not too bad, about 30 minutes. Things just got worse from there though. We were excited to sit outside, but the window was incredible dirty, obscuring the potentially beautiful view. It looked like a child rubbed his hands in molasses and then all over the window. I took my napkin and dipped it in my water but there was no way that window was getting clean. We asked to get moved 2 tables down. The waitress said okay, but was huffy as she moved our napkins and utensils over (including the nasty napkin that I had used to clean the window). Our next seat was much better, but there were still water spots all over the windows, distracting from our view. My fiance said his pulled pork sandwich was okay. I tried his fries and they were incredible old and stale tasting. I ordered the tempura ahi roll app (being not too hungry from brunch earlier). I had half a piece and had to swallow a ton of water to get it down. I thought it might be better with the dipping sauce, so I tried to other half, but it was not any better. I pushed it to the other side of the table, thinking I could get the waitress' attention and ask for something else. We sat there for 20 minutes while my fiance finished his meal and then sat some more. No waitress ever came anywhere near us. We were seen 2 times- once for our drink/food order and once to deliver our food (a busboy, not our server). We had to find another waitress to finally bring us our check, which took her another 8 minutes. We told her to take off the ahi roll and left no tip (it was our first time ever) and a note about the unacceptable service. The food at CF has never been good and truly the only thing worth getting is the cheesecake. I most certainly will never get it at this location again. (On a funny side note, my cousin who lives in Ventura, wrote on his facebook that night complaining about the poor food quality at CF)."

Blessed Z.,"Daly City, United States",50,38,61,5.0,26/11/2011,I love cheesecake factory! last night was amazing me and my girlfriend watches the christmas tree lighting at union square and decides to have dinnner here again! Our waited (we didnt catch his name) but he was amazing. I asked him what can get me full because I didnt eat the whole day and suggested the chicken little in my head I said that doesnt sound like its gonna make me full so I gave it a try. Once the order came to our table me   girlfriend.was shocked and amazed how much food it was on a huge plate! Very good suggestion! For dessert I got the red velvet cheesecake. But then my girlfriend was stuck in a dilemma between getting the macadamian something cheesevake or the tuxedo cheesecake. So our waitersaid both was very delicious and had told us that go with whatever your craving for but presentation wise I would go with the tuxedo cheese cake. And we went with that! Wow it was greeeeeeaaaatttttt & got us so full. It sucks cuz ee couldnt finish it so we decided to just give it to the homeless person who had asked for it. The thing I.dont like about this place is waiting in line for so long. And they dont do reservation. Sucks for the people that   wait 4hours just to be seated. Overall this place is amazing. Specially when you get the   the patio. Great view of the whole union square with a nice breeeze!
Nicole W.,"San Francisco, United States",1,31,,4.0,28/5/2007,"I went to this place today about an hour before they were going to close. We ordered: three appetizers, one main dish, and a slice of cheescake. And the waitress just smiled! When I ordered coke, she came out with COKE and TWO glasses of water! Now that's my kinde service Not to mention an adorable and cute Eastern European Russian guy seated my Father and me."
RickyRicardo J.,"San Jose, United States",2,9,,5.0,12/3/2012,"Love Ashely great customer service!!! She's great, awesome, fantastic!!!!!! He gets a 10 I will come back"
Julie C.,"Aurora, United States",139,74,7,2.0,9/6/2011,"I had only been to a Cheesecake factory a few times before moving to the city, but after coming to sf my friend who is in love with this place kept making us come here. This place is kind of love-hate for me. I really love the wheat bread they give you to start (so sweet and delicious) and I have to admit the cheesecakes are divine. But I'm not as impressed with the food. First off their menu seems to never end due to lots of ads cluttering the menu. This also makes it difficult to find a dish more than once while looking at the menu. I used to always get the four cheese pasta, but the last  time I had it they skimped out on the mozzarella and put too much ricotta for my liking. After that I usually tried different things. My problem was that most of the dishes are expensive, huge, heavy, and really unhealthy. By the time you have finished the ample bread and your entree, most likely you will be too stuffed to get  cheesecake. So i suggest getting something small and light and saving room for the delicious cheesecake. Another lesson learned, don't come here often it will burn a hole in your wallet and a will leave you needing to buy a looser pair of jeans at the macy's downstairs."
Lindsay S.,"Athens, United States",73,282,26,4.0,3/8/2008,I am in love with this particular Cheesecake Factory's location.  After riding the elevator up to the extravagantly decorated restaurant we enjoyed drinks (my favorite is the banana daquiri) and delcious food on the terrace overlooking Union Square.  The view is absolutely gorgeous and the food is great.  My favorite is the California Cheesesteak.  I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake so I can't review that part but I hear the Oreo cheesecake is to die for.
maria a.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,2.0,5/11/2008,if you like waiting an hour and half  to eat what tastes like frozen food and pay an overpriced dinner tab this is the place. there entrees aren't that good. a good place to have appetizers though. there drinks are good too. Oh! and yes there wide array of cheesecakes is great!!! there yummy! but the rest of the food here kinda sucks
