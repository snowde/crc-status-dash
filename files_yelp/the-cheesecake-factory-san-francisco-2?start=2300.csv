Chris R.,"Honolulu, United States",19,1057,81,4.0,16/7/2009,I believe this is the first time I've visited The Cheese Cake Factory.  We had a great time here.  My main course salad and ice tea was delicious.  My hubby also enjoyed his burger too.  We were seated very quickly.  The wait staff asked if we want to sit outside or inside.  We choose to get a table inside because it was cold.  We were sitting facing the window looking out their balcony and union square.  This place does get crowded since it's mostly a tourist hot spot settled above Macy's Women.
Stephanie J.,"Singapore, Singapore",136,280,11,3.0,31/5/2009,"The service was below par but the food was outstanding! Salmon rolls, calamari, spicy chicken sandwich and strawberry cheesecake were all to die for. Extremely large portions made the price worth it. And washing this all down with a vodka martini made for a great night indeed! I can't wait for warm weather so I can sit outside and overlook union square."
monica c.,"San Francisco, United States",25,76,,1.0,9/6/2008,"service was horrible.. im sorry.. but when every other table has bread sticks and water .. and we receive neither of the two until after our appetizer arrives.. it makes for a very angry monica.. our server.. her name was ashley.. (i remember..) was genuinely unenthusiastic.. rushed.. and unattentive..  remember youre job title?? S-E-R-V-E-R she was always around when she was not needed.. and never there when she was.. moving on to the food.. it was.. what shall i call it.. bad? my pasta was bland.. but on the menu it clearly stated ""our most popular pasta dish"" or something to that effect.. RIGHT.. i got overcooked pasta with not even close to enough sauce..  my friend's dish was not particularly fab either.. at least her pasta was cooked right.. but drenched in sauce.. GREAT!! give her too much and me barely anything.. THANKS!! our appetizer was alright.. the only thing that made it worth eating was the tartar sauce.. but i like tartar sauce a lot.. as well as deep fried foods.. so im hard to displease in that category.. another thing.. the front hosts/hostesses are super rude too.. with the ""get the freak out"" kind of attitude.. i tried on several occasions to grab their attention.. but they glanced at me and then walked away.. uhhh. WTF? cant you at least tap the person that has the time to help a PAYING CUSTOMER out?  we are your paychecks..  i seriously didnt want to leave tip.. but upon insistence of my friend.. we left a few measly dollars.."
Stephen W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,11,,5.0,26/2/2012,"I have gone here at least 20 times; that should say something! The food is consistently good, and I am full when I leave. The menu is huge with just about anything anyone could want to eat. I love the crab cakes, although they are one of the more expensive and smaller dishes. The atmosphere is good and the staff is professional. I will be back again!"
Valerie N.,"San Francisco, United States",27,612,41,3.0,17/9/2008,"their food are ook so i'll just give 3 star. i tried their cheesecakes, it's alright, i wouldn't say it's the best. the drinks are decent, but the raspberry and mango is pretty good. lastly, their pastas are mmmkay.  one thing i really hate is the long wait!"
tong t.,"Palo Alto, United States",23,178,2,3.0,10/8/2011,"i love cheesecake bc of their huge portion, salads and cheesecake. but its always so crowded. even when we ordered for pick up."
nima s.,"American Canyon, United States",0,39,,4.0,1/11/2011,"The wait list to get seated was soooooo long (45 minutes).   If it wasn't for the birthday dinner I would have left.  But I decided to walk around Macy's for a bit and check out the incredible view outside until our pager lit up.  I mentioned to the waiter that we were short on time to get to a show after the food and he sped things up a lot for us which was awesome.  The warm bread to start things off was nice and soft.  The bang-bang chicken and shrimp Thai dish was really yummy and flavorful.  The cheesecake was not as special.  Just plain ol cheesecake like every other place.  Our waiter did a great job and made our experience here good.  Wasn't as pricey as I expected.  The view if you sit outside can be worth the long wait.  The ""No reservations for nighttime"" should be changed."
Kristin Y.,"Brooklyn, United States",163,275,1,4.0,19/7/2008,"i give the cheese four stars for food.... service can tend to be hit or miss; but the food always pleases me! went for lunch on friday and was thinking that since it was going to be a table for five we would have a 30 minute wait! HAZAH...they were able to sit us in a nice big booth in the back immediately. i ended up gorging myself on pot stickers, quesadilla and then some apple turtle somethin somethin cheesecake! i had originally wanted the tres leche, but they were out. no worries i was still able to inhale my cheesecake regardless. uhhh... i should have asked my work husband to carry me..i mean roll me out. the only thing about the cheese is that it is no in and out quickly endeavour. we sat down at 12; walked out at 2. lucky for me i had taken the rest of the day off to go shopping, but my friends had to go back to work. suckas! :p"
Ford P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,4.0,21/2/2012,"The cheesecake factory is always a safe bet to bring people, it is not very exciting but it has a huge menu that anyone could find something they like in. The best with the S.F. restaurant (and one of the main reasons that I come back) is the location, to sit outside on the veranda with the city skyline outside is always a nice feeling, so the 4 stars is mostly for the location even though as I said nothing is wrong with the food..just not so exciting."
Richard C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,84,,4.0,28/10/2009,"I've been here a good amount of times and I've never been disappointed. Now, I know, a lot of people complain about the wait and it is a tad bit ridiculous since it is usually 40+ minutes but then again, I can't fault them for having good business. The two things I do remember getting here is the angel hair pasta with shrimp and the jambalaya pasta, both were very good. The jambalaya pasta had the shrimp overcooked though but I'm assuming they cook it with the chicken so I can let it slide, besides, the pasta is done perfectly and I could have just eaten that and nothing else. My boyfriend got the steak and chicken combo and he liked his chicken but he felt his steak was a bit overcooked at some parts. We ended the meal with cheesecake (who didn't see that one coming?). He got the 30th anniversary cheesecake which is essentially mousse, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and whatever else layered onto it, it was a bit too rich for my taste. I went with the dutch apple caramel struesel and it was very good, I had no complaints about it except I was already so overstuffed with my pasta that I couldn't finish it (makes me want to cry a little now because it was so good). It's not some place that I can afford to come to everyday but every now and then isn't so bad. The wait is just terrible though so just try to keep that in mind when you come here."
Colin P.,"San Francisco, United States",27,597,43,3.0,14/2/2010,Place was packed for Valentine's Day dinner--3-hour wait.  Great cheesecakes.
Jennifer P.,"San Francisco, United States",82,23,16,4.0,17/1/2011,"I like this place. I love how it is on the top floor and you can see then view from the outside patio through the macy's sign.. the service is always great every time I go there. The food is always consistent so it could never really go wrong. But One thing i hate about this place is the waiting time. Me,and friends come here a lot but we would have to wait 30mins to 1hr to be seated. There are limited seats and wainting area while we wait and it is always crowded everytime i go. When i get seated i always order appitizers and drinks. Pina Coladas are so good. you can't even taste one bit of the rum in the drink. it will creep on you. for raw fish lovers, try the ahi tartare (raw tuna on top of avocado with some kind of sauce with tortilla chip. sounds wierd but so good. now on to the entree, i would recommend people to try steak Diane or chicken teriyaki. For dessert, try red velvet cake or white chocolate resberry truffle cheesecake. really really indulging."
Morgan C.,"San Francisco, United States",6,14,,1.0,28/7/2008,"Mind blowing food, unbelievable ambiance and a view that is nothing short of spectacular. However, I forgot to try the Cheesecake... at a place called (hello) THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. I would never go here again."
Kevin K.,"Oakland, United States",0,17,,3.0,5/12/2009,"This is the place to go when you have many people with all different tastes.  The food is not the best, but you will never complain about not having enough food.  When I come here with friends, I would say that the Thai Lettuce Wrap is what you should get to prevent a heart attack.  This place is crazy during the holidays so do come early to find a seat or get elbowed left and right or run get shoved away by the herds running out of the elevator."
Latricia S.,"San Francisco, United States",275,3,28,1.0,24/11/2013,"If there was a way to give a below 1 rating or a minus 1 rating I would so give it to this place and their horrible customer service, on October 21st my husband and my daughter and I went there for an early dinner, we were sat in the patio, at first it was okay a bit brisk but then the wind really picked up and the outside heaters were not helping at all, we tried to brave it for as long as we could, but no cigar....A group of people across from us asked to be seated inside and they were PROMPTLY no questions asked nothing....several minutes later I asked if we could be seated inside and our waitperson asked the young man who was in charge of seating people, and we were told NO we had to wait like anyone else, now mind you we had already ordered our beverages and our appetizers and our main course, all of which were being prepared while all this was happening....To say the least I was outdone, outdone by the blatant treatment we received, so waiting in the lobby for an open table {AND BTW THERE WERE PLENTY OF OPEN TABLES} {OH AND DON'T FORGET THE OTHER GROUP THAT WAS OUTSIDE WITH US WAS SAT IMMEDIATELY}; so we thought how would that be sitting in the lobby eating our meal, or worst yet sitting in the lobby waiting for a table while our food is sitting cold....So we left in a huff, I complained the next day on Facebook got a big fat NO RESPONSE at all, complained again on Facebook got a big fat NO RESPONSE, I was directed finally to their ""complaint"" dept. I left several complaints there another big fat NO RESPONSE, finally I got a call from someone saying he was the Mgr. of this location, he left a msg. on my phone I called him back a few days later {even tho' he said he was going to cal me back and never did, and he said he was going to send a letter to my house and never did}; I left a msg. for him with details and a phone number for a call back and still a BIG FAT NO RESPONSE....!!! So back to Facebook I go to complain for the final time, and STILL NOTHING, so this leads me to believe only one thing this facility DOESN'T CARE HOW THEIR EMPLOYEES TREATS THEIR PAYING CUSTOMERS NOR DO THEY CARE HOW THEIR CUSTOMERS FEEL ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AT THEIR RESTAURANTS...With that said my family and I will never ever dine again at any Cheesecake Factory location, my friends have joined my bandwagon and they stand in solidarity with me in not patronizing this particular location....This was the worst experience ever....!!!"
Jacob H.,"Salinas, United States",110,188,1,3.0,22/11/2011,"If it wasn't for this place being on the top of Macy's I wouldve hated it... The food is ok, the spiked shake was amazing... The food was ok, and overpriced....  Views during our 2 hour wait.. AMAZING"
The Black Cat C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,171,145,2.0,1/8/2008,"What is so good about this place? Just because its fancy? street view? I only been once, in 2001. My 2 kids go there once in a while with my x. Both of them said there's nothing to eat, at least, nothing they like. The waiting is so ridiculous. I have friends who were from France, and they wanted to try and waited for over TWO hours!"
lynne z.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2009,"I used to like this place but after the last time I went there I don't think I will ever go back.  On Mother's Day I decided to buy a cheesecake since this place has great desserts.  It's not a good idea to go here during nights or weekends or special days.  The wait time is just CRAZY!  This is SF. You will find many good places to eat besides THIS place.  Anyhow, I placed an order for a whole cake and waited, & waited, & waaaaaiiiitttteeed! I waited way to long and I needed to meet with my family at a reserved dinner place.   I was so upset because not only did people before me get their orders really quick, I ordered 2 different flavors that would make up 1 whole cake.  I don't understand what's so difficult!  Those things are just sitting there for display. I saw people leave with 1 or 2 slices and I couldn't understand why they didn't give me my cake!  More than 15 minutes passed and I was just really feed up!  The servers behind the counter weren't doing anything special. The place was busy but they didn't look that much busier in the dessert area! Finally, I called for the manager and asked what the hold up was about?  I waited AGAIN.  They finally gave me a cake but they didn't have a bag.  Now I am a person that doesn't need a bag now and then but in this instance I had to walk several blocks with a heavy cake so I said that I would wait for a bag.  BIG MISTAKE!   I waited way to long for a bag and then thought WHY oh WHY am I waiting here when there are sooo many other places I can buy a cake that would treat their customers better!!!!  They couldn't find a bag?!!!! WHAT?  They have huge portions! The customers don't have bags to put their food in?  They even told me to go down to Macy's to ask for a bag!  Why didn't they ask Macy's for a bag? Wut!   I got a refund!  The manager wasn't even apologetic!?!  I walked to Bristol Farms in SF Centre and bought a really nice cake in their bakery!  This cake was so pretty my mom took numerous pictures with it.  They are really nice at this store too!  The lady behind the counter listened to me vent & seemed like she cared.  They put a nice ribbon on their box.  They didn't have a bag but they did have tape so that you could carry it!  Why didn't Cheesecake do that for me?  Eco-friendly and thoughtful!!!  NO, Bristol Farms is not Cheesecake Factory but unless their customer service changes I can't say I will be going there any time soon! : ("
Jerome H.,"San Francisco, United States",1,89,4,1.0,6/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places to go after a long day of shopping downtown. I always get teh Chiken Madeira and the Calamari.  We had the worst experience last night.  After shopping a few hours at Macys, the kids and I couldn't wait to have dinner.  It was a Friday night so a wait for the a table was roughly 45 min.  No worries, because its always busy on a Friday night.  We were seated at a booth and the waitress took our drink order and returned promptly with them and freshly baked bread.  The kids loved the bread, especially the rye (I think).  Our waitress had to go on break but she introduced us to another waiter who quickly took our food order.  30 min came by and still no food.  I noticed the waitstaff servicing our area diassapeared for a moment, otherwise I would have asked about our order. An hour came by and still no food! The kids were whiny, I was upset and finally our waitress stopped by to see how we were.  We told her we've been waiting over an hour and tells us that unfortunately most of the cook staff left!  Something bad apparently happend because the managers are now cooking and  she goes and checks the kitchen for our order.  The manager came by to apologize and explained that they were out of corn dogs (my kids order) and there was a miscommunication because they thought our order had already gone out.  Whatever the reason, it was unacceptable.  We did get our dish within 5 min. however by that time we were full from the bread (we asked for bread 4 times!) and the kids really had to leave by that point.  They comped the food that they did send out as well as a free slice of cheesecake however the total time there wasn't worth it.  We had to leave with grumpy kids and pay extra for the parking.  Unfortunately we happened to have gone on a very off night."
Angela K.,"Fullerton, United States",5,256,,3.0,20/6/2009,My group had to wait for over an hour for a table on a Friday night. I really like their chocolate bread as appetizer and their Ghirardeli cheesecake.
