Spencer N.,"Los Angeles, United States",114,200,5,3.0,1/5/2008,"This place isnt BAD, but it is totally not worth the hype. I dont find it fun waiting for up to 2hrs for a table at a chain restaurant. Not my style. On a special occasion, sure whatever. But not every day. The menu has a ton of options that span almost every ethnic region. Its a little over the top and frankly, not all that needed. Ive had hit or miss dining experiences here. The food is good...but nothing too special. The cheesecake is too sweet. Plus i have an issue paying that much for frozen cheesecake. pleasssse people. Ill come here if i have to , but its not my first choice"
Kira G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,4.0,30/7/2008,"I know, I know.  Chain restaurants aren't haute cuisine, but every once in awhile I love going there for some avocado rolls and cheesecake. And the portions are HUGE!"
Victoria B.,"Turlock, United States",7,121,9,4.0,24/2/2009,"If anything, go here for the view! It is simply beautiful ! It is always crowded though so be prepared for a wait. The food is delicious and the cheesecake scrumptious! It's a chain, but so what? Get over it and your non-chain visiting self and go the Cheesecake, really."
Susan J.,"Redwood City, United States",0,2,,1.0,29/12/2012,"I visited Cheesecake Factory on top of Macys yesterday with my daughter, for lunch, about 2pm..Crazy busy, but this is our annual tradition when shopping.   Managed to find some seats at the bar which we usually do so we don't have to wait.  The food was good, had our usual favorites, crab and artichoke dip, Thai lettuce wraps and something we had not had before, tuna tartare.  Don't know where we went wrong, maybe the tuna.....but about 8 hours later we were both very sick, nauseated and all the rest.  Now about 20 hours later still at it and now feverish.  Called this am to inform Cheesecake that something was bad or unclean or both....""I'm sorry to hear that, what did you eat....no one else has called""  Did not take my name or contact info, in case there is a larger issue.   Hmmm, methinks this is the last time for CF and we go there somewhat frequently, also Palo Alto and Seattle.  Contacting health department next."
Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, United States",512,1710,694,3.0,8/2/2009,"""huge portions, reliable cheesecake. love the tiramisu. ALWAYS busy and packed with people."""
Paul R.,"Baton Rouge, United States",18,134,25,4.0,25/4/2009,"You just can't go wrong with this place.  I went here with a very picky party, which included two vegans.  We found something for everyone here.  All of the pastas (to my knowledge, anyway) are excellent, especially the Louisiana pasta.  This particular restaurant also has a nice outdoor seating area, from which you can see Union Square and various other buildings.  Service is good, although sometimes servers act rather perfunctorily.  This is a very good place, and I highly recommend it.  Just be sure to get out and see the other fantastic restaurants in San Francisco (especially the noodle bowl shops!)."
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, United States",14,70,,4.0,27/5/2009,"this place was jammed on a Friday night....i love cheesecake factory. The fried calamari is really good and their Cesar salad also. i usually get the bistro shrimp pasta. My favorite. Its cooked with mushroom, shrimps, and a perfect sauce. Also, the steak diana is very good...the sauce is delicious. The price is good. The only thing that sucks is the place is a little bit dirty. But the service was great!."
Monte R.,"San Leandro, United States",379,67,22,4.0,21/4/2009,the food is great. The tiramisu cheesecake is the greatest i'd give that five stars! The only i thing i hate about this place is the wait time on holidays and occasions. if you're going here for valentines day i suggest you sign in then walk around Frisco then come back 1.5 hours later.
Ritsmomo L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,27,,1.0,9/12/2008,"I don't like this place!!! Hate to eat in chaotic place like this. Food is not good, not horrible. It is a typical touristy-family type of restaurant."
Jeannette L.,"San Francisco, United States",37,324,1,4.0,16/4/2009,"The calories at this place will kill you alone. I'm rating this place on the basis that if you need to find a place with dessert late at night (open til 12:30am on Friday - trust me this was useful), you can stop by here and pick up a cheesecake for that forgotten friend's birthday. Life saver... Otherwise, it tastes like every other Cheesecake factory. What do you expect?"
Alex F.,"Los Angeles, United States",25,54,4,4.0,18/4/2006,"So the food here is good. I can't really complain too much. Although my last visit I tried the nachos as an appetizer and wasn't impressed. However, I hate it here up to the point of getting seated. It's way to hectic and busy and everyone is in disarray. I don't know if I can really hold that against them though because they can only do what they can do....if everyone wants to eat there and they're packed, they must be doing something right. Just not the best place to go if you want quiet and calm. If you're hanging with some friends and don't mind waiting it's cool. I also personally don't like that they have so many options on the menu. It makes it hard to decide for me. But the positive is you have something for everyone, and like I said the food is good.  The staff is nice and honest. During my previous visit, I originally ordered the spinach dip as the appetizer and then my girlfriend and I decided to get the nachos too. The waiter honestly let us know that he suggests we go with one or the other because they are big. We followed his advice and he was right. Honesty is definitely a positive quality. Unfortunately, I've always gotten to stuffed to make it to the cheesecake, but I know my mom loves their cheesecake - she doesn't yelp, so you can count that as her review."
Drew T.,"Rocklin, United States",285,879,3018,4.0,2/3/2008,"Overpriced chain restaurant attracts yuppies from far and wide. as an aside, this location is perfect. if you sit outside, you can watch the ants in union square. mojitos are a dream here, but the veggie options are lacking."
Gregor G.,"San Francisco, United States",400,560,108,3.0,10/9/2007,"Is it odd going from Macy's furniture displays to noisy restaurant in one short escalator ride? Kinda. Does this chain rest on its laurels rather than blow you away with amazing food? Yep. BUT, just grab lunch on the outdoor roof patio on a clear, beautiful San Francisco day and not even the 'flying rats' that swoop by in hopes you'll drop a crust of bread will get on your nerves. We need more outdoor places to park it for food and drink, and like it or not, this is a decent one, kids."
Jessica V.,"San Francisco, United States",63,24,20,1.0,27/3/2008,"On top of horrible service, there was a huge dead moth in my bbq chicken salad. i will never go there again. bleh."
Roseanne W.,"San Francisco, United States",90,67,,1.0,29/12/2005,"The Cheesecake Factory is everything that is wrong with America. The disgustingly large portions, the rediculous waits, all of the hype. The food isn't even good (Although the thai steak salad is a good choice for a family of 4). It's the place that you take your big hair having, tracksuit wearing aunt from Milwakee if you have one. The food isn't horrible, but there is nothing on the menu that comes close to meriting the 2 hour wait and pushing and shoving from Jenny Craig rejects."
Ahnui Y.,"San Francisco, United States",103,69,,5.0,16/7/2007,"I will tell you what a good idea consists of. A lazy sunday, shopping for some jeans, china patterns, bras at Macy's, then going upstairs, doing a couple of shots of HYPNOTIQUE at the Cheesecake Factory, then spending $600 on pants."
Mimi G.,"San Francisco, United States",46,14,,1.0,23/8/2007,"the cheesecake factory doesn't even serve good cheesecake.  and that is only the beginning. dining here, if you live in san francisco, is like going to mc donald's when you're in paris.  and if you do, then you get what you deserve:  merde. any restaurant that gives you a beeper to notify you when your table is ready, is sincerely frightening and undeniably declasse. and a restaurant with a menu that is pages and pages and pages long is NOT serving anything fresh, trust me.  there is no way to keep a selection of food that expansive on hand unless it's all being kept in the freezer. the environment is a cacophony of too many people crammed into one space, plates and glasses crashing, and if my memory serves - which it might not because i've tried to erase the memory of my one experience here via electro-shock therapy - they also have a loud speaker/paging system.   shudder.  the horror. and, last, but certainly not least, the food is terrible.  IF you can call it food.  you certainly can call it terrible.   if anyone ever suggests 'dining' here ---- run, don't walk. do not waste your money, or two hours of your life, neither of which you will ever get back, and both of which you will assuredly regret wasting in this joint."
Brian C.,"Tucson, United States",0,62,,1.0,26/7/2011,"This place sucks, way slow, disorganized, skip and go some place else, When our name was called we where told to go wait by the pillar! Really this place is the worst.   Next waiter took other groups orders that where sat after us. It gets better and better. Ordered sweet corn fritters. Came not crisp but mushy.  Onion rings where crisp, good flavor. Chicken Roman, bland, pasta was hard, precooked, weird taste can't place it. At least the ice tea good."
Lindsay A.,"San Francisco, United States",92,203,7,2.0,13/1/2009,"I'm reluctant to review the Cheesecake Factory but have been pressured into doing so since I went there with some out of town visitors for some cheesecake. I don't actually mind eating at Cheesecake Factory's if I'm in a place that is all chain restaurants but since SF has such good food options it pains me a little to go here. Generally speaking their food is pretty good, but I'll just base this review on my experience for cheesecake yesterday.  Went there with my sis and her boyfriend since they had a hankering for some cheesecake (specifically from CF)... the place was pretty empty being about 4:30 on a Monday night in the middle of January. However, it still took them a while to give us an empty table so we opted to sit at the bar. None of the empty tables were cleaned off and were littered with old plates, food, etc. We sat down anyway hoping someone would come clean off our table. They cleaned off the table next to us first for some people that were about to sit down, ignoring the fact that we were sitting in filth. Finally someone came to clean it and brought us bread but no utensils, napkins or plates. Again, the people that sat down next to us were given propper utensils right away. grr. We were hungry and wanted to eat the bread so we were forced to act cavemanish and open a butter paket and dip the bread in it and eat it in from our hands.  Watresss takes FOREVER, finally brings us our drink order and allows us to order. Cake comes pretty quick, I just had a glass of wine and took a bite of each of their cheesecakes. Everything tasted pretty good. Again it took a while to get the check and a box to bring the remaining cheesecake home. We get the bill and she charged me for a more expensive glass of wine so had to wait while she  corrected it. Ugh.  Like I said, their food is good and reliable when I'm out of town - usually in Texas or somewhere else that only has chain restaurants. But my experience at the SF version really let me down service-wise, especially with the length of time it took to get the table cleaned in a dead restaurant."
sibani b.,"West Covina, United States",128,228,,4.0,8/8/2008,"On the top of the Macy's department store, this Cheesecake Factory location has outdoor seating that allows a view of Union Square (which is over-rated, but whatever) under heat lamps. It can get really windy in their outdoor section. They need more heat lamps, but it is too crowded to fit any more. The waits are terrible. They give pagers but they only work on the floor, so people coming out of the elevator that goes directly to the restaurant from the ground floor of Macy's are bombarded with peopleness as soon as they exit. They should offer to telephone people when their tables are ready so at least people can go one floor down and look at boring furniture in Macy's. Once, however, I went on a Sunday late afternoon and only had to wait 20 minutes. For me, that is an eternity; for Cheesecake Factory, that is a miracle. I've already talked about outdoor seating. Indoor seating is fine. The decor is pretty wannabe luxe but it totally works. Sometimes, the music is WAY too loud. I mean, it's Abercrombie loud, and I'm not old, so it really is loud. The last time I went, my hostess was fabulous. She was very bright and cheery. I told her it was the first time I was seated on the east side of the dining area. She welcomed me without a soupçon of patronization. It was great. The waiter was super-busy and I could see various tables of people being less than nice to him, but he was very diligent and had a cool name I can not remember. I could barely hear him say anything under the volume of music, but he was very patient and recommended a great Bellini. Mmm. The spinach dip is always a safe bet. The chicken Madeira, steak Diane and shrimp scampi were all extremely good. The shrimp was battered and fried and too tasty. Of course, the whole purpose of the Cheesecake Factory is to serve cheesecake. The cherry cheesecake is okay. I actually prefer the 6g carb cheesecake. It is yummy enough to satisfy my cheesecake craving but not sinful enough to make me eat the whole shebang. I can't give this place 5 stars because it does not give me the sense that I could develop a personal relationship with it. I like places that feel personal. This place just processes tourists."
