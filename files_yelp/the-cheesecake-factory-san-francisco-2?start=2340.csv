Mish A.,"Berkeley, United States",0,14,,1.0,2/5/2009,"What were we thinking? In a food town like San Francisco, there's no reason to eat here. Two words: gut bomb. Overrun with tourists, really high-energy waiters, and high school prom couples. So loud you can't hear across the table. A good rule of thumb may be: never eat at a place with the word ""factory"" in the name."
Ben R.,"San Francisco, United States",66,162,42,1.0,17/11/2006,"Your menu is an encyclopedia on culinary mediocrity. Your atmosphere is so far removed from surrounding San Francisco, that I feel like I'm on vacation in Southern California. Your servers brush people's food along the plants outside when squeezing through the small walkway, and don't do a thing about it. I know it's a bad sign when more than one person next to me returns their food and walks out (I can only imagine how many people are doing the same inside). I really wish you were better, because the location and idea seems pretty fun. Too bad everything you do ruins it, so bad I didn't even want to stay for Cheesecake. :(  If I want a view of the city while I eat, I'll just go to the Carnelian Room...or somewhere worth waiting ONE HOUR to be seated."
Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, United States",100,2101,2101,2.0,24/10/2005,"What is perfectly acceptable in a suburban mall is offensive in Union Square. The only explanation for its popularity is that, for too many tourists, familiarity breeds content."
Stewie G.,"San Francisco, United States",1,50,,3.0,12/9/2009,"This place and the food is pretty overrated.  I just don't get the dark, Egyptian-like decor either.  What does that have to do with cheesecakes? Always crowded, chaotic, long wait, and the food is ok but not all that great.  I always end up feeling really full and bloated afterwards, even though I didn't even eat that much, so there's no room left for cheesecake.  Eating here once a year is enough for me."
Jen C.,"Oakland, United States",52,101,2,3.0,28/4/2009,"Most of the time the service is good and the food is tasty.  I've been here several times and never really had a major complaint except for their takeout. It's really bad.  One time it took over forty minutes for my food to come out and the only thing the manager had to say was, ""it's definitely worth the wait!"" WTF??!!   The second time wasn't as long but they messed up the order.  I usually just come here if there is something I am craving or if I have friends on town that want to eat there.  Otherwise you get  what you expect from any chain restaurant."
Maggie C.,"Fullerton, United States",20,129,82,3.0,23/3/2009,"Overrated! Yeah the cheesecake is good, but is it worth the CRAZY wait? Nope, but I must add, I am in love with their farfalle with roasted garlic!"
Steve C.,"Manhattan, United States",4,260,2,5.0,25/4/2011,"What can I say? I'm a sucker for the cheesecake factory. The waits are ridiculous, but what are you gonna do? I like the chicken madeira. I order it every time. I always make a point to order gin martinis here, because they pour like 3 shots of gin into it (count for around 8 seconds). Note: one time they charged me only $9 for a hendrick's martini. I thought I was in heaven. Turns out the guy rang me up wrong. The most recent time I was there I noticed the bill was like $14 for a Hendrick's martini."
Christine M.,"Cerritos, United States",2,5,6,1.0,8/9/2009,"I've been to several other Cheesecake Factory location and have loved it - THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT! This is a bad place to go if you have a group of 5 or more!  We were originally a group of 11 but they said the wait was 1hr 45min for a group that size, so we split into 2 group (5&6) so that it would be only around 45min.  So the first half of our group got called within about 25min, fine, the rest of us should be next right? WRONG!  Our half waited another 25min!! WTH?!?! So I asked the girl at the desk why it was taking so long when half of our party was already seated, she just checked our pager number on the computer and said we had another 20min left to wait. ??? Several other groups of 5 got called and we were still waiting.  We checked again and she said 10min. ??? So finally the pager goes off and we still wait another 5-10min! 30min ago I was ready to leave, eat somewhere else and meet up later - why didn't I listen to myself!  Finally we get seated (our other half was finishing their meal already!)  Pleasant enough server.  So I got one of the specials - Salisbury Chopped Steak (with mashed poatoes and green beans).  We also got the Fried Mac&Cheese balls which was good but they should give more marinara sauce.  Ok, so Salisbury Steak was super salty! But I was hungry from waiting so I still ate it.  Refills were slow, especially after our server was switched to the night shift.  I did have my 2 yr old daughter with us - NO KIDS MENU! - but she got a kids size apple juice. When we asked for a refill of the apple juice, the server said she'd have to charge us for another one, ok fine - another kids drink right.  When I got the bill it said KIDS APPLE CIDER 1.95, COLD APPLE CIDER 3.50.  WTH?!?!  I had to change my daughter's diaper so I asked my hubby to see why they were charging a reg. size drink, why not just another kids drink? it was still a small size cup!  When I came back they told me that the server insisted it was right and she had told us there would be another charge.  HELLO! for a kids drink? why not just charge another kids drink then or at least give us a bigger glass? WHATEVER! I was so over the whole place already! While I was pushing the stroller out down the ramp (the place is full of steps) a busy boy mumbled under his breath ""wrong way mam"" WTH! OMG! So I answered back, ""Oh wow really, 'cuz obviously I don't work here and there's no sign.""  NEVER AGAIN!!! IT WILL RUIN YOUR DAY!!!  I was so upset by the whole thing! I had to make sure to do this review to save someone else from all the aggrivation!!"
Paula G.,"San Francisco, United States",6,29,1,4.0,16/7/2009,"I love going to The Cheesecake Factory! I think that the portions are a good size- I mean you get what you pay for!  There always is a wait, but it's never too bad. Whenever I go here, me and my friends always eat the bread! It's really good =)    But the cheesecakes they have are amazing! I love getting the oreo one. Also, there are so many different flavors of cheesecake to choose from!"
Carol C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,1.0,6/11/2009,"Too bad Yelp does not allow 0 or negative stars - this place deserves it. Didn't want to go here, but a friend had great nostalgia for the place. Sigh. Wait staff oozing attitude and unbelievably keystone-kops inefficient. Had reservations - but they allowed not one, not 2, but at least 7-10 other parties go AHEAD of us. We complained very politely at first, a bit less politely the second time . . . to no avail. We were given the brushoff and a stupid non-explanation that our table would be ready in a very, very short time. (Yeah, right.) Food was greasy, cold when it should have been hot (and vice versa) and the staff was equally greasy and cold. Bartenders were at least serviceable (where we finally ordered from, after the 15th party who came in with no reservations was, again, seated ahead of us), but looked like they were aching to sample their own wares. Even bar service, however, was abysmally slow. I mean, c'mon, you're 2 feet away from me and about the same distance from the kitchen. It still took a ridiculously long time to get our food (from order to arrival was at least 45 minutes). You're in SF. Stay away. Any hole in the wall will be infinitely better and better value for the money. People who give this a positive rating should have their taste buds removed, as they clearly aren't using them. And if you want big portions - well, y'know, they do have jumbo boxes of Top Ramen at the store. Save your money for a place worth patronizing."
Nikki c.,"Oakland, United States",338,1040,,2.0,6/7/2007,"The wait just is NOT worth in, especially in a city where there are so many other dining options.  I don't think I've been back here since I turned 21.  The best thing I can say about them is they are fairly accommodating of big parties.  The little buzzer thingys are handy.  One day I ended up shopping with a friend for about 45 mins while she was waiting for a table.  Ummmm, you could be halfway through your meal at a GOOD place by then."
Jerry L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,4.0,4/11/2011,"The CCF is something that never surprises you in a negative or positive way. However, the food is generally good and prices are all right. The CCF is a great general-purpose restaurant and the menu is very extensive."
Heather I.,"Spokane, United States",0,39,,4.0,29/8/2008,"Ok, so it's a chain restaurant, which I try to avoid in SF, but I love the location of this Cheesecake. It is fun sitting out on the balcony, even if it's a foggy night (the heat lamps work great). Perfect spot to take tourist friends, even if only for dessert. My favorites are Adam's peanut butter and the Oreo cheesecakes....yum! Also, their crispy chicken tenders are yummy. Expect quite a wait; never been there when it wasn't chaos."
Emily S.,"Stockton, United States",286,904,829,5.0,29/9/2006,"I friggin' love this place.  If we had one close by, I probably would be sick of it.  They offer beyond cheesecakes,  there is always a line and it is always good!  Not the line, of course!"
Robyn G.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,42,,5.0,25/8/2011,I have tried both the white chocolate & vanilla cheesecakes. Bother were delicious however I would definitely go back for the vanilla!
J H.,"Granite Bay, United States",0,65,13,5.0,20/5/2009,"Even though Cheescake factory is a chain restaurant, there is nothing like eating on the terrace eight floors up overlooking Union Square on a sunny day. Food is very good although with the size of their portions you might want to share. Maybe go for appetizers so you can have dessert."
Honey L.,"San Francisco, United States",57,130,,2.0,12/12/2006,"Slow everything.  We waited an hour for a table and then ate some mediocre food.  It was so loud we couldn't talk without yelling.  There was a nice server, but slow service.  Prices are decent for the amount of food.  After dealing with Christmas crowds I wasn't in the mood to deal with the drunk people yelling at the sports show on the tv.  I also saw a tourist from Arkansas spit a huge lugie off the balcony outside.  That's the crowd you'll be eating with at this place."
AimFee G.,"San Francisco, United States",15,15,,4.0,1/3/2009,"well, to start, this is our first review, so bear with us! it was busy as usual on a friday night. it took about 35 minues to get seated and there's nowhere to wait or sit so you have to stand. and theres also a line for the elevator. thats probably the worst part. other than that, the foods really good. the waiter was veryy very nice to us. they didn't forget anything we asked for. the bread and butter is hella good! and the snickers cheesecake is off the hook! i hella recommend that! the lightings very dim tho so you can barely read your menu. although it is simple, the chicken fettuchini is above average. the fried macaroni balls (in the appetizers) are pretty great too. and you should also try the ranch style burger.  so this is our first review with lots more to come!"
S A.,"Petaluma, United States",1,19,,3.0,19/10/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is either a hit or miss for me. You really never know what you are going to get service wise. I also hate that there is always an outrageous wait as I refuse to wait over thirty minutes at any restaurant. The good thing is that the food is always good, as is there cheesecake and espresso drinks. I had a caramel macchiato last time I was there and was pleasantly surprised. If you don't mind waiting, the mediocre service or the annoying tourists, then check it out. Or go during the week before 5."
brenda b.,"San Lorenzo, United States",81,308,9,5.0,4/5/2006,"Since it is called the Cheesecake Factory, and they do offer a variety of different Cheesecake, they get 5 stars for delivering what they intend.  I like the Godiva cheesecake, and the fact that offer whipped cream on the side.  That said, I wouldn't recommend getting one of those annoying vibrating pagers that alert you to get back in line to return said pager so that you could wait to be served by a waiter who would rather not serve you.  Just walk over to the cheesecake counter, place your order, even during the busy times, it should take them no longer than 10 minutes, and LEAVE!!  The entrees may be SUPERSIZED, but so is their prices.  Run out with your cheesecake and dignity intact.  Because after you pay for dinner, beverages and dessert, plus tip, you sure won't feel like you got a good deal.  You'll feel like you've been had."
