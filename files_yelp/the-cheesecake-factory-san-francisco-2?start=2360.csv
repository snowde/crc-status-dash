Ken W.,"Richmond, United States",43,136,3,2.0,16/1/2009,"After writing cheesecake on their website, one of their customer service reps called me and asked me about my experience.  Afterwards, he explained that the problem would be addressed and I should expect a little something in the mail as an apology.  I received a $20 gift card from cheesecake.  I'm glad they have such a huge emphasis on trying to better their service."
Alyssa W.,"Alameda, United States",48,211,,3.0,21/4/2008,"The cheesecake factory is one of my guilty pleasures.  Shh, don't tell anyone.  It's probably the best chain restaurant I can think of!  The food is good (nothing amazing), i don't even love cheesecake, the waits are too long, and the service is usually average.  But for some reason I end up eating here 2 - 3 times a year!  Probably because my mom and I love their iced tea so much so we stop by whenever she comes to visit..."
David O.,"Foster City, United States",15,205,727,4.0,12/12/2010,"I would say the Cheesecake factory has inexperienced to moderately experienced wait staff & management, based on the other reviews and my experience for this union square location  they seam lean more on the inexperienced side. When I arrived I noticed most of the beautiful marble floors were quite greasy / slippery most likely from dropping dishes throughout the day and not taking the time to clean it up properly. When we arrived we were told there would be a 45 minute wait, so we got a glass of champagne and went outside to look an the view of Union Square with all of the holiday decorations and lights. We did get our table in the anticipated time, for us the waiters were good and food as well however we did wait longer than usual for the dinner to arrive but the food was tasty. Our table had a very nice view of the dining room and the skyline so for us the over all experience was quite positive."
Anna S.,"San Francisco, United States",52,183,13,4.0,11/9/2006,"Other than In N Out, this is the only chain restaurant I will eat at in San Fran. And the reason I do it (besides the desserts) is because of the outstanding rooftop deck. I love to have lunch here on a warm sunny day, it's really perfect. Food is good too, I don't care what the snobby's say. HUGE portions though - always share a dish with a friend unless you are super hungry."
Jenn K.,"San Diego, United States",80,500,8,4.0,11/7/2008,"I really hate to rate chains (or eat at them generally), but I will this time to comment on the fact that when you have out-of-town guests, this is a great lunch spot if you sit outside.  You get a great city view, you can take your guests around Union Square afterward, and the food isn't so bad for lunch, if only a bit predictable.  The view though, that's worth it."
derrick i.,"Vacaville, United States",268,141,5,4.0,3/7/2008,"first off, i just want to explain that this is a HIGH 4 starts. this place has never let me down. lets start with the environment.  it seems almost swanky in there, a top shelf kinda place.  you'd almost feel out of place in ragged street clothes amongst the twenty-somethings and up in their fancy date gear, it is that kind of environment; but fear not, there are those people here too... along with guys in their giants gear.  and touristy looking outfits.   and decked out pretentious high schoolers, the gangs all here folks, don't feel the need to impress anyone... but what kind of review would this be if i weren't going to talk about the main reason i came... the BAR.  good drinks.  kinda pricy tho, but i've receive many a buzz from this place... okay, the FOOD... is GOOD.  the quality of food is definitely worthy of the near-fancy atmosphere, and you get good sized portions too.  don't get me wrong tho, you're payin' for it because it's is not cheap, but i wouldn't say it was expensive either.  you're payin' for that quality, and it's COMPLETELY worth it.   my wife ordered a soup and half salad for like $9... it came on an oblong platter the size of a serving platter, and had a gigantic bowl i the middle.  and it was GOOOOOOOD.   i place a high recommendation on this place."
Alexander F.,"San Francisco, United States",63,21,,1.0,11/8/2012,"While my review is a little skewed and in-complete, my limited experience at the Cheescake Factory in Macy's in San Francisco is bar far the definition of faux pas when in regards to service. To begin, there was no security guard or doorman at front entrance, but a homeless man (while very nice) opened the door for us. Upon entering the rustle and bustle of the restaurant did intrigue me, feeling like a 1940's L.A Club. The view of the Union Square is fantastic from that angle. Our party of 10 was informed of a wait for about 45 minutes, to which we simply went to the bar and got some beers. Aside from being a tad overcrowded, the fresh Pyrimd ale and Stella Atrois was refreshing and worth it. Luckily our buzzer went of informing us that our table was ready. However, seating didn't occur for about 15 minutes later. While the rest of our party attempted to join us, we had a good look at the menu (I read it 5 times to which I might add their selection is diverse and of great quality from the smell). However, we stayed seated for 35 minutes without a waiter one time come up to us and ask if we wished to start with something. Even after I went and complained to the shift coordinator about the service, we still waited for another 5-10 minutes without anyone to come and service us. At that point I was so appalled I simply left establishment with my party. While the food might have been great I was not able to try it because the service was so terrible. When dealing with any type of business, the most important thing is the service. This is why I have chosen to give this a 1/5, not for the content on the menu. If new management is set in place, I will consider going there again, until then, there are plenty of amazing other restaurants in the Union Square area (with better service)."
Audrey K.,"Fremont, United States",47,41,,3.0,6/1/2009,"It is what it is: the restaurant on top of Macys. You'll probably have to wait awhile so don't expect a table right away. I think it's hilarious how hard on this place people are. It was pretty good, I mean it's no fine dining but they do a good job. The service here was really great. I love it when the server is cool and can take a joke. I can get a little sarcastic now and then and it really blows when they just dont get it. The people who served us here were a lot of fun. The avocado eggroll was pretty good and the pasta I had was not bad. I'm not a huge fan of the sugary drinks, but if you are this is your place because they've got a lot of them. The wine though was a good pick. The view up there is totally what makes it. I don't think i'd come if it were on the ground floor. Being outside up there makes this a fun place to eat!"
Denny R.,"Petaluma, United States",45,188,,5.0,20/5/2008,Great food and large portions.  It has a huge menu but I always have the same thing..the bacon and prawn club...best sandwich ever!  They make a mean mojito as well :-)  Just expect a long wait...
Steven K.,"Brooklyn, United States",24,243,,3.0,21/3/2009,"Despite our terrible service the food and setting were not half bad.  My friend and I stopped here for a quick lunch and sat outside on the terrace.  The view was beautiful.  We both ate the seared ahi tuna salad and had a bottle of wine, which our waitress said she was not skilled with opening and actually set the bottle on our table to open it (very bad).  Regardless, you get what you get-the Cheesecake Factory is not and never will be a five-star restaurant you go to for unique and new food-it is what it is.  The menu is too big, the portions the same, the desserts are common and also over-sized, the service lacking, but the prices match the quality and expectations too & for a quick lunch and a cheap bottle of wine in the center of the city it works."
Ryan C.,"Oakland, United States",25,156,,2.0,11/7/2008,Ridiculously long wait for sub-standard food.
George C.,"South Rockwood, United States",0,2,,1.0,27/9/2013,"We have eaten at Chessecake factories throughout the country and were looking forward to this one.  We arrived on a Friday morning just after 11:15AM and it was virtually empty.  The host asked if we would like to eat inside or on the terrace.  We chose the terrace as it was a beautiful day.  We were told to stand off to the side and we would be seated in 5 minutes.  After a couple minutes wait we were escorted to the first table immediately as you enter the terrace.  We asked for another table so we wouldn't have everyone entering passing by our table.  We were shown the next table over.  We then asked to be seated at a table on the outside of the terrace (keep in mind the restaurant was virtually empty), only to be told the server would not be there to serve that section for another 10 minutes.  We said that would be OK, but when the host was told we wanted to wait for another table we were told it would be over half an hour, in spite of it being empty.  We decided it just wasn't worth the hassle and went elsewhere.  Would not recommend based on their haughty and condescending attitude."
Manton R.,"Santa Clara, United States",453,237,10,2.0,3/5/2008,"If you're reading me, you're probably considering going to the Cheesecake Factory.  Well, here's my two cents.  If you want to wait about 1.5 hours to get seated, go for it.  The food is good but not spectacular.  My only gripe with Cheesecake Factory is the long wait.  Oh, even if you go on a Tuesday night, you'll be waiting a good hour.  Their desserts are delicious and they shadow their entrees.  The Cheesecake Factory is just a standard American style restaurant that's dim inside and requires a good wait time in order to get seated."
Audrey L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,76,,4.0,31/1/2009,"I probably would never go here for dinner- because of the insanely long wait. I've had lunch out here on the rooftop, which was well worth it, especially when the weather was beautiful. Their food is pretty good, while their cheesecake is divine. Just grab it to go and sit on the bench across from Macy's. Yum!"
Nish N.,"San Francisco, United States",4571,1883,526,3.0,9/4/2005,"Why is there always a line here, especially with so many other great, local eateries within walking distance? That said, I have to admit their large variety of cheesecakes - one of my favorite types of dessert - is hard to beat."
Colleen B.,"San Francisco, United States",142,1304,22,2.0,4/6/2007,"Anytime I plan to go shopping I eat first. There is nothing more loathsome than having to eat with a bunch of rabid bargain shoppers who are willing to either dine on foodstuffs that have been basking away under a heat lamp all day, or this experience. There is no reason I should receive a beeper when I walk into a restaurant. With the prices at the Cheesecake Factory I expect the slightest level of personal interaction, take my name for fuck sake! Be courteous, if you choose to work in a turn & burn dining arena accept that you have to be nice to lots of jerks that come en masse at all hours of the day. I know, Union Square is full of tourists, they need the comfort of a chain in order to feel as if they're still back in whatever suburban community they crawled out of in order to visit our fine city.  There is no reason for locals to eat here, really. The rooftop is nice, if it wasn't for the bland food and the barrage of pigeons it would almost be a decent place to kick it with dessert and a cocktail."
Harry L.,"San Leandro, United States",15,35,,3.0,16/5/2008,"If San Francisco had constant sunlight this place will win 5 stars based on location alone. Too bad it's a muggy city covered in fog all the time. Food here isn't to brag about. I'd say nothing special or out of the ordinary. You can pretty much find everything on the menu anywhere and everywhere. But this one in particular is location, location, location. It sits on top of the Women's Macys Building. Overlooking Union Square, the scene is delightful. The wait on the other hand will murder ya. So don't go hungry."
s r.,"Beverly Hills, United States",171,377,49,3.0,4/6/2007,"I don't have anything against the Cheesecake Factory, per se, I just have a theory...anyone in a major city who prefers to dine at a chain restaurant is fundamentally different from me...red and blue states, if you will.  I was raised on chain restaurants, but I've outgrown their predictable and ho-hum fare served in large portions.    As it happens, every person with whom I have dined at a Cheesecake Factory is no longer in my life.  Yes, that's right...every friend or boyfriend who has suggested we eat at a CF has been kicked to the curb, including my most recent dinner partner.   This doesn't happen immediately, of course.  Rather, I view it as a sign of impending doom...the canary in the coal mine.   Thus, I have accepted it as the kiss of death to any relationship, when someone suggests we eat here, even if it is just because they love the cheesecake.  Let's face it...in a city like SF, there is no reason a city-dweller should come here.  There are just too many to-die-for restaurants at which we could dine.  This one should be left to tourists, Macy's shoppers with low blood sugar, and people who have recently moved here from less sophisticated areas...like Des Moines. I dined here in May with my BF at the time.  The food was good and the service was friendly and attentive.  We were given the standard flashing-light beeper and waited outside on the terrace for about 30 minutes...not bad on a weekend evening.  By the time we finished our meal, it had gotten so cold that we ordered coffee and cheesecake to go.  For this reason, I recommend sitting inside if it is after 3 PM, even if you have a coat and scarf. If you are someone who enjoys the food at this chain, this is definitely one that you should check out.  The roof terrace is nice, with its view overlooking Union Square.  They have patio heaters that emit a nice warmth, although it was still chilly when the sun set, and quite windy while the sun was still out.  You can even peruse the extra menus they keep in the inside waiting area, so you can order once you are seated.  This ensures that you don't spend too much time occupying their tables.  There are people waiting for your table...didn't you notice?!   So let it be said that should we ever find ourselves friends or dating, this can be our trigger phrase.  When you are ready to move on, all you need to do to clue me in is to suggest that we eat dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.   I'll promptly dismiss you as the bridge and tunnel unsophisticate that you are, and be happily on my way."
hello k.,"San Francisco, United States",47,200,3,4.0,12/3/2007,"What's with all the hate? I've been here several times and enjoyed each visit.  Food is quite good, generous portions, and the decor is cute.  My loud Chinese family can have a good time here without being prim and proper.  Yes, the wait can be long but some sucka in my family is always willing to wait while the rest of the family goes shopping at Macy's."
brian w.,"San Francisco, United States",146,140,1,3.0,20/9/2007,"to me, the cheesecake factory is like american idol.  i don't understand why americans love it so much. every time i come here, it's packed to the gills with tourists.  and not tourists from eastern europe or tibet, these are people with southern twangs and midwestern mom jeans with big white sneakers from wal-mart. do you frigging idiots not have cheesecake factory where you're from?  you flew all the way out to san francisco, home of la folie and gary danko and french laundry and dosa's and r&g lounge and you choose to eat at a chain restaurant?  wtf is wrong with you people? you're the same people that elected bush, aren't you? *sigh* anyways, back on topic - the food here isn't actually all that bad - it's consistent, the service is solid, and you get what you expect.  and considering the cost, if you split a $13 dinner 2 ways, that's a $6.50 sit down dinner, unheard of in the yay area. here's a tip for getting a table quickly: go to one of the big union square hotels, ask the concierge to book you a table.  you'll get bumped up in the monster cheesecake factory line."
