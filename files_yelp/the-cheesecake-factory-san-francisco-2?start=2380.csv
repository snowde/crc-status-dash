Rachel L.,"Fairfield, United States",40,198,15,3.0,12/1/2009,"Thank god for the view because if it wasn't for the outdoor patio overlooking the rest of Union Square I really don't think I'd be able to tough out the +1 hour long wait just for lunch.   If you're claustrophobic, aggravated with waiting for more than an hour, and in a RUSH.... then The Cheesecake Factory is just NOT for you. There are Cheesecake Factories all over the bay but because it's right in the middle of Union Square it's one of the hot spot tourist-driven restaurants in the area.  The menu is a bit overwhelming but in a good way. There's practically something on there for even the finicky of eaters. Right off the bat I was impressed with how reasonable the prices were. With it being my first trip to the cheesecake factory I was anticipating small portions and a big lunch tab. I was pleasantly surprised and proven WRONG :)  It's a new family tradition where we sit and grab lunch at the Cheesecake factory the day after Christmas. Union Square during the holiday season is gorgeous! If it wasn't for the little one dining with us we would have probably asked to be seated on their beautiful outdoor patio. Despite having awesome warmers at practically every table we didn't want to run the risk of having our daughter freak out about the view and want to leave in a hurry.  My family's lunch party consisted of 6 people. They wait staff seated us at a really comfortable booth with more than enough room to spare. Service was speedy but not the best I had ever experienced. Our server was a total doll but there were a few occasion where we had to remind him a second time to bring extra sauce or to come back with a pitcher so he could refill our waters. TSK TSK.  The food was actually really good. I ordered the sampler while other people in my family ordered various burgers and pasta dishes. We all sampled each others food and were all impressed and satisfied. I was a bit disappointed that there were only certain cheesecakes that could be purchased for a party of 5-6 people. You figure because it's the CHEESECAKE factory they'd be more accommodating and understanding. What an upset.  Overall I enjoyed the food at the restaurant and would probably willingly come back on a WEEKDAY to hopefully avoid the long wait times."
Tony L.,"San Francisco, United States",663,1265,21,3.0,4/7/2007,"This is about as good as it gets for a chain.  The pastas are decadent and the portions are big.  The drinks are also especially tasty, their bartenders definitely know what they're doing.  Their mojito is delicious.  Not too strong, not too sweet.  But why only three stars?  The wait is atrocious.  I don't know what's more boring, standing in a crowded lobby with no seating room or browsing the furniture section on the floor below at Macy's waiting for the hosts to buzz your number.   Why can't they just accept reservations?  This Cheesecake Factory has a unique location to say the least, but it's definitely not always worth the wait."
Stephanie L.,"Mililani, United States",489,317,704,4.0,8/6/2007,"4 stars mostly because of the food. Everytime I go, I order the Pasta Da Vinci. A must try, by the way! The food is always consistent and tasty and the staff is always friendly and funny. I really like to do Take-Out when I'm on the go. My recommendation if you're going to watch a movie downtown.... get Cheesecake Factory to go and sneak it in! OMG it's sooo good while watching a movie!! I do it ALL the time! Anyways, if you can get past the extremely long waits (if you're dining in that is), the food is pretty good!"
Tom C.,"Oakland, United States",80,94,,1.0,16/11/2006,"My Cheesecake Factory experience... Waiter: Here are your menus! I'll be back in ten minutes! In the meantime, I will bring bread! Furthermore, I will over enthusiastically end every sentence with exuberant emphasis until the point where it becomes an annoyance! Myself and friends: Great. Thanks. Waiter: What would you guys like today? Me: I'll have a Dr. Pepper with grenadine, thanks and um, for my entree how bout this anorexic girl in the red shirt advertising designer jeans for Nordstrom's on page 312?  Waiter: I'm sorry sir, that's not a menu item. Me: Oh, I must be confused. I thought this tome full of advertisements was your menu.  Waiter: Oh, it is. It's just that our entire dining experience has become so corporate that we choose to inundate our menu with untargeted ads in hopes of infuriating you while ordering an entree. Me: Oh, that's quite a convenient way to boost customer satisfaction I suppose. Waiter: Our market research has proved its 99.8% exasperating for almost everyone and anyone. I'm glad you agree. Here at Cheesecake Factory we strive to provide the worst experience possible. If you have any suggestion for how we could improve on our tireless quest toward imperfection we would greatly appreciate them.  Me: Oh, I think you're currently excelling in this pursuit quite remarkably.  Some time later... Waiter: Get excited! Your food will be here in 30! 29! 28! 27! 26! .... (Walking away) Myself and friends (exchanging looks connoting the thought did that really just happen?) NOTE: This occurred. I couldn't make this up.  900 seconds later (seriously --- I timed it) ... Waiter: Food! Me: You're a terrible counter. Me: Where's designer jeans girl? Waiter: Would you like another Dr. Pepper! With grenadine! Me: Does it come with cyanide? I will note that the food here is actually decent. But nothing more. And the experience, which is akin to being pile-driven into the ground by Hulk Hogan ten times in a row, largely outweighs the decent, overpriced food. For the economist-nerd Yelpers out there, the opportunity cost of lunch at Cheesecake is $18 and your sanity. Stay away."
Lucky M.,"San Francisco, United States",404,94,,1.0,23/10/2008,"Overrated, overpriced, and mediocre food! The drinks are weak, the service blows, and the wait for a seat can kiss my ass. Far better places in the city for the price range I'm paying at the cheesecake factory. They get one star for the awesome variety of cheesecakes!"
Jackie I.,"San Francisco, United States",28,194,,2.0,7/2/2006,"Excuse me? How long is the wait? Bullshit! I'm completely baffled by the large crowds that gather at the Cheesecake Factory. The food is mediocre at best, overpriced and the wait staff are all indifferent to the idea of providing good service."
Caroline O.,"San Francisco, United States",1,49,2,1.0,14/3/2009,"Here is an example of how your Cheesecake Factory experience might go: You arrive and are told that the wait for a table is 25-40 minutes.  After assessing the mob scene in the lobby area, you decide to take your pager down the escalator to wait on the couches in the peaceful furniture department, approximately 50 feet from the front desk. An hour later, you take your silent pager back up the escalator and suggest to the hostess that it might not be working.  She looks at you scornfully and says, ""You were downstairs SHOPPING, weren't you?"", explaining that the pagers only work on that floor.  Since you've apparently missed your turn in the queue, she says that she'll ""put you at the top--oh, no, NEAR the top of the list"" and that it will be ""no more than ten minutes."" After fifteen minutes of standing amidst the noisy, hungry throng, you notice the hostess eyeing you quizzically.  She motions towards your pager and asks, ""what number do you have on there?""  Takes the pager from you, examines it, and says to her co-hostess, ""This one's not working.""  To you: ""You'll be next."" Five minutes later, after two more parties have been seated, you are led to your table.  There, you search for ten minutes to find the three vegetarian options offered on the eighteen page menu.  It's like a treasure hunt!  (Being a traditional American restaurant, 90% of the menu items contain chicken, including every entree salad.) Then you eat a fairly tasty though oversized meal, attended to by a waitress who is attentive and genuinely nice, albeit somewhat airheaded. And you decide: just not worth the hassle."
Ann G.,"Kitchener, Canada",0,6,,3.0,24/9/2009,"We ordered the Original Strawberry cheesecake and loved it!!! The entrees were a-OK though - my hubby ordered the House Special burger, it looked mouth-watering but after stealing a few bites I was a bit disappointed, it tasted bland. I ordered a Tomato Basil Penne and it tasted too hard, seemed like they didn't cook them fully.  So next time we go (if we go again), I'd either get only one entree or skip the step completely and go right for the dessert menu!!!"
Samantha C.,"Sacramento, United States",205,258,15,3.0,15/9/2008,"Why oh why do so many people come here?  Yes, I get it, the view is pretty but there are plenty of other places to see the exact same view.  Further, don't justify waiting hours to eat average food so that you ""can see the view"" and then eat inside!  The food is average but always consistent, I can appreciate that.  Plus, who doesn't like cheesecake?  I don't mind eating here but it will be a cold day in hell before I wait 2 hours to eat anywhere."
Nicole S.,"Brooklyn, United States",21,122,,1.0,23/7/2005,"Okay, I now have joined the masses who hate this place. Food sucked big time and the cheescake wasn't even good! I never will be one of those poor fools to wait 2 hours to eat a shitty meal again."
Amy M.,"Oakland, United States",247,281,2,2.0,6/9/2006,"HUMONGOUS PORTIONS.  I don't think I can stress this enough.  My family (6 people) normally order appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts...  no way jose!  Not here, we ordered all that and took twelve LARGE to-go containers back to the car.  Holy cow!  I guess it's reasonably priced for how much food you're bombarded with, but honestly, who can eat that much?  That's just sad.  Great service, nice seating.  If its located on, in or near a mall it automatically gets docked at least two stars in my book.  Thanks, but NO THANKS!"
F B.,"San Francisco, United States",41,81,,3.0,27/7/2007,"How come they have to water drown every drink? Are you saying im drunk? Maybe I am, but not from them. Atleast cheesecake factory has good service. See you later, I'm gonna go replate my puttanesca in the Marc Jacobs rack downstars. Adios muchachos."
Tania J.,"Toronto, Canada",2,25,,4.0,11/4/2008,"My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory was at this location.  It was absolutely packed!  Waited at the bar for awhile until we could get a table. The food was very good, quite a large menu to choose from. I had a pasta dish, the portion was gigantic, when I stopped eating, it looked like I had hardly made a dent in it! We got the Snickers cheesecake to go..it was a bit of a disappointment, but we ate it nevertheless. :-)"
Nikita K.,"San Francisco, United States",105,550,460,5.0,9/10/2008,"MY FAVORITE PLACE. there are very many cons well just the long wait for everything. The food though covers for the wait. The pasta was large and so good. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is to die for, and im serious. SO GOOD!"
Angel J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,13,,4.0,12/8/2011,I love sitting on the deck watching the sites at Union Square. It's the city so you're always entertained. Good food and even better dessert.  Their portions are huge!  I would give it five stars but they are too popular and as a result service suffers.
Nicole L.,"San Francisco, United States",10,20,2,3.0,14/4/2009,"I never understood why so many people LOVE this place. Every time my parents come into town, we HAVE to come here. I hate it. You're surrounded by annoying tourists wearing fanny paks and carrying tons of shopping bags that crowd the lobby. You end up waiting for a friggin hour and a half just to get seated. The only food options are heart attack-on-a-plate; over done with cheese, dressing and mayo, then fried. Their alcoholic beverages are not ""amazing"" (how my waiter described them), and frankly, overpriced.  The only reason why I put up with the annoyance of the cheesecake factory (aside from pleasing my parents) is, well... their cheesecake. Preferably their banana cream cheesecake. It's so tasty and almost worth dining at the cheesecake factory.  The restaurant gets one star, but their cheesecake gets 5 stars."
JenJen W.,"Palo Alto, United States",39,338,23,4.0,19/1/2009,The food here is not bad but warning the portions are HUGE! It's definitely a great place to come with a group of people!  I came here one time for my birthday and they ended up giving me a free slice of cheesecake!  I love the cheesecakes here!  They have many different flavors and I ususally go for the chocolate type :)  Just try to avoid high peak time...this place is always packed!
am m.,"San Diego, United States",2,61,11,1.0,9/12/2007,"Normally I avoid chains, but when you have a group and your time and location are limited sometimes you can't have your way.  So when my study buddies and I wanted a weekday brunch and mimosa close to campus, we tried Cheesecake Factory.  Here's what happened: 1. Sat down at a crowded, odd table by the crumb laden waitress stand (I had to climb around a post to get in) even though there were lots of empty seats that were more comfortable.  Sat for like two minutes . . . I am thinking ""it smells like a dumpster in here.""  I didn't say anything though, because I am a germ freak and everybody always thinks I am paranoid when I say a restaurant is dirty.  One more minute goes by and someone else in my group says ""does it smell like trash in here?"".   We pinpointed the menus as the source of the offending funk - don't ask me how that happens.  We asked for a new table and different menus (of course we should have gotten a new table at a different restaurant, but we weren't that smart). 2.  Ordered our food - two out of four orders were wrong.  The waitress tried to foist the wrong orders off on us anyway, insisting that we didn't remember what we ordered!   It was like she thought to herself, ""oooh the helper didn't present that dish correctly, if I put it on the table they'll eat it.""  The correct orders didn't arrive until the rest of us finished eating.  Our brunch ended up taking an hour and a half without waiting for a table.   Next time we're going to Dottie's (great food decent price) . . . after all we can just have an after exam cocktail while we're waiting in line - the crack smoking across the street should be ample distraction."
Silly P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,31,1,4.0,27/2/2008,"Ok, I have always heard that the Cheesecake Factory has huge portions, a great view, and really crappy food.  My mother was in from out of town and I took her to get a makeover at Macy's.  While there we decided to eat at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  I've lived in SF for four years and avoided this place for it's ""bad food"" reputation - but I thought my meal was great.   My mother was happy with her meal as well (though, I must admit, she was so excited about her makeover, it would have taken a lot to kill her mood!)   I give them one less star because of the flatware issue!  When we arrived, they were so busy they didn't have any flatware to give us.  We didn't have food yet, so no biggie.  When they did bring forks, the lady next to us tapped me on the shoulder and said ""don't use that"" and turned over my fork.  It has a pretty big chunk of food on it (big enough for her to see it at the next table!)  The waiter was appropriately mortified and immediately brought us new forks.  I am sure they were literally pulling them from the dishwasher as it finished and bringing them out to us.  I know stuff like this happens sometimes, no matter what kind of place you are in, but it was a little gross!  Glad the lady next to me noticed!   Did I mention GREAT VIEW!"
Rory V.,"San Francisco, United States",27,39,,2.0,19/9/2006,"So I usually don't go to the cheesecake factory, but we were down at Union Square and wanted to sit outside, since it was such a beautiful day today. We arrived for lunch about !2:00ish and only had to wait 10 mins for a table outside, good start.... So our waiter comes and introduces him, and we order cocktails... 10 mins later still waiting for cocktails. water and bread would be nice by now....  20 mins, still no cocktails, no bread and now water.  30 mins, our waiter introduces us to a new waiter and says goodbye. As though we felt attached to him by this time. Seriously.  40 mins, cocktails finally arrive, the waiter says he'll come back to take our order.  55 mins, he's back and takes our order and tells us they don't have two of the dishes we ordered, so we change.  1hr 15 mins, apps arrive and he informs us that they don't the eggplant sandwich that I ordered. SO I ask him what else he recommends for a vegetarian. He looks at me with a blank face, and I kid you not, says ""Not Much..."" Omg, So I wait 10 seconds for a diiferent response, which doesn't come, so i grab the menu from his hand and start looking for something else. I finally found a four cheese pasta.  1hr 30 mins, food arrives, everyone else likes their's, mine's a 5 on scale from one to 10. Still no bread or water. So we order more cocktails and water. Good parts:  Outside seating, cocktails Bad Parts: Service, food, time factor, service, food, and service, did i mention service?"
