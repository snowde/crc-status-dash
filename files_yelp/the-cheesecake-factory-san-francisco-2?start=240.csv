Sylvia Y.,"Santa Clara, CA",86,421,772,2.0,6/5/2015,"Definitely a significantly worse experience compared to the last time I came here. This time I came on a Thursday night thinking that I could also be seated almost right away since it was the case last time on a Friday night. Nope, it was about 20 minutes wait, which wasn't too bad I suppose. However, service was unbearably slow. Took 15 minutes for us to just get our water and bread. Another long wait before we got our food. They didn't bring out the salad dressing at the same time as my salad (I asked for it on the side) so i had to wait again. They also forgot to put chicken in my salad. They brought it out eventually but after I had a bite, i wish they hadn't. It was literally the dryest, toughest, most unappetizing chicken ever. It tasted like it had been microwaved, frozen, and then reheated in the microwave again.  The salad itself was probably 2.5/5. Absolutely nothing special and there was only one measly piece of asparagus in there. Talk about false advertising. Overall not a good experience at all. Servers were spilling drinks on diners left and right (thankfully not on me). 1 star for the view and another star for not giving me food poisoning or getting dirty stuff in my food. Most definitely an off day for Cheesecake Factory. I'll think twice about coming back again."
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,4.0,8/5/2015,Traffic to get here? Absolutely terrible. Wait times for a dinner table? Absolutely way too long (think 30-90 minutes) Prices? Absolutely overpriced. Why do I continue to come here time after time as I get older? I have no idea. Maybe it's because of the complimentary brown oat bread and the cheesecake...
Kyrie S.,"Newark, CA",470,170,97,3.0,8/12/2016,"Located on the top floor of the Macy's across from Union Square, this Cheesecake Factory is just like all the others with the spectacular food and the bustling, yet ambient atmosphere. However,  what makes this one in particular unique is the incredible view of Union Square and the other FiDi buildings you get from their outdoor patio!  Dining from this height will make the experience feel much more grand and special, if you're willing to deal with the wait and the outdoor elements of wind, sun, and random pigeons. Indoor seating is just as exceptional though, and while the wait time will vary in length, the speed and quality of service I've always received here is superb.  I ultimately give this one 3 stars however because of the lack of waiting space and seating in their foyer (their front desk and cheesecake glass case is hard to access with all the people waiting around), and the small elevator used to get all the way up here. The elevator is always crowded and operates slowly every time we come here, forcing us to tediously ride the escalators all the way up. Overall I think my main problem here is accessiblity and openness of the location. Nonetheless, the food is always delicious, and whether or not you're staying to dine here, definitely stop by just to see the view too!"
Magda G.,"Stockton, CA",0,12,8,1.0,10/1/2017,"This was the first time we ate breakfast here. We came to celebrate my sons birthday and have some breakfast. The hostess was very welcoming and accommodating. With that said, our server wasn't too pleasant. I ordered coffee and I had to waive someone down to ask for sugar. By the time I got my sugar, my coffee was cold. That's how long it took to get service. We were in the corner and was frustrated to see 4 people grouped together and no one offering any help when I'm raising my hand. I felt like it took a long time to receive our food too. Thank god for the bread they served or we would have been starving. When the food arrived, it arrived cold. Our server must have left it up there for sometime. He failed to provide us all with silverware. I had to get up to get my own silverware because no one would come by. The food was not to par. Most of the food was left on our plates. Needless to say, the service and food sucked! It was an expensive mistake!"
Cam P.,"San Francisco, CA",429,14,,1.0,2/27/2017,"My boyfriend and I were so in love with this restaurant that we'd visit multiple times a week. We ordered The Cheesecake Factory through Postmates twice at this location and will never return again. The first time we ordered, we just wanted cheesecake. There was an option on the Postmates website to pay an extra $1 for a ""large"" slice of cheesecake. We'd never heard of this, so since we were sharing we said sure, and paid the extra amount. When we got our order we discovered that not only was the cheesecake not bigger, it was actually much, much smaller than normal. We were pretty upset so we called the restaurant. We got a super ignorant ""manager"" that said he'd known for quite sometime that there was an option for a larger slice, but that there was no such thing. When we asked why this hadn't been changed on the Postmastes website his response was ""Well that isn't really my problem."" Okay. Unsatisfied with his cavalier attitude, we asked to speak with his superior. He left us on hold for THIRTY MINUTES before connecting us with someone else. We spoke at length with a nice guy who was also a manager, explained the situation, and he listened to us, documented our concerns, and offered to send us a small gift card as an apology. Beyond the monetary gift, we were happy to see our concerns addressed and were overall satisfied with the conversation, even enough so to order again just a few days later. Fast-forward a couple of days and we ordered a slice of cheesecake, crabcake bites, and edamame. When we received our order the cheesecake was completely toppled over and smashed (probably not their fault, probably Postmate's fault), and the edamame was missing. We called the restaurant again and got another ""manager"". We explained that part of our order was missing and she replied saying ""Well you're callin' the wrong lady, ma'am. Contact Postmastes because this isn't our problem."" Okay... Regardless of whether it was or wasn't ""her problem"", we were upset customers and she didn't care. When I asked who I should talk to at TCF about the order issue, she simply hung up. Fast-forward to now and we've vowed to never come back to this restaurant or order from Postmates - no matter the location. To make matters even worse, the ""nice manager"" we spoke the first time never actually sent us an apology note or a gift card. It's been a month and a half since we've ordered from TCF and we haven't gotten a single thing in the mail from the manager. For show he even read our address back to us on the food and was super experienced at pretending to care, but was obviously no better than the other subpar managers at this location that we had the joy of interacting with.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory (+Postmates), you've lost us."
Bryan C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",57,20,61,5.0,3/13/2016,"Was here during the last Week of Christmas and man was it busy. The wait was crazy but the host/ess were very efficient. What's more fun it's situated on 8th floor of an insane sized Macy's. The clientele was mostly tourists like myself and very pushy and rude but the servers kept a smile on their face the entire time. I ordered grilled salmon the way they used to make BBQ salmon over succotash with a side of sweet potato fries. Had a apple strudel cheesecake with a side of ice cream. The food was excellent in presentation and taste / texture. The view from the patio was pretty amazing. During that time there was a Christmas tree and a roller skating rink with many people having a good time. I want to thank the waitress Gabriella for such a great experience and for keeping a smile when the table with the trash family started belittling her for some butter... As my wife and I understand how incredibly hard it is to be a server we hope you don't let ""little"" people degrade the joy you bring to people. We will visit again soon!"
JRolando M.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",1,20,1,2.0,7/15/2017,"We requested a table outside and we were told there was a 30 minute wait. However, we ended up waiting an hour. We were seated in a table where the heater wasn't working and it was chilly that night. We received our main dish after our appetizers only to realize it was for the wrong table. We then had to wait 30 minutes for our food to come out. We spent 3 hours at this place trying to have dinner! This was my second time here. I don't think I'll return for a third time."
Debbie D.,"San Francisco, CA",373,324,1110,4.0,3/28/2015,"I rarely come to cheesecake factory unless I'm in the area. I've celebrated my birthday at cheesecake factory couple of times and I enjoyed their food.  Tonight I got their Louisiana pasta ($17) and I love it, sauce is creamy and the breaded chicken was crispy and meaty. This place is known for the view and the atmosphere so expect to pay $$$. Wait time was estimated 40 mins on a Friday night but we got called in earlier so no complaints :)"
Luis R.,"San Francisco, CA",17,4,2,5.0,4/10/2017,I came this place  every week too have the best restaurant ever I order drink is my best drink ever nice woman  in the best bartender she's name is ashwini mmmmmm the better place too goo.
Stef A.,"North Ryde, Australia",0,9,,5.0,7/12/2017,"Favourite restaurant is San Fran! Although the wait times do vary, it is definitely worth the wait. The servers are very accomodating and attentive. The sizes of meals are huge so make sure you leave room for their famous cheesecake!  My sister celebrated her birthday with the entire terrace and servers singing happy birthday. Which was above and beyond what we expected  10/10 would recommend!"
Shannon M.,"New Lothrop, MI",54,5,,2.0,7/11/2017,"First of all, I love Cheesecake Factory. I wanted nothing more than to celebrate my birthday with Cheesecake Factory and the beautiful San Francisco view. We walked up, told we had a 20 minute wait. Over an hour later, we asked the hostess about the wait, was seated right after. It took 10 minutes for a waiter to come over, forgot our appetizer order, the bathroom was an absolute disaster, the baby changing table was broke, they didn't have 2 of the meals we ordered. I frequent the Novi, MI location and I will now continue. Very disappointing."
Elle B.,"Pinole, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/9/2017,"This is a review about the man in the front counter who was taking cheesecake orders. An African-American male,  his name is Gary (name on my receipt) he is very unfriendly,  very poor customer service. He shouldn't be in the front counter. Dec 8th, Friday, we had office lunch there, our server was very nice though,  but on our way out,we decided to get cheesecake for take out. We spent over $400 on lunch, the food was good, everything was fine  it's just that this guy at the counter was totally an a_ _! I ordered plain cheesecake,  he asked me if it's a slice, I said"" No, I want one whole round cheesecake"" He said ""What?"" I repeated myself and he said, ""Please elaborate"" and he moved the big cheesecake cardboard menu next to him to point to me the menu. As an order taker,  you should ask what size I want or tell me the sizes of cheesecake they carry, especially for customers who are not familiar with the sizes they carry-- they have 6 inches, 7 inches cake etc. Aside from that,  I waited a good 15 mins for my 6inch cheesecake order which I didnt really mind if he would have just said ""Thank you for waiting,  sorry about that, or have a nice day"" or whatever, but nothing, he just bagged the cheesecake and turned his back. No Thank you, no eye contact, no nothing.  Very rude. So I yelled ""THANK YOU "" he just pretended he didn't hear me, I guess."
Shamoo S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4,91,98,3.0,5/27/2017,"I have to commend my server Luis. He made our experience for drinks and cheesecake pleasant. Checked up on us, smiled and looked like he loved his job.  I can't say much about the front counter girl.My friend and I specifically asked to get seated outside and repeatedly said that because she looked so confused when we said we wanted outside table. When we got buzzed, hostess walked us to inside dining. Said we asked for outside seating so was given another buzzer to wait again. Really if the gal had listened in the first place, it wouldn't have wasted so much of anyone's time. I mean if you can't listen and do your job correctly as taking name and party number right, can you imagine this person trying to work their way up as a server? Major fail!!!  When we finally got our seat outside after a long wait, which we didn't mind. It was perfect! Love the view here and worth the wait."
Chardonnai S.,"San Lorenzo, CA",96,88,94,1.0,2/8/2016,"I guess I should have known that it was going to be a bad experience when I tried to place an order over the phone and was put on hold such a long time that I made it all the way to the entrance of the restaurant and was still on hold. I finally hung up.. All I wanted to do was order a green salad with no carrots to go. I thought maybe the restaurant would be busy because it's the day after the Super Bowl and they may have visitors. It was not busy at all. I place my order, paid and stood away from the counter waiting for my order. I continue to wait as other guests were given their to go orders. I did notice there were four gentlemen that were very irritated because they had to wait a long time just to get four pieces of cheesecake. Finally I asked the girl that took my order, was it ready. I think she had forgotten because she was busy trying to finish her water, close the register, and finish talking to the person that was starting her shift. Please keep in my I was on my lunch break and time was of th essence.  The cashier/order taker didn't take an attitude when I asked for my food but took a long to go and put it in a bag with bread. When I got the bag I quickly looked in it only to find three spoons. I asked for a fork and was told they were out. Really, a spoon for a salad? I got a fork from somewhere else.  Anyway I hurried to go and eat especially since it already had taken about 15 to 20 minutes to get my meal.  I sat down and took the salad out of the bag and was saddened by the poor salad with some wilted and even brown lettuce mixed together. Now I received 4 loaves of bread in a container maybe to make up for the bad looking salad. I gave most of the bread to a coworker.  I'm not what the problem was but I think it will be another very long time before I'll visit this location especially on my lunch break."
Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",81,1838,8185,4.0,1/28/2015,"I can't resist going here when I find myself in Union Square around dinner time.  THE WAIT: We showed up around 6pm and the wait was about 45 minutes for 2 of us for a window seat on the patio. They were pretty accurate - we got caught up shopping in Macy's and came back after an hour and they had already called us. We still got a patio table but not a window seat with a direct view. There are heating lamps out there that make the cold pretty bearable, but I still had to wear my jacket and sit directly under it (which also meant I wasn't facing the view but looking back at the restaurant). THE SERVICE:  Our server was very friendly and professional and always checked on us when needed. MUST-HAVES: Avocado egg rolls! Do NOT get the Diane's Steak as it's completely bland. * Avocado rolls appetizer - 4 stars pic:  Really tasty! Thick and subtly crunchy shell, soft avocado filling. I didn't love the dip, which was sweet and sour, but the rolls really didn't have much flavor without the dip so I had to go with it anyway. * Diane's Steak - 2 stars pic:  This was very flavorless. The steak had zero seasoning on it. There was a little bit of sauce with the mushrooms but it really didn't add much. The mashed potatoes have a bit more flavor but then those were pretty hard and dried out. * Jambalaya - 3.5 stars pic:  Petty tasty & spicy, a very big and pretty enjoyable entree, especially compared to the steak! The chicken was fairly tender, but shrimp not super fresh and lacked that nice crunch. * Oreo Cheesecake - 3.5 stars pic:  Can't really go wrong here. Oreo everything: in the whipped cream, in the cake, on top, on the plate. I would just say that the oreos sprinkled around were pretty dried out and hard."
Marie J.,"Stege, Denmark",13,1,,2.0,6/17/2017,"I have mix feelings about this place. We Went to dinner here last Night and it was Amazing. The waiter was sweet ( the Best service i have ever experience) and the food was fantastisk. So A 5 Star experience. But today it was A totally difference experience. The waiter was really rude. He Said and i quote "" you look Like you are 12"". That comment made me really sad so my boyfriend and i left the restaurant before we got our food. (So A 1 Star experience)"
Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",49,12,7,4.0,1/5/2017,"One of my go-to restaurants when I'm shopping around Union Square and can't find a nice place to eat.  Unfortunately, a major downfall is the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. The several times I've been here, I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table, and that's on a good day. The wait and amount of people is absolutely insane during busier hours and the holidays. Definitely not the place to go if you don't have a lot of time to kill.  Otherwise, I think it's a good date spot to pick that isn't too expensive, has friendly customer service, and a large sized portions for meals. They always serve a couple of loaves of bread, along with quality butter, after they take your menu. This is a huge plus for me, since the actual order can take somewhat long to get to your table. Sitting outside is also really nice, especially when while the sun is setting. It's a little too cold to be sitting outside during the winter, but spring/summer is fine, and there are a few outdoor heaters. From my several visits, I've had:  Shephard's Pie: A huge plate of beef and veggies, topped with mashed potatoes and a parmesan cheese crust. Super filling and tasty, though I wish the meal instead came as a smaller portion with a variety of other sides to make it more interesting. Pasta Carbonara: I've ordered this the most! I love the creamy, cheesey sauce, and thin noodles. My default pasta choice. The server always asks if additional parmesan on top is preferred.  Factory Burrito Grande: A really, really huge burrito with different sauces on the side, and for $15! Pretty good and extremely filling - I got through a third and had to take the rest to go.  Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae: My favorite dessert! For $9, this is a really delicious, rich brownie sundae. On one occasion, I've come here looking to ONLY eat dessert, which was totally fine. The plate is huge, and even shared between two people, it's enough to make you full.  Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake: My favorite pick of cheesecake, I have a thing for tangy, tart desserts. Overall, I think their cheesecakes are a bit pricey per slice, as the slice is also quite small, but if you've never tried it before, it's worth buying a slice or two."
Luis P.,"San Francisco, CA",236,109,7,2.0,4/22/2017,"I mean, cheesecake factory is an assembly line ""upscale"" casual dinning restaurant, right? Well, you may need to remind the staff and patrons here. I guess the line out the door gets the the staff's head because they treat you like cattle here. There is no personality and the service is painstakingly slow. Do yourself a favor and try one of the many delicious local restaurants within a five minute walk. You will thank yourself for passing on this one."
Jacob A.,"Fairfield, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/17/2016,"We came in on a very busy day, supposedly one of the busiest days they've had in a while. Which I have taken into consideration in writing this review. I understand how hectic things can get at a busy restaurant and of course the extremely long wait (over 3 hours) was not very pleasurable; however, it was completely understandable as to why we had to wait that long. Cheesecake is always busy, so they have a system where you check in first, they give you an initial quote of how long you'll have to wait, and a time to return to get your pager.  We were told at 4:40 that we should return at about 6:30 for the pager. The initial quote being 2 hours. We came to get our pager at around 6:30, maybe just a few minutes later. We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes just to receive the pager and then when we got to the front of the line they told us, as well as everyone else that they did not have any more pagers to give out and to come back in 10 minutes to get the pagers. Ultimately, in my opinion it would have been much more efficient just to address the whole lobby rather than have people wasting their time filing through a line only to wait in that same line again just to hope they had enough pagers for all of us. After that, we did receive our pager and were told our wait would be 30 minutes. After over 30 minutes I went to the front just to ask how much longer they thought it would be to be told by a hostess about 10-15 minutes. Keep in mind we were already 45 minutes over our quote at this point, but given the current situation it was understandable as to why we were being pushed back. Again, after 20 minutes we addressed another hostess just to be greeted very unprofessionally. She didn't want to even give us an estimate, after ensuring her that we could handle the knowledge of the true wait time. Again she refused to tell us and we went back to the seating area to wait again. Luckily, within a few minutes our pager started buzzing, but instead of having a table for us, we were told it was an accident and that they didn't even have a table for us. They then apologized and tried to frantically find us a table that wasn't even supposed to be available for us. They then brought us to a table that usually is meant to seat 4 (we had a party of 6). We noticed another party of 2 next to us was just about to leave so we asked  if we could just push the tables together to have proper seating. They replied, no we can not but if you'd like you can go back into the lobby and wait another 45 minutes or so. Which meant to me that ultimately the 30 minute wait that we were first given was somewhere closer to an hour and a half long. They were essentially low balling us on the wait time to keep us here instead of waiting. Had we known that the wait would be about 4 hours long rather than 2 hours we would have never came here in the first place, and they know that. So, for the sake of making money, the cheesecake factory purposely doesn't give realistic estimates. They've done it to us before, but nothing as ridiculous as this. We were treated just as another number and I can say with complete assurance that I will never be coming here. It's just not worth the wait for mediocre customer service, and food just so you might have a view of union square."
April G.,"San Jose, CA",94,9,10,2.0,2/27/2017,"2 star because of what I found after I took my left overs home. The waiter was awesome, made sure me and my mom had everything we needed.  But when I was eating my left over fettuccine alfredo at home, I found a long piece of plastic along with my noodles. I thought it was an uncooked piece at first, but the texture gave it away..."

Debbie D.,"San Francisco, United States",373,324,1110,4.0,28/3/2015,"I rarely come to cheesecake factory unless I'm in the area. I've celebrated my birthday at cheesecake factory couple of times and I enjoyed their food.  Tonight I got their Louisiana pasta ($17) and I love it, sauce is creamy and the breaded chicken was crispy and meaty. This place is known for the view and the atmosphere so expect to pay $$$. Wait time was estimated 40 mins on a Friday night but we got called in earlier so no complaints :)"

Stef A.,"North Ryde, Australia",0,9,,5.0,12/7/2017,"Favourite restaurant is San Fran! Although the wait times do vary, it is definitely worth the wait. The servers are very accomodating and attentive. The sizes of meals are huge so make sure you leave room for their famous cheesecake!  My sister celebrated her birthday with the entire terrace and servers singing happy birthday. Which was above and beyond what we expected  10/10 would recommend!"
Shannon M.,"New Lothrop, United States",54,5,,2.0,11/7/2017,"First of all, I love Cheesecake Factory. I wanted nothing more than to celebrate my birthday with Cheesecake Factory and the beautiful San Francisco view. We walked up, told we had a 20 minute wait. Over an hour later, we asked the hostess about the wait, was seated right after. It took 10 minutes for a waiter to come over, forgot our appetizer order, the bathroom was an absolute disaster, the baby changing table was broke, they didn't have 2 of the meals we ordered. I frequent the Novi, MI location and I will now continue. Very disappointing."
Elle B.,"Pinole, United States",0,6,,1.0,9/12/2017,"This is a review about the man in the front counter who was taking cheesecake orders. An African-American male,  his name is Gary (name on my receipt) he is very unfriendly,  very poor customer service. He shouldn't be in the front counter. Dec 8th, Friday, we had office lunch there, our server was very nice though,  but on our way out,we decided to get cheesecake for take out. We spent over $400 on lunch, the food was good, everything was fine  it's just that this guy at the counter was totally an a_ _! I ordered plain cheesecake,  he asked me if it's a slice, I said"" No, I want one whole round cheesecake"" He said ""What?"" I repeated myself and he said, ""Please elaborate"" and he moved the big cheesecake cardboard menu next to him to point to me the menu. As an order taker,  you should ask what size I want or tell me the sizes of cheesecake they carry, especially for customers who are not familiar with the sizes they carry-- they have 6 inches, 7 inches cake etc. Aside from that,  I waited a good 15 mins for my 6inch cheesecake order which I didnt really mind if he would have just said ""Thank you for waiting,  sorry about that, or have a nice day"" or whatever, but nothing, he just bagged the cheesecake and turned his back. No Thank you, no eye contact, no nothing.  Very rude. So I yelled ""THANK YOU "" he just pretended he didn't hear me, I guess."
Shamoo S.,"Costa Mesa, United States",4,91,98,3.0,27/5/2017,"I have to commend my server Luis. He made our experience for drinks and cheesecake pleasant. Checked up on us, smiled and looked like he loved his job.  I can't say much about the front counter girl.My friend and I specifically asked to get seated outside and repeatedly said that because she looked so confused when we said we wanted outside table. When we got buzzed, hostess walked us to inside dining. Said we asked for outside seating so was given another buzzer to wait again. Really if the gal had listened in the first place, it wouldn't have wasted so much of anyone's time. I mean if you can't listen and do your job correctly as taking name and party number right, can you imagine this person trying to work their way up as a server? Major fail!!!  When we finally got our seat outside after a long wait, which we didn't mind. It was perfect! Love the view here and worth the wait."
Chardonnai S.,"San Lorenzo, United States",96,88,94,1.0,8/2/2016,"I guess I should have known that it was going to be a bad experience when I tried to place an order over the phone and was put on hold such a long time that I made it all the way to the entrance of the restaurant and was still on hold. I finally hung up.. All I wanted to do was order a green salad with no carrots to go. I thought maybe the restaurant would be busy because it's the day after the Super Bowl and they may have visitors. It was not busy at all. I place my order, paid and stood away from the counter waiting for my order. I continue to wait as other guests were given their to go orders. I did notice there were four gentlemen that were very irritated because they had to wait a long time just to get four pieces of cheesecake. Finally I asked the girl that took my order, was it ready. I think she had forgotten because she was busy trying to finish her water, close the register, and finish talking to the person that was starting her shift. Please keep in my I was on my lunch break and time was of th essence.  The cashier/order taker didn't take an attitude when I asked for my food but took a long to go and put it in a bag with bread. When I got the bag I quickly looked in it only to find three spoons. I asked for a fork and was told they were out. Really, a spoon for a salad? I got a fork from somewhere else.  Anyway I hurried to go and eat especially since it already had taken about 15 to 20 minutes to get my meal.  I sat down and took the salad out of the bag and was saddened by the poor salad with some wilted and even brown lettuce mixed together. Now I received 4 loaves of bread in a container maybe to make up for the bad looking salad. I gave most of the bread to a coworker.  I'm not what the problem was but I think it will be another very long time before I'll visit this location especially on my lunch break."
Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, United States",81,1838,8185,4.0,28/1/2015,"I can't resist going here when I find myself in Union Square around dinner time.  THE WAIT: We showed up around 6pm and the wait was about 45 minutes for 2 of us for a window seat on the patio. They were pretty accurate - we got caught up shopping in Macy's and came back after an hour and they had already called us. We still got a patio table but not a window seat with a direct view. There are heating lamps out there that make the cold pretty bearable, but I still had to wear my jacket and sit directly under it (which also meant I wasn't facing the view but looking back at the restaurant). THE SERVICE:  Our server was very friendly and professional and always checked on us when needed. MUST-HAVES: Avocado egg rolls! Do NOT get the Diane's Steak as it's completely bland. * Avocado rolls appetizer - 4 stars pic:  Really tasty! Thick and subtly crunchy shell, soft avocado filling. I didn't love the dip, which was sweet and sour, but the rolls really didn't have much flavor without the dip so I had to go with it anyway. * Diane's Steak - 2 stars pic:  This was very flavorless. The steak had zero seasoning on it. There was a little bit of sauce with the mushrooms but it really didn't add much. The mashed potatoes have a bit more flavor but then those were pretty hard and dried out. * Jambalaya - 3.5 stars pic:  Petty tasty & spicy, a very big and pretty enjoyable entree, especially compared to the steak! The chicken was fairly tender, but shrimp not super fresh and lacked that nice crunch. * Oreo Cheesecake - 3.5 stars pic:  Can't really go wrong here. Oreo everything: in the whipped cream, in the cake, on top, on the plate. I would just say that the oreos sprinkled around were pretty dried out and hard."
Marie J.,"Stege, Denmark",13,1,,2.0,17/6/2017,"I have mix feelings about this place. We Went to dinner here last Night and it was Amazing. The waiter was sweet ( the Best service i have ever experience) and the food was fantastisk. So A 5 Star experience. But today it was A totally difference experience. The waiter was really rude. He Said and i quote "" you look Like you are 12"". That comment made me really sad so my boyfriend and i left the restaurant before we got our food. (So A 1 Star experience)"
Vivian L.,"San Francisco, United States",49,12,7,4.0,5/1/2017,"One of my go-to restaurants when I'm shopping around Union Square and can't find a nice place to eat.  Unfortunately, a major downfall is the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. The several times I've been here, I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table, and that's on a good day. The wait and amount of people is absolutely insane during busier hours and the holidays. Definitely not the place to go if you don't have a lot of time to kill.  Otherwise, I think it's a good date spot to pick that isn't too expensive, has friendly customer service, and a large sized portions for meals. They always serve a couple of loaves of bread, along with quality butter, after they take your menu. This is a huge plus for me, since the actual order can take somewhat long to get to your table. Sitting outside is also really nice, especially when while the sun is setting. It's a little too cold to be sitting outside during the winter, but spring/summer is fine, and there are a few outdoor heaters. From my several visits, I've had:  Shephard's Pie: A huge plate of beef and veggies, topped with mashed potatoes and a parmesan cheese crust. Super filling and tasty, though I wish the meal instead came as a smaller portion with a variety of other sides to make it more interesting. Pasta Carbonara: I've ordered this the most! I love the creamy, cheesey sauce, and thin noodles. My default pasta choice. The server always asks if additional parmesan on top is preferred.  Factory Burrito Grande: A really, really huge burrito with different sauces on the side, and for $15! Pretty good and extremely filling - I got through a third and had to take the rest to go.  Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae: My favorite dessert! For $9, this is a really delicious, rich brownie sundae. On one occasion, I've come here looking to ONLY eat dessert, which was totally fine. The plate is huge, and even shared between two people, it's enough to make you full.  Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake: My favorite pick of cheesecake, I have a thing for tangy, tart desserts. Overall, I think their cheesecakes are a bit pricey per slice, as the slice is also quite small, but if you've never tried it before, it's worth buying a slice or two."
Luis P.,"San Francisco, United States",236,109,7,2.0,22/4/2017,"I mean, cheesecake factory is an assembly line ""upscale"" casual dinning restaurant, right? Well, you may need to remind the staff and patrons here. I guess the line out the door gets the the staff's head because they treat you like cattle here. There is no personality and the service is painstakingly slow. Do yourself a favor and try one of the many delicious local restaurants within a five minute walk. You will thank yourself for passing on this one."
Jacob A.,"Fairfield, United States",0,5,1,1.0,17/12/2016,"We came in on a very busy day, supposedly one of the busiest days they've had in a while. Which I have taken into consideration in writing this review. I understand how hectic things can get at a busy restaurant and of course the extremely long wait (over 3 hours) was not very pleasurable; however, it was completely understandable as to why we had to wait that long. Cheesecake is always busy, so they have a system where you check in first, they give you an initial quote of how long you'll have to wait, and a time to return to get your pager.  We were told at 4:40 that we should return at about 6:30 for the pager. The initial quote being 2 hours. We came to get our pager at around 6:30, maybe just a few minutes later. We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes just to receive the pager and then when we got to the front of the line they told us, as well as everyone else that they did not have any more pagers to give out and to come back in 10 minutes to get the pagers. Ultimately, in my opinion it would have been much more efficient just to address the whole lobby rather than have people wasting their time filing through a line only to wait in that same line again just to hope they had enough pagers for all of us. After that, we did receive our pager and were told our wait would be 30 minutes. After over 30 minutes I went to the front just to ask how much longer they thought it would be to be told by a hostess about 10-15 minutes. Keep in mind we were already 45 minutes over our quote at this point, but given the current situation it was understandable as to why we were being pushed back. Again, after 20 minutes we addressed another hostess just to be greeted very unprofessionally. She didn't want to even give us an estimate, after ensuring her that we could handle the knowledge of the true wait time. Again she refused to tell us and we went back to the seating area to wait again. Luckily, within a few minutes our pager started buzzing, but instead of having a table for us, we were told it was an accident and that they didn't even have a table for us. They then apologized and tried to frantically find us a table that wasn't even supposed to be available for us. They then brought us to a table that usually is meant to seat 4 (we had a party of 6). We noticed another party of 2 next to us was just about to leave so we asked  if we could just push the tables together to have proper seating. They replied, no we can not but if you'd like you can go back into the lobby and wait another 45 minutes or so. Which meant to me that ultimately the 30 minute wait that we were first given was somewhere closer to an hour and a half long. They were essentially low balling us on the wait time to keep us here instead of waiting. Had we known that the wait would be about 4 hours long rather than 2 hours we would have never came here in the first place, and they know that. So, for the sake of making money, the cheesecake factory purposely doesn't give realistic estimates. They've done it to us before, but nothing as ridiculous as this. We were treated just as another number and I can say with complete assurance that I will never be coming here. It's just not worth the wait for mediocre customer service, and food just so you might have a view of union square."
April G.,"San Jose, United States",94,9,10,2.0,27/2/2017,"2 star because of what I found after I took my left overs home. The waiter was awesome, made sure me and my mom had everything we needed.  But when I was eating my left over fettuccine alfredo at home, I found a long piece of plastic along with my noodles. I thought it was an uncooked piece at first, but the texture gave it away..."
