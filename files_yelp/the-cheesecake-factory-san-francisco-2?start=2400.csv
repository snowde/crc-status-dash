Jacqueline D.,"Vallejo, United States",88,53,,4.0,13/1/2009,"Sometimes the line/wait gets a little CRAZY, too long, but thats because everyone likes eating here.  I enjoy their pasta and of course their desserts.  One of my faves is the ghiradelli pie or something to that manner.  I loved going here with the BP interns at Nordies, lol.  After our monthly meetings we would go here and just relax and chat it up.  The price is pretty expensive, and depending on ur server you can either have the best time or a so-so time, its a toss up on that one."
Mary L.,"San Francisco, United States",1,11,,3.0,11/8/2006,GREAT for satisfying late night sweet tooth cravings. They're open till 2am. No crowds at 2am!
Steven B.,"Hayward, United States",88,286,49,3.0,7/12/2008,"I've been eating at this particular cheesecake factory for about 3 years. The service is alright. The first couple times I was there, the service was horrible.  The wait was about 1 1/2 hour, once we were seated it took 15 minutes for our drinks and about another 30 minutes for our food to arrive. But now I'd say things are getting a bit better. Shorter waits and better service from our waiters. The food is good and if something goes wrong, the manager will be sure to fix it, either giving us a new entree or a free appetizer of some sort. Overall, I think this place is just average."
Joako F.,"San Francisco, United States",1,18,,1.0,5/12/2005,After one hour waiting you are in such a mood that almost everything tastes like crap
Christina C.,"Bradley, United States",0,12,,3.0,26/7/2009,"Was there at night, about 8:45 p.m., thinking maybe we missed the dinner crowd and it wouldn't be that busy.  Wrong.  It took us 45 minutes to wait for a table. Told the hostess that we wanted a table inside, but we got a table outside. Explained to the hostess (a different one) that we had requested for an inside table. Took about 10 minutes to get it all straightened out, and another 15-20mins to wait for an inside table.  The waiting area was very crowded. Kids were hanging off the counter where the hostesses were working. Kids were running everywhere. It was loud, no wonder the hostess didn't hear us say we wanted inside table.  Ordered the healthy option grilled chicken while my bestfriend had their 3 cheese pasta. My grilled chicken was delicious. It came with jasmine rice, 3 chicken breasts, and asparagus. Yummy! My friend loved her dish. Portions/servings are large - I had to pack mine in a to-go box because I couldn't finish my food.  We ordered 2 different cheesecakes - i had the good ol' regular plain cheesecake while my friend had the lemon raspberry kind. We took it home because we had absolutely no room left in our belly. :) It was still good when we ate it for breakfast the next day.  Drinks refill - none - waitress didnt even come to check on that. :(  So... food and portions score big for me. But their service could use a little polishing."
Jay D.,"San Francisco, United States",5,50,2,4.0,14/2/2009,"I went here with a friend for dinner on a weeknight a few weeks ago. Judging from that last visit, and remembering my experience from this place in the past many years ago, my observation is that the quality of service and food are still the same. We sat outside under the heat lamps and the view of Union Square.  The ambiance of the plaza at night is beautiful, although I should have chosen a warmer night to eat outside....the outdoor heat lamps didn't really keep my hands and face warm enough from the cold. The food we ordered was very good.  I can't remember what we ordered, but I remember that we ordered 2 appetizers and one main dish.  One of the main dishes was a daily special not in the menu....a four-flavor thin crust pizza, which was OK.  I really didn't notice how special it was to be considered something not yet in the menu.  One of the appetizers was a cornbread appetizer with a special sauce surrounding it...I can't remember the name of it right now, but it was between excellent and very good.  We also ordered nachos with guacamole dip, salsa dip, and sour cream, which wasn't bad either.   Service - 4 stars Food - 4 stars"
Roy N.,"San Francisco, United States",43,243,13,3.0,18/10/2008,"i give this place only 3 stars because of the ridiculously long wait time, but it is a tourist place and the location is amazing for visitors to SF.  I actually go there just for desserts, which may not be worth the long wait."
Florence C.,Hong Kong,10,44,3,3.0,7/5/2008,"typical American style food, large portion. but the cheesecakes there are wonderful, lots of choices and taste great. it's a great place for family instead of two people, unless you're big eater or someone who craves for cheesecake so bad.  i don't like the long wait. every time i go there, i have to wait almost an hour to be seated."
Connie C.,"Belmont, United States",5000,1539,1424,4.0,29/11/2005,"This Cheesecake Factory is very touristy, so I rarely dine in here. But the outdoor patio overlooking Union Square is a great spot to sit on a warm sunny day. So, I usually take my dessert to go. I love the huge menu of cheesecakes - the dulce de leche is my fave - and the ""fabulous"" chocolate mousse cake (it is FAB!) is the largest slice of chocolatey heaven that I indulge in over a period of several days (it lasts for a week and still tastes yummy! so it comes out to like 200 calories x 7 = 1400)."
Nancy M.,"Seattle, United States",119,183,140,4.0,23/9/2007,"I don't care that this place is a chain; I think the food is yummy.  The dinner portions are really large, I usually end up taking some home, while their lunch portions are much more manageable.  The dinner wait is insane, generally 2+ hours if you're there during prime dinner hours, which is why I don't come here very often (minus 1 star for not taking reservations!).  Their cheesecake is oh-so creamy and decadent.  My flavor of the moment is the lemon-raspberry cheesecake; a perfect combination of sweet and tangy.  If you have the patience and time to wait for a seat, enjoy it at the restaurant.  Otherwise, you can order your slices at the counter to go and take them down to Union Square to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city."
Rebecca R.,"Bloomington, United States",6,205,3,3.0,22/11/2010,"Been here a few times, most recently two weeks ago. It was ok, but nothing fantastic. When it's busy, it seems like they just slop everything together. They ran out of bread and ran out of the foccacia bread that was to be on my sandwich. The cheesecake was frozen. Still pretty tasty, but overall just ok. Not worth the cost of the meal to be honest!"
Tony T.,"Beaverton, United States",1,18,,3.0,11/7/2009,"Although there is always a long wait, this place is worth it if you are really hungry! They have huge portions and most of the things I have tried were pretty good. The only thing I did not like was the chicken jambalaya pasta. It tasted like it was overly peppered. I do not know so much about Italian or Cajun foods, and maybe it just did not cater to my taste but I did not enjoy it. The prices are expensive, but when you find a dish or things you like, the Cheese Cake Factory is a keeper. One dish that I do love is the spicy chipotle chicken pasta dish. It has a spicy kick to it that I like and the flavor was delightful. It was a good experience overall eating the dish because it was sweet but had a spicy kick to it, and it was soft and chewy yet it had a crunchy bite to it also. The dish is delicious and I want to have another plate the next time I come back."
Robert M.,"San Francisco, United States",178,453,292,4.0,27/7/2007,"Margie is soooo right about the weight thing -- only problem is my first number was already a 2!  While not earthshaking (this is a chain, after all), the food is quite entertaining and sitting out on the balcony high above Union Square is thrilling for any San Francisco resident or visitor.  Even the seagulls have personality. I brought my red-neck on a banana peel dad here for dessert after dinner at Tadich Grill and before I knew what was happening he was snapping a photo of a young gay Asian guy, saying ""I just want to see you put that big thing in your mouth.""  (Talking about his sandwich.)  Of course this had entirely different connotation to me and my neighboring table than it did to this 88 year old retired construction worker from the Midwest.  Only real downside is the horrendous wait -- you really have to pace your arrival to get a seat the same night."
Arthur S.,"South San Francisco, United States",0,27,,5.0,10/5/2011,"despite the long wait, the food is amazing and the menu has everything you can possibly imagine. there is something for everyone!!"
Sydney L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,216,3,4.0,16/4/2005,"Excellent pasta, I hate to admit it but I prefer them over the ""more authentic"" italian food with superstar citysearch ratings.  Best Italian chain restaurant hands down in terms of atmosphere, food quality, service, the only reason they are not getting a five is due to the ""no reservation policy"" and 20-60 minuate wait each time."
Ani M.,"Glendale, United States",93,53,3,4.0,21/9/2008,"I love the Cheesecake factory in general, it's one of the few chain restaurants I enjoy, but the one in Union Square is definitely my fav! It's on the top floor of the Macy's. Sit outside because you get a great view, but watch out for pigeons!!"
Charleen S.,"Redwood City, United States",83,91,4,5.0,19/8/2008,"When I first discovered The Cheesecake Factory, it was love at first sight. I think this was my first location and I love it, but it's always sooooo crowded and busy. To me though, it's worth the wait. It's a nice little spot above Macy's in Union Square. If you get an outside table you get a nice view of Union Square and all the shi-shi stores around there (Tiffany and Co., etc...) Service is good, I have no complaints there. To me, eating here is an experience!"
Eric Y.,"Millbrae, United States",327,695,1295,2.0,3/8/2008,terrible service the last time i went. the waitor looked like she was dead or drunk the previous night.  she didn't understand a single word we said. we asked for ice water and it didn't come after she said okay. we asked for napkin and she never brought it over. we complained abuot our food being slow and finally the manager came over to say sorry. nothing else happened
Nicole G.,"Stockton, United States",3,51,27,5.0,10/5/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is an old faithful.  Any one I go to is usually consistent and I do love the pulled pork sandwich and fried mac and cheese.  This CF garners up 5 stars for their outside seating which gives you the best view of Union Square since the restaurant sits on top of the Macy's building.  They really shouldn't offer outside seating though on cold, windy days.  Their heaters are not adequate enough for you to fully enjoy your dinner because your jaw is too busy shivering instead of chewing."
Vickie B.,"Irvine, United States",80,74,28,4.0,29/11/2008,I enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory on top of Macy*s during the holidays. The only problem was waiting for 10-20 minutes for a table. The service is great here.
