Christopher D.,"Dallas, United States",188,222,17,3.0,29/7/2008,"Everyone knows what the food at cheesecake tastes like.  This cheesecake is no different from any other, but it has nice outside seating for warmer days.   You can see downtown Union Square from the outside seating.  The worst thing about this place is the wait.  Usually I just wait at the bar and drink with my guy friends while the girls go shopping.  I would give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because I honestly think the food is pretty good for a chain restaurant, but the wait is wayy too long."
Tyler D.,"San Francisco, United States",19,96,2,2.0,31/12/2007,"This place is pretty and such, but I seriously was not impressed with the service or the food. I mean the wait is anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours for what? The food is not that great and I do not like cheesecake that much. I don't understand the hype about this place. The way people flock here you would think that it's the next great thing, but it just comes off as the same old tired restaurant that has more stock in its name than the food they serve."
Nancy P.,"Petaluma, United States",163,275,1,4.0,11/7/2008,"i have to give four stars because i love the location, love the food and love the cheesecake! some things i'm no so thrilled about.. *no reservations. how shitty is it to drive 40 min to the city, only to wait 2 hours for seating. *i told our server multiple times, as well as the hostesses, that it was my friend's birthday. they  never came. *the bar is way too crowded, and the host area is horribly unorganized. perks! *great, yummy food! lemon salmon over garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus everytime! *the rye bread is to die for. they give you an assortment of different breads, but i ask for just-the-rye. *extremely large assortment of cheesecake. i personally enjoy the cookies & cream, banana, strawberry and chocolate mousse. *fun atmosphere, great seating outside overlooking union square. come for lunch.. late. or come for dinner early. they offer brunch, too. but i can't imagine what the wait is like for that."
Ryan M.,"San Francisco, United States",30,33,25,3.0,3/1/2009,"At around 9 pm on the last night of every tax season,  when everyone in the office is just about ready to go absolutely insane with stress, our boss gives the go signal to call it ""a season"" and head off to our after-tax season celebration. The usual target? Cheesecake Factory.  Only 0.2 mile away from the office and open till 11 pm (12:30 am on weekends), Cheesecake is convenient.  SERVICE. Well, first, you have to deal with the queue. I don't remember waiting for less than an hour, no matter what time I go there. So DO NOT go there famished, or you'll faint. And the maitre d' could be friendlier. The place is ALWAYS packed - a good excuse to grab a few drinks at the bar and wander aimlessly at their heated outdoor terrace overlooking Union Square. Servers are very chatty - the type who'd come to your table every 10 mins and ask ""Everything alright?"" (then of course you have to stop whatever you're doing to say ""yes, thank you""). But very professional as well. Waiting time for orders to be served is quite reasonable. FOOD. I love the appetizers and dessert. The main courses, I don't care too much about. The Fried Calamari is great - served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce. Also try the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - served with tortilla chips and salsa; Quesadilla - garnished with guacamole, salsa and sour cream; and Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls. Oh, and they have this complimentary brown bread which is very yummy. For dessert, the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake is outrageously delicious. For main course, I'd say the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon Combo - although the steak borders on being too sweet. AMBIENCE. Good ambience - can be romantic or family-oriented. Dim lights. Nice, elegant interiors with lush upholstery. The outdoor terrace offers a great view. Not a very quiet restaurant though, if you're looking for an intimate location.  PRICE. Not a cheap restaurant. I don't exactly remember, but I think average tab per person is about $25-$30. But the main course servings are huge - you can totally share a dish."
Anita L.,"Irvine, United States",1332,4054,3671,1.0,21/4/2005,"Seriously, people should stop eating at this The Cheesecake Factory. The crowds never stop, too many tourists and the food is just awful. The other locations are far better. I have no idea why, but maybe because they do have SO many people coming through they figure they don't have to keep the standards above average. We visited this one because friends were here from out of town. Waited 45 mins for a table on a Saturday morning which wasn't too bad. The food was just so greasy and some of it was cold. Worse of all, everyone in our party except my son was sick, but then he only ate the bread. I even wrote a letter to complain about how everyone in our party got food poisoning from our visit, but never heard anything back. Not even a sorry. We were so embarrassed as we had suggested The Cheesecake Factory because we had a really great experience in Las Vegas and I also don't mind the one at Valley Fair too much. Our poor visitor friends not only got bad food, but being sick (I won't go into the details) on top of it. Service is robot-like with every single server repeating the same line everytime a new round of customers are seated. UGH!"
Vanessa Z.,"Sacramento, United States",205,341,9,3.0,18/5/2006,"This place is ok if you want to wait 2 hours to eat.  Very touristy place, but I must say they have a pretty good view of Union Square if you get a table outside or close enough to the window.  Food is overpriced, but you do get large proportions.  HUGE selection of food.  Their menu is practically a novel.  Food quality is pretty good, but not the best.  I LOVE their Fabulous Chocolate Mousse Cake much better than any of the cheesecakes.  If you want their food and have all night, I say go for it, but if not then get it to go."
Bernard V.,"Las Vegas, United States",23,51,36,3.0,25/4/2007,"I decided to dine here with my friend, we waited for two hours only to be seated outside.. duh, it's so freakin cold.. I said no, waited another hour, finally got a seat, on our table there is no fork, and my knife is dirty. Our waitress was so busy attending others that when we ask for a new silverwares, she's holding ton's of dishes on her other hand. All of a sudden they all went to the floor, sad to witness such disaster that no other server manage to offfer her a hand. The food was great though.. but the service really sucks, and it is so noisy.."
L C.,"San Francisco, United States",2,208,,2.0,18/4/2008,The wait time is alway too long.  The service and the food is hit or miss.   I never sit outside because of all the pigeons (rats with wings)
Yosie G.,"San Francisco, United States",52,267,,3.0,2/8/2007,"I'm not sure why I did this, or why my Cheesecake Factory craving was so at an ultimate high, but I once waited 3 very long hours to eat here. Yup, wait began at 8, got seated at 11PM. Saturday evening, around Chinese New Year, it was raining, what does everyone do, go to Cheesecake Factory. Amazing. I don't even know what to rate this place, cuz the food's not spectacular."
Laura G.,"San Francisco, United States",142,197,5,5.0,29/8/2007,"Unlikely place, but you know it doesn't have half bad Bloody Mary's. Very tasty."
Jon H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,21,,2.0,15/5/2009,"My friend and I came here last weekend before the dinner rush, so we were seated almost right away. I think that and the bread were the only positive things about my experience. The pork chops I ordered tasted like they were soaked in laundry detergent, the fried macaroni balls were still cold inside, and my friend's Four Cheese Pasta was dry and bland. Not only that, the ground was sticky when we walked on it. I probably won't be coming back."
Teo B.,"New York, United States",10,39,,2.0,17/1/2011,"weak 10 $ sangria, bad food. but it looks nice. and tehy have a  nice patio(if you are in that touristy things)  I had a burger,and I was so sick all night after, felt so heavy. sangria was really really weak and the waiter really rude and he looked pissed off for whatever reason. It was December, so we just had to wait 30 min to get a sit at the patio, but our table was a table away from the heater so I freezed my ass out. Really american place, worth no personality. So many great places to have food in san francisco for so less money and in better places with better tables. Never again. ever."
Gran A.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",0,67,,1.0,16/6/2011,"Why wait an hour to go to a chain restaurant that you could go to in any city across the country?  There are so many good locally owned restaurants without the concocted, corporate feel that Cheesecake Factory exudes."
Clarence C.,"Vallejo, United States",0,1,,4.0,7/5/2009,"Where's my cheesecake. A day of shopping for things you need is always nice when you have the time and means to do so and what's even better is ending it off with a great selection of food, drinks and a dessert.  That being said I opted to go to The Cheese Cake Factory to get some reasonably priced food that taste great, a couple of cheap drinks and some yummy cheesecake to top it off.  Little did I know that this would take more time then the actual time I spent walking around Union Square.   Don't get me wrong, the food taste great and they gave me plenty.  (I had the Chicken Madeiri) Most Excellent.  All past the food which was a 5/5 let's move to the service,  I was having a real good time for the most part until I paid my bill.  See it how I paid before receiving my cheesecake that I order Murphy's Law came into play.  My cheesecake is brought to me in a haste and I was surprised. Low in behold it wasn't the right kind.  I was surprised I actually looked inside the bag, I never do, It was like a premonition.  Ok, not so bad right? Wrong?  Upon telling my waiter at the time who had been so nice to my guest and I had now turned into a total Terd.  What the Heck man? I know it wasn't my tip because I always tip generously, this guy must have been having a really bad day to treat me of all people in a bad way.  This guy totally ignored my request after telling him that I had the wrong cheesecake.  I had to personally go up to the hostess and ask her to get me a floor manager or someone higher than this guy who had turned out to be a jerk.  Long story short I had to basically sign my life away to get the correct cheesecake and to boot I didn't even get it for free."
Thea G.,"San Francisco, United States",45,125,3,3.0,3/8/2008,"They are grossly over-priced, their brown bread is delectable however, their avocado eggrolls are amazing, and their mango margarita is to die for. But everything else - eh."
Jon J.,"San Francisco, United States",4,67,4,4.0,20/11/2008,"Cheesecake factory is as classic as Tony Roma's, with their Complete Menu to variation. Their servings are enormous! but its the variation comes in good quality as well as quantity."
CHI H.,"Milpitas, United States",75,57,17,5.0,10/10/2008,"This place is awesome! Beautiful view and good food is the best when youre in good company. It was busy though when my friends and I went here, but probably because it was during Christmas time. We had to wait 45 minutes! All good, that's what the bar is for. We were all in a good zone when we got seated. It's not cheap, but it's not pocket burning expensive either. Order your food, and then get a Flying Gorilla. Trust me. You'll love it. It tastes like chocolate. Oh and mmmmmm, a cheesecake! duh."
Kymberli C.,"Clayton, United States",136,1486,5781,2.0,20/3/2007,"I know it's our fault for coming here on a Saturday evening but we didn't mind the wait for an hour and a half, we just got drinks at the bar, got a little faded... but when we finally got seated our waiter took forever to serve us.  Our food took like 2 hours to come out.. no joke. 2 hours. We saw people being seated way after us and they were served and they left and our food didn't come yet. :(  He even forgot one of our drinks in the beginning and it came out way later too... boo!"
Mike S.,"Austin, United States",106,27,79,4.0,4/12/2007,"This food gives me mud-butt. I always seem to end up feeling really lousy if I eat food here. I think I actually enjoy the free bread they serve more than the actual food. The cheesecake is the bomb though. That really is where this place shines! Also the drink and bar area. Get some drinks and hang out on the roof patio area with one of the best views of the city! Whether it's Peanut Butter Cheesecake, Key Lime Cheesecake or Dulce De Leche Cheesecake, you're at the right place. But if you come in the evening, be prepared for a long wait."
Sarah V.,"Englewood, United States",0,79,,2.0,22/4/2011,"Just your average Cheesecake Factory, but atop the Macy's at Union Square. It's generally filled with tourists, so be prepared to wait a long while. I would highly recommend the outdoor seating area for one of those spring/summer days!"
