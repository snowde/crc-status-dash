deanne n.,"Broomfield, United States",4,17,3,4.0,19/2/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory where ever I go!  However, SF got the nice view of Union Square (especially worth seeing when there's an art gallery event going on), but 4 stars b/c the wait for a table is so much longer here than anywhere else I've been to.  :/"
Chaser D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,2.0,6/4/2008,I went there 3times and ate only once and nooone can take me there again. the best thing about this place is the location. top of macys... you watch union square... its good. the wait is a killer. why should I wait 90mins for a 30mins meal ??? and its pricy too. drinks = weak or the weakest. you need to have 3-4 but thn ended up going to restroom. Cheesecake= overpriced garbage. They don't even make the cheesecake in the restaurant. Totally worthless. service = you need to get a service to rate the service.  first u need to wait to be seated.  second you need to wait for a waiter to come and get your order.  third if he/she gets your order good luck if you can see him agaiin in the next 30mins. ohhh if he forgot something or you need anything... hmm dont worry he ll bring it with the check. they might even wrap it and make it to go if you still cant get it although you pid for it. dont complain just take it home. or eat outside while walking down on powell st.
Rosalee C.,"San Francisco, United States",186,259,499,3.0,9/7/2008,"the miso salmon with rice and yummy sauce is worth the wait... i don't know about 1 whole hour's worth, though. that's the sucky part- waiting. it's so freakin busy here, unless you come in on a weekday at whatever time this place opens."
Ivy S.,"San Rafael, United States",0,19,4,3.0,10/4/2009,"Actually, the wait was not that long and my group was there on  a  busy sunday for lunch. What was disappointing was the service!!! Our waiter was unattentive and really slow. Maybe because they were understaff that day. The food was alright but not great. We had the calamari appetizer plate which was good. The turkey burger was so so. The black out cake was moist and the low carb cheesecake with berries was divine."
R K.,"San Francisco, United States",34,186,16,2.0,28/8/2006,"I dare not ever go to the Cheesecake Factory unless bringing guests from out of town. The food is not good, the palce is expensive, and the plates comes in way too large of portions. The place is packed on top of Macy's. The only redeeming value is that the place has lovely outdoor seating that has a nice view of Union Square."
Erica B.,"Oakland, United States",22,33,27,2.0,9/5/2007,"I really wanted to like it. The Cheesecake Factory has always been my old faithful in any city I've been to. It's been near and dear to my heart since I was introduced to the Cheesecake Factory my freshman year in college. I was expecting the tasty food and drinks that I am accustomed to getting at any other CF, alas this one failed to meet the mark. Lets start with the drink. Since it's been as hot as blazes in the Bay Area (nope, not complaining), I ordered a nice refreshing mojito...except it wasn't. It mostly tasted like rum, lime juice, and sugar. I likes my mint so I was very disappointed by the mint shavings that were floating around in the drink. Food wise, the Buffalo Blasts were what earned most of the 2 stars for this visit, because really, how can you mess those up? I'm pretty sure they come pre-made. My entree was less than stellar. I got the crusted chicken romano since my favorite dish (Pasta with Pesto, Chicken and Mushrooms) had been removed from the menu. So the chicken romano was bland, the waitress didn't offer freshly grated parm (which I wanted) and as usual, the portion could feed a small family. I was expecting the cheesecake to save the day, but again, denied. My cheesecake was broken in places and it seems as if they attempted to stealthily cover it up with whipped cream. It tasted like cheesecake, which was good, but the presentation left a lot to be desired. All in all, this is probably the worst CF I've ever been to. While the wait time was decent (20 minutes on a Tuesday night) the food and service was not. Will I go back? No."
ELIZABETH W.,"San Francisco, United States",45,112,5,4.0,21/7/2007,"I live in San Francisco and i enjoy a meal from a chain restaurant every once in awhile...yeah that's right I said it.  Although I have never eaten in Cheesecake Factory I have gotten take out from here numerous times considering it is across the street from my work.  Today I got the chicken avocado club with fries and man was it good...greasy, but good.  The bread was buttery and grilled with the perfect amount of ingredients in the middle.  When I feel like spoiling myself at lunch I get take out from the cheesecake factory."
ILSC S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,4.0,7/4/2011,"Last Saturday I went to the Cheesecake Factory on Geary St. with my friend. It was my frist time visiting there. Maybe it was around 12PM, so it was very crowded. If I had been there with many people, I mgiht have had to wait for a long time. It was noisy but lively. I liked that mood. Also the décor was sophisticated.  We were able to choose where we wanted to sit like on the terrace or inside. We chose to sit inside, but if you choose the terrace, you can see all of Union Square. The food is not cheap but the portions and taste are really awesome. Before the main course, pieces of bread come out for free.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak, and Pasta Carbonara. It was around 35$. The steak was little bit salty but it was tasty. The Pasta was also delicious but there was not enough sauce, so we asked the waitress for more.  The servers were mostly kind. The only thing that bothered me was eventhough it was that even thought it was Saturday at lunch time, it took a long time when I asked for something.  Overall I recommend people go there,  It will not be a waste of money or a waste of time."
Renate V.,"El Cerrito, United States",78,81,11,4.0,18/7/2007,"I love to take my son here at Christmas and sit by the window with the fog and drizzle outside.  It's a fun place with some good fancy diner type things.  The popcorn shrimp are great, and so are some of the salads and sammies.  I could not eat here more than once or twice a year, but for the occasional buzz it is quite good, and the food is consistent.  If the place were not such a zoo, I would come here on a reglar basis just for the salads,  If you have not tried them, you should."
adam m.,"Newtownards, United Kingdom",7,77,1,3.0,9/9/2008,The ridiculous waiting time for a table doesn't inspire you to give great reviews and neither does the pricing but the food itself was pretty good and the helpings nicely sized. The servers seem to be everywhere you look but never anywhere near your table when you need them. If you are after good American food then this place is a great example but there are plenty of alternative restaurants nearby offering better food in the same price bracket.
brendan w.,"San Francisco, United States",1,4,,4.0,23/3/2009,"Really enjoyed it! big selection and tasty food just what i was looking for.   If your in a hurry this is not the place for you, no reservations an all. and to all those people complaining about the portions being too big...REALLY! just dont eat it all."
Carolina H.,"San Rafael, United States",70,98,99,4.0,10/6/2008,"Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance is all I can say. My friends and I came to have dinner on a Sunday night and it was delicious. There wasn't much of a crowd and the views were spectacular!! The service was mediocre but when your with friends you tend to forget about that. Not a huge fan of Cheesecake but the girls said it was good!"
rosemarie l.,"San Francisco, United States",20,55,,3.0,7/6/2008,"the service here sucks!! i decided to order a salad to go for lunch.   Criticisms: 1.  it took nearly 10 minutes for someone to take my order.  there were  two employees standing 3 feet from the register chatting away.  i know they saw me because i saw them glance over a couple of times. 2.  as i was placing my order..i felt attitude from the employee.  not even a hello, it was like ""what do wanna order?"" 3.  i know that cheesecake factory is busy..but wtf, i just ordered a salad and how come it takes nearly a half hour to get it.  do they pick the salad greens from their garden in the back of the restaurant.    when my salad did finally come (i was feeling hypoglycemic at this point).  they didn't even tell me that it came,  luckily i was watching the employee bring a to go bag  to the counter, praying to God it was mine. i've been to the cheesecake factory factory in honolulu, maybe some of the aloha spirits they have needs to rub off onto the employees in san francisco.  what kind of impression do the sf employees leave for the many tourists that frequent there? as for my salad itself, it tasted darn good.  maybe because i was starving. as the cheesecakes, they're out of this world!"
liz c.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,3.0,4/1/2009,"Saturday afternoon wait - only 45 minutes!!!!! There were 11 of us, so this actually was a great surprise. Our waitress was a sweety, kept up with the bread, was patient with every order and even took the time to refill my water. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad, one of my favs, but sounded excitingf because they added blue cheese crumbles and sun dried tomatos! I did see there was also mixed greens in the description, but when it came out I was quite surrised when the greens took up over half the plate. I was hoping for more tomato and cheese, it was the dish title after all. Think I am allergic to something in the mixed greens, but the tomatos and cheeses were yummy. Our waitress took the liberty of sending back one person from my party's lunch pizza. too crispy she said. but we didnt get the fresh one until only greens were left on my plate. nice idea, but not very efficient.  Good experience for such a large group."
Sarah C.,"Redwood City, United States",335,284,124,2.0,20/12/2005,"If you're going to eat there DO NOT eat outside unless you're a pigeon lover. The pigeons literally eat their meals right next to you. If you shoo them away they come right back. I lost my appetite completely last time I was there. The foods okay, but not great."
Mai G.,"South San Francisco, United States",5,84,3,3.0,15/8/2008,"its cheesecake factory on top of macy's in downtown sf. cheesecake, where ever it came from, is always good to me. there is a lot to choose from, dessert and entrees. american food to asian. ok to visit once in awhile. prepare for a looooooooooooooooooooooong wait."
Kevin S.,"San Francisco, United States",405,1595,278,1.0,25/3/2005,Ack!  The food is forgettable.  The cheesecake is sort of fluffy and insipid.  The chaotic interior is a turnoff.  The service sucks and it's almost unbelievable that the hosts and hostesses sling attitude at this Disney version of a restaurant.  It's sad that so many flock here when any one of 200 restaurants in SF are better on any given night.
Tiffany M.,"San Francisco, United States",82,373,23,1.0,5/10/2006,"Am I the only person who doesn't like their cheesecake?  Screw the wait, and the service, and the high prices... if you're going to call yourself a factory of anything, you should probably do it well. Their menu may have a creative selection of cheesecake, but the quality lacks. From a chef's perspective, they are scrimping on the creamcheese and passing the overcharging on to you.   I mean really, even if the only cheesecake you have ever made was from the recipe on the back of a Philly package, you know that it can be better."
Jeff H.,"San Francisco, United States",78,297,9,4.0,29/5/2008,"Good luck trying to get a table here during lunch or dinner for that matter.  It's just a major tourist whore of a restaurant.  We came here for lunch and settled to eat at the bar.  I actually do like their food though, but the damn long ass waiting list.  You could always put your name on the list and take your honey downstairs to shop at Women Macy's."
Albert W.,"San Francisco, United States",15,60,3,3.0,19/7/2006,"I've been eating at different cheesecake and at different cheesecake location, to me the food are ok, a little too much sometimes.  This particular cheesecake inside macy is not for local people, it is designed for tourists.  The waits are too long, it is very crowded.  If you have other restaurant to go to, don't go there."
