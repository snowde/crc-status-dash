Tommy P.,"San Francisco, United States",203,346,7,2.0,31/1/2008,"While the location is nice Cheescake Factory has always failed to impress me and this one is no exception. Just seems like they try to cover to many types of food and in the process don't excel at any (except cheesecake). Also the prices here are way to high. Just seems like for the price you pay for food, drink and desert here you could do a lot better, especially in a town like SF with so many fine dining options."
Michael K.,"San Francisco, United States",143,220,18,3.0,17/6/2005,"Yes, it is ridiculous to wait 1-2 hr for a table. But I can't deny the food is scrumptious and comes in an enormous portions. No reservation is accepted. Cheesecake is their trademark and definately a showstopper."
Rego S.,"San Francisco, United States",91,269,37,3.0,15/1/2006,"The best time to come here is opening time, around 11am.  Otherwise, you're in for some pretty lousy service.  I came here at 2:30 on a Friday with my best friend from home, who'd been a waitress for years and picked up on several standards that were completely absent from our meal.  They didn't apologize when we had to ask them three times about a drink before it finally arrived, they didn't bring any sugar for the espresso, there was no asking if they could get anything for us when the food arrived, nor were we ever asked if the food was all right.  On a brighter note, I had the best vinegarette dressing ever."
Jill D.,"San Francisco, United States",473,1113,3,3.0,20/8/2005,"The cheesecakes are the best and so are the avocado roll appetizers.  Love the key lime cheesecake and the portions are pretty decent.  Don't love the wait and the fact that this place has so many issues like water pressure problems so frequently.  But if you need to meet someone unfamiliar with SF somewhere recognizable and don't mind spending the cash, this is the place."
Jen P.,"San Francisco, United States",59,373,457,4.0,9/4/2008,Be prepared for a long wait! ... usually 1 - 2 hours on weekends or friday nights. But on Mon - Thurs. its usually 15 minutes. They offer big portions for a fair price. The crispy crab wontons for appetizers. Steak Diane for entree with a Lemoncello Cream Torte is the best meal here.
Michael S.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,38,,4.0,5/2/2009,"I like this place. I don't mind the wait and the menu has something for everyone. I've always had good service and I like the atmosphere. I don't think that there is a better location in all of san francisco.     I'm a pretty easy to please when it comes to food, but this is still one of my favorite places for a reasonable meal."
Diana T.,"New York, United States",28,106,14,4.0,6/11/2007,"love love love love the view from the patio. have been here two times since i moved to san francisco, both times i've eaten on the patio (right next to the glass!!). food is always delicious. service is great, smiley/friendly waiters.   my party never has to wait because of a trick i've discovered.. muahahahaha.... o yes, the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake is simply divine..."
Mike L.,"San Francisco, United States",29,105,42,3.0,24/8/2006,What's up buddy? Hey listen I've been to this place and well its not bad. I know that its for tourists and its a chain but its not way cruddy. A buddy of mine drink 2 gallons of milk here in less than an hour and the ribs here are great too. Cheese cake here is ooo la la
Max S.,"Beverly Hills, United States",0,24,,3.0,22/11/2010,Just a regular Cheesecake Factory. You get the good quality you expect.
Carson H.,"Atherton, United States",23,393,,4.0,23/4/2008,"I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory, but if you have out of town guests, snag a table outside on a sunny day and have some drinks . It has the best views of Union Square in the city."
Nicole R.,"CA, United States",13,414,,4.0,22/1/2007,"The only time I go to the Cheesecake Factory is when I have a lot of time to spend at lunch/dinner and have tourists with me. I mean, it IS a fun restaurant...it's on top of Macy's, it's always busy, the concept is fun, you know?  The food IS good, and the menu is HUGE. I usually just order appetizers, and my meals are usually randomly put together like potstickers and mini burgers and sharing some calamari with a friend. But this place is always very crowded, so don't go if you want to dine quickly or want to avoid the masses.  A lot of people hate on it, but I think it's pretty good. But the crowds of tourists and absurdly long wait for this place makes me stay away, unless I've got some family in town who really wants to go."
Steve M.,"San Francisco, United States",82,35,,1.0,8/1/2010,wanta know the worst words i can hear.. mass produced food. bla bla bla. tooo much crap at a good price.
charlene l.,"San Francisco, United States",12,49,,2.0,11/12/2006,"the food is totally disgusting and greasy.  the cheese cake is good, but not that good.  the line is always so long, and the service is bad.  great view of union square though. to me, cheese cake factory just screams yuppy tourist trap.  only worth it if you are seriously craving cheesecake."
Starr R.,"Berkeley, United States",2,20,,1.0,11/1/2009,"I can't really comment on the food or the prices at this particular location, when I decided to come here for my birthday last year I was told that I would have to wait 3 HOURS for a table. I left in a hurry, there is no restaurant anywhere in the world that is worth wasting 3 hours waiting just to be seated. LAME."
Victoria G.,"San Francisco, United States",33,111,,3.0,6/4/2008,"I grew up in the suburbs so I love chain restaurants.  Sue me.  They're the only places that can get away with all of that fusion bs, magically turning some sort of salad or pasta dish into something azn.  The wait is generally an hour long because you have to give the morbidly obese out-of-towners ample time to finish up their meatloaf and double chocolate cheesecake chunks, but once you're seated (especially on the outside patio overlooking Union Square), let the comfort food feeding commence.  The wine selection ain't too bad for a place of this caliber, so get a glass of the Wild Horse pinot noir while you're waiting for your table and savor the fact that you live in SF and the other fools in the restaurant don't."
Scott G.,"Brooklyn, United States",30,424,9,2.0,31/7/2008,My most recent experience here sucked.  Our server never brought us a glass of water we asked for and then managed to fuck up our bill my doubling everything we ordered.  This place gets WAY to hectic and crowded with tourists and others I don't wish to be with.  Not worth the 50 minute wait.
Teddy D.,"Flushing, United States",17,74,23,4.0,30/3/2008,"Dunno 'bout the food, but the view from the outdoor patio overlooking Union Square, i.e. Coach, Chanel, Gucci, Goyard, Saks, Barneys, Nieman Marcus, did I mention you are on the top floor of Macy's? makes it a must-see. Hit it after viewing the Macy's flower show (wherein I spotted one scene that had two Spanish matadors looking longingly at one another while a woman reaches out for one of the men in apparent despair at losing him to the arms of another man. Wait. . . tell me this wasn't all just my overactive imagination.) If you want a table - or even an elevator - be prepared to wait, as this place is always crowed."
Justin H.,"San Jose, United States",147,25,3,4.0,9/7/2008,"Great food and friendly service!  Came here one night for a friend's birthday and the wait was VERY long, but luckily they had a nice outdoor patio area with a view so the wait wasn't too bad.  I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories but I still haven't tried their cheesecakes yet.  Need to come back here someday when its not so packed so I can get a slice :P"
Marco M.,"San Francisco, United States",29,396,116,3.0,22/11/2005,"If gluttony was a restaurant this place is it. Salads and burgers are good, enormous portions though. There are enough varieties of cheesecake, which you could come back every week for a year and still not have tried them all. The only thing that's really a bummer about this place is, you acquire a pager when you arrive and told to wait 45 minutes. Well, at least you can walk around Macy's."
