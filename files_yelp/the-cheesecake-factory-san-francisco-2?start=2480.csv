Kyla B.,"San Francisco, United States",105,151,2,3.0,16/8/2006,"It is what it is and being that I'm pretty picky about the quality of my grub, the frozen, preservative-packed fare here is never my first choice.  However, sometimes it cannot be avoided.  On these occasions I will turn a blind eye to all that I know is unholy and blissfully tuck into the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad."
Juliane N.,"San Francisco, United States",636,596,765,4.0,4/11/2007,"Wait is long but I always like it here. Yea it's a tourist trap but it never seemed to bug me. Tex mex roll, kobe burger, chicken avocado egg roll, chicken marsala or bbq chicken salad are yummy. Portions are for two and you can have another meal at home for the price of one. i try not to go for dinner since the wait is horrendous! Lunch is a better option with the same menu."
Pickle R.,"San Francisco, United States",329,741,69,3.0,6/3/2009,"yeah yeah, i should know better, but i wasn't paying.  :}  had champagne and the meat and cheese platter and not much really to complain about, other than being a tourist for about an hour."
Marc E.,"Daly City, United States",63,172,4,4.0,7/10/2008,dang! thai lettuce wraps are a meal by itself!  good stuff!! the ahi carpaccio is to freakn' die for!! i want it...now!!!!! the jamaican black pepper shrimp was awesome!!  cheesecake! mmmmmmmmmmm!! so many to choose from!
Jh M.,"San Jose, United States",26,175,6,3.0,18/4/2010,i hate reviewing chains - just wanted to say this place has a great view of union square - and its entrance is strategically located on the furniture floor of macys - plop down for a food coma nap afterwards
Michelle W.,"Cambridge, United States",33,241,,3.0,30/10/2006,"a great place to go after catching a show at the warfield.  that late at night, you'll actually get a seat within 15 minutes as opposed to the usual, what, hour?  no kidding!  =D it's the cheesecake factory.  everything on the menu is  probably good.  i only had appetizers.  fries and the mini-burgers (comes with 4).  kind of heavy for late-night nosh, but no major compliants. UPDATE: looks like wednesday nights are also a good time to frequent the factory of cheesecake!  20 minute wait!  booyah."
A W.,"San Francisco, United States",187,187,8,3.0,12/5/2007,"I've never been here without there being a 45 minute wait...or 10 Marina Girls at the bar. The sweet corn tamale cakes--and the cheesecake of course--are always the best part of the meal!  The main dishes are ""eh,"" partly, I'm sure, because there aren't too many choices for vegetarians. The atmosphere is fun; you take the elevator up from Macy's to the restaurant... and it is so pretty at night from the balcony!"
Mariangela S.,"San Francisco, United States",174,608,2,2.0,22/8/2005,"I admit, I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants in my day. The best one is still the original in Marina del Rey. When I lived in Boston, they opened one in an upscale mall - and the wait was 3 hours! Cheesecake Factory has an amazing business - it is the model of efficiency and branding. The menus are bound and include advertising.  It is a tourist haven though, and the wait in Macy's can last for hours. I don't have the patience, so it's a rate occasion I go there. Ok, well I was there recently. Everyone else waited for an hour, and I showed up when they were already seated. The healthiest thing was the fish tacos - although it could have fed 6 people! Trust me, stick to the fried items, frooffy drinks, and the cheesecake!"
Alex L.,"Los Gatos, United States",309,365,9,4.0,1/12/2005,"Come just for the view!!! It's a gorgeous view of the city. Places like Cheesecake factory are a little mainstream for my tastes and there's usually a wait, but it's worth. Consistently good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff and THE VIEW!! :)"
Al L.,"Portland, United States",10,218,1,4.0,7/4/2007,"So many sore reviews for this place!! Yes, the wait is long, but it's right in the middle of Union Square, what else would you expect? Service is great, and once they accidently gave my friend and I dinner portions for the lunch price. I find the long menu to be an asset rather than a downside, especially if you're with a group of people who all want different dishes. Their dishes are not 'culturally authentic,' but they're absolutely delicious, which is all that should matter when you decide to set foot in a place called the Cheesecake FACTORY. Eat outside if weather permits, because you really can't get a better view of the city from this side of the square."
Courtney P.,"Hercules, United States",37,29,2,3.0,10/1/2006,The long wait at this place is too long considering the cake is not out-of-this-world good. Not worth the hype.
Jessica W.,"San Francisco, United States",27,169,,1.0,29/8/2006,"i poop on this restaurant. sorry excuse does not belong in san francisco. long wait, stuck up staff, asshole management... my boyfriend went here to get a raspberry cheesecake. they didn't have any. pecan, then would be fine. they ran out. and so on and he was quite frustrated by this lack of cheesecake variety at the cheesecake factory. hmmm.  whyyyyyy??!!!  I offer you these alternatives that are nearby: Fourth Street Grill, Osha Thai, MacArthur Park, or for christ's sake, look on Yelp!!!"
Christy M.,"San Francisco, United States",53,218,,4.0,27/3/2007,"I like this place for the view from the terrace, Union Square, right across from Tiffany's, it's really nice. Wait time is atrocious, but the food's decent, the drinks are good, and it's a fun, laid-back atmosphere. If you can get up early enough, their Sunday brunch menu is nice (waffles, pancakes, fruit, eggs any way you could imagine)"
tulipa L.,"San Francisco, United States",17,38,,3.0,9/5/2007,"I have had actual meals here 3 times, cheesecake from here many times. meals? not so good, unless you get something heart-attacky like the fried macaroni. the peanutbutter cup cheesecake is digusting in concept, superb in execution."
Nancy P.,"Concord, United States",16,90,,4.0,14/11/2007,I love the menu...and the decor....the service is slow...and it is always crowded...don't think I have never had to wait for a table.  It is a fun festive place...perfect for birthday celebrations...worst part is trying to decide which cheesecake to order!
Tony L.,"San Francisco, United States",58,86,7,2.0,26/3/2008,"I am a local and don't have a decent dessert and coffee place in my neighborhood here in Visitacion Valley.  So I stayed around my workplace and trudged down to Macy's on Union Square.  If you crave cheesecake, be patient as there is a monumental wait.  I had Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake and it was delicious.  I read the reviews regarding the overpriced drinks and kept with the tap water.  Service was surprisingly fast and efficient.  They even checked with my table quite often to refill the iced teas."
Chris Y.,"South San Francisco, United States",15,33,,3.0,28/8/2010,"Great view, great vibe, great service. The wait times are long, especially at peak hours, and the menu is a little too big for my taste. The food portions are big and the food is usually pretty good, but it's also pricey. If you sit outside beware of the pigeons!"
Jonathan L.,"San Francisco, United States",221,39,7,4.0,27/1/2008,"First off - the view outside on the patio is worth the extra wait. On a cold night, the outdoor overhead heaters are a perfect added bonus.One of my fondest memories is a family dinner taking place on a beautiful San Francisco night at this spot. I actually didn't eat the cheesecake.. I thought it would almost be clich so I got something un-cheesecake for desert and ended up thoroughly satisfied. Bravo."
