cindy L.,"San Francisco, United States",3,19,,4.0,1/7/2008,"Never Ever Failed Me. BUT, i do take off a star for certain things that i find to be a tad too pricey. like.........$6.95 for a slice of cheesecake!  sure its good stuff but still!   I ve never had a dish here I didnt love.  Luau Salad- MMMMMMMMMMM  Even my picky eater mom said it was good when i shared my leftovers.  (Portions match Price.)"
Deliah L.,"San Diego, United States",0,4,,1.0,20/10/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. However, I went to the one located in the Macy's recently and it was terrible. After waiting for over half an hour, our buzzer went off and we got stuck waiting around some more once we turned in our buzzer. My real issue though was with our waiter. Didn't catch his name because he did not bother to tell us. This John Hamm-looking employee sits us down and walks away without even taking a drink order. In fact, he never asked what we wanted to drink. We just added that to our food order as well once he finally got around to doing that. He did not write our order down so I was not surprised when he forgot my drink entirely. This guy never smiled and was far from friendly. He looked extremely pained if we asked for anything at all. He did not offer us dessert, and big surprise, when we asked for dessert he looked very annoyed. This was the most disrespectful waiter I have ever seen. This is byfar the worst service I have ever received and I certainly will not be going back."
Shannon W.,"San Rafael, United States",3,227,,3.0,14/5/2008,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco tons of times.  It nice to go there for a nice lunch if you want a break from shopping.  This place has EVERYTHING- their menu is huge!  The service is okay ( how can it be great- it is always SO crowded!)  It doesn't take too long to get a table, but then again I've been there only on weekdays.  But if you want a spectacular view, go- you can see all of Union Square!"
Max C.,"Columbia, United States",59,124,,2.0,26/4/2005,"I love BIG food, but this place can be tiresome..."
Zell C.,"San Francisco, United States",70,425,23,2.0,17/8/2005,"I don't understand why everyone loves this place (okay, maybe 75% of its customers are tourists). The wait is ridiculous for some pricey, mediocre food.  I do admit I hold a special place in my tummy for a slice of cheesecake, but that's probably the only thing I'll ever get here. When friends drag me along, I usually order the lemon herb chicken or the chicken marsala. One word of advice: Don't ever order the fish tacos."
Andrenaline R.,"San Francisco, United States",19,210,,1.0,24/8/2005,"Food is bland and made for tourists. I would never eat at this place, if it wasn't for friends who don't know any better than to go here for their birthdays."
Adam S.,"Livermore, United States",28,87,7,3.0,17/11/2005,"The wait was long, but with good friends and a nice outside view (it was nice and sunny), it was bearable.  I had the Pumpkin Cheesecake that was good and the Tiramisu which was good as well.  The only problem was the portioning, it was to much.  SO MUCH WHIP CREAM!!!"
Lucas M.,"San Francisco, United States",116,94,5,3.0,7/2/2006,"Always stunned by the waiting time...and perhaps more stunned that we end up waiting.  Great place to take out of town guests who might not have an adventurous palate, and the portions are huge.  Turn dinner into lunch the next day if leftovers are your thing.  The tourists by the busload can get aggrivating, so try and hit it on off peak dining times."
Edward I.,"Jersey City, United States",67,536,11,5.0,14/5/2006,"Average priced food, large portions and long waits which is perfect when you're hanging out with old friends, gives you time to talk about how crappy work is and realizing how much better your job is when seeing the servers wait on the impatient hungry people that go there. If you're into trying to get fast food and hate waiting, go to Burger King."
Joy C.,"Orinda, United States",72,554,23,2.0,5/4/2007,"The cheesecake is pretty good (esp. tiramisu), food is consistently good, but not worth the price."
May A.,"CA, United States",59,188,,3.0,17/5/2007,The only think I liked about Cheesecake Factory in SF is the cheesecake.  The wait was way to long and food was just okay and a big pricey.  I was disappointed.
Teresa W.,"Millbrae, United States",85,77,8,3.0,23/9/2007,"interior sucks. gives me a headache, but good food. and HELLA good dessert. wait not so bad if you go around downtown to chill hahaha so many weirdos and tourist, which is cool i guess mmmm im hungry now bloggin about this at 1 AM i think im going to go eat my left over salad from there LOL"
Ghiz S.,"San Francisco, United States",27,62,28,4.0,11/10/2007,One of my favorite places to eat in downtown. Try their salmon dish.........it's pretty good :)
Edgar G.,"San Francisco, United States",220,404,9,2.0,21/11/2007,"The food is mediocre, the service is OK, overall it isn't a place I would go on a regular basis. I don't get why people still come here when the food isn't even all that great. I'm assuming the cheesecake is better."
David S.,"Berkeley, United States",3,187,6,3.0,4/5/2008,"Bitchy hostess deliberately said my GF's name wrong. We threw a piece of chewed up bubble gum at her. She was too stupid/full of herself to notice. Food is good, location good."
Ces T.,"San Francisco, United States",8,35,1,2.0,27/12/2009,"was here last Saturday..waited for 100 minutes to get a table,the Front Desk people we're rude and yes the waiter who was assigned for our table was mean..i've been here a number of times before and it wasn't anything like this. the food as always was great it's just the crappy service that made it a bad dining experience. i'll just go to another Cheesecake Factory location next time."
Allie W.,"San Rafael, United States",28,94,1,4.0,7/2/2008,"Yes, it's overcrowded with tourists. And there are so many pigeons scurrying around my feet on the outside patio, that I often worry about accidentally kicking one.  But! The view is outstanding, the portions are large and generally fresh, bathrooms are clean. And Linda's Chocolate Fudge Cake is amazing! Like a giant Hostess cupcake..."
meesh m.,"Walnut Creek, United States",7,72,1,2.0,15/4/2010,Food is not great and alcoholic drinks are mostly just mix. The reason I continue to go back is because it's a good spot for guests to have lunch overlooking union square. Two stars mostly for ambiance. Today I had a decent waiter and food came out quick but I have mostly had poor service in the past. I'm always kind of mad at myself for going because I know the food will be a let down.
jes s.,"Alameda, United States",0,13,,4.0,16/5/2008,"Wow what a huge menu! And I wanted to try it all! Went here on the suggestion of an ex-girlfriend and it was one of maybe 2 times in a 3 month span that she actually paid for our meal! Im tellin ya, this chick was cheap as a mofo! It wasnt until she admitted to me that she used to date a billionaire that I knew she was used to being treated to everything. What a sense of entitlement this chick had...you guys think gas prices are expensive, try dating this chick!   Anyways, enough about the golddigger, Cheesecake factory is really good, I had the caramel apple cheesecake or something like that and it was so friggin good! I also had the quesadilla on a different occasion and loved it. The wait can be 15-20 min on a Fri nite, but its worth it...prettty cool ambiance too and EXTREMELY attentive service.  The waitresses are fairly hot too, kinda young but there aint nothin wrong with that! hahaha More easily corruptible is my motto on that one! Anyways, go check out the cheesecake factory, great family type place....if thats what youre into"
Joanna S.,"San Francisco, United States",68,393,,3.0,15/11/2005,"Despite being a chain restaurant, I like the Cheesecake Factory a lot.  I always  get the Santa Fe Salad, which I find to have the right amount of kick in it.  I also love sitting outside when it is warm on the terrace and looking at Union Square."
