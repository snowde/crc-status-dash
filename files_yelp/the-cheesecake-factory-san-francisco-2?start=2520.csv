B G.,"San Ramon, United States",92,105,1,4.0,15/11/2005,"As much as I want to hate it, I dig the joint.  Yeah the wait is long, if you get there at lunch hour.  I've walked right in and got a table right away on off hours.  Yes, the service is slow, but so is the service in the bahamas and I like my meals to be an event, not an inhale and run.  I don't mind the 2 hour lunch, especially on a Friday.  I managed to snag their Key Lime Martini recipe and it is a big hit at parties.  So there is a chain in SF, especially union square and so it's the Wal*Mart of restaurants but hey, if you don't like it, don't patronize the place.  Go somewhere you like.  Life is too short to drink bad wine, eat bad food or keep bad company.  I dig it, I will go back. bon apetite...I hope I spelled that right because I am too lazy to look it up."
Marie G.,"San Francisco, United States",41,68,27,3.0,3/4/2007,My fave dishes here are Miso Salmon and the super appetizer with everything in it (enought for 2 big eaters or 3 small eaters). Don't forget the Peach Bellini. Worth every penny. Usually the wait sucks but thanks to my addiction to shopping I'll settle.
rice r.,"San Francisco, United States",6,95,13,4.0,11/5/2007,"Food - was okay, like a chain store type restaurant - what do you expect? Service - always nice waiter/waitress, very attentive. Drink - this is why I'm writing this review. I'm a Mai Tai lover. Wherever I go, I order one if available. The MAI TAI from here is actually the best I have ever had. The ones in Hawaii can't even compare. Interesting isn't it? It's only at this cheesecake factory - not any other one. Cheers!"
Arlene C.,"San Francisco, United States",153,408,336,2.0,13/5/2007,"If you don't mind waiting even when you have made a reservation, and taking 2 hours for lunch no matter how early you get here, then this is your place. My favorites are the Crabcake and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon (Chris Rock's favorite) sandwiches. I recommend getting the Shrimp sandwich without the middle slice of food to make it more appealing. The fish tacos are good here too. The Dulce de Leche is my favorite cheesecake. You'll have enough for another meal, no matter what you order. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day and overlook Union Square. So, so food and huge portions. Good place when you need to wear the Terry Tourist hat."
Michelle S.,"Palo Alto, United States",4,28,7,4.0,16/7/2007,"What a great restaurant! After riding an elevator to the top of a shopping center, you find yourself at the cheesecake factory, with a great view of the city and good food. I got the Santa Fe salad, which was very big, zesty and delicious."
Jody A.,"San Jose, United States",29,82,2,1.0,20/10/2007,"It should be noted that I have gone to this location before and had a wonderful time. I have gone to the location in my home town multiple times and had an even better time.  This may come down to one very, very simple concept the SF location cannot seem to grasp: reservations. Valley Fair takes 'em. Why can't the most popular of all CF's in the Bay Area take them? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I'm in San Francisco, one of the most culinarily-advanced regions in the country, I shouldn't be wasting my time here in the first place, but I LIKE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  So sue me.  So here I am, Friday night, trying to have good time at a highly-belated birthday dinner from The Boyfriend (we had Amy Winehouse tickets on a day much closer to my actual birthday, but then she had to go and get involved with that yucky husband of hers and cancel the tour. THANKS A LOT AMY WINEHOUSE).  I meet him after work, cranky and starving, having watched my food intake since the previous night.  And we find out it is an hour to a hour and a half wait. OK, OK, I try not to lose it.  We can...find something to do for an hour... They don't even have a pager to give us because there are so many people there they have run out.  Most of them are obnoxious tourists smacking their kids around and bitching about the rain. So we go downstairs and sit on a display couch in the furniture section.  I am starting to get really mad, so I'm not talking. Great, so that killed about...ten minutes. ""I'm gonna go see what's going on with that pager."" I follow him upstairs. We get a pager and decide to see if we can snag a table at the bar.  It was a long wait, and not worth detailing until the very end when we were only able to sit down after The Boyfriend got into a very vocal and embarrassing fight with someone whom he claims 'swooped in' at the last minute to take our rightful table.  Whatever.  I'm so humiliated and angry at this point I shame him into turning in our pager and leaving.  For the first time in my life, I want to be the bitch that demands to talk to management, but Cheesecake Factory has cleverly made it almost impossible to contact anyone high on the food chain, and I'd feel bad unloading my sob story on some poor hostess, though they weren't doing a great job, either. Cut to a stupid, couple-y fight in the MUNI station and Boyfriend insists we go back up and give it another try. Long story short, we get a seat at the bar.  We order drinks.  Granted I just turned 21 and have never ordered a drink before, but it was pretty disgusting and healthily overpriced.  Bar staff all looked about seventeen.  Waitress (the one with braids) was a TOTAL bitch when there was an issue with the payment. We order appetizers, we order food.  Food was good, but I was so hungry I wasn't even paying attention to the taste.  By the time we were served, at 9:30 at night, the fabulous sandwich I was waiting for for two weeks had become merely convenience food.  I might as well have spent my birthday at Burger King.  This would not have been a problem had The Boyfriend been able to make... say it with me... RESERVATIONS. Thanks, Cheesecake Factory, for the WORST birthday dinner ever."
Tiger Lily ..,"San Francisco, United States",30,340,3,3.0,3/1/2008,portions are great. service is great as well. some faves: pasta da vinci calamari rasberry white truffle cheescake this place is a well oiled machine...they pump it out like nobody's business.
Jenny W.,"San Francisco, United States",6,26,,4.0,4/5/2008,"Amazingly went here on a Friday during lunch and no wait. Unbelievable! Love the avocado eggrolls, chinese chicken salad, mango peach smoothie, and bang bang chicken and shrimp. For dessert, gotta have the Godiva Cheesecake."
Ashley H.,"San Francisco, United States",370,477,11,2.0,22/2/2009,i did not like our server!!!!! when your wit is too slow it comes out as sarcasm!!!!! not funny. what was even worse the whole floor was so damn slippery!!! its like they took grease and rubbed it over every damn inch of that floor!!! and then the table next to us had left and they replaced the table settings but didnt clean up the empty sugar packs on the floor...what a half ass job in keeping ur damn restaurant clean!!! i really had to do a lot to not slip on the floor. boo cheesecake factory for being so damn dirty!!! thats sooo unnecessary
Jessica F.,"San Francisco, United States",4,32,,3.0,29/5/2008,"Was here on Memorial day with my husband and sister-in-law.  The wait was about 25 minutes or so, but they accurately quoted a wait time, which is nice.  The view is fantastic - such a great view of union square - it was perfect for my sister-on-law.  She commented on how great the turkey burger was (and trust me, that means A LOT), and I thought the miso salmon was great.  I wasn't really expecting the food to be that good, but I was definately pleasantly surprised.  The pigeons were okay, but please, do NOT feed them!  I wouldn't want any more than there were already there..."
Ceci L.,"Sacramento, United States",26,114,17,4.0,14/1/2005,"Good place to eat... and the environment is good too... But, expensive, and you need to wait wait wait..."
Stephanie P.,"San Francisco, United States",15,95,,3.0,14/4/2005,"Take out is the way to go... I've never once waited for less than an hour and a half.  Gotta love the huge menu selection, you know exactly what you're getting every time you order!"
Pele N.,"San Francisco, United States",36,348,6,4.0,10/7/2006,"It is a chain that offers huge portions, reasonable prices, huge selection and very good food.  Located on the top of Macy's in Union Square, get your self a drink for your two hour wait and enjoy the view or go downstairs and go shopping for a while."
Anya B.,"San Francisco, United States",11,71,,4.0,27/7/2006,"If you have out of towners coming to visit, you can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory:  a) view of Union Square b) shopping downstairs c) variety of food - everyone will find something they like e)  what else? cheesecakes!"
Diane S.,"San Francisco, United States",822,269,44,3.0,29/9/2006,"The food is actually really tasty for a chain place...but of course, it's a tourist trap. So...it gets super packed and the wait is ridiculous, however, there are not a ton of places to stop and re-fuel on a serious afternoon of shopping. I will eat here again because I like the food and I need to eat before attempting to shop at H&M down the road...so though I don't love it here, it serves it's purpose."
Its a S.,"Concord, United States",6,46,1,1.0,26/11/2006,"Spare yourself the disaster of this place. There was a three hour wait when we went with a thousand people standing around everywhere. We ended up snagging a bar table which we got by hovering over these poor people trying to enjoy the end of their meal, which we experiences towards the end of our nasty meal as well. My friends pasta tasted like pure salt and was the worst I've ever had. My fries were horrible and I was very disappointed with that whole place. This is my favorite restaurant ever but I will NEVER return to the one in San Francisco!!!!  I do have to say with a more positive note that the Bikini Martini was awesome so I guess if you happen to be in Macy's for an afternoon drink the bikini martini is the way to go."
miriam b.,"San Francisco, United States",114,1315,1,2.0,29/3/2007,"i knew the architect's mom, but just go to a cheesecake...fatt butt factory in la-la-land..(translate for you: chicas in Los Angeles order iced tea and their boyfriends order the whatevers because the chicas watch their figures in the SiliconedHollyBollyland of muchoplastica)..you're gonna have a faster chance at getting seated and served before they call your name in this place. heard you can sometimes find their pumpkin cheesecake at Costcos..."
Bill B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,96,3,3.0,18/6/2007,"The waits are long, food is average at best. cheesecake is delish. There are soooo many better choices in San Francisco."
Adela K.,"Los Angeles, United States",22,127,,4.0,14/8/2007,"the cajun jumbalaya with fettucine (and extra sauce on the side!!!) is killer every single time. everyone else at the table was complaining about SOMEthing, but i was too involved in my own euphoric state to hear them.  the cajun jumbalaya is like HOME to me, ok?! it also helped that i was the last one in the group to arrive (i was the farthest away!) and didn't have to wait for a table.  so i didn't begin my meal with pent up road rage..."
Eileen L.,"San Francisco, United States",344,1307,15,4.0,10/10/2007,"I went with a few of my friends for a birthday. The food was very tasty and looked very appealing to me. I recommend the four cheese pasta. It was delicious. Although, I suggest avoiding the green tea smoothie . It tastes good at first but when it melts, it tastes pretty funky. The cheesecake wasn't very good either. There is a lot to choose from on the menu and they all look pretty delicious. The price is pretty fair considering the quality and it fills you up . They open pretty late for a restaurant and have a nice view to look at too. I give this place 4 stars because despite the good food, there is a very long wait. You can't make reservations and you usually have to wait at least 1-2 hours because they're almost always busy. Also, they have very poor lighting. Too dark. It gave me a headache. Overall, I would go back. I think this place is worth a visit."
