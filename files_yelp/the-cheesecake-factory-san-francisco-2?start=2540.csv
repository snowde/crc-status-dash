Frank N.,"Campbell, United States",9,163,2,4.0,20/12/2007,"This use to the cool place to have dinner in the city.  But now everywhere you turn theres a Cheesecake Factory.  The view of Union Square is Awesome! Especially during winter time.  This restaurant still has the best location of any in the Bay Area.  The food is pretty good and in decent proportions.  O yeah can't forget about the strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  This is kind of a tourist spot, but I don't mind."
Erik W.,"San Lorenzo, United States",12,32,,3.0,14/2/2008,"When I'm hungover, I walk over here for the take out. The Tons of Fun burger has Tons of Grease so I recover quite well. Good to eat nearby if your in the city frequently like me because of the large menu and choices to fix your cravings. Your not going to get the best dining experience at a Cheesecake Factory, but food works for me. Too crowded at this one."
Clarissa P.,"Oakland, United States",23,10,,4.0,8/2/2008,"Love the extensive menu, although I usually end up ordering the Chicken Madeira.  Generous portions.  Love the martini specials: good size, perfect amount of alcohol & delicious as well.  Love the view from the patio. Service is hit or miss depending on how busy it is. Hate, hate, hate the wait for a table & at the bar during peak times."
Jennifer L.,"Snohomish, United States",2,54,,2.0,19/3/2010,"The hostess staff here was really rude.  While we were waiting over an hour for the table they said would take 30 minutes, I watched one of the hostesses put on a big fake smile for each customer and immediately after they turned away she would roll her eyes at them.  Does she not realize that there are other people watching her besides the person she is currently talking to?? Geez.  In addition to that, the hostess staff seemed really unorganized.  They said it would take 30 minutes for a table and we waited an hour before our buzzer went off.  After that we were told that we had to stand over to the side to wait for our name to be called.  It was another 15 to 20 minutes before we were taken to a table, which only happened after we checked twice to make sure they hadn't forgotten about us.  The food was ok, and the server was nice enough, but it's hard to get past this first impression."
XoXo X.,"San Francisco, United States",0,73,,4.0,14/3/2008,"I have never been to this restaurant here in SF cause I'm from LA.  My Xo told me that it was on the top floor.  I was amazed because it was inside Macy's where I can do a lil window shopping.  We both wanted some sweet fixation so he took me here.  We took the elevator & once we came in, it was soo crowded.  We just ordered 2 chocolate mousse cheesecake to go & took it downstairs to eat.  We both couldn't finish them so we were better off by just ordering one instead."
Jelly G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,67,,3.0,26/1/2008,"It is just fun to dine there. Big potion of food, and hundreds of cheesecakes! They should be able to take a reservation, tho. The longest I have waited there was four hours."
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, United States",570,1888,1488,3.0,30/7/2009,"This is my least fave Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area. Why? Because every tourist goes here. Even though we're not supposed to, I still go down one floor to Macy's and sit on the couches. HA."
Raj K.,"San Francisco, United States",7,155,3,3.0,3/5/2006,"Never having been here before, I decided to give this place a shot. Now lets get the negatives out of the way first. The line almost never-ending kept us at almost a 30-40min wait. There seemed to be very few SF natives, mostly tourists, not a bad thing though cause of course thats what san francisco is all about. Now the good stuff, the portions were huge, and oh of course if u love cheesecake this place won't dissapoint....."
Tony A.,"Southwest Ranches, United States",7,55,,2.0,21/8/2006,"Superlong wait, the food was just ok at best. My hamburger was lousy, the meatloaf was off...The only good things were the waitress who was very perky and the deserts were excellent. Will not wait over 15 minutes for this place again."
Kara F.,"San Francisco, United States",4,30,,2.0,19/12/2006,"I have never seen the appeal of this place.  From the second you walk into Macy's the entire experience is annoying.  First you wait forever to get in the elevator.  Then the people who got on the elevator last, get out first, and therefore put their names on the waiting list before you.  Taking the escalators up 8 stories is not practical either because of all the slow-walking Macy's customers.  Then you get upstairs and have to wait forever to get seated at a cramped table and have to wade through 100 pages of menu to figure out what you want to order.  The food is not bad, there are just a lot better places to eat while shopping or playing around in Union Square (like the Nordstrom Caf!)."
Ryan C.,"Berkeley, United States",22,96,5,2.0,22/2/2007,"i've been here 3 times, each time sucked. I don't get the hype, is it cause it's on top of a fuckin macy's??? Service is horrible, food is horrible, one time my food was even cold. However, they make damn good cheesecake. I like the godiva cheesecake."
Marie F.,"San Francisco, United States",0,46,1,3.0,28/4/2007,"Service is slow, the wait is horrible, the food is okay, the drinks are overpriced and good luck getting one!  A place where you find a congregation of the bridge and tunnel crowd, especially on the weekends. But the view is priceless.... and I can 'dump' my man at the bar while I go shopping downstairs at Macy's!!"
Nick A.,"San Bruno, United States",29,58,,4.0,4/6/2007,"Everytime I go here there are two common factors: a long ass line and .......great food! Although I am a picky eater and don't really have a nack for trying new foods, I can't turn down the Chicken Littles...oh man, those get me...The staff is usually nice but sometimes I'm waiting for the little things..like the bread and refills on drinks"
Oribel ..,"Daly City, United States",2,97,,2.0,20/6/2007,"2 stars just for the view off the deck (outside dining area). We went here last night, split an entree of Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onions in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce) for $14.69. It sounds good right? It's not. Since we have been waiting for 50 minutes to be seated and we were really hungry, to kill the time we were just hanging out at the deck. The deck was wonderful though. We could see the beauty of San Francisco especially since the sky was clear. Unfortunately, the food was not great (and this comment came from someone who was really hungry waiting for 50 minutes at which point any mediocre food would taste great) The pasta was dry and lacking of sauce, it really wasn't worth for the price. The chicken had gristle and was tough. The complimentary bread basket was much better than the pasta. (Now I'm longing for Pasta Primavera). I believe even frozen pasta could have been better than this. We also got Key Lime Cheesecake which was good. Don't come here for the food. (I would choose Elephant Bar's food anytime over Cheesecake Factory's) Don't come here expecting free or easy parking because there wasn't easy. Don't come here expecting to be seated soon. The waiting time is unbelievable. Tips: The best bet to find parking is at Union Square parking garage which charges $2.50 for 1 hour, $5 for 1-2 hours, $8.50 for 2-3 hours, and so on (I don't remember). With the usual long wait at the Cheesecake Factory, you can expect to stay around 3 hours. But don't worry, you don't have to bring cash to pay for the garage because the machine accepts credit card (Master, Visa, Discover, Amex)"
D L.,"San Francisco, United States",7,217,,3.0,1/12/2007,"This place is just okay, nothing particularly exciting. Basic fare with a wide variety of choices, but the concern is, how good could all those dishes be since there are so many of them? The cooks behind the scenes couldn't be experts at making all those dishes. I tend to order the same thing each time I go which isn't very frequently. I like the pasta dish with chipotle sauce, chicken & peas. The portions are pretty big so I usually eat half & save the rest for lunch the next day. I tried a kahlua coffee cheesecake & gagged after the first bite, so I told our waitress that I didn't like it & it wasn't what I expected, and asked her to take it off my tab. She did so without any hesitation or fuss. Be prepared for a wait because I don't know of a time there hasn't been one, especially with all the holiday shoppers this time of year.  During the warmer months or occasional heat spell it's fun to eat outdoors on the deck where they also have space heaters."
Lynn P.,"San Francisco, United States",44,106,4,4.0,30/1/2008,"Love the cheesecake factory. best burger, salads and fried calamari ever! little disappointed on the pastas. hate the long wait for dinner but it was worth it."
sofie W.,"San Lorenzo, United States",0,65,1,1.0,29/11/2006,"If you want to eat their food, don't ever take it to go. We always had a good time dining at Cheesecake Factory and the food was pretty good. It is maybe because if you eat there, they tend to cook carefully because they don't want you to complain or make a scene if the food is not good. The first time i ordered to go because i was craving their pasta. First, the cashier told me that the wait time is 20 minutes, then in 5 minutes i asked her if it is too late if i wanted to change the spaghetti with angel hair pasta. They said it was too late because my order was almost done.  Then i waited 25 minutes, i didn't see my order, i asked her, she said, oh 5 more minutes, i waited again for another 15 minutes and when i asked her again about my order. She looked confused and went to the kitchen. She told me it would be ready in another 10 minutes. Apparently, they didn't cook my order, so they speed cooked my order and even forgot to give me the bread and the sauce for the pasta. I didn't bother to check on my food, i went home 30 minutes later and was starved to death. I was so pissed to see my bistro shrimp pasta. It was the most gross pasta i've ever had. It was so dry, no sauce at all, no taste, basically it was just a pasta with a few shrimps.  I was so mad, i was about to call the restaurant, but my husband calmed me down. He ended up eating my dinner (with extra alfredo sauce we have at home) and i cooked myself an instant noodle. What a waste! The second time, i told myself that i would give them a chance, i ordered louisiana pasta. This time the pasta came on time 20 minutes with bread. However, the pasta was still the same. It was so bland, no taste at all and too dry. I ended up put extra sauce at home. I think jollie bee spaghetti is even better than this and cheaper!"
Lisa N.,"San Francisco, United States",14,47,,4.0,27/1/2007,"I went with a group of friends for a birthday celebration expecting this place not to live up to the hype, but it actually did. We got there around 9:30 PM on a Thursday and only had about a half an hour wait, which is pretty rare for The Cheesecake Factory. Great food, decent service, and absolutely blissful cheesecake. Tiramisu fans, get the tiramisu cheesecake. I think I reached a perfect state of zen/nirvana/whatever you want to call it. You will have leftovers and you will not regret ordering a $6.50 slice of cheesecake."
S N.,"San Leandro, United States",14,153,122,2.0,31/12/2009,"It's too bad they don't take reservations after 5:00pm(?) We were a party of five, when we arrived about 7:00pm & we were immediately  told the wait is 1.5 hours. Since it was my daughter's birthday & this is where she wanted to eat. We decided to wait. If it was left to me I would not have waited. We got our name in the system & was told to come back in 1 hour & they would issue a beeper when our table was ready. So at 8:00 we got our issued beeper & roamed downstairs in the furniture dept where everyone else was sitting & waiting since the bar was jammed packed. When you get to this point the wait time zooms by. We got seated in least than 10 minutes. Once we were seated outside terrace they have several heaters going & the view is really what your there for. There was a group of women celebrating something right next to us & being very loud celebrating. The menu is really extensive with much to chose from. Our waiter Chris was very attentive & was willing to give advice on food selections., he was the bonus. We started off with crab & cheese won tons which came right away. If you are hungry this dish appeases the taste buds. Most of us ordered pasta by now the time was 8:45. My husband & I decided on sharing carne asada dish that comes with tortillas. I know not the kind of food I really wanted to eat. The food is more on presentation than taste period. At dessert we ordered their famous cheesecake, my daughter recieved a banana cheesecake with ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate! Good touch there! We weren't all overstuffed afterwards which is a good thing since the time was 10:30. All in all if you want the tourist experience then try it. But be very prepared to wait!"
Trisha H.,"Reno, United States",63,258,16,3.0,19/5/2009,"One of my fav resturants...but not too sure if I like eat at this particular one. We did go on a Friday afternoon, if that makes a difference, but it was beyond packed. The wait wasn't that bad, 20 mins and we roamed the furniture section in Macy's for bit. Then decided to go back and wait in their very small waiting area. Everyone was jammed in there. Finally seated was just like we were waiting. We were seated by the bar and people continuously roaming around. A couple even sat at our table to wait, they asked of coarse, we said that it was fine. But the Staff ushered them out quickly or not really out, but away from our table. There is just not enough space to accommodate the volume of people. SO if you have been to Cheesecake someplace else, leave it at that. This place is the same as all the others. Same food, lots of people....maybe only different is, if you set by the window or outside, you will get a view!"
