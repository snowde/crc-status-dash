Dave R.,"Oakland, United States",0,26,,2.0,6/11/2006,"Had a 2+ hour lunch here, because the service was so slow.  The best part was when the server finally arrived with our drinks, the glass of red wine had ice in it.  Not a few cubes, but filled with ice.  He then tried to tell us (straight face & not kidding) that that particular syrah is always served  with ice.  We had to convince him to double check that fact.  Five minutes later, we get a glass of wine sans ice.  I know that he was new there, but how new do you have to be to serve red wine on ice?"
zoe w.,"Sydney, Australia",0,34,,4.0,5/6/2007,"well, the reason I give 4 star is because this place is absolutly great despite I never wanted to step into a American chain restaurant. I've heard about this place and passed by in other cities many times but never wanted to go coz I just don't beleived in American chain. However one day I saw this on TV and I heard they have 14 types of cheesecake on menu! (though I later found out the cheesecake is just ok and expensive....) But the menu is amazing, and the pasta was absolutly delicious (Spicy Chicken Chipotle?) I normally don't order pasta when I dine out coz I can cook better one than most of the restaurant. but this one was really good. btw, the service was great and nice, and I waited for less than 15mins so I finished the menu while I was waiting (there was seat outdoor but I didn't want my food to be blowed away....)"
Allen B.,"San Francisco, United States",8,25,,3.0,20/11/2007,"So Two Stars for Speed of Service...Three Stars for Meal so I spect this is a good average, huh? It never fails that I will waddle out of here full of Thai Noodles and cocktails. And those long islands...there has to be a separate rating system for those :)"
Kayla T.,"San Francisco, United States",155,7,,5.0,5/2/2009,By far my favorite restaurant of all time! Their salads are bomb! The menu is endless so there is something for everyone.  The portions are huge.   The service is always great and I love the decor.  The only down side is they don't take reservations.  I've waited up to two hours on a Saturday night.  We didn't get seated until 12:30am!  It was worth it though!!!
Peter L.,"San Francisco, United States",235,42,24,4.0,18/9/2009,"the food is really good... i love the avocado rolls, that's what i always ordered here every time i came here... and i always order the fettucini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes, but i tried the other foods liked i liked it sometimes it's a pain to wait inline cause they're always so busy... and you have to park in the parking lot and it's expensive..."
J C.,"Bay Area, United States",155,242,1,1.0,20/3/2009,meh. just meh.  always crowded and takes forever. I always feel rushed when Im here...the only reason i come here is after some evening event and this is the only place opened.
Tootie p.,"San Francisco, United States",0,25,1,5.0,1/2/2008,ashlee simpson ate here tonight. so cool!
Dominik Z.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,2,,1.0,31/1/2010,"Let's see, long wait times, messed up food orders that take too long, robot staff, and not to mention the over priced food. The food is super fatty and makes you feel sick. Also what is up with the staff pushing cheesecake on you as if they are going to get fired if you say no. No means no! I don't want to hear about the types of cheesecake and what they are made with. Ooh, and lets not forget about my favorite part of ccf in sf; the cockroaches! Have you never noticed the cockroaches on the walls, well maybe you will when they climb onto your table!~ I have no idea why anyone would ever want to eat there. Oh, and they don't take reservations!"
Jenny A.,"San Francisco, United States",4,16,,4.0,30/1/2010,"My husband and I have been going to Cheesecake Factory since we first started dating and it has not yet disappointed. Their cheesecakes are of course the best, but their pasta dishes are my favorite. I'm not a big fan of their meat dishes since I can go elsewhere for larger, juicier portions and not pay as much."
Andrew T.,"Rome, Italy",381,441,11,4.0,23/8/2008,"i actually despise cheesecake but i LOVE the pasta's here. its a great location and there is not much better in the city than eating good food outside over-looking union square about 20 stories up. the wait is definately long, but what do you expect for a chain restaurant in union square? the good thing is they give you a beeper, that has a pretty good range(you can go shopping at macys and still feel it vibrate). i love coming here for lunch when they have $7.95 lunch portion pasta's(still a big portion). definately a fave of mine"
Michael R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,2.0,15/10/2007,"The wait here is crazy on a weekend.  Good food is a hit or miss here.  They have HUGE servings of food.  So take your pick of either ""quanity"" or ""quality"".   The thing that rawks my socks off is the ""Thai Chicekn Salad Wrap"" with the yummy sauces.  I do advise you guys to steer clear of the green one.  It tastes as green as it looks.   The cheesecake is worth coming for.  The selections are just too much.  That's why you should bring your girlfriend/wife etc...and order a bunch and just pig out."
Michelle I.,"San Francisco, United States",869,620,21,4.0,20/6/2005,"you know they're doing something right when you show up on a sunday night at 10:30pm and there's a 30 minute wait! (on a sunday?) how many restaurants in SF can say that? its insane how busy they are and i'm sure they're making money hand over fist.... the tropical drinks are really one of my favorite reasons to come. i also adore their salads. its like 3 times the size any normal person can eat, but thats ok, you can bring it home with some cheesecake.(i normally hate sweets but absolutely love their peanut butter cup one) my favorite place to wait is standing right above the 'm' of the macys sign. whats more fun than to people watch union square while drinking a monster size tropical cocktail here on the patio."
Nicole F.,"Eastvale, United States",4,64,14,5.0,22/7/2009,"I remember, without knowing, just ordering an handsome size of Caesar salad with dressing without meaning to; it was A LOT of food!  You get so much food that if I ever do take it home, it just ends up soggy, or worse, in the trash.  However, this will serve as a warning for next time, a lesson learned, that I will focus on spending money on the main course and, of course, on the cheesecake.  In addition to their signature dessert cakes, I would, hands down, recommend the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer.  Overall, this venue is located in an excellent location (on top of Macy's over looking Union Square), and I'd like to think that it's not as hectic and crowded as it is during the Holidays, once around the time that I visited.  The servers are excellent as far as serving your food on time and presenting themselves professionally (prepare to tip big!).  The inside is subdued, romantic, yet family-friendly.  You can get the option for a romantic feel by arriving in the evening, or just take the family out for a lunch, early dinner outing with some nice cloud-obscued sf weather."
Nelli K.,"San Francisco, United States",61,42,3,5.0,29/5/2009,"mmm, i love the chesscake factory. mmmm avocado rolls."
A C.,"San Francisco, United States",1,11,,4.0,31/5/2008,"the inside of this place is sick. at night though its dark as hell, no idea why. but the food is good, and u get obscene sized portions. people that rated this place keep whining about having to wait dumbass long for a table... which is true, but we dont have that problem since we know people that work there and the longest we've waited for a table was like 5 minutes. the cheesecake is top notch.. the caesar salad is so huge it looks like they use 2 heads of lettuce.. its a big ass bowl of salad that u can never finish. one of the best locations (macy's rooftop) overlooking union square. to avoid those long ass waits dont be a moron, and make reservations."
Al B.,"Los Angeles, United States",20,474,59,4.0,26/12/2008,"This is a very cool location. It's always busy and there is almost always a wait (20-40 min usually), so expect that. If the weather permits and you are so inclined, ask to sit outside on their patio. You get to have an open-air view of Union Square and the surrounding hotels and skyscrapers. It's pretty unique. Service is adequate although because the restaurant is so busy, the servers never seem to get a chance to breathe. Breakfast is pretty amazing. Their brioche french toast is to die for. The omelettes are also very good. Portions are very generous. Lunch and dinner are also great. The Luau Salad is very fun. To enter, you will need to take the Macy's escalators or the express elevator from the ground floor from the Geary St. entrance to Macy's. As for parking, the Union Square garage across the street is probably your best bet. There are other parking structures in the area as well."
Jose C.,"Richmond, United States",48,211,47,5.0,28/9/2008,"i went here last friday for my birthday with a freind of mine to eat this place is actually preatty cool the wait was kinda long about 30 minutes but the views of downtown san francisco from there padio made it all worth the wait it,s on the 7th floor of macys in union square in downtown san francisco when we finally sat down i ate some chicken pasta and a cheesecake for a desert it was really good i,m giving this place 5 stars because of the views of the city the staff was really freindly and the service was not that bad even if the place was kinda busy i will definatly return here in the future...."
kimberly w.,"Sebastopol, United States",0,46,,4.0,11/6/2009,"yes-- of course the bay area ""can do better than that.""  and we do.   however, if you find yourself downtown with multiple generations in tow-- kids want burgers and fries, someone wants a salad, and someone else wants a hearty dinner plate-- there's no better place to go to solve that argument. honestly, all of the food is pretty good.  the healthy salads (with the unfortunate name, ""weight management salads"" -- how much did they pay a really bad p.r. firm for that one?) are very good and have enough protein to satisfy.  drinks are pretty strong.  bread is good. cokes are refilled obsessively.   biggest fault is that the food is often oversalted.  that's probably why the kids like it so much.   with a fab view of union square and a fairly efficient beeper system for the usually long wait-- this is a super choice when downtown and in need of a decent meal at a reasonable price.  many of these dishes can easily be shared (they are mostly huge) which makes it even more economical.   would i suggest this place to my foodie friends or for an amazing adult date?  no.  do i go there when we need something to eat in a pretty atmosphere, with tourists or relatives along?  it's perfect."
TaDao V.,"Seattle, United States",50,78,20,1.0,30/6/2007,"If you've ever had to wait for 45 minutes for table at a restaurant, you'd think the place would be pretty effing great. Not so at the Cheesecake Factory. Anyone waiting for anything at the Cheesecake Factory deserves to suffer dysentery. This place sucks for so many reasons. Have you seen the people wanting to eat here? They're ugly. Not only do you have to wait with the lowest 5% of the gene pool, you have to decide among which of the 500 ridiculous entree choices you want to throw up later. Come on! Commit to some genre of food you sloppy bacteria producing glutton factory!  The portions are stupidly large, the quality mediocre at best. The food sits under a  food lamp to develop the right amount of salmonella before they slap it on your table. And don't get me started on the service. I'm sure the Cheesecake is running a job training program for the homeless. I hate this place. I even hate the cheesecake."
Emily X.,"San Francisco, United States",85,116,4,3.0,1/9/2007,"I agree that the wait can be kinda ridiculous and the service will ultimately suck, but i'll admit it, i kinda love the cheesecake factory.  i don't go to ccf for ambiance or good service.  I almost always get the avocado egg rolls (tons of avocado and sun dried tomato in a won ton wrapper), or the popcorn shrimp (i am so not a popcorn shrimp person, mainly because I hate those maggoty looking bay shrimp  most places use, but ccf uses real shrimp, not maggots) or the artichoke (sooooo good, yummy garlicky lemony dipping sauce).  For the entree we usually share the BBQ ranch chicken salad with extra onion strings (black beans, corn, chicken, pico de gallo, avocado, and ranch and topped with yummy yummy o-stings and a drizzle of BBQ) or the the tostada chicken salad (similar to BBQ ranch chicken salad but no o-strings, the salad sits on two crunchy tostadas).  I used to get this one dish called chicken brochettes that was sooooo good.  They make good cocktails here, albeit a little too sweet and kinda pricey.  I almost never save room for cheesecake, and a few hours after I leave here I;m cursing myself for not getting it to go.  Even if you're stuffed, get the damn cheesecake to go, you'll thank me later."
