Merredith L.,"Noe Valley, San Francisco, United States",553,935,28,3.0,28/7/2008,"i hadnt been to a cheesecake factory in yrs... i went yesterday on a sunday evening around 5 something pm.  it was pretty much like the boston one i'd been to. a billion year wait (ok, 45 min but still). they got rid of the lemon drink i used to love. it tasted just like lemons. so that was sad. they did have that delicious brown bread i love. the menu is large, full of american food selections. i had chicken romano. the chicken was good.  i had asked for angel hair pasta but got spaghetti instead, which i'm ot a fan of, but i didnt feel like waiting to get more food, so just skipped eating the pasta. i had some of j's mango raspberry drink and it was good so if i ever come again, i'm getting that. service was pretty good, everything was fast once we were seated, no complaints. i just wish they took reservations instead of making people wait for sooo long all the time."
molly n.,"Oakland, United States",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2008,"So the only reason I ate here was because it was my friend's birthday and it was her choice.  It was a nice day out and they have a great patio (which is the only reason for a star.)  We waited twenty minutes to be greeted, which our server came over and said, ""I'll be right with you.""  Then we waited twenty more minutes for our order to be taken.  Another twenty minutes later we get our drinks.  All around us tables are getting their drinks and even bread.  If we had bread at least it would make the twenty MORE minutes we waited to get our food go by faster.  Unfortunately, we didn't get bread until we got our food, which one of the orders was wrong.  It was a fair enough mistake, turkey club instead of the chicken club.  The manager came and apologized, comped our drinks and offered a free dessert, but we never had the chance to order it because we got our check before we were done with our food.  The whole experience was pretty comical.  I understand that sometimes restaurants are understaffed, servers get in the weeds, servers are having bad days, whatever, I've waited tables before, but be nice and apologetic when mistakes are made.  It's a huge part of the job.  Having a flippant attitude to customers is annoying and rude and gets you bad reviews."
Joon L.,"Brookline, United States",0,11,,4.0,18/8/2009,"I'd like to say as a big cheesecake factory fan, that this is the best cheesecake factory i have ever seen. They work late and hours and did i mention that view on top of the macy's department store is aboslutely gorgeous? The service is very very good and i highly recomend to go there"
Barbara O.,"Martinez, United States",88,25,,4.0,2/3/2009,"Maybe it's just me but I've never had a ""bad"" experience at the cheesecake factory. Probably because I do realize that it is a chain restaurant so it's pretty absurb to think that you're going to get some ""to-die-for"" meal at this place. That being said I came here about 2 weeks ago on a weekday (I think it was a wednesday). We waited a little bit, but it couldn't have been longer than 5 minutes. We asked to eat outside since I had never done that before. I lucked out cause I got to sit right next to a heat lamp that actually did a good job keeping me warm. My friend and I each had one drink, split an appitizer, and each had our own piece of cheesecake and we ended up with a 50 dollar bill. But I must say, we were still pretty full. I personally like the cheesecake so I was satisfied. The only slightly annoying part of the night was the server who kept coming back every 5 minutes to check up on us. I like people to be attentive....but that was taking it to the extreme."
Ashley F.,"Redwood City, United States",23,164,12,4.0,17/3/2008,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times before, but this was my first time in many years to the SF location. I went on a Sunday afternoon, there were tons of people. Our wait was 40 minutes, which at first made my heart sink because I was super hungry, but actually it wasn't that bad. I was able to scope out all of the food as the waiters passed by so it gave me some new ideas on food to try. Our waitress was super nice and funny. Her great service made up for the semi-long wait. I ate sooo much I felt sick afterwards, but the food (fried chicken breast sliders) and dessert ( strawberry shortcake- it was bomb, so delicious) were so good I didn't want to stop! If you're impatient, don't come here. And also if you're at all claustrophobic don't come either, the tables are very close together - one thing I don't like about the restaurant set up there because your almost bumping elbows and you don't really get much privacy."
J G.,"Richmond District, San Francisco, United States",55,222,,2.0,6/10/2006,"WTF? It's the same food all over the Continental US! Why the hell would you wait in line for hours to have the same meal you could have anywhere else in the US? The menu is like the Hitchhikers Guide paperback and completely overwhelming. The service... wait... what service? It's like fast food amplified. Sorry, the cheesecake might be good but I just don't have the patience."
Emma H.,"Portland, United States",13,43,1,4.0,20/5/2007,"Come on, you all have to admit that you've brought your friends here when they come to visit.  I mean, I'd never go with local friends, so tourist friends are the perfect excuse!!!  The food is actually pretty good, and it lasts me for a couple meals.  Oh man, I even admit to taking touristy pictures with my friends out on the balcony with Union Square in the background.... wait, I never said that."
E. C.,"Santa Monica, United States",1,22,,3.0,2/12/2008,"To reiterate what others have said: this place is a madhouse!  Packed, packed, packed, all for average-quality food.  Here is a hint: if you don't want to deal with the 90 minute wait, just hover around the high tables near the bar area on the left side.  These are first-come, first-served, and they offer full service.  So, be on the lookout for people finishing their meals and grab one of their tables.  Has worked for me."
Marina K.,"San Francisco, United States",111,255,1,2.0,16/8/2005,"I actually like the food here. Out of the 300 things to choose from their menu, I think I've ordered about 10 different things, and haven't hated any of it. I just cannot allot more than two stars for any restaurant that consistently has at minimum of 30 minute wait time, when there are EMPTY tables in the dining room! I swear they do it on purpose, to build up the hype among the tourists. The service is usually subpar, often times requires one to repeat their order after the server has put in the request, re-request your drinks, and sometimes they'll even forget about you all together. And their dishes, while tasty, loses their appeal when you see it's massive Denny's type portions. Each dish can feed 3 people!!! And is 1.5 days worth of calorie consumption, oh and stay away from the salad, it looks like someone's garden got hoed up and put on a plate. But like I said, I have enjoyed ever meal I've had there. Definitely split your plates though, or expect to take a doggy bag home. My fav dessert there is not the cheesecake, but actually the strawberry shortcake. They use real buttermilk biscuits, and vanilla ice cream with strawberries. VERY good, and not too sweet. Oh... also, as a small note, you can tip the hostesses to get a seat slightly quicker... 15 minutes instead of the usual 30+"
Jose D.,"Pittsburg, United States",4,31,3,5.0,2/3/2009,i think this cheesecake factory is very good the service was good the food was Delicious and all the food food we ordered got to our table FAST!! also the wait was not that long and the atmosphere was very fun and comfortable and the waiters were very kind whether you are looking for a fast bite or a long dinner this is the place to go.
angie c.,"Berkeley, United States",0,46,,2.0,12/2/2008,"I've been here several times. I don't really mind the long wait to be seated. It's expected at any restaurant in a busy, tourist-loving city during a rush. Having said that, I think service should be at least halfway decent especially when dishes are like $20 each and a slice of cheesecake is nearly $10. It generally is. Sadly, service here is not always consistent! I usually get decent waiters. Not awesome, but decent. They're nice, get the job done, some small talk, etc and I usually tip them 20% or more. But this one time I went, we left something like $.83. It actually wasn't my idea. My bf insisted we leave nothing, then decided it'd look more humiliating if we left some coins instead of nothing. He used to be a waiter at Pf changs (and was really good at what he did) and the lack of service REALLY pissed him off. So here's the summary of our lunch: First of all, we're just given sourdough bread. We ask for the wheat too. The waiter told us they were out. I see other tables with wheat bread in their baskets. Okay..so maybe they ran out before we got seated so I'm just indifferent to the whole situation. But then later we see other waiters with their bread baskets that included wheat bread. We request wheat bread again from our waiter (we had to hunt him down), he says their still out (didn't even go check). This guy flat out LIED to us. I mean...if you're going to lie, then at least be smart about it, asshole. So here I am already annoyed before I even decide what I want to order. Waiter comes back to take our order and leaves. We sip on our drinks while we wait. Then we sip and wait some more.  Appetizer finally comes. We eat and wait some more. Sip and wait. And during all that waiting, he didn't stop once by our table to check up on us. Food finally comes and not as hot as it should be, obviously sitting in the window for a good few minutes before it was served. Our drinks only have ice in them by this time. He literally dropped off our food and left, not taking notice of our now empty drinks. We ended up asking a busboy to refill our drinks 'cause our guy was too ""busy"", and by ""busy"" i mean laughing with his other waiter buddies. The same busboy got me a new fork later on 'cause I had dropped mine. Something's wrong when the busboy is doing your waiter's job too. And it's pretty f'ed up."
Lisa M.,"Brooklyn, United States",27,151,10,3.0,12/12/2006,"well... there is technically nothing special about this restaurant, but for some reason no matter what the occasion is, we end up here. your birthday? celebrate with cheesecake factory. your dog died? drown your sorrows in a slice of godiva. your mailorder bride finally came in? bring her and the gang on over the see huge american servings and the slightly too high prices we pay for them. the waits are long, and the buzzers only sometimes work in the rest of macys proper. but i'm sure i will see you there next time my friend get her gall bladder out or something."
tim y.,"San Francisco, United States",31,193,6,3.0,11/7/2008,"for what it is ... a las vegas emporium of comfort food, it delivers!  long lines and waits, tourist and people celebrating something ... rooftop is the best and somehow we lucked out on this san francisco mild evening ... shepards pie, plump buffalo wings, so so corncakes, but hey, we are not boulevard nor pretend to be more than we are ... so all parts being equal ... do it just once, and only if inivited and you can blow half the day or night hanging with a cocktail; service is servicable ... no more no less, this is the factory!"
Matt G.,"Albany, United States",1,155,,4.0,21/1/2008,"3.5 stars. Good food, creative drinks, solid service. Parking is pricey garage across street. -1 star for always having a ridiculous wait list."
philip l.,"Castro Valley, United States",27,23,,4.0,17/6/2007,"the food is great ,but the wait is a killer,but thats ok ,just walk to the bar and get a drink! nice place to eat  ,if your really want to wait 15-20mins!"
JJ W.,"Montara, United States",1,22,,1.0,14/8/2006,"I agree with Roseanne W., this place represents everything I don't like about america.   There are so many reviewers that said that this is a great place for tourist.  What?  With the plethora of amazing authentic restaurants in SF, you want to take your visitors to a chain restaurant that serves bland standardized food?"
Jerry T.,"San Francisco, United States",16,98,,1.0,18/2/2008,"The food sucks.  If you are in san francisco and you are eating at cheesecake factory, you either have no taste buds or are a tourist.  Even the food is suitable for prisoners in the 'hole' or people who have lost their sense of taste and are regaining it back, the cheesecake (obviously) is pretty good."
kiki b.,"New York, United States",66,220,11,4.0,22/7/2007,"menu is overwhelming, especially if your already a little drunk.  got take out, would never be crazy enough to wait and dine around the best and biggest of middle america.  pulled pork sandwich hit the spot, the crab cakes were surprisingly good (yes i got bbq pulled pork and crab cakes, don't judge me, its called beer munchies or vodka red bull munchies)  anyway you all know its a tourist trap, it's on top of MACYS for crying out loud.  accept it for what it is and go if you want to.  but do not expect it to be something its not ,as you enter Macys to get to it ."
S T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,59,,2.0,27/1/2009,the food was just not that good.  i had a dry sandwich with salad that had way too much dressing.  the fries that came with my friends lunch was good but that can't be too hard to make.   surprisingly we were able to get a table quickly on a weekday during lunch hour.  our server was pleasant and the cheesecake we got was pretty good.  2stars because i guess i was just expecting more from the food and was let down considering the price.
Victoria A.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,1.0,22/1/2009,"I had a terrible experience. Unfriendly staff, overpriced food, fake McDonald's atmosphere. It's a food factory indeed. Never going back."
