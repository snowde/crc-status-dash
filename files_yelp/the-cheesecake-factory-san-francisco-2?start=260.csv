Lola D.,"Concord, CA",18,10,27,4.0,12/23/2016,"Came in about a week ago on a Monday night...busy! Were told about 45 minute wait for a table for 2. Got a table at the bar while waiting. Ordered the avocado roll and burger (cooked medium-rare when asked for a medium). Lagunitas IPA could be a little colder. Can't help that it's so crowded and busy during the holidays. However, they played lovely Christmas songs and Christmas decorations were up. Nice and efficient staff Pros: Fun place to take out-of-town guests because of the spectacular view of Union Square Tip: Probably best to avoid during the holiday season and weekend evenings"
永林,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/13/2017,"There are many people, so we wait long time here.  I really like their cake.  I want to take my friend to go to Cheesecake Factory next time."
Justin Y.,"San Francisco, CA",552,440,486,3.0,12/6/2015,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory, but this location is more of a tourist spot with all of the out of towners eating here. Because of this the wait is ridiculous. For a party of two you can wait 1-2 hours for dinner.  They do take your phone number so you can go shopping and they'll text you prior to your table time. All else aside the food is very good. They have good appetizers, entrees, drinks, and of course cheesecake, but because of the wait I don't think I'll come here too often."
Kabir G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",21,2,,5.0,6/7/2017,"We ordered the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken, a vegetarian burger, some drinks and a cheesecake. The food was pretty good and quite reasonably priced."
Judy C.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",25,62,,1.0,7/1/2016,"This place is not good for groups of bigger than 4, despite what it says on the website. My party of 8 waited 2 hours to be seated on a Sunday night. Yep, we stubbornly waited from 8:00pm until 10:00pm. Why didn't we just go somewhere else? Because we were there to celebrate my birthday and rather than wandering around downtown SF for another place that *might* have space for us, we decided to stay put and wait it out. When I told the hostess how long we waited, she replied, ""Yeah, we don't normally accommodate big groups."" Then why does it say so on the website?! By the time we were seated, they were out of half of the things we wanted to order from the menu.  Food was just like any other Cheesecake Factory: big and American."
Ivy E.,"Oceanside, CA",1,15,14,2.0,5/8/2017,Food took so long to come out and we only ordered desserts. Our drinks also took forever!
Timothy H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/23/2017,"It's a really busy time of the year and my girlfriend and I are here for a mini vacation. We decided to come here for dinner before a show. Obviously, there was a wait but once we were seated, we were very glad we waited. Our server, Phillip, was amazing (best goddam waiter on this side of the Mississippi! Give this man a raise and a promotion). Super nice guy and always came by to check up on us and let us know about the food and whatnot. We really appreciate the attentiveness of him and the kindness he showed us. Definitely made our experience the best. Will be back for sure!!"
Ceecee M.,"San Jose, CA",136,195,170,2.0,12/6/2015,"This place is crazy busy!!! We decided to stop by for dessert to wrap up our evening in SF. We were hoping to enjoy the view, but were greeted with a line out the door to see the host. We decided to take our chances with the bar opening seating and got lucky!!  I ordered the strawberry shortbread dessert and was not impressed. It was three large sandwiches with about half a cup of strawberries, three scoops of vanilla ice cream and a mountain of whip cream. The shortbread was not tasty at all. It was overly salty and way too much. The strawberries were glazed with syrup. I honestly do not recommend this dessert. My bae had the mango key lime cheesecake. I had a small bite and it was you would expect from the name.  The crowdedness of this place was almost a little stressful. I'm glad I tried it, but don't need to again."
Jason G.,"Auckland, New Zealand",0,5,,4.0,6/3/2017,"The meal sizes are generous and the service was good overall. Expect long waits at peak times, with limited seating while waiting. As you'd expect, the cheesecake is good and you have plenty of options. Some prices are omitted from the menu, so be sure to ask if you're on a budget. Beware that a 4% surcharge applies for ""employment related expenses""."
Nishad J.,"Cupertino, CA",417,193,452,3.0,4/27/2015,"Great view of the city skyline. That's basically what you're paying for! Great staff! Really friendly and accommodating(seated us outside close to a heater and took some great pictures for us)!  Wish they had a dedicated separate vegetarian menu/more options in general for the Non-Carnivores! I ended up getting Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which was really very bland and boring.  The mango key-lime cheesecake, on the other hand, was great!! In conclusion worth coming for the views and the cheesecake!"
Sarah T.,"San Francisco, CA",261,288,176,2.0,12/4/2014,"I used to be a real fan of The Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. How couid I not? They had like a hundred different flavors of cheesecake, and actually really decent and yummy food. In recent years though, the crowds have become way ridiculous and it looks like they're starting to cut corners on all the recipes I used to love. They just ain't that great anymore. WAIT TIMES: We dropped by the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday (on hindsight, not the best idea) and were seated after a 45 minute wait. They have a nifty little system where they text you a few minutes before your turn so you can do some shopping while you wait, which is nice. The servers though, are totally snobby and rude, but I guess they can afford to be since there are 1283719 more customers willing to take your place if you dare to complain. FOOD: Sigh. This is where it all went down hill.  Normally, I would be happy to wait for a plate of Cheesecake Factory's signature delicious garlic noodles. That garlicky flavorful butter sauce, piled high on al dente spaghetti? Delicious. Droolworthy. Amazing. Dare I say it? One of the best plates of American spaghetti I have ever had. This time though, the garlic spaghetti sauce was terribly diluted, it looked like sad egg noodles in watery soup, and tasted just about as bad. So bummed that they would do that to such an amazing recipe! Is that only true of this branch? Do the other branches serve it in all its original glory? I really need to know! We also ordered a bowl of guacamole - which was pretty pricey, but generous in portion. Unfortunately, the guacamole was seriously underseasoned and lack luster. Bummer. The standout of the meal was definitely the tuna tartare piled high on mashed avocados. It was really delicious. All in all, an expensive and disappointing experience. Now I have to start searching for a new comfort food joint D:"
Scottie B.,"San Francisco, CA",33,62,15,3.0,8/22/2016,"I stand by my statement if you're just visiting: go find a more ""only in SF"" place.  Less of a wait, more ambiance, solid wines etc.  The type of experience you presumably flew out for. But if you've been living here 5 years and your friend really wants to go for his birthday, here's the deal: ==The good== The cheesecake.  So good they really should consider it their main selling point.  Not just keep it in the name, but damn well serve it before anything else.  ""Can I get your cheesecake order?  After that's out I'll come by and see what you'd like for drinks."" The food is decent.  Not ""best dish ever"", but flavorful, varied and in (too?) large portions. The drinks are a good mix.  Nothing amazing, but you should find something here you'd like.  But it'll have a weird twist: eg Moscow mule...with pineapple!  Like your one friend who insists on making up new drinks. The price is decent.  Especially for San Francisco. The service is great.  Servers are incredibly friendly (despite the tsunami of strollers and Fisherman's Wharf apparel), come by frequently, and have solid recs.  And despite the large crowds, we never felt rushed to turnover the table. CakePay.  It's an app, where you can simply pay and leave.  No awkward waiting for the waiter.  And you can check off items and send them to your friends if you want to split the check.  It's super simple, and I sincerely hope they license it for non-Cheesecake Factory places. (yeah, I know OpenTable and Cover exist) ==The bad== Good God the crowds.  No reservations, 25 minute wait for a buzzer, 2+ hours for a table, and a bar that is trying but just too damn small.  I get it, if you're the landlord this is awesome: all these people with nowhere to go and time to kill and sitting at the top of a five-story mall.  Next time I'm paying a TaskRabbit to deal with this. The bar/bathrooms/waiting areas.  These places are understandably minimal, but overtaxed by constant at-capacity. The food.  I know I said ""good"", but it also tries a little too hard on a few dishes.  Each dish was like five flavors.  Avocado + chicken + zesty spices + mayonnaise + mashed potato + ...  My wife claims the corporation is supposedly super innovative at creating and incorporating new dishes, and I believe it.  But sometimes less is more. The ambiance.  Chains are supposed to offer the same value at all locations, so they have to look and feel near-identical at all locations.  But c'mon, you got a killer view.  A few tables have window views, but the overall place feels lifted from the back of a Toledo mall circa 2007. The wine.  Again, a regional snobbery thing, but Sonoma is not far away.  You could have some really great wines on the list.  I was surprised to see only a few local estates (including the Cheesecake Factory Reserve).  There may be distribution issues here, or maybe it's just all in keeping it in the chain."
Liseli C.,"San Leandro, CA",3,4,,5.0,4/29/2017,"It was my first time at this location and isaac was our waiter he was awesome please ask for him, he was so attentive. They have the best passion fruit mojitos ever!"
Manuel G.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,16,1,1.0,4/14/2017,I've always liked Cheesecake until now...25 min to be seated in a crowded restaurant  we thought was optimistic... But then 45-50 mins wait on food was ridiculous... We were full on bread way before food came out....no thanks...should have just stuck with deli in union square....
Andrew N.,"Mukilteo, WA",1,13,61,2.0,5/8/2017,Rated a two stars tonight because as a well established restaurant they should not run out of soda. We were also not notified that our Tiramisu cheesecake was sold out until everyone's deserts were already served.
Amir G.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,2,10,2.0,11/30/2016,The service is not like other cheesecake factories I got a pork chop which i can say is among top 10 worst of my life!
Bella C.,"Port Allen, LA",15,49,193,5.0,7/17/2016,"Their lemon raspberry cheesecake is awesome! The service is good, friendly staff and great view. Perfect place for a chill day with friends."
K H.,"Webster, NY",0,22,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Been here several dozen times. I do takeout with pickup out at the curb. The last visit was so bad that I am considering never coming back. I love the Crispy Cuban rolls. This time the dipping sauce was white and bland, not mustardy with pickles. The French country salad was all bitter red raddicio and no asparagus, 2 tiny pieces of pecans and 2 pea size of goat cheese. No beets! The main course was OK. The manager offered no apology and said Corporate changed the dipping sauce. Bad move if it's true.  Some times the entree varies in consistency as does the size of the cheesecake."
Sarah J.,"Azusa, CA",74,9,1,4.0,5/21/2017,Wait time horrendous. Food delicious! Free bread what more more could I want. I recommend the passion tea and the chicken pot stickers my son loves those. My husband is fan of the green tea.
Michele M.,"Foster City, CA",1,52,5,1.0,7/28/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I been to. This place is swarming with tourist that bunch up in the front and always an hour wait at night. I love their banana cheesecake and so I ordered one and it didn't even come with fresh cut bananas like how I usually get it. I was so upset and to make matters worse, I got a bad stomach ache from them.. Today is the day after and I am still feeling the pains while at work. I ordered the pasta davinci and my boyfriend ordered the steak Diane. I don't know which one gave me a stomach ache... Probably the pasta since my boyfriend is fine. Unless the cheesecake wasn't fresh and I got it from that."
