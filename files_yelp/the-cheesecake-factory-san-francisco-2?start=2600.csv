Yelper Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,98,1,2.0,16/1/2010,"I went to eat at Cheesecake Factory tonight, and I went to the bar section where the seats are first come, first grab when it is available.  So the hostess said if you see a person about to leave at the seat at the bar area, then just grab it, since they do not have a wait list for the bar area.  So I took a walk around at the bar area, and I noticed a table where they just got their bill from their waiter.  So I stood like 3 feet away from them, not even staring at them, since my back was behind them.  The white female beetch customer said out loud, ""Please don't hover around our table, I hate hovers"".  I was not even facing her direction, since my back was behind them, but she knew that I was carrying a pager that shows that I was to get paged for my table.  So, that gave it away that I was waiting for a table, and that white racist beech had the nerve to say that.   The food is good, but Cheesecake Factory really needs to organize a wait list for the bar area, if they tell the customers to grab a table when you see they are about to leave.  I was not even hovering their table, I was 3 feet away watching the television at the bar, but she can tell that someone is waiting by my pager.    She had no manners at all, because it is known that people at the bar are going to grab a seat whenever it was available.  Then, a white kid was waiting there, and she didn't say anything to him, and she gave the white kid the table, she is so racist."
Troy B.,"San Francisco, United States",2,96,,1.0,24/5/2008,At least it keeps the toursits busy so they aren't trying to snag seats at Cortez.
Nelle A.,"Burlingame, United States",216,389,23,4.0,20/7/2006,"i've been to sf, palo alto and san jose cheesecake factory, and i would say their food is consistent. though, the wait can be looonnnggg, it's worth it! love their shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta, all their salads( i already tried 5 of them ), hamburgers and their appetizers selections are all good!! and of course, their cheesecake!!! my personal favorite is their banana cream.."
Katie G.,"Vancouver, Canada",81,105,,5.0,23/10/2006,"OMG, like, this is the best place ever. Kidding...but its one of those places where you get EXACTLY what you are expecting. So in that sense, there is no disapointment factor. I just moved to the USA, but had traveled to various cities in this country about 30 times in my life. And every time I came, I wanted 2 things: Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs. Typical but nonetheless good quality restaurants that cater to American overconsumption just don't exist in Canada - they are cheap and shitty, or expensive and good. The best cheesecake is the Carrot Cake one. Now that I live in a place where these cakes can be shipped, I may be tempted to order a whole one just for myself."
Johnell H.,"El Cerrito, United States",0,5,,4.0,5/10/2008,"I like the cheesecake factory simply for the atmosphere, food, drinks (Georgia Peach), cheese cake and I have never had bad service i just can't always afford bridge toll, and parking."
Jon J.,"San Francisco, United States",188,8,,4.0,29/9/2008,"Only reason why i gave 4 stars is because this one waiter was kinda stuck up to us. We told the manager and she greatly apologize, but other than that the food was great, kinda pricey, but good. Only had one bad time there with a waiter, but all in all its pretty good."
Em C.,"San Ramon, United States",71,301,804,4.0,24/7/2006,"i'm sad not enough people love the cheesecake factory!  you just have to learn to live with its flaws.  like the line.  expect it!  but that certainly doesn't mean endure it.  the best time is a late lunch.  don't bother waiting two hours (unless it's your birthday and really want to make your friends wait for you).  the food is always good.  hey its not gourmet, but that's not why people go here (i hope).  portions are definitely large, but that's what a to go bag is for.  last time i enjoyed the barbecue ranch chicken salad.  sitting on the patio on rare perfect blue sky-almost-warm days are splendid.  take the cheesecake to go, you know you don't have enough room to eat it right then and there.  there are so many different flavors to choose which is great since not all get sold at barnes n noble cafes (tip: cheaper and smaller slices sold there!)"
charlotte s.,"Stavanger, Norway",92,1233,31,3.0,4/9/2006,"i don't know why there seems to always be a rather long wait for a table at the cheesecake factory...  sometimes during the weekdays on in between hours it's been easy to get seated. i don't go here very often, but once in a while it's a good choice if we can't decide on what we feel like eating...  their menu is ginormeous and there's bound to be something that you'll feel like eating.   for a chain, the flavors have been pretty good on whatever i've ordered.  not too bland, but yet pretty safe for various palates... the service is your typical corporate restaurant style... pretty mechanical, but i've never had any bad experiences with the staff. the prices are very reasonable... especially since each dish can feed 3 people easily... there will always be food left over, which is a pity if you're not wanting to take the rest to go.   that's one thing i don't like about this chain... i'm sure they have alot of food waste... the sizes are definately way excessive in portion size.... i rarely have any room for dessert, but they're pretty good too... not anything out of the world, but a very large cheesecake menu... cocktails are not that interesting either... alot of sugary sweet drinks"
Kelly L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,10,,4.0,26/11/2008,Yummy food!  Great view if you sit outside.  I love that.  Nice staff.  A little expensive for me (i'm a student though) but not bad.  I love the banana cream cheesecake mmmmmmm!  Go here :)
Candy T.,"Hayward, United States",1,153,,3.0,15/9/2008,just another Cheesecake Factory like any others throughout the country; but always crowded; great services;
Jenni D.,"San Francisco, United States",107,313,,2.0,31/1/2006,"Go for coffee and cheesecake on the patio when the weather warms...you won't be disappointed.  If you go for food, drinks or dinner on a weekend, you'll be pissed.  Initially I was an avid fan of the ridiculously diverse menu (thai pasta to burgers to calamari) and the fully stocked bar.  I realized after about the third go (had to make sure it wasn't ""what I ordered"") that the ""diverse"" menu just means that they're not great at anything, merely ok at most things. Not much better than the average TGIRUBYAPPLEBES type entrees. Drinks are fine, but not as strong as they ought to be for the 11-14 dollar asking price.  Would be ok except for the ridiculous wait (almost constant) and the silly method of queuing customers.  First you give your name to the host, then you're called for a buzzer, then you're buzzed and put in another line...then you get a seat.  If you're going to put in an hour and a half wait, I'd head somewhere a little more special than this."
kim t.,"San Jose, United States",35,143,5,1.0,30/7/2006,"I hate long waits for food, and a 20 minute + wait is a tad rediculous.  There is always a long line of people on the waiting list here and its very chaotic with a bunch of people standing around waiting. there's not enough chairs for people to sit on in the waiting area either.  the food is mediocre and semi pricey."
Derek Alistair J.,"San Francisco, United States",89,146,,3.0,21/10/2006,bland food. just a tab over mediocore on dessert.
Lily T.,"San Francisco, United States",128,206,11,3.0,12/9/2007,"waiting is a bitch for dinner when u are hungry.. the food there are alright, the dessert is the yummy. is it worth waiting for one hour or more... eating lunch there is shorter wait time.."
Eric L.,"Modesto, United States",0,20,1,4.0,7/5/2008,"The view during Christmas with a date is spectacular.  The perfect date environment if you want to eat outside.  My sister said she would die if someone took her here to eat, on a date.  That is all this restaurant is over the other cheesecake factories, a good date environment.  I had a pretty good meal, the food was plentiful and for an average 15 dollar a plate upper-class looking restaurant it was good.  I had the lemon chicken which defiantly did not leave me hungry, and the bread that they serve you in the beginning holds you over until you get your food from the starvation for having to wait 2 hours to get seated.  This is the average wait time for a Friday night here, I suggest coming on a week day which is about still 30-40 minutes.  The servers were overly nice, annoying at times, and my water got completely empty twice which is defiantly a negative.  Overall a good restaurant with good food, for a romantic place to bring a date overlooking the city."
Michael H.,"San Francisco, United States",118,201,,1.0,12/8/2005,"The name of this place says exactly what it is... a big ol' food factory. Perched atop MACY's overlooking Union Square, this chain restaurant has impressive views that perhaps are there to distract you from your oversized plate of mediocre food. I've heard that this place is the second busiest restaurant in the nation. I don't know why. Maybe it's the tourist factor?"
Marijke D.,"Schoten, Belgium",3,134,,4.0,17/9/2006,"Great restaurant at the top of Macy's, with views over Union Square.  Ask to be seated outside on a sunny day, you'll have to wait a bit longer, but it's totally worth it.  Portions are huge, I think we would have had enough with one appetizer and one entree for two persons.  Eat the chocolate mousse cheesecake, it's amazing, a meal in itself.  Expect the chocolate rush to last for a couple of hours..."
Bren L.,"Oakland, United States",28,222,12,3.0,12/11/2006,"wayyyy too crowded at any time of the day. i always try to avoid this place but for some reason i always get lured into going. they dont take reservations but if you know ""someone"" they can always squeeze you in. the food portion is HUGE and you always have to doggie bag 'em home.  so eat small and save room for the overly rich cheesecake at the end."
Hana S.,"San Francisco, United States",23,91,,4.0,22/10/2007,"The food is always as expected- yummy.  The wait also as expected- forever!. Cheesecake is like any other cheesecake I have been to in cali. Loud, busy, people, and babies.  I have been to this one twice, 1st time with girl friends and other was a double date.  Both were awesome times!"
Bert W.,"San Jose, United States",0,29,,1.0,31/8/2010,"This place treats its customers like herds of cattle.  We had 4 people in our party on a wednesday evening celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. They say they don't take reservations however, I called to make one and they took my name and said once I get there it would be about 25 minutes.  When I got there they said they did not see my name on the list and that they don't take reservations, my question is why did you take my name then??? It only got worse after we were seated which took 40 minutes NOT 25 minutes.  Our waitress seemed irritated because I had to send something back to the kitchen and i did it in a friendly way because I dine out quite often and I understand that the waitress is not usually the blame for bad food.  BTW it was a crab dip that looked more like tuna with tons of mayo all you could taste was the mayo.  I informed the waitress that it was my daughters birthday and could they do something special and she told me well you could buy her a piece of cheesecake. She had the nerve to roll her eyes and she made sure I knew she did not like that by her facial expression.  This place is nothing but a tourist trap and they treat the customers like crap."
