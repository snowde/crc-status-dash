Hmmm W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,55,,1.0,11/4/2007,Hour wait for McDonald's quality food? I must be a consumer whore...
Michael H.,"Sacramento, United States",3,57,,3.0,17/2/2008,Place is okay...the little deck is nice to eat on those few sunny warm summer days in the city. And the only thing worth mentioning here is the cheesecake...I love there huge selection and I still haven't had every cake on there menu but that is all they are good for....
Maria W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,25/8/2008,"I am disgusted by this place.  Last week I went to the Cheescake Factory with a group of friends, halfway through my meal I look down and see that some pieces of the chicken are completely RAW.  It was disgusting.  Needless to say, I got foodpoisoning and missed work for a day and a half.  I did tell my waiter who told the manager and I was offered a free meal.  As if I would ever want to eat there again...."
nice m.,"San Francisco, United States",25,19,4,1.0,25/10/2005,"we've waited for 40 minutes long, then another 40 minutes for us to realize the taste of the food! we we're debating if we're still going to come back in the future or not..for sure, even how hungry we get while going around macy's we wouldn't decide to dine at the factory ever again...just a waste of our money!!!"
Jen Y.,"Rocklin, United States",11,41,,3.0,2/12/2007,"This place is worth it just for the view.  After a few glasses of wine, (due to the extraordinary wait times) the avocado egg rolls were amazing.  And also eaten in 5 seconds.  We almost ordered another one, until we realized how expensive the food is.  Good for every once in a while, every one seems to come here for their birthdays.  (Only good if you get a hot waiter to sing to you.)  Will come here next time just for appetizers and a few drinks....and the view."
HL N.,"Daly City, United States",1,21,,5.0,18/1/2009,"I don't give 5 stars out easily, if ever, but something happened tonight in this usually so crowded we don't wait restaurant. Not only because it's a tourist attraction and popular local haunt known for it's desserts, but their portions are HUGE, good, and so forth. Back to the unusual occurrence: after packing in enough food for the seven of us on a birthday event, one of my young daughters placed the leftovers on the floor in the bag, which tipped, and spilled onto the floor. We apologized and 2 workers came by to clean up the food. I figured, oh well, there goes the pasta, but no, our server comes back a few minutes later with a COMPLETE brand new order? Huh, what gives, isn't it too bad Charlie? I was so impressed, I gave another 20 on top of the 18% gratuity that was factored in the bill. Now you know why people such as Jerry Rice come here (I ran into him a couple of years ago here). This is a must visit if you're a tourist, or were born here 50+ years ago, as I was."
Erika A.,"Millbrae, United States",0,21,,3.0,19/2/2008,"el novio brougtt me over here thinking it would be romantic to eat a top the macys building and look at union square. unfortunately the food was not that great and it was kind of expensive for me. the portions are huge, to the point where its too excessive and you kinda loose your appetite. I'm giving three stars because our waiter was really attentive."
Danielle S.,"Toronto, Canada",0,117,6,3.0,17/2/2008,It's always a fun time at the Cheesecake Factory though I'm never really sure why. I love their warm appetizer bread but the rest of the food is so-so. Service is barely alright also and I don't eat cheesecake but I'm sure we'll be there again soon. :)
Tiffany R.,"Livermore, United States",4,1,18,2.0,9/3/2008,my friends and i had resveravtion for 10 people at 12:00. we did not get the table until 1:00. the forks had food on the that was so disgusting. i ordered  thai chicken pasta. the chicken was dried. the food was ok.
J J.,"San Francisco, United States",0,60,,3.0,15/7/2007,"Occasionally, The Cheesecake Factory sounds good. However, I think I've had too much of it that it's becoming a bit sickening. At this location there is always a wait. I always sit outside on the patio when I do come, overlooking Union Square. Though I've been here numerous times, I've only had the Shrimp and Bacon Club, the Chicken and Avocado Sandwich, Thai Salad, Chicken Littles and BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. All are pretty good, but especially the sandwiches. I did have cheesecake once, but it was way too sweet and the huge portions never leave you still craving dessert. The price is unusually inexpensive for the huge portion you get. I always share a sandwich with someone else and still end up with leftovers. Usually a pleasant experience, but sometimes the wait makes it not worth going to."
Sheeva G.,"San Francisco, United States",4,25,,3.0,30/12/2007,"Overrated and underwhelming.  My boyfriend took me to Cheesecake Factory because I had never had cheesecake before.  It was crowded, loud, and we had to mill into the elevator like cattle in order to get to the restaurant.  I much prefer a small, quiet bakery."
Ashley N.,"Anaheim, United States",199,5,,1.0,19/2/2009,"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory but after doing all the math... 2 hours waiting for a table  + 1 hour of waiting for our main course + 1 hour waiting and then realizing that the waitress forgot to put our order in, tried to take our order again, and a conversation with the manager because the waitress was going to charge for the measly appetizer (that was actually for meant for another table..) and drinks we finished an hour before because she wanted to cover her butt from getting in trouble  = EPIC FAIL [FTL]. We couldn't even track down our waitress to ask her where our food was the entire hour. Luckily, the manager took care of our bill and did put our order in for to-go. Nevertheless, after promising to be done in 10 minutes...it turned was another 20 minutes.  Whether or not the free food compensated for the terrible service and 4+ hours wait for a dinner is still something to contemplate. Luckily their food and the fact that yelp doesn't allow 0 stars salvaged them just one litto star."
Shane W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,5.0,26/10/2007,"Oh... my... God... Becky, this is the greatest food ever! I mean look at the menus and you can see that you'll never tire of this place: the menu is extensive (like 15 pages or something or other). The decor is festive and has spectacular views of Union Square, it can be crowded at certain times throughout the day, but when you're eating one of their extraordinary desserts or drinking one of their delectable cocktails, you wouldn't care if they sat you on the escalators. The service could be the worst in the city (but it's not), there could be cracks in the wall (which there isn't), the main chef could have a googley-looking mole on this forehead (which I don't think he does), and I would still eat here. I'm a guy and I feel prego when I leave cause I can't stop eating their gorgeously tasty food (even though they are very generous protions). I know it's the Cheesecake Factory, but I crave their Tirimisu (even if I can go to North Beach) and I act like the weirdest pig when I consume those things... it's disgusting, but this is still making me hungry... think I'll go have a Cheesecake-Factory-baby right now... um."
Julie B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,,5.0,23/12/2007,"The workers are very friendly (even if you suspect them to be as nice for having a big tip) , the food is great , the cheesecake ... are awfully good ! The view is so nice ! The only bad point is the big big line which is waiting for you when you come in it . VERY VERY VERY GOOD RESTAURANT !!"
Miss D.,"San Francisco, United States",3,70,,2.0,2/8/2008,"to be honest..the only reason this place got two stars is because of their cheesecake. It's the bomb....but other then that...this place deserves less then a star. The wait..is FUCKING LONG...to other people who complain about an hour wait. psh...you won't believe mine. My birthday's in December a few days before Christmas. And of course I had my birthday dinner held here and since you can't reserve, I came FUCKING EARLY to get 25 seats. I told everyone dinner starts at 7pm, guess what time I was here by. FUCKING 1PM JUST TO GUARANTEE MY SEATS BY 7PM. Yes I know I'm crazy but I wanted to get my seats ON TIME. RIDICULOUSLY...AS EARLY AS I WAS..I FUCKING DIDN'T GET MY SEATS TILL FUCKING 8:30PM. They told me I had to have more then half my party here BY 7 and we didn't even come close to getting seated until 8:30pm. Although my birthday wasn't a total wreck, still...the wait here is not worth it at all. Besides..even though I was there at 1pm, of course, I'm downtown..I went shopping all day till 6:30pm and came back hoping to get seated soon. This place is never worth the wait, my advice, just get cheesecake to go, otherwise don't eat here....the food is alright..not anything different or all that great. It's just like another American restaurant."
Bethany D.,"San Francisco, United States",53,86,,2.0,14/6/2006,"The best place to bring an out of town cousin, because tourists are convinced that this is the best we have in the city. I have to admit, at first I was enticed by the ""escalator to heaven"" vibe that you can't help but feel as you are carried to this restaurant at the top of Macy's. After a long day of shopping, any food looks good to me, and the view is much nicer than being holed up in the cellar to eat at Wolfgang Puck's. I was seated outside, and of course ordered the most extravagant cheesecake slice I could find on the menu. The waitstaff was obscenely slow, and it was a little odd that they brought us bread as an appetizer since we were only having dessert, but the thing that influenced my negative opinion of this place was the pigeons! Within seconds of recieveing my cake, I was attacked by a flock of pigeons that hurridly ate everything on my plate! And I wasn't the only one with this problem, about three or four parties at the next tables were also getting their food demolished by these pigeons. Even after all that, I still had to pay full price for the cheesecake I certainly did not eat. I guess the whole idea of eating outside, high up, is nice, but they seriously need to work on their ""customer satisfaction"" level."
danielle b.,"San Francisco, United States",1,69,,2.0,20/4/2005,O.k. Sydney L. what night and time did you go and only had to wait 20-60 minutes?  If it was in the early part of the week before 7p I can see that.  Do not go here on Fri-Sat.  I have no problem with a no reservation policy but 90min to 2 hours.  Come on.  There are too many places in S.F. to put up with what my Mom is convinced is a bunch of pre-cooked/frozen food because no way can you have a 20 page menu and it's all fresh.  With so many choices I suppose there should be something for everyone.  The Daily Grill and Max's up the street are two alternatives w/similar fare.  They give you a lot and the prices aren't bad.  Some of the pastas are o.k.  I've had better cheesecake.  LUMPY mashed potatoes are not homey; just bad.  The apps/salads are the most inconsistent.  Better to try at lunch when they FIRST open or go early in the week.  They do have a full bar (lots of mixes) for those of you willing to torture yourselves and wait 2 or more hours.
GEL R.,"Daly City, United States",33,11,3,2.0,17/2/2008,"So on Valentines Day  my boyfriend and I took my little sister here and her boyfriend on a double date, since they've never ate here before......... The place was PAAACKKEDD, and on top of that our server messed up on my order 3 fucking times. So while everyone else got their food, I'm sitting waiting for mines since they came out with the wrong order, not just once, but TWICE.... Dont' get me wrong the Herb Crusted Salmon was preeetty darn good, but the Steak diane was gross.. The cheesecake were alright.  I felt bad for the server since he's probably running around serving other people, so when we left I left him a generous tip. Despite the fact that I wasn't well satisfied......... Ok so the next day I check my bank statement, and guess the fuck what.. THEY CHARGED ME TWICE! UGH  How disturbing is that?? Anyways next time I'm making sure I get my moneys worth when I eat there again, and I'll probably be alot more demanding. =]"
Lola d.,"San Leandro, United States",2,22,,3.0,21/4/2008,"great pastas, EXCELLENT dessert obviously but always busy annoying yuppies, and rude servers make u no wanna come back"
Doris Y.,"Alameda, United States",26,28,22,3.0,26/7/2006,"i'm surprised at all negative comments about the big portions. yall complain when portions are too small and when they're too big, sheesh, there's no pleasing you guys. well, the main complaint for me is definately the wait. for the time i had to wait, i expected better food. and for a place named ""cheesecake factory"" i also expected better cheesecake. and usually when i finally get seated i would see quite a few empty tables, what the heck is that about? though i really like the view from the terrace, it's quite relaxing from up there.  i think the the main appeal of this place is the novelty and tourist attraction hype. other than that, there are plenty of better options out there. on a positive note the last time i went here, the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic was mighty tasty and our waitress was super friendly. it was the only positive experience i've had out of the four times i've been here, so i thought i'd be generous and give it another star."
