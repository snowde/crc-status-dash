Tricia B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,26,1,5.0,5/16/2017,"I was trying to think of a place for my wife and I to go for dinner when my coworker suggested we go here. I had never been to this restaurant before so I though why not give it a try?. We started with the loaded tater totts....I can not describe them good enough to express how yummy they are! If you have not had them DEF try them! After looking at the pics that are posed I decided to go with the Chicken Madeira..... IT WAS AMAZING!! My wife got the fish and chips and hers was great too! 5 large crispy pieces of fish and fries that came with coleslaw. The portions are huge! we both had to bring half of our meal home! We got the banana cream cheesecake to go (cause we were to stuffed to eat it there) It was mouth watering! not too sweet, creamy perfection! our waitress was super nice and the restaurant was beautifully decorated. We will Absolutely be back!"
Katelyn T.,"Whitchurch-Stouffville, Canada",37,403,788,2.0,10/18/2015,"This location is extremely busy and a lot of the staff here are extremely unpleasant.  We came for a late lunch around 3pm and had to wait 20min for a table (which is okay, the wait is expected). When the hostess  took us to our table, the table and chairs were dirty. They didn't clean up the table after the last group. The hostess didn't seem to be in a hurry to help is clean up the table. She disappeared for a while, meanwhile we were standing there waiting for table to be clean.  They finally cleaned the table but did an awful job. Hostess came back with our small plates and utensils to set up the table. Plates were dripping wet so I politely said ""I would prefer some dry plates please"". I got no verbal response back from the hostess; she angrily walked away with the wet plates and utensils. Bathroom is not well maintained. Soap pump didn't have any soap. And garbage is overfilled.  Overall, food quality is the same as anywhere else, however, the ambiance here is terrible. It's so loud much like dining inside a subway train during rush hour, you can't have a proper conversation. Bathroom is not maintained.  You're in union square, I would suggest going elsewhere for food."
Sheila F.,"Hercules, CA",163,10,11,1.0,8/2/2016,"After waiting for 20 mins to get in and another hour for our food. Time to call the manager and leave!  The lady server who helped us place our orders and even recommened what good burger to get, forgot to put it on our actual order?!! You gotta be shitting me. We were just served appetizers.. After 30 mins of waiting, we followed up for our main meals and the guy server (who replaced the 1st server) told us there are no other orders placed for us. Like seriously!!!!? It's been a long day for me and my friends from work. We wanted to eat. But we're too tired and annoyed to wait. The manager though was good at handling the mess. But yes, you need to train your servers well! I think the 1st one who helped us was too excited to clock out for lunch."
Peter P.,"Bakersfield, CA",407,257,2139,3.0,10/6/2015,"Came here with my manager and peers for our first Team Building. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's but none on the 8th floor over looking part of a city as beautiful as San Francisco. The elegance at this particular location does set it apart from others and to me it was the balcony dining that created that separation.       I ordered what they call the Factory Combo which you had a choice of two items. The choices were Steak Diane, Chicken Madiera, Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. I picked the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and its served with mashed potatoes as the side. I requested my steak medium but received a near well done piece of meat. The flavor was sort of bland to me which showcases poor attention to the steak. The Herb Crusted Salmon was a bit dry but the flavor was bursting and popping quite well.       I decided not to order dessert as I'm not a dessert person. But I did have a few Lagunita IPAs which I enjoyed from the draft. I'm used to the bottles and you can taste the difference.       The service was actually excellent by the waiter. He was very attentive but not annoying and seemed to pick the times to question refills.       The reason for the 3 stars is a direct reflection of their food which is why I came here. Poor representation of what I have experienced with other locations."
Margi L.,"El Camino, CA",37,2,1,5.0,10/24/2016,I loved everything about the cheese cake factory. Delicious delicacies with beautiful roof top view and great ambience. Not to forget the customer service is one of the best one I have experienced.
Michael V.,"Camarillo, CA",20,10,4,3.0,5/17/2017,The most expensive slice of cheesecake ive ever had in my life and it wasnt even a sit in.  The cheesecake was legit yummy and the takeaway boxes come with a side of cream which nobody needs!!  Couldnt eat-in cos it was packed!!
Mankiran K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/20/2016,Best Cheescake factory I've been to! Food came out quickly and was super delicious. And our waitress was very attentive. You can't beat the views.
Lori H.,"Redding, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/2/2017,I love everything about the Cheesecake Factory.  The decor is unique and the restaurant is always clean. The menu is diversified and all dishes seem to have wonderful flavors. Consistency is key and this place has it! Not to mention the most important part of any meal at the Cheesecake Factory which is a slice of one of their many outstanding cheesecakes. Vanilla Bean is my personal favorite!
Moses L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,6,1.0,1/26/2017,"Update 1/26/17: Cheesecake Factory has since contacted us, and made things right. While that moment is gone and we still had the bad experience, we appreciate the fact the fact that they reached out to us to correct the problem.  Wish I could give this place negative stars. Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for a table. That was understandable because my wife and I came in on a Saturday night at 7:25pm, and it was already a mad house. After our buzzer goes off, we have to stand to the side, and wait an additional 15 minutes. Ok fine whatever, at least we're at the table now. We sit down, 10 minutes go by and our waiter finally drops off two waters, and a bread basket(at this point a couple sits down at the table behind us (this is important) . He comes back 5 minutes later to take drink orders. We also put in an appetizer order and our main course orders as well. ANOTHER 10 minutes later, our drinks get to the table. They get my wife's drink wrong, and the glass is FILTHY. There was literally like mashed potatoes or some crap on the outside of it. 20 minutes go by, and the couple behind us has gotten their food. Still nothing for us. I flag down the incompetent waiter, and he apologizes and says the appetizer is coming. 20 more minutes go by and the other couples waiter is clearing their empty plates from the table. The waiter has not checked on us, or informed us about anything, and he's avoiding our area. The manager comes out and keeps apologizing, but I keep cutting him off because I just want to leave. I ask him for the check for the drinks (two sodas) about 5 times and he says he'll get it. The freaking WAITER comes up 5 minutes laterand before he can say anything I just tell him to get me the check, now! He comes back ANOTHER 5 freaking minutes later and informs us we don't have to pay. My wife and I were only here for the weekend. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for ruining such a great day. You guys SUCK!"
Marsh M.,"Suisun City, CA",10,1,,1.0,9/2/2017,"This doesn't even deserve 1  star but a big fat 0. My boyfriend and I were at the city and decided to eat at Cheese Cake factory since it's been years that we ate in that particular restaurant. It was too hot in the restaurant like they try to coo you, the hostess was rude, she told this guy to give us a seat and he just sped and not even looking if we were behind him, the waitress sucked. The food was alright but not the best and took too long. My recommendations? If you ever go to the city, don't waste your time, money in the restaurant, find somewhere else that is way far better that Cheese Cake Factory."
Reuven R.,"San Jose, CA",41,16,,4.0,4/6/2017,"Nice location ,the outside has a really nice view ,and the service and food are great as always,toke them some time like 20 minutes I think to sit us down,but expect that everything was really delicious ."
JustinE Y.,"San Francisco, CA",126,100,410,4.0,10/12/2015,"Busy and touristy spot for sure but I still like to visit here once a while.  Outside heated patio with union square view. Blend Pina Colada drinks are right on our spot. Sweet desserts style are just too good to resist. Portion just like all the chain restaurant, BIG! I couldn't finish an entree by myself.  Good place for party and family celebration!"
Melissa M.,"Stockton, CA",47,91,73,1.0,12/17/2016,"I went into the website and put in a complaint regarding our horrible service from Demitri. We never got any response from the company or any acknowledgement whatsoever. This experience was terrible, we never even got to order our entrees and paid and left after appetizers. Not a fan of complaining but this was SO BAD."
Nicolas H.,"Concord, CA",1,11,,1.0,10/19/2016,"My coworkers and I come here for lunch about twice a month. The Eggplant Parmesan has been hit or miss, but is usually acceptable. This most recent trip was very disappointing. The service was very slow, and our server was either having a bad day, or just not happy. It didn't end there... the bread was old and stale, and the server took forever to take our bill, even though it is the lunch hour and we had to return to work."
Andrea G.,"Monterey, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/21/2017,"Stopped in very last minute on a Sunday around 2-3 pm or so, and like I imagined there was a long wait time and it was busy. It took about 25 minutes to get a table outside in the dinning patio, but the view was well worth It. There is a large variety of plates on the menu, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was good, not the best, but good. My mother ordered a mushroom hamburger and it was very good. I would come back, and I do recommend on eating here if you don't mind waiting a long time to get a table, oh and it's also very crowded."
Denis S.,"San Pedro, CA",1,44,2,4.0,2/27/2017,OK so cheesecake factory has OK food and drinks but this location is a 4 star because you just can't beat the view and they have heaters set up outside so it's so enjoyable. So trust me go eat here and enjoy Union square!!
Duyen V.,"San Diego, CA",31,30,47,1.0,11/22/2016,"We came from San Diego and decided to have a dinner at Cheese Factory. Honestly, we had a very bad experience in this location. First the serve was kindda racist and ignorant, he didnt ask if we had ever wanted bread or not. We had to ask him if we could get some bread. 10 mins after he seemed like he forgot so we had to ask again for the bread. Then he brought us 3 slices of white bread on a place while everyone else got their bread in a basket. Ok that s fine. We checked out and asked for some plastic utensils, the female serve at the front desk next to the bakery was very rude. She grabbed the whole box of folks and she was like ok grab whatever you want and dont bother me. OMG I was disappointed by the people in San Fran. I dont think I would come back here to visit"
Sweatha R.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, CA",9,7,,4.0,9/4/2017,"Nice food, very kind staff also really liked the cheesecake. I would recommend people to go to this place. The prices are very reasonable"
Taylor C.,"Fontana, CA",1,50,19,5.0,6/9/2016,"This is by FAR the best Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I love Cheesecake Factory so I try and go every time I travel and the food was so excellent! Our waitress, Glindi, was so nice and must have come by the table about twelve times to refill our waters. We hardly had to ask for a thing and her customer service was outstanding! Thank you Glindi for everything !"
Douglas F.,"Tiburon, CA",683,451,294,3.0,12/26/2015,"11:15, been in line since 10:30am and they are 15 minutes late opening. Hope this isn't a reflection of the service we will get today. A line for as far as you can see with no sense of urgency to get the doors open. Poor start to the lunch experience."
