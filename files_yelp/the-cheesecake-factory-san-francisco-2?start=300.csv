Bryce T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,11,,1.0,7/1/2017,"I called to place a pickup order for 2 pieces of cheesecake. The girl who answered said she would put me on a brief hold while she transferred me to someone who would take my order. After precisely 10 uninterrupted minutes of listening to hold music, I hung up. This isn't my first time feeling completely ignored by this business. I recommend going elsewhere."
Kristie L.,"Gales Ferry, CT",0,27,,1.0,4/12/2017,"Terrible service and they made us wait forever to place our order.  And it took a long time to get our food. This is not worth the money, you should skip it! Don't eat here!"
Gabriele J.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",1375,870,2315,3.0,8/15/2015,"Maybe I should have come for the actual cheesecake, but when I dropped by I was actually looking for breakfast. We came in and quite immediatelly someone was welcoming us and asking where we would like to sit. Since there were tables available inside the restaurant, we just went with that option instead of waiting for a spot at the nicer outside area.  There were so many things on the menu that I felt a bit dizzy. Since I just could not decide on anything cause it felt like hard work going through all of the options listed, I just picked the ""sunday brunch combo"", which consisted in scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes. I asked if they could add some strawberries to the mix and the very nice waiter gladly agreed. I also had some fresh squeezed orange juice. I was pretty unimpressed with my plate. The scrambled eggs were not really scrambled, and if it were not for the strawberries, this would be a pretty poor-looking meal for quite a high price. The juice was nice, the pancakes were nice, but when the bill came and I realized I had just spent almost 40 USD on a pretty sleazy breakfast I felt kind of dumb. I'd probably come back if I had to, since the menu is so large and the staff is so nice, but I feel like this is more of a tourist trap than anything else."
Josh H.,"San Francisco, CA",201,71,655,4.0,9/27/2015,"What can you say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been uttered a thousand times over? The place has amazing views from the patio over looking Union Square park, there is more on the menu then you will find in an entire food court at most malls. And the staff is always dressed head to toe in white to show how they have somehow managed not to spill anything on themselves throughout their shift.  Came here with a couple of co-workers for lunch and I was stunned to hear that it was their first time inside of the place. There was a long line to get up to the counter to receive a buzzer for a table so we worked our way over to the bar and took a seat. The bartender who greeted us was more than accommodating and asked if he could start us with something to drink. I knew what I was after since I was going to pair my beverage with my dish, and I was thinking Cuban sandwich the entire way there so you know I had to go with a Mojito.  Now the hard decision to make www which mojito to get, I usually go with the Pineapple since it screams the essence of equator living. I ordered one for myself and told my lunch mates that they should follow suit. The bartender offered his suggestion of Blueberry Mojitos for them since they had never tried them and it was now time to sit back and watch him do his thing. After a few shakes and a perfect pour we were ready to enjoy the deliciousness that is a Mojito.  We were passed our menu's and it was a kick to watch the faces of my co-workers as they flipped through the book (yes, it is thicker than some Daniele Steele novels) to see what they could possibly get themselves into. Page after page is packed full of every thinkable type of food from Asian to French back to Classic fav's such as mini Corndogs...  We placed our orders for a couple of Cuban sandwiches as well as a couple of appetizers and watched a lil sports on the tv mounted above the bar and waited for our grub to arrive. Within 15 minutes we were gorging ourselves on our delectable delights. The Cuban sandwich is pretty respectable and is pretty close to the real thing. It's my go to when I come and I will probably be back for another soon enough. Before taking off we had to get a refresh on drinks and then we settled up and got outta dodge before we started seeing double.  Oh yeah... They have a nice choice of Cheesecake slices available as well, if that's what you thought this place was all about."
Cameron M.,"Pacifica, CA",1,35,2,3.0,1/5/2017,"Good tasting food but bad quality, definitely a a chain restaurant, stays in your system for days which is unhealthy. But it's okay once a month."
Jaleena F.,"Union City, CA",3,8,4,3.0,8/11/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and it was around the evening time yet it was still busy because it was a friday night which was understandable. We were seated after about 25 minutes which wasn't that bad of a wait. Once we were seated, we ordered after waiting about 5-7 minutes. My boyfriend also ordered a beer when we ordered our food. After we were given our bread, I noticed that another couple got seated near us. About 30 minutes passed and we still didn't receive our food AND my boyfriend never even got his beer yet either. However, the couple that was seated AFTER us, they got their food already. We were starting to get a little irritated because we were very hungry. The manager came out and said that our food would take about 5 more minutes and he gave us a free soup to hold us off. There were many occasions that night where my boyfriend and I were just sitting around waiting for our waitress to come so we could ask about the beer, more bread, etc. The service that day wasn't that great. If it wasn't for the food being amazing, I would've given this place 1 or 2 stars."
Anne-Marie R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,6,3.0,4/6/2017,"Good food, big portions- value for money. Huge variety on menu, something for everyone"
Christine S.,"San Francisco, CA",1117,1216,4637,3.0,8/11/2014,"Came here with a handful of friends for the 50% off cheesecake deal during National Cheesecake Day. Because it is a hot tourist spot, the place was already packed, and the wait was around 40 minutes at 4pm. I can only imaging what the wait is like during prime dinner time... - Cheesecake: A for Awesome. The slices are big and delicious. And half off means each slice was only $3.75! How people manage to eat a slice for dessert after a meal is beyond me.  - Service: F for Fail. Our server was rude, impatient, and inattentive.  Looking past the outrageous wait times, I guess I wouldn't mind coming back to dine since The Cheesecake Factory does have a breathtaking view of Union Square."
Doug M.,"Visalia, CA",0,11,1,1.0,12/18/2016,"Too poor to even rate... doesn't really even deserve 1-star!!  Service was horrible, food was cold and Manager was rude when we asked about our order after waiting almost an hour. The employees at the take-out were too busy socializing with their friends to pay any attention to customers. Several take-out customers were complaining about how bad the service was.  I won't be visiting this place ever again, and you can bet I'm going to telling my friends to avoid it, too!"
Duli B.,"Richmond, CA",20,2,23,1.0,3/18/2017,"Theeeee WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to... waited an hour and a half for a dry salad,plain jambalaya and sorry ass service... I wouldn't recommend this place to my enemy..."
Matt S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,41,1,1.0,11/23/2016,"I can only review the horrible service. After 2 phone calls and almost 20 minutes on hold I gave up. Both calls started with ""can I put you on a brief hold"". I guess their definition of ""brief"" varies from the rest of the world. I could see if this was a weekend, but it was a Wednesday at 8pm. I guess all those other 1 star reviews for service were spot on!  It's been a good 7-8 years since I ate at Cheesecake Factory...I'm guessing it will be at least that much longer!"
Hannes M.,"Hamburg, Germany",98,604,4445,5.0,10/4/2015,"So we went here twice within 3 days. First time we had just some cheesecake to take away, second time we are there. So the first time we had a slice of Oreo-Cheesecake and one of salted caramel. Sooooo tasty! We took it outside and ate it in the park close-by! Guess what, they even add whip cream into the plastic container - as if the cake was not yet creamy enough! Second time we returned we actually ate there as well and it was awesome as well. As we came up the eighth floor of the Macy's store, it was so crowded. So we received a buzzer and had to wait like 30-40 minutes. So we spent the next time at the bar and had some cocktails. Those were so awesome and tasty. All about 11 bucks and got as all drunk as we hadn't eaten yet. So by the time we went to our table, we were all still being tipsy.  We ordered a garlic-cheese-bread as a starter and they serve warm bread and butter, too! It was all very yummy and the garlic-bread came with a Parmesan pesto and a tomato salsa! Great.  As my main course, I ordered a Ceaser salad with chicken. It was a big-ass salad with nicely grilled chicken breast. As dessert we had again a couple of slices of Cheesecake that we all shared as we were already pretty much stuffed and the cake is very rich. We had a slice of the pumpkin-pecan cheesecake and it was gorgeous, too. Overall, the prices are a bit elevated, but the quality and taste of the food is high! Go there, especially the cheesecake is extremely tasty!!!"
Matthew R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/21/2017,"Been here 3 times. The food is alright, although some of the apps taste like they were freezer burnt, like the loaded potato balls. The burgers are pretty good. The wait to get in for dinner is outrageous, even in the middle of the week (due to the restaurant being SF sized). Once you're in however, the service is pretty good. The major difference in this one is that the food isn't the same and is slightly lower quality when compared to the one in Walnut Creek. If you're taking a date, there won't be an issue really, I just wouldn't go with a big group. With this said, the service is actually good, and outstanding when you consider how busy they get."
Michelle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,41,3,4.0,3/13/2017,This has got to be the best view in all of Union Square!! Love the rooftop dining and view. Restaurant was very busy when we went and about a 2 hour wait!
Nadine Y.,"Toronto, Canada",67,1,4,4.0,3/28/2017,"Only waited for 15mins for a seat. Great view, awesome food and service. Definitely coming back."
Gretchen L.,"Las Vegas, NV",155,73,15,5.0,12/20/2016,"We're from Orange County visiting and Guillermo at the bar did a great job in servicing us in the midst of a busy dinner rush. He was very efficient, fast, and concise in his work. His Jameson mule was perfect, and the bang bang chicken and shrimp, plus the Thai glazed salmon were amazing. Thanks for the great service! Will be back"
Maurice D.,"Brentwood, CA",173,50,61,2.0,12/23/2016,"Sorry Cheesecake but today wasn't your day. Our food was hard, stale and even missing things.  Our experience was far below good. Beware of the awesome rooftop view seating....... the pigeons will get the best of you."
amy h.,"San Francisco, CA",0,43,21,1.0,3/11/2017,Worst food ever and service and manager ever waited for my food 35min food never came waiter disappeared complained to manager he said I'm sorry and left worst worst of the worst. Never go there unless you want bad food and bad service.
Katie C.,"San Diego, CA",105,135,122,4.0,12/9/2015,"With downtown SF in full Christmas mode, I knew I had to see the sparkling white lights, wreaths, ribbons, and trees for myself. We arrived at the restaurant with hopes that we could be seated on the balcony and be able to see the activities and decorations below. Unfortunately, it was a chilly night and we opted for indoor seating.  We ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (my go to) and bang bang chicken and shrimp. The chipotle gave the pasta dish a nice tasty kick and the chicken was well portioned in the dish. The meal was so delicious and filling that I, unfortunately, had no room for cheesecake.  The restaurant is in a prime location and is, to no one's surprised, overwhelmed with guests. While other parties were frequently checked upon, our server was nowhere to be seen from the time our order was taken and the time our meal was over. When she dropped the check off at our table, the highest suggested tip was circled. I found this action rude based on her absence."
Geo L.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",20,28,20,1.0,12/3/2016,"Awful experience, we had to wait around an hour and a half for a table, about 15 minutes to get the drinks, 10 minutes to get a cup to pour a drink, food took forever. It was not the waiter, they should have more staff. Save your time and money."
