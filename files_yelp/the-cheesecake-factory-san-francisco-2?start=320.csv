David T.,"San Francisco, CA",436,709,5302,2.0,8/25/2015,"I like The Cheesecake Factory chain, but this one is just too mobbed with tourists. The wait is long and the service is rushed. Try any other location than this one for your Cheescake factory fix."
Jeff S.,"San Francisco, CA",40,12,50,4.0,4/30/2016,"My favorites are Hibachi Steak and Crab bites. Taste is always excellent! But in a slow night, I still get some delayed services. Anyway, I'll keep coming back here because of tastes of the foods."
Eric L.,"San Francisco, CA",198,9,8,3.0,7/31/2015,Pros: The view is astounding from the balcony. It oversees Union Square is absolutely beautiful at night. Cons: The wait was an hour long. So be prepared to wait a very long time. The food was relatively mediocre. I was not overly impressed by the quality.
Dustin O.,"Concord, CA",121,11,1,5.0,4/24/2016,"Dropped in for lunch,  food was what you'd expect from CF, but the service was amazing!!! I go out to eat 3-4 times a week and this was the best service I've had in years.  Kathryn F. is the definition of an attentive server.  My order was taking promptly, my drink never went empty, and my very specific order was delivered exactly as I requested. Definitely going to be back to this location soon."
Thiago F.,"Oakland, CA",0,15,3,4.0,3/15/2017,"The good: the food, and the cheesecake. The bad: the crowd. What really bothers me is that the cheesecake slices are getting smaller (I used to have them like biweekly up until a couple months ago) and they tell the customers nothing's changed =/"
T Bone T.,"Richmond, CA",22,100,149,5.0,1/22/2017,Such a wonderful experience to eat at the Cheesecake Factory me and 25 of my other friends reserve the table of the service was great I ordered the nachos which lacked a lot of cheese but more chips than what was actually chip cheese meat ratio I added chicken which could have been a little more chicken but the service was great the drinks is good the Lemonade's were amazing I would definitely go again
Stacy U.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",69,26,10,5.0,5/24/2016,"Who doesnt know about The Cheesecake Factory(CCF). Despite, they dont take phone reservation, only based on walk in and the long painful waiting I love this restaurant.  Today 6 of us had birthday dinner in CCF.  Steaks r always the yummiest things in the menu, if u r willing to eat a whole cow (yea the portion is generous)! I had big lunch so I skipped my beloved steak and ordered some small plates, it was really good. Fried tempura with sauce, and nacho appetizer.  One thing I have to mention is our waitress. Her name is Kristina, who was so nice, efficient and professional. Since Cheesecake factory is so big, sometimes u'd lose contact with ur servers. But not this time. She was there whenever we need her. And she uses the words like madam, my lady, my dear.... which is so cute.  I always appreciate the good services, which truly can lighten up the whole dining process."
Emmanuel B.,"Madison, NJ",278,208,61,5.0,8/6/2015,Must be the best cheesecake factory that I have done in the states. Sure thing you have to wait a lot to get the table and might wait a bit for the food. But my god the view from the outside balcony is stunning !! Right facing the main park of Sf and being on the 17th floor you over look the city. Food is also very yummy with very large portion. You ll be lucky to be still hungry before the famous cheesecake. Try the pasta they are delicious
Wendy F.,"San Francisco, CA",62,247,571,2.0,6/21/2015,"Yup you get the nice view, but 3 hours of waiting?!?! Also very cheap service.  FOOD: My friends and I were going to have dinner here, but we had a 2 hours wait so we decided to have dinner first then come back here for dessert. There were 8 of us and we ordered 1) red velvet, 2) coffee, 3) strawberry shortcake, and 4) mango lemon. I really liked the mango lemon, which had a layer of mango mousse and jam at the top that added a stint of sour sting to the flavor. The others were okay and weren't impressive. It was also my friend's birthday so we asked them for a birthday celebration. In the past the restaurant bring us a special slice of cake with candles. But here they just put a candle on a cheese cake we ordered. How cheap is that?!?!? SERVICE: We made a reservation for 8pm, which was a 2 hour wait. But when we got there, they made us wait another 30-45 minutes. My friend ordered a glass of wine, which took them SO LONG to ""prepare"". You are suppose to drink the wine while eating cheesecake, not after you are done with them!! SETTING: You definitely get a nice view since it's at the top of the Macy's building. But I think the place is overhyped and it is SO CRAMMED with people waiting for their reservation. They seriously need to figure out a better way of organizing.  PRICE: We paid around $35 for everything ($4.50). It was a lot of food and we didn't finish everything, but probably because we were so full from dinner.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: Not coming back. Wait is so freaking long and I can get much better food and service elsewhere in downtown."
Wendy L.,"Berkeley, CA",667,1217,63,4.0,7/3/2015,"You have to know what you're going to the Cheesecake Factory for. It's not for artisan crafted food meticulously made for each diner. It is, however, very tasty food that is well-executed by a chain. It can take a while to get through the book of a menu. I have a go-to menu item that I order (the Cajun pasta) but that felt a bit too heavy for lunch. Instead, I had the grilled fish tacos which felt like a good compromise. As one might expect, the portion was huge - 4 tacos with rice and beans. Definitely worth of two meals, but tacos don't keep well so...I ate them all.  We had a reservation for 10 people and they were about 15 minutes late in seating is because they ""didn't have a server."" I'm not sure what that means considering that it was the lunch hour and when we were finally seated, I saw that the vast majority of their tables were empty. Something operationally off here but it was otherwise a good experience."
Rock T.,"Novato, CA",37,27,,3.0,11/7/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory but I hate going to this place because the workers seem hell  stressed all the time and I feel bad ordering it looks like they are doing a favor to you. Unacceptable. But the food still pretty good. OMG.
Marlon P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,11,3,3.0,7/26/2015,"We had brunch here so we could use a gift card that we've had for two years. The food is okay but the service was very slow, although our waitress was very nice and polite. Also, it's always packed with tourists and the wait is always long. We waited 35 minutes. Our brunch basically became our early dinner. Their menu is so over-the-top with a gazillion items. Menus like that drive me crazy!  Anyway, I had the crispy fish tacos and he had a ""healthy"" salad topped with grilled steak. I have to say the food was good; nothing special but good. Our food took a while to arrive and our orders were served a few minutes apart. Service was so slow we didn't have time to order some cheesecake. It was disappointing. Being a San Francisco native, it's not the type of place I would go to regularly. If I was doing some heavy shopping downtown and I was famished, I would probably give it another try only because I haven't had their cheesecake yet. One final thing. The decor is very cheesey. No pun intended. It's hard to tell what the theme or motif is but it could use a facelift. The Terrace seating overlooking Union Square is a very nice feature."
Kat Z.,"Daly City, CA",15,36,21,1.0,6/22/2017,"Review is in regards to the horrible hostess that was working at the front desk checking customers in. As our table was getting ready and my phone went off indicating that my party needed to check in with the host at the front desk, I was greeted by a tiny Asian girl with an attitude that was disgusting. I proceeded to smile and as I was going to announce that I'm checking in for my table she cut me off and asked for a name. Surprisingly I told her my name and was rudely cut off by her giving me a side eye, followed by her rolling her eyes. In shock, I just stood there trying to figure out what happened and my boyfriend stepped in and firmly said ""Look, we're just here to check in. You guys said our table is ready."" With hesitation she replied ""I guess I can help you guys."" Never in my life have I experienced such horrible customer service! About 10 people came up to the front podium doing the same and they were NOT treated the same way I was. I'm beyond disgusted by her attitude and the way she handled the situation. If you work in customer service, be prepared to provide such. If not, work somewhere else. It's such a shame to have nasty employees taint such a good company."
Jorge M.,"Vallejo, CA",1,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I would give it zero , just smh horrible service , they forgot to give a dish out and sat wait for it for 30 mins . Defiantly not worth  the wait there"
Da X.,"San Leandro, CA",201,236,105,3.0,4/3/2016,"Pros: Nice view if you get a balcony seat. Huge cheesecake selection (duh?) Cons: Long lines Average food ""Meh"" prices This is a good place to take a bf/gf or a tourist stop. If you live in the bay area, there are much better places to go for food. Idk about cheesecake but I'm sure there are better places, although the cheesecake here is good."
Chris G.,"Monterey, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2017,There was a waiter under my table and I kicked him so many time till something was broken and the were finger nails in my pasta fuck u guys catch me at 1310 Louis way hella soft
Miho B.,"Missoula, MT",790,11,4,5.0,11/13/2016,For as busy as this place is I think they had very accommodating and great service. Yes the wait maybe long but what else do you expect in the heart of San Francisco! Definitely happy with our service today.
Rachel H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",291,84,116,3.0,10/6/2016,"I was really disappointed in this place. The seating took a while, but that was expected. What really pissed me off was that our waiter 1) didn't tell us his name, 2) didn't repeat our order, 3) got our order WRONG, 4) abandoned us to fix the order with 3 other workers.  Food is always the same at any Cheesecake Factory and if you've never been to one, you should try it at least once. I would give the quality of the food 4 stars, but the service knocked it down. We ordered LUNCH SPECIAL meals and he gave us the actual full priced meal when my boyfriend and I are just city tourists tryna save some money but feel fancy at the same time.  We eventually solved it by paying the lunch special price for the full meal which was nice. It just pissed me off that we had to get the attention of two waiters and the manager. All because of one shit waiter."
Will L.,"Pasadena, CA",51,91,71,4.0,5/1/2016,"Why on earth would I give a Cheesecake Factory five stars. Well when you can sit perched on top of SF union square on a warm day and eat like a true American with oversized entrees and drinks, what's not to love.  Fact: the union square cheesecake is the second highest grossing cheesecake in the nation, so it will be packed no matter what time you go. Be prepared or grab a spot at the bar where there's pretty good turnover.  I'm not going to give a recount of everything I've eaten there but know they have a new kale quinoa salad (the bigger one of the two) that is delicious. It's a great pairing with the buffalo chicken bites.  Wash that down with a cocktail of your choice in a classic Cheesecake Factory glass and you're in business.  Pro tips: Park across the street under the park. It's reasonable. And the patio seating is worth the wait."
Inge C.,"San Francisco, CA",242,109,325,3.0,6/26/2015,"Cheesecake factory in the heart of San Francisco! They're located on the roof of Macy's so the view is fantastic! Definitely sit on their outside patio during Christmas season. You get the beautiful view of Union Square!! However, you need to brace yourself for the wait of eternity. This Cheesecake Factory is a popular demand for both locals and visitors, and the wait can get pretty crazy. Because they have so many customers, they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. Their food are pretty good, I definitely recommend their listing of pasta and Specialty of Steak Diane. And for appetizer, their must haves are the Avocado Eggrolls and Crab rangoon! I strongly do not suggest you get their alcohol drinks from here because well.. They triple if not, quadruple the original market price. So I dont think it's worth getting. Get drunk some place else. Service depends on their busyness .. Some waitress can get so overwhelmed and take the wrong orders from you. But they have good service in general. Just understand that they get so busy all the time. Cheers!!"
