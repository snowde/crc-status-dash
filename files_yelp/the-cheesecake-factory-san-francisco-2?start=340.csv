Andi H.,"San Francisco, CA",46,23,19,5.0,7/3/2016,"Amazing portions I always order a salad and a cocktail when I get a chance to eat at this location. Today I ordered the falafel salad, hands down the best salad so far I would recommend it to everybody!"
Andy W.,"Piedmont, Oakland, CA",2,31,,2.0,1/26/2017,"If you want large quantities of mediocre food that arrives at a snail's pace but is served by friendly waiters, this is your place. We ordered four appetizers for our group.  Edamame - fairly tasteless.  Spinach dip - no taste.  Ahi Tartare - about a tablespoon of tasteless ahi on a mound of boring guacamole.  Only the portabella/avocado/zucchini fries were good. Main courses - hamburger and fries were quite good, ""skinnylicious"" Asian chicken salad had no taste.  I took most of it home and doctored it with soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil, sweetener and rice vinegar, and it was good. It took almost half an hour to get the appetizers, and quite a while after that for the main courses.  The waiters were very friendly, though, and we gave them a good tip because they were not responsible for the quality of the food. With the hundreds of good restaurants in the downtown area, I can't imagine going to the Cheesecake Factory unless you're a tourist who is afraid to experiment for the sake of a good meal.  However, if you insist on going, get a beer, a burger and fries, and cheesecake.  They appear to be the only safe choices. P.S. When you have about a hundred items on your menu, it's a pretty safe bet that you can't do all of them - or maybe even most of them - well."
Robert P.,"San Francisco, CA",10,26,28,1.0,1/2/2017,Great service. And I sincerely mean that. The server was so sweet.  Terrible food.  This place has gone down hill so badly. It hurts my heart to think this fond memory if mine is just a memory.  Bye bye Cheesecake Factory. You're history.
Kelly A.,"San Francisco, CA",47,102,30,2.0,4/22/2016,This place sucks but it's a chain restaurant so what do you really expect? Service is bad unless you get the one person that is in a good mood and not overwhelmed by the number of guests assigned to them Food is usually just ok because it is the Cheesecake Factory  They are always busy which is really sad tourists must really honk we have bad food in the us I am not sure why I have been here more than once Service is always slow
Lanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",1427,675,2300,5.0,4/29/2014,"For a restaurant that has over 200-300 menu items (I can't even guess), hundreds of seats, and more servers than any other restaurant in a mile raidus, I am pleasantly surprised by my visit here. Also, with that many food choices, there was bound to be a vegan thing or 2 I could eat. My boyfriend received some cheesecake factory gift cards and I just got a new job, so we decided to have a date night and celebrate! I've actually stopped here on a few occasions not to eat, but to speak with the managers about upcoming work opportunities. Each time I've been here, there's always been at least a 15 minute solid wait. Even then, the hosts have always been helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. They don't cave under the dozens of families crowding around their desk, waiting for a table. This time, my bf and I walked in and were seated immediately. Our server, (Jennifer I think?), greeted us immediately, and brought us water and bread. You'll have to take a good 15 minutes to look at the drink menu, BEFORE you even think about food. And after that, good luck sifting through the ridiculous food menu! There's even a menu WITHIN a menu-the skinnylicious menu which basically highlights the same dishes that are already inside the regular menu! Luckily, our server was so helpful, she immediately pointed out some vegan friendly appetizers and ran to the back to check if a few vegetarian ones were vegan friendly or not! We ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate (my first time doing that!), and settled on the Thai Lettuce wraps, with avocado instead of chicken. But you could also do portobella mushrooms or eggplant! The lettuce wraps were delicious! It definitely kicks PF Chang's lettuce wraps out of the water. sorry Changs, but your dumb-ass ""special"" sauce does nothing on the THREE amazing sauces they provide here. Plus, they use quality butter-leaf lettuce and provide a myriad of veggie choices! We licked the plate clean! It was so good! For entrees, I went for Evelyn's favorite pasta dish-or something of similar name. The penne is vegan-friendly and it is tossed with broccoli, eggplant, garlic, tomatoes, pine nuts, and olive oil. It is simple but flavorful! I was actually impressed by the food choices.  And of course, portions were hefty, and the timing was done right! Remember back in high school when you would grab all your buddies and eat at the cheesecake factory? $30 got you 1 dish, 1 dessert, and a cup of water? Well this isn't high school anymore. Today, we spent the big bucks (we went way over our gift certificate limit), and I couldn't be more satisfied. I'm sure that your experience here is a definite hit or miss, but you can't discredit them for the times they do it right! Thanks for the great service, food, drinks, and atmosphere! I'll cheers to that!"
Christina C.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",211,268,174,4.0,9/11/2015,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory almost my whole life. I loved it as a kid. Then I realized the foodie movement had brought way more interesting restaurants my way...but it's still pretty good. I have to eat gluten free (Celiac) and they recently got a menu for me! But I haven't tried it yet to be honest. I came here recently for gluten free cheesecake!!!! The best part of the cheesecake factory to be honest, come on. The only gf option is the Ghiradelli chocolate cheescake...OMG! It was SO rich but also SO good! I had to stop myself after 3-4 bites because it was too much. So glad to have a gf cheesecake option here!  Also, this location is crazy busy. We came here around 10pm, and there was still about an hour wait for 4 people...what!! We decided to buy cheesecake at the bar and take it to the park across the street. Much better."
A L.,"Albany, CA",0,42,4,1.0,1/8/2017,"I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but my experience tonight was off putting. I ordered a salad, took a bite and noticed something tasted off. The vegetables were clearly rotten. I sent it back and the manager came to speak to me to explain why this was the case. I'm sorry but telling me why I was served a plate of rotten vegetables doesn't take back the fact that I took a bite into it. By that point my party was halfway done with their meals and it would have been pointless to order a new entree. I was given no form of compensation or solution to the issue."
Julie N.,"San Francisco, CA",170,415,933,3.0,9/28/2014,"Havent been to this cheesecake factory for many years and its actually my First time sitting at the bar area. The bar was crowded since there was a giants game but manage to get a seat. It took the bartender a while to get my order since she had so much drinks that she had to made for other customers.  This was what i order: Roadside sliders Mojito White chocolate raspberry cheesecake. The food was good and tasty. The food came out fairly fast since i only order a appetizer and cheesecake. Decent price for the food. For the mojito, it was refreshing and it wasn't overkill by the alcohol. And it was very presentable especially the mint decoration. Cost about $9 or $10. Quite expensive but they give you a big cup.  Every time i come here, the foods are always good, friendly service and always leaving you full."
Slava K.,"San Diego, CA",12,3,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Customer service sucks dealing with party over 8 people. Unprofessional. Overinflated croud, mean servers. $0 tips"
Bob M.,"Central San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,80,23,2.0,2/13/2017,"I ordered one of the most expensive dishes, the fillet mignon. I have eaten better steaks at other cheesecake factory locations."
Kelley Y.,"New York, NY",235,148,169,2.0,5/8/2015,"FOOD: I ordered the shrimp soft tacos from the SKINNYLICIOUS Menu and they were pretty good. I also really liked the pickled vegetables that came with it. Would I get it again? Meh, I don't know. What I really like is the dark brown bread-its delicious !! You can get this at any Cheesecake Factory though. My friend ordered the peach bellini and omg, this is delicious!!! Anyone who likes sweet drinks will love this! SERVICE: SLOW service!!! We asked for bread 3 times and the waitress forgot every time. We also asked if they can turn up the heater and they said no.  TIPS: Honestly, what I love about this one in particular is the view. You get to see Union Square at night and its really beautiful! Yes, it is FREEZING but its still a nice place to eat and view. WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? No, but for the view, Yes."
Ashleigh M.,"Destrehan, LA",89,63,128,4.0,6/10/2015,"Last night my family and I went to dine at this establishment. We got there early so we didn't have to wait long so that was great after a long day of flying on the plane. The bread that they serve is fantastic and hot! The food took a while to come out after we ordered, but that was expected at a large restaurant! All the food my family got was great, I ordered the fried mac & cheese which was awesome! Then for dessert we all shared a Oreo cheesecake which was the best I've ever had! They have so many options for you to choose from there, definitely will go back!"
Jacob S.,"San Francisco, CA",21,10,8,4.0,9/7/2015,"30th Anniversary cheesecake is so sweet, Mango key lime highly recommend and it taste fresh and not so sweet.  This is my first time to eat there, restroom was awful, but serves were very impressive. Love it!"
Yoav G.,"Toronto, Canada",1,10,6,1.0,5/1/2016,"The cheesecake is ok, but the rest of the food is horrendous. The service is incredulously chaotic.  Their marketing brings in a lot of tourists which I'd imagine is their only way to sustain business. We didn't see a single table finish their food. Everything was sticky, from the menu to the table, cutlery, and filthy glasses.  I'd recommend this place be avoided like the plague but I think that's grossly understating my feelings. I have never felt shame like the shame of walking home with my boxed left overs and did my best to hide the logo until I could get home to throw it out, the fact that I haven't yet developed food poisoning has deeply challenged my expectations."
Michelle B.,"San Francisco, CA",100,23,4,1.0,10/31/2016,"Made a pick up order at 12:55pm. It is now 1:28pm. The girl who took my order said my order will be ready in 15 minutes. I leave the office at 1:05. I pay at 1:10 and checked in on my order a little after 1:20 and the girl tells me I've only been waiting 13 minutes.... If the order was not going to be put through until I actually came into pay, it would have been nice for the girl who took my order to tell me that. Thanks for wasting my time girl. Train your people right."
Josh C.,"San Diego, CA",4,11,,3.0,1/4/2017,"It's Cheesecake Factory. You either like it, or you don't. The location, however, leaves a bit to be desired. If you think you've seen Cheesecake Factory when it's busy, you should check this one out. Tiny elevator to get there. Crowds spilling onto each other in a tiny lobby. Noise, noise, noise. If you can, call ahead and place an order to carry out. Because WOW is it crazy in there."
Jacklyn G.,"Martinez, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/3/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Telling you now, if you're going to pick one, GO TO WALNUT CREEK! First- We waited 35 minutes for our pager to vibrate - pretty normal. SF Cheesecake is always crowded. However, when we went to the front desk, they had us wait to the left of the desk for our name to be called. Mind you, there were about 5 parties in front of us, still waiting to be seated. AFTER our pager had buzzed. Weird system if you ask me. Our table was nice, but the server.  The server seemed very confused and like she did not have a clear knowledge of the menu. She nearly put in an order for the wrong dish, and when my girlfriend asked for recommendations, she couldn't come up with anything. Weird, again. We waited for about 25 minutes for the last and certainly least....  THE FOOD. I ordered the ""Very Spicy"" Cajun jambalaya pasta. THE blandest pasta I've ever had in my entire life. Like, not even a dash of seasoned salt let alone any spice. And, they gave me shrimp only when the dish clearly is labeled as a dish with chicken AND shrimp. I didn't eat any, and ended up bringing it home to recook and season myself. Overall horrible experience in what was supposed to be a fun anniversary trip to the city.  My two stars are there because 1. My girlfriend enjoyed her chicken Madeira. 2. The Reese's Cheesecake was bomb."
S E R.,"Stockton, CA",9,47,25,5.0,12/2/2016,"As always, this place rocks! The service, food and portions are all great! This is a wonderful  place to go when you can't get a reservation anywhere else in the city!"
Stacey B.,"El Granada, CA",10,6,1,1.0,3/12/2016,"Bad service overall. Made reservations at 5:30 and was told an hour and a half wait. Came back at 7:30, and was told 8:30. Came back at 8 and was told we could be seated right then.  Went and sat at the table that was reserved for my party, and not five minutes later was told that if the rest of the party wasn't here in the next 15 minutes they would have to get ride of our table. Now 15 minutes from now would be 8:20, still not 8:30 the second time we were told. Mind you as we sat down, the female manager was the person who told us we could be seated. She then condescendingly said ""you said the rest of your party was at the bar"". Without even giving us a moment to say they were walking to the table from the bar she started asking about what our reservation situation was.  This went on for a good 5 minutes.. Overall extremely rude female manager specifically."
Chantille T.,"Richmond, CA",264,52,246,4.0,7/24/2015,"4 stars for the beloved Cheesecake Factory in Union Square! Food always amazing and the atmosphere just as great. The wait: Usually takes longer than 30 minutes with assumption time expectancy for 20 minutes but surprisingly the wait was just fine and expected. Plus I knew the host so we were seated quite quick.  Service: Our waitress was quick with her mouth but not quick enough with our food. We started off with a couple of appetizers, the Fried Zucchini and Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. We asked for bread and didn't come until 10 minutes later. Our waitress was quite forgetful too. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya and my friend ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza. Wrong sliders came out, but no problem, everyone makes mistakes but I suggested to add the Stuffed Mushrooms and our waitress questioned my choice of quantity of appetizers. So I just refused and didn't order it. Throughout our dinner, she kept asking me if I still wanted to order the Stuffed Mushrooms and I said no. Once we got the check, the waitress checked off the amount she should be tipped.  Food overall: Always amazing and I will always recommend the place!"
