Amber D.,"San Pablo, CA",0,1,2,1.0,10/13/2016,"Horrible customer service, they have you wait forever and if you call for pick up they don't answer the phone."
Audrey L.,"Bukit Timah, Singapore, Singapore",436,798,1122,4.0,3/29/2016,"Four stars for the bruléed french toast, which is served only during brunch on Sundays. This french toast was surprisingly crispy and well cooked -- just enough egg, but not too much to be soggy. Just enough powdered sugar to add that sweetness. The syrup is served on the side so you can add to your liking. Of course, you can't go wrong with torching a bit of sugar on the surface of the toast. Wow, they weren't kidding when they said this is the ""best"" french toast ever."
B R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/21/2017,"We decided to go to CheeseCake Factory because it is one of the most attractive places here in San Francisco. Without a doubt, the views and the extensive menu are worth it. The problem with this restaurant is that you always have to wait a long time to be able to eat or diner, and that's what happened to us. After waiting 20 minutes we were called to take a table and once there there was no available table. We had to wait 10 more minutes for another table and as we were many people we were seated at a large table but it was not round. We finally enjoyed the food and of course the delicious cakes, although the table was not the best."
Erika Y.,"Oceanside, CA",67,8,,1.0,1/23/2017,"I am so disappointed in the service/ hair in my food/ being told by management that the chefs wear hair nets/ watching a cook with no hair net taking his hat off rubbing his fingers through his hair then going straight to   gloves..no washing his hands...it started off by going there for my mom and sisters birthday.6 of us. We were given 3 sets of silver ware and 3 plates. We had to ask for utensils,plates a few times.sure alot of employees and we had to keep getting up to ask for things over and over. We waited probably 1 hour for food. They brought it out  at different   my son and I were last ....soup/salad 1/2 sandwhich...then there was hair in the food ...REALLY!!The manager came over to appease us..gave the food with the hair for free...never mind the  cesear salads had no dressing too. We just wanted to leave since it was one epic fail after another. Oh we asked for 3 separate checks in the beginning and we were given 1 check. Then to ask for that..we were given attitude and it took along time. We chose to skip the birthday party because  the experience was lame.We left the restraunt and I decided that if I was the manager I would want to know my customers experience...the manager listened and said your saying you didnt get desert? Write your address and number and you will hear from us in 1 week to 1 1/2 week... well its been 15 days....no response. I created a yelp because its important for businesses to hear the customers experience .....Customers pay money for the experience and businesses need their customers!!! We were a party of 6 that had a horrible experience enough to share( word of mouth) Doesnt matter if we were a party of 1 or a large party. My sister goes there all the time and wanted her family to visit her and go to Cheesecake Factory for their birthdays...The icing on the cake ( which we didn't have any) was to be told by management that they take it serious with hair nets...then for me, my mom, my son and I watch the cook with no hair net rubbing his hands in his hair then cook....REALLY!!! GROSS!!! By the way I have been a server and in customer service for years and i couldnt imagine letting the customers leave with this type of experience."
Bonny P.,"Perkinston, MS",1,30,1,2.0,1/23/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory's all over and usually are pleased with them. This one doesn't get my best review because of a couple of issues. First portion size. I ordered the Ahi Tartar and it was really pitiful. There was 2"" of avocado, less than 1/2"" of tuna and almost no sauce. I did ask for extra won tons and they came, but dang the dish itself was pitifully skimpy. Then on to the burger. Big bun, a piece of meat that barely covered half of it. Either downsize the bun or upsize the meat. And apparently the chef doesn't know medium because the meat was woefully undercooked. I ordered plain tonic water, I got a gin and tonic. No bread until the middle of the meal. Our waitress really tried but there was a real language barrier. Thumbs down to this Cheesecake Factory."
Ella P.,"San Francisco, CA",26,9,,3.0,1/22/2017,"Decent Cheesecake Factory location. Always packed, fine service. BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT OF STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE. I mean come on, this is the third time in a row, and it's not like it's an unpopular cheesecake. Figure out supply/demand."
Filipe G.,"Grands Boulevards/Sentier, Paris, France",58,4,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"All drinks had a very weird aftertaste - it seemed either de water or the ice were not OK. Waiter didn't even try to help us, kept on implying our taste was probably the problem. The Iced Tea had a 3 finger layer of foam; things were clearly not working well."
Dmytro M.,"San Francisco, CA",47,3,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"Had a dinner here yesterday with my gf.Service was ok,but food was really bad ,shrimp scampi is a pasta -20$ on the menu:noodles were unsalted  sauce and a few pieces of tiny shrimps.Also after I had a few sips of my beer I found a FLY in there.I think they should better take care of cleanliness in the  restaurant cause page of the menu were nasty as well.Totally I spent 70 $ and we went home hungry. Definitely not coming back."
La G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,5,2.0,1/4/2017,"Came here on NYD. Waited 1.5 hr, was seated, sever forgot to place our order in their POS system, came back 15 min later and asked for our order again, never came back to ask if we needed anything. At least the food was good."
Paul L.,"San Francisco, CA",36,11,,2.0,10/5/2016,They buzz you just to let you know that you have to wait some more. Total tourist trap. Go to burger bar instead.
Juana O.,"Oxnard, CA",4,9,12,1.0,7/7/2017,"I traveled from Ventura County to San Francisco for a family trip this past weekend. We decided to eat dinner at this location because I've been to this restaurant in different cities. I enjoyed the food as always and was quite impressed by how great the interior looked like. However, the service was rather terrible. There is no communication between the staff members. My family had waited for a table for about an hour, but was told to wait for another three hours. We in no way were going to stand there the entire four hours. There wasn't even any proper seating in the waiting area for anyone. I had to talk  to both managers in order for my family and I to be seated. The waiter had also messed my entree order up. The restrooms were also not sanitary. They had an awful stench of urine. I had expected my experience to be very well but was left disappointed. So disappointed that I in fact did not want to leave one star. I would have left no stars at all."
Benita M.,"San Francisco, CA",149,397,1162,4.0,4/3/2014,"You know, I would have given it 5 stars... But had to ding 1 star. Read below to find out why... Walking in, oh my word, those cheesecakes looked SO FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS. Came at 1:30pm, 5 minute wait for inside table, 15minutes for outside. I chose inside. Got a table at the far back corner. +Service was excellent. Very patient and understanding waiters/waitresses. ~Kind of loud inside but it was lunch time, noise is a must. +Very clean restaurant. Sat down, ordered a Crispy Crab Wonton Appetizer ($10.95). Really good. Fried very nicely. Inside was nice and warm. Dipping sauce (sweet chili sauce) accompanied it well. My entree was a Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. Oh boy this was really good. Tasted like bacon, and there isn't any. A little too salty in my opinion, was grabbing for water a lot. I couldn't finish it and brought it home. Once I got home, I noticed there was a LOT of oil at the bottom. Not much of a turnoff, until I started eating and I saw a tiny piece of metal scrap in my pasta... Gross. It was a metal scrap fallen from cleaning pots and pans. Totally disgusting... Kind of sad I didn't get to try the cheesecake. Got too full but heard lots of compliments for them. It was a very pleasant afternoon. Everything was great, up until I found that metal scrap. I don't know if I want to return.. but if it's for the cheesecakes, different story :)"
Adreinne W.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,5,,2.0,6/24/2016,"The absolute worst Cheesecake Factory that I've ever visited.   The food is sub-par.  I ordered the same dishes that I usually get from the Maryland, New Jersey and Las Vegas locations.  They tasted bland, as if no seasoning.   The only reason to deal with the long wait times and crowds is delicious food.  This location misses the mark."
Oriana T.,"Dernancourt, Australia",10,19,,4.0,12/29/2016,"The line for a table was 2 hours long and the take away line was 30mins long, that's how you no a place is good! Got the original strawberry and the chocolate cheesecake! And by far the best cheesecake of my life! So creamy and soft and full of flavour! The only reason I give it a 4 is because the slices weren't overly big for what you pay but that's just me being greedy!"
Sara B.,"Berkeley, CA",0,1,,4.0,1/13/2017,The last time I was there it took us 2 hours to get a seat but the food was great. I recommend the pasta marinara. And for a baby : they love  fries
Chino Z.,"San Lorenzo, CA",3,18,1,2.0,2/24/2016,"Over the years I've visited my fair share of Cheesecake Factory locations.  For the most part, with just a few exceptions their food is consistent which is so important to me.  If I'm going to eat at a chain I expect the food to be the same every time.  I rate their food 4 stars for consistency, flavor and presentation.  Being a chain restaurant I would definitely say they are one of the better casual dining chains.  Above an Olive Garden, Outback or Claim Jumpers, but definitely not a Ruth's Chris.  I've been most impressed by their ability to get Salmon right every time, never dry.   BUT FOR THIS LOCATION SPECIFICALLY, I couldn't give it 4 starts because of the overall experience.  First, the good stuff... The location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square so pretty damn good location.  They offer outside seating with views of the square.  Considering the overpriced tourist trap restaurants in and around the square, this location is generally in line with the average prices you would see across their different locations.  For being in Union Square, one might even say this place is a ""deal"" all things considered.    However, also being in a prime location means people everywhere.  It is a complete madhouse in there and beyond loud.  I'm already not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory's standby-only policy due to their refusal to accept reservations which is why I rarely dine here.  The front desk and whole waiting area is a disaster.  People standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some people sprawled out on the floor probably due to hunger, dehydration and exhaustion from waiting out this archaic process.  People are pushing on each other, throwing elbows and just lots of general overall rudeness you would expect to get from starving people in a loud, crowded, dimly lit, stuffy room probably resentful knowing that a reservation could have avoided some of this. If you go down the escalator one level there are couches and chairs in Macy's home furnishings department but even those fill up with weary Cheesecake Factory refugees.  Once you are finally selected to be seated, usually 30-45 minutes after the quoted time, you are seated in one of the more cramped dining rooms I've experienced at this chain.  I'm sure at this point people are so exhausted and relived to care much.   While the food and prices were up to par with other Cheesecake Factories across the U.S., I don't think I'll be visiting this location again.  The whole experience takes away from enjoying your food.  And if you're having a good time visiting Union Square, shopping, visiting the City or just having a good day in general I would advise not visiting this location anywhere near a common meal time or it will drain the life out of you and probably kill the great mood you were in."
Ying D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,13,3.0,3/27/2016,"Ok food with fare price , don't expect much about the service."
Kevin L.,"San Francisco, CA",331,89,101,4.0,3/28/2015,"TIME - What's great about cheesecake factory is the hours of operation. On weekdays they go from 11am-11pm, Fri and Sat 11am-12:30am and Sun 10am to 11pm.  FOOD - I love the Louisiana chicken, and for those who wants to eat healthier they have that options too. The portions are large, so if you want to go to cheesecake factory for their cheesecake, I suggest you make room for that if you have a meal before the cake. I love their banana cream one.  Not so great is the wait times. Sometimes you wait for hours, depending on what time you arrive there. So be prepared for that too."
Leina K.,"San Francisco, CA",71,436,467,4.0,5/16/2015,"You know what you're signing up for when you go to the Union Square Cheesecake Factory.  It's going to be at least a 30 minute wait and there is never any room at the bar. With that in mind, I like this location. It's in the middle of it all and during the day, sometimes it's nice to sit outside on the top floor and people watch (beware of birds though). People have always been friendly at this location (granted it is their job) and they know that the more efficient they are, the more tables they'll have that night. For the most part, I'm no fuss when I'm here. I order the same thing every time (da vinci pasta and georgia peach drink) and it always comes out great."
Ari B.,"Oakland, CA",20,13,,5.0,10/11/2016,Got a free salad and soup for waiting. I didn't think it took very long at all but I never turn down free food. It was good soup too. Clam chowder.
