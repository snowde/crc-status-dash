Emmylou R.,"Temecula, CA",63,67,170,4.0,2/27/2016,I usually like most foods on their menu but their chicken mushroom lettuce wraps was just too salty
Ania P.,"Bordeaux, France",77,204,671,4.0,2/17/2015,Wonderful view and fat ass food! Made my day! The service is as good as in every Cheesecake Factory :)
Diane H.,"San Francisco, CA",3,26,,4.0,12/10/2016,"Seriously over crowded but for a meal here during the holidays most restaurants are very busy.  Also, even with the massive crowds the service was done well and prompt. Food was pretty good.  Had the fried mac n cheese from a  previous reviewers suggestion and it was really good.  Very filling though.  Don't order a lot or you wont eat your meal. Will definitely go back after winter when I can enjoy that amazing view from the patio seating.  Was raining when we were there."
Michelle T.,"San Jose, CA",46,54,69,4.0,6/23/2015,"It's not just another Cheesecake Factory........ It's a Cheesecake Factory with a view! I've tried to get into this restaurant a few times but the wait was so long, I always backed out.  I am not surprised - the Boiling Crab 20mins away from me, in San Jose, has a 2-hr wait... can't imagine to be seated right away (for dinner) in this place at Union Square.  Tip: try to come in the morning for brunch, on a Sunday.  We only waited 15mins.  I'm sure city lights would be a better view, but it's not so bad during the daytime (check out the pic).   Other than that, yea... it's Cheesecake Factory.  I recommend the place to couples on dates, and the cheesecake to stressed out people like me, needing a reward.  Ha!  We actually had brunch (and it was too early for cheesecake).  The lemon-ricotta pancakes were really fluffy and had a cheesecake hint to it.  The omelette was cooked well and was not oily. I probably would've complained too had I dined there on a busy night, but, it was a good experience overall!"
Naveen N.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",7,348,,4.0,11/28/2016,Standard Cheesecake Factory menu. Waitstaff was friendly but very slow. Cheesecake was delicious.
Ryan P.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",20,28,,1.0,11/28/2016,Awful experience. The wait was longer than what they promised. There was a miscommunication between the workers who takes your name down and puts you on the wait list. I was standing at the desk waiting patiently to ask my question but the (sorry to bring race into this) white girl continued to help other white customers who came after me. I know she seen me because I stood in line right behind a lady she was already helping and a few white customers insisted on making a new line and the worker took a few steps to her right to start helping the other customers. By the time I got her attention I tried explaining what the greeter had told me downstairs and this chick just didn't wanna listen and I was made out as a liar. Anyways. Pretty bad experience. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.
Danielle M.,"Fremont, CA",210,7,1,5.0,12/21/2016,"Came here on a busy weekday night the week of Christmas. The wait time was estimated at 45 mins but the timer went off in 20. One of the managers,  Stephanie walked us to our table and had a pretty lengthy conversation before our waiter showed up. This showed me she actually cared about us, even though she was busy, she took so much action to make sure we were taken care of. They were out of my favorite dish, so she took it upon herself to go to the kitchen and ask for something similar, modified just for me. I really appreciated her and the way she cared about us. She told us a little bit about her life, and was extremely nice. Oh and food was amazing too!! If you come here, the wait time will be high but there's a reason. Highly recommend just because of Stephanie she made my visit amazing. Thank you!"
J M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,115,192,5.0,5/20/2015,"I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for many, many years and I'm rarely disappointed. Of course no likes to wait to be seated but it's to be expected, and just points to the popularity of this restaurant.  There are so many menu items that are great, I couldn't list them all. I really like the shrimp scampi and chicken madeira but I also like many others.  I do wish that they would bring back the shrimp club sandwich, a long time favorite.  If you like cheesecake, then obviously you're at the right place.  The choices are huge and decadent.  Sometimes I just get the plain  cheesecake to keep it simple.   Service is usually very good, but occasionally it can be slow.  Still, it's a five star place!"
Henry N.,"Livingston, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2016,Drove for two hours specifically to eat here. Waited two hours to be seated. The server took our order and an our later we left on an empty stomach because we never got our food. We asked several times for our food but it never made it to our table. Other people were trying to pay their tab but no server was around to even take care of that. I would not recommend this restaurant and for sure never coming back again.
Steve S.,"Bellevue, WA",8,21,,3.0,6/20/2017,"this place is a tourist trap and it gets ugly late in  the day.  had dinner on mon nite at 9pm, the the place was filthy inside from all the traffic of the day, and it smelled pretty bad.  the food seemed normal, but it was just too dirty and gritty inside the place - this is the only CheeseFact where I have experienced this (have been to many across the country)"
Bermel L.,"Daly City, CA",1,8,,1.0,1/2/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory customer service representatives are very disappointing. After my complaint on their website, I was followed up, around Christmas time, by a representative asking for the person's name. Not only am I NOT a snitch, but I will not ruin someone's holiday season. I replied stating that I refuse to give the persons name but I expect that the staff will be further trained in customer service. And that was it. This million dollar chain restaurant did not want to reply, nor did they want to even give me a gift card for my trouble. So if any of you out there want to complain, don't expect anything in return."
Orange S.,"San Francisco, CA",19,79,85,3.0,10/1/2016,"Food is good. I ordered Bristo Shrimp Pasta and I like it. Super big portion. But the girl who was our server was very weird. She always disappear, no ask for ""anything elase?"" or ""how was everthing?"". When we asked for checked and I paid her with card, she came back without a pen just put it on our table and gone....... how can I sign? Then I asked another server to borrow her pen to sign the bill and she reply me ""you can use your finger to sign"" seriously?"
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",376,724,4176,3.0,1/16/2014,"No Reservations. My mother and I ventured to this location for lunch after an busy morning of shopping in Union Square.   Since my mother had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before, I suggested we stop in for lunch since we were in the area. LOCATION/SETTING:  Top floor of Macy's (women's store).  Accessible via escalator or elevator.  Seating is either indoors or outdoors on their patio overlooking union square park.   Though we arrived slightly past 1pm, surprisingly we were still quoted a wait of 30 minutes.  A pager was given though we (as well as other parties) waited near the check-in podium.  Some opted to wait on the patio while others left since the wait was too long.  In the end, we waited roughly 35-40 minutes. FOOD:  The menu is very diverse with many, many selections.  They include appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, etc., and of course, dessert. 1.  Turkey Burger:  My mother's choice.  Served with a small salad.  She found it satisfactory as she finished most of it. 2.  Pasta Da Vinci (lunch portion):  The menu has a lunch section where smaller portions of their sandwiches/pastas/entrees are offered. I've had this pasta before and I thought it was ok. It wasn't as memorable as at other locations where I've ordered this dish.  It was slightly undercooked to say the least.  I ate most of it since I was quite hungry.  3. Seasonal pumpkin cheesecake: Huge slice with a big dollop of whip cream. Not overly sweet. A great way to end the meal. SERVICE: Not great. The server, though polite and friendly, was slightly forgetful. He neglected to write down my order which prevented my food from being dropped off at the same time as my mother's.  My mom was hungry so I told her to go ahead and start eating.  Drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and there was a delay (for some reason) in getting the check. BOTTOM LINE: Convenient location. Ok food. Below satisfactory service."
Andrew L.,"Cypress, TX",1,4,,1.0,12/16/2016,Waiting time is insanely slow. Waited over 2.5 hours to no avail. Buzzer did not go off and they said we would get a seat in 5-10 min but the buzzer still did not go off. Had to ask a third time.
Jorge L.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/16/2016,"Quoted 45 minutes, waited two hours. Messed up my order too. I get it's a busy spot but come on... figure out the logistics. Side note, if you want people to actually sit outside on a cold day use more than two space heaters or get some custom tents to fit the patio space. It would have alleviated the indoor congestion some."
Jaryl C.,"Singapore, Singapore",2,2,3,4.0,7/4/2016,"The wait times are incredibly long (about an hour and a half), but they do provide a wireless finger which guests on the waiting list can carry around the mall as they shop and buzz them when it is their turn. The entrees also did take around half an hour to prepare, I had the Pasta Carbonara and it was pretty good. My group and I had 5 cheese cake and they all tasted really good. Especially the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Quite happy with my experience if I overlook the long waiting times."
Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,5.0,4/28/2015,This place is amazing the staff is always so friendly and so nice! If you want to sit outside make sure you make a reservation or ask very nicely to see if they have any tables available outside see you can see Union Square and the busy city life from a top Macy's
Lorie N.,"San Jose, CA",524,539,551,4.0,1/22/2014,"I love coming here on a perfect day and sitting outside on the terrace where you have the most amazing views of Union Square.  Having gone this past Monday for Martin Luther King's day it was unusually warm for the city and we scored a table in under 15 minutes.  I ordered a Steak Diane for the first time and was surprised at how tasty this was. The chunks of meat were seasoned nicely with the wine sauce and the mashed potatoes were so good that I couldn't help forking small mounds into my mouth. Before I knew it my meat was being ignored. Is that possible?  Apparently so.    And the weather?  Just perfect. Sunny, with the heat lamps on the lowest setting-- just enough to keep us so that we could sit comfortably without our jackets on.  If you have the opportunity, sit outside to experience this yourself. The views are worth it alone. Pair it with good friends, yummy food and you couldn't ask for a better day."
Lynnae G.,"Oakland, CA",0,4,3,4.0,12/29/2016,"So I'm native to the Bay Area and it's no surprise that there is always a LONG wait here at the Cheesecake.   If you want a quick bite then this ISN'T the place to come. Show up with an appetite, the meals are huge. The wait time can be as long as 30min. -- 1hr45min so be prepared. Lastly, while waiting go visit Macy's downstairs or hang out at the Macy's Starbucks or Tout Sweet Cafe."
