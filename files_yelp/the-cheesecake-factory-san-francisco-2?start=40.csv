Steven W.,"Anaheim, CA",172,746,2081,4.0,8/19/2017,Will always have a line and wait time. You take the elevator up from Macy's. They do have outside dining with a view of Union Square but the restaurant itself is already large!
Elaine S.,"London, United Kingdom",6,107,28,5.0,9/17/2017,Came here for lunch on our last day in San Francisco and it was the perfect place to enjoy a farewell meal. Two of us had the Californian omelette and one the breakfast burrito. Delicious and huge portions! The service was great and we sat outside on the terrace enjoying the sunshine and the sounds of Union Square. We arrived about 12.30 and only had to wait 10 minutes for a table. At the end of the meal we shared a cheesecake - choosing one out of the long list was hard to do! The menu is long and varied and I'm sure everyone would find something they like.
Maimuna F.,"Union City, CA",12,27,15,4.0,1/2/2018,"Although the hosts were very rude in the front and not kind at all, our server made it up. My cousin from Germany came to visit so we decided to take her out to SF and eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory with a view of the tree and ice skating rink. Our server name was Nicholas (Nick) and he was very kind and nice. He greeted us right away and brought us drinks as soon as he could since it was very busy. I love Cheesecake bread and butter so I asked for two baskets and without any hestitation he brought out two baskets! So nice! Other cheesecake factory tell me I can't or give me attitude. We ordered our food & got it very fresh and hot. His service was amazing, next time I come I want him again to be our server! Amazing job Nick"
Jalpa P.,"Santa Clara, CA",3,14,,1.0,11/10/2017,"Very very bad Management we waited for more than 100 mins (6000 secs) for a party of 8 to get the table. Manager was David and he told us we will get the table in 90 mins, we patiently waited but never got any response from cheesecake staff of how long will it take.. People come to cheesecake for good food but there MAN and TIME management needs a lot of improvement I wish they can be more predictable about the wait times or atleast have some courtsey to appreciate our time."
David G.,"CA, CA",482,1659,5005,4.0,2/15/2017,"I love this cheesecake factory location; especially the dinning patio outside overlooking Union Square. The food is consistent, the menu varied, and service is always pleasant and helpful. Prices are pretty reasonable for the portion and quality. BTW they have now listed the calories for each dish......dam....1900 calories?  that is a whole days worth....yikes!!!! Wait times are insane so be prepared for at least an hour to two hours wait on busy nights. Great bar...and dont forget their amazing cheesecakes....god they are good!"
Rick J.,"Gridley, CA",2,3,,3.0,1/1/2018,Food is okay. The cheese cake is great. We recently visited the one and the waiter lost our credit card on his way to ring us up.
Andrew F.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/4/2018,"This is probably good restaurant in bay area. Usually they always busy. But we got lucky and waited only 20min( original estimate was 45min). Our server was so friendly. The bread is so fresh and I had Steak Diana, my wife had chicken piccata. Food was delicious. We'll be definitely go back to this restaurant."
Roxy B.,"Stockton, CA",10,16,38,5.0,12/3/2017,"We came here for my sisters birthday the first weekend in December. The Tree was lighted outside and the view was amazing from the top. We arrived before the dinner rush at about 4:30pm and they said about 1 hour wait and where actually seated before that with only 45 minute wait. Our server was great and the food was delicious from our appetizers, bread and main dish. I really liked the Sangria drink it was very refreshing. We will definitely come again. I love this place."
Arev L.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,164,256,4.0,11/22/2017,"Tuesday night, we got there around 6:15pm. Super crowded. We requested to be seated outside so we got our table at 7:28p.m. the wait were longer. Understandable.  Server was nice man. Sadly, he took a break right after he took our order. He told his partner that we need our drinks and bread.Then the waiting game start again. Waited for another 40 minutes for a basket of bread. By that time, I actually stand up and walked in, to complaint, (the table next to us which came after us, already finished with their bread. )  AND I have a very hungry young kid.  Amazingly, as I walked in, the waiter walked right in front of me with a basket full of bread. the smell of the warm bread calmed me down. Anyway, less than 5 minutes that we got the bread, our food started to came too 8:22. Had to flag to get drinks refill. Then our original waiter came back from his break dressed up in a festive hat and tie. ( He was very nice older gentleman, I didn't catch his name, sorry ).  Good conversation, good companion, good food, that's all that matters!!"
Sierra W.,"San Francisco, CA",457,25,2,1.0,10/24/2017,"Tip begging? Disgusting. ""Benaster J"" really made us uncomfortable. I come to cheesecake all of the time but it's about time that we find somewhere else to come weekly."
Kira B.,"Daly City, CA",0,11,1,1.0,8/5/2017,"No no no. Nice view if you wanna come and just take a picture. Would be nice to seat and grab a drink or a cheese cake but that would take you 3 hours of waiting. The food is not good at all. My shrimp angel hair pasta was without pasta, 4 shrimps and just all the plate full of tomatoes. It was just not eatable."
Bobby V.,"Riverside, CA",119,6,8,1.0,12/28/2017,Waited 2 hours and the almost an hour for our food. The hostess was really rude. I'll never come back to this place
Sean M.,"Dublin, CA",432,474,621,4.0,1/4/2017,"Ok so I RARELY review chains, mainly because I try and avoid them as much as possible.  I have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in maybe 12 years or so and was hesitant. But, friends wanted to go and there are not a ton of family friendly options downtown SF. So, we went. First, the line was INSANE. Like 1.5 hours for a table. Not sure if it's regularly that bad or because it was holiday weekend. We got a table outside quicker because we were fine with it. We could suffer through the cold.  The menu is ridiculous. They have everything. And lots of it. We decided to go all in and eat junky. We had a few fried appetizers then decided on burgers and fries. We're vegetarian but they substituted veggie burgers into another burger combo with no problems. It was fantastically unhealthy food.  Feeling absolutely stuffed, we still got a slice of cheesecake which is the size of a full meal there!  I'd 100% go back if we were in sf and we're craving a spot like this. Great view of Union Square as well.  Great times and more than OK food!"
Scot M.,"Turlock, CA",81,33,18,1.0,12/24/2017,I love this restaurant but I was super disappointed in the quality of my disk. We had a big group so it added to the issue. But... My food was cold. One other person had to send his steak back. I think they should expect big groups especially this time of year. It's too bad because they have an amazing menu but that means nothing if the food is chilly.
Joseph R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,1.0,12/30/2017,"Waited 15 minutes to check in downstairs. Had to come back 40 minutes later to check in upstairs to get a buzzer, then kept going back to the desk and ask when will I be seated and each time they kept pushing people ahead of us. Then finally complained and they sat us in the back table in patio. We already knew what we wanted to order and ordered immediately sitting down. Which then took us another 45 minutes to get one dish mind you there was two of us. So I ate my food alone until a manager came out and brought the 2nd dish. He just apologized for the wait. I had to literally ask him is there anything else he can do for me besides an apology, maybe discounts free drinks free something. He then gave us a cheesecake for free. NOT COOL!!! This turn out to be a 3 1/2 hour event when it should've been 2 hours."
Joshua M.,"San Francisco, CA",161,407,1538,2.0,1/12/2017,"On the upper floor of the SF downtown Macy's lies The Cheesecake Factory. Being in such a prime location, the wait can be especially long during peak hours. I've come here twice or so over the previous year and have found it to be rather mediocre overall.  The service was not great, but not terribly bad as well. The food however always ends up being especially bland despite its nice and flavorful appearance. Their fried appetizers are somewhat decent with good heat and crisp, but their pasta tends to be overcooked such that there is a lack of firmness. I've tried another Cheesecake Factory branch in the past and find this establishment to be quite lacking in food quality compared to it. The cheesecake here is quite disappointing as well with it being a mush that tastes of cream and sugar without much substance and depth of flavor. The main positive of this restaurant has to be its location though. If you're able to get an outdoor seat for lunch on a nice sunny day in SF then you'll be treated to a wonderful view of union square though more often or not, there's going to be construction going on."
Sonny I.,"Hercules, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2017,"It's our wedding anniversary, we had lunch here, arrived at 12:30 pm of 12/29/17. We were told wait time is 50 minutes. There's a lot of people waiting so I wasn't surprised we got the table after 1 hour & 15 mins. The lady who accompanied me to the table was looking for the other 2 as we reserved for 3 people, told her they went downstairs. She told me next time at least 2 people must be waiting & not just leave (well, if they were true to their words wait time was 50 minutes, they would have been around). Anyway, told her they bought a sandwich in Starbucks as my daughter was hungry waiting.  We were ready to order as we were really hungry(obviously it's almost 2 pm). Anyway to make the long story short, we got the main course order after over an hour, steak BURNT & we were told the other order was lost & was given to another table. So they have to cook it again....another wait. We never complained to anybody (we always don't when we eat in a resto) as we're afraid they might put something on our food before they serve it. Waiter was not even apologetic about the situation."
Eric R.,"Twin Peaks, San Francisco, CA",113,118,472,4.0,6/20/2017,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan! Okay, I'll be honest I'm a cheesecake anything fan. So, you had me at cheesecake! I don't come here frequently, maybe once or twice a year. And even though I always walk out with cheesecake to go d'oh... I usually have a meal while I'm there too.  The location on Union Square in the heart of San Francisco makes this Cheesecake Factory maybe the busiest in the entire chain. The confusing part about this location is finding the entrance. If I recall, the actual restaurant is on the 8th floor of the historic Macy's building and you can only get there via the elevator entered at street level. I've been to this location several times and every-time there's a wait. Is it worth the wait? Probably not, but if you like cheesecake like I do then it's well worth it. It's up to you to decide. Oh, maybe this tip might help too... there's two lines (1) for the restaurant (2) for takeout. So make sure you're in the right one!  The lunch & dinner menu is typical American grub like hamburgers, but also small plates, salads, and specialties too. Who's fooling who? It's a chain restaurant, but I admit my weakness here is their cheesecake! My favorites include the original cheesecake, the fresh strawberry cheesecake, the tiramisu cheesecake... oh please! To be perfectly honest any cheesecake in front of me will be happily devoured. And the freshness, taste, and endless selection is what separates Cheesecake Factory from all the rest!  In a way I am glad I'm usually here only once a year. Imagine if I was a regular? My waistline? C'mon plus no stairs to burn off the cheesecake calories?! Hmph! I'll be back again pressing that 8th floor elevator button..."
Camille F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,2,3.0,11/27/2017,"Great food, but the bathrooms...take a look! I believe that maintaining bathrooms are a huge deal especially in an industry like this. There was no toilet paper in 3/4 stalls, and paper towels everywhere. I'm guessing the cleaners weren't on duty this night. Do better Cheesecake!"
Chris S.,"San Francisco, CA",51,185,474,5.0,1/18/2017,"""Reviewing a cheesecake factory? I mean, come on Chris...everyone knows what those are! And don't I hear you complaining about chain casual dining all the time? I'm surprised you even went there...let alone reviewed it"" ""Just read it...there's reasons..."" ""FIVE STARS? Are you out of your mind?"" ""Look boss, just because it's /A/ cheesecake factory doesn't mean it has to be part of a mall in suburbia filled with soccer mom's and tween birthday parties! Well, okay, there was a tween birthday party last time I was there, but...it's a rooftop bar with outdoor seating! The view of the city is amazing, and the location is fantastic."" ""They paid you, didn't they..."" ""Just because they had the Slice of Life promotion doesn't mean I was paid off! Anyone could get those free cheesecakes."" ""Okay, well, you better fess up that the food is still unhealthy."" ""That's true, no doubt, but that's actually a complaint...they seem to have scaled back on portions and up on prices. But the drinks are still a stiff pour...and the cheesecake prices seem reasonable by SF standards!"" ""I guess...at least they've probably got plenty of tables."" ""Yeah, but that's something to watch out for, still...anytime it's nice out this place is gonna be swamped."" ""But still...five stars?!"" ""The view and outdoor roottop bar alone mean I'll bring friends from out of town here sometimes...though maybe for drinks and cheesecake, not dinner...and you KNOW I only take them to the best SF has to offer!"" ""Okay...MAYBE I'll let you print this, Chris...but you better investigate other SF cheesecakes too, dammit!"" ""Oh no boss, not that! [MOCK TERROR]"" And scene."
