Wil H.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,3,,1.0,12/12/2016,updating this must of happend so much they have a automated online response -- comedy --- i should use this cheezecake factory experience in a comedy skit
Chinda O.,"Oakland, CA",249,42,105,4.0,4/20/2016,"I came here because my significant other wanted to eat the food he haven't had in a while. The food here is always good but he complained that it wasn't as good as how it use to be. I could care less on how it use to be just as long as the entrees have good flavors, but I do agree that this place could use some happier waiters."
Nicolette C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,17,,1.0,12/10/2016,Although I have been here many times in the past with no issue this last visit was awful. It clearly has tumbled down to being a complete tourist trap. It's unfortunate that the staff does not feel they have to provide a good experience given that people will come no matter what due to the location. Unfortunately we had bad service at every turn. It's a shame really but I certainly will no longer recommend this as a place to go.
Pamela G.,"Daly City, CA",215,9,3,3.0,11/27/2016,"Expect this place to be full and busy during the holidays, weekends and evenings. On a regular day during lunch, expect to wait about 15-30 minutes. My date and I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes on a weekend night. Servers were quick, attentive, and accommodating. The food portions are huge! On the bright side, this restaurant is right in the middle of union square with tons of shops and things to see if you have to wait a long time!"
Martin O.,"Bunratty, Republic of Ireland",12,1,,2.0,9/11/2016,I have eaten in various Cheesecake factories around the US however this was my worst experience to date. My Girlfriend and I arrived at 830 and were told we needed to wait 15 mins at 930 we eventually got our seat. Our waitress who did try to help as much as possible didn't take our order for another 20 mins. At 0950 my girlfriends main course arrived and at 1015 my main arrived. They were the exact same main which was very annoying.. Poor overall experience in this restaurant
Stephan Z.,"Buc, France",38,59,33,5.0,4/23/2015,Heavenly cheesecakes. Fast and good service. Really one my the favorites with a rooftopview over unionsquare. Big pies and free drinks.
Wendy M.,"Torrance, CA",42,221,345,3.0,11/25/2016,"the food is ok, decent, had the clam chowder and their bread basket is actually good!  Hamburger and fries were good, juicy and perfectly cooked medium rare.  Spaghetti Carbonara was good too.  This place sitting outside at night was perfect, heaters and best view of union square"
Briana H.,"San Francisco, CA",580,222,34,1.0,1/17/2015,"This has to be the most disappointing Cheesecake Factory Visit EVER! The only glimmer of happiness was the quality of service we received. Our server was awesome--attentive, funny, and well mannered.  I've been a loyal customer for 12+ years now, as long as I could go out by myself with my friends! In high school, I came to this restaurant to celebrate countless birthdays, ""fancy"" dinners, and would spend an occasional ""splurge"" on a dinner. Mind you, I was a teenager and money was scarce.  As time passed, I've seen the decline in food and subtle changes that ""crunched the numbers"". They are very minuscule, but it goes to show the restaurant is trying to decrease expenses and increase profit. With every business, this is the main goal. Disclosure: I am not disagreeing with the changes, but rather just stating my observations.  1. The bread: Basket with linen cloth napkin that kept the bread warm. Now, it is served exposed and in a white disposable napkin. (less dirty napkins) 2. Butter: Butter is no longer in a separate bowl. It is nestled and squeezed between breads. (less dishes) 3. Silverware: Before, placed in linen napkins. Now, silverware is on the supposedly clean table. (less time preparing the silverware bundles) Beyond the subtle changes, is the quality of food. We go to restaurants and occasionally order the same ""go-to"" dish, right? Well yes, I've ordered the Pasta Da Vinci 19/20 times, approximately. It's something that I've always looked forward to and didn't mind waiting 45+ minutes to get. The buttery, wine, caramelized onions, mushroom sauce over penne pasta was my favorite dish of all time.  Last night, I ordered the dish again with expectations of the same great tasting dish I've had since I was 13 years old. I was mistaken. At first bite, I noticed the difference. The once, flavorful and creamy pasta was now a diluted shame. What a disappointment. My only regret, is that i didn't call attention to the Server and Manger  with my disapproval. I honestly think I was just in disbelief that I continued to eat the dish hoping to taste the same great flavor I've grown to remember.  One more thing, the cheesecake. They're smaller, significantly smaller. My ""go to"" cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche. I don't even look at the menu after a big heavy meal, it's Dulce De Leche all the way! Although the cheesecake did not go down in quality, it went down in quantity. The dessert is no longer humongous and topped with big chunks of candied caramel, but rather a decent portion with tiny speckles of caramel. Ok, so you may be thinking, it's decent, so why complain? My point being is that I'm getting less than what I've got in the past. However, I am ok with this change, it's quality over quantity. So what's the cause of all these changes in this establishment? Inflation? Change in Management? Business strategy? Maybe all of the above. I get it. Things change and this is a business, It's the nature of the field.  The only gripe I have is that the quality of the food SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED. For me, it's quality over quantity. I would like to spend my hard earned money for good food. Cheesecake Factory Management, please consider this review. Thank you."
Ledam O.,"Daly City, CA",44,77,51,4.0,4/25/2015,"I love this place for food and drinks and view! I only hate how busy it gets and sometimes the wait seems unbearable, however it's a given since a lot of tourists go here. It is centralized in the heart of Union Square.  I usually get the Hibatchi Steak which comes with mashed potatoes, cut up steak, asparagus, all this over caramelized onions/mushrooms/beansprouts.  I also like the crab dip, calamari, and baked mushrooms.  Must try all! Its funny how I dont get cheesecake though, because after every meal im always full. beware, parking is not free, no free parking around this location!  Service is 7/10"
Vina R.,"State College, PA",121,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,Extremely BAD service!!! I've been to other cheesecake factories and had a great experience but this one I would give a TOTALLY NEVER-go-to suggestion!!!
Rey G.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,15,,3.0,11/21/2016,Classic place to go to if you know what you want to eat. A lot of selections for everyone. My favorite is their Eggrolls and Crispy Chicken Costaletta.  Did not have great experience with their customer service especially their Hostess on the night of Nov. 12. Not very welcoming at all!!
Amanda B.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",72,126,158,4.0,1/20/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. It took me about 10 minutes to get a table (in a weekday!). While I was waiting I choose what I wanted to eat, so, when I got to the table the waitress came quickly and I ordered a Caesar Salad with chicken. That was the biggest salad I've even seen in my life! Really, I could easily have shared it with 3 more people. Obviously, I couldn't eat all of it and I still needed space in my stomach for the cheesecake!  I ordered the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake, which is delicious! I'll probably go back there before I leave San Francisco. It's a lovely place, nice ambience, but prices are a little expensive. However, if you're going only for the Cheesecake, I think it's worth it."
Jhygs P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",7,8,21,2.0,2/7/2017,"Went to see my best friend in college who works for an Int'l airline and was in SF for an overnight crew lay over. Took her here to grab some dinner and to do some catching up. She had a glass of Zin & I had a glass of Sangria - this sangria is the most bland of all the sangrias I ever tasted my whole life, what ever amount of dollars I got charged for it, for sure wasn't worth it. We ordered fish taco, turkey/avocado sandwich  & sweet potato fries which tasted plain, zero yumm factor, honest. For desert, we had lattes & a piece of caramel cheesecake to share, I must say that my individually wrapped instant coffee taste 100% better than their coffee, but of course needless to say that the cheesecake was super good. My bill came up to $79.00 plus 18% tip because our server was very nice. Why 2 stars? Well, it's for employee's dishonesty and lack of integrity. I dropped my Gucci glass case that night and did not noticed it until the next day, I called to ask if they have it in their lost & found but the person I talked to said that they don't have it. I asked to speak to the day time manager but the guy wasn't sure or  have no any idea if they have a lost and found area or not. Just frustrating, it was just a glass case people, c'mon!"
Vikas J.,"Fremont, CA",5,118,28,1.0,12/28/2015,"Absolutely pathetic front desk service. The lady was very rude. Instead of being polite and telling us that we could not exchange our number with another couple we knew and were a few turns ahead of us, she makes a face and tells me she can't accept it and used words like ""caught you"" when the swap happened in front of her at the reception.  That left a bad taste in my mouth especially on a date night and we decided to find another late night spot. Not planning to go to this place again!"
Isha G.,"Daly City, CA",0,9,2,2.0,11/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat, I'm working in Macy's for the holidays and since I have a 30 minute lunch break, I thought why not order for pick up to make it quick and easy. I went to pick up my food and they sent me off and when I opened my bag, they didn't put my $8 cheesecake in my bag. Wtf. So I have to walk all the way back to the 7th floor to get my cheesecake. By the time I get it, all I have is 10 minutes to eat my food and get back to work, and all the said was ""hold on a sec, we're sorry."""
Aaryn K.,"Winchester, CA",34,2,,1.0,11/26/2016,HORRIBLE!! Bad customer service! Hey I know it's Thanksgiving weekend and all but get your shit together! Waited for 2 hours after checking in to be told we never did and we have to wait again!!! WTF! Never again!
Steven C.,"San Francisco, CA",119,6,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Terrible experience... Again.  The experience goes as follows:  Sat immediately Waitress comes 5 minutes later Drinks 10 minutes later Order 10 minutes later So now we're 25 minutes in, just ordered and have watched tables that came after us with their food Inform me my meal does not have pasta 5 minutes later We continue to wait- now 40 minutes and no food At this point my party and I are over it I ask to speak manger Matt comes out and says he'll get the food  Food comes out 5 minutes later We eat our meal in 9 minutes because we were on a lunch break Manager( Matt) never comes back to apologize or check in.  I work in customer service and let me tell you.. This is not a priority at CCF. 80 bucks wasted on 9 minutes of dining and poor service."
Brandi G.,"San Bruno, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/11/2017,"I have no kind words for the poorest excuse for service that I've received here on May 8th 2017. This restaurant has completely failed in customer service &  the food quality department without a doubt..  we waited & waited & waited & then waited some more...   we waited to be seated for ages. We Decided  we would go to the bar and have a drink to pass the time. Upon arriving at the bar, the seats were all full with people eating there dinners. there was no place for us to even order a drink.. surely they are losing more business/money by feeding people at the bar that stay there for a long time, then to serve people an over priced drink that move along quit quickly.. so after being seated without getting the drinks we wanted, we decided then that we were put  off the cocktails & would just have soda.. upon ordering the drinks, we were told that they didn't have any soft drinks available do to the fact that the machine had broke  REALLY?!?! Unbelievable!!  So we waited for what seemed like days for our water that we ordered to be served. we waited again for our food that was not as described on the menu &  was  served slightly warmer then room temperature. Upon notifying our waitress about our issues with the food, you'll never guess that she actually asked us to WAIT again.. she said we needed to wait to talk to her manager. Reluctantly we sat and waited some more. About 15-20 min before we just got up and left.. We waited ALL that time without complaining & then waited some more & the manager we were waiting for never even came out in the 15-20 that we sat there waiting for them..  Needless to say, We will never be returning to Cheesecake Factory anytime in the near future & definitely never again to this one!!! It was a total waste of over 2 hours of our evening & we didn't even get to eat.. Completely disappointed with the whole experience.."
Lisa L.,"San Leandro, CA",175,132,72,2.0,1/16/2016,"I came here on Christmas Eve with my friends visiting from out of state. Of course it was extremely packed. We arrived around 6pm to get our name on the wait list and we waited about 3 and a half hours until we finally got seated. I understand that on a holiday it can be very hectic but the workers were very disorganized and did not properly communicate to all of those who were waiting. They did not say we could choose to sit at the bar area, so when a family that just came in took the table, we were pretty outraged. They should have let everyone know that there are other seatings available besides the regular inside arrangement. However I will give this place two stars because the food was good and our waiter was very nice."
Kevin C.,"San Francisco, CA",170,1,,2.0,6/16/2017,"Never coming back. Waited over an hour and a half during un-busy hours, tables empty beside us, noticeably slow hours, for undercooked meatballs and hard rice.  When our entrees came to the table, the plates were noticeably hotter than the food. The rice was no longer even warm, room temperature at best, and the pasta we ordered was barely warm. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because of the kind waiter who actually gave an effort to make us feel welcome and help us enjoy our visit."
