Chelsea R.,"Pacifica, CA",393,31,1,3.0,1/1/2016,"My family and I come here every year during the holidays... What started off rough was turned around by the right people. We came in today (1/1 at 4pm)  We walked in as a party of 5. We were told they were no longer seating groups larger than 4 together. We were told we would be sat On opposite sides of the restaurant and there was no guarantee that we would even be sitting at the same time. First off- that is completely unacceptable. I understand being busy.. Coming during the holidays you usually wait 3 hours+ it was pleasant to hear of only 70 min wait.. But not on those circumstances..  I don't remember all the names of the employees we interacted with but I will describe it...  The hostess (Latina with pony tail and blue nails) was completely rude. She gave me all kinds of attitude. I was shocked.. I know you are busy but if you can't handle heat as an employee, I suggest not working there!! I didn't feel like dealing with someone acting like an immature child so I asked for the manager..  The manager came over (tall thin blonde) and completely explained the situation.. She was super sweet.. We ended up changing my reservation to 4 people so we could guarantee a table together and then I just grabbed an extra chair.. Thankfully our table was big enough. We made it work.  What completely turned our night around was our awesome waiter, David L. He was fast, attentive, personable, and was busting his ass. He kept his composure the whole time though it was super busy. Like I said, we come every year and he truly made the night for us. He is the best waiter I have ever had. He deserves major kudos... Management please reward him!  Food was good as always!  I am taking off two stars because of the rude hostess.. Thank you again to the manager and especially David L for making our family dinner great!"
Neta G.,"Berkeley, CA",63,22,1,1.0,7/20/2016,"I ate here a couple of times before but never experienced anything like what happens this evening. While the food was okay, it took extremely long time to get to our table. The waitress kept coming back apologizing that everything is taking so long, but it kept happening with every single thing we ordered - appetizers, main course, and even dessert - took a ridiculous time. Our waitress was nice, I'm assuming it wasn't her fault. Finally, the bathroom looked like no one has cleaned there in quite a while, trash all over the floor, no toilet paper in any of the stalls, not pleasant to enter and makes me wonder about sanitation... Overall, very disappointing experience."
Tiffany D.,"Pittsburg, CA",85,75,47,4.0,12/3/2014,After a long men's Macy's trip this place hit the spot!  Didn't take long to get seated. Granted we visited on a Tuesday @3pm. We love sitting outside despite the chilly weather- make sure you request this a head of time AND ask for a window seat!  We ordered Louisiana pasta and chicken Alfredo- they have lunchtime portions available until 5pm. Not for us though!! Both dishes came out hot and fresh. Both were on point but the Louisiana pasta was exceptionally good. I would for sure get this again.   We topped off our Linner (lunch/dinner) with turtle cheesecake and coffee! Bomb!!
Rebeca G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,8,1,1.0,2/13/2017,"Waitress brought the wrong order, and the jambalaya was extremely dry.   When we asked for more sauce he brought something like water!  My friend could not eat that.   We were in a hurry and because he brought something wrong my other friend didn't have times to eat and we end eating a hot dog in the street.  Also the shrimp in my plate and in the jambalaya were as hard as a rock.   Definitely I can't recommend this place. And it wasn't busy at all. Oh, and another thing, the bathrooms were filthy"
Sarah B.,"San Francisco, CA",47,10,1,3.0,8/30/2016,"We decided to celebrate my friend's birthday party there on a tuesday evening. The line was very long as always, after an hour waiting we were finally seated! The food was so so, I ordered and eggplant parmesan that is nothing like I had before, not authentic. My biggest disappointment was the fact that we wanted to order a few cheesecakes and they ran out of almost everything.  I'm giving 3 stars for our very agreable and helpful server!"
Alisa K.,"Honolulu, HI",245,96,392,3.0,12/12/2015,"The food is great, and there is a TON OF SELECTION, especially for cheesecake. Also, the servers are very attentive and friendly.  But its not worth the wait, unless I'm going because I specifically want to eat at cheesecake factory, I feel that there are many much less known but just as good if not better places to eat.  You will have to wait anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half on any night weekday or weekend doesn't matter. There are lots of seating but they are all very close together, a very ""family restaurant"" type of atmosphere.  Foods good though, a little pricey for what it is I think, but usually ends with leftovers so I can't really complain.  Happy Munching~"
Susan J.,"Turlock, CA",33,38,,5.0,1/17/2016,"While in San Francisco why would someone go to a chain restaurant?  I had a gift card I was carrying around for 2-years and made it my mission to use it today.    Our experience was awesome in part for the great couple we met at the bar while waiting for our table but  most of all the bartender Ashwini, she is AWESOME!  She suggested great cocktails and wonderful entrees and was over and above attentive even at our coffee stage of the dinner.   Ashwini is the type of employee that make a chain restaurant special!  She was getting offers to bartend at a private party from a patron!  Will go again and call before had if she's bartending"
José R.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,6,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Food was great (Chicken Madeira &  Pasta Da Vinci). Penny, our wonderful waitress, took great of us, thanks girl!"
Fedi A.,"San Francisco, CA",11,33,143,2.0,12/14/2015,Honestly my first time not tipping a server: was I wrong for not leaving a tip?  My experience today at Cheesecake Factory went from a 10 to -1 when the servers switched. We sat in the bar area for lattes and a late lunch. Our first server (did not catch her name but we were there around 3:45pm) was sweet and amazing!!!!!! Then around 5pm she told us her day was over and introduced us to another server (will not mention name). He never checked on us and when we asked for our bill he seemed annoyed. When he brought back our change he overpaid us by $20. I brought it to his attention and he seemed annoyed again rather than thankful. I was surprised by his attitude- would he rather be short?  Corn soup was good; sent back my salmon dish because the lemon sauce tasted like mayo. Manager apologized and said they messed up the ingredients of the sauce by adding too much starch and thanked me for bringing it to their attention. On a positive note the Caramel Latte was delicious! Thank you to the first server!
Millie E.,"Stockton, CA",21,28,46,4.0,1/16/2016,"This review would have had 5 stars if our outdoor heater was working but we were seated by one that was broken -_- Besides that, my boyfriend and I were in the city for the weekend for our anniversary and this dinner was by far the best food wise that weekend. We both got steak dishes. Both were cooked perfectly medium and my ceasar salad was amazing as always here. Funny thing is we had dinner the night before at Scoma's and paid $95 which for the price wasn't as worth it as compared to our meal at cheesecake factory :) So 2 thumbs up here! (Just please Oh please fix that outdoor heater to the far left. Sitting outside in January is a bit nippy) :)"
Judy H.,"Oakland, CA",105,51,59,3.0,3/31/2016,"I come here more often than I like to admit. I generally order from the take-out counter but once in a while I'll eat there. Whenever I do dine in, the service is okay.  But the take-out counter is a hit or miss depending on who is working there. Sometimes the person is completely clueless as to what you're trying to order, and other times they're fast and efficient. The general wait time for my food lasts from 20-50 minutes depending on whether the person at the counter feels like getting my food (I can see it sitting there on their kitchen counter and I just want to go grab it myself)  My general go to is the Chicken Madeira. My boyfriend likes the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. The food tastes more or less the same as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It's pretty overpriced but the portions are okay.   The cheesecakes are okay. I like trying the different flavors. If I had to only stick to one it'd probably be the red velvet or the tuxedo."
Jasmine C.,"Menifee, CA",311,52,99,4.0,1/2/2016,My boyfriend and I arrived right when they opened at 11am. This is the perfect time to go especially if you want a good seat with the view. Don't hesitate to sit outside because they have heaters surrounding you all around. Service was quick and they were so nice. Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and Kobe Burger. Both orders were great in portions.
Jarleen V.,"San Jose, CA",827,256,348,2.0,10/28/2014,"I hate to write such a low rating review for a place that I used to love so much. My experience here was just a mess. I'm generally a nice person who doesn't let the smallest things bother me, but when I'm hungry, I am the lady version of the Hulk. My boyfriend, his mom, and I were in the city for the weekend and decided to eat here at the Cheesecake Factory, rather than the pier (where we really wanted to go), but we didn't want to drive over and find parking again. It all started when we checked in with the hostesses for 3 people. They gave us a buzzer for a wait of 15-20 minutes. We are pretty patient people but it came to a point where my boyfriend had to ask if we were going to be seated soon. We ended up sitting outside, which we didn't mind - because it was very warm inside. I thought the view was beautiful, but all the birds flying around and swooping other people's food was quite a show. My boyfriend who is terrified of birds didn't enjoy our seat but we did say that we didn't mind sitting in or out. We even saw a bird fly into their glass doors! All you heard was a loud THUD. Lol! We ordered the spinach and cheese dip for an appetizer. The portion looked amazing because we were starving to death. (Just kidding, but you get it.) When we took our first bite, it was okay because we were hungry but um...? It was SO bland. Literally no taste - it was like tasting air. We were bummed because we always get this appetizer when we come to CF and this one was meh. We had it sent back to the kitchen. When we got it back, it just looked like they added more to it and it tasted like more cheese. Personally, it just needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper. When we seasoned it ourselves, it tasted a thousand times better. Maybe they were lacking in seasoning their food? I don't know. My boyfriend ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and that tasted amazing as always! We both love that dish. I ordered the Garlic Noodles. I seriously had high hopes for this because again, I was seriously so hungry! When my food arrived, I was ready to dig in until I flipped my chicken... I FOUND A HAIR. This has never happened to me and I was very disappointed. I told our server, she apologized and so did a manager(?), I was offered a soup/salad but I honestly just wanted my main entree. They had it remade but I feel like this time they added more sauce to it, which I didn't like. I took a few bites and had it packed to-go. I love Cheesecake Factory and their wide varieties of food on their menu. There's so much to choose from, along with their famous desserts. My experience here was so poor, but thank you to the lady that served us for being patient with us!"
Joyce C.,"San Francisco, CA",116,75,50,2.0,3/21/2016,"I enjoy coming to this specific Cheesecake Factory location because of the amazing view on the patio although the food isn't all that great. The wait is always at least an hour long but you can kill time shopping. However I've never experienced such terrible service at the CF until yesterday. There is nothing special about the food. Bf and I got the tater tots appetizer, farfalle garlic pasta and the mushroom burger. It wasn't the worst but I had better elsewhere costing us less. We got the red velvet cheesecake which was extremely sweet for us.  When we got seated, we noticed right away that our plates was dirty. We asked our server TWICE for clean plates but she never brought it to us. She also didn't refill our waters and continued to clear our table when we weren't finished with our food. Clearly, there was some food left on our plates but she didn't bother asking for a box and took our plates instead."
Chris C.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, CA",18,8,,3.0,10/30/2015,"This was a busy place, but my review score doesn't take that into account. (I swear I've seen people give low scores because of ridiculous reason like having a hard time finding parking). Anyways, the main point is that this place charges too much for mediocre food. Dry steaks and overcooked burgers. My GF ordered a medium rare steak and it turned out so rare, that you coud see Gordon Ramsey memes flowing out from the steak (along with blood). We got them to cook it a bit more. I don't know how they did it, but it turned out pretty dry. The pasta was ok, but it tasted average to me.  The cheesecakes are pretty damn good, but that's the only thing notable about this place (I mean, their cheesecake better to be good or else they better change their name to Dry Ass Steak Factory). I will only come here for the cheesecake from now on (you could get food that is way better for the price elsewhere). Get the lemon raspberry cheesecake, it's a perfect mixture of tart and sweetness in a cheesecake. tl;dr: come here for cheesecakes and nothing else."
Loretta C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3524,954,21688,4.0,10/9/2014,"This is a decent Cheesecake factory, with the same good quality food as other locations.  I like that this is located at the top floor of the building (the sign said 7th but it is on the 8th floor).  The wait is a bit long and it is very fast paced since there are always tourists here, but the food is great, and the view from the balcony is amazing.  I look forward to coming back here again  :)"
Jodh B.,"San Francisco, CA",94,1,,5.0,11/11/2016,"Always good food. Was only going to give 3 stars but Ashwini, Bianca, Orlando and Dana were extremely kind and helpful. I wasnt having the greatest day. But felt appreciated by the time I left. Thank you again to all the staff.#busybutonpoint"
Lauren C.,"Hughson, CA",0,6,1,3.0,5/13/2017,"Great food, but 3 stars because the service is OK. If you are looking for fast service & attentive waitresses this is not the place to go when they are busy. But on a good note, the food and cheesecake are to die for!"
Gia A.,"Redding, CA",164,17,14,2.0,11/28/2014,"I don't know what it was that failed their dish on the day I came but I had such high expectation for this place. My steak arrived cold and well done instead of medium rare, even the appetizers, and 3 other dish we ordered was bland. Even my sister who is a great fan of cheesecake factory was disappointed. It was too overpriced for a very unsatisfying meal. We barely even touched it. In the other hand, the cheesecake? AMAZING! definitely sticking to their cheesecake and for the outside view. That's the only thing they're good for."
Mauro D.,"San Carlos, CA",44,7,,5.0,11/6/2016,Ashwini is a wonderful host at the bar!! Before we can finish reading menu she makes fantastic suggestions and we always love it!! Such a positive welcoming personality - can't wait to come back to San Francisco and grab a drink at this wonderful place right in the heart of this beautiful city of San Francisco.

My steak arrived cold and well done instead of medium rare, even the appetizers, and 3 other dish we ordered was bland. Even my sister who is a great fan of cheesecake factory was disappointed. It was too overpriced for a very unsatisfying meal. We barely even touched it. In the other hand, the cheesecake? AMAZING! definitely sticking to their cheesecake and for the outside view. That's the only thing they're good for."
