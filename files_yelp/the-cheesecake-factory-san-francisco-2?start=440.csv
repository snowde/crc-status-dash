Jay K.,"Los Angeles, United States",231,315,569,3.0,17/11/2014,"The three star is really on point for this place unfortunately.  First things first, be aware of the wait times, don't come in during the weekend expecting to get seated right away, it's in one of the busiest areas of SF.  Parking can be a hassle, but there's parking across the street or down a few blocks near Westfield Mall that may be even cheaper. If you're here with friends or on a date do a combined Cheesecake factory and go ice skating. Ice skating gets a bit packed, but lots of photo-ops in the square itself!  From the start if you're here at night get a seat outside and enjoy the view from down below it's amazing!  If you're a tourist, double dating, going on a date, or just enjoying Union Square come here.  I came here with my boyfriend and a girlfriend of mine with her boy. If you're in a group it's a great atmosphere to be in. Unfortunately the wait is long if you come during the weekend.  We came on a Friday night and knew from the get go it would be at least an hour wait.  It seems after about 6:30, the wait gets longer than an hour.  My boyfriend and I got there earlier than my girlfriend and her guy so we were going to put our name in at 6 but the wait was only about 30 minutes so we waited since we weren't sure if our friends would be there in 30 min, came back 30 minutes later and had a 75 minute wait. Yikes!  Regardless, we chatted downstairs in the furniture section (very smartly placed for people to sit down and relax while waiting forever).  Our waitress was nice.  Very personable which probably comes from serving people who come from all over the country to this place.   Unfortunately for my group our food wasn't that great for some reason.  It seems my girlfriend and her guy's food was fine (pastas and appetizers), but my boyfriend's food was cold. I don't mean a little warm, lukewarm--it was cold. Eating a cold Steak Diane is not very appealing.  His mushrooms in his dish were cold as well, as if the dish had been waiting there forever. Even our coffee was cold as well, I was able to drink it through the tiny straw in huge gulps because it was literally lukewarm--chilly.  It seemed that as nice as our waitress was to us she was nice to all her customers, which kind of leads me to assume she probably left our food waiting on the counter for a little too long considering how long it took our food to eat.  The whole experience was about 2 and a half hours so it took quite a while. The macaroni cheese balls were okay, a little too much cream for me.  Crab cakes were yummy, coffee would have been better if it was actually hot and not awkwardly lukewarm.   The lemon meringue cheesecake was good though. I'd be pretty upset if I didn't enjoy the cheesecake considering I'm at the cheesecake factory.  Overall the experience was enjoyable for the company, but our food was meh. It seems the busier they get the less organized they are with food preparation. I read other reviews about food being a hit or miss, so just be careful."
Zari A.,"Antioch, United States",0,11,2,1.0,8/4/2017,"I go to Cheesecake Factory all the time but every time I come to this location there has been something wrong yet I still continued to go because I love this place in general. However after last night I don't think I'll be visiting this location anymore. We experienced: -Horrible service, first off the host wouldn't seat one of our groups when the rest was on their way up  then he walked her halfway and then back saying he can't walk her there yet. Right after another host walked her to her table with no problem. Secondly, our waiter barely came by and one of our eater cups were leaked so there was water ALL OVER THE TABLE and when we mentioned it she Brought TWO table clothes and handed it to me to clean then lied to her manager and said I wanted to clean it myself??? Even when they brought out the food she came looked at our food and walked away without even asking if we needed anything else. Nobody did until we asked a random waiter walking by. -A rude and inconsiderate manager. She gave us attitude when we were being nice at first which wasn't professional at all. We had family from Europe and I was going on about how much he would enjoy his food here and after he ate a few bites I noticed he was only eating the chicken and not his pasta so I tasted his and it had no salt at all whatsoever (mind that my own food didn't have any salt either but i just ate it because I was hungry and I can always order it again another time). We told the waiter and so the manager came and said since he already ate half of it they can only make him half a plate  and charge full or not being anything and charge for a lunch portion when in reality he only ate the chicken and a few of his pasta. She was being rude and basically had us pay a lunch portion when he ate less than that because he lost his appetite at that point. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Don't recommend this location! Just go to another location if you want to enjoy this place. Oh and One star for the view since I can't give them 0 stars."
M R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,36,,3.0,19/4/2016,"Quite possibly the best Cheesecake Factory location, because of the lucky architecture and Union Square spot/view. The best visuals, aside from The Rainforest Cafe. Not bad music at all. I have received great waitressing. I like the food. Extensive menu. Everything but like sushi. Bad side is always busy. Seems a bit pricey. PS They like to make you wait. Garlic noodles were supposed to be like 12. By the time tax and other hidden extra charges hit (I was NOT told shrimp costs extra) it was like 20. You got your stupid tip. You happy now? Chocolate shake was light colored so you could tell there was hardly any chocolate in, more like syrup. Ordering to go never took so long. I figured if you don't order in, You DON'T GET SERVICE! By the time I got it I'm like, are you sure this is how it was supposed to taste? Cause it was melting. But it was good. Tasted like it was malted or something. But it was also a seven dollars or up. That's nearly ten dollars for a beverage that was ordered *to go.* Maybe the fact that there's no wi fi is good and for a reason."
Brittany D.,"Berkeley, United States",420,410,1063,3.0,18/12/2013,"I think the first time I came here was better than when I came last night. We waited about an hour for a table, which is normal for the holiday season in union square. There were so many people there, so it was super cramped just checking it. There was also a lot of servers walking around & it was hard enough for them to get from one place to another.  When we got to the table, it was pretty tight for a group of 6. It was a booth that was snug for 3 people sitting on either side of the bench. The server got to us pretty quickly but the food didn't. I'm pretty sure we had to wait around 45 minutes for 3 entrees & an appetizer. That was not cool especially when most of us were fighting hunger pangs. We decided to exchange secret Santa gifts while waiting for the food which was a nice way to make time pass. But because the space was so tight. There wasn't much room to move your arms to open the presents.  The food itself was really good but I was expecting larger portions for couscous & chicken, especially since it cost $16.95!! The entrees are way overpriced for what you get.  When we paid, we noticed there was an automatic 18% gratuity! It was crazy that our gratuity was $10 when the service was not all that great! I guess it applies to groups of 5 or more bc one of our friends ordered something separately from the rest of us! It was $3 per person for tax & tip but that adds up when you have 5 people. I think eating downtown is overrated & only worth it maybe for lunch or for off season (not during Christmas break!). Not sure if I'll come back during this time again."
Stephanie D.,"Atherton, United States",576,774,301,1.0,29/9/2014,"This was just a sad, sad experience. I don't think that I've ever given a restaurant 1 star before because I try to be as generous and forgiving to wait staff as possible but this was just borderline ridiculous. I was with a friend from out of the country who had looked forward to coming here and bringing her kids because of her fond memories of previous trips to the Cheesecake Factory.  Because I go to school in SF, they did tourist things and then we all met up for dinner.   The wait was actually the easiest part, less than 10 minutes.  We were seated outside which I thought was strange because there was a wait list for outside tables and I had requested to be inside.  Whatever. We took it.   Our server seemed nice enough.  He was busy with a few tables and that's normal.  Her kid's drinks came timely and ours took another 10 minutes.  Odd since they were just fountain drinks and nothing fancy or from the bar.  We ordered food and everything seemed ok.   The kid's pizza's came quickly and they were totally happy with piping hot, fresh pizza. I was jealous.   Our server came and said that our meals would be a few more minutes.  More like 20? meh. I was pretty hungry and I had snacked through a fair amount of that table bread.  Both of our orders were wrong. Her meat wasn't write and mine was also wrong, more than that they were both cold =[. We sent them back and the manager came and apologized.  He said that it would be 4-ish minutes.  This turned into 20?  We decided to just cut our loses and take everything home.  I took my meal home and didn't eat it. Over it. Not going back.  There are so many fantastic restaurants in SF that there is really no reason to eat at a chain."
Leslie L.,"Pinole, United States",0,1,1,1.0,6/6/2016,"Let me start off by saying this was my worst experience at any restaurant ever. My boyfriend and I went on a saturday night, of course probably the busiest nights of all so we expected the wait time to be seated was longer than usual. That didnt bother us, the hostes gave us our buzzer and we waited for about an hour and finally were buzzed for our table. They told us to stand on the side with the rest of the people that were also buzzed. We waited and waited and waited for about another 20 mins, everyone who was standing with us were seated, including people who got there after us. I went up to the hostess and I told her we were buzzed and she said we werent buzzed yet and if it did buzz it was a test. A test? I became upset and brought it to her attention that people who were there after us got seated first. She said she couldnt do anything about that and told us to wait again. Well we waited another 10 mins and finally were seated.  That wasnt the worst part.  Our waitress came and we ordered our drinks and food (since we waited about 2 hours to be seated). Well we waited about ANOTHER hour for our food, and again we saw other guests who were seated AFTER us getting their food. I requested to speak to the manager and I informed him we had been waiting about an hour for our food and pointed out everyone was getting served before us, he asked what we ordered and then replied with ""protein usually takes longer than pastas"" he went to go check on it and 5 mins later our waitress come out with our food apologizing for it taking so long. The manager came to us 2 mins after and also apologized and said he didnt know why it was sitting there for so long. He was nice enough to pay for our dinner. But never again will we return after an experience like this. Arrived at about 8:30pm and left around 11:30pm."
Michelle J.,"El Sobrante, United States",18,14,13,1.0,13/3/2016,Wait = too long. The estimate was 45-50 mins. We waited 1 hour in 10 mins.   Egg plant parm = dry/hard/cold Calamari app = ok Crab/cheese app = no taste Cheese cake = my son said   Will I return = heck Nope  Over rated = Heck yea  I'm done
Florendo R.,"Brentwood, United States",8,12,,2.0,1/5/2017,Terrible customer service. Waited almost an hour on the phone trying to place an order. Finally gave up

J L.,"Arcadia, United States",338,4,1,1.0,16/12/2016,"The slowest cheesecake factory I've ever been to. We waited for over 3 hours when we were told it would be 1.5 hours. About two hours into the wait, we asked about our buzzer and they said it would take 5-10 minutes. We ending up waiting for over an hour. Please go save yourself some time and eat somewhere else!"
Vanessa Z.,"San Francisco, United States",15,28,257,5.0,6/3/2016,Just love the food and service there! We ordered shepard's pie & garlic lemon shrimps on angel hair pasta. The setting is good.

Mel P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,80,9,3.0,26/12/2015,"Came here during the xmas season at 6.30pm and was told the wait would be 3.5 hours long.  Thats right, if I got to be seated when they said i would it would be 10pm by the time i get to eat. So we passed and ate somewhere else instead. Oh, and they don't take reservations, so unless you're willing to hang out in Macy's for a really long time then I'd recommend going somewhere else."
Akshay S.,"El Segundo, United States",0,1,,1.0,2/5/2017,Cheesecake was great but terrible service! Waited 15 minutes for service and another 15 minutes for water. Our waiter then brought a drink that was ordered after we were done eating. Really would expect more from such a reputable and popular place!
Diane T.,"San Jose, United States",0,44,2,4.0,13/3/2016,"I took my friend here last month and our first experience was good. The only thing that keeps me from saying it was great is that the wait was extremely long, it was crowded and loud, and drinks were super expensive! The bread they served wasn't fresh. I was also pretty disappointed, because we didn't get seats outside to see the nice view on top floor... But other than that, the service was very friendly and professional! I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp and everything tasted delicious for the most part. Definitely recommend going to this place if you're around SF."
Tim P.,"Turlock, United States",90,1,1,3.0,21/10/2016,Cheesecake slices used to be bigger in the past but now as years gone by they have gotten smaller
Tiffany D.,"San Francisco, United States",2768,1929,6297,3.0,6/5/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is a self-advertisement with their sign held up on top of central Union Square!  This place offers promising fine dining that conveniently holds big parties and a nice view of Union Square, San Francisco. Other than that, their food entrees and appetizers are mediocre!  They have a wide selection of food to choose from and above average, big portioned cheesecake to bite at!  Their dishes are not commendable.  I got their overpriced ($23) Breaded Ahi Seared Tuna with Brown Rice and it was not only too oily, it was also a bit on the bland side.  Burgers, sandwiches and pasta that were ordered up by my friends were simply good - again, nothing commendable. Their presentations for all the plates besides their infamous cheesecakes are typical.  Nothing to rave about. Service is good - they come over to see if you need anything else and refill the cups of water. Not a place for unique, delicious meals.  This place is ideally made for big party reservations, fine dining, for the view of Downtown, SF and if you want to consume 1000 plus calories on special, flavored cheesecakes."
Johnny N.,"San Francisco, United States",66,64,55,5.0,20/9/2016,"Quality of food is superb. Can be pricey though so if you're just in it to try a variety, I recommend sharing entrées if you go as a group."
Leana L.,"San Francisco, United States",322,889,281,4.0,16/10/2013,"I come here every now and then at the request of a friend or my sister. There's almost always a wait (especially if you want to sit outside -- but the view from outside is worth it!).  FYI: They don't take reservations Our server was excellent -- friendly, professional, and attentive. I ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp from their skinnylicious menu. Delicious. Also, their pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecakes are back in season! Go for the view, stay for the cheesecake!"

Diane T.,"San Jose, CA",0,44,2,4.0,3/13/2016,"I took my friend here last month and our first experience was good. The only thing that keeps me from saying it was great is that the wait was extremely long, it was crowded and loud, and drinks were super expensive! The bread they served wasn't fresh. I was also pretty disappointed, because we didn't get seats outside to see the nice view on top floor... But other than that, the service was very friendly and professional! I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp and everything tasted delicious for the most part. Definitely recommend going to this place if you're around SF."
Tim P.,"Turlock, CA",90,1,1,3.0,10/21/2016,Cheesecake slices used to be bigger in the past but now as years gone by they have gotten smaller
Tiffany D.,"San Francisco, CA",2768,1929,6297,3.0,5/6/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is a self-advertisement with their sign held up on top of central Union Square!  This place offers promising fine dining that conveniently holds big parties and a nice view of Union Square, San Francisco. Other than that, their food entrees and appetizers are mediocre!  They have a wide selection of food to choose from and above average, big portioned cheesecake to bite at!  Their dishes are not commendable.  I got their overpriced ($23) Breaded Ahi Seared Tuna with Brown Rice and it was not only too oily, it was also a bit on the bland side.  Burgers, sandwiches and pasta that were ordered up by my friends were simply good - again, nothing commendable. Their presentations for all the plates besides their infamous cheesecakes are typical.  Nothing to rave about. Service is good - they come over to see if you need anything else and refill the cups of water. Not a place for unique, delicious meals.  This place is ideally made for big party reservations, fine dining, for the view of Downtown, SF and if you want to consume 1000 plus calories on special, flavored cheesecakes."
Johnny N.,"San Francisco, CA",66,64,55,5.0,9/20/2016,"Quality of food is superb. Can be pricey though so if you're just in it to try a variety, I recommend sharing entrées if you go as a group."
Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,4.0,10/16/2013,"I come here every now and then at the request of a friend or my sister. There's almost always a wait (especially if you want to sit outside -- but the view from outside is worth it!).  FYI: They don't take reservations Our server was excellent -- friendly, professional, and attentive. I ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp from their skinnylicious menu. Delicious. Also, their pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecakes are back in season! Go for the view, stay for the cheesecake!"
