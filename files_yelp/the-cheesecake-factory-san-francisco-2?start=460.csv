Christina N.,"Redwood City, United States",262,1060,1705,3.0,30/6/2013,"This outlet is particularly popular as it is on the top floor of Macy's and gives you a great view of Union Square in San Francisco. During dinner times, it typically takes about 45 minutes to get a table.  The portions here are huge, and enough to feed two people. I wouldnt say that the food is fantastic though, pretty average at best. The desserts are pretty creative with a large selection of cheesecake to choose from, all of which are sinfully rich. I wouldnt come here for the food as it is definitely not the best. However, I would bring my foreign friends here for the atmosphere, the view, the dessert, and because everyone seems to know Cheesecake Factory as the American restaurant to go to. (I might be over generalising a little here :P)"
Esmeralda P.,"San Francisco, United States",52,8,7,2.0,29/9/2016,"First time here and I was excited until we were seated. The hostess was not very friendly, we waited over 20min just to get our water and bread. We asked to sit at a specific table and told it was broken, yet they seated someone there not long after. I was very disappointed. Pros: Friendly waiters and nice view. However, I do not think I will be returning."
Kenny L.,"Newark, United States",2,9,1,4.0,15/9/2016,"One of my favorite places to go to whenever I'm in the city. The wait can be crazy but I also find my self coming back. Food is delicious, service is nice, and the view outside of the balcony is great too."
Candy W.,"San Francisco, United States",2,28,9,3.0,16/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is either a hit or miss depending on what day/time. Due to the location being a tourist attraction, the wait can be pretty long but I guess I'm always lucky enough to visit on days where I only have to wait 15-45 mins. I wait downstairs in the comfy sofa department in Macy's til my buzzer goes off to avoid the crowdedness. I never really had any complaints on my food but my boyfriend always order the filet mignon (medium rare) but it rarely comes out to be medium rare, which isn't that big of a deal. We usually don't have any issues with our servers but we realize that it's always people sitting around us who have a problem with theirs. Or maybe it's because we don't really like to complain. There was one incident where a family of 8 were arguing and crying, and their server ended up telling them to shut up. There was another incident where the mother and daughter felt uncomfortable with the, rather homeless-looking guy, sitting next to them and they had a hard time getting their waiter's attention.  The only real issue I have with this CF is that sometimes we'd wait for a long time to be buzzed and seated but come in to see that half the tables were empty. The first couple of times I assumed that there was possibly reserved parties but why would people reserve seperate tables all over the restaurant? And if so, shouldn't there be name tags so other customers wouldn't get the wrong idea?"
Deanna Y.,"San Francisco, United States",777,280,1029,2.0,17/8/2013,"I avoided the Cheesecake Factory for years. I heard their food was okay, so nothing drew me here, but I finally had to check it out for myself. Popped in for lunch with a group of friends.  Everything was...underwhelming to say the least. I was so annoyed after my meal, mainly because I had such a such a classic order: a soup, salad, and sandwich combo. You'd think you couldn't really mess any of those up too badly right? Wrong. The best part of my meal was the complimentary bread sticks :(  The clam chowder would have been good, except it was way too salty. My turkey club sandwich literally tasted like turkey sandwich meat, lettuce, and tomatoes, slapped onto day old sourdough bread, with too much mayo. It was so unappealing that I didn't even eat it, which is rare for me. I took it home and pan fried it to make it acceptable. My brother liked it though. Shrug.  And the salad. I love caesar salad. If there's ever an add-on salad option at a restaurant, I always, always get caesar, but the salad was just terrible! It wasn't really the flavor, but the fact that the salad was horribly overdressed. My romaine was drowning in the dressing, which was so thick and creamy that I had to scrape some of it off. It was just way too heavy and again, I didn't finish it. If you get a salad with any type of creamy dressing, GET IT ON THE SIDE.  I don't understand why this place is so popular. There are always hoards of people waiting in the lobby. My guess is their convenient location, ability to accommodate large groups and their hotel island resort type of decor...oh and their delicious cheesecakes. But their cheesecakes shouldn't be their only saving grace. The food is sub-par and the high prices certainly do not reflect quality. Save your money and try one of the million other restaurants downtown."
Susan M.,"Los Angeles, United States",2,110,2,5.0,3/9/2016,"Yes five stars!!! went with a friend knowing there would be a wait, but like everyone else in the city we wanted an outside table. Walked around while we waited and enjoyed a beautiful evening and bam, after 45 minutes I got the vibe that our table was ready. Ordered a lemon drop, yummy! Great cocktail and although the service could have been better, the drink was superb. My friend and I split the miso salmon dish and a salad and both were excellent. Not sure why this Cheesecake Factory gets bad reviews, our meal was excellent."
Ellen K.,"Chino, United States",171,150,210,3.0,2/2/2016,Service is good but the kitchen is SLOW. Came at lunch hour. I hope they improve during lunch hour here. It took forever for the food to come. Ordered Pizza and chicken wrap. Hmmmmm....
Tk H.,"Fresno, United States",3,32,,1.0,12/2/2017,Came at 1145  and was told the terrace was closed but we arrived the same time another couple did and  saw later that they where seated outside not cool there was plenty of open tables. im from.out of town and its too bad i spend money here to enjoy myself the inside seating was super hot and unconfortable thats too bad. The hosts was not happy with the request to go outside and made a rediculous exucse that there was a 30 min wait
Cat N.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,2.0,21/3/2016,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, which can be either pretty yum or pretty blah. This visit was on the blah side. We arrived at this location and received a 'buzzer' at 11:50 am on Saturday, 3/19/16. After our buzzer rang about 10 minutes later (a few minutes earlier than the projected ""15 minute"" wait) we are told to wait nearby for someone to call our name. Suppress that wow-that-was-quick feeling. Watched other couples turn in their buzzers....and get called in to be seated, before us! After the third couple, we check and they say ""oh it says you are seated"" -clearly we are not. We notice this is also happening to another couple and we both get seated - at tables next to each other. Our waitress is prompt to get our drinks after stumbling over her not so well rehearsed script, but since the menu is extensive, we ask for a few minutes to go over it. We see that the couple next to us has placed their food order along with their drinks and promptly receives their order - before our food order is even taken. We wait....another server comes by to check on us and we end up giving him our order of two salads. My daughter's salad comes fairly promptly....mine...takes....a....long...time...and twice I'm told it's because they're making fresh falafel. The other couple leaves.  Eventually it's brought by the manager and it's good. I ask the manager for a slice of cheesecake to go (that was fabulous - dulce de leche!) because I don't want to end up waiting  forever for this too, and she does comp it for the wait, which was not why I asked her but ended up working out.  An hour and 55 minutes from when we entered, we leave - when it should have taken only the 55 minutes."
July A.,"Mountain View, United States",12,4,3,1.0,7/3/2017,"My husband and I came here literally an hour after we signed the paperwork for our marriage. Excited to eat here because it was the first restaurant we ever went to together. The host finally told us after 5 minutes to go outside and our table was ready. We went and sat down and a host came out and loudly said ""hello, we don't have open seating"" and I told her we waited and were just told to go outside after our buzzer went off. She said loudly ""no you were not told that, I can assure you, and next time you cannot just seat yourself."" In front of EVERYONE and loudly. I have been a manager of a restaurant for years and yeah u don't EVER speak to customers like that. She was VERY rude to my husband and I and told us we were lying in front of . I asked if she was the manager and she said ""do I look like a manager?"" Anyways we were so upset and surprised and had never been treated like that ever at a  restaurant. We talked to the manager but we were upset and just wanted to leave. It was só embarrassing and just wanted to have a good time. Manager was nice. But we wanted to leave. Second review I've done my whole life. Very disappointing. We waited and did everything we were told and she was só rude to us"
Xochitl T.,"Oakland, United States",190,82,246,3.0,1/10/2015,"-We came on a Sunday night like around 9 o'clock and it was pretty empty which was a surprise. -The cheesecake factory is pretty good. Ive went to a few different ones but they all taste about the same. I ordered the tomato basil pasta, and it really is light and fresh. The cheese cake factory always give huge portions which is a plus.  -The pasta was good but not great, i like some of the other ones more actually. It had a little too much pasta water in it but that really wasnt a big deal to me. It tastes a lot better though when they come and shred lots of yummy cheese on it! -My friend ordered the louisiana chicken pasta. I liked that one more than mine. Its realllllyy creamy and nice a nice kick to it too. Lots of flavor and the chicken is really good too. The waiter told us that one is really popular so now i see why.   -As for dessert their shit is ALLLWWAAAAYYYYSSSS the bomb. Ive tried quite a few and i do have to say my favorites are the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake!!! As soon as you take a bite , the angels begin to sing. The Reeses pb one is another favorite of mine too. Overall its not bad but its not amazing. Some days we just come for dessert!"
Jennifer S.,"Roseville, United States",641,207,2,2.0,3/1/2016,"Arrived here about 11pm on New Years Day, we were hoping to have a couple drinks in the bar.  The restaurant was pretty crowded inside, we were lucky to find someone leaving in the bar and grabbed their table.  It took several minutes to get the table cleared, after several servers passed us without stopping.  Finally our server arrived, when we asked him for drink recommendations, he said ""I drink beer."" Umm..ok, you're a great help, not!  We ordered a couple drinks and some nachos.  Our service wasn't very good, our server looked uninterested with his job and like he didn't want to be there.  Drinks and food were pretty good, we got a piece of cheesecake on the way out and my boyfriend was in heaven, eating it back in our hotel room."
Zia S.,"Fremont, United States",2,12,4,1.0,16/3/2016,Poor customer service to begin with. They got my name wrong and then telling me this reservation made by two girls. We ignored that and let that go. Then they placed us in a dirty table where it wasn't even properly cleaned. Then they served us a plate where it literally had hair in. Is this really the Cheesecake Factory?!! I've never experienced poor customer service and lack of respect. Then they serve us the chipotle pasta it wasn't even freshly made. I don't know exactly what's going on.
Allen O.,"Saint Louis, United States",415,11,5,1.0,14/9/2015,"We had a big group meetup for dinner on a Wednesday night this summer, and looking back I wish we would have picked somewhere else. Great view of the Square, centrally located, and (that weekend only, sorry) free Lyft ride to and from made it an appealing place. Someone got there at 5:30p to wait for a scheduled dinner at 7:30p, and we still weren't seated in time with a group of 12.  Food was typical Cheesecake Factory, but after two and a half hours of waiting, I was starving. We all ordered, ate through two rounds of bread, and finally all of the dishes started coming out. All 11 of the others got their food and politely waited for me to get mine. They waited. And waited. And waited some more. Ten minutes in, I told everyone to just start eating, and flagged down a waiter to ask what was going on. Told me mine was up next, and ran off to the kitchen. Turns out they delivered my entree to another table and hadn't made another one. So he came back and told me as politely as possible that they were starting on a new one for me and would bring it out soon.  Ten minutes later, everyone else has finished when mine showed up. I ate a quarter and asked for it to go. The delayed food became the center of attention for the night, and I still left hungry so everyone wouldn't have to sit there watching me eat. The manager realized how bad the situation was and waived my entree, but regardless, my next group dinner won't be at the Cheesecake Factory."
Billy F.,"Indio, United States",1,2,5,5.0,31/3/2016,"Great service, great food. The wait 10 minutes. No problem. Love the food the waitress Erika, love her. First time here, it's on the 8th floor but I think it's very cool. Please come it's amazing."
Sam T.,"San Francisco, United States",6,97,13,2.0,18/2/2017,"I noticed how the employees packaging the cheesecake slices wore the same gloves to do everything, including refilling coffee for customers after the customers touched the cups and the arms of the cups, which is gross. I noticed them use a cake cutter or something of the sort to get the cheesecake slices, but their hands with the dirty gloves would still touch the cheesecake. I saw a slice of cheesecake fall on the ground, and after picking it up from the ground and the gloves touching the ground, she still didn't change her gloves and proceeded to fill up coffee and package cheesecake slices. It was a long wait for the slices that I ordered, so while I was waiting I saw this, and I felt grossed up. Unfortunately I know that this is common with most restaurants and eateries, but it shouldn't! I just didn't know what The Cheesecake Factory was one of those places! I hope that they see this and fix the problem! Gloves should be changed every time you handle a different task in order to avoid cross contamination; I've gotten sick from eating contaminated food and this is avoidable."
Aaron P.,"San Francisco, United States",36,10,,3.0,21/8/2016,"It's the cheesecake factory. It's the same as any other in the world, but it's always extremely crowded. If you're looking for a familiar restaurant and don't mind a wait, there is nothing wrong with this. If you're willing to try something new, there are better options."
Alyssa B.,"Elk Grove, United States",194,75,12,3.0,19/9/2015,"Food is great as always, ate on the balcony so the view was just amazing!  A few things that bother me is that it would be nice if they had more seating in the waiting area because obviously this place gets really busy and standing for a long period of time can be annoying.  They need more employees at the front because it was SO busy and there was only 1 person in front trying to help 10 people at once. And I know how much pressure it is. I felt bad for her. Especially since once the buzzer goes off, we still have to wait an additional 5-10 minutes because there's not enough people to help. There was maybe 5 other groups waiting to be seated after their buzzer going off.  We got seated, waitress was really friendly. I asked for water with lemon, she forgot, but no biggie. She was great overall and checked up on us when needed.  I would MAYBE come here again, depending on the day and how many people I'm with. Wait is obviously much longer with a bigger group."
Jerad T.,"San Francisco, United States",96,6,6,1.0,20/8/2016,DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!! Waited 2.5 hours to get a seat...when they did tell us they had our seat but it took them another 30min to set the table! Worst experience ever! They didn't even want to give my pregnant wife a seat to sit in while we waited...SMH
Nizar S.,"San Francisco, United States",50,11,7,3.0,23/8/2015,"There are truly two very distinct experiences at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory; Before you take your seat, and after - and don't be surprised if your pre-seating experience is the one that is significantly longer. Once you're seated, you're often greeted by some of the best waiting staff I have interacted with in the city. The food is surprisingly good with many options at decent prices considering the location - although the cheesecakes are about 30% more expensive than other locations at about $10 per slice (which you forget about one bite in - I recommend the Tuxedo). However, I reeeeeeally don't think it's worth the trip if you ask me. As you come in, a typical wait is 45-90 minutes. The hosting staff is nowhere near as pleasant as the waiters, and the approximate waiting times you get are often off. There are no reservations, and very clear inefficiencies. For example, if you decide to take a cheesecake to-go and not wait to be seated, the person taking your order at the very under-utilized takeout counter would not be responsible for putting it in a box for you to get going, although they are literally standing in front of the cake fridge, and yes, you end up with a 20 minute wait as your cake enters the restaurant queue while the two cashiers sit there and gossip. I hope they take care of these inefficiencies, because otherwise this is a pretty neat spot. In the mean time - do you REALLY want to wait at Macy's furniture department pretending to be testing beds and couches until that buzzer rings?"

Sam T.,"San Francisco, CA",6,97,13,2.0,2/18/2017,"I noticed how the employees packaging the cheesecake slices wore the same gloves to do everything, including refilling coffee for customers after the customers touched the cups and the arms of the cups, which is gross. I noticed them use a cake cutter or something of the sort to get the cheesecake slices, but their hands with the dirty gloves would still touch the cheesecake. I saw a slice of cheesecake fall on the ground, and after picking it up from the ground and the gloves touching the ground, she still didn't change her gloves and proceeded to fill up coffee and package cheesecake slices. It was a long wait for the slices that I ordered, so while I was waiting I saw this, and I felt grossed up. Unfortunately I know that this is common with most restaurants and eateries, but it shouldn't! I just didn't know what The Cheesecake Factory was one of those places! I hope that they see this and fix the problem! Gloves should be changed every time you handle a different task in order to avoid cross contamination; I've gotten sick from eating contaminated food and this is avoidable."
Aaron P.,"San Francisco, CA",36,10,,3.0,8/21/2016,"It's the cheesecake factory. It's the same as any other in the world, but it's always extremely crowded. If you're looking for a familiar restaurant and don't mind a wait, there is nothing wrong with this. If you're willing to try something new, there are better options."
Alyssa B.,"Elk Grove, CA",194,75,12,3.0,9/19/2015,"Food is great as always, ate on the balcony so the view was just amazing!  A few things that bother me is that it would be nice if they had more seating in the waiting area because obviously this place gets really busy and standing for a long period of time can be annoying.  They need more employees at the front because it was SO busy and there was only 1 person in front trying to help 10 people at once. And I know how much pressure it is. I felt bad for her. Especially since once the buzzer goes off, we still have to wait an additional 5-10 minutes because there's not enough people to help. There was maybe 5 other groups waiting to be seated after their buzzer going off.  We got seated, waitress was really friendly. I asked for water with lemon, she forgot, but no biggie. She was great overall and checked up on us when needed.  I would MAYBE come here again, depending on the day and how many people I'm with. Wait is obviously much longer with a bigger group."
Jerad T.,"San Francisco, CA",96,6,6,1.0,8/20/2016,DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!! Waited 2.5 hours to get a seat...when they did tell us they had our seat but it took them another 30min to set the table! Worst experience ever! They didn't even want to give my pregnant wife a seat to sit in while we waited...SMH
Nizar S.,"San Francisco, CA",50,11,7,3.0,8/23/2015,"There are truly two very distinct experiences at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory; Before you take your seat, and after - and don't be surprised if your pre-seating experience is the one that is significantly longer. Once you're seated, you're often greeted by some of the best waiting staff I have interacted with in the city. The food is surprisingly good with many options at decent prices considering the location - although the cheesecakes are about 30% more expensive than other locations at about $10 per slice (which you forget about one bite in - I recommend the Tuxedo). However, I reeeeeeally don't think it's worth the trip if you ask me. As you come in, a typical wait is 45-90 minutes. The hosting staff is nowhere near as pleasant as the waiters, and the approximate waiting times you get are often off. There are no reservations, and very clear inefficiencies. For example, if you decide to take a cheesecake to-go and not wait to be seated, the person taking your order at the very under-utilized takeout counter would not be responsible for putting it in a box for you to get going, although they are literally standing in front of the cake fridge, and yes, you end up with a 20 minute wait as your cake enters the restaurant queue while the two cashiers sit there and gossip. I hope they take care of these inefficiencies, because otherwise this is a pretty neat spot. In the mean time - do you REALLY want to wait at Macy's furniture department pretending to be testing beds and couches until that buzzer rings?"
