Jamie B.,"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco, United States",217,5,1,1.0,28/8/2016,"By far the worst service ever. Ordered our food at exactly 5pm. They served 3 of our entrees at the same time except for mine. I waited but took 55 mins for my food. Supposedly the kitchen messed up my order or whatever.  By the time I got my food, my companions were already finished eating and I lost my appetite. The least they could've done was given me a free meal but nothing. What's even worst is that the manager never even came to apologize or anything. SMH"
Eric P.,"Oakland, United States",3,113,30,4.0,7/10/2015,Yummy.  The only danger is overeating. I get indigestion when info here because I eat too much of my own food me then ate dessert too.  Nice clean bathrooms with beautiful fixtures and architecture.  I love the Oreo cheesecake.
Alex D.,"Bakersfield, United States",1,15,3,4.0,7/3/2016,We ordered spicy chicken nachos and and Louisiana chicken pasta.. Nachos were extremely good pasta was OK service was great food was OK at the end so I ordered an additional slice of cheesecake Terra masseuse and oh my God best thing ever... Also for the food arrived fairly quick so I was not waiting for too long
F S.,"San Francisco, United States",0,49,2,3.0,13/8/2016,"Table of 6 arrived at 7pm and waited an hour and 20 minutes to be seated. Food was ok but service was slow, disorganised and inattentive. We had to ask for cutlery, bread plates and napkins - 3 times. I know the place was super busy and the server was apologetic and sweet but it was not good enough."
Annette S.,"San Francisco, United States",33,155,61,4.0,12/10/2015,"I know this place is subpar for most but I love it here cause I always know what I'm gonna get. I always get salads and I'm never disappointed, which I love most about this place. And who doesn't like warm bread and butter to start, despite the fact it's too filling. I've never had bad service here either which is always a plus.  Oh and I've also never had bad cheesecake either, but is there such a thing?"
Santos V.,"Berkeley, United States",97,26,6,4.0,22/2/2016,"This place is great. The view is epic (get seated outside)! I really enjoy their food and their somewhat attentive staff.  I've come here around 5 times and there's only two things that really can get in the way.  1) They don't take reservations but they're still busy most of the time! This doesn't make sense when they don't even have a general waiting area. Prepare to sit on the floor or leave for a while. 2) That is where another issue arose. They have one elevator (with a ridiculously low capacity) to lift/lower 8+ floors. Not to mention they don't have accessible stairs! This slow elevator is literally the only way to leave the place. 100+ people, one elevator, 8+ floors, with 10 people leaving at a time...  If the place doesn't catch on fire or you manage to survive one anyways, you'll probably have a great time looking over the square. The food is good and the dessert even better! Try it if you're not in a hurry."
Teresa L.,"Modesto, United States",4,25,6,5.0,19/2/2017,"I recommend eating in the balcony, you will get an amazing view of Union Square. Try the macadamia nut cheesecake it's amazing!"
Kristine L.,"East Oakland, Oakland, United States",32,10,67,1.0,10/6/2016,"Terrible excuses from the manager!!  We love the food and cake from this place. CF is always my top choices when we plan to celebrate something. However, we had a terrible experienced with the manager( not server or other people). I tried to call them just to preorder and pre-wrap the cake for me so I don't need to wait for too long on my way there. However, after the front desk transfer my call to the bakery and nobody pick up the calls twice ! I give up! ... So I ordered two cake from them when I was there, one large size and one small size. The small size came out very small. Is different than the one on display. So I ask the manager can we change it to a bigger size, I am willing to pay extra. And he told us the one on display is plastic. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I have been here so many times, and I can tell what is plastic and what is real! I know cake too. I can accept the reasons of no exchange or no return. But I can not except stupid BS like this. The reason that he told us is unacceptable! Terrible service! We was planning to have an other party next week with Cheesecake Factory. After this I don't think I will ever want to go back with my friends."
Chris L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,48,15,4.0,20/1/2016,"I actually had a very good service experience here and the food was solid.  It wasn't amazing but the service made up for it.  We had a burger and pasta which wasn't anything fancy but everything came fresh and executed perfectly.  I actually would go back because of the service, great location and view from the roof.  My expectations were not high and was satisfied with what I paid for.  I would absolutely recommend others for a solid dining experience."
Layla J.,"Diamond Bar, United States",0,5,,1.0,18/2/2017,The food and everything was good however the terrible service and the unorganized wait lines really ruin the experience. The staff in the front is extremely rude and careless. By the time you get your food you're not even hungry. :(
Joe C.,"San Mateo, United States",0,15,,2.0,18/3/2017,"Loved the location and the ambiance.   Also the food was Excellent, however, i couldn't bring myself to give more than 2 stars after the horrible customer service i received. Our server was ok.  He was friendly and courteous but it took very long to get our orders once we were seated.  Also, he was inatentive as he only came by once to see how we were doing and never refilled our cups of water until the end of our meal. Finally he  seemed unfamiliar with the menu since he had to go ask about certain items we ordered a few times. But the true let down was from the poor customer service i received over the phone trying to contact the manager.  I had left my debit card on the table, so in an attempt to retrieve it right away, i called the restaurant to inquire if anyone had turned it in.  The young lafy informed me she had to transfer me to the manager and put me on hold.  I was literally on hold for 25 minutes before my wife decided to call.  She was put on hold as well for another 10 minutes!  Finally a manager picked up,  we gave him our infomation and, 2 minutes, later he told us that nothing had been turned in.  Seriously?   He never even asked us our servers name!  He then went on to suggest we call back in the morning to check again.   I called again this morning and was placed on hold again.  After another 10 minutes of being on hold, it was just easier to hang up and cancel my card.  Thanks for the help guys!"
Haley W.,"Manteca, United States",0,10,,5.0,17/3/2017,Every single time I go to SF I stop by this restaurant it is just awesome. Love the outdoor seating and the views. Cant wait until my next visit.
Andie H.,"San Francisco, United States",102,17,18,2.0,8/8/2016,"I had a fair experience with Cheesecake Factory. Fair in a way that I got what I paid for, yet, I wished that the accommodation was just as consistent. My aunt and I wanted to come here on a whim. Without a reservations, we waited to get line ---only there wasn't any. There wasn't a system they had to call people or to know where to approach when you're without reservation. The lady in charge didn't even take down my aunt's name right, so when we were called, we didn't know it was us. And we waited so long. Luckily the waiter who served us did well. The food had great portions, and the ambience was good. Hopefully, the staff will also be up to par."
Mai L.,"Tustin, United States",209,33,167,1.0,22/5/2016,"Went here for dessert and we ordered the Hot Fudge Sundae WITHOUT nuts and we specifically told her that my nephew is allergic to nuts, and Tashay ( our server) brought out a Hot Fudge Sundae WITH nuts.  We were being nice and said ""its ok that you made a mistake and brought out one WITH nuts, we will just scoop it out"" but as we were scooping out the nuts, we realized that there were nuts at the bottom of the sundae so we asked her if she can make another one WITHOUT the nuts, and she rolled her eyes and took back the half eaten Sunday and it took another 15 minutes to bring out one WITHOUT nuts.. It's less work to make one WITHOUT nuts so why did it have to take so long.. We ended up not even eating the rest of it and left because the kids were so tired.  Never again trust a server when you tell them not to put nuts in."
Taras M.,"San Francisco, United States",69,3,1,1.0,5/8/2016,"We were very late customers, BUT elevator still was operational and host told us that we have two minutes to order food at the bar. We rushed to the bar and told bartender kindly thay we know it is very late and we want to place an order for ONE appetizer very quickly. Bartender (her name is Bianca, I believe) said that she won't take our order. I said that we still have one minute. She pulled up her phone and said that her phone ""shows different time"" and it is closed already. When we were leaving, I informed manager that we were refused in service, but she simply ignored me and kept walking by."
Richard V.,"San Francisco, United States",2,100,,5.0,5/8/2016,"This review is very specifically for a take out order last week. Over the last several years I've dined here a handful of times. The wait has been substantial each time, but you're in Macy's, so you can wander (a little). This past week, however, I somewhat reluctantly went in for a to go order I was to place and deliver for work. With the huge crowd there, I was able to place my order almost immediately. The employee (Terrell) assured me it would be ready in 5 minutes. Amazingly, it was! Mind you, a simple order of desserts and a milkshake, but it was a definite 5 star experience in my book! That guy was handling the register and the crowd like a seasoned pro. I'd definitely do it again."
Stephanie M.,"Prescott Valley, United States",0,4,1,1.0,28/8/2016,This has to be the most poorly run Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Our server failed completely. He asked us if we wanted bread three times. He never brought us water. I have never had service this bad in my entire life.
Anna L.,"San Jose, United States",540,73,41,2.0,5/7/2014,"Minus one star for service... We came here yesterday with a party of 4 for Fourth of July late night dinner/snacks and was dining outside on the roof area. My friend invited three more people to the party (they haven't yet arrived). So, we waved to a waitress and asked if it's possible to maybe arrange seating for us to sit down at another area for a larger party. The waitress then rudely goes ""Oh, you can just go ask the host.""  Not that we don't have legs, arms, or that we cannot physically go ask the host ourselves. However, as an etiquette, at least OFFER nicely and say things like ""I'm actually not sure if I can personally arrange that for you, but, let me go ask the host for you."" Nope. She didn't, she just left us hangin'. We also asked if we could order and she told us that we need to wait for our own waitress...UM. OKAY. We don't want to talk to you anyway....-__-"" I'm a host at a restaurant; hence, why I feel like it's necessary to complain about this type of situation because come on, that's extremely rude for an environment like Cheesecake Factory! (Not that I've experienced better service before here...and the wait here is just ridiculous in general...) Anyway, we ended up dining with just four people and was able to calm down because our waitress was pretty funny and somewhat lightened up the mood for us. Appetizers we got included the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Factory Nachos, Crispy Crab Wontons, and Buffalo Blasts. So much for healthy, everything was fried food, haha! We also got for dessert Tiramisu Cheesecake, and Strawberry Cheesecake. Both were average I would say. I favored the Factory Nachos a lot more over the others. It was not as greasy and oily as the Buffalo Blasts and Eggrolls, but it was worth a try.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory's food was mediocre, and I hope they'll learn to improve their customer service a little bit better because I'm out of here!"
C S.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,54,,1.0,25/7/2016,"Worst dining experience ever. I love cheesecake factory, but this place sucks period. Horrrrrrrible service. Laziest workers I have ever seen in a restaurant. I honestly thought I was witnessing a group of zombies shuffling around the restaurant. F your $15 minimum wage, SF."
David P.,"San Francisco, United States",63,9,4,4.0,28/8/2016,"We went at this Cheese Cake Factory for my past birthday and I really enjoyed my experience.

Staff was OK, ours wasn't even able to open our wine bottle but honestly, he was really chill in general. We had a good experience at this cheesecake factory."
