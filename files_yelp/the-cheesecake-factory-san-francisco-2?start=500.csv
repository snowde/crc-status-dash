Josh L.,"Livermore, United States",51,22,,5.0,10/11/2015,"I don't know how anyone can give this a bad review at all.  The wait was long, but when we got seated outside we had the nice freakin' waiter I have ever had.  Not only that, but the food is top notch.  I ordered slider burger things.  You get four mini burgers (they aren't that mini) and those literally might have been the best burger I have ever had.  As far as I can remember.   And their barbeque chicken burger is something I might kill someone over.  And the cheese cake is awesome.  But that's a given I think."
Risa W.,"Milpitas, United States",0,15,12,1.0,27/8/2016,"I always loved this place and was happy to go again. I ordered decaf coffee after meal coz I'm allergic to caffeine. The coffee was served immidiately so wondering if it's really a decaf one. The staff said yes so trusted her then I had it. After I left the restaurant, I felt dizziness and couldn't breez well...almost pass out! (I went there alone this time) I had to have a lot of water to let the caffeine go and had to take a rest for 2hours in Macy's. After that, I went back to the restaurant to complain. The male maneger was a good guy but didn't take my problem seriously. I hope they won't kill any customers because of this issue."
Liang N.,"Fremont, United States",15,5,40,2.0,31/7/2016,"Third time came here, the food is just okay , not bad! best thing here is the cheese cake, 2 star for the cakes! But the service here is the worst one I ever been! We asked for help so many times , the waiters crossed by  saw us waved hands, but they just ignored ! We just wanna some more sauce and some more water!Finally, a waiter went to get sauce for my friend , but he came back after half hour , we almost finished! I know the business here is busy , lots of people waiting outside, they are busy, but if the service keep bad , all the customer will never come back again!"
Paula M.,"London, United Kingdom",76,334,1727,5.0,28/3/2013,"Been a big fan of the cheesecake factory since discovering it in the US many years ago.  Words cannot describe the feeling of tucking into one of their many varieties of cheesecake.  My only disappointment, but testament surely to how fantastic I can only assume the restaurant is, is that on visiting the restaurant twice in one week (weekend and weekday) it was packed and looked to be that you had to wait a while for a table. :( boo.   First visit I settled for just a cheesecake take out (which was so big and rich that as much as I tried, I ate it over two days!!) the second I was more determined so left with a main meal take out as well as a cheesecake of course.   This was a good value take away meal I felt and thoroughly enjoyed the naughtiness of consuming my delightful takeaway in the privacy of my hotel room.  Hoping one day I will actually eat in a restaurant big bang theory style ;)"
David G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",12,58,24,1.0,8/6/2015,"We arrived in San Fran, after a long night the day prior, an early start and a -7 hour time change, when it got to dinner time, we where in the area and hungry. After a simple elevator ride we where at the host station in the Cheesecake Factory, it seemed like a safe bet... Then the usual casual dining messing about started, oh it's 10 mins for a table (but half the restaurant is empty....)  We where seated at a cold table and introduced to server number 1, who got us bread and water and gave us menus, next the handoff to server number 2, introduced by server 1, the bus boy brings our food, then comes server 2 handing us off to server 3. We eat, and wait, and wait, and wait passing the time by guessing how long it will take each party being sat at the draughty table next to us and the terrace door to ask to be moved, one after the other 4 maybe 5 parties are sat there and then ask to move... it helped pass the time while we stared at our empty dirty plates for 30 mins after we finished eating. We then asked server number 4 for our bill as he was resetting the table next to us. Disgraceful service, 4 servers for one course, cop on guys, as for repeatedly seating people at the other table, that's just sloppy, restaurant was half full, this table did not need to be used. As for the food, it was as to be expected, could have been anywhere in any TGI Fridays, Hard Rock, or similarly freezer to grill establishment. Hands down worst experience in all my trips to the US in any restaurant. You will not see me in a Cheesecake Factory again! Go elsewhere, anywhere it would be hard to find worse!"
Emily T.,"Los Angeles, United States",554,260,613,4.0,14/1/2013,"I had a wonderful time here with my daddy on a Wednesday afternoon. We found everything to be delightful. The host told us the wait was going to be over 30minutes, turned out to be only 15 minutes. Some may say that's simply killing time, but be real...you're there for the ambiance not the food.  I'm sure everyone knows what the Cheesecake Factory is all about. It's a tablecloth and linen sort of place, with a large catalogue-like menu and very cheap yet bountiful plates of pasta. You can get the same type of service and food anywhere, but what sets this Union Square location apart from the rest if the heated patio seating.  I usually order the jambalaya cajun pasta dish, and a plate of red velvet cheesecake to top everything off. But their breakfast sandwiches were great too, with a generous portion of salad and soup. I'm also a HUGE fan of their complimentary whole wheat bread."
Susan T.,"Berkeley, United States",1,42,4,5.0,25/2/2017,oreo cheese cake!!!!!!! avocado eggrolls and buffalo blasts are among of the few things i adore at cheesecake. i also love the med. salad and pretzel crusted chicken skewers. great place to stop and eat after a long shopping day in sf. servers are very nice and have yet to have a bad experience here.
Nisheeth S.,"Ashburn, United States",46,10,,2.0,4/7/2015,"Such poor service. First, they sat us down right under the speakers, which we asked to turn down, and they didn't. As we were sitting down, we had also asked to sit near the window, which they informed us that that section was closed for a half an hour. We took our seats and maybe 5 mins later someone was sitting there! We then ordered lattes, which came out lukewarm in what looked to to be clear water glasses. The Avocado Egg Roll was fantastic as usual though, and the food didn't disappoint. They did screw up the pasta order as well though, so that had to be replaced.  Overall, very amateurish. 2 stars only because server was nice and Avocado rolls."
Christina L.,"San Jose, United States",250,215,279,3.0,7/7/2014,3 stars for the view and the customer service we received while being there. The wait was quite awhile about 2 hours but my family and I ended up just shopping while waiting at Macys. It's nice to be all the way up and see the city while eating. Food was average. I got the roasted beat salad and I asked for extra beats. Definitely got my extra beats and portions was the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. My parents had their margherita pizza and a salad sandwich combo. Overall we would go back just for the view and to have a good time with the family.
Andrew C.,"Toronto, Canada",54,279,467,2.0,14/5/2014,"I'm a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory and the food is generally consistent with what I've had at other locations. Just a few things: 1. The coke I ordered had a weird metallic taste in it. 2. Patio doesn't have enough shade so make sure you have sunblock and sunglasses (our waiter was wearing sunglasses the entire time). 3. Tons of tourists here.  If you go during peak hours, prepare to wait for a long time."
Michael B.,"Dunedin, Tampa Bay, United States",1,10,13,5.0,2/7/2015,I've been to few cheesecake factories around the country but this is one by far has the best tasting food !!! def going back
Joslyn J.,"Sacramento, United States",6,8,2,1.0,7/11/2016,"We came here for Sunday brunch between wedding dress appointments. We figured 3.5 hours would be enough time to eat and get to the next location nearby but clearly we were mistaken. After an hour and fifteen minute wait to get seated and a rude hostess who was annoyed by us asking how much longer (our wait time was estimated 30 minutes), we were sat in a section of a dazed and confused server, Issac. He told us while zoning out taking our order that he was tired from working a double the previous day and coming in early Sunday so don't mind him, though I felt bad for him we were behind schedule and his coworker had already left a bad impression. By the time we sat down it was 2:01pm and brunch was over. We placed our orders right away but it took about 45 minutes to get our food. Once we started eating I noticed hair in my food. We spoke to the manager, we told her about the experience with the hostess, our dazed and confused server, the hair, and our lack of time at this point and she started to make excuses. She took my plate then brought back our bill. Never once did she ask me if I wanted my food to be remade nor offer me anything to go since at this point that is what we had to do. When I asked her if that is her common practice and her response was ""maybe I would have if you guys weren't in a rush."" Needless to say, I left without eating and no compensation so I definitely won't be back."
Carolyn Q.,"Chatsworth, United States",2,16,4,1.0,6/11/2016,Came to SF for weekend for wedding. Kids requesting Cheesecake. Had to fight for window seat. Not sure why???then waited about 15-20 minutes to get bread after I asked the manager to get it for us since no sign of our waitress. Had to request water refills!!  Too bad. Great view that you have to fight for and horrible service!  Unusual for Cheesecake Factory but maybe SF has different standards for customer service???
Jona A.,"Chula Vista, United States",0,3,1,1.0,21/2/2016,I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory and never have I had to wait sooooo long.. Been over 2 hours and still have not had my food.. Who knows it will take.. The server has yet to come and tell me any status on the food.. Super busy at this one if you really really want the food then I guess but there's so many places to eat.. I've been here to long that I'm not gonna leave and start a new wait..
Nancy S.,"Los Angeles, United States",675,235,558,3.0,18/5/2015,"The usual Cheesecake Factory food and atmosphere with a pretty awesome view of the city! On the rooftop of Macy's, you can catch a beautiful bird-eye view"
Erika C.,"Sacramento, United States",22,129,46,5.0,13/11/2014,Came here this past Tuesday to have dinner. Wait time was only 30min which was surprisingly great considering the large crowd already inside! There were 4 of us & decided to last minute invite my aunt to come eat with us since she worked close by. Our waiter was very accommodating to our request & added the table next to us.  Our waiter was extremely attentive & very nice! Food & drinks were great! It was definitely 5 star service that night!
London D.,"Financial District, San Francisco, United States",0,34,5,1.0,25/6/2015,"The hostess told us it was est 40 min wait for TWO. We waited an hour and 30 minutes although the host told us they were still on schedule 25 and 30 mins later. at 45 mins she said our table was almost ready. After another 10 mins we had to keep asking her what was going on because people who came in after us were being seated before us. Still waiting but Finally our buzzer rang, we were then lead by a man to our table, our table was still dirty. He asked us to go and stand by the cheesecakes while he got it ready. About 9 minutes later, we got seated, I didn't realize how long it took to clean off and reset a small table.  Our server came and said, ""you were waiting for a long time so you should know your order by now, right?"" He didn't even ask what type of rice I wanted with my Miso Salmon which is the only reason I came and I was so irritable, I forgot to say brown rice. We were given the bread while we waited, the bread was cold. I received my plate with white rice, I didn't bother to ask for a switch because I was really hungry. Their white rice was super dry like it was day old rice that had been sitting out and it was just warmed up. We had to keep waiving him down and asking for more refills, too. I have been to a few CF from NorCal to SoCal and this was terrible. After getting my food, I took a few bites and asked for a to go box & the bill."
Janwillem S.,"Brussels, Belgium",0,12,4,3.0,2/8/2015,"I had an 'eggplant parmesan': fried slices of eggplant with tomato sauce and green pasta. It was a strange dish, not what I expected, and below average quality. The prices were reasonable.  Staff was friendly and responsive.  I had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated outside, on a Sunday at noon. This was told as soon as I entered.  The Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor, and has an amazing view over Union Square."
Carlyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",8,90,76,3.0,7/9/2015,"Great view of Union Square from the patio. These people work really hard as this place is always a crowd favorite in every city.  We visited the restaurant to celebrate a birthday and there was an hour wait to be expected. The restaurant was bustling with people in and out, waiting in the crowded lobby, on the patio and the bathroom was constantly crowded. That women's restroom could use some help and extra cleaning and stocking especially on a weekend. Two of the three faucets were not working, a stall out of toilet paper then the stall next to it a mess. There was even a little dog peeing on the floor. The owner wiped up after it but rather gross in a restaurant.   The portions are still as large as ever but healthy and smaller lunch portions are offered now. My fav shrimp avocado bacon sandwich is no longer in the menu but they offered to make one. Instead of the French roll it came as a fat high club sandwich impossible to eat unless you deconstruct it.   The fries were not as tasty and skinny was they used to be but the view and company were worth it."
Jen M.,"Folsom, United States",1,21,,3.0,21/8/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and I had always been a fan of this one. It's crazy busy and the wait can be huge but the view of the city is amazing and normally the service is great. We took my mum here for her birthday and we sat in the bar as the wait was so long and we needed to head to the airport right afterwards. We were not served for over 40 mins so we went to the bar to ask if we could place our order directly here instead. The lady behind the bar was the rudest human being I have EVER had the unfortunate experience of encountering! She simply stated ""no"" and then waved us off with her hands dismissively. I explained we didn't seem to have a server and she told me to get back to my table and zip it (I'm paraphrasing). It wasn't just the lack of help it was the tone. After another 15 mins a lady showed up who apparently believed in the same service model that the chick behind the bar did. She slammed the waters down on the table and then proceeded to wander off again. It went from bad to worse when our food was cold and the wrong order was brought out but I had lost the will to even try to correct it at this stage.  I sent a complaint into the website and never heard anything back. This added the joy of my mothers birthday...all the way from the UK!  This said I went back (under peer pressure) on the weekend of the SF marathon and I reported to the manager the issues I had faced before. He was amazing, he offered to seat us right away and provide 2 free appetizers by way of apology. The lady behind the bar was still there but I actually saw her crack a smile so maybe she just had a bad day previously it's just a shame it tanked my mums birthday."

It went from bad to worse when our food was cold and the wrong order was brought out but I had lost the will to even try to correct it at this stage.  I sent a complaint into the website and never heard anything back. This added the joy of my mothers birthday...all the way from the UK!  This said I went back (under peer pressure) on the weekend of the SF marathon and I reported to the manager the issues I had faced before. He was amazing, he offered to seat us right away and provide 2 free appetizers by way of apology. The lady behind the bar was still there but I actually saw her crack a smile so maybe she just had a bad day previously it's just a shame it tanked my mums birthday."
