Sean F.,"Emeryville, United States",52,13,,4.0,28/3/2016,"Came here for the first time this evening. Sat at the bar because the place was absurdly busy. Robert M was our bartender. Despite being extreeeeemely busy and my food having to be sent back twice, Robert remained on point the entire time and was able to fix it in a timely manner. It's entertaining to watch this guy when the bar is crazy busy. He gets it done! I recommend coming in to see him if you stop by! Excellent service."
Sandy T.,"Irvine, United States",66,46,,5.0,17/12/2015,"Beautiful View of Union Square if you dine in the patio.  Amazing Service. Loved everything. Not much more to say! c(: We ordered the Fried Zucchini, avocado, and portobello mushroom/ chicken marsala, spaghetti and meatballs/ cosmo and long island. The appetizer was delicious, we especially loved the mushroom! It's a great time to go during the holiday season!"
Mel T.,"Long Beach, United States",167,88,173,4.0,30/4/2014,"CHEESE CAKE FACTORY! Haha, you're a chain you. Although this place is really typical and it is kind of ""whatever"" to some, I actually really enjoy this place. I'm pretty fond of the food here and the portions. It is a bit on the pricier side, but there are really decent portions for what you pay for. Which is hard to get for a place with a nice atmosphere as well.  I've come here for many formal events and I think it's one of the perfect places to have them. Especially with big groups, because you can make reservations and they're pretty good with that. Of course, as usual, the tip will be automatically added to your bill. My default dish is fettichini alfredo, can't go wrong with it! Just add chicken, shrimp or whatever ya like to it."
Amy C.,"Newark, United States",1518,982,1731,5.0,21/4/2013,"Oh The Cheesecake Factory, how I love you so!  The menu is extensive with many variety of dishes to choose from and of course a whole lot of different cheesecakes to fulfill how ever big your sweet tooth may be! I love the outdoor seating area overlooking Union Square especially at night time because it's kinda of romantic seeing the city at night with it's sparkling city lights.  Service has been always great all the times I've been here & other TCFs. My most recent visit I had the Mac & Cheeseburger which was sooo freakin delish! Soo cheesy & I LOVE it! Then I also had their 50th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and it was so very chocolatey; definitely get this if you're a chocaholic like me! ;) Sometimes, the wait time can be long depending on the time of day & what days you come in, but that's a given cause it's a popular place. You can find parking in the Union Square garage or if you try really hard- you can find a street spot if you're lucky."
jiopkly Y.,"Oakland, United States",118,42,4,4.0,26/12/2015,"As you had may notice 'Cheesecake Factory' is famous of their cheesecake. Which I have to highly agree, but I did have better cheesecake in the past. Beside that, the food is really good and I do love the atmosphere which they install. One of the food I would recommend you to try is ""Artichoke with crab cake"". A great dish to match with any type of salad you prefer.  Beside the food, the service was great and have well attended manner."
Matt Y.,"Lahaina, United States",198,383,2248,3.0,9/5/2014,"5/5/14  Dinner CF is like Disneyland for me---once is enough for a long while, usually it's an occasion to entertain visitors. Obligatory visit as I'm entertaining out-of-country friends from Thailand. Cheesecake Factory makes prefect sense after their full-day of looting Macy's and the Union Square shops. The name says it all---Cheesecake Factory---known for their cheesecakes and they don't disappoint.  Monday evening at 6 there's already a wait of 10-15 minutes. For party of 4+ everyone has to be present in order to be seated. The wait for the patio seating is usually longer when it's nice out. It was nice sitting by the windows so my friends would enjoy the view of Union Square. Food is bland and mediocre at best. We all decided to ""down-size"" our dinner portions to make room for the cheesecakes.  Moscow Mule is a mango-flavored twist and that's the only Moscow Mule they could make. It was alright, more fruity than fizzy. Cosmopolitan is disappointingly weak. I couldn't taste any vodka. My friends had bottled beers. I don't remember ever having a tasty cocktail here. :/ Thai Lettuce Wraps quite tasty with a sweet chili sauce and a peanut dip. Mozzarella-basil-tomato flatbread is good , thin-crusted served on a wooden skillet. Pasta Da Vinci is a penne with grilled chicken and mushrooms in a light creamy white wine sauce. It's completely lacking flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt to it. Teriyaki Chicken on Brown Rice is okay, with a sweet-tasting glaze.  All four cheesecakes are STELLAR: Snickers, Lemon Raspberry, Godiva Chocolate, and Red Velvet. All over the top and we licked all the plates clean. The Snickers one is really plain cheesecake with crunched Snickers bar on top. The Godiva cheesecake is has a stronger taste of chocolate than cheesecake. This is it if you like chocolate. The Red Velvet is a mixture of plain cheesecake and velvet cake. Overall the food is just mediocre, hit-or-miss. Skip the cocktails and have them instead at Bar Drake or Dirty Habit at the Palomar Hotel. Make sure you save your room for cheesecakes."
Sofia R.,"San Francisco, United States",572,667,2522,4.0,1/11/2012,"My brother took me out for lunch here one day....partly because he's never been to Cheesecake Factory before. I've only been to a Cheesecake Factory once before and I remember thinking that my experience was average (food wise). This time wasn't that different.  This branch is a lot busier than others simply because it's located in downtown San Francisco.The wait was about 30 minutes but we just went downstairs to look at the furniture. Be wary of wandering out of the restaurant floor because the little machine they give you while you wait might not receive the signal to alert you. There were three of us: me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We eat a lot, so we ordered a lot. We got stuffed mushrooms and fried mac n cheese balls for appetizer, we each got huge dishes for meals (I ordered the tomato basil pasta), and two of us each got cheesecake slices.  The appetizers were okay. The stuffed mushrooms were not to my liking (small and not really stuffed) and the fried mac n cheese was too salty for my taste like the last time I had it. My pasta was very bland. The ahi tuna salad thing my sister-in-law got was boring without the tuna. The mushroom swiss burger my brother got was good but not memorable. Pretty average. The cheesecakes were good. My brother got the chocolate coconut cream and I got pumpkin pecan. His was good but I felt like the coconut taste was artificial. My pumpkin pecan was good.  I would recommend...it's just a very heavy cheesecake. All cheesecakes there are heavy.  Overall, food was whatever. I don't mind too much because I didn't pay for it at the time.  I added an extra star only because the service was really great and it should be noted."
MrsFrank H.,"Elk Grove, United States",26,26,20,4.0,11/1/2016,Had the pleasure of being seated outside. The view is amazing. They had heaters. The food was good and of course the cheesecake was amazing
Marie S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, United States",20,38,5,1.0,25/5/2016,"Not coming back here again. The receptionists were not friendly and disinterested in their customers . All they did was talk amongst each other . I requested a table at the patio and it started raining , nobody offered a table for us to be seated inside . I had to be a little aggressive to the waitress and she looked at me like are you serious ? I guess we're just another customer they wouldn't lose any money from us . But hey managers watch your workers ."
Sam G.,"El Cajon, United States",4,33,5,1.0,13/7/2016,"Rude servers, even worse manager. Appetizers food and drinks all came at the same time , never seen a cheesecake factory worse than that place although it's one of favorite"
Jahnysha R.,"Suisun City, United States",0,10,4,3.0,8/1/2016,Starting off my appetizer was horrible ! Chicken samosas were extremely salty to the point my tongue was burning. Therefore I sent them back. Was originally brought out the wrong entree and told to wait and it was then taken and I began to wait yet another 15 minutes for my grilled salmon. Then brought back the same plate which was now not as hot as before of course. So far the best part is my Caesar salad. The food is great even though I have the wrong side dish.  I'm giving three stars due to the ill customer service and the food preparation. The view is amazing and food was up to par if I'm only going off taste.
Evelyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",167,15,11,3.0,25/8/2015,"Be prepared to experience long wait times for ANYTHING: waiting for a table, waiting for bread, your food, and the check.  Service can make or break your experience. I've often felt ignored by waiters in favor of older or wealthier looking patrons (college-aged here), which gets pretty irritating.  Food is up to par with other Cheesecake Factory locations. I will continue to return for the complimentary bread and tasty food , but certainly can not expect great service at this location."
Sandy T.,"San Francisco, United States",303,373,418,2.0,22/5/2015,"Reviewing the cheesecake only. And man it was waaaayyy too sweet. No wonder high school kids rave over this! I only recently came by because we had a voucher to redeem a slice of cheesecake. I never made it out here in my high school days and I must admit, I don't think I was missing out on much. Not in a hurry to come back and to be honest, nor do I really care to."
Jenn S.,"Sebastopol, United States",1,20,3,1.0,27/12/2016,"Ok let me start off by saying I know it's the holidays , and I know places are busy. Having said that when we arrived and checked in the wait was 35 mins- then in a matter of 1 minute it went to an hour. After an hour plus we checked in and kept being told 5 more mins--- at least 5 times! So now we're at an hour and half. Closer to 2 hours we are finally seated to sit and wait another 30 mins for our food that we ordered right away( we had plenty of time to look at the menu during the 2 hour wait to sit) They seat us outside where the pigeons are flying over your table  and dive bombing your head!  The food FINALLY COMES- it's HORRIBLE!  And it came out in waves- my sister was almost done with her meal before the fries came out.  I ordered a beef dip sandwich - the meat was disgusting, tastes like it had been drug through the bottom of the broiler pan before they slopped it on a hamburger bun. It was delivered to the table and I had to ask for the A jus! Isn't it a beef DIP?  When they brought me the A jus I was then convinced they did in fact drag my meat through the bottom of some broiler pan because now I was just served that juice in a bowl! Disgusting! The kids burgers were so greasy they could barely eat them!  Cheesecake Factory.... I WONT be back! Your staff was rude and your food was disgusting. I would have been better off eating from the pretzel cart outside.  In response to the reply I got from CF .... Your direct website was the FIRST place I went to leave my comments! I have yet to hear anything from them. I won't be dining at your restaurants in the future."
Dominique M.,"San Ramon, United States",2,16,6,4.0,6/1/2017,"We went to Cheesecake Factory at Union Square, San Francisco on New Year's Day for breakfast. We arrived around 11am and there was no line. Yeah! We decided to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view. It was a tad cold, but we made that choice. The quality of food was the same as any other Cheesecake factory and they even accommodated a special request. HOWEVER, the service was horrible. It took forever to have the wait staff come to our table and equally long to bring coffee, take our order, serve the food, and then bring the bill. It may have been that it was a holiday weekend, but we did not leave there until after 1:30pm. It should not have taken that long!"
James R.,"Suisun City, United States",167,496,658,4.0,14/5/2015,"I will say I've been to a couple Cheesecake Factory's, but this one is definitely the best one. I've been to this one several times, so I know what to expect. Tonight after my original plans were canceled I came here with two of my close friends for some dinner. We arrived around 7:50pm and were told the wait would be about 30-35 minutes. No big deal we had plenty of time and ordered some drinks at the bar and lounged outside by the big sign overlooking Union Square (quite a nice view). We were seated around 8:20pm. One tip I will say is that while there is always a bit of a wait the outside seating usually is quicker (there are heat lamps all around, so it's still very warm and the view is great especially with the fog rolling in). One other tip I will say to do is while waiting look over the menu! The menu has a ton of options and by knowing what you want now you can get your order in ASAP. Anyways, after we were seated it took probably 5-10 more minutes to get the waiter to our table and we ordered. I ordered the chicken and biscuits and a nacho appetizer. It took roughly another 20-30 minutes to get the rest of our food, but I am the type that likes to talk and after a few drinks we didn't even notice the time passing by. Our waiter Javier was very nice and was never pushy or impassive. The nachos were great! They had a sweet taste to them and everything came together nicely and nothing tasted soggy (like some nachos can be). The chicken and biscuits was also very good! I didn't realize they came with mushrooms (which I hate) but they were easy enough to identify and move over. The chicken was nice and juicy and the gravy went well with the meal. Since we were out we all decided to order some cheesecake. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and it was superb like usual. Overall, a nice spot.  A tad pricey, but if your in the city and looking for a consistent place with a nice view check this spot out. Just remember that there's a bit of waiting, but it's worth it at the end."
Alexa W.,"Oakland, United States",142,235,332,3.0,2/7/2015,"I must admit, I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory in my life. It just never came up. Neither have I been to an Olive Garden. I might have to remedy that soon, so I can be part of the bashing ;-) Anyway, I came here, because a friend works close by and asked to meet me there. I didn't even know Macy's has a seventh floor. Let alone a secret escalator from its seventh floor up to the ""Factory"". So I came with low expectations, knowing this is a chain that has high caloric foods and is very popular among teens and tourists.  We met at 4:30 pm and my friend had already put her name down. We waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. Thankfully, we were seated outside right at the edge of the balcony with view of Union Square. Really nice! The waitress was very friendly, offered bread (which we refused) and came back after she saw we had wrestled down the huuuuge menu. I wasn't really super hungry, so I opted for something small and fried instead of large and healthy (weird logic, I know). So I got little potato balls filled with cheese and bacon and a sour cream dip... an appetizer that was more than a normal person would eat as a whole meal. My friend got a pizza, which was regular sized. Both dishes were surprisingly good. I saw a lot of other fried things, but also salads, fish etc. on other tables, it all looked appetizing.  We skipepd the dessert, but took a look at the cake counter. Man, those pieces were ginormous! I would have loved to take one home, to see what the fuss is all about, but didn't want to drag cake through SF on my shopping tour, so I didn't. The prices are ok, I guess. For the amount of food you get, the nice view, the service.  I would come back if somebody wanted to absolutely go. It's not fine dining, it's not healthy, but it's good."
PJ T.,"Daly City, United States",19,129,273,4.0,4/10/2015,you go the view and the cheesecake.  everything is what you expect from the factory.  we went at Saturday for lunch (2pm).  elevator from the ground floor take you all the way to the top.  Little wait for the patio.  only 15-20 minutes.  not bad.
J L.,"Dallas, United States",0,6,,4.0,29/1/2017,"Great views, food and service! Pretty convenient location if you're staying in Downtown San Fran. They've outdoor and indoor seating. We dined in but enjoyed the great views of Union Square while we waited to be seated. We waited between 20-40 mins which isn't bad because the restaurant was packed. The food was great. We ordered zucchini, portobello and avocado fries as our appetizer. We wanted a country salad and some soups brought before our entrees. Usually this is a problem because they bring them with the main dishes but we told the waiter and he brought everything the way we wanted. We had the orange chicken and herbed salmon. Kudos because the latter was cooked perfectly. Our experience was good enough that we went again during our stay."
Brenda G.,"Moss Beach, United States",228,25,5,2.0,11/8/2015,"The gentleman named Benaster at the register is terrible. When he confirmed my to go order, it was incorrect. I ordered 2 louisiana chicken pastas with no vegetables. The order was made with no vegetables AND no spices. He huffed and puffed while making me feel how inconvenient it was for him to tell the kitchen to add spices. He also made it a point to mention that ""it was a fill in cashier"" Whenever that means. When my order was ready, he said ""okay you're all set"" ...actually I also ordered a strawberry lemonade. He went to the bar to get it, came back, handed me the lemonade and walked away before I could ask him what his name was. Benaster was rude to the point that i felt offended. I asked another gentleman standing nearby what his name was, he replied ""Band.""  This interaction was still bothering me when I got home, so I called to speak to a manager. Anthony informed me that there was no employee there named Band. I described the young man and he informed me of his real name.  0 stars for the rude service while I was there. 2 stars for Anthony, thanks for taking care of me."

No big deal we had plenty of time and ordered some drinks at the bar and lounged outside by the big sign overlooking Union Square (quite a nice view). We were seated around 8:20pm. One tip I will say is that while there is always a bit of a wait the outside seating usually is quicker (there are heat lamps all around, so it's still very warm and the view is great especially with the fog rolling in). One other tip I will say to do is while waiting look over the menu! The menu has a ton of options and by knowing what you want now you can get your order in ASAP. Anyways, after we were seated it took probably 5-10 more minutes to get the waiter to our table and we ordered. I ordered the chicken and biscuits and a nacho appetizer. It took roughly another 20-30 minutes to get the rest of our food, but I am the type that likes to talk and after a few drinks we didn't even notice the time passing by. Our waiter Javier was very nice and was never pushy or impassive. The nachos were great! They had a sweet taste to them and everything came together nicely and nothing tasted soggy (like some nachos can be). The chicken and biscuits was also very good! I didn't realize they came with mushrooms (which I hate) but they were easy enough to identify and move over. The chicken was nice and juicy and the gravy went well with the meal. Since we were out we all decided to order some cheesecake. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and it was superb like usual. Overall, a nice spot.  A tad pricey, but if your in the city and looking for a consistent place with a nice view check this spot out. Just remember that there's a bit of waiting, but it's worth it at the end."
Alexa W.,"Oakland, CA",142,235,332,3.0,7/2/2015,"I must admit, I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory in my life. It just never came up. Neither have I been to an Olive Garden. I might have to remedy that soon, so I can be part of the bashing ;-) Anyway, I came here, because a friend works close by and asked to meet me there. I didn't even know Macy's has a seventh floor. Let alone a secret escalator from its seventh floor up to the ""Factory"". So I came with low expectations, knowing this is a chain that has high caloric foods and is very popular among teens and tourists.  We met at 4:30 pm and my friend had already put her name down. We waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. Thankfully, we were seated outside right at the edge of the balcony with view of Union Square. Really nice! The waitress was very friendly, offered bread (which we refused) and came back after she saw we had wrestled down the huuuuge menu. I wasn't really super hungry, so I opted for something small and fried instead of large and healthy (weird logic, I know). So I got little potato balls filled with cheese and bacon and a sour cream dip... an appetizer that was more than a normal person would eat as a whole meal. My friend got a pizza, which was regular sized. Both dishes were surprisingly good. I saw a lot of other fried things, but also salads, fish etc. on other tables, it all looked appetizing.  We skipepd the dessert, but took a look at the cake counter. Man, those pieces were ginormous! I would have loved to take one home, to see what the fuss is all about, but didn't want to drag cake through SF on my shopping tour, so I didn't. The prices are ok, I guess. For the amount of food you get, the nice view, the service.  I would come back if somebody wanted to absolutely go. It's not fine dining, it's not healthy, but it's good."
PJ T.,"Daly City, CA",19,129,273,4.0,10/4/2015,you go the view and the cheesecake.  everything is what you expect from the factory.  we went at Saturday for lunch (2pm).  elevator from the ground floor take you all the way to the top.  Little wait for the patio.  only 15-20 minutes.  not bad.
J L.,"Dallas, TX",0,6,,4.0,1/29/2017,"Great views, food and service! Pretty convenient location if you're staying in Downtown San Fran. They've outdoor and indoor seating. We dined in but enjoyed the great views of Union Square while we waited to be seated. We waited between 20-40 mins which isn't bad because the restaurant was packed. The food was great. We ordered zucchini, portobello and avocado fries as our appetizer. We wanted a country salad and some soups brought before our entrees. Usually this is a problem because they bring them with the main dishes but we told the waiter and he brought everything the way we wanted. We had the orange chicken and herbed salmon. Kudos because the latter was cooked perfectly. Our experience was good enough that we went again during our stay."
Brenda G.,"Moss Beach, CA",228,25,5,2.0,8/11/2015,"The gentleman named Benaster at the register is terrible. When he confirmed my to go order, it was incorrect. I ordered 2 louisiana chicken pastas with no vegetables. The order was made with no vegetables AND no spices. He huffed and puffed while making me feel how inconvenient it was for him to tell the kitchen to add spices. He also made it a point to mention that ""it was a fill in cashier"" Whenever that means. When my order was ready, he said ""okay you're all set"" ...actually I also ordered a strawberry lemonade. He went to the bar to get it, came back, handed me the lemonade and walked away before I could ask him what his name was. Benaster was rude to the point that i felt offended. I asked another gentleman standing nearby what his name was, he replied ""Band.""  This interaction was still bothering me when I got home, so I called to speak to a manager. Anthony informed me that there was no employee there named Band. I described the young man and he informed me of his real name.  0 stars for the rude service while I was there. 2 stars for Anthony, thanks for taking care of me."
