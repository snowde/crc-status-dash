Lea M.,"Fairfield, United States",603,644,992,1.0,16/3/2015,"Aside from the fantastic view from the rooftop from Macy's at Union Square, you're most likely missing out on nothing.  I don't know why I expected a euphoric meal but from what we all ordered, everything tasted quite off.  Oh, never mind the dead bug stuck to the inside of my water cup... or the disgusting amount of cooking oil left on my chicken.   Wasted calories."
Daniel P.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,2,3.0,16/7/2016,"Good food! Avoid Saturdays when you'll wait too long for a table snd service delay. Keep traditional, it is the best cheesecake."
Austin Q.,"San Francisco, United States",0,9,1,1.0,16/7/2016,"This is the only restaurant I've been to where most of the patrons know the food isn't good, the service is abysmal, the wait times are unreasonable but it's still packed to the gills. Decent view of the construction site (formerly known as Union Square.) I weep for the U.S. if all the Euro tourists come away thinking this is the ""best Americans have to offer."" Safety tip: don't be on one of those over-worked elevators when the cables finally snap, and I'm sure it's well overdue."

Sydney C.,"Berkeley, United States",5,156,38,3.0,18/12/2016,Stopped by this place for some dessert. Service was very nice. We were seated outdoor and the scenery was great. Food was okay.
Ali S.,"Huddinge, Sweden",11,110,196,4.0,18/6/2014,You always now what you're gonna get which I love about the Cheesecake Factory. We had the Moroccan chicken which is our favorite dish. The food is average but you have to be honest why you really keep on coming back here.. The cheesecakes of course! We've almost went through all of them and they're delicious. :-)
Gabriel R.,"Pittsburg, United States",21,11,14,5.0,10/1/2016,"Love this place, amazing desserts and really good food!! Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake my favorite so far"
Aditya P.,"Hayward, United States",5,10,,1.0,11/7/2016,"Update ; My mother spoke with the manager who got us another and repeated "" We usually dont do this as it causes confusion"" How LUCKY AM I today wow!!!!!!! They made an exception. Great Views .. Great Food.. Been here so many times. Come in on a Monday Afternoon with my family and we get a table outside in the heat. We wait a while and see that another table opens up in the shade. We check with our server if we can me moved to that table due to the extreme heat hitting us at our current table. The server checks can comes back and says its our policy we cant move you if your food is ordered. Reallly??? Even if a table is empty and they would rather inconvenience their guests. Bad Experience!!!"

Damian C.,"Las Vegas, United States",195,1,,1.0,24/7/2016,"Food came out cold, place is hard to find. Servers do not even know the menu. We felt sick immediately after eating prior to the check coming. Would not recommend if looking for quality food and a good time. By far worst cheesecake my family has ever been too. Not to mention they didn't have Togo silverware to go with our cheesecake as well as their credit card machine being down. A complete inconvenience and won't be returning to this location."
Regina R.,"San Francisco, United States",196,31,4,5.0,5/6/2016,"The price is nice. Good food + huge portions. Great location. Enjoy coming here for the calamari,  macaroni and cheese trays, chicken bellagio,  Craig's Crazy Carrot cake, and most importantly how clean the restaurant is. Other locations have wet, greasy floors, disgusting restrooms."
justine m.,"Pacifica, United States",3,23,7,1.0,21/9/2016,"This place is so overrated.... Way over priced, microwave food, rude servers and super crowded. If you are going downtown to eat there are way better places... Tad's is down the street and has awesome food... Don't waste your money on Cheesecake Factory."
Shiran L.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,3,1,1.0,3/1/2017,"If I could give no star, I would do that. I'm traveling all over the world and I've been at Cheesecake Factory before but what I experience here was beneath criticism !! I'm talking about the costumer service. Me and my family arrived to have a nice dinner, we waited 56 min (!!) which we've been told it will take 40-50 min and it was ok, we approach the lady in the desk (blond and young) to ask if anything change and she ignore us brutally! After my brother and my brother in law tried with no success I approached her and she completely ignore me and told me that I interrupt her, without saying a word!! I was in shock and ask to talk to the manager, which came aggressively (I guess he was so busy, it is a crowded place) and without hear us ask us to leave!! I don't need to say how I felt, in front of 100 people! I'm a flight attendant, I've been in many restaurants in my life and I know how costumer service should be, obviously not like that.  For sure I'm not going to be back in a place that doesn't respect his customers !! I'm going out to have fun and not to be insulted!! At least you would expect that the manager will hear both side to the story but If he act like that, I'm not wondering . Cheesecake Factory San Francisco and all over us, I never going to be back, and everyone who ask my opinion (and people ask for it because of my job) - I'll tell him to stay away. You lost good costumer but I guess you don't care."
Enrique V.,"Fresno, United States",68,18,1,1.0,24/6/2016,"My chicken came out bloody and I told another server and his response was ""unfortunately, talk to your server"" barely got a refill on my water at the end of my dinner"
Ursula M.,"Berkeley, United States",325,1,,3.0,2/1/2017,This is the worst restaurant in existence they were even out of cheese cake how the he'll u outta cheese cake when this is the cheese cake factory would recommend tho guess today was an off day I been here before and they serve good food but today it was decent good service tho
Al L.,"Daly City, United States",124,4,1,1.0,21/7/2016,Experience was horrible. First we waited for 2hours and 45 minutes for a party of 7. When I ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta my pasta was really undercooked. I can't lie I ate the shrimp off the plate. The server said it was no problem and he took the plate back. When he returned he served me a shrimp and sausage pasta but the shrimp were gone. Hmm makes me wonder if my plate was microwaved and served back to me. Never again.
Candy A.,"Concord, United States",12,56,6,1.0,20/11/2016,"Probably the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. A group of 4 of us came in on a Sunday for a quick bite before heading home. It took our waitress over 10 minutes to come and greet us, once she took our drink orders it took another 30 minutes to get those. My drink came with a brown piece of celery and had been sitting out long enough before being served to me that the ice had melted significantly.  It took another 45 minutes before our food was brought out, none of us got our food at the same time one friends nachos came out cold & had touchable frozen parts, another friend's dish took 10 minutes later to come out and was smothered in pepper and garlic in the worst way possible. Two of our dishes were free but it doesn't really make up for the shit show & ridiculous wait times. The restaurant was not busy yet and somehow guests that were seated after us were getting their orders before us and were able to leave before we did. It was awful and I'll never go back."
Ashlee F.,"Burbank, United States",18,16,,1.0,23/5/2015,Horrible service don't waste your money.  I never get give bad reviews but I'm appalled at this place
Octavio M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,1.0,17/1/2016,Worst service ever!!! The woman at the counter was chatting with her colleague and after I said excuse me a few times did she acknowledged me with the demeaning look.  I just left.
Angela P.,"Cerritos, United States",1,3,,1.0,17/7/2017,"I decided to visit this location because I wasn't able to find any other restaurant that was appealing. I went at about 12 P.M. and waited for 20 minutes to get seated. Everything was pretty good until we ordered and began waiting for our food to come out. It wasn't very busy at this time but the service was extremely slow and our waiter barely came to check up on us throughout our wait. It is extremely hard to get the waiters' attentions here. Our first entree came out 30 to 40 minutes after we ordered and because our second entree was nowhere to be seen, we asked the waiter about our dish and was told about ten minutes later (again slow service) that they had accidentally served our food to another table and that they would cook it again. The wait time was supposedly 10-15 minutes but it was far longer than this. We asked for another glass of lemonade and the check after we finished our meal and this also took a long amount of time. As I said before, the waiters do not come to check up on you very much so we needed to go up to the front desk ourselves and pay. Not only was the service itself bad, but they made a mistake in our check as well. One of the dishes that we had ordered was charged for twice instead of once. We had to ask for a manager but even then we had to wait for another 15 minutes to see them and wait for an 5 extra minutes for them to find the specific waiter that served us. Experiencing all of this, I am positive that I will never visit this location again."
