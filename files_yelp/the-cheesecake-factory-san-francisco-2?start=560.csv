Raymond S.,"Milpitas, United States",172,10,2,3.0,29/12/2016,"This place is average compared to other cheesecake factories in the Bay Area. To start off, it took 1 hour and 45 for our party of 8 to get seated at the table. The service was decent but the food took pretty long to prepare and be served. Overall, the dishes were tasty and the Cajun Jambalaya is a dish I'd recommend for next time."
Joyeta S.,"San Francisco, United States",255,78,52,4.0,23/9/2015,Cheesecake Factory I have been going to for 5 years. It's awesome for the ambience and the cheesecake. Most of the entrees are good too. You have to know what to pick though. I love the Thai glazed salmon which is not on the menu. I also like chicken Madeira. It's a good time to go there with a bunch of people in your party.
Laura B.,"Evanston, United States",124,5,,3.0,17/7/2016,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory before and know they don't have the best service, however this Cheesecake Factory has the worst I've seen so far. After an hour of waiting we finally got a table and some bread. We didn't have silverware and asked for it 3 times, 20 minutes later our food got there. The manager took the time to walk up to our table and say he was sorry for the delay. HE DIDN'T BRING US SILVERWARE THOUGH. After asking for it again we finally got it. Clearly not the best service."
MorePeas S.,"Oakland, United States",5,35,,2.0,30/6/2016,"Not great, here's why: - be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for your table and likely double if you come during peak times  - subpar service; the wait staff is too blasé with no notion of customer service. Considering the price point is as high or higher than other area restaurants, I'd  expect the level of service to be commensurate. Took 15 minutes to get water. Our fries came out 10 minutes after we got our burger, no knives or spoons at our table...the list goes on - blah mains; in San Francisco you can easily find higher quality food for the price The only bright spot was the cheesecake. Go there for a slice and save yourself the disappointment that comes with having a full meal."
Anudari K.,"San Francisco, United States",181,99,592,5.0,6/5/2014,"The service is VERY pleasant almost every time i go there considering how BUSY they are ALL the time!! Always very attentive. I think in all locations! Never encountered servers w attitudes lool I just love the price and portion of this place. Food is also very good w the exception of the chicken teriAke!  My fav starter - is the fried roll Course - steak diana, Louisiana pasta, chicken madiera Drink - strawberry n banana daiquiri  I also recommend the factory combination!!!! U can select any combos u want from the courses.  Weeknights be prepAred to wait 40-1hr, bar area is first come first serve! While u wait, u can take the escalator down to macys n shop! :)"
Shay L.,"Los Angeles, United States",44,4,,2.0,29/6/2016,Don't come here after 10pm  all the everybody wants to go home  and  are not focus with your order and have bench of excuse  get ready for your meal to be late minimum 30 min!!!
Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, United States",820,1466,1100,5.0,22/7/2014,I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory but this location since it's on the 8th Fl and you get nice views of downtown. I was staying a few blocks away and we decided to come here for dinner.  The food was great as you can expect it in any of the Cheesecake chains.
Mike C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,43,37,5.0,9/3/2015,"A-must-go experience if you ever travel to San Francisco. I highly recommend you request sitting outside. It's an awesome view of Union Square. Their food selection is too broad to review, but I have to say that if you do go, please don't forget to try their cheesecake. You won't be disappointed."
Mateus N.,"Detroit, United States",3,12,5,5.0,10/6/2015,Very nice place to take a partner with a cool view! Just be careful to not get a table outside in a windy/cool day of San Francisco. Not so expensive and what you buy it's really worth it the price. You can go there after riding the Cable Car on Powell Street and make your day nicer! Their soups are very good and the hamburgers as well. I like that you can order a small salad as a side instead of fries. Cool staff and awesome decoration inside.
Sahil B.,"San Francisco, United States",34,59,2,1.0,22/3/2015,Terribly slow service. They need to hire more servers asap.  If you come here then expect the usual great food but also expect to wait one hour for someone to bother taking your order and another order for them to check on you.
Steve G.,"San Pedro, United States",127,2,10,4.0,10/4/2016,Nice place to unwind and watch pigeons attack leftovers on the outside patio. Attentive staff who brought us mimosas quickly. A lot of rude customers who need to stay home
Lynn P.,"San Francisco, United States",9,53,43,3.0,21/5/2016,"The wait on a Saturday night is long. It took 45 minutes to seat a party of 2. it's actually not that bad since they gave us a buzzer, and we just browse around at Macy's until we get seated. Food takes long to arrive and since they all arrived at once, our fries was cold."
Jaiesha C.,"Vallejo, United States",18,53,47,5.0,14/2/2015,"Today my fiancé and I celebrated Valentine's Day at Cheesecake Factory, Union Square! The wait was only 15 mins when we arrived at 1:15pm and got our pager. Once we were seated, My fiancé and I ordered our drinks. He ordered a Piña Colada, I ordered Pineapple Mojito (which was very good) and Passion Fruit Tea. For our food orders, we had the Avocado Rolls ( they are so delicious; thanks yelp reviews), my fiancé had the Everything Pizza (delicious) and I had my Southern Chicken Sliders (from my previous review). Our server name was Lynn; awesome customer service! After we ate, we bought some cheesecake to go! My fiancé he the Red Velvet Cheesecake and Key Lime. I had the Oreo Extreme Cheesecake; all three are delicious but the Oreo Extreme is very rich in chocolate, so be cautious if you decided to try the Oreo Extreme. Overall we had a great day; happy Valentine's Day!!"
Josue V.,"San Francisco, United States",20,130,135,4.0,14/3/2015,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food at this Cheesecake Factory. Be ready for the most insane wait times, but they are warranted due to the fact that this restaurant is pretty much the only one open past 10pm on a weekend night. My gf and I had to wait only 45 min, which was quick compared to the 2-3 hour waits I heard for the groups in front of us. Once we got seated the waitress was patient with us and did not rush which I appreciated. We started with the crispy Cuban rolls and the loaded baked potatoes tots. Both were very good and the sauces were on point. I decided to go with a classic for dinner, fettuccini Alfredo, made well and no issues. I always believed that cheese cake factory is overpriced and still do, but nonetheless it was a pleasant late night meal and if you get reservations take em!"
Jordan B.,"Vallejo, United States",52,305,471,4.0,10/10/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is nice but super crowded !! Ordered jambalaya and the cucumber lemonade, yum! Our waitress was very nice; if you go Saturday night be prepared to wait two hours. Awesome view outside on the balcony of the city and union square."
Carol M.,"American Canyon, United States",8,60,52,5.0,19/5/2015,Had dinner with co-workers and luckily the wait wasn't long. The waitress was super nice and very  patient since we all wanted separate tabs & I know that can be a pain and most of all annoying. But she never made us feel uncomfortable :) all are meals for delicious.
Donghyun L.,"Oakland Gardens, United States",7,6,,4.0,31/12/2016,"Although there were so many people and we had to wait more than an hour to be seated, we were able to leave our name and phone number and were told to come back later so that the waiting was not hard at all. The service was good and the food was pretty goos too. It was really comfortable to not have to wait in a line in front of the restaurant but instead were able to shop until it was our time to be seated"
Michael Angelo R.,"San Francisco, United States",14,43,95,4.0,7/5/2015,Good food. Courteous servers. Loud music. Nice view on the patio (view of the union square).
Epi S.,"Burlingame, United States",0,16,21,4.0,17/12/2015,We went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. This place is crazy busy and we waited for 45-50mins for a table of two. Service was fast and our waitress was very pleasant. Ms.Tania was kind enough to get me another pina colada when I told her that there wasn't enough alcohol in my drink. We waited for a table outside and it was worth the way. Tasty food and plenty variety of food. Thank you Tania for the great service & Happy Holidays!
Matt G.,"Stockton, United States",0,1,,2.0,26/12/2016,"My experience at the Cheesecake Factory was quite unsatisfactory I waited 2 1/2 hours to gain entry and about 30 min to receive my food.all of my friends received their food about 20 min before me,I had to wait much longer the only reason I'm giving the star is for the customer service we had a great waitress"
