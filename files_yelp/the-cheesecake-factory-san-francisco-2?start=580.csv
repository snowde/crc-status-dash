Tina L.,"San Francisco, United States",14,115,2,1.0,3/2/2015,"If you ever decide to order a cake here, don't get any writing because it is hideous.  If they don't know how to decorate properly, they just shouldn't offer it.  $3.50 for some chicken scratches that my 3 year old niece can write better.  No thanks!"
Carol C.,"Alameda, United States",198,883,6321,4.0,23/11/2012,"This is almost an annual ritual for my sisters and me to dine at the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday and then head to SF Chinatown. Check in time:  11:57 AM.  I was told by a young gentleman at the front registration desk that the wait would be approximately one hour and ten minutes.  Okay, I will wait for that duration.  It's understandable as the place was packed ""to the rafters""...awww...j/k.   Pager buzzed and flashed at 12:17 PM...wow a 20 minutes wait...not bad at all; I was seated at 12:20 PM.  Oldest sister was a few floors down in one of the department making a purchase.  Waiter was cool that we weren't all seated yet.   We're ready to order at 12:55 PM...not the fabulous waiter's fault that there was about a half hour delay.  Jason was very attentive and friendly.  He was prompt in serving whatever we ordered.  He periodically checked and inquired whether everything was okay. My sisters had the strawberry and raspberry lemonades...too sweet and they diluted them.  I decided to go with the Arnold Palmer.  Green tea is not a choice of tea to complement lemonade...restaurant does not serve it in this manner.  Choice was either black tea or passionfruit tea.  Okay - passionfruit tea with the lemonade - 3.25 stars (taste and presentation)...too bad this was not the Arnold Palmer from the Westside Club at the   Coliseum. Garlic noodles - spaghettini with fresh asparagas, shiitake mushroom, sun ripened tomato, topped with parmesan cheese...dish needed more garlic flavoring...3.5 stars. Barbecue ranch chicken salad - one of our favorite salads on the menu...4 stars. Dessert:  We wanted something different from our usual tiramisu.  One mango key lime cheesecake, please, for three people to share.  Quite delicious - subtle sweetness of the mango combined with the right amount of tartness of the key lime, graham cracker laced with shredded coconut...4.5 stars."
J H.,"Berkeley, United States",15,43,127,3.0,26/12/2015,"Lots of random memories here.  Came here two days ago on Christmas Eve.  Love the bustling energy of this place.  It's difficult to get a table right away so I usually end up sitting at the bar.  However, this place can be a bit unorganized .  As we were waiting for the elevator to go up to the restaurant, there was a guard/security guy who kept on yelling at everyone to make sure we understood the long wait; it almost seemed like he didn't want people to go up to the restaurant.  And the restaurant was busy as always.  The location as well as the view of Union Square definitely draws in people.  But management needs to do something about the chaotic ambiance."
Vipul Z.,"San Francisco, United States",32,55,21,2.0,27/5/2016,Not a great place for vegetarians. We had Evelyn pasta which was ok & Veggie burger which was very bland and lacked flavor. Lemonade were also forgetful. Dishes were very costly too. And to top it off we tried two cheesecakes & they were also good but not worth the hype that this place generates. Views from waiting area were amazing. Might not go back again.
Hortensia M.,"San Leandro, United States",88,7,5,4.0,13/9/2014,Ok I like to give the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because service they're friendly and attentive but your wait time to be seated is at least 45 minutes which is a bummer  Now the food is great but its never hot  My favorite dish is the Steak Diane the gumbo the Jamaican black pepper shrimp the Cajun pasta and the Grande burrito  love all their drinks they're strong   I come here often with my boyfriend he order the same thing every time the steak diane
Hayley B.,"Carlsbad, United States",202,18,3,1.0,14/5/2016,"This was no doubt the most deplorable experience I've had at the Cheesecake Factory. It started out well with good drinks but quickly went south. Our table was missing silverware so when our food came we couldn't eat anything. The server also ordered the wrong food so one person in our group had to wait another 15 min to eat. The waiter never checked on us so our drinks never got refilled and other servers almost brought us the wrong food twice. Because of the lack of service, we were there for about 2 hours to complete our experience that should have been no more than 45 minutes. Previous times at other locations were amazing. However, this time was by far the worst dining experience we have ever had a any restaurant."
Leeana B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",116,28,14,4.0,26/3/2015,"I mean it was iight. I was eating about 2 feet away from Iggy Azalea and I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to get the same dish she got. She got a bunch of random crap on her plate then she spit it out and started rapping about all the ingredients that was on it then called it her single for her next album.  Overall...it was aiight."
Medi M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,2,2.0,1/6/2015,Went to Cheesecake Factory on Sunday night and it was surprisingly super busy !! Estimated time was 30min to get a table but we end up by waiting for an hour !!!!! The hostess was nice and apologized for the long wait. Second part was the waitress she was so overwhelmed keep forgetting stuff  The two stars is for the food and the hostess !! Sorry it's my last time
Jose M.,"San Ramon, United States",5,36,26,3.0,24/5/2016,"Problems for THIS specific location. No happy hour, 1st off. 2ndly, hostess at the front desk was really in her own world, tapping away at the screen with her Long nails, which honestly isn't allowed in Any California food franchise no matter if your working up front or in the kitchen. But I digress, she wasn't a paying attention to anyone waiting in line, and she was fake-nice, you can tell who those types of people are. long sorry short it's NOT a good place for service, you need to come prepared to order everything all at once because there is no good service here. Surprisingly food was normal as always."
Kim K.,"Santa Monica, United States",0,22,,2.0,4/12/2016,"Only wanted a relaxing Sunday Brunch- ordered the crab hash and the dish came full of potatoes and a few strands of crab for $15. I would gladly pay $50 for a quality crab dish. I Felt it was not justified and asked to speak to the manager for feedback. They sent the manager Mariah who only walked over with an air of arrogance and attitude,  offered no apology or explanation. Her attitude ""too bad that's how we do it"". She has poor customer service relation skills and needs An attitude adjustment. She Should not be in a management position if this is how she handles a simple situation.  I appreciated the kitchen manager who was in charge of the whole restaurant. He was gracious and humble. He explained that they measured the portion. If this is the case then people should know that the $15 crab dish they ordered is really just potatoes. It really came down to how a person in management addresses customers. We also appreciated our waitress. Overall we would not return."
Jennifer B.,"Orange County, United States",751,87,32,4.0,28/1/2015,"LONG wait lines, but I can never avoid this place since my boyfriend is obsessed with their pizza. I always try to find something new to eat whenever we come here. Last time I got a cheeseburger which was surprisingly, AMAZING! I've also gotten the Cajun Chicken Littles plate numerous times because its so good, but don't let the name fool you, the plate is HUGE and it could serve two! The quality of service usually depends on which day you go. Most of the time we try to go on week days to avoid the massive crowds and have usually gotten better service than on weekends."
Stefan H.,"North San Jose, San Jose, United States",9,53,2,1.0,13/1/2015,"We were seated by the manager after our host forgot about us, then had a great night up until a point. I rated the restaurant 5 stars at this point, but have since had to change it due to unforeseen circumstances.  The same night, my girlfriend ended up with crushed glass in her drink, and while the manager at the Cheesecake Factory that night offered to give us some free appetizers (which he did), we still payed full price for the meal.  She could have been seriously injured have had to seek medical attention. The service was adequate so I was tempted to give 2 stars, but the potential for injury was just too high. While the food tasted good, I would not trust this location to provide safe food."
Lorrie T.,"Daly City, United States",0,81,50,2.0,4/5/2015,"The worst ever! Did not like there service at all felt being rushed to pay and get out of the restaurant, very rude people can't believe actually gave them a tip their professionalism is a zero. Even though I told them not to rush me they still did anyway wish could get my money back. Came here before few times with some people employees were nice but when came back by myself they rush me quite bad service there."
Mark C.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,18/6/2016,My server brenda was great On the other hand her co worker who's name im unaware of was suprisingly disrespectful she was horribly rude and acused me of looking at anthoer server in a carnal fashion i felt completly disrespected!!! Horible!!!!
Yassine G.,"Berkeley, United States",70,2,,1.0,18/6/2016,"Me and my friend came here for lunch, and it wasnt a good experience . It took too long to even acknowledge us after being seated. We felt invisible. ,they didnt have turky bacon!! Even dennys has turkey bacon .Dont recommend them at all"
Priscilla F.,"San Francisco, United States",17,92,93,2.0,8/2/2014,"Although I know Cheesecake Factory is a famous dining place for local and tourists ... But everytime I came here , I will have a stomach ache afterwards.  Yesterday when u got home, I had a terrible stomach ache. I'm never coming back , since it has been the second time !  My experience here wasn't great as well , our server is rude and are not respectful. I forgot her name , but she was serving us then walk away to chat with other customers. Extremely rude when replying to our questions ! The food wasn't that fabulous after all"
A D.,"London, United Kingdom",0,58,11,5.0,5/8/2015,"I love this place and always eat here when I visit SF. The food menu has something for everyone. Literally everyone, it's the biggest menu on the planet. And everything I've ever had here is good-to-amazing. If the worst they can do is ""good"", then the place is great. And many things are just delicious, and you can only get them here! Today I had the lettuce wrapped Asian tacos, and boy were they good. Huge! Even though it's formally an appetiser. With two Asian sauces, it was an explosion of flavours. To this I had another starter, the chicken samosas, and WOWSERS these were the best samosas ever. Sooooo good. I had fresh squeezed oj to drink and boy was it fresh. Sitting outside on their terrace can be recommended - for Visitors and Locals alike. The view over Union Square is awesome. So yeah this place is awesome. Service has with no expiration always been great too."
Morgan A.,"Downey, United States",11,27,2,5.0,24/4/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, nothing fancy. Their location is awesome. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the view. There was quite a bit of birds flying/walking around but I don't think that's something they can fix. The turned the heaters on when it was getting colder. The service was great, and so was the food."
Alfred K.,"Hercules, United States",125,110,15,1.0,23/12/2014,"Where do I begin? Is it the long wait where my wait time keeps extending or perhaps the subpar food they serve? Nope, none of the above. Its actually that I got food poisoning from eating here. This used to be a go to place for me with great view of Union Square and decent food. Now the wait is ridiculous and the food is horrible. The customer service was good though. Our server got our orders wrong but made several attempts to correct the error.  But then I spent last night hovering over my toilet when I got home after eating here! Definitely not worth it."
chanchoy p.,"Oakland, United States",236,33,56,2.0,26/3/2015,"There was a blonde lady that looks like iggy azalea with a annoying attitude tone working the front as a hostess that was clearly not friendly or informative on customer service. She gave me a wait time for a group of 14 for 40-45 mins, in reality it took 60-65 mins to get our table. Our group was split to 3 tables indoor seating with horrible lighting. Luckily our waiter was friendly and attentive to our needs by the name of Orlando you the real MVP. I ordered shrimp scampi and steak. Steak was bland and I requested a medium rare, but it was well done. Mash potatoes was cold."
