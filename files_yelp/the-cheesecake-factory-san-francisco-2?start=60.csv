Nic O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/9/2018,"If I could give a zero-star rating, I would. Two women sit at the bar area. We order food and drinks as well as dessert as we are celebrating a birthday. It's football Sunday with 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter. Our previously COMPLETELY unattentive waitress just suddenly cops an attitude and says loudly ""you know you can LEAVE ANYTIME NOW"". I was shocked. I still had wine in my glass and half a cheesecake on my plate. I said to her ""I'm watching the game"". I hope she wasn't surpised by receiving a tip that reflected her service and attitude. As a tourist, it definitely turned me off of going to chains instead of sampling local mom and pop places. This location was a no-no per the culinary cabbie for a reason."
Lakshmi M.,"Phoenix, AZ",130,329,311,3.0,12/12/2016,"My honest rating is a 2.5 star rather than a 3.0, mainly due to crazy wait times and substandard service. This particular Cheesecake Factory location has the longest wait time or line of any Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, most likely due to its location in Union Square. However, they do give you buzzers that will light up and ring once your table is ready. Be warned, the buzzer does not work if you wander too far away from the hostess area. I would highly recommend not going near a major meal time unless you are super ready to hunker down for a wait.  Service here is either amazing or terrible. I've had attentive servers who are super nice on certain days then extremely rude, inattentive waitstaff on other days. This inconsistency really bothers me as bad service can turn any restaurant experience sour quite quickly. One good thing about this Cheesecake Factory is that it is easy to access by various different modes of public transportation (BART, MUNI, bus). This particular location is also quite nice in terms of aesthetics. The outside views are great and the inside is clean and well decorated. I'll always love the desserts and the avocado eggrolls at The Cheesecake Factory, but long lines and bad service really deter me from going there more often."
David C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,5,2.0,1/7/2018,"I only give this establishment 2 stars at most because the food is actually not bad at all. My issue is with the service........or lack thereof. The frontline staff sadly had problems knowing where to seat people with no structure or order whatsoever. It was as if we were all playing musical chairs in hopes of finding somewhere to be seated. The service we got from our waitstaff was less than impressive. Sometimes I just wanted to go grab what we needed and we would have been serviced better. For the amount one pays here, how good the food and decor is you would expect the service to match. Not even close. Management is either setting no example, a poor example or is allowing this to pass under their noses. And every time we come here it's the same result: good food but crappy service.....sad."
Jasen O.,"Waipahu, HI",155,42,255,5.0,7/29/2017,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory - great food and exceptional service.  Located at the top of Macy's in San Francisco, you should definitely go here for the view. Just a few steps from the outdoor seating, the Macy's sign, visible from the hearts of San Fran, is situated. Overall, same memorable food with a great view. Enjoy!"
Raja S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/27/2017,There is a pretty long wait time but out of all the Cheesecake factories I've been to (about 7 so far) I'd say it's the best.  The food is the same as most of the others. It's just the location that can have a nicer view and also the long wait time that plays a major role here.
Cory T.,"San Francisco, CA",94,26,5,1.0,10/5/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory! But on this visit I have to say I will probably never return. Yes this location always has a wait, it's hit or miss with customer service. I had places an order for the Mac and cheese burger. I waited about 45min and someone other then my waiter brought out my food. I noticed lots of bacon sticking out, so I mention that she must have the wrong table. She then informed me that that's what I ordered! I then told her I have never eaten bacon in my Whole life. She said well that's what you ordered, And walked away. I then asked the next person I saw and asked her for my waiter, and she told me he was on a break. I told her the situation, she left, came back and said he put in a bacon burger. She then left as well. At no time did anybody offer to get me what I wanted. My server came back and I informed him, her was very sorry for the mistake. At this point I had ate the fries but nothing else. He offered to replace my burger, I told him I couldn't wait any longer for what I had ordered. I brought me the check and offered me some cheesecake. He made it sound like he was going to give it to me for the mistake. I asked for it to go, he then gave me the cheesecake, and my check. I had still been rung up for the burger, I then noticed also the cheesecake. So I paid for a burger I didn't even eat.  I will never be back!!!"
Oxana B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/8/2018,"We got lettuce wraps for 15$, not worth it. The  4 little pieces of chicken were burnt. The 17$ toscan chicken  on the other hand was not cooked. So we were chewing on some plain chicken. Don't expect quality food from them, you'll be disappointed."
Sharron G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",33,170,10,2.0,7/5/2017,"Stopped in simply because we wanted to have dessert for dinner. Cheesecake is always a good choice and we happened to pass it, so stopped in. The cheesecake was exactly as I remembered it - tasty. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. As we're sitting their waiting for our cheesecake, we're looking around and remembering why we aren't huge fans. They seat too many tables for one waiter. None of the vacant tables I saw had complete place settings. We were sitting at a 4-top, two of the seats had a full place setting, minus the napkins and included dirty appetizer-sized plates. The other two place settings included dirty app-sized plates and a fork and a spoon, and those two settings had napkins.  Decor.... seriously, I think that I've been to four different Cheesecake Factories and they all had the same decor. And we're talking YEARS in between the visits, my last one was in Scottsdale a couple of years ago. Before that was on the east coast easily 10+ years ago. I've never understood the decor. It's. Just. Boring. Sure, they have terrific cheesecake. Go there for the cheesecake. Tip your waiter well if that's all you get. In most of these towns there are TONS of places with fantastic food..... try one of them for lunch/dinner instead."
John B.,"Antelope, CA",59,4,2,2.0,12/9/2017,"Not the best experience for a vegan. There are three vegans in our family. Two of us ordered the vegan Cobb salad and it was pretty good and very large. Our daughter ordered the veggie burger and we made sure to tell the waiter ""vegan"" instead. It came with mayonnaise under the lettuce which wasn't noticed until two bites were taken. That's not the big issue we had. After they took it away they brought back the same burger with a new top bun only. The burger was cold and partially eaten. Not what we expected at all!"
Rachel S.,"Stockton, CA",0,19,10,4.0,12/19/2017,"Visited San Francisco for a Christmas Shopping trip on weekend of Santa Con. Would give 5 stars but due to craziness of thousands of people enjoying their ""merriment"" & hundreds trying to eat at this restaurant, made the entire seating experience severely stressful! The staff was ridiculously overwhelmed (not their fault) & they definitely were the most disorganized & in over their heads. I didn't care because I knew that it was going to be well worth the wait! Once seated, received the best service & the food, drinks & dessert were amazing! Not to mention the ambiance & view outside on the patio!!! The Bistro Shrimp Pasta is the best wine based pasta sauce I've ever had!! Not an exaggeration. Gluten Free Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to die for!"
Mark R.,"South San Francisco, CA",91,121,286,1.0,9/4/2017,This place just ruined my birthday.  If you're thinking about coming here with more than ten people think twice or you'll be waiting two hours for a table.  And they kept lying to us about the availability of our table because they accidentally gave it to another party.  I could careless about the view it's not that great.  And the food was not that great.  The server was great and she did her job wonderfully.  The one star is for her.  And for the Cheesecake Factory and their hostesses a big middle finger.  Im never going back to any Cheesecake Factory again.
Deveron F.,"Paso Robles, CA",26,10,8,5.0,12/19/2017,"Katie was a great server, 4 kids 6 adults!  We weren't easy but service, food and view were great. Our Christmas tradition."
Semuteh F.,"San Francisco, CA",104,748,1401,3.0,11/28/2016,"3.5 Stars The beau accused me of only liking hipster places but sometimes I'm hip to the Midwest eateries too ;) Came here while killing time waiting for our skating session at the Union Square Rink. I haven't eaten here in years because I'm not big on chain restaurants (chipotle, chick-fil-a and super duper excluded) and quantity over quality. We had buffalo blasts to start (think buffalo chicken samosas) and then I had the chicken bellagio while beau had the chicken and biscuits. Ambient bread came out to start the meal. Bread was just okay--ate it because it was there. Portions are HUGE! We ate all of the app and then were totally conquered by our entrees. We got about 4 meals with leftovers so you can't beat the value here. In terms of the food--meh. Definitely average to slightly above average. It's a chain and food didn't exactly challenge my palette but it's perfectly fine for a place that has a bit of everything. Menu is slightly overwhelming and if you somehow saved room for dessert, there are two pages of cheesecake to choose from. All in all I guess I'm not gonna turn my nose up at this place. It's perfectly fine! Won't find any reclaimed wood, mustached waiters or mason jars for glasses here but it's a good place to get a meal in the area and views are nice. Wait on a Sunday at 4 was an hour but they text you once the table is ready."
Michelle Manu Z.,"San Mateo, CA",13,152,533,2.0,4/26/2017,"Amazing cheesecake, absolutely tasty and delicious...but next time I will stick with it and bring it home.  Unfortunately the service was unbelievably slow. It took over 25 minuets to be seated, other good 15 minutes just to place the order and forever to finally receive the food! By the way, one of the forks that we found on the table was very dirty, some crusted food on it. Food was just not meeting our expectations: Fish and chips was totally bland, pizza was salty and super hard ( I'm sure it was re-heated at least once) chicken sandwich was dry and the amount of chicken inside was ridiculously small... Thumbs up for their burrito which was just ok and the mushroom burger, pretty tasty. Said that, considering the price of the food (in my opinion overpriced for what you get) and the terrible service,we absolutely will not ever eat here again. Still, let me say that their cheesecake is always super good, no matter which one you order, you will never be disappointed."
Brooke T.,"San Ramon, CA",13,37,3,1.0,11/25/2017,"I'm usually a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this time something was off. First, all but one of our meals were brought out. We waited 10 minutes while our food got cold, and still no other order. Then the manager comes along stating that the pasta was taken to a different table...you'd think that since all the meals were cold and that we still needed to wait for them to remake the pasta that at a minimum the pasta would have been taken off the table, but nope! Then, we go and order a whole Cheesecake and we get home to find out it's FROZEN. So now only was the dinner shit, we couldn't even enjoy the dessert. Based on the numerous times we saw the manager running around and apologizing to tables, it's clear something needs to change. It was definitely a huge let down and a waste of an hour wait."
Paula V.,"San Francisco, CA",454,74,77,1.0,9/17/2017,"Really upset with how much time I was put on hold for this order (about 45 min and called three times), the amount of waiting time my friends had to go through in picking up the cake (lost order for payment and lost order for pickup/questioning payment?!), with the quality of this presentation. I REPEAT, I am NEVER ordering a cake here ever again. This presentation is unacceptable to me especially for calling in an order 6 hours early and paying extra for the birthday note."
Arlene A.,"Kenmore, WA",0,19,,1.0,12/17/2017,"We ate there on a Friday night knowing it would be busy. They told us they don't take reservations, but gave us instructions to come back at a certain time and we would get a buzzer. A forty minute wait for the buzzer only led to another 15 minute wait for someone to take us to our table. All four of us had something wrong with our meal...no dressing on a salad, no chicken in the fettuccine, and then we were told that a shared plate had been sent to the wrong table! So two of us had to wait while the others ate...never a good moment. Then our waitress went on her break....but nobody else had been assigned to us nor did we know until she finally returned. Not the best time we have had at a Cheesecake Factory...."
Tim K.,"San Francisco, CA",34,2,10,3.0,11/1/2017,"Well I've lived here 10 years this is my first order- the menu looked amazing. I ordered white chili which was 86'd and Tex mex egg rolls that were at least crunchy- but so gross it was hard to even choke one down. I'm certain if I presented that to the person who cooked and let that leave the kitchen- that person would chew backward into a napkin removing that salt bomb from the palate. I'm certain the small amount I ingested will irritate my stomach. How can you NOT know you're sending that out? Ewww. Of course the cheesecake- Original with hot fudge on the side.....amazing. Guess that's why it's not ""the egg roll factory""  Too bad- with all those choices I wanted to try other things but maybe stick to cheesecake"
Piper W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,331,55,2.0,12/11/2017,"I used to really like the Cheesecake Factory (several years ago) but it's just not as good as it once was. If you like huge portions and upscale diner food you can enjoy this place. The fries are horrible here. The good thing is this place has a huge menu (pages and pages) so everyone can find something they want. From salads and sandwiches to burgers, pasta, chicken and steak dishes. Tons of appetizers and small plates and of course, the HUGE cheesecake menu with delicious and slices are smaller than they used to be. There is outdoor heated seating with views of Union Square. Expect a pretty long wait and they don't take ressies. My tip? Stick to the appetizers. Everything is just not good."
Doran B.,Hong Kong,22,8,15,4.0,10/25/2017,Ordered cheese cake to go at 11:00pm on the way back to out hotel. Staff was helpful but it was a bit slow.
