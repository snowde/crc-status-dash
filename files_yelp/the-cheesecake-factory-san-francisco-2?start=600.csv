Nicky V.,"San Francisco, United States",115,46,13,4.0,29/7/2015,"I give 4 stars due the location. As an SF native I enjoy the convenience of good food and a great ambiance whether it be for date night, meeting friends, or showing family from out of town a nice lunch. I enjoy the brunch menu it is very good, All in all I've eaten (over 20) I have never had a bad experience food or service wise"
Joseph T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,5.0,10/6/2016,Gave it five stars because waiter drop a block of permasean cheese in my pasta
Fi M.,"San Francisco, United States",15,99,2,4.0,8/6/2016,"We really didn't know what to expect of our first visit to the Cheesecake Factory, but after our long and fairly chaotic wait for a table and a fri, we actually had a great time. We weren't exactly expecting gourmet cuisine (& it certainly wasn't) but it was okay grub at an okay price. Better than the dreadful Olive Garden. My bf loved the cheesecake we tried for dessert too (although I thought they were pretty pricey!). I think he could coax me back."
Jim C.,"Irvine, United States",182,13,,5.0,10/5/2016,"Had the Chinese chicken salad, great presentation and flavor.  Generous portion, strawberry cheesecake desert, they are famous on this item for a reason."
Crystal C.,"San Francisco, United States",584,453,87,2.0,16/12/2014,"In San Francisco, a major foodie mecca, one wonders why they throw their money at tourist traps such as Cheesecake Factory. At least, that was what my friend and I wondered a couple Friday nights ago as we walked up from Market for a friend's birthday dinner. The plan had suddenly (and disappointingly) changed from drinks at Novella and maybe some tacos, to a full dinner at CF. Not a fan, to say the least. The staff was unaccomodating, not seating our party until everyone arrived, though there were 3 of us there already, waiting on one more walking up from Market, no one greeted us, no one offered water or bread, and we had a change of server three times in about an hour. I had a $9 glass of old Chardonnay and split two appetizers with my friend. The other girls had a burger and pasta. They all had cocktails which they all complained gave them a sugar headache. I'm not a fan of most chain restaurants, and I plan to never go back here. We split 3 ways and it was like $50 per person. Way too pricey for what it was.  Get it together Cheecake Factory."
Orla L.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",83,173,245,5.0,7/3/2014,"It's getting a 5. I wish I could write loads more reviews to bump this up rating.  Please please please come to Ireland. We all love it when we go to the states. I don't care that it's a chain. Everything I have ever had there is just amazing. The salads are even so tasty. So much choice and at such a great price in comparison to other restaurants, it's a winner in my book."
Sampad D.,"Reston, United States",168,723,401,3.0,4/5/2015,Its a usual restaurant. The best part of this particular place is the view of Union Square.Great view of the city skyline.
Olga T.,"San Francisco, United States",1,12,21,1.0,25/4/2016,"Very poor service. No option to order, reserve or book a table. Not friendly front desk too. I'm not recommend it to any body."
Fáni R.,"San Francisco, United States",46,2,,1.0,15/1/2016,"Went here on New Year's day to eat with my family after a nice afternoon of ice skating. We were a larger group of 17 people so the wait time to sit near each other was pretty long, which was to be expected. However, it was the customer service at the front desk that made this experience horrible. Daniel at the front desk was very condescending in the way he spoke with members of my family concerning a mix up that was of his own doing. Once we were called to be seated after about an hour and a half wait, part of my family was seated on one side of the restaurant and the other on the opposite side. Kind of defeated the purpose of waiting to be seated near each other to continue the family outing don't you think? When approached to remedy the situation Daniel was smug, rude and very unprofessional, which displeased my family. I understand that the place was busy, but having a horrible demeanor with customers doesn't make it any less busy right? Can't handle it, find another gig sir. Enter the manager on duty, Erica. She seemed at first to be understanding and responsive but after speaking with her about Daniel, she kept reminding me that he gets paid $12 an hour and shouldn't have to deal with unhappy customers fussing at him. After a short dialogue about my disappointment in how we were treated, we were able to come to an agreement that would accommodate the inconvenience and downright disrespect that Daniel inflicted. I did however lose respect for Erica, the manager, when at the end of our meal our waitress informed that she was told not to accommodate us as had been previously agreed since the manager changed her mind based on the amount of food that was ordered. Common sense would say that a group of 17 was going to eat a lot of food, a point to which she should have been aware.  Our waitress Denay was absolutely awesome! No complaints at all about her service, I would give 5 stars to her alone if I could. But that front desk....just atrocious. Take my advice, go somewhere else where you will be treated with the respect that any paying customer deserves. They only get 1 star because I can't give them zero."
Zuriko K.,"Hamburg, Germany",9,6,,5.0,24/10/2015,"Even though the location is extremely busy all the time, staff was really friendly. It was our first time there and I was with my wife and our 16 months old daughter with her baby stroller.  I'm gonna say that this location is kid-friendly for sure! We had tons of fun!"
Gigi E.,"Danville, United States",13,9,,4.0,24/10/2016,"Compared to the Stoneridge and the Walnut Creek locations, the food is equally as delicious, but the view was more amazing. Being on the top floor of Macy's, it overlooks Union Square and has a good view of the surrounding shops and streets as well. The food was great, as always, with the cheesy pastas and the exceptional cheesecakes(the Godiva ones especially). Great place to dine with family and friends!"
Elizabeth O.,"Burbank, United States",0,14,,2.0,14/11/2016,"Smells like a dirty dish towel- the cheesecake is great, but not really worth the wait. Portions are big yet everything is over seasoned"
Bubba Z.,"Newark, United States",2,10,,2.0,11/1/2016,"Cheese""wait"" Factory. They should create a section to accommodate larger groups. Waited more than to 2 hrs. for a table for nine."
Jefferson D.,"Daly City, United States",87,5,,5.0,21/4/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory last week. I got a Margherita pizza and an Oreo cheesecake. The pizza was pretty good, thin and crispy dough, perfect quantity of cheese. The Oreo Cheesecake was amazing, very tasty, sweet and huge. Our server was very polite. The pizza was $15 and the Cheesecake $7, it is a great price for that great dinner. I definitely recommend the Cheesecake Factory."
Hannah Y.,"Oakland, United States",5,106,730,5.0,25/11/2014,"YES YES YESSSS. I love Cheesecake Factory. OKAY OKAY OKAY... it's not exactly a michelin star franchise, but for what it is, it's FIVE STARS. It's the bread, the butter, the HUMUNGOUS selection of desserts, appetizers, entrees, drinks, etc etc etc... endless selection of every culture and all wrapped up in a great setting. The view at the very top of SF Macy's building is outstanding, ESPECIALLY during the holidays. The huge tree right smack in the middle of Union Square, the lightings and decorations during the day and darky nights... all of it... I want to infuse my mind and body with all that I can possibly consume with my eyes. The service is soooo ridiculously attentive, and super duper nice. I don't care if they're paid to solely kiss my ass with fake smiles, and 'what else do you need miss?' WHY? Because sometimes a girl just wants to dine and feel nothing but bliss bliss bliss.  The wait is long, but when you're in Macy's with a beeper that will notify you when it's your turn to plug yourself in the Cheesecake Factory Circus of FUN, you can travel via the escalators and just browse with interest, and for me, not with intent to purchase, but just to see with glee. What I love to eat during my special plug in slot time at the tempting layers of choices given at Cheesecake Factory, are the crispy cold caesar salad with gunks of chunky raw garlic, and the chicken lettuce wraps with the three dips. Also, the cheesy dips that act like fondue are spectacular. I always ask for fresh chunky tomato salsa to add a cold refreshing factor to this hot cheesy dip. I miss my frequent visits when I used to live in San Francisco. I should definitely go back during christmas this year!"
Matt M.,"San Francisco, United States",39,8,1,1.0,7/12/2014,"My girlfriend tried to get a simple birthday cake for me and was treated like dirt. After being told her cake would only take 10 minutes and waiting for more than 30, she tried to ask the staff how much longer she would need to wait. At this point the woman behind the counter, Allie (Aly?), simply brushed her off and said that they were too busy. She then ignored my girlfriend's follow-up questions and acted very condescending. My girlfriend was not born in America and English is not her first language, so she politely asked the staff to repeat themselves so she could better understand. This was met with further rudeness. At this point, my girlfriend called me over and the woman's entire attitude changed once she saw me. She was suddenly very apologetic and attempted to be accommodating. We finally got our cake and left after ensuring that they would take action for the shitty attitude. Be aware of racist staff at The Cheesecake Factory. They will feel like they can treat you like shit if you're anything but a white American."
Anne R.,"Hercules, United States",5000,829,322,3.0,24/11/2013,Let me start off by saying:  5 stars for the views if you sit outside  Customer service is a 3.5 or 4 depending on who is serving you  Waiting times on a busy day is a 1 - 2 stars- super long wait mainly to sit outside  The food is 2-3 stars - nothing really special.  Parking 1 star because its expensive as heck and forced to pretty much park across the street.
Janey L.,"Union City, United States",69,149,47,4.0,9/11/2013,"I've always liked Cheesecake Factory, and I love the Cheesecake Factory at Union Square!! If you sit outside, you get a nice view of the Union Square :) you can turn it into a romantic dinner! but the wait is longer for the outside seating so we just sit inside lol too hungry to wait. Although the food&drinks feel a bit overpriced, they do give you big portions. Few favorites:  Shrimp Scampi - big big shrimps with angel hair pasta in creamy tomato sauce?, I wish it was more ""lemoney"". Avocado Eggrolls - crispy hot avocados...can't go wrong with them avocados! Navajo Sandwich - crispy bread with yummy feelings. not too heavy. one of my fav's but I didn't see it on the menu...maybe they don't serve it anymore? or I just missed it. Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp - yum yum yum, sweet&savory. It's kinda hard to describe the taste but it's definitely good! Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - extremely tender chicken chunks...kinda boring taste at first but gets better. Mojito - overpriced watered down...meh never again. Banana Cheesecake & Red Velvet Cheesecake - two of my fav cheesecakes!  Also love the black bread they serve before the meal...oh so good. Our server at union square was really nice too forgot his name though!"
Kristen A.,"El Cajon, United States",0,4,,3.0,30/8/2016,When will Cheesecake Factories across the US get customer service right?  How is it that you invariably have to endure a chaotic 25-75 minute wait in the  obnoxious madness that is the congested waiting area no matter where u go? Poor management across the board. The entrees are passable but what people really go for is are the delectable desserts and the ornate decor.
Lee P.,"Winchester, United States",54,597,1417,4.0,26/7/2012,"Great family dining venue....even with the crowd we encountered on both occasions we went, we were seated within the wait time we were told.
