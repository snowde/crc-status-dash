Kira G.,"London, United Kingdom",53,114,5,2.0,19/3/2015,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and it was a very short wait, as I was ok with sitting indoors. Food was very average. Sadly I couldn't control myself and was full following the bread that came before the food. Not a good situation to be in when the entrees contain, on average, three-meals-worth of food.  The only one I've tried that I'd go back to is the one in Walnut Creek!"
Amanda J.,"Washington, DC, United States",1440,892,308,2.0,6/9/2013,"I'm not one to review a chain, but seriously, this Cheesecake Factory is an experience unto itself. My friend and I came in the day before national cheesecake day with the Facebook offer for a half priced slice of cheesecake.  We gave ourselves 3 hours just to make sure we didn't need to rush to our next engagement.  At 1:00 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, this didn't seem unreasonable.  We were wrong. First, this place has the strangest atmosphere.  There are locals, tourists, homeless people, and the employees all jammed into the top floor of Macy's.  We were taking the elevator up, and there was a psychotic homeless woman harassing everyone.  Remember her, she'll come back later. So we manage to get up to the hostess, get a buzzer, etc.  We're given a wait time of 45 minutes.  Fine.  45 minutes pass, and everyone who had come in before us plus two groups of 7 and 12 after us had been seated.  So I walk up to the hostess, and she clearly had never entered our names... Ok.  Mistakes happen (until you read the other Yelp reviews and see this is common.  Ugh.).  She says we'll be next.  Total time to get seated:  1.5 hours Our waitress came right over with water, got our orders right away, and was efficient. Random Digression:  Suddenly, we turn around to find the CRAZY homeless woman sitting behind us at a table for six.  She had finished her piece of cheesecake and was arguing with her poor waitress that the cheesecake should be free because she can't read her coupon.  Seriously.  For whatever reason, the waitress walked away.  So the crazy homeless woman starts going around the tables that haven't been cleaned yet taking the food off of them.  She proceeds to eat anything left on other tables.  What she couldn't eat, she was placing on her table.  She then had the nerve to ask the waitress for boxes.  The waitress comes back with boxes and her bill.  So she boxes everything, and apparently, left a pile of change.  She then RAN out of the Cheesecake Factory.  Moral of the story:  Your waitress will appreciate a good tip. Meanwhile, we got our slices of cheesecake.  My Kahula coffee cheesecake was good, but the slices here were quite a bit smaller than branches.  Our waitress was decent, though, and she got us in and out without major real pain.  Except that she lost my friend's credit card and had to go searching for it...Not good. I wouldn't come back here.  San Francisco has much better things to offer.  But 1/2 price cheesecake is pretty cool, and the people watching factor will lead to some great stories later."
Javier P.,"Redwood City, United States",1,9,10,4.0,23/12/2014,The ambiance is perfect. Nice and dimmed and being on the eighth floor just makes it sweeter. The view from the balcony seats are just awesome and specially now since the city is adorned with christmas joy.  The steak Diane medallions never fail. Merry christmas everyone!
Andrew G.,"Los Angeles, United States",39,145,12,1.0,30/11/2015,"Just had the worse experience of my life.  Bear with me...  It was Friday, November 27th.  I called the Cheesecake Factory to find out when the best time would be to arrive and put in a reservation for the balcony so that my family could watch the tree lighting ceremony in Union Square.  They said, 3.5 hours in advance.  Okay, no problem.   We drove to San Francisco from Discovery Bay.  Spent 1 hour trying to find parking.  I was able to get inside the restaurant by 3pm and put our names in for the balcony (the ceremony starts at 6pm).  For the next 3 hours we wandered around and waited patiently for our table.   Finally... my little electronic device starts buzzing and flashing and we wait to be seated. We are then taken to a booth... inside... not outside.  After 3 hours of waiting, specifically for an outdoor balcony seat, we get an indoor booth.  No bueno.  We refused and said that we specifically asked for outdoor, so then we had to wait patiently again as they rectified the situation.   Finally we get seated, and we are really excited.  The driving, the parking, the wait, it was all worth it!  45 minutes left until the tree gets lit. Within five minutes of us sitting down and placing our drink orders, swarms and swarms of people start filling the balcony.  People start crowding around tables.  Leaning over tables.  Shoving their crotches in peoples faces.  Squeezing into every available space they can.  Pretty soon, the entire balcony was quickly looking like a mosh pit.   This is absolutely disgusting and rude.  People waited for 3 hours or more to get a balcony seat for this show.  Now, I have already lost faith in humanity so I wasn't actually surprised that people would be this rude and ruin it for people that actually waited patiently, however... I was shocked that management did absolutely NOTHING to stop it.  There must have been 30 tables outside, with people trying to enjoy the view and their food, being completely bombarded by a swarm of rude individuals and not one manager of the restaurant did anything about it.  Oh, and yes, we complained while we were there, and even after our complaint, they did nothing.   Absurd.  Expected better."
Kenny L.,"San Francisco, United States",60,14,5,1.0,20/12/2014,Bad service. Food shit. Utensils not fully clean. This place is a joke. Never coming here again.
Maiya P.,"Harbor City, United States",1,6,,5.0,14/2/2016,The service was amazing from the manager down to our wonderful server Demetris!!!!! He went all out giving us three servings of bread. He refilled our water numerous times and even split the check up. And get this we had 16 people!!!!!! That's what I'm talking about
Frank Harmony T.,"San Francisco, United States",0,5,1,2.0,18/1/2015,"The staff downstairs at Macys  for reservations or information for the restaurant didn't volunteer information. I asked about the restaurant and he never said that I needed reservations or to give my name for a wait, or where the line was.  However our waitress and the staff upstairs were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was fun and unique. Very dark ok, almost too dark to read the menu.  More a bar atmosphere than dining. The food was ok, not great.  Large portions.   The bread was delicious, the crab artichoke dish had a ""fishy"" flavor. The chicken was ok a bit plain and the broccoli is very crunchy. Read almost raw and difficult to spear with my fork. The potatoes were ok if you ate with the chicken otherwise they were a bit salty.  I had an Asian pear martini. It was amazing and bumped this review up to a three Oops I take it back. I just went to the bathroom. It has tissue everywhere, broken toilet paper holders and the sink is desperate of being fully wiped down.   The floors in here are also very greasy. I slipped and I watched another lady slip on the way in. The waitress said oh yes the floors are slippery. No they r greasy and dawn would take care of that ."
Kleber M.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,132,180,5.0,15/8/2015,"It's your typical CKF, but 5 stars for location AND ROOFTOP! We love the outdoor open seating area and would wait or leave but won't dine inside:) Always rooftops and high terraces have a nice flirty vibe to them, we love it. Beautiful times everytime there and it overlooks Union Square."
Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, United States",293,518,1894,4.0,1/8/2013,"NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY GONE WRONG - THOUGHT IT'D BE A SWEET DAY Instead, I was stuck in an elevator for 45 minutes... This location is on the 8th floor of Macys. I entered the elevator, excited as can be to celebrate the debut of the new Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake (plus 50% off any slice!), only to find myself so close, yet so far from satisfying my sweet tooth. The elevator inched upwards to the restaurant, when suddenly, I hear something very similar to a large piece of metal falling. Next thing I know, the elevator stops, but the doors refuse to open. The innermost set of doors shakes before opening, but the outermost doors only slightly part. As people try to pry the doors open, another piece of metal seems to fall, giving the terrifying idea that the elevator is falling apart. We all look at the max capacity sign: 10 people max. We count exactly 10 in the elevator. One person attempts to press the button for help, but to no avail. Great. Panic strikes as first, one girl states she is claustrophobic, another constantly complains it is getting hotter and harder to breathe. Definitely a harrowing experience. We shout for help at people passing by, but it takes a long time before someone finally calls the fire department. Now what? Well of course, in this new age of technology, everyone whips out their smart phone to take photos and videos to post online. Sigh. #instagraminsteadofcallforhelp Eventually, we were saved. I'm very grateful the elevator did not drop, I'm not a roller coaster fan, at all. The manager Christopher M. was super nice and considerate, offering to take care of my meal and often checking to see how I was doing. Living out my name, I felt like a true desserts princess! He recommended starting with the Strawberry Martini to calm my nerves, a deliciously strong yet sweet drink. Then I had the Steak Diane, which was perfectly cooked. Juicy and well-seasoned. Also had Mai Tai, which comes in an interesting glass and looks quite tropical. Finally, ended with the featured S'mores Cheesecake, which had amazingly gooey, toasted marshmallow and was not overwhelmingly sweet. At this location, the ceilings are not as high as the other locations I've frequented. However, there's a patio with a nice view of Union Square (plus pigeons walking around your feet and hopelessly staring at your food). My only complaints (minus the elevator experience, which really wasn't Cheesecake Factory's fault): The indoor floors are slippery, and my group did not receive the complimentary bread until our entrees arrived. Incredible meal and friendly service (thank you so very much Christopher!), but what a night! Still a Cheesecake Factory fan nonetheless. Lesson learned: Take the stairs/escalator, TRUST ME."
Katya O.,"San Francisco, United States",466,52,64,3.0,22/12/2014,"So I'm not sure why this place is always so packed. I mean they have some good items for sure but with so many choices in the city whyy do people seems to always be drawn to this place?  Anyway my boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night around 5 o'clock and the wait was about 20 minutes. The waitress servicing us was very friendly and responsive. We ordered the tuna tartare (yum!), the spicy jambalaya pasta and banana cheesecake. DO NOT get the jambalaya pasta here, idk my boyfriend was raving about it but even he said that it wasn't very good at this location. The noodles were over cooked, the chicken had zero flavor and contrary to its name, it is not even remotely pasta.  I really did enjoy the banana cheesecake though. I am glad they got their desserts down since the place is called the Cheesecake factory :)."
Zoë B.,"Lafayette, United States",28,5,1,4.0,10/8/2015,"Service was good for a busy night, but we waited for an hour to be seated outside and then a seagull watched us eat for our whole meal. It was more than a bit unnerving."
Sam N.,"Big Bear Lake, United States",14,36,39,4.0,31/5/2015,Good food good service good price the only issue is the parking  Thanks cheese cake factory
Elaine Y.,"San Francisco, United States",32,69,497,2.0,19/10/2014,"Waited over 2 hours for a table on a Saturday evening!!! Well, it wasn't my idea to dine here :,( Food was ok Service was terrible Wait was ridiculous  What we ordered for a party of 2 plus take out: 1.Skinnilicious Factory chopped salad 4/5  (Decent portion, reasonable price and low calorie)  2. Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane combo with a side order of broccoli  1/5 (3 large size breaded shrimp, 3 scoop of mashed potatoes and 3-4 small pieces of steak) I like my steak medium cooked, it came out well-done so I sent it back! It yoked about 40 minutes for it to come out again so we ended up pack it for to go. The side of broccoli took that long also. Unbelievable! 3. Meatloaf 2/5 4. Shrimp and chicken gumbo 2/5  5. Tiramisu Cheesecake 4/5 6. Blueberries White Chocolate Cheesecake 3/5 Worst experience ever!"
Jenny T.,"Hayward, United States",350,671,1794,3.0,29/8/2013,"You know what?!  Its not really a factory, its a restaurant, however, it's like the busiest restaurant EVER!! Its so packed that many people end up sitting one level down at Macy's furniture deptartment.  They sit on plush couches like its their right to do it.  Is it though?!  I think Macy's should charge Cheesecake Factory couch rental fees.  I think it's rude! Ayway...Let's talk about the meal! Always good and consistent.  I ordered a rib eye steak with French fries.  My friend ordered the jambalaya pasta.  And we both shared the banana cream cheesecake.  All dishes are great and we thoroughly enjoyed the free bread with butter.   Service is good.  We got there at 5:30pm and waited 5 minutes for a seat.  And dinner was served promptly.  Good times..."
Lauren L.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,9,3,2.0,5/8/2015,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and usually go to the Hillsdale one. I was in San Francisco with my friends today and we decided to try the one here. Problem number one: the wait. It was a Tuesday morning-afternoon so you'd think it wouldn't be so busy, well it was so we had a wait time of 15 minutes. As soon as our buzzer went off, we were told to standby and wait for our waitress to take us to our seat, which lasted about ten minutes. I was confused at this point; why have the buzzer go off only to have us wait even longer? I went up to the desk to ask what we were supposed to be doing, and the girl rudely responded with ""we have a lot of tickets."" I don't know what that means but she could have handled my simple question much more professionally and kindly.  After more minutes of idly standing around, we were finally taken to our seat. Note that there are three people in our party, yet our table only had plates and silverware for two people. I failed to realize this until near the end though, and apparently our waitress never realized it either, even when serving our bread.  My friend had a couple of dollars in quarters that she needed to exchange for some dollars, so when she asked the waitress if she could, the waitress responded quickly with ""you gotta do that at the bakery,"" before she quickly disappeared again. She left my friend confused, we didn't know where the ""bakery"" was since the whole restaurant looked like a bakery.  Next comes ordering. Ordering was fine and our food was good. One of my friends and I got a new batch of water from the waitress, and immediately noticed something was off. Our water was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like tap water mixed with blood, and contained no ice. We asked for a new cup of water, and this time it tasted better, but still had no ice. Next came ordering the cheesecake. I first asked if they were serving the Peppermint Bark one, since our buzzer said ""Peppermint Bark cheesecake is back!"" The waitress responded curtly with ""that's only in the winter."" Feeling a bit disappointed and confused since the peppermint bark flavor was advertised but yet not available, I went with another flavor. Our waitress did not write down what we ordered and memorized it instead. When she brought over our cake, she didn't say a word the whole time and gave each of us our wrong cheesecake. She could have at least asked us who had what instead of slamming them down at our table and have us do the hassle of rearranging of who had what. My friend asked another waitress if she could get a to-go box for the rest of her cake. And the waitress rudely responded with ""it will be one moment,"" never stopping, and kept walking by. Needless to say my friend never got her box, and finally had to ask another waitress for it. We left with mixed feelings. The food was good except for that awful water, but the service was terrible. The waitresses are all rude and stuck up and do not engage with the customers at all. I will be sticking to the one in Hillsdale."
Jayson D.,"Moraga, United States",231,16,8,1.0,20/1/2015,"Ordered two drinks, stuffed mushroom, Louisiana pasta and Katsu chicken. Stressed to our server we wanted the stuffed mushrooms before our meal. after our order was taken we never saw our server ever again. Food runners brought our drinks, food and appetizer 15min after our entrees. No table check back no nothing.  Also another server  was breaking ours and she introduced him to about two tables on the patio. Never introduced him to us or nothing. Her breaker never table touched ours til 15min after we finished. Where's corporate? How do these reviews go unchecked? Honestly."
Katie V.,"San Francisco, United States",43,132,44,2.0,30/9/2014,"We all knew it was gonna be a mediocre time. We all knew it, but when you one day decide you want Cheesecake Factory anyway and go and find it's a 2-3 hour wait, and then try to come back again and it's the same thing, and again in a different location and it's the same deal...well, it becomes kind of a ""Challenge Accepted"" kinda situation. Different time?? Nope. Different day?? Nope. After the busy season is over (AND before regular dinner hours)?? YES. Finally. Shortest wait ever, just 45 minutes after arriving a Saturday evening around 4:45. We were seated by 6pm (a little longer than 45 minutes but hey, less than 2-3 hours!). Service was terrible for a place that should know how to handle crowds. There was a period where there were a ton of empty tables around us, and yet our server was nowhere to be seen. They forgot our appetizer and took about an hour to bring us our food. I ordered a skinny drink and thought it wasn't what I asked for, but she had said it was so didn't question it...later, looking at the check, she'd given me the wrong drink. Oh, and finally, I love cheesecake and I love carrot cake. There was an item called ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake"" on the menu, and I thought it was just exactly what it said: a carrot cake CHEESEcake. Nope. It was a carrot cake with cream cheese filling, like any regular cake, and usually I'd appreciate that, but NOT WHEN I WANT CHEESEcake. Maybe I should have asked, but it was in the cheesecake section. How hard could it be to call it ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake"" instead of ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake""? Oh well. It was a pretty standard, 5/10 carrot cake anyway. But if I wanted carrot cake, I'd definitely have gone somewhere else. Oh yeah, and the food that we did get was ok. My boyfriend got the orange chicken and it tasted about half as good as the kind you can get at Trader Joe's. I got a turkey burger and it tasted a little less dry than cardboard (I wanted to ask for ketchup but our server disappeared again). But our friend ordered a pizza that looked pretty good! Annoyances aside, it was what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory, I guess. Now I remember why I never go."
Gem B.,"San Francisco, United States",21,44,14,1.0,5/5/2015,"Crowded, long wait times, and not kid friendly. The cheesecake tasted great. I did get food poisoning after eating there. I've eaten there twice and ordered to-go twice and each time was a horrible experience, I will never eat there again."
Noah W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,4.0,14/11/2016,"The quality of the food is good, so as the services. It would had been five star if it wasn't for the prolong waiting...luckily there are so many places for shopping nearby to distract my empty stomach. Lol"
Rebecca F.,"Silver Spring, United States",12,82,142,1.0,12/4/2015,"I was so looking forward to trying the southwestern chicken sandwich since it had jalapeños and avocado (2 of my favorite foods). It tasted yummy! Luckily I looked down at the sandwich and realized I bit into RAW CHICKEN! I immediately stopped eating it and told the waiter. He volunteered to bring me another one. The manager came by our table, introduced herself, and apologized for the raw chicken. She asked if I wanted anything in the meantime. I ordered a salad with ranch dressing (just some lettuce no other veggies smothered in dressing).   When the sandwich finally arrived, I tried to enjoy it but kept analyzing it to verify it was cooked. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy eating it as much as I thought I would.  When the bill came I was astonished that I was charged for the sandwich! In all oft years of dining out, whenever the kitchen made an error the item was complimentary! I won't be dining there again while in San Francisco! The management definitely needs a lesson in good customer service!"

We ordered the tuna tartare (yum!), the spicy jambalaya pasta and banana cheesecake. DO NOT get the jambalaya pasta here, idk my boyfriend was raving about it but even he said that it wasn't very good at this location. The noodles were over cooked, the chicken had zero flavor and contrary to its name, it is not even remotely pasta.  I really did enjoy the banana cheesecake though. I am glad they got their desserts down since the place is called the Cheesecake factory :)."

Elaine Y.,"San Francisco, CA",32,69,497,2.0,10/19/2014,"Waited over 2 hours for a table on a Saturday evening!!! Well, it wasn't my idea to dine here :,( Food was ok Service was terrible Wait was ridiculous  What we ordered for a party of 2 plus take out: 1.Skinnilicious Factory chopped salad 4/5  (Decent portion, reasonable price and low calorie)  2. Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane combo with a side order of broccoli  1/5 (3 large size breaded shrimp, 3 scoop of mashed potatoes and 3-4 small pieces of steak) I like my steak medium cooked, it came out well-done so I sent it back! It yoked about 40 minutes for it to come out again so we ended up pack it for to go. The side of broccoli took that long also. Unbelievable! 3. Meatloaf 2/5 4. Shrimp and chicken gumbo 2/5  5. Tiramisu Cheesecake 4/5 6. Blueberries White Chocolate Cheesecake 3/5 Worst experience ever!"
Jenny T.,"Hayward, CA",350,671,1794,3.0,8/29/2013,"You know what?!  Its not really a factory, its a restaurant, however, it's like the busiest restaurant EVER!! Its so packed that many people end up sitting one level down at Macy's furniture deptartment.  They sit on plush couches like its their right to do it.  Is it though?!  I think Macy's should charge Cheesecake Factory couch rental fees.  I think it's rude! Ayway...Let's talk about the meal! Always good and consistent.  I ordered a rib eye steak with French fries.  My friend ordered the jambalaya pasta.  And we both shared the banana cream cheesecake.  All dishes are great and we thoroughly enjoyed the free bread with butter.   Service is good.  We got there at 5:30pm and waited 5 minutes for a seat.  And dinner was served promptly.  Good times..."
Lauren L.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,9,3,2.0,8/5/2015,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and usually go to the Hillsdale one. I was in San Francisco with my friends today and we decided to try the one here. Problem number one: the wait. It was a Tuesday morning-afternoon so you'd think it wouldn't be so busy, well it was so we had a wait time of 15 minutes. As soon as our buzzer went off, we were told to standby and wait for our waitress to take us to our seat, which lasted about ten minutes. I was confused at this point; why have the buzzer go off only to have us wait even longer? I went up to the desk to ask what we were supposed to be doing, and the girl rudely responded with ""we have a lot of tickets."" I don't know what that means but she could have handled my simple question much more professionally and kindly.  After more minutes of idly standing around, we were finally taken to our seat. Note that there are three people in our party, yet our table only had plates and silverware for two people. I failed to realize this until near the end though, and apparently our waitress never realized it either, even when serving our bread.  My friend had a couple of dollars in quarters that she needed to exchange for some dollars, so when she asked the waitress if she could, the waitress responded quickly with ""you gotta do that at the bakery,"" before she quickly disappeared again. She left my friend confused, we didn't know where the ""bakery"" was since the whole restaurant looked like a bakery.  Next comes ordering. Ordering was fine and our food was good. One of my friends and I got a new batch of water from the waitress, and immediately noticed something was off. Our water was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like tap water mixed with blood, and contained no ice. We asked for a new cup of water, and this time it tasted better, but still had no ice. Next came ordering the cheesecake. I first asked if they were serving the Peppermint Bark one, since our buzzer said ""Peppermint Bark cheesecake is back!"" The waitress responded curtly with ""that's only in the winter."" Feeling a bit disappointed and confused since the peppermint bark flavor was advertised but yet not available, I went with another flavor. Our waitress did not write down what we ordered and memorized it instead. When she brought over our cake, she didn't say a word the whole time and gave each of us our wrong cheesecake. She could have at least asked us who had what instead of slamming them down at our table and have us do the hassle of rearranging of who had what. My friend asked another waitress if she could get a to-go box for the rest of her cake. And the waitress rudely responded with ""it will be one moment,"" never stopping, and kept walking by. Needless to say my friend never got her box, and finally had to ask another waitress for it. We left with mixed feelings. The food was good except for that awful water, but the service was terrible. The waitresses are all rude and stuck up and do not engage with the customers at all. I will be sticking to the one in Hillsdale."
Jayson D.,"Moraga, CA",231,16,8,1.0,1/20/2015,"Ordered two drinks, stuffed mushroom, Louisiana pasta and Katsu chicken. Stressed to our server we wanted the stuffed mushrooms before our meal. after our order was taken we never saw our server ever again. Food runners brought our drinks, food and appetizer 15min after our entrees. No table check back no nothing.  Also another server  was breaking ours and she introduced him to about two tables on the patio. Never introduced him to us or nothing. Her breaker never table touched ours til 15min after we finished. Where's corporate? How do these reviews go unchecked? Honestly."
Katie V.,"San Francisco, CA",43,132,44,2.0,9/30/2014,"We all knew it was gonna be a mediocre time. We all knew it, but when you one day decide you want Cheesecake Factory anyway and go and find it's a 2-3 hour wait, and then try to come back again and it's the same thing, and again in a different location and it's the same deal...well, it becomes kind of a ""Challenge Accepted"" kinda situation. Different time?? Nope. Different day?? Nope. After the busy season is over (AND before regular dinner hours)?? YES. Finally. Shortest wait ever, just 45 minutes after arriving a Saturday evening around 4:45. We were seated by 6pm (a little longer than 45 minutes but hey, less than 2-3 hours!). Service was terrible for a place that should know how to handle crowds. There was a period where there were a ton of empty tables around us, and yet our server was nowhere to be seen. They forgot our appetizer and took about an hour to bring us our food. I ordered a skinny drink and thought it wasn't what I asked for, but she had said it was so didn't question it...later, looking at the check, she'd given me the wrong drink. Oh, and finally, I love cheesecake and I love carrot cake. There was an item called ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake"" on the menu, and I thought it was just exactly what it said: a carrot cake CHEESEcake. Nope. It was a carrot cake with cream cheese filling, like any regular cake, and usually I'd appreciate that, but NOT WHEN I WANT CHEESEcake. Maybe I should have asked, but it was in the cheesecake section. How hard could it be to call it ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake"" instead of ""Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake""? Oh well. It was a pretty standard, 5/10 carrot cake anyway. But if I wanted carrot cake, I'd definitely have gone somewhere else. Oh yeah, and the food that we did get was ok. My boyfriend got the orange chicken and it tasted about half as good as the kind you can get at Trader Joe's. I got a turkey burger and it tasted a little less dry than cardboard (I wanted to ask for ketchup but our server disappeared again). But our friend ordered a pizza that looked pretty good! Annoyances aside, it was what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory, I guess. Now I remember why I never go."
Gem B.,"San Francisco, CA",21,44,14,1.0,5/5/2015,"Crowded, long wait times, and not kid friendly. The cheesecake tasted great. I did get food poisoning after eating there. I've eaten there twice and ordered to-go twice and each time was a horrible experience, I will never eat there again."
Noah W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,4.0,11/14/2016,"The quality of the food is good, so as the services. It would had been five star if it wasn't for the prolong waiting...luckily there are so many places for shopping nearby to distract my empty stomach. Lol"
Rebecca F.,"Silver Spring, MD",12,82,142,1.0,4/12/2015,"I was so looking forward to trying the southwestern chicken sandwich since it had jalapeños and avocado (2 of my favorite foods). It tasted yummy! Luckily I looked down at the sandwich and realized I bit into RAW CHICKEN! I immediately stopped eating it and told the waiter. He volunteered to bring me another one. The manager came by our table, introduced herself, and apologized for the raw chicken. She asked if I wanted anything in the meantime. I ordered a salad with ranch dressing (just some lettuce no other veggies smothered in dressing).   When the sandwich finally arrived, I tried to enjoy it but kept analyzing it to verify it was cooked. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy eating it as much as I thought I would.  When the bill came I was astonished that I was charged for the sandwich! In all oft years of dining out, whenever the kitchen made an error the item was complimentary! I won't be dining there again while in San Francisco! The management definitely needs a lesson in good customer service!"
