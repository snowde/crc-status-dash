Lisa H.,"San Francisco, United States",31,36,31,1.0,19/12/2014,"The problem with this place isn't that the food is expensive, or that I might have to wait a long time to be seated. The real problem is their customer service.  Waiting to be seated could take some time, and I definitely understand that there is a high volume of people who wish to eat there as well. A pretty simple and reasonable suggestion would be to tell a guest exactly how long it'll be until they will be seated. It's frustrating when they say it'll be an hour....then you go back to them and they say it's another 30 minutes....and then you go back and they say it's another 30 minutes. If they told people how long the wait would be, then no ones time would be wasted.  And then they think it's absolutely barbaric that a person would get mad about waiting that long. WTF. Maybe I wouldn't have been as upset if you told me the exact amount of time it would take for me to be seated in the first place. I wouldn't have wasted my time if they gave me the common courtesy of being honest. Instead they just drag you along by getting your hopes up by thinking you're close to being seated. Get it together.  The only good thing about this place is the free bread. That is all."
Wanda M.,"Daly City, United States",228,147,59,4.0,8/4/2014,"I came here to celebrate a mini-reunion with my graduating class from high school. We came during the holiday season so it was quite busy. Since they don't take reservations, and we planned to get together around 6pm, one friend and I showed up extra early around 4pm to reserve a table for 10 people. We told them that this was for our reunion. We were pretty disappointed we couldn't all sit together, we were placed at two table, one behind the other, and we couldn't talk or see the other table. We saw a bunch of vacant tables that sat 4, right next to each other. We would've needed three, but the host didn't listen to our request. It was a bit disappointing, but we were going to make the best of it. Six of us squeeze into one table, the remaining four sat behind us.  Our waiter was awesome!! I wish I caught his name. He was really friendly and funny and gave good recommendations.  I [think] i ordered the louisiana pasta (or something like that). It was really yummy and full of flavor. The portion was pretty big so I took what I couldn't finish home. I also ordered the Asian Pear Martini and it sure packed a punch :). The others all enjoyed their food as well. So even though we didn't all sit together, we still had a great experience. We might have our next reunion here but we will be very persistent about sitting together."
Gary N.,"Chattanooga, United States",3299,650,2151,3.0,20/4/2012,"Beautiful location. Sat outside on a nice night with heat lamps. Great view.  5 Stars for location and view.  But!!! Service was poor at best. Ordered a drink and waited about 20 minutes, 10 minutes for a refill.  This was late so it was not packed so no reason to be this poor."
Mokhi S.,"San Francisco, United States",10,12,,1.0,24/9/2016,"Waited over 30 min to be seated outside on a Friday/lunch time. After we got seated we felt a little bit sweating because sun was shining right over our table. We asked server and host to be moved to table near us since it was open it was more on a shadow side. Server told us politely that somebody did request shade. Ok totally understand. Host was rude saying NO can't do that. Okay I get it, I thought we should have requested shade and went back to my table. Those open tables weren't seated for next 20 min or so. After I got rejected on moving family in front of us were seating on sunny side too and when they asked to be moved they had no problems with that. I felt discrimination against us so I asked for manager. Manager Jason came over our table. We told the situation that was going on there. He did apologize and moved us immediately which was nice but we still had that bad feeling. He told us that he would buy a dessert but he never did (which we didn't even ask server why they include it on the bill) It is not about what they want to give for free after they screwed up more on customer service side. You guys have to play your game on the restaurant floor better and respect every customer. I used to love coming to this cheesecake factory because it's location, view, food. But after what happened to us I felt unwelcome. Not going back."
Nicholas F.,"Roseville, United States",205,39,,5.0,18/12/2014,After a long workout my friend and I were very hungry and decided to walk to Chipotle but last minute cravings switched our plan to the Cheesecake Factory and let me tell you it was the best decision of the day. We arrived to the sixth floor wonderland of goodness to a disappointing twenty minute wait but were immediately informed of the bar seating option and since it was open seating we just sat there.  From the moment we sat down we were offered amazing service from the female bartender Ashwani. She brought us a sample of the delightful corn chowder and from then on gave us samples of almost every drink she was making. She was pleasant and served is fast with attention to detail. It may not be the classiest of restaurants but Ashwani made it the best dining service I've experienced in SF since I moved here two years ago.  We will be back!  PS. The chicken Balagio is tasty but serve a little less pesto noodles is all I have to say.
Norma M.,"Hayward, United States",0,7,5,1.0,30/4/2016,This was my first time in  this restaurant food was good and dessert was great as well but customer service was horrible the server treat us really bad and it was irresponsible left for he's break and don't even bother to let other people know about I feel discriminated and insulted for the action and treatment I received in this location I will not recommend this place to anyone unless if you want to feel been judge and want to receive bad treatment
Kaylin C.,"Wailuku, United States",118,87,178,3.0,21/2/2015,"Food is very good. Service is good as well. Nothing too wonderful. It's a place to try but nothing wonderful. The best part is that there are SO MANY menu options. And the view is awesome on the outside top floor patio, go early. There can be a long wait"
Monsour R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,,5.0,10/5/2016,I love this place ambiance and location. The best Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Take your date here. A must
Malina B.,"Stockton, United States",6,48,57,5.0,23/1/2016,"Yea, this is a touristy place, but I absolutely loved it here! You get a beautiful view of San Fransisco, the waitress I had was very accommodating, and the menu has the hugest selection..it doesn't stop there. We ordered the factory nachos for an appetizer. Wow, I was impressed, not only because the tortilla chips were the homemade kind, but it was a huge portion! Enough for a family of 6 or 7. Then we got our entrees and I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which came with a side of pesto pasta. Man, this was delicious and the portion was huge. I really recommend you try it. It's a very succulent dish, that will not disappoint. For dessert we ordered the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake and it was by far the best cheesecake I've ever tasted! It's made with a layer of lady fingers so it's lighter then your average cheesecake, so you won't be sick after the first 2 bites. (I usually hate cheesecake because it's a bit too rich for my liking). Anyways, I think for how busy this place was , the chefs , and waiters worked as fast as they could to make us happy. I had a wonderful experience !"
Cat A.,"Los Angeles, United States",94,29,,2.0,11/10/2016,"As a loyal costumer and fan of cheescake factory I think yesterday's lunch was pretty disappointing. We order the white chicken chili and they brought another completely diferent dish, we tell the our server and they bring another wrong dish! After 3 times we finally got our chilli! Also, we order another dish with a side of mushed potatoes and they weren't even mushed! It was like a huge entire and hard potato in there. So sad to leave this kinda review in one of my favorite places"
Kelly G.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,13,1,5.0,27/4/2016,Tried the gluten-free chocolate cheesecake and it was very yummy and decadent. Was able to substitute ice-cream for the cream.
Brenda C.,"Berkeley, United States",0,59,11,5.0,17/3/2016,"I hadn't been here in YEARS..and forgot about the overly large portions they serve, so we will have leftovers for a couple days.  I had the grilled fish tacos with a wonderful. Cilantro rice and black beans.  My granddaughter had the fetticine.  The 5 stars were worth it!  We waited about 15-20 min to be seated and after seated we were promptly services and received our orders. Food tasted --well--- like typical restaurant chai food and it was served and presented with perfection.  Having dinner at The Cheesecake Factory was great and unexpected.  Having a fun dinner with my granddaughter while she's here in Spring Break ---well of course---it was priceless."
Cath M.,"San Francisco, United States",319,1086,1075,4.0,15/6/2013,"**TAKE-OUT ONLY** Came here this past Wednesday night to get desserts... just making it time before they closed. Service was prompt even though I could see the eyes of the employees that they were all tired...  * Pineapple Upside cheesecake  * Godiva Chocolate cheesecake * Original cheesecake My favorite of the three was the original! I know, I was shocked myself. I think I was just overwhelmed with the sweetness of the other two. The original was creamy and was just right. I dreaded the gym the next day but... here's to living aloha!"
Evie B.,"Livonia, United States",202,407,51,4.0,1/8/2013,"Typically I do not like chain restaurants - usually mediocre food at inflated prices BUT this place was very enjoyable. Got there early enough so that we didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes. Our waiter was a little cool at first, but quickly warmed up- engaging and friendly- quick. Pacing of food was good. I hate when you order multiple courses and they come all at once- but they kept a nice pace. Chicken taquitos were yummy- served hot and flavorable. Caesar salad- fresh, crisp, but lacking in dressing- request extra dressing on side- also ask for small dinner Caesar which isn't listed on the menu. Shrimp platter- hot- fresh and abundant! Cooked to perfection. Served with fries and coleslaw( not just a tbsp). All good Chicken piccata - yummy- 2-3 thin seasoned slices of chicken- yummy piccata sauce, served with noodles- little over cooked and dried out. Chicken Madeira - yummy yummy sauce, thin slices of chicken, served with mashed potato- dry. Cheesecake slices/ ohhhhhh myyyyyy goooooodness! Freaking delish! Huge huge slices. We had to get them to go and eat 3 hours later! Lol The prices are steep... 3-4$ higher than what they should be..I think each dish avg. $18... Which didn't inc. the option of soup or salad. Maybe these were SF prices (as all restaurants in that area were steep $) I hear they are opening one in novi mi... I hope so!"
Terrance B.,"San Diego, United States",10,6,1,2.0,4/5/2016,"After being in Hawaii and experiencing their restaurant. Quality isn't the same here. The food does not taste as good, we ate the chicken Breast littles and they were so dark they were almost burnt and they were dry. We also had the farfalle which is my favourite and it was dry and not very flavour full.  We ordered two Long Island iced teas each and my partner who gets tipsy on baily's couldn't feel anything. They were making very weak drinks and ripping us off. They were terrible drinks. DONT TRUST THE DRINKS! The Oreo cheesecake was amazing."
Esther J.,"Carrollton, United States",0,6,1,1.0,1/8/2015,"First off the wait was ridiculous. We waited over the quote time (1 hr 20 min) about 20 minutes.  Second the food quality was awful. We had the Louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken was way too salty and the pasta was a bit undercooked. We also had the shrimp scampi with steak diane. The steak was not cooked well at all - it was not steak. We're from Texas we know our steaks. We called the manager over he just said that sirloins are supposed to be chewy but there's no way that was steak. Sirloin my ass.  However, the waiters and waitresses are nice and the bread is great as always."
Luka V.,"Phoenix, United States",0,2,,1.0,6/10/2016,"Terrible service, took for ever to sit down and then watched everyone get their orders in before us. All we heard were excuses that didn't make sense."
Michael Vincent R.,"San Francisco, United States",10,6,,1.0,15/10/2015,"Just want to thank the lady at the concierge for being the most inefficient host I've encountered. You sassily told us wait time for two tops was ""just 15 minutes"". 45 minutes later, I snagged a table at the bar section. Left an hour and a half after finishing a plate of pasta and a few slices of pizzas. The whole time we were there, you, being the most clueless, attitude-ridden host that you are, never bothered to check up on us. You completely forgot about us, yes, the two guests who could've handed you gratuity for seating us on time. Maybe try another line of work."
Kiyla W.,"Oakdale, United States",0,2,,1.0,21/4/2016,"So to start off our server was very rude and looked as if he was high he didn't even offer bread or water to start off we actually had to ask him we place our order and the wait begins . . .  Ten minutes after being there the fire alarm goes off and they evacuate the building (which we had to walk down eight flights of stairs) we get outside upset because this is our favorite location and we were actually looking forward to the meal , so we decide to wait around for a while to see what's going on and if and when they will let guest back in so fifteen minutes later they finally give the okay for people to go back in.  We get back in the building and get back to our table and it's like we are not even there so I flag a waiter down and he says "" Oh umm il get someone to come help you ""  our server comes back and says "" Oh hey yeah il put your order in again and have your food out "" and then he literally walks away ! Not offering fresh drinks or anything ! By this time I was pissed off and ready to get up and leave.  Fifteen minutes later our food comes out green beans are cold Philly cheesesteak bread is hard and burnt in the inside i ask our server if I can speak to the manager she comes over rude as ever and asks "" what's the problem guys "" we tell her we are very unhappy with the food and if we will be accommodated in any way she says "" sure would you like another side for the green beans ? "" not even mentioning the cheesesteak we say no we just want our bill. Our bill comes out and 2 of us 4 decide to go use the restroom as we are walking there we are being followed as if they thought we were going to ditch the bill we return to the table another manager is standing a few steps away and is just lingering around we put the bill on the table and start to walk out and the manager that was standing around runs over and grabs the bill off of the table and immediately opens it after he realizes we paid the entire thing he has a stupid look on his face.  Like i said before this WAS our favorite location we won't be going back there ever !"
