Gilbert C.,"Los Angeles, United States",32,18,15,4.0,14/8/2015,When we got to the restaurant there was an hours wait for a table. We opted to wait and share a table in the bar and were served and out of there is under the hour. Food choices are vast and size is big as well so we opted to share a dinner between the two of us. Same for the dessert and we were both full so good choice.
Anna P.,"Los Angeles, United States",233,473,1191,4.0,21/2/2014,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory. This place does get a little bit crowded, but hey, it's the location :) They have outside seating, overlooking SF from a rooftop :) Food-wise, you'll get exactly what you'll get in any other Cheesecake Factory."
Joshua W.,"Beaverton, United States",44,36,244,3.0,5/5/2015,"The location and view is what makes this place. Everything else is typical CF though. Good food, drinks and cheesecake obviously. If you don't want to venture out into the city for new food experiences, this is a good place. Can't beat Anchor Steam on tap, but we are in SF."
Janice C.,"San Francisco, United States",253,72,1962,5.0,4/4/2013,"This is probably the only restaurant chain that is Yelp worthy.  No other restaurant chain can compare to The Cheesecake Factory. I've dined at many Cheesecake Factory locations over 15 years and this location is by far my favorite.  It's located on the 8th floor of the Macy's building in Union Square.  You can dine outside (they've got heaters out there for cold nights) & see great views of union square.  I especially like dining here during the Christmas season where you can see the Christmas tree and people ice skating below. A lot of people complain that this place is too busy & there's a long wait but there's a reason for that...it's that good!!!  If you don't want to wait come during off-peaks hours (late night), find a seat at the bar, or take your order to go.   Once you're seated you get to enjoy fresh baked loaves of wheat & sourdough bread served with a side of butter. Their entire menu selection is large.  That's what I love about this place.  You'll never get bored of their menu.  There's so many items I want to try but have not had the chance to.  Their portion sizes are huge and their prices are very reasonable. My menu favorites: Appetizers:   Thai lettuce wraps-this could be a meal of its own because the portions are large.  Large slices of chicken satay served with veggies, coconut curry noodles, & 3 delicious dipping sauces - peanut, sweet red chili, & tamarind cashew. Fire cracker salmon rolls-spinach & crispy wrapped salmon served with sweet chili sauce.  definitely a must-try. Entree: Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta-my all time favorite!  Chicken n shrimp spiced with cajun seasoning, onions, tomato, n peppers served over pasta.  This can also be served over rice but I love their regular & spinach pasta.  Save some leftovers cuz it's even more amazing the next day! Dessert: They've got a huge cheesecake selection as well as other desserts. I like the fresh strawberry & the white chocolate caramel macadamia but cheesecakes. Drinks: Their bar does not disappoint!  Their bartenders are definitely stingy with their alcohol!  I can never finish a single cocktail because the alcohol definitely will get to me.  I like their specialty drink -Factory peach Bellini (champagne, peach, n peach liquer). They offer a special complimentary dessert for any bday celebrants :) There's so much more The Cheesecake Factory has to offer that my review can't justify.  Go visit one today!!!"
Ras U.,"Paris, France",271,184,225,4.0,18/3/2016,I would eat here all the time I would only get one thing the four cheese pasta with no chicken and no basil. Every time I would get a four cheese pasta with chicken and basil. I went here on Valentines day and I ordered my pasta as usual and the mistake was made again. They took it back and gave me new one. I ate about 70% of the food and found a piece of chicken in the pasta. My meal was comped and they gave us a cheesecake but I rather pay and get the right meal.
Christopher K.,"Alameda, United States",5,53,,2.0,24/8/2016,"I am baffled by this place. Our 13-year-old daughter was keen on going here at the end of a family day out. I'd only heard its name as one more chain and had never thought of going there, but we agreed to try it out. My first impression: crowded, noisy and lame pop music. Waited for a table; the place is unpleasant to be in--really uncomfortably crowded--but we found a good spot on the outside balcony to wait. Nice view (the only real thing this place has going for it). We were lucky enough to be seated outside which was good (except probably for my wife--she was sitting next to a glass wall, with another table on the other side and placed in such a way that she was practically staring another patron in the face from inches away. They should move one of those tables.) It was cool, foggy and breezy outside, but the heat lamps did nicely. When I saw how surprisingly high the prices were, I hoped that it was better than my first impressions had suggested.... I had gumbo, a caesar salad with chicken for the daughter, salmon for my wife and pizza for our son. My wife got a substitution for the potatoes on the salmon plate, but it arrived with potatoes, but missing broccoli. Waiter replaced it. Caesar salad with chicken arrived with no chicken. Waiter fixed it. Wife said salmon was very good. Daughter said some of the chicken was OK, some was way too chewy. My gumbo was OK, but nothing special at all. Probably a little better than a Chili's or similar chain, but completely forgettable, and at a price twice what it was worth. We had some cheesecake, cheesecake and strawberry shortcake. They were all OK. Not memorable at all however.  Dessert made me thirsty, but waiter forgot to fill my water until asked a second time. At the end, we paid at least 50% higher than the food was worth (even for SF), and for marginal service. The really baffling thing is this: The place was packed, with a never-ending stream of people lining up to come in. It was really crowded (and this is late-ish on a Wednesday evening, not a weekend). And many of them looked really psyched to be there. Why? My wife said that most were tourists. But what are they doing here? What made them fly across the country to this city, and walk into a Macys and go up seven floors in an over-crowded elevator for this? Everyone has similar chains back home, right? I'm still shaking my head. Man, i once found a great little falafel place not far from there, got a great lunch special with wonderful lentil soup, etc, for almost nothing. Cost 1/4 the price and twice as good. I wish I could find it again...."
Suz V.,"Myrtle Beach, United States",0,13,20,2.0,12/4/2016,"30 minute wait anytime you come. Plate was very hot, food was cold?!  Daughter ordered pork chop. Served on top of baked apples. Pork chop absorbed apple flavor, which is nasty, and tough to cut through.  Was it worth the 30 minute wait, heck no! I'm definitely ordering something different, if I return. NOT IMPRESSED! The reason there is a wait is because staff is not attentive. Ordered cheese cake for dessert. It took around 30 minutes to get it?! Took 30 minutes to bring our meal.  They are in no hurry to get you served and on your way, so waiting guests can eat."
Jay R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Came here with my friend at 4 pm before the dinner rush and they weren't that busy. It took them 10 mins to come to our table to take an order and then when we asked for bread it took another 15 mins to get and it was cold. We ordered a salad with dressing on the side and they didn't bring the dressing until we asked 2 times for it and sat waiting to eat our food for another 10 mins. The chicken in our salad was super dry and chewy, like it came out of a bag and straight in the microwave. Terrible service and it wasn't even busy. Not coming back to this one."
Annie S.,"San Francisco, United States",1189,541,490,4.0,20/5/2011,"Pros: - The view outside... SOOO. PRETTY. ASJFDLKASJLKFW. Especially at night during the holidays when the huge tree and ice rink are set up at Union Square. - The complimentary bread!! It's so good... I shamelessly ask for 234234 refills... heh  - All the different kinds of food on the menu - Large portions - Four Cheese Pasta (my favorite there-especially because I like cheese) - Red Velvet Cheesecake Con: - No reservations. The wait SUCKS. A LOT. My friends tried to throw me a surprise birthday dinner here one time... but long story short, the hours of waiting threw off plans and killed the surprise because they couldn't distract me for that long lol. I guess the wait is not so bad if you go downstairs and chill on one of the sofas at Macy's furniture section, but I don't think the Macy's employees like that."
Tiffany T.,"Los Angeles, United States",81,52,11,1.0,2/8/2014,"Cheesecake Factory needs to get an operations team stat. This is by far the most inefficient restaurant I've ever seen. I went around 9pm to pick up a slice of cheesecake to go and came out at 10pm.  The issues in short: -The escalator gate from the 7th floor of Macys to Cheesecake is closed, leaving a 5-10 minute wait just to get on the elevator to and from the restaurant.  -No organization whatsoever. There is no system here. -They ring up 100 people at the to-go line and no cheesecakes come out for 15 minutes. They then prepare the cheesecakes all at one time and get confused on who ordered what. You have to go up to them and point out what cheesecakes you ordered. I could have stolen all the cheesecakes and they wouldn't even know.  Bottom line is you should never come here if you're hungry. By the time you eat you won't be hungry anymore."
Dr ED M.,"San Diego, United States",1144,197,655,1.0,18/9/2014,If i can give them a zero i would..service is so bad i sat on butter then i stepped in butter...i dont care where it is...no one came to clean...when i asked them to re clean it i had to get the manager to show him where it was because they were just whipping stuff and not picking up stuff...i appreciate the manager doing it himself but after i sat down for some reason i touched the bottom of the table top and all was butter....so i asked to seated somewhere else. It sucks but thats what happen...our food was ok but our new server and her service was excellent...i have them a one star because it took them 38 mins to fix this problem...when it could have take 5 mins just asking for someone to take the time to clean how hard is that...i know its SF but i am not that open minded!
Teresa V.,"Lakewood, United States",0,5,2,1.0,9/4/2016,"I took the time to Yelp my experience so take it into consideration. Avoid this place like the plague. Horrible unnecessary customer service from Raven (greeter) experience from start to finish. As I sit inside the restaurant currently waiting for my uncooked steak Diane...... I'm appalled at the way this place is ran. Managers walk around with no direction, they avoid eye contact and have no care about the customer nor their experience. There is No process, unprofessional and not worth my time or money. As a paying customer. Assuming all of you would too. Take your business elsewhere. I will never come back."
Kasey K.,"Santa Rosa, United States",20,28,10,1.0,15/2/2015,"Horrible! Started with the rude hostesses. I can appreciate being stressed that your computer just shut down but don't be rude or impatient to customers. Our waiter was Austin S. I had asked his recommendation between 2 different cheesecakes as we only came her for dessert and drinks. I went with his recommendation of the pineapple upside-down cheesecake over my first choice and was INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED. I said I wanted to change to the other flavor and he accommodated, only to charge me for both. On top of that he dropped the check and ran. You're not busy atm... There goes your tip dude."
Matthew S.,"Malibu, United States",0,4,,1.0,2/12/2015,Tried ordering take out 3x. Was placed on hold for over 10 mins each time. Finally gave up. Ridiculously poor level of service.
Devika B.,"San Francisco, United States",268,54,125,5.0,25/11/2015,"Everyone loves Cheesecake Factory, it's a classic and has yummy food and dessert. Somethings you'll want to know about this location.  -It's located in the Macy's on the top floor by Union Square hence the traffic here is crazy. Usually no matter when you go you'll be looking at a line to wait so be prepared. I would recommend calling ahead a day or two if you know you want to go here, but even then there is usually a wait time. I've waited before almost 90 minutes since I went on the weekend at dinner time.  -There are two methods to get up to Cheesecake, either you can take the elevator at the Union Square entrance of Macy's or you can take the escalator all the way to the top floor where it is located if Macy's is open. -If you don't feel like waiting, order to go. On one side of the factory they have a cheesecake section where you can order to go orders which is nice because if you don't feel like waiting 90 minutes to sit down and then 15-20 minutes to get your order you can eliminate one waiting time. I have gotten a to-go order in less than 30 minutes. If you do to-go, ask for bread... You won't regret it. This location is amazing, especially since you overlook Union Square so it's very pleasurable experience to go and enjoy good food with food views."
alexandria s.,"San Francisco, United States",5,42,,5.0,29/8/2016,"I received incredible service on a busy Sunday morning. I went and there were a lot of people, but they were very efficient. I checked in with them and to my amazement, I only waited 5 minutes for my table. My server were very nice and attentive to my needs. I cannot believe how fast they had brought my food out and I did not have to wait long to pay.  It was a overall wonderful dining experience."
Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, United States",304,1561,73,2.0,12/6/2013,"It's not every day that I needed to burn some time before an event and I had HOURS to burn...not just a few minutes.  And the place I needed to go was in Union Square so I needed to stay well around here.  On a Saturday afternoon.  I couldn't even script any higher degree of difficulty than that.  So around 4pm, I attempt to find an empty seat at the bar of this insanely busy restaurant, thinking, ""No Way That It Should Be Busy at 4pm...Who Eats At 4pm?""  Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with my logic and well there was a huge wait for tables...the bar was full...the seats in the waiting area were full...the standing room in the waiting area was full...and every ten minutes...there's an employee there who kept his eye on the menus that were being looked over in the waiting area!    I think I can enjoy going the Cheesecake Factory in general IF there was a way that I could be seated without waiting, not required to talk in elevated voices during the meal, and  not be rushed to leave the table when the server leaves the check at the table...(hint hint we want you to leave so we can sit a few of the HUNDREDS of people who are waiting for a seat). So honestly, I don't see that situation happening.  Mind you, I am a fan of their food and I'm not a hater of the portion sizes and love their cheesecake flavors too.   But I value my dining experience more and the food is not worth the fight to get a table here."
Ry V.,"Pacifica, United States",3,17,11,1.0,7/2/2016,"Went here last night to enjoy a nice meal and a nice night in the city with the super bowl in town. Was saddened by the normally nice restaurant because the lack of cleanliness. The normal 45 min wait is fine but the bar was a mess with glasses and plates left all over. The restroom had graffiti painted on the walls scratched into the mirrors. I asked the manager and she said oh its been like that for a day or two. This is normally a nice place to eat. How do you not care to get it cleaned up or to apologize? I was embarrassed for her and the owners of this so called ""fine dining"". I'm a regular coustum but feel I will never feel the same when going here. I will question going here the next time. Very sad."
Bernie C.,"San Francisco, United States",10,147,,4.0,16/9/2014,"I'm so fancy, but you already know... Actually, no, I'm not.  First things first, I'm a realist!   I get it, I get why they don't take reservations, because if they did, there might as well not be any walk ins.  I get it.  However, the wait during pretty much any time of the day is pretty intense.  Peak hours, you can wait up to 1 hour and a half (depending how many folks you have).  Most of the time, if you have a small party, maybe 30 minutes or so.  It's not all that bad honestly.   I really like the ambiance of the place.  It's really nice to sit outside when it's not too windy.  Chilly is cool with me, but the wind just throws things off (literally).  For the most part, I've always had really nice staff members help us out.  The food, is what it is.  I think is pretty good food, but man the price is pretty narly.  I guess you don't really pay for the food but for the location.   I had a birthday there once, and the nice waitress gave me a free ice cream with a cool candle.  I appreciated that very much."
Helen O.,"Brooklyn, United States",225,93,140,4.0,29/8/2013,"Came here for lunch during a weekday and was seated for 2 in under 5 minutes. Great for working folks who only have an hour of lunch to spare. It was a beautiful sunny day and I would've loved to sit on the patio but because of time constraints, we opted to sit inside, which was lovely nonetheless. Our waiter was extremely nice AND helpful. Our cups of water were always full. We couldn't decide between 2 appetizers, he recommended the *vietnamese tacos*, which were AMAZING. Definitely get those when you're here. My boyfriend got the *soup and sandwich lunch special* which he said was only okay, but it was a great deal for the amount of food you get. I got the *chipotle chicken pasta* and it was really yummy. Sweet and spicy and not too much sauce. Overall, a very pleasant experience here with great food. Always a fan of their warm soft bread yummmm"

I've waited before almost 90 minutes since I went on the weekend at dinner time.  -There are two methods to get up to Cheesecake, either you can take the elevator at the Union Square entrance of Macy's or you can take the escalator all the way to the top floor where it is located if Macy's is open. -If you don't feel like waiting, order to go. On one side of the factory they have a cheesecake section where you can order to go orders which is nice because if you don't feel like waiting 90 minutes to sit down and then 15-20 minutes to get your order you can eliminate one waiting time. I have gotten a to-go order in less than 30 minutes. If you do to-go, ask for bread... You won't regret it. This location is amazing, especially since you overlook Union Square so it's very pleasurable experience to go and enjoy good food with food views."

I checked in with them and to my amazement, I only waited 5 minutes for my table. My server were very nice and attentive to my needs. I cannot believe how fast they had brought my food out and I did not have to wait long to pay.  It was a overall wonderful dining experience."
Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",304,1561,73,2.0,6/12/2013,"It's not every day that I needed to burn some time before an event and I had HOURS to burn...not just a few minutes.  And the place I needed to go was in Union Square so I needed to stay well around here.  On a Saturday afternoon.  I couldn't even script any higher degree of difficulty than that.  So around 4pm, I attempt to find an empty seat at the bar of this insanely busy restaurant, thinking, ""No Way That It Should Be Busy at 4pm...Who Eats At 4pm?""  Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with my logic and well there was a huge wait for tables...the bar was full...the seats in the waiting area were full...the standing room in the waiting area was full...and every ten minutes...there's an employee there who kept his eye on the menus that were being looked over in the waiting area!    I think I can enjoy going the Cheesecake Factory in general IF there was a way that I could be seated without waiting, not required to talk in elevated voices during the meal, and  not be rushed to leave the table when the server leaves the check at the table...(hint hint we want you to leave so we can sit a few of the HUNDREDS of people who are waiting for a seat). So honestly, I don't see that situation happening.  Mind you, I am a fan of their food and I'm not a hater of the portion sizes and love their cheesecake flavors too.   But I value my dining experience more and the food is not worth the fight to get a table here."
Ry V.,"Pacifica, CA",3,17,11,1.0,2/7/2016,"Went here last night to enjoy a nice meal and a nice night in the city with the super bowl in town. Was saddened by the normally nice restaurant because the lack of cleanliness. The normal 45 min wait is fine but the bar was a mess with glasses and plates left all over. The restroom had graffiti painted on the walls scratched into the mirrors. I asked the manager and she said oh its been like that for a day or two. This is normally a nice place to eat. How do you not care to get it cleaned up or to apologize? I was embarrassed for her and the owners of this so called ""fine dining"". I'm a regular coustum but feel I will never feel the same when going here. I will question going here the next time. Very sad."
Bernie C.,"San Francisco, CA",10,147,,4.0,9/16/2014,"I'm so fancy, but you already know... Actually, no, I'm not.  First things first, I'm a realist!   I get it, I get why they don't take reservations, because if they did, there might as well not be any walk ins.  I get it.  However, the wait during pretty much any time of the day is pretty intense.  Peak hours, you can wait up to 1 hour and a half (depending how many folks you have).  Most of the time, if you have a small party, maybe 30 minutes or so.  It's not all that bad honestly.   I really like the ambiance of the place.  It's really nice to sit outside when it's not too windy.  Chilly is cool with me, but the wind just throws things off (literally).  For the most part, I've always had really nice staff members help us out.  The food, is what it is.  I think is pretty good food, but man the price is pretty narly.  I guess you don't really pay for the food but for the location.   I had a birthday there once, and the nice waitress gave me a free ice cream with a cool candle.  I appreciated that very much."
Helen O.,"Brooklyn, NY",225,93,140,4.0,8/29/2013,"Came here for lunch during a weekday and was seated for 2 in under 5 minutes. Great for working folks who only have an hour of lunch to spare. It was a beautiful sunny day and I would've loved to sit on the patio but because of time constraints, we opted to sit inside, which was lovely nonetheless. Our waiter was extremely nice AND helpful. Our cups of water were always full. We couldn't decide between 2 appetizers, he recommended the *vietnamese tacos*, which were AMAZING. Definitely get those when you're here. My boyfriend got the *soup and sandwich lunch special* which he said was only okay, but it was a great deal for the amount of food you get. I got the *chipotle chicken pasta* and it was really yummy. Sweet and spicy and not too much sauce. Overall, a very pleasant experience here with great food. Always a fan of their warm soft bread yummmm"
