Deborah J.,"Los Angeles, United States",161,18,,1.0,17/3/2017,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory my family and I have ever dined at. Our appetizer came with our food 35 minutes later and waiters suck and don't bother checking on you. At least the manager made it somewhat better and comp'd two meals. But then when we finished our meal, the waiters still didn't bother filling up our water or do anything until I had to raise my hand a couple times. He would look at us and then continue talking to the other waiter. RUDE! At least that wasn't bad enough, as we were walking out, a waiter spilled some drinks on the floor, with many shards of glass and the drink itself spilling on my mom. None of the waiters seemed to care about her, they just were concerned with cleaning the floor. Once the manager came, he couldn't care less. They didn't bother bringing her a towel or asking her if she's okay. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I'll be contacting corporate and reporting everything that happened. Avoid this place at all cost."
Andrea G.,"San Francisco, United States",266,236,498,3.0,13/8/2013,"The other day I went to Cheesecake Factory with my sister as a part of our girl's day out. We did a little shopping in downtown SF and then decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for lunch. Even at 2:00 in the afternoon, the place was packed. So many people were waiting to be seated. Luckily, it only took about 10 minutes before a table was available. I love Cheesecake Factory. I really do. And while the food was as delicious as ever, I felt that the service was a little slow. And that's why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4. I do understand that Cheesecake Factory is always packed and busy, but even so, we had to wait awhile for our server to come ask us what we'd like to drink. And then we had to wait awhile for him to come back and ask us if we're ready to order. We waited awhile for the food to arrive. And when we were done, we had to wait awhile to get our check. And awhile more to get our change back. All the waiting aside, the food was delicious. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which was linguine pasta with a slightly spicy fresh tomato sauce. There were some red and green bell peppers and onions. The chicken and shrimp were perfectly marinated and cooked. They were tender and juicy. I especially loved that the parsley was freshly chopped and sprinkled over the dish, giving it a refreshing taste. My sister ordered the Pasta Da Vinci. That was also tasty, as usual. I have an affinity for Madeira sauce so anything with Madeira sauce is bound to be a favorite for me. I loved that the penne pasta was very flavorful. Overall, I felt that the food was delicious but because the service was especially slow, it made our visit less enjoyable."
Reenson X.,"Honolulu, United States",1,67,14,2.0,10/9/2014,"The locations is pretty cool, especially the terrace. The food is mediocre, mostly average. The staff is nice but here are some things: It was pretty cold outside and the heat-lamps were not providing enough warmth. We asked if they could turn them up a little. ""No, that's not possible."" Five minutes later, some other waiter came and turned them up. No blankets either.  My friends from abroad asked for wi-fi. Again, ""No, sorry.""  We weren't served bread whereas every other table that was seated after us got bread. ""Sorry, we are baking it fresh right now."" We ordered two Heineken. ""Sorry, we are out.""  That's a lot of ""no's"" for one night..... especially when the food is not convincing."
Colleen M.,"Hayward, United States",0,9,2,1.0,14/9/2016,"If I could put negative star I would. Besides the annoying long wait to speak to someone the management there lack customer service. I ordered through an 3rd party delivery app and placed an order for a cheesecake. Well first of all the option to order an entire cheesecake is not available. So to avoid confusion before placing an order, I called Cheescake factory directly and was told that I just need to make notions on the comments and that there would not be a problem. I place my order and when the delivery guy gets there he notices it is only 1 slice and tells her that the order is for an entire cheesecake not just a slice. She and her name is Nayelli states that the orsder does not say that he reads her the comment but she REFUSES to change it. Needless to say I end up with a delivery of 1 slice of cheesecake to the office. I call to speak with a manager ( if that what she is... because by her TERRIBLE Guarded attitude from the moment she picked up the phone I would not of thought that.) Her name is Mariyah WILKS which she made sure to spell out. Anyway I begin to explain the situation and her response is THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM deal with the third party. I continued to explain that Nayelli was the ne that refused to listen to what the delivery guy was saying, and her RESPONSE YOU WERE NOT HERE TO KNOW WHAT WAS SAID. I still continued to explain, now by this point she is not listening at all I mention to her that she is not really showing any form of customer service and that some form of apology should at least be made and she then tells me that I am being CONDESENDING and that the apology should come from the third party. TALK ABOUT RUDE!! and ghetto. After about three attempts of me asking for another manager she gives me a first name pauses and says is that all. I ask her if I could speak with him. Her response you can call in a hour or 2. then silence. I try not to always be such a prude by writing negative reviews but this was ridiculous."
Monica Z.,"Concord, United States",0,7,2,2.0,14/9/2016,The wait was kind of long about 45 minutes. Our server was really nice once we got seated. We had a nice view. Once we order the food it also took a long time to come out. When they brought the food to us my dads plate did not come out they said it would be out shortly and we waited. Then the manager came to the table and said that his order had been missed and if he wanted a salad in the meantime. So they brought out a salad and finally he gets his food as we are all pretty close to finishing up.
Rod H.,"Somerville, United States",21,11,4,3.0,9/11/2014,"Food: As tasty as you remember at your neighborhood Cheesecake Factory. The Jumbalaya Pasta dish is stupendous. Spicy, but not so spicy that your heat averse partner will not be able to tolerate a taste. The atmosphere: An exceedingly cool location propped atop the tall Macy's building in downtown SF. In the Fall/Winter you can gaze down on the ice skaters in Union Square. Reserving a table: Chaos! Send someone along early to put your name in, especially on a Saturday night. Wait times can exceed 90 minutes to 2 hours! There is virtually no place to wait around near the front desk and it is a free for all to get to the desk to even put in your reservation. Once you make it to the desk you can give them your cell number and they will text you when your table is ready."
Pamela M.,"Rohnert Park, United States",0,6,,1.0,14/11/2015,I ordered a glass of ice tea and half way through drinking it I found a black sludge stuck to the inside of the glass and on the bottom. I don't know if it was chew or half eaten food but it was gross. After talking to the manager she took the ice tea off the bill. I ingested some nasty THING and they took the $2 drink off? This is ridiculous. I will not be eating here or recommending this restaurant again. How she handled the situation was so impersonal and with such lack of empathy.    Its a shame because this is my favorite place to go in sf but it just shows how much The Cheesecake Factory doesn't care for its customers.
David C.,"San Francisco, United States",165,2,,1.0,29/3/2016,Waited an hour for a salad and chicken pasta and it still never came. It was a huge disappointment
Sara R.,"Castro Valley, United States",2,2,1,1.0,8/9/2015,"No toilet paper anywhere in the disgusting bathrooms where people were washing their kids feet in the sinks on a Tuesday afternoon. Service in the bar was great, moved outside to be completely ignored for almost 10 minutes. Drinks were overpriced and watery. Done with the cheesecake factory for a long time after today's visit, even the view isn't worth that experience."
Heather C.,"Rancho Cordova, United States",61,32,7,5.0,21/9/2014,"So earlier today I had my very first experience at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I'm from Sacramento but was here for my best friends small intimate wedding and the entire wedding (all 13 people) went here for dinner around 4pm.  Yes we waited about an hr and a couple of minutes but we were a big group and man was it worth it. Mind you I've heard pretty mediocre/ bad things about this restaurant chain all around but the food was amazing! I ordered the Louisiana spicy pasta dish with the crispy chicken and it was such a huge portion and mouthwatering good. And then there was our waiter Steve. Steve is awesome, clearly knows what he is talking about, super helpful and nice, and constantly refilled our bread and drinks which is huge for a big group. He also volunteered without us asking to take a photo of everyone for us. Such an awesome waiter. Steve you rock! Sincerely that weird loud group of 13 people you had this Sunday night. Thank you!"
Heather T.,"Irvine, United States",0,28,8,5.0,28/3/2016,The Cheesecake Factory has a Super Food menu! I had the Vegan Cobb salad and it was amazing! Thank you for providing great vegetarian and vegan options. Seating outside is very nice.
eunnah s.,"Castro Valley, United States",118,21,9,4.0,29/7/2014,"This cheesecake factory is pretty great.  My sister and I love getting like four appetizers and sharing especially during happy hour.  The food is good, it's pretty much the same as every other cheesecake factory.  The service is all right, but the waiting area is always too crowded.  They probably should expand it bit and put more seating for waiting people.   the view is nice if you get to sit out on the balcony, but usually it's way too cold for that, so most of the time, the view doesn't really matter.   I recommend eating here.  It's just a generic cheesecake factory."
Ben Z.,"San Francisco, United States",116,102,8,4.0,29/7/2014,"I was once told that Cheesecake factory is the ""fancy"" place you take your date when you're in High School. Needless to say, my overwhelming fear of shame never let me set foot in a CF again... until this past Friday night. My GF and I ended our night there at the bar, and you know what? It was pretty fun! The place was crawling with tourists though, but I very much enjoyed the vibe inside. The bartender was very nice and fast. We ordered 2 cheesecakes, because my GF is INCAPABLE of sharing.  Seriously though, we've almost broken up because my bite of her pizza was too big.  I just read her review and she said that she's going to order 1 cheesecake next time... YEAH. RIGHT."
Vicky N.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2015,"Came here on a Wednesday evening with my friend, and it was a busy night. We had to wait about 40 minutes for two, which we did. The server was stressed out, the food came out bad (my friend asked for medium rare, and the steak came out fully cooked). The drinks took 20+ minutes, and the tables next to us were irritated as well.  I understand it's shopping season, but come on.  Wasted our time and money! Hopefully others do not experience the same."
Deborah T.,"Lyon, France",27,109,37,5.0,6/10/2015,"Best Cheesecake Factory ever with best view! I loved it and still do. Although everyone pretty much know the Cheesecake Factory I definitely recommend this one in particular, you will have a great time looking over union square! :-)"
J D.,"San Francisco, United States",0,46,,1.0,6/8/2014,"Boy has this place gone downhill in the last couple of years.  Over the years we probably have been here about a dozen or more times, bringing guest from out of town on a number of occasions to enjoy the view of Union Square.  We recently went to celebrate our son's birthday. Oh my were we disappointed.  I don't know if they have new kitchen staff, new management or if it's too overwhelming for the kitchen to handle as they are as busy as ever, I've heard people wait a couple of hours for a table, the max we'll wait is 30 minutes which of course can turn into an hour... The food was not good at all, the pork chops were so overcooked and dry, its plating was wrong, no applesauce, over salted spinach and mashed potatoes.  Shepards pie was served with a pool of oil on its surface.  We know that Cheesecake Factory isn't the healthiest but the pool of oil was disgusting, couldn't even get it to go to give to a homeless person it was so nasty.  Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp came with 5 pieces of shrimp for $19.95.   We've had these dishes in the past so we know how good they can be when cooked properly. The only saving grace for the night was a slice of smores cheesecake. Service is spotty, you have to wave down anyone that comes by if you need something, don't know if waiters are being given too many tables.  The restaurant itself is showing it's age, dining tables and chairs and floors need to be replaced as well as the chipped dishes! We won't be returning anytime soon, we may have to re-gift the gift cards we have!  Too bad because Cheesecake Factory was always our guilt-free indulgence."
Shirley N.,"San Francisco, United States",177,1291,147,3.0,15/11/2013,"You've always got to wait unless you arrive within the first hour of opening. Located atop Macy's at Union Square.  We were here at 3pm.  Yes, given a pager and had to wait about 20+ minutes. Service here is always disjointed.  The server ask repeatedly is everything okay, but doesn't follow through.  Gotta walk the talk.  Water glass is not refilled.  Clean forks for dessert aren't brought prior to dessert coming.  Little things like that. We did family style - shrimp rolls, sliders, and the Margherita pizza.  Average food. Got two cheesecakes for dessert - Hershey chocolate and the mango key lime. Skip the mango key lime.  Way too sweet.  You can never go wrong with Hershey's.  Great outdoor patio with view of Union Square."
Donna C.,"Lafayette, United States",29,239,25,4.0,14/11/2013,Visited on 8/13/13 for dinner. Surprisingly good. A bit of a wait but we stood outside and took in the view.  We've been to the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and Boulder and were underwhelmed. This was different.  Margaritas to start were quite tasty. Hubby had enchiladas and I got the chicken tacos great black beans. Both were great. Kids had pasta Alfredo with chicken and pasta with butter. Kids snacked on bread before dinner.  In short - pleasant experience; we'll go back our next trip to SF.
Rebekah T.,"El Cerrito, United States",4554,2003,10334,4.0,25/1/2011,"Too early for an update? Not when you have Cheesecake photos like mine... Don't drool on your keyboard. :)  After going out to dinner and drinks, we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert and a little extra dinner for the hungry guy. We ordered Margaritas, Regular and Pomegranate for me. He ordered some Chicken Basil Penne dish. I was stuffed already.  The desserts were great. He's had quite a few and I'm new to the CF. He lets me believe I'm picking out which kind we are getting. We ordered the German Chocolate Cheesecake and Apple Strussel Cheesecake:  I'm having a hard time deciding which kind of cheesecake I like best, further research will be needed."
Gina h.,"Fremont, United States",7,16,6,3.0,25/2/2016,"We went here because we had a gift card from some beautiful people, not a place we'd normally go, but seemed like a good family restaurant. It wasn't super great for family as it turned out. It seemed like a ton of people were working but no one quite had their act together, so we waited for a very, very long time even though there were tons of tables and staff. For the quality of the food the prices were way to high in my opinion. The cheesecake is why your going there- in the future I'll go there with girlfriends or my husband, not for dinner, just for dessert. I do want to say we had a first class waiter. He rocked. Wish I remembered his name is give him a shout out. Well he's the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1."

We ordered the German Chocolate Cheesecake and Apple Strussel Cheesecake:  I'm having a hard time deciding which kind of cheesecake I like best, further research will be needed."
Gina h.,"Fremont, CA",7,16,6,3.0,2/25/2016,"We went here because we had a gift card from some beautiful people, not a place we'd normally go, but seemed like a good family restaurant. It wasn't super great for family as it turned out. It seemed like a ton of people were working but no one quite had their act together, so we waited for a very, very long time even though there were tons of tables and staff. For the quality of the food the prices were way to high in my opinion. The cheesecake is why your going there- in the future I'll go there with girlfriends or my husband, not for dinner, just for dessert. I do want to say we had a first class waiter. He rocked. Wish I remembered his name is give him a shout out. Well he's the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1."
