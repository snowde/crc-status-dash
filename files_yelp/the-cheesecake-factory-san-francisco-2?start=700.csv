Susan S.,"Petaluma, United States",31,128,73,4.0,9/12/2013,"Before I start the full review, my friend & me order two bloody Marys, she can't drink spicy so the bartender suggests just tomato juice for her drink we agree, mine is fantastic & spicy. My friend decides she needs more kick cause it's just vodka & bland tomato juice so we pony up to the service station & try to get the bartenders attention which we do. We wanted some of the good stuff I had in my drink added to my friends drink, just a smidge. But instead he tells the server to splash some Tabasco into the glass. That's not we expected for $9.00 drinks, he already got our tip so we were has beens. Now the rest. What a madhouse. Extreme Noise, people waiting, coming & going. This restaurant is total cookie cutter, descent fair, huge portions. And being on the 7th floor of Macys over looking union square makes for a prime location. I can't think of another restaurant that can be this successful with their large selection, portions & fair prices as well as lunch prices served til 5pm. Nice.  We ordered the avocado rolls, six large pieces served with in a crunchy fried egg roll, they might want to offer a lighter version, like endive but keep the large portion of avocado.....maybe some more herbs or spices in the avocado too. The wait staff doesn't write anything down or at least our waitress. She didn't write down we wanted the lunch portions & prices. So when we received the bill each entree was $5 more. Oh we brought it to her attention & she claimed we didn't request it, though we specifically ordered from the lunch menu & told her so & we were seated at 3pm. Is this a bait and switch? There are so many tourist there & customers that may not speak up or know how to read an American check, so I think this is standard practice. Hint, the portions are huge & a lunch portion along with all the other stuff you may order is more than sufficient. After the avocado egg rolls we both ordered salmon & the portion was great, perfectly cooked, hollandaise sauce adorned the bottom of the plate with perfect al dente asparagus on top & a nice portion of rustic red mash potatoes. For such a manic environment & apathetic waitressing & bar tending the kitchen made up for anything that was a miss. In closing I would recommend this place for location, fair prices & large portions, don't expect much from the wait staff, we still gave the staff a good tip ;-)"
Pana P.,"Berkeley, United States",36,55,275,1.0,8/7/2015,"Why did I even come here? The wait was over an hour but that's fine since the wait was expected. Ordered two drinks as we waited. Got our drinks 20 mins later. I ordered my steak medium. The food came 30 mins later. And look at the picture, does my steak look medium? It was well done and came out black. Super unappetizing. Also, I asked for no salt on my fries and it came salted. Told the waiter and she took my fries with onion rings back. Fries came back unsalted but without the onion rings. Funny. The waiter also slammed the plates on the table. Not returning."
Ally M.,"Berkeley, United States",3,289,95,3.0,8/3/2015,"I've always wanted to go to a Cheesecake Factory, because where I'm originally from, there was no close location. I was surprised that the atmosphere was a somewhat fancy one - I wasn't dressed for that!  The service was great, but the food was only mediocre. The food has lots and lots of calories, but sometimes the taste is not worth the hundreds of calories you consume! Of course, I can't say this with the desserts.  I think I won't be needing to go to cheesecake anymore."
L. L.,"Berkeley, United States",0,41,,3.0,26/5/2015,"Good when you're the tour guide. Good place to rest after showing friends around Union Square. Great if you have kids or teenagers with a sweet tooth. Surprisingly Willy-Wonka-esque interior, and nice outdoor terrace with a view. Food is o.k., best for (obviously) dessert or cocktails. Service on the slow side.  If I'm hungry, I'd rather go to Lefty's for pastrami, or Le Colonial for dinner."
Don Z.,"Daly City, United States",0,1,,1.0,23/11/2015,"I came into this restaurant for my sons birthday, i was extremely disappointed with the service i received and the food that was put onto our tables. I came in at 8PM and asked for a table for 10 and waited for 1 hour. My party was coming up the elevator which there was a line for and as soon as half my guests come in the hostess gives my table away! I asked her politely if we could get our table back and she said theres nothing she can do because the tables already been given away.  My family sat around for an additional 30 minutes on top of my hour wait. I asked the hostess how much longer our wait would be and she rolled her eyes at us and turned around like she couldnt hear us! We were seated 20 minutes after this, a total of 1 hour and 50 minutes of waiting. Our food was served 45 minutes after placing the order with our waiter. My filet mignon was bleeding bright red  and my sons chicken was cold and undercooked. We explained our problem with the waiter and he said the manager already went home which us unbelievable. A waste of 200$ never again will we come here"
Colleen E.,"Scotts Valley, United States",14,22,2,3.0,6/2/2016,"It was very difficult to get take out from here. Once we got the food out we found that they didn't give us what we ordered despite being correctly charged. The food was good, just not what we ordered. When I called I was on hold for 15 minutes before getting a manager who could process the refund. If you go, just don't get take out!"
Liang Y.,"Hayward, United States",65,17,49,4.0,22/1/2014,Strawberry lemonade is my favorite! Highly recommend of that because there is no any place can make that lemonade with strong true strawberry taste~ also every time I go there I will order fried calamari or fried popcorn shrimp. Always very soft and crispy for the deep fried staff.  I am not really like the main food at there. I don't know why maybe the sauce is not really tasty or they put too much creamy such as the pasta and some cheese staff.. Anyway service is good and people all nice.
Lynette P.,"San Francisco, United States",135,9,1,4.0,16/2/2016,Good food but the greatest thing here is the garlic bread with cheese!! OMG!! I go there just to have that amazing bread!
Tram N.,"San Jose, United States",542,350,1174,4.0,30/11/2012,"I can count the number of times I've been here on one hand, and it's because I never crave for Cheesecake Factory. It's nice to go for special occasions even though this place isn't all that special to me. The last time I came here, I was greeted by the beautiful Union Square tree lighting. It was such a gorgeous view of Union Square and I believe this time of year is the best time of year to come dine here! Crab and Aritichoke dip: AMAZING! Big enough for two people. I love the slices of toasted french bread that comes with it. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp: Huge portion. I added soy sauce to this and it became so much better. I think I didn't exactly like the balance of the toasted coconut with salty chicken. Kind of threw off my palette especially since I am a savory person. Tropical margarita: Amazing! Although, the tequila made my stomach hurt. That's not faulty of Cheesecake at all, though. Smokehouse BBQ Burger: The beau really loved this burger. He brought home left overs and ate it while it's cold and said it was still good! That's when you know you got a great burger. The meat was cooked to perfection, as asked. I thought everything was reasonably priced for the amount of food we had."
Odaliz R.,"Los Angeles, United States",93,237,884,5.0,24/6/2013,"Dear Cheesecake Factory,  I love you! Your service and food is always perfection. Thank you for making me feel at home when I'm away from home.  Sincerely,  Odaliz"
Julianna I.,"San Francisco, United States",493,319,94,4.0,27/7/2014,"So who eats at Cheesecake factory when they go to SF (unless you are a tourist?) Well, me and my boyfriend (who live in SF did!) And it was probably one of our best dates. We had dinner close by, but then we wanted to see the rooftop bar here. So we came at 9pm on Friday night and noticed that CF was pretty happening. It was crowded, full of young people (maybe all tourists). We got 2 seats at the bar, ordered 2 delicious cheesecakes and 2 rounds of Long Island Ice Teas and got pretty drunk. It was A LOT of fun. I would go again, but next time maybe only get one cheesecake because they are pretty big and really sweet."
Trisa P.,"Modesto, United States",7,1,4,1.0,25/2/2016,"I will likely never return to this place again and will never recommend it to anyone. Wait to get seated not too bad. Wait to get served horrible. I moved tables and left my purse by accident at the other table accross from me. When I asked if it had been turned in, no one knew where to look for lost and found purses; this left me frantic wondering how I was going to pay. I ordered a glass of what I thought was red Zinfandel and was served white. Julie the manager came to my table and told me it was my fault i lost my purse, her staff was trained to give found purses to management, and that all Zins are white/ blush. She argued with me and was extremely rude. I left feeling ridiculed and belittled.  The only reason it is getting one star is because the ambiance was nice. The food was decent."
Andrea D.,"Brooklyn, United States",0,11,19,5.0,2/8/2015,The View was amazing! The service Jacqueline gave was outstanding! She worked around all my special needs and produced the best GF/V burger w/ extra sautéed shrooms.
Muneera M.,"San Francisco, United States",125,154,47,2.0,9/7/2014,"So yah- it's a chain and this one kind of sucks. I typically like the cheesecake factory, only because it is super family friendly and makes outtings easy with so many options and big portions that you can share. The quality of the food and taste is chain like totally mediocre, not the greatest when you are in SF. There are way better places to eat. I rated this one a two star because it is beyond loud in there, you know when you can't hear the person next to you kind of loud. We got there at 10pm on a sunday night and there was still a 50 minute wait.  They have a pretty patio that overlooks Union Square, which is always nice, but it gets pretty chilly up there might want to bring a blanket ;)"
Cindy G.,"Dixon, United States",119,137,579,3.0,30/12/2012,"Not a big fan of crowded lines but hey, its the weekend. So my friend and I decided to go and just wait for our tables to be called out. After 40 minutes, we finally sit down.  Services was ok but they mess up my friend and I drinks order. We order the raspberry lemonade and she brought out the strawberry lemonade. But hey, we took it instead and the waitress brought the correct order for refills. We order crab cakes bits, which was good but not that great but good. Roadhouse slider, it taste like any other burger I've gone. And the southern fried chicken slider which it's the best one. Great flavor and its like a party in my mouth. After our finger food dinner, cake time! My friend order pumpkin cheese cake, which taste like the holidays. But to me, it taste like any other cheesecake. And I order vanilla bean cheesecake, taste like the vanilla bean frappucinio from Starbucks. But my friend said it taste like lindor chocolate. Overall the food is decent, service is good but there trying there best since its a busy weekend.  I would come back but only on days where it's not packed."
Robert B.,"El Dorado Hills, United States",12,134,93,4.0,3/12/2014,My chopped salad was very good as was the peppermint stick cheesecake that my wife ordered. It was a grand view of Union Square from the 7th floor of Macy's Department Store.   The decor is great with Egyptian Pillars. The service was first rate as well.  A huge menu was a pleasant surprise.
Maybo L.,"San Francisco, United States",331,159,208,3.0,9/6/2014,"Why isn't it possible to make reservations?!? The wait is super long, for a party of 4 on a Sunday at 8pm is 45 minutes. Then the food takes another 45 minutes to come. The long wait for a table and the food docks a star off since they don't take reservations. I'm sure most people do not want to plan big birthday parties and tell the whole group to wait for a table.  We were celebrating a birthday and it was nice for the waiters to come together and sing happy birthday. During the time we were there, heard two other parties celebrating birthdays. Seems like the place since the cheesecake is so delicious! Our server was pretty nice, we were checked on once in awhile to make sure everything was going well.  The food can be a hit or miss. Ordered 3 different kinds of steaks and one was flavorless (steak diane) while the hibachi steak was tasty. The rib eye didn't taste special, seems like the same thing you could anywhere else."
Ryan M.,"Ladera Ranch, United States",45,87,20,3.0,24/9/2014,"6 word review: Good food, great view, LONG WAIT.  Now if you want to see my substantiation for this, read the rest :).  This Cheesecake Factory is very conveniently located near Union Square and Westfield Mall and the Powell Bart station. The restaurant is on top of Macys, you enter through a Macys door and go up an elevator, or you can take the escalators if you want but it takes longer.  So... On to the food. Not much to review here - the portions are as big as any other Cheesecake Factory and the food is consistently as good as any other. The service is also quite good. So for that reason, I'm giving 3-Stars, the same as my other Cheesecake Factory review.  So what makes this restaurant different than other Cheesecake Factories? Well for starters, the view from this restaurant of Union Square if you sit outside at the ledge is awesome at night. It's very pretty looking down at all the people in Union Square. Keep in mind you are 8 floors up. Many people enjoy taking pictures up here with the setting/view in the background and I completely understand why :))). I was one of them, shhhh.  What else makes this one different? THE LINE. This Cheesecake Factory has the longest waits to get a table of any one that I have ever been to. Not because the restaurant is so small, but because there are so many people that patronize it. The wait is consistently 1hour+ EASILY no matter when you get there if it's not abnormally early. Remember, they don't take reservations!  Enjoy!"
Denise N.,"San Francisco, United States",97,36,16,1.0,4/7/2014,"This rating is heavily weighted for their bakery. Ask me 10 years ago I would've rated this place 5 stars regardless of their ridiculous wait times. I called in for a price quote and availability for a red velvet cheesecake as a last minute treat for the wife's bday, the lady in the receiving end had me on hold for 10 mins. By the time I had her on the line, I asked for a quick second to ask the other half to verify the cake size, the lady asked me to call back. The wife was sitting right next to me to provide an instant response. I decided at that point there were other businesses worthy of my hard-earned dollars.  The week before, we decided to grab a quick bite during bridesmaid dress shopping. Not having dined here for years, the quality in the food has gone down drastically. I had the ahi tuna salad, she had some chicken pasta dish - both were unremarkable. I suppose these were good reminders as to why we've stayed away from this establishment. Service at the time, I'd rate a 3. Food experience definitely brought this down to a 1-star experience."
Shannon Z.,"Huntington Beach, United States",522,36,95,4.0,13/7/2015,"First off, if you come here you have to sit outside on the patio. The view is amazing. Anyways when I stopped by here I came expecting to get the fried mac n cheese as my appetizer and the meatloaf as my entree. Unfortunately they were out of both so I got the ahi carpaccio appetizer and spaghetti. The ahi was excellent and well seasoned but the spaghetti was significantly undercooked. Our waitress was very sympathetic and quickly got me a new plate. I could tell she felt bad about the multiple inconveniences. For dessert I got the godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was delicious. I'm a sucker for anything rich and sickeningly sweet. My overall experience was not unpleasant but I was bummed they didn't have some of my favorite items. Maybe these shortages occur often since the restaurant is in a tourist area."
Susan S.,"Petaluma, CA",31,128,73,4.0,12/9/2013,"Before I start the full review, my friend & me order two bloody Marys, she can't drink spicy so the bartender suggests just tomato juice for her drink we agree, mine is fantastic & spicy.

That's not we expected for $9.00 drinks, he already got our tip so we were has beens. Now the rest. What a madhouse. Extreme Noise, people waiting, coming & going. This restaurant is total cookie cutter, descent fair, huge portions. And being on the 7th floor of Macys over looking union square makes for a prime location. I can't think of another restaurant that can be this successful with their large selection, portions & fair prices as well as lunch prices served til 5pm. Nice.  We ordered the avocado rolls, six large pieces served with in a crunchy fried egg roll, they might want to offer a lighter version, like endive but keep the large portion of avocado.....maybe some more herbs or spices in the avocado too.

I called in for a price quote and availability for a red velvet cheesecake as a last minute treat for the wife's bday, the lady in the receiving end had me on hold for 10 mins. By the time I had her on the line, I asked for a quick second to ask the other half to verify the cake size, the lady asked me to call back. The wife was sitting right next to me to provide an instant response. I decided at that point there were other businesses worthy of my hard-earned dollars.  The week before, we decided to grab a quick bite during bridesmaid dress shopping. Not having dined here for years, the quality in the food has gone down drastically. I had the ahi tuna salad, she had some chicken pasta dish - both were unremarkable. I suppose these were good reminders as to why we've stayed away from this establishment. Service at the time, I'd rate a 3. Food experience definitely brought this down to a 1-star experience."

Anyways when I stopped by here I came expecting to get the fried mac n cheese as my appetizer and the meatloaf as my entree. Unfortunately they were out of both so I got the ahi carpaccio appetizer and spaghetti. The ahi was excellent and well seasoned but the spaghetti was significantly undercooked. Our waitress was very sympathetic and quickly got me a new plate. I could tell she felt bad about the multiple inconveniences. For dessert I got the godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was delicious. I'm a sucker for anything rich and sickeningly sweet. My overall experience was not unpleasant but I was bummed they didn't have some of my favorite items. Maybe these shortages occur often since the restaurant is in a tourist area."
