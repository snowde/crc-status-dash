Drea W.,"San Francisco, United States",23,59,10,2.0,4/6/2014,"What the FUCK is happening to San Francisco? Since being back in the Bay Area from the East Coast I've found that many of my fav places either SUCK at customer service now and/or the food is not up to my standards- of how I remember it being. I feel that that I had suggested that a new friend and I meet up here as I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years (In SF). We originally were sitting outside in which the waiter; Steven was very attentive. We asked to be seated inside as the chill began to pick up and they had not yet turned on the heated lamps and the damn pigeons were too gangsta for me! Steven sat us inside and we were introduced to a new waiter (can't recall his name) mainly because we were then given a NEW waiter AGAIN. We were about to order but a unidentified (staff member?) said: ""Hi, I'm not sure who sat you here but I have this area reserved so If you can follow me to a new place to sit"". Long story short we ended up waiting awkwardly with drinks in our hand waiting for a table to be cleared and cleaned. I began to be a little pissed. THIS PART TOOK THE CAKE. We were now introduced to Ezekiel a.k.a Zeke. He seemed a little off to begin with but I decided to ignore it. My friend and I wasn't ready to order yet as we were still trying to get situated from the numerous moves we made. I want to mention that Zeke's other tables were in front, behind, across and adjacent front us. This detail will provide to be VERY important lol So it took Zeke 20 mins to return to us to ask what had we decided on. During that time he walked by us a minimal of 3 times- taking other table orders... checking on near by diners and it wasn't until I damn near stared him down that he FINALLY came over. He took my order- my friend arrived before I did and had ordered a pasta dish outside so we didn't want to order anything else at the time. I ordered the Garlic noodles (Noodles, asparagus, garlic butter sauce, chicken (BONELESS) with tomatoes). I get this EVERY TIME I come to C.F. Plus: My friend and I got to have a LENGTHY conversation. DOWN SIDE: It took Zeke an hour to come to our table to say: ""Oh the reason it's taking so long is because the chicken is with bone and it takes longer"". I let him know that I got this dish every time and the chicken is ALWAYS boneless and I never had to request it boneless. lol WHAT THE FUCCCK!! (I screamed that in my head). He said I can rush and tell the cook to make it boneless. He tried to tell me some bullshit about a change in the menu but the item I ordered had been on the menu for EVER!!! Anywho, he went to request to have it boneless. Took 30mins (That's now damn near 1 hr 45 mins) to come with flavorless crap! I mentioned that the food was flavorless and did not have a garlic taste to it. Zeke said: ""Well, I can give you some Parmesan cheese for it- that's all I can do"". He left and I asked another waiter to get the manager; Lisa- who was VERY sympathetic. I explained everything and what really hurt was the fact that he wasn't a sucky waiter to everyone else, just to me and my friend- whom we happen to be Black and Indian. I won't say it was a racial thing but he was ATTENTIVE, WARM, BUBBLY and ACCOMMODATING to his other tables and we couldn't even get our water refilled or any damn BREAD- I LOVE THEIR BREAD lol Anywho, Tina sent his ass home!  I doubt I would go back. The face of SF is def. changing and all these changes is driving down the quality service MY City was once known for. If I want sucky-rude waiters, I might as well move back to the East Coast."
Tina B.,"Patterson, United States",5000,152,90,5.0,18/11/2012,"I love the cheesecake factory. Everything I've tried here is really good. I usually order four cheese pasta and pasta da vinci every single time I come to the cheesecake factory but I wanted to try something different this time. I ordered stuffed mushroom and fried crispy artichoke heart as appetizers. Both was deliciously yum yum. I would order it again. For my entree, I couldn't decide what to eat and came across the Factory combo which had Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira serve with mash potatoes. That sounded good and I ordered it. The steak was one of the best steak I've ever had in my entire life. It was cooked to perfection. Full of flavor, juicy and it was like a party in my mouth. Just writing a review on it makes me want some more. The chicken madeira was pretty good. Not the best but it's good. Some part of it was bland, some part tasted a lot like wine and some have a lot of flavor. Whoever did the mixing for this chicken didn't do a good job at it. The mushrooms on the chicken madeira and steak was really good. I love mushrooms in case you haven't noticed. I can eat mushrooms with almost anything. Not a big fan of their mashed potatoes. TOO HARD and not a whole lot flavor to it. Just kinda boring.  The bread they give you before your food comes out is the best. I can eat that all day and night and won't get sick of it.  My husband ordered the mushroom burger and he said that it tasted really good. Not so dry like other restaurant burgers. The fries was cooked well but please HOLD THE SALT. The french fries was drowning in salt. NO BUENO. For dessert we had the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake and OMG this was HEAVEN. I was already full but I couldn't put the fork down after one bite. It was addicting and crazily yummy. I will definitely order it again next time. This cheesecake factory is located on the upper level above Macy's building in SF. So of course parking definitely sucks and it is always crowded. Expect a long wait whenever coming here."
Andy X.,"San Francisco, United States",2,12,,5.0,17/5/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. Although it is on the pricey side, the food makes up for it. My favorites here are the pastas and the buffalo wings. My goodness, the wings are so good. Cheesecake is what people usually come here for, but by the time I'm done with my meal, I'm already too stuffed for cheesecake. Food is delicious, you can go outside on the balcony to eat with a nice view of Downtown SF. It's also located in Downtown so you can get some shopping done afterwards."
Argel D.,"Stockton, United States",0,11,,1.0,19/8/2016,This is the worst cheesecake factory I have eaten at. The service is very slow and the server is not friendly at all. She did not even bring us any bread. It took her 15 minutes to get our drinks.
Diana V.,"Las Vegas, United States",4,12,2,2.0,5/8/2016,"We've been to many a Cheesecake Factories. The food is very good and consistent. It's the service that varies. My son ordered chicken sliders and they brought hamburger sliders. When I told the waitress, she said""let me see what's in the computer"" as if that would prove something. Another waitress (neither our original) came by and asked us what we wanted. We all finished our meal before my sons correct order came. The attitudes were not what we'd expect at a Cheesecake Factory. Not a great experience even though the food was good."
Diana C.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,4,1.0,15/2/2016,Worst service ever I ordered an hour ago a simple burger it's now been 1 hour or even more than that and now they decide to tell me they forgot my burger. It was suppose to be a nice date on a nice sunny day but I guess that's so hard to have . So disappointed we came from San Jose to eat here and have a nice view but now my day is ruined thanks to this piece of shit service . Don't come here they don't know how to handle a busy day
Geraldine M.,"Daly City, United States",0,15,5,3.0,15/10/2015,"Friends and I are obsessed w Cheesecake Factory, but the line is NOT worth it. Employees there really try their best to accommodate everyone, but an hour long wait is ridiculous. It's not their fault, CF is the ultimate tourist destination w a beautiful view of Union Square. You're lucky to be seated out there when it's not freezing. Regardless, we always come back for FANTASTIC cheesecake."
Steve S.,"Modesto, United States",0,13,,1.0,1/3/2016,The other people were right - get here on the wrong day and it's a MAJOR clusterf**k - people EVERYWHERE...like ANTS The ONE star is not for their service or food It's for the PIGEON problem that they need to address on the outside deck/patio - PIGEONS walk ON THE TABLES THAT PEOPLE EAT AT - Employees come wipe the tables...after pigeons have walked on the tables and then the pigeons walk on them again so not only is toxic to human pigeon feces on their feet getting onto the tables from the pigeons walking on them...but then employees come wipe the tables with the rag/towel and then go wipe OTHER tables that pigeons haven't walked on contaminating those table tops - will be making a complaint with the city/county health boards
Kam L.,"San Francisco, United States",6,18,59,4.0,16/8/2016,"went here for lunch at 12:30 with a friend. we were able to easily get seats at the bar. we were served by ashmini who was super kind and attentive. she was friendly and wonderful company. i told my friend i wanted to give her a hug after; he said i probably shouldnt do that haha. we ordered the egg roll sampler and the bang bang shrimp along with some sangria. the sangria was surprisingly strong. the egg roll sampler was ashmini's recommendation and a good one at that! a nice tasting of four different rolls. the bang bang shrimp needs a different batter- perhaps panko- also got a little soggy, too much sauce. we also shared a caramel cheesecake that was devine."
Dustin P.,"Sacramento, United States",22,52,1,3.0,23/7/2016,"Busy, non attentive service, unorganized.  We sat for at least ten minutes before anyone came to ask for drinks or water.  Keep your section organized."
Hussain A.,"Los Angeles, United States",8,47,9,1.0,9/1/2015,Bad service and the food wasn't all that Not worth the money and the wait I wish if I went somewhere else with my family  Zero stars
Danielle O.,"San Francisco, United States",1,65,,2.0,20/6/2014,"Um, I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory, but I don't feel your food is worth getting steam-rolled and crushed to the death by the people in back of me because the stupid idiots in front of me don't realize that the escalator going up to the restaurant doesn't stop moving just because they got off it.  MOOOOVE your stupid ass over to the side, instead of staying in the center, Fool!   Maaaan!! Provided you survive the escalator episode, you will try to make it over to the ""reservation"" counter where you tell them how many people are in your party, where you prefer to sit (inside or outside) and then the staff hands you a flashing, vibrating pager while they tell you that you will be seated after a short wait.  AHAhahaHAAAHAAA...   From this point of the ""amusement park ride"" line, you will be standing for oh a good 45 minutes or an hour give or take, while everybody and their great grandma keeps bumping into you, because they think the line will move faster, even though the people in front of the line haven't moved an inch.   Once you have reached the front of the line, another staff person will usher you to a table. The comfort and space of the table where you are ultimately seated is directly proportional to the amount of cosmetic surgery, designer clothes and jewelry you have.  The ushers make sure the ""skinny/pretty"" folks have at least two extra chairs to place their purses and cute little shopping bags.  Sorry, but if you're average looking and casually dressed, you will be placed at a table where you will have barely enough room to put one elbow on, let alone your appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks. Speaking of the food...  Once you are seated, after having waited in line for so long, you will be so hungry that you will inhale whatever appetizer you order, along with any bread the server gives you.  I ordered a Steak Diane, which when I got it, seemed to be so much smaller than the photos of the dish that other Yelpers have taken.  Steak was cooked well-done which made it very dry.  The mushrooms and sauce had nice flavor, but the overall portion of the dish was too small. I had my hopes up for a mind-blowing dessert at least.  I figured after all that the ""Cheesecake Factory"" should at least meet my standards for great cheesecake... I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake which was pretty unremarkable.  It didn't taste particularly fresh, the texture was a little dry and hard in some spots.  The flavor was kind of blah, with the Kahlua and coffee flavors both not standing out.  In general, the whole feel of the dessert was like something commercially or mass produced, not 'homemade'. No love added as the secret ingredient. Now that I really analyze it, I guess that the Cheesecake Factory is appropriately named.  The whole experience was a lot like being a part of an assembly-line production -  being shuttled from point A to point B, to point C, served by wait staff with painted-on smiles, food given to you to consume as quickly as possible so that they can give you the check, you can pay (more than the quality and quantity of your food is worth) and then leave.  Then, for them, it's on to the next crash-dummy, I mean customer.  No, thank you, Cheesecake Factory.  If I wanted to hang out and eat at a place where I felt like a number, I'd sooner go to a fast food restaurant..."
Jen L.,"Agoura Hills, United States",195,584,253,3.0,7/8/2013,"It's crowded, It's toursty, It's CROWDED If I have friends that are visiting, I will brave the masses for the view. If you go early you can have a nice brunch outside with the view. If you want quick service try the bar.  Or even take out, go eat on the Square."
Sandra L.,"Manhattan, United States",4,17,4,2.0,12/9/2014,"Not the experince I was hoping for, this location has such high expectations due to thelocation , and they did not come threw. Granted they have no real control over the 45 min wait time for a table. My problem is with our coming in cold which I can not accept, as a busy place they should not be serving a plate that waited to long and got cold. The drinks came on time and they wete good, I was even going to leave a 3 star review, but the manager was rude when we complained about the cold plate and did not even care. I will not be going to visit this location again, and I do not reccomend"
Icy H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,4,1,4.0,26/1/2016,"Good cheesecake and large portions, but there's always a wait at this location. My favorite is thai lettuce wraps and strawberry cheesecake."
Sammie G.,"Albany, United States",0,16,,3.0,17/1/2015,"Beautiful environment, but service and food deemed otherwise. Our waiter was very nice, but we had like five different people help us so I honestly didn't know who to direct my questions and requests to.  Also, kitchen must have been very far from our table as every time we asked for a condiment it took several minutes to get back to our table, something i have yet to experience at other dining establishments.  I do however need to reiterate that the customer service was very kind and welcoming, however, management might not be up to par considering extremely long wait times for dining amenities. Also, pricing for particular dishes (especially) burgers and alcohol related drinks were marked up to the extreme, as the burger I had was subpar yet costed me a hefty ten dollars-eleven dollars.  Seek this place out if you are looking to be visually pleased by gorgeous architecture and desire a very crowded environment, however, seek other options if you would like to really experience a plethora of different dining options."
Jennifer K.,"San Francisco, United States",4,26,1,4.0,13/1/2016,"This is my guilty pleasure restaurant. You know, one that you secretly love but don't tell anyone that you do because everyone seems to think this belongs in the Better-Than-Sizzler-But-You-Can-Do-So-Much-Better list of restaurants (BJ's and Outback included in that list). I've had some great experiences here and some okay experiences. My favorite entree is always the Pasta Da Vinci. I like my pasta like I like my friends - saucy. Sometimes my pasta is too dry, and sometimes it's soaking with Madeira wine sauce. I personally prefer the latter. Their crab and artichoke dip is AMAZING and I will always go for their red velvet cheesecake. Crab cakes are a hit or miss, but a little too pricey for me take that risk often."
ren M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,50,4,1.0,15/7/2016,this place is a joke. I've been here many of times when it was good ... NOW the workers are lazy and young.. hipster type .. Let me explain ...  cane here at 10 pm .  Friday night they close at 1230.. got seated at 1015.. ordered a drink.... 30 min later here came my shot... we placed our order.. 1045.. its now 1145 not even bread came..

I was like I hope that's free ..  lol.. ok so I'm in a good mood and it's payday fuk it right .. wrong.. second table... got to really see what was up.. the vampire skater looking Broad was mad because I asked to be seated else where ... so .. now it's midnight.. still no bread.. no food.. im ready to go to get burrito at a  Taqueria now.. .. this place is a joke save your money  eat someplace else.. if you want a view go walk the golden gate Bridge .. this place went down hill .
Miss R.,"Palo Alto, United States",0,27,6,2.0,13/1/2015,"Okay first the good news- it's gorgeous to look at and the ambiance definitely has the wow factor, and the outside seating is has some of the most beautiful views of union square especially at night. And the customer service is great, people are friendly peppy even! :D it's the city!  So what's so bad you ask? It breaks my heart to say this but the eating utensils and the glasses are dirty and I found something in my food once. Another time I got food poisoning, as soon as I left within the hour, I threw up and was  $40 dollars poorer :( This makes me so sad because I love this chain man! So I will  just admire SF cheesecake from afar, and visit their sister store Palo Alto cheesecake factory :D One day I hope to come back to this beautiful one, when she's cleaned up a bit I love you Cheesecake Factory Union square ..until we meet again. Tip- if your just going to the bar or having some drinks, you may be fine. Alcohol will kill mostly anything lol"
Theresa S.,"National City, United States",0,4,,1.0,21/2/2016,I have been to 4 different cheesecake factorys and this one has killed it for all of the other ones i have been here for 2 hours being told i will be seated within 30 to 45 min i have waited 1hr and 40 min just to be seated i would go up to them and ask how much longer the wait is and they would tell u 45 min without looking at the person and the time to every person that asked they would say the same thing. I finally get seated and have to wait an extra 20 min for a server to ask for our drinks. We received our drinks and and still waited an extra hour just to get our food! Like really at least have someone come check up on us or give us bread and refills since the food isnt ready. Never again will i come back!

Now that I really analyze it, I guess that the Cheesecake Factory is appropriately named.  The whole experience was a lot like being a part of an assembly-line production -  being shuttled from point A to point B, to point C, served by wait staff with painted-on smiles, food given to you to consume as quickly as possible so that they can give you the check, you can pay (more than the quality and quantity of your food is worth) and then leave.  Then, for them, it's on to the next crash-dummy, I mean customer.  No, thank you, Cheesecake Factory.  If I wanted to hang out and eat at a place where I felt like a number, I'd sooner go to a fast food restaurant..."

If you go early you can have a nice brunch outside with the view. If you want quick service try the bar.  Or even take out, go eat on the Square."
Sandra L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,17,4,2.0,9/12/2014,"Not the experince I was hoping for, this location has such high expectations due to thelocation , and they did not come threw. Granted they have no real control over the 45 min wait time for a table. My problem is with our coming in cold which I can not accept, as a busy place they should not be serving a plate that waited to long and got cold. The drinks came on time and they wete good, I was even going to leave a 3 star review, but the manager was rude when we complained about the cold plate and did not even care. I will not be going to visit this location again, and I do not reccomend"
Icy H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,1,4.0,1/26/2016,"Good cheesecake and large portions, but there's always a wait at this location. My favorite is thai lettuce wraps and strawberry cheesecake."
Sammie G.,"Albany, CA",0,16,,3.0,1/17/2015,"Beautiful environment, but service and food deemed otherwise. Our waiter was very nice, but we had like five different people help us so I honestly didn't know who to direct my questions and requests to.  Also, kitchen must have been very far from our table as every time we asked for a condiment it took several minutes to get back to our table, something i have yet to experience at other dining establishments.  I do however need to reiterate that the customer service was very kind and welcoming, however, management might not be up to par considering extremely long wait times for dining amenities. Also, pricing for particular dishes (especially) burgers and alcohol related drinks were marked up to the extreme, as the burger I had was subpar yet costed me a hefty ten dollars-eleven dollars.  Seek this place out if you are looking to be visually pleased by gorgeous architecture and desire a very crowded environment, however, seek other options if you would like to really experience a plethora of different dining options."
Jennifer K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,26,1,4.0,1/13/2016,"This is my guilty pleasure restaurant. You know, one that you secretly love but don't tell anyone that you do because everyone seems to think this belongs in the Better-Than-Sizzler-But-You-Can-Do-So-Much-Better list of restaurants (BJ's and Outback included in that list). I've had some great experiences here and some okay experiences. My favorite entree is always the Pasta Da Vinci. I like my pasta like I like my friends - saucy. Sometimes my pasta is too dry, and sometimes it's soaking with Madeira wine sauce. I personally prefer the latter. Their crab and artichoke dip is AMAZING and I will always go for their red velvet cheesecake. Crab cakes are a hit or miss, but a little too pricey for me take that risk often."

Miss R.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,27,6,2.0,1/13/2015,"Okay first the good news- it's gorgeous to look at and the ambiance definitely has the wow factor, and the outside seating is has some of the most beautiful views of union square especially at night. And the customer service is great, people are friendly peppy even! :D it's the city!  So what's so bad you ask? It breaks my heart to say this but the eating utensils and the glasses are dirty and I found something in my food once. Another time I got food poisoning, as soon as I left within the hour, I threw up and was  $40 dollars poorer :( This makes me so sad because I love this chain man! So I will  just admire SF cheesecake from afar, and visit their sister store Palo Alto cheesecake factory :D One day I hope to come back to this beautiful one, when she's cleaned up a bit I love you Cheesecake Factory Union square ..until we meet again. Tip- if your just going to the bar or having some drinks, you may be fine. Alcohol will kill mostly anything lol"
Theresa S.,"National City, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/21/2016,I have been to 4 different cheesecake factorys and this one has killed it for all of the other ones i have been here for 2 hours being told i will be seated within 30 to 45 min i have waited 1hr and 40 min just to be seated i would go up to them and ask how much longer the wait is and they would tell u 45 min without looking at the person and the time to every person that asked they would say the same thing. I finally get seated and have to wait an extra 20 min for a server to ask for our drinks. We received our drinks and and still waited an extra hour just to get our food! Like really at least have someone come check up on us or give us bread and refills since the food isnt ready. Never again will i come back!
