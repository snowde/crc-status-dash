Issac W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,7,,2.0,3/8/2014,Pasta carbonara was over boiled and buffalo wings were too salty. Only good thing was the night view of Union Square.
Richard J.,"Monterey, United States",54,99,62,5.0,20/9/2015,Great food for a chain place. Though the only reason this place gets 5 stars is our server Frances B...amazingly and genuinely friendly...attentive without being overbearing...sweet and fun. She is how I love servers to be...and they are a rarity. Oh...and she's damn cute too...but that has nothing to do with her skills.
Bekka L.,"Monterey, United States",4,39,3,4.0,21/1/2016,"I insisted on going here while in the city.  The food is always good, service is great and the view off of the patio is awesome.  They had the heaters up, so it wasn't too cold.  Great portions on the food and we got seated rather quickly (about a 10 minute wait).  My ONLY complaint is about the pigeons.  I know I know, they are the pet bird of SF, but boy, are they bold and apparently addicted to cheesecake.  It's a wonder they aren't fatter.  The waiters do a pretty good job of shooing them away, but it seems like something could be added to keep them off of the tables.  Maybe some of those owls sitting around in obvious spots?  I don't know... but if you don't want to eat with wildlife fluttering over and on your table, you might want to eat indoors.  I will eat here again the next time I'm in the city... but definitely going to ask for an indoor seat."
Adamme K.,"San Francisco, United States",3,111,175,5.0,28/11/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always good, especially with such a ginormous menu, but the wait is atrocious. Especially in such a touristy area. A little hard to get to since it's above Macy's."
Joaquin A.,"Mountain View, United States",117,31,5,4.0,20/7/2014,"I've experienced a lot of Cheesecake places and this is still one of my favorites mainly for the view.  If you aren't in a rush or don't care for a wait (which could be an hr or more), then yeah dine here. If you do end up waiting, you can go downstairs to Macy's - no big deal. Recently, I've been getting their Teriyaki rice dish. Now, some people might be like nahhh its not that great, but for me - its pretty decent. I enjoy it. Especially since I always get the costelleta.  You can never go wrong with the dessert here.  Also, if you end up being outside - hope you have a jacket. It does get windy TIP: If you want some eye candy best believe you'll find at least a handful of waiters and customers that be looking right - definitely a bonus if you just wanna people watch ;)  Also, the service is a hit or miss...You can get a great waiter or a waiter that is pretty spacey like the one I had recently, but with the view and eye candy - it makes up for it :)"
Maria G.,"San Francisco, United States",15,9,1,3.0,1/2/2016,"I love the food and the service in this restaurant. However I feel that this place has a health hazard with all the doves that fly and eat from the tables and walk on the freshly wiped tables and cutlery. In fact we have experienced many times the waiters putting new cutlery in the tables and wiping the table, then 10 minutes bring the new clients in who use that table and cutlery! In the between all the pigeons walked on both cutlery and cloths and I feel that this is very very dirty as doves curry such dangerous diseases! I personally always ask for my table to be wipe as soon as I seat and new cutlery to be provided! I feel it be best if they just wiped and bring the cutlery out after the customer was seated!"
Celia C.,"Little Rock, United States",0,5,,1.0,27/8/2016,I visited Cheesecake Factory when the cruise ship I worked on was being refurbished. We don't have one in my home state but I decided to give it a try. I was not impressed by this restaurant. I ordered the Factory combination steak diane and shrimp scampi. It took a long time to receive my order. Food wasn't impressive at all. Maybe I went on a bad night. I don't think I can throw TCF under the bus as of yet. I might give them another chance.
I. W.,"San Francisco, United States",0,8,3,2.0,20/3/2015,"The pros: nice view, one can sit outside, the waitress was pleasant, the sundae ice cream was an eye catcher.  The cons: The wait was way too long, the front desk women were rude, that brought the stars one notch down."
Marlowe A.,"Lincoln, United States",0,3,,2.0,13/5/2014,"I want to explain why I gave 2 stars.  1. I'm not a native of San Francisco so  decided to grab something within walking distance and I know I enjoy Cheesecake Factory and so I decided to order out.  2. Before I left my hotel I called to order out. I was put on hold for 5 minutes. I started walking and by the time I got there I was on hold for a total of 20 minutes. I showed the manager my phone and explained the situation. She apologized and took my order but with NO comp, free drink, appetizer, cheesecake, NOTHING.  As a customer, I feel devalued and my view is that my business is unappreciated.  I gave 1 extra star because the man at the bakery saw I was upset and whispered that he would give me some fries.  You sir, I appreciate. The woman on the other hand, I really suggest that you learn to treat each customer with the respect and value them completely regardless of age/race/appearance.  I am disappointed and will not be giving them my business anymore."
Sam l.,"San Francisco, United States",0,22,7,1.0,13/2/2016,Party of just 5 The most miserable 4hours waiting and horrible service ever! Thank you for embarrassing me with multiple guest in town. We could of gone somewhere else but this was a bday weekend for families. If you want to have the worst dining experience please eat at this location.food were beyond sloppy
Zaz A.,"San Francisco, United States",0,2,,1.0,16/5/2016,The services is bad the manager is ass hole  I was waiting around 1 hour. There is table for 4 and he told us for 6 after 5 minutes I saw 4 people stay in the table
Sean A.,"Modesto, United States",0,2,,1.0,14/8/2016,The food at this place is disgusting. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It was terrible. If I wanted some thing freeze dried I would have went to a gas station and saved some money. On top of terrible food the service was nearly non-existent. And when the waiter did come around he wasn't even that friendly. Needless to say the tip wasn't that good. Come to find out a couple of days later the server changed my tip and gave himself a significant amount more. Stay away from this place or at least pay cash so you don't get ripped off. On a brighter note the cheesecake was good.
Maria L.,"London, United Kingdom",17,338,19,1.0,7/9/2015,Rudest employees ever.  Patio section is a cluster.  They had all of the patio heaters turned on in 85 degree weather!  And when people asked them to them off they got attitudes!  Am I missing something.  Hostess was yelling at some poor lady asking for a table outside.  Hostess kept yelling I CANT SEAT YOU BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH SERVERS TODAY!  At like the top of her lungs.  Like it was the customers fault.  Poor lady was embarrassed in front of her kids. Will never go here again and the managers here are worthless.  Most of the servers are rude and ignore you and roll their eyes.
Jessica W.,"Sacramento, United States",72,264,1162,2.0,15/9/2014,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located at the top of Macys in Union Square. It is  mnawfully busy. We ordered to-go and it was so crazy packed with people standing everywhere because there was not much seating area. That made It very not comfortable trying to find the line as well as standing in line waiting to have or to-go order taken. I think the way the restaurant's designed made togo very uneasy to access with the commotion of workers and guest piled along the middle of the restaurant in front of the cashier, to-go and elevators. If you are claustrophobic, it will be a problem."
Blake D.,"Aliso Viejo, United States",1,4,,5.0,7/2/2016,"I had the best customer service experience here at this specific Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco out of any experience anywhere. The manager Julie was the most patient, thoughtful and sweetest woman ever. We had some minor hiccups with our dishes but she handled the whole experience with such ease and with such an amazing attitude that it made the whole situation so much easier to deal with. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a dining experience paired with unprecedented customer service. Thank you Julie"
Vu N.,"Port Arthur, United States",235,10,2,2.0,6/1/2016,"Do NOT get the Baja chicken tacos. For some reason I really feel like this location has fallen off the reservation. Their food isn't fresh. Their utensils aren't clean. The service is nice, however. Whoever the chef today was should definitely taste his food. The rice is overcooked and their flour tortillas are hard. The charred chicken is absolutely petrifying."
Anan W.,"American Canyon, United States",0,13,2,1.0,4/1/2016,"This restaurant is disgraceful. I work for delivery so I had to pick up food from there but I had to use the bathroom. I went to wash my hands and the bathroom had NO HANDSOAP in there for me to use (mind you this is the girls bathroom at that).  I went and told my sister to tell them to come and bring some, we waited 30 minutes for them to come and STILL DIDN'T COME. Then I told her to go and tell them to bring some AGAIN they didn't come. I got tired of waiting and went in the men's bathroom to get soap because that's DISGUSTING why would I (especially being a FOOD delivery person) just wash my hands with water? To make insult to injury this idiot employee comes in the men's bathroom to tell us to get out. Also if there was no soap in the women's bathroom what were the female chef's using to clean their hands?!!!! (EW) WELL SIR IF YOU WOULD'VE BROUGHT THE HANDSOAP TO THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM AS FAST AS YOU CAME IN THE MEN'S BATHROOM TO TELL US TO GET OUT THEN I WOULD HAVE NEVER (EVER) HAVE HAD TO GO INTO THE MEN'S BATHROOM TO GET SOAP! From this experience I will NEVER (EVER) accept deliveries that require me to go to this Cheesecake Factory EVER AGAIN and I will NEVER eat from here again."
Chris Y.,"San Francisco, United States",129,1,,1.0,11/5/2014,"This may be the worst service ever! How can they serve everyone else before us?! I ordered my Strawberry Margirita Half an hour ago, and it still hasn't come. We had a guy server 30 minutes ago, and all of a sudden we got a new server? What happened to serving food to the ladies first? I've been having my food for 15 minutes & my girlfriend hasn't received her food yet. I work in the restaurant industry as well & we give our costumers the best service, so I believe we should get good service. This may be the worst dinner I've had on a date. With that being said, fortunately the Fried zucchini was amazing & it was fresh."
K J.,"Corona, United States",8,22,7,2.0,21/7/2015,"First, let me start by saying I have never had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory, until today. We waited 35 minutes for our table, no problem, we knew that. First waitress was attentive took our order   However when asked about how spicy a dish was, she said ""not at all"" well, it was. Appetizers were awesome as always.  Our waitress went on break.  Two other people brought out the meals, of the 4 entrees, one was very spicy, one very peppery, and the shrimp scampi had battered shrimp which was not explained on the menu. My chicken Madeira was very good (I like to include the positives) We would have told the waitress, but she was AWOL and it took almost 10 minutes to get side refills and that was because we asked another server to tell ours that our drinks were empty.  My husband had to hunt down the manager because our waitress couldn't be found. Ultimately, they took two meals off (the super spicy one got mostly eaten) and gave us two slices of cheesecake. The biggest issue was the amount of time it took to get it taken care of when it should have been a simple fix."
Denise L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",3229,523,3736,3.0,13/7/2012,"Your standard Cheesecake Factory. Food is awesome, portions are huge, the wait is forever. But the cheesecake is always so good. For this particular location, I'd say the wait (even with the superb cheesecake) is NOT worth it. The lines are ridiculous, especially during the holidays, and you have to deal with all the street traffic to get into Macy's. Check out one in another location; they have parking lots and waits under an hour. I swear!"
