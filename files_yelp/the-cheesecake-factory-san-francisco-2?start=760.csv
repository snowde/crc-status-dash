Veronica R.,"Los Gatos, United States",22,54,37,1.0,4/10/2015,"I'm staying in SF tonight and my family wanted to order dinner and cheesecake.... I called to JUST place the order and was on hold over 20 minutes... That's not a ""brief hold!"" I hung up....disappointed my family!"
Vic M.,"Chico, United States",0,359,608,4.0,24/6/2014,"Went here for lunch. The food was good the service was okay and for the price overall this  Cheesecake Factory deserved a 4 rating:. The Kobe hamburger was excellent. The ""skinny licious"" tacos were excellent as well."
VB L.,"San Mateo, United States",971,720,826,4.0,5/12/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has the best appie menu, but this one has all the other stuff to go with it.  First, you can't beat the view.  I spent the whole time watching ice skaters while waiting for my table.  The crew was squeegeeing off the patio because it had poured rain earlier and they were really in a crunch for tables.  Buzz buzz buzz goes my placeholder telling me my table was ready and the cheery staff showed me the way.  I got a great little table with a good view.  People were being seated outside because the weather was clearing and the Christmas tree in Union Square highlighted the Christmas music inside the restaurant.  I ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls and Sliders, both done to perfection.  Although the waiter was SO busy, he was a sweetheart and joked with me about sitting down to enjoy the meal with me.   All of a sudden the rain started again and BOOM ~ chaos!!  All the people outside had to be moved inside.  Birds flying everywhere to get the food abandoned by folks.  People pouring inside with nowhere to sit, watching their food drown in the puddles of water accumulating on their plates.  Through all of this, the staff was awesome!  Everyone was taken care of, the birds chased away and the food shuffled off to some hidden location.  The food was great and the entertainment value superb.  I'm going back tomorrow.  Gee, I hope it rains again."
David G.,"Seattle, United States",97,35,3,4.0,21/12/2015,"If you've ever tried to find a restaurant in Union Square, you know what a zoo it can be.  We had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macys.  Fantastic views, even in the rain.  Great patio when it's nicer out.  The elevator going up opens at 11:00 am and is usually backed up with people.  I recommend taking the escalator up as far as the 6th floor then taking the other elevator up to the 7th.  You will be the first in line!  Anyway, the food was so/so but what a selection!  Pizza, sandwiches, salads, chicken dishes, breakfast and of course, cheesecakes.  I opted for the omelet which was just okay but a fun experience anyway.  Try something different and enjoy the views."
Elena A.,"San Francisco, United States",79,41,309,5.0,1/7/2012,"I 1st came to this Cheesecake Factory location in (2007) with my boy friend. I heard so many good things about it, I was just dying to try it out. My employee's would always brag about it. So, I got him to take me there. That visit was all I imagined & more. So, I recently rounded up my friends back in February of this year & off we went.  It is always quite a long wait. So, be prepared. If you don't have ant patience you better venture else where.  Now this, Cheesecake factory just happens to be located in Macy's Union square you catch the elevator & up you go to the floor with amazing food & ambiance. I love the interior of this place it's like a formal but contemporary. The lighting is dim to set a romantic tone. It is just gorgeous on the inside makes yo feel like your really somewhere special. You also have the option of outdoor seating & heated outdoor seating at that. As they have torches or heating lamps set up. The view is amazing as your over looking union square, sky scrapers & the outdoor ice skating rink. My friends & I took this seating option. Now, on to my favorite part the food. I had the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane:mouth watering  Shrimp Scampi sautéed in buttery garlic white wine sauce,  sprinkled in basil and tomato. The steak Diane is something to talk about juicy Angus Beef Steak cooked to perfection  covered with black peppercorns smothered  in a  rich mushroom wine sauce with a side of wonderful  garlic mashed potatoes. This honestly has to be the very best steak I've had in a while & I have not came across a steak as good since unfortunately. This whole meal was worth every last dime. I'm yearning for it as we speak.  Now let's get down to the Cheesecake part of the Cheesecake factory as that is what they are known for. I had the over the top  Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. Let me tell you what this bad boy consist of: velvety Hershey's Cheesecake along with soft luscious Chocolate Cake. It is oh so moist. That's not all its  topped with Creamy Chocolate Frosting with a whole wall of Chocolate Chips. Oh, this is it for any chocolate lover. It is rich but not over bearing. It's heaven in every bite. Not only is it delicious but it  is a work of art. It is almost too pretty to eat. My boy friend doesn't even like sweets & he loved there cheese cake & that says a lot. I love them I must come back soon. There food is calling me! -Elena ;)"
David R.,"Oakland, United States",91,65,24,1.0,2/7/2014,Chessecake Factory is overpriced and the menu is too extensive. Try a simple breakfast/lunch from a local eatery. Save money and have good old fashioned home cooked food.
Jessica X.,"San Francisco, United States",98,15,,4.0,24/11/2014,"This is my go-to whenever my friends and I finish shopping or roaming the streets of downtown! It never fails to disappoint me! Although, the wait can get a bit long. It all depends on the hour, the occasion, and etc. However, my friends and I usually don't tend to wait over 30 minutes on average. Given we go in around lunch time (11-12ish). I've tried just about half of their very extensive menu. So far, no complaints. Everything tastes pretty good! It doesn't hurt to say that the portions are also more-than-generous. If you're a big eater, dinner size would be no problem, but for folks with a more smaller to normal appetite, it might be a bit of struggle for you to finish.  Service is a good pace. I wish it could be a bit more timely or quicker, but with the traffic this place gets, it's understandable. The staff members do work very hard to stay on their toes and serve you.  Pricing is not bad for what you're getting. Good food and good atmosphere! Not too noisy and perfect for small to large groups!"
Gwen S.,"Oakdale, United States",0,35,12,4.0,7/7/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a favorite, sometimes the wait is long, but always worth it in the end. HUGE servings, Split an entree! Cheesecake is to die for!  If you don't sit outside, make sure you visit to see the view.  It's an extra special evening during the holidays!"
Sunny H.,"Berkeley, United States",110,56,,3.0,3/7/2014,"For some reason, I keep finding reasons to come back here time and time again even though each experience has been very mediocre. At the end of the day, I think it's the location and the ambiance that make me want to give it another shot. This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor of Macy's in Union Square, affording it a really nice view of downtown San Francisco. Although it can get chilly at times, the patio is in my opinion the prime location to get the best dining experience. After all, that's the biggest differentiating factor of this specific location. Food-wise, it's very average at best. The only dish I've had here that I really enjoyed was the Chicken Piccata. I love the light flavors and the angel hair pasta in this dish. Beyond that, the other dishes I've tried as well as my friends' dishes have all been very average and don't justify the price. However, I have yet to try their famous cheesecakes so maybe that will be a game changer the next time I come here. Because of its prime location, prepare for very long wait times on the weekends. On the weekdays, small parties can usually get a seat within half an hour. Waiting in their lobby with tons of other tourists is a beast in itself, so I would recommend taking advantage of the new system they've implemented. They text you when your food is ready, which is pretty convenient because now you can shop all over Macy's and in neighboring areas while you're waiting. Overall, it's a good place to bring out of town guests or to treat yourself a little bit. If you're looking for better food, however, I would recommend trying one of the many other restaurants nearby."
Ann M.,"Portland, United States",1,98,1,5.0,5/7/2015,Mid afternoon seating for 2 in less than 20 minutes.  A proven restaurant for quality food.  I usually get the shrimp platter with fries and cole slaw.   after a 3 hour tour and a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge I was very hungry and this hit the spot.
Kathy V.,"Hercules, United States",865,677,3033,4.0,21/5/2010,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory? I do!!! I'm always down to go to Cheesecake Factory, I just have a hard time deciding what to order. I usually get the same things but have tried a lot on their menu. There was one year some friends of mine made a pack that we would come every two weeks and order something different, well that didn't last long because it was costing us $$$ and we always craved for our favorites!!!  Oh BTW, they added a kids menu @ Cheesecake factory!! (finally)  and an individual small menu with smaller portions!  Here are some of my faves: Appetizers- Avocado Egg rolls- 5 stars!  Fried Calamari-4 stars  Thai lettuce wraps- 3 stars  Spicy Ahi Tempura roll- 4 stars  Chicken pot stickers -3 stars  Road-slide sliders- 4 stars  Cobb Salad- 4 stars  Main Course food:  Shrimp Bistro Pasta -5 stars  Grilled Shrimp & Bacon club-5 stars  BBQ Salmon - 5 stars  Beef Ribs- 5 stars  Chicken Madeira- 5 stars  Chicken Marsala -5 stars  My favorite Cheesecakes are: Tuxedo & Red velvet  I must sound like a pig!! oh get this too, did you know by law in California at every restaurant has to have a Calorie Count Menu? I happened to see it @ Cheesecake factory and was turned off!!! Can you believe a slice of red velvet cake is a whomping 1,500 calories? ughhhhhh"
Myra C.,"Menlo Park, United States",0,40,50,1.0,1/8/2015,Very frustrated waiting at this place.Was told 1 1/2 and its been 2 hours.Never coming back here again:(
Arielle J.,"Union City, United States",1,14,2,1.0,7/6/2015,This review is all based on customer service. IT SUCKS!!!!!!!! Customer service sucks so bad that i lost my appetite.
Yanakon D.,"San Francisco, United States",38,40,563,4.0,27/10/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory might not be the best place to go for food in SF because it's always packed with tourists but it's still a place to go for a slice of cake when you're downtown. When I crave for cake I always have to run here because of the varieties that I can't deny. The original is good, the ultimate red velvet is a must, the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake is delish and the lemon meringue is awesome. It seems a little pricey but the huge food portions worth the price and they're equally tasty."
E L.,"Belvedere Tiburon, United States",0,27,8,1.0,3/1/2016,"I don't know what went wrong with this place, it used to be such an enjoyable experience but not anymore. We sat down and first thing we saw were dirty utensils sitting on the barely dry table. I asked for another set of silverware, dirty again. I ask for another, finally clean. I ask for water and there are particles in the water. On my plate were coffee stains. Later, I saw someone setting the table in front of us and that person coughed without covering their mouth WHILE setting the table and that's when I decided that was enough and left. Does no one check the silverware before they head out? Or the plates? Or the tables? Or anything? Jesus."
Tony C.,"San Francisco, United States",10,52,17,4.0,15/7/2014,"I've been here countless of times and it's always busy. Locals and tourists alike come here often. Wait can be long. My friends and I always get there early. We like sitting outside rather than the inside. When the fog in SF fades, it's nice to dine out in the warmth. You get a good view of the Union Square and the other buildings nearby.  The food here was great. I ordered one of their pasta (Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta) for around $14 I think and the portion was pretty big. I also tried their burgers on another trip, not that great compared to the pasta. One of my friend ordered the fillet mignon and he said it turned out good but was very expensive (around $30). They ask you how well you want it to be done when you order it. And of course, the meal wouldn't be complete without the cheesecake. I believe we shared the Hershey's Chocolate one for desert. There's also alcohol drinks, such as cocktails. The Long Island Iced Tea was fresh and cold as expected.  Service can be slow when busy like in any restaurant. Server greets at your table and will serve for you for the entire dine. Staffs were friendly. Water cups were filled and complementary bread with butter is always provided after ordering your meal. The place is pricey, but for the taste and quality, I would give it another try whenever I have the extra money."
Judy Y.,"Davis, United States",114,22,49,4.0,28/7/2015,"I love the cheesecake in here, and I also love the pastas. However, the steak for the meals isn't as good as why I excepted. The decoration of the restaurant is very fancy. I came to celebrating my birthday, and I have to tell that the waitresses are nice because they sang birthday song while the cheesecake was ready to serve. So sweet of them :)"
Chris S.,"Round Rock, United States",0,29,,1.0,25/6/2015,"Would not recommend and so over rated. We just wanted to walk somewhere close to our hotel in union square .... Bottom line : So Not worth the wait... And a rude hostess to boot.  Made my way  up to the counter past droves of people waiting where 4 people  totally ignored me and after a few minutes of talking to each other a very tall blond and a short (compared to her) brunette   turned their backs to me .   Can't do that to a Texan who practices southern hospitality!  Needless to say, we bee lined it out of there and went to the spectacular ""hamburger bar"" 6th floor - which outdid the snobby Cheesecake Factory's stinky staff ten fold!  In which I'll be giving them(hamburger bar)  5 stars- the waitress came over and made some small talk - even made the time to give us Texans a few San Francisco tips.  They could teach the over rated, pompous cheesefreaks a lesson on simple hospitality."
Haana R.,"Somerset, United States",5,23,17,3.0,8/11/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night. Wait was okay. Except after they call your number they make you wait again. Service started off fine. But our server, Penny, went missing. We didn't have bread or napkins and kept bugging another waiter who had other tables to take care of. She didn't even check in to make sure the food was okay. Not to mention our cheesecakes were melty and warm because she didn't get them in a timely fashion. Just a sad experience. Shame bc the view was nice and the food was pretty good."
Aldrin C.,"Las Vegas, United States",155,20,6,4.0,8/11/2015,Just be prepared to wait about 45 min to get a table. But let me tell you it was worth the wait for a good food! And experience! My service was the best! Great customer service experience.
