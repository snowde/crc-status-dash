Liv A.,"San Francisco, United States",397,806,1516,2.0,20/10/2012,"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants at all costs, but I ended up here with 2 friends on a weekday evening after shopping in Union Square. Honestly, I don't even like cheesecake. We just wanted something close by and it was getting late so went to the tourist trap. Definietly crowded with tourists left and right. It took us about 30 min to get seated. We had to sit outside bc there were no tables inside. Thank goodness for the overhead heaters otherwise, we would have froze to death out there. Another thing about CF that boggles my mind is that the menu is too big and most of the dishes are a ton of calories.  I ended up ordering the white chicken chili with brown rice off the skinny menu. I had it before and knew that it was decent. My friend decided on a burger and the other one picked some beef dish. Why did our waiter disaapear for 45 minutes? It took another 15 minutes for us to even wave a different server down. We asked where our waiter was and why the food still hadn't come out. The manager comes over and brings us our food. Of course, everything is cold bc it's been sitting there for who knows how long, waiting for the waiter to bring it to our table. It wasn't until we were finished with our meals that he showed up again....not even apologizing for his absence. Unprofessional!  2 stars goes to the honey wheat bread."
Zara A.,"San Francisco, United States",36,86,38,2.0,27/11/2015,Pretty horrible experience. Waited over 2 hours for a table for 2. I always come to Cheesecake Factory so I know what the food and service normally is like. Ordered steak Diane/chicken Madeira and it was served to me cold. I let the server know and she said that she would 'make me a new one if I was willing to wait' which I was. Waited another 25-30 minutes only to be served the same plate which was placed under the boiler.  Thankfully the management handled this issue.
Julie C.,"San Francisco, United States",90,387,1343,4.0,28/12/2010,"I come here whenever I get the chance - mainly for the outdoor, high rise seating view.  It is absolutely breath taking to be sitting on the top floor on a beautiful sunny day in Downtown SF.  You get the breeze, the sun, the nice service and some pretty delicious food. The must orders:  Avocado Rolls as the appetizers, the Mango Raspberry as the drink, and salad of almost any kind... I stick with the Cobb Salad on most occasions.  I use to have the pastas a lot, but then I noticed either the flavors got bland or my taste for pastas here went away.  I believe they have a dish called Bang Bang Chicken here and that's tasty as well.  They also have good desserts. The wait can be quite long - there are days when I've waited for a good 50 minutes, but you get to roam around Macy's while you wait."
Nazanin R.,"Berkeley, United States",2,25,3,5.0,25/11/2015,Service and food are always on point here.  Love the strawberry lemonade and mushroom soup.
Dante R.,"Brentwood, United States",0,8,,5.0,17/7/2016,"I don't write reviews very often, however I had a really positive experience. My son really wanted a milkshake. They happened to be out of ice cream. The young man helping us named Terrell could of easily left it at that. He saw a kid really wanting a shake and he went out of his way to secure some ice cream to make a shake for my son. If only all restaurants had Terrell's working for them. It made my sons day. Thank you Terrell."
Alex C.,"San Francisco, United States",75,141,1154,4.0,20/4/2013,"04/16/2013 Lunch in one hour? Not impossible, doable, one just needs to eat quickly and scadaddle!  Service is extremely attentive, and they will certainly meet your needs - I told my waitress that I only had an hour to eat, and she made sure that I got my good as quickly as possible. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (just as good as I remember it), and a glass of Moscato (MMMMMMM, sweet and satisfy). I also sat near the bar area, therefore, I was immediately waited on. My food came out 15 minutes into service, and with eating, I had 10 minutes to spare - see, it's possible to dine within an hours of lunch on a work day! Yes, this is a chain restaurant, a very good one in fact, and I don't mind being a repeat customer."
Kevin J.,"San Francisco, United States",2508,873,340,3.0,13/3/2012,"Cheese and Cake - somehow separately you wouldn't pair them together and think it was a great combination, but somehow when this fanciful dessert comes together mouths open from far and wide. The Cheesecake Factory dishes out some LARGE portions, so the bang for the buck is bar-none. This particular location is extra special.  Located in the heart of downtown San Francisco on top of Macy's in Union Square - the view alone is worth the trip... and the wait.   If you get the chance be sure to check out the outside patio for the best view.  The Vegetable Salad with Chicken happens to be my favorite thing on the gargantuan menu, but the fried mac & cheese balls.... YUMMY!"
Shaun W.,"San Francisco, United States",139,236,676,5.0,20/9/2014,"They got the perfect location - overlooking Union Square.  It's pretty when sitting outside and if it's cold, they turn up the heat lamps.  My favorites here: Steak Diane and Tex Mex Eggrolls.  Drinks?  Sour Apple Martini and Georgia Peach.  Yes and Yes!  The service is usually good, but beware of expecting quick seating and service when you visit during peak lunch and dinner hours.  I recommend going during off peak hours for best service.  Portions are large  - sometimes so large that you have no room for dessert.  If you have a nice phone and love taking pictures, take some of the food/drinks and post them to social media.  CF follows me on Instagram and Twitter and have reposted my pictures."
Jane N.,"Millbrae, United States",332,196,215,3.0,16/10/2012,"Cheesecake Factory brings me back to my college days when I used to go monthly.  A tourist attraction since it's smack dab in Union Square in Macy's with an amazing view, I never felt the desire to go since I dislike crowds.  But since I haven't had it in over two years, was craving pasta, and it was such amazing weather, why not?   The wait is long of course but it's a sizeable restaurant.   People (specifically tourists) need to chill.  Don't come here if you're going to get mad at why people are standing around or if you're going to elbow your way to a good spot on the balcony.  It's just plain rude and you're just asking for death glares.  But if you do come expecting a wait, might as well grab a cocktail and go outside to look at the pretty lights (if you're going during dinner).  We got the Ahi Tuna Tartare app, Pasta da Vinci, and Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic (not pictured).  Pastas were good and heavy as usual but the app was delicious.  I only wish it came with more chips.  Of course, you can't miss out on their always wonderful brown bread."
Erika C.,"San Francisco, United States",267,923,3169,4.0,31/3/2012,"I have had many meals here.  With a huge menu, everyone has something they can order.  The only major downside is the wait.  There is always a wait.  Four stars, however, for the cheesecake and again, the huge menu where most things taste decent. Once, the bf and I came here and we saw a young Asian guy with an elderly caucasian man.  My bf noted that they were an odd-looking pair of dining companions.  The Asian guy was around 19 or 20, probably Chinese, and wore a sort of mismatched dress shirt and blazer.  He looked out of his element but happy to engage with the old guy.  The old guy looked comfortable and eager.  There was a weird energy about them.   After listening to their conversation, I decided that the Asian guy was a gigolo. That was an interesting evening to eavesdrop.  Anyway, on to the factory food! Fried Macaroni and Cheese - We usually order this.  It's pretty good, and comparable to other places that serve arancini.   Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - Not the best I've had but reliably good. Factory Nachos - I don't like nachos with melted cheese.  Bring on the processed gooey cheese!  Skip. Firecracker Salmon - These are actually really good; we usually order these along with the fried mac. Crabcakes - Not good enough of a crabmeat to bread crumbs ratio.  Skip. Old Fashioned Hamburger and Wild Mushroom Burger - Both are pretty good, both are ginormous.  I can only half of the burger and fries.  I only had it when I was craving a burger, otherwise, there are better burgers to be had.  But not many are bigger than these. Pasta Carbonara, Shrimp with Angel Hair, Pasta Da Vinci, and Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes - That's four pastas up there.  They're all about the same so I don't see a point in separating them out.  It is better pasta than the average chain.  The carbonara and Da Vinci taste better of the four. Steak Diane - This was okay.  What am I doing, ordering steak at Cheesecake Factory?  I don't know, I was craving it and I was curious.  It was just okay, I definitely wouldn't order it again.  I've had better and I've had worse.   Grilled Pork Chops - I don't normally order pork chops, but there is one restaurant in the Bay Area where I really like their pork chop with potatoes gratin and compote, and I've been trying to find something comparable since.  This was not it.  It had a similar flavor (fruit and potatoes) but fell way short.  It's just okay. Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - Ohhhh mannn.  This is SO GOOD.  I don't normally like cheesecake.  This is the one exception.  Cheesecake Factory's fresh strawberry cheesecake.  I used to get this to go and eat it in a hotel lobby or Union Square with a cup of hot coffee.  It is the shit."
Ceni R.,"Santa Monica, United States",0,1,,1.0,15/7/2016,I was pinched by the manager for passing through the wrong section of the restaurant. And she had laugh in her face when i told her behavior was not acceptable.
Maile N.,"San Francisco, United States",287,1464,857,4.0,4/7/2012,"This place is always crazy busy!  In fact, I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory across the country at anytime of the day when they weren't crazy busy.  Either get in line to put your name and party number down and deal with the wait of at least 30 minutes or try to get a seat in the bar area. Love their Chinese chicken salad - lovely, tasty, piled high with rice noodles!!  Perfect with a mojito in the summertime!!  Oh and don't forget to get cheesecake to go because I don't know about you, but I am always too full to eat dessert but I still want it - for later!!  Mmmm! P.S.  It felt so good to finally use the $25 gift card for Cheesecake Factory today!"
Joe R.,"Grand Canyon Village, United States",5,47,8,1.0,2/7/2015,Never go here. This place was the worst. The server did not bring us our drinks nor my wife's salad. Our food came out one item at a time about a minute apart. I then tried to pay at the cashier and she WOULD NOT take my money. We had to pay the awful server. I have no idea why this place is so busy.
Kathy S.,"Tracy, United States",1,3,,1.0,7/12/2015,"If I could give zero stars I would . We put our name in and got a buzzer only to be told we were skipped and to wait by the pillar . After asking 3 times if we were going to be seated , I think to shut me up they finally put us in the corner where we were not recognized as a new table for about 15 minutes . After we were done we waited a 1/2 hr for our bill . We have gone to Cheesecake as a tradition for several years but the past 3 times have been the worst service . Sad to say we will not be using them as our tradition again . We love the service in Pleasanton and will go there instead ."
Joshua W.,"Fargo, United States",0,8,,5.0,9/5/2015,"Amazing food! Must tries are the fish and chips, Americana cheeseburger, and Mac and Cheese Burger! Their burgers are done perfectly the way you ask for them. Also, their fries are good themselves, but ask for their BBQ ranch sauce for dipping-unbelievable! Cheesecake- the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate is a must try! The Caramel Apple Streusel is really good as well! Had great service as well... they get really busy but the servers do a good job."
Moua L.,"Concord, United States",179,356,434,3.0,11/1/2011,"On a Sunday night, this place was still filled with people at 9:30pm. When we arrived on the floor, the place smelled pretty bad.  Going to the bathroom, one of the waiters said, ""it smells like rotten egg here"".  We just laughed about it, because they noticed it too.  After 20 minutes of waiting, we grabbed two seats at the bar instead of waiting for a table. Then it took nearly 20 minutes to get a dessert and freshly orange juice. The Strawberry shortcake was packed with old thawed out strawberries and hard bread.  It wasn't good at all. The one good part of my night was when the waitress offered to fill my water bottle after seeing me try to fill up my bottle with left-over water. That was nice.  I suggest sticking to the cheesecakes, because that is their specialty."
Mae A.,"Springville, United States",9,38,3,1.0,30/12/2015,"Pathetic! Come here to eat some lunch and someone doesn't show up in time for them to open at the normal time of 11:00 am, and decides to open at 2! If I didn't have a gift card for this place I would take my business somewhere else!"
Elizabeth W.,"London, United Kingdom",8,10,,4.0,15/4/2015,"On the highest hill, on top of the tallest tower, there was a cheesecake factory.  Sitting high up amidst the clouds, the people ate their large, cheap meals, and they rejoiced.  They wept when the wait was long and there were so many people that no one had any personal space in the waiting area.  They wept when two steaks were ordered and one came out.  Bottom line Cheesecake Factory is an American staple.  It's kind of sick because its so big, but you have to love it.  Long live red velvet cheesecake."
Caroline A.,"Fremont, United States",10,63,116,1.0,13/8/2015,It's touristy so you expect slow. But no. Slow doesn't cover it. They make you wait with a buzzer and then you still have to wait in line. And other patrons who complain then cut in line in front of you. All this time you get to see the kitchen and plates sitting on the pass for 15-20 minutes. Which is then explained when you are finally seated and your waiter still doesn't say hi for 20 minutes. Yeah... Forget it.
Patrick T.,"Washington, DC, United States",336,836,1839,3.0,8/11/2012,"Never really liked cheesecake factory food. It's okay, nothing special. Really long waits -- they'll give you a buzzer and you can explore the mall downstairs.  Anyway, just look at the name of the restaurant; you come for the cheesecake. There are better dining options in the city for your real dinner. I would skip the dinner and just pick up dessert from the bar. Of course all of their cheesecakes are excellent. I prefer the snickers myself."
