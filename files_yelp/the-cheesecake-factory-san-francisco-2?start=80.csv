Peter J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",83,873,83,4.0,5/15/2017,"So, I ventured into The City to meet Vango/Mom for Mother's Day. This location,one has to enter through the Macy's. The entrance is on the Union Square side of Macy's. Then one takes the elevator to the eight floor to arrive at Cheesecake Factory. This was a rather ideal time. They opened at 9am yesterday, my mom and I arrived shortly after that. We were seated right away. I wasn't quite sure if they have a Brunch menu, but it turns out that they do. I decided upon ordering the French Toast, and my mom chose to have an Egg White Omlette. Jackie was our server in the beginning, she did a fantastic job, and sadly she had to take a brake, and pass us of to Joanne, she was great to. When my French Toast arrived, it was a wonderful presentation. It looks like they use French Bread here. It was served sprinkled with powered sugar, and small amount of diced strawberries on top. Yes, I took a picture, and will include that. It was getting pretty busy because of Mother's Day. This location also has outside seating, my mom and I dined inside. we had just the right amount of food to eat. This location is a reasonable walk from Powell Street Bart. Edgar, yes, I said ""Hi"" to Edgar. The water is a little tricky, you have to stand in just the right place. Overall, I'd have to say that it was a satisfying experience."
S.J. T.,"Richmond, CA",1,13,,1.0,12/17/2017,"If I could give this place no stars I would however I guess yelp is the only one that feels sorry for these places so I'll begin. Arrived at around 1005 am.. Seated at approximately 1020. Had a weird ass Server. Looked like a character from the Adams Family movie... My guest and I didn't receive our food until around 1053... I order the Brunch combo and that includes pancakes.. the butter was hard as a brick.. Eggs were scrambled hard as if they used the concrete on a hit ass day in the south... will not return under any circumstances for this bullshit. Guests who sat 2 tables down received their food within 15 minutes of ordering. Customer service at the counter sucked as well.. cheesecake, step your game up.. I should've just went to McDonalds and got the hot cakes and sausage breakfast with plastic wear."
Fa R.,"Montreal, Canada",25,278,549,4.0,10/14/2016,"I've been coming here for many years and always liked it. Not high gastronomy for sure but many good things: -beautiful roof terrasse over Macy's with a lovely Union Square view.  -Great cheesecakes, dozens flavours to choose from -great healthy menu available  -nice waiters/hostesses  -fair prices -great lunch deals I love the pumpkin cheesecake. They now also have a red velvet one but haven't tried it yet."
Anna B.,"San Francisco, CA",73,8,,5.0,12/16/2017,Sitting at the bar the bartender Bianca is on Fire she's so good. So mesmerizing to watch her work. We had a great time.
Loren C.,"San Jose, CA",304,8,1,5.0,8/17/2017,"After reading reviews of this place on Yelp I was a bit scepticle to take my gf here for dinner. But I'm a huge Cheesecake Factory fan and have gone to several locations and have always enjoyed it so I said why not #trust We arrived on Thursday at 6:30pm. It was relatively crowded, tourist walking around, full staff and restaurant. We took the elevator up and we arrived at the restaurant. We then asked for a table for 2 and were given a buzzer and told it'd be 15 min. I was like whoa, only 15 min??? Well okay. So we go outside, enjoy the view of union square, and in 10 minutes our buzzer goes off. We go inside and hand then our buzzer at which point the lady told us to wait till our name was called. 5 min later my name is called and we are then escorted to our table.  At the table for 2 we were taken care of by our waitress Tiffany. She was super friendly and boy was she fast despite the busy restaurant. She brought our drinks, fresh hot bread within 5 min. She then brought our calamari appetizer out in 20 min and our food in 30 min.  The food was excellent. Our steaks cooked medium rare and everything tasted delicious. We never had to flag down any staff if we neeeded anything as they would always come by and ask if everything was okay. All in all, an excellent evening. We spent about an hour there and left the building by 7:30pm"
David S.,"Union City, CA",22,347,427,5.0,3/6/2017,"My friend and I decided at the last minute on a busy sunday afternoon to eat here.  We thought the wait time would be too long, but to our surprise we were seating within 15 minutes.  I got the Shrimp Louie and it was excellent, and reasonably priced, $14.95."
Mark G.,"Tempe, AZ",0,53,4,2.0,10/5/2017,"I consider myself a frequent visitor to The Cheesecake Factory, various locations. This would be my first visit to the Chandler Fashion Valley location.  As soon as we were seated, our assigned waitress rushed over to get our drink orders but failed to smile or even welcome us to the restaurant. Two short minutes later, she returned with two cups of water and admitted that she forgot what drinks were ordered. I repeated the drink order and she franticly rushed away. I saw a manager walking by and stopped her to request that we be assigned a new waitress only because I wasn't in the mood for a bad service that evening. The manager acted shocked and stated that the waitress serving us was her best. I was truly tempted to leave when I heard that only because the waitress was clearly not the best! The manager quickly assigned a new waiter to our table and he did everything possible to make sure we were satisfied. It is for only that reason alone I gave this location 2 stars. Other issues that were experienced were that the service was extremely slow, my daughters meal was never put into the order and the kitchen came out to apologize, and it nearly took 20 minutes just to pay the bill. Every Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, the wait staff have been top-notch. This locations servers seemed to belong to a McDonalds, not a Cheesecake Factory."
Brittany A.,"San Jose, CA",33,227,110,5.0,3/6/2017,"The cheesecake factory is always a solid place to eat, but this one is my favorite for obvious reasons. The view outside is so amazing! The wait can definitely be a bit much but that's expected for a place like this in the city. We always head up, put our names in and the grab a drink to enjoy outside."
Jess G.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,14,1.0,8/5/2017,"Came in today with my husband for a quick bite. We were seated in only 20 minutes which is by far the shortest time I have ever waited for a table at this location. Needless to say, we were super pleased! That's where the pleasant surprises ended. We were assigned to a waiter named Joshua G. He did not offer us bread, he did not offer us plates, he did not offer us drink refills. When my husband finally asked him for a refill, he returned with a warm soda bottle. Really? We decided we had enough and asked him for two boxes and the check. And he swats my husband's hand like a child and tells us ""not now I'm going to take another order!"" Horrible service. Joshua G, get an attitude adjustment or find another job."
SJ B.,"Vallejo, CA",1,47,6,1.0,1/1/2018,Wait is ridiculous and cashier was rude about my order for cheesecakes. It was just one measly cheesecake!
Suzette C.,"Fairfield, CA",56,83,715,4.0,8/7/2016,"We were all hungry after checking out my sister's Academy of Arts Pre-College summer program exhibit. Out of all the places to savor my little sister chose the Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend parking in a garage (prices range from different businesses) and walking to this location or taking the bart. Parking on the streets in the city can be hard to find. Go exploring after to get your money's worth!  This restaurant is located inside Macy's right where Union Square is. On a Saturday around 1 pm we waited 30 minutes for our outdoor table. Keep in mind you are in San Francisco and in the middle of an endless shopping area. It wasn't a surprise there was a wait. One of the wonderful things that I love about going to the city is listening to the background of tourists who are ecstatic to be here in San Francisco :). It makes waiting more entertaining!  I appreciated the fact that our waiters were still attentive and would ask us if we needed anything else throughout our lunch despite it being busy. Great customer service! Also the dining place itself was very clean and tables were immediately bused when customers left. At chains like the Cheesecake Factory, I tend to order what I know is good and stick with it.  What I recommend: Americana Cheeseburger ($13.95) - This burger consists of American/cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, and secret sauce. A moist burger with ingredients that may seem basic, but coexist to leave you deliciously satisfied until the last mouthful. I find that this entree can be lovingly shared between two people.  Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake- Ever find yourself thinking that your eating cake when your at the Cheesecake Factory? This one is a CLOUD in your mouth compared to some of the flavors that are offered on the menu. The caramel cheesecake isn't taxingly sweet. The caramel mousse and vanilla crust only enhances this simple recipe without overwhelming you and your stomach! Overall this place makes me a pleased customer! I would come back here for a future lunch or dinner."
Jason P.,"San Francisco, CA",74,29,13,5.0,10/6/2017,"My first job was cheesecake ! I know the ins and outs of the culture ! I worked for the company for almost a decade!  I want to let the management know 1. You have a great bar staff.. The strawberry martini is one of my favorites . I also know it is the most time consuming to prepare . When I walk in the door Michael simply asks one or two ( boy friend or on my own ).? The bar staff always makes us feel as if we are guest in their homes. Tonight for the first time we sat in Steven G's section . We came in at the end of the night.  It was obvious the restaurant was filled with tourist. I am going to gamble Steven might have just gotten phased before ,we sat. Steven let us take our time to order . He made us feel as if we were his first guest of the night ..  Cheese cake team ! Michael and Steven hit home runs tonight !! Thank you!!"
Roberto V.,"Southwest Orlando, Orlando, FL",41,2,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Visiting the town and decided to go for something familiar. Bad Idea, the place is disorganized and waiting time is not what they tell you. I was given an hour and end up waiting for 1:30 minutes, just for the buzzer to go off and if you are familiar with with the restaurant you know you have to wait on the side for your name to be called. Got seated and thank got I didn't have to go Thur their menu, however the waitress took about another 10 to come to the table. 15 minutes and counting no bread and we where told it will be 2 minutes for it.  From the moment the buzzer went off till now it's been 45 minutes and no food or bread in site. The sad part it's that today is Monday.  So if you are considering it for the weekend good luck. Not the place to come and expect great service.  Totally disappointing experience"
Allen S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/12/2017,"I don't usually take time to write reviews but, I have to say the service that I received on 12/10/17 around 6 pm from the take out part of the restaurant was incredible! The two gentlemen that where there where very in tune with everything going on even as busy as it was. When I first got to the restaurant I was told that there was a long wait so I went over for take out not knowing what I wanted the guy that took my order explained some of the common dishes and I decided to get the Miso Salmon because of how explained the dish. The food came out with in 20 minutes and was brought to me where I was waited with my Oreo Cheesecake with bread, bag and utensils!  the food was great I was very satisfied. I just wanted to write this review and show my appreciation to the outstanding service that I received."
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,3.0,1/3/2017,"Macys and Cheesecake Factory go hand in hand, with the American chain culture. It's no wonder that they have a CF at the top of Macy's in San Francisco's busiest high end shopping area of the city. It's been a long time since I've been here, high school with my mom for lunch. Even then, we didn't have a long wait because the lunch hour rush isn't as crazy as the holiday, weekend crowd. My family isn't too big on CF, but they wanted to come here for the view.  My twin's birthdays were last Friday, which is the 30th of December. Union Square, Macy's included were still set up for the holidays. We went to Japantown and then we headed to Union Square. I did a Google search for cheap parking around the area and since it was after 6PM, the parking was averaged to $6 total. Whaaaat, that is crazy! I was expecting that we'd be paying a minimum of $20 for the parking alone. Waze took us down a shorter way to the parking lot (because the streets were a parking lot as well) and we arrived about 15 minutes from leaving Japantown.  It was 7:05 to be exact when we went to go put down our names for the wait list. He said that it would be about 3 1/2 hours. We bit the bullet and waited. It was prime time traffic on a Friday out of the city, no way would it do us any good sitting in the car. The time on the ticket that was given to us actually said to be back around 9:56PM, so three hours, take off a half an hour.  By 9:45, we were all over hanging out around Union Square. We had visited the Starbucks on the fourth floor, walked around Union Square and watched some people fall down ice skating. We went to the Disney Store and Old Navy down on Market and still had about an hour to kill before we could even head up. By the time that we went up, it was 10PM. There was a line of people waiting to make a reservation, I suppose. There were other people waiting in a line off to the side, handing their white ticket to the lady behind the counter. Some were seated right away, others were handed a buzzer. I was handed a buzzer. We scored seats in the little room that is between the indoor and outdoor seating. People were out looking at the view, I decided to wait for that until after we were done eating. We waited about 10 minutes before the buzzer started going off. The server that we had was really nice. I don't remember his name, but it took him a few minutes to come around and take drink orders...but once he came by, he was very attentive during our dining. We ordered appetizers, cheese sticks and mini crab bites. They didn't have anymore cheese sticks though and my twins didn't want anything else...so we just went with the mini crab bites.  The time for the food to come out was pretty average, it wasn't that long. One of my twin's daughter's meals came out incorrectly. The waiter offered her a soup or salad on the house, but she didn't want anything. The order came out correctly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered a piece of cheesecake and a few of the waiters came over and sung Happy Birthday to our twins. One of them sung really off key and I thought it was hilarious. I'm not sure if he always does that or if he did it because I said ""they're now teenagers""...but we all thought it was funny. Overall, would we come here for a random night? No, we wouldn't wait three hours to eat food at a restaurant that we could dine at closer to our house. I would say that the dining experience outside during the summer, is probably amazing. Even with the heaters outside, that is too cold for my liking! But the view is amazing and if you like dessert, this is a great place to come. For our time being in the city and what we were celebrating, it was great."
David A.,"Buford, GA",122,167,156,2.0,2/20/2017,"First off know that I dislike chains, but am willing to accept when there is one my wife very much likes, for example the Cheesecake factory. We frequent the Pleasanton location and have been to San Mateo as well as other ones in the US like Austin, TX.  This particular location is packed and disorganized. That can be expected from a tourist trap, but couple it with the poor taste of their drinks and it is not a winning combination. Same drink as other locations, not as good.  And let's get into prices: this location despite their poorer quality had higher prices than San Mateo or Pleasanton! The prices are even higher than that compared to the Austin location even though the Austin, TX location has Texas sized portions!"
Sac M.,"Sacramento, CA",39,180,426,5.0,4/12/2017,Let me just start by saying I will never ever return to the walnut  creek location they should definitely take notes from this location!!!  REVIEW: stopped in for a late dinner I love the fact that they are open late on weekdays this place is always super packed even on a Monday night but it's to be expected because this is the best location with the best view and the best food! Wait time 30 min. Went by fast our hostess was accommodating as I requested a booth  FOOD SELECTION: Louisiana chicken pasta ask for parmesan cheese on top makes it taste even better  ( good choice) sooo good chicken nice and seasoned  sliced thin and cooked in a good sauce I would definitely order it again!!! Drinks raspberry lemon drop and typhoon punch both were very strong P.S. That's a good thing although the drinks are very expensive at least you will be tipsy!!!! the portions here are huge so brace yourself u will be very full especially if u order dinner and appetizers  CONCLUSION: our server JAKE was cool gave good drink and cheesecake  recommendations checked on us made sure everything was good ( unlike the terrible service in walnut creek) we enjoyed a nice dinner with a view and left full tipsy and satisfied we were pleased with everything can't wait to go back and explore the menu they have a nice assortment of food that I want to try this will be my go to place for casual dining
margaret a.,"Aptos, CA",7,51,,5.0,11/22/2017,"Love this place.  High energy, very noisy, younger crowd. We had to wait almost 45 min. which we expected but worth the wait. Staff very friendly, we sat outside and the view is wonderful. It is chilly in the evenings even with heaters so wear something warm.  Great food."
Jessica J.,"Brisbane, CA",0,5,1,5.0,11/27/2017,"It was the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tried ! We've waited a 30 minutes to get a table, because this is popular touristic place, but we've enjoyed an amazing view!"
Erik L.,"Manhattan, NY",8,4,4,1.0,12/10/2016,"**Scam / fraud alert!** The suggested gratuity amounts (15℅, 18℅, 20℅, etc.) printed on the receipts are calculated post state and SF tax, which is incorrect, and a clear effort of fraud.  Tip amounts should always be based on pre-tax amounts. We are not tipping the IRS for their service here.  Effectively, if you thought you were tipping 15℅, you are actually tipping 18℅ (if you go by what they suggest on their receipts). 20℅ effectively becomes 23℅, etc.  This is used to trick tourists. We will not be coming back here --- ever!!"
