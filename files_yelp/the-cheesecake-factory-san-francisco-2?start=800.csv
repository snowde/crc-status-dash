Rex X.,"Berkeley, United States",42,63,92,4.0,4/8/2012,"Half off cheesecake, what what?! Totally there! I invited along my international friend and the two of us set out for the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. The line to get into the elevator was pretty long, so we had to wait a round before we got in. We arrived at the host counter around 6:15pm, and we were told that the wait would be 35 minutes. Not bad!  When we came back, our buzzer vibrated at 35 minutes on the dot, and we were seated outside. Both of us were starving, but we decided to share an appetizer and main dish because 1. I don't eat very much 2. we were told to expect large portions and 3. to save room for cheesecake. That ended up being the wisest decision of the night. We finished their complimentary bread (I prefer the darker ones, very nomnomie), gobbled down the appetizer (avocado rolls, absolutely heavenly), and by the time our main dish arrived we were forced to slow down else risk stomach explosion. My only gripe about our experience at the restaurant was that the servers seemed to be assigned to specific tables, and our particular server was especially busy juggling several tables inside and outside. Thus, when we needed anything, we had to wait until she was available to get her attention. There were literally four servers behind the staff area out on the patio all of 20 feet away from our table staring at us as we tried to signal for the check, and none of them moved. I can understand that the tip we leave won't go to them, but really?  We ordered a cheesecake slice to share (lemon raspberry) and I bought another (red velvet) for a friend. The cheesecake tasted amazing, but is very, very rich, and given the state of our stomachs, we had a very hard time finishing it. I ended up taking most of my slice home. The red velvet slice came in a box literally triple the size of the one that we had to pack away the lemon raspberry. My butthead of a friend decided to not come and claim it for a week, thus effectively occupying one shelf in my fridge for a good 6 days -____-. I obviously need new friends."
S G.,"San Francisco, United States",0,12,,3.0,13/3/2014,"The wait times are borderline ridiculous but what else would you expect at such a prime location in the heart of Union square.  The food has been really good each time we have been there. Their vegetarian burger is really really good, highly recommended.  Also recommend making a reservation and then heading out to their patio to enjoy the beautiful views of Union Square from there."
KT T.,"Singapore, Singapore",0,2,4,1.0,26/12/2015,I was there end Nov and it was crowded. Not quite impressed with their service. Service staff was impatient and not helpful.  Am not sure if I would patronise there again.
Reza S.,"San Jose, United States",25,13,5,3.0,13/8/2013,"So I took my siblings and my cousin to Cheesecake Factory today. It was my cousins first time and it definitely don't satisfy her.  The normal wait was ok because it was nearing the end of lunchtime, so we waited happily for 15 minutes before getting seated. In the meantime, we glanced at the menu to figure out what we wanted. So we ordered, and then they brought the bread. What a horrendous wait! 40 minutes it took them to prepare the food, and it wasn't brought to us together, it came separately. Next my cousin ordered their garlic noodles with no mushrooms..... When they brought it out, there were mushrooms, and also the pasta was sticking together as if it wasn't cooked long enough. Very disappointing in addition to the wait we had to endure.  The tomato, basil and cheese pizza that I ordered was also not worth the wait.  But I do have to say that their fried Mac and cheese was amazing!!!!!! And worth having.  Overall, 3 stars, 1 off for the wait, and 1 off the disappointing experience my cousin had."
A X.,"Oakland, United States",13,48,,1.0,2/3/2014,"Tried their new brunch approach and for the love of Peter, Paul and Mary, what was I thinking.  The brunch offerings were slightly and embarrassment and you'd think TCF would craft a more unique menu when competing in a foodie town like San Francisco.  I'm disappointed to see so many tourists here wasting their dollars and not experiencing the actual positive food aspects that SF can provide; but even more disappointed that TCF is doing their part to continue to deceive a tourists prospects... Service - 1 star Wait time - 1 star Food quality - 1 star Level of shock and surprise at current average - 1 star"
Roxana L.,"New York, United States",70,82,67,5.0,8/6/2012,I absolutely love cheesecake factory!! It's one of those places where you can pretty much order any type of food (burgers/pastas/chinese/mexican/sushi...) which is why it's so awesome :) Most recent visits: -Pastas: I've tried many different pastas they offer and my favorite would be the fettucini with chicken and sundried tomatoes.  The sundried tomatoes = the best! It really gives the whole dish a bang! -Burgers: New found love. Must get the smokehouse bbq burger! This is seriously a really good burger: bacon/onion rings/melted cheddar and the bbq ranch sauce yummm!!  -Blueberry cheesecake was really good too! My favorite part was the crust!! My first 5 star review because I always leave feeling full and happy =) *Be sure to avoid eating too much of the free bread because the portions they serve are HUGE! Save room for cheesecake too.
Kat C.,"San Francisco, United States",773,630,2420,4.0,22/2/2010,"Cheesecake = heart stoppers (literally) Each cheesecake has all-time-high calories in each slice but it's so devilishly good... I'd been craving cheesecake for several months but denied myself the pleasure.  Until one day... White chocolate raspberry cheesecake mesmerized me through the cold display glass until I nearly lost it and jumped over the counter.  I got a 6"" ($20 something?  I know, super expensive... by the slice they range from $6+) all to myself and the guy asked how many ppl it was for. Me: Oh, it's just for me *smile* Guy: Oh.... uh.... that should be plenty... it's good for about 4-5 days in the fridge... Me: No, it'll be long gone before then. Guy: heh... .... oh It was gone in 2 days.  It's a nice treat once or twice a year... *again, the calories are insane... but so good :("
Ryan A.,"San Leandro, United States",39,20,56,5.0,14/4/2012,"So this is my first time visiting the cheesecake factory. I noticed that it was packed, so it must be that good. I really enjoyed the short time it took for me to wait. When I had gotten my seat, Doug the waiter asked me if it was my first time visiting cheesecake factory. Indeed it has been my first time, so he helped by telling me many different things that were on the menu including soups and his favorite. I had some wheat bread that was slightly like a piece of a baguette but it was hot fresh sweet and delicious. My food is hot fresh and prepared to my exact specifications ""medium-well"" and I take my first bite of this flavorful steak and salmon. I felt as though my taste buds were crying tears of joy. It was that good. The Raspberry Lemonade I had ordered was also good. This was so good I got full and I hardly get full. Nice service Nice environment Bring your appetite you won't regret it"
Chelsea D.,"San Francisco, United States",13,160,11,1.0,6/9/2015,"No.  Just no.  I should have known, but my family was in town and wanted to eat here.  Their location makes them packed constantly with tourists.  I ordered the least likely thing to be messed up; an omelet with toast and potatoes.  The potatoes and toast were burnt and the omelet was dripping grease.  Service was terrible.  Our server was difficult to get a hold of, didn't bring us condiments, salt or pepper, and tried to up sell us on everything.  I barely touched my food, though admittedly took a few bites of the omelet.  I was sick 30 mins later and had to uber home.  I hate this place."
Lyn B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,22,161,3.0,25/9/2014,"Bought a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go. Unfortunately, the cheesecake is half red velvet and the bottom isn't ""red"" at all, it's brown and not as tasty as last time I had it."
Oliver D.,"Union City, United States",70,102,61,4.0,13/2/2014,"I'm a big fan of this certain Cheesecake Factory location. I love how it's in Union Square.  If the weather isn't too cold and you're dressed fairly warm, definitely ask the people at the front for an outside table. You get the view of SF and rooftop dining is always awesome. I like getting outside tables during the holidays; you get to see people ice skating below which adds to the warm Christmas atmosphere that time of year. You'll have to wait a while before you can get a vacant seat. They'll take your name and hand you a device which lights up and vibrates when your table is ready. Since this Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of a mall, a lot of people usually go to the floor below because it's a furniture store; plenty of couches to wait in which is convenient. Food really is a hit or miss.  First off, that brown bread they serve you is delicious. Very sweet. Their pasta with tomato sauces are usually pretty bland. My recommendation is to go with a pesto pasta. Pesto sauces are usually hard to mess up if you're a chef and are very tasty.  As for the service, I'm really beating myself up for this because I forgot our waiter's name (This was a couple months ago), but he was extremely nice. Probably one of the best waiters my girlfriend and I have ever had. He was a very young Latin looking kid. Maybe in his late teens or early 20s. I even looked for the receipt before making this review so I can find his name, but I couldn't find it. I think his name was Oscar, but I could be wrong. Give that guy a raise, please. He goes above and beyond. My girlfriend was concerned with the Union Square parking garage because it was past midnight. She asked the waiter if he knew what time the parking garage closes. He said he doesn't know, but he'll check. I thought he was just going to ask his coworkers, but he went ahead and looked for the garage's phone number and called them for detailed information. He did a lot of other kind things, but this review is already long enough as it is so I'll just cut it here. With all that said, this place is a decent place to eat out at. Nice view, great service, and good food. Decent location for date night as well."
Krilevskaya B.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,6,,5.0,11/11/2015,"It's a really good place, if you want to eat tasty food. If you don't want to wait long in the queue it's best to reserve a table in advance. It is a bit expensive place, but it's located on Union square and you can take a table on the roof. The view is just amazing. It's worth it to dine there."
Diane Y.,"San Francisco, United States",132,147,5,1.0,6/1/2014,"They really need to start taking reservations. I showed up there on Saturday night and was told that there would be a 2 hour wait. TWO HOURS? Reservations are so easy. Even computers can take them nowadays, I hear. Through Yelp, even! The food is standard Cheesecake Factory. Avoid the fancier cheesecakes. I got the apple pie cheesecake once and it was stale and tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for a month."
Yalun S.,"South San Francisco, United States",128,18,2,2.0,8/10/2015,"The cheesecake is not bad, but the service is really horrible. The waiter was trying his best to kick us out within 30 minutes."
Oz Z.,"San Leandro, United States",15,75,,4.0,27/4/2015,Very nice place to have lunch in a hot sunny day outside patio looking over the civic center Had great service the only thing that sucks even with reservation you have to wait 20-30 mnts
Carla W.,"New York, United States",0,5,4,4.0,7/5/2015,Great service. Great food. Long wait times to sit inside however we sat outside with the heaters. It's worth going!! Be prepared to pay a lot of you want to have a few alcoholic beverages!
Stephanie C.,"San Francisco, United States",923,479,238,3.0,20/4/2012,"I've been here so many times I've lost count. This was the place to be in high school and I feel like everyone threw their birthday dinners here. The Cheesecake Factory offers an extremely extensive menu filled with anything you could possibly think of and quite a list of cheesecakes! Since I've gotten older, and presumably wiser ;), I've stayed away from chain restaurants. However, every now and then I get a craving for an club sandwich with fries and an iced tea. That's where the Cheesecake Factory comes in. They have such a delicious Club Sandwich! The bread is fresh, the bacon is crispy, and the fries have just the right amount of salt. Their tropical, or passion fruit, iced tea is so refreshing! Definitely one of my favorites. Their cheesecake is delicious but sometimes can be too sweet. You can't go wrong with a slice of the Original! It's really creamy and the sour cream frosting on top is amazing. So why only 3 STARS? The wait to eat here is always AT LEAST 2 hours long! There's hardly enough space to sit and wait, unless you find a spot in Macy's furniture department where the sales reps won't tell you to move, and did I mention the wait time?! Plus, can you really give over 3 STARS to a chain restaurant? With as many delicious and higher quality restaurants in this city, the Cheesecake Factory doesn't really stand out but in terms of consistency and variety they're good in my book!"
Rachel S.,"Alameda, United States",0,8,1,4.0,4/5/2015,I normally don't like barbecue sauce but my friend told me that I have to try the barbecue Salamon in the Cheesecake Factory and it was one of the best Salamon I ate and the sauce was perfect not too much strong I highly recommend and I will give  five star because the amazing service definitely will come back again
Camille B.,"Berkeley, United States",67,145,104,4.0,15/7/2014,"Cheesecake factory is Cheesecake factory. Huge portions, great prices, friendly service and delicious food. What makes this one special is it's location in Union Square. It is several stories up and provides a great view if you get a window or outdoor seat. Be prepared to wait though! My first and only time there, I waited 1h 15min."
