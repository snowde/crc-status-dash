David F.,"Urbana, United States",0,1,,1.0,21/3/2016,Food are great but long wait with at least 1/3 tables are available. What a mgmt style?!
Nadine B.,"San Francisco, United States",13,92,56,3.0,7/4/2014,"Positiv: I like all the cheesecakes there and the have a lot of it. Good place for a coffee/dessert stop in downtown. If you sit outside you will have a amazing view and can relax in the sun. Lunch and Dinner is ok. Negativ: even on the week you have to wait long for a table. Waiting time on the weekends around 1-2 hours, but if you have enough time and can stay that long or go around a little bit in Macy's it is ok. Service is sometimes really slow! Ok I understand the have a lot to do there, but even if you want the check it need so much time.  We don't have the cheesecake factory in germany and every time I come to SF I go there ones for dessert, but only if I have enough time and a good friend with me to talk ;)"
Abhishek Y.,"Philadelphia, United States",117,165,6,5.0,25/6/2014,"Just stopped by to get some cheesecake, and it was a great decision. My buddy and I had just finished catching up at nearby Irish staple Lefty O'Doul's, and we swung by to check out dessert offerings. The place was PACKED, even on a Monday night, and so we just got it to go so that we could enjoy the cheesecake in peace in the Westin lobby (where I was staying). We got the original, strawberry creme, caramel praline, and the mango key lime slices. To be fair, two of the slices were for other people, but we dabbled in tasting all of them along the way. They were all heavenly, and came packaged well with a dollop of whipped cream on the side, and in all, it was a great product. Even with how busy the place was, they were quick to serve us, and while it was pricey, the service was pleasant and they were nice. Further, the only downside is the elevator/escalator ride to get up there, but it's just a minor inconvenience."
Angie W.,"Sacramento, United States",0,1,,5.0,18/12/2016,"We arrived yesterday around 4:30 and talked with the manager Amy about a table for 8.  She said she had too many large parties and wouldn't be able to accommodate us.  This was a 6th annual trip for my friend and I and our 6 kids.  This has always been such a tradition for us to make a day trip to San Francisco at Christmas time.  And having dinner at the Cheesecake Factory is one of the most important parts of this tradition!  When we thought we were going to have to change that after 6 years, it was very upsetting.  I think Amy could tell how upset we were and asked us to give her a minute to see what she could do.  There were so many people trying to get a table at one of the busiest places in SF at this time of year.  She came back to us and gave us an estimate wait time of an hour and a half and handed us a pager.  We were so relieved to be able to continue our tradition!  Amy even came and checked on us towards the end of our dinner.  She was SO amazing and we are so grateful for her amazing customer service.  She truly helped to make our annual trip one of the best yet.  Thank you Amy!!!"
Elena M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,20,36,5.0,4/6/2016,"I love everything about this place except the birds on the table, but what can they do about it. The food is so good. Even long wait does not scare me away from this place."
Sean S.,"Hawaii, United States",10,20,3,5.0,24/11/2015,"Sat night, we arrived at about 5pm & it was already crowded. It was about a 30 min wait but we lucked out & got a table at the bar within a few minutes. Had appetizers, draft beer (limited selection) & of course, cheesecake. The prices, serving size, taste & service were spot on. So, that's why people just keep packing in & are willing to wait over an hour for a table here!"
Angel N.,"San Diego, United States",78,41,62,1.0,15/2/2016,"This review is strictly for this location because I have dined at other locations and have never had a problem or complaint. I understand that this establishment is a popular choice for the tourists because it is located in the mall at Union Square. There is no excuse for management to not be able to control a crowd. Yes, it was a holiday weekend and Valentine's day is probably the most busiest day of the year for the restaurant industry. Be prepared for the crowd and be organized! When I made my way up to the restaurant, I could not figure out who was waiting for a table and who was trying make their way to the front hosts stand. If I could recall, there were probably over 100 people crowding around the front desk trying to get a pager to wait for a table. People were sitting and standing everywhere around the front area and it was overwhelming to just be in the same room with these people. This place was chaotic. I get that many franchise restaurants don't accept reservations because they know they'll be busy anyway, but they need to really find a better system during the holidays to control the crowd!"
Ginna G.,"Citrus Heights, United States",2,12,,5.0,14/2/2015,"Brenda was an excellent,  very amiable host. She made the whole experience very positive with her kind demeanor. Of course the food was excellent too....You will be a very satisfied person if you have Brenda helping you!"
Mimi P.,"Orange, United States",493,708,5548,4.0,15/10/2010,"I am a big fan of the cheesecake factory.  You can never go wrong here.  They have great appetizers, salads, pastas, and fish.  The shrimp scampi is one of my favorites; also try the miso glazed salmon.  The sauce is delish- might be sweet some people tho.  And of course, don't forget about their selection of cheesecakes.   I love the cheesecake factory in SF because of the location.  You can enjoy lunch and take in the city.  Everytime I come up to the bay area, I try to find time to stop by for lunch.  Only downfall is that the wait can take a long time."
Alex U.,"Pinole, United States",65,135,13,3.0,25/7/2014,"There's always a LONG wait here but that is because of the location. It's right in the center of Union Square where all the hotels and tourists like to go. I don't think I've ever waited longer than an hour even for large parties of 10 or more. The menu is HUGE and so are the portions for a reasonable price.  A must order is the avocado roll appetizer and the stuffed mushrooms. Very good! I also like the strawberry cheesecake. My only complaint about this place so far is that the last time I was here, which was a week ago there were a few flies around our table. That was kind of gross but nothing to make me stop coming here."
Cara H.,"San Francisco, United States",3,49,36,5.0,4/6/2013,"In my opinion, the food here is AMAZING.  I waited approximately 20-30 minutes for a table, (so worth the wait!) and when it was time to order, I decided to order Fried Calamari, as well as a Smokehouse BBQ Burger. The Fried Calamari, hands down, was DELICIOUS. It was like heaven in my mouth. When the Smokehouse BBQ Burger finally came right when I finished my Fried Calamari, I took a bite out of it, and that was just as good. The bacon was just amazing.  I'll definitely be back, guaranteed."
Warren C.,"The Beach, Toronto, Canada",196,142,107,4.0,27/3/2014,Expect a wait for a table. Sometimes you can luck out in the bar area and get a table there.  The place is always busy. I really like this place.  The food is very good and reasonably priced.   I would recommend this place to anybody and will definitely return when I am in SF again.  The staff were all great.   A few tips: * Avoid eating the bread and you might have room for dessert * Serving sizes are massive.... don't eat it all and you might have room for cheesecake.   * don't forget to go out on the balcony and take in the nice view of Union Square.
Jungah H.,"Oakland, United States",1,4,,1.0,19/9/2014,"We ordered pizza and pasta. After 20mins waiting, our food finally served. As soon as my mother tried her pasta,she found a strip of paper in her plate!! I asked our waitress to get rid of pasta and said I would like to talk to manager. So manager came to apologize and offered us a piece of cheese cake.  This is going to be my last time coming here. If you want to try free cheese cake,and want to lose your appetite paying 21$,I highly recommend this place to go. :)"
Stephanie L.,"San Jose, United States",105,20,19,1.0,9/5/2015,"This place is so damn disorganized. We ended up waiting close to an hour because the front desk gave our table away to someone else. If I hadn't checked we probably would have ended up waiting all day. Just disappointing, bad customer service. Silverware dirty. Food subpar."
Brooke D.,"Luxembourg, Paris, France",208,164,313,3.0,28/6/2015,"We went on Pride weekend and it was packed. I ordered a dirty goose, pretzel crusted chicken and ahi tuna. The pretzel crusted chicken was good, and would recommend it as an appetizer. The ahi tuna had almost no tuna and was all avocado. Steer clear! The service was great. It's one of the better chain restaurants."
Neil C.,"Martinez, United States",69,16,5,1.0,15/3/2015,"If zero stars was an option or maybe even negative stars that's what they would get. We gave our name at the front. She said 20 minute wait and told us to stay close and they would call us by name. We sat down on the bench behind her. Other hostesses were walking out front calling names. But none ever took the time to actually walk near the ""waiting"" bench we sat on to call names. After 40 minutes I asked the manager why they don't have a pager system and why they don't call names within earshot of the waiting bench. He says they DO have a pager and asks us why we don't have one?! How the hell should I know why I didnt get one? Then he says he himself was walking up and down in front of the bench calling names. Flat out lie!!! The service screw up is one thing. But lying is a whole different level of not deserving my business. DONT GO THERE !!!"
John B.,"Danville, United States",98,437,1626,4.0,3/3/2014,"We had a very nice lunch here. Check out the pictures. The stuffed portobello mushroom appetizer was memorable. Nice location too, Union Square on the top floor in Macys. Great Views from Window seats."
Katie H.,"Fletcher, United States",0,4,,4.0,11/11/2015,"It's a very good place.  The view is beautiful.  We can see the downtown from the terrace.  There are many different cheesecake choices.  It's expensive, but the cheesecakes are very good and it's excellent quality.  People can buy a piece of cake or the cakes for 6-8 people.  It's wonderful for a birthday.  The waiters are very nice too!"
Britt A.,"Westlake Village, United States",0,19,,1.0,12/3/2015,"The service at this location was appalling.  It took two hours to get our food and about an hour for the bill. The view is about the only good thing about this place. Normally the Cheesecake Factory staff at other locations I have been to are on it and really fantastic. Not this one! When the food finally did arrive it was swimming in sauce and was not very good. I ordered a coffee and got it an hour late, needless to say I asked for it to be removed of the tab which took another 30 minutes."
Janet T.,"San Mateo, United States",3279,189,1,3.0,29/11/2014,"Arrived with my two friends.....WHY they don't accept reservations is beyond me. Put our name in at 4:30 and OF COURSE there was a huge wait.  They gave us a pager, we went window shopping & visited. Ultimately we sat down INSIDE at about 7:00pm. The Tree is 83 feet and the lighting was just BEAUTIFUL. Totally. Cheesecake Factory has the perfect location, breathtaking view overlooking Union Square & inside Macys. We started with a cocktail. I had a cosmopolitan and the girls had mojitos. For apps we had the Avocado Egg Rolls (not as good as BJ's) and the Thai Lettuce Wraps (too spicy for me). For mains I had the Shrimp Scampi w/Angel Hair Pasta which was yummy.  Shrimps were tender. My friends had Fresh Grilled Salmon dish & the Hibachi Steak. They said they each enjoyed their meal. For dessert, we each ordered a Tiramisu Cheesecake to take home. Needless to say, the place was PACKED and seating was cramped. Service was semi OK, under the conditions. The CF is a little pricey. The food is mediocre at best. Your paying for the Ambience. Would I come back? Maybe next year, for another Tree Lighting."
