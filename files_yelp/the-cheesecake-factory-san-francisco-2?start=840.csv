Raymond K.,"Dublin, United States",42,24,,5.0,6/4/2015,I love the cheesecake factory! I have been to many locations and I am always pleased with the good food and service. This location even has a cool view of union square and has a Macy's and Starbucks below it if you go during a busy eating time and need to wait for a table.
Sarah H.,"Austin, United States",2,54,16,2.0,21/7/2014,"This was a nice location while on vacation in SF. I loved that there was a gluten free menu with lots of choices. BUT, it's not a confidence builder when the edamame comes out with several noodles mixed in the bowel. Were they prepared in the same container? Used the same utensils?  Who knows?  I asked to cancel my GF pasta order (which still came to the table anyway) so who really knows if The Cheesecake Factory is gluten friendly or not. I didn't choose to find out.  On the bright side, the kids enjoyed the cheesecake."
Hazem M.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,11,2,1.0,21/5/2016,"Mediocre food. Very long waits. But the reason for 1 star is that sever double charged for a dish and when questioned corrected bill, but didn't return my Amex card. I didn't notice till 5 minutes after I left. I called with table number and server name but they said they couldn't find the card. Called Amex and had to report card stolen."
Rachel E.,"Houston, United States",93,938,219,4.0,24/4/2012,"I know, 4 stars? I'm surprising even myself. But seriously, dinner at The Cheesecake Factory Friday night was really good. Service was awesome - like 5 star restaurant awesome. We never had to wait for refills, wonder where our waiter was, etc... There was a 20 minute wait so we ordered some drinks at the bar (I had the ritz martini which was DELICIOUS) and wandered outside to people watch over union square. Great view! I don't think we even had to wait the full 20 minutes before our table was ready. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad which was super tasty! And enormous...  As far as chains go, this is a really good one. Will definitely return!"
Xander W.,"San Lorenzo, United States",451,2,,5.0,15/11/2015,"Excellent and helpful server we got ""Thomas R."" Was not in a mood to smile but this guy definitely made me smile a lot. He made sure to keep a smile on my after I had told have not having a a good day especially due to long wait before seated. 10:30pm"
Vira P.,"San Francisco, United States",336,1141,1134,4.0,28/8/2010,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  You'll always find something you'll like and in big portions.  I now order a bunch of appetizers and small plates when eating with family and close friends.  I find myself feeling full but not stuffed and I have room for dessert. The location is the reason for my rating.  It's at the top of Macy's in Union Square and you can sit outside and enjoy the city.  I was lucky enough to have my party seated right away, because most of the time you need a reservation. If you want to eat here from Fri evening-Sunday, you most likely need to call ahead.  Otherwise, if you're there on a weekday like me, you'll get seated quickly.  But call ahead anyway just to make sure."
Lizbeth R.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,3,1.0,4/12/2016,Me and my family and friends had decided to come here and eat good pasta but instead where disappointed. When we got there there was a long wait and we were okay with this because we understand that it gets busy as soon as we were sat down it took 10-20 for the waiter to take our order she was really nice and had Good costumer service . Except for the Bad food they serve us like frozen pasta or burnt stake They keeps messing up our orders that the FEMALE manager had to come see what we had ordered. When she wakes up to the table she did not great us or ever told us her name she had brought a plate of food that we clearly did not order and instead of apologizing she got mad and gave us attitude when we tried to explain how we did not order the plate of food.  The female manager had told us that it was normal for the pasta to be like that and did not apologize. I think if we would have gone to Mc Donald's it would have been a better expirence and better food .

Salem M.,"Citrus Heights, United States",45,52,8,5.0,25/1/2015,Packed Saturday night. Was told wait time would be 45 minutes. Waited about thirty minutes as I did some shopping. So wait time was no biggie :-) server was on point. Ordered a big Caesar salad as an app for my friends and I and it came within five minutes after ordering! Was pleasantly happy with that. Food came about twenty minutes later and it was delicious!! I recommended the chipotle chxn pasta!!   .. Love this place!
Donovan L.,"San Francisco, United States",39,186,765,5.0,27/2/2014,"Never did I Experience Very Attentive Server ""Jessie""on a busy Touristy Place like Cheesecake.. She showed Honest Opinion with great Knowledge about the Menu with lots of Grace and Style.. Mahalo for the Great service..."
Alicia M.,"Richmond, United States",95,4,,1.0,23/2/2014,"I'm going to have to give this location a one star since I don't have a choice.  Place is just way too crowded and not even worth the wait. My boyfriend decided to bring me here for a first date and the customer service was terrible. When we finally were seated our waitress was nice but rushed us a bit we were there only 5 minutes trying to decide what we wanted. She then came back with another women and told us she would be helping us from that point on because her shift was over. Ok fine. No biggy.  Finally when our food came which wasn't a long wait ... (Weird) considering it's a restaurant and food should take a while to cook, but any who my boyfriends plate wasn't what he expected the rice wasn't cook all they way it was tangy and flavorless his chicken wasn't even cut into slices for him. He said it was plane disgusting. So I told him just let her know and she'll take it back. But at that point because of the wait he didn't want to wait any longer for a new plate. So when the waitress happen to come by us she looked confused because he hadn't touch his plate and had is napkin over it she asked if we were done. I asked for a Togo box and my boyfriend told her he didn't like the food. She asked him with a lot of attitude what was wrong so she can tell the cooks. So he could get a new plate or something else. He told her and she rolled her eyes took the plate and left.  She came back with the check and still charged us for his plate he did not enjoy or even eat! I was ferrous only because any restaurant would know not to do that so I told him to say something to her. So we called her over and asked why would she charge us for something that wasn't good and wasn't eaten? She grabbed the check and with attitude said I'll take it off. Came back with the new check and showed us that it wasn't charged.  In all honesty we figured it's busy crowded and they are just getting people out as fast as they can, but situations like that will give a bad review like this.  We won't be attending this Cheesecake Factory ever Again that's for sure.  Not worth it."
Jade D.,"Santa Clara, United States",8,26,,1.0,3/8/2015,"The one time I visited here I had a horrific experience. First of all, we got to the restaurant and since it was a busy Saturday night, we were given a buzzer and told that the wait would be 45min. We came back once we were called and the person at the front desk told us that they messed up the seating, however, we were next on the list and was offered free appetizers. I thought that it was going great at this point. However what really killed the meal was that the drink I ordered contained small pieces of crushed glass. I didn't realize what it was at first and started to chew on it, but it was sharp and definitely dangerous. We called over our waiter and they gave us a slice of cheesecake to compensate for what happened. We stilled payed full price for the meal. I could have been seriously injured and will never come back again."
Kim D.,"Fairfield, United States",761,337,2691,4.0,14/8/2012,"Came here for lunch and left fully satisfied with PLENTY of leftovers to take home as well. I had the fettuccine chicken alfredo with sun-dried tomatoes and my friend had the chicken marsala with mushrooms over bow-tie pasta, and we were both content with our menu choices. Their lunch specials are something to look into, especially if you want to leave room for dessert.. Which you must! There's so many different kinds of cheesecake options, and they even have low carb cheesecake for those watching their diets. But I say if it's cheesecake, might as well go all the way. And you get a free slice if it's your bday!"
Camille B.,"San Francisco, United States",7,71,32,1.0,24/3/2016,"If only I had the option to not give any stars. It's unfortunate that corporate doesn't even respond to anyone's review. They can care less because they know people will still eat there. Came here during a busy evening for dinner, terrible idea to come if you have 5+ more guest. I was told 1 hour 10 min for a party of 7 @6pm, i was seated at 8:45pm. Why did I keep waiting? The staff kept stating I would be next. 10 more minutes every time once I finally addressed the manager I was seated, I waited 2 hours and 45 min. The waiter was fairly rude and annoyed. Not only was our table wait extended but the main course took 45 Mins, the waiter did not even keep a positive attitude he was just annoyed and kept talking back to us. I didn't even catch his name otherwise I would've addressed it. You guys ruined a birthday. No point in complaining to the manager after the dinner. This review is for you other people. I'll come here again, but just with my boyfriend. Cheesecake Factory, thank you for nothing. My arrival 6:05pm I left 10:38pm wow wtf?"

Melissa B.,"San Diego, United States",6,5,,4.0,18/10/2015,"We only sat at the bar, our Spicy cashew chicken was extra spicy tonight. Love our bartender Gabrielle!!!!! We came here twice during our stay in SF and she was our bartender both times. See her, she's awesome!!!!!!!!"
Linda B.,"San Francisco, United States",94,206,972,3.0,27/10/2013,The first time here the food was fabulous. Everything came out great. I'm a eggs Benedict kind of girl and 2nd time here one of my poach egg was missing the yolk :( the potatoes were too cook and kinda hard. Giving the cheese cake a 3stars because my first experience was great 2nd time around not so good but I will return
Mari S.,"San Francisco, United States",180,199,351,2.0,18/10/2011,"Be prepared to wait.........and wait.........and wait.........and wait.....some more..... and a little more........ I'm not kidding. Cheesecake Factory DOES have good food, big portions and DELICIOUS cheesecake. BUUUUUUT the WAIT is just ridiculous.  Yesterday my Mom & I came to Cheesecake Factory in hopes to have a few drinks and appetizers around 5pm. We got our pager with an estimated 15 minute wait (manageable), then another few minutes wait between the time they paged us back and we were seated (manageable again). But what the real problem was occured once we were seated. We asked for an outside table because it was a beautiful afternoon in the City. Upon being seated, we sat, and waited...and waited...and waited... NO ONE - NOT A SINGLE SOUL came to our table to even GREET US, ask us if we would like water, apologize for the delay, NOTHING.  After about 10 - 15 minutes of just sitting and being completely ignored by servers & all different types of wait staff walking by back & forth (and even greeting a table seated 5 minutes after us), we said ""f*ck it"" (well I did) and we decided to walk out.  I know that Cheesecake Factory always comes with a wait, but seriously, I don't find it acceptable to make a guest wait that long without even a ""hello, your server will be with you shortly"", ""we apologize for the wait"" or  ""would you like some water?"". Bad bad badd. This is the first time I've walked out of a restaurant in years, and HUNGRY too!! Thanks for wasting my time, Cheesecake Factory."

I blame the management.  I only keep coming back with friends because it's one of SF's must come places that has a decent price on food and beverages and a killer view of downtown because I never seem to be satisfied with the food unless it's a burger or salad (food that no one can go wrong with)  Every time i try something different like pastas or rice dishes, the plate comes completely off from the description on the menu! When a dish only mentions vegetables, rice and meat with tomato or white sauce, i dont except it to be watery, almost like a soup! When i read ""sauce"" on a menu, i except the saucy to compliment the dish, not drown the dish (rice dishes and pastas) Trying different food goes completely wrong here so next time i will just order salad or a burger and not be deceived by what they write on the menu."
