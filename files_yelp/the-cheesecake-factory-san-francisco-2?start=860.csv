Leslie Y.,"San Francisco, United States",245,650,585,3.0,4/8/2012,"I have been here a couple of times and now I remember why I usually head to Pleasanton...... The wait is crazy, service is slow and portions are smaller.......there, that tells all.... So touristy, which makes the wait unbearable......people are rude, even in the lines to get a number..... Service is slow cause they don't have enough people working, although my waiter was quite cool..... Portions were smaller than all the other ones I have been to......"
Susana G.,"Hayward, United States",38,11,1,4.0,17/10/2013,"I would come here more often if It didn't take soooo long.  You wait in line to get in the elevator, you wait to request a table, you wait for a table and when you're buzzed you wait in line to tell them you've been buzzed. Once you get to the table, it's a great place.      The  food is delicious, the menu is huge and so are the portions.  You can come here with 10 people and there will be something to satisfy everyone.  Burgers, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, you name it they have it.  You can't beat the views either."
Fernando G.,"Mountain View, United States",0,6,6,5.0,15/2/2015,Not to satisfied with the time waiting BUT GREAT VIEW ! I love your pasta Alfredo !
Marlene C.,"Turlock, United States",7,14,,5.0,7/9/2015,"It was my 1st time eating here & I have to say that I loved it!  I had the chicken panna with broccoli & mashed potatoes it was so good, definitely going back there when I come back to San Francisco! Also had the salted caramel cheesecake which was very decadent but a perfect ending to the meal! Service was a little slow, but I guess it was because it was Labor Day holiday & the place was packed, but overall it was all very delicious!"
Cassie B.,"Riverside, United States",56,18,6,5.0,31/12/2014,"Going in on this dining experience, I actually had a really good experience contrary to most of the reviews I read. I knew there would be a ridiculous wait (esp. with all the holiday shoppers), so I checked in early and came back when they told us (2 people) to do so and we were immediately seated. The place was completely swamped and just mad crazy when we returned but we still got the seats I requested - Outside, under a heat lamp. We had the nicest waiter, who was constantly checking in on us and got us everything we needed. We didn't have to wait long for food and it all tasted great! I'll definitely be returning :)"
Yaron T.,"Brookline, United States",16,13,1,3.0,6/9/2015,Disappointing experience. Very long wait until seated and then for the drinks and food. Very noisy to a level it has become unpleasant. My burrito grande was less than average. My wife's fish taco's was also average. It's not what it used to be.
K O.,"Seattle, United States",0,9,1,1.0,4/9/2015,The server was very nice but the food was terrible. Just look at the amount of sauce in our pasta (uploaded picture). It was as if we ordered soup. Very disappointed. Oh did I mention the drinks had almost no alcohol? At least out waiter was nice enough to take one drink back (he offered to do it).
Darryl B.,"Orange County, United States",645,379,127,4.0,10/11/2013,"The great thing about Cheese Cake Factory, is no matter which location you dine at, they all seem to up to the same excellent standard.  The food is always worth the cost and it always very clean and pleasant with excellent customer service... This location is nice if you want to get away from the San francisco madness for a fee minutes. Patio has some excellent city views.. geez almost forgot, you haveeeeeee to enjoy a slice of cheese cake..."
Shirley M. J.,"Folsom, United States",178,1058,6484,5.0,6/9/2011,"Ok-I admit I am so very weak!  It's Labor Day 2011:  I broke down, resigning eating here again.  Oh, boy~the wait time was 40 minutes, but I waited downstairs in Macy's furniture department testing out the furniture-the chaise lounge chairs, the dining room chairs, beds like Goldilocks without the blonde hair and sans the Three Bears . . . Anyway, I arrived at my outdoor table-windy, but nice-there are propane heaters to my right and overhead.  The breathtaking views from my table are essential supplying a San Francisco-esque added ambiance. Dinner:  Beet/Arugula petite salad, Ahi Tuna appetizer, Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi, Baron De Rothschild Cabernet Sauvignon Wine, Espresso Cafe, H2O, Chocolate Truffle Cake and the standard complementary warmed breads completed my dinner very well. Oooh~I ate too much!  Burp!"
Victoria M.,"San Francisco, United States",0,6,,5.0,9/5/2016,"The waiter was very polite and the food came in a timely manner. Also, the waiter refilled my Sprite without asking!! Pretty sweet."
Zaheem B.,"Elk Grove, United States",104,204,178,4.0,11/4/2014,"The bar staff was nice enough to create a jalapeño margarita for my girlfriend, which did not disappoint. This left a great impression on us and made our dining experience great."
Natalie M.,"Antelope, United States",1,29,19,5.0,31/8/2015,"Really good service and excellent food! We sat outside and got the most gorgeous view! It was pretty packed but why wouldn't it if you get such an amazing view! Very clean and even though there was a lot of people, we still got our food in in a decent time! Defiantly will be back again! My husband and I enjoyed it! The outside got a little chilly but they turned on their heater things so it was perfect :)"
Nancy K.,"Sunnyvale, United States",37,87,10,3.0,5/6/2014,we went there on Monday around8 pm the lobby was not busy at all we were a pary of 8  and the front desk said the wait is approximately 2 hrs . which ithought was ridicuolous because i could see the empty tables around me . So after waitin 45 mins i asked them how come we have to wait there are tables outside that are available and the server said becuase they cannot sit more than 6 outside i felt that hard to believe . Anyways the food was ok . The service was really slow as i said it wasnt busy at all but the servers were taking there sweet time.  In the future i would think twice before i go to this particular location because i have 2 CCF close to my house . the only reason i like going to this one in particular is becuase of the view . . But the servicehas gone down a lot ..
Miranda B.,"Alamo Heights, San Antonio, United States",3,27,5,4.0,26/2/2015,"4 stars because the wait took FOREVER! But the view outside was worth it. The food was also pretty good, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo w chicken- pretty good. Sad I didn't get to try the cheesecake!! Next time"
Dominic F.,"Redwood City, United States",40,12,1,5.0,5/3/2015,If you don't mind a wait. The outside tables are a gem. Never had a bad meal there. My favorite meal is the bistro shrimp pasta.
Toni S.,"Daly City, United States",3,30,29,1.0,28/3/2015,"This place is a tourist place with a great view, I'll give them one star for that. But I guess due to their popularity as a tourist attraction they do not care about their repeat customers. I ordered the chicken Cesar's salad which took quite a while to be served only to find the chicken was room temperature and tough as a piece of leather. I let the female server know and she returned it and brought it back. What they did was just reheat the same piece of leather and brought it back with the now dead lettuce. I let the server know but after this we never saw her again and she had a look of irritation on her face and said, yes they precook the chicken to ""prep"" it for serving. She said she would remove the chicken charge of $3.00????? Wow, really? Then a male server finally came back with the check and said the manager had told him to just remove the chicken charge and that there was nothing he could do. The manager couldn't even bother to come to our table. Really unprofessional and lousy food and service for the price you pay just for a view of union square. Avoid the hype here and go somewhere else as there are plenty of restaurants who will give you a better value and much better service. This place has really gone downhill."
Z M.,"Oakland, United States",0,9,1,1.0,19/11/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory gets zero stars from me! I called to place a order for pick up for me and my co worker for lunch. The person I talked to after I was on hold for so long took my order  for the old fashion burger and kept saying the classic burger she got my order right but not my coworker with her burger she fast talked me to get off the phone and didn't ask for the name that will be picking up the food. me and my co worker kept getting placed on hold and all we was trying to do is make sure they can fixed the order long story short they almost didn't give us the fries that came with  the burger, and the burger wasn't even done when we got there! On top of all that she didn't give us the old fashion burger she gave us the classic burger!!!!  I honestly believe she knew what I was saying on the phone and wanted to charge us more for the classic burger!!!! Lunch been over and We are almost off work thanks a lot Cheesecake Factory!!!! I've been a loyal customer for years and brung friends here and they loved this place too but I don't think I will be coming here again!"
Mark D.,"San Francisco, United States",3,7,3,4.0,5/5/2016,Best tourist area to eat at and especially the food and servants are always nice.
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, United States",1464,987,1073,4.0,22/12/2011,"Located on the SEVENTH floor, and from the SEVENTH floor, take another escalator to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY FLOOR. Hour long wait is typical, go ahead and sit on the couches on the SEVENTH floor in the meantime if you wish.   We were seated in the patio, after having been given a choice.   I ordered the Flying Gorilla Milkshake -- which is basically chocolate / banana milkshake with chocolate bits and fluffy whipped cream... I've actually never ordered a milkshake at a restaurant before so this was new... oh and they also add a (brand?) ""banana liquor"", so a SMALL bit of spike... Also ordered the Asian Pear Martini... the coloring of the drink looked a bit ""dirty"" and there were also those small baby seeds characteristic of pears in the drink, but just made it have a thick texture (thick for a martini, ironic).  Taste was wonderful.   The waiter was nice enough to bring out two breadbaskets, one after another.  Not all of us ordered food at the table, and he was understanding of that.   Plenty of heat lamps all around, very very comfortable.  Don't mind the draft, you don't feel the draft when situated under a majestic metal heat lamp...  They have over 50+ desserts (cheesecakes, only?) on their menu, as the waiter was quick to point out...  ***FYI: And, for a limited time only, you can receive a complimentary slice of cheesecake with the purchase of a $25 gift card to be redeemed at a later visit starting 12/26/11."
Janine R.,"Sacramento, United States",5,19,13,3.0,4/1/2015,"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory then you know what to expect. It's your typical run of the mill chain establishment albeit a bit more upscale with a myriad of menu options. This one in San Francisco however, offers that city by the bay nostalgia. The outdoor balcony offers an excellent ambience, especially in the winter when you can overlook Union Square's beautiful and massive Christmas tree and the ice skating mishaps. The heat lamps help keep the cold at bay, but if that doesn't keep you warm there's a variety of alcoholic beverages on the drink menu to warm you up and put some hair on your chest.  The only reason why I've given this one 3 stars is because you can never eat here without at least a 45 minute wait for indoor or outdoor seating. Also, the bar ran out of Asian pear martinis, Mai Tais, and Moscow Mules. Really, 0 for 3!?!  If your in a hurry and it doesn't mean that much to you to sit outside, it's best to wait near the bar and grab a seat once one becomes available.  Overall, I always enjoy the food, and like the fact that the menu offers enough options so that I can always try something different."
