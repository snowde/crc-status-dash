Cali L.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,3,,3.0,3/5/2016,"Went with my family on a weekend dinner, the wait time was 45 minutes. Three stars for the ambience and the service. The food including the cheesecake which I had for dessert was mediocre. A good dinner for two would set you back by $100,so definitely not worth the price."
Shari H.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,15,1,1.0,25/3/2015,"Unaccommodating!!! We wished to dine at this location on our upcoming trip due to the recommended views of the city.   We have a party of 11, however, the host informed us we would possibly have a 2 to 3 hour wait for dinner at 6PM.  With a party of 11, I can hardly believe Cheesecake Factory would not accomodations and give us reservations!   In fact, the host told me I should plan on coming at 11:00 AM if I want a table for 11.  Many choices on where to spend my hard earned money in San Francisco and Cheesecake Factory will not be one of them!!!!"
J M.,"Los Angeles, United States",25,25,10,2.0,19/10/2013,Ordered Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken and got Alfredo soup.  BLECH!  Service was mediocre at best.  Only halfway decent thing was the cheesecake.  I'd recommend another place over this one.....definitely NOT worth the wait!
Mat U.,"Hayward, United States",1,11,,4.0,17/8/2015,"Normally don't have the patience hence I get a to go order. It's the second time that I had their kaluha cheese cake, Oreo and mango. The Kalhua is paired very well and is awesome. Must try once."
Peter S.,"San Gabriel, United States",11,44,36,4.0,8/6/2015,It's Cheesecake Factory. The same flavor and quality no matter which one you go to. The only bad thing here is the elevator.  About 2-3 rounds of wait to get to the top during peak hours.
Ericka M.,"Lakeshore, San Francisco, United States",18,40,20,4.0,20/7/2015,"Long waits yes, but what do you expect when it doesn't take reservations? Very solid food, when it comes to it being a chain restaurant. A friend who was visiting from Australia and I walked in, we waited maybe 30 min max, before we were seated. We ordered guacamole to start and it arrived quickly. She had the eggs with potatoes & toast, and I had the chicken di Pana, both were nothing short of delicious. There were no service issues, and the food was delicious. See you again sometime !"
Kaylie L.,"San Francisco, United States",15,9,4,5.0,14/9/2015,"Ahem! Love this place! The bacon cheeseburgers are so good! The patty is tender and juicy, the bacon is crispy and the cheese stretches out when you bite into it. The Hershey's chocolate cheesecake is yummy too! It's sweet, creamy and rich. I never like cheesecake but I would eat it if it was from Cheesecake Factory! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The service is amazing and the interior is really nice! I would recommend this place!"
Tam F.,"San Ramon, United States",489,1397,253,3.0,8/7/2011,"I have been to many a Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I have been to them often and for the past year have basically only one thing I order-the miso salmon with brown rice. It is delicious, it is filling and I can eat it without any problem (I have esophagus issues).  Last weekend, my husband's aunt and uncle were staying in Union Square while visiting from Page, Arizona. We only had a small window of time to see them on Sunday mid morning before the aunt had to attend a 5 hour long opera. Yes, I did say a 5 hour long opera. She is a French horn player and well, music and opera are her thing. Anyway, we decided to meet here as it was an easy choice, nice location, had plenty of places for us to park and we all like it enough.  We all arrived at the same time and took the packed elevator up together. Had I known the famed Burger Bar was right across the hall, I would have wanted to try that but alas we were committed and had a reservation. We were seated outside in the shade and well, I already knew my order. The aunt and uncle shared an egg brunch dish, the husband had steak and eggs, and the daughter had her standard turkey burger which she loved.  Service was hit or miss. Our drinks were hardly refilled, we felt a little cramped and a bit rushed. My salmon was fine but instead of it being plated beautifully with the rice molded like the other locations too, this time, the rice was basically plopped in a big mound and the salmon was on top. It tasted fine but the presentation was just not there.  LIke all other CF's, there are definitely not enough lady bathroom stalls available. 3 stalls for a big restaurant all that seemed to be without toilet paper is just not sufficient. Luckily, being the kind of gal I am, I had some kleenex in my purse so after waiting in line to use the potty, I didn't have to ""drip dry"".  With all the other restaurant choices in the area, I doubt I would come back to this location for just a regular thing, but when seeing out of towners it was just fine."
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, United States",676,953,2057,5.0,28/8/2009,"5 stars for the gorgeous view overlook downtown. By far my FAVORITE cheesecake factory. (Check out my photo!) - Taken with my camera phone and still breathtaking. The city lights are worth the 30 minute wait for an outdoor table on a thursday night. Just buy a drink at the bar inside and step outside to the waiting area and catch up with good friends! There was a place to put my Haywire Hefeweizen down as we waited for our buzzer to go off. Yes, this place is crowded, but it's in the middle of downtown San Francisco, it's only expected! And thank you to our waitress who cracked jokes with us all night. I ate so much of their ""brown bread with oats on top"".. you know what i'm talking about!! The one that no one actually knows the name of. I had enough slices that I had to opt for the Thai lettuce wrap appetizer. Not my proudest moment as I should've gone with my gut feeling, the avocado eggrolls, but it was a large serving for an appetizer. Here are my usual favs from Cheesecake though: -They have a great lunch pizza + salad deal (you certainly get what you paid for) -Pasta Carbonara -The Club sandwich (I like my thin crisp fries) -All smoothies are great -Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake"
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, United States",749,1031,606,3.0,19/7/2011,"Oh my, do I want to love this place..... I have been waiting YEARS to try this place and ofcourse my first experience has to be on an overly packed weekend. I had been to the Cheescake factory in Vegas and Henderson Nevada many, many times though, have always antisipated going to this one. Located on the top floor of Macys, this is a prime location for a restaurant such as this. Decor and ambiance is beautiful and majical as of most Cheescake Factorys however, it was overtaken by the herds of irritable rude people cramed together waiting to be seated. We arrived around 5:50 and were told we would have to wait 50 min to be seated (ofcourse) so, being there was no seating area available in the bar area, we stood and people watched as we waited to be seated. I ordered a glass of 14 hands merlot wine which was nice and I did appreciate the fact that the bar tender was nice enough to let me sample some wines as well. We were seated out side in the patio area overlooking beautiful S.F. I ordered the Mederia chicken which is one of there most popular chicken dishes it is Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese- Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce. It comes with mashed potatos however, I opted for steamed brocoli instead and my bf ordered some sort of clube sandwhich. The service was understandably slow though, sincere and friendly. Our food arrived classically generous in portion though nothing exceptionly appealing. My chicken dish was actually quite tasty (not one of the best dishes I have had at the factorys) though, still very satisfying. My bfs dish looked incredibly delish and apparently was quite good. Overall, food was ok, ambiance was great, however the crowd and the chaos was just unbearable. Can't say I am desperatly eager to come back any time soon."
Harsha G.,"San Jose, United States",531,562,1332,3.0,24/8/2011,"I can have a cheesecake coma!  But, is the crowd, the long wait, the negligent staff (especially when you are waiting to grab your cheesecake to go) truly worth it? Not counting the punishable calories.. The staff has messed my order twice. They have served people after me in the line or completely forgotten my order when I had to show them my bill and question them as to why I waited for frickin 45 mins for a single slice of ultimate red velvet cheesecake.."
Carlos L.,"Norwalk, United States",2,2,,3.0,8/8/2015,The food is good but the this place is very dirty. My girlfriend's glass was dirty with hard crusty food. I received ice with black stuff in it.
Kevin C.,"Las Vegas, United States",774,291,184,3.0,3/8/2011,"Best quality about this CF location? The view of Union Square and the park, especially at night, on the balcony. What a prime location! Now that is also the downfall of this place. It's so prime, that the waiting time is ridonkulous! Waited nearly an hour for a table for two. It could have been longer but since we said we would sit 'first available' we got sat outside. It isn't that bad since there are heaters and such out there.  You take the elevator from the ground floor of Macy's to get to the lobby of the CF. There's also escalators that run directly into the department store. After deciding not to trek to Little Italy from our Union Square hotel for dinner, CF seemed like a decent place to grab a bite to eat.  I do love the big portions and I'm in love with their new pasta, Chicken Bellagio. I believe it's a spinach pasta with creamy pesto sauce, topped with arugula and bread-crumb crusted chicken with proscuitto. Yum yum yum. Pricetag for this place is definitely a bit high too."
Jenn B.,"Oakland, United States",902,603,209,4.0,31/3/2012,"I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of girl, but Fridays are no meat days for Catholics and I had a voucher for a free slice of cheesecake (buy gift cards and they'll give these to you as a bonus!), so I figured I'd have a ton of options at Cheesecake Factory, with its novel of a menu. I usually get the grilled cheese sandwich but I knew I was going to order myself a slice of cheesecake so I decided to be healthy and order from the skinnylicious menu. The ahi tartare is listed as an appetizer, but I knew I was at CF, home of ridiculously large portions. My assumptions were wrong. This appetizer is definitely more of an appetizer for one, or maybe two. It was surprisingly small. I made up for it by inhaling a slice of dutch apple cheesecake, which was justified in my head because it had fruit. (HEALTHY!) The place was packed but there were several open stools at the bar and the servers there were attentive as can be. In and out in well under an hour."
Dennis Y.,"Honolulu, United States",12,73,8,4.0,30/3/2014,"Man, we got lost finding the front entrance (we're from Hawaii), guess we weren't really paying attention that it was inside another store (Macy's, as we only glanced and saw the sign while driving around Union Square). We headed for a really late night dinner this past Thursday (after sightseeing and then resting at the hotel, 55 Park Wyndham), walking towards the place about 10:10pm. My phone gps is saying we are there, but 'saw' no Cheesecake Factory, so we walked around the block again, seeing Macy's looking closed (even though their neon sign is saying ""open tonight""). Tried calling, but no pick up after 7 rings, so decided to walk around the block again. Tried calling this time and finally someone said yes, they were open and was located upstairs..We go by that entry and finally see security guards by the elevators (no one was around the first time, so we thought our info was wrong about the location or hours), and went up. Mind you, it is now 10:25pm, and it suppose to close at 11pm.  Thinking don't think they really will close at 11pm as there were so many people still waiting, we finally get seated about 10:45pm... Wife orders soup, but waiter says don't think they have any left, but would check anyway.  I order the cuban sandwich and son orders the shepard's pie.  Bread is provided, tastes good (always like their breads), and he comes with the soup! Says no charge, it was the last serving and wouldn't charge us!  My first time to eat a cuban sandwich, and love it...people around and it's 11:20pm...including us...they don't rush us out... Cheesecake slice was $7.50, with a big wallop of whipped cream - that was delicious too. Good service and foods, and the mens bathroom was nicely maintained at that time of the night.   Just need to make it more visible to patrons that the restaurant is open (somehow)--don't assume like we did that as there weren't anyone on the ground floor, we thought the doors were locked."
Irma S.,"Fremont, United States",4,23,1,1.0,9/5/2015,"Terrible service!!! Checked in to sit outside, lady said 15 minutes. I noticed that people who came after us are getting seated first. So I went back to check in again and said that my name was out looked and she apologized for the inconvenience. She said to wait another 15 minutes!!! Ridiculous! If I knew that it was gonna take half an hour I could've chosen to sit inside instead of outside. I have 2 toddler boys that are hungry!!!"
Lejla M.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,1,,1.0,5/11/2014,"We came here for a sunday   was my idea. We were walking around Union square and were really hungry. Got there around 14h and waited  half an hour to be seated. We orderd our meals and they were on our table in the next 30 minutes. I orderd pizza with grilled chiken, pesto and 3 diffrent types of chees without peppers. When i got my pizza it look kind of strange but i took a bite. I ve called for a waiter to check te menu  and ingredients again because i was convinced i was not eating chicken.  It turned out i was right. I got the wrong pizza. WITH PORK!!! Wich i don t eat since i am a Muslim. I was really upset. The waiter came and said i did get the wrong pizza and brought the chicken pizza i have orderd but with peppers. WRONG AGAIN!  Manager came and appologize. Asked if i wanted another pizza and that i will not be charged for that. Ofcourse i said No. Iwas emotionaly hurt but they did not get that. They were realy rude and did not show any regret.  When we got our bill , everything was there just not my pizza. We did not get anything. not a discount not a complementary cake, nothing... Just a ruined afternoon for me. I was really really hurt because it was a big deal for me and they did not care a bit. Never ever going back! Such a dissapointment."
Mindy C.,"San Francisco, United States",13,18,9,3.0,18/8/2013,I have no idea what the hype is about. I guess you can say that the cheesecakes are pretty good (I personally think it is FAR too sweet) and that the servers are great but the entrees and front desk are not good. Prices are kind of outrageous for those tiny portions. They don't even taste all that great. The best dish I had was probably that veggie pizza and sweet potato fries. The front desk people are plan busy. Understandable that you want to move the line but you could at least smile and seem more friendly. I definitely would NOT go back even if Safeway has more Cheesecake Factory gift cards for sale
Alanna R.,"Los Angeles, United States",283,114,3,3.0,17/9/2013,"Stop hating. You get good chain restaurant quality food and a lot of it. The view does get old, but its better than nothing. I go here from time to time and I am calmed by the familiarity.  Another plus: the quality is so consistent. That's more than I can say for a lot of other places.  The wait sucks and so do the tourists. But I guess that's the price you pay for living in SF."
Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, United States",355,482,337,3.0,12/3/2012,"Been here several times for dinner, and the line is always horrendous, can be 2+ hours.  I went here the first time for dessert though, and it was such a nice change!  First off, it was quiet (10:30pm).  I arrived first in my party, and I asked how long the wait would be.  They offered seating me now or whenever we all arrived, no wait!!!   Tons of cheesecake to select from, and tons of drinks to choose from, which can be a good and bad thing.  It took me forever to finally decide.  The nice thing was the waitress gave us their infamous brown bread (has oats on top which make it sweet!) which was nice to munch on while deciding. I liked my Peach blended drink, but I didn't taste any alcohol in it =/  it was delicious but not sure if it was worth the $10.50.  Got cheesecake  (30th anniversary) which I enjoyed.  Our waitress was hilarious - she gave us the wrong # of boxes, then one of my friends decided to eat the rest of his cheesecake.  The waitress said, ""He's gonna go big, then go home.""  Haha! I know the staff has always dressed this way, but I find the all white top/bottoms and shoes to be quite tacky."

I ve called for a waiter to check te menu  and ingredients again because i was convinced i was not eating chicken.  It turned out i was right. I got the wrong pizza. WITH PORK!!! Wich i don t eat since i am a Muslim. I was really upset. The waiter came and said i did get the wrong pizza and brought the chicken pizza i have orderd but with peppers. WRONG AGAIN!  Manager came and appologize. Asked if i wanted another pizza and that i will not be charged for that. Ofcourse i said No. Iwas emotionaly hurt but they did not get that. They were realy rude and did not show any regret.  When we got our bill , everything was there just not my pizza. We did not get anything. not a discount not a complementary cake, nothing... Just a ruined afternoon for me. I was really really hurt because it was a big deal for me and they did not care a bit. Never ever going back! Such a dissapointment."
Mindy C.,"San Francisco, CA",13,18,9,3.0,8/18/2013,I have no idea what the hype is about. I guess you can say that the cheesecakes are pretty good (I personally think it is FAR too sweet) and that the servers are great but the entrees and front desk are not good. Prices are kind of outrageous for those tiny portions. They don't even taste all that great. The best dish I had was probably that veggie pizza and sweet potato fries. The front desk people are plan busy. Understandable that you want to move the line but you could at least smile and seem more friendly. I definitely would NOT go back even if Safeway has more Cheesecake Factory gift cards for sale

I go here from time to time and I am calmed by the familiarity.  Another plus: the quality is so consistent. That's more than I can say for a lot of other places.  The wait sucks and so do the tourists. But I guess that's the price you pay for living in SF."

I liked my Peach blended drink, but I didn't taste any alcohol in it =/  it was delicious but not sure if it was worth the $10.50.  Got cheesecake  (30th anniversary) which I enjoyed.  Our waitress was hilarious - she gave us the wrong # of boxes, then one of my friends decided to eat the rest of his cheesecake.  The waitress said, ""He's gonna go big, then go home.""  Haha! I know the staff has always dressed this way, but I find the all white top/bottoms and shoes to be quite tacky."
