Mike V.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, United States",0,3,1,1.0,29/8/2015,Worst service ever. Slowest service. I had to wait 1 hour when they told me it's only 40min then we sit waiting for another 30min to have someone bring us water. I had to speck with a manager to let her know about the situation but that didn't help because now we're waiting for another 30min to eat. Go to different restaurant in this same area. Other locations have better service then here at the Macy's.
Anonymous P.,"San Pablo, United States",1,272,477,5.0,14/6/2013,"Damn how long has it been since I've been here to this location?? Well before Friday's dinner date with my girlfriend, it was about 9 years ago since I've been here so it was time once again to explore ;) Always a wait bc well it's the Cheesecake Factory. A tourist attraction and a definite hotspot for drinks and cheesecake!! Ooo a BEAUTIFUL combo I say!!  We ended up finding a table by the bar, yes we LOVE our alcohol and we're damn proud of it too. Our waitress *sorry sweetie I forgot your name* was sweet and attentive to our every need. We were offered complimentary bread and decided to have more drinks. My gf decided on the Pyramid Beer in a Short Glass and I decided on my girly drink and went with the Georgia Peach blended with alcohol drink. *I'm not a big fan of beer but the Georgia Peach definitely hit right spot. Light alcohol blended to make this drink fruity and oh so sweet!! Now for appetizers we decided on on the Asian Chicken Wraps; YES I was on a healthy streak. Tender chicken pieces, veggies layered into a big ol lettuce made this appetizer a HEALTHY yet AMAZING tasty snack. My gf also decided on the Grilled Bleu Cheese and Pears on flat bread. *Now I'm no fan when it comes to bleu cheese but with sweet pears on this flat bread was a must try for my belly.* Sadly we were too stuffed to try any cheesecake but next time I vowed to trade in my alcoholic needs for my sweets addiction just to satisfy one of my cravings..

Jennifer J.,"Eugene, United States",2,12,7,4.0,29/4/2014,"We got in quick, the food is tasty and predictable from location to location. It's a great place for lunch and a view of Union Square. There are so many great restaurants in San Fran you feel a bit guilty eating at a chain restaurant but I enjoyed the experience. Also the staff was friendly and can give great advice for us tourists!"
Jenelle B.,"Northwest, Portland, United States",167,92,178,2.0,5/1/2014,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory a lot and I was very surprised at how horrible the service we received today. Party of three celebrating my brother's birthday. 45 minute wait to be seated as usual in downtown San Francisco and after being seated it took a while until our waitress decided to come by the table and ask for our order of drinks. After that was done, we waited and waited for what seemed like 20 minutes until we actually received our waters and basket of bread.  This rating mostly has to do with the service we received today. If better service is given in the near future then I will update my review.  If you do not mind the wait at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory then I would definitely suggest this restaurant as an option. I hope you receive better service than we did. Must be a new waitress."
Jen H.,"San Diego, United States",334,1885,187,4.0,20/2/2012,"Solid 3.5 stars, but I bumped it up 0.5 star b/c of where we were sitting! I really enjoyed sitting outside in the balcony even though there were a few annoying birds flying around while we were eating.  Nevertheless, the view was breathtaking. I came here for Sunday Brunch. Ordered: 1) Lunch portion: Louisiana Chicken Pasta: 3.5/5 ; I would've given the dish 4 stars if the thin pieces of chicken were not breaded and fried---i didn't even taste the chicken 2) Strawberry lemonade: 3/5--pretty good and free refills!! I skipped out on their delectable cheesecakes because I was saving my stomach for another dessert place, but when I got there, there were 25 people out the door--so no dessert for me that day :( Now, i regret it and should've ordered a piece togo!"
Thomas D.,"San Francisco, United States",232,652,729,4.0,9/4/2012,"Had a great lunch here today after shopping at Macy's Mens' Store around the corner.  The service was excellent.  We sat in the bar area to avoid waiting for a table and couldn't have been happier there.  It's the same menu without having to wait.      I ordered the white bean hummus with seasoned pita bread strips to start things off.  I forgot how generous the serving sizes are at the Cheesecake Factory.  (The last time that I ate at one of their restaurants was last August while I was in Honolulu).   The hummus was very tasty. This starter could have fed 4 people.  We had the rest packaged up in a ""to go"" container. I had a passion fruit iced tea with my blue cheese/bacon burger.  They refilled me 3 times.  The burger was excellent and cooked medium (as I ordered it). And, it was still warm when served!  The accompanying fries were good as well. Opted for the low carb cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream for dessert.  (low carb cheesecake??--really? )                                                          I wish they had a wheelbarrow to roll me out of the restaurant when we finished lunch.  The amount of food that we ate was sinful."
Jenelle H.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,1,,1.0,15/8/2015,Terrible. Waited over an hour for a party of two (promised a 60 min wait). The hostess station was the most stressful disorganized chaos I've ever experienced at a restaurant. I will never eat here again. The wait and the chaos at the front of the restaurant ruined the dining experience. There are so many ways to make seating guests at tables more efficient. It's baffling that this restaurant gets any business with how poorly the customer service is and how terrible the wait/seating process is.
Faith A.,"New Orleans, United States",206,508,366,3.0,28/7/2013,"I try to steer clear of chains and try to find the local eateries, but I could not find anything else in Union Square and I was on the verge of pass out starving so in a moment of panic I swung up the elevator in Macy's to eat. The service was great, very attentive, but did not rush us when we had to read the 20 page menu. What's up with that by the way? they couldn't decide what kind of restaurant to be so they decided to be all of them in one? The food was 2 stars, but the service bumps this place up another star."
Frank R.,"Bend, United States",1,88,1,4.0,14/1/2015,"I love cheesecake. It was a very nice experience. We had coffee and Cheesecake. Nothing more and not a thing less. ASHLEY was an awesome server. Happy, professional, and prompt... The outside patio area looked nice as you overlook Union Square, but then The Birds arrived. Pigeons and Gulls, oh my."
Natasha N.,"Los Angeles, United States",6,10,1,4.0,15/9/2014,"The best thing about this cheesecake factory is their location, right in the heart of union square giving you a nice view right below of all the hustle and bustle. The food as compared to other locations is pretty decent, wait staff is attentive and frequently stop by to ask if you need anything.My fav dish is the jamaican black pepper shrimp and it didnt disappoint at this location either. After a long day shopping/sight seeing its a nice treat to yourself. Deducting a star for wait time which seems to be a norm at mostly all cheese cake factory locaitons."
Gaby J.,"San Diego, United States",317,194,218,3.0,30/3/2012,"3 1/2 stars Great view. Okay food. LONG WAITING TIME. Took over an hour to seat two people. Maybe, its due to the holidays, but it certainly wasn't helping their case when my friend who had waited in line was cut by another person, who didn't even say sorry, and more surprisingly was the fact that the server who witness the whole thing didn't even bother to tell the lady that what SHE did was capital R U D E. Eating at cheesecake factory, feels like participating in the Hunger Games.  Death to each comrade until one remains having the trophy or in this case a seat for two. Anyway, after an hour waiting for food, I was expecting a spectacular meal. I was also getting an alcoholic milkshake to appease my hunger as well as numb my anger and frustration. The alcohol milkshake was okay. It was just milkshake mixed with flavored vodka. And the food? Not worth the hour wait.  But, the balcony seating is wonderful and very romantic. And the pigeons who perched there are very fat and cute. Some of them was eating the crumbs off the floor which made me laugh. Although, the servers did shoo them out after a minute or so. Overall, I would prefer not to go here on a crowded day as it was very exhausting and overwhelming, but that's just my two cents."
M C.,"Olivehurst, United States",294,2010,7472,4.0,19/9/2011,Nicely located right across the street from Union Square and on the top floor of Macy's. The place is grand and has nice decor. It is perfect for those who loves cheesecake or wants something different.  Serves is kind of slow.
Tara-Louise B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2015,"Probably the worst customer service I have ever received in a restaurant. I am a server myself so I have understanding and patience but this place was ridiculous.  The wait for our table was long, About 50 minutes. When we got seated our party of 7 was squished into a table with enough room for 4 or 5 people maximum.  We waited about 15 minutes after ordering our drinks for them to arrive at our table. One of the drinks never showed up at all.  The food was nice but it wasn't hot. My enchiladas were luke warm at best. I didn't return them to be heated as i knew my party would be finished their dishes before mine came back. We waited 45 minutes from when our cheque arrived at the table to when it was collected. We couldn't wait to get out of the place. I then checked my bank statement a few days later and my account had been charged accordingly and then the amount was returned to my account. The following day my account was charged the incorrect amount. (10 dollars too much) I have been on the phone twice to the cheese cake factory, on hold for 15/20 minutes both times. No apology or reason for this error has been given and I still have not been refunded. One manager was Linda, The other didn't give a name. I have been promised a call back with an explanation both times and the call back never happened.  I will never return."
Ted S.,"Elk Grove, United States",11,2,,1.0,10/4/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is usually my family's must-go destination when we come to the City. However, today's experience makes me question ever returning. From the prolonged wait for a table of 4 when we turned in our pager to the lack of customer service from our waiter, Angel. The worse, however, was the unacceptable wait for my food. I ordered the pit beef dip while the rest of my family ordered appetizers. However, my food was not brought out with the rest of my family's food.  After 10 minutes,  the manager came by to say that my food was forgotten and the kitchen was making it now.  5 more minutes passed and my waiter came by to say they were making it and it would right out. Another 10 minutes went by,  my family had finished their meals, and the waiter said it would be another 3 minutes. Another 10 minutes passed before the food was brought out. The waiter then avoided our table.  It took another 15 minutes before I had to ask for the check.  Just unacceptable all the way around."
Ashley N.,"San Jose, United States",155,338,91,3.0,28/11/2013,"I hypothesize that the only reason this Cheesecake factory is more crowded than your typical cheesecake factory is because it is located in union square, 8th floor macy's - and you get a pretty nice view if you're outside!  Other than the view, there really is nothing special.  Well, beside the fact that THERE IS AAAALWAYS A WAIIIT, or at least that is what it feels like whenever I come for a visit.  Regardless, I keep coming back because I love my cheesecake (and farfalle pasta), and I love it better with a view.  (You can see the view without eating here, btw)"
Jen H.,"Oakland, United States",0,1,3,1.0,9/10/2016,The cheesecake factory has always been one of my favorite places up until last Friday not only did we have to wait two hours for a table when my sons food came there was a cooked fruit fly inside of his French fries like cooked inside of it it was very disturbing it has been three days and my son examined his food thoroughly before eating and I feel so bad for him The cheesecake factory scarred him moving along after that had happened I took my food to go I did not eat because I felt so sorry for him he was in shock later on that night I went to go taste out of my mail which was Louisiana chicken Cut into the chicken and found a cooked piece of hair inside of it no joke literately in the The batter of the chicken it was completely gross although the manager was very nice there cooks need to be fired it is unhealthy anyways wanted to write this review for all of you parents out there and anyone else who visits this place please examine the food before you give it to your children

Azinda M.,"Chicago, United States",28,289,8,3.0,12/1/2014,"I know everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory, and to be honest, it's pretty good. But I prefer some interesting quirky restaurant over this. HOWEVER, I love that Cheesecake factory's menu is stocked with awesome variety -- really, anything you want is on that menu (which makes it SO hard to decide what to get!) My friends and I came here for our NYE dinner, which was nice, since we got to look off the balcony and enjoy the view of Union Square, but then the wait... omg. We waited about an hour to an hour and a half, so it was nuts (we showed up around 4:30...). However, we were seated, had the most eccentric waiter I've EVER had--which was an amusing twist to the evening, complete with many high-fives, semi-awkward yet extremely amusing references to mistletoe, lone wolfs, and mixing of tea bags. If you have ""Chaos"" as your waiter, you're in for the weirdly enjoyable evening we have. Anyways, khalua cheesecake. End of story."
Elsa T.,"North Las Vegas, United States",0,2,1,1.0,27/3/2016,"After waiting for two hours to get a table, the waitress came and got our drink menu. I ordered a limeade which they've been out of all day. I then asked for a bottle of moscato and she brings me two glasses instead of the bottle and stand to be next to our table. We weren't offered to order any appetizers or given bread and butter to have meanwhile we eat. I asked her for a kids menu that was never brought to us either I had to ask again when she came back to take our order and I also asked for bread and butter then.  She came took our drink order and came back grab our order not to mention the table next to us was sat after us and got their order first. Worst service ever!!!"
Diana F.,"San Francisco, United States",95,62,29,4.0,26/3/2016,"Eating at the Cheesecake Factory in downtown SF is a must-do on most visitor's lists. It is very iconic in that this Cheesecake Factory is located at the top level of Macy's in the heart of downtown SF and it overlooks Union Square. If it's not too chilly/windy, I'd recommend trying to sit outside because that gives you a direct overlook of Union Square. This location does not take reservations and you have to talk to the hostess directly in order to be put on the waiting list. You can call ahead to ask what their estimated wait time would be, but keep in mind this can change very quickly. When you arrive and give your name to the hostess, you will be given a buzzer which will vibrate when your table is ready. While you are waiting, feel free to take the escalators down 1 floor to the furniture section of Macy's and relax on some of their couches. The buzzer will still have a signal on that floor. Their food tastes just like any other Cheesecake Factory that I've been to, but it is a nice feeling dining in downtown SF."

It is very iconic in that this Cheesecake Factory is located at the top level of Macy's in the heart of downtown SF and it overlooks Union Square. If it's not too chilly/windy, I'd recommend trying to sit outside because that gives you a direct overlook of Union Square. This location does not take reservations and you have to talk to the hostess directly in order to be put on the waiting list. You can call ahead to ask what their estimated wait time would be, but keep in mind this can change very quickly. When you arrive and give your name to the hostess, you will be given a buzzer which will vibrate when your table is ready. While you are waiting, feel free to take the escalators down 1 floor to the furniture section of Macy's and relax on some of their couches. The buzzer will still have a signal on that floor. Their food tastes just like any other Cheesecake Factory that I've been to, but it is a nice feeling dining in downtown SF."
