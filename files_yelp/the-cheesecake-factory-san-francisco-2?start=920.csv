Carol Y.,"San Francisco, United States",668,165,269,1.0,26/4/2011,"After a long wet Sunday of wandering the city on foot, it was time for dessert.  Dessert in Union Square?  That had Cheesecake Factory written all over it.   The wait was about forty five minutes in the stuffy, crowded waiting area with hardly any seating.  After having bundled up for the chilly night outside, it was uncomfortable standing there in thick sweaters and jackets but too awkward to stand there and pull them off.  We opted to stand outside on their patio in the drizzle.   When we were finally seated, we let our waitress know that we would only be having an appetizer and dessert.  Outwardly, she appeared okay with that, but we could sense that she was rushing us out when the slices of cheesecake arrived as were we were getting only a third of the way through the calamari, and then when the check was placed in front of us while we were only halfway through the cheesecake slices.  To add insult to injury, she reached over my companion to grab the bill as we were still picking at our desserts.  Whoever trained this chick should be fired.   The food, on the other hand was great (hence the lone star rating).  The calamari was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, while the cheesecake (I think I had something with cinnamon and apple) was sweet and the texture, perfect."
Austin P.,"San Francisco, United States",53,48,2,5.0,20/10/2013,"Received excellent service from a server, Marie P. It is always nice to be an SF local and come to a spot where you can watch your server do an awesome job serving annoying tourists and still make you feel welcome. Three stars for the food, one extra star for my yummy Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, and the fifth star for my attentive server!"
Samuel G.,"East Los Angeles, United States",48,5,4,5.0,23/12/2014,"We had a great experience here. Our server Anthony was very attentive. The seared ahi in the tuna salad was perfectly done, garlic pasta had a super tasty sauce, and the cheesecake was perfect. Love the location too."
Aryan O.,"Long Beach, United States",111,537,26,3.0,2/3/2012,"For just taking a day trip in San Francisco I was hoping to hit up Yelp and just find some hidden gems to eat, but was outnumbered and had to settle for this. I mean, don't get me wrong, Cheesecake Factory is a good establishment, it's just where I come from it is too common and I wanted something different. Well the food was good, I always get the Jambalaya and what not. The side order Mac and Cheese is really good as well, not too heavy. The Mac and Cheese Burger is off the hook as well as the BBQ burger (always get your burger medium rare). Luckily the rain had passed and that the sun peeked through, we ended staying outside. Forgot to mention to find this place you need to take the elevator to the 6th floor. The view from outside was really nice."
Meg L.,"Austin, United States",0,12,,1.0,20/12/2013,"Great location, wonderful food.  BUT...terrible customer service at lunch. So terrible in fact that my mom and I walked out, never got our food and couldn't even get a manager to come talk to us.    As soon as we entered, we made it clear from the beginning with the hostess and the waiter that we had 1 hour to get in and get out.  They assured us no problem at all since it was 11am and they were very empty.  Took 20 mins to order our food which should have been the first sign of problems.  We ordered.  And waited, and waited and waited. other guests got their food but not us.  I looked for our waiter who was somewhere but near his tables and found another server and asked for a manager.  The waiter came back and said our food was right out.  It never came.  NOR did the manager.  I found the server, asked what the heck was going on and then he tells me ""oh the appetizer you ordered takes a while - lettuce wraps""  Are you kidding me?  I'm cool if that's the case but then when I told you I'm in a hurry why didn't you mention it, and why in the past I've never experienced such a delay.    So no waiter, no food, no manager.  I finally got disgusted and left.  I stopped at the hostess stand to complain and the kid working there who had little to no customer service skills said ""maam, I asked the manager to go see you but you'll have to wait.""  I'm done with the Cheesecake Factory.  Left such a bad taste in my mouth."
Kari B.,"Denver, United States",1,23,,2.0,30/12/2014,"I wasn't expecting much from a chain restaurant to begin with, but I was with a group of women shopping and the allure of the restaurant being on the top floor made it seem like a fun idea.  We had a 20 minute wait even though the place was pretty empty. When we ordered, our waiter returned to inform us that they were out of 3 of the 7 things we'd ordered. Then, we had a really long wait for food that was mediocre at best. The pear and blue cheese flat bread was tasty, but I was disappointed in the soy ginger edamame. Great flavor, but half of the edamame pods were empty."
Victor L.,"San Francisco, United States",46,549,110,4.0,27/2/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is a very solid restaurant.  I have been to several locations throughout California and this one is like the rest.  Great service, good food, large portions, scrumptious cheesecake.   The only downside to this place is that there is always a long wait.  But, if you go to the balcony, there is an amazing view.   Once your beeper starts to vibrate, head back inside, give it to the person at the front counter, and they will seat you shortly.  The menu is so vast.  There are small bites, appetizers, soups, salads, main courses, specialty dishes, and of course cheesecake!   The most recent time we went, we ordered the fried cheese, stuffed mushrooms, chicken marsala and mushrooms, and red velvet cheesecake.  We only ordered one entree because we always get two and can barely finish half.  The fried cheese tastes like mozzarella sticks, but more sophisticated.  They are crispy, and the inside is piping hot.  The stuffed mushrooms are delicious too.  The sauce is a bit oily, but still good.  As for the chicken marsala, it tastes like something very familiar.  For those of you who have had Yakisboa, teriyaki flavor, it tastes exactly the same as the sauce they use.  Try it and tell me it doesn't!   The red velvet cheesecake was very good, except we were extremely full by the time we ate it.  I would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full.   Cool place. I would urge everyone to try this at least once."
Elisa L.,"Toronto, Canada",353,327,472,4.0,26/2/2012,"I was going to come here with a group of ~8, which btw.. was a 2 hour wait (luckily we called in prior to find this out, we didnt actually wait there for 2 hours). Came here for real with my bf, we chose the outdoor table which was only a 20min wait. Indoor seating would have been 40 min.  Their portions are huge despite the priciness. Esp. on the cocktails. We only got dessert, so I don't know about the wait. Overall good service though. Oh, and we had delicious bread served to us.  PS. I love how their menu is like 30 pages long, with every other page being a Macy's ad."
Andrew W.,"San Francisco, United States",438,431,823,4.0,5/5/2011,"Food wise for all The Cheesecake factories our there are all about 3/5 for what you pay and what you get. The difference between this Cheesecake Factory is its location. This one is located on the top floor of Macy's, in Downtown San Francisco. One of the best views of SF if you eat outside on the balcony. On some occasion if there aren't enough people sitting outside and you are the only table, you might see pigeons patrolling, but they won't attack you so its not much of a problem and you can always just eat inside. What I recommend: Eat a sandwich or burger out on the balcony on a sunny day (rare in SF but great experience) Steak Diane Chicken Madera"
Bill W.,"Austin, United States",2,47,,3.0,30/8/2013,"3.5 stars Prior to my vacation in San Francisco, my wife and I agreed that we would try not to eat at any chain restaurants. Well, after several nights of expensive meals at local restaurants, we decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a try.  Although the front desk staff seemed overwhelmed by the people asking for tables, they provided us with a notification device and told us it was an hour wait. We did some shopping for part of the time. When the device went off, they told us to wait off to the side, which ended up being another 10 minute wait. My complaint here is every other restaurant that I have been to won't set off the notification device unless your table is ready. So, don't be fooled that when yours goes off that a table is truly ready; you probably have additional time to wait. The food was typical for the chain and, surprisingly, the prices were about the same as prices at the same chain in Austin, TX. For SF, the prices were much more reasonable. The food was typical for the chain. It was ""nothing to write home about,"" but it satisfied the appetite. We sat on the outside terrace on a rather chilly night and we were really not prepared. The heaters worked marginally well. But, THE VIEW of the buildings around Union Square was memorable. It was especially funny to see the birds fly up to the glass surrounding the balcony and seem to ask ""have something for me to munch on?"""

Victoria B.,"Pittsburg, United States",0,79,43,3.0,20/7/2014,"I have been to the cheesecake factory in walnut creek and sf neither one is memorable. The food is good decently priced, good portions overall. I like this place to eat and hang out with friends. It looks like fine dining but jeans and sandals are perfect for men or women. Service always good and attentive even at 1030 Saturday night. Cocktails worth a try. Food is good. Flat bread pizza yum. Too many cheesecake choices but worth a try after all it is the cheesecake factory."
Jim L.,"San Francisco, United States",63,68,49,4.0,11/7/2012,Some mad chicken samosas and that cilantro sauce was a treat too. Always dine outdoors under the stars and 8 stories above the crowds. Did you know they close at midnight on weekends? Freakin recession does crazy things to business but I'm lovin it. Just don't bring your kids here unless you tie them down because that ledge is short and one of these days one of them is gonna bounce off.
Jiordan C.,"San Francisco, United States",66,142,489,4.0,23/10/2011,"I go to this particular Cheesecake Factory just for the view, the bread, and the cheap breakfast options (eggs any style, toast, etc.). I rarely get real food or cheesecake (though their flavors are great) if and when I go. They have pretty upbeat service, which I really appreciate in an otherwise overwhelming setting. Also, they don't rush you or ignore you when it's extra packed and busy. But that bread... you know, that dark, oat-crusted loaf that comes before the food - worth the wait. I know it's weird, but it's really good bread."
Laura B.,"Boston, United States",5,103,39,4.0,1/1/2014,"Very good but We had to wait two hours....so long!! Cheesecake are really good and the beef is good too! You can see Union Square and the Christmas tree !!  This is a good place for birthday, dinner with friends and family."
Roger M.,"New York, United States",173,15,7,4.0,14/12/2014,"The food is fantastic. The grilled pork chop with the potatoes are fantasticn the cheescake variety is amazing. I had the white chocolate rasberry cheesecake and it was great. My knock on the place is there is an over abundance of items on the menu that makes it hard to narrow down what to eat, I would prefer they narrow it down to best sellers or specialties."
Cherry Y.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, United States",99,57,81,3.0,1/9/2013,"A ridiculously long line, especially during lunch time. But because theyre big chain stores i can always expect to have good food. I would only go there for lunch, simply because even lunch menus come in huge servings. Next time i go i'd love to dine outside!"
Gelene V.,"Los Angeles, United States",221,98,24,4.0,7/10/2013,"I love the combination of shopping and stopping by here to grab a quick bite to eat. Although the wait for a table can get somewhat lengthy, you can take a beeper and shop stores in its vicinity without it going off. Another way to pass the time is to stand outside at the balcony and people watch above Union Square.  I recommend ordering the pasta here as most other dishes range between unappetizing to delicious (unpredictable depending on day and location). Some dishes that have constantly been good and I'd recommend are  - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta I also love the whole wheat grain bread they serve, I always make them refill the bread tray!! As for cheesecakes, I LOVE the red velvet cheesecake. If you love red velvet cupcakes, you're going to love this cheesecake. Some other ones I also recommend is Classic, Fresh Strawberry (Classic with Strawberry Syrup and Strawberries), and Oreo. Warning: Oreo is a little on the sweeter side. Pro-tip: If you're only stopping by to pick up cheesecake, simply go to the back to the Cheesecake register. No need to wait in line :)"
Wilson T.,"San Francisco, United States",304,444,32,4.0,9/4/2012,"Little bit on the pricey side for American/Italian food but the food IS pretty good. Granted I know every meal I eat here is like a whole day's worth of calories. So the wait was really long! And when I got the table for 3, my friends hadn't arrived yet and their policy is everyone must be present. So I explained to the hostess that I was the ""boyfriend"" who had to wait in line for the ""girlfriend"" and her friend and she was super nice because she makes her boyfriend do that all the time! So good thign I saved us that table. I order a calamari appetizer and the garlic butter sauce is really good. The calamari is well fried also. My friend got the chicken alfredo which was delicious and I forget what the other one was but it looked good too. I also had a rocky road spiked shake with whiskey and liquer and it was delightful.  All in all a good meal, but even an appetizer and drink put a whole in my wallet close to $25. Pros: Good food, good service, nice view. Cons: High in calories/fat, expensive and long waits."
Stephanie A.,"Sunnyvale, United States",592,398,249,3.0,18/11/2014,"I usually try to stay away from the Cheesecake Factory since they serve an obscenely high calorie food that I can't resist. It is also always an impossible mission to get s sit in any of their restaurants without spending an obscene amount of time waiting in line. I think it is their strategy to create the line even if there are open tables to make the impression they are always so busy and in demand.  Once inside almost anything in the menu will be a crowed pleasure and you are sure to enjoy your chosen dish as long as you don't count it's calories, or if you promise yourself to run a marathon the next day ( or before ?) This branch is no different. The service is good the food didn't fail as well. The location on Macy's rooftop above union square is a type A location which is hard to beat. I don't like the inside, it is too loud and s bit darkish so we set outside under one of the Heaters. In the cold nights of SF even two heaters from both sides couldn't help to keep us warm. Bring your coat, hat, and scarf.  The kids are always psyched about the climb through Macy's different flours, and even more ecstatic about the elevator ride. Then they are truly out of their mind because of the union square view below, and the near by buildings.  I hate it that they made us wait in line for twenty minutes although we asked to sit outside and more than half the tables outside were empty, clean, and ready to accommodate diners. A server approached us fast and took our order( we had plenty of time while waiting to choose from the menu), five minutes later he came to tell us his shift has ended and we will have a new server taking care of us. He didn't tell the new server about our special requests ( to leave the decorative seasoning out of the plate, to bring the salad dressing on the side, to split one of the dishes) and as s result almost everything came out wrong. I don't understand why a server that knows his shift ends takes an order. It was very upsetting to send the plates back to the kitchen and again wait for our food. It pretty much killed our dinner. By the time we began eating we were too hungry, upset and too frozen. We didn't stay for dessert but chose to buy sweets at the excellent sweet shop a few floors below."

Once inside almost anything in the menu will be a crowed pleasure and you are sure to enjoy your chosen dish as long as you don't count it's calories, or if you promise yourself to run a marathon the next day ( or before ?) This branch is no different. The service is good the food didn't fail as well. The location on Macy's rooftop above union square is a type A location which is hard to beat. I don't like the inside, it is too loud and s bit darkish so we set outside under one of the Heaters. In the cold nights of SF even two heaters from both sides couldn't help to keep us warm. Bring your coat, hat, and scarf.  The kids are always psyched about the climb through Macy's different flours, and even more ecstatic about the elevator ride. Then they are truly out of their mind because of the union square view below, and the near by buildings.  I hate it that they made us wait in line for twenty minutes although we asked to sit outside and more than half the tables outside were empty, clean, and ready to accommodate diners. A server approached us fast and took our order( we had plenty of time while waiting to choose from the menu), five minutes later he came to tell us his shift has ended and we will have a new server taking care of us. He didn't tell the new server about our special requests ( to leave the decorative seasoning out of the plate, to bring the salad dressing on the side, to split one of the dishes) and as s result almost everything came out wrong. I don't understand why a server that knows his shift ends takes an order. It was very upsetting to send the plates back to the kitchen and again wait for our food. It pretty much killed our dinner. By the time we began eating we were too hungry, upset and too frozen. We didn't stay for dessert but chose to buy sweets at the excellent sweet shop a few floors below."
