Tatiana R.,"San Mateo, United States",5,15,2,5.0,24/10/2013,"I love eating delicious food and I am crazy about different kinds of cheese. While shopping in Macy's I decided to have some rest, drink a cup of coffee and  have my favourite cheesecake. I was impressed by a wonderful view which I could enjoy sitting on the terrace of Cheesecake Factory. Although it was crowded the service was good and quite professional. Then my friends and I went there in the evening to have some salads and we were not disappointed. I think it is a nice place where you can try a lot of tasty dishes and have a beautiful panoramic view ."
Allyson W.,"Milpitas, United States",50,11,,4.0,4/9/2013,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for date night on Labor Day evening around 7pm, and I was surprised that the wait was less than an hour. Even though it took about 40-50 min to get seated when they said 30 min. The receptionist was friendly and patient despite so many people crowding her.  For appetizer we had the crab bites, and for dinner I ordered the lemon tomato basil angel hair shrimp pasta, and my boyfriend got a basil cream sauce pasta with breaded chicken, prosciutto and arugula on top. Both were delicious!! Our waiter was friendly, never forgot about us, and was helpful. It was my boyfriends first time here and he loved his food. For dessert we had the Oreo cheesecake. So good but I wish we saved room for it during dinner.  The only complaint I had is since we sat outside during the evening, the lighting was BAD. By the end of dinner, couldn't see my food or my boyfriend."
Tracy T.,"San Francisco, United States",736,673,421,3.0,16/8/2014,"Highlights - I can't deny the fact that this Cheesecake Factory location is probably in the most prime location that anyone can ask for.  - At the heart of Union Square, this is the most convenient location if you are tired from shopping and need a bite to eat. Right inside Macy's. How convenient! - Sitting outside is such a treat and highly recommended. The best views of Union Square are directly below and especially a treat during Xmas time, since you can people watch with the ice skating rink smack dab in Union Sq. - I am in love with their wheat bread that they bring to your table as a starter. It comes out warm and so delicious. I'll take two of those, please!  - Avocado Eggrolls: Must order, just trust me! - Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: My all time fav. If you don't eat meat or just want something healthy, this is for you. Loaded with vegetables, pasta al dente, and drizzled with olive oil.   - Cheesecake: Don't skip or be cheap about it. Fresh strawberry is always a great option, but if you are feeling adventurous ask about their special flavor and indulge.  Improvements - Since this is in such a prime location, it's a tourist and local hotspot. At all times of the day, expect a long wait either sitting inside or outside. Even with a party of 2, I've had to wait 45 mins or more.  - Don't expect great service either, there are way too many people to be served and not enough waiters with the time to cater to your needs. I came once and wasn't served or acknowledged at my table until I flagged two other waiters to ask who my waiter was.  Tip - You can call in an order for pick-up if you don't want to wait or don't care about the million dollar view above Union Square.  - Got a date and some time to spare, come here and sit outside. Thank me later! ;)"
Michelle M.,"Belmont, United States",197,1852,605,2.0,25/4/2011,"What....a.....mess!  The wait here is always super long.  At least 1 hour (sometimes 3 hours during x-mas season).  Once you get seated, you think you are safe, but really you are not.  These poor city kids working as waiters are run to pieces, thus don't give you the quality service you think you might get after patiently waiting to be seated. My friend never got her meal, out of our group of six  The cook forgot to make her order.  To compensate her, they gave her a free slice of cheesecake, but it didn't fix her hungry stomach.  While at the table we saw people bringing their checks up to the waiters, you aren't supposed to do that!  But because this place is so out of it, I guess that is okay here? In conclusion, I'd only order slice of cheesecake here TOGO.  It is not worth it to subject yourself to this unorganized madness.  Out of towners can have at it for the view and ""experience.""  But local peeps, you know much better places to check out in the smaller districts."
Dominica B.,"Fairfield, United States",0,2,1,2.0,10/11/2014,"I was there on Monday celebrating my birthday with 5 others of my family members.The service was not there.We finished our meal and my family ordered dessert. Our waitress brought there desserts and had placed a candle on someone else's dessert to sing to me and that was it. The bill comes and we were overcharged, as soon as our waitress comes back she says ""I do apologize here is your Fudge Sundae"" after we were already leaving.I was just disappointed especially me being that it was my birthday."
Dan B.,"Baldwin, United States",0,24,7,4.0,19/4/2014,"Great view if sitting outside, but they only allow 4 people to a table, so our party of 7 had to be seated at 2 tables next to each other. This was silly because we still had the same waitress so why not just push the tables together? Silly rule, and we still had to wait 30 min even though one whole side of the outside was empty. Food was excellent, but the sangria was just fruit juice, and at $11 a glass, I will never buy this again at cheesecake. Three of us ordered 2 glasses just to be sure we didn't get a bad batch but both glasses were the same, so avoid it!"
Elsa H.,"San Leandro, United States",14,35,112,2.0,4/6/2015,Came here on Thursday night. Took 30mins to get the artichoke dip. My pasta is cold but the sauce is warm. I guess they were busy because I never got my water refilled. It took forever to get the check. I only came here because of the location....
Karen P.,"San Francisco, United States",12,83,16,4.0,25/3/2012,"Great food! Friendly service , we sat at the bar area so we didn't have to wait long, we were promptly greeted and told the specials. We order papas bravas, delicious sauce on the side, but it came at the same time that our entrees. My boyfriend had the chicken bacon club, it was delicious, I had the fettucini with sundried tomatoes, it was good but it needed some kind off veggie in it, something crunchy or fresh , because you could only eat so much of the pasta with that sauce, it was a bit too much. I wanted cheesecake but I was full!  We left happy and with left overs, .... I will give them 3 and 1/2 stars, but I can't, and since it was a positive experience , so be 4 :D"
Martin J.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,5,,2.0,17/10/2015,"This visit by my wife and I to The Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy's in Union Square was quite a disappointment. Not for the quality of the food but for the cleanliness and attitude of our server. When our wait person finally came to greet us we first needed to request that one of our plates be replaced as we could see it had a green-colored grime residue. As she snatched it away in a surly manner we saw that she was the only server not wearing the black Cheesecake Factory apron. And also that she had grime marks and food stains on the front of her shirt. Her surly, couldn't care less attitude continued throughout our visit making us wait for her attention longer than her other customers. Note, the other staff members that we interacted with were helpful and caring and the food when it arrived was very enjoyable. It's a shame that our server took the shine off the rest of the our experience at The Cheesecake Factory."
Ankita K.,"Fremont, United States",0,6,,1.0,1/7/2015,"I had the worst experience with the manager here after we waited for 30 minutes for a table. We had come here for desserts and coffee post dinner. After ordering snacks and desserts while at the bar, we were finally buzzed for a table. We had already spend $50 on the desserts by the time we got the table. We head to the check in counter with food in our hands to have Manager Joe mock us by saying that this is a full-service restaurant and they can't have take away food on the tables. He just kept arguing and refused to give us a table. We finally did get a table after all that bickering, but are u kidding - it's food I ordered from Cheese Cake Factory while I was waiting!! This guy should be fired for his lack of hospitality skills. We drove from Fremont to catch up with cousins. What a total let down. U won't get my business EVER AGAIN."
Sapphire C.,"San Francisco, United States",2,14,9,5.0,6/11/2013,"The only cheesecake place for me!. I love their cheesecake selections. Waiters are awesome they always check on you service is always good.  This location in Union Square is my favorite, everytime I come here in downtown SF I always come to this Cheesecake factory location after a long shopping... This is a nice place to hang out with your friends have some delicious cheesecake and coffee..hmmm yummy! my favorite among their cheesecakes are Dulce de Leche and Red Velvet!. It sweet but not too sweet just right... It is also nice to come here during December,  Christmas season, and eat at the balcony get the view of the Union square and you will see the huge Christmas tree and ice skating rink.. just make sure you bring a thick jacket.. it is always cold in SF much more during December.."
Jon W.,"Dallas, United States",5,15,,4.0,13/12/2013,"We had a wonderful time at the Cheesecake factory. The pricing were very reasonable, and the food - wow. I can honestly say I had some of the best Thai chicken and rice I have ever had!!!  If I had one bad thing to say is the time it took to get served. However it is in the middle of Union Square so this ins understandable. It also took a while for our server to come and take our order once we sat down but let that not take away from the amazing food. If you are going to San Francisco, you should pop in for a meal!!"
Eline M.,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",2,8,,4.0,24/6/2013,"Oeh.. I love this place!! I stayed 2 months in San Francisco and I've visited the Cheesecake Factory a lot!!!  The burgers, chicken, pastas, cheesecakes.. everything is really good! (Especially the famous Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake. :) )  The prices are ok, the service is good and the view is amazing if you have a seat outside. The only con - is, that it's always crowded. You've to wait a long time for your table. Most of the time (at least) 45 minutes.."
Mimi L.,"Torrance, United States",3209,1017,9804,4.0,31/3/2011,"i am a fan of cheesecake factory, it was a regular date dinner spot with my ex. we used to go to the one in Pasadena all the time. went to this one in union square with my bf on his biz trip,  it was so big, much bigger than any cheesecake factory in LA. and we asked a seating at sky terrace, we could overlook entire union square, it was amazing view! food is as good as always, drinks are tasty, don't know about cheese cake, cuz I am lactose intolerance. I supposed it is one of the best, cuz it is famous for cheese cakes right? :P good service, good food, portions are large. good for casual dinner date, friends hangout, a couple drinks, or family dinner. this place is good for pretty much everything . :)"
Erika G.,"Livermore, United States",368,754,449,2.0,23/2/2011,"Working lunch today again... No wait at 1130am - score! Server was very nice and attentive.  Brought bread, gave us time to figure out what to order -  we were chatting so much we didn't even get to look at the menu's yet.  Refilled drinks without asking, checked to make sure we were ok.  So that was good. BUT I ordered the Rosie's Special (or something like that) half sandwhich - carved roasted turkey on a STALE baguette, cup of soup - baked potato was creamy and thick but the potatos crunched!  They werent in there long enough to be cooked fully.  and small side salad.   Generally it would be good but stale bread, undercooked potatos not so good!   2 stars because I now have tummy issues since lunch!  So much so I ALMOST had to use a BART STATION BATHROOM! OMG! But I made it home. Whew, thank goodness!  I think I am gonna stop coming here for a while. Which is too bad because I usually take meetings here - now I think I will suggest somewhere else."
Toby I.,"Santa Monica, United States",71,382,,2.0,29/7/2013,"If it weren't for that sweet waitress I would give this place 1 star. It's packed to shit, but thats not why I didn't like it. I put my name down they said 30 minutes.  Then I wait 1 hour. I go up to them and say WTF? They go.. OOPS yeah you have been waiting a long time, we'll seat you next.  I HATE that i have to be on top of them and why do i have this useless buzzer? it will never go off.  We got seated outside and the waitress was nice.  I asked for jamaican shrimp with chicken. Came out without chicken.  She brought out the chicken on the side and didn't even charge me for it.  I think when you're hungry , like super duper ghandi hungry you want your food.  And if you have to wait an extra 30 minutes, for no reason you just get pissssssed off.  At least I did.   I wouldn't come back to this place... there are so many good restaurants in SF why go to a chain restaurant?  I went because my friend wanted to go so i obliged.  I now know why I have only eaten here 2 times in 7 years."
Irene U.,"San Jose, United States",15,73,,1.0,25/7/2013,"Can't decide between 2 stars or 1. Good food but horrible horrible customer service. the waitress checked up on us once but we weren't ready to order yet and then she disappeared for 20 minutes. we actually had to get someone to flag her down for us. one of the kids in our group ordered a hamburger and was asked how they wanted it to be cooked. the kid was a little confused with this question and the waitress responded by rolling her eyes and explained the different ways in a very condescending tone.  the girls mother ordered a salad but instead of chicken, she asked they replace it with steak. she was also asked how she would like her steak done and she replied with ""medium rare."" the salad came and instead of steak...they put beets on there (maybe she wrote down beef?). no big deal, mistakes happen so she sent it back to the kitchen. the waitress then comes out and was angry we sent it back because ""they could've just brought it out for you."" Few minutes later, the salad came back out and this non-steak looking thing was just slapped on top of the salad.  when we would ask her to bring us ketchup (for the hamburgers and fries), she acted as if she didn't hear us so we asked again and she would say ""it's coming out, just be patient."" well, if you acknowledge that you heard us, we wouldn't ask again.  after we were all done, she cleared our tables. she didn't offer us the dessert menu so we asked for it. when the cheesecakes came out, we had to ask for forks. she then grabbed 5 forks from the dishwasher i assume because they were wet and hot. she dropped it on the counter and walked away.  i thought it was only her until we ordered a few slices of cheesecake to go from the front. when we asked if it was ready, she (another lady) dropped the bag in front of our faces. no eye contact, no ""thank you for coming, have a great day.""  the more i think about it, the angrier i get. i've worked in customer service before and i know there are bad days...but never once, have i given anyone that same attitude that was given to us.  they may have a beautiful view of sf, but there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that to do too. never again cheesecake factory union square."
Tasha S.,"San Francisco, United States",85,27,99,5.0,10/10/2014,"Sit at the bar, and witness Marissa tending to her customers with more love and finesse and kindness than anyone you've ever experienced! She exhibits grace and thoughtfulness in every action in her preparation of your beverages and interaction behind the bar! It's a joy to watch her."
Nicole E.,"Fremont, United States",46,80,18,2.0,8/4/2013,"I'll write this with the disclaimer that I really do like other Cheesecake Factory locations. The chain as a whole tends to have decent food, and consistent service. But this place is kind of what I would imagine hell to be like. First of all, you have to pack into this little elevator, and nobody has a concept of personal space. Just wait for the next one, you guys. Hosts/hostesses have this rude attitude. I know it's probably going to be over a 1.5 hour wait at any given hour of the day, but please you don't have to be so pretentious about telling me that. Come on. Servers are trying, but they're busy and tend not to be attentive. Service is quite sub par compared to other locations. The food is still good. I just don't think it's worth the musty elevatory ride, 1.5 hour wait for the table, and 45+ minute wait for the food. Seriously, if you're in San Francisco to visit... take it from a local: There are 1,000 better restaurants you can eat at within this little 7x7 mile square. Go experience something better."
Megan C.,"Grand Rapids, United States",111,79,22,2.0,2/11/2014,I was forced to go here with my mom who was visiting. She saw this on Big Bang Theory. The portions are way way too big! My chicken bellagio dish could have fed 3 ppl. They should also do cheesecake flights instead of the very large slices because after eating their giant portions the last thing I needed was a super size slice of cheesecake.

Good food but horrible horrible customer service. the waitress checked up on us once but we weren't ready to order yet and then she disappeared for 20 minutes. we actually had to get someone to flag her down for us. one of the kids in our group ordered a hamburger and was asked how they wanted it to be cooked. the kid was a little confused with this question and the waitress responded by rolling her eyes and explained the different ways in a very condescending tone.  the girls mother ordered a salad but instead of chicken, she asked they replace it with steak. she was also asked how she would like her steak done and she replied with ""medium rare."" the salad came and instead of steak...they put beets on there (maybe she wrote down beef?). no big deal, mistakes happen so she sent it back to the kitchen. the waitress then comes out and was angry we sent it back because ""they could've just brought it out for you."" Few minutes later, the salad came back out and this non-steak looking thing was just slapped on top of the salad.  when we would ask her to bring us ketchup (for the hamburgers and fries), she acted as if she didn't hear us so we asked again and she would say ""it's coming out, just be patient."" well, if you acknowledge that you heard us, we wouldn't ask again.  after we were all done, she cleared our tables. she didn't offer us the dessert menu so we asked for it. when the cheesecakes came out, we had to ask for forks. she then grabbed 5 forks from the dishwasher i assume because they were wet and hot. she dropped it on the counter and walked away.  i thought it was only her until we ordered a few slices of cheesecake to go from the front. when we asked if it was ready, she (another lady) dropped the bag in front of our faces. no eye contact, no ""thank you for coming, have a great day.""  the more i think about it, the angrier i get. i've worked in customer service before and i know there are bad days...but never once, have i given anyone that same attitude that was given to us.  they may have a beautiful view of sf, but there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that to do too. never again cheesecake factory union square."

She exhibits grace and thoughtfulness in every action in her preparation of your beverages and interaction behind the bar! It's a joy to watch her."
Nicole E.,"Fremont, CA",46,80,18,2.0,4/8/2013,"I'll write this with the disclaimer that I really do like other Cheesecake Factory locations. The chain as a whole tends to have decent food, and consistent service. But this place is kind of what I would imagine hell to be like. First of all, you have to pack into this little elevator, and nobody has a concept of personal space. Just wait for the next one, you guys. Hosts/hostesses have this rude attitude. I know it's probably going to be over a 1.5 hour wait at any given hour of the day, but please you don't have to be so pretentious about telling me that. Come on. Servers are trying, but they're busy and tend not to be attentive. Service is quite sub par compared to other locations. The food is still good. I just don't think it's worth the musty elevatory ride, 1.5 hour wait for the table, and 45+ minute wait for the food. Seriously, if you're in San Francisco to visit... take it from a local: There are 1,000 better restaurants you can eat at within this little 7x7 mile square. Go experience something better."
Megan C.,"Grand Rapids, MI",111,79,22,2.0,11/2/2014,I was forced to go here with my mom who was visiting. She saw this on Big Bang Theory. The portions are way way too big! My chicken bellagio dish could have fed 3 ppl. They should also do cheesecake flights instead of the very large slices because after eating their giant portions the last thing I needed was a super size slice of cheesecake.
