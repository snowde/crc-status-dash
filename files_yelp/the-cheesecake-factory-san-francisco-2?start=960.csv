Edmund Y.,"Manhattan, United States",17,82,18,3.0,11/1/2014,"Why the hell do people like this place so much?  It's like the go-to big party dinner restaurant.  I mean, the food is good, waiters are all extremely friendly and attentive, and ofc cheesecake, but the WAIT TIMES omg.  We had a party of 7, and the wait for dinner was 1.5 hrs.  You get a nice view of Union Square from the balcony, and get to see the Christmas tree and ice skaters, but there are so many other restaurants in downtown to go to instead. Lastly, I don't even like Cheesecake!"
Andy M.,"Hayward, United States",371,187,115,2.0,18/4/2013,"Two thoughts: 1. Cheesecake here is just like cheesecake at any of the other Cheesecake factories.  2. The food here is horrible.  The wait is always long and the service is not the best. I usually really enjoy cheesecake factory food but the times I have eaten at this location have all been horrible. My pasta dish was so smothered in sauce I felt like I was eating soup. Food comes out extra slow, and meat is always over-cooked and dry.  I'm am really sorry to say but I will make it a point not to dine here again. I'll stick to the other cheesecake factory locations."
Ind B.,"Pacifica, United States",0,17,,2.0,10/5/2015,"Ok, this restaurant is extremely busy. I took my mother in law for an early dinner on Saturday 5/9. The food is good, the view is good so I would consider as 3-4 stars. The waitress (Jessica) is quite nice , polite and attentive. So I gave her 5 stars. The reason why I put 2 stars was because the bathroom was disgusting! From toilet paper to sanitary napkins were on the floor.. Twice I used their bathrooms and there was no toilet seat cover. The toilet was wet and water was everywhere. Gross!!  I spoke with the front desk regarding the issues but when I came back to use their bathroom the second time, it seemed like the problems were still there. This is now about health and safety issues!! I would like to see the management to have their bathrooms check every 15-30 minutes during peak hours. This is a very busy well established restaurant. I hate to see people slip and fall in the bathroom!!!!"
Jan P.,"San Leandro, United States",1707,462,1259,4.0,2/1/2011,"It gets very crowded and touristy around the afternoon here - so come through early if you can if you want to avoid the crowd and wait time.  Immediately, we got seated right away for 2 at a nice table spot next to the window glass that overlooks Union Square - the view was quite spectacular!  First things first - Host team, thumbs up! Y'all are very welcoming. I like it when the hosts address me, instead of me having to get their attention.  My server was an awesome server, he was very attentive. It took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted; he was very patient with our ordering time. Not to mention, he kept our glasses filled with water the entire meal. Which is quite a feat, considering we drink like fish. Chicken Marsala and bed of mushroom - savory, very rich in flavor & thick.  Pepperoni pizza - nothing too special here. Good for someone who doesn't know how to order.  The cheesecake was great. Goodness! I had the original cheesecake.  $6.75 for a slice, folks.  It was a great experience, all around. Very good, very decadent, and very fun to share."
Anni Y.,"San Francisco, United States",355,71,221,1.0,3/12/2014,"Came here for my birthday (Wednesday, November 26, 2014) and not only was the service HORRIBLE, but also, the waiter got my order wrong as I was the birthday girl. My order couldn't even be granted, so they TRIED to compensate me for them to messing up my birthday dinner. I was NOT even given a free birthday cheesecake slice as I'm suppose to be given but the pathetic staff gave me a scoop of ice cream and whip cream instead. What?! Yes, I got ripped off for my birthday! I came with friends and they ended up feeling sorry for me instead of be happy for me on my own birthday.  I lost my appetite once a random order of sorts arrived after my friends were already finished with their food. My dinner arrived nearly an hour after everyone else received their meals. I didn't even want my friends to even tip the wait staff but since I respect waiters and waitresses, my friends pitched in for the minimal tip of 10% vs 20%. In all, these people didn't deserve to be tipped for not granting me my free cheesecake and also failed getting my order.  Service was EXTREMELY horrible and they were RUDE to me as the birthday girl! I normally wouldn't take time to do a bad review, but I had to, these people RUINED my birthday dinner!"
Melissa Q.,"Aurora, United States",0,3,,1.0,25/3/2016,"My mom and I ordered salads to go from this Cheesecake Factory. After walking 10 blocks to our hotel, we opened the bag to find 2 containers of lettuce and nothing else. Literally the worst takeout experience of my life. Especially disappointing because it took them half an hour to assemble these 2 tubs of lettuce. We just threw them out and went somewhere else for dinner. Check your to-go orders before walking out the door!!"
Athena M.,"Irvine, United States",28,11,24,2.0,2/11/2014,"We came here on a Saturday night (non-holiday weekend) for my sister's birthday.  She had roughly 10 people in the party and we all promptly arrived at 6pm. We put down our names and the host told us it'll be about a 2 hour wait. We figured this would happen so others sat around chatting while some of us went to the bar to get some drinks. About an hour in, we went back up to the host stand and they told us it'll be another 45 minutes. Okay. Cool. We'll be seated sooner than expected. Again, others went to the bar and some went outside to enjoy the pleasant evening, taking in Union Square. When the 45 minutes were up, the host told us it'll be 2 hours. There was no way the party wanted to wait another 2 hours; we were hungry at this point. After explaining that we've been there since 6, the lady retracted her statement saying it'll be 10 minutes; they are cleaning up our table right now. Luckily, we were seated before we decided to go elsewhere. The waitress was friendly and took in our orders. She also helped in accommodating our tardy guest, who didn't think they'd be able to make it on time. We ordered drinks and was  delivered to our table almost instantaneously. Our food came in 30 minutes later, and she came around the table every once in awhile to check on our food and add more drink orders. What I really liked about our service was her splitting the bill before we asked for it. Service was great, the Steak Diane was on point, and some of their drinks were good.  Would I come here again? Probably only if I am with one other person. The wait time is ridiculous."
Erica S.,"San Rafael, United States",0,33,,4.0,3/5/2015,"So let me say the atmosphere is amazing, the view is wonderful and the food always delivers to be great! I must minus some point however for a crazy wait, and when another customer was flashing their flash light in my face trying to read their menu obnoxiously I flagged down a waitress to ask her to politely tell this chick to stop it- it had been 10  min already, the waitress went to get the manager which was good, however they wanted me to move my seat...ummm why can't you go ask her to stop? Next time I would  just go ask myself so that ticked me off. But if you're a tourist it's a fun place to eat!"
Helen M.,"San Francisco, United States",3,63,6,1.0,10/10/2013,"After a long while I went here for lunch.  It's always packed of visitors and tourists.  It took me 15 minutes to get a table.  The waiter tho pointed to the worst table in the balcony tho.  The very first table by the entrance door of balcony, where all the people pass by! Plus the pigeons roaming around...Anyways I asked him to find me another table inside.   After sitting, two waitresses came together on my table!  I don't why I had two waitresses! Maybe one was training or something... anyways, I ordered a pasta dish. Believe it or not, it took 45 minutes for them to bring my food.  It was a simple pasta.  Meanwhile I asked the two waitress to bring me a cup of water, they left and never came back!  After 45 mins when they brought my food, I asked them again for the water.  One of them left and came back with the cup of water.  The food was just as simple as pasta in Diner or Mels Drive in or any casual place could be.  It was a bit salty but the topping was good.   At the end when I got the bill, I noticed that there is surcharge of SF Fee which is 2.5% of the total bill.  I didn't understand the little note on it at the bottom of my bill which says: ""In response to mandate increases in employment related costs a 2.5% surcharge has been added to your bill !!!!""  I didn't understand what the F was this for.  You guys just charging innocent customers (mostly tourists and visitors) for no logic reason??!! What is the Employment related costs??? Don't you corporate businesses make enough money to pay your Employment related bills that you have to charge your costumers??? And you think people won't notice it or will agree paying it?? What an idiotic disgusting idea... I am so sorry for myself that I spent my money here today. Didn't leave any tip at the end because I didn't like anything about this place.   So sorry but you guys need to be a bit more cautious of charging people. Will never come back."
Lorena M.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, United States",5,6,,4.0,3/4/2014,This by is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location. The view is incredible and the service is pretty good even though they are ALWAYS busy when I go on the weekend.  If you want to avoid a long wait I'd recommend coming on a week day otherwise be prepared to wait over an hour for a table.
Winnie H.,"San Francisco, United States",2,7,,4.0,20/6/2013,"This is thee place to be when you're enjoying the holiday spirit of downtown SF. I've always come here at least once in the winter time and have received consistent good service. There's something about the ambience that makes you feel at ease and helps you savor the food.  Compared to other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in San Jose/Walnut Creek/Santa Clara/Santana Row, the food and service are similar. But the location, being at the top floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square, is a major plus to the experience."
Amy L.,"Santa Clara, United States",401,747,273,4.0,15/5/2011,"I'm a pretty big fan of the Cheesecake Factory franchise. A normal entree is 2-3 meals for me, so I usually ask them to put 1/2 to go, on the get go. It helps me pace myself! My personal favorite is the Da Vinci pasta [yumm]. And their stuffed mushroom appetizer.. Oh gosh. And their bread! Their whole wheat bread is a little sweet, which I love. If you know how to control your portions, Cheesecake Factory is so worth it. The only problem with this one is that it's louder than most, but that's to be expected. I mean, it's on top of Macy's in Union Square! But the view... Mmm I love it! It might take awhile to be seated, but I like going out to the balcony and looking out over the city. I wasn't as in love with their red velvet cheesecake as I have been with other Cheesecake Factorys', but my best loved their Godiva cheesecake! :P"
S Y.,"San Francisco, United States",285,387,5880,4.0,8/1/2011,"Okay, shoot me cause I don't even like cheesecake! I know, I know- people think I'm crazy! But cream cheese has never made a fan outta me, nor has cheesecake. Trust, I've tried and tried to like it. Being the dessert whore that I am, this is what I do at Cheesecake... After a meal, I order the Godiva Chocolate Brownie sundae, tiramisu, or strawberry shortcake to eat in. Thennnn I have my chocolate cake TO-GO, to have all to myself at home later haha. I must pay tribute to my most favorite-est chocolate cake ever, Chocolate Truffle Tower cake! I realize in my first review I didn't give credit where credit was due. Thin layers and layers of moist chocolate cake and chocolatey mousse, then frosted with chocolate truffle frosting (not too rich) and then the sides are coated with shards of chocolate. It's then topped off with possibly the best whipped cream ever. The whipped cream holds up on its own too- stays thick and creamy for days... it doesn't melt down to a watery mess over your yummy cake after some time. For years, Cheesecake Factory has made a regular out of me for this cake."
Surge C.,"San Diego, United States",305,588,1302,2.0,26/12/2010,"DISCLAIMER: REVIEW BASED ONLY ON THE TERRIBLE SERVICE, NOT FOOD. I love Cheesecake Factory. However, this is not the location I would choose to go to again. Our wait was less than 10 minutes for my boyfriend and I, yet the hostess forgot she told us that and immediately sat the couple who came in after us and asked for a seat. Strike 1. When I mentioned this, she apologized and proceeded to take us to an open table with one of the worst waiters I have ever had. I wish I could remember his name...UGH. We repeatedly asked for break, which he did not bring until the VERY END of our meal. Are you kidding me?! Then he kept forgetting to bring my cocktail and kept apologizing for it. Well, if you were TRULY sorry, I doubt you would make this mistake about 3 times. He was another waiter that had a disappearing act problem. We did not even get the tab from him. Of course I left, unsatisfied, pissed off, and normally I will leave some sort of tip because I feel bad, but he gave us such terrible service, I made sure to leave the EXACT amount in cash. Cheesecake Factory in Union Square...you need to step up your game and obviously replace some people on your staff. For being in such a popular location, I would expect way more."
Angela S.,"Oakland, United States",71,14,35,5.0,12/10/2014,"The Stake Diane is my absolute favorite and that new ""Lemon Meringue"" Cheesecake is so good."
Dayae K.,"Los Angeles, United States",182,331,7,4.0,18/1/2011,"Had a very pleasant time at this cheesecake. First, it's on top of Macy's in the heart of San Francisco. The view from the restaurant was very nice. The only reason why I'm writing a review for the restaurant was because our server, Tiffany, was seriously one of the best waitresses I've had at a restaurant. My friends and I were starving and she was very quick, friendly, and caring. The food at cheesecake is always pretty delicious. I especially like their Asian chicken salad and Thai noodle salad."
Shi Shi P.,"Walnut Creek, United States",0,224,15,5.0,19/1/2013,"I came here the other day because it was conveniently located to where we were shopping...not my first choice.  I received some bad news so we stepped in for a much needed drink at the bar. We were greeted by the most charismatic, sincere, beautiful sharp server. Her name was something like Ashwini (i checked the receipt)  She was intuitive and did not bother us when we were talking but made sure to check in when the time seemed right She was super funny and even got my vodka gimlet order right which no one seems to get down the first time. She cheered me up not even knowing that she was doing so.  We ordered cheesecake to go and ummm...delicious!!! We ordered the pineapple upside down and the original with strawberries...soooo good! I will def be back because of her!!!"
B ..,"Vallejo, United States",103,59,112,3.0,17/12/2013,"Was pretty nice, had a good time great drinks bar tender that helpd us had patience, and made great drinks. Yummy appetizers. Yummy cake. Very loud and long wait so make sure you put in a reservation. I had the steak diane and shrimp scampi with fries the steak i did not like very much but it was because of the caramel onions. Yuck scampi and fries were good."
Kevin R.,"San Francisco, United States",192,113,455,4.0,25/2/2014,"This place is great! The only downfall is if you don't get there early enough you have to normally wait for a table for about an hour or so.  Worth the wait on a nice day and you get a window or outside seat. All the staff is very friendly here.  The food is pretty good as well.  In fact there are not many items you could not find on their very extensive menu.  Oh yeah, the views are cool as well."
Karen W.,"Fremont, United States",38,33,58,2.0,25/2/2015,"Food wise I would give a 4 star, but it gets only 2 this time for bad service from the time we walked up. The two kids at the front could barely be bothered with ud, then gave a pager for a 10 minute wait. During that 10 minutes, I saw several parties being seated who arrived after us. I approached the kid at the desk and asked why Noone else had a pager, and that several parties had been seated before us. He just said without looking at me that we were next. We were standing another come of minutes while another party got seated again before us. We ended up leaving. Customer service starts at the door. Coss this location off my list."

The only reason why I'm writing a review for the restaurant was because our server, Tiffany, was seriously one of the best waitresses I've had at a restaurant. My friends and I were starving and she was very quick, friendly, and caring. The food at cheesecake is always pretty delicious. I especially like their Asian chicken salad and Thai noodle salad."

I received some bad news so we stepped in for a much needed drink at the bar. We were greeted by the most charismatic, sincere, beautiful sharp server. Her name was something like Ashwini (i checked the receipt)  She was intuitive and did not bother us when we were talking but made sure to check in when the time seemed right She was super funny and even got my vodka gimlet order right which no one seems to get down the first time. She cheered me up not even knowing that she was doing so.  We ordered cheesecake to go and ummm...delicious!!! We ordered the pineapple upside down and the original with strawberries...soooo good! I will def be back because of her!!!"

Very loud and long wait so make sure you put in a reservation. I had the steak diane and shrimp scampi with fries the steak i did not like very much but it was because of the caramel onions. Yuck scampi and fries were good."
Kevin R.,"San Francisco, CA",192,113,455,4.0,2/25/2014,"This place is great! The only downfall is if you don't get there early enough you have to normally wait for a table for about an hour or so.  Worth the wait on a nice day and you get a window or outside seat. All the staff is very friendly here.  The food is pretty good as well.  In fact there are not many items you could not find on their very extensive menu.  Oh yeah, the views are cool as well."
Karen W.,"Fremont, CA",38,33,58,2.0,2/25/2015,"Food wise I would give a 4 star, but it gets only 2 this time for bad service from the time we walked up. The two kids at the front could barely be bothered with ud, then gave a pager for a 10 minute wait. During that 10 minutes, I saw several parties being seated who arrived after us. I approached the kid at the desk and asked why Noone else had a pager, and that several parties had been seated before us. He just said without looking at me that we were next. We were standing another come of minutes while another party got seated again before us. We ended up leaving. Customer service starts at the door. Coss this location off my list."
