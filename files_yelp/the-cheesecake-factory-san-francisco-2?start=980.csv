Jacky F.,"Oakland, United States",9,13,5,3.0,23/2/2015,"Second time here and was disappointed. After waiting 45 mins to sit, the waiter forgot to out our order in!!! So we had to wait over an hr to get our food! To make up for it they offered us a complementary salad (mixed greens). By the time we got out food we were semi full! I ordered the shrimp scampi and steak diane, which was a bust! Usually shrimp scampi come with angel pasta and this one had no pasta and the steak was flavorless. My boyfriends burger was deeelish though!"
Storm C.,"Alhambra, United States",22,277,205,2.0,5/12/2012,"The place is nice, on top of Macy's and has the view of Union Square. Food is okay, been to other locations and they are all the same. The service here needs to be checked by management. The waitress is ""RUSHING"" us, and we have only been seated for 30 minutes and mind you we waited 1 hour for the table. She keeps asking if we are done, when clearly our plates where still full and one time she asked, my friend was in the process of picking food from the plate with his fork. ??? do you think he's done?"

Steph Q.,"San Francisco, United States",19,80,25,4.0,13/1/2014,"Melissa V, you are an awesome waitress. Came here about a horrendous service by Toast where I had to just walk out and come here for some TLC. :) Ordered breakfast food along with some cheesecake that is still sitting safely in my fridge ( I think ).  The omelette was good and the breakfast 2 eggs is what to be expected.  Really appreciated the quick and attentive service. Especially since I hate ice in my drinks and my waitress always made sure I was happy :)) THank YOu!"
Isaac H.,"San Francisco, United States",45,523,459,5.0,28/3/2013,When I first came here for my 22nd birthday. There was a long wait. I did not care. Come here for the good food and the chocolate cake. Also there is a good view of Union Square from here.
Rose F.,"San Ramon, United States",101,27,9,4.0,25/10/2012,I love the Cheesecake Factory not only for it's delicious cheesecakes. I think their food is even better than the cakes. I love the interior design inside the cheesecake factory. Prices are a little bit expensive but for sure it worth the quality of the food and the nice environment you sit. One great aspect of cheesecake factory is their waiters and waitresses. They are so so so great. I am sure that their management has selected their staff very carefully. The only problem is that the tables are so close to each other so sometimes I feel there is not much privacy and everybody can hear what I am talking. Other than this I have no other problem with this lovely place.
Aarie C.,"Oakland, United States",10,37,5,2.0,22/8/2013,"Stars for the view from the balcony seating.  My love had a little over an hour for her lunch break, and we thought wrongly that it would be an ample amount of time to eat here.  It was irritating to wait for so long to be seated as we watched and coveted an empty table for two outside, and when we were finally to be seated the host told us that we couldn't have that table because someone else at the bar requested it. Wtf? We sat there anyways and let him deal with it.  Our server was SLOW and inattentive. We weren't acknowledged until 10 minutes after being seated! The couple next to us was seated after us and even asked ""Have you guys been waited on yet? There are so many people working here."" Finally the guy (who didn't even give us his name!) brings us water. We ordered then. He poured us more water once, we had to ask for more bread. He never bothered to check on us after we got our food.  He completely disappeared when we needed boxes and our check... We waited another ten minutes and decided to leave the food and pay at the host's booth. The host was too busy to help us. The last straw. You would think that even after horrible service someone would be around to collect the money! Even a free meal was not worth the time wasted by this place."
Sara B.,"Rancho Cordova, United States",174,170,142,3.0,30/7/2013,"I had always wanted to sit on top of the Macy's tower in Union Square and go to the Cheesecake Factory. This past Saturday, we paid SF a visit and did just that. The restaurant was packed, especially since the area is known for having tourists. We were told the wait would be between 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. It was 8 o'clock at night, we were starving, and didn't feel like looking elsewhere, so we decided to wait it out. Well, the wait ended up being 2 hours! Last minute I asked if we could sit outside, instead, since it seemed to be a little less chilly than it was 2 hours ago, but was told the wait time would be even longer. No, thanks! So, we were seated indoors in a nice booth at the corner of the restaurant and the lights were dim, as all Cheesecake Factory's are. We ordered their avocado egg rolls and fried calamari to start off with. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was delicious, as expected, especially the calamari. Our waitress also brought out a basket full of fresh bread and butter; kudos to her for bringing another one out once she saw we finished the first one.  For dinner, I was feeling adventurous. Usually I go with their baja chicken tacos but wanted to try something new, so, I ordered their fettuccine Alfredo without chicken. Let me tell you, it was TO DIE FOR. So creamy, so delicious, and melt-in-your-mouth good. I couldn't even finish half of it, though, partly because it was so rich and partly because we had gorged on bread and appetizers beforehand.  Overall, we had a nice dining experience here but would have appreciated a much lesser wait time. I can't condone a 2 hour wait time (especially when I can go to my local CF and have a 30 minute wait time), so I have to give this location 3 stars!"
Veronica F.,"Ontario, United States",0,30,6,5.0,4/11/2015,"If I could rate the bartender alone I would.  We went in for my boyfriends 25th bday and we decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, we quickly decided to stay at the bar because the bartender was super inviting.   Ashwini was THE BEST bartender We have ever encountered!!!

I could never of hoped to have this type of service on my first ccf visit.  She not only made perfect personalized drinks for me and my boyfriend but for the busy whole bar. She did not stop there, she then ordered signature must tries for all of us and they were SO GOOD! The rating this store has is not up to par of the service we all received.  I will definitely be back, not only because of the awesome food and drinks but because of ashwinis killer service.   She went above and beyond what I could ever expect at a chain.  she made his birthday even more memorable by being herself(the greatest) .   At the end of our visit we had a plate full of food left and we  were going to leave it for trash, this beautiful hearted woman suggested we wrap it and take it to one of many hungry San Franciscans outside.

See you next month!!!  - Justin and roni"
Radoslaw D.,"Gdańsk, Poland",101,84,4,3.0,6/10/2014,Nice venue worth going just for the view. Food is ok too but nothing exceptional. Waiting time is ridiculously long.
N S.,"San Francisco, United States",52,63,846,5.0,28/10/2012,omggg! i love this place! i came here for the very first time on my birthday. and its SOO PRETTY LIKE OMIGOD. its like thise high class restaurants. and theres a outdoor seating! where u can sit outside and enjoy the view behing a glass . its so pretty! or u can be indoors. i chose to be outdoors at nightime . LOL. they have theseheater things. so it wasnt cold at all in the outdoor seating. me and my parents were so impressed with this place!. my favorite food there is the tomato basil pasta. i can taste like actual tomato they slice up in the pasta it tastes soo good! especially with cheese. i also tried the vanilla bean cheesecake there. it was so filling and big. we had 4 ppl and only shared one cheesecaketoo. LOL . there are so many other things there i want to try! for sure coming back here agaib.! ps the bathroom is very clean
Victoria G.,"San Francisco, United States",217,27,37,3.0,8/8/2013,"Today my sister and I decided to have lunch here to catch up and enjoy a nice meal. As we entered Macy's we just see a huge line for the elevator so we chose to take the escalator to beat the crowded, as we entered cheesecake factory we see that it is veryyy packed knowing that we would probably have to wait long in order for us to be seated. The host said that it would probably be a 30 minute wait for a table so we were like whatever sure we take it but we thought it would be a good lunch since we only waited about 10 minutes for a table.  HOWEVER, I was wrong! We waited about 20 mins until our waiter came to ask us what we wanted to drink and bring our bread out then waited another 10 mins until he came back to ask for our orders. Then customers came about 20 mins after us and sat next to us with the same waiter who helped them out and was right on task with them which I thought was odd. Also, their food seem to come out quicker than ours. Our food came out about 10 minutes after the customers next to us.  The food we ordered was jambalaya pasta and pasta da vinci, they were both so delicious which we thought was the best part of our time there. The jambalaya pasta only comes in the large dinner portion dish so I suggest to be very hungry before ordering that and if you enjoy Cajun flavor food then I would recommend you to order this. Pasta da vinci is made of chicken, mushroom, onions, penne pasta with madeira wine sauce which I love the flavor of so if you do too then I recommend this dish and trust me the flavor will fill you up.  I've gone to cheesecake factory so many times in my life and I would have to say that this was such a bad experience from the service side. I gave it a 3 rating because I've had much better experience from here before and I know they could do better. Plus the waiter I had today was also the same waiter from the time I went with my boyfriend which was about 2 months ago."
Sujan H.,"Sydney, Australia",290,185,652,4.0,25/12/2010,"Whether you are a tourist or a SF resident I think TCF is a fun place to come.  Waiting does suck and if you haven't got time to wait, just come up hear to soak up the view of Union Square (if you are a tourist).   Having said that what we had (Shrimp Scampi & steak, Chicken medallions) were good.    My mum who was visiting from New Zealand enjoyed being in a huge restaurant with so many people.  We were too full for any dessert but will come back for cheesecakes (probably to go) another time."
Chris L.,"San Francisco, United States",665,1731,1158,5.0,11/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory has so many great memories - it's like an adult McDonald's.  Bad for you calorie-wise but good experience.  We have come here several times and when the wait is long, we'll wait around the bar area like vultures for a spot.  Once I get a Georgia Peach drink, I'm good to go and usually I order the pasta.  And the salmon firecracker rolls.  And I eat the brown bread with butter.  I feel like such a fatty writing this review but I love Cheesecake Factory!  Esp the view of Union Square and all the tourists who look confused while waiting for their table.  It's really a madhouse eating here - last time, I was walking and realized I had kicked a small child with my stiletto when he jailbroke from his dad and ran between people.  I'm surprised he didn't fall!  or cry... haha"
Angel C.,"San Bruno, United States",21,13,,3.0,22/1/2014,"This place is outrageous. I recognize that I came here on a really busy night (Sunday night of PAX weekend), but there was a 15 person line for the to-go cheesecake line and a handful of people behind the counter cranking out orders. They were clearly hard working and really trying to go fast. BUT, the guy taking orders, was also the same guy taking payments, and bagging the cheesecake orders as they came up, and delivering the cake to the 10 more people waiting for their order. What's up with that?? Talk about bottleneck! I really appreciate their efforts, but I ended up waiting 30 minutes just for two slices (that were waiting on the counter for 10 minutes).  Redeeming factor to justify 3 star rating: Cheesecake was delicious - I had lemon raspberry and kahlua and both were MONEY. But questionable whether they were worth it for the long unpleasant and crowded wait"

Stephanie D.,"San Pablo, United States",181,42,36,4.0,16/1/2011,"I owe my dues to this CF location just for the location & nostalgia it brings dating back to high school. It was the miso salmon & 50,000 cal. vanilla bean cheesecake slice that contributed to my baby fat because I found the word 'no' distasteful in general...every..other..weekend. Birthdays, group dates, first date, friend dates...were all at this Cheesecake location. I mean, CF isn't the best but it isn't thee worst CHAIN either. Housed on top of the Macy's in Union Square this CF is a busy one yet the times i've been there i have always managed to get seated within 15 minutes tops. Food, decent considering this is a chain but does have decent options for most tastes.  My top 3 CF picks: 1. Miso Salmon 2. Fried macaroni (I love the stuff) 3. Vanilla bean cheesex...cake. I do appreciate the cheesecake. There's something about open rooftop dining that I fancy, especially since this CF overlooks shopping of Union Square.  No other ground-level cheesecake location will have me frequent them either."
Greg J.,"San Francisco, United States",10,93,2,1.0,10/2/2015,I can't even BEGIN to tell the Yelp community the countless number of times they have messed up on my SIMPLE to go orders. I have no clue what they are doing at this location. They have about 500 people working the food line and the take out section yet somehow always mess up. Your safest bet is to either eat here so you can see what you are getting and make sure it's made right or just go to another location (which are all outside of SF).
Jordan C.,"Portland, United States",1,3,,2.0,30/4/2015,"I've been a big fan of the CF growing up, however, this experience fell a bit flat. Service was actually satisfactory, but when I took that first bite of fish I knew I was gonna be stopping by ol Long John Silvers on the way home. I will say though the bartender made a pretty mean White Russian. I'll give these guys another shot for sure so hopefully the fish will be better next time."
Amy Y.,"San Francisco, United States",114,81,83,4.0,30/12/2012,"The 4 stars only goes to the cheesecake. Step 1: Go into Macy's main entrance across from Union Square Step 2: Turn to your right and wait for the elevator Step 3: Once inside elevator, go to 8th floor If you are only here for Cheesecake, go to step 5 If not, Step 4: Go to the left to the mai'tre D and wait at least an hour. (go downstairs one floor to sit on the Macy's furniture if too crowded in the lobby) Step 5: Go to the right and order a slice of cheesecake! (Or 2) ***Cheesecake: Less cheesy and more on the creamy side.  900 CALORIES PER SLICE!! Share it with your honey ;) More sweet/tart depending on the cheesecake. Ranges from Key Lime to Red Velvet. ***Enjoy the view outside (don't have to eat to see it)"

I do appreciate the cheesecake. There's something about open rooftop dining that I fancy, especially since this CF overlooks shopping of Union Square.  No other ground-level cheesecake location will have me frequent them either."
Greg J.,"San Francisco, CA",10,93,2,1.0,2/10/2015,I can't even BEGIN to tell the Yelp community the countless number of times they have messed up on my SIMPLE to go orders. I have no clue what they are doing at this location. They have about 500 people working the food line and the take out section yet somehow always mess up. Your safest bet is to either eat here so you can see what you are getting and make sure it's made right or just go to another location (which are all outside of SF).
Jordan C.,"Portland, OR",1,3,,2.0,4/30/2015,"I've been a big fan of the CF growing up, however, this experience fell a bit flat. Service was actually satisfactory, but when I took that first bite of fish I knew I was gonna be stopping by ol Long John Silvers on the way home. I will say though the bartender made a pretty mean White Russian. I'll give these guys another shot for sure so hopefully the fish will be better next time."

Step 1: Go into Macy's main entrance across from Union Square Step 2: Turn to your right and wait for the elevator Step 3: Once inside elevator, go to 8th floor If you are only here for Cheesecake, go to step 5 If not, Step 4: Go to the left to the mai'tre D and wait at least an hour. (go downstairs one floor to sit on the Macy's furniture if too crowded in the lobby) Step 5: Go to the right and order a slice of cheesecake! (Or 2) ***Cheesecake: Less cheesy and more on the creamy side.  900 CALORIES PER SLICE!! Share it with your honey ;) More sweet/tart depending on the cheesecake. Ranges from Key Lime to Red Velvet. ***Enjoy the view outside (don't have to eat to see it)"
