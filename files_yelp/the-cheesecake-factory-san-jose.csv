Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",124,7,4,5.0,1/1/2018,"I took advantage of the two free slices w/$25 egift card last week which tends to take place at the end of every year. It's new years so I assumed the wait would be long (was told 45 minutes when we arrived).  Decided to swing by the bar and luckily there were two empty seats. We were greeted by Julius and another bartender, both were very friendly and tended to us for all of our needs throughout our stay.  Ordered some finger foods from the light menu and a few drinks. Received some warm bread while we waited. Everything arrived in a timely manner and was very delicious. Had no issues using the egift card and free slice codes. Both pieces arrived very quickly."
Jasmine P.,"San Jose, CA",174,103,382,3.0,12/21/2017,"The wait is about half an hour for an evening dinner on a weekday. It's not so bad since the restaurant is in a mall. They have a lot of seats for you to wait at or you can do a little shopping while waiting. After we got seated, it took a long time for the server to come by and take our orders. It also took quite a while for the food to come out. You get some bread and butter to eat while waiting for the food. The warm crab and artichoke dip was a good appetizer. It was very warm and gooey. Absolutely wonderful with the warm toasted bread that was served with it. The avocado eggrolls are a bit different, but the flavors worked out very well. The dipping sauce that came with it was also ice and tangy. The fish tacos were decent. I thought it was a bit dry. The tacos came with some beans and rice on the side. I've never really liked the ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory. Something about their lighting. It's just terrible lighting that just makes everything so dark and dingy looking."
Shannen R.,"San Jose, CA",266,394,225,4.0,12/20/2017,"Oh the New Found Glory! No, not the rock band, the new cheesecake glory! Waited only 10 minutes on a busy Saturday afternoon to be seated - woo! Their Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake was delicious. It was flavorful, soft, and cheesy. I could pass on the whip but my S/O likes it. Their bacon cheese breadsticks are amazing. There was a tasty crunch to each bite. There was lots of bacon and lots of cheese, enough said. I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory but hated the long wait times. Thank you!"
Christine H.,"San Jose, CA",68,300,1324,5.0,12/12/2017,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factories before, but this was actually my first time visiting the Oakridge location.  I stopped by here with my fam for a birthday celebration, and I really enjoyed the dine-in experience. We came in and were seated about 20 minutes later. We were paired up with Ashley (who was an excellent waitress by the way), and the rest of the night went well. 1) The bread and butter here are delicious and addicting (don't eat too much though because you might not have room for the actual entree). 2) We got all the correct orders, and our food arrived in a timely manner (20~25 min) for five dishes? 3) The Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta was...super good! It WAS expensive (like the rest of the dinner items here), but the portion was HUGE (probably enough for two or three meals, depending on your appetite).  4) Free birthday sundae for the birthday person? Great! It was actually good (but too much whip cream in proportion to the ice cream/fudge). A few down-sides: too dark (I know they're going for the whole dim thing, but it was hard to see even the face of a person across from us...then again, as long as you can see the people next to you, it's ALL GOOD-more intimate and private)+a little noisy (but what can you do? It's a huge restaurant?!)+crowded waiting area (There's already enough seating for around 12 people in the front, but the amount of people waiting seemed to be close to double that amount). All in all, the experience we had was great! Props to Ashley for her service."
Amit S.,"San Jose, CA",35,118,122,2.0,9/8/2017,"This was our third visit to Cheesecake Factory.  The wait time was less than 30 minutes and the server was extremely friendly. We ordered pot stickers, vegetarian burger and Cajun jambalaya pasta. The pot stickers and the burger were good. The Cajun jambalaya chicken pasta dish was bad. I did not enjoy it all. The Cheesecakes were as always a delight."
Amy T.,"San Francisco, CA",77,85,152,2.0,11/16/2017,"Came here on a Saturday night, it was packed.  Initially, I accidentally parked in one of the ""Cheesecake factory"" spots in the parking lot right in front of the valet area. It was too dark to see the first time, but good thing I double checked because in small black lettering underneath ""Cheesecake factory"" it says the limit is 10 minutes and this is a spot designated for picking up orders only. Don't make the same mistake as me! The wait was about 30-40 minutes, after I reparked my car, my party has already been seated so I started walking towards the back to the booths to find them. I guess I almost walked into the kitchen area because I was stopped abruptly by one of the staff working there. He was very assertive and pushy and asked me to go back to the front desk to be escorted to find my party.  I noticed the food at Cheesecake factory tends to be pretty much the same everywhere but the service can make a big difference. I know this is a very busy restaurant chain but the wait time between each time the wait staff came back to check on us was way too long. And we can tell because we were there for 1.5 hours and half of that time was just waiting for him to come back. Each time he approached our table, he was already getting ready to leave.  3.5 for the food, 1.5 stars for the service."
Mark P.,"San Jose, CA",8,109,73,1.0,11/10/2017,"The bartender joe made a very good well mannered dirty martini ! I recommend to anyone if she is working. UPDATE: the bartender I mentioned before was cool like I said but however I visited today and the new staff was unprofessional and weren't able to do there job. I asked for a table in the bar when I got there and they said no there's someone before you waiting for it, I said ok. 20 minutes went by and they still never filled the table. I told the hostess and she smiled and didn't say anything to me. She then went and found another set of people to finnaly and filled the table. I asked for the manger who was even more careless about the situation. Last time going back there."
Nik R.,"San Jose, CA",103,8,4,1.0,11/18/2017,"It should be a ZERO rating. Worst service possible. We put in our food order right when we sat down and it's taken over an hour to get our dinners. They said that there was a long list of pastas in queue but the tables around us got their pastas and they have only been waiting 10-15 minutes. The manager came by and was no help. He made excuses and didn't say much. I understand restaurants get busy and orders take long but tickets shouldn't take 60+ minutes. I've worked at busier restaurants and never taken more than 30 minutes.  There are better places to eat that have better service than this establishment. Don't waste your time and money on the Cheesecake Factory. Our bill was $88 for average pasta that didn't have any fresh basil and a cold bang bang chicken and shrimp. Really disappointed in the quality of food and service. Also, my cheesecake is missing some of the top layer. Another example of their poor quality."
John N.,"Santa Cruz, CA",60,12,6,2.0,12/19/2017,I took s hot girl out on a date here and it went alright. The bartender was really nice and the ahi dip was quite delicious. I had a beer and when I went to take a piss there was puke all over the urinal! Don't eat the spaghetti I guess
Lori F.,"San Jose, CA",7,11,65,1.0,12/20/2017,I've been on hold for the past twenty minutes twice trying to place a phone order. No one is picking up. The first time I was disconnected and now I've been on hold for twenty minutes. This is ridiculous. Perhaps not having curbside pickup or at least checking in with your patiently wiaitng customer is a good idea.
Simon T.,"Newark, CA",0,9,1,2.0,12/11/2017,food was good although it took 20 minutes to get a appetizer to the table.  And when we got it it was the wrong dish. Service have a big table so she don't care about us (2) . the funny part is that we came with an gift card from the past bad experience i had with cheesecake factory on to go order .  very disappointed of this location.
Ann N.,"San Jose, CA",32,1,3,5.0,11/2/2017,"Me and my best friend had a ""romantic"" date here just a moment earlier. The food was good, service was on point. My friend had her fav pasta carbonara and I got my delightful tomato basil pasta. We ordered cheesecakes for dessert but couldn't finish them since the portion was large Love dinning here with my friends and family  Gonna come back for more"
Duane C.,"San Jose, CA",19,33,10,1.0,12/6/2017,"I tried calling to order take out tonight. The receptionist transferred my call to the take out counter very promptly. That is when I remained on hold for 16 minutes without anyone checking on who might be on hold. I hung up, and I immediately redialed. The receptionist answered promptly. I asked to speak with a manager, and she said she would track one down for me. After sitting on hold for 11 minutes without anyone checking on me again, I hung up.  No sales for Cheesecake Factory from me. Your mileage may vary."

Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",968,1930,3483,4.0,12/14/2017,"I remember being in high school when this place first opened. There were always long waits and it was the fancier of meals my family would have. It was always a special occasion if you were dining at Cheesecake Factory (after all, there were table clothes and the waiters wore button up shirts with ties and slacks). My favorite meals here were the chicken madeira and chicken marsala. Dad would get some kind of steak dish and mom might get a pasta or fish. Can you believe the very 1st Cheesecake Factory was open in 1978? I had no idea this chain was around for that long. I came here for National Cheesecake day once because they had a buy one get one half off cheesecake deal. The menu here is huge and portions are large. Their plates are usually good enough for 2 people. I often want to finish my own plate but the calorie content in these dishes are high. The interior reminds me of an Egyptian-esque Vegas hotel casino lobby. It is dim with vaulted ceilings and an unidentifiable style."
Rina C.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,1,4.0,12/31/2017,This restaurant is definitely in my top 3 in San Jose. My go to dish is the fettuccine alfredo. I get it without chicken. And it is one of the best I've tried. I even like the flavor of it the day after when I eat for leftovers. The bread is good and nice selection of drinks.
Elizabeth M.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,4,1.0,12/26/2017,Jimmy and Kevin at the bar are awesome and great customer service always a smile and fast. Whatever we want we got it in a second. They are great and I recommend come when they are working they get a 5 start but  I had to remove the 5 star because I came again on 12/26/17 Service sucks and their was hair in my food worst service ever
Mario M.,"San Jose, CA",32,55,59,4.0,8/17/2017,Came on a Thursday evening was not packed was seated within five minutes wifey ordered the lemon herb chicken with mashed potatoes I ordered the Hibachi Steak it arrived pretty late maybe about 40 minutes later food was delicious ordered a banana cheesecake it was a bit Frozen we told the waitress and was nice enough to give us another one to go waitress was a bit slow and did not come to the table to see if you needed anything
Melissa N.,"San Jose, CA",16,123,275,5.0,6/27/2017,"Regardless if the service is a hit or miss (this time was a miss, although I'm writing this review after the fact, so I forgot his name) the food is still really good. Every time I crave food from there, it always comes out cooked well and full of flavor.  For appetizers we ordered: calamari and chicken pot stickers. For entrees, we ordered: steak Diane and herb crusted salmon (factory combo) along with chicken Bellagio. The appetizers are always a hit, especially the calamari. The pot stickers were soaked in this really strong ginger sauce, and we didn't really like it. It was too over powering and just not to our liking. Next time we order that (and we will), we will mention, light on the sauce. Our entrees were made to order, especially my steak Diane. Medium cooked. Perfect We also had some adult beverages, blood orange mojito and typhoon punch, or something like that. Both were tasteful. I feel like the only draw back is that the lighting in the restaurant is so dark. I'm not really sure what kind of ambiance they're going for, but it's dark, for me. I don't really like that. Eh, but I'll get over it. Lol. We'll be back again soon enough."
Jon N.,"Patterson, CA",128,23,18,1.0,8/5/2017,"Our waiter's worst night ever.  He had to come back 4 times because food was out. This caused our tables order to drag out super badly. Then after this adventure, while paying our checks our waiter lost one of the credit cards!  Dear Cheesecake Factory,        After all this nightmare, we still couldn't be comp'd??? Well we will not be back, and we will make sure everyone knows just how badly this restaurant runs. Please let Gordon Ramsey come here and rip them a new one! Signed,   Your annoyed guest!"
Tim W.,"San Jose, CA",53,2,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"This location just plan out sucks. Get in around 8pm walk to the front and the hostess just looks at me with a blank look on her face. No welcome not even a hello. Very rude. The last time I was here my server only checked on me once, but he's surrounding tables got served rite away. He checked on the surrounding tables several times. I had to get a manager to get my bill. Love the food, but the service here is the worst. To add on. Just got done eating around 845pm. Just now around 940pm got the bill. Never again"
Yaya O.,"Santa Clara, CA",19,62,15,5.0,8/14/2017,"Please read why I 5 stared it. The seating took about 30 minutes. The hostesses male/girl is ignored us and walked away. The male was on his cellphone didn't see him back until I went the bathroom still on the phone. - No greeting - No please hold - NOTHING  I was pisst off . Lucky, a server checked us in and told us a wait time. I wish they took reservations So now I'm waiting...  Finally we get seated  Mia was our server right of the jump she was pleasant and very on it. I ordered drinks within minutes they were at our table. Checked on us to make sure everything is great because her was 5 star review . Suggestions: hire people who want to be there a customers impression of your restaurant is based of the employees and if they are unpleasant that's how the service will because you upset the consumer from the start."
Eddie A.,"Citrus Heights, CA",10,11,,2.0,12/20/2017,Had a terrible dining experience here Sunday night waited 40 minutes to be seated then 20 more minutes to be served a drink. Ordered two hamburgers a chicken parmesan and a child's meal of pasta. Two meals came out in about 20 minutes the other two meals which were hamburgers took an additional 15 minutes when we receive them they were undercooked and bloody when they were supposed to be medium-well. Ask to speak to a manager ended up canceling the hamburgers paying for the two meals that were eaten and the drinks. It took from 6:30 till almost 9 p.m. and we ended up never seen the appetizer. Will never return
Quyen H.,"San Jose, CA",631,202,624,4.0,11/16/2016,"This deserves a four star because I really had a grand time here with my dad. The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night dinner.  I ordered the steak Diane and that was a lot different than what I expected. However it was a good different! It came with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and water crest (I think that's what it's called). A unique substitution from your average greens. I must say the sauce was very delicious. It paired really well with the steak and mashed potatoes. I had asked for medium on my steak and it was cooked perfectly at medium. Thank you to the chef! One thing that surprised me was the portion. It was humongous! If you look at the picture, it doesn't do it justice. The place was so big!  My dad ordered the Thai glazed salmon with brown rice. Now we couldn't really tell if it was actually brown rice or what kind of sauce was on the plate because this place has no freaking lights! It was so dark people around me were using the flashlights on their phone to read the menu. Y'all need more lighting in this place! But anyways the Thai glazed salmon was bomb digs. It tasted really healthy and the salmon was flakey and so moist. I would highly recommend!  Oh yes other goods, the bread. I don't know what it's called by the brown bread was my favorite. It was a little sweeter but if anyone knows the name of the bread, do share!  We were going to order the coffee cheesecake but they ran out. Boo so next time, we'll be back for the cheesecake!"
Mary O.,"San Ramon, CA",6,14,105,4.0,5/31/2017,"Me and my fiance used to regularly eat at this location, we actually had a few friends that worked here in college.  We will stop by when we are in the are in the area and eat here from time to time.  The service isn't any better or worse than you would expect from a large chain. Go here on a busy day and time and you can expect it to be busy even if you have a reservation. Sometimes our waiters/waitresses do play favorites with other tables since we usually just get water and appetizers and they expect a lower tip from us.  Parking here can be pretty hectic and it's set up really weird, there are 2 lanes but it's only one way. I'm sure they did this after testing it out but still pretty weird. Plan for about 10-20ish mins to find parking/walking if you are going on a busy day. As for the food you can't go wrong with the buffalo blasts or the spaghetti. The tamale cakes are delicious to but make sure to hold the sour cream or get it on the side it totally over powers the dish.  Either way this place is a solid 4 stars in our book."
Monique J.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,2,3.0,11/6/2017,"Good food, kid friendly table and utensils are clean  bathrooms are clean waiters /waitress are friendly. every time I go I always had a good experience, however I did call to order for pick up  the phone line was busy which I don't understand, they should figure that out . It's a well-known restaurant, Once I got  through and order  I pick up my food everything my order was right nothing was missing .I will say they do need to work on that  phone issue when it comes to ordering for pick ups.  Plus there curb side pick up is horrible I order 3 items two cheesecake and some egg rolls took them 40mins to bring it out I was so piss on top of that they forgot utensils  this was recently!"
Ray F.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/1/2017,"The worst restaurant ever , food with no taste and the manager and the workers are very rude , they even follow people to the restroom , and when I asked the racist manager why,  he said because we don't trust anyone !! I don't recommend it .."
Charlotte G.,"Freedom, CA",36,33,251,2.0,10/17/2017,"I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory two times.  The first time was over fifteen years ago and it was with my older sister.  Unfortunately my memories of visiting a Cheesecake Factory are not pleasant.  All I remember was the wait to be seated was long but the food was NOT worth the wait.  I recall having ordered a salmon dish that did not taste very good.  I ordered their Miso Salmon.  Unfortunately it was like eating a frozen fish dinner.  It was overly salty and not fresh.  It tasted very processed.  I believe their over seasoning their food is to mask the fact that the food they serve is frozen and not very fresh. Last Christmas my Boyfriend received a $25 gift card for here.  During the Summer we decided to stop by and use the gift card towards a dessert.  Mostly because of my bad experience eating one of their entrees and with the high prices of the items on their menu, $25 just doesn't go very far.  The parking lot was pretty packed which is to be expected because the restaurant is located within a shopping mall.  We were lucky enough to find parking but I can see that parking can be an issue.  Once we arrived at the restaurant we headed straight for the dessert display case.  They had pretty much every kind of cheesecake imaginable.  From your fruit cheesecakes to the more rich chocolate flavors.  I love Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups and decided to order a slice of their Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  It had chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in their original cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and caramel.  It was cloyingly sweet.  Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because it was too sweet!  My Boyfriend ordered a slice of their Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake.  It's their original cheesecake topped with glazed, fresh strawberries.  He seemed to like it.  To give you a perspective of their pricing, a $25 gift card just barely covered the cost of two slices of cheesecake!  We still have like $5 (give or take) left on the gift card.  Unfortunately the desserts were nothing special and we are likely going to never use the remaining balance on that gift card.  There entrees and cheesecakes are pretty and professionally decorated but the flavors do not match their outward appearance.  Buying a cheesecake here is like buying any old frozen cheesecake you can purchase from the frozen food section of a grocery store.  Which is sad considering the word ""cheesecake"" is in their restaurant name, you would expect them to make the best cheesecake in the world!  Unfortunately that is not the case.  The food is dressed up to look pretty and enticing but when you take your first bite, the actual taste is just okay.  I hate to be so blunt but I need to tell the truth for my fellow consumers.  This place is definitely overrated and overpriced."
Ankit K.,"San Jose, CA",2,88,53,4.0,6/18/2017,"So a wonderful experience. Chicken fish gumbo, pasta tomato and basil and finally anniversary chocolate cheesecake. Everything was great. Server was extremely patient and polite. Loved it."
Carmen V.,"San Jose, CA",1507,2390,10401,4.0,8/17/2017,"I was not expecting much considering my previous experiences in various Cheesecake factories everywhere, but I was very impressed with the ahi tuna salad, so fresh, big, healthy and flavorful. Maybe I am biased after our looooong wait and at that point i did not mind screaming kids, many kids everywhere, the loud happy birthday singing at many tables, the noise, the amount of people. Somehow the dim lights and the great non generic (as I was used to) saved my night after all. Our server was super sweet (we were a table of 4 adults and 3 kids) and very patient. I will go back to this one but not on a Saturday unless i feel lonely and i want to be surrounded by crowds."
Nanci P.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,2,1.0,12/12/2017,I got food poisoning from eating here at this location. Glass and silverware were DIRTY :(
Nadine R.,"Santa Monica, CA",34,25,39,1.0,10/4/2017,"Ordered a chocolate tower cake to go on Wednesday night at 10:30 pm ... it was pretty dim inside so I didn't notice the box, but as soon as I came back to my well-lit house, this was what I saw ...... my bf contacted the restaurant right away and asked for the manager (John) and he didn't acknowledge anything we had explained. Not even an apology. Thus, this yelp review...  We contacted the restaurant right away not because we were trying to get anything out of it, but simply because this needed to be addressed  due to how UNSANITARY the container of my food was!!!! Honestly like, there was dust gathered around the plastic! That's DISGUSTING!! Aren't all restaurants (especially ones like Cheesecake Factory) supposed to be held to a certain health standard?! Well this one failed. And so did customer service.  TO EVERYONE THAT ORDERS TO GO: PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR CONTAINERS BEFORE LEAVING THE RESTAURANT!! And I suggest you use your cellphone flashlights bc you won't be able to see clearly with how dim it is in there."
Stacia C.,"Pacific Grove, CA",66,44,28,1.0,1/10/2018,"We have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years. I am a creature if having and have been ordering the same Louisiana dish for years. My husband had a procedure done early before coming here to eat lunch and was very hungry. He ordered off the GF menu and received a child's size pasta dish and was charged $16. When we asked about the portion the waiter Christopher O. Laughed and said to him,"" we only serve lunch portion now. I feel ya Bro I'm on a 4000 calorie diet"" and flexed his little muscle. Didn't offer to help the situation. He bring my dish and it's something I have never ordered ever. He makes a comment as he goes to order the correct dish, ""man it's too early""! Cones back 10 minutes later and brings yet a skinny pasta dish that's is on a menu on the table I never looked at. At this point I was done! I marched straight to the manager who didn't care and didn't believe me and didn't try and help. When I asked WHY I was charged for the wrong dish the server bagged up for me he said he would take it off the bill but need the food back!!! I think both sever and waiter don't deserve those positions."
Kasey H.,"Modesto, CA",0,16,3,1.0,10/14/2017,"I'm sad to write this review because a Cheesecake Factory in a different location used to be my favorite. But I came here with my daughter. We first ordered a raspberry lemonade to share. Together we couldn't even finish the one cup of lemonade it was like a cupful of SUGAR. Where is the lemons!? I ordered a side salad to start with ranch. Again, despite being super hungry, I couldn't finish my small salad because the taste of dirty/bitterness. Hard to explain the off taste of the lettuce but hard tomatoes didn't help it any. Lastly, my daughter and I shared the lunch sized portion of fettuccini alfredo. Woah salt on a plate. No flavor but HEAVY salt. Needless to say we couldn't finished our shared lunch sized portion because it just didn't taste good! Im usually so easy to please but the food was just not good!  Server was very nice. Bread was good. That's about it :("
Orit A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,15,1,1.0,12/11/2017,"O.M.G Never going back to this location anymore.  Very poor service, too much waiting time for an appetizers that when finally arrived the was a mistake in the order.  Mybe once the waitres came to check on us. Asked desert menu and waited more then 10 min  We gave up from this location.  At least this time the food was good."
Jane B.,"San Jose, CA",157,171,46,1.0,11/21/2017,Extreme awful wait. Definitely not my place of choice for dinner. There are other options... the wait was so long I lost my appetite.
Abigail Joy Y.,"Vallejo, CA",6,11,13,1.0,8/21/2017,"Took my friend for his birthday here and I'm very disappointed. We waited for our food to be served over 30 minutes. I ordered the steak along side with green beans and had to wait for the green beans for another 15 minutes. Like seriously!? I'm about to finish my food and I told the waitress that it's my friend's birthday and wanted a cake and spelled my friend's name to her CLEARLY and told her that they don't have to sing to him because he doesn't like that and she agreed. After we eat I see her coming towards our table with 3 waitresses and saying ""You think we're gonna let you go without embarrassing you?"" and starts singing Happy Birthday (NOT COOL) and to make it worst they spelled my friend's name wrong. They put NANNY, instead of Manny. It was a disaster!! Never coming back here again."
Danielle A.,"San Jose, CA",17,7,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"I wish I could give this restaurant ZERO stars, because I wasn't even able to be seated at a table properly. The hosts, who were not paying the slightest bit of attention to anyone, gave my table away to people that had not even been called yet. Just took them back, didn't ask for their name or anything, although I had just given the other host my pager. Then they proceeded to take two other parties to their seats, and then took others' names, until we said something. We had to explain to them what it was they did wrong, when they could not figure it out after giving them our name. The only response we then received was that it would be a moment while they got us another table. No apologies or anything, from any of the FIVE employees standing there. The no apology was a deal breaker for me, so I told them the table was no longer needed and left. Forget the idea of customer service, we weren't even treated with common decency from this staff."
Isaiah P.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,17,,5.0,12/10/2017,"Food: Amazing, I ordered the rib eye stake and it was cooked perfectly, the chicken strips were amazing, the fries were very good, and the rice was very good. Customer service: The people are so nice here! And they are very helpful. Overall 5/5"
Jami N.,"Roseville, CA",415,400,416,5.0,7/30/2017,I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory they have such good food and huge selection to choose from I usually have the fried shrimp last time I got the turkey club. And that was very good made to perfection and for dessert I got the Adams peanut butter cup cheesecake that was the best part of the whole meal was getting yummy dessert
