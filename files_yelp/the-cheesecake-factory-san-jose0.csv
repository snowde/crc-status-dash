Lovegood F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",57,63,,5.0,6/14/2017,"Sat at the bar with Darren W.  Happy hour, always nice.  Darren was personable and helpful.  Everything was its usual, GREAT!  If you ever have eaten​ at the Cheesecake Factory you know there is something for everyone.  I prefer the Oakridge location over Westfield Valley Fair. My recommendation is to try something new, you will be pleasantly surprised."
Nancie D.,"San Jose, CA",31,100,77,3.0,11/21/2016,Food is good but I always eat too damn much of it! Service can be awesome or the worst you've ever had.  Cheesecake is always amazing but then again it is the cheesecake factory.  Good place to get together with friends to catch up.
Ashley H.,"Gustine, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2017,"Worst experience ever! We never received any bread after requesting it twice, when everyone around us was served bread twice. Waiter never checked in, except to bring me the check.Took another 25minutes to ge a manager after asking twice. Paid for our meals and all the manager could say was I'm sorry. Really dissapointed in this place and in our waitress Angela. My brothers first experience here was horrible. Thank you to the manager that couldn't do anything but apologize and ""follow up"". Real piece of work."
Adrian L.,"Salinas, CA",27,7,,3.0,9/29/2016,"Mixed feelings during this visit, food was good but I was disappointed with the servers. It took too long just to get my drinks and food. The place didn't seem so busy but the fact that my table kept getting different servers didn't help the timing. In fact, I wasn't asked for a refill by either of the servers and I had to literally track down a random server to even pay for my bill. Again, food was good but the experience could be better."
Lindsey L.,"San Jose, CA",38,2,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Ordered curbside the other night since I was recovering from broken ribs and it was easier to sit in the car than walk or stand. Ordered at 5 pm and parked at 5:45. Phoned into restaurant and was told they would let the staff know. I waited until 6:15 and called again to say I had been curbside for 30 minutes and again was told they would let the staff know. Called one more time at 6:20 and this time I was basically hung up on. As I drove away I called the manager to let him know about my frustration. Have been to the restaurant many times, but will very likely never return"
Kat B.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2017,If I could give zero stars I would this was my second time coming here fist time our waiter was super nice but our food took almost an hour to come out. They were busy and he gave us a complimentary soup. So we gave it another chance it wasn't to busy our wait was about 10 mins but our waiter was horrible he took 10 mins to bring us water and bread and we sat for about 40 minutes waiting for our food while watching everyone who was seated and ordered after us get there's . My husband got up to speak to the manager and not one apology just that there busy. The waiter never said a word not even if we needed a refill never will I go back to this location again. Worst service and management
Jay P.,"Falls Church, VA",0,5,1,2.0,7/3/2017,"Used to love this chain. But something has changed. Went on a week day recently. Got a steak - really bad for the cost. Also, waiters didn*t seem to know what they were doing. Had to wait for a long time after food was ordered. Definitely last visit to this chain. Bye bye!"
Phil R.,"San Jose, CA",188,56,91,1.0,9/5/2016,"They almost Killed me...... I am extremely allergic to all peanuts/ oil, etc. We informed our waiter last night as soon as he approached us that I was highly allergic to peanuts. My wife ordered chicken lettuce wraps with some type of Mexican sauce as he said there were no traces of nuts in it. I took a bite of it and immediately got the peanut attack. We called the waiter to double check what was in there and he called his manager to verify there were no peanuts in the wrap. My lips are blowing up and my face is getting red as they offered to get me Benadryl, or call 911, as we are waiting for meds I ran to the bathroom to vomit it up but still to late. They were nice people but had no idea what they did to me as I'm still lying in bed at home after taking 4 Benadryl and still all blown up 18 hours later..... They serve peanut oil and don't even know it..... I think the worse part of the entire experience was I feel they thought I was trying to get a free meal that I fully paid for even though I threw it up....."
Harini V.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I usually don't review  a place unless it's exceptional or really disappointing. Latter is the case now.This cheesecake factory location near valley Fair Mall , San Jose is unbelievable. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and the wait was 30-50 mins which is acceptable, but even after my buzzer went on we were not seated saying 'it doesn't work that way ' ,why the hell did you give me that thing then.. well, after we were seated, for 20 mins! ,none of the servers cared to come, let alone take our orders. I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old  and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server  and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing . How can I blame him if 'my table's server' didn't even bother to show up after all our talk with the manager which was after 45 mins wait . The manager who was a lady was like u don't have to pay any bill , I didn't taste any damn thing in ur restaurant to take out my wallet.  The worst worst part of everything is we had a 2 year old with us and inspire of telling them we had to feed the baby, their response was 'there was some miscommunication and your table didn't show up in the list to be served'... What the hell lady, can't u see us sitting there and forgive us your majesty for choosing to come to ur restaurant and yeah asking for ur food."

Laarnie B.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/8/2017,"I've been a loyal customer at this particular location and I've been coming here since it first opened. Today was the WORSE day I have ever experienced customer service, mainly with the front of the house host and manager. We came tonight to celebrate my nieces 8th grade graduation and from the look of it many other were celebrating their own. I made reservations at 5:18pm and the host ""Sasha"", if that is her real name and why doesn't anyone where name tags?. She told me an 1 and 1/2 wait for 7 people. I agreed and I gave her my number, she told me she will call me when our seats were ready. I came back in to check if maybe we got bumped in early, this was at 6:38pm. She then told me another 30 minutes. I said ""ok, we will wait"". As I stood there,  I can hear her tell other customers 3-4 hours, then tell another group of people 15- 25 minutes. I should have known at that point that my family and I were going to get screwed. But I put it in good faith that in 30mintues our table will be ready.  We waited outside, it was getting crowded. At 6:56pm we came back in. I held my phone in my hands to see if they would call me on my phone and waited to see if they would call me out loud. Ay 7:06 pm my sister waited in line to asked the same host if we will be seated soon, since its been 1 1/2 hrs already. While my sister was waiting I can hear Sasah, tell certain customers 45mins wait and tell others 15minutes wait. I want to know HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHY WOULD A HOSTED JUST GIVE RANDOM TIMES OF WAIT?  By the time my sister got to her, she said we have no seats. I came in and told ""how is that possible, we have been waiting over the time she told us?"" She exclaimed "" we've tried calling you"" I told her ""My phone never went off"" with a ton of back and forth she continued to argue with me and then the manager stepped in. With no apology for the inconvenience, he proceeded to still blame me for their mishap. He read out loud my phone number, he begain with 89 and I stopped him, letting him know my first 3 digits were 507. All three, who were behind the counter, Sasha, the Manager and a man named Bernard, (How I got their name?.. I asked their co workers later that evening), still persisted to blame me for giving them the WRONG phone number. WHICH IN FACT WASN'T, because Sasha repeat my number to me as she punched it in. DON'T Lie! The manager still said till be a 30 minute and another man said we'll get you in in 15. Customer service tonight was RIDICULOUS!!! I feel bad for every customer tonight who got duped. We did stay. My niece set her heart out on having her Graduation Dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I want to shout out to our server, Ileianna J and the other serves who helped her bust out our food and beverages. Shout out to the cooks and bussers, I know its a very busy night. As a person who has worked in the Hospitality Business for over 14 years, that was unprofessional and down right dirty. Some training and better time management for the host an over view on how to make the reservation system less flawed with help bring in more business. Telling people 3-4 hours for the next available table and others 15 - 20 minutes is money out the door."
Armando G.,"San Francisco, CA",196,2,2,1.0,6/7/2017,"got here just about when the warriors game ended, i was served by a hispanic male, victor. he came on as impatient as soon as he took our order, first he asked if we needed more time when we wanted to order. eventually we ordered and it took another 45 minutes for my quesadilla only to come out cold from the inside out, i kept asking for updates on our, again we only ordered appetizers, and for it to come out late & cold? disrespectful service from both the server and the manager. Working at a restaurant if a customer complains, being a manager you have to confront them and understand what they're saying, not disrespectfully come to our table and asked what happened, i gave him my food and he took off without saying anything, only ""i'll bring out a hot one."" i come here often and the service today was not one i would recommend to any other guests, have a great night victor. the managers name was jeremy, the caucasian skinny male. i'm definitely coming back to visit jeremy, you wait on it :)"
Geri F.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,57,58,4.0,7/3/2015,"Standard, busy location.  Our server, Michelle, was very polite and provided excellent service to my friend and I. They ran out of the brown bread for the longest time, but Michelle gave use each a couple of slice to take home.  The food serving is just a huge as always. I got the grilled salmon (comes with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli sides).  I got waayyyyy too much broccoli. The sides for this entree took up more room than the salmon did on the plate. (I posted a picture of my entree if interested) This is why I'm deducting a start --- their serving sizes feel like such a waste sometimes. Got a Red Velvet cheesecake slice for dessert.... delicious as always."
Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,3.0,1/19/2014,"My first attempt at this place was quite frustrating. I know happy hours are usually Mon-Fri but that is exactly why I called Saturday morning to make sure. A girl answered the phone and told me yes, they did have happy hour. My friend and I made the drive there and was told that in fact they do NOT have happy hour. I know it wasn't the hostess' fault because I don't know who I spoke with, but I let her know exactly how upset I was at being misinformed. The staff needs to get their information straight before answering customers' questions. My second attempt at coming for happy hour was much better. I called ahead again to make sure and was told it was Mon-Fri 4-6. It was a Friday evening and we came right at happy hour. You have the choice of either sitting at the bar, the tall tables, or a booth. My friend and I preferred the booth because it was a little bit cozier.  The menu was already on the table for us when we were seated. $5 drinks and appetizers during their happy hour which is a great deal. They had a few drink selections such as margarita, j.w.'s pink lemonade, mojito, and long island ice tea. I asked the waiter which drink was sweetest and he suggested the pink lemonade which I absolutely loved! My friend got the margarita, blended, and it was good but a bit salty for my taste. Their choices for appetizers are great. I ordered the road side sliders and the avocado eggrolls. I've had them before so I knew they were going to be great. The bun on the sliders were so soft and warm when they were brought out. The dipping sauce for the avocado eggrolls were definitely the highlight of the dish. For dessert I got my usual, the ultimate red velvet cheesecake! Who doesn't love cheesecake and red velvet?! It's heaven on a plate! Be warned that it is a rich piece of cake that you might want to share or it can be overwhelmingly sweet. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name of our waiter but he was fantastic! Took our order promptly, checked on us multiple times, brought us complimentary bread and butter, even made sure I liked my drink and was ready to bring me a second. If you were to come during regular hours I definitely suggest getting the chopped salisbury steak or the four cheese pasta with chicken!"
Taly K.,"Campbell, CA",0,8,,4.0,6/3/2016,"Have recently become a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but mainly because of one thing! I am obsessed with their spinach dip, although I wish it had a little something more(maybe salt), its still very good.  Tried their Jambalaya, was OK. 3/5 My boyfriend got the Chicken Bellagio, and it was amazing! Definitely will be ordering this dish when coming back. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the basil pasta topped it off very nicely.  Got the Banana Cream cheesecake to end our meal, and were very satisfied! Loved it."
Emmylou R.,"Temecula, CA",63,67,170,4.0,2/3/2016,"This place always my favorite love there skinnylicious menu very light pastas just right amount of serving for the ones that are on a diet. I never find their food too salty it always taste perfect. Calamari always the best in town reasonably priced. Ambiance always perfect! Australian bartender love the accent, he's pretty good too always remembers me since I always eat at the bar. Cocktails always yummy but I miss my Moscow mule in a copper cup they use a glass but it taste light just the way I like it. Oh cheescake always so divine! Yum!"
Reema K.,"San Jose, CA",49,49,6,5.0,1/10/2016,"This post is specifically for one of the servers at this location. I went in today with my family, including my 5 year old niece. The wait was fairly long, and my niece was starting to get hungry. Rachelle (I hope I am spelling her name correctly, it's a mixture of Michelle and Rachel. She was working today, by the bar area, around the time of 9:00-10:30, for sure) She was the absolute sweetest of hearts. She brought my niece a plate of bread and cut bananas to hold her down, as we were waiting to be seated. I tried to get a hold of the manager to extend my gratitude, but being that it was Saturday night, it was fairly busy.  Rachelle( Again, I hope I'm spelling that correctly) we greatly appreciate your excellent service!! It was so heart-warming that you went out of your way to help us, even during a very busy time. Not to mention that you were not our server for the evening, you were just passing by.  Thank you thank you!"
Marilyn W.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,1.0,8/24/2016,"An employee at the Apple Store told us that Cheesecake Factory has a fabulous Happy Hour. My husband and I wanted to try it...could not find any info on their website, so called.  The gal who answered the phone was very nice, but she was not able to give me any details or description of the Happy Hour...other than it starts at 4PM.  I asked if they offered special prices doing Happy Hour and she said yes but she did not know how much..said depends on what you order.  I asked her about drinks and she said ""hold on,""  and then said they are all about $5.00.  So Cheesecake loses our business as there are many other good places in this area.  Do not feel like driving there & finding parking to be disappointed.  I do not blame the employee, but wonder if ought Management is doing enough to train..so as not to lose customers.  We HAVE enjoyed lunch & dinner there, however."
Barbara P.,"San Jose, CA",82,114,80,4.0,10/3/2016,Service and food is always great when we come but last time I came we waiting a while to get greeted and sat by a host I'm sure he was busy which was okay but there was a girl standing behind the host station on her phone saying she's off ! Get your ass from behind there then dummy
Irish P.,"San Jose, CA",110,155,724,5.0,12/1/2014,"I wish I could remember our waitress's name! She was so sweet and ever so consistent even on a busy Saturday.  The wait was pretty long, or maybe we were just really hungry, but once we got seated, everything went by fairly quickly, I'd say, thanks to our waitress. The bread here is delicious and the rest of the food was great, too. I love how our waitress kept coming over and refilling our waters. A+ right there! Fried calamari was pretty gummy, but in a good way. Good portions and it came with the standard red sauce and tartar sauce. I actually can still remember how yummy the nachos were, too. We got sour cream and guacamole on the side of course, since Tyler hates that stuff, but all around, the pico de gallo, cheese, jalapenos and chicken all were great on the chips. I think the reason why it was so delicious was because the chips tasted fresh. I tried looking for the name of what I ordered, but I couldn't find it. Huge portions though, I was the only one who couldn't finish my food. My boyfriend ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and he devoured it in about 5 minutes, not going to lie.  My sister ordered a sandwich that had chipotle mayo in it. I'm guessing it's the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and her boyfriend ordered some pasta with chicken and red sauce. He finished his pretty fast too, so that's a sign that he enjoyed his dish, too. Sorry for not being too specific. Two appetizers and four plates, the bill came out to a little over $100. I just wish I had room for a cheesecake because the dulce de leche one sounded soooooooooooo good!"
