Lisa T.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,4,1.0,11/11/2017,They are so annoying. Our turn came up and the worker took our call button and asked us to stand on the side. THEN he had a couple other people go ahead of us. And we had to say something then we got seated. And our server wasn't all that friendly. Rather go to BJS.
Conner H.,"San Jose, CA",10,20,12,1.0,11/6/2017,Horrible experience. So we arrive at 5pm and put our name on the list. They quoted us an hour and a half wait time for a party of 13. Sure that's fine it's early by the time we would've gotten our table so we decile we will walk around the mall and shop. An hour goes by and we all gather back and decide to wait out the rest of the half hour. It hits the last half hour mark of the wait time. Still table isn't ready they say they're cleaning it. 15 minutes pass. Still the table isn't ready they're still cleaning it. Another 15 pass and they say they're preparing it. Another 10 minutes pass and they say that they're waiting for the other half of the table to leave. So this whole time you lied about the table being cleaned/ready/prepared?? By now it's been over 2 hours wait time and counting. Everyone is very upset because it's already getting late and everyone is hungry. Not to mention it would take another 15 minutes to order and another 45 or more to prepare all the orders. And of course coming with so many orders they leave out some plates and they get cold or under cooked etc (has happened plenty of times before) and of course the manager was no help at all. Will not be returning to this location. You're better off at BJs or Olive Garden. CF quote you a time. But they don't live up to it unless it's small parties. I am sure they gave our tables away and thought they could squeeze as many customers in between the wait time as possible. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE and a huge waste of time. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all.
Carmen R.,"San Jose, CA",2,39,8,1.0,12/3/2016,"3 stars, huh!!!!!??? Hopefully this review will bring it down to 2.  My sister had this bright idea to have her birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory, and why not their cheesecake is divine. If this review was for the cheesecake I would have given it 5 stars, buuuut unfortunately it's not. It's for customer service. And as everyone knows I'm a big fan of customer service.  We came in with a party of 12 adults and 4 kids. And having 4 kids in the party we knew to have them fed and napped which we did. However, the hostess here had a different plan. After arriving 30 minutes prior to our planned time we were told we'd have to wait about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes. Ok fine. Most of our tables are ready at about the 40 minute mark. However, these two ladies (who were holding up our whole dinner party) just simply couldn't s-t-h-u. After about an hour and a half the hostess decided chatty kathy and chatty nancy weren't going to be leaving any time soon so they sat us down...right next to them. And the two mentioned above were STILL talking. Which is fine and all, but people please be considerate of your surroundings, I know kindness, and manners are a thing of the past, but common courtesy, I thought, was still in circulation.  So we're finally seated, and jabber jaws are still at it.  We meet Nate, our server and he really tries to remedy the situation but, he got me past my hunger point. Hangry is never a good place for me to be. So in all fairness I'll give him a shot. He did his best but it still didn't help the situation.  Chapter 3: so after we're seated they offer us one complimentary appetizer for the 16 of us. Which takes forever to come out. And when it does it's lukewarm. We order our drinks. Which also take a while to come out. I think that was because our sodas and waters were made fresh.  On to the food the only thing worse than the service, believe it or not. My niece and nephew ordered the alfredo pasta who are only 3 and 5 and they didn't even eat it. It was completely flavorless. Mind you I have yet to see these kids turn down a meal. They ate from everyone else's plate so they were fine. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced. Â  This was my second time here in about 5 years and it's definitely my last. Unless of course I wanted the chocolate Godiva cheesecake. Then maybe I'll return...MAYBE!"
Mike A.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,1,2.0,4/16/2017,"Worst experience ever! I have been coming to this location for years and today may be my last.  I ordered French toast. After waiting 30 minutes my family got their food and at that time I was told that they ran out of french toast. The manager, Lindsey, told me to order whatever I wanted and she would get it to me quickly. I asked for a waffle.  I waited another 30 minutes. My family finished eating. I asked what was taking so long. Lindsey said the waffle iron was no working right. She never came back to inform me of that. I had to look for her to ask why it was taking so long. She did.not have the common courtesy to tell me. I was frustrated and ended up not ordering any food for myself.  I understand that restaurants get busy. I am disappointed with how this manager responded to it. Little concern for the customer experience!"
Sweeny Y.,"San Jose, CA",81,82,53,3.0,5/28/2016,"Usually when I dine at the cheesecake factory in Oakridge I have a good experience. Last night, my mother and I went there to celebrate a work promotion (yay me! But anyways...). We decided to share Avocado egg rolls and an Alfredo pasta. I also ordered a tequila sunrise, in which the waiter asked ME what was in it (wtf write it down and ask your bartender).  First of all, it took days for our food to come out. We waited 30 minutes and our appetizer still wasn't out. He finally brought it out, but we kinda expected our pasta to be out at the same time since it took so damn long (this was when the tequila was wearing off, so I was getting very annoyed lol).  Finally, our pasta came out and it was so MEH. It just tasted like a wet noodle. No salt, no seasoning, nada. I told our waitor after 2 bites that this is not an Alfredo and he quickly apologized and gave us a choice of another pasta. It tasted wayyyy better than what we originally ordered. I'm giving them a 3 star because they handled the situation pretty well. The manager came out (I think his name was Dave or David?) And he said since it would take another 15 minutes for the pasta to be ready, he offered us a complimentary soup or salad which totally helped us keep our hungar down. Our waiter apologized several times and I think genuinely felt bad.  I've had better experiences at the cheesecake in Oakridge."
Lisa N.,"San Jose, CA",105,92,274,3.0,12/17/2016,"Waiting is never easy, especially when you are hungry. We went here on a Friday night (I know, what a dumb idea) but it's b/c we didn't want to drive far. The wait here is always crazyyyy. We decided to sit outside because the wait was much shorter. Also, it's much more chill (literally) outside versus sitting in a noisy & dim lighted inside setting. Sitting outside is not so bad b/c they have those warm fire lights thing so it keep us warm. The menu is extensive & is on the pricier side. The food was ok, nothing to rave about. I ordered the mac & cheese burger. It was meh, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It didn't ""wow"" me. My 3 friends ordered: 4 cheese pasta, spicy chicken chipotle pasta, & lemon-herb roasted chicken. Halfway through eating, the waiter brought out another dish & said they gave her the wrong chicken dish.... UHH, luckily she didn't have any allergies or that'd be all bad. Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken is not the same as Chicken Madeira btw. Our waitress was super friendly tho. Sadly, I didn't catch her name."
Maleah M.,"San Jose, CA",966,605,4671,2.0,7/31/2015,"Came here for happy hour and granted, yes there are many other ppl here for HH, but even considering that, the service was still incrediblyyyyyyy slow. Couldn't hunt down our waiter for the check and when we finally did, there was no one to take it. After a grueling time waiting, we decided to rummage up whatever cash we had in the bottom of our bags so we could just leave it on the table and get out of there. Other than the poor service, I always love myself some avocado egg rolls and $5.50 during HH is definitely worth the crispy avocado goodness. The bread we were given was extremely cold and that was disappointing because one of the best things about restaurants is looking forward to that basket of warm bread. We also ordered the crab and artichoke dip and it seemed good at first then we realized they faced all the burnt sides of the bread down. Better luck for us next time I guess."
Roxanne O.,"San Jose, CA",2,18,14,3.0,2/22/2017,"A martini without olives???? Common Cheesecake! Also, I asked for olives and our waiter just brought me two. Without a pick or anything..."
James V.,"San Jose, CA",79,133,730,3.0,6/14/2016,Came for a light lunch. Got drinks and apps. Factory nachos are the way to go! It was enough for 2 and it was delicious!
Rose C.,"Milpitas, CA",227,364,197,2.0,4/20/2017,"How many years has Cheesecake Factory been in business? Many. How many cheesecakes have they made? Probably around a million. How many times have I been to cheesecake factory? More than a dozen. So imagine my disappointment when I spent 17.37 cents on two slices of cheesecake and realize (when I get home) that one slice is totally normal sized and delicious looking, and the other slice (the banana) was thin and small. I didn't bother checking the bag when the woman, who was very nice by the way, handed it to me. I just put it in my car and went home. I was so excited to eat it but it ended up being like less than half the size of the red velvet. What the heck man?? They usually cut all the slices so evenly and they are a pretty OK portion for around 8 dollars each. I am so sad that I wasted my money on such a tiny slice of cheesecake. My BF finished it in less than three bites, I kid you not. Next time I will look in the bag first!! I work really hard for my money and want to splurge on some cake--I deserve at least a whole slice, don't you think?"
Mohamed M.,"Gilroy, CA",0,9,5,1.0,8/11/2017,The service is very bad the food is really bad we order a food for our kid they forget to bring it and it is 11 PM and my wife feel very food poisoning. We will never go back
Trisha C.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/26/2017,Food is really good but service is horrible. The kitchen is so slow and staff is always hanging around not caring. This has happened here at Valley Fair San Jose Â and at the one in Vegas. Going to have to quit coming here.
John C.,"San Jose, CA",260,23,,5.0,3/26/2017,Laura was our server this afternoon and she was nothing less than exceptional. She was SPECTACULAR! Some of the best customer service I have had in serving in several months! Her efficiency and awesome recall of requests is brilliant-- this sort of talent would be a great asset to any company- especially a managerial position!  REQUEST for Laura if you are on date night or a special occasion!
Camille T.,"San Jose, CA",1,18,18,5.0,4/29/2016,"My first time having dinner at Cheesecake! Im not a cheesecake lover but, I loved the food here! It was worth the wait! Also the ambiance was nice & captivating! My siblings & I decided to have our late dinner here since most of the restaurants are closed by 10PM etc. i gotta admit my first time experience at cheesecake was VERY GOOD! Our server made sure that we have what we needed like the complimentary bread & our drinks etc! The food took about 25mins to come out but, we didnt mind since we were having great conversations! I ordered shrimp & chicken gumbo! It was delicious! It was a bit spicy but, LOVED IT! We all left happy & satisfied with everything.  ALSO, I'm thankful that they were able to give my phone back! I left it on the table because I had my daughter in my arms so it slipped through my mind that I had left it there! Oh well atleast they were nice enough to keep it safely & waited for the owner to come & pick it up!"
Bekki Jasmin Z.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",299,5,,5.0,2/11/2017,"Our waiter Eddie, was amazing!! He was able to cater to our requests and he went above and beyond. He was able to bring our food out pretty quickly and checked in with us frequent enough; to where it wasn't annoying nor scarce enough to wonder where our waiter was. Amazing waiter!! Thanks so much Eddie!!!  PS: he can speak Enlgish and Spanish upon request!  Love it!!!"
John K.,"San Jose, CA",0,25,1,1.0,11/28/2016,"@ 35k employees, a global footprint, and $1B USD in annual revenue, I'm certainly not going to change the way CF does business.... Â  Â what I find interesting are comments like this: ""We usually do not take reservations for dining during busy times..."" If Mr. Overton and his direct reports said that phrase a couple dozen times in their next staff meeting, and stopped to think about it for 2 seconds, would it ever appear as asinine to them as it does to end-customers ?"
Edithh A.,"San Jose, CA",2,3,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"So I don't know if they give smaller portions when you order to go but, I ordered through doordash . & either the dasher ate half of my good & my dessert or they just didn't pack the cake & ripped me off . I didn't pay $17/18 for a pasta that can only feed me . I eat very little . I always share & it's enough but yesterday it wasn't . I will for sure never order to go again . I don't plan on returning either ."
Timothy N.,"San Jose, CA",108,63,48,3.0,9/22/2016,"Eee. I can't say much except that their food constantly comes out extremely too cheesy and/or too bland. For the meals with cheese, it is simply overwhelming and each bite feels heavy. As for other meals they often taste really bland or dry. Of course though my friends often note good food so maybe I'm ordering the wrong things."
Sam R.,"Blossom Valley, San Jose, CA",80,8,,2.0,11/10/2016,"Service: excellent fast and friendly Food: for the price I was thinking something good. For what I got i wanted to Â shoot my mouth so I could get Â some flavor, because it didn't had none. 2nd time here no more"
Kaylee S.,"San Jose, CA",1,58,6,3.0,7/16/2017,Went in on a Saturday night with 4 other girls. Told the wait was 40 minutes but ended up being over a hour which is fine but a little annoying when your super hungry. The service was good and the food tasted great but my only complaint was the food I got to go for my boyfriend at home. He wanted a pit sandwich with French fries... I got Â home to open the bag to only see the sandwich with no french fries. My fault for not checking the bag before leaving but I do think the staff should be checking as well.
