Pat H.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",11,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I have been ordering Cobb Salads at the CF for over 20 years, starting at the one in Beverly Hills. They are amazing, and always consistent.....the same every time. The wait for food at the CF on Blossom Hill in San Jose was an eternity, even though the restaurant was the emptiest I have ever seen it (maybe THAT was the red flag I missed). The concoction that was presented as a Cobb Salad, while technically a Cobb Salad, did not remotely resemble what they usually present. The Cobb from CF is always pre tossed, with all the ingredients mixed in, a ring of riced egg around the edge, lots of succulent chicken, and thick crispy bacon throughout. The one yesterday had the ingredients sectioned on the top, bacon bits, very little dressing drizzled on the top (it was very dry, and I had to ask for more). The salad wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was not their usual, and was the same as ordering a hamburger and getting a hot dog. I would never have ordered this if i had only known what I was getting.  The bottom line is that after all of these years, I don't know if I can ever go back. Consistency is key in a restaurant, and I never want this to happen again............and the only way I can think to avoid it is to avoid the Cheescake Factory."
Devon M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",112,4,,1.0,7/26/2017,"What can I say? Normally I love this place. The food tastes great and the service has been impeccable the times I have eaten at this location. Unfortunately, every time I have eaten at this location or had ordered to go, I have gotten violently sick. I wanted to give it another shot but spent last night throwing up and had to leave my job today because of it. The people who I came  with got sick as well. It makes me wonder, and worry, about the cleanliness of the kitchen and the staff that works there. I have never gotten sick from the food at any other location I've eaten at, and I've eaten at several all over the country. I can say that I will not be returning to this cheesecake factory ever again."
Scott B.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/22/2017,"This is the third time I have eaten at this restaurant and the last time I will eat at this restaurant. Tonight I decided to try their Old Fashioned Hamburger for a second time to see if they could do any better than the last time I ate at this location.  They didn't.   On the previous visit, the hamburger was ordered with no pickles, no onions and no mayo and medium well done.  The hamburger arrived with everything on it and the inside was basically raw! They sent it back two times and still couldn't get it right.  At least that time they didn't charge me for the meal.  Fast forward to this attempt: I ordered it the same way except at the waitresses recommendation I ordered it well done.  Again it came with everything on it: I sent it back and all they did was remove the mayo, the pickles and onions and sent it back out.  The burger had a overwhelming taste of pickles and was cooked as though it had been at ground zero in a nuclear bomb test!  I thought of sending it back a second time, but having waited for the burger to arrive for over 45 minutes I decided to just take it home and feed it to my dog!  He seemed to enjoy it!   My son ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and found his meal to be lacking any real flavor or Parmesan cheese, he also said this is the last time he will eat there too!  Perhaps this restaurant should employ some cooks who actually read english( I was told most don't speak english or read english) so it's no wonder they can't get the order right."
Najwa K.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/18/2017,"We regularly eat at cheesecake factory,  food is always really good!!! Their tiramisu cake is so yummyyyy"
Jenn M.,"Evergreen, San Jose, CA",16,31,8,1.0,4/2/2017,Our server was great but she didn't check in on us to make sure if we needed anything; we would have to try to get someone's else's attention. My parents food arrived WAY before mine; their food was cold and dads food wasn't cooked the way he wanted. The bathroom was absolutely filthy and I get they were busy but that's no excuse to leave the bathroom completely unclean and unstocked. I will NEVER go back to this Cheesecake location again.
Carmen A.,"San Jose, CA",62,77,101,2.0,2/28/2016,"I live down the street so I come here pretty often. Usually it meets or exceeds my expectations. Tonight my experience has fallen short to say the least. Wait time wasn't bad & I did have some good appetizers. However, the time it took to get basic needs met (water, bread, meals, etc;) was BEYOND slow. I understand it's busy but it's never been THIS slow. Ordered the Chipotle pasta & it was WAY too salty. Had to send it back. Ordered cheesecake (classic strawberry) 20 min ago & we're still waiting. Manager came over to talk to us prior to ordering dessert & apologized for the meal/ service, but the service lag didn't seem to improve. I love Cheesecake Factory, but after tonight I'll def have to give it a second thought before coming here. I might consider BJ's instead. Update: About 5 min after posting, they brought a cheesecake out. A say ""a cheesecake"" because it was NOT what we ordered. *sigh* Whyyyy you gotta do me like that , Cheesecake Factory?? I used to love you :("
Tracy M.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/25/2017,Slow service I was there for almost 3hrs and then it got to the point where we had to leave because we were to hungry
Maryana S.,"San Jose, CA",81,31,28,1.0,10/31/2016,"I came here with my husband and our out of town guests for an early dinner on Sunday Oct 30. It was our guests first time, and this is our favorite spot so we were excited to treat them. We were seated in the bar area and at first our service was great. Our server took our drink order and we placed an order for buffalo blasts and avocado egg rolls to start. That's when everything fell apart... Our avocado egg rolls came out on time, but our waiter came back and said ""the Buffalo blasts needed some more tlc so they're gonna be a few more minutes"". 15 minutes later we are done with our avocado egg rolls, we placed our entree order, and managed to get several refills and still no blasts. Our waiter has been avoiding our table ever since. After several attempts to try and get his attention I finally caught him by the kitchen and asked again about the blasts. He says ""I'll check on them, it'll be just a few more minutes"".  At this point I asked for a manager. It took 20 minutes for Hana to come over, only to offer us some sorry explanation, and ultimately I managed to get her to admit that the Buffalo blasts were never prepped.  We finally received our blasts and entrees. Our server was still running around the bar area, socializing with all his tables, it'd be nice to have him check on us. Towards the end we decided we wanted dessert, there was no desert presentation. He assumed he wanted our cheesecake to go until we told him it was for here.  Oh and by the time the food came out my 5 year old nephew fell asleep.  Terrible service, terrible server. Steven's Creek location is way better ."
Yescenia M.,"Riverbank, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/5/2017,"At 8:47 pm I ordered two slices of oreo dream extreme cheesecake at the dessert counter.  By 9 pm I asked about my order and was told they were working on them.  We continued to wait next to the dessert counter.  I became frustrated when other customers came up to the counter, ordered, and received their dessert before me.  I asked a waiter to please check on my ordered and when he came back he said they were being boxed to go.  By 9:15 pm I went up to the counter again to ask about my order and the lady looked at my receipt and looked around confused.  She handed my receipt back and said she would be right back.  I finally received a bag with my dessert at this point it is 9:21.  This is unacceptable.  I am very disappointed in the wait time and even more with the customer service.  I was very upset at the situation and did not feel comfortable enough to ask for a manager."
Karen A.,"San Jose, CA",6,6,,2.0,9/27/2016,"Curbside pickup--a joke... I ordered curbside service a half hour before I actually picked up the order. When I arrived in the parking lot I called the phone number for the restaurant, and it took seven minutes for someone to pick up the phone. I was so frustrated, that by the time I heard someone pick up, I was already at the front door.  I had to pick my order up at the bakery. I asked for management, and he gave a bunch of excuses.  There were five staff members in the bakery, and there was no one waiting to be seated. So, from my point of view, there should have been someone to answer my phone call and deliver the food to me (which is what the service is for). All management had to offer were excuses and nothing more."
Marko Z.,"San Jose, CA",3,35,5,4.0,5/25/2017,"Routine to come here with my gf and love it . Never had anything less than a great experience . I wish they would take reservations . Pasta dishes need a bit of work, but otherwise everything else is 5 star!"
Terri M.,"Gilroy, CA",33,314,1125,3.0,10/16/2016,"This place is around the middle south end of the Oakridge Mall. They do have a lot of choices for both food and cheesecake flavors. The cheesecake isn't the best, it is kind of salty but yet wayyyy too sweet. It is very hard to get a good NY cheesecake. If you go in just for a slice of cheesecake to go, plan on waiting about 30 minutes. Some people love their food but it is pretty salty/high in sodium. Cost for 2 slices of cheesecake was about $18."
Ashley W.,"San Jose, CA",304,146,779,3.0,9/25/2016,"Every time we go to Cheesecake Factory it is just to kill some time.  When I look at the menu I never know where to start.  Way too many things to pick from.  It's very confusing.  Apps over here but more apps over there, lunch in the middle but brunch in the back, light food here but the same thing just more over here, and best off all only one page of specialty cocktails.  Come on you have all these different pages for food and a page for specialty drinks.  We usually keep it simple with an app and a drink.  I would rather spend my money somewhere else."
Ivan P.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/4/2017,"The service here is TERRIBLE. Host here are just on their phones, taking and not paying attention to what they're doing. We were told the wait for two was 5-10 mins and ended up being 30. They sat a few families ahead of us that arrived AFTER we did. Their buzzers didn't even work for us which is why they skipped us."
Stephen C.,"Campbell, CA",343,264,1063,5.0,1/21/2015,There are many Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area. However this cheesecake has set the bar for cheesecake in the Bay Area. We had a cool Asian waiter.  Pros: spicy chipotle chicken pasta(with linguine) was prepared nicely. The bread was fresh. The water was cold. AND the customer service was on point.  Cons: dark lighting and horrible for pictures haha. Turn your flash on.  Overall: cool cheesecake spot. Will return to this one over the one at valley fair!
Mary W.,"Clermont, FL",75,1,,2.0,8/30/2016,I can see why this location is only 3 stars.  The service is slow and unfriendly.  The order was incorrect and just was a disappointing experience.  It is not often that I would not tip a server but in this case there was nothing she did to earn it. I think she spoke 5 words to us the entire time. Our dishes were not cleared and our drinks say empty.  Won't be back  Food was excellent
Randy M.,"Salinas, CA",0,6,1,1.0,1/30/2017,"We've been here many times and it is usually a Friday night and super packed, and the food has always been great, as well as the service. Tonight is a Monday night, we were seated right away around 5:30, the place was not busy, it wasn't even half full, we didn't get our appetizer at all, and our food was room temp and part of it was flat out cold. The bread they bring out wasn't cut, and the manager seamed as if none of it was really a big deal. He had it ""fixed"" and had our plates back out 10 minutes later with half of the same food. They did nothing about the  $50 bill for 2, but wanted to comp us A slice of cheesecake...it was literally a sliver! Will be a long time before we go back! Especially since we live over an hour away!"
Brandy R.,"Mountain View, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/15/2017,Came to cheesecake with the family took and grand half to get or food horrible not even that busy. Kids where really hungry one even ended up falling asleep waiting for the stupid food. And then when the food comes 3 plates of food cold like come on guys get it together seriously. Gave one star can't give no star.
Elena N.,"San Francisco, CA",1406,2423,10560,3.0,12/14/2014,"I used to live in the suburbs, so I've gone to my fair share of chain restaurants. But living the last 8 years in SF has spoiled me. The last place I normally want to go is a chain restaurant. That being said,  Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains. They have a huge menu, so you can basically order whatever your heart desires. Plus, there's the cheesecake! *Mumm napa, brut prestige, napa valley, sparkling wine ($13 split) *Mini crabcakes ($13.50): served with mustard and tartar sauce *Avocado eggrolls ($10.95): avocado, tomato, red onion & cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper, with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce *Cajun jambalaya ($17.95): shrimp & chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce, over rice *Spicy chipotle chicken sandwich ($11.95): crispy coated chicken breast w/melted cheese & spicy buffalo on a brioche bun w/fries *Shrimp scampi & steak diane ($19.95): shrimp w/garlic, wine, basil, tomato; steak w/peppercorns, mushroom wine sauce; Salad *Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake: layers of rich brownie, kahlua cheesecake, creamy chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache *Peppermint bark cheesecake: white chocolate cheesecake w/chocolate peppermint bark, white chocolate mousse & chopped peppermint I went with the roommate's siblings, so there were 5 of us. Since he's been here so many times, he tends to order the same thing every time: avocado egg rolls, jambalaya and kahlua coffee cheesecake. All were good choices and he seemed to enjoy them. I however, can get overwhelmed by the huge menu and have no idea what to order. I ended up getting the mini crabcakes and the combination plate of shrimp scampi and steak diane. The crab cakes were good. The cakes could have been a little crisper from the sear since they were a little mushy. But it had a good amount of crab. The steak and shrimp were okay. The steak is served in three individual pieces, so if you like your meat rare, it will be over cooked. The shrimp were a good size and came in three as well. The sauce was a little too lemony for my tastes though. I did like the mixed green salad with their balsamic though. For me, the main reason to come here is the cheesecake. I ended up getting the peppermint cheesecake since it was seasonal and I do love peppermint! It was wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be which was good. And I loved the addition of the candy cane pieces on the whipped cream. I didn't care too much for the crust since it was too dense, but overall I enjoyed the slice. One of the drawbacks to Cheesecake Factory is they don't take reservations, so there's normally always a wait. I think we waited about 20-30 mins last Sunday around lunchtime. Not too bad compared to other locations I've been to. For a dining option at Oakridge, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the better ones."
