Diana T.,"San Jose, CA",221,400,872,5.0,3/28/2015,"I like Cheesecake Factory for a variety of reasons. To start, this particular location doesn't get extremely packed except on the weekends but still the wait is a bit shorter then at Valley Fair Mall. It's located inside Oakridge Mall so there's always shopping during the wait. The house bread is sourdough or brown and always comes out warm. The menu offers a skinnylicious option which seems healthier the. Most of the options they have. The chicken pasta from the skinnylicious menu was made of the noodle pasta that seemed kind of card board like and dry but it was ok. The skinnylicious salads are very good I like the Mexican one as it has a crispy taste with the tortilla chips and a good mixture of greens and corn too. The miso salmon is always a good choice especially for lunch.  Of course, the cheesecakes are the best here and there are so many to choose from too."
Alazaya K.,"San Jose, CA",30,42,7,4.0,10/9/2016,"It's been so long since I've been to cheesecake so I decided to revisit it. To be honest, I last came here two years ago and the food was just ok for the pricing of the place. Yesterday I came around 7pm and waited for 25 min which wasn't too bad because it was super duper busy. My boyfriend and I were seated outside and our server was named Roger! He was great at helping me choose between items I wasn't sure on and was also content on checking up on us, making sure we enjoyed everything okay. I ordered the chicken Madira, 3/5 it was good, the dish came with asparagus, sautéd mushroom, mashed red potatoes and also chicken with mozzarella cheese on top. Now for the chicken, they were moist... THOUGH they are very very thin pieces of chicken lol. It's like a chicken breast but they slice it horizontally into 4 long pieces and cut it up into half and only serve 2 pieces of chicken on the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Cajun pasta, he says it's a 4/5 it was a big portion and had a good spice to it. I even noticed the chicken in his dish was bigger than mine ;( Anyways, we also got the strawberry slushee, 5/5 served in a really big cup! Enough to satisfy two people. It wasn't too sweet, tasted real fruit bits which was gooood. It also came with a big strawberry and orange slice as well :) Aaaand last is the stuffed mushrooms. Came with 6 big mushrooms in a cream sauce and cheese. Really good! 5/5. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 which wasn't bad at all!  Overall, this place is has good food. No complains ( aside the thin pieces of chicken ) it's very nice and elegant on the inside, they have a nice big bar which seems to be just as busy as the restaurant itself. They have a variety of different cheesecakes on display and they all look super delicious!"
Sal G.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/7/2017,Very bad service....but the food was  good.had to wait an extra 20 min after they told us our table was ready.
Debbie T.,"San Jose, CA",22,70,,1.0,11/12/2017,Usually I don't bother to write bad reviews because everyone has an off day once in a while but last night (sat 11/11 around 8pm) I went in to order 4 cheesecakes Togo. I expected a wait because they were busy. 15 min later I see the cheesecakes I ordered placed on the counter on plates. I figured they mistakenly made it for dine in instead of takeout. Everyone was busy so my boyfriend took the receipt to a bigger guy wearing glasses at the end of the counter. Without even checking he said no and waved us away. So back to waiting we went even though I was pretty sure another person did not order 3 white chocolate raspberry and one fresh strawberry.. a few minutes later we asked one of the cashiers and she went to check all the receipt and went to check the ones at the counter and turns out those were ours and plated by mistake. The guy that said no to us saw her taking the plates back and turned and walked away.. not even acknowledging he was wrong. He needs additional customer service training. It takes a certain level of lazy to not even take 2 steps to his left to check for us. 5 stars for everyone else who was working hard while that guy just stood there
Daisy H.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/6/2017,Horrible experience. I decided to celebrate my birthday at this place...huge mistake. The service was horrible. Never going to that place.
Anna A.,"San Jose, CA",13,58,,1.0,2/16/2017,This review is not for the food but for the extremely dim lighting inside the restaurant. It's like dining in a Hollister Co. My husband and I had to use our cell phones to shine light on the menu so we could read it. We looked around and noticed a few other diners doing the same thing. It is ridiculous how dark it is in there.
Tara S.,"Lakewood, WA",187,334,106,3.0,11/12/2015,"Usually when I come here, I just get the Avocado Egg Rolls.  They're ALWAYS delicious.  The last time, I got some sort of Shiela's chicken and cashew salad and my daughter got the mushroom burger.  Holy meh, Batman.  My salad was ""ok""...I've had better ones from Safeway and Trader Joe's, and those only cost like $4.  This salad was definitely NOT worth the $12 this place charges.  My daughter's burger was pretty disappointing even though it looked RAD.  After a bunch of salt, it was pretty good though.  Also...the gluten free bun is legit!   A ""lunch"" salad, burger, and one lemonade came to $32.  Holy sh!t.  So not worth it.  They get to keep a star for those Avocado Egg Rolls and their cheesecake, but overall...2 stars."
Peter D.,"San Jose, CA",3,16,,2.0,4/12/2017,You guys better clean that greasy floor!!
Nikisha S.,"San Jose, CA",19,58,39,5.0,11/29/2015,"Louisiana chicken pasta and the Miso Salmon are the top favorites!!  Love the wheat bread for us to much on until the main dish comes and the green tea to sip on! Service with any servers are always friendly and just good people to be around. Our most recent server told us that everything is made fresh to order and a microwave is no where to be found. The food surely shows for that, it's always consistent every visit. Perfect place for casual or special occasion lunch or dinner. Haven't been here for breakfast, but I'm sure it's the same great service and food!"
Kelly S.,"San Jose, CA",33,13,1,1.0,5/24/2017,"So this was the worst experience ever. My pasta tasted like glue. I called and reordered a old timer, MR, with cheese, it came out burnt. So the young lady who helped me with, curbside, rolled her eyes and was literally annoyed with me when I asked for something that I shouldn't have had to ask for anyway. To wrap this up the manager really didn't care how bad my experience was, he never gave me eye contact or actually cared that you dinning experience was so bad. The icing on the cake, or should I say cheese cake, he made me pay for the red velvet cake instead of comping it, wow way to go cheese cake, 0 in my book today. Just for the record, I tipped the young lady, Cecilia, $12 on food I never got to eat!!"
Niloc C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,75,3,1.0,5/21/2017,"What an awful experience. Other than the server, everything was horrible. We were seated at a DIRTY table on the patio.  We watched them clear the plates but never clean the table and then seated us there....had to ask for it to be cleaned. They brought us our drinks that we ordered. There was so much dirt/food on my supposedly clean glass that I could feel the grittiness. Asked for a new one and the server commented when he returned with a new one, that so many other glasses he picked up were like that, so he WASHED A GLASS FOR ME HIMSELF!!!  Said he would talk to the dishwasher. Would it surprise you if I said our silverware was the same?  Along with appetizer plates. At that point we paid and left. How disgusting!?  I used to love Cheesecake Factory. I'll never go back to this one again, for sure. And I think it may have turned me off from them completely."
Misha S.,"San Jose, CA",34,106,9,2.0,7/9/2017,"Two stars because they are usually good. Today not so much. Burnt Nachos. I told the waitress. She was ""like ya those are burnt. Probably shouldn't have brought them out! Did not have time to wait for another order then have to eat alone. Still charged me for the burnt nachos."
Alyssa B.,"Alviso, CA",506,469,880,4.0,11/28/2015,"I had only recently discovered this location (and the overall mall-plaza-place) due to a missed turn that led us on a Blossom Hill adventure. Let's just say I've never really ventured to this part of town before. It was a surprising discovery. One Cheesecake Factory is pretty much just like any other Cheesecake Factory, but this one has a better parking situation from what I can tell. And a nice patio area. And they have a Forever 21 right next door, so I can go shopping (or looking, at least) with buzzer in hand. Service is good and food is consistent with other locations (tasty!). I'm still stuck on my usual -- the four cheese pasta -- but my boyfriend's Louisana Chicken Pasta was amazing! I'd be more than willing to return to this location."
Daniel G.,"San Jose, CA",10,4,,1.0,4/14/2017,"This review is for those who plan on bringing a large party of 5+. Called in hours earlier to let them know I had a party of 5+ and they told me reservations could not be made but they would accommodate once we arrived. Showed up at 7:00pm and was told my party would be seated around 8:00 pm. 2 hours later I had a frustrated manager telling me there was nothing he could do but he would give me a free cheese cake (slice) for my trouble. Simply put, I recommend you go elsewhere. Management cannot handle large parties during busy schedules."
Rosa E.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/11/2017,If I could give them zero stars I would. WORST Cheesecake Factory. They told us a time of 50 mins then we check in 30 mins later they say we're waiting for them to get up so we can clean the table so we wait other 20 mins and then say oh it's an hour wait. These were two different person. Who's correct then. If someone doesn't know how the tables work they shouldn't even give Info. This was the second time they do this. There time management isn't the best.
Rey P.,"Columbus, OH",58,5,3,1.0,4/22/2017,"Takes forever!!! Their takeout takes longer than if you sit at a table and order food, eat it, and pay. Been over an hour since we ordered, we were told 25 minutes. Now we have cold food! Terrible"
Munazzar T.,"San Jose, CA",128,63,9,5.0,1/24/2017,"Good ambiance, fresh food and very good for kids. I went with my 5 year old and we totally loved it! Definitely would recommend this location, and park valet!"
Zuleyha S.,"San Jose, CA",42,13,17,5.0,7/3/2016,Delicious food and good service. Crab cakes was awesome. Our waitress was really polite and nice.
Michelle T.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,9,2.0,3/20/2017,The service here is horrible... waited 20 mins to get our appetizer waited another 30 mins for the rude ass waiter to clean the table before even asking what we wanted to order ... waited so long didn't even want to eat any more ... one drink and appetizer 30 bucks not worth it
Gesi H.,"San Jose, CA",59,2,1,1.0,12/11/2016,"I've always had an OK experience here but tonight I decided to take my boyfriend here for dinner. We were told to wait 30-35 minutes but waited over an hour. Then when we were seated we were basically tossed into the tiniest corner at the smallest table up against a wall. Who wants two eat with their elbow constantly bumping this wall? Not only that there were about 4 empty decent tables next to us. When we asked if we could sit there instead, they denied and said we could either sit here or wait some more. I looked around and saw one woman sitting in a booth enjoying her dinner by herself. But two people had to share this tiny table? We felt the wait and the over priced food just wasn't worth it. We ended up leaving. Don't think I'd come back anymore."
