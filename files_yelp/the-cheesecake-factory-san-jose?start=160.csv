Kia F.,"San Jose, CA",3,125,12,5.0,2/25/2017,"Tonight (1030pm Feb24) my friend and I were served by a certain Prince among men, Patrick. Attentive, cheerful, quick witted and just delightful. He anticipated our needs smoothly without rushing us. He is the kind of person who can make a place really shine. The food is always good---so are the drinks, so kudos to the kitchen and bar, TCF is always clean so no complaints there either. Big ups to our server Patrick, if our night was a triple fudge sundae, he was the cherry on top."
Coraima L.,"Palo Alto, CA",134,15,,1.0,3/20/2017,My Fettuccini Alfredo tasted like water not to mention the chicken had no seasoning. Never going back.
Leo G.,"Marina, CA",43,26,1,5.0,3/18/2017,"First time going there and the food was great. Kind of pricy but it was a nice experience, especially sitting outside. They do get very busy so the wait time was a drag but worth the wait."
M N.,"Stockton, CA",0,30,,3.0,7/22/2016,"Came in on a Friday right before the dinner rush so we didn't have to wait long. The check in gal could try to smile. It is her job to be approachable after all. But everyone else after that was fantastic.  Our server was attentive, cheerful, and quick. So why the three stars? Because the food really isn't worth the cost. Two adults, one child, and our bill was well over a hundred dollars before tip. Yikes!  Now, if the meals were amazing, there would be no grimace here. But let's just say my kid wouldn't touch her Mac and Cheese after two bites because she said it didn't taste like MnC. I had a bite. It definitely didn't taste like it. How can you screw up mac and cheese? Stick to keeping a kid's favorite dish original rather than dressing it up with fancy cheeses. It changes the whole dish.  I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. I was only able to finish less than a third of it. While it initially tasted good, I started to feel a little sick from how heavy the food was. Tasted like it was cooked in two bars of butter and a pint of heavy cream.  I wish I could take the service of this place and couple it with the food at their Walnut Creek location. It would definitely be a 5 stars then!"
Karen H.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,7,,4.0,4/18/2017,I go there often and service is always okay not too impressive but this last time I was there for dinner I got a great server Hispanic woman short hair lovely person you guys should always hire people like that. I don't mind paying a little more than a fast food chain put a great server will always make the experience great. The food was good as well for the price and cheesecake was awesome as well.
Rheanna V.,"Fairgrounds, San Jose, CA",14,92,206,5.0,10/26/2015,"So our waiter Kevin is the best !!!. My boyfriend ordered the steak Diane & I ordered the herb crusted salmon. When they brought it to our table I notice there was no mashed potatoes in my dish, he apologized and assured me that the chef is still working on it and asked if  I would like rice instead.  I waited on the mashed potatoes for about couple of minutes and was glad I didn't get the rice, it was the best ! I don't think you can ever go wrong with their mashed potatoes.  As we were getting ready to leave we asked for just wheat bread to go and he asked if we would like a whole loaf instead of a couple of slices because of the mishap earlier. We asked if he was serious and he once again assured us that that's the least he can do. In the end we got the loaf and couldn't be any happier."
Top Reviewer A.,"Beaverton, OR",0,10,,1.0,6/12/2016,"The worst service a brand like Cheesecake can have.  I have never seen such a worst quality of service at any restaurant. It was my mom's birthday. We ordered three items. 2 appetizers and 1 main dish.  1 main dish came first that too after 45 minutes with pasta undercooked. 2 appetizers never showed up. After we asked the server what was going on, he said he does not know.  When I talked with the manager named "" "" he did not even apologized for the service instead said somedays things like this could happen.  Forget about the famous birthday song singing for my mom's bday or free cupcake tradition. That never happened.  I would not recommend this for anyone and specially if you are going there for birthday or a special day.  The Birthday was completely ruined.   dont go here. Go to other better restaurants like Bucca Di Beppo or olive garden or california pizza kitchen which next to this."
Kharren C.,"Fremont, CA",175,22,21,2.0,5/8/2016,"Normally I love Cheesecake Factory, unfortunately I was not too fond of this particular location. We came in around 9 PM on a Sunday. We didn't wait at all to be seated, but we had to wait quite a while for our server. We time it, we waited over 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our table of 3 and ask for our drink orders. We also had to ask for our bread and for a server to take our order. I'm not sure if there was miscommunication somewhere and maybe our server did not know we were there, but come on. I ordered a steak and it ended up being really salty. My colleague ordered salmon and it was really dry. My other colleague ordered a chicken dish which turned out to be mediocre at best. Usually we love ordering cheesecake at the end of our meal, how are you going to go to Cheesecake Factory and not order a cheesecake!? Unfortunately we did not order cheesecake and that was definitely a first for us.  It's a good thing we were only in the area a few days for business because it would be a shame if I had to go to this location regularly."
Betty P.,"San Jose, CA",21,15,29,4.0,2/17/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite to go places for Happy Hour. (despite it being for only 4-6 Mon-Fri I think it's worth it). I never had a problem with getting a seat. A lot of their appetizers that usually cost $12 and over, you can get for only about $5-6. Their Long Islands and Mojitos are really yummy.(For about $5 dollars each also) I am in love with their Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Rolls, Spring Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms. I don't really get the hype about the Fried Macaronis.  Now if I wanted a plate, I would get the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which is seafood drenched in cream sauce with a hint of lemon (that I really enjoy). Oh did I mention the bread basket? It's soft, addicting and is somewhat on the sweet side. We always have to control ourselves from asking the waiter for more and not get stuffed before our food arrives. The Pineapple Mojito on their regular menu is also a must try.  My only complaint is that one of the waiters in this particular CF is a little preoccupied and out of himself. He would forget orders occasionally, wouldn't check on us unless he was serving food or our bill came and there was this one time where we stated that we preferred the brown bread over the white bread, and he instantly just grabbed the white bread from the basket with his hands. I guess he realized what he was doing and just took the whole basket with him."
Peter K.,"San Jose, CA",90,7,5,5.0,6/16/2016,Great place but they need a bigger menu.  ;-) Avocado Egg Rolls are amazing.  Best burgers in town.   Drinks are over priced but overall CF rocks.
Joannie V.,"San Jose, CA",255,20,,4.0,5/20/2016,"I'm always down for cheesecake factory :) Every time I go, I order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  It never fails me whenever I do. The portions are huge, so i like to share it with my friends. The cheesecakes are super good also."
Ji V.,"Milpitas, CA",38,39,31,1.0,4/8/2017,"Waited for 45mins for our food to be served! Excluding the long time we waited for us to be seated, since we know that the place is always full of people.  Our baby got cranky already by the time we are about to eat.  Other food we ordered were good, but, my fettucini alfredo were all sticking pasta noodle, I did not bother to complain, since it may take ages to have my order again!"
Mandi K.,"Bethlehem, PA",5,36,9,3.0,5/8/2016,"Great happy hour special, but a very short window of time. Great drinks & appetizers but, the bartender Darren is miserable, dismissive, & rude. I don't understand why you would have someone like that represent your establishment."
Michaela C.,"San Jose, CA",25,19,,4.0,3/17/2017,"I really like this restaurant (as well as the other one on Stevens Creek) as the staff is always nice and friendly and food is delicious. I have tried so many things of their menu in the past few years. I can recommend burgers and sea food meals but my favorite is Santa Fe Salad! The reason, however, for 4 stars is that they do not accept advance reservations. The place may get very crowded (especially in the evenings) and the waiting time can take up to almost two hours."
Trang D.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/19/2016,"If you're gonna lie to your customers just so you can get money from a group of 15 ppl thats just shady. They quoted us 1-1.5 hours and after waiting an hr I went to ask how much longer, and it looked evident that they wernt even getting a space ready for 15 ppl, it took 3 heads and 6 eyes to figure it out and later they tell me ""you were quoted 1.5-2 hrs, so you've only waited about an hr"" excuse me?? Only??? U come and take my spot in waiting for that amount of time and then they decide to add another 30 mins to an hr to it. You're lucky my daughter enjoys the FOOD not to mention it's my daughters birthday, great bday experience she had, not!"
Thuy T.,"San Jose, CA",404,55,1375,4.0,7/19/2016,"This review is for their jambalaya pasta. LOVE LOVE LOVE their cajun jambalaya pasta. It is my favorite pasta dish here and I've had it many times already. The entree is simply deee-licious. It has this spicy cajun flavor kick to it and it is basically linguine served with sauteed bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, shrimp and chicken. It is super tasty! If for some reason you don't feel like eating pasta or you just don't like it, you can get this dish served with rice instead. Also, the portion of this dish is HUGE. I highly recommend you sharing the dish with someone, but if you can finish the entire dish on your own... props to you!"
Anjillie W.,"San Jose, CA",258,22,8,5.0,1/23/2017,Go out to dinner with my friends after a long day of work. Get seated right away! Woohoo! Lisa was our server tonight and she's the cutest thing!! She greeted our table with a huge smile & answered ALL of our questions. (There was 5 of us sooo there was a lot of questions!) AND gave great recommendations! Which shows she truly knows the menu! I loved my carbonara! Thank you Lisa for being awesome!! You made my day! You kick butt at your job! Don't ever lose that in this industry!
Esperanza C.,"San Jose, CA",16,28,2,5.0,2/8/2017,"Love the chicken costoletta here and the banana cheesecake, the avocado rolls are also really good. I really enjoy this place also for breakfast on the weekends. I like to celebrate birthdays here. They got great staff"
Becka R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",33,19,9,1.0,5/29/2016,"Waiting time was awesome!!  Five minutes @ 2pm on a Sunday 1st time  coming here and don't think I will be coming back. Will drive to Santa Row location. We were being helped by Mia. Whom only introduced her self brought over our drinks and did not see her again until she brought over the bill.  Food was okay. Husband and I each  asked for the rib eye steak $28pp made sure to specify that they please! cook it  well done. Nope couldn't get that it was medium rare. We know well not to ask the plate be taking back so we ate what was better cooked, the rice and mashed potatoes. There garlic bread was on point."
Adhara R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,29,22,1.0,6/17/2016,"For a big busy chain restaurant, this location does not accomodate waiting guest. Children end up sitting on the floor only to be scolded by employees that its a hazard and that they are blocking the way. Well to me, it would be an easy fix if they installed more benches for waiting parties"
