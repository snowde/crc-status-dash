Michelle A.,"San Jose, CA",10,11,15,2.0,5/31/2016,"Ordered a vanilla bean cheesecake a week before my party. When I called the day before to confirm my order, they said they did not have my order. Luckily, a girl named ""Madeline"" took my order and I was good to go for the next day. However, the following day when I went to pick up the cheesecake, my order was no where to be found. We left with a cheesecake, but we had to endure an internal flaw in their ordering system and a wait time of 25+ minutes. UGH!  2 stars for the service. 5 STARS for an excellent tasting cheesecake."
Ana C.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,23,5.0,5/11/2016,Why i come here I love to get the spicy walnut chicken is one of my favorite meals! It's not at all spicy and the walnuts give it this nice crunchy texture! Mmmmm delicious! I also love there lemonade the cucumber is my favorite refreshing and tasty!
Cassie G.,"Campbell, CA",1,6,1,5.0,4/12/2016,"Came here for the first time tonight, and while admittedly it is a Tuesday night, the service I recieved was just lovely. My date and I came in at around 7:00 or so and asked what the wait would be- there was none. We wanted to wait a bit to get some shopping done and they were very polite about it. When we decided to eat later they just put our name on the list to make our seating  quicker. The hostess was very sweet and cheerful, though I didnt catch her name. She was small and blonde, wearing a white scarf. When we came back later (around 9) she helped us again, recognizing us and leading us directly to a booth. I didn't like the seating too much as we were right by the ""server station"", if you will, but as my date and I are fairly young and underdressed, I can understand if they were simply trying to avoid a dine&ditch.  The bread that was served was very good! We were super hungry so it was gone in minutes- bad idea! I ordered the fish tacos and was full one taco in :( My date helped me, while enjoying his bacon burger. He says its ""REALLY good, one of the top burgers I've had"" and while eating, ""the patty is cooked perfectly, exactly what I wanted."" My tacos were very good, I was only expecting two and recieved four, and I was impressed with the flavor. The drinks are pretty pricey, a soda was 3.25. My waitress' name was Sierra, she was super sweet and just the right amount of attentive. Offering me consistent refills and not overwhelming us with wellness checks while we were eating. It seems she's been doing this for a while, I really liked her! She even wrote ""thank you"" on our receipt, which was a small touch that left me feeling warm and happy :) Overrall my experience was great. I have only been to cheesecake factory once before several years ago so this was really like the first time- and I will be coming back!!!"
Al B.,"San Jose, CA",8,156,287,5.0,6/21/2015,"SECOND VISIT So I decided to come back here after a long hiatus for a late night cheesecake run.  The wait time was around 15-20 minutes due to the holiday weekend but that wasn't too much of an issue. Our order consisted of Riesling White Wine, quesadilla appetizer, and a red velvet cheesecake. Let me do a brief a review of each: Riesling White Wine: It was good but a tad bit bitter on the after taste. I liked the sweet aroma initially so that was enjoyable. Quesadilla Appetizer: The quesadilla was really good! Compared to your typical quesadilla, there is guac, salsa, sour cream, and peppers included, which all made it great! I only wish there were more to devour. Red Velvet Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the star of the night. We LOVED it! The portions of cheesecake to red velvet cake was just right and it was absolutely sweet! I liked it but she thought it was slightly too sweet. Decor and presentation was great as usual, which all made our appreciation of this decadent dessert even better. Overall, I had another good experience here. I would definitely come back for more if the occasion arises!"
George E.,"Morgan Hill, CA",56,8,,3.0,3/4/2017,"We have eaten at this location many times and would usually rate them a4 or 4.5, however today was an exemption.  The service was only ok, our waiter Nathanial E spent a fair amount of time at the ""bus station"" one table away from us or at the opposite end of our run.  At one point we over heard three of the wait staff talking about another team member and dropping rug ""F"" bomb. I requested additional tartar sauce and he stopped at the station and totally forgot it.  My fish and chips tasted good but suffered from too much time in the window waiting to get to the table."
Michael B.,"San Jose, CA",2,43,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Bad service, got sick immediately after eating and it's a gun free zone to top it off. Typical California."
Michael S.,"San Jose, CA",24,57,,2.0,5/7/2016,"10 to 15 minutes in line to order a plain cheesecake.  Then it took 30 minutes to get it.  An attentive manager saw I was waiting and found the $18.95 6 inch plain cheesecake.  No way should this take a total of 45 minutes.  It seems they have to go to the other side of the building for something that should be so simple.  Yes, getting a plain cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory can be an ordeal."
Michelle R.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2016,"Ridiculous, rude, messed up my door dash order and gave to someone else. Took 45 minutes for them to make another order and the manager extremely poor people skills blaming every one else without apologizing. Pompous and arrogant, immature young girl who should never put out into a management position."
Carolyn R.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Worst customer service ever! With a friend to celebrate her birthday with a large party.  Completely ignored her birthday while celebrating others in the restaurant. Asked to see the manager and was ignored. Food came out sporadic and undercooked and not what we ordered. No attempt to work with us. Will not be returning.  Update. After requesting I contact them to discuss, I followed directions provided and...heard nothing. Just reinforcing my opinion about never going back.  Probably would have left this at a bad yelp review, but now will share my experience as often as I can."
Jo-an S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1089,180,873,1.0,3/2/2016,"My family and I dined here this past weekend, and it was just THE WORST experience ever. The hostesses quoted us a 15-20 minute wait time... It took them over 45 minutes to seat us. STRIKE 1! Our food came out all wrong. The cooks back there could not hit temps AT ALL. Two steak entrees came out Medium Rare instead of Medium Well. Aside from it being hard, the breading on the chicken sandwich was so burnt, it was almost black. On top of all this, they brought out everyone's entrees at different times. Why run food for a table of 6 before completing at least half of the ticket?! I am putting this all on the kitchen. STRIKE 2!  Sh*t happens, I get it. I spoke to John, the manager on duty. Instead of being apologetic, he was dismissive and defensive. He had the audacity to tell me that the chicken sandwich was perfectly fine because he checked the temperature himself. He would have had a valid argument if we complained about undercooked chicken, but the problem was with the texture, color, and presentation. His attitude was unacceptable, and I refuse to believe he was properly trained as a manager-- especially from a corporate restaurant chain. He definitely does not belong in the service industry.  We cancelled the chicken sandwich altogether. We sent back one of the steaks to be brought up to temp, and just packed them both to-go. 3 hours and $200 later, we left the restaurant irritated and still hungry. What did the manager John do? NOTHING. He offered no solution, but a slice of cheesecake on the house. Why would I want dessert when I did not even get to eat dinner??!!! No thanks. Keep your cheesecake, John. STRIKE 3! I will take my business elsewhere."
Xavier P.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/8/2017,Food is great if too lager a portion at times. Service is slow really slow at times. Wait times are long. I once wanted to get an order to go and got a seat instead since service at the take out counter was soo understaffed!
Melissa U.,"San Jose, CA",45,159,619,4.0,5/23/2015,"Have been here plenty of times, today we were crossing our fingers because we walked in at 11:00PM with a party of 10 hoping we would a) be able to to dine because they close at 12:00PM and b) if we did get seated we would still get good food and not last call scraps of food... We got more than good food but the most patient friendliest server as well... Especially at this hour with a large party walking in she was the sweetest! Food came quickly and bread came out hot and fresh, they made new bathes just for us...  This menu has EVERYTHING! From Chinese to Mexican, pasta to hot soups... Is it authentic? No... But all the food is pretty good. ***garlic noodles: well rounded meal, with vegetables and strong garlic taste which I prefer lots of garlic. ***bbq pizza: it was okay ***chocolate milkshake: OMG, the best I've ever had! Huge straw and delicious whipped cream ***chicken tenders and fries: it was okay, nothing special, fries just a tad salty"
Sandra R.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,2,1.0,6/18/2017,"Came in tonight for dinner and checked at the front desk at 8:50 PM. The wait was said to be 30-35 min for two. We were behind two women that were also a party of two, when they were called (9:30 PM), we knew we were going to be the next party of 2. We wait and they call out two more party of two that had checked in after us. We informed the front desk that we were waiting and that the people that were called came in after us, the front desk told us that we would be seated next. Two more party of 2 were called, we tell the front desk and they apologize and say that we would be next. It was already past 9:50 PM, we gave the pager and left. I am very disappointed in their service, even after informing them that people that had checked in after us had been getting seated, they didn't make an effort in aknowledging our presence and patience for their mix up and instead kept seating others. Will not return."
Julie S.,"San Jose, CA",90,18,6,3.0,1/10/2017,"Visited with my husband while waiting for a battery replacement at Apple.  My husband ordered the chicken littles and I ordered the Americana burger.  Food looked delicious when it arrived, but unfortunately my burger was raw in the middle (I ordered it well-done).  We told our server and she definitely saw what we saw and instead of having them recook it or order something else, I shared with my husband.  Not a huge deal since the portions are huge and my husband is kind :) but it would have been nice to have a properly cooked burger.  Our server did take my meal off of the bill, no questions asked."
Mike T.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/2/2017,"Never again! Thought we would fight for a parking spot for a decent meal but what a mistake. Waited 15 minutes and was getting up to leave when finally noticed by a waiter. We should have left. Ordered the Cuban pork sandwich,$14.00, that had a sliver of pork with dried out ham slices. Told the waiter who sent the manager over. He had the cook make another sandwich which was a mistake. The second sandwich was full of pork fat. Big chunks of fat. Guess they don't like sending food back. Never again will we consider eating here. Too many other ""good""restaurants instead of wasting money at this factory."
Yuko A.,"Salinas, CA",16,32,52,5.0,5/23/2015,"Great place, food's awesome! I always get the orange chicken or the cashew chicken, even though I always say I'm going to try something new! Took my favorite key-lime mango cheesecake to go, found a hair in the top layer of my cheesecake, sick."
Leilany G.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,16,5.0,3/22/2016,"My hubby and I are super fans of the Chicken Medeiros dish from The cheesecake factory. When we have the craving this is where we go. The dish is succulent and pretty delicious, the bread they serve is also pretty good. The service has been okay for the most part, it can be a little slow at times. This is a must try dish."
Chesean R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,57,54,5.0,12/9/2016,Compared to the other location in santa Clara i highly recommend everyone to come this location they are very polite on time and keep things in order no attitudes or anything A++++
Jackie G.,"San Jose, CA",12,35,3,1.0,7/6/2017,"I've had two bad experiences back to back. So one time I came in and they told me the wait would be 20 minutes. I went outside and came back in 20 minutes later and they told me 15 more minutes. I went back outside and came back in 20 minutes later and was like hey! My little buzzard has not rang its been now almost an hour. The same lady was like oh that thing does not work outside. How the fuck was I supposed to know that? 2nd of all come to find out they keep putting me back in line without telling me that I've been skipped and maybe its because Ive been outside? I was so hangry by this point I ask for a supervisor. I talk to this bearded gentleman probably 30's and he was like ""yeah okay?"" with a confused look on his face, I told him which girl I kept asking and she never told me anything about staying inside. He was like okay Im sorry about that. I was so livid. I used to come here allot actually. But honestly lately the quality has gone down. Their management doesn't really care so why should the hostess right? I just wish theywernt so busy so maybe they can focus on the quality of the service. I mean thats why we pay the money."
Celine L.,"San Jose, CA",22,225,341,4.0,4/18/2015,"Decided to have lunch here after shopping around at Oakridge mall. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo which was alright. Not amazing. For me , I always order the Chinese chicken salad. The lunch portion is pretty big so I got that instead of the dinner sized one. Our server also brought us a sample of their potato soup, that was really nice! The avocado eggrolls are absolutely delicious!! One of my favorites! For the bread basket I asked them for just the brown bread! So good! It's kind of sweet so I nicknamed it the ""chocolate bread"" even though it doesn't have chocolate in it. If you still have room for dessert, the red velvet cheese cake is to-die-for good! The service here is always nice as well!"
