Alex L.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/3/2016,"If you come to this location enough times, you will be disappointed.  Save yourself the trouble and find a new regular spot to go to; at least that is what we are doing.   Didn't get the order right the first time?  No worries, please fix it.  Second time?  Well could you please fix it?  Third time, NOTHING BUT EXCUSES AND INABILITY OF WEAK, SORRY EXCUSE FOR A MANAGER to get the kitchen to produce a menu dish with any consistency."
Jeff B.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/24/2017,"After years of staying away because of poor service, we tried Curbside.  When I got there I was on hold for 12 Minutes.  Had to call back, put on hold for another five minutes before someone picks up the phone and says ""Hello""?  Another five minutes until my food is brought out.  And yes, it's cold.  Not luke warm, cold.  Now I know why we stayed away."
Alec M.,"Tracy, CA",17,153,32,1.0,12/14/2015,"The most disappointing Cheesecake Factory experience we've had, and we've been going to them for more than fifteen years. My sister and I decided to eat at The Cheesecake Factory after a work meeting. From the moment we walked in, something was wrong. The woman who greeted us at the counter... well, she didn't greet us at all. She simply said ""how many"" without even looking at us, and didn't say a word nor smile at us as she led us to our table. No wait, but it was a weekday in the mid-afternoon, so that was expected. We got to our table, and we started playing the waiting game. Despite there being very few tables filled, it took ten minutes for our server to even come up to us. Waiting became the theme of our meal. Waiting to get acknowledged, waiting to get water... we never got refills, by the way. While our server was nice enough, it became obvious she was more interested in talking with her server friends instead of dealing with us. We'd look up during the meal and see her chatting with other servers at the register, even though we were waiting for water, waiting for our food to get boxed up, waiting for our check... it was infuriating. Not to mention I had wasted a $10 shopkick gift card on the meal. For those familiar with the program, you know how tough it is to get to the $10 mark. The upside: my food (pasta carbonara) was delicious as always, and our appetizer was great as well. My sister's eggplant parmesan was over-salted and was sent back, and her new entree of orange chicken was a new preparation that she didn't care for.  I sent an email to Cheesecake Factory the night of our meal and have yet to get a response."
Cesar C.,"Salinas, CA",29,10,,2.0,5/29/2017,"The food was good. But the service was bad. They had some kind of situation going on.  Asked for refills more than once and did not get it even after waiting for more than 30 mins. After the waiter apologized she offered free deserts which I refused to multiple times until I  finally accepted her offer, which was just useless because I didn't get the desserts once I finally gave in. Certain to say I won't be coming back.  And I drove from Monterey about an hour away because I heard from a friend that service and food was good."
Ryan V.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,3.0,5/27/2016,"I'm gonna go ahead and give this place a solid 3 stars: 5 stars if you dine in and 1.5 stars if you order to go, therefore averaging out to around a 3.  When I dine in, the food and service is great.  The only negative is the wait time for the food to arrive.  It can sometimes take up to an hour to get your food so be prepared to wait if you arrive during busy hours, however the food is always amazing and worth it. On the other hand, order to go and prepare to be disappointed.  50% of the time I order to go, my order is incorrect, cold, and normally missing at least one item.  Not sure why but it's always the case. So your best bet is to dine in and you won't be disappointed"
Dana J.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,73,9,1.0,2/15/2017,Ordered food through DoorDash yesterday and it took over three hours to get delivered. I attempted to call the restaurant to find out with the issue was and they put me on hold for 15 minutes.  Finally someone got on the phone and said that they were having some technical issues and also that it was Thanksgiving and I should've expected that kind of delay. When the food finally did arrive it was cold and not edible.
Alfonso A.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/15/2017,"I got no problems this this establishment when my family go for a sit-down meal . But the last 3 times that i have phoned in an order, the experience has been atrocious. all 3 times , my order has been messed up . this last time, I received 1 item that we ordered , another item was done incorrectly and the last item was completely missing. I spent the next 40 minutes trying to speak with a manager. when I finally spoke with the manager , he was very apologetic and professional. he offered us a complimentary slice of cake . i returned for the corrected order . order was correct , BUT NO Cake. very disappointing ."
Sharon S.,"Cupertino, CA",15,20,,1.0,6/21/2016,"First of all the wait is always longer than expected. Here is the most gross thing ever so we were finally seated and given a menu. As we were moving our utensils out of the way my daughter spotted three forks and one knife with old dried food on it.. Now if that doesn't make you want to get up and leave I dont know what would. Old brown sticky stuff on the knife and the three forlks looks like it had old dried rice or some fish on something on them.  I informed our waiter and all he said was sorry I said can you send your manager over here. The manager a lady came over did not introduce herself and said she was sent over here by the waiter and didn't know why. I explained to her the utensils were filthy and unacceptable to eat with. All she said was I will tell the dishwashers  and bring you new ones said sorry and left.     ( cheeezzz thanks)""Unbelievable, with six of us we spent over one hundred and fifty dollars for what filthy forks and a knife. On top of that they brought out three of the six of us meals first the rest of us waited over fifteen minutes to get our food, theirs was already starting to get cold we told them to go ahead and just eat.  Service was terrible we had to ask for bread twice.  None of the wait staff smiled or looked as tho they would rather be some place else. Both the response was like robots oh sorry and left.. Waiter never came back to check on us just to deliver the food. My water was down to ice  I just drank the ice since no one came back to give me more.. Than they expect a huge tip na don't think so didn't do anything to deserve it, Food is not that great and we will not be visiting that location again. If your going to go there let me give you two pieces of advice first just go to Palo Alto location staff is friendly quick and very efficient a more classy place where people are happy and smiling and joking with their customers believe me you will have a much better experience and the utensils will I am sure be very clean.  And second their management staff is so much better there they come by and say hi and ask if everything is ok. Their not like robots at this  other location who say sorry like its a everyday word as hello is. Hope this gives you some insight we work hard for our money and no matter how much we spend going out to eat our Utensils should be clean. Let me know what you think.."
Vickie N.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,3.0,11/10/2016,"I love their red velvet cheese cake. I think they have the best cheesecakes around:) I always enjoyed lettuce raps and pastas. However, somehow the place is a little noisy for me. Sometimes waitress are great but it is service is not consistently good."
Mastercraft R.,"Los Altos, CA",0,60,28,1.0,6/18/2016,"Worst service ever. I normally use doordash to pass on the hassle of their pick up service chaos and nightmare. But today I took it upon myself to do a pickup order. WORST idea ever. I simply ordered 2 slices of cheesecakes and waited in their pickup spot for 40 mins. My son was sleeping in the car. Then he started crying 40 mins later, the order was still not done. Spoke to Angie, Shasha, and whoever else. They said they would take care of me. Nothing! Ended up leaving without my simple order. Stay away from this mediocre, low quality, low service place people. Or if you are really desperate, use Doordash or otder from PF Changs next door. Pickup orders there were seamless and fast!!"
Catherine U.,"Los Altos, CA",77,51,4,1.0,1/22/2016,"My bf and I went to this Cheesecake Factory a little while ago, I have been meaning to leave this review. It was a Friday night and they get super busy, so when we were told 35-35 minutes, we decided to grab ourselves drinks and wait. Their mojitos are very yummy. So a while passes, and our drinks are all gone, but we wait patiently, less so as time goes by. Watching people get seated who came after us, I ask my bf to check on the waiting list. He is kind of shy so what the hell, I do. The hosts look at each other and I just knew they messed up. But they lie and say, oh you're next. Whatever. I'm starving. We get seated outside, which sucks, but again, I'm really hungry at this point. And guess what? More waiting. Eventually, a waitress comes by and asks if anyone has helped us, to which we both answer ""no"". She says no one told her they were seating more people in her section and she was on her way out. Ok. That sucks. But she takes our order anyway. And guess what? More waiting. People whose orders were taken after us received their orders before us. Figures. This is just that kind of night. Worse yet, an employee sat at the table next to us with the same dish my bf ordered. Coincidence? NOPE. The waitress comes by, not a minute later, to tell us someone had taken my bf's dish ""by accident"" and they were making him a fresh one. And for the inconvenience? Here's a free slice of cheesecake. We asked to speak to a manager, who very much seemed like she could care less. She basically nodded, faked sympathy, and asked if we got our free cheesecake. I get it, their business wouldn't suffer at all without our patronage. So be it. I'd rather spend my money at a restaurant that actually cares about guest experience. We've never been back to this Cheesecake Factory location again."
Alice N.,"San Jose, CA",93,14,36,3.0,11/3/2014,I just did a same-day phone order for a 6-inch strawberry cheesecake with the dark chocolate topper for my mom's birthday. Total was 25.90. It was ready for me within 20 minutes. I got there around 40 minutes after the call & the cheesecake was ready but not the topper. I checked the cheesecake while I waited which turned out okay although a bit smashed..  I waited about 5 minutes for the topper but I would have been willing to wait longer if I knew it would have looked like this.  I'm upset that the topper was rushed & looks the way it does. :(
Melanie H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/7/2017,"My husband and I were blown away at the sheer number of options on the menu, as we had apparently never been to the Cheesecake Factory before. 25 page menu!! I love that there is a little bit of everything for everyone - which makes it a great place to go when you have a big group, so everyone can be happy getting what they are in the mood for. Asian, Mexican, burgers, mac n cheese, Greek, variety of gourmet salads, soup, and of course cheesecakes, etc... you name it. We also tried an appetizer that seemed a little small for the price at first, but it was the best food I have ever had at a restaurant in my life! So delicious. So worth it. So going back."
Dany B.,"Union City, CA",323,530,2692,3.0,11/3/2014,"I don't know if I've ever eaten at this location, maybe just the Valley Fair one? I didn't even know there was outside seating! LOL. Only negative thing about outside seating when it was cold, their outdoor heaters. They sat us without one, and there was plenty to be seated at, Appetizer: Stuffed Mushroom - Cheesy and greasy, but delicious. (My mushrooms were strangely flipped over when baking, the cheese all stuck to the bottom) Sweet Corn Tamale - don't let the 'sweet' fool you, it was tart on top, and sweet where the corn was. the guacamole and sour cream was a nice mix. I forgot which dish I had - it had asparagus and shrimps in it. it was good. The pasta wasn't hard or overcooked. Sauce was light. Do not order the passion fruit tea... it was just straight tea with a hint of fruit. I asked for a second drink, pineapple/orange juice mix... it came back tasting like coconut? Something is wrong here.... Their Ultimate Cheesecake (Red Velvet) was no mas. I don't know if it's popular, but it was all out and none was to be had.  Our waiter did some disappearing act, came when needed but when we wanted time to order to-go he suggested to order 10 minutes before leaving... I don't know about you, but when I'm eating I don't give myself a time limit of how long I'll be staying to eat. Needless to see, I didn't order anything to go."
Charly C.,"San Jose, CA",56,12,2,1.0,6/12/2016,"I recently purchased cheesecake from here and took it home. I ate one and got terrible food poisoning. When I called to tell them they questioned me as if they were doctors. The manager became defensive and basically said that there was no way I could have gotten sick from there. Which I know for a fact that I did. I am definitely not sure if I'll be returning. They had no sympathy, no apology, no customer service.  Till this day no one has contacted me or followed up on this situation. Very disappointed for sure!"
S D.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,4,4.0,4/13/2016,"Good food and great ambience. I enjoy going to this restaurant, especially for dinner. Once, I did not like one specific dish and I told them very lightly about my dislikings. They apologized and to my surprise, did not charge for that meal! I was impressed :-) Apart form that one off incident, I have always liked all the dishes they serve."
Leo M.,"San Jose, CA",158,156,1444,4.0,9/30/2014,"Great food. Not so great service. They're either understaffed or undertrained or both. Kale Salad is spectacular with the almonds and fruit. Ahi Tuna Tartare has the right balance of raw tuna on avocado and the chips just crumble right down with it. Kids meal comes with a drink and we chose Alfredo pasta with grilled chicken. They do fresh grated cheese and we don't say stop, just keep pouring on that cheese! My favorite word here, Pumpernickel!"
Michael J.,"San Jose, CA",1,9,16,1.0,10/27/2016,"No contact information given from cheesecake! Don't waste your time going to this ""place""... As I documented in my original review I'll discuss this matter with the district manager / please provide this person's contact information. It appears cheesecake has hired journalism students to monitor poor reviews and post ""do nothing"" responses. I have seen absolutely no responses to the numerous poor reviews that any corrective action is being done regarding the service/staff."
Janin Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,3.0,4/26/2017,"You should not go here on a Friday or Saturday evening. Wait times are crazy long, especially if you are going in a larger group. The quality of the service really varies, depending on the server. Food is good."
