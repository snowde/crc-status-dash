Sonia T.,"San Jose, CA",209,237,248,4.0,11/1/2013,"I always love coming here for date night with the hubz. They have really nice and friendly staff here. My usual food: Macaroni Balls!!! They are so yummy and full of cheesy goodness!  I always love to get the four cheese pasta with chicken. Yummy! Also recommend the chicken fettuccine. Last but not least the CHEESECAKE!!! I can't leave this place without a piece of their amazing cheesecake.  My top two favs are the white chocolate macadamia nut and the red velvet. Cons: I hate the wait here. There is always a line! I also hate how they always try to put my husband and I in the far back in a cramped area. Luckily they are always nice to move us to a booth when we ask since my husband can get very claustrophobic. After waiting in line you have to wait forever for your food.    It can be very dark in the room so always watch your step. Be warned it can be very pricey here, especially if you order any drinks. Besides this place is really nice. I recommend taking your special someone here!"
tae k.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",158,806,6,2.0,9/16/2014,The food is decent.  I have been to this place several times and there is a terrible sewage odor just outside.   Service is subpar.  Our server never stopped by to check on us and we waited for a very long time and our appetizer came out with the rest of our food.  The manager did apologize for the long wait.
Nicole V.,"Hollister, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/27/2016,"Me and my mom visited Saturday 9/24 we got in the wait list for about 50 minutes after waiting 35 we found out we could go to the bar and order from the full menu, the guys working the bar were very attentive and nice! Got our drinks going and order in, a timely matter, everything was good and the experience was great and we didn't have to keep waiting for a booth or table, it was perfect for the two of us! Sorry other people didn't have the experience we did. I work  in the beauty industry and service new and returning customers everyday and I know what good customer service is and isn't. The employees that night were on top of it the best they could with how busy it was!"
Veronica C.,"Cupertino, CA",777,641,3821,4.0,8/13/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants.  Delicious food, $$, huge portions, the outrageous curves of the murals and Egyptian-inspired architecture really set the mood. I do, however, believe that not all Cheesecake Factories were created equal.  I would order the same dish at two different locations and sometimes they'd be excellent, other times not so much.  This particular location, though very crowded, has always been consistent in cooking up great dishes. My favorites things to order from CF: *Spicy Ahi Tempura roll (appetizers): ahi tuna rolled up with nori done tempura-style.   Try this; It's so yummy! * Fried calamari (appetizer) * Crab cake sandwich * Chicken bellagio * Chicken Madeira * Pasta carbonara * Banana cream cheesecake- They have 31 cheesecakes to choose from, yes 31!! Having tried several, my favorite is still the banana cream cheesecake, so save some room for their desserts!"
Tae Hwan I.,"Cupertino, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/23/2015,"The worst Cheese Cake Factory I have ever been by far.  Food quality is really bad, especially they just literally burnt the steak when I asked for medium. Pasta tasted horrible: over cooked and not enough sauce.  The bakery never pick up the phone and they are always rude.  If this is the only cheese cake factory you visited, try the one in Union Square, San Francisco. Totally different restaurant."
Petra M.,"San Jose, CA",6,14,,3.0,9/3/2016,"Don't get me wrong, I love the food here. It's a bit expensive though and about a third of the time they get the order wrong when you place it over the phone for pickup. Also, don't bother with curbside, you'll be waiting forever."
Thai J.,"San Jose, CA",25,4,,5.0,9/3/2016,"Midnight craving. James hooked it up! Great guy, awesome manager. He's definitely an asset to the cheese cake factory on blossom hill. Peace"
Suzie D.,"Cupertino, CA",440,18,131,5.0,10/16/2015,I love this place. Everyone is so professional and accommodating Love their food especially the Greek salad.!!
Liliette C.,"San Jose, CA",24,3,2,2.0,9/9/2016,"Last night My friends and I went here to celebrate one of my friends birthday. Right when we came in we got seated and we kindly asked if we can get seated in a booth instead of the table we originally got. The lady was rude about it and said "" the booth are all closed"" when there was obviously people seated at the booths? We went back to our table and the server was absolutely rude. She gave us really hard and not fresh bread. She was rushing us to take our orders and when she did she saw how our waters cups were empty but she didn't even mind to refill them unless we asked her too. The food took more than 25 mins to come out and when it came she kept walking back and forth to see if we were done. Never again am I going back to that Cheesecake Factory. Worst experience I ever had. McDonald's would've treated me better then what I experienced last night. Cheesecake please hire more friendly servers!"
Maddie J.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/7/2016,"Tonight me and my boyfriend came in for a quick bite to eat around 10 O'clock. We were not acknowledged by our server for about 10 minutes and then he proceeded to take another 15 minutes to bring us 2 waters and some bread. Mind you he was just standing around talking to co-workers and doing anything but serving his small section of tables.  It then took 35 minutes for us to receive our food AND my meal came out absolutely wrong in every way. I asked for my pasta to have extra basil and with NO marinara sauce because I am allergic to tomatoes. My dish came out covered in marinara and absolutely NO basil.  Me and my boyfriend having both been waiting tables for over 2 years so we understand if it's busy and the server is running around, but this was the worst dining experience we have ever had and I am beyond disappointed.  Never coming back."
Simi T.,"Gilroy, CA",0,12,48,1.0,12/10/2016,"So absolutely disappointed. We were told we would have a 30-40 min wait, took over an hour to be seated and another hour for our food. Food was ok...nothing to be missed. Unfortunately we will not be coming back to this location. If you have time to waste, perfect place to eat."
Lorraine W.,"Visalia, CA",1,42,11,3.0,10/27/2014,"Went in here to try their pumpkin cheesecake. Didn't taste like cheesecake at all. Tasted like pure pumpkin. The crust was rubbery and the texture of pumpkin cheesecake seemed a bit old. Service was average. I stood at the counter waiting while I watched the cashier joke around with one of her coworkers before she realized I was there, but when she did notice me she was polite and I got my cheesecake pretty quickly.  Overall, this place is overrated. This place is supposed to be known for their cheesecakes, but I rather save my time and go to Olive Garden. Their pumpkin cheesecake is way better and more flavorful."
Emma C.,"San Jose, CA",1,14,2,1.0,8/29/2016,"Ordered the chicken marsala with mushrooms.  The portions was huge but the taste was bland.  The fresh strawberry cheesecake for dessert was good. Overall, the food isn't worth the cost.  Atleast, I had leftovers for the next lunch."
Brian D.,"Campbell, CA",960,1173,284,5.0,7/11/2014,"The only two things that could make this place better.....ok,three things!-Are: 1) it was 10 feet from my front door 2) the dinners were free and  3)-it was less crowded with no waiting! The appetizers are the best part of the  food items to me,especially all the fish items like seared tuna with pepper corns ET-Yum! The salads are very Calibunga fresh and tasty and the lettuce selection crisp.Some of the  salad dressings are the  bomb! They have a good assortment of minimum classic items with a touch of creativity and I think anyone's taste can be had here.i love the ambiance and only draw back is crowdedness because it's really great for dining or drinks at the  open and trafficy bar. This is a very well planned out concept restaurant with wonderful and tasty food!"
cecilia m.,"San Jose, CA",2,49,133,4.0,10/9/2015,"I don't come here that often, but it sure is a place I love to eat at. I love the decor in this restaurant, and most importantly there food is great! However I do have to say there waiters are always very busy and it does take quite a bit of time for them to attend to us. I have only tried three of there dishes,  and I have to say they are all great, but my favorite is the scampi amd steak Dianne. The meat is very tender and juicy. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some good dinner after a long day, there portions are pretty big, if you as we know me; I would say you can actually share the pasta plates with one or two other persons!"
Suzy Q.,"San Martin, CA",8,309,18,2.0,1/28/2016,"Jambalaya 4.0  Herb crusted salmon & steak diane 1.0 The 2/3 beef medallions were burnt on one side. The third was rare. It was hard to press my fork into the meat. Thats how charred it was! The management, kitchen staff and server should be embarrassed to let this plate out of the kitchen and serve it! When I brought it to the manager's attention and the medallions were remade and came back rare no sauce or mushrooms. The portions of salmon & were significantly smaller by comparison to what I had at the Vegas location. The lemon raspberry cheesecake was served at the improper temperature. It was so hard it was like an ice cream cake. I brought this to the ""manager's"" attention and he apologized but didnt offer to bring anything else or even to remove the dessert or discount from our bill. So as for the server she was eeh. 2.5 The so called manager I give a big fat zero!!"
John L.,"Watsonville, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/13/2016,Came here yesterday with my family and girlfriend. A little more on the expensive side but it's totally worth it. Usually I get the angel hair pasta with shrimp but the whole menu is good! I def recommend this place!
Mike P.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/31/2016,"very delicious food, the service is acceptable. the host was very unfriendly. I said it was my son's birthday to send me two desserts with candles. she answered me: tell your waiter about it. Good food and good service but very poorly staffed front. I do not recommend this location of cheese cake"
Leslee S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/4/2016,"I called yesterday to order the smaller cheesecake size.  The woman on the phone said that they always have cheesecakes on hand and that I did not have to place an order.  She even gave me the price of the smaller cake. I called back today just to ensure that they had the flavor I wanted, and a man told me they don't even make the smaller size yet! He said that all restaurants in California will be making them, but none have started baking them yet. Sounds like a bunch of BS to me. I called another Cheesecake restaurant (the one with better customer service), and guess what, they do make them and the woman informed me that all restaurants should have them."
Sanaa H.,"Mountain View, CA",29,39,87,4.0,4/24/2016,"Usually a short wait but always worth it. An enormous menu with quality delicious food choices followed by enormous dishes! You can almost always share! It's clean and close to a mall. So eat & shop, eat our economy going!"
