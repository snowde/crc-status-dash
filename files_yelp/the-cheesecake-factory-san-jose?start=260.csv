Kim M.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,6,4.0,8/13/2016,The loaded baked potato soup is absolutely wonderful! It's the most delicious soup that I've ever tasted. The chicken pot stickers are amazing. I love the peach smoothie. There's great service and nice music.
Kathy A.,"Saratoga, CA",460,26,6,5.0,6/28/2016,"Amazing service from CHET our waiter! He was sooo sweet and attentive. For a big group of girls we gave him kinda a hard time when ordering, and he was so helpful and nice about it!! We love you dude, best waiter at this location forsure!"
Anna A.,"Milpitas, CA",12,12,54,4.0,7/6/2015,"Went to see a movie but we need to fill our tummies before heading to cinema. Since my husband knows that I am fan of cheesecake, we decided to dine here. Waiting time on a late afternoon Saturday is around 15-20 minutes.  The ambiance is good. They serve us freshly baked sourdough while waiting for our food. I think it would be great if they can serve this with olive oil and balsamic vinegar not just butter.  We ordered avocado egg rolls for starters. This is so good. 6 freshly made avocado rolls with a very interesting dipping sauce. I love it! For me this is a must have :) The my daughter had cheese pizza. We ordered the big one instead of the child's meal. Well, it was just ok, nothing extravagant. For my hubby, he had Americana burger. This can be shared (for Asians like us, one can't finish the burger alone) I can say, after being here in Bay Area for just half a year only and had tried burgers all over, this is one of the best burgers I had. The burger, the bun, the cheese, the veggies and the secret sauce, love it! We managed to eat half only. I love to bake and red velvet cake is one of my forte. I ordered ultimate red velvet cheesecake and this is sooo good! Highly recommended!  We were served by John and he was really friendly. As usual we were not able to finish our food, we had to go boxes and John packed for us. We had a great meal. We are definitely coming back. We spent $50+ for this meal."
Lauren H.,"Santa Clara, CA",786,163,373,4.0,7/4/2014,"I think I come here way more than any healthy person should, oops! So because of this, I feel obligated to finally write a heart felt honest review.  Alright the menu here is most definitely intimidating. It is literally top to bottom, page after page lists of different appetizers, small plates, salads, and entrees. No joke, I probably have tried everything on the menu and that itself says a lot haha. I recommend the asian chicken salad. It's enough to feed a small village and it's definitely tasty. Or, if you like pasta I really enjoy the garlic noodles here because it's made like a pasta. COMPLETELY different from garlic noodles from yard house and straits which I personally despise. However the crown jewel of this huge restaurant chain is the pick and pair double entree. You can choose  two out of the shrimp scampi, steak Diane, miso salmon and the Parmesan chicken. My favs are the steak Diane paired with the chicken. It's definitely the biggest bang for your buck. I always save 2/3 of the plate for lunch and dinner the day after. Service at this location isn't always the best because they're swamped most of the time. But they are much nicer than their sister restaurant over at valleyfair. The only problem I've ever had at this location is on a couple of locations my food came out cold but nothing a quick pop in the microwave or back on the grill won't fix!"
Chandra S.,"San Jose, CA",74,149,53,4.0,7/7/2014,"No I can't like this. I am a food snob! So why am I giving this place 4 stars? We had the Belgian waffle, a huge salad, the mini crab cakes and a humongous plate of fries and it all was AMAZING!! And it all was HUGE... The waffle was crispy on the outside, sweet and fluffy on the outside, there were yummie crunchy pecans, soft sour/sweet strawberries and lovely maple syrup.  The salad (can't remember which one it was) was delicious and my husband said that it didn't get boring despite the fact that it was huge.  The fries were wonderful but the crab cakes were spectacular. Crunchy fluffy crab balls with an amazing sauce. I could have those any day.  Damn it Cheese Cake Factory...damn it...you are not classy or unique, you are a chain but damn you are good. Damn you!!"
Brandy W.,"San Diego, CA",645,555,118,3.0,5/21/2015,"Wow after yelping for 3 years, it seems my tastes have changed.  I used to love the food from cheesecake factory.  Now, it just tastes subpar. Not being super hungry for their super portions, we opted for tapas on their light menu.  Granted their ""light menu"" has tapas below 500 cal.  When we opt for 4 appetizers to share, that is not exactly light.  We ordered the ahi carpaccio, lettuce wraps, spring rolls, and crab puffs. There were two ahi dishes on the menu, one was double the price of the other.  When I asked the waiter the difference between the two, he had said the amount of ahi varies.  Boy was he being honest.  The cheaper of the two had about 2 spoonfulls of ahi!  They should call it avocado carpaccio with ahi garnish.  I felt bamboozled. The lettuce wraps weren't much better.  More than half of the plate was filled with what I call ""cheap filler food.""  For these wraps that means crispy rice noodles.  Once again, most would consider that garnish or decoration, but it was necessary to add any substance to the lettuce wraps. The spring rolls contained almost all filler food.  Instead of focusing on the shrimp, it had noodles in it... noodles in a wrapper. Not even quality veggies.... just carbs carbs carbs. I think the crab puffs, although my least favorite of all the dishes, had the most substance to it.  Bread crumbs, cream cheese and Krab rolled and deep fried.  Who knows, maybe cheesecake factory was always like that, but no wonder their calorie count is super high. Service was good at this location, except we had to notify the team of a terrible... spill in the restroom.  They didn't seem super concerned about it."
Chesca P.,"San Jose, CA",1,1,,1.0,4/16/2016,They have terrible staff and poor costumer service. They gave us the buzzer and said 30 minutes. We come back our buzzer is vibrating and I asked this one bitch if our table was ready and she goes to fucking check and then doesn't come back. So I asked that bitch again is our table fucking ready and she goes off with a bitch fit. So I leave and I will NEVER be fucking coming back. It is also so suffocating in this place and is completely disorganized!
Alyssa R.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,7,5,1.0,5/3/2016,"BEWARE this restaurant if you have any kind of special dietary needs (food allergies, gluten intolerance, vegetarian, vegan, etc). I went here today with my little one, who has some serious food allergies and gets very sick after eating soy, eggs, or dairy. Since he's breastfed, I have to avoid the same foods he does. I have gotten pretty good at what meals are most likely safe, and chose a meal for both him and me and asked the server to please just double check they'd be safe. He said the only potential issue was mashed potatoes. When the food came out, I was confused that his meal came with the mashed potatoes. I asked the server who brought the food and she said they were indeed made with dairy. We scraped those off and our server apologized and said he'd get us some carrots instead. As I'm eating my meal, I suddenly notice... THEY MADE IT WITH CHEESE. So they messed up BOTH meals that were supposed to be safe. Mind you, I explained this was an allergy issue, and the server said he talked it over with the chef and noted the specific issues. Our server offered to have my meal remade without cheese, but I didn't feel like I could trust their food at that point, so we removed it from the bill. Aside from that, they charged us in full for everything and just said they were sorry for the ""inconvenience."" Yes... I suppose that's one word for my child crying in pain. Hopefully we stopped eating fast enough that he won't be sick. I will never be back and given how badly they messed up, just don't risk it if you have any special dietary circumstances! You cannot trust them!"
Tien N.,"Santa Cruz, CA",5,39,6,3.0,11/22/2015,"Came here on a Wednesday night after work with 3 other friends. Hostess told us wait would be about 15 minutes, 30 minutes rolled by and still no sign of our buzzer flashing. I asked the hostess she said we were next.  I wanted to order the Thai peanut past however it was discontinued. That was a bummer since my heart was set on that. Ended up getting the Kobe beef burger. That was massive, very juicy and flavorful but messy. They let me switch the fries to mash too with no cost. One thing I don't like about this place is that the lights are always too dim. Overall service was good, not great but it was dinner time I guess."
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,4.0,7/3/2012,"I know it's bad for me, but I love this place. Still one of my favorite restauarnts because there's so many options and so much food!!!  Came here last night to meet some friends, as our tradition has been meeting at a Cheesecake Factory in So Cal or Nor Cal. We were seated in the bar area, ironically because my friend had her baby and a stroller. Which was fine with me since it was before 6, and we could still order from the HH menu! Except only problem was our booth reeked of rotten milk/cheese, and it wasn't the baby! The booth was also a bit of a mess too, lots of crumbs near my seat. We were given sourdough bread, my favorite, no wheat, yay! Which was a bit odd though in case if anyone else wanted wheat. I started with a cosmopolitan, which was only $5 during the happy hour. We also ordered 2 appetizers that were $5, the corn tamales and avocado egg rolls. The cosmo was good and strong, and the appetizers came out right away. There were exactly 3 corn tamale cakes for the 3 of us, and they were huge! They were a bit dense, but really good, filled with corn, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, and cilantro that I picked off. It was also dipped in a creamy chipotle sauce, so good, but makes you so full! The avocado egg rolls were packed with avocado, too much for me! It's also accompanied with a cilantro sauce, yucky for me! I pretty much always order the farafelle pasta with chicken, even though it's on the list of worst chicken dishes in a restaurant. I was so full from all the bread, tamale, and egg roll, that I had about 3 bites. It was a bit heavier this time, but I now have 3 meals out of it! My friend got the miso salmon, which is always good, and my other friend didn't really enjoy his ahi tuna. From the looks of it, it didn't look very good. Our waiter was super attentive, always refiling our drinks with a quickness."
Cathie N.,"San Jose, CA",477,176,1057,4.0,3/29/2014,"I love eating at Cheesecake Factory but I do hate the wait! But of course, patience is a virtue, and if there's a wait, it means it MUST be good! I enjoy all of their cheesecakes here. The dishes are also very good. During my last visit, my friends and I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and one of the omelets! I must say that all of the dishes were delicious. The seared tuna was delicious and they were pretty thick slices. The Cajun jambalaya pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a little bit too spicy for my liking but it was bearable! And it's amazing that they omelettes at any time of day. My girlfriends and I came here for dinner and one of them was craving an omelette!  Also I love their bread! The brown one is delicious!"
Tiffany G.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,3,5.0,1/27/2017,"Excellent location. Every time my date and I attend this venue we've had less than a 10 minute wait for the dining room which is excellent considering the other Cheesecake Factory by Santana Row has a wait time of 2 hours on their busy days. Staff have been great and are always attentive. The Caesar salad and Fettuccine Alfredo taste wonderful, would also recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls. 5 Stars!"
Evelyn V.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/27/2016,"Came here on a Sunday during brunch hour. It was not busy and got seated right away, didn't even have to wait one minute. We came here to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and we're looking forward to a nice and deserved time out of the routine. However, the service was not what we expected and we only stayed because we had already ordered the food. Our server promised to bring us bread whenever it was ready because they were baking it, and this never happened we actually had to ask another server for it once we finished with our appetizer. And we didn't even see our server until we finished eating because she disappeared for a while and then when she appeared again she only gave attention to other tables and not ours. She didn't even ask how our was or if we needed anything else. I will never return to this location."
Mika T.,"San Jose, CA",73,14,2,1.0,3/31/2016,"Absolutely terrible customer service. We were sat down right away and we ordered shortly after. While waiting for our food they sat 6 other parties who all got there food before us,mind you there's were only 4 of us. We sat there for 50 minutes watching everyone else get there food before us. Idk why it was like that today maybe because I wasn't dressed appropriately in cheesecake friendly attire. Spend your money elsewhere."
Jasmine B.,"Gilroy, CA",4,16,2,5.0,5/26/2015,We are regulars here and always order the same dish. Although we have tried many more. We come here at least once a week so I feel like i can give an honest reveiw. Some days we have good service and some we have bad but the food NEVER disappoints us.  Definitely recommend.
Manny U.,"Gonzales, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/26/2015,Good place and food... :) When it gets packed it's chaos but other than that it's a good environment
AbovetheRest A.,"San Jose, CA",17,17,1,1.0,6/20/2017,worst first time experience. i am a doordash driver. upon arrival woman working the to go orders was polite to tell me my order was 10min from being done (i waited patienly) after 15min i get in line and rude man working the cashier that time shouts who is here from door dash while i was the only one right in front with my bag and shirt on. i say me he says whos the order name and i tell him while showing my phone at same time. he takes my phone rudely again takes a while looking at it and gives me the order i ask can i get napkins and utinsels he rudely again says next time tell them order it on the app! i dont say nothing and go on my way. i check my order briefly and leave i deliver the order and customer calls me instantly and says order is completely wrong! i dont open peoples food other than visually from outside scanning the order so he was in the wrong for givine me the incorrect order because he was being a rude jerk!
Rosanna B.,"San Jose, CA",3,20,2,5.0,12/31/2016,Kevin V. Was a great server. There checking on us always. Food and drinks were great as always. Thanks Kevin V. Happy New Year!!
Lorie N.,"San Jose, CA",87,118,663,4.0,7/9/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has a huge variety of food on their regular menu, skinny menu, kids menu, and alcohol and beverage selection. Service is always good here. The brown bread is awesome. You've got to get the Oreo milkshake....omg...so good!!! Their happy hour menu is big and good as well. Feel like American cuisine and don't want to take risks?.... There's no going wrong with dinning at Cheesecake Factory :)"
Navi K.,"San Jose, CA",2,24,5,1.0,3/18/2017,"Had the worst dining experience ever! Service here is ridiculous! Got there, was seated wrong, got cold not fresh bread, requested for fresh bread and it was still stale and not fresh. We requested for water from different waiters several times, even the manager, and did not get any water until we told another waiter about our situation. When we spoke to a manager all he said was ""im so sorry about that, ill be right back"" and he never came back. The lady who was our waitress did not check on us nor look at us after we spoke to the manager. She did not even bother apologizing. Ontop of that she looked at us and actually said ""have u guys been here before?"" I understand waiters ask that question but the way she asked us was not right. After waiting for almost a hour for our food we ended up getting up and leaving. While we were leaving the waitress came up to us and asked us what was wrong and when i told her whats going on and how we wanted to just leave she did not bother saying sorry. She just said okay. We went to the front and asked for the bill for the stuff we had ate which was just 1 appetizer which mind you was served 1) cold 2) with no plates. I suppose they thought we were supposed to eat off the table. The manager did not bother coming back to us, or even apologizing, instead he sent over another waiter, with our bill of $40, including a thai wrap we did not touch, 2 lemonades we did not drink and 1 appetizer that was cold. When we asked the employee why the manager did not personally come and give us the check he said the kitchen is backed up and he is busy there. So, im guessing we were not important enough. We told the employee we will pay for what we ate. He went back and said the manager said its okay you dont have to pay. I felt like i was in a low class restaurant. I went to BJ's brewhouse one time and i found a hair in my food the manager came up to me right away, apologized gave a $50 gift card, took the food off the receipt, and brought me new fresh food, he also personally came up to us to check if everything was okay. We went there to celebrate my 23rd birthday and this is the service we received. I am so disappointed, this was one of my favorite resturants and ive been a huge fan of their four cheese pasta. Im not mad im just very disappointed that i chose this place to celebrate my birthday at."
