J K.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Meal was fine. Service horrible. We come here a lot and are so disappointed this happened. They took our credit card and when bill came back and we opened to sign, the credit card was missing. When we asked about this they immediately went into defense mode. ""You sure? Did you check your wallet? I'm a 100% sure I put it back in"". This escalated to the manager. She immediately said they train their staff on cc's and asked if I'm accusing her staff of stealing the card. I tried to explain to her that I feel that when we give them our credit card, it is their responsibility until it comes back into our possession. I think she disagrees. My family was there we saw the bill being delivered back to my dad. We saw him open it and we saw there was no card in there. Now after my dad explained the card was missing he had to use the restroom. So after we and the staff walked around the place looking for the card we decided to cancel it. My dad is from out of town and a cancelled card is not good. After all this, a staff member said he found the card in the restroom under some trash. Maybe it dropped out inadvertently and some guest took it got the number and tossed it in the trash. Still a staff member looking in the restroom finding the card under some trash? Nice detective skills. When she found out and I was trying to explain that even if the card fell out by accident and some guest took it it was still their fault. All I got from her and the other male manager looking person was ""we saw your dad use the restroom."" ""It happens to other guests"" apparently they have an epidemic of people dropping cc's in their restroom. I mentioned that my dad used the restroom after the card was discovered and we all saw him open it with card missing. No way he picked up the card, fail to put the card back into his wallet, go to the restroom and throw his card in the trash. From a pure customer service point of view take responsibility and stop blaming the customer for the error. Basically they said that we lost the card and they found it what do we want from them. How bout treating us like human beings? So now my dad is without his card while traveling far from home. Thanks Cheesecake. No way did Manager or that other guy try to de-escalate the situation. All we could do was not tip and pay. I have to admit Cheesecake corporate was very nice and offered a $25 gift card but we won't be eating at Cheesecake anytime soon. And the bill was a hell of a lot more than $25. Even if they didn't bill us this experience would definitely not be worth it. On top of this service was slow!"
Ken M.,"San Mateo, CA",9,36,32,5.0,4/25/2015,My girlfriend and I had a beautiful journey :). Kevin mayer ( also know as Kevin yes) very funny and upbeat waiter. He recommend great choices and put a smile on both of our faces. Very pleased with the service and love the atmosphere here. Nice and day classy look.:)
Katie B.,"San Jose, CA",6,43,1,1.0,3/5/2016,Do not order curbside/to go here. We arrived 15 minutes before our food was supposed to be ready and waited at least 30 additional minutes. When we opened our food at home it was super cold! This place is more concerned with volume than customer service and didn't respond when I contacted them for a response. Want to wait to eat inside? That will be at least 1 - 1.5 hours. There are so many better places to eat in San Jose. Don't do it!
Stone C.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,,3.0,7/13/2016,"Crowds! Don't be crazy hungry and expect to get a seat fast unless you are coming at the tail end of lunch or dinner. Bathroom is filthy. Floors are super slippery with grease from the kitchen and I have witnessed other patrons sliding around. The food and atmosphere are great, service is ok. They need another location in south San Jose or Morgan Hill. They need a cheesecake sampler as most of them are a mystery."
Samantha A.,"Newark, CA",0,5,4,5.0,3/9/2016,James gave us great service in the bar. The prices for happy hour were perfect and the portions are really good sizes. Going to be back soon
Martin V.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2017,I gave it a shot once during the weekend and once during the week horrible ticket times. Not sure if they just don't have the staff but it needs some serious help. Who wants to wait a hour and a half for a salad on a Tuesday night..... faster places 2 doors down and minus the cheese cake the have the same items
Tram B.,"San Jose, CA",11,21,5,2.0,3/15/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite place of mine to go to for date or celebration. Their food (especially pasta) is always just right and the dessert is mouth watering. I recommend the bistro shrimp or the carbonara! For dessert, I usually ask for chocolate tower cake. It's so big it can be easily split between three people! One huge concern that I have is about my dogs. The servers agreed to let our huge party and two dogs in the outside seating area on a few occasions. They never misbehave and are trained to strictly sit or lay down for the whole meal. However, recently I called and asked (like i do every time) and they refused to let dogs in the patio area. I don't know if they changed the policy, but it was a real let down. I'll probably be coming here a lot less. Also, the workers were usually very nice and attentive, but lately all the service we have gotten includes them walking past, putting the food on the table and continue walking. Not one word spoken. Do you want cheese on your pasta? A refill? You probably won't get it here."
Anastassiya G.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2017,"did make an order for picking up. Called around 6:20 pm, took me about 20 minutes until someone will answer the phone. After taking my order, I was told it will take about an hour until it will be ready. Came there around 7:40 pm. Huge line in front of me, 5 people in the bakery section, none of them are working, just going around looking like they are so busy that cannot serve people. Ok, fine, i got it, did not mind to wait. At 8:15 pm i was able to talk with a person behind a counter, after asking what I did order he send a person to check if my order is ready. 30 minutes later still no answer. Than other lady comes, so i decided to check with her. All i heard from her: ""kitchen is busy, it might take around 3 hours until your order will be ready"". Are you serious?! It is been already more than 3 hours almost after i did place an order.  Than finally they did found my order, which was placed in a fridge!!!! Not even apologizing or anything, she is telling me: ""oh, it was here all that time, at the back."" When i asked her if i did understand correctly and all that time for the last hour my order was ready and nobody did even bother to check for that, she tells me: ""It is not my fault, ok"". I was speechless. Tried to talk with their manager, but all I heard from him is: ""There is a lot of people here. Sorry"".  How it is possible to treat their customers like this?! All of the employees there had an attitude like they do not care. Acting like they are super busy and do not care if people are satisfied with their service or not."
Clover V.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,5,3,3.0,7/13/2016,Super busy the Old fashioned burger was great served medium and the chicken salad sandwich was bomb. Unfortunately kids pasta with Alfredo sauce tasted like plain noodles and drenched in fat free milk literally no taste. Had to send it back second order was very cheesy once again not fettuccine alfredo. Overpriced but portions are huge.
Emily L.,"San Jose, CA",20,382,1183,4.0,7/6/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a good place to go for a celebration. This past time was for my good friends birthday. We were served by jose(josh). The kitchen was backed up for some reason on a Wednesday night but we didn't mind. We ordered some Appetizers and drinks. Our food came out before our appetizers.... But josh gave it on the house apologizing for the kitchen back up.  I don't mind! This time I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi rather than my traditional pastas. I was a bit disappointed that I was served 4... I repeat 4 pieces of steak. How irritating. I didn't wanna complain so I just ate it. It was however, really good.  We ended the dinner with red velvet cheesecake. Yummmmmmmy. Until next time cheesecake."
Lejla C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,3.0,7/1/2016,"I've never really had issues with menu/food ever. I always look to try something new, and it is almost always delicious. The staff is alright, although every time I go there I have to remind them to bring out a forgotten item. My main concern I have is the roaches.... In the last few times I have been there.. 1. We ordered dinner for pick-up one of the times. When we brought it home and started taking it out of the bags I found a cockroach on the lid of one of our pastas. We kind of brushed it off because it's not like it was IN our food. 2. When my friend and I took our children there one time we opted to eat outside because it was pretty crowded inside, and the wait would be longer. Throughout our whole dinner experience it was very difficult to relax and enjoy our food due to the multiple cockroaches that were crawling around the ground. Not to mention our children were freaking out as well! 3. Yesterday when I was there it was yet another encounter with a cockroach! After we finally received our food I spot something crawling on the end of the table and kind of shriek in horror. The waiter, as he sets down our plates, spots it as well and quickly grabs a napkin to snatch it up. He does say ""sorry about that,"" but at that point it was already a bit difficult to enjoy my experience. I have decided to take a break from this location for a while."
Mai T.,"San Jose, CA",26,118,25,2.0,7/17/2015,"I thought the convenience of curbside pickup was so I can save time looking for parking and get my food quickly.  With their customer service, that is just not the case.  I called them to let them know that I was there, I was on hold for 7 minutes.  I hung up and called again.  It could have taken me less time to run in myself, but I was in my pjs.  I'm sitting in my car as I am writing this....and I'm still waiting for my food.  You disappoint me Cheesecake Factory.  Get a second line for the bakery so we don't have to be on hold for so long. Food - it's decent, I only get it when I really have nothing else to eat and the curbside is supposed to be ""convenient"", especially if you have children in the car. Now hurry up with my food, the baby is starting to get fussy."
Sonia G.,"San Jose, CA",253,292,474,2.0,1/18/2016,"Just plain rude. I know it's busy and it's lunch hour, but where has the customer service gone these days? Get it together front counter! Maybe its the younger generation - all of them avoiding eye contact with us as we tried to put our name down, but we finally got the attention of one young lady. While we were in the middle of asking this young lady for a table outside, and she cut us off and said, ""sorry, but I am helping another customer. But there is no wait time outside"" Then she got the attention of another customer who was in a larger group behind us. After she helped him, she told another younger lady to get a table for us outside. After we were gestured to follow the lady to our seats, a young man said, wait time is now 35 minutes because we have to sit a party of 10. The original lady in front was like, ""I am sorry, outside wait-time is now 35 minutes"". Screw this. I do not need bad service or cheesecake factory food that bad. Front counter needs customer service, common courtesy, and etiquette training ASAP."
C W.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,3.0,12/24/2016,"I have been to this location several times. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff are friendly and attentive. The food is generally good but my recent experience here changed my impression regarding some of their dishes. It seems like their pasta dish was undercooked and the flavor was not that great. Not sure if it was an off day but the food was not consistent with my impression. I would probably come back again but not order the same pasta dish. All in all though, some of their other dishes are still good."
Isaac C.,"Hollister, CA",0,3,1,5.0,6/25/2016,"Came to try out this place on day with my wife and it was a great experience. The customer service was great, they were kind and helpful. The food is also awesome! I would definitely come here again."
Bailey C.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/21/2016,they lost my burrito?? i am sitting here oh so lonely with out my burrito and they offered me soup but that isn't my burrito?
Beth W.,"Los Gatos, CA",1014,262,3011,4.0,12/6/2013,"Today I had lunch with four generations ~ my mom, daughter, grandson Ian and myself.  As usual, we arrived just in time when they open at 11:30AM.  Parking at Oakridge Mall can be hard to get past 12PM and so can getting a table at The Cheesecake Factory during the lunch hour as well. Our server today was Shannon, who happened to give us the very best A+ service ever!  He anticipated our needs without our ever asking for a refill, when our appetizer was coming, etc. ~ now that's platinum level service.  Scotty is another one whom we had excellent service from as well so make sure you ask to be seated in either one of  these men's stations when you dine here. I decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.  I ordered the Americana Burger, well done and with the clam chowder (it's Friday) instead of the fries or green salad options.  This particular cheeseburger was very juicy, not greasy, for a well done burger.  I could only eat half as it was so large!  I did eat most of the soup. My mother had the Chicken Madeira which came with mashed potatoes.  She said her chicken was full of flavor as was the creamy mashed potatoes.  Noelle J., my daughter, ordered her fave The Factory Burger.  It was ordered well done also.  She noticed that my burger was much larger than hers and a dollar less in price. For dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes: Pumpkin Pecan and the S'mores one.  The Pumpkin Pecan has a pecan pie bottom layer with pumpkin cheesecake on top.  It was very good with both my mother and I enjoying it.  Noelle, being allergic to nuts, could only imagine how good that was.  I introduced Noelle to the S'mores cheesecake earlier in the fall season and she liked it so much, it's her go-to while it's still available.  Currently, the Peppermint Bark cheesecake is the new cheesecake starting this month, as the seasonal offering. As I said earlier, Shannon anticipated our dining needs well.  We had a great time during our lunch as we usually do with the added ""cherry on the top"" of great service by Shannon.  Before we left, we complimented Shannon on his service to us and asked to speak to his manager.  She came by and we related how much we enjoyed the excellent service and if he's not on the training team, he should be!  As it turns out, Shannon is part of the training team for this location. Yes, parking is still horrible here if you don't come early but we avoid that by coming when they first open!"
Ryan L.,"San Jose, CA",482,1136,3028,4.0,4/13/2014,"Pros: - Big selection of dishes - Big portions - Good food - Good cheesecake - Good bread Bad: - Cramped though a huge space - Long lines to get in - Food is not innovative - Servers singing ""Happy Birthday"" every 3 minutes - Very loud - Inattentive servers/not enough servers On the last visit, I got french fries which were cold. It took 7 minutes to get the server and then 5 more minutes for new fries. The server was nice, but it would have been nice to have my entire meal at once. The vanilla bean cheesecake was good. There were literally 4 people sung to for their birthdays while I was there. I hate this."
Catherine B.,"Campbell, CA",169,27,6,2.0,3/8/2015,"I've been here many times, and I don't think I'll be coming here again (just because I decided to venture out, and I figured out that Cheesecake Factory is a pretty mediocre restaurant).  Food: - I am a macaroni and cheese lover, and I was not pleased with their mac and cheese. I don't know how to explain it- but the taste and texture was off. You're better off getting the packaged mac and cheese at Safeway. -Sweet Potato Fries- After trying sweet potato fries from The Counter and the Palo Alto Creamery, CF's fries pale in comparison. They are definitely not crispy, and crispiness is crucial in determining if the fries are good or not. -Chicken Alfredo- Honestly, I prefer the Chicken Alfredo from Costco ( the one that's premade for you). With that being said, CF's Chicken alfredo is okay- nothing to rave about.  -Cheesecake- Now, I will say that their cheesecake is really good, but too bad it's pretty expensive. Service: This place is always packed, and I get that it will take some time to get seated. But, I find it ridiculous that people who came in after me were seated before me! If I didn't say anything, then I would have never gotten seated. Now, this happened only once, and remember that I came here many many times. As for the waiter, I think they are all very nice and attentive, so at least that's a plus."
Donna J.,"San Jose, CA",0,31,3,1.0,11/27/2016,The worst experience. For my brother's birthday everyones food came out except my moms. The manager said it was almost done but another manager later said they were barely starting to cook her chicken. The waitress was indifferent and I never got a refill & forgot to split my check. They compt the  chicken and it arrived with her 200.00 check. So my mom watched everyone eat and waited for a chicken she had to throw away at home because it was rancid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
