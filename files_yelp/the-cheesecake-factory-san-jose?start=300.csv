Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",960,131,7,2.0,1/29/2015,"Why do people love the Cheesecake Factory so much? What makes it worth the 2 hour wait on a Sunday night? I remember being traumatized by the Cheesecake Factory because the last time I came here as a kid I ordered orange chicken and it was freaking terrible. But who orders orange chicken at the Cheesecake Factory, amirite? Came here with a bunch of my girlfriends recently and everyone was raving about the Pasta DaVinci so I had to try it out. Most of us shared because the dishes run about $18 and the portions are huge.  The pasta was okay. It probably isn't fair to compare this to Olive Garden, but this dish does not hold a candle to the worst pasta entree at Olive Garden. Maybe I just had high hopes because 90% of my table ordered it. +1 for the cheesecakes, but they didn't exactly blow my mind. If I wanted to eat at a restaurant at Oakridge, I'd rather go to BJ's (still mediocre, but levels above this place)."
Phillip R.,"Fremont, CA",184,252,162,3.0,6/3/2015,"it's been awhile since i've been at a cheesecake factory. this time around, i'm trying to eat healthy. so that means to .. eat less? order --- drakes hef -it was a good pairing, i think. a light beer with a light meal. bbq ranch salad -this was pretty big, actually. it was a huge pile on my plate and, i didn't really know what to do with the rest of it. i pretty much just looked at it and knew i had leftovers. onion rings was nice n crunchy, chicken was tasty. huge amount of black beans, corn, and tomatoes italian tiramisu -just got it. it looked good. but i passed it off as a present so, i can't say how it was."
Jen O.,"Campbell, CA",43,228,41,4.0,7/27/2015,"I've never been to this location before. Came in last night for a special dinner for my boyfriends daughter. We got a table right away.  I ended up ordering a Cobb salad.  I mean how can you screw that up right? I've had better cobb salads at hole in the wall diners! Zero flavor! Mostly all lettuce, with tiny pieces of all the other goodies. The lettuce also looked slightly wilted, as if it was preassembled earlier in the day.  Lucky for me we had a really sweet waiter who quickly brought me herb crusted salmon that was really good. He saved the night! Also the dulce de leche cheesecake is ridiculously yummy!"
Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",70,303,117,4.0,5/17/2014,"My fiance had a gift card so we came here for dinner Saturday. Our waiter was the best I've had at a Cheesecake. Usually you have to wait forever to order and get the check but he was very attentive. The food and drinks were good, although I wish mine had been more sour but that's my fault for ordering a peach flavored bellini. Overall, Cheesecake is a great place to come since there's a huge menu and great dessert."
Suzy G.,"Nipomo, CA",51,333,461,3.0,4/20/2014,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory.  You ever see that Spongebob episode where the Krusty Krab is sold to a corporate chain and re-branded ""Krabby O'Monday's?""  Well, I'm sure you can imagine it.  I avoid chains like that and don't normally even think of them as ""food.""  But this was a family thing and I was swept along with the herd. I was absolutely amazed at the number of different options on their multi-page menu.  Of course, they don't have 50 different sous chefs hand-prepping each sauce.  More like 20 different food preppers pulling required sauces from the freezer.  But that being said... To my surprise, the food was very tasty!  I always love combo options so I had the Steak Diane w/ Herb-Crusted Salmon.  Everyone was very happy with their plates. The operative word here is, ""factory"" and they operate with factory precision.  An amazing number of people are squeezed in and successfully fed a surprisingly large variety of food options.  So I'd say that, for what they are, they're good at it."
A. S. J.,"San Jose, CA",72,23,7,1.0,10/17/2016,"This review is for their pick-up/curbside service. 1) I called to place my order. Someone picked up and asked if it was ok to place me on hold. As if I had a choice. Waited 15 mins before anyone picked up the line and finally took my order. They said it would take 15-20 mins. 2) parked in the 10 minute parking for curbside to go and called the number posted on the sign. Whoever picked up must have been on a satellite phone in another country because the static was ridiculous, not to mention she was talking a mile a minute. I said ""Hi, I'm calling from curbside parking to pick up my order?"" to which she gave a response so sloppy and fast that I couldn't even make out what she said. I thought maybe she asked for my name so they could get my order ready to bring out but before I could say anything I was yet again placed on hold. 3) Now another 13 mins on hold and no one has picked up the line, I decide to make another call from my phone to the same number. The same person picked up and I told her what the deal was and did she give any type of apology??? NO. She just said ""uh yea, what's your name again?"" AGAIN??? As if she had got it the first time. I told her and she asked what type of car I was in. I told her and she said she would tell them right now. 4) it has now been another 15 mins and I see door dash people coming and going left and right into this place. Why is it that they are getting better service than their direct customers who make the trip to come to their restaurant for their order? I would have gotten out of the car but I had my 3 young kids with me, including a baby. My 6 year old is now complaining as we have been in the car for a total of 40 mins to pick up one order which is comprised of one entree and one salad. Completely insane.  By the way, this is probably my 5th negative experience with their curbside service but by far the worst so I finally decided to write this review for my own mental health"
Anaiis M.,"Vallejo, CA",155,1,,1.0,2/21/2016,For some reason I thought this time eating at the Cheesecake Factory won't leave me feeling sick to my stomach. The food was far from great. The banana cheesecake was on point though. The drinks were tasteless. I basically overpaid for fancy diarrhea.
Mary-Anne M.,"San Jose, CA",17,41,16,5.0,12/5/2014,"40 minutes wait on a Friday night.  Thank goodness, our servers were extremely amazing.  Thank you Fidel and Mimi.  You both rock!!!!   Very attentive, always checking up and just excellent service.  Came with special close family friends.  We ordered calamari, shrimp, avocado egg rolls, chocolate bread, chicken Madera, Kobe burger , chicken and biscuit, pizza, salad.  Very delicious in our tummy."
Natasha M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/25/2016,Delicious One of my favorite places!! Sure depends on the chef how the food lates arrivebut overall its great
Bonny L.,"San Jose, CA",21,31,108,4.0,6/21/2015,Love the big portions and cheesecakes! Drinks are good also. Like how they put new items on the menu every now and then. Sucks they don't take reservations for large parties.
Emma C.,"San Jose, CA",4,18,4,4.0,8/27/2015,"Good food and decent acoustics for a busy restaurant.  Friendly, approachable servers make sure your water is always full, that you have plenty of bread if you want it, and just take very good care of you!"
Tony W.,"San Jose, CA",0,73,1,2.0,6/2/2015,"Oh dear. Either we have grown up too much and been spoiled by such great food options in Morgan Hill or this place has gone downhill fast.  Our old favorite Spinach and Artichoke dip came with a crust on top (presumably from the heat lamps) and stale chips.  Skinnylicious salad could only be finished by King Kong.  The wine was blah too.  On reflection, we may have outgrown this fast food disguised restaurant. At least the cheesecake remains a winner. To be honest, it's the only reason we came."
Ben J.,"San Jose, CA",23,5,,1.0,11/1/2014,My first time at The Cheesecake Factory and now my last.  We sat down at 3:30pm and got our food after 4pm. People ordered got their food ate and left by the time we were eating. The server was nice and I  am guessing a manager came over. Someone needs to light a fire under someone about this.
Christine T.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/11/2016,This use to be our favorite place to go. We've never had any complaints until mid October 2016 my husband found a hair in his plate. Yuck!!
Linnea E.,"San Jose, CA",364,689,145,4.0,2/28/2014,"What makes me happy?  When i get a bartender who has been there a long time, and still knows how to make my fav drink (lemon sunburst), which was taken off the menu a couple years back.  it's yum. the wait can be really long.  like REALLY long.  but the food is good, and consistent.  portions are insanely huge.  a few of my favs:  avocado eggrolls, chinese chicken salad, pasta da vinci, steak diane.  all are excellent.  and the wheat bread... oh... it's heavenly! the cheesecake window is cool... so many choices!  i'm not really a cheesecake person.  i'm sure they're great, just not my thing."
Renata D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",69,18,,5.0,11/1/2015,"Met the new manager, Jason. when I took one of the kids out for his birthday. He was very kind. Made sure to pay compliments to the hard working servers, like Marilyn, she always does an amazing job taking care of my family when we dine here. People like Marilyn and Jason go out of their way to make sure everything is ""just right"". It is greatly appreciated. Kitchen could use improvement.  The kind of service provided Marilyn and Jason is the type of thing that makes the overall score 5 star."
Vince N.,"Renton, WA",415,781,339,2.0,7/11/2013,"I have a love hate relationship with this place. On the upside they have 900 items on the menu, something to make everyone in your party happy. On the other hand nothing on the menu really stands out and makes a statement. Every dish barely makes the mark in terms of what it should taste like. The decor is over the top and beautiful, Vegas like. The service is usually wonderful.. Except for the front lobby people. I can't stand the lack of professionalism and unorganized madness on a busy night. Our hostess was to busy checking out dudes and flirting with people to be concerned about the 100 people waiting in the lobby. Our 20 mins turned to 45 mins waiting. Not that acceptable to me. Anyhow, Cheesecake is a fail safe. Eat here and you will get consistent food, and some warm bread to munch on."
Claudia O.,"San Jose, CA",10,69,1519,4.0,7/31/2015,"All of their plates are very good, tasting, and big portions. Their services is very nice, and their cheesecakes are exquisite! Parking at this location is difficult!"
Deep S.,"San Jose, CA",508,384,3422,4.0,7/1/2011,"Chicken Samosas, what does the white man know about making Indian food?...well they got this one right.  The Chicken Samosa appetizers are mar-vio-oso.  They have that kick that most Indian foods have, and being Indian I tasted within the first bite, and dipping sauce they provide is amazing, need to get my hands on that recipe.     Almost 90% of the time I order the Steak Diane one of my personal favorites.  Yesterday ordered split of Steak and Salmon, trust me it was mouth watering, so good!!!....You can get steak and salmon served with their wonderful red skinned mashed potatoes for only $20...what a deal!   Place never seems to disappoint, great food, great service, and very clean cheesecake factory much better than the Valley Fair Location. just uploaded some more pics from my delicious meal yesterday, enjoy!"
Ang L.,"Los Gatos, CA",199,284,392,4.0,11/16/2014,"Had a Sunday lunch at The Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge.  It's one of those restaurants that the food is always consistent.  my Evelyn Pasta tasted just the same as the last couple of times that I ordered this dish.  Try the soy glazed edamame.  They also offer a Sunday brunch if you are in the mood for an omelet.  Only thing to consider if you do go, parking can be a challenge.  It's located on the busier side of the mall so plan ahead for parking if you do decide to go."
