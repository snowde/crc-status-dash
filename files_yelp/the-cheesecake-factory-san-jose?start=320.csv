Samantha D.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,3,,1.0,4/5/2016,I've had the most horrible experience here tonight. If you are having a large party I do not suggest giving your business to the cheeses casket factory at oakridge mall.   I've been planing for about a week to have a dinner for my 2 year olds birthday. I called 3 days before to see if I could make a reservation since a had a large party and I new accommodation would be tough for a party of our size. I was told no reservations were allowed unless it was during the weekdays the first hour they were open. (In my opinion a horrible rule) but whatever I dealt with it. So I arranged for my mom to get there early which was 530 pm on a Monday (I planned for everyone to arrive at dinner at 730). She put our name on the list. I called and added 3 people at 630 we were told we have to wait an additional hour. ( which we were cool with since I planned dinner at 730) by 8pm my guest who have all arrived were getting hungry and my daughter 2years old had still not been fed. So I finally asked what was taking so long the hostess ( a blond girl sorry didn't get a name) told me it was the guest fault and were taking long with the check. Come to find out it was the servers mistake and messes up the tables bill. The hostess then was totally rude  about me complaining about waiting now 2 hours cause it's 830pm. I was told they only have one table to fit a large party our size 20 . But yet the party we were waiting for was a table of 8. Which I'm sure they gave away our table to. A server then tried to get tough with my uncle who simply asked for a manager and didn't want to speak to anyone who couldn't make decisons. At this time about 845pm I decided to go down to bj's brewery and asked if they could accommodate us not only did they do so they did it with in 5 mins and we had wonderful service and my Daughter finally got to eat her birthday dinner and bj's brew house did a fantastic time job so if your in the oakridge area I'd definitely  recommend bj's over the Cheesecake Factory. Rude staff and apparently not enough room for 2 large parties
Kathleen N.,"Fremont, CA",287,193,1697,4.0,9/10/2013,"I usually don't leave reviews for large chain restaurants such as Cheesecake Factory but I must mention their new burger, Buffalo Burger, which is hands down my most favorite burger at the moment. With all these specialty burger joints popping up, I think none of them even come close to it and at a cheaper price too. Gosh, sooo good you will not regret trying it! The service here was also wonderful. There was hardly a wait and we were seated promptly on a Saturday evening. Get the burger!!!"
Derick P.,"San Jose, CA",306,191,2591,3.0,9/19/2015,The Thai lettuce wraps are really good. We also tried the buffalo chicken meatballs and they were also good. The chopped salad was not fun to brag about as it lacked any flavor even with the dressing.
Rico G.,"San Jose, CA",42,36,132,4.0,6/1/2015,"Came here for a team event, we had around 20 people. They were able to get us all in the same area of the restaurant. The service was good , and we had some questions about the bill at the very end, and they were very helpful."
Joe C.,"San Jose, CA",56,120,23,3.0,11/15/2015,It seems a bit darker then last time all those poor people and there eyes. They need to put in a bit of light. The wait is bit long but worth it . however price have changes quite a bit . you have to bring big bills if you want have an okay meal. The size of your plate out ranks your food. Add cheaper menu or options. The customer service is pretty small.
Hanita C.,"San Jose, CA",32,83,59,5.0,10/25/2014,"Had to eat at the bar because it was the World Series game and I believe home coming. The bartender, Shannon was very attentive and kind..asked us multiple times if we needed anything! Great service and great food. Thank you!"
Miriam C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,1,2.0,10/9/2016,"I went in last night to pick up an order because I was door dashing. The cashier was really rude. When I asked if my order was ready she said no and I was waiting patiently trying to make small talk with her because she looked stressed. She was however extremely rude and when I asked her if she could check on my order she threw a stapler all angry and said ""let me check"" all rude. You're working in customer service on a weekend don't expect to be slow. Maybe she needs to find a new job because she couldn't handle the stress."
Cheryl G.,"San Jose, CA",0,36,7,5.0,12/6/2014,"We came here today for lunch and the service was top notch. Honestly, we shouldn't have come. We had a fussy toddler in tow but we were already at the mall and wanted to eat out. Our toddler couldn't sit still and it would have been justified if the staff were frustrated with us for even thinking we could handle a meal out. Nope! Our waiter came out with a plate of banana and bread for our little guy before we even had a chance to place our order, smiled at him and said hello. It is really nice when the kids are seen at guests too and are not simply ignored.  Aside from that, our food was out super fast, hot and exactly as ordered. I wish I could remember our waiters name because he certainly did a great job. We will be back (hopefully at a time when we can actually enjoy our meal)"
Kayla H.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,5,2.0,4/9/2017,"WE WAITED 2 HOURS FOR OUR FOOD. Being a saturday night my boyfriend & I understood that we would have a long wait. so we waited for a table for about an hour. Then we got seated & the man who walked us over was very nice, talked to us, & mentioned it was a busy night. Then our server came over. Sweet boy about our own age (late teens early twenties), and we ordered as soon as we sat down. He brought our bread & drinks but then other people around us, seated after us, got their food. Groups of 4+ got their food, dessert, & bill before we even got our water refill. We did not get our food till closer to 9:15 after being in the restaurant since 7:30. We were not leaving until 10pm due to all of the delays. The manager did NOT come speak to us and all of the other workers avoided us. This place was my favorite restaurant & we had our first date here so we continued coming. Probably not anymore, super unsatisfied since this has happened multiple times now. 2 starts because our server was very understanding & gave us his employee discount."
Rikki Q.,"San Jose, CA",39,5,,1.0,4/25/2017,"note:  i used the door dash delivery service and was following this order closely...the mistakes were made by cheesecake not door dash... this is absolutely ridiculous!! the cheesecake factory is always messing up! first off it took them 36 minutes to make chicken and put already made soup in a cup. i was tracking the dasher in my app. at 11:11 the restaurant told her 15-20 minutes. at 11:34 they told her another 15 minutes. i asked her to check what time they got the order and they told her 11:14 (i was actually listening on the other end of the phone).... which is not true. i have the expo slip and its time stamped 11:01...meaning thats the time the to-go employee sent the order to the kitchen. my chicken was made incorrectly (with mushrooms that i am allergic to) and it was cold. not just from transportation but im guessing it was ready and the restaurant had it sitting there because they were annoyed that the dasher kept asking when it would be ready. and there was no utensils, napkins, or bread. luckily i had a fork at work but how am i supposed to eat soup with a fork? door dash is to be contacting a manager and i want that manager to call me personally. otherwise please know my next call will be to the corporate office!"
Junior O.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,,5.0,12/3/2015,They have really good food at a decent price it is also a good place to go on a date or just to hang out with your wife as well as friend I met one of the cooks there and he also was kind and courteous with a smile I believe his name is victor he is one of the reasons why I will always come back here good job victor your customer service skills were the best
Bruce S.,"San Jose, CA",44,133,168,2.0,12/14/2014,"I hate to say, but we are continuously being disappointed with this place.   We were sat at 12 and our movie doesn't start until 1:40.  Generally plenty of time to eat lunch and get to the movies in time.  We were given menus and brought water,  then our waitress disappeared for Atleast 15 minutes.   No bread brought to the table yet either.   I had two hungry kids and my wife and I were pretty hungry as well.   Finally our waitress comes back to take or order.   We finally got some bread and they brought out the soup we ordered.    The soup was ok.  It was like cream of chicken with artichokes and sun dried tomatoes.  The entrees took a while to come out as well.   We all had gone to the restroom and got back before or food even came out.  I think our food came out around 1, so we still had tons to eat and get to the movie.   I left at 2:30 to go buy tickets and waited for my wife to pay the bill.  The waitress didn't come back to settle the bill until 2:50.  They waited over 20 minutes to get the bill. We were late to the movie.  Even with all the previews we missed some of the movie.   The food maybe good but you need to have good service.   Our water glasses never got refilled either.  They are getting 2 stars only because the food was good.  Looks like management needs to have a staff meeting and do some training and shake things up."
Alec aka NY B.,"San Jose, CA",2,11,,2.0,4/15/2016,This place is so hit or miss. Proximity is decent but.... Another example of how a mall chains convenience is somewhat adequate. But always consistent in its lack of ability to provide a quality dining experience. Today it was the hostesses who were indifferent and a bit S___. If my child didn't love this place it would be a wrap. #acceptablegarbage #wearefrogsbeingslowcookedwithbadservice #igetit
Debra H.,"Morgan Hill, CA",38,48,29,3.0,6/8/2015,"Good food, however very pricey and not really a place where you want to bring little ones. It's noisy and  usually very crowded, so you may have to sit in the bar areas."
Alain A.,"Cupertino, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/8/2015,Solid! Good service and good food as always. Love the white chocolate and macadamia nut cheese cake!
Erwin R.,"Cupertino, CA",268,195,1448,4.0,7/10/2013,"I have to say Cheesecake is not really known for service but for their Cheesecake. Went to The Cheesecake factory and I have to let you guys know that Amir is the man!!  He was our server and if anyone can represent the perfect server it is Amir.  I was surprised that he not only sat us down, but he also took our orders and served us.  He exemplified the true meaning of going out of your way to provide the best customer experience!  Thank you Amir for the excellent service you provided.  Cheesecake is lucky to have you! What we ordered: -The Chicken Avocado Club with fries - Grade B (could have used more chicken) -Chicken Marasalla - Grade B+ (the sauce is really good, with the noodles and mushrooms, but can use more chicken) -Salmon B (above average) -Chicken Enchiladas - C- (Sauce was not that good and they need more chicken) -Ahi Carpaccio - B This was good but again the portion was smaller.   -Slice of Rees's Peanut Butter Cheescake A++++++ Im telling you guys, this is the absolute best cheesecake they have.  If you like Peanut butter and chocolate, you need to try a slice.  Every bit is a layer of sweet indulgence in which you would be considered crazy not too like.  From the first bite of the oh so good peanut cheescake covered with shaved chocolate on top of a very delicious crust which screams.....""eat me if you dare, after you take your first bite, you will forever be in love me!  I have to admit, I absolutely love the Reese's Peanut Butter chocolate cheesecake."
Barbara B.,"San Jose, CA",0,41,,1.0,9/19/2016,"Worst meal I have had at Cheesecake Factory.  Ordered buffalo wings..terrible! Ordered sweet potato fries, should have been called sweet potato pieces! Little pieces no real fries.  Ordered a white sangria, told they couldn't make it, seriously?  I had it here before, if it's seasonal they should say that but didn't. Service was poor at best.  I usually love Cheesecake Factory, hope it's a one time thing"
Marie J.,"San Jose, CA",189,38,107,4.0,2/10/2014,"Baby Brothers Birthday Dinner. As usual this location was jam packed. But as always we were lucky to have an awesome server who was on his game, was beyond patient while our party of 7 couldn't figure out exactly what they wanted to order. Overall the service was Great and our food was delicious, needless to say we will be back very soon!"
Miguel F.,"Saratoga, CA",103,5,,2.0,12/10/2015,"Our server forgot our main dish, as well as charged a dish to our bill that belong to us...and have us waiting over 25 minutes to clear up his mistake. overall, I think my 7th grade student could have done a better job."
Annie M.,"San Jose, CA",374,366,695,2.0,11/2/2013,"Let's just say the only reason why this place got 2 stars was cuz of their server Angela yesterday night.  We were seated on the patio within 15 minutes yesterday & given menus. Then everything went downhill... We wait 15+ minutes for someone to even come acknowledge us. We really should've just gotten up & left, but we waited & waited & waited some more. Thank goodness Angela noticed, apologized for our supposed server & took our order right away. Our supposed server never even came to see us. Our drinks & the basket of bread was dropped off at our table by Angela, but we had no utensils. Then our entrees came out & the server was all ""you guys don't have utensils!"" It's funny that our entrees came out before our appetizer as well & that we had no utensils whatsoever for a long period of time. The food was okay to be honest, I wasn't thrilled with anything at this point.  The only reason it got 2 stars was due to Angela's customer service skills, otherwise this place would get a 1 star. For all the other servers, you can acknowledge tables other than your own & then let the respective server know that his/her table is waiting to be served. Thanks Angela for trying to make things right for us.  Let's just say we won't be coming back to this CF location ever again with the lack of service we were given (minus Angela's efforts)!"
