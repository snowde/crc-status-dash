Peggy L.,"San Jose, CA",177,82,383,1.0,10/23/2015,"We were there last night and my husband ordered the Buffalo wings.  After a long day of car shopping, we were starving and started eating the appetizers.  To my surprise, our friend showed me his raw buffalo wing and when my husband looked at his, it was still pink as well.  Luckily I hadn't taken a bite yet as I am pregnant and do not want salmonella/food poisoning.  I sent the wings back after showing the server 2 wings with pink, raw meat.  Later on,  the server comes back with our same order of wings after they fry it some more....the wings were burnt black.  Additionally, he tells me that he showed his manager our buffalo wings and the manager said the wings are not raw....that the raw flesh we saw were chicken veins.  I've had a lot of chicken in my life and let me tell you,  those wings were not fully cooked.  I cannot believe the server came back to tell us we were wrong.  What happened to ""the customer is always right""?  I'm not sure if he thought I was expecting free wings or something, which clearly isn't the case.  We ended up paying for crappy undercooked and then burnt buffalo wings anyway, but point is, I wanted my food cooked correctly the first time and not die from food poisoning.   At that point, the mood for our dinner was already starting off for the worst.  My miso salmon was good but after the raw buffalo wings, I lost my appetite.   My husband ordered the chicken garlic noodles and the noodles were lacking garlic.  For the way it tasted, it should have just been called chicken with noodles.  Our friend ordered some chicken sliders, which were mediocre and nothing special.  He also got an order of mac n cheese, onion rings, and steak.  I'd say the food was pretty average and nothing special. To conclude our trip, I'd have to say that it was a waste of $130.  I am never coming back to a place that served me raw chicken and then argued that they didn't."
Yadira H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Went to dinner last night and was told it was a 30 min wait for a party of 2, got a pager and just stood right by the host table to wait. After 45 mins had gone by I asked the host how much longer only for him to say that ""they had already buzzed the pager for me by they would put me at the top of the list"" OUR PAGER NEVER BUZZED so we had to wait another 10 minutes, when we finally got seated the hostess gave us an attitude. At first we had a male server who seemed nice and we didn't want to take our frustration out on him so we gave him a chance, he got us drinks took our meal order, we waiting 40 minutes for the food to come out ONLY FOR IT TO BE THE WRONG FOOD!!!! we told them that's not what we had ordered and he came to the table to apologize and ask what we wanted to eat, it took another 20 minutes for the right food to come out. Then a server named Brooke came over to tell us she was our server but she had been on break, we finished eating and she came over to ask if we needed boxes, we said no, she left and took 15+ mins to come over to ask if we wanted the check we said yes and she took 10 mins to bring it, we put our credit card in before she left yet she still walked away and took over 10 mins more to come back and grab the card. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, it's not the first time I've been here but after last night I don't plan on ever going back."
Lily Y.,"San Jose, CA",38,40,78,3.0,3/1/2015,"I usually order the factory combination: Salmon & Steak Diane, it's rich & tender. Their mash potato is flavorful.  My friend ordered the spaghetti and he said it's OK.  However, he still preferred old spaghetti factory's spaghetti over anywhere else.  It's OK place w/ dim lighting to really set the mood. Enjoy!"
Tiffanie A.,"Los Gatos, CA",89,194,265,4.0,12/29/2014,"Been going to Cheesecake Factory ever since they opened and always liked the cheesecake, drinks, and bread.  However, I was ALWAYS disappointed with my entree in some way. Kept coming back though. The other day, I FINALLY tried an entree that was so satisfying and good, I was shocked that for once I liked an entree there!  Chicken bellagio is definitely my new go to and I won't try anything else because now I'll never be disappointed here again!  Yay!"
Mark G.,"North Valley, San Jose, CA",58,6,,5.0,8/14/2015,Had such an awesome experience here!! Got amazing food and the wait staff was awesome! We had the pleasure of having the lovely waitress Amanda attending us! She was super cool! Thanks so much for the awesome service and also remembering to do the hand gestures!!
Tanita J.,"San Jose, CA",156,116,804,5.0,8/2/2013,"The cheesecake factory has always been my favorite restaurant. Love their wide variety of choices. I always get the chicken fettuccine alfredo with sun dried tomatoes! One time I came for a to go order and it was accidentally given to someone else. The manager then gave me a complete refund and hand delivered my food to me! Even when it's busy, I tend to get seated faster at this restaurant than at any other restaurant on the Oakridge Block."
Amber M.,"Antioch, CA",26,26,28,5.0,6/9/2013,Service was great. Food arrived timely and correct. We ordered the chicken quesadilla as an appetizer and for entrees the sundried tomato basil chicken pasta and the chipotle chicken pasta.  Servings were huge and tasty! For dessert the lemon rassberry cheesecake and Chris's ultimate cheesecake.  So rich we had to take them home.  Waitress was Emerald. Super sweet and tentative. Great service
Andrea G.,"San Francisco, CA",266,236,498,4.0,8/2/2013,"I love that Cheesecake Factory has half off cheesecakes on July 30th every year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day. Which was exactly why I was there the other night.  The wait was relatively long. When we arrived, the estimated time for seating was about 40 minutes so we stood around the lobby area trying to decide beforehand what cheesecake we'd want to try. Once we sat down at the table, our server came to take our order and to let us know that it was very hectic in the bakery so our cheesecakes would take longer than usual to get to us. We decided to order two appetizers to start: the parmesan polenta fries and warm crab and artichoke dip. Both were delicious.  The parmesan polenta fries appear at first to look like mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. The outside is a golden brown crispy breading. The inside is soft, a contrast to the crunchy breading. I really thought this was a very good appetizer. Not too filling, which is perfect as a starter. The warm crab and artichoke dip was very delicious. It came with a side of toasted bread. The dip was warm and creamy and you can taste the chunks of crab and artichoke. I would definitely order this again. We wanted to save room for our cheesecake so we didn't order any entrees this time. I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which has chocolate cake, brownie, and toasted coconut pecan frosting. I love chocolate so the chocolate cake and the chewy brownie was perfect for me. And I do like coconut too, but tonight, I felt that the coconut was too overpowering in taste that it overwhelmed everything else in the cake. I felt that the coconut stood out a lot more than any other part of the cake. So if you really like a strong coconut flavor, this is the cake to order. I also had a bite of the Snicker's cheesecake and if you're a fan of Snicker's bar, this is the perfect dessert to get. I had a taste of Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake and I loved it. Half carrot cake, half cheesecake mixed together, what isn't there to love? And I also had a bite of the vanilla bean. It tasted exactly like how vanilla bean ice cream tastes like. It's plain compared to most of their other cheesecake but still delicious. Service was a little slow the night we went. But considering that many people probably went for the half off cheesecake, I can understand why. The restaurant was packed and while I was waiting in the lobby to be seated, I could see the people working in the bakery section running around trying to fulfill all the orders. Loved the food we ordered. I'll be returning again soon. And I'll for sure return next year for National Cheesecake day."
Andy H.,"Anaheim, CA",62,296,356,1.0,12/19/2015,"I love so many dishes and cheesecakes that Cheesecake Factory has to offer, so I come here pretty often. However, the last few times that I've came to this location I've had unpleasant experiences. A little over a month ago our late night server decided to close our check out and not give us the opportunity to order refills on our cocktails prior to the bar closing. Same thing with dessert, which really devastated us since that's one of the main reasons why we come here. We were not given a heads up that the registers where the cheesecakes are at, were being closed down. The server didn't apologize or seem to care when we brought up our concern. Our party left very unhappy, but we decided to overlook it and we ended up coming back 2 weeks later. During this visit, we checked in with the hostess for a party of 4. We were told it would only be 10 to 15 mins. Eventually 30 mins went by and we noticed that groups both larger and smaller, that came after us were being seated. As soon as we asked the hostess why we hadn't been seated and why others that came after we're seated, we were then walked over to our table. I am not sure how we were skipped since we had a ""pager"", but we were just glad to finally be seated. Now during our most recent experience last night, we left unsatisfied. The food for each person of our party of 4 came out at different times, with at least 5 to 10 mins gaps in between each meal being brought out. Which we found strange since it was later in the evening when the restaurant was slow. Everyone's food was either cold or luke warm. The mashed potatoes were so salty we could not eat them. The server was very apologetic and sweet and offered to rectify the issue. The manager came out to apologize and gave us some cheesecakes on the house due to our unpleasant experiences. We got our cheesecakes to go and asked for my cheesecake to be bagged individually, since I don't live with the 3 other people in my party. I took the bag home that I was told contained my cheesecake and put it in the fridge. Today when I got home from work, I was ready to eat my cheesecake just today find out that the server bagged the left over pasta from someone else in my party, instead of my cheesecake. I am beyond frustrated. Bottom line is, none of these issues should have occurred and there is no explanation to them. These last few visits have left a bad taste in our mouth and we definitely will not be returning to this location even though it is much more convenient for us. We will start going back to Valley Fair. After reading all the other bad reviews, I am confident this is the best choice."
Duc N.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,10,1.0,8/22/2015,"Horrible service, discriminate customers.  I work for a delivery service in this area, so I do pick up food from here from time to time. They always seem to prioritize ""normal customers"" over us ""delivery guys"" even though we do pay at the counter to get our food. They often just left me standing there and left to do some other stuff. One time they even help another customer that just cut in from of me. I do know that it can get busy there and the service can be slow at times, but i just cannot stand the discrimination these people have on me and other delivery services workers. We do pay to get our food, so treat us like what we deserve."
Matthew M.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,11,,2.0,2/17/2016,"Only takes reservations for 'lunch time', which is between 11.30am and 12.00pm, for parties of 7 or larger. Talk about useless, why they even bother mentioning it on this page is beyond me. 2 stars is for the food being standard for a cheese cake factory."
Ivan S.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/28/2015,"Horrible service, waiters did not know who had our table. Instead of attending to the customer, they decided to deny whos table it was. Get your shit together.  40 min wait, no service at all."
Jennifer C.,"Gilroy, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/18/2016,"I would love to come here and have tried twice now, driving from Gilroy, to eat at The Cheesecake Factory unsuccessfully. Parking at Oakridge Mall is HORRENDOUS. Today I let my daughter out to wait for a table while I drove around for another 10 minutes to find a place to park. She was seated and ended up having to tell the server she was sorry because we couldn't stay due to the fact that I could not find a parking space. I would have elected for valet, but unfortunately didn't have cash on me. Will not be coming back until Westfield figures out their parking situation."
Anna S.,"San Jose, CA",6,27,12,4.0,3/1/2016,"We came here on the 27th to celebrate my moms birthday and everything but the smell was great. Our waiter was Sierra and she was so sweet. My family can be demanding without realizing it and she would just smile and move to the next. She's great at what she does, wonderful customer service. The food was great too. I had something to eat we came so I had to get a box.  They sang happy birthday and then we left. Btw we were outside. So there was a rotten egg smell. Pass byers kept saying sewer. Not sure though"
Chris G.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,20,,5.0,9/16/2016,Went here for a family event with 6 of us on a Friday night at 5:00.  Got right in and our server was Nate.  I can not overstate how awesome of service we got.  Plenty of bread right away and my soda never went dry.  The chicken madera was perfect and the kids loved the Godiva cheesecake.  In a time where service sucks pretty much everywhere this was a pleasant experience.
John C.,"San Ramon, CA",487,6,437,5.0,8/16/2015,"Great Service!!!!!   Ask for their ""Nutritional Guide"" and you will notice almost everything has SOOOOOOOOOO Much CALORIES!!!!!  No Joke....I recommend ordering off their ""Skinnylicious Menu"" if you're into eating healthy and staying slim"
Paul H.,"Seaside, CA",0,4,2,4.0,4/25/2015,"This is our second visit to San Jose Cheesecake Factory!   FLASHBACK TO DEC 2014:  - First was with our family of 10. Fast-Forward back to APR 2015: - Our server Maggie is outstanding and very professional.  She increases the pleasent experience! PH had the 4 Cheese Pasta with Chicken:  - deliscious, flavorful, savory....very enjoyable! MH had the Cobb Dinner Salad with Ranch (SJCF made): - large portion with appropriate amount of dressing....deliscious & very enjoyable! Both dishes are worthy of a second selection (future). And now for dessert: MH is having the the Warm Apple Crisp!   -AWESOMENESS in a dish! PH is having the Lemoncello Torte! - AWESOMENESS in a dish! 4 out of 5 stars!  (Maggie earned SJCF the 4th Star!) MH & PH on another edible adventure in CA!  Stay tuned for our next upcoming adventure!"
Gina T.,"San Jose, CA",55,114,480,3.0,11/11/2014,"Came here to celebrate my hubby's and daughter's B-Day.   We didn't expect it will be that busy.   We waited for twenty minutes,  not bad for Veterans day.   Our server is friendly enough but forgetful (mentioned that I'm here with two birthdays but he brought the bill out).   The food today is not that spectacular compared to my previous visits.   Ordered the Cajun Jambalaya but the vegetables seemed to be over cooked and burnt.   The chicken Chipotle is too sweet and buttery.   Anyhow we liked the factory nachos.  It is still my favorite place to go for special event."
Ruey T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",111,10,10,1.0,9/28/2015,"Waited approximately 10 minutes before anyone even spoke to us about being seated...not a good start to begin with...   The host that was in charge was a tall Asian guy with black plastic framed glasses; not wanting to be rude, my friend and I had been patiently waiting to be spoken to but he proceeded to speak to two other parties that had arrived after us before noticing we were even there and seemed like he had better things to do rather than help us find a table.  There seemed to be a plethora of hosts behind the stand so there was really no excuse for the wait we experienced.   We waited 15 minutes for our table.  After being seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so before our waitress got a chance to speak with us...she's the only reason we decided to stay because she was extremely apologetic, courteous and sweet.  My friend's cocktail arrived promptly, we waited a little for bread and about 15 minutes for the water I had asked for, which was never refilled.   Food seem to arrive in a timely manner but our appetizers arrived after our food.  The avocado egg rolls we had ordered looked haphazardly put together but otherwise tasted great (they're one of my favorite things on the menu and I always order them).  My companion had ordered a caesar salad with stale croutons and grilled chicken that had been pulverized and was completely inedible...like chewing on a hand-towel...literally.  My kobe burger that i had ordered rare came back extremely well donel and completely burnt on the outside...the mushrooms and onions weren't just caramelized but also completely charred.   On top of the unsatisfactory experience (our waitress was still great but there's only so much she can do if everything else sucks), there were about 10 employee guys just chillin' at the host stand that could have been helping with the shortcomings we, and I'm sure other customers, were experiencing.  I also wait tables and the restaurant was far from being busy...and even if they were busy, there never should be a reason to warrant the mess of service and food quality that we experienced.   The worst experience I've had eating at a Cheesecake Factory..."
Chef Laura A.,"San Francisco, CA",24,100,6,1.0,11/23/2015,"Jason sent us a $25 dollar gift certificate...gave it away. Didn't make up for the terrible experience we had. The Steak Diane and burnt prawn dinner was a lot more than $25!!!  My family was so excited about the Cheesecake Factory, but not anymore...we will never go there again. I'm a chef Jason and this is poor business practice on every level.  Chef L This review is for Jason the manager and the experience we had about a month and a half ago. Talk is cheap.  Excuses are boring Jason. Had relatives visiting about a month ago and took them to the Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge Mall. HUGE MISTAKE... Super long wait. There were 7 of us. It took quite a while to order.  Ordered prawn dinner (came out burnt however they served if to us anyway?!?), hibachi steak dinner (came out okay), steak Diane med-rare with a pepper sauce (came well done and super chewy, served it to us anyway), the kids ordered kid dishes and we're happy.  Told the waiter we weren't happy and she said she'd have to check with her boss to see if if was okay to redo them (REALLY?!?).  By the time our food was brought back we were tired and asked that they package it to go.  Everyone else was finished eating and wanted to leave.  Called the next day and spoke to Jason the manager.  Jason assured me he'd take care of us no problem with a gift certificate.  However when I went in to get the gift certificate Jason said they don't do that?!?  What are you talking about Jason...you screwed up.  He offered me a dessert for the horrible steak dinner and prawn dinner....  You took my money and even forgot to return our credit card.  I'm sorry Jason but you've lost my business. Regards, Private Culinary Chef L Avila.  Ps. The artichokes were hard and inedible. The entire experience was truly a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I'll never grace their door way again. I'd rather eat at Five Guys right down the road on Blossom Hill and Almaden. They are fantastic.  Love the fact that they don't use canola oil!!!  Ps.s., Still waiting for a response...haven't even gotten a rebut. That was a completely crappy experience!"
