Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",55,61,19,4.0,11/15/2013,"This would be my 4th Cheesecake Factory that I've been to. Its not nearly as packed and rowdy as the one in Honolulu or in San Diego, but still fills up later in the evening.   Service: I went for my birthday, knowing that they didn't take reservations, and had to wait to find out how long the wait would be for a party of 9. With this in mind, the manager was very speedy to get me a table, took about a 30 min wait overall which wasn't bad. The waiter was very amiable and pretty patient knowing that my party was trickling in (very slowly due to parking at the mall) and kept a pretty watchful eye on my drinks.  Food: What can I say, Cheesecake Factory always delivers on this. It took a while for the food to come out, and it was a little disappointing considering it wasn't fully packed. other than that though, I got my bday wish + a corny song when my pumpkin pecan cheesecake came out. It was great. Price: Be prepared to spend some bills if you are going to have a dinner with a few people. For myself plus my wife and daughter with one appetizer and 3 meals plus desserts came to a little over $100. It's worth the price, but not for regular weekends out. More of a special occasion location for me."
C.D. R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,38,14,2.0,10/19/2014,This is a review not so much of this specific establishment but of the Cheesecake Factory as a whole. I've never been a fan. When I come here I always feel like it's where the ghetto comes to feel fancy or where high school kids bring their dates. The menu is extensive but nothing ever sticks out as a must-have. I always end up ordering from their appetizer menu because those dishes sound and taste better than their entrees. Personal favorites are the Asian Lettuce Chicken Tacos and the samosas. Also the fried chicken sliders. Cheesecake is their specialty so their cheesecake menu is extensive and all of the kinds I've had are very good. Personal favorite is the banana cream.

Kayla B.,"Santa Clara, CA",83,8,5,2.0,9/12/2015,They really disappointed me on my Birthday last night. Went there with a party of 9 (they do not take reservations). They said the wait was 3 Hours!!!!! DO NOT GO WITH LARGE PARTIES! unless you want to go there 3 hours in advance to put your name down.
Reena P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",118,231,79,1.0,5/4/2014,"Why is there terrible customer service at 10 pm and 50% capacity? Came here late on a Friday night. We waited about 10 minutes and were seated in the bar area. Our server plopped us down with no pleasantries and gave us our menus. When she came back to get our drink orders we didn't even have water or bread. We had to ask for water and then proceeded to order when she finally came back the next time.  Our order consisted of one diet coke, edamame and fire roasted chile rellenos. The chile rellenos came first and it was pretty good. The edamame proceeded and was plopped down by our server.  As the plopping occurred she said, 'soy sauce.' We said, 'huh?' Again, she said, 'soy sauce' and we said, 'huh.' After the second 'soy sauce' we realized she was asking if we wanted some with our edamame. She wasn't very pleasant and seemed to be having a bad day. Would it have killed her to say, 'Would you like some soy sauce?' At least we would've been able to understand her.... nonetheless we said yes.  Fast forward 10 minutes and the edamame was almost gone and we still didn't have any soy sauce. We kept seeing her walk by but couldn't get her attention even if our life depended on it. Eventually we wrangled her to our table and got our soy sauce.  Once we were done eating I wanted to order cheesecake, but was dreading having to track her down for a menu. We got another server to bring us the menu and then we got yet another server to take our order. In all that time, our server NEVER came to our table to see how our meal was or to ask if we wanted dessert! Overall, terrible customer service. It seems as though they have too many people working at the restaurant because instead of providing excellent, or even mediocre, service they have time to socialize/flirt with each other. Managers need to step up and make sure their employees are meeting expectations.   CUSTOMERS COME BACK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WILL PASS ON A PLACE IF THE FOOD IS GOOD BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR."
Olivia E.,"Daly City, CA",22,9,4,3.0,1/30/2016,"Every time I return it gets worse. You have to grab or yell at a host to get their attention and she was mad because it took us a whole 60 seconds to get to the front from the seating just outside the door from in the mall, she told us ""we already called for you."" and the food is just going downhill. The lights got dimmed after we were in there and it was so dark I got dizzy trying to focus on the table. They changed their fish taco recipe from something that was amazing for years into a joke. Now it's basically fish sticks on top of pico and guacamole. At least our server was nice."
Randy J.,"San Jose, CA",53,71,7,3.0,5/25/2015,I'm really torn with this one. The taste and quality of the food is usually really good. BUT it is so unhealthy to eat at this place I can't really endorse it for anything more than an absolute splurge.
Shawna N.,"San Jose, CA",7,40,10,1.0,12/4/2015,Super slow service. Food was decent but we waited for 20 mins just to get the bill. Too long!
BabyVivian E.,"Cupertino, CA",16,9,2,1.0,1/26/2016,"The cheesecake factory has a wide variety of dishes, as most of us know. However something you may not know Is that the service at the Oakridge mall, blossom hill location, could go down as the worst service I have ever recived. I made the mistake of trying to order food hear for take out.  It's as simple as this the order was wrong and it wasn't the first time this had happend to me. I kindly told the lady behind the counter about the error and I was presented with a new total for the order I had placed over an hour ago and already purchased. I then spoke to a manager who ensured me the missing bugger would be out in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I was given my food. I had waited a total of 2 hours for my food, during a night with no wait in the restraunt. The manager then offered to give me a free peice of cheese cake to compensate me. (Which is extremely insulting to me that an hour of my time is only worth a $4 slice of cake) I finally got home and the order was still wrong and all my food was cold except for the mistake burger.  Over all the food is not worth dealing with the in professional, insulting, careless staff. Avoid the cheesecake factory take out at all costs!!"
Mitch M.,"San Jose, CA",7,147,47,5.0,6/21/2014,Wow...we have two kids and we still love coming here.  The staff is attentive.  Bathrooms are clean as well...A plus in a restaurant. Spicey cashew chicken...I get it EVERY time and it is ALWAYS.  Enough to keep me coming back again and again.
Jack P.,"Campbell, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/22/2016,"Came here for husband's Birthday I decided on: EVELYN'S FAVORITE PASTA Description:  Rigatoni Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Mushroom, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Onion, Garlic and Pine Nuts. Asked if I could sub angel hair pasta for rigatoni. Order arrives: Angel hair pasta with two pieces of broccoli chopped up in six pieces.  Seriously?  Is it called Evelyn's Fav. pasta because Evelyn owns C.F. and the reason this is her fav. pasta is because it's a bait and switch move? Called the waitress over immediately who had the Manager come by.  Manager had a sarcastic look/smile on his face and seemed unimpressed by being at the table!  No apology or explanation for the 'bait and switch' move when I pointed to the plate of JUST pasta with a couple of chopped up pieces of broccoli.  Did my veggies mysteriously disappear on their way out front the kitchen to our table?   C.F. Either have your description fit the plate or the plate fit the description.   And if you fail to do either, then have proper management to handle the issue professionally!!!"
Sandy T.,"San Jose, CA",0,22,,4.0,2/7/2016,"Love the food, service and ambience.  Not happy when the take away my favorite dishes."
Vivian H.,"Los Gatos, CA",1636,364,940,4.0,8/1/2012,"my boyfriend and i came here for his birthday around 830pm. and the wait was STILL 45 minutes long. sigh. we didnt make a reservation, though, so i guess that was why. We put down our names and we got a buzzer, but we didnt want to stay in the restaurant so we asked if we could just walk around the mall for half hour and come back. and they said yes! When we came back, they still didnt have a table for us, but we were able to snag a half cleaned bar table to sit on. Two middle age ladies came by and asked if they could share the table with us to sit and we said yes. After the waiter cleaned the table up, they asked if we wanted to order anything! (i guess we just had to find an empty table to get served??) We said no and let the ladies order and perfect timing! bc the hostess called our name. we got seated in the patio outside next to the heater. We got chicken and biscuits and a strawberry creamsicle for later. Boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits before and told me it was HUGE and a whopping 2000 calorie dish! better share that. and boy he was right. it came fresh and hot. Chicken was very tender and the biscuits were soft and warn, vegetables were tasty, and the gravy was creamy and delicious. We shared it, and we STILL had leftovers! (it might be because we also ate the bread basket...? hahaha) the dish was at most 17 dollars? so it was a cheap meal for two people. We were very stuffed, so we didnt get a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake slice, which ive had before and is VERY VERY good.  The servers here are very helpful and the ambiance is very classy. Will come back later!!!!"
Michele M.,"San Jose, CA",21,94,8,4.0,5/23/2014,"Been coming here so long, I can't imagine why I never yelped this place...you must know the menu here is extensive, and they now have skinny selections (if you like that sort of thing) I have three great loves here  1) Chicken Madeira - Mashed potatoes and asparagus accompany a perfect breast of chicken with a tasty Madeira sauce. 2) Steak Diane- One word - Delicious 3) Pineapple upside down cheesecake.  I have had several of appetizers here that have been great- fried mac-n-cheese balls is the first that comes to mind. I usually have the same thing but am not too shy to ask for a taste of the hubby's plate too!"
James A.,"San Jose, CA",92,18,3,3.0,7/22/2014,"Let me start off with,I never leave yelp reviews but I couldn't believe what happened so I felt inclined to  I work up the street from this Cheesecake Factory and have had a few problems in the past with my orders being wrong,but today I'm going to just assume it wasn't my day?  I only get an hour lunch which is usually more than enough time to call in my order,usually I call and by the time I arrive my food is ready and I can head back to work  I called to try to call in my order and was placed on hold which I understand...but I definitely do not understand why I was hold on 12min...the reason why it was only 12min was because by the time I got there no one picked up the phone. I understand sometimes people forget to transfer a call or forgets to let that other person there's someone on the line,but not when I call twice,Kaitlin even remembered me from when I called a few minutes prior.  The nice girl behind the reg at the bakery took my order promptly and apologized for everything which made everything better,just don't understand the wait for the call which took a decent chunk of my lunch,waiting on hold+then having to wait for my food"
Jiyea C.,"Boston, MA",170,393,655,3.0,7/31/2012,"Just stick to making cheesecake. Seriously. The food is overpriced and mediocre. I think the only good food entree I've had here over the years in locations across the country is the guacamole. Everything else is whatever.  Ok fine, I have enjoyed some of their cocktails (mojitos!), but they are overpriced like everything else. Sometime's they're stronger and sometimes they're not. Still, they're worth a mention because alcohol is overpriced at most establishments. I was just at a location in Boston for Cheesecake Day (July 30 2012) and their tiramisu cheesecake did not disappoint! And on Cheesecake Day, all their cheesecakes are 1/2 off for dine-in customers, yay! (It's the only reason I went there yesterday, haha.) Service is generally pretty good."
Amir A.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,236,3.0,10/26/2014,I love this place though I hate waiting. Every Time I have to wait 15-40 minutes to sit. They do not take reservations. I gave 3 star so they respect others time.
Erin T.,"San Jose, CA",4,124,17,1.0,10/24/2015,Got food poisoning from their ahi salad on Friday. Spent Friday and Saturday vomiting (in addition to other symptoms). Will never go there again.
Jason M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/1/2016,Slow to get seated even though lots of open tables. Many wait staff standing around chit chatting and not working while patrons are waiting in the lobby.
Niki T.,"San Jose, CA",14,103,56,3.0,2/27/2013,Wait is always long. Yo always get a good amount of food and the selection of cheesecake is endless.  Cons: Birthdays... you get a little tiny shot glass of ice cream :/ That needs to change!!
