P D.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,7,1.0,11/29/2015,"What a 360 from last time. Very very bad service...i am not coming back. We were welcome with bread as usual, but the bread was not warm, that was just the  start, appetizers  were ordered and waiting  to  decide  on main course decision,  we r vegetarian,  so we were making sure, no fish or oyster  sauce in any of our course. Appetizers Mac &  cheese  balls, avocado mushroom zuccini fries. Eggplant parmesean. ..etc All were served at once, cold, badly prepared, burnt and served badly. We did not finish the dinner..we got out and want to complain. Manager James. .heard all abou it. All he has to say was sorry look me up next time. Sorry there won't  be  next time."
Amarjit B.,"San Jose, CA",55,27,10,3.0,10/31/2014,"Underimpressed. What you expect from CCF is a solid chain restaurant dining. Staple decor, token lightning and semi-comfortable booths. Food should be ok, you wouldn't expect it to bring you to cloud 9. greasy and way too heavy, samosa dripping with oil. portion sizes are enormous, one entrees good for 2. 3 star, not impressed. Will try the cheese cakes next time."
Kathy T.,"San Jose, CA",46,17,5,1.0,7/28/2015,"I like the food and desserts but after horrid front desk service tonight I won't be back.  After being told the wait was 15 minutes I waited 35 minutes.  I asked about the wait and was told I was going to be seated next, just to watch 6 other parties seated before me.  Not cool!!"
Brad T.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/17/2016,Asked for my burger well done came out very very pink .. never will I get a burger from here again . Previous time before that I came with my family asked for a to go box and the lady threw my food away n the best way she could fix it was asked if I wanted fries when I payed for an 18$ salmon plate Smh if it was possible I wouldn't even give them one star
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, CA",0,1740,1,3.0,10/20/2014,"Came here early on a Saturday night.  Shopping mall parking was tough.  Already a 20 minute wait.  What a popular place.  Fortunately, the place is huge and they can serve a lot of customers.   Cheesecake Factory's décor seems like something right out of Vegas - huge and over the top.  Our service was excellent.  The menu is huge.  The warm bread they serve to start is wonderful.  My meatloaf was ok.  I didn't think too much of the sauce.  The corn and squash succotash was very tasty and the mashed potatoes was only ok because I didn't like the meat sauce.  My blueberry cheesecake was fabulous.   It's a fun atmosphere and a bit dark inside.  Big portions."
Keith E.,"San Jose, CA",38,93,38,5.0,4/20/2015,Had a great time while dining here. Came for brunch after church with a couple friends. The mimosas weren't watered down and the food came out piping hot. The waitress did a great job making sure all our needs were met.  Will definitely come back again.
A Z.,"Hollister, CA",45,133,151,4.0,6/18/2013,"I've been here quite a few times, I love their sandwiches and burgers!   The Caesar salad is also good.  The French fries on the other hand are average and not very good.... Service is generally OK, but not great."
Andrew P.,"San Jose, CA",4,3,,2.0,11/5/2015,"I'm never greeted properly whenever my family comes here and our servers are inattentive from taking orders to refilling drinks. Restaurants have a rush, I get it, but how come I'm not treated this poorly anywhere else l? Sub par representatives of the chain"
Tina N.,"San Jose, CA",0,37,15,4.0,1/7/2016,Large portions and variety of food. Great place to watch the game or when coming in large groups. Food is good but you really come here for the desserts!!!!! Try the red velvet cheesecake.....sugar coma but worth it!!!
Heather A.,"San Jose, CA",104,128,35,4.0,7/3/2014,"Normally I like to support small businesses by dining there over chain restaurants, but I had a gift card so my fiancé and I decided to come here for date night.   We came in on a Friday night and waited about 20 minutes for a table. The place was packed with many people standing around waiting for a table. There was a mixture of people, older folks, teens, and families.  We ordered a margarita and shared it.  It was delicious and made just right. Then we got buffalo wings as an appetizer, they were crispy and full of flavor. We both ordered pasta dishes which were excellent. Fiancé ordered Louisiana jambalaya which was amazing. It has chicken and shrimp and was a little spicy and full of flavor. I had the Farfalle pasta which was also pretty good. It tasted a lot like a carbonera.  Good food and good service. A solid 4 stars."
Clarissa Y.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",952,806,992,5.0,6/19/2012,"I have only been here once when I was maybe 11 or 12. The Cheesecake Factory of San Jose only exists to me as a faint memory from 9 years ago and has become almost like one of those amazing dreams that you just cannot get back into. One day, I will take public transportation all the way from Union City just to savour the delicious morsels of food The Cheesecake Factory has to offer again. Ambiance: It has the decor of a classy restaurant and is the perfect place to take a date! I say that when it comes to the dress code, although you wouldn't get turned away for wearing sweatpants you might want to chuck on your Sunday best. Customer Service: Brilliant! The waiter was polite and courteous plus the food came out at reasonable times. Professional, quality service. Food: Even though The Cheesecake Factory looks like it will burn a hole in your wallet, the prices are actually pretty reasonable and standard - nothing different to say your neighbourhood Applebee's. Plus, the food is so AMAZING that it is worth it! I remember ordering a heavenly Smoked Salmon Bagel and I have never enjoyed a bagel more in my life. My dad dug into his Lamb Chops like it was sweet nectar from the gods themselves. Maybe that's the secret of The Cheesecake Factory - they just have stocks and stocks of ambrosia they drip onto all of their meals. Clever bastards, but whatever it is - that faint memory has been a lasting craving for the past 9 years."
Chris S.,"Milpitas, CA",1,10,,1.0,2/13/2016,"I just called there and asked for a reservation . ""Eric"" who answered  the phone said no reservations on the weekend. I remarked that the website said you do. He rudely said "" NO RESERVATIONS."" Thanks Eric I will take my business to McDonalds, they're nicer."
Alice B.,"Cupertino, CA",0,48,,4.0,1/14/2016,"Just there last night and the waitress was fantastic! She was very friendly , checked in on is often and even joked around. A few weeks ago we had an overly burnt pizza and asked for a new one. No questions asked, the manager came over and took care of it. We were offered fries while we waited. Love there strawberry lemonade. Would go back."
Nate A.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2014,"If you love waiting in line at the DMV, you'll love this place! I only had to wait 10 minutes to get a $9.81 shot of Jack at the bar! Our appetizer arrived within seconds before our main course, only an hour after we ordered it! Sure, we never did receive the fries that we ordered, but at least they gave us two free pieces of cheesecake for the four people at our table!  This place might be a little more expensive than the DMV, but their service is right on par! One star!"
Adrian A.,"San Jose, CA",18,108,7,2.0,3/26/2014,"I got the Chicken stuffed tortilla, Meh and Eh ...Not sure why this place is so packed, Maybe it's a suburban thing. Being a New Yorker I HAD to try the cheesecake, and if your name is ""cheesecake factory"" You better make some damn good Cheesecake...They don't.  If you had GOOD cheesecake in NYC(or dare I say...Chitcago..oops, Chicago..*gags*) Then you will know that it doesn't come out cold, doesn't come out warm. The cheesecake here came out a bit too warm(almost room temperature). It also didn't have the firmness that the good stuff has, and doesn't melt in your mouth like it should. The graham cracker crust is so thin, it's almost non existent, not thick like it should be to hold all the yummy goodness that is sweetened cream cheese.  So you get one star for making my homesickness relieve it's self a bit. The chicken stuffed tortilla...Eh, can't taste the chicken, but you can taste everything else...Had enough flavor, but doesn't hit the spot..Then again I ordered Mexican food at a suburban white persons establishment , you can find better from a taco stand. Will I ever step foot in a cheesecake factory again? Hell no, price doesn't justify it. Thank god it was my GF's sisters birthday or I would do Operation walk out(of course, leaving a tip for the very friendly waiter) However, I know my review wont do diddly squat to their business because people like the place for some unknown reason...So I just killed time at 4 am instead and wrote this silly piece of propaganda. P.S they dilute their sodas 3 parts ice 1 part soda. You will ask for a bunch of refills. One more P.S, they play some nice ""date night"" music, however, it's so insanely loud in the place, it's almost pointless."
Lorianne L.,"San Jose, CA",184,496,4524,4.0,12/22/2012,"A couple of gals and I met up for a late night snack the other day.  One had the dutch apple cheesecake, and the other had Adam's peanut butter cheesecake.  My taste buds decided they wanted salty, so I had the ahi tartare appetizer.  Service was fine, and we enjoyed our treats.  Both of my friends took home half of their cheesecakes."
Cristofer U.,"San Jose, CA",81,8,2,1.0,1/4/2016,"Went to order barbecue ranch chicken salad (replaced it with salmon) and asked for extra salmon. Of course payed extra. It was a pick-up, cheesecake usually executes it on time. The portion of the salad (vegetables) was delightful, but the salmon (one slice!) was half the length of a dollar bill and had a thickness of 3 stacked quarters (coins). Not enough ""meat/fish/chicken"" etc. Size of the tray is about 10"" x 10''. The service was fine. Great taste of food! Yet disappointed on the portions."
Jane R.,"Los Altos, CA",77,345,7,3.0,8/12/2014,"My adult son suggested taking me to this well-known restaurant for dinner.  It was busy but we didn't have to wait as we chose to eat in the bar area.  Our service was somewhat spotty and missing.  The food was good but not great.  My son's pasta was very salty and my tacos were bland.  At least the portions were good, but what's the point when you're not enjoying the food? Sigh....they used to be a good place with really good food.  Now it seems like just another chain."
Jesse S.,"Little Elm, TX",108,782,26,3.0,12/16/2012,"This review is for the Sunday brunch. I never thought to come here for breakfast, but apparently on page 18 of their menu is a breakfast selection! I had the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes and syrup were good. The coffee is excellent, although the waitress didn't refill it. I also tried the hash brown potatoes. They were well seasoned but burned-black on the outside and undercooked inside, and dripping with oil.  Service was OK but inattentive considering we were the only table in this waitress' section."
Hari P.,"Concord, CA",7,81,23,2.0,5/27/2014,"We came back after a horrible service experience three weeks ago. This time we got a better server in Robert L! However, our  horrible server from last time threw the bread and waters at our tables! Why does bad servers still work here? What is the restaurant manager doing???? The bar area server that was horrible at service last time stopped by to remind us that she is working there for ten years. That's great, but if she keeps this crap I don't she her lasting through this year. The food her is good, however, the service is horrible!!!! We won't be returning any time soon! Two stars because of Robert, otherwise, negative stars!"
