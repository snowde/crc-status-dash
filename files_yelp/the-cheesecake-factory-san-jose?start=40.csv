Leanne Z.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,2.0,1/1/2018,12/31/17 approx 2pm. Told us a 5 minute wait then seated 3 people that came in after us right away. I tried waiting patiently and finally spoke up. Then we were seated once I said something. Took an additional 10-15 min for a server to come by and acknowledge us. Not impressed. It was not very busy at all. We almost walked out but my 9 year old was very hungry and insisted we stayed. I will give a positive that the server was good and so was the food.
A L.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,1,2.0,12/29/2017,"Food is ok but service is always terrible.  I think some fast food restaurants provide a more relaxed experience.  My Long Island today came after a 20 min wait at the table and had a bottle label floating in it.  Am I gonna die from this, no but wtf .... how did this pass three hands and no one noticed this huge piece of paper in my drink.  Just not worth the wait and extremely poor service.  The only reason why I go is bc I get gift cards."
Jensine D.,"East San Jose, San Jose, CA",18,44,16,2.0,8/29/2017,"I bought a cheese cake here last week for Togo on Thursday or Friday. We had asked for a slice of caramel pecan & an extra cup of whip cream through the cashier girl who was friendly. Thinking back, the guy worker who brought us our slice was very fast. Perhaps it was another persons order. Anyway, I spread out my cheese cake with a few bites a day because it's too sweet. I realized after almost finishing that I never had a bite of caramel or pecan. I don't even know what slice I've received. Very disappointing...."
Astrid T.,"San Jose, CA",7,6,1,2.0,11/18/2017,"Such a well known chain where they seem to not care about good service but just about the money. We came in and while looking at the menu asked the front staff if they had nachos, we were told to go to the bakery and check because the guy ""didn't know the whole menu"". Unfortunately we decide to stay, the nachos were salty and greasy, not good quality but our bad for asking for such a dish in such restaurant... at the end we decided to take a cheesecake to go and Jesus (our bartender) asked us if we were ""going to order or not"" just because we were trying to decide which kind of cheesecake. He is rude impolite and unprofessional. Definitely a way too expensive place for such a bad service, dirty floors, greasy menus and overall no care of how customers feel."
Christine P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",20,93,42,5.0,1/4/2017,"I came here on New Year's Eve with my little brother right when they opened. David was my server and right off the bat he made a good impression. He was so friendly and full of energy I loved it ! I ordered the pasta and he even came back to ask whether or not I wanted lunch or dinner pasta , which i said dinner haha. I even heard him talking to the table next to ours and  joking wih them. He definitely had a really outgoing personality . He consistently came n checked on us to ensure we have everything that we needed. Overall, our experience was perfect due to his service .  Thanks David !"
Nick B.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,1.0,7/27/2017,"Like to sit in bar area to avoid screaming brats; but parents are taking them into bar area to avoid listening to other brats. Yesterday a mother with two screaming brats was sitting at the bar and letting them run around like they were at the circus. Can't this area be adults only? The restaurant wasn't busy, so there was plenty of room."
Dave Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,8,5.0,11/21/2017,Darren is the most professional bartender I have ever seen. Keeps me coming back. Fidel the newest edition to the bartender staff. Great job! Thanks Fidel
Tawni T.,"San Jose, CA",31,52,81,1.0,7/16/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants and I hate that I have to write a bad review, but after my experience today they deserve more than just a 1 star review. Never will I step foot into this Cheesecake Factory again, I'll just drive an extra few miles to the Valley fair location.  After being seated we ordered our food and drinks right away because we already knew what we wanted and we were starving.. it took about 45 minutes for our food to come out.. no one came back to check on us or to let us know why our food was being delayed because other parties that arrived 15/20 mins after us all got their food before us... on top of that, our water was only refilled once, our cup of water was empty half the time we were there.  This Cheesecake Factory location has terrible customer service, I advise you to go elsewhere or a different Cheesecake location if you want to enjoy your meal with better customer service."
Dash Duo D.,"Citrus Heights, CA",97,34,312,5.0,12/9/2016,they are super fast super friendly and the chick in the background was so on point with everything .

Diana M.,"San Jose, CA",696,288,179,2.0,12/4/2016,My experience is very different from that of my yelper friends. The customer service was GREAT because my server Lisa was super sweet and attentive BUT the food was meh. I had the Goat Cheese and Beets salad and lunch sized Meat Loaf. The Goat Cheese and Beets was flavorful and delicious but the size was teeny for the price. The Meat Loaf with Mash Potatoes and Corn was not good at all. The meat was wayyyyy to salty and the potatoes were extremely cold. I was hoping my Reese's cheesecake would make up for it but it did not. The amount of sugar was deadly. After 3 bites I had a sugar coma. In conclusion...my meal was not worth the insane price. Now I remember why I don't frequent this restaurant more than once every few years.
Sal P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",304,339,575,2.0,7/28/2017,"Food was ok  The service sucks so bad that our food took forever I dont think it was the servers falt I want to blaime the cook for not cooking our food right,i will not return"
Or D.,"San Jose, CA",67,32,30,4.0,8/30/2017,"Good food, fast service  Great value for money  Only thing is that u usually have to wait a lot to be seated"
laura l.,"Campbell, CA",0,14,,5.0,11/16/2017,"Great service, delish, delish, delish,   yummy yummy and  smiles to go with my yummy!!"
GM A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,82,1,1.0,10/29/2017,I do not understand why this place is always full.  Food and services are mediocre and the bathroom is always beyond gross.
Karla C.,"Natick, MA",0,30,5,2.0,6/21/2017,"Stopped here on Monday for a late lunch/early dinner with my daughter. Had to wait 5 minutes to be seated even though there was plenty of space, which was fine. Service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. Food was okay (nothing special) although the sundae was enormous and the chocolate sauce on the side was a nice touch. Happy also to see lunch portions service quite late into the afternoon. Wish I'd hit the restroom before ordering, though. I tend to judge restaurants by their restrooms. This one was absolutely disgusting. The restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned (or restocked) in days. Virtually every stall was filthy and the handicapped stall lacked toilet paper. I always wonder if a bathroom looks this filthy, what does their kitchen look like? It didn't help that all but one soap dispenser was empty. Hope the workers were able to wash their hands. This is clearly a poorly managed facility. I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory often but I've historically associated it with a basic level of quality and service. Not only will I not return to this restaurant, I won't be picking Cheesecake Factory anywhere if I have an option."
Sid W.,"Santa Clara, CA",3,14,,4.0,11/4/2017,"Never had a bad experience, very good food. Tex mex egg rolls and Chinese chicken salad recommended. I always get the red velvet cheesecake which my wife loves and always up to the mark."
Nudi S.,"Monterey, CA",13,25,76,1.0,10/1/2017,"If it not for cheeses cake, will never step in to this place ever. Order 2 cheese cakes Togo, took almost 20 mins to pack it. I was stand waiting 3 people came after me got the order. Step in to ask what happened to my order, ha! It was sitting there no one want to pack it for me. What a service , The Cheesecake Factory has! Huge franchise but wasting money hire lazy people to stand and talk"
Cheryl G.,"San Jose, CA",63,65,412,5.0,1/19/2017,"Haven't been here in years.  Server was Miguel Started with the Thai lettuce wraps - huge appetizer plate with chicken, condiments, and sauces. Also the sourdough and wheat bread, warm with butter.  Ordered the Miso Salmon- which came our perfect, the Jambalaya which was a bit spicy and the fettuccine quite overcooked, & antioxidant salad- which was everything I had wanted in a salad: mixed greens, sunflower seeds, kale, roasted pears, grapes, with a blueberry lemon vinegarette; to die for.  Dessert: fresh banana & strawberry cheesecake. The crust was not good on the banana this time, which usually is the best cheesecake imo.  I was surprised we sat down right away at 5pm for dinner and service was amazing. We would come back to try it again."
Andrew S.,"San Jose, CA",1,123,6,3.0,1/9/2017,"Not as good an experience as at the Palo Alto location. Service was a bit slow and the food lukewarm and a bit bland. Gotta have cheesecake for dessert at TCF, and it was good, not great, and on the small side for the price."
Myk L.,"San Francisco, CA",60,8,3,1.0,12/9/2017,"We were seated at a table that's smelled like theyve been wiped with a moldy rag.  Gross.   We asked to be moved and was instead told to tell the host to be reseated.  We realized we were moved to the back of the list as we watched four groups get called ahead of us.  When we brought this to the attention of the host, immediately with an attitude he said we can talk to the manager then he refused to look our way.  When the manager spoke with us, he said he didn't know how that happened.  They then proceeded to seat us next to a large party with a crying baby when there were plenty of empty tables.  Rather then ask to be reseated again, we left.  I would give zero stars if I could."
