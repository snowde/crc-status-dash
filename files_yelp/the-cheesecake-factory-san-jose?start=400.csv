Nancy C.,"San Jose, CA",0,39,26,5.0,3/21/2015,"I'm not much of a chain restaurant fan, but I was pleasantly surprised on this  visit. Food was good. All fresh ingredients, and of course, good cheasecake. Chicken Madeira and Chicken Tuscan. Passion Fruit iced tea. Banana  creame cheasecake.  I will come more often  Also surprised at the fresh herbs and ingredients  on the plates."
Jeremy N.,"San Jose, CA",133,11,,4.0,4/27/2014,"Went on a sat night for double dinner date, about 20 min wait for four people. Service was on point our server took a break but had another waitress help us who was also very attentive. She (original waitress) then returned to help as well. Food was straight up amazing, the flavors are always complex and food is filling, but in a good way. Just means there are plenty of opportunities for leftovers. We were too full to get cheesecake but I definitely want to get the melted Smore cheesecake next time!  Farfalle garlic pancetta pasta - Amazing!  Fried Mac n Cheese balls A+"
Sharon M.,"San Jose, CA",57,53,10,2.0,9/7/2015,Gave this a try again after Buca di pepos gas was out disabling their ability to cook. Garlic noodles with shrimp over cooked unseasoned and al dente super crispy unseasoned spaghetti noodles. Sent it back as it was inedible. The tuna tataki salad us always good and the two stars is for decent service although dirty salad plates stayed on the table and no offer for a second beer or a glass of water. This location has evidently went down in quality. Maybe I should head away to Santana Row area to get a decent meal.
Darrell M.,"Graham, WA",62,156,9,3.0,10/13/2012,"I would like to give this 3.5 stars. The food was great, but it was slow, and the service wasn't terrible, but not great either. We ordered the Vietnamese Tacos for an appetizer, took probably 20 minutes to get to the table, and the place was not full.  The tacos were really good. I had the Salisbury Chopped Steak, and it was amazing! It was everything a Hungry Man Salisbury Steak dinner is NOT.  Moist, perfectly cooked, and a really nice reduction type sauce with onions.  Also, the mashed potatoes were really good! My better half had the Jambalaya Pasta, and she didn't really care for it.  The veggies were cut into huge pieces that required a knife to cut.  The noodles didn't fit the texture profile of Jambalaya, she would have preferred rice.  The chicken was delicious, but the shrimp and sausage weren't noteworthy. We came here for date night, and next date night we are going to P.F. Chang's, I'd go back and eat here again, but we aren't in any hurry."
Jennifer W.,"Seaside, CA",16,37,101,4.0,7/26/2014,Great service and great food! I love this place down to the free bread to their awesome cheesecake! Yum!
Daniela S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,2,2,5.0,6/11/2016,"Love this restaurant! Can be a little busy at certain hours, but the food is really good so it worth it."
LoLinda G.,"San Ramon, CA",14,37,14,5.0,2/16/2015,"Oh. Em. Gee. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! After a short wait and photobombing two girls lol, we were seated. The floor seemed rather slippery although it was perfectly clean. Probably too much wax. Our waiter was the nicest guy you could want, and the food was beyond delicious! I always have complicated, special orders, and everything was done perfectly with no problems. I highly recommend this location!"
Coker S.,"San Jose, CA",60,45,6,5.0,2/15/2015,This place is great! I stopped by with my kids today after a long day at the mall. I was really surprised how much they really care about there costumers. I felt as if I was with family. Here's my story somebody dropped a glass and it shattered on the ground. My daughter cut her finger from an unrelated accident. So we asked our waitress if she had a band aid. She came right away with a first aid kit which was great a few minutes passed and then the manager came by and sat with us to make sure everything was okay she thought that maybe my daughter cut herself on the broken glass. I'm not the type to ever make a big deal about something but for the manager and the waitress to stop everything on a busy weekend to sit and talk to us is awesome! thank you guys I really appreciate you going above and beyond to comfort us.
Sher F.,"San Jose, CA",4,34,,5.0,12/10/2013,My daughter was turning 10 and wanted to have her party here at Cheesecake Factory with 7 of her friends. The party was on a Sunday at 11:30am.   They didn't take reservations but told me that it was okay to come early the day of the party to decorate and they would find me a spot.  The day of the party I spoke with James the manager and he was very helpful and reserved a spot for me in the back.  I was able to decorate the tables and put up some balloons.    Our server was Vera and she was absolutely wonderful.   Very patient with the little girls at the table who were all very excited to be there.  The food came out pretty quickly and Vera was very attentive in coming back to check with us periodically on if we needed anything.   I love their Fried Zucchini and the Spinach Artichoke Dip with the toasted bread with butter was delicious.  I did get some cheesecake to go and tried the new Peppermint Cheesecake and thought it was great as well.  Afterwards we headed to the movie theatre which just takes few minutes to walk to since it is located in the same mall so it was a very convenient location.  The only challenge of the day was that it is holiday season and finding parking was difficult.  But that was not Cheese Cake Factory's fault.    All in all the staff at the Cheesecake Factory contributed to the success of the party and we were all pleased with the service.
Carla B.,"San Martin, CA",19,13,2,3.0,10/31/2015,"Average.  First Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I came here on Halloween night and the moment I walked in is really the reason why I didn't enjoy coming here as much as I should've. I wasn't greeted and the two or three front desk employees were standing there staring at me like I was going to ask them for a free meal or something. I asked ""Am I supposed to seat myself or..?"" And the male at the desk said ""No ma'am"" in a sarcastic or negative tone, hard to describe. Our server was nice but not genuine. Seemed annoyed, which is understandable. Wait time wasn't that bad and the food was pretty good. Prices weren't bad either, $56 including tip for a cheese burger with fries and a strawberry lemonade and a 4 cheese pasta with a coke and one slice of cheesecake. Again, it was average. I would've had a better night if I went to the Old Spaghetti Factory"
Elizabeth H.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,4,,1.0,5/18/2016,"Not only was the appetizer burnt,  but so was the chicken dinner entree.  The worst,  it's clear they don't wash the fruits and vegetable as the veggie on my son's plate had a sticker on it.  This was brought to the manager's attention, her reply ""sorry you had to see that."" What?!"
Courtney S.,"San Jose, CA",12,8,,1.0,3/6/2016,"To sum up my overall experience, only one word comes to mind; HORRIBLE. My fiancé and I only have one night off a week, and we decided to take our night to our local Cheesecake Factory. Being that it was a Saturday night, we knew there was going to be a wait. We were quoted an hour. When we returned, we were told another 20 minutes. 20 minutes later, another 10 minutes. The gentleman at the host stand was less than understanding of our frustration. When we asked him if we had a booth or a table, He rudely responded with ""You have a table"" I asked if it was in the middle of a groups and once again rudely responded ""Your up against a wall"" I made a comment about waiting for a booth and he said it would be a long wait but when I mentioned that I didn't want to wait after the 30 minutes of runarounds a booth happened to open up. Once seated, our server (the only pleasant part of our visit) came by, took our drink and meal orders. I noticed that my spoon looked a little dirty so I handed it off to her, ""This is a little dirty, but I don't need it so its ok."" After noticing my spoon, I took a closer look at the other utensils and noticed ALL BUT ONE were dirty. I asked for the manager and explained to her how unsettling it was that nearly all of the silverware on our table happened to be dirty. I didn't feel comfortable putting those utensils on my food or in my mouth even. Once I got my drink and felt the etching on the glass, I was startled thinking that the glass was dirty too. The manager tried to tell me that one of the knives was only water stains and I kindly asked if she would run her finger along the knife to feel the grime that I felt. Her facial expression changed. She did assure me that she would be speaking to the dishwashers to make sure that this issue was corrected. To finish off my night, I'd like to move on to our meal. My fiancé ordered a burger, and I ordered off the small plates menu, Ahi Tartar and a side of edamame as my meal. My fiancé's meal came out first, our server said she would be right back while she checked on my food. While she was gone, another server came to drop off my edamame and to inform me that they had ran out of the Ahi Tartar. At this point I was LIVID. Was this not an issue that could have been addressed before our food was dropped? So I would have had a chance to order something and not have to WAIT? The server who dropped our food off told the manager who was on her way to address the mess up that I was clearly upset. So she asked me ""Would you like another appetizer?"" Perhaps she didn't know that was my meal? I did decline because my fiancé already had his food, I didn't want his food to get cold while he waited for me to get served, and at that point I was too upset to eat. Once we asked for our check, no manager stopped by to make right by the situation, the server just said that they comped the $5 edamame. I did not mention that the host in the beginning was rude to us, because I wanted to move past that and enjoy my dinner........ but that didn't happen. With a rude host, dirty silverware, and the dinner (or lack thereof) I was just ready to get out of there. Working in Customer Service, and having worked in the food industry, in no way was there any attempt at trying to turn my experience around."
Anna H.,"San Jose, CA",158,66,122,4.0,2/23/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory. It never fails me. What I usually order: Miso Salmon Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip Factory Combo: Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane Chicken Farfalle with Pancetta & Chicken All are super flavorful and in huge portions!  And the cheesecake that I absolutely love: TIRAMISU! I've never been a fan of tiramisu, coffee, mocha or anything along those lines, but this is so tasty!"
Marisa S.,"San Jose, CA",25,30,7,2.0,7/19/2015,"This place is hit or miss.  I usually get 2 dishes, Shepards Pie or the Miso Salmon. Recently, the Shepards Pie is not what it used to be... In fact, I ordered a half portion the other day and it was #meh.  Informed the waitress the meat was burnt and dish overall was dry, with a funny consistency for the mash.  All I received back was a ""sorry"".  Next day I was so sick -- probably food poisoning."
Owie N.,"San Francisco, CA",622,1348,4663,3.0,4/23/2012,"My favorite restaurant chain that I can always go to but not so much at this location though. I usually ordered my usual here and decided to get a Chicken Tostada Salad and it took them nearly 40 minutes to bring it out. By them time I got the salad I was full from eating the bread and the small plates that we have ordered. Maybe the next time I would have a better luck of getting my food on time. Also, something about this plaza that drive me nuts when finding parking so it is also why I am a little antsy. Other than that, the quality of the food is good and definitely their cheesecake as well."
Tim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1401,252,4058,4.0,11/21/2011,Been here twice and it never took more than 10 min. to get seated which is great!  The food is great and their drinks are strong! One Long Island Ice tea and I was buzzed...not bad!  My apologies about the poor lighting in the pictures the place was very dark.
Satnam B.,"San Jose, CA",121,502,251,3.0,4/4/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake factory for the first time with the wife the other day. This is located in Oakridge Mall past the food court towards Target. I was really impressed with the decor, atmosphere and friendly staff. You need to walk towards the cakes and cheesecake counter if you come in on the mall side and register how many guests. I decided to ask at the counter if there cheesecakes all had eggs, and the attendant did not have an ingredient or allergen chart but said I think so, not good, they should know their ingredients. I wish they made a cheesecake without eggs. Had a short 5 min wait to be seated at a booth. Decided to order fried zucchini and portobello mushroom fries and asked for ketchup vs the dips. Tasted really good! There whole wheat bread and butter also was delectable, I did not like the white bread at all.  I went through the menu and decided on a large veggie burger and fries, boy was the burger big and it tasted really good. My wife went with a pasta dish and she liked it. The staff checked on us often and topped up our waters, asked if everything was ok and was willing to bring more bread.  It was a really nice experience, then came the bill, $33 for lunch for two! Woah, little pricey if you are looking to fill up, 3 stars, if prices were lower for specials would have given it 5."
Charlene P.,"San Jose, CA",42,149,197,4.0,3/7/2014,"The biggest downside I have with this place is that no matter what day and time we come here, there's always a 30 minute + wait. I recently just went on 2/8/2014 and had to wait an hour. -__________- Granted it was a Saturday evening, but still are they understaffed or something? They always seem to be moving so slow! As for the food, my favorite dish by far is the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with chipotle mayo. The meat is so moist and tender and overall yummy! Never get their side salad though. It's so gross and bitter...then again I'm the type of person who likes the plain old Caesar Salad. To each their own. You might enjoy it. Aside from this entrée, their burger is eh--nothing spectacular. I'd rather go to Red Robin or BJs next door if I wanted a good burger. I enjoy the low lighting and atmosphere of this place, but it does tend to get really loud. It's conveniently placed in a mall where we can roam around before or after our meal.  More often then not, I come here for the cheesecake. Granted it's not the best and smoothest cheesecake I've ever had--it's still pretty good. I especially adore their Red Velvet. But I know people who enjoy their Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and their Mud Pie.  Another complaint I have though is that their Orange Chicken seems to be hit or miss every time we order it. The very last time we received it, it was nice and moist and covered with sauce. But a couple times before that, they came out pretty dry. AND it's a $17 dish which I think is kind of ridiculous considering all they give you is about ten pieces of chicken and a portion of white rice.  PLUS SIDE. Their Oreo Milkshake is sooooo good. They always blend it nice and thick compared to Red Robin's which can be runny at times. I would give their Peach Smoothie a big thumbs up as well!"
Terry S.,"Santa Ana, CA",137,66,5,3.0,5/26/2015,This was the Chessecake Factory. I have been to a lot of them. From the East to the West Coast. This particular one was OK. I had the Steak Diane & Herb Crusted Salmon w/ Potatoes. The Steak good. The Salmon  great. The potatoes were horrible. I would go back because the service was good and normally at the Chessecake Factory everything is good.
Stuart S.,"San Jose, CA",7,59,,1.0,8/18/2015,"We went to the restaurant at 12:55PM on Tuesday 8-18-2015. The hostess told us the wait would be a few minutes.  In the meantime, I looked around the restaurant and there were numerous tables set but they were not being used for customers.  After waiting 20 minutes, the wait was far beyond the quoted estimate so we decided to leave. The hostess should be taught to estimate seating times more accurately.  The management should hire more servers because there were many tables available but no servers to cover those tables."
