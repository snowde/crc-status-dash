Sandra C.,"San Jose, CA",140,105,701,4.0,3/8/2012,"Alert: New favorite discovered .... LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA! Their menu is sooo ginormous, I'm sure I'll come up with more so stay tuned :)"
Pablo N.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,2,2.0,3/26/2014,"They made us wait for 20-25min, and when we finally got seated, there was a whole aisle of free tables. Why make us wait? Short staffed? When at the table, had to wait for another 10min before getting water and bread. Got the Chicken Bellagio, which ended up being a pile of salt with some thick and chewy pork belly they called prosciutto. Very disappointing. And then the bill comes! Definitely not worth the prices."
Noelle J.,"San Jose, CA",557,881,11402,4.0,7/20/2009,"The World According to Noelle ~Allergic Girl's Guide to Life~ ""Large selection of food in an Allergy Friendly environment- makes me a happy camper!"" Noelle W. (Thoughts on Cheesecake Factory). I come to this particular Cheesecake Factory 3-4 times a month with family and friends because of the endless allergy friendly selections. They have a new GM and the staff seems to be more efficient. I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE the Sunday Brunch selections. My favorite Sunday Brunch selection is the french toast with whipped cream and chocolate; they also make to die for bacon. My favorite dishes are: 1. Old Fashioned Burger which is on a Toasted Brioche Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles and Mayonnaise. Served with Fries. (Its Charbroiled) and I usually get it protein style. 2. The Factory Burger (Its Charbroiled) with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions. I normally get this on a baguette w/ bleu cheese sans the cheddar and tomato.  3. Chicken Salad Sandwich- Housemade with Roasted Almonds, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo. Served on Grilled Brioche Bread. Sans the almonds of course. 4. Shepherd's  Pie- Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious Sauce Covered with Mashed Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese. This is a great savory and hearty dish. A group of our friends were going to meet up for dinner and a movie. It turned out that only two people could make it that one night! Though the restaurant was full (meaning people seated and dining) there was no wait at all. Service from start to finish was seamless and friendly. Our waiter was going on a break, and in standard Cheesecake Factory procedure they introduce the person who will be helping out. My friend had the chicken tacos and I had the original hamburger. Food was fresh, tasty and allergy friendly. For dessert my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake and I opted for the original with cherry topping.  My friend treated for dinner and it was agreed that next time I'll pick up the tab. I've been to Cheesecake Factories in California (Northern and Southern) and Washington- its a good chain restaurant which can satisfy even the pickiest eater! On another note- they did bring back the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake but its different; instead of topping it with whole pineapple rings they top it with a pineapple puree (probably more cost effective). Favorite Sweets: Lemoncello Cream Torte Layers of Vanilla Cake and Lemon Mascarpone Cream Topped with Streusel and Served with Strawberries and Whipped Cream. Tiramisu  Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur. Topped with Whipped Cream and Ground Chocolate 30th Anniversary Cheesecake Two layers of our Original Cheesecake and Two layers of our Creamy Chocolate Fudge Cake filled with Chocolate Cream and finished with Crunchy Pearls of Chocolate. Honey Vanilla Latte Double Espresso, Honey, Vanilla and Steamed Milk Noelle's Notes Sunday Brunch is YUM!"
Denish G.,"Barcelona, Spain",101,261,160,2.0,8/4/2014,"Great for family and friends, birthday parties and other even business  dinner. Actually is very good but not as maggialos Santana Row also very Expensive not healthy at all.  Service is good, time is horrible is not like they cook from scratch all the time. Well after going 100ds of restaurants I became very picky"
Ryan E.,"Gilroy, CA",63,7,1,2.0,8/2/2015,Long wait for our waiter to return from serving our drinks to taking our order. Stepped on a cockroach getting out of booth and manager did nothing. Very disappointed in this place.
Kristin M.,"San Jose, CA",2,8,,1.0,4/4/2016,"Horrible customer service.  Called at 3 pm on a Monday to place a quick curbside order. Waited 15 minutes on hold, despite letting them know I needed quick service.  And then when I spoke to manager, she only apologized and said they just realized someone was on hold.  Frustrating that they aren't more concerned about potential customer orders."
Mike B.,"San Jose, CA",16,21,,2.0,7/22/2015,"Forgot items on our first take out order. We called, very nice manager sent us a gift card for the issue. Next time we went to use the card on a larger order they forgot the cheese cakes. I didn't have the energy to call the second time. I can only speak to their take out but it seems like their staff was overwhelmed and making mistakes. Maybe just not good for take out?"
Jenn L.,"San Jose, CA",106,46,8,2.0,5/26/2015,"The food isn't awful but it's literally the worst restaurant in America when it comes to calorie counts. I used to love the cheesecake but after developing an egg allergy, I can't even eat that so there's no reason to eat here. You can get the same dishes made better somewhere else with less calories, and a lower price tag."
Kestrel P.,"Campbell, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/14/2015,"I'm a huge fan of ccf, so I'm not saying anything against the franchise as a whole, but this location NEEDS HELP. Every single time I've been in, the service is horrific. My order has been messed up every time. It takes way too long to be served and my server is always too distracted to care if my group has been properly accommodated. I will travel further to any other location and will not come back here."
Michael B.,"San Jose, CA",1,55,,4.0,7/5/2015,"I like this Cheesecake Factory.  After spending a day doing errands and shopping at the mall, it's so nice to be able to abscond into this convenient location for some good food and a break.  On my recent visit the staff was very friendly and helpful. Food came out really fast. Yay! I'm a fan."
Liana H.,"San Jose, CA",53,261,1238,4.0,6/11/2013,"Pre-diet, I was a BIG cheesecake factory fan. I never had a problem finding something to eat here, everything is good! Currently, dieting I groaned when I found out the group wanted cheesecake factory for lunch. I didn't think I would be able to find anything on the menu to eat, let alone look at! Imagine my suprise when I found their ""skinnilicious menu"". Great options for those who are looking to eat a bit better! I got the skinny chicken tacos. It came with a yummy salsa and a side of picked veggies. yum yum yum! The tacos were filling as well as delcious. Service was excellent!"
Brenda B.,"Marina, CA",2,24,3,5.0,9/29/2014,Was at the Cheesecake Factory for my nieces birthday on the 26th of July this year of 2014 the calamari is excellent and jumbo prawns where to die for. Excellent cheesecake also
Stan S.,"Campbell, CA",1,14,,3.0,7/4/2015,"The food was good, the service was good, but the seats are terrible. Hard bench seats with straight up backs. Very uncomfortable."
Michael S.,"San Jose, CA",255,70,32,4.0,11/14/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory. What a wonderful phrase. Don't know where to go to eat? Well just say Cheesecake Factory and watch your friend's heads nod in agreement because there's nothing not to like about these 'straunts (if nobody calls them that then I'm starting it). Unfortunately, part of their brand strategy is to position themselves in busy locations and this one is on the outskirts of a shopping mall in San Jose. I can't think of a busier place in San Jose than a mall unless you say you're at a Cheesecake Factory at a mall. Well you can see where they lost a star here. Aside from waiting an absurdly long amount of time to be seated, the food here is great and accompanied by a tremendous atmosphere with dim lights and eye-catching architecture that is truly sophisticated and eloquent for a chain restaurant. My favorite dishes include the Chicken Bellagio, Kobe Burger, Avocado Egg Rolls, Baja Chicken/Fish Tacos and (sadly not on the menu anymore) Thai Chicken Pasta. If you haven't been here in a while, try it again. They've removed some items and added new concoctions to their arsenal of culinary excellence that you may enjoy. Oh, and Pumpkin Cheesecake. Don't leave here without one."
Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",485,786,1873,4.0,5/24/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory serves a huge variety of food from Asian to Western styled food in a classical modern setting. This particular Cheesecake Factory has heated outside seating which is great if you want to be outside.  Pros Food: The food here is really flavorful here and the wide variety makes it interesting to come and try out the new meals that they have. Like the name suggest this place is known for there cheesecake and they don't disappoint. They have a huge variety of different cheesecakes to choose from. There are no real differences in flavors of food between the Valley Fair and Oakridge area in my opinion. They all taste pretty good.  Outside seating: The outside is heated through large heat lamps spread around the area which is really nice if you want to sit outside on a hot day. Also great if you don't like the inside of the restaurant.  Location: The place is located inside Oakridge Mall so its a fantastic place to shop or see a movie afterwards. Definitely a great place to maybe meet with friends or go out on a date.  Cons Parking: Because this place is located near a mall, parking can be really difficult during peak hours so expect to park far from the restaurant if your going for dinner or peak hours.  Crowded: This place doesn't get as packed at the one in Valley Fair but expect long lines during peak hours. Overall this Cheesecake factory gives you a choice of seating outside or inside which is really nice. The food is good depending on what you order and its in a fantastic location for a girls night out or a date night."
David L.,"Monterey, CA",61,41,45,2.0,4/4/2014,"Hmmm, the 1st start goes to their micro brew selection, although limited. The 2nd goes to the wait staff, who was forgetful but pleasant.  Minus 1st star: food came out after 45 minutes Minus 2nd star: food came out cold Minus 3rd star: waiter forgot water refills, water with no ice request, and a salad in the beginning It was moderately busy that night. (25 minute wait)"
Evangelina B.,"San Jose, CA",355,533,219,2.0,5/19/2013,"Came here yesterday with my family. Six of us ladies celebrating a late mothers day, and three birthdays for my godmother, counsin and aunt. With six of us we were there to spend money. We arrived around 430 so we knew the wait wouldn't be long. We were seated right away( After we barely found parking in their crazy parking lot). Our waitress seemed like she was having a stressed day. I've been here many times and the service here is a hit or miss.   My grandmother tends to ask a lot of menu questions but that is what we pay for, the service. The entire time our waitress helped us she seemed impatient and never really asked anything else? Before she left the table. If I asked for  a water she just walked away. With five other ladies sitting at the table you'd think she would want less trips? I had ordered a burger with fries and wanted some honey mustard. She came back and said they were out. What a strange thing to be out of. I could see if ketchup was since its used more but honey mustard? Oh well. When my godmother got her meatloaf half of it was burnt. It was brought to her attention but instead of offering a new one she said i'll let the kitchen manager know. When it came time for dessert we all ordered one. There's $45-50 bucks right there, just in desserts!  She came back to say they were out of strawberry cheesecake. My grandmother was no impressed. We all had our desserts and the most popular one they are out of? She quickly made a new choice and got it within a good amount of time.  When we got our bill it was not split the way we asked from the beginning.  I was beginning to write it out when she came by to say sorry I'll fix that for you. We wanted to enjoy our desserts and open presents but our table was full of dirty dishes. We called the manager over to voice our bad experience overall. He seemed to listen but didn't seem like he really cared. We asked if he could send someone to clean our dinner plates so we can enjoy our dessert with a clean table and he said no problem. 15 min later and no one still came. We opened the gifts with dirty plates. As we left my godmother spoke to him that no one came to help clear the table. He said he sent someone and apologized. As we were walking out he came out to say he wanted to know if someone did come but we asked the person to leave the table. We told him that was not true, It seemed a lot of people were lying this day. Perhaps laziness from the staff and it was all being put on the manger. I don't know if ill go to this location again.  And to top it off my godmother got gum on her pants from the booth! No bueno"
Samantha L.,"Mountain View, CA",0,9,3,5.0,11/24/2014,"My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar. We frequent it often and always have a great time. Daren, the bartender, is amazing. Great service and knowledge! He's always accommodating and friendly! Thanks Daren!"
Lily T.,"San Jose, CA",81,46,64,4.0,8/23/2013,"The only thing I hate about Cheesecake are the long waits and being sat down. I rather just go to the bar where they will directly serve me or order to-go. I can not stand dining in because the waitresses are so slow with getting your drinks, food, bill..  But I do love the food here."
Kele L.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",16,41,3,4.0,3/26/2015,"I recently got dinner here with my boyfriend (we both had the cashew chicken which is awesome.) I had asked our server to package the rest of my meal to take home. Right after I left, I realized I had forgotten the bag with my dinner in it. I returned inside less than a minute later and it was already gone. I was extremely disappointed. After one of the hostesses told me there was nothing she could do, Ashley (not our server) apologized and offered to have the kitchen make an entirely new entree to take home. After about 15 minutes, we left with plenty of cashew chicken to snack on later.  Thank you Ashley! You are awesome :)"
