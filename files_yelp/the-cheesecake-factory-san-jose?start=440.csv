Anastasia Z.,"San Jose, CA",105,59,8,5.0,10/27/2014,Hadnt come to this place in a while.. Food and service is awesome ... Mexican tortilla salad and chicken enchiladas were delicious!!! We are definitely coming back especially for the outstanding service and smiles we had from Alan (our server).
Kristiara G.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/16/2016,"I work in the restaurant business so I personally don't like to complain but tonight was a disappointment. When I dine in I always get the pasta di Vinci so when I did take out tonight I got my usual. The service from the employees was great they were attentive and kind. The order itself was correct no mushrooms like I asked but when I took a bite of the pasta there was no flavor, there wasn't or very light marsala sauce. When I tried the chicken it was dry and tough. My advice if you wanna enjoy the food don't go through take out."
Sarah C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,96,2,2.0,7/19/2015,Luau Salad soggy Tasted like soft pickles Buffalo wings were humongous but salty Waitress sweet but didn't get the dish sitting at their kitchen window counter until a good 15-20 mins even though it was ready  The best part and maybe the only good part of the meal was the bread  I've had other Cheesecake Factory at different location n they were spot on.  This one tasted like something prepared by a hungry college kid at his dorm. We also ordered the seared tuna salad but I didn't try it. Everything cost a good $60 for salad n wings. The restaurant looked beautiful though.
Kristine  B.,"San Jose, CA",185,10,57,4.0,11/24/2014,"Love the atmosphere here, the background music and lighting is very relaxing. I can't complain about their cocktails, it's perfect!"
Kim C.,"San Jose, CA",18,70,,5.0,8/2/2013,Service: When we got our table we were only waiting a minute for the waiter to take our order. The waiter was very friendly and gave us anything we wanted. They brought out our food probably within 10 or 15 minutes. I would say that The Cheesecake Factory had excellent service. Food: The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a chicken dish. It had an Asian sauce that went very well with the chicken. There was a caramel sauce that was drizzled on top of the chicken that made it have an amazing flavor. The caramel on the outside made it sweet and crunchy. There was rice served with the chicken that also went well with the chicken. If you go here you should give this dish a try. Dessert: The cheesecake that they serve there is the best. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it is to die for. The cake was very moist. The cream cheese in the middle was sweet and creamy. The white chocolates at the top gave it a special taste. Whenever I go here I'm always excited for the dessert.
Debbie Q.,"San Jose, CA",271,48,19,5.0,10/30/2014,"Love this place especially the bartenders.  Their social, make amazing drinks and take great care of us every time we go.  I wish they had bigger TV's though!"
James N.,"San Jose, CA",514,420,25,4.0,3/11/2013,"I've never really had a bad experience here before. All of my visits have ended with a full belly and an empty wallet. Wonderful. My favorite pasta dish here is unfortunately... rated the MOST Unhealthiest Pasta Dish in the United States. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you...     The Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic Another one of my all time favorite dishes here is the Miso Salmon. Oh sweet Poseidon... That fish is absolutely delicious. That sauce and that Salmon... DROOOL I also love that brown bread that they give you at the start. I call it the Chocolate bread but I am aware that it is wheat bread. So gooooooooooooood!!! Never really liked their cheesecake but hey, I'm here for dat 3000 calorie PASTA! 4 Stars!"
Jasmine P.,"San Francisco, CA",287,247,4,5.0,6/28/2013,"Normally I'm not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, because I literally have gotten a headache flipping through their massive menu, in the past.  But not this time.   OMG earlier this week me and my honey stopped by to peek at the deserts, and ended up leaving with a massive slice of chocolate cheesecake, vanilla ice cream, fresh whip cream, and even a cherry on top!   Yep... I asked for that cherry, and I got it!   I really appreciate the patient, customer focused, customer service we received here, because lets face it.... picking out ""just the right"" cheesecake can take time! By the way: I also asked for a to-go menu, and the guys at the hostess stand literally handed me a menu, and told me to take it! They probably weren't supposed to do that, but I think it was F'N awesome!  Headaches be gone! Next time I'mma know what I want ahead of time!!!"
susan s.,"San Jose, CA",9,10,1,1.0,9/27/2014,"So my experience was one I felt needed to be ""yelped"" being it was so awful. I ordered curbside delivery 9/26/14 but even after asking for the gentleman who took my order to give my order back to me which was easy (two grilled cheese sandwiches and one order of spicy cashew chicken and 4 slices of cheesecake.) Obviously this was more of a order for the little ones in my home sitting hungry. The guy who took my order said it would take 30-40mins to be ready. My reply ""no rush I'm not close take your time"" his reply ""thank you ma'am."" After 45 mins go by my husband leaves to go get food, comes home then notices the one none kid order was wrong (no spicy cashew chicken) yay, NOT! So now we have to go back out to tell them they screwed up.  My husband arrived went to the checkout line waiting 10mins then walked to the maître d'and asked what to do since we have a meal we didn't order and it's now 2 hours in since ordered (even though I called ahead.) They pointed to the line my husband just exited to ask for help.....but now must re-enter and wait yet another 15 mins to get our original meal order.  Did they say sorry? Did they offer a discount? Anything? NOPE! Instead an evening of my family running back and forth at this restaurant. Complete waste of the night. Yes we got our chicken dish, but at the cost of time and gas it took it was a total waste.  Completely disappointed in the lack of any customer service. The inconvenience this caused us was of no concern of anyone that worked there.  If you're a busy mom, this is the last place you want to order take out from. If you do...triple check and rethink the tip you give these curbside workers."
Michael Z.,"San Jose, CA",48,21,13,1.0,4/28/2015,"I recently went for lunch and it took a bit longer than usual to see our waitress to get drinks and bread. we finally see our waitress and ordered appetizer and Rene's lunch special which can with tortilla soup and spicy chipotle chicken pasta. The food took so long to arrive and our waitress did not come by often to check on us. When we finally got our food my fiancé ordered the Rene's special which comes with sandwich,salad and soup and she had ordered tortilla soup once we get our meal the soup did not look like soup but looked like refried beans we asked our waitress if this how it is suppose to look and taste like and she stated that she did not know. I told her that is not soup but who knows what. We normally go to this one and have never had a bad experience but today was not the best experience with the wait time and not getting what we originally ordered and the waitress not even knowing how the food should look and taste like."
Mona U.,"San Jose, CA",17,69,,3.0,4/26/2015,"I've been here a few times and each time the experiences have been different. The food is ok and pricey, the cocktails are watered down considerably but, of course, the saving grace of this place are the varieties of cheesecakes. I've tried a few of them but my favorite is the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. It's very decadent and rich and worth the trip here."
Guy D.,"San Jose, CA",48,5,,2.0,7/21/2015,Food was ok... However... This was the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. Our server was not only rude but he was sarcastic and annoying with a very sad attempt at trying to be funny. It was an awful experience.
Grant M.,"Santa Clara, CA",52,15,1,5.0,7/27/2013,"We went to the one at Valley Fair but the wait was way too long.  We drove to this Cheese Cake Factory at Oakridge Mall and were seated within 5 minutes. Our water was Daniel who immediately had our drink order and was quite the conversationalist.  He had recommendations for drinks, daily specials and at the end of the meal he had recommendations for cheese cakes.   We would definitely go back to this Cheese Cake Factory and I would request Daniel."
Julie N.,"San Jose, CA",633,401,1382,4.0,4/25/2011,"My boyfriend took me straight here after my six hour commute from Orange County to San Jose so I wasn't exactly dressed well. I was in clothes I'd normally wear to a pilates or yoga class so it wasn't toally bum-ish and I did have a nice purse, but I guess I didn't convey the message of ""I'M NOT DIRT POOR"" enough... That + our age = a server who second guessed us a lot. ""Do you want a REAL pina colada or a virgin one?""  She also assumed our appetizer salad order was our whole meal. I guess we looked too poor to order entrees because she thought we were going to split an appetizer salad. We had to flag her down when she never came back to take our entree order, and she was so shocked that we wanted to (could afford to) order more. *New CF fave for my boyfriend: their thai chicken pasta! *Menu items that made us giggle: all their ""viet"" stuff. Viet Tacos?! We ordered these and they were... VIET TACOS! haha pretty clever if you ask me, ""thit nuong"" (Vietnamese BBQ pork) in a ""bao"" shell.  Despite spotty service, we can always count on CF to deliver great food. Where else can you get such an extensive menu of QUALITY food for reasonable prices?"
Christina T.,"Los Gatos, CA",153,440,48,4.0,9/16/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I love it MORE when I get a table quick.... therefore we go around 5:30... Hit it at 6 or later and you will be waiting a while.  The food is ALWAYS consistent and the wait staff is TYPICALLY good (though there are those few....). If you want good that you know will be good everytime you go, this is worth the extra dime. A word to the wise, if you eat outside, avoid sitting on the entrance side near the street.... sometimes you can smell the sewer and no matter how good your food is... sewer smell will TOTALLY ruin it..."
Danny N.,"San Francisco, CA",1,182,87,4.0,3/10/2015,Hardly ever been disappointed here. Place is always busy so try to best the dinner rush. Especially on the weekends.  Food is good and so is the service. If you go there with kids at prime time I wouldn't recommend  it. Lines are long and your kids will complain
Teri B.,"Chualar, CA",0,13,5,2.0,4/18/2015,"To the people like me who always order their favorite thing... The manager says they change things every six months. I always order the fried wonton appetizers, they changed the light tangy sauce for a gross brown thick gloppy sauce. Totally ruined the dish. The manager lamely said that people liked the new sauce because it stuck to the wonton better. I am so disappointed and have no reason to return."
Mike D.,"San Jose, CA",74,51,,5.0,6/21/2014,"Rock n roll cheesecake factory!  Love this place - the bar area is great with the TVs...there is usually always an opportunity to sit in the bar. Sure it gets crowded....people like going here.  The servers are always nice, make sure you are taken care of, and are not shy about not letting your glass or plate get empty...I mean, how many times do you go to another restaurant and wait for a person to come see if you want dessert, to see if you need another beer, to see if you need a box or something else?  I love the attention. To me - five stars!"
Trung N.,"San Jose, CA",715,409,54,4.0,5/18/2011,"Valley Fair... or Oakridge? Well.. considering Valley Fair being where it is.. it going to be a little bigger and extremely more crowded over there. So when a large group of friends and I were together celebrating a birthday, it was a smart decision to head to this location instead. Not to say they weren't busy.. as it still took a decent wait to get our table.. but less chaotic it certainly was. The service was great considering the size of our group. They took care of us, and there were no issues or problems. Food was typical Cheesecake Factory quality, and I certainly had no complaints."
Kim D.,"San Jose, CA",334,99,13,4.0,2/13/2013,"Yummms, one of my favorite mall-food restaurants. I come here for the delicious burgers and pasta. They let you customize your burger to any way possible! I ordered the mushroom burger, switched out the bread, cheese, and added a fried egg for no additional cost! :) They charbroil their burger patty and toast their bread. They don't skimp on the cheese, either-- it was oozing out everywhere. Definitely a real gourmet burger. I also like how they have ""small plate"" options so you can have a variety of food for appetizers. Be sure to try the stuffed mushrooms! It was quite impressive-- made for mushroom + parmesan cheese lovers like me.  Excellent customer service and very fair prices. Although I had to wait 20-25 minutes for a table when I clearly saw many tables open..... I assume it was because they were understaffed."
