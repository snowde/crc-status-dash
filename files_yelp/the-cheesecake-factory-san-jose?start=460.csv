Farinaz T.,"Los Gatos, CA",13,115,20,3.0,2/23/2015,"Love Cheesecake Factory. Eat there at least once a month. Their food is good when they get your order right. I have very specific order for my Cobb salad, no cheese, no avocado, balsamic vinagrette on the side and they always get it wrong."
Michelle H.,"San Jose, CA",39,45,22,2.0,2/23/2012,"Meh. I've experienced better pretty much sums it all up!  Went here for lunch on President's Day. Wait time was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. Our server, Ashley, was nice and prompt.  My issue with this place is the food. For the amount of money you're paying, I would expect something a little better. Hell I would expect my shrimp to at least be deveined! I order the shrimp and bacon club. The sandwhich was HUGE. I took out the middle piece of bread and still had a hard time eating the sandwhich. Mid bite I saw a big, dark, gritty vein looking at me. It was gross. Maybe this is just my thing but everything time I make shrimp I make sure to devein it. And never have I ever eaten at a restaurant where the shrimp wasn't deveined! Bleh. Other people in my party order pasta.. Again just meh!"
Tam P.,"San Jose, CA",183,26,,4.0,1/23/2013,"Not perfect, but definitely a great place for a dinner date or in fact with anybody!  Into the specific details, the lighting is a bit dim. Each table has it's own individual light, some tables brighter than others, but make sure you ""turn on"" your brain and ask your waitress for a nice table.  The service there is extremely fast and friendly which is exactly what you should expect when you go into a restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Tortelli and my date ordered a Spinach - Mushroom Ravioli with Veal I believe? The Veal was great but her Ravioli was a bit salty but it was tasty nonetheless. My plate was amazing, I don't eat this variety of food much so the waitress (Sarah if I remember correctly) recommended it to me and it was de-li-ciousssss.  The location is right in the mall so if after a long day of shopping, enjoy a nice meal here at a reasonable price and it will definitely be worth your money. :)"
B. B.,"San Jose, CA",3,111,22,1.0,10/28/2014,"Hands down the worst Cheesecake Factory. Best one is in SF. At this one got food poisoning once, second time my pasta was hard and not even boiled properly, and the sauce was so little, I thought I was eating pasta out of a bag. So sad. And the leftovers I had were drenched in a pool of oil (pic uploaded)."
Philip A.,"Hollister, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/27/2015,"Really good if you go during the week, it's less busy and the food is cooked and seasoned properly. I wouldn't recommend this place on the weekend. The food is rushed and isn't that great. I recommend the chicken bellagio paired with a nice white wine. Enjoy."
Teresa L.,"Mountain View, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/19/2014,"I did not know that the Cheesecake Factory took off the Navajo sandwich, which is my absolute favorite sandwich at the Cheesecake Factory.  On this particular visit (about a month ago), forgot the name of my sandwich so I described it to him. He then told me it was discontinued but he could ask the cook if he could make it for me. Sure enough, I had my favorite sandwich in front of me and I was SO thankful that the waiter went out of his way to ask the cook to make it for me. I forgot the waiter's name but he was very friendly, helpful and did that extra thing for a customer. =)"
Tom L.,"San Jose, CA",1,28,,1.0,2/25/2015,"Service here has gotten progressively worse (slower, messed up orders, under/overcooked food, etc.)"
Paul S.,"Oakland, CA",65,14,16,3.0,11/18/2012,Not really happy. They brought the starter we ordered with our main meal. Also they are so slow. It took almost 20 minutes to bring them all. The only thing was a smiling face asking if we need anything!
Eddie D.,"San Jose, CA",41,33,3,3.0,8/23/2014,"I normally would not go to the Cheesecake Factory since the food is pretty mediocre, but my friends dragged me here the other day for lunch. I ordered the Renee's special which included a salad, soup, and half sandwich and sweet potatoes as an appetizer. So I pretty much finish my fries in about 30 minutes, I know, I'm a slow eater. Another 20 minutes passed and I'm wondering where the heck my food is and the waiter assured me it'll be out in a few minutes (lies). When it finally came out, they got my salad wrong! I asked for Ceasar man, not spring mix or whatever. Service was OK, food was alright, but probably would not come back."
Rosemarie R.,"San Jose, CA",141,22,,1.0,6/15/2014,"Awful experience. Two of my friends and I sat at the bar to have a round of drinks while we were waiting for a table. The Australian bartender asked us if we were going to have a full dinner, we said that we only wanted drinks while we were waiting for a table. From that second he started ignoring us. One of my friends mentioned that to him and he told her that if we did not like the bar we could wait somewhere else. As soon as he said that we decided to leave the restaurant. I really hope he gets fired or at least suspended for disrespecting the guests. Very unprofessional."
Amy L.,"Santa Clara, CA",401,747,273,4.0,5/19/2011,"This is actually one of my favorite Cheesecake Factories! Not too crowded, not too dim, and not too loud. Waiters are friendly, service is fast, and my  Da Vinci pasta was cooked to perfection. The chicken wasn't rubbery; it melted in my mouth. Ohhhh my gosh. But despite that, I can't give it 5 stars. There were random noodles in my pasta. Like. Chow mein noodles. And random other mushrooms tossed in, besides my regular ones. That confused me. Where did the random noodles&mushrooms come from?! I almost don't want to know. I'll probably be back sometime, but I really really hope I don't get random stuff in my orders. Freaks me out a little bit."
Alyssa F.,"Gilroy, CA",3,46,,4.0,1/23/2015,"I think this is the best cheesecake factory in the area! Food is always consistent and service is always nice. It's big and busy so there is always some wait time but, it's is surprisingly efficient."
Kimberly L.,"San Jose, CA",88,315,345,4.0,1/22/2014,So many options of delicious food that comes in huge portions.  Love:  - Kale Salad - huge portion for only $5 - Chicken Madeira - Crispy Chicken Costoletta - Chicken Marsala - Fried Mac n Cheese balls with marinara sauce - Sweet corn tamale cakes Always a great meal when I come here with a ton of leftovers. Can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes. Love the fact they have tropical ice tea without sugar. I'm not a huge fan of sugary ice teas.
Joseph F.,"Salinas, CA",78,21,35,5.0,10/28/2012,"cool restaurant. Just visited here for a birthday party, the staff were celebrating with us! I enjoyed every seconds being here. Super great restaurant."
Richard L.,"Salinas, CA",1,54,,2.0,4/2/2015,"If you get a chance to go to the bar and eat, that's what you should do. Otherwise, don't even bother. I've been here TWICE in the regular section and I've had to leave because we were getting zero service. It's seriously as if they sit you down before they're ready for you, all so they clear up the waiting area. Here's an example: 3 of us are there the day after New Year's. It was a normal Friday night crowd and we sat down after 15 minutes of waiting. The waiter took about 5 minutes to come take our drink order (that's normal. We were totally fine with that). But then.....nothing. He dropped off my beer and their 2 sodas AS HE WAS PASSING! He literally dropped them off and kept walking. After that, we didn't see him again. Not once. Another waitress came by and took our food order and then, guess what, we never saw her again either. By this time, 30 minutes has passed since we got our drinks and by now they're empty. We haven't gotten the appetizers we ordered, much less our entrees. We stayed quiet because we never complain, but after another 10 minutes pass, I had to flag down a manager. Apparently I wasn't the only one because another couple did the same thing. The manager was very nice and personally brought our food out, but by that time we decided we were going next door to CPK. She offered us some free cheesecake, but we declined and told her we weren't complaining to get anything free, we just wanted some service and it was ridiculous that whole sections could be ignored for 45 minutes without being noticed. I haven't been back since then."
Aimee G.,"San Jose, CA",4,11,,1.0,3/1/2015,Bar service is horrible! Hour for food and was brought wrong food. Server snapped at us when we asked where our food was. Manager said they are super super behind and apologized but by far worse service ever! Would not recommend.
Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",4,52,,4.0,1/2/2015,I was surprised when I reviewed my reviews.  I love the Cheesecake!  I have had some negative experiences but overall it is good.  I love their BBQ ranch chicken salad and some of the chicken dishes are quite tasty.  It was worth my trying again (again).  Service is usually quite good.
Nadia W.,"San Jose, CA",298,49,15,2.0,12/14/2014,Food is amazing. Service sucks. We were seated and didn't even get checked on for fifteen minutes and the only reason we were checked on is because we said something. Horrible service.
Holly V.,"San Jose, CA",960,489,36,5.0,11/14/2012,"I LOVE THE CHIPOTLE CHICKEN PASTA WITH CRAB BITES if they were to ever ""knock on wood"" take it out of the menu then i wouldnt come here again..  even though they have like the best cheesecake and the sweetest waiters/waitresses.."
Jennifer T.,"San Jose, CA",151,223,169,2.0,11/30/2010,"Why do Americanized restaurants insist on making their Asian dishes extremely salty? WHYYY. PF Chang's, I'm looking at you too! Skip the Crispy Spicy Beef. Or you can to-go this entree, just be sure to have a batch of rice ready at home because this plate is SALTY. Disappointing. My sister's pasta, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, was too bland. I think she lost about 2 lbs from pumping that salt shaker onto her dish. And it was not only farfelle. We spied several linguini strings, and a couple of pennes. Come on... Service wasn't too bad. Bread was constantly refilled, which was nice. But they gave my BF the wrong beer. I hate that I had to wait to tell her that this is the wrong beer, and then wait another 10 minutes to have her get the beer. :(  I usually enjoy Cheesecake Factory too. :( Maybe it's just this one."
