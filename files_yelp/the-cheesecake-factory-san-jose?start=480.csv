Vaishali S.,"Mountain View, CA",44,189,2,1.0,7/12/2014,"I ordered curbside pickup with my friends about 2 months ago. The order process, picking up, speed was all fine. When I got home and started eating, I discovered my turkey burger was not cooked all the way through. It was very pink on the inside. I called the restaurant and informed them right away. They offered to replace it but since I had driven 15 miles to pick up the food in the first place I passed (not to mention my appetite was gone). The person on the phone then offered me a gift card as compensation so I accepted. He took all of my information and said it would be in the mail that week. I never got anything. I called back 2 times over the last month and left messages...still no reply. I won't be returning to this location."
A K.,"Chicago, IL",0,22,,3.0,4/22/2015,"0 star for food 5 star for personable staff 5 star for cleanliness and nice setup Sat at the bar. Ordered tacos, fish tacos or burritos I believe, its been a good 1 year plus.  There was some rice that comes with it, the rice was dry as if it was from yesterday.  The server came and asked, how is everything, I let the server know, that was the last I saw of the server, I had to ask for the check from another server.  Two of the managers also came to ask, how was everything, and I told them the problem, I basically did not eat the food.  One of the managers said that they will give me fresh rice when they cook some, OK I will wait an hour for some lousy steamed rice.  Yes, and the bread I got was rock hard, someone could break their teeth. Beautiful setup.  But so many people available to run around asking people how food was, but not enough people in the kitchen.  I see many people seem to like this place, I will have to say that I got unlucky."
Azizi A.,"Newport Beach, CA",126,578,1735,3.0,10/25/2013,"This review may be bias, since I am not a fan of chain restaurants. There is a extremely large selection of food on the menu. It's too many options for me, I don't like going through the entire menu, it gets confusing. My favorite dish on the menu is the chicken Madera, It's delicious, and the only thing I like to order here. I've learned how to make it, so I make it at home now. One thing I really don't like about this place is the wait time and the inaccurate time wait estimates. I do recommend coming here for some dessert!  the signature cheesecakes are good but if you have had it before try something different! like a slice of chocolate cake and a glass of tea ;) if your coming just for dessert & its too busy for you to wait consider sitting at the bar."
Kimberly F.,"San Jose, CA",178,37,19,5.0,9/9/2012,"Great food, nice decoration, great service. Moderate price for what you get. I absolutely love this place and will come back again. I could not wish or request anything better."
Kristine A.,"Monte Sereno, CA",275,404,97,1.0,10/10/2013,"I love the outdoor seating. What I don't love is them over charging me (26.32 to be exact) for my mediocre dinner. And I made the mistake of using my visa instead of amex. Horrible service. Never ever coming here again. What a shame, I do love this location due to them having outdoor seating."
Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",285,689,138,3.0,8/10/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is just OK. I like that it's super close to home and convenient if we're going to see a movie at the cinema next door or happen to be shopping... and their dessert menu (as is the case with the entire chain) is pretty delicious. The entrees at ALL locations are pretty nasty and overpriced, so unless you are on a mission to waste money or see how many calories you can consume in one sitting, I'd avoid them entirely and stick to appetizers/drinks/dessert. This location specifically has a few negatives that are worth pointing out: 1. Less clean than your average mall restaurant. The tables and menus are almost always sticky. Gross. 2. Service generally blows. There are lots of frazzled employees who always seem to either be new trainees or folks who just don't give a sh#t unless they deem you a big tipper. For instance, if you let your waitress know in advance that you're not there for an entree (appetizer/drink/dessert only), they will treat you like an annoyance from that point forward. This tends to mean not bringing any bread out, forgetting drink orders entirely and rushing you out with a check before you've received all your food. 3. It's LOUD. OH SO LOUD. That is expected with most chain restaurants, and especially those located in a mall, but it's still annoying. I would not come here for anything special or intimate, but for location alone I still drop by from time to time when we want to split an over-the-top dessert."
Veronica H.,"San Jose, CA",72,182,2,4.0,9/21/2013,"I came here for a birthday celebration. Overall I had a good experience, the waiter was very nice and friendly. The meal was good, and the cheese cake was fantastic. I had the warm asparagus salad which I thought was very good. It was light and had a great lemon flavoring to it. I also had the lemon crusted chicken (pretty sure it is called something else on the menu). It was very good, also light but great flavor. The mashed potatoes are very good - I love the chunks of potatoes in them. It also came with vegetables that were cooked perfectly. The portion was very large so I had enough for dinner plus two more meals afterwards (although not as good heated up the next day). Cons - long wait - it was freezing - bring a sweater Pros - great selection of food - quality of food - Cheesecake selection and quality - friendly staff"
Marilyn P.,"Gilroy, CA",36,124,2,3.0,6/16/2013,"I've dined at Cheesecake many times at all different locations and their service has always been decent. The only problem here is the wait to be seated, especially during dinner time and on weekends. So what do I do? I always eat at the bar area since its first come first serve, and I only wait to seated in the dining area when I go with a group of more than four people.  I like their menu because of the variety they offer. Of the pastas I have tried, my favorite is the Jambalaya. I did have the filet mignon last night and it was pretty good as well. I especially like the bread here!  As for cheesecake, it's of course delicious although I hardly ever order since I'm not a desert fan. For a chain restaurant, their food is pretty good."
Travis W.,"San Jose, CA",23,18,5,5.0,7/18/2014,"Just another great Cheesecake Factory, they have some good talented staff. Very personable, Jonathan is a cool guy, hope you get him too"
Jennifer L.,"San Jose, CA",163,75,29,2.0,11/11/2012,"Cheesecake factory! I just want to say right now that this review is based mostly on the service. The food was great and the cheesecake was deliciousss! But the service....it needs a bit of work. You would think that it would be better since it's such a fancy large chain restaurant, right? Well, I went here for a surprise birthday dinner for my friend, who was currently derping around in the mall until our table was ready. We came in and they said 30 minute wait for 8 people. Keep in mind that this was at 5pm, so it wasn't crowded yet. There was clearly a plethora of seats available. Mmm, okay, we thought. 30 minute wait for 8 people? Not bad!!! So we waited. And finally, 45 minutes later, they tell us that our table is getting ready. Awesome! 45 minutes is still not bad. So we waited some more. A total of one hour passes by, and the people at the front tell us that it will be soon. Uh, okay.  Parties of 6 and 7 people got their table before us.  15 minutes later, we approach them and ask for our table. THEN we get our table. Sooo it took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our table when we were told it was going to be a 30  minute wait, and in between the 30 minutes and the 1.15 hours, they told us that it would 'just be a couple more minutes'. Thanks.. Our waiter was a very very quiet young guy. We're a party of 8 for crying out loud. SPEAK UP!!! We didn't even hear him ask us if we wanted bread. He is taking our order when my friend asks for a Sprite. So he goes to put it in the computer. Then..he leaves. For 5 minutes. UH... WHAT? You were in the middle of taking our order!! WHY THE HELL DID YOU LEAVE??? So he comes back like it was NO BIG DEAL and continues to finish our order. Oh yeah, and my friend didn't even get his Sprite till 20 minutes through the dinner. It was hard to find him throughout the night. And when we ordered cheesecake, we asked for 1 additional minute. ONE. MINUTE. And he leaves, and comes back 15 minutes later. Uh.............. Thanks for giving us 14 additional minutes.... Sorry for the 12 dollar tip. But, I couldn't bring myself to give more. Maybe next time, when there's better service. Food was great, though. Loved the fettuccine alfredo!"
Dee P.,"San Jose, CA",61,51,,2.0,2/24/2013,"I went to this location on Fed. 15th with my half sister.  We received EXCELLENT service from one waitress. I don't remember her name, but she was tall, thin, and possibly Caucasian. She wore a Loony Tunes tie. She was awesome! She suggested healthy food options, gave a very motivational talk with my sister who was trying to diet and lose weight, she was very patient with me in helping me choose the perfect cheese cake... she was great!  HOWEVER, here's when the bad comes. The awesome waitress was off work when we got there so, then that's when she was replaced by waitress number 2. She was a overweight chick with a bad attitude. She didn't check on us ONCE, didn't fill our drinks, didn't do nothing!  Our first waitress was so wonderful we wanted to give her a $20 tip. However, we decided to leave no tip in fear that the heavier waitress would take it. She really didn't deserve it and wasn't good at all. She got an attitude with us when we canceled our cheese cake orders. She was just... bad.  The food was pretty good. I enjoyed it enough to go back.  Oh and awkward moment: I told my half sister I thought one of the waiters was extremely cute. My half sister (who had one too many glasses of wine) randomly told the waiter I thought he was cute. I literally died from humiliation lol. If your reading this: Sorry about that!"
mong linh n.,"San Jose, CA",176,356,2345,4.0,3/16/2011,"this was my ""fine dining"" during my high school years. =P  it has a great atmosphere to say so.  during dinner time, it may get pretty packed, and especially on wknds.  sucks, that they dont take reservations. anyway, i dine here occasionally.  i have never been disappointed with the food nor the service.   ive tried numerous items on the menu, and there isnt anything on here that i would say is badddd.   their pasta is to die for.  louisiana chicken pasta is my favorite tho.  bow tie pasta with creamy sauce topped with huge slices of fried chicken.   their fried mac and cheese is interesting.  it comes in 3 balls or was it 4.  regardless, id say one ball per person is good enuff.   their diane steak is yum for its price range.   OoOo TAMALES!  is yum!  ok, i dont have the time to list out everything ive tried because theres just so much!  but, i think you get the picture. =P   they're pretty generous with their sides.  everytime i order mash, it takes up like most of my plate. and, how could you come here and not have a slice of the many selections of cheesecakes!  (GO RED VELVET CHEESECAKE!!)"
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,3.0,7/12/2011,meh.. I am not really a fan of the cheesecake factory and their crazy large portions but this one is a lot less crowded than the one at Vally Fair  overall decent customer service  food was okay
Lauren P.,"Danville, CA",100,171,27,4.0,12/25/2014,"My go to place to meet a friend for appetizers and drinks. Great selection of cocktails and wine. I love their samosa appetizer, ahi tartar and salads. I tried the buffalo chicken, but didn't really like it."
Christine D.,"Crockett, CA",116,304,132,5.0,6/23/2014,"I am just going to say it. I love the Cheesecake factory food. The portions are a good size so I always have lunch for the next day. I do have to admit I do not always order the cheese cake for dessert because I am always so dang full after eating my meal! I have come here for early lunch, dinners and late supper and am always pleased with whatever I order. Yes, the menu is like a book, but once you get over how much is on it and if you frequent this place like I do, you will eventually find your favorites and never be disappointed. The drawbacks, there is always a wait. It is loud inside the restaurant and parking can be a problem because most Cheesecake Factories are at the big malls."
Star S.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,1.0,5/19/2014,"Wow. Never have I ever looked at Cheesecake Factory in a negative light until I recently ordered something for pick up today.  It was irritating to be put on hold and forgotten for 7 minutes when I called to place the order and had to recall. But I let it go because it happens. But when I showed up to pick up my order I walked up to the Bakery and pick up counter and there was a man working there that was busy, turned around, looked at me and turned and continued what he was doing. Not a hello. Nothing. Okay. So then another man came over, light purple button up looking like he's a ""supervisor"" looked at me, and continued on WHILE talking to his coworker. THEN a female came along, did the same thing. All three completely ignored me. I was stunned. So at this point, I stood there stunned while a larger man with a ponytail and beard came over and asked me if anyone had asked me if I needed help.Thank you Jesus! I'm not dead after all! I was starting to feel like Patrick Swayze in friggn Ghost dude. I looked at the two men while I replied ""No, I""m waiting to pick up an order"" so then this bearded dude says ""I'm sorry, they are boxing your order right now"" and I say thank you. Then I overheard him telling the guy to say hello to customers or something like that, it was hushed, and I heard the dude say ""I did""....so Mr. bearded ponytail man, you're employing a liar. You should know. Through his damn teeth.  Now...unless the person boxing my food was creating a box out of organic recycled material himself back there, there's no way it was ""being boxed"" because I sat and waited for a half hour. Keep in mind I have a half hour lunch break. I called at 12:15 pm and was told it would be ready in 15-20 min. So I show up at 12:35. Long story short, I sit, wait, Mr. Purple shirt ""manager"" looks at me a few times, no one says a damn thing. People come and go. Life moved along. FINALLY about 2 seconds before I'm about to leave without my food or paying because I am..SO pissed,, a boy comes out with two to-go bags, rings up like the third person before me and doesn't say I darn thing. Really? Okay I will walk over and ask. Sure as hell my order is chillin there. I literally had to say ""is that mine?"" to get my stuff. My lukewarm, 45 minute, insanely not worth it, stuff. DO NOT tell a client that something is being ""boxed up"" if its barely being thrown in a pan. I would rather hear ""Hey we're sorry, it's gonna be a little longer""or whatever. My God the whole thing start to finish was just horrible. What an insanely multi tiered display of bad customer service. I won't order there again."
Morgan M.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,10,3,1.0,1/11/2015,"If you can avoid it, try your best not to order curbside to go during dinner time. I have had countless bad experiences with this particular branch where we've waited over 30 minutes past the pick up time that they set."
Guille D.,"Los Gatos, CA",18,267,227,4.0,1/10/2014,"Yummy experience, enjoy the all you can eat warm bread.. place was clean, friendly staff. Got parking quickly, but can be a hassle with it being a huge mall. Good food!"
Sandy B.,"Ventura, CA",100,23,17,4.0,4/5/2013,"Nice Restaurant, have been here last week and had classic burger. I ordered it well done. Some was burnt but the taste was so good."
Chelsea H.,"San Jose, CA",16,38,27,4.0,9/10/2013,"Three words - Crispy Crab Wontons. Like seriously, so good. I order these almost every time I go to Cheesecake Factory. Most of their other appetizers are delicious as well. I recommend the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Flatbread Pizzas.  Entree-wise, their Chicken Romano, Cobb Salad, and Chicken Madeira are really good. They also make a mean Long Island Iced Tea. And if after all of that deliciousness, you have room for dessert, then their world-famous cheesecake menu will absolutely have something for you!"
