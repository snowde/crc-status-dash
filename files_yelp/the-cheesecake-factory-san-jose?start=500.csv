Shawn S.,"San Jose, CA",212,233,460,3.0,7/2/2013,"Oh Cheesecake, the king of desserts and also king of -I will kill your diet and make you gain back those 10 pounds you took forever to lose. I always love the cheesecake here and frequently order to go. The togo line tonight was really slow. They do have a case of over 15 types of cheesecakes and other cakes for you to choose from. Prices range from 6 dollars to around 8 dollars. I KNOW its expensive but trust me, the fatty cheesecake and creamy goodness is sooo worth it.  As for the restaurant itself, it is very dark. Also, it will take you forever to get seated. This restaurant, particularly at night is border line OMG I can't see!  After you do manage to get a table (expect a 1 hr wait on weekday nights and over 2 hours for weekends), you will get seated. My server took forever to come check up on our orders which is ok I guess, until I noticed that the waiter was usually always at the table down from us. I want special treatment too!  The portions here are huge! I frequently get the pasta to share with a friend. Trust me, spitting the calories will make you feel less guilty afterwards.  The food in my opinion is just ok, there isn't anything special. The only thing that makes Cheesecake Factory worth going for is the Cheesecake. This place lives up to its name so if you haven't tried the cheesecake, order a slice togo! My favorites are 30th anniversary, tirumisu, pineapple upside down, and godiva chocolate.  If you're thinking about dining here on the other hand, expect ok service and ok food."

Angelina B.,"San Jose, CA",9,16,22,2.0,11/10/2015,the guy at the register for cheesecakes was too into talking to other coworkers than to acknowledge customers.
Mike N.,"Chicago, IL",763,112,92,5.0,5/15/2014,"First off: this 5 star rating is not so much for the food as it is for the amazing service we received. For the food I'd give justttttt about a 4. closer to a 3.5 but combined with the service, that's enough to have me coming back for seconds. I can honestly say I don't remember the last time that my service was as memorable as this time. Our server seemed to fit right in with my friends and I as we randomly chose cheesecake factory as our restaurant to have dinner. We originally were about to go to boston market to have a healthy meal, but I am most certainly glad we did not. We were seated promptly by our hostess and immediately met Amy who we found out would be our server for the night. She gave us excellent recommendations as my friends and I were struggling to figure out what we wanted to eat. One of my friends was torn between 2 dishes. One of which she told us was not in the menu and claimed to be even better than his favorite miso salmon. Somehow we ended up convincing him to just get both. I had a hard time deciding on which salad I wanted and she went through the salads and seemed particularly enthusiastic about one of them and I was sold. Ended up ordering a pretty big meal for 3 people but she made everything sound so good we figured we'd just pack up the leftovers for later. Food came out and just to show how personable she is, she stuck with us till my friend ate the new thai salmon dish and let her know if what she claimed was true. Unfortunately we still feel like the miso salmon is better but the thai was still very good. we all laughed and had a good time. We had the fried mac n cheese which always a yummy appetizer. eating my salad made me realize why  she was so enthusiastic about it. it was hella bomb. the marinated steak salad. the steak was done just right. I wanted medium rare but she said that the steak in the salads always came the same way and they're just right so i trusted her and voila. amazing salad. my other friend ordered the grilled pork chop and he said it was mouth watering as every bite kind of just melted in his mouth. and yea, the pork was that soft. all in all a very satisfying meal. OH! almost forgot about our midway meal appetizer. We all kind of wanted to order another ""semi-healthy"" appetizer so we asked amy to accommodate us by randomly picking one for us she thought we'd like. she came back a minute later with a small list. and again. as she listed them, she got particularly excited about the stuffed mushrooms, so we all went ooooooo...and she then informed us that they were hella good and she loved them. sold once again. well that is pretty much it. an eating experience that never had a dull moment all thanks to a server that either loves her job or is really good at pretending she does. she was able to make us all feel comfortable and welcomed. so much so that we felt like we were dining at home. Thanks for everything amy! we'll be back!"
Christopher J.,"San Jose, CA",3,13,1,1.0,7/16/2014,"Wow, was i extremly disapointed today when i went, a group of 9 people including me went for lunch and our waiter was terrible, he messed up everything, forgot a salad misplaced 3 teas gave my girlfriend the wrong tea, gave a birthday cheesecake to someone not the birthday girl. Not to mention messed up the check, we wont return to this location, sorry cheesecake factory you definatly need help"
Tina B.,"Patterson, CA",5000,152,90,4.0,10/31/2012,"My favorite here is the pasta da vinci and four cheese pasta. It is always good except for one time that my four cheese pasta came out tasting pretty salty. They were nice enough to give me that meal for free (Thanks to the manager).  The bread and butter is really good too. I like the caesar salad. I think everything here taste good. THE AMF here is really strong, I love it, Took a couple sips and I was feeling a head change.But I do noticed, the more AMF or drinks you order, the less alcohol they put in. I guess they just want their customers to drink responsibly and not yack all over the place. Parking sucks but they do valet."
Valencia G.,"Union City, CA",29,36,3,3.0,9/8/2014,"I agree with a lot of the reviews. Have come here during the week at 8-830 at night and still have a twenty minute wait even though the restaurant itself isn't packed. Then more waiting to place food orders, more waiting to get drinks, more waiting to get food and more waiting to pay the bill. Completely agree that the staff is inattentive. The only upside is when I did get my meals (have been here twice) they were hot still."
Michelle C.,"San Jose, CA",783,465,1491,3.0,5/22/2010,"Yeah I know. It's a chain.  I went out for strawberry martinis with girls last night and while they are delightful, such a let down for the following reasons: 1. $12 for one? Really? Who do you think you are?; Santana row? I think not. Hand crafted you say. Aren't by definition all drinks one order custom? Wow- you put strawberries in a blender.  2. If I wanted to drink kool-aid, I'd do it at home.  3. I don't like sugar. This drink comes with half a sugar rim. That's fine. It's a girly drink. I get it. But don't not garnish my second drink with the sugar rim. I'm paying $12 remember? Let me decide which side to sip from."
Samantha K.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,424,441,4.0,4/5/2013,"I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory when I am traveling to Los Angeles - or Newport Beach, but rarely go to one closer to home.   The problem with that I usually go for dinner...and never get to eat their awesome cheese cake.  Their entree size always seems to fill me up ... So I found myself by this Cheesecake Factory around 9:30 at night.....and craving cheesecake, we stopped.  And I ordered their cheescake-carrot cake dessert with their awesome ice tea and it was wonderful.  Decor was nice......Service was friendly (they were also surprised we just stopped by for dessert but most happy to be of good service.) Can't speak for the food (or we probably would not have had room for cheesecake) but their cheesecake is awesome."
Anosha S.,"San Jose, CA",20,209,12,4.0,1/6/2011,"I love love their cheesecake!! May fav is the Godiva with a side of raspberry sauce which was once recommended by a server. I also really like their bownie sundae and red velvet.  I really like their calamari, tuna taretare appetizers and for entree the four cheese pasta, club sandwhich, and louisianna pasta with chicken are all great!! They also have a lively bar area which is where I prefer sitting when going with my boyfriend!"
Timothy T.,"Morgan Hill, CA",3,33,14,5.0,5/3/2014,"This place has great food, good service and is very nice and clean. A little expensive but its worth it to go some times. The cheesecake is great and they make great burgers."
Karen D.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,,5.0,5/16/2014,"Ok, maybe it isn't always 5 stars, but where can you go that has a zillion things on the menu and every dish is consistently good. Seriously, I have never had a bad meal here whether it is a salad or main course. Yes, once in awhile you get French fries that come out cold, but it is usually the exception.  The servers are always pleasant. The management seems to care.  One time there was an accident with my entree (think they dropped it) so the Manager came and explained the delay and gave me a choice of a house salad or soup to eat while I waited.  Those of you that complain you have to wait to be seated- really?  You should always expect a wait. It's because the foods good!  (Refer to sentence 1)"
Claudia M.,"Alachua, FL",50,19,12,5.0,7/26/2012,"I never went before i did bought cheesecake so yummy.  always wanted to give it a try back in Florida but it was way to far from where we used to live. Now we live here my friends invited me. I was so escited  Yay!   me & my friends  got  orange chicken, thai lettuce wraps &  wasabi steak yum yum!  The piñas coladas is a mustr try!!! Plus we had free cheesecake!!! We didn't know why? maybe  because they didn't have any pineapple for my piña colada glass. We were like ok!  second time went with hubby he ordered cajun jambalaya pasta. Even my kids meals were great.  So far  very good."
Nastasia D.,"San Jose, CA",20,8,2,5.0,4/29/2014,"We ordered the mushroom appetizer in a wine reduction sauce,  it was really amazing- if they had this ina full size meal I would be going here just for that.  I also ordered the Alfredo with shrimp. It was well prorated and not really gray like some other restaurants prepare it.  Had some Montross to go with the food because it was a warm night. Overall the food was great,  the server was very attentive.  If you come on a Friday night (like we did) prepare for they're to be a crowd in the reception area, and if you can't snatched a bat table,  the wait could be around an hour long.  So make reservations - especially if you have a large group.  The food and service was amazing but this is a more black and white affair restaurant. So prepare do dress up a bit -as well as pay more a bit.  This is a 4$ kind of restaurant, more for like special events."
Kylie C.,"Campbell, CA",249,53,54,3.0,9/25/2014,I would have to only give 3 stars because our service wasn't awful it just took soooooo long for everything! We came here for my brothers birthday and 3 hours later we were able to leave. Drinks even took forever and I didn't even get silverware till more then half way through my meal. I wouldn't completely cut them out of my restaurant possibilities but this location needs to step up on their timing.
Shane M.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/2/2015,"Don't come here often but our waiter Chet was excellent. Food was pretty standard, nothing great, definitely not bad. 5 star waiter, 3 star grub."
Monica A.,"San Jose, CA",1,16,18,4.0,5/17/2014,Giving it 4 because the food was lovely until I tried the rice seemed very dull no flavor and had only like 3 shrimps on my Jamaican black chicken pepper other than that it was an awesome place to bring my friends
Kari D.,"Scotts Valley, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/5/2015,"Came in tonight and had a great experience. Our server who i believe was named Derrick, tall older man with glasses was good! My boyfriend and I drove 30 minutes to have dinner together and we enjoyed our time. He was attentive and very well spoken. I did take my time with ordering my dinner since I was just focused on my appetizer but he gave me those extra 5 minutes i needed to enjoy my food without rushing. We just did hot chocolate for our dessert because we were so full from dinner and he brought extra napkins, cleaned any spills. Not just our server was good, but other staff were friendly. I had an older black gentleman who i first saw at the host stand, not sure if he was a server, grab me some extra sauce because I saw him walk by and my server was busy he got it for me and was very polite about it, while some people hate that.  If you want to try a great appetizer, try the ahi tartare, i promise you won't be disappointed. That is actually the only reason my boyfriend and i made the drive. We were craving it and we walked out very happy. Although i won't give it a 5 star because every time i get the burger and ask for med-well i always get well done, which isn't the best for me, but everything else was good i didnt feel like sending it back. Hope i get this same experience next time."
Jordan D.,"San Jose, CA",2,9,2,4.0,10/21/2013,"One of my favorite local restaurants!  The bar is nice and so is the dining experience. I love the cheesecakes, ugh my weakness.  There should be a little more variety dish-wise but still some good options to choose from. I always love coming here. The waiters and Hosts are always kind and helpful Pros: Good dining experience amazing drinks cheesecake, mmm Cons: Very cold I noticed  Wait can sometimes be awhile"
Faith C.,"Gilroy, CA",1,14,3,5.0,4/26/2015,"Food is always good & relatively fast. I don't mind waiting a little bit, considering the portions & taste. The last time my mom, aunt, & I went Birdie was our waitress. She was a very good waitress. Consistent with us!"
