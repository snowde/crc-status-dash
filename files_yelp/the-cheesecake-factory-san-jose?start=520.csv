Paulina M.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/16/2012,We haven't been to the cheese cake factory for a few years and decided to try it again. They have this new skinny menu and we ordered the Asian lettice wrap tacos. It came with three pretty big tacos and he sauce was amazing with it. Such an extensive menu which is good cause ur guaranteed to find what u want. The gumbo with the sausage wad amazing and we did a side of mashed potatoes instead of the rice. But the best part was our server. She answered all our questions and recommended to put the mashed potatoes on the side. She really knows what she is doing and has the perfect timing. Always around when u needed her and very attentive. We recommended u always sit with Elizabeth! It's away better when u have a great server. Had to yelp her and let the manager know she was amazing.  Hope u all enjoy ur dinner at the cheese cake factory in Oakridge.
Natalie B.,"San Jose, CA",55,15,,5.0,7/27/2012,"The food here is always perfect. Every time I go I try something different and I haven't found anything I didn't like. For soup of the day, I've had the mushroom soup and the baked potato soup, and they were both delicious. Cheesecake Factory has a large, eclectic menu, so it's good no matter what you're hungry for. I recommend the Factory Chopped Appetizer Salad; it's like a meal, really. The service is always great as well. We often get take out, which I also recommend."
Jamie F.,"Stockton, CA",4,27,9,4.0,8/2/2013,"Who doesn't like the Cheesecake Factory? Service is always good, we always eat more than we should, and the atmosphere is great with the dim lights and high back booths...  Warning: the red velvet cheesecake is not as good as it looks, ok but not great"
Brad G.,"Capitola, CA",144,6,,1.0,1/15/2015,I had the worst service by a tiny little man in all white. Forgot half our order then claimed to be management. We left in discussed. It was almost like this tiny little guy with a goatee had it in for us. Can't believe you employ such people. The food we did receive was ok
Dayna P.,"San Jose, CA",2,30,2,4.0,9/25/2013,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. Especially ones decorated like a Vegas casino coffeeshop. But this place is an exception.  I am a Cheesecake Purist...so I don't actually come here for the cheesecake...too many ""designer"" cheesecakes. I do, however, enjoy the LemonCello dessert. As a creature of habit, it seems I only order one of three of things: Luau Salad, Cuban Sandwhich, or Sweetcorn Tamale Cakes. I wish I could eat them all in one visit, but that's just not possible.  I never even finish one item...love those leftovers! I'm sure the other 9000 menu items are good, too. Its just that the very large menu is a bit overwhelming to go through. Something for everyone,  I suppose."
Sandra L.,"San Jose, CA",250,475,1495,4.0,1/3/2011,The wait was short at 1:30pm on a weekday. Food was good. The bread was awesome as it just came out of the oven. Grilled fish tacos were good. The tortilla was warm and slightly crispy. Fish was cooked just right and seasoned well. Coconut cheesecake was yummy.
Veronica C.,"San Jose, CA",261,684,68,5.0,2/26/2012,"Honestly, I generally have an average experience here. I love that they have so many food choices here, but that also makes it hard for me to decide what to pick. But I don't think I've ever been disappointed by the food here, especially the molasses bread! Service on the other hand has been generally courteous, but a little slow. However, this time around, our waitress went above and beyond. Unfortunately, we didn't tip as much as I had hoped due to some bad math. I had ordered the steak and eggs for lunch and my dish ended up being the last one to come out. To make up for it, our waitress brought me my hashed potatoes first so I could eat while my friends were eating. Eventually, the rest of my meal came, but my steak was not what I was expecting at all! It was some strange, sweet marinade grilled flank. And on top of that, it was cold, but my sunny side up eggs were hot. Not sure what happened to my dish, and I wasn't going to complain about it, but our waitress happened to walk by when I said the meat was cold, and she said she would immediately get it fixed. She let me keep my dish, and about 15 minutes later, brought a small plate of properly cooked and well seasoned steak to me. Now that's what I'm talking about! It was delicious! When we got the bill later, she had taken my plate off! Amazing! I wasn't expecting that since it wasn't her fault, but the chef's, but I really appreciated that. It's really too bad we didn't tip her more, but she singlehandedly restored my faith in the Cheesecake Factory!"
Melissa G.,"San Jose, CA",81,10,2,1.0,7/9/2013,"OKAY, so usually this is my husband and mine go to place to just get away from the kiddies, quick bite to eat with a few drinks.... I love their Oreo cheesecake!!! But the service was bad, I mean, I don't expect much usually, it is Cheesecake Factory, but man... Our waitress brought me the wrong drink, the bus boy or another server brought out the right drink and apologized 10 MINUTES LATER, the spinach dip was blah, we waited 30-45 minutes for our dinners to be served after the appetizer even though we ordered all our food at the same time, our waitress was slow... to say it kindly.   Gotta find a new go to spot, sad to say!!"
Jacob T.,"San Jose, CA",4,23,9,1.0,11/7/2014,Horrible pick up service. No staff. Messed up on order. Something that they said will be ready in 20mins took 55mins.
Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",446,567,3746,5.0,3/8/2014,"Upon reaching the front from the mall entrance, I was promptly greeted by three smiling hostesses and seated with no wait whatsoever at 6pm on a Thursday night. Our waiter Dustin D was detail oriented and refilled our water at least four times! This was my first visit at the Oakridge location and I was not disappointed. Prior to my dinner, I had yelped regarding customer service and learned about fantastic waiters being on the restaurant's training team. I am completely convinced Dustin is on it. He waited patiently while we decided on appetizers (one of my friends is a vegetarian), so patiently that I had to ask him for a bit more time. We were ready to order when he arrived with our drinks (four waters, one no ice) and he clearly stated the Caesar dressing has anchovies in it, in case we had issues with that. After my friend ordered her veggie burger, he questioned if I was ok with how the Chicken Bellagio was prepared (pan fried chicken, prosciutto, etc.). The calamari was brought out immediately after, crisp and tasty, but who can go wrong with fried calamari? I did expect a garlic aioli but it seems they exchanged that with a mere cream dip. After the Caesar salad arrived, Dustin checked back to see how the appetizers were. We hadn't touched the salad yet, so I said we were still working on it. He said he wanted to make sure everything was ok. I also asked for fresh Parmesan when my meal arrived, which was brought over immediately. Our waters were never empty for longer than five minutes. When dessert time came around, I ordered the ultimate red velvet and white chocolate blueberry cheesecakes to go while a friend ordered carrot cake to go. Our apps and meals were boxed for us and we were asked if there was anything else they could help us with. Our waiter truly cared if our dining experience was up to our standards, and I'm grateful it was since one of our party was a first timer for the food."
Amy T.,"San Jose, CA",360,63,31,3.0,1/22/2014,"My sister, my cousin, and I decided to come eat here Tuesday night for our monthly catch-up dinner. We were seated immediately. Our server, Junno, was super sweet and patient with us -especially since we had very complicated orders.  My cousin and I were probably most excited for our side orders of mashed potatoes with wasabi butter but 5 minutes after we ordered it, our server came back to tell us they had run out of wasabi butter. That was the first disappointment of the night. My sister ordered a steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. As she began eating it, she then realized it was cooked super well done. So we flagged down our server and he was very apologetic, and immediately brought her plate back to the kitchen to be re-cooked. The manager then approached our table shortly after and was extremely apologetic and sweet. He even told us to save room because he wanted to give us a dessert on the house. The service alone from this point deserved 5 stars on its own because not only were they genuinely apologetic for the minor mistakes, but they even remade my sisters steak, and the manager offered a dessert on the house. We then ordered a red velvet cheesecake in the end and just like déjà vu, the server came back 5 minutes later to tell us that the red velvet flavor was all gone. So we decided on a different flavor. However, the bill then came out and we were charged for the dessert! I'm sure it was  a genuine, honest mistake, but still... It was the fact that the manager had already told us we would receive a dessert on the house. By this point though, it was already 15 minutes until closing, and we're not cheap people so we weren't going to interrupt the busy manager just to comp our dessert.. Overall, the server was great; he did his job very well and it obviously wasn't his fault that certain foods were all gone. On the other hand, no wasabi butter, no red velvet cheesecake, and forgetting to comp our dessert when they promised us it would be, are good enough reasons to take away 2 stars. But I feel like we just came here on a bad night. We've eaten here plenty of times and 8 out of 10 times, I've had a great experience nonetheless."
Linda L.,"San Francisco, CA",274,109,116,4.0,3/2/2013,"I see a lot of reviews complaining about the wait time. There is ALWAYS going to be a wait at this place so don't come here if you can't wait for about 45-60 minutes. If you can wait at Boiling Crab for an hour, you can wait for an hour here. Besides, you're at Macy's so go shop.  I've came here at least 3 times the past few months. And we (bf and I) always share the same two dishes:  Shepard's pie and Mac n Cheese Burger.  I swear, best burger I've had. We always get the burger medium rare (so juicy!) with fried mac n cheese balls between the buns. Plus, the fried mac n cheese balls were featured in Food Network before!  Shepard's pie. I loved it - the flavor, the beef, mash potatoes. Yum!  They're both huge portions IMO, we always have leftovers for the next day. The waiters are nice."
Mindy N.,"San Jose, CA",7,25,4,3.0,2/22/2013,"Looked at my to-go food at home and felt like I just dealt with a 2 face! OK, let me start from the beginning.  I called in my to-go order and spoke with a very friendly guy by the name of Joe.  He was courteous, attentive, pleasant - everything you want in a waiter.  I had ordered a burger with a side of honey mustard, jambalaya for my husband, calamari for appetizer and a tiramisu cheesecake for desert.  He reviewed my order at the end, asking if I had needed utensils and also confirmed that I needed the extra honey mustard sauce.  Once confirmed, I felt good going there to pick it up. They have curb side pick up, which is great because this mall can be crazy packed at around 7:00 p.m. for dinner.  I waited on the curb for a good 5-7 minutes before I started to get worried.  I called them up to let them know I was waiting, and a few minutes later, someone came out with my food.  He, too, was friendly and courteous so I tipped him $5 cash for my to-go.   Got home and saw no utensils or my sauce (I like sauce with my burgers, damn it!).  Believe me when I tell you I was a bit disappointed just because they made it seem like they had everything under control.  Eh, the service was whatever, and my burger was a bit bleh.  Guess I'll try dining in next time, just to see if the service and food will be the same."
Lisa H.,"San Jose, CA",2,30,,1.0,4/5/2012,"I ordered a burger for takeout, then left to go shopping for 20 minutes. When I came back, the food was not ready.The cashier was trying to refund money to an irate customer, but could not get it done correctly. He made me wait for 10 minutes. The other workers were doing nothing, just standing around and refused to walk to the kitchen to bring out my bag of food because it ""wasn't their job"". These people are completely incompetent! I will not be going back."
Mark S.,"Long Beach, CA",77,8,17,1.0,5/6/2015,"20 min wait at the door with empty sections, 20 min wait for drinks, 20 minute wait for server to attend to us. Management needs to be checked. At least 6 servers / bussers passed our table without acknowledging refills or clearing our dirty dishes for 15 min. Servers Soo focused on the 25 top next to us that our table is forgotten. I come to a place like this, not because of the food, but to see what the service is like since it is soo corporate and should have valuable management that trains these servers. Thanks but no thanks, rather go to mcdonalds.  Delivers food and doesn't buss table prior. They should be happy I just don't walk out!"
Angeline K.,"Tustin, CA",920,955,270,2.0,11/24/2010,"I've never been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory (the exception being, of course, their cheesecake), and I like this location even less because the service is so slow.  Sat at the bar because I was in a bit of a hurry and couldn't wait for a regular table.  It had to have been at least 30 minutes before the APPETIZER came out.  Horrible!  The food isn't worth the wait either.  The dough on my lunch size pizza was soggy and my salad was limp.  I find that when a restaurant has a menu as extensive as Cheesecake Factory, the food is usually mediocre... with huge portions, so a you get a lot of mediocre food for you buck.  There's no way a single restaurant can be good at making so many different types of dishes. Cheesecake Factory should stick to what they're known for: cheesecake!"
Cossette P.,"Morgan Hill, CA",173,360,1743,4.0,11/24/2010,"I have always been a big fan of CCF...been coming to different locations for many years.  Late Saturday night (it was surprisingly slow at this location) DH and I walked in to have a late night dessert.  Our server Bryan D. was very pleasant and friendly and was always on top of things.  Can't go wrong with their cheesecakes, my favorite is the 30th anniversary.  I prefer coming to this location versus the Valley Fair one...it is less crowded and the servers are friendlier :)"
Heather M.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,96,32,3.0,4/24/2015,"Friday night and finding parking was awful. Eventually we relized we had to find a place in the parking garage. Didn't see an elevator so we walked down (and up) 3 huge flights of stairs. Entry area is packed! Only the two of us so I hope for a fairly short wait. Went to the restroom and saw a waitress go straight from a stall to tie her apron skipping the sink.... eew. Went back to the entry area and found a small section on the bench area to sit my pregnant self down. Waited about 20 or so minutes. Got to the table next to the kitchen. Sound of dishes clattering made me cringe. Waitress shows up. Polite and friendly. Takes drink orders, though forgets the lemon and the cider isn't so cold. Easy to flag down though.  Mini corndogs arrive and are pretty good. Food arrives with a hair in it. No way it's mine or my waitresses, and she gets me a fresh plate. Four extra shrimp on entree not worth the price nor are peeled, but I got my entree for free anyways.  Used the extra discount as an excuse to get a cheesecake to go. Tipped waitress well considering she did a pretty good job. Not her fault someone else was gross."
Leo S.,"Martinez, CA",66,13,4,2.0,9/19/2014,1 star because no 0 option. To hell with this place 80 minutes waiting and no entrees. Unattntive staff. Done and done sad to see. Edited for second star manager took care of the bill
Evelyn R.,"San Jose, CA",130,210,20,4.0,5/1/2012,"This place never fails to disappoint. If you are undecided and do not know where to go for lunch or dinner, The Cheese Cake Factory is an easy pick. The server was nice and attentive, got my food in a timely fashion, and all the extra lemon sauce I could possibly ask for. Today the bread was cold, which it is usually warm so that was a little unusual. The prices are pretty reasonable and the place clean. During lunch time there is almost nobody there so seating and parking are great!"
