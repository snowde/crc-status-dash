Kristina C.,"San Jose, CA",393,53,43,4.0,7/8/2010,"This Review is for their Happy Hour Only. Happy Hour at Cheesecake Factory = Happy Me! From 4-6pm, M-F, Cheesecake Factory has their happy hour in the bar area and I am definitely a new fan! I think happy hour's are the best creation ever and the selection at Cheesecake does not disappoint. They have house wines for $5 a glass, beer for $4, and a few selected cocktails like the Cosmopolitan for $5 as well. They offer two pages of food- the first page is a selection of their full size appetizers for $5! And yes, you get the full size! Fried calamari, sliders, nachos, egg rolls, fried macaroni and cheese balls...I think there were like 10 options. On the back side they offer other food selections ranging from $3.95-6.95 (or something close to that). I had the ahi tuna tartar.....it was good but too small. I recommend ordering from the 1st page of full size appetizers to get your money's worth. All in all, it's the best of Cheesecake quality food for the price of Denny's. It might possibly be the one happy hour spot where you actually get full and need a box to take home the left overs. I will definitely be back!"
E O.,"Emeryville, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/4/2014,Terrible service.. The waitress did not do her job at all. She was very upset to work there and it showed. My friend asked for ketchup and she took mines and gave it to him. Very rude and unacceptable.
Cat H.,"San Jose, CA",29,302,1,4.0,7/27/2015,"I know this is a chain, but I love it. The food is always delicious and service is good. The only problem is there's often a line. But because it's in the mall there are always things to do while you're waiting. The cocktails are good, the bread is pretty good, and the desserts are delicious. There are a number of good desserts if you don't like cheesecake as well."
Dung N.,"San Jose, CA",1420,485,304,4.0,1/10/2010,"I remember having a first date here, a couple of years ago. When I was younger, this would've been considered fancy for high schoolers like myself. The decor is nice and the lights are dim, setting that romantic tone in such a busy restaurant.  I've been back on a number of occasions. My brother and I absolutely love the 'miso salmon'. It's cooked and served to perfection. The miso sauce is so light, yet flavorful, and it makes the whole dish what it is.  There was one time where I decided to try a different dish. I went with the 'shrimp with angel hair'. Although, the shrimp was huge...the dish itself was lacking in flavor. The pasta was bland and it's not something I would order again.  As weird as it is, I've never tried any cheesecakes during any of my visits, until last night. I went on a whim and ordered the 'chocolate raspberry truffle'. It's something you would wanna share with another person because I got sick of it halfway through. It was very thick and I was already full from dinner."
Michael H.,"San Francisco, CA",6,12,,3.0,3/9/2013,I went with a friend from out of state and he had never been to The Cheesecake Factory! So we went to the movies and decided to visit after. We got seated rather fast and that was the only fast part of our meal.  Took a good 10 mins for our server to visit our table to order our drinks and never refilled them.  My friend liked his food but I didn't care for mine.  I have been to a few other locations and will not go back to this location.
Moe F.,"San Jose, CA",159,47,11,4.0,4/18/2013,Service is kind of hit or miss but I have always enjoyed my food. So that is what I am rating. The Kale salad and the beets with goat cheese are to die for! I am a huge fan and would eat it everyday if I could.
bindu m.,"Cupertino, CA",0,48,,2.0,8/19/2015,We went to the San Jose location for lunch and I ordered the battered and fried calamari. it was not crisp and it was cold and tasteless. This is the worst calamari I ever had in all my life. Service was poor. The tiramisu cake was slightly better compared to the calamari. Worst service and worst food ever. Will never return to this location.
Timothy C.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,4.0,3/24/2013,"My wife, son, and I were here for lunch today. Two weeks ago we went to Cheesecake Factory @ Stevens Creek, that waiter was much more caring than today's. Last time we got a small plate with few bread and few banana slices. Today we got regular bread basket (many bread slices inside). Although there were only 6 thin slices of banana, it did make my 16-month old son much happier than today's bread basket. We truly thank for that arrangement. BTW, green tea is actually ""mint green tea"" not vanilla green tea like Japanese style, but the menu and waitress did not remind us. For people such as my wife who is not in love with mint will be a surprise, on the bad side."
Jenn W.,"Morgan Hill, CA",21,13,3,2.0,5/19/2013,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge Mall for my daughter's 9th birthday and for my birthday too.  You need to know that I love this restaurant's food.  Their crab wantons are my favorite appetizer around.  Truthfully, I rarely eat the cheesecake because I don't typically have room left over for dessert. Eating out is more than the food, though.  Service is key.  Today the Cheesecake Factory blew it big time with their service.  Everything started out ok.  We had to wait 35 min for a table, but with a group of 7 on a Sunday night that wasn't unheard of.  Once we were seated our waiter came right over and took our drink order (and we ordered the crab wantons at that time too).  We got our drinks and our waiter told us that our bread was cooking as well as our wantons.  And then he was gone.   Eventually he came back with our wantons and took our dinner orders (still no bread).  Drinks were never refilled.  We did not see our waiter again until after some of our dinner arrived.  Our meals did not come out together.  Both kids meals and 2 of the adult meals came at first.  Then 2 more arrived, but one entree was delivered with chicken, when it was ordered without chicken (chicken had to be added to this entree for an extra charge).  It was taken away to be fixed.  My brother's entree did not arrive, but our waiter told us it was on its way. Well, the kids and one of the adults finished their meals before my husband found the manager and told him that most of us were finished with our meals and 2 of our meals were still missing and that we had never received our bread.  Then the manager disappeared.  The waiter returned with the fixed entree, but still no entree for my brother.  My brother then told the waiter that he is diabetic and had already taken his insulin in anticipation of dinner so he needed to have food pretty much now or he was going to pass out and cause a medical emergency.  Again the waiter disappeared. This time he reappeared with our bread.  Which my brother used as a band-aid to counteract the insulin.  The waiter told us the manager was waiting on the line and that as soon as the entree was ready it would be delivered.  By this time everyone else was finished eating. Eventually my brother did get his food, and the manager removed it from our bill.  My husband pointed out that one other entree was made incorrectly and it took an inordinate amount of time to be fixed and that entree was also removed from our bill.  My daughter and I each received a complementary dessert for our birthdays. Service goes a long way.  Good service will get repeat customers.  Service like this will have us second guessing ever coming back, regardless of how good the crab wantons are."
Michael P.,"San Jose, CA",268,274,1857,5.0,3/6/2014,Bomb food and amazing service tonight filet mignon and this incredible salmon had a couple of drinks and had Jimmy help us out with picking what to eat and he was dead on this guy was not our waiter he was just filling in for this other guy but his customer service was great made our night great time I truly appreciate great service as a business owner myself
Natalie N.,"Salinas, CA",0,18,7,2.0,1/2/2016,I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for awhile now. Always had great service and food. This particular experience wasn't great. My boyfriend and I happened to get a waiter that really didn't pay attention to us most likely because we are young and he probably assumed we don't tip (which was bad on his part) but anyways the main reason for my review was because they got my order wrong which I totally understand happens from time to time no big deal. I had the right food but wrong noodles. I was going to suck it up and just eat the meal but I tasted the noodles and they tasted way weird and were awkwardly green. I wasn't going to pay for something that I wasn't going to enjoy. Long story short they took my food and brought me out my other dish and the meal basically had no food.. just nothing but the noodles that I had originally asked for. I don't know if they were trying to teach me a lesson by being up upset I sent it back. It was not great to pay for something and than eat a whole plate of just noodles when I drove 1hr and 30mins just to eat there. I don't like to be a complainer but hopefully the owners read these reviews and take them into consideration.
Lien T.,"San Jose, CA",733,872,1861,4.0,10/16/2009,"I was having a late-night craving for some cheesecake and thankfully they were still open. I was only interested in appeasing my craving but my boyfriend wanted to grab a couple drinks and share an appetizer too.  - Factory Appetizer Favorites: Perfect for the indecisive. Only thing is that it serves four or more so the two of us were stuffed! Comes with avocado eggrolls, spinach and cheese dip, pot stickers, shrimp spring rolls, quesadilla, corn cakes, buffalo blasts, and calamari. It was the first time I tried corn cakes and to my surprise, I loved them! The texture and taste wasn't like anything I've ever tried before. The pot stickers, calamari, avocado eggrolls, and quesadilla were great. The spinach and cheese dip had more spinach than cheese. The buffalo blasts were just okay and  we were very unsatisfied with the spring rolls--filling wasn't good and the rice paper was too thick, bleh. - Strawberry Fruit Daiquiri: Perfect. Can't go wrong with a perfect proportion of some strawberries, vodka, and rum.  - Strawberry Creamsicle: His mistake for ordering this. .. imagine drinking vodka with some vanilla ice cream? I don't know, in our opinion, it was just an awkward/gross combination overall.  - Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake: Light, delicate, and my ultimate favorite! Caramel Cheesecake topped with a rich caramel mousse. Fatty, but yummy! We sat ourselves at the bar area and our waitress was energetic, super-friendly, and quick. I have to come back soon to try their new Red Velvet Cheesecake. *Drools*."
Vincent V.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,6,2.0,5/9/2013,"Party of six and we wait for close to an hour. Understandable if the food and service were worth the wait, which they are not. Drinks arrive at the table one or two at a time. Why? They were ordered at the same time. Food arrived in spurts too. We have tried this place multiple time, and it has always been the same. Never again."
Joseph S.,"Santa Clara, CA",962,56,750,1.0,11/14/2011,"Bad experience AGAIN. What's up with this place? Some of the dishes are good and some are real bad. Our waitress was sweet and nice but  our   water  was empty and they had no bread. My GF ordered the pasta DI vinci with extra sauce on the side and I ordered the chicken DI pana. The food server brought us the food but no extra sauce, we immediately said we ordered extra sauce, he said I know I'll be right back. We waited 2 or 3 minutes and nothing. I got up and went to the kitchen where I met the manager and I told him what happened. A different manager came to our table and said he was sorry and hovered over us for a couple of minutes, I asked where the sauce was, he said it will be out in 30 seconds he left and brought it out 3 minutes later. The chicken DI pana was very bad especially for the price."
Tim Y.,Silicon Valley,53,715,4221,4.0,8/18/2010,"Then menu here is like a novel. There is something here for everyone. The food is consistent at all the locations I have been too. If you go during the weekend dinner rush be prepared for a short wait.  For some reason I almost always order the chicken salad sandwich or club sandwich with fries and a side of creamy ranch dressing. The waiters and waitresses have always been attentive and friendly.  If you dine with children, ask for their bread/fruit plate for the kids. They'll serve the kids a small plate of fresh fruits and some table bread. The kids love it because it's their own! Remember to save room for a some cheesecake... Just don't read the calorie count on each slice. :-)"
Cecilia D.,"San Jose, CA",125,24,162,3.0,10/4/2010,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times, and I think they do a pretty good job of serving great food with okay service. I usually go with my bf, and he and I share any pasta and salad. I loveeee the frozen iced mango and red velvet cheesecake. Definitely try that one out. I don't have any complaints about the food yet. I've liked everything I've tried so far.  The reason for the 3 star review is because of one incident. We were waiting to get seated because they told us it was going to be a 10 minute wait. So we weren't fussy about it and decided to chill out. Meanwhile, another couple walks in and asks how long the wait is. The hostess said it would be 10 minutes, and the manly dude says, ""NEVERMIND. WE'RE LEAVING."" Immediately after he said that, the hostess says, ""Oh wait. We have a table right here for you."" My friend gives them that -____- face, and he won't stop biscuiting about how they're so shady. It is kinda mean, though, because there were a few people ahead of them.  We'll probably be back. The smell of the food as you're walking by Cheesecake Factory entrance from the mall... it is so alluring. :P"
Robert S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/4/2014,"I created a Yelp account just to rate this establishment and if it were possible I would rate in the negative stars. I placed a call to this restaurant with the intentions of ordering a ""to-go curb side"" and was placed on hold (3) times for 20 minutes each call trying to place an order. The 4th call I asked for the manager to inform them of the situation and was placed on hold for 10 minutes, when one of the employees finally answered they didn't even know the reason I was on hold! When the manager was finally tracked down I feel he didn't even care that a long time customer was highly inconvenienced with this experience and offered nothing but an apology. This was the single worst experience I've had."
Lan P.,"Concord, CA",7,26,,4.0,10/22/2014,"Great restaurant but always very long delays in seating.  Because of so much business, the seats were dirty and the service was rushed.  But the food is always really good with a very wide selection.  The mango/raspberry drink was superb!  I don't always come here but find myself coming back now and then.. Worth it if you don't mind waiting for 1 or 2 hours."
AM Y.,"Union City, CA",40,2,,1.0,9/25/2015,This place was they rudest place I have been too!!!!-door dashers*do not go here u will waste your time!!!!! I will not go there either for work related purposes or personal!
