Earlene C.,"East Bay, CA",123,931,3135,5.0,10/9/2009,"Red Velvet Cheesecake is all I need to make everything feel right in the world!  One bite of this decadent cake, you are transported to another place, some dimension of the universe where everything is perfect! Out of the many varieties Cheesecake Factory has to offer, Red Velvet is it!!  Not too rich, perfect balance of cheesecake, red velvet cake, cream and white chocolate flakes. It's heavenly! We came to carb load before the Rock n' Roll half marathon and man, what a treat!"
Adrian O.,"San Jose, CA",172,18,4,5.0,12/20/2013,"This place is awesome! The food is great big portions and their service is great, Whenever I ask my daughter where she wants to go eat, she is quick to choose this place, so for her birthday dinner of course we came here, and didn't disappoint, the server by the end of the night knew all of our names and brought my daughter a special cheesecake with candles and some other waiters singing happy birthday! Which made her day that much better!"
Jan P.,"San Jose, CA",302,861,1692,4.0,6/28/2008,"I've always been a fan of this chain and its extensive menu. My favorites include the firecracker salmon rolls, the chicken madeira, the chicken salad sandwich, the chowder, as well as both the vanilla bean and banana cheesecakes. I love, love their to-go service: order over the phone, wait in your car, and they will bring the food out to you and charge you with your card. Service here has always been friendly and attentive for me. Hence, they are usually busy. Yum."
Aly A.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,6,1.0,9/14/2014,Love there  cheesecakes !! But there food was kinda cold today and the waiter have my husband his food n mine to an other table so he was done eating his food by the time mine came out after the realize they made a mistake !!
Alberto L.,"San Jose, CA",3,22,1,2.0,7/6/2014,"I gave it only 3 stars because their Curbside to go service is horrible! The sign says ""10 minute parking"" yet you're likely to be waiting there well over 10 minutes for your meal. I also have ordered a couple of salads to go and they have felt like they've been sitting there for awhile, the lettuce didn't feel fresh at all and forget about being specific with what you want in it, more than likely they'll mess up your order. Their pasta carbonara is really good though and so is that free bread! The outside seating smells like sewage too...yuck!"
Justin D.,"San Carlos, CA",44,32,1,4.0,5/27/2014,"Ate here for dinner on Memorial Day, this was our first visit to this location.  I had the soup (butter bean and bacon) and smokehouse burger and for desert a slice of smores cheesecake, my wife had the chicken chipotle pasta and a slice of Reese's cheesecake.  The food was all really good, and my wife was particularly pleased that, while large enough to take some home, her pasta was not quite as out of control portion wise as she had expected, which was a nice change from previous visits.  The cheesecake was excellent as expected, the smores in particular was great, and at $8 a slice is surely one of the best desert values at any restaurant in the bay area.  Our server was a bit sterile personality wise, but that's not much of a surprise for a chain restaurant, and was otherwise pleasant and attentive."
Alanna H.,"San Jose, CA",15,26,11,1.0,5/6/2015,"I generally do not like to write bad reviews because it hurts business.  When I give 1 star, it's usually really bad.  It is now the 2nd occurrence, where the hostess is rude and gave bad information.  I know it's busy so I go early anticipating that, the hostess told me to come back an hour later and I would be seated shortly.  I fell for this twice!  Twice I came back later, 45 mins later and instead of being seated shortly as told, I am told that it will be another 1 hour wait, giving me the face like she's doing me a favor that I'm actually able to get a table.  Geez!  Waiting is one thing, but it angers me, to be given bad info and then a bad attitude."
Sep G.,"San Jose, CA",3,36,5,4.0,7/26/2014,So on a Saturday night at 10 o'clock in south San Jose Cheese cake factory is your best. Walked in and was seated in about 5 min and started grubbing. They have a huge menu so you have a lot of options. Witch comes in very handy if your wife is a picky as mine when it comes to her food choices. All in all a good go to spot especially for later dinners.
Sherri L.,"San Jose, CA",74,110,16,4.0,4/10/2012,What is not to love about Cheesecake factory? Maybe the calories. I love their array of options and their Da Vinci Pasta.  The staff is always great and their food is always consistently good.
Stephen G.,"Concord, CA",40,37,8,4.0,9/10/2012,"I eat at cheesecake factory alot, but not this location, but this by far is the best experience I have ever had at any Cheesecake.  The front desk staff was attentive and nice and made eye contact and accommodated us very well.  Our server and her helpers were always there, never with an empty drink and always returning promptly with any condiment request and was always within earshot if we needed something. At many restaurants, they split a server's section to a couple tables here and a couple tables there. Here, she had two tables adjacent to our table and 3 tables across the way so she was never very far away. So why not 5 stars?  Some things could be changed, some things obviously not. 1. We were celebrating a birthday. There were 5 or so servers singing happy birthday. It was super lame. They all could care less so much that I couldn't even sing along. 2. This didn't seem like an awkwardly placed table, but it seemed like all the staff walked by and through our section, but it wasn't the main hall, it was just bizzare.  3. The white shoes. They're disgusting. The servers don't take care of them and it's super super obvious since they're supposed to be white and are almost black."
Olga S.,"San Jose, CA",20,18,,1.0,7/6/2011,"I've eaten here before, and have generally had no complaints - it looks, feels and tastes like the Cheesecake Factory, which is all I ask.  But something happened this weekend that makes me never want to eat here again.  My family and I stopped by the restaurant at around 11:25 a.m.  Although the sign said that the restaurant doesn't open until 11:30, the door was unlocked, so we figured we could walk in and wait up front (we were tired and carrying several bags and our baby daughter and really wanted to sit down).  As we walked into the restaurant, we saw a bunch of servers standing at the hostess station.  One of the servers saw us come in and, instead of politely letting us know that they're not open yet or suggesting that we sit up front and wait, turned around and shouted loudly to no one in particular ""HEY, SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GO LOCK THE DOOR!"" Then another server came over and shooed us, our heavy bags and heavy baby out of the restaurant.   Needless to say, we promptly walked out and ate somewhere else..."
Phil M.,"Salinas, CA",25,175,17,5.0,6/16/2011,"The food here is incredible (though don't you dare ask for the nutritional info! You'll have a coronary just looking at the numbers!). It's a bit pricey, but well worth it for both the quality & quantity of food you get. Their cheesecakes are, of course, to die for. The menu is huge, so there's something for everyone. And the staff is always friendly. The one thing I don't like about Cheesecake Factory is that they don't take reservations. Show up on a Friday or Saturday night & be prepared to wait 45+ minutes (at least!) for a table. The saving grace is that they're in a mall, which means you can kill much of that time with shopping."
Pegah T.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,1,1.0,7/15/2015,I went to this place yesterday with my friend. I saw a black hair inside my water while I was drinking my water. I called the server to come and told him about what happened because I almost thrown up. The server called his manager and he just told me that this hair is not from them and argued with me in front of everyone instead of apologizing and making me happy with either a discount or free cheesecake or something. I was so upset about what happened and how he treated me and my friend in front of others . I wont ever go back to this place because of the bad customer service and a bad expression I got from their food and management.
Graydon M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",86,192,30,3.0,6/22/2012,My son loves this place which is really the only reason that we go.  The food is your typical mass market chain food.  It always comes out hot which is a good thing.  The service can be spotty.  I've had it range all over the map.  This last time it was pretty bad but since I've had better I can overlook that this time.  I decided to branch out of my normal cashew chicken and had a burger.  It was fine but I wouldn't come here for a burger.   Really there isn't much to write home about.
Lina M.,"San Francisco, CA",30,38,45,4.0,11/25/2013,"If u come on weekend there is a big line. But its worth the wait because the food it so yummy,I order chiken romeno,and fir desert I get the famous cheese cake,its came with wip cream. I m defently will come back and recommend this olace."
R F.,"San Jose, CA",18,178,161,4.0,8/18/2012,I have always been a fan of cheesecake factory :) even though we never make it to a cheesecake  appetizer avocado rolls so yummy ! cilantro sweet dip that they have ordered spicy chipotle and shrimp alfredo. it was lunch size. everything was perfect except they gave us the pasta before the appetizer.  didnt make it to delicious red velvet cheesecake maybe next time
Carlos B.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,1,3.0,6/9/2014,it's was around 6pm when me and my friend  got there and dine outside. we smelled a horrible smell ! it was coming from the dump the have right next to aloha kitchen it was disgustingly uncomfortable eating outside the food had the taste of garbage ! the mall needs to fix that!! you cant have 2 restaurants next to the garbage disposal
Mely M.,"San Jose, CA",1,105,111,4.0,3/27/2014,"These are all pretty much the same.  What makes them different is the people. When we arrived today the hostess were so rude we considered leaving. They were not only curt when they did acknowledge us but couldn't stop their personal conversation to greet us. We wandered into the bar while discussing our other options when we were greeted by Paul, the bartender. He was inviting and nice - he promptly cleared an area that people had just left and got us drinks and menus quickly. We decided to stay but not to engage with the hostesses further. Paul was helpful with the menu, offered to return our pager, and even explained the drinks he was making when we asked. Our food was delicious and we left happy. I would have to recommend Paul because without him Cheesecake Factory would have lost two guests, not only for tonight but until we had told all our friends how rude they are."
Ly D.,"San Jose, CA",643,402,911,4.0,3/16/2010,"I like coming here for lunch more than dinner since it can get really busy on the weekends. I like their popcorn shrimp and their buffalo chicken strips as appetizers. I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta as an entree, it's delicious! Careful with this one though, it's loaded with calories! I like to get it with the sauce on the side, that way it's easier to control. For dessert, I've had their original cheesecake with fresh strawberries (good), strawberry shortcake (really good), tiramisu cheesecake (really, really good), and their kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (this one's iffy because there's a layer of very rich, dark chocolate at the bottom that comes off as bitter). They don't take reservations on the weekends so that's a bummer and the wait is really long so I suggest you come early to get a table."
David C.,"San Jose, CA",99,102,45,4.0,11/29/2011,"Minus one star for ""no reservation"" policy and the long wait, and the food being a bit pricey. My wife is an avid fan of their Miso Salmon. She gets it every time we eat here. I, on the other hand, like their sliders and sliced beef. Their fried mac cheese balls dipped in marinara is something I definitely would recommend for appetizers. But the main reason we really like this place is... ok, wait for it (drum roll)... their BREAD! damn that brown bread gets us hooked every time. We always ask for ALL brown bread and get seconds or even thirds, to go. I swear sometimes we fill ourselves up so much with it, our tummies have little room to spare for our entrees. Spread some of their butter on it and you're good to go... Appetizers? really? what about just more bread? haha... oh yeah and their cheesecakes are pretty good too... I think... too far back to remember how it tasted. but yeah, don't forget to get their free bread..."
