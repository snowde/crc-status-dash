Eric H.,"San Jose, CA",320,516,149,4.0,3/13/2010,"I went here to celebrate my son's birthday. We were just having a desert for him but my wife turned it into a lite lunch. My wife had the House salad with a vinaigrette dressing and the soup of the day, which was a wild mushroom soup. I had the lunch portion fish and chips. My son had the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae. My wife's soup, my chips, and my sons sundae were outstanding-ly amazing. the salad and the fish were mediocre by themselves, but when combined were also very good.  The loss of a star comes form the waiter being a bit overwhelmed and having to wait just to ask to get a glass of water at the end of my meal. All in all I recommend this place to anybody for any occasion."
Martha J.,"San Jose, CA",1,90,185,2.0,5/12/2015,"I was disappointed with the service, we went on Saturday May 9. The wait was an hour, when we sat down it took them 10 minutes for them to take our drink order, then another 10 minutes for them to give us bread. The drinks were great. When our order finally came which took over 30 minutes was not all that. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and it tasted funny. I found a couple of things that should not have been in there, I asked they waiter to find out what it was and they informed me they had put pieces of pear in it. They offered to make me a new dish, but by the time I got it everyone was done eating. Then they didn't offer me a discount for their mistake. The service was very bad. We had to keep waving the waiter down to get re-fills. They never came to our table just to check and see if we needed anything. I would not come back here again especially if you are hungry since the wait is so long."
Linda l.,"San Jose, CA",113,52,5,5.0,4/20/2011,"I came here for my girl's birthday dinner around 830ish. I ordered the Fallafa.... what? pasta thing with caramelized onions and loved it. Its a big portion for around 16$.  The customer service deserves 5 stars! They really are the nicest waiters i've ever met. And one, whom i believe was the manager was extremely friendly and considerate when the birthday girls dish ran out. They even made her a little cup of sweets with a candle. So sweet!"
Charles C.,"San Jose, CA",5,196,2,3.0,4/27/2012,"My family stopped here the other day for dinner. The server was nice, but they were busy so didn't see them that much. The appetizer was fine.  I had the chicken parm sandwich.  Which was fine, but not something I would go back for. We had a gift card, but it still come to 40+ on the bill...  Overall everything was just ok."
Li C.,"Brisbane, Australia",6,128,11,4.0,4/9/2014,"Typical Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. We ate around 3pm on a Saturday, got seated in 5 minutes, that has to be a speed record for them. Food was decent as always, never had a problem and always ample. Desserts, yum as usual, correction triple yum. Gave 4 stars as the service we received at this location from the point of greeting to our waiter was EXCELLENT :)"
Paula K.,"San Jose, CA",1,31,,5.0,8/17/2013,"We always have a good experience at the Cheesecake Factory. Food appears cooked to order and in large portions. Service is great in fact Amir was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly, which can make all the difference. He even helped us with the small details.Will definitely be back, and ask for Amir!"
Terri M.,"Saratoga, CA",0,64,130,3.0,8/14/2010,"I like the restaurant.  It's just what my instinct tells me.  I think because I like the interior, plates, the way everything's set up.  Foods might be a bit pricy, but I think it's worth it; pretty & plenty of it. My hus & I went for lunch, and ordered: -Club sandwich -Fried prawns -Strawberry shortcake -Stehanie's velvet cheesecake (take out) -Lemon rasberry cheesecake (take out) I stopped eating my sandwich after one bite because I was dying to try their shorcake, and I'm glad I did.  It's freaking good, and I highly recommend it ($6.95)  But don't eat it alone due to the amount of calories as well as its huge portion (3 scoops of vanilla ice cream were sandwiched between the sconelike cake). I loved their cole slaw; it's sweet, creamy, and a bit tangy.  I wonder if it's Mayo that makes the difference.  I don't think I have to tell you anything about their cheesecake.  I'll repeat ordering Steh's cheesecake for sure.  Lemon rasberry was too lemony to my liking it reminds me of toilet fragrence (it's not that I ever ate it in my life hehe). On the way out, I asked for a take out menu, and they gave me a set of menu, the same version of dining in, I'll upload a few photos later. My hus said CCF charges 3.5 times as much as Safeway when other eateries charge 2-2.5 times as much, or CCF gives you more?"
Abey Q.,"San Jose, CA",2,50,1,1.0,7/26/2013,"Date of visit:  7-26-2013  * Bartender served us drinks but neglected to put our food order to the kitchen.   * 30 minutes later she apologizes and says it won't be long.  Clam chowder arrives.   * 20 more minutes we tell the bartender to cancel our order because we are done waiting.  Total time sitting at the bar waiting for our meals:  ONE HOUR! * She rushes to the kitchen with our receipt and within 5 minutes returns with our two dishes.  The salad I ordered was nowhere to be seen.   * Manager apologizes and we inform him we don't want the food because we don't have time to eat it now.   *He offers to box it up.  We say no.  We inform him to comp us the drinks and chowder and we'll call it even.   He agrees and we say goodbye and walk out without tipping our bartender.   *I was going to spend $90.00 in gift certificates for my daughter's special education teacher and her helpers, but we couldn't fathom giving Cheesecake Factory any of our money after what just took place."
John W.,"San Jose, CA",37,7,,1.0,6/26/2015,"I have had better experiences at The Cheesecake Factory but this one definitely rated one star. We ordered our meals: My wife ordered skinny tacos; kids, burgers; me, fish and chips. Mine came first. Fish was hard as a rock, inedible. Manager later admitted that it was undercooked. Five minutes later my wife received her meal. It was OK, according to her. I sent mine back, asking why our kids had not received their burgers. Waiter had no answer. 10 minutes later, kids burgers came. My wife is finishing her meal by now. Manger came and offered to get me something different. Kids have now received their burgers and I have not yet had a chance to order. I ordered a burger and the manager said it would take 3 minutes. 12 minutes later I received my burger. Kids and wife have long finished their meals. My burger was fine (although I didn't really want a burger; I just wanted something ""safe"" at this point). Kids' burgers were fine, according to kids. Manager offered to buy us two slices of cheesecake for our trouble. We agreed. Took a long time for the waiter to come back and take our cheesecake order. Took another long time for cheesecake to come. Cheesecake was good. Experience was a complete disaster. Women's RR was also a complete disaster, according to wife, clogged toilets and broken seats. I don't supposed they will be very motivated to get their act together as long as people are lined up to get in the place. But we won't be back."
Juan P.,"Santa Clara, CA",54,18,2,3.0,6/17/2012,"The food is decent...standard chain food. They get two stars since the waiter did everything he could to rectify a situation. Long story short, my in laws ordered a burger that never came. My kids, my wife, and i all got our food, bit apparently a burger is tough to remember. We all finished our food before the burger even came up. Manager came by twice to apologize and offered free soup. Really? Soup? Every time i come here, i am reminded why i will just order dessert  to take home.  Revision to add: to their credit, they comped the burger and also my wifes lunch,  so they get an additional star."
Sherrie Rose M.,"San Jose, CA",26,106,,5.0,7/4/2013,"Came here with a friend after watching a movie at the nearby theater.  We had a great lunch.  I had the Monterey burger with sweet potato fries and a raspberry lemonade.  My friend had the veggie burger with regular fries and some sort of flavored iced tea.  Our waiter was very friendly and made sure we got everything we needed.  Overall, a great experience."
Iveta I.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,4.0,11/24/2012,"Brought my family on saturday night for the first time. Mostly interested in cheesecake and food expectations were low.  We were seated almost immediately, which was a pleasant surprise.  I ordered Pasta da Vinci, it turned out to be delicious! My husband got Salisbury steak. It was very good, although a bit too filling.  Strawberry cheesecake was excellent too."

Sherri C.,"San Jose, CA",218,833,1138,4.0,12/24/2009,"A hundred years ago I frequented what I think was one of the first Cheesecake Factory locations in Marina del Rey.  Back then, they were known for their impressive menu, brunches, and huge pasta dishes.  Several years passed before they expanded to the Bay Area, and one visit for a friend's birthday (and a terrible pasta dish) convinced me never to come here again. However, hubby and I have been in need of late night dinner places lately...and I was persuaded to give The Cheesecake Factory another chance.  I was surprised to find plenty of other items on the huge menu that were quite good.  Hubby often gets the fish of the day.  I also enjoy the breakfast items that can be ordered for dinner.  One extra star for saving us hungry humans more than once past 10:00 pm."
Justin A.,"San Jose, CA",33,42,8,4.0,4/11/2011,"When we walked in, we went directly to the host stand. What I found annoying is that she told me that we would be seated right away. After seeing two other people being sat before us, and actually having to wait, though there wasn't supposed to be a wait, I decided for us to sit in the bar. Our server took care of us right away. I only ordered water while my friend ordered  soda. I drank quite a bit of water and the server was on it, he kept my glass full. I was happy about that. We shared the Chicken Tostada Salad or whatever it is called. It was really tasty. Then we shared the Godiva Brownie Sundae. There was three slices of Godiva Brownie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Wish I could eat it all over again.  I gave them four stars because of the service. I have been here before and received horrible service. Happy for the first time that we got someone that seemed to care. I would of given them five if the hostess would of told me that we would have to wait briefly... Still annoyed..."
Sydney N.,"San Jose, CA",19,4,,4.0,6/22/2011,"The food here is great. There's a lot of food on the menu, so my friend and I took awhile (15mins?) figuring out what we wanted to pick. I got a four cheese pasta (fell in love with my restroom after this) while my friend got one of the chicken pizza dishes. My dish was rather cheesy (expected of course), but her dish was  delicious!  The service here is exceptional, and the meal prices are decent."
D N.,"San Jose, CA",0,33,1,2.0,11/11/2013,"Had lunch here today with a friend. The meal was nothing spectacular, just average. (chicken salad sandwich toasted on white bread. (white bread? who eats plain, thin white bread these days?) Never thought to ask since about the bread, I like most OTHER breads. The red velvet cheesecake (shared) was to die for though! yum city.... The main reason for the BAD REVIEW: used the lady's room, soaped up afterwards, THEN.....NO WATER!! NONE! (Had to just wipe my hands off with dry paper towels) Noticed that others didn't even bother to soap up, so I imagine all three sinks had been down for awhile. Unsanitary? Yeah....a bit!! Means any female servers did not wash their hands! GROSS! People wonder why horrible illnesses are passed along.  Also, something I didn't care for was how DARK it was inside....especially when you were not having a romantic lunch. How about having a light and dark side of the restaurant? Hard to read the massive menu in the dark as well....Just dreary, on a wonderfully sunny day outside. Thank goodness the cheesecake was so good!"
David T.,"Milpitas, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/19/2013,It is good. The cheesecake is good. Food portion is good! Some people complain that they give too much food... I can usually eat dinner here and have another meal the next day eating here
Crystal V.,"San Jose, CA",382,718,212,5.0,4/28/2011,"Love this place. Great for the usual date night. Some times it's a hit or miss for the wait time but with all those cheesecakes to chose from, you can bare to wait a bit! ;) my fav is the chicken mediera. However you spell it. It's mashed potatoes ate delish, asparagus which I love, chicken soaking in this delicious wine sauce, and I don't drink wine so it was surprisingly good!  Or if you're having a fat day, try the fried Mac n Cheese balls. Yum! Aak for Alyssa O'Neil as a server, haven't had a complaint about her yet!"
Amy Z.,"San Jose, CA",0,71,26,4.0,3/4/2015,"I absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary last year (my first time) I was so excited to try their cheesecakes me being a huge fan of sweets. We waited about an hour to get a table, all dressed up. Our lovely waitress was very kind, complimenting us and when she asked what the occasion was we said our anniversary and congratulated us. We sat down, ordered food (the food pricing was decent and so was the food) after that I had some room for dessert I ordered the Oreo cheesecake, when our waitress came out with the cheesecake on the plate was written ""happy anniversary"" I thought it was the best service we've had at any restaurant by far! I couldn't be anymore pleased with this restaurants service! We will definitely be back :)"
