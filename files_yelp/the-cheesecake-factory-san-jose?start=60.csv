Tom G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,7,1.0,7/24/2017,"Two years nothing has changed. Save yourself the aggravation go somewhere else.  This restaurant consistently has the worse service. They do not get our orders right, they are not one bit attentive - if you want refills you have to ask and get a servers attention, the bathrooms are not attended to, and it takes a long time to get your food out. Not worth the wait."
Ter L.,"San Jose, CA",186,821,8639,3.0,4/5/2016,"Food is aLways on point but the customer service is aLways a hit or miss. Parking is dreadfuL. I spent over ten minutes circLing around and around and got NOTHING. I ended up giving up and decided that I wouLd have to settLe with a Longer than necessary waLk. Boo!! Came here with the work famiLy since we were ceLebrating a birthday- Birthday Boy's reQuest!! Made reservations for 6 and specified that there was a bday ceLebrant, they even took down his name. Food took a minute to come out which was unfortunate since we were kind of on a time crunch.  On the bright side, aLL the food tasted great and I'm confident in saying that everyone Left happy.  Fast forward- we pLaced an order for the Low carb cheesecake w/ strawberries and a sLice of carrot cake. Not a singLe person came out to sing or wish the Birthday Boy a HBD, no compLimentary whipped cream Sunday with a candLe to bLow out, and not even a Quick chocoLate scribbLe on the cheesecake pLate to recognize this speciaL occasion. NOT COOL!!!"
Rach A.,"San Jose, CA",20,5,7,1.0,4/28/2017,If I can give zero star.  worst Cheesecake Factory ever I had in my life. I have ordered Chinese chicken salad it taste so salty and sweet it was just overwhelming. The Lettuce was completely soaked in a dressing which was too salty. I always have this salad and it was not an usual Taste. I asked fora replacement and the server brought me another Chinese chicken salad without the chickens and dressing excuse me? I was already tired from my crying toddler  I was frustrated and I just decided to leave this place. I'll never come back to this place
L-eezy N.,"San Jose, CA",1,21,1,3.0,10/21/2017,"The food are always great it's the service that brings it down a little bit. I've been going to this place for about 5 years. The food for the most part is always great. I may had some bland ones before but for the most part its consistent. Service is also on and off.  I some on point service and waiters who come greet us very late or in my most recent visit, not at all.  I usually go for pastas: Farfalle, garlic noodles, basil chicken pasta and so on. Chicken tenders are also great. The avocados are good appetizers too. For desserts I would stick to the cheesecakes if ya know what I'm saying."
Phi N.,"Glenmont, MD",104,867,3259,2.0,6/9/2016,"If you've been to cheesecake, you know that it's a huge headache to order because there is such a large menu to choose from... Anyway, this review is just for the tiramisu that I ordered. I placed the order in on the phone, expecting to come pick up a pretty looking dessert... Well, it came Ina big tin foil tray, didn't look that impressive and only tasted average. Kind of a let down to be honest. ***Update 6/15/16*** Order the red velvet cake for my co-worker's birthday. It is diabetes waiting to happen and not good at all."
Jennifer G.,"Crofton, MD",13,27,8,1.0,4/16/2017,"Horrible!!! Food, service, attitude. All bad. Waited 30 minutes and then found a seat in the bar area. We waited 40 minutes and watched a table get their food, eat and leave. After asking several times where the food was, my friends dish came out. Without our appetizers. Then her appetizer came. Then my cold steak, broccoli and fries came. Still no appetizer. A server came on and took over shift and said he was going to fix it. Took the steak and brought it back out. The same bone I had cut off was there. He had REHEATed my steak and broccoli. When we suggested that he not do that to other customers he assured us he was trying to get us out as he knew we had waited long. We had already missed our movie... then he came back and gave a terrible snotty attitude when I recommended him giving that option to the guest(of Reheating or fresh) the next time. On top of that, I made them aware of an allergy and I have been sick since after dinner and for the last two hours... Update. I wrote them Like suggested but no response"
Jason H.,"San Jose, CA",27,281,105,2.0,4/19/2017,Went in to get some cheesecake to go... The server was too busy making change for the valet and splitting tips with the coworkers than taking my order! Let's hope dessert makes up for it. Stay tuned.
Mackenzi J.,"Campbell, CA",275,3,,5.0,4/18/2017,"Updating my review from my last one because we'll, it deserves to be updated. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place another shot after out pretty terrible last experience and this time I have to say I am actually glad we did! If you are going to this location with just yourself or maybe one or two other people, SIT AT THE BAR. Darren is the bartender Friday-Tuesday nights and he is absolutely fabulous. EXCEEDED all I could have asked for and you can tell he knows what he is doing. The food is pretty good as always so I usually don't have much to complain about there, but my 5 stars this time really goes to him individually. He gives phenomenal service and deserves every penny of my tip. I will definitely be back now, but only to sit in the bar and have him wait on us.  Sometimes the difference in service between the bar and the floor makes all the difference. Cheers to you Darren you have just gained two new regulars!"
Nahal T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,4,2.0,7/23/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this one is the worst I've been to.  They are constantly breaking plates, I don't think a single one made it back into the kitchen. The floor was wet for over an hour, from the time we walked to our table and still wet on the way out.  My mother specifically and extensively explained how she wanted HOT, fresh chicken on her salad. We have gone through this before and told her we would return it if it was not hot. When we got the salad, the chicken was as cold as the lettuce. We told the waitress, who replied, ""are you sure?"" Of course I'm sure, it's in my mouth. I was so done. Will not return."
Paul H.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/27/2017,if I have to hear another five dang happy birthday's being barked woofed and gurgled during my meal I'm taking my business elsewhere what about us immortals who don't celebrate another day closer to death because there isn't one? That's why I don't use periods and commas because I don't need to breathe ya think of that?! two stars for the old fashions and bread
Davina P.,"San Jose, CA",637,16,3,4.0,6/20/2017,"Came here for happy hour since a lot of their appetizers are only $5.95 a plate. The whole place was very dimly lit compared to The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair where they dim the lights towards dinner time.  We sat in the bar area and asked for a happy hour menu even though I've already decided on what I wanted to try before getting here LOL.  While the food looked pretty worth for the happy hour prices I decided paying full price for drinks would be better than the HH drinks they offered.  Drinks -  The Ultimate Margarita ($13.50): I love my margaritas and I for sure loved this one and only needed one throughout HH. Whisky Sour ($11.50): My boyfriend felt like it wasn't strong when he first tasted it so I took a sip. It was well made in my opinion and you can definitely taste the whisky and the orange flavors. It didn't have the bad aftertaste since I normally don't like drinks made with whisky or bourbon. He said he liked the drink overall.  Food -  Avocado Eggrolls ($5.95): While I love avocado and eat guacamole almost religiously, I felt like it was too much avocado in the egg roll itself. The cilantro dipping sauce helped to add an element of sweetness.  Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.95): I've been dying to tried this for the longest time now and I think I might have hyped myself too much. While it was good in itself, it didn't come out piping hot and was too creamy after I got to the second piece of bread that came with it.  Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): My friend who works at Cheesecake Factory told me that it tasted like orange chicken and I've tried fried cauliflower in Utah before so I wanted to try it. While the sweet orange sauce may resemble the orange chicken, the interior not so much. It definitely could have done without the sauce.  Mushroom Burger ($13.95): It was a mountain of mushrooms and even though a bunch fell out, there was even more mushrooms inside the burger. My boyfriend loves his mushroom burger and couldn't even finish it all since it was so ginormous. My eyes were wayyyyy bigger than my stomach because I've had a bit of everything and then got full almost immediately. Maybe it was because I was grazing on the sourdough and whole wheat bread they offered, which was freshly out of the oven and still warm.  Finished my drinks and took the rest of the food to go since I know I'll end up getting hungry later. Happy hour here is definitely best for trying all their appetizers since they're half off. Just wish it wasn't so dark in there all the time. It even got cold in there and I came to escape the heat!  Would come back when I'm craving rich heavy food and another nice Margarita hehe."
E S.,"Milpitas, CA",0,7,6,2.0,12/15/2017,"Did a call-in order for pick up. They open at 11:00 AM but I was told I can call in my order before opening. I called around 10:35 AM and was on hold for about 15 minutes before they took my order. They told me order was going to be ready at 11:30 AM, it was. We had 9 orders and 3 were done wrong and we were also missing condiments we had asked for on the side. The food was very poorly put together, just thrown in a to go box. One order was a cheeseburger that was supposed to be cooked well, but it was burnt. Outside was black in color. For the price you pay, I would expect just a little bit more...."
Holly L.,"San Jose, CA",205,166,568,5.0,3/2/2016,"Wow blow me away! Not only was our server so awesome! Nathaniel so awesome and on every point it takes to give outstanding service but our lunch was SO good!!!!!!!  To start off with we had a warm crab and artichoke dip! Heaven!!!!!!!  Then I had the lunch pasta special Louisiana pasta with chicken SO SO good! Hubby had the bacon bacon cheese burger! Juice, with thick slice of bacon...make a grown mans heart stop. And the child had kids pasta with lemonade.  Everything was hot, ready on time and to top it off the outside was empty and got to have a lovely lunch enjoying the sun. Thank you again to Nate aka Nathaniel"
K E.,"San Jose, CA",26,131,135,3.0,10/5/2017,This place is always a hit or miss with the food to the customer service. Depending on the day and time the wait time can be 20 min to an hour.
Jenny T.,"San Jose, CA",18,36,5,2.0,6/12/2017,Last resort....craving this...paid 6 bucks for it...but the portion is definitely....a bit lacking haha the flavor is not the same but the customer service was pretty good decent tonight for a change. :)
S F.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Horrible service! Had to ask several times for the bread. One meal came out and I finished it and the other meal still hadn't come out. The ""to go"" order came out before our meals came out! We specifically asked that the ""to go"" meal be ready closer to when we leave so it was warm. The manager came and explained how they were busy but seemed more irritated than sorry. This is the second time here with horrible service. Definitely not coming back again! To expensive to be getting this type of service!"
Yasmin K.,"San Jose, CA",424,42,24,2.0,8/26/2017,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory.. but tonight was a different story. I ordered take out over the phone and I got a steak medallion dish. It sounded good and I decided to order it. At the end of the phone call, they asked me if I wanted the complimentary bread with my order, and I said yes. When I picked up my order and came home, I realized two things.. I didn't receive my complimentary bread and the steak was so much smaller than I thought! I even googled the dish on the internet and realized what a big different there is.. the picture on the internet is literally about twice the size as what I received.. I paid about $18 for it..... so not worth it.."
Jasminder B.,"San Jose, CA",4,39,23,3.0,10/7/2017,"You're paying for the atmosphere. Not the food, not the waiter service, but the mood lighting and less-than-average noise. Remind yourself that when you consider coming here because the food costs way more than it's worth and the portions aren't great. Olive Garden and Buga Di Beppo right next door are a way better value for your money."
Tamaya A.,"San Jose, CA",0,37,314,5.0,12/2/2017,"Came today to celebrate a baby on the way and a birthday, Mary was our server and she was amazing! Very down to earth and friendly, we were all happy with the service we received. The food was great, I forgot to take a picture but we ordered a Cesar salad, (the croutons were so yummy), chicken taquitos, a green curry dish, and a mushroom burger. That burger was so huge, I couldn't even fit a bite in my mouth so the  burger ended up falling apart, but I didn't mind. The chicken taquitos looked a bit on the small size but I was told it was good! The green curry dish wasn't spicy and had pieces of mango in it which made it even better! We all got cheesecake for dessert and it did not disappoint!!! The mango lime cheesecake was heavenly the whip cream was light and pairs nicely with the cake! The place was busy but service was prompt and they didn't even rush us to get out, so very very happy with time here. Will come back again and hopefully get to see Mary again!!  Thank you!!!"
Anna F.,"Gilroy, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/31/2017,Today we got the worst service in our life the drinks what awful and the bartender and the waitress had an attitude How wrong  can you go with lemon drops and the Manhattan everybody knows how to make a lemon drop in Manhattan I called the manager and he did not care anything I had to say I would like my money back because we did not even drink the drinks it was $60 for 3 drink that we could not drink  don't go for lunch and get drinks
