McLean J.,"San Jose, CA",156,107,98,3.0,3/12/2012,"Cajun jambalaya pasta with extra sauce Buffalo blasts Red raspberry martini MY FAVORITE PLACE to dine (except maybe for Tlaquepaque) Had a few bad experiences in the past. Received a gift card for one after writing in over their website. And this past Friday, we were given one of those buzzer thingys. After over 45 minutes of waiting, our buzzer never went off. The gal at the front apologized and said, ""yah, sometimes they don't work""- wtf?! Other than that, I will continue to go back to for my beloved above mentioned favorites."
P K.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,3.0,5/22/2014,"The food is good however the wait staff always seem very rushed.  The restaurant is located inside Oakridge so parking is always a challenge if not impossible!  If you can find parking, go in!  The desserts of course are delicious !"
Elizabeth B.,"San Jose, CA",116,110,179,1.0,12/5/2010,"WTF? No Mac and cheese, no calm chowder, no salmon?! No business!!! Me go home!"
Ali B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",25,172,79,5.0,9/5/2014,This is a good place to eat. I have been here several times for various occasions and never have been to disappointed. They have trimmed their menu and come up with some really different stuff. The quality of food and service is great and even though generally it is written in stone that chain restaurants should have 3.5 or less this is far better than some of the mom and pops out there. They have great cheese cake. It is the foundation of this business and we really enjoyed lemon raspberry cream cheese cake. Somewhat it was better in the old times but it seems like everything was better in the old times. It's about that whole nostalgia that takes over our minds and drives us to covet what we don't have anymore so that we can pick on what we do. At the end the IPA beer really works with the mushroom burger and it is now and today that counts best. Or so we may be sitting a few years down the road and being nostalgic about this thing to that we no longer will have.
Ryan V.,"Tracy, CA",118,28,32,4.0,4/1/2011,"The Kobe burger here makes it on my top 5 burgers list, it's that good! I went here with a bunch of friends for lunch. The wait wasn't terribly long as it sometimes is. Our waitress was friendly but she did forget to bring out bread, we had to ask. The portions here are huge, so i suggest ordering off the lunch menu (even lunch portions are big). For dessert we all shared a strawberry short cake which was real good! Quick tips: Steak Diane and the salmon are also good. If you've never been, try their cheesecake, take it togo if you're really full. Raspberry is good as well as the oreo. Ask for Jenna. -Your Friendly Neighborhood Yelp'er"
Kelly M.,"Stockton, CA",84,9,,2.0,3/15/2015,"Maybe this was just an off day, but this was TERRIBLE. First they got our drink order wrong (wanted a virgin daquiri, had to make them waste rum). Next we ordered spinach and cheese dip which basically tasted like frozen spinach and olive oil with a little parmesan on top. Gross. Next was the sweet corn tamales. They were the best part of the whole meal, only reason they get 2 stars. We split a factory burger, which i can say i would have preferred a whopper. The meat was bland, the portion was TINY for $13, the fries were cold and they borough onions on the side not cooked. We had to remind them what was on their menu. When they brought out the grilled onions they were COLD AND SLIMY. Overall I've had better customer service at a McDonald's and better food as well. Speaking of which, the only time we didn't need to flag down a service staff was when he was collecting payment. Nobody ever asked how we were doing, if we were enjoying out meal, anything of that sort. I've been to this place a few times, so I'd be willing to call it a fluke, but they need a more authoritative manager who acts more customer-centric. He didn't offer us anything but platitudes when we lodged our complaints. Just a very bad experience overall."
Rabia H.,"Concord, CA",2,30,7,1.0,11/20/2014,"I have been a big fan of the cheese cake factory because of their diverse menu and delicious food. This location however had the worst service today. I was charged for a side of gravy that is considered a condiment. It's not the few bucks that's a big deal it's how they went about it. I have never been charged for a side of any condiment at any other location before. They however wanted to charge me without even notifying me. After noticing what I thought was an error, I brought it to the waiter's attention he said he must charge for it or should he ask a manager. Then Vincent, the manager, came by and told me that they have to charge me for it, even after I explained. I wasn't happy about it, he then said he will take it off only if I make sure that I would be charged for gravy if I were to ask for extra in the future. It's a very nice location but it is severely lacking customer service specially from the manager."
Anthony C.,"San Jose, CA",70,188,12,5.0,2/11/2013,"I love cheesecake factory! One of my favorite restaurants. The brown bread is delicious! I like to get the Louisiana chicken pasta. The portions are HUGE. It can get me full for 2 meals. Also, dont forget the red velvet at the end. The atmosphere is always really nice. The servers are very friendly. Eric is one of the best."
Hasan K.,"Tracy, CA",9,60,4,5.0,4/2/2013,Went here for dinner a couple times and has really good food. The staff is friendly and if you come here early and check in you most likely not have to wait as long with a small party. I recommend coming here.
Rachel G.,"San Jose, CA",22,78,,3.0,5/27/2011,"I'm probably the only one that dislikes The Cheesecake Factory.  I've been here four times and I really don't enjoy the food.  Each time I've choosen a different dish and every time, it was just ok.   Last weekend, my family and I decided to have dinner here.  I decided on the Pasta Carbornara and it was just ok.  It lacked flavor.  My brother and niece both choose a steak dish, which looked pretty awesome to me. But my brother commented that the Applebee's steak he had was better. However, my other brother liked his Gravy and Biscuits dish.   The only thing that I really enjoy is the cheesecake!"
Katie Anne N.,"San Francisco, CA",631,1335,908,2.0,1/10/2009,Farm raised fish that might have been swimming in a vat with other fishies pooping and eating each others poop. I don't suggest you get the fish.  Cheesecake. Yum.
Sarah L.,"Seven Trees, San Jose, CA",90,39,18,2.0,12/30/2013,"I ate at the Cheesecake Factory on a Sunday night with full knowledge that it would be a little busy. The wait was 45 min like the hostess said. Perfect. We were seated immediately, but it took a while for the server to come by our table. Now, I'm not saying that our server is a bad server, but his service wasnt very good in my experience. Literally visited our table twice- take order and give food. I may look younger, but that doesn't mean your service should be any lower for any customer! We sat down around 8pm ish so it wasnt even that busy anymore. So I expected better service...  I think the menu is too much. Too many options and too much to look at. But, for the most part their food was pretty good.  Miso salmon- $20 , salmon and sauce was so good. Rice- way too dry and grainy. Like, c'mon I'm asian I know good rice....  Mushroom burger-$12,  good sized patty but too much cheese... Kind of overpowered the taste.  BEST PART- red velvet cheesecake. If you are a fan of red velvet, GET THE CHEESECAKE. For a slice it's $9.... But it's so good."
Kay T.,"Zzyzx, CA",8,50,28,5.0,11/10/2010,"I went here after going to the Burke Williams day spa nearby. It was noon and I was ready..........to stuff my face with delicious food! I ordered the lunch pasta (pasta da vinci) with a small salad. My mom went with the 9.99 special which included soup, salad, and half a sandwich. When I got my lunch, it was amazing to look at. The Pasta Da Vinci is basically the ultimate pasta. Tender chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions tossed with parmesean cheese in a creamy, rich madeira wine sauce. From the way it looked, it was like the sort of dish you would see in an upscale restaurant or in a magazine. You could tell that a chef made it to order and it wasn't pre-made or reheated.  The salad looked like a work of art. Mixed greens. It was crisp and refreshing. For a ""small side salad"", I didn't think they would put so much. Verdict: awesome. Whereas, the pasta was al dente, the sauce was creamy, rich, flavorful. From the way it tasted, it seemed like they didn't take a lot of steps to make it. Whatever they did, I am in love with this pasta. If you ever go to the cheesecake factory, you have to order this (unless you can't stand onions or mushrooms like my brother, in which case: you should try it anyway lol).  My mom got the crab bisque soup with a turkey sandwich and one of those ""small"" side salads. For 9.99, the platter was massive. It was totally worth it. The soup was delicious and rich. Chunks of crab (might've been lobster) in a creamy white broth. She ate all of it and was already feeling full, but she still had her sandwich and salad to eat Of course, we couldn't leave without trying some of their famous cheesecakes. I'm not normally a cheesecake fan, but I'll always make an exception for this place. I picked the key lime cheesecake and my mom got a godiva cheesecake with the chocolate tower cake. The key lime cheesecake was creamy, with a citrusy tang that cleans your palate. If you like lighter, fruitier desserts at the end of a heavy meal, like me, get this. Even though the key lime cheesecake was good, I'm secretly hoping that the mango-lime cheesecake makes a comeback (it's my favorite!). The godiva cheesecake would've been insanely good.......had it not been put up against the insanely gargantuan chocolate tower.  The chocolate tower consists of solid layers of chocolate mousse, thick chocolate frosting, thick chocolate shavings, thick fudge chunks and moist chocolate cake, all thrown together to form the ultimate chocolate masterpiece. It is about 8 inches long and massive. I would love to see what the entire cake looks like before they cut it. lol Yet, in terms of flavor, it is not too overwhelming. It has a balance to it, so that all of the awesomeness doesn't overwhelm you at one time. Basically, if you are a chocolate lover, order this dessert and you will not regret it (only if you try to eat all of it in one sitting). lol I only took a few bites at a time because it really is that rich. All of the desserts came with the signature real whipped cream and my tummy was happy for the rest of the day. lol Totally worth it. :)"
Sheena T.,"Silicon Valley, CA",288,450,138,2.0,5/3/2009,"I understand this place is called ""The Cheesecake Factory"", but paying for ONE slice of cheesecake at 7 bucks (tax included) ?! I rest my case.  I would rather eat lunch here than order a slice of cheesecake that costs just as much as a stinkin' entry!"
Sheena M.,"Bronx, NY",4,39,1,5.0,8/27/2014,Mmm their thai lettuce wraps are to die for! I loved the service :) actually going again tonight!
B H.,"Sacramento, CA",49,225,37,2.0,8/13/2011,"It's an ok place. Lots of good atmosphere but the food is a bit lacking. Not that it's bad, just more like it's kind of like McDonald's a bit more on the high end. It feels a bit commercialized and the menu is friggin' huge. Way too much stuff on there to do justice to everytihng.  Not that impressed, it's ok for drinks and appetizers though. They have a nice patio area and the bathrooms were clean."
Rachael S.,"San Jose, CA",10,40,2,2.0,8/2/2013,"Slow service (which, given that I was with my three kids is particularly no okay). Bland food - the ""Skinnylicious"" chicken salad was a pile of  green with *slivers* of chicken that were at first undetectable. My daughters chicken wraps were so bland she only ate half and we both agreed they weren't worth finishing. This we as our second visit and our last. San Jose has much better in this price range."
Donovan T.,"San Jose, CA",694,630,562,3.0,9/4/2009,"I still question myself..why did i used to eat here so much?? I remember when it first opened at Oakridge, all my friends used to have get-togethers and dinner here. Food is OK at best.  I believe there's nothing special. Prices are ""high end"" for a middle class mall like Oakridge.  In general, I always gotten good service here so I can't complain about that. If you're looking for a place to just hang out and drink up, BJs next door is better. Better bartenders, stronger drinks, and cheaper prices. The cheesecake here is CRACK though. Yes its fatty, but its so damn good! haha"
S. P.,"Dublin, CA",1,30,,5.0,3/12/2013,"I think this place is a machine that does it right. Expansive ""make you dizzy"" menu; consistently good food, and nice service. I usually order chicken bellagio or filet mignon. I really appreciate how they accommodate substitutions on your plate. Plus, bartenders are very friendly."
Dell L.,"San Jose, CA",2,26,1,1.0,6/4/2011,"FOOD POISONING!!!!!  I drank a Sam Adams beer with a Grilled Portabella on a bun along with some french fries. Had about 3 bites, I knew something didn't feel right, took it to go, in case it just maybe me? About 2 hours later I was running to the bathroom barfing my brains out. Followed by chills and a fever. Vomiting lasted for 3 hrs on an off. Next day felt like total crap, had to call in sick. Now, I'm at home with a bloated stomach in which it looks like I'm 5 months pr ego, cant even fit in my jeans.. Can barely eat, with out stomach feeling woozy... I'm never eating here again!!"
