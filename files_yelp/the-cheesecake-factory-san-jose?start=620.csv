Paul D.,"San Jose, CA",51,108,114,4.0,10/15/2009,"So much to choose from!  I don't know if that's good or bad. With their menu filled with dozens and dozens of meals, it may take you a while to decide. The CF has been a popular choice of mine to grab a late dinner after the rush.  Their portions are pretty big...for everything! You can share one their signature salads with someone and still get a be full! For those on a budget, you can simply get a good meal and them some with their sandwiches. There has been only one rare moment where I experienced bad service. They are really welcoming! Here are a few of my faves: -Avocado Egg Rolls (Appetizer)- The sauce! -Factory Nachos with Chicken (Appetizer)- Share with 2 others. -Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club (Sandwich)- Towering Sandwich. -Monte Cristo Sandwich (Sunday Brunch)- Deep fried breakfast sandwich! -Baja Chicken Hash (Sunday Brunch)- Mexican Breakfast -Beef Ribs (Steaks & Chops)- Literally falls off the bone! -Grilled Rib Eye (Steaks & Chops)- One of the most succulent steaks I've had -Luau Salad (Salad)- The crispy wonton chips are mmmmm! -Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake (Cheesecake)- Red Velvet, nuff said!"
Alan F.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/20/2014,"So sad to have to write a review about this restaurant. Host/hostess station was so disorganized it took a manger to get parties seated. Total under estimation of wait time, seating parties in reverse order of wait time and misplacing my wait ticket in a location that would have overlooked entirely except for the fact I pointed it out to the staff. Maybe it was new staff but if it wasn't a definite red flag area for management to train, re-train or fire."
DanThu D.,"San Jose, CA",111,219,555,4.0,9/17/2011,"I have been to CF for so many times and at different locations.. They do have very consistent food quality.. I used to love the breads amd butter here the most.. I still love it but maybe i've been exposed to many new places now, so it does not as stand out as before to me.  I love the mahi mahi, grilled salmon, diane steaks.. i've other dishes too and they were pretty good too, but i dont recall the names now..  CF has Sunday brunch menu too. But i dont like it. i've tried their egg benedict. it was not good. I say.. if u want to do breakfast/brunch menu.. CF is probly not a best place to go too.. other than that.. CF is a good place for either family or friends get together or even a date.. The atmostphere is nice.. not too classy..but not too casual as well.. Plus, CF usually locates in the shopping mall, so you can do some shopping after or before filling ur tummy (: At of course, the cheesecake for desserts is gooood!"
Lily N.,"San Jose, CA",43,163,81,3.0,10/7/2013,"Dinners usually have better service and better food. There's always a long wait after 6pm on any given day but it's worth it. The food tastes better, the service is better, and your food isn't cold. Lunch time is always disappointing. There's no wait but the food tend to be worse, the service is lacking, and my food always comes out cold."
Cheryl P.,"Las Vegas, NV",373,191,9,5.0,12/2/2010,"I will always love Cheesecake Factory. LOVE LOVE LOVE I SAY! If I get crappy service one day, I'll just come another day to another server. And thankfully, the service is better. I usually don't get crappy service here though.  Weird, I usually talk about food first, then service. Oh well. Now on to the food. My all time fave: Chicken Piccata! I love it because it's a creamier version of chicken piccata. It goes rather nicely with the pasta. Mix the sauce with the pasta and add a bit of the chicken and bam! Explosion of the reduced white whine, a slight tang of the lemon, the creaminess from the (you guessed it) CREAM, and the saltiness of the capors. OoOO wee--! I love it!  Now, you all know that there is several choices there. I can't guarantee they will all be good. I've heard the sweet and sour was a bit eh. I do like the chicken salad sandwich (that crunchy bread is to die for!). The new small plates menu is pretty awesome. YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THE VIETNAMESE TACOS. I can't even describe them. They are just crazy delicioius. And really, one of those for 5.95 fills me up. If you don't find something you like, please give it another chance. Get something else next time. And one word for the cheesecake... HEAVEN!"
Alex S.,"Fremont, CA",19,21,,1.0,4/26/2015,"Been there several times specially this time was the worse experience. My pasta Da Vinci had  pieces of sausage in it besides the chicken then after 15 minutes they made another one full of water guess they call it sauce. The server kinda brushed it off when I mention the water based sauce. Called and talk to the manager and she keep asking questions and making me repeat the same answers over and over, maybe she thought I wanted a free meal. They need to work on there people skills specially when someone calls to bring something bad to there attention .paid for the food that I didn't even eat. That's all I have to say. Very bad experience bad food and bad management . I will never go back."
Christel J.,"San Jose, CA",30,4,1,5.0,2/3/2013,"I love the cheesecake factory! This is the place I am always down to go to for lunch/dinner. If I wanna celebrate something, it's definitely one of the first places that I want to go to. I always get pasta so I never tried much of their other food but the pastas that I have tried (louisiana chicken, carbonara, alfredo fettucine) are reallyyy good and the portions are huuuge so I always have left overs for the next day. I think that their mac and cheese balls are to die for! Definitely the appetizer I get but I usually don't get an appetizer so I have more room for my pasta. I've also had their alcholic beverages. I've had the long island tea and the pineapple mojito. They were both good and let me tell you, they do not skimp you on the alcohol. They were strongg and I got buzzed off one of em. Also love the complimentary bread! Their cheesecakes are also reallyyyyy good but I never have room =\ The wait is sometimes a little long but it's definitely worth it and I love their service here."
Ashley J.,"Cupertino, CA",15,15,2,3.0,12/21/2011,"Pretty varied experiences here. Sometimes we've had to frequently remind our server to get the bill, bring some water, or bring to-to boxes. I'll focus on the foods then. The spicy meat pizza is the best. It combines three things I love: spicy, meat, and pizza. I'll admit that cheesecake factory entrees are calorie ridden and not very good for you but with pizza it's easier to stop myself and save a slice or two for later and have it still taste good! After all, the free bread is pretty filling. On the other hand, I did not enjoy my eggs Benedict at all. The eggs were overcooked and half the plate was just hash browns. For the price, that much potato was kinda a cop out. Mostly I'm just annoyed by the overcooked eggs though.  Overall, service is a gamble since they have so many people working here. You can expect the atmosphere to be clean and neat since it's a chain. Stick to the safer pastas and pizzas that they seem to be better at and for your own health, try not to finish the whole entree in one sitting..."
Jaclyn D.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,1,5.0,6/6/2012,"I came here with my mom just for appetizers and drinks.  I loved their fried artichokes.  I was driving so I just got iced tea, but my mom loved her red raspberry drink.   The server was great too even though we didn't order much, he treated us great."
Paul R.,"San Jose, CA",399,76,45,3.0,9/30/2013,"My overall experience was good. I don't eat at cheezcake very often so I wasnt expecting anything spectacular. First we walk in and the hosts girls tell us its a 20min wait to sit at a booth but meanwhile we can sit at a high top table while we wait and order our food. Then after about 15mins they tell us we cannot move tables even after we ordered our food. The place was not even packed!! And the hostess was rude. Although thanks to brian, the manager our experience deserved another star. I appreciated his hospitality and even the fact that he personally served us."
Molly L.,"Vancouver, WA",51,7,,5.0,10/19/2010,"I brought my mom here yesterday to celebrate her birthday. The hostess was nice and got us seated quickly. Our waitress Kimmy was incredibly helpful and patient with my mom as she had a few questions about various dishes. I was craving artichoke so we got the artichoke appetizer. It was good with or without the dipping sauces they provide and there was plenty for both of us to share.  We also got one entree that we split between us - Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It claims to come with pine nuts, but when it arrived we couldn't seem to find them. After asking the waitress about it she offered to get us some more pine nuts, no problem! We made sure to save room for dessert and we each got a slice of cheesecake. I got Oreo and my mom got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, which was phenomenal. Lots of leftovers for the next day, and the (half-eaten) cheesecake is still delicious right out of the freezer! Kimmy, if you're reading this, thanks again! :D"
sherri j.,"San Jose, CA",23,3,,1.0,2/15/2015,"Absolutely terrible service 90% of times, meals come at totally different times at the same table, Long wait for sitting & even longer to get your food. Horrible curb side pickup service 2 hrs sitting in the parking and still no food!!! Never again!"
Jose H.,"Salinas, CA",5,25,7,4.0,9/17/2013,Service is good and scenery is typical beautiful cheescake factory scenery. Kind of cool how its in a mall too.
Ms. Y.,"Campbell, CA",270,540,112,4.0,5/7/2011,"*This review update is for happy hour only* I found h.h. to be much more expensive then other places nearby such as B.J.'s. However, everything was delicious and our waiter was very friendly.  Be warned though ( if you have food allergies like my friend) Our waiter was seemed new. Although did his best to find out what was in the food, he too was misinformed. We ended up with something on one of our plates that could have potentially had us running to the hospital. Luckily she caught it in time and she was fine.  I love come here but for 3 people, drinks and only a few appetizers added up to 100 bucks. That's too rich for my blood.. JUST for happy hour. Can you imagine how much it would have been otherwise? I think I will be sticking to dinner here or dessert every once in a while like i usually do. :p"
Simi K.,"Fremont, CA",48,41,20,5.0,1/18/2013,"absolutely love this location, yes a wait is something to expected. Food and  service is well worth the wait. If you were to ask my daughter where shall we go she will say Cheesecake Factory in a heart beat.  I've been to few other locations but as always we come back to this specific location. Service is great and portion size are exactly as one can expect. Previously we went to another location in Dublin and we order the same dish for  my two kids under the age of 5 . my kids finished and and had no left overs. I didn't take note till same incident happened twice at this location yet in San Jose one Alfredo pasta is enough for both my kids and have left overs. I mentioned this to someone else and i was told oddly portions seem to be the same complaint...  i love the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta haven't found a place who can match up to this flavor.   But over all love this place and we are regulars for dinner and cheesecake to take home... love the pecan pumpkin cheesecake which is seasonal sadly."
Brandon L.,"Fremont, CA",40,301,83,1.0,9/13/2014,"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE SMALL KIDS.  We are a fan of cheesecake factory because they have a broad menu and family friendly atmosphere.  We come here pretty often but after waiting for 1/2 hour for a table + 1 hour long just for our food tonight we probably would never come back.  I feel completely bad for our 3 years old who wanted spaghetti noodle for his meal but end up eating bread for his dinner so by the time his food came he's too full.  The server and manager came out 4 times to apologies but still no food in sight.  We had a new born and a toddler and its totally ruin our dinner.  I think it would take must faster for me to cook and clean up at home than eating here.  At the end we still have to pay for our entire bill.  Management here really careless about customer satisfactory.  I think PF Chang down the alley would win us over from our last time visit because they don't have long line, good customer service, good food and great price."
Francine A.,"Monterey, CA",87,32,39,4.0,8/31/2013,"Food was delish! I had the chicken meridian.  Our waiter is a douche and has had about three cig breaks! Wondering where he is, but other than that great experience."
Paul Y.,"San Jose, CA",20,124,1,4.0,7/29/2011,"One of my favorite meals are here at the cheesecake factory:  cheeseburger, fries, and a glass of Franciscan cabernet....it goes all together nicely!  Factory burrito is awesome too."
Mania M.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/11/2014,"I used to go there and I was a big fan honestly. But 3weeks ago I went there and we had a bad experience. Our lunch made us sick so I called when I got better to let them know, they were super nice and promised on following up but never happened! I was so upset and called after 2weeks again same scenario..."
Krissy S.,"San Jose, CA",173,225,77,4.0,7/16/2008,"Ok... so we tend to frequent this place since it's open late night and it has nice eye candy...  recently I've tried the cheesesteak which really hit the spot, lots of meat, peppered and cheesy served with fries...  the chicken sliders appetizer is reallllly good... lil fried chicken sandwiches and you add your own lettuce, tomato, pickles, and either regular mayo or a seasoned mayo.   I believe they got rid of the goulash just like they got rid of my all time favorite pesto pasta with chicken and mushrooms... they will pay for this!!!  booo =P   So the new and improved great server list includes Jared and Jenea... not sure if that's how you spell her name but yeah...   if you're there ask for either of them and you will not be disappointed!!"
