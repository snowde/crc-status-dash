Liaty Z.,"Los Gatos, CA",57,201,7,1.0,2/17/2013,"I left a shopping bag here from Nordstrom Rack (with new clothes, receipt in tact) and it was stolen.  The employees were extremely cavalier about it, and did nothing to remedy the fact that my items were not returned to lost and found and were probably stashed away, just minutes after I left the table.  I doubt this review is going to change the fact that there is a one hour wait just to sit down at this place on a Sunday night, but having your property stolen is not okay."
Janis A.,"San Jose, CA",166,308,215,3.0,1/5/2011,"As much as I enjoy dining at Cheesecake Factory, I value being able to leave the restaurant in one piece. I mean, really... what is up with the super slippery floors?!?!?! In heels, I slowly & carefully walk to the ladies room, probably looking like a paranoid idiot just so I don't slip, fall, and make a fool of myself in front of other guests. Recently, in FLATS (with rubber soles!), the fiance and I were making our way to our table (at a normal pace), and STILL... totally almost slipped and fell had I not grabbed my fiance's arm to hold me up. Ridiculous. Other than that, good food and our waiter, Tyler, was awesome. Not once did we have to flag him down for a re-fill - he was very attentive and courteous, which I very much appreciated. Quick tip: Factory Nachos - appetizer good for like 4-6 people!!! My fiance and I got this as our appetizer, killed 1/3 of it, and could barely eat a bite of our entrees, which sucked because I was really looking forward to savoring my Shrimp Bistro Pasta, my fave :)"
Anita S.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,1.0,1/17/2016,"The food is good but the service is HORRIBLE. I love Cheesecake Factory and this is the worst one I've been to. Service has always been slow and super rude. I usually always go to valley fair or sf to eat at this chain but tonight I did take away for just a cheesecake and a soda (one slice of ready made cheesecake mind you). They said 10 min. I got there parked and waited 50 min!!! Constantly calling and being ""transferred to bakery"" WHICH IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MAIN DESK -literally you could just yell and ask rather than transfer me. THE CHEESECAKE WAS READY MADE WHY WAS IT TAKING SO DAMN LONG. So finally I pull a random waitress aside (Lisa) and tell her what's going on- she goes to get my soda which wasn't even ready and grabs my bag to go from the cheesecake- seriously it was ready to go and they kept ""transferring"" me to bakery. My soda wasn't even ready. Worst experience ever and I already hated this location. Never coming back- stick up north to valley fair. MUCH better."
Joy S.,"San Jose, CA",260,30,20,3.0,8/8/2011,"I definitely like coming to this Cheesecake Factory over the one in Valley Fair because it doesn't have as long of a wait time as the other one does and also A LOT easier to find parking.  Their servings are huge so I can never actually have enough room to eat their cheesecakes, which they also give you huge slices as well. I always get their Chicken and Biscuits here because they have a really good gravy with the dish. Lately, I've been coming for their happy hour, which has some good deals on some small appetizers and I always get a mojito with my orders. It's sweet but definitely watered down.  It's a nice place to go to at the mall when you don't want to go to the food court or deal with how loud BJ's gets at times."
Steve M.,"McKinleyville, CA",0,13,,4.0,4/2/2012,We had a miserable experience trying to find parking.  We should have just paid to valet park.  We ended up dealing with traffic trying to get to get higher up in the parking structure. The food and service though were very consistent and one of the reasons we keep coming back to various Cheesecake Factorys.  I had the Barbeque Chicken Salad which is always great.  My favorite though is the Spicy Cashew Chicken. My wife got the Chicken Marsala which is always very good too. I really liked that they had Coke Zero which is hard to find in restaurants. I would normally give Cheesecake Factories five stars but I'll subtract one because of the parking hassle here.  I will look for another one in the area the next time I visit.
Julie S.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,3.0,1/6/2014,"The Good:  The food is very fresh.  Portions are smaller than they used to be--but they used to be outrageously large.   The Bad:  The service was hit and miss.  One person in our party had a hamburger and French fries--but after delivering the food, our waiter disappeared and it took 10 minutes to get some catsup.  We finally asked another waiter to bring it to the table. The Ugly:   After so many years, the décor is getting really old.  I've always thought it was cheesy."
Gabriel G.,"San Jose, CA",123,28,7,4.0,3/22/2011,"Just had dinner there and I must say... It was to DIE for!! I had fried cheese, which I was guessing would have been something just mediocre, and boy was I wrong, it was amazing. ""Make you wanna slap yo' mama!"" Then I had the fried Mac & Cheese (Yes as you can see i LOVE cheese), it was so rich and creamy, it was just perfect. I definitely recommend this place, the staff were very attentive and helpful. what are you doing still reading this... GO NOW!!!"
Jacqueline N.,"San Jose, CA",312,248,84,4.0,8/15/2011,"Went to dinner last night with a girlfriend because I was craving something indulgent and tasty. I got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta which was delicious. i still have leftovers! I would have never ordered this if I hadn't tried my friends the last time I was here. It's a penne pasta with with a sweet side and a little kick. There are also little crispers on top that you mix in that help give it a crunch. No appetizer today. Just bread and butter, bread and butter, bread and butter. My friend got the tuna salad. It was actually good! seared tuna with mixed greens, avocado and tomatoes. The portion of the tuna was pretty decent. Must try that when I feel like eating 'light.' (that's not too often :x) I was here a couple weeks before-- got the crispy fried artichoke hearts under their 'small appetizers.' i love artichokes and it's very good here. you might need more of the dip though since it comes in this minuscule bowl. That time I went I got the lemon herb roasted chicken. mmmmmm the sauce and seasoning on it was so good, brah. (inside joke) again, i didn't finish my plate (trust me there was a lot. i'm not a light eater)"
Vanessa U.,"San Jose, CA",25,223,57,5.0,9/8/2012,"Star increase simply because The Cheesecake Factory has become a happy hour favorite. Five dollar cocktails plus their small plates and appetizer menus equals a big win for me. I usually order a few JW's Pink Lemonades, but if pink girly drinks aren't your taste, they also serve select beers on tap during happy hour. As for appetizers, their Crispy Crab Wontons, Fried Calamari, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, Buffalo Blast, and Papas Bravas are all delicious selections. Their happy hour is Monday thru Friday, from 4pm to 6pm. =)"
Cathy N.,"San Jose, CA",333,45,189,4.0,10/25/2013,My boyfriend and I like to stop by here before we leave the mall to get cheesecake our favorite is red velvet cheesecake. Next time we come we would like to try pumpkin cheesecake.
Aliya C.,"Tracy, CA",2,55,10,4.0,3/19/2013,Went for dinner with my family and had a great time. Food was great and services was great too. The only thing I don't like is the wait. Waiting to be seated and waiting for the food. Sorry but I am very impatient
Gabriela G.,"San Jose, CA",33,37,35,4.0,12/30/2010,"This place is packed on Thursday night, maybe b/c it is close to new year eve. The front desk quote us a 40 mins wait for 2, we believe it will be longer than that! We found 2 spots at the bar 15 mins after arrival. The service is a bit slow, but the staff and bartender are courteous. We love the Vietnamese Tacos (roast pork and the pickled cucumber, perfect combination) and Blueberry CC (my hubby's favorite- not as sweet as the other CC)."
Mike R.,"Morgan Hill, CA",18,50,4,4.0,4/20/2011,"Going to The Cheesecake Factory used to be such a super event and now it's not so exciting as some of the luster has worn off. However, the kids enjoy it so we still go. Had an unfortunate event this last time, however.  Long story short, the lettuce on my son's kid's slider burgers was brown and crusty. I'm assuming that it was because it was placed on the side of the burger and kept under the heat lamp until the rest of the food was ready. But worse than that, there was a string in my meatloaf! At first I thought it was a very course hair (which would have been worse).  The saving grace was the manager who was on it like white on rice. He's the reason my review went from 1-2 stars to 4. He took care of the bill and got me a new order all wrapped up to go. I know this type of stuff sometimes happens and it just comes down to how the establishment reacts.  That being said, I can't imagine us not going to The Cheesecake Factory but hopefully next time we won't have to see the manager for foreign objects in our food!"
Chrissy N.,"Seattle, WA",193,483,13,2.0,7/12/2010,"To keep it short and simple: The cheesecake is the sh!t. The food just tastes like sh!t. There are always a jillion little kids and mallrats. It get's old. It's often too loud to talk to your friends and the waiters are super hit or miss. I once ordered a the cheese-stuffed mushrooms, and the cheese on the inside was still ICE COLD. Like, not even melted cold. We wait nearly 20 minutes for our waiter to come, told him and then he just wanted to replace it. No appology. No thanks. Suck it. Not coming back....unless its for the cheesecake."
Alena B.,"Silicon Valley, CA",157,821,21,2.0,6/5/2011,I really don't get the appeal.  The wait is long and the food is mediocre.  They don't even have a children's menu which is a bummer.  The menu is HUGE which means that they do a little bit of everything and nothing very well.  I always opt for the chicken pasta because it's a safe bet.  The Teriyaki chicken wasn't great...i guess the potstickers are okay too.  The two stars I am giving it is for the cheesecake...which is OF COURSE delicious!   Please please please go somewhere else for date night....go to some cute little local hole in the wall in support of local businesses and find something amazing rather than waiting with a pager for 45 minutes outside this place with everyone else.  It's really nothing special...unless you are getting cheesecake!
Neon D.,"San Jose, CA",155,92,9,5.0,5/7/2010,"I am a weekly regular to CCF and let me give you the rundown.. bullet points, no less: (let's start off with the good stuff, shall we?) * Amazing food selection. You feel like going Tuna crazy? You can! I love the Tataki Rare Tuna salad which comes with the most divine dressing ever! The fried tuna rolls are to die for and every other rare tuna dish they serve is top-notch. * If you feel like pigging out, then this is your spot. The servings are SO huge that I took home HALF of my meal and told my fiance it was the meal I bought for him. He believed it!!! I'm evil, too! The waitress even helped me add extra garnish and was in on my plan! Muahhhh! * The staff (except for the hostesses, sorry) are freaking amazing. We've had waiters that looked like Dolce & Gabbana models. They are all fun and we always end up talking about some crazy customer or annoying kid in the restaurant. I love it! The sad part is, I never get the same person and I do have my favorites! It is fun to mix it up though. I like to sit outside in the summer. The hostess staff hasn't always been so friendly, sometimes all-out snobby and snappy. Ew, honey, you ain't that cute to have that kind of attitude.  * Ok, so I think I crossed into 'the bad things' territory. It takes forever to get the hell out of there. I think I spend at least 2 hours in there just at a casual dinner on a Thursday or Saturday night. Sometimes I don't want cheesecake, but am a sucker for that damned Red Velvet Cheesecake. I get it every single time and once ate the entire thing by myself. Ughh. the shame! The only thing they are missing is a wheelchair service because I can't walk when I'm through with dessert! I've given thousands of my dollars to CCF over the span of 3 years and from them, have acquired the biggest waistline I've ever had. Wow.. and I don't feel dirty saying it was worth it."
Kelly B.,"San Jose, CA",99,225,167,3.0,7/30/2008,"Six of us celebrating Mom and Dad's FIFTY-NINTH wedding anniversary.  It was also The Cheesecake Factory's anniversary, which meant that all cheesecakes were 1.50.  Wow, cool! The food was good, I had a mini-pizza and a salad.  Portions were huge, we all took home boxes of food,  enough for dinner tonight!  The menu was fresh, everyone found something that they liked, even my dad, who is a picky eater (he was severely challenged when we took him to Bennihana!) said that his fish and chips were the best he's ever had.  My sister said that was because they started with Ahi tuna! This is one BIG restaurant!  It is HUGE!  There must be fifty tables in the restaurant, and perhaps why it feels like you are in a big barn, with food being shoveled out at you.  It would be the relationship with your food server that could make or break your dining experience, because this is the one thing that distinguishes you from those other tables. A word about the service.  Well, it wasn't rude, it was just...  well, it's hard to put a finger on it.  Let's just say... it wasn't warm and it wasn't attentive.  We had to flag our waiter down for more bread (he brought one basket of three breads for our table of six, one of whom was having just a salad).  When we told him it was Mom and Dad's anniversary, he said, ""oh, kewl (the all lower case is on purpose, because that's how he said it: all lower case).""  One of the weirdest things was that other waiters came looking to see if we were ok, and one, when checking on us said in a really snippy way, ""Well, _you're_ ok!"" and rushed off.  It was really strange, but it's about what you can expect when you are being waited on my 18- to 20-year-old waiters and waitresses.  So, there it is, it all comes down to attitude.   Would I go there again?  Sure, it would be perfect to meet girlfriends for lunch or for an appetizer when shopping."
caneisha h.,"San Jose, CA",63,114,24,4.0,5/21/2013,The side of mac n cheese and edamame is on my radar twice a week. The mac is so bomb and its the perfect appetizer portion. A second runner up for appetizers is the chix taquitos! For meals and date night its all about the chix piccata. Instead of angel hair pasta ask for mashed potatoes yummy!!! As far as cheesecake godiva is my choice its excellent!
Daniel B.,"San Jose, CA",1,7,1,2.0,11/8/2011,"Ordered some takeout from this location and picked it up curbside. Food was not ready on time as promised, 20 min later they come out to my vehicle with the food, girl who helped me was very friendly and professional. I did not bother to check the order in detail, just glanced in the bags and the big items i ordered were there, however when I got home, I noticed i was missing a few key things.  #1 Buffalo sauce ordered on the side of the Crispy chicken sandwiches was not there. If you have had this sandwich before you know it is very dry without the sauce.  #2 Ranch ordered on the side was missing #3 Salad had no dressing #4 Food was very cold. I am a 2 min drive from this location and the fact that it was cold when i got home tells me it was ready when I originally got there to pick it up, it just sat there waiting for someone to bring it out.  I will never order food for curbside pickup again from here."
Melissa S.,"Los Gatos, CA",55,88,17,4.0,3/24/2013,"huge portions, huge prices, huge calorie count but sooo good. I only come here for special occasions because of the price. I don't think I've ordered anything that wasn't good. Be careful when you go though, wait times can be lengthy."
