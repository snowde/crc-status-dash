Toni C.,"Benicia, CA",96,56,4,4.0,12/17/2012,"I don't know why I like the Cheesecake Factory so much.  Maybe it's because even though it's a chain restaurant it's on the upscale side?  I don't know.  I just know I like coming here and I like the looks of the place. My Hub and I were served by the lovely and gracious Vera H.  I wasn't in a very pleasant mood when we arrived (it was on the warm side and the air conditioner in the car wasn't working right.  :(  but sweet Vera was very patient and I'd say even kind to me.  ;)  The Hub ordered an iced tea and I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.  Things started looking better after the LIIT.  ;)  We both ordered a bowl of clam chowder (as we are continually on a quest for the definitive clam chowder) and the Crab and Artichoke Dip appetizer.  Although the clam chowder was very good and full of clams, celery, potatoes and all the other goodies, I wouldn't say it was the definitive clam chowder.  Still, it was good and I would order it again.  But oh!  Was the dip ever yummy!  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was served on crunchy baked and seasoned french bread strips; the dip had a very delicate flavor of it's own, and it had to ""fight"" with the flavor and crunchiness of the french bread.  I used the softer bread that was served in the basket  and found that it tasted so much better.  You could actually taste the flavor of the crab!  Huzzah!  We should've stopped there, but no.  We ordered (and shared) a Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira Combination plate.  I think I have finally found my favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory.  The beef was covered in mushrooms and cooked to medium rare and was so tender and delicious.  The chicken was covered in mushrooms and cheese and served with a delicious sauce.  The dish is served with mashed potatoes. If that wasn't enough, we got a slice of ""Original"" (New York Style) cheesecake to go.  No way did we have the room to eat it there. This was above and by far the best eating experience we've had at the Cheesecake Factory.  We've always enjoyed our food when we've eaten there, but last night's meal topped them all. 9/22/2012 / First posted 12-17-2012"
Ana C.,"San Jose, CA",68,74,62,4.0,11/4/2010,"Love cheesecake, therefore i love this place. I like many items on the menu such as the grilled shrimp and bacon club, the sliders, Caesar salad and four cheese pasta. My favorite cheesecake is the chris's outrageous and the red velvet. Parking here can suck as this location is in a mall."
Connie C.,"San Francisco, CA",118,124,39,3.0,1/5/2011,"Party of 12 on New Year's Day. Not the best idea, but I was there early to get us a table. They tell me 45 mins, okay, that's about when the rest of the party will get there.  We ended up waiting an hour and a half. We were waiting on tables who camped out for like 30-60mins after they paid their bill... Well at least our waitress was funny. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was surprisingly good, despite the fact that I don't like bell peppers or spicy food. The portions are a little small for ~$15, but there is unlimited free bread to fill you up!  What they don't tell you is that the birthday chocolate cheesecake is another $8! I never knew that. They write your name along the plate and sing to you. The cake itself is kind of heavy for my taste.  The decor - does anyone know what the Egyptian theme has to do with cheesecake?!"
Linh N.,"Milpitas, CA",359,50,10,4.0,1/6/2011,"This was my first time at this cheese cake factory so of course I have to give a review. I came here for a secret santa event with my friends and it was shortly before christmas so naturally parking was a pain (not that I was driving hehe).  We didn't have reservations because we made a change of plans from our original restaurant so we did have to wait; surprisingly the wait wasn't as long as we thought considering we had a huuuuge group. As we were seated in this lengthy booth, they quickly got us our drinks and as we ordered and waited for our food they constantly came to check up if we need refills...personally this annoys me but I know they're just trying to maintain good customer service so I just kind of shrugged it off. I did love the fact that they had bread out while we waited, restaurants are doing that less and less now. I got the four cheese pasta like I do at every other restaurant because I loooooooooove pasta.  The entrees were meh; not bad and at the same time not exactly something I would rave about.  For some reason my dish tasted better after I took it home and microwaved it the next day. Their bathrooms were clean and spacious like any other decent restaurant bathroom. Overall, this was a good experience...however I don't think I'm fit to review this place since I didn't even have any cheese cake. :|"
Sheila P.,"Tracy, CA",1513,752,1501,3.0,3/8/2010,"We came to dinner here with Dave's parents. We were the first to arrive from our group and walked in through the mall, they had a lot of empty tables but told us we had a twenty minute wait for our group of 4. Twenty five minutes later we were seated and our server explained the specials of the day. She took our drinks order and returned 15 minutes later with warm bread and our drinks. There menu is HUGE - not kidding - like a booklet with ads and everything! After persuing for awhile we decided to order: Appetizer -Thai Lettuce Cups - 4 stars (we shared this between the four of us since it's large portion) Dad wanted the soup of the day which our server had recommened not 10 minutes ago but she returned to tell us that were out! Should have checked prior to making the recommendation.. oh well! Dad settled on a green salad... he said it was okay good. Mom also had a salad - the goat cheese with the spring mix and cherry vinagrette which she enjoyed. Dave had their coconut chicken and shrimp curry which came with rice, he said it was good and liked it. He liked the toasted coconit garnished all over the curry. I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Chicken and Shrimp which ame with rice and plaintains. The plaintains were a little over cooked and mushy but the rest of the dish was okay -it missed the pepper kick I was looking for. The ambience was nice, they have a full bar and the service was a little slow. The food portions are huge, I made two meals out of mine, by taking left overs for lunch the next day."
Maronita I.,"San Jose, CA",314,77,8,3.0,4/1/2010,"3.5 stars rounded up... I am a bit biased since this was my first job when I moved to SJ. I worked here for 9 months and learned how to truly take care of guests because their training is very intense.  They have to follow 12 steps of service such as: Greeting time, ticket times, refolding your napkin if you get up, showing you to the restroom if you should ask, always bringing share plates when an app is ordered, proper silverware for certain items, wet naps for messy items, etc etc.  (If you come here and don't get good service it's because their best server is gone.. ME who else did you think I was talkin about. LOL. jk) This restaurant is ridiculous...they have a book for a menu.  There are about 200 menu items making it extremely hard to decide. While you are browsing the pages, the server will bring you sourdough and pumpernikel bread (yaaa i said it.. PUMPERNIKEL w/ Oats on it) and REAL butter pats. To top it off it's fresh baked on site.  Some of my favorties are as follows: ****Jamaican Black Peper Shrimp--served with white rice, black beans, fried plantains and a mango salsa--outta this world good. HUGE PLATE!!! *****Firecracker Salmon Rolls Appetizer---kinda spicy so watch out if you're a woosie! *****Sante Fe Chicken Salad----all time fave. It's drizzled with their very own spicy peanut sauce. *****Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake---3 layers of chocolate goodness. Those are just a few to name...You must try it if you never have. If you have and had a bad experience...give it another shot. When asking for a table be sure to ask for their best server...(most likely you will get a ""D.T""..which means a designated trainer. These guys are super passtionate about their job and they will take great care of you. Last night, Paul served my GF and I... he was awesome. I got their Arugula Salad and it came out lookin old and tired...he didn't charge me for it, which was nice. She and I shared the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, it comes with ff but we got a salad. I alwaysss add buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing to mine; it's outta this world. If you feel too stuffed after dinner --- and i promise you will --- take some cheesecake to go. You won't regret it.  P.S. Cheesecake makes alllllllll of their dressings and sauces from scratch on site.  The cheesecakes are made at the bakery off site. Definitely a great place for a one on one or a group gathering."
Leena C.,"Houston, TX",152,385,129,4.0,2/20/2011,"We stopped here after a long day of travel - Houston to Salt Lake to San Jose :) Since this was my first time ever eating at this restaurant, my mate ordered for us. For appetizers, we had the avocado eggrolls and I had the orange chicken. I loved the avocado eggrolls because I love avocados! They were very delicious. I was a bit weary of the orange chicken entree but it turned out to be very good.  Overall, the experience was a thumbs up!"
Maria N.,"San Jose, CA",121,112,58,3.0,12/18/2010,"This place is alright, sometimes you can have your good and bad experience. I love the mashed potatoes it is really creamy. I usually get the Chicken Madeira and i love it most of the time; however, they give you a big portion so be prepared to get a to-go box. I avoid eating the bow tie pastas, they are way too plain, hard, and dry for my taste.  The customer service is ""ok"" , only problem was that our waitress kept coming back to check up on us way too much. We got our stuffed-mushrooms appetizer and she comes back asking if they tasted good when we didn't even eat it yet. She refilled our drinks when it didn't need to be refilled. So it was really difficult for my friend and i to enjoy our meal when we keep getting interrupted.  I recommend not going here with a huge group because your wait will be very long,even if you reserve ahead of time. On busy nights the wait is 45minutes, but with a big group expect an hour and a half max."
Uyen L.,"San Jose, CA",297,158,53,4.0,3/2/2011,"Whenever I crave for cheesecake I come running here. Their cheesecake is so delicious! (hence the name CHEESECAKE factory) I always order the fresh strawberry, simple and always satisfying. At $6 a slice its worth every penny.  As for the main entree when I'm craving for pasta I usually order the pasta da vinci, light and creamy sauce. It comes with chicken, but I substitute it for shrimp which is just as good. The one dish that I hold dear to my heart is the MISO SALMON. I can't get this dish anywhere else, but here! I am drooling as we speak.... *drools"
Cap P.,"Campbell, CA",209,164,251,3.0,1/26/2009,"Friday Night - 7:15pm Cons: * 45 minute wait for a party of 2 * The waiter took about 10 minutes to greet us at our table and take a drink order after we had been seated. * The waiter was over worked as it was and not very attentive. * Self parking is impossible Pros: * Very nice bar staff while we waited for our table * Entree portions are gigantic * Valet parking ($6) * Cheesecakes are awesome.  As they should be. Costs:  2 beers, 1 glass of wine, 1 salad, 1 soup, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees.  - $78 after tax and tip."
Selina S.,"Campbell, CA",52,307,237,3.0,3/4/2013,Had my first not so good meal at cheesecake which is so disappointing. My alcoholic beverage was super weak. The meatloaf sandwich was just not good at all. Blah! I'll go back since I love Cheesecake Factory.
D D.,"Hollister, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/20/2014,Good food my daughter loves there pasta Alfredo. The service is great when you eat in from my experience.The only bad thing is the crowd.
Nedda S.,"Petaluma, CA",0,44,,4.0,7/29/2011,"Those stars are for the fresh strawberry cheesecake. Ruined me for all other cheesecake.  The food is mediocre. There sure is an insane selection- i've never seen a menu BOOK like it anywhere else.  Average pricing. Large portions. Takes forever to get your food. Service is friendly. Restaurant clean.  Just the cheesecake gives them 4 stars, although i do daydream about it."
Alecia R.,"San Jose, CA",340,114,,4.0,9/15/2010,Very friendly service.. Attentive and genuine  Our server made sure to get our order right and have everything ready just the way my friend and I ordered it. The food was ok.. quality wise it was not that great. -1 star for the gypsy looking woman going from table to table begging for money.. really annoying especially since im trying to have a nice lunch with my friend.. The management needs to take care of this issue
ann b.,"San Jose, CA",26,17,,5.0,7/19/2012,"The food is amazing! At our last visit in June our waiter, Michael, was absolutely fantastic. We were a party of at least 20 and he provided some of the best service I've received in a restaurant in a long time. Everyone loved their meals and enjoyed the free refills, birthday singing, and outstanding service! Everything you order there is delicious, especially the louisiana chk pasta. Yum!"
Aaron S.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,1,1.0,11/22/2011,"Anyone who rates this place 3 stars or above has no idea what good food tastes like. I ordered a pizza, Little Cesar's 5 dollar pizzas taste much better. Ordered Bang Bang shrimp, my college roommate made better bang bang shrimp with an electric wok.  I ordered Shrimp Franchese, the the noodles came out clumped together, sauce was bland, and the shrimp wasn't  breaded correctly. Ordered Pasta Madeira/ Davinci, came out too salty for my taste and I actually like salty food.  There are other platters, but I try to limit my reviews.  In summary, Cheesecake factory should stick to cheesecake."
Loren H.,"San Jose, CA",4,5,,2.0,7/13/2013,"Every time I eat here I get sick. The cheesecake is amazing but the food is too rich. Very generous portions which is a plus. However last time I ate here I had the carlton salad (amazing!) but when I got towards the end I found a hair in it! (GROSS!!!), I pointed it out to the waitress and she took it away, it still ended up on the bill (I wasn't gonna make a scene in the restaurant but c'mon there was a hair in it why should anyone be charged for that?) I'll probably only return for cheesecake..."
sonya h.,"San Jose, CA",123,599,48,3.0,4/5/2010,"I came here several times for dinner cuz it's close to home.  I can't say the food is here great but they are not bad either.  Most of the time, it's very heavy and oily though.  The only thing I really love here is the bread they give you.  It's always fresh, soft and tasty.  I also came here for Sunday brunch which was pretty good.  I normally skip the cheesecake dessert because the calorie count is pretty high. Service is normally above average but it depends on the server you get."
Helen D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",459,1111,27612,3.0,1/8/2013,"I've always liked this chain restaurant. The warm signature bread at the beginning is always a promising set up. Food here came out fast but it didn't taste as good as the other locations.  The chicken dish I ordered was a bit bland and dry so after a few bites, I to-goed it to reconstitute at home. Like that was any better."
Marshall C.,"San Jose, CA",90,141,5,3.0,1/31/2011,"Food is average. Large portion. Priced right. Disorganized at the front. The hostess wouldn't give me an answer on how long the wait would be even after I asked several times. I couldn't decided whether to stay and wait or just leave. I was seated in 15 minutes which is acceptable, but not knowing at all how long I might have to wait annoyed me. My waitress was overly attentive and friendly. I suppose some would consider it excellent service, but I personally prefer to be left alone to eat. Just an observation."
