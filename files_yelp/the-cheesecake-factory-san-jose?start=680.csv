Vanessa L.,"San Jose, CA",25,116,3,4.0,8/27/2012,"I hate the parking so that is the minus one star. Other than that, this is my favorite cheesecake factory because it is huge. There is hardly any wait time like the other one at Stevens Creek. The food is good, prices are fair, and the service is always on point."
CarpeDiem C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,58,,3.0,8/3/2014,"I have eaten inside this location and have ordered for curb side pick up. First let's do inside the restaurant. They are always packed on Friday nights so make sure you're okay waiting up to an hour. I've placed ordered for curb side pick up, but really there's no such thing. They say it's curb side but they never actually go to your car, they make you come inside because they never answer the phone in that booth. Food is overall okay. I love getting the fried mac and cheese balls. My go to fish is the Louisiana pasta chicken. Calamari is so so but I'm picky. I normally share the dinner portion with someone because it's pretty big."
Mike N.,"San Jose, CA",28,22,5,3.0,3/10/2010,"Ladies and Gentlemen,  Somehow my friends and I (6 of us) ended up here and spent over $100 (no drinks) off their happy hour menu. We had a voucher for a free slice of cheesecake for every $30 spent. We became legends... We ordered everything off their happy hour menu (x2 or sometimes x3 off things we liked). We had to combine two tables and still couldn't fit all the food. The waiter was amazed and never seen anything like this.  We enjoyed their sliders, cuban sandwiches, macaroni balls, thai lettuce wraps, cobb salad and of course gobbs of free bread. Sliders - small, kinda shiny (greasy) but easy, fun to eat. Be sure to get the side order of fries for a buck. Cuban Sandwiches - toasty, pork and ham go well together, with the swiss cheese melting off the side. YUM! Fried Mac and Cheese - very interesting since it doesn't taste like the box mac and cheese. It doesn't have the overly cheese taste which makes it good. Marinara sauce compliments the FM&C. Thai Lettuce Wraps - chicken with lettuce and a few veggies with sauce. Very tasty when using peanut sauce. Def. not as good as the Asian places but it does its job. Cobb Salad - typical salad but good to order to accompany all the heavier foods Everything else (off their happy hour menu) we could pass on.  Now for the 3 Cheesecake, we got plain, red velvet, and Oreo. Plain is the lightest and taste like ehhhh. Oreo was my favorite since who doesn't like oreos with cheesecake. Red Velvet was humongous. People in my party liked it but man I think its over 1500 calories. Overall food is decent. I'm glad I went to the gym before eating all this food."
Trisha V.,"San Jose, CA",372,76,1,4.0,1/19/2011,"I'm usually open to trying new things when I go to restaurants with hundreds of items on the menu. However, this is one of the few places where I find myself ordering the same three items over and over again. 1. Seared Ahi Tuna Wasabi Salad 2. The chicken and Panceta over Pasta with arugula (I dont remember the name)  3. Pasta Divinci These are hands down probably my favorite 3 items on the menu. I'm sure there are other great dishes. But I just cant seem to order anything else.  For dessert, I never order cheesecake. Dont ask me why, but I always order the strawberry shortcake. They have the best strawberry shortcake that I have tried so far. Other than that.. the staff and ambiance have always been pretty good, and the complimentary bread is always a plus!"
Jesseca T.,"Los Alamos, NM",129,478,72,1.0,1/5/2008,"I'm veg, try to eat healthy, and have no interest in sweets...so maybe, like McDonalds, it's just NOT the place for me.  I know this is not a popular opinion to have and I've gone back a few times to try to change my opinion, but I can't. Every time my coworkers get excited about a special lunch out and actually propose this overpriced CHAIN, I feel like gagging. Am I the only person that thinks a phone book/menu is excessive and unnecessary?  It is very difficult to have a vegetarian, non-fried appetizer and lunch course here that doesn't consist of some nutritionally poor substitute like iceberg lettuce with ranch dressing, or my favorite : ""grilled veggies"" (read: squash and zucchini).  Also, the inflated prices and service were an insult- last time our waitress treated us like we were an inconvenience. I can easily think of ten other places to spend $25 on lunch. To me, this place is indicative of how we have allowed ourselves to believe the marketers, instead of listening to our tastebuds."
Aman K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,33,,3.0,8/9/2013,Love the menu. Great place to go in a big group with a reservation other wise the wait is forever. Sometimes could take over an hour just to get a table.
Carrie A.,"Newark, CA",357,325,325,3.0,2/3/2010,"I'm trying my best to not be passive aggressive here -- OK, Tuesday night, 7:00 PM, we go in and there's a 10 minute wait. OK, I keep doing this reality check, or am I the ONLY one suffering from the economy. Why is this place busy?  So we are seated in 10 minutes as promised. The staff was nice, attentive, did the ""I'll be right back to let you know our specials & get you drinks."" I like that -- acknowledgment goes a long way with me. So we order water, an Arnold Palmer, a Well Behaved Dirty martini (yummy) and for food we get the Santa Fe Salad and the Navajo Sandwich. The food was edible, nothing to jump up and down about, but edible. The bread on my Navajo sandwich was nice and warm, it made me think how nice it would be if I could just eat the bread. The drinks and food came promptly and was nice. I keep wanting to like the Cheesecake Factory, but it seems like I spend most of my time reading advertisements in the MENU, and when I see something I like and want to talk about what I ordered -- I feel like I'm playing Battleship! to explain where this food item is on the menu ... ""Oh, so go to page 18 ... row 36 ... section 4 on the menu so you can see what I'm getting."" And what is with the ADVERTISEMENTS? I feel like I'm at some odd restaurant version of an amusement park. The Coca-Cola in the beverage section isn't enough? You mean you have to try to pimp it for me on what Coca-Cola couples with? People ... it's not a rare 40 yr old vintage bottle of wine that I know nothing about -- it's the stuff we've been drinking all of our lives! OK, OK, I'm crawling off of my soap-box. Maybe I just don't get it, maybe if I need a LOT of food, this is where to visit. Maybe if I was 21 and trying to grow out of Chili's, this might be the spot. It would've received 2 stars, but the staff was nice -- so they gained one."
Christine T.,"San Jose, CA",656,197,89,2.0,12/16/2009,"Friday night, dinner out with friends.. This place really isn't worth it. Out of alll the Cheesecake factories, this one just quite doesn't seem to have that same spark the others have. Those quirky servers, that appropriate atmosphere, and the food that was not room temperature. This Cheesecake does not satisfy my needs!"
Ricky E.,"Los Gatos, CA",208,33,,1.0,12/16/2011,"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!!!!!!           Either my previous bad yelp review came to bite me in the ass, or service here just  SUCKS whatsoever! Our server is lucky I forgot her name, otherwise I would have reported her to the manager on how forgetful and inattentive she was. When we sat down, I immediately noticed our table was bare. No salt/pepper shakers, no napkins or silverware. uhhh, bussers? hello? To start off, we ordered our drinks. I had ordered a regular Mojito, and my girlfriend ordered a strawberry margarita (not-blended) and two glasses of water. #1. She came back to our table because for some reason the bartender couldn't make my gf's margarita non-blended. Umm okay? So instead the gf ordered a red sangria. THEN she returned to our table and said that they only had white sangria. Okay. About 5 minutes had passed, and still no drinks, no water, NO SILVERWARE OR NAPKINS! Our server finally dropped off our drinks, and still hadn't brought us our waters. #2. So we proceeded to order our food. My gf had asked for a modification on her BLT Salad (no bleu cheese, sub cheddar). I watched our server mumble ""no bleu cheese, sub cheddar"" as she was writing it down. After taking our order, I asked if I could keep a menu with me just in case I wanted to order something more since we were only ordering off the small bites menu. She said okay, and quickly collected ALL the menus and walked away before I could even comprehend what was going on and stop her from taking my menu away. Oh well, whatever.   As we were waiting for our food, our server came and told us that the bread was baking and would be out with a fresh batch in a few minutes. A different server then came out with a few baskets of bread and was dropping them off to other tables around us that had already gotten bread so they declined, but how would our table get missed? Food finally came out, and guess what? BLEU CHEESE ON THE SALAD!! AND NO NAPKINS OR SILVERWARE YET! There was a moment where there were two servers at our table, (one dropping off food, and another finally bringing us our silverware). I sent the salad back instantly. And I also noticed that the server who was dropping off our silverware was placing them directly on the table, without any napkins or anything. Umm excuse me, but I don't know if the table is clean/sanitized or not. After being asked ""can I get you anything else?"" I replied, ""Yeah, we still have no napkins, we didn't get our bread, or our waters.""  I was about to ask our server if she needed a new pair of glasses because of her lack of attention to our table. So our waters finally came, after the food! and bread on our table halfway through our meal. We ate quickly because I was really upset with the lack of attentiveness and the incompetence of the floor staff. IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY!  #3 When I had asked for the check, she gave us the tab for the table to left left of us, I corrected her, and she then gave us the tab to the table to the right of us. WAKE UP B*TCH!!! We finally got our correct bill, paid, and left. And for that horrible experience, I left a 72 cent tip, and walked out quickly.  Cheesecake Factory, you guys really need to train your staff better or at least make sure they truly pay attention to not only the guests needs, but the table as a whole."
Kristen H.,"Kalamazoo, MI",42,146,1,3.0,12/28/2010,"This used to be my favorite restaurant. I loved their chips and guacamole, their Navajo sandwich, and most of all, their Cobb salad. I feel it's taken a downward turn, though. I've been there a number of times recently, and each time, the service was less than spectacular. My food was very disappointing last time, as well (tempura fish tacos, including overdone rice).  Their food is usually pretty good; I hope they pick up the level of their service soon."
Trish S.,"San Jose, CA",31,377,192,4.0,12/8/2012,"They are pretty accurate with wait time.  The hostess told us 35 minutes.  We went shopping and walking around and came back 30 minutes later.  Within 5 minutes, our table was ready!  The kids love the food here."
Jamaila T.,"Atherton, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/1/2013,Terrible curbside pick up. Missed items twice. Kept us on hold for 45 min when we called back.
Tiffany P.,"Fremont, CA",26,92,12,4.0,11/25/2012,"Can't come here and not get cheesecake!!  Came here since I havent been here in a while. We were seated right away at around 8pm on a Sunday. Our orders were on point and nothing to complain about. Of course I was only looking forward to the dessert and we got red velvet cheesecake to-go. We were too full from the actual dinner to have the cheesecake there. When we got home, the cheesecake was delectable, just like if we were to eat it right there! Can't wait to come back!"
Amy D.,"San Francisco, CA",148,54,6,4.0,11/19/2012,"I like this cheesecake factory better than some of the other ones in the bay. It is always busy (but when are they not) but they move fast and even on a friday night i feel like the wait moves quickly!  The servers at this cheesecake factory are always really nice and fast, they also always have great suggestions when i ask about the menu... it seems like they are all very knowledgable about what is on the menu! i like that because i tend to be a picky eater!"
Derek S.,"San Jose, CA",4629,2041,7554,3.0,11/12/2007,"My buddy suggested this place for lunch today. Wait for our party of 2 was immediate for a sun filled patio, or 10-15 minutes for the dining hall. Ambiance is pretty nice and staff is friendly. After being seated, our waiter promptly served us. I opted for the lunch Fish and Chips meal. Three pieces of fish, fries, and coleslaw. Fish was fresh, a little soggy due to um...dunno. Fries were bleh...fries..a little too salty. Coleslaw was too creamy... I'm a firm believer of ""You are what you eat""...look around the dining hall... My buddy and I opted out of the Cheesecake...too rich and fattening for us. Kind of pricey for lunch at $10.95 per dish per person. Total after tax and tips $28...."
Rita V.,"San Jose, CA",56,731,781,4.0,9/18/2008,"This Cheesecake is located in a line of great restaurants at Oakridge mall.  I decided to come here for dinner.  We got seated immediately, since we beat the dinner rush. I always have trouble deciding what to order, since there is a wide selection of dishes.  One dish caught my eye when I was browsing over the sandwiches.  I decided to order the 'chicken parm sandwich' with no cheese. The dish came out in 10 minutes.  The chicken was breaded and crispy.  The sauce was super garlicy, but I loved it!  The bread was cripsy, too.  The sandwich came with a mountain of fries, which tasted great. I think the chicken parm sandwich is now my favorite dish at Cheesecake Factory!"
Angelica P.,"Fremont, CA",407,166,396,3.0,10/20/2010,"Came here at least 3 times. This is a good place to go if it's late and you just want something small and healthy. Not a place to go if you want some really good food. - Salads are huge, pre-mixed, and everything is cut really small. -Tuna tartar was surprisingly good. I was skeptical because it's not a sushi or seafood restaurant.  - Fish tacos (comes with 4) are a safe order but nothing spectacular - Didn't like their wasabi ahi tuna  - Pastas are ok Service varies every time I come here. I usually sit at a high top table by the bar though. Last time I came here, the waitress kept forgetting our requests and we had to ask her twice. One thing they really need to fix is the stench by the entrance! I don't know why but I almost want to vomit every time I walk from the parking lot to the entrance. Maybe there's bad sewage or something."
H T.,"San Ramon, CA",5,103,7,5.0,12/9/2012,"Best rib eye steak ever!  Cooked EXACTLY how I like it (true medium rare). Great friendly and attentive service.  Always a ""win"" at the Cheesecake Factory."
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,4.0,7/27/2010,"Giant portions, good service, huge menu of tasty stuff, and great cheesecake! Where can you go wrong. Just be aware that the portions are insane, so when you see a $15 dish just know that you could be eating it for the next day as well so it's not too pricey all considered. I love the dark atmosphere and mixed decor at these places, it's nice. They also have an outdoor seating area for warm nights. Oh and you don't really have to go into the scary mall in order to eat here, it's on the side. I also went late (they are open till 11pm) so no screaming children could be found, yay!"
Janet C.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,,4.0,10/24/2014,"Nice staff, great menu variety.  Good that you can see the chef's cooking.  Sometimes you have to wait but seating is very comfortable and servers are capable."
