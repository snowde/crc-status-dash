A P.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/21/2014,"I don't even like cheesecake but I love this place. I've only been to this location a handful of times but each time I go I leave stuffed and everything's been delicious. Me & my sisters order off the appetizer menu for the most part & I can definitely get full off these alone. Avocado Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, Stuffed Mushrooms, Endive Salad. Last time I think I ordered the Garlic Noodles and I had them put veggies in for me. Soo delicious. Sometimes you have to wait a while to be seated, but it's definitely worth it for me. I will go back any chance I get."
Fanny S.,"Evergreen, San Jose, CA",0,6,1,4.0,9/13/2014,"The wait here always takes a while but it's worth it. They have amazing/strong cocktails! Im never disappointed with their long island iced tea. Their salads are also amazing! The best thing to order here are their burgers. Make sure what ever burger you get ask for Kobe beef, its delicious.  I like my beef medium rare and many places cant cook it perfectly like at cheesecake, they always get it right the only downside is that our servers havent always been good"
Taylor S.,"Little Elm, TX",98,203,,2.0,12/21/2012,"This review is for the Sunday brunch only. I really like the dinner/lunch/dessert menu, but this was the absolute WORST breakfast I've had in ages. I ordered an omelet and the egg was this weird yellow spongy thing. I don't even know if it was real egg or some canned egg substitute. It was greasy as hell, too. The hashbrowns were also drenched in oil (but otherwise good). There was literally a puddle of vegetable oil on my plate from them, The worst part was the bagel. It was tough as leather. I literally could not bite a piece off.  I think they actually gave me a stale bagel and just toasted it and hoped I didn't notice it was stale.  I noticed."
Richard K.,"Monterey, CA",0,34,,2.0,10/13/2014,"I had the everything pizzza, it was everything it shouldn't be--the worst pizza I have ever ate.  The Godiva Chocolate Cheese Cake was the only savings grace. Service was sloppy and indifferent, The menu is a sloppy mess--how can you except a kitchen to freshly prepare all these items well--you can't so they are microwazed.  I can't really think of a reason to go there except for cheesecake to go."
Kristin R.,"San Jose, CA",15,24,19,4.0,11/10/2010,"Just go straight for the cheesecake.  The regular food I've tried has been good, but nothing spectacular.  Everyone I go with can always find something that they'll eat and it's always good, but there's always another place that does it better.  That is except for the cheesecake.  If you're going here, you have to have some.  My favorite is their red velvet cheesecake.  All the others are good too, and everyone I know who's had a slice has loved it. The place is really easy to find especially if you've ever walked around Oakridge before.  There's one exit inside and one on the outside.  If you plan on going here for dinner, and plan on parking in the front, the parking is terrible.  I always park in the back (usually around Target) and walk because I'd rather walk that wait and try to find a spot. If you plan on going with a group, they put it all on one bill, but you can request a separate tab.  Also they're really quiet on week day nights and can easier accommodate everyone quickly.  We had a group of twelve on a Tuesday night and got seated pretty quick. All in all I've always had good service, decent food, and amazing cheesecake.  Happy eating everyone!"
Nilsa M.,"San Jose, CA",33,36,11,2.0,3/3/2013,"We ordered some food to-go today. This was my first time eating at there and I was not too impressed. We ordered the Corn Fritters, Vietnamese Tacos, Margherita Flat Bread, Fried Mac and Cheese and a burger. The fried Mac and cheese and the burger came out fine. They gave us Fettucine Alfredo instead of the flat bread and my corn fritters were still raw dough in the center. The Vietnamese tacos were ok. The pork was very dry and tough. If I ever go back, I hope the food will be better."
Tanya B.,"Chesterland, OH",103,200,,4.0,10/3/2010,"I always liked cheesecake factory; not for their full menu so much, but for relaxing cup of tea with a piece of cake.  This place is real nice, and has a lovely bar sitting area with an extremely  nice bartender.  Nice way to spend the evening with good company."
sam l.,"Cupertino, CA",82,66,2,4.0,11/3/2010,"Good place to meet up with friends. Yummy food- although they no longer serve my two all time favs- chino latino steak and chinolatino chicken!! what gives?? Usually good service, prompt, courteous etc. Its open late and has something for everyone!"
Jessica M.,"San Jose, CA",47,63,1,4.0,2/26/2013,"I'm one of the few who people who do not come for the cheesecake. I think cheesecake in general is gross haha.  The food is pretty hit or miss, theres SO MUCH to choose from, I think if they scaled back the menu the quality would improve.  The service is usually pretty good. It gets crazy on date nights so I try to avoid that. Their alcoholic milkshakes are good (i've tried just one) and it was sizeable but you cant taste the alcohol nor feel the effects and for $11 it was not worth it. Would def return though."
Kenny C.,"San Jose, CA",51,66,5,2.0,7/12/2012,"i dont know why but  the building quality itself seems more better then the taste quality of the food you order. "" the strawberries taste like plastic!"" the waiters are nice, i dislike the white  mental institution outfits.. but if your going to eat here, your better off just buying a slice of pie."
InFuzion Z.,"San Jose, CA",1,56,11,4.0,10/30/2009,"So far, so good. If you are not in a rush, like going back to work. So overall I give them a 4 star for attentiveness. Clean atmosphere, cozy. Pretty good choices to pick from pasta dishes as well as desserts."
Eve C.,"Manhattan, NY",293,845,439,3.0,8/4/2010,"When you come to Cheesecake Factory, you are not going to get food that is uber duper creative.  Don't get me wrong the food is pretty good for it being a chain and the prices aren't outrageous but definitely not the cheapest. The food will be be standard with some kinds of twist. Apparently, tonight I twisted my order a little too much. I wanted a cream sauce to be made with tomato sauce as well and that warranted the attention of the manager. Minus that event, the dinner was satisfactory."
Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",304,1561,73,3.0,7/31/2008,"OK so 7/30/08, Wednesday, was $1.50 cheesecake slices at all locations.  So on most occasions, in a nutshell, the menu is huge, the food is huge, the service is usually very attentive based on the crowdedness, and the wait for a table is usually bad on weekends, and the price is about $20 per person on average for a meal.  This review is for 7/30/08 and the chaos that occurred at this location. Heading there, I knew I was heading into an atmosphere where the wait time will be long for a table.  So my friend Viv and I grabbed a pager, reserved our table for 2, went next door to CPK, ate a meal there, and then came back to Cheesecake and surprisingly, our pager never went off...we went from 30th on the list to 5th in about 40 minutes...we were seated quickly and we sat down to our $1.50 slices after waiting about 35 minutes after placing our order with our waiter.  When the cheesecake did come to our table, I could tell it came out of their freezer recently because the cheesecake was hard, really rock hard...still edible but not soft.  The people that handle the cheesecake servings were in the shit...orders piling up and no end in sight.  I felt bad for those guys...they certainly earned their dollars on that night. The policy and rule for the $1.50 slices were dine-in only...yet I saw some people were able to not only order one slice per person to take-out, but also in some cases, order multiple slices to take-out!  Their policy wasn't enforced very strictly and amidst all the pandemonium from that day, I can certainly understand.  Will this experience affect if I'll go back?  Probably not...but I definitely won't be going on a cheap cheesecake promotion night again...if I want frozen dessert, I'd rather get froyo."
Guy V.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/9/2013,Waited 45 minutes with my party of 7. Waitress complimented my daughter's order of Bistro Shrimp Pasta but never brought it. We had to wait another 15 min. to get her order. My Gumbo was swimming in oil. And $120 bill. Not coming back.
Tammy L.,"San Mateo, CA",51,85,19,2.0,9/15/2010,"I've had great experiences at the Palo Alto location in the past... I decided to try this location out since it was more convenient last night...  We got there around 730p or so and waited for a table, no problem.  They called us up, tried to seat us 3 times (3s a charm?) either the table wasn't available or still needed to be bused.  (communication problems?) Oh well, least of my worries... the wait wasn't horrible, just a lot of running around. Since it's been awhile since I've actually eaten at any cheesecake factory, i'd forgotten how many choices there are! this is good and bad, i can be indecisive. (props for huge portions, but do continue reading) I decided to be ""healthy"" and pick the mahi mahi Mediterranean.  while it tasted pretty good, i was too tired and hungry to really question if my fish was cooked all the way.  he ordered a steak of some sort. but  the drawbacks: slightly cooked past well done and 2 bites of meat. it would've been nice if they'd mentioned the size of meat they were going to serve.   anyway, not too long after getting in the car to go home (we live 5 min down the road) i felt feverish and the tummy was angry!  I'd only eaten half of my meal and boxed the other half in hopes to snack on it later.  Epic FAIL.  if i'd gotten sick from eating the first half, why endure getting sick again with the 2nd? so much for their pride in fresh fish... do keep in mind, i have no problem stomaching my raw sushi. Perhaps this was just a bad night to go. regardless, bad first impression and i most likely wont come back to this location."
Kerri Q.,"San Jose, CA",124,15,,5.0,1/26/2012,"I had lunch here with my mom for my birthday.  It was busy and we were going to see a movie, so we sat in the bar to eat as that allowed us to be seated right away.  I'm so glad we did!  Our server was Jonathan M and he was wonderful!  It was so busy, but he was on it!  He answered all of my questions with a smile on his face.  His personality was sparkling!  The food was great and the service was fabulous!  If I could get him as our server again, I'd gladly sit in the bar!  Thanks Jonathan for a fabulous birthday lunch!"
Yolanda R.,"San Jose, CA",5,11,,5.0,10/24/2013,"My husband and I have been coming here for about 8-9 years now! We come here at least once per week and have nothing to complain about. We love the food and the service. I have to point out though that we enjoy the service more in the bar section, it feels a little more personable, over in the other areas service is very nice too, but we've always felt that the servers and bartenders at the bar section are most attentive. of course we've been coming here for a while now, but all the familiar faces always greet us and make us feel super welcomed as if it was our first time being there. The managers always say hi too, which is a really nice acknowledgement. For the most part in any business you hardly ever see the managers because they are always hiding in their offices waiting to be called out only when a problem arises, but not here i always catch a manager or two walking the floor greeting and making sure every thing is right. I've never experienced bad customer service here from any of the waiters or waitresses. Besides the great customer service, the food is amazing! I'll anything from the menu. The atmosphere is smooth, elegant, proper, and I love that there's Valet parking right outside! I've been to the Cheesecake factory located at Valley Fair, and only been there about three times because the third time was the last trial to give them a chance. Service is not the same at all."
Jenn E.,"Santa Cruz, CA",47,100,44,4.0,12/22/2013,"This is a great place for a nice but casual dinner or lunch. The food is soooo good and the prices are decent for the quality and amount of food you get. My favorite is the hibachi steak with mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. My go to favorite every time that never disappoints! The fried Mac and cheese appetizer is delicious and can be a meal in itself. This is my boyfriend'a favorite date night place in San Jose. Although the wait for a table can be quite long, especially on the weekends because they also don't do reservations (thus the minus one star) the service we got was good. The restroom smelled like fruit loops but the floor was a bit slippery. With a huge slice of amazing evil cheesecake (caramel Dutch apple streusel and peanut butter cup fudge) to go, left overs, and a very satisfied belly, this was a successful date night restaurant and conveniently located next to the movie theaters."
Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,982,176,1.0,8/25/2010,Wow. Second time was even  more sucktastic than the first time. Server was friendly but mostly absent. Husband's Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was defined as 99% chicken and 1% shrimp. One piece of shrimp. One piece. Ugh. Pathetic. I got the huge portion of chicken caesar salad and I think I had about 2 oz (if I was lucky) of chicken on my plate. Hubby gave me some chicken off his dish. Our friend got some pasta dish...but I can't remember the name. Dessert was the only thing that made me happy - the lemoncello cream torte was wonderful. Cheesecake Factory has really killed any kind of love we had for it.
Eric R.,"Seattle, WA",37,24,,4.0,9/23/2010,"I ordinarily consider myself above going to corporate chain restaurants when I have a choice in the matter, and I only found myself at the Cheesecake Factory last night because they were open later than their neighbors. I ordered the petite filet (mignon), and imagine my pleasant surprise to discover that it was every bit as good as any steak I've ever had, anywhere.  It was an outstanding steak, perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned, needing no salt, butter, sauce, or the like.  The horseradish I had requested sat mostly untouched, the steak was so good by itself. The service was as friendly and attentive as one would expect, but the steak was well above and beyond.  Strange as it feels to say this, I'll be back."
