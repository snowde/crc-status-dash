Catherine C.,"Fremont, CA",255,106,25,4.0,8/18/2010,"Came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my best friend getting new jobs! It was my first time coming to this Cheesecake Factory since I'm so used to the one next to Valley Fair. We came to this location since I was near the area. We came for a late dinner and it was pretty crowded. The lighting seemed darker than usual, but it didn't bother me that much since I was with good company. :)  I had ordered my usual Pasta Da Vinci. I love it! One of my friends ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and my other two friends shared a Thai noodle dish. They both tasted pretty good! The service was good and too bad we were too stuffed to eat cheesecake because what's the point of going to the Cheesecake factory if you're not going to eat cheesecake?"
Janis M.,"Campbell, CA",166,122,154,2.0,7/8/2012,"It's not BAD... It's just not GOOD. Other than ordering an actual cheese cake, I wouldn't expect much. If you are after the crowd and the ambiance, then this is not a bad place to go...if you are expecting GREAT food, you might be disappointed."
Badri N.,"San Jose, CA",602,324,137,3.0,7/17/2009,"Went here on Thursday night with fellow Yelper Noelle W. after watching a movie at the mall. Location is easily accessible from the 85 and 87 freeways but parking, oh my, is parking a nightmare or what!!!!  My advice - don't even try to find surface parking in front of all the restaurant chains if it's after 6 PM - you will waste fuel and endanger the planet!  Head on into the parking garage, up to level 2 or above and you will usually find parking quite readily.  And you don't have to walk in the sun/rain/wind - or other natural element!  FTW! ~ 2 stars for location (- 2 stars for parking situation!!!) Decor is your typical cheesecake factory - faux Italian marble everywhere, very elegant looking, with high ceilings, very wide open spaces and airy, comfortable atmosphere.  Tables are packed but not too closely together so it is possible to have a conversation.  It's not too dark and it's conducive for a lot of different occasions - from business meetings to family outings to quiet dinners. ~ 4 stars for ambiance and decor We were seated promptly and the waiter (Christian) was almost immediately there to explain specials and take our drink orders.  He was also training a rookie waitress who was very polite and professional throughout the meal though she did forget a couple of things and had to go back and fetch them.  But that's how you learn, so no points subtracted for that - everyone's gotta learn and she certainly had the right attitude about it!  Our food arrived promptly (except for the cheesecake which took a really long time!!!), drinks were kept filled and takeout containers brought out promptly on request! ~ 4 stars for service Now, the food.  I never have high expectations when eating at these mega chain restaurants.  Especially ones that have menus that are reminiscent of phone books.  It was amusing to read the little supplement that listed the caloric values of all the menu items.  I didn't see one single item there that was less than 1000 calories and quite a few that were over 2500 calories!!!  Aiyiyi - Good Lord have mercy!!!!   I ordered the Baja chicken tacos which were quite good but nothing like the neighborhood taqueria.  Chicken was quite flavorless but the seasoning was good, especially the generous amount of cilantro!!  The black beans were OK but the rice was kind of a cool mixture between normal brown rice and a Chinese inspired fried rice with peas and scallions - I enjoyed the rice and I'm normally not a big rice eater! Noelle got a burger protein style and it came wrapped nicely in aluminum foil (I was surprised but it was a cool way to keep it warm!!).  Also, they had followed her special instructions quite well and she seemed to enjoy it.   ""I normally don't eat dessert.""  This is what I said when the waiter brought around the dessert menu.  But I proceeded to completely demolish the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which was good but a tad too rich - I've always enjoyed the plain New York style cheesecake and should stick to that - no creative flavors for me - I'm a simple guy with simple tastes!!!  It was smothered in way too much whipped cream - I had to push the cream out of the way and ended up eating much much more dessert than I would normally eat in a month!  Bleh...  major food coma looked certain in my future - thank goodness I had a short drive home where I could be at least be comfortable if I ended up getting sick - thankfully, I didn't! Total check for 1 beer, 1 iced tea, two entrees and two cheesecakes = $47 ($57 with tip) - not too shabby! ~ 3 stars for food - it met expectations (which were not too high, being a chain restaurant) ~ 3 stars overall for Cheesecake Factory.  Fun place, decent food, really good prices and value, great service and a nice ambiance.   # 112"
Jennifer S.,"San Jose, CA",34,56,21,4.0,10/17/2012,Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory? The food is always great here but the service is sometimes slow. It really depends on your server. Recently we sat in the bar area and our server Jake? was really awesome. Super friendly and upbeat. He helped me pick out drinks...I was being indecisive (like usual). We were so stuffed after dinner that we didn't get dessert but from previous experience the tiramisu is the bomb!
Andrea T.,"Omaha, NE",180,405,19,3.0,6/12/2010,"It's good as far as chain restaurants go. But then I read a little book called ""Eat This, Not That"". The book is a real eye-opener on the calories we consume.  I'll always enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but I'll have to schedule a 5-10 mile run after eating anything on the menu."
Carrie S.,"San Jose, CA",123,35,,5.0,9/10/2011,"One of my favorite places to eat. I love the red velvet cheesecake. Waiting for a table can be forever, but once you sit down and have that chicken alfredo or pizza or anything your mouth desires, you would be glad you waited. Service is excellent. Parking however  sucks."
Andy V.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,2.0,9/2/2014,I felt that every thing that I ordered here was a little too dry( Factory Burrito) and the chicken strips was way too dry and tasteless. The burgers were good but I kind of expected more in the burrito and chicken strips so I was vastly disappointed and the cheesecake are a most have when you come here.
Sam S.,"San Jose, CA",325,145,55,5.0,11/7/2011,"Who does not love Cheesecake Factory, everything on the menu is great. Service is Great and portions are huge!"
Jackie C.,"San Jose, CA",10,19,1,5.0,12/14/2011,"It's not a hambuger joint, but they have the best burgers in the Bay. It's really great to see that in this economy when eveyone else is skimping on portions and quality, the Cheesecake Factory is as good as ever.  Service is prompt and friendly and the decor is great."
Jessica S.,"San Jose, CA",40,7,,5.0,12/13/2013,Just had dinner here and the food and service was amazing.  The service was very prompt and the food was hot.  Loved it.  Dulce de leche cheesecake was super yum!
Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",491,371,1907,3.0,4/21/2007,"Menus at The Cheesecake Factory have one side covered with a company's advertisement and the other with an actual list of dishes, something I've definitely never seen before. The process of choosing a dish can take a while since there are many sections to look through: Appetizers, Pizza, Specialties, Lunch Specials, Pastas, Fish & Seafood, Steaks and Chops, Salads, Sandwiches, Eggs & Omelettes, Sunday Brunch, Desserts, Cheesecakes, From Our Bar, and Beverages. Luckily for me, I happened to get there before 5 P.M., and could still order from their Lunch Specials. I opted for their Four Cheese Pasta (mozzarella, romano, parmesan, and ricotta with marinara sauce and fresh basil). It didn't take too long for my food to arrive, but when it did, I was a shocked by the portion size. In the Lunch Specials menu there was a small line saying that that section provided menu favorites in smaller portions. Now if what I saw in front of me was supposed to be 'smaller'... then I certainly did not want to see what the full sized portion looked like. If one healthy portion is said to be the size of your palm, the Four Cheese Pasta was easily four or five portions.  At first glance, the Four Cheese Pasta didn't look that spectacular. But once I dipped my fork in, I realized that the four cheeses were hidden under a layer of the penne rigate style noodles they used. The blend of cheeses with potent fresh basil and chunky tomatoes in the marinara sauce made for a definite A+ rating. Now here is where I get to talk about the crowning part of our experience at The Cheesecake Factory, the desserts!  I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake (layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse ),  The desserts arrived a few minutes later.  I'm a complete 'chocoholic' and thus fell completely in love with that dessert. The smooth, creamy texture of the cheesecake combined with the richness of Godiva chocolate made for a winning combination!  With one of the Lunch Specials, a dessert, and tip, you should expect to pay around $20. Overall, I found that The Cheesecake Factory has pretty good food, but their specialty is definitely in their delicious cheesecakes."
James A.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,49,53,4.0,9/27/2012,Cakecheese. Get that sh!T! Its good. Trust me. Food is average. But hey! just eat it to know you are really here for the cheesecake. Or even just forget the entree and get 5 slices of different cheesecakes. Eat each slice and then you will really love this place. Once more I have never really had any serious cheesecake so I am most likely a noob at cheesecake eating. But if I had to put my money on a damn good cheesecake I would have to put it down here. And if you don't like cheesecake but somehow you are reading this review I advise you to press the red X on the top right corner. Yes there are 4 stars. 1 for entree. 3 for cheesecake. You don't want to come here for just the entree. You will leave disappointed and eat a whole gallon of icecream later at home. Trust me.
Nina A.,"San Jose, CA",73,32,5,4.0,10/8/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants! I have yet to try a single dish here that I don't like. The food is always fresh and delicious! The service is almost always on point as well. My favorite dishes include the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, Crispy Chicken Costoletta, and the Pasta Da Vinci. The Mac and Cheese balls are amazing as well. The Georgia Peach is my favorite drink. The decor is beautiful as well and the ambiance is great. I highly recommend it!"
Thy N.,"San Jose, CA",48,11,,3.0,5/13/2014,Not satisfied as the first time I came here. The food was too sweet!
Michelle C.,"San Jose, CA",7,28,1,2.0,10/19/2010,"Went to dinner last night - had Thai Chicken Pasta. It was huge - I wish they had a 1/2 portion option. When I go here I want to save room for cheesecake. I was so excited to have pumpkin cheesecake which is seasonal. We had a party of 5 and we all got different pieces of cheesecake. Mine was frozen. I told the waitress and she said that I could bring it home and after 30 minutes it would be good. Well, that's great - but I really wanted to eat it there. I was still charged for it. No - I didn't talk to the manager or even ask for a refund - but I really should have had edible cheesecake. I don't think I'll be going back too soon. Way too much money for OK service and frozen cheesecake."
Tiffany Michelle L.,"Fremont, CA",298,243,471,4.0,12/3/2011,"One of my favorite places. Pretty much all of the food tastes great! Some of the breakfast food was just ok. I like the menu selection. You don't really have to choose a specific food restaurant - you can just go to Cheesecake Factory where they have different foods in a booklet. Also, their Cheesecake is delicious, I have tried almost every one (I tried one piece each visit.) The floor layout in this one is particularly nice. All of them have the high ceilings, marble floors, beautifully painted walls, etc."
Nissa Z.,"San Francisco, CA",164,132,33,3.0,5/17/2010,"Let me start off that I would give them more stars...IF the initial service was better.  We got there and were told it would be a 30 minute wait, received our buzzer and proceeded to the packed bar.  After a few drinks and over 30 minutes later I began to wonder if our buzzer was broken so my Fiance' headed over to check, they said 10 more minutes.   20 minutes of listening to them call out other parties names and watching 3 couples that arrived after us get seated and one eye on our buzzer we headed back over to see what was going on.  They said they tried calling us but we didn't answer...huh?? funny cause we were standing right there WELL within earshot.  Anywho, the little chick at the front needed an attitude adjustment.   The manager seated us apologized and gave us two appetizers of our choice at no charge.  Which was very nice of them, they could have only offered us one.   The food was good, Crab Cakes, Avocado Eggrolls with a Tamarind Dipping Sauce, Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp and a Cuban Sandwich.   For dessert we opted for the Mango, Key Lime Coconut Cheese Cake.  That crust was to die for!  Oh and our wait staff was awesome as well."
Vicky M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,16,,4.0,11/29/2012,Started going to the Cheesecake factory in Blossom Hill about a year ago. Been there over 20 times. Started out well but a couple of months ago it started that there has always been another issue.  Waiters are sometimes way too excited and over-friendly. Not natural at all.  Then they were 2 times waiting on the bread delivery. Once we never got it and the second time it took 15 min until served. No cutlery though.  Favorite dish Steak Diane is unbeatable. Just delicious!  Also Salmon a few times but for some reason it started getting kind of dry.
Angel G.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,1.0,7/19/2011,"This was seriously the worst place I have ever been to! The service was mediocre, and the food was overpriced for such low quality. I would NEVER recommend taking ANYONE to this place for a date. I was charged $35.00 for 2 drinks(extremely water down) and 2 cheesecakes(tasted like burnt cream) because they thought it would be fine to add a 15% gratuity charge to our bill. We went with 8 people, but we split the tab. Save your money and go somewhere else."
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,6/25/2006,"I've only been to this location twice and it seems like the wait wasn't as bad as the other ones in the bay area. I grew up with the ones in L.A. so I'll always be partial to those. We had a really good waiter sitting at the bar so an extra star for his affable personality and great service. Of course the menu, huge portions, and quality is standard Cheesecake Factory across the board. So when I'm missing a bit of my SoCal youth I head out here from some nostalgia."
