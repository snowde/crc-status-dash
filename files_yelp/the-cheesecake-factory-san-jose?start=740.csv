Trang T.,"San Jose, CA",266,52,160,5.0,4/25/2012,"my family and I come here on special days like birthdays, graduations, or mother's day and every time i come here I'm please with my meal! i'm a big fan of pasta so i like to try out the different pasta plates on the menu. i love how they have the bread with butter out on the tables as an appetizer. it is a bit on the pricy side but it is yuuummyyy! i usually don't finish the whole plate when i come so I eat it the next day.  the customer service has been pretty good everytime that I've come, they are always nice and smiley!

Geraldine S.,"Union City, CA",131,35,8,3.0,5/22/2012,"When you stand outside the front door, IT STINKS!  The manager said there is nothing they can do about it because there is a sewer line right there.  Gross!  The service is good.  The two people who got me my low carb cheesecake were nice and helpful."
Franklin L.,"San Jose, CA",0,37,16,2.0,7/15/2011,"Despite The Cheesecake Factory generally being an overpriced pre-packaged gluttonous obscenity that offends both body and spirit, I will be back to the one at Oakridge Mall because they offer consistent service, edible food, a full bar and air conditioning and - in the end - sometimes that's all one needs in a restaurant."
Charles S.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,4.0,1/15/2013,"Great food, awesome service, but make sure that the guy that leaves the stall before you doesn't leave piss on the seat. It has a way of ruining your night out."
Phoenix D.,"Rock Springs, WY",132,172,77,4.0,11/4/2009,"Always a good option...  not too fancy, which is good because i don't like dressing up to just go out with my gals or with my husband... their specialty drinks are exciting and delicious and change with the seasons... their fish special is usually FANTASTIC! last time i ate here i was lucky enough to get this pecan crusted catfish with succatash... i actually sent a note back to the kitchen to tell the chef how delicious it was... the wait staff here is always very friendly and professional, and they laugh at my husband's jokes (even the ones that aren't funny)  what more could you want in a server?"
ID X.,"Anchorage, AK",2,59,4,2.0,11/20/2013,"This review is for the MANAGER. I don't know if they read their reviews but I strongly suggest they do. I've been ordering to-go recently and experience major problems. Of what you may ask? Someone picks up and puts you on hold for 15 minutes for a to-go order? I could've been in there receiving my food already. It's really unfair and I've spoken with the workers as well. They claim that there's only one person working at the bakery/togo section. If you're a damn manager you should clearly know that's unacceptable for a restaurant like cheesecake. Not saying it's a 5 star restaurant or anything but most dishes ranges at around 15-20 dollars. So I should be provided decent service whether I am dining inside or outside. Hire more people , I'm sure you can afford it. I doubt the manager reads this review since they can't even do a simple task such as HIRING enough employees. Expect a phonecall and a lost customer."
Magic M.,"Waxahachie, TX",214,433,2,5.0,4/12/2011,Always good!  Everything is good.  Service is very sweet and efficient.  They clearly have a team effort going.  I have liked pretty much everything there I've ever had.  Good passion fruit tea.
Kayla L.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/30/2013,"The food is awesome every time and the staff is super friendly. Samantha, from the front desk, showed us to our table and was so nice asking all about my day. She really seemed to care about what she was asking, so nice!"
Anthony T.,"Santa Clara, CA",9,54,1,1.0,8/17/2012,"Absolutely disgusting. I'm sitting in the restaurant as I write this review. The staff are nice and professional. But as the quality of food goes I find it highly below standard. I got a ""classic burger"" I ate 3-4 bites and gave up. Went to the bathroom to vomit and my stomach is still churning. I will probably never comeback again."
Stephen D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,66,,3.0,1/2/2012,"My favorite appetizer here when I visit Cheesecake Factory is the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. With almost 20 + pages of dishes, it's hard to choose but usually I go with something I know or a favorite. It doesn't hurt to go out of my comfort level though. One of the few restaurants I like."
Anna Marie P.,"Watsonville, CA",0,20,,4.0,8/23/2011,What a great place to have lunch or dinner! And desserts are unbelievable. I have enjoyed all their salads.  The staff is great and friendly.  We don't eat here too often but it's always a treat when we do.
Ro G.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,12,,5.0,12/19/2012,The service was amazing. We were having a bad day and needed a drink. The bartender Nicholas (must go see this guy) not only made the perfect mojito but explained it so well that we had to record it and post it to my Facebook.  Helped us relax on a stressful day and feel welcomed. This experience was a much needed breath of fresh air. Thank you Nicholas. We will be back and be sitting in his section again.
Deanna W.,"San Jose, CA",5,11,,5.0,4/10/2011,"Love this place!  Good service, Good Food, but you do have to get their early on weekends if you don't want to wait."
Krystal N.,"Irvine, CA",92,571,5,3.0,2/20/2010,"Service here sucked. From the hostess to the waiter, everyone looked like they hated their job. Hostess definitely had an attitude problem. Food is just like any other Cheesecake Factory but because of the utterly crappy service, I would rather go to the Valley Fair one any day!"
Barbara S.,"San Jose, CA",2,74,167,3.0,10/19/2013,"I do not get the hype of this place.  The food is not great.  There is a large menu, but not many healthy, good choices, in my opinion.  I would never wait the hour + to get a table as people seem to do.  It's not bad food, but it is overpriced, not worth the wait for a table, not worth the parking situation at this mall, and not a place I'd normally choose to eat.  Some of their cheesecakes can be pretty good, but most are too rich.  If at this mall location, I normally will walk down to Calif. Pizza Kitchen, get an immediate table, and finish what I think is better food before people are seated at the Cheesecake Factory."
Lorie W.,"San Jose, CA",92,14,34,5.0,3/29/2011,WOW! Dinner on Saturday night. The service was great and the food was delicious. The atmosphere is so fun and lively. Highly recommend. Go early unless you want to wait for more than 30 minutes.
Michelle L.,"Coyote, CA",56,54,75,5.0,7/19/2012,My favorite Cheesecake Factory location.  The strawberry martini is awesome.   I have never had a bad meal here.
Trang N.,"San Jose, CA",20,9,,5.0,7/6/2012,"My all time favorite chain restaurant! I love celebrating special occasions or just eating out on a Friday at the Cheesecake Factory. I have never been disappointed with any of their dishes. My favorite dish is the miso salmon which goes great with my chocolate Godiva martini. The last time I dined here was on a Friday evening. I had a fairly large party of 8, so I had to wait 45 minutes for a table. That was to be expected. Then I had to wait 30 minutes for my Godiva martini to come. I expected that too because it was such a busy Friday evening. What I didn't expect was the manager coming out and apologizing to me and my friends and comping our drinks on the house! I love that they are located so close to my home so I can enjoy a savory meal without driving too far."
Yan G.,"San Francisco, CA",367,485,4,2.0,1/26/2009,"The first time I visited The Cheesecake Factory, I thought it was THE BEST THING EVER!  Yep, I was walking around Baltimore and stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant.  The year was 1999.  Internet stocks were going through the roof, Bill Clinton had his hands full with Ms. Lewinsky, and the Denver Broncos won their second straight Super Bowl.  Ahh, the good old days. ""We'll fast forward to a few years later And no one knows except the both of us And I have honored your request for silence And you've washed your hands clean of this"" I still don't know what Alanis meant by all this, but it seemed appropriate here.  Anyway, ten years later I realize that The Cheesecake Factory is not the best thing ever.  I hadn't been to one of their restaurants in a couple of years . . .  until yesterday.  It is still a great place to go with a group of people, because everyone can agree on something.  Their menus are spiral bound and have ads in them, for G-d's sake!  It's not a menu, it's a catalog!  Clearly, they have pretty much everything, since they don't subscribe to the ""do one thing and do it well"" mantra. The food here is fine.  It's not a compliment, I know, but that's exactly what it is.  OK.  Average.  Run-of-the-mill.  Decent.  In a word, fine.  My dining companion had a burger, and I had the Thai Chicken Pasta, one of my staples when I do visit The Cheesecake Factory.  As always, the portion was far too large for any normal human being, and it was actually pretty big for me as well.  The chef certainly did not skimp on the chicken breast slices, peanuts or the Thai sauce.  The bread and butter basket before the meal also filled me up. We were trying to have a nice conversation, but we were being constantly interrupted by our overly eager waiters.  Why would you interrupt someone who is clearly in the middle of the conversation?  More importantly, why would you try to rush your customers?  I saw plenty of open tables, and not too many hungry customers in waiting. The interruptions, however, did not stop with the waiter.  An elderly couple, enjoying their lunch at the adjacent table, were getting progressively more annoyed with the lack of available space on their two-top table.  After a while, they must have thought to themselves: ""we're old and we don't care.""  So, they grabbed their bread basket and set it on the corner of our four-top table.  Before I could say anything, two used bread plates made their way onto our table as well.  I really didn't know what to say or do, because I have this rule about not picking fights with men and women over 70.  I don't know, I guess that's just the way I was raised. The fact that we managed to have a wonderful time despite mediocre food, sub-par service and inconsiderate patrons is clearly a testament to my dining companion's sense of humor and patience. A word about parking: this is the WORST laid out parking lot I have ever seen.  It's basically a bunch of one-way streets, left turns and plastic barriers with far too few parking spaces sprinkled in between.  There's a tendency to over-regulate everything, but I think we can trust people to navigate a parking lot.  Can't we?   Or, is it all just an elaborate scam to get people to valet their cars for $6 a vehicle?  I am on to you, Oakridge Mall!"
Archie G.,"San Jose, CA",1116,1026,42,2.0,1/9/2009,"How can a restaurant with a menu several pages long that has approximately 239 food choices, have so little to offer? The food here is always uninspired. While the food is disappointing, the prices make it even worse. I have friends you who keep dragging me here, so I keep trying different things on the menu. In the end, I feel as if I they are taking stuff out of a freezer, warming it up, and putting it up on my plate. The servers annoy me as well. Every single time I order something, they have to remark how that is a good choice and how delicious that particular entree is. And then it comes out and I am forcing myself to swallow. So yeah, I do not appreciate liars. Nor do I appreciate this restaurant. Or it's crappy cheesecake.  Skip it and find a real restaurant with some sincerity, culture, and most importantly, flavor."
