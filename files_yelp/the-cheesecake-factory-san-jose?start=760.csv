Uyen P.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,19,7,2.0,3/13/2014,"The food was good but service was horrible compared to the one at Valley Fair Mall. The sever forgot to provide a lots of stuff at our lunch without saying sorry at all. Further more, she made us wait 10-15 minutes to take our payment after she gave us the check, again she didn't say sorry."
Elaina C.,"San Jose, CA",50,21,2,4.0,8/23/2012,Avocado egg rolls were fantastic.  We got here at 1PM and there no wait at all!
Sabrina A.,"Mountain View, CA",512,1197,211,3.0,1/9/2009,"The place was packed on a Thursday!  Every table taken, lines of people waiting, the bar packed, it's a crazy busy spot! It's a large hall type of feeling.  Tall ceiling, wooden booths, long, large bar and nice.  It felt very clean, I like that! At the bar waiting I got a vodka pineapple  - the bartender wasn't very friendly and bordered on rude.  I know it was busy, but in general I'm nice . . . . . shouldn't he be? Escorted to our booth, it was spacious, receeded and felt private even in a totally crowded room.  I ordered the steak with mushrooms.  In general for the price it was pretty disappointing.  Not a lot of flavor, the sauce was too thick, the cut of meat not juicy . . . just not that great. I guess if you know that you want something here it could be worth it, maybe some of the more casual dining items or cheesecake!  But I'd pass again on this much too crowded spot. *The waiter was nice, a young man who was attentive without being overly so."
Anya F.,"Palo Alto, CA",23,187,,2.0,1/24/2010,Ate at the bar. Service was okay.  Boneless chicken wings were pretty good. Good portion. The chicken and biscuits was WEIRD. Two chicken breasts beaten to flatness. No cubed or cut or shredded chicken? It would've been much better if I didn't have to cut the chicken. Gravy was okaaaay.  Cheesecake Factory has an enormous selection...but it's just so....eh?
Jeannie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,189,2,4.0,8/1/2009,"First bit of advice- park around on the side of the mall and the mall entrance to TCF is right inside.  You avoid the valet charge and there is no congestion on that side (my visit was on a Saturday night aroun 7pm). Extremely friendly waitress.  Decent service. Chipotle Pasta- what a great taste!  Was a bit wary about the description but had a really nice, mild spice to it.  However, it listed asparagus and unfortunately, there was none on my pasta and was not told that in advance.  I would suggest always telling your customers if you are out of something and have a suggestion ready for something else. My mom had the Navao sandwich and without bread so she mixed it up like a salad.  Was quite delicious.  Also, there are plantains with a jamaican dish and they allowed her to sub those instead of fries so if you are ever in the mood for plantains, that is doable!"
Kathy B.,"San Jose, CA",251,89,23,2.0,2/5/2009,"It's a hit or miss with this place. They're either really friendly and on their A game... or it's a total disaster. Good experience: I went with my boyfriend to this place and the waitress was super nice and came every few minutes to check on us and if we needed refills on our drinks. The food came in a reasonable time as well. Friendly, smiled a lot, and she got a big tip. Bad experience: Again, I went with my boyfriend and our waiter was a complete asshole. It took him 10 minutes to come greet us... walked off and another 10 minutes to take our drinks... and our entrees as well because we were not gonna let him walk away again for another 10 minutes. Food took forever and it didn't help that his eye-brows were in a way that always made him look mad and his words and style of speaking showed that he was one of those jocks in highschool and never got over it. *rolls eyes. I guess it just depends who you get... food though... awesome. I say get the cajun chicken littles.. yummy :)"
Jessica R.,"San Jose, CA",3,67,,3.0,5/18/2012,"Love the fish tacos an of course the cheesecake! Hate that you can't even sit outside at the patio tables for the god awful sewer smell :-( major disgust when I found that out and I honestly don't even know how they can attempt to seat people with that stench. Otherwise, inside is nice and staff is friendly. If you have a small child they give bread and bananas bites."
Kylee A.,"Mountain View, CA",12,68,1,5.0,3/22/2009,"Yeah, 5 stars for this location!  The service is the best I ever had at any Cheesecake Factory. My coworker & I went on a Friday night at round 8:30ish, long waiting line but we were really happy when our wait was less than 15 minutes! Our waiter was some white bald guy. Sooooo nice, he had to take care of some other stuff and he even introduced us to a new waiter which was hella nice too! We had to go to the Twilight Release party and we told him and he was doing the best he could to get us all situated and ready to go asap!  The food is prepared better here too. For some reason my macaroni and cheese was a little more not watery, but it had less cheese but it had more flavor than the one at Valley fair. The Avacado eggrolls were hella good too. My coworker ordered a georgia peach & I ordered a mango smoothie. My mango smoothie had more fruit for decoration for some reason than the Vfair location. I usually get just a strawberry, but min had a lime, strawberry and i think an orange slice? It was hella yumm. I'd mos def come back to this one just cause the service! (="
Judy C.,"San Jose, CA",245,65,,3.0,8/22/2013,"For a chain, I think Cheesecake Factory is a good place to have a nice catch up with friends or a relaxed date. The mood is casual, not too loud where you have to scream across the table to speak to somebody, and the food is good and shareable. I also like how they have small bites because I like variety and I can never finish my own entree. Pricing is very reasonable and cheesecake can get overwhelming, so, like many people, I encourage you to share a slice. What I've tried so far: -Avacado Egg Rolls:  If you love avocados, you'll love their avocado egg rolls. You'll get a heaping amount of avocado in your mouth with the first bite!  -Caesar Salad: Can't really go wrong with a salad. Good part about it was that they didn't drench it in dressing. -Mushroom Soup: Tasty but started to taste a little salty at the end. A cup is actually in a bowl so it's good to share if you have an entree coming out. I can only imagine how big the bowl portion is... -Miso Salmon: Sweet honey glaze, flavorful, and delicious! I opted for brown rice. -Salisbury Steak: Too Salty, SKIP! I was craving sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions that day and didn't want to get a burger (laying low on the carbs). It sounded good but it wasn't. Bleh! Took it home and made a loco moco out of it. -Lemon Chicken: YUM! Get this if you're craving chicken and you love lemon, you wont regret it!"
S O.,"Gilroy, CA",50,2,,1.0,2/16/2013,The food was great. But the service was awful. The lost our name the computer after waiting for a little longer then an hr. we talked to the manager and all he said was sorry we make mistake as if saying I don't care. But then he sends the waitress to tell us sorry and we took an item off for your troubles. Makes me mad that he could not just say that him self. First time and last time here. Will never recommend this place to know one even if the food was ok.
MacCallister A.,"San Jose, CA",0,34,,4.0,3/30/2014,"I come here on a weekly basis because I like the food and service. Drinks could be better. Big plus on the cheesecakes (obviously), never seemed to disappoint me."
Leticia S.,"Hollister, CA",29,60,80,4.0,11/22/2011,"Love this place. Food is always delicious, & the waiters are on top of their game. Great food presentation- had there Chinese chicken salad which was piled high with ingredients ....not no regular flat salad."
Andrew Q.,"Milpitas, CA",3,33,,4.0,9/4/2011,"Great food. C. Factory always makes quality food. not saying all of their food meals are great. But they are prepared well. Accompanying service. So, that's a plus. Desserts...you can't go wrong with desserts here! My god, the lemon-herb roasted chicken is TERRIFIC. good sauce with it. my god.. hahaha Oh, and do try the avocado eggrolls! :) 5-star appetizer !"
Martin B.,"Fort Worth, TX",106,433,221,3.0,10/3/2009,"Pretty much like every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. You go to one you've been to 'em all, but I figured I might as well review it. The service was friendly and rather quick, although it wasn't too crowded. Our waitress was helpful, even though I apparently unintentionally hit on her, and didn't mind giving four different bills. I can imagine it taking much longer at normal eating hours, but we were there around 9:45PM. As for the hitting on thing, I was asking her how filling the fried mac and cheese was and she said it was pretty heavy, and I said something like ""I hope so... I'm a hard man to please."" She immediately decided to ask everyone else for their meals instead after being weirded out by that, hah. The food was fine. I got fried mac and cheese which filled me up very well, and at only 9 bucks it was a steal compared to other meals. My friends got different pasta dishes and they all said they were okay, but also felt as if they'd overpaid for them. I got a 'sweetened green tea' as a drink which tasted really good, and thankfully they gave free refills so that was a plus. The key lime cheesecake was also good. Overall we had a fine time but be ready to either stretch your dollars by getting appetizers or just come without the expectation that you're getting an amazing $15 meal. Cos it'll only be average."
Katrina P.,"Newark, CA",2,5,,4.0,3/31/2012,Went there for our anniversary and was very pleased. Friendly service and was very tasty. Was very busy and parking was hard to find but was worth it when I got to taste the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake was completely and totally awesome :)
Mc N.,"San Jose, CA",5,50,9,2.0,10/28/2009,"Food is great (when it's what you ordered...) I've been to this Cheesecake Factory about 5-6 times now. The quality of food is great but they have literally screwed up my or my wife's order every single time we have gone here. Further, the prices continue to just go up & up & up and the quantity of food on your plate goes down with every visit.  The wait is always out of control (over 2 hours) on the weekends around dinner time..  Parking is also a problem during peak times."
Lisa P.,"San Jose, CA",1,6,,5.0,4/1/2013,"After going to a horrible resturant, I came here. I was very happy with the wonderful service I recieved from Janea. She was warm, personable, and the best waiter I have ever had in every way. I was working on a project of making a thousand cranes. She asked me about. She was timely in refilling our drinks and exuberated friendliness. The next time I went there I had another good waiter named Kevin who was helpful and sought out a phone number to another Cheesecake Factory. I was looking for the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake which has been quite popular this season."
Morgan N.,"San Jose, CA",9,124,2,4.0,12/30/2011,"The food is very good.  The prices are a bit high, but the portions are large.  It can take a while to the get seated during the evening.  Service is always friendly and good.  Extensive menu.  If you visit before dinner time, they offer ""lunch"" prices and portions.  The lunch portions are what you might consider slightly larger than normal.  This one at Oakridge Mall has a mall entrance at the back of the restaurant."
Paul S.,"San Jose, CA",41,356,6,3.0,9/22/2009,"Unfortunately, the mystique of CF is all in appearances. Opulently decorated and dimly lit to echo what a previous Elite said, with service that can be hit or miss depending on if the wait staff is cycling through a break in your section. In the case of my wife and I dining there last night, it was a matter of mediocrity that was just good enough. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. The food was tasty (Chicken Piccatta was quite nice), and the Turtle Cheesecake for desert was very rich. The thing that irked me was that our waiter only checked on us once, after my wife and I had already cleared our plates. A little more attentiveness might have been nice. Wasn't that busy either. A nice dinner, pretty much what I expected. Sad though, it could be so much better if they just raised the bar on the service side. An overhaul in order?"
Eric G.,"Salinas, CA",12,48,4,5.0,12/29/2010,"I had the cajun jambalaya pasta and it was excellent.  There was so much food I could not finish it all, so I decided to at LEAST finish all the chicken and shrimp, along with a fork-full or two of the fettuccine.  It was spicy, which I really liked and is definitely something I would get again.  Lastly I will never go there and NOT get the mint green tea!  I absolutely LOVE it and had about 5 glasses of it."
