Kenny P.,"San Jose, CA",660,881,2500,4.0,4/28/2009,"I was going to be nice and give this place a 4 stars, but then I thought about it again...  3.5 in actuality.   I've been to this particular location a number of times over the years since it opened, mostly for large party dinners.  Although I have been here with a smaller groups of 2-3.  Keep in mind that I have also tried this place originally in Southern California a while before they started becoming more popular up here. At this location, dinner waits on the weekend days can be expected to be 1 hour or more for large parties of 10 or more.  I remember one time our large party got seated for a b-day dinner without any table settings or silverware.  Was pretty strange, first time that happened to me here.  Anyhow, I can safely say that I have never had any major complaints or problems about the food.  Except that it may take a while for your order, depending on what you get.   I usually order the burgers, pastas, or even steak.  Service is usually good and ambiance is nice with popular new music always playing in the background.  This is one thing I always did like about all Cheesecake Factories."
diane d.,"San Jose, CA",186,69,26,3.0,11/7/2009,"ehh...just eh Overly priced food that takes forever to receive. The only real reason why people would go to places like these is because its great for groups. I cannot recall having a ""Great"" experience at a cheesecake factory.  +pricey +alright food, its not the best. what do expect for Americanized places that try to satisfy hundred of customers at once... you get less quality. +bathrooms are clean at least... complaints: there is always something to complain about with food, if not my dish then someone else's -its for ""Group"" dinners so expect major DELAYS, not great when you're starving."
Bryant T.,"San Jose, CA",85,19,1,2.0,5/25/2013,"Cheesecake Factory.... what can i say? Its a good place to get dinner and the food is always great but my latest experience i was not pleased. This isn't about how sucky the food is or anything like that, this is about our horrible experience we had with our waiter.Waiting 30 minutes is normal nothing to complain about that But once we were seated we were greeted by a creepy waiter who made me and my date feel pretty uncomfy. It felt as if he was forcing the menu on us and telling us what he thinks we wanted. we got our food amazingly fast though. We were stuffed! (Tip Louisiana chicken pasta is really good) and to full for desert we were then greeted again by our creepy waiter with a dessert menu. It was not a ""would you like any dessert?"" it was more of ""Get the red velvet its delicious""  and after he left us with the menu a few minutes later he came back and asked ""what would we like?"" After saying I was to full he replied within a second ""You can just take it home."" RUDE? Im not going to say that i will never come back but im sure that if I get him as a waiter again i will surely ask for another one."
Priyanka B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,14,5,4.0,3/3/2010,"We particularly njoyd the 'avacado egg rolls' for the appetizers.  The chicken burger was quite huge...and a lil dry.. But the best part lies in the name of the place ' The cheesecake"". We  tried the 'tiramisu  cheesecake' and the ' chocolate truffle' .Both were extremely awesome...Me being a chocolate fan myself can't stop feeling the happiness I had while plunging in every bite of it. A lil on the pricy side, but extremely grt for its cakes. Would definely recommend it to the dessert lovers!"
Nikki T.,"San Jose, CA",507,20,,4.0,4/25/2012,YUMMM! Red velvet cheese cake is so delicious! Every now and then I'd buy a box for the family pretty pricey but worth it ! The taste is so rich! Why not 5 stars? The food is dry.... everytime I grab a bite to eat I never learn my lesson! I always get steak.Well the place is called cheese cake factory for a reason.
Tee B.,"San Jose, CA",1,47,,4.0,4/3/2011,"First i will start by saying that our waitress (Mikala) was kind, patient, and accommodating, she was already cut but decided to stay so we cvould sit on the patio!!! She was patient with all of my GFs questions.  We were thinking about getting 2 different glasses of wine, she up sold us a carafe which saved us money and gave us more wine!!! The mini corn dogs were bomb!!  Ahi tar tar was ok, more avocado than ahi in it, which was disappointing. My GF got the roasted chicken, I think she liked it.  I got the salmon, steak, and potatoes.  Simple but hearty dish that filled me up."
Ruthie V.,"San Jose, CA",454,685,125,2.0,10/24/2010,"After eating at this location at least a dozen times, it's too bad that I feel compelled to write a review after my first crappy experience realizing I'd not yelped this place until now.  We spent half the day in the mall and in between movies we had a 55 minute window to sit down & eat.  We told the host who seated us that we had a movie to catch and he said he'd let our server know.  So 5 minutes later a server runs by & says he'll be right with us.  He ran by our booth so fast that we didnt' even catch what he looked like but there were at least 8 other servers walking around with absolutely nothing to do or at least it seemed that way.  The place wasn't even half full.  Then 10 minutes later the server comes & says he'll be back with water & bread.  After telling him we were going to a movie in 40 mintues, he took our order, two salads, once sandwich, soup & a burger.  Another 30 minutes go by, still no food so I found the server & told him to box everything up.  The service was so much slower than usual anywya & we had to wait to eat our soggy boxed up food when we got home - NO BUENO!"
Steve S.,"San Jose, CA",848,265,96,4.0,12/16/2008,"The killer app (appetizer, that is) here is the Tex-Mex egg rolls. Without them, Cheesecake Factory would be merely a shadow of its current glorious self.  Other recommendations include the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Cajun Chicken Littles, and Baja Chicken Tacos. The lunch specials are hard to beat in terms of the quality/quantity of food served up for the price. The Oakridge Cheesecake delivers consistently better tasting food than the one at Valley Fair. There was one exception to that when downright cold Tex-Mex egg rolls were delivered to our table here. Shudder, to think of it now."
Connie C.,"Belmont, CA",5000,1539,1424,3.0,8/3/2008,"After two failed attempts at having lunch at Tlaquepaque in Willow Glen, we decided to head over to Oakridge and get a late lunch at Cheesecake. At 2:30, there was no wait, plenty of open booths, and servers were able to be attentive. I'd say, if you can wait to have a late lunch, this is the time to eat here. Let's talk about the frou frou cocktails here first: The Factory Peach Bellini. Remember that. It's blended. And if you like fruity tropical drinks, you'll love this. I want to have a Factory Peach Bellini machine at my house. I could drink these all day. Now the food. You know the menu is as thick as a novel, and there's something for everyone. The three of us shared the fried chicken sliders with fries (remember the Chicken Littles at KFC? Admit it, you liked them too. Well, these are like that, but crispier and more filling) and the chicken quesadillas, which were full lunch sized portions for us. It was so much food, that we ended up taking some home. A slice of cheesecake is always in order here, and we shared the white chocolate macademia nut (very nutty). I have a feeling that if The Cheesecake Factory in Macy's Union Square wasn't such a major tourist trap and was located, say around the corner from Yelp HQ, you'd find me and the Miss Yelps having lunch here a lot. Like CPK, Cheesecake has some pretty solid dishes. Yes, it's a chain, but I won't hate."
Anna-Marie C.,"San Jose, CA",15,67,,2.0,4/15/2014,"Very seldom have I been disappointed with Cheesecake Factory. Well, this time I do have to complain. I ordered a spicy stir fry chicken with brown rice. It took about 20 min. for the waitress to come back to let us know that the brown rice was not ready. She then asked if white rice was okay with me, and I said yes. Finally our food arrived. By then a half hour had passed. I took a bite of the chicken, and I couldn't believe it, the chicken tasted like it had been soaked for 2 days in soy sauce. It had such a strong taste!! I told the waitress, and she nicely said if I wanted something else. Of course after waiting for so long I said no. I did not want to wait again. I struggled through the dish, and gave some of the chicken pieces to my friends. They felt the same way I did, it was way to strong of a taste. Very disappointing!!  So anyway I will continue to patronize this restaurant, but, don't order that dish it was terrible and a waste of money. The waitress apologized, I do feel she could have at least given me a free piece of pie."
Josh B.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,9,,4.0,5/28/2012,"A great place to go if you have a large group of people who have a wide variety of tastes. Cheesecake Factory doesn't do any dish very well but do them pretty well and instead offer a large variety of foods and drinks. We had the pasta jambalaya, which doesn't compare to a nice Italiano restaurants jambalaya but props to them for trying!"
Richard P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2012,"Just left the Valley Fair location. First off, table and silverware were dirty when we arrived  and I needed to request new silverware and plates.  When the meal arrived and starting in on the meal I noticed a dead beetle? Cockroach? I wouldn't know for sure as I am not familiar with having insects in my meals.  Brought this immediately to our servers attention after a few minutes the manager apologized for the situation and comped my inedible meal but dis not have the sense to comp the table as the other meal was immediately abandoned as well. I didn't want to further the issue as I wanted to leave I was so freaked and grossed out.  Warning do not order the filet as it just may come with a side of bug!"
Totran M.,"San Jose, CA",62,122,54,3.0,3/10/2009,". . . don't be fooled this is not a fine-dining establishment as The Cheesecake Factory would like to believe -- it is a chain and they cut corners to turn as many tables as possible. The cheesecakes and most of the desserts come to the place frozen (""deeply chilled"" as they like to call it), the 'shortcake' for the Strawberry Shortcake dessert is the same biscuit they use for the chicken and biscuits.  For a chain with a menu with 200+ items you're going to have hits and misses. I do like their chicken madeira and they have the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had at any establishment.  Atmosphere: It can be loud on busy nights, if you aren't in a booth you can end up at a banquet sitting too closely to your neighbors, decor is nothing amazing but nicer than other chains, if you sit outside you have a view of the parking lot which can smell like sewer Service: All the staff is trained to give you the best dining experience BUT some servers/hostess don't give a poop. Unfortunately, like many places, the servers will judge you on whether or not you look like a good tipper. If you don't order drinks or appetizer you can pretty much forget being waited on properly. Food: Don't come here for authenticity. Most items on the menu are good and you get HUGE portions -- enough for 2 or 3 meals. Cleanliness: The kitchen is clean and nothing gross. Bathrooms are taken care of by the front desk hostess's -- if its not stocked and clean tell someone at the front desk. Value: If you are willing to wait to be seated I'll say that the food quality and amount served are worth the prices"
Roger A.,"Burlingame, CA",171,1719,166,3.0,10/18/2009,I waited for a long time... just left.   Staff was very nice.  But place was too crowded.
Julie T.,"San Jose, CA",135,118,8,5.0,8/8/2011,Who can complain about Cheesecake!! The food is good and so is the service!! Thanks Dina for taking care of us!! You get 10 stars from me :)
Theresa E.,"Los Gatos, CA",11,19,,4.0,2/29/2012,"Would have given them a five star, if I didn't have to wait so long to be seated, every time I go there. On the bright side it just means that everyone else loves them too!!!  BBQ chicken salad is awesome!!"
Jehzabella V.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/19/2010,I hate this one. The valley fair one is much better  This Oakridge mall location has bad service..everytime...
Victoria F.,"San Jose, CA",323,87,37,3.0,7/21/2011,Consistently has good food. Has lost its cache from when I was younger. It is a fun place for a bday or if you have a large group.
Oanh L.,"San Jose, CA",264,251,73,3.0,5/28/2009,"why ill keep coming back: -skirt steak with mashed potatoes -mango icy with raspberry puree.. -their complimentary bread .. my favorite! other than that.. service is on/off, a little expensive, really dark in here, and cheesecakes arent yummy, what gives!"
Joe P.,"Rocklin, CA",141,434,73,3.0,6/12/2011,"90% sure the food is mostly pre-made... possibly microwaved.  But either way, it is OK.  Not a huge fan - but it isnt bad.  Makes up for it by having simply stellar cheesecake.  Red velvet cheesecake is the best I've ever had in my whole life.. and I eat a LOT of cheesecake (well, not as much as I used to when my metabolism was 100 times better than it is now)."
