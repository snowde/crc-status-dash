Ashley H.,"South San Francisco, CA",33,4,2,2.0,10/2/2017,I came to eat at Cheesecake Factory today and got the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and I specially asked for no cheese in my sandwich and I had a feeling she was going to get it wrong since she didn't even write my order down then they brought out my food with cheese so I told them I asked for no cheese so the guy brings it back to the kitchen and comes right back out with it and says does it look better now I said yes thanks cause the sheesh was gone. But I turn over the bun to the bottom side and find they just scraped the cheese off. It would be a big deal if they actually got all of it off but they left a bunch on there and I'm lactose intolerant. They should think about these things when people say no cheese I shouldn't have to say it they should just get it right the first time.
Mary H.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,4.0,12/8/2017,"Ok, love the food and service, but it's just too cold in here! Wearing my leather jacket and scarf, and still cold! Other customers are cold too!"
Alicia J.,"San Jose, CA",46,75,7,5.0,5/21/2017,"My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and watched the Giants game and had and great time. We were able to take our time and the bartender didn't rush us. I don't remember his name but he was from Australia or New Zealand. He was *fantastic*. We had two bottles of champagne, appetizers, and dinner, spent $250, and couldn't have left happier. I always have a good time when I go here."
Trang T.,"San Jose, CA",291,226,49,1.0,2/5/2017,"This place is such a joke. They can't even answer your phone calls when you try to call in an order. Even when you do get through, they will transfer your call to another line and make you  wait 25+ minutes on hold (not sure how long that was cause after that amount of time I gave up.) RIDICULOUS! People are better off getting togo orders some place else cause the amount of time you spend trying to order through the phone...you could've already picked up your food elsewhere."
Sonia A.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",2,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory- Blossom hill, San Jose.  I had the worst experience at the Cheesecake Factory at this location last night. It was terrible. We were party of 9 (including 3 young kids). The person in the front 'Bernard' was very rude and arrogant. We were told it was a 2hr wait. We waited. Even though we could see our table was ready with table ware n everything for the past 30 minutes (as we were waiting on the outside and asked for our table outside they didn't want to let us sit. It was more of a power struggle. Cause it was few minutes before '2 hrs' (mind you we had 3 kids with us) why not just let us sit and settle down. The person in the front kept saying 2hr wait and we won't know until another few minutes. We asked him to come outside and see from his eyes that the table is ready. But he said No to that. He just wanted us to wait and how dare we question him before our time. The table is set for 9 ppl outside for the past 30 minutes. It was our table. He was just very rude. We called the manager, Vincent, he made us sit there right away but no apology or anything. Finally sitting down. Ready to order. We wanted to order pasta for kids with a small change. Change white sauce to pesto sauce. Apparently that was too much for the kitchen to understand. We ordered the big plate in the end for them to share. Then we ordered Nachos without sour cream and add beans. But of course, it had sour cream and no beans. In addition to partly stale nacho chips. Asked for extra plates, they were dirty. Of course, no manager or anything came to check on us on how the food was. All in all, never going back to that location for sure."
B E.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/22/2017,"Stars: -5 On 8/21/17, i and my wife arrived at 10.20pm to eat. Shortly after, we were seated at a table w/bread crumbs and w/out napkins. 1025pm. Order (not written) 1. French fries w/ranch & ketchup. 2. Wheat & sourdough bread. 3. Bang bang chicken w/shrimp & white rice (mine) 4. Chicken shrimp gumbo (wife). 5 minutes later, stiff waitress returns to confirm if my order was Jamaican chicken and shrimp. I responded Bang bang chicken w/shrimp & white rice. 5 minutes later; 1. French fries arrive with 2 ketchup. I notify waitress (different) we ordered ranch dressing. Corrected. 10 minutes later (order arrives) My bang bang chicken arrives with mushy (new born meal)  disgusting spoilt rice. Spouse meal arrives with Jambalaya (wrong order). Waitress notified, off to have correct order made.   2 minutes later Notify original waitress of problem with order, request for new order. Waitress removes my order. 1 minute later; John (manager) arrives at my table, dismissively tells us that was the last food for the day, no more rice. Not wanting any more drama, we requested for our bill, paid and left. Customers since 2009 (including dining out with family)."
Neca N.,"San Jose, CA",91,13,,1.0,8/18/2017,I am giving this place a 1 star because of the server ! Nicole 1 she doesn't know the different btw a blended margarita From on the rocks . So when I told her she delivered the wrong drink she rolled her eyes like I I was the stupid one . This is after me staring at her for 20 min trying to get her to come to the table . Also from the beginning I can tell she hates her job it took her 10 min to even come to are table and when she did she said what would u like to order. I was like wait what is your name and then she rolled her eyes like why was I asking. Horrible maybe because I was Hispanic and she was white not sure what was going . After ordering we waiting another 45 min for r food. I am going to tell u guys how crazy this shit is my son when to see Annabel at 8:45 p.m and it's now 10 and we still haven't gotten r food
Gerardo A.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,3,1.0,3/26/2017,"Went into cheesecake for a quick take out dessert.... only to get home and be disappointed once again. I ordered a cheesecake and first of all it wasn't in its normal container  it was in a takeout container ... second they didn't put any whipped cream as they always do!!!!! So disappointed with this cheesecake. It's an 8$ piece of cake!!!! I expect to get what I'm paying for!!!! This is an update post, because I went back just a dessert. 4-26-17.. - a couple months back Got some takeout and not happy at all. When I open  my box the amount of pasta in there was a joke! I've eaten at cheesecake and order takeout all the time therefore I know what the portions are normally like... I paid 18$ for this pasta I expect to get what I paid for. Management please talk to your staff make sure stuff like this doesn't happen!!!!"
Raquel R.,"San Jose, CA",7,13,1,1.0,11/25/2017,"I have dealt with cheesecake for the absolute last time tonight. My family and I have eaten at cheesecake for years because we have enjoyed the delicious food there, however due to how poor the service has been on multiple occasions we have decided to stop going to the actual restaurant and enjoy the food from the comfort of our own home through door dash. However tonight since my husband happened to be going to the mall I decided to call in ahead of time for our family of 8 and was placed on hold for 25 minutes, at about 10 minutes in I had begin to think that maybe they forgot I was on the line, but worried about losing my place in line and starting all over again I decided to be patient and wait it through, only to wait for a total of 25 minutes for them to pick up the phone and hang up on me!!! As you can imagine I was furious so I called back and asked to speak to the manager who ""happened"" to answer the phone & said his name was Vincent, I explained to him what had happened and asked him what the average wait time was, and if that was how they usually handle phone orders and his words to me were, ""Sorry that happened, we have 2 bakers taking orders & we can't exactly hang up on the orders coming in to take your order, I guess we could have gotten on the phone to tell you we are trying to get to you and to hold on, we are working on getting better.""  Well I'm sorry if you have 2 bakers taking orders and so many orders coming in that a person has to wait on the phone for 25 minutes only to be hung up on, that sounds to me like there is nothing really being done here to help cheesecake truly working on things getting better. Maybe the bakers should be in the back baking, I'm pretty sure cheesecake makes enough money to hire additional people to answer phones so that people aren't having to wait on the phone only to be hung up on. On average my family has had dinner through cheesecake twice a month and this is just the final straw for me. As you can imaging it was already frustrating holding for so long but they were busy and I understood that, and secondly mistakes happen I also understand that but when you are a manger it is your job to diffuse bad situations even when you aren't the cause and I just feel that on top of everything that already went bad Vincent also could have handled the situation better and diffused it much better than he did. So though this review is explaining 1 particular incident it's the final straw that caused me to write this particular review and as far as their customer service goes cheesecakes gets 0 stars, and because of the way they treat people and their poor customer service skills I won't ever be ordering through door dash anymore either."
R. J. S.,"San Jose, CA",3,57,1,1.0,9/18/2017,"This review is for the Factory Burrito Grande:  ""A Monster Burrito with Chicken, Cheese, Rice, Onions and Peppers."" We normally like their food, and have been satisfied with our previous trips. Yesterday, we had lunch here, and I ordered this burrito. If I'm not mistaken, the list of ingredients should be listed in order of quantity of ingredients.  I can say that I had approximately 1oz of chicken in this burrito, along with about 2 cups or white rice, wrapped up in a huge tortilla, with some cheese melted on top. This burrito should be called a Rice Burrito, with a little bit of chicken and cheese. I asked for no onions, but then got no peppers (which I wanted). How can Cheesecake Factory feel good about themselves when the rip off their customers for $17.99 for a rice burrito? I complained about it, and they made me another one. Guess what, more of the same - another Rice Burrito... On top of that, my wife ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad, which states its topped with Grilled Chicken. She dug and dug and dug and barely found any chicken in her salad. I didn't realize there was a National Chicken shortage happening... maybe it's due to the hurricanes. What a rip-off! As a side note, showed the server and let her know our thoughts. She said she notified her manager, and he was going to talk to the Chef. As I said above, they provided a second burrito, but it was just the same as the first (all rice, with a tiny bit of chicken)."
Clara H.,"San Jose, CA",143,280,82,2.0,4/18/2017,"This place has its good days and bad days like everyone else. On a particular Saturday night it was bad. I should have known better to come here on a busy Saturday night.  Bread and drinks came in a timely manner, however, my dinner did not come in a timely manner for one reason or another I didn't get a solid answer just some blah blah blah this and that yada yada yada how about a soup or salad while you wait for your dinner ? The manager said it was clam chowder but I don't think it was clam chowder because it didn't taste like clam chowder. I had a few bites and let my  friends finish it off.  Finally my food came. The moment I was waiting for all that anticipation just to be disappointed in the dish which was the crispy pineapple chicken and Shrimp with veggies and rice. I remembered asking for brown rice but at that point I wasn't going to bother.  Moral of this story: stick to what you know!  This has happened to me once before so I guess you roll the dice when you dine here"
Joanne Y.,"San Jose, CA",488,486,369,4.0,1/30/2016,"I usually don't write reviews for large chain restaurants like this one, but the service my friends and I received definitely compelled me to write one!  The wait for a Saturday night was about 45 minutes which is typical. We were seated by our server Mary. I have to say she's the sweetest, most attentive waitress I've encountered as of late. She made sure to let us know that we would have to wait for our bread because it was being freshly baked. She took our drink and meal orders very promptly. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta but subbed rice for the pasta. It was delicious! I think it was around $17, but the portion was huge! We also got the banana cheesecake omg BOMB! Mary made sure we had everything we needed/wanted. She was always quick to refill my water before I completely ran out. Someone get that girl a raise please! Shout out to Mary :)"
Sara H.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/4/2017,LOVEEEEEEE comign to this location. I always get way better service! Got my food lickity split! My go to spot. The waiter( didn't get his name) was outstanding
Linh N.,"San Jose, CA",232,107,93,5.0,7/26/2016,"This review is solely for our server Mary.  We were seated almost immediately which was much more refreshing than the normal hour wait. She was very sweet and informative. I was at a lost looking through the menu and not only did she make great food recommendations, but also drinks to compliment!  She was very attentive and made sure to refill our drinks and bread before we even asked!"
Julia H.,"San Jose, CA",85,148,327,3.0,4/8/2017,"The wait was typical for a Friday night, 30-45 minutes. The service was excellent, the waitress did everything she could within her means. The wait time for the food was about 35 minutes which I felt was pretty normal. My food, sadly needed to be returned. I ordered the vegeburger with French fries. The picture I took was before I attempted to eat my burger. As soon as I picked up my burger I felt the soggy bread, which I felt was because after the burger was made it just sat there. I was okay with this. The part that got me was when the patty broke into small pieces and fell out of my burger. It literally looked like I ordered a rice dish.  I had to wait about 5 minutes before my waitress walked by, and I asked her if this was the norm. She said definitely not and offered to make me a new one. At this point by husband was half way done eating, so I felt that I couldn't wait another 30 minutes for my food. I ended up opting for something that requires no cooking. I ordered Cesar salad and clam chowder. The chowder was completely disappointing as it tasted like potato soup. The salad was yummy, but you can't really go wrong with Cesar salad.  All in all, it was a very average experience. My husband did enjoy his ribeye, and I loved the complimentary bread, and I did enjoy the egg roll appetizer! Yummy sauces! Also, the waitress did take the burger off our bill. Yet, we ended up paying for the salad and soup which I didn't feel like eating and was my only option because my husband had already started eating his meal. By the time my salad and soup came out my husband was done eating. I ended up taking the salad and soup home and is still sitting in the fridge as I am writing this review. Watching my husband eat isn't my ideal date night, and having to order on a whim anything that can be made quickly and having to pay for something I didn't want or eat, well it could have been a little better.  Still, I do like this place and I'll be back. Maybe at that time, I can update this review!"
Ken P.,"Livermore, CA",0,259,1,4.0,9/6/2017,"First of all, I hate cheese cake. It doesn't matter what kind, or who makes it.  I went there tonight and had a spicy Thai shrimp and chicken over rice. It was great.  4 stars if it hadn't taken so long to get our order. It wasn't even busy.  I will go back though. Food is great."
Amy D.,"San Jose, CA",15,80,28,4.0,9/11/2017,"Great place to come eat, drink & visit with friends! Food is almost always on point but service can be slow sometimes. Beware of long wait times, especially on the weekend. Attached to Oakridge mall means you can walk & shop your food off."
John L.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Was in San Jose today (coming from Monterey County). I was in the mood for Chicken Costoletta and thought I would place a to-go order. Some guy picks up the phone, I told him what I wanted to do, and he said ""I'll transfer you over to the bakery and someone there will take your order. So I was put on hold and I waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Finally I hung up and decided to talk to the manager. When I called back, someone named Kelsey or Chelsea answered and identified herself as the manager. I told her that apparently, no one there is interested in picking up the phone to take orders. I suggested that she tell her staff to make sure that they make sure that someone is available when transferring calls. Don't eat at this restaurant.  FOLLOW-UP: Guest Relations Department gives cut-and-paste responses. NOBODY in there reads these things. The response that I got is the EXACT same response they posted to someone else's review about the same problem I experienced. Twenty-something gum chewers working there, and canned responses when you have an issue. DON'T EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT. They don't deserve your business."
Anj N.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/18/2017,"We had a great experience coming here for lunch. Our waiter was on top of everything and absolutely nice! The appetizers and dishes were good, especially the desserts! I had the hot chocolate fudge sindae! Everyone left happy."
Michael B.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,30,11,2.0,5/1/2017,Don't come at shift change it will feel like you ordered dinner and not lunch. We got here at 3:20 and had to send our lettuce wraps back because they were cold after waiting an initial 28 minutes. By the time they were returned we had been at our table for over an hour.  Furthermore we asked our original server for extra sauce and instead of bringing them on a separate plate she crammed everything on the wraps plate and of course they all mixed together. If We had wanted mixed sauces We would have asked for a large side of mixed.  The server was just lazy and it showed in her over all presentation of the food when it arrived at our table.
