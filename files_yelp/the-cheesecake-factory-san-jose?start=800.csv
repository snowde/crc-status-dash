Angela L.,"San Francisco, CA",47,997,621,4.0,9/20/2009,"FOOD: 1.) Choc Tuxedo Cheesecake = Yum, totally chocolatey to appease my PMS cravings :P~ Super super rich, I only ate 1/5th of it . Shoulda ordered a glass of milk. Ah wewls. But pretty cool, bc this choc cake is going to last me all week. A few bites a day. Just as the doctor would prescribe, I'm sure. But you know what it didn't taste cheesecakey. Like it was more like regular chocolate cake, with a layer of chocolate mousse. O vells . SERVICE: I always like the service at Cheesecake. ATMOSPHERE: Not as big as Valley Fair's .... ergo not as nice... But still in comparison to other restaurants, I still like Cheesecake's atmosphere of dim lighting, and faux roman grandeur."
C P.,"Concord, CA",2,27,,4.0,12/30/2010,"I've been here a couple times and I'm glad to say that it hasn't disappointed me. My experiences at The Cheesecake Factory are overall good.  The red velvet cheesecake is something to absolutely try as well as the mango smoothie (I forgot the actual name of it). The portions are great and it's a little pricey but it's all worth it!  Still can't get that mango smoothie out of my mind, soooo good!"
Matthew M.,"Chicago, IL",64,41,,4.0,9/10/2011,"The service at this location is kind of hit-or-miss: not really up to the Cheesecake Factory standard.  The food, however, is amazing, particularly the cheesecake."
Devon H.,"San Jose, CA",11,88,,2.0,2/16/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is the most generic restaurants I can think of. But sometimes simplicity is dining is a good thing. Service here is average, the tables seem a bit cramped, and the wait for your food can be lengthy. A few pluses would be the lunch menu (with a plethora of options for under 10 dollars), the selection of iced teas, and of course, the cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake is rich and overly sugary, but a great dessert. The chocolate raspberry truffle is pure decadence. A piece of advice -- split the cheesecake, it's a bit much for one. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory is a solid dining experience. It is nothing special, but it's affordable, and most of all, predictable. You know what you're getting, and it's okay."
Dana T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/17/2014,"The food here is always done well, not to mention the dozens of delicious flavors of cheesecake!!  I always get my slice to-go because I've stuffed myself full of food.  The drinks from the bar are also delightful in both taste and presentation."
Denise A.,"Salinas, CA",12,49,61,4.0,1/17/2011,"This branch is just like any other Cheesecake factory, yummy yummy yummy! I love this place not only for their delectable cheesecakes but for their entrees. I've had a few of their burgers and pastas and they're consistently pretty good. Their drinks are also very scrumptious but it's a little ridiculous when they're the same price as an entree (my mom's martini was $11!!). I love the atmosphere, very good for dates and large groups."
Stina L.,"Cupertino, CA",1,48,18,2.0,11/11/2011,"I went there today with a girlfriend and ordered my fave-Thai Chicken Pasta. Normally, I love it! Today, it was dry and literally there was only three pieces of chicken in the entire dish. I had to ask for extra sauce and even then it was not enough! Disappointing. I will not be going to this one again."
Linda T.,"San Jose, CA",50,34,1,3.0,9/24/2011,"I went there for dinner with friends this evening. We were seated quickly and our server was friendly I ordered off the new Skinnylicious menu. I had the Tuscan Chicken. It was ok, but I won't otder it again. The chicken was fine and plentiful, but the taste of the balsamic got tedious. Everything on thte plate tasted the same. The farro was under the chicken and drenched in he sauce. I would have preferred it dry on the side so I could have had something that didnt taste like balsamic. I had one piece of artichoke, I couldnt find one caper on the plate, there was a mountain of tomatoes and a few tiny piece of broccoli rabe underneath everything. Less chicken, more veggies and keep the sauce off the farro - that would have made me happier. One of my tablemates got the chicken tacos off the Skinnylicious menu and those looked realy good.. next time!  Service was fine. Bathroom - trash can was pulled off the wall and there was a mountain of discard towels on the floor near it. The place was really really LOUD.. difficult to hear people 2 feet away."

Jackee K.,"San Jose, CA",165,383,3,3.0,7/7/2011,"I come to this location quite often with my friends who have children.  The staff here are always very accommodating and nice when it comes to the kids.  The service is pretty quick, and I've never had to wait too long.  I get a little disappointed in their salads, it seems that the lettuce is always way too wet, like they didn't spin it well enough after rinsing.  Otherwise, decent place!"
Duane Z.,"San Jose, CA",11,56,,4.0,1/14/2009,"Ok, some of these reviewers need to take a course with Miss Manners....  how rude!  After eating at Cheesecake Factory a few times, I can say this is an outstanding restaurant. Whether you come as a single, a couple, or a group, doesn't matter - there's plenty of room for everyone.  Waitstaff are dressed impeccably in white shirts, black pants and white aprons.  The decor is stylish and sophisticated. Order a delicious cocktail or wine with your meal, and begin with a thorough reading of the menu.... The menu boasts jaw dropping 10 full pages of mouth-tingling, taste-bud stimulating and mind-boggling sampling of every cuisine from around the world!!!  Talk about variety and spice!  Every cuisine imaginable is listed here.... start with some appetizers: Cuban pork mini-bites, Vietnamese Spring Rolls, or Advocado Egg rolls. Entrees are a sampling from The South, New England, Tex-mex, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, South American.  Whatever region you feel like tasting, there it is.  So, take time to read the menu and pick something you like from Louisiana Parmesan Crusted Chicken to Meatloaf.  Plenty of vegetarian selections available too. The cheesecakes.....  oh my goodness!  If you don't have the time to have a slice - take the hint -  get one and take it home with you!  CCK Factory will box your food up for take-home.  The best I've had is the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake topped with a load of whipped cream!  or splurge a little on chocolate and have the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake.  There's like 50 to choose from.   Very creamy, delectable and flavorful.  Worth the money to spend on!"
Jennifer L.,"Cupertino, CA",69,158,8,3.0,2/18/2009,"We lucked out last night with a parking place close to the restaurant.  This was probably due to the fact that it was a) still raining a little bit; b) a Tuesday night; and c) smack dab in the middle of ski week. Usually, parking is a nightmare at this location with nearby businesses including the theaters and California Pizza Kitchen.  There is $6 valet parking, so if you are willing to fork over a little dough, you can save yourself some aggravation. Once in the restaurant, it wasn't busy at all.  (See first paragraph of this review for explanation of this.)  Usually, the wait at this restaurant is a nightmare.  You can spare yourself some aggravation by a) not going to The Cheesecake Factory; b) ordering takeout (which also takes care of the parking issue); c) arriving for dinner at around 3:30 in the afternoon. On to the food.  The portions at this restaurant are huge.  Past experience has shown that if you eat your meal first, you will never have room for dessert.  My husband's solution?  Order dessert first!  Great. /sarcasm.  Kudos to our waiter Christian for not making fun of us when we did this. My husband ordered three slices:  Oreo Cookie Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, and Mud Pie cake.  The good news is that my three stepsons joined us with their appetites.  The boys devoured the cake like army ants over a cow carcass.  I blinked and the dessert was gone.  Probably better for my waistline.   I can't tell you how the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake was.  I didn't even get a bite of that.  Curses to you, Ryan!  The Mud Pie Cake and the Chocolate Mousse cake were delicious, with the latter being my favorite: smooth, creamy and chocolaty. We didn't have huge appetites after dessert first and the little ones quickly felt the effects of our first course like a junkie who has just mainlined crank.  They were bouncing in their seats from the sugar rush. I ordered the Endive, Pear and Blue Cheese salad.  It was crisp, flavorful and delicious with lots of blue cheese and not too much dressing.  The kids split an order of sliders.  They were really greasy.  As far as sliders go, you'll do better at Chili's.   One of my stepsons ordered Rigatoni Arrabbiata.  He probably should have read the description better.  It has red pepper flakes in it and it was really spicy.  Not just spicy by his or my husband's standards (they are wimps in this regard) but spicy by my standards.  The waiter offered to correct this by putting Parmesan cheese on top.  This didn't fix it (der), so they replaced it with a less spicy version.   The other end of the table ordered chicken nachos, which were tasty.   It is a pretty rare occasion when our family decides to eat out at The Cheesecake Factory.  I think the bottom line is that the food isn't so great to make it worth the hassle and wait.  However, if you can find a time when it isn't busy, it is a perfectly decent place to eat."
LoveMeTender t.,"San Jose, CA",50,113,24,2.0,8/31/2011,Not to long of await on Sundays great servers and great drinks however after they offered us fresh pepper and Parmesan they forgot to come back and give it .. wasn't very busy either so we may just try a different location next time.
Eric K.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,32,,4.0,10/14/2011,"Service is quick and friendly. Food is great and, as is usual with the Cheesecake Factory, in portions that boggle the mind. The only issue that this place is almost always packed. Waits on weekday evenings can exceed thirty minutes. Worth the wait if you have the time but be prepared."
Paras B.,"San Jose, CA",8,97,,3.0,8/29/2009,Love the food here and the service is usually ok.  We have had a couple of weird experiences like plastic wrap in the salad.  But they were nice enough to give us free cheesecake...I have to be honest and say that it was pretty gross when we saw it. Love the drinks.  Parking is a drag since it is in the mall.
Turtlefan R.,"San Jose, CA",4,2,,1.0,5/5/2012,"The food at this place really sucks, i seen a lot of the cooks cough and sneeze and not cover their mouths when the chefs are cooking your food, their food is really bland over priced.. ( how do I know, I know cause I work there).. They also do not care if you are sick, the bosses will still make you work, and if you don't have medical insurance and no doctors note, they will still make you work and threaten an employee to take them off the schedule..  This company doesn't really care to much about their employees, especially those who wash the dishes,  we work the hardest and we get no respect, we have to work more than 6 hours straight before we take lunch and no 10 minute break in between or anything to eat they work us like slaves at this company, to top it off that really makes me mad is all the food they throw away, perfectly good food untouched that can be donated to the local mission or food bank, and it all goes in the garbage, this goes on every night it is a shame..."
Carol T.,"San Jose, CA",166,210,39,4.0,2/2/2009,"Though I've been here a couple of times, there were some things did bother me that the other reviewers did write down. Cons: *I did have to wait a little over 1hr. 20mins. & I was about 6 to 7 months pregnant, And I did seem to see a few other tables that were free. But I think the only reason was that the waiters/waitresses can only handle so much at a time. But I used that time to wait, to go around the mall and look around till our time was go and sit down. *The waiter taking about maybe 10 minutes. That only happened once, only because he was busy with other customers, and we were on the hunt of looking at the menu to see what to order, but we ended up not minding. *The parking is indeed impossible, so if you don't want to wait, I suggest Valet Parking, it's usually $6. Pros: *The entrees are really big, so trust me, don't eat too much on the bread they give you, but the upside, at least you can munch on them while waiting for your food. *The staff are really nice even when I was pregnant, and was prepared at any cost. Overall the food was good, and also the service was good. Cost: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, & 2 cheesecakes = $68 w/ tax and all."
Jeene L.,"San Jose, CA",69,92,175,2.0,8/19/2011,"undesirable customer experience, they're too cheap to hire enough servers & cook, just don't care about their customers.  we also had a waiter that smokes so he reeked of an ash tray like smell. the food was tasty but the service was poor."
Melanie C.,"San Jose, CA",81,279,50,2.0,5/23/2008,"We came for mother's day.  The crowd was not too bad for brunch. As always, everything at Cheesecake Factory is overpriced.  Freaking $4 for a drink, are you kidding me? Very little here is vegetarian.  I ordered the morning quesadilla without the bacon, as that was the only ingredient that screamed meat. The server had the wherewithall to come back and ask - although it's not listed on the description for some reason, it also has chorizo.  Okay, no chorizo.  Then he comes back again.  The black beans?  They're made with chicken stock.  Come on now, is that really necessary? Alright, so he offers to replace the beans with a vegetable.  I choose the broccoli. When my entree comes, there is no broccoli to be found.  Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, but why ask about a substitute if you're not actually going to use it? I also noticed it had no ""tomato cream sauce"" as listed in the description.  I'm assuming this is because that too had chicken stock in it, but nobody said anything about it, it was just not there. The sides (guacamole, salsa, sour cream) all tasted fresh and were a nice complement to the meal.  However, they were not included in my take-home box with my leftovers!  Bummer.  This is why I prefer to box my own, thanks.  I pay that much for a meal, I want ALL of the meal. Cheesecake Factory may taste good, but it is regularly overpriced, and unnecessarily antivegetarian, so I carry a grudge.  I used to love the corn tamale appetizer until I found out those had chicken stock too, and while I don't know for sure, even the bread tasted like it had been basked with some sort of bacon juice.  At this point I'm afraid to even drink the tea.  Other restaurants kindly list which items on the menu are vegetarian or can be made vegetarian, why can't Cheesecake Factory?"
HEATHER S.,"Fremont, CA",22,29,,5.0,9/27/2010,Came in here a couple of weeks ago Darren served us at the bar. Excellent service and company. Watched the giants game and ate fatty delicious food with my man and his son plus  girlfriend. Fried Marconi and cheese plus a BLT salad. My only gripe is that the fettuccine with sun dried tomato had no flavor but Darren tried to make it better. We tried the new Reese's cheesecake. Overall left stuffed to the gills.
