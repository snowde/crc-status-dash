Danny K.,"Cupertino, CA",188,285,62,3.0,3/25/2009,"Does anyone else think The Cheesecake Factory is overrated? This is one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurants.  She raves about their food and of course their cheesecake.   Honestly, I've been to this specific Factory MANY times.  The food is obviously the same as any other Cheesecake Factory but I must say, I have mixed reviews about their service.  Honestly, I think they have better service when they're busy.   I've been to this restaurant when it was very slow and waited for my food for an extremely long time (I'm talking close to any hour). I guess service really depends on your server.  Overall, the restaurant is OK, I just think they serve typical American food, nothing special.  Their cheesecake is good but I've had some better at some small mom and pop restaurant.  The restaurant is designed beautifully and the service is above average."
Mama Q.,"San Jose, CA",121,234,51,4.0,3/28/2011,"The service has been hit and miss each time I come here, but it's been a good place to eat when you want someplace with good atmosphere yet isn't stuffy. The miso salmon has always been my favorite, and they have an affordable small plates menu for when you don't want to get stuffed or bring home leftovers. I didn't like the tropical iced tea - I heard the green tea was better. Of course, the meal isn't complete without a slice of cheesecake, and the good part is that one slice could hit the spot for 3 people :)."
Janine M.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,,2.0,11/17/2013,I love cheesecake factory just love it but this location has gone down hill in my opinion.  The bathroom was disgusting!!!  No toilet paper at all!! There was tissue all over the floor & garbage pouring out of the trash bin.  It looked like no one had cleaned it in some time.  Just gross!!  Cheesecake was fabulous as always.  My food was terriable... I ordered a french dip type of sandwich and it had horseradish on it which is normally served on the side I requested another sandwich as I cannot eat horseradish.  They brought me another one but the 2nd one they brought looked gross.  The meat was all bloody and full of fat.  I'm just really disapointed.  I wasn't even asked if I would like something else to replace my sandwich. I think I'd rather go to the restaurant at Valley Fair from now on.
Miguel R.,"San Jose, CA",9,58,2,5.0,8/28/2008,"I ALWAYS WANT TO COME HERE!! Urgh, the whole wheat bread with butter and sugar is heavenly and everything i've had here is always delicious. I love the burgers and the steaks kick ass.  The cheesecakes rock the house also, especially the chocolate cheesecake with raspberry topping. FUCK. I love it."
Kyleigh R.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,4.0,11/11/2014,"We come here every couple of weeks and we get good service especially from Fidel. He was very detail oriented with everything making sure we were happy and comfortable. We asked to be in his section again and he remembered all our orders from the previous time. The minus 1 star is for their take out. One experience we had in the curbside service was horrible. We order one slice of cheesecake and they told us it would be 10-15 minutes, which was fine because we had to drive there. I called in telling them I was there providing my name, car make and color. Then waited another 20 minutes till I finally went inside to find the take out staff just standing around doing nothing. I asked them how long the cheese cake had been done and they said about 20 minutes. Funny I had been waiting 20 minutes outside for you guys to come out. We probably wont rely on their curbside service ever again but their service at the table is great."
Mimi P.,"San Jose, CA",63,49,6,2.0,9/3/2009,"Had a late lunch here.  Service was par.  The waiter was nice, but the food came late.  We were all sharing entrees and appetizers, so it was nice to get our grande nachos and a bacon wedge salad.  We waited for the rest of the food to come, but no such luck.  The waiter tried to appease us with a cup of their new broccoli and cheese soup, but it was too herby.  I gave him an ""A"" for effort, but he should have focused more on getting our food to the table in a timely fashion.  Our buffalo wings finally arrived, but they were cold as ice.  Yuck!   We eventually received all our food, but we were full by the time it arrived, and felt disappointed when we left.  We had three goody boxes to go with our leftover food.  Could have been much better."
Cherryl D.,"San Jose, CA",362,645,188,3.0,3/6/2009,My Ratings: Quality of Food - 3 Stars  Quantity of Food - 3 Stars  Price - 4 Stars  Location - 2 Stars  Parking - 2 Stars  Service - 2 Stars  Speed - 2 Stars  My Opinion/Story: The San Jose location is ok.  I prefer the Valley Fair location because the place is bigger and service is better.  Service isn't so bad here but it seems as if some of the wait-staff can get pretty picky with whom they would like to serve.  I had one pretty bad experience where the wait-staff seems to ignore our table more than her other tables.  So I hope they got rid of her but I never went back to this location again.   The food is good as well but it's hard to enjoy your food when you're pissed at the service.  So I'd rather have better food and service at the other location.
Gilbert L.,"Scotts Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/8/2014,"I went for lunch to celebrate my son's 15th Birthday.  Unfortunately, the waiter was very unpleasant. He took forever to take our order and offer bread.  Went on his break without notifying us another server would take his place.  Food !""finally served by another waiter.  They came to sing Happy Birthday after bringing dessert, without any utensils.  My son was so tired of waiting he decided to eat his food like he was in a pie eating contest.  The waiter noticed he didn't have utensils and started laughing and telling other co-workers, ""Look, at that kid eating without utensil's!"" Immature servers. Notified the Manager Paul the following weekend to explain my situation and mentioned he felt so bad, that my son had to experience with servers laughing at him in the restaurant.  He mentioned he would mail gift card for the embarrassment. Don't take your children to celebrate their birthday unless you want to be laughed at and embarrassed by servers. Oh by the way we never received any gift card and that's probably a good thing. I would have just tossed it in the garbage can."
Tu N.,"San Jose, CA",41,46,5,3.0,6/10/2009,"Service: The guy was nice but when he switched with a woman... man, it was hard to look for her. Food: Steak Diane was alright, Habachi Steak was tasty, Da Vinci Code Pasta was a litlle tasteless..but still good. 30th Anniversary Cheesecake was alright, I still like the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake wayyyy betterrrrrrr."
Ashar C.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2013,I came in today and asked for a gift card with the promotion for my daughter's birthday.They lied and told me they don't have anymore gift cards. I called Steven Creek San Jose and they were honest and told me the promotion will end on 12/31 just exactly on the Cheesecake Factory website post. I thought all of the Cheesecake Factory were the same but I was wrong. I will never come back to this restaurant again. I am very disappointed.
Alejandra A.,"Los Gatos, CA",10,44,23,4.0,10/10/2008,"My husband and I really like going here.   We always get as an appetizer the Thai Lettuce Wraps they are so good and fresh that we just love this plate.  Our favorite thing here is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta it has crusted chicken cutlets over pasta with mushrooms, peppers and onion, Trust me  its really good and the plate is huge, even if you're going for lunch, I always take some home.  I ordered once the Chinese Chicken Salad but I did not like it at all, it was way too sweet."
YELP U.,"Eureka, CA",3,136,34,2.0,5/24/2013,"This restaurant has a pretty nice environment, but not for steak here.  Ordered to cook the steak rare, but came out be almost well done.  Plus the serer should remember who ordered what, so when plates arrive it won't be like a war zone to figure out which plate is who.  Also had a pina colada, but taste like just ice.  Overall I only like their rotisserie chicken from appetizer."
Drew B.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2013,Okay first of all the lady at the front looked like she was bored and treated her customers like she didn't care. Second she told us that the wait time was 5 minutes and then 15 minutes later still no buzz. Lastly we saw three guys who probably worked there just walk in and grab menus and seat themselves. Needless to say We walked out because we weren't about that life. Your food is good your service sucks.
Vik S.,"San Jose, CA",78,230,3,4.0,6/29/2008,"Lauau Salad today.......piled real vertical-like.    Starts off with some seseme ginger wontons that make up the base.  Crispy and sweet the wontons add the textural crunch you desire in a salad. Baby Greens, breast meat chicken and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink thrown in too for good measure, vegetable-wise.   I like the Sesame Ginger dressing .  So overall, Much better experience than my so-so steak last time I dined in.  4 Stars for the food."
Abby Q.,"San Jose, CA",806,353,2,1.0,9/13/2010,"to be quite frank, this place is not my ideal dining out spot. i was quite excited with my best friend took me here to try for the first time not too long ago. (i know... everyone's eaten here except me). she got this steak-like plate while i got the chicken pot stickers since i wasnt especially hungry that moment. HOWEVER, not being hungry does not hold responsibility towards my taste buds... and all i know is: EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR DINNER SUCKED! i forced the pot stickers down just because im paying for it, and my bff couldnt even finish.. it was that bad. although it was my first time there and i shouldn't be so bias from one bad experience, it'll be pretty hard to get me to come back and dine here. dry potstickers with super salty sauce, and a waiter who dropped utensils only to pick it up and walk away pretending to get new ones when she really just reused them. ew."
Joe M.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,2.0,8/7/2012,"The new chuck e cheese of the southbay.Walked in for lunch yesterday with my wife and besides the service being slow and getting our drinks right when the food came out the place was filled with kids and crying babys. Im so sick of rude people letting kids run down the isle and babys cry while they stuff there face, stay home!! We actually tried to go late to eat a couple of weeks before at around 9:00 pm and after walking by the 10 strollers in the back and seeing kids all over we left. Were done with this day care for lazy parents not worth the wait and trying to find a parking space."
Monica S.,"Morgan Hill, CA",85,116,16,2.0,3/31/2011,"Good atmosphere, but the entrees are not good. Every time I go I want to give it another chance, but always fails, its just not good. One thing I may go back are for appetizers and cheesecake only thing I liked.  Food also over priced for the quality."
jane c.,"San Jose, CA",0,88,13,3.0,11/21/2011,"The sweet potato fries were cold for the second time.  The original cheesecake did not compete to the old cheesecake place in Mt. View.  It is a loud and cavernous building.  Happy hr. at 5 dollar a glass of wine makes the bar a busy spot 4-8.  I like the salad wth the chinese dressing piled high on the low calorie menu.  It is enough for 2 meals.  The portions are huge.  The chicken in wine I would pass on too.  The desserts are tempting but in reality I am too full and truely they are just not all that.  I like the appetier menu and smaller spates, curbside pick up ."
Alexandra G.,"Milpitas, CA",73,216,136,4.0,11/24/2010,"I have not been to this place in so long and tonight I asked myself why? I was definitely not disappointed.  My boyfriend and I started off with their fried calamari it comes with this awesome cream sauce idk what it is but it was so good. Only flaw the calamari could be a bit more crispy. My boyfriend also had the potato soup, it is kind like a loaded bake potato soup, which was good but it was missing sour cream. My boyfriend got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was good but the sauce was a bit thin for my liking. I had their ceasar salad. I love their ceasar salad and i just get the smaller portion with no chicken and I have that as my meal because it is huge and trust me I am not exaggerating. The way they make their ceasar dressing is different from any other place I have it. It is super garlicy and that is what I love most about it. And then we finished off with the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was also good but was a bit too much too handle in one sitting so we took half home, just like with our entrees. Our server was so great, I did not get her name, but she is one of the few servers that treated me and boyfriend with actual customer service which we really do not get much because we are young and servers usually assume we won't tip. But she did very well. I have to go back soon."
Tran M.,"San Jose, CA",111,31,8,1.0,2/22/2010,"I've been going to The Cheesecake Factory  in Valley Fair for a long time and usually leave very satisfied with the food and service. Sunday night was my little cousin's birthday and he wanted to go there for their infamous cheesecakes.  Since this one is a bit closer to my house compared to the one in Valley Fair, I decided to check it out. It took about 40 minutes for us to be seated and we were told it would take half the time. They didn't even give me the device thingy so I kept coming back and forth asking if our table were ready. Once we were seated, drinks and bread were quickly served (That's what the 1/2 star is for, though the white bread were stale ). I told them it was my cousin's birthday so we're gonna get some cheesecake afterward. The first waiter seemed nice and clear (another 1/2 star) . Then the food came out and everything went bad from there. My cousin's pasta with alfredo sauce from the kid's menu was way overpriced ! $6.95 for a plate of bow-tie pasta with sauce and NOTHING else! Come on, I know they're kids but kids can eat meat too! Poor little cousin. She looked really disappointed so I had to give her some chicken from my plate.  My Chicken Marsala wasn't much better. The bow-tie pasta was undercooked, chicken was not well seasoned and the whole plate just taste sooo bland that I had to request extra sauce. So being an Asian woman who was unsatisfied with her food, I attacked other people's plates and nothing were good. All the foods tasted way way WAYYYY too sweet. My boyfriend's steak from Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combination were the smallest pieces of steak I've seen. hahaha They were cute but did not taste good!  the Pasta Da Vinci were again undercooked (chicken were okay). I remember them taste way better at the one in Valley Fair.. =( Then while we were eating, our server came over and said that some other guy (forgot his name) was gonna take over. Anyways, everyone seemed to stop eating after 15 minutes (cuz the food wasn't good) and just sat there for like 15 minutes. No one cared to come and check on us or clean up our plates.  I had to flag down a different waitress who happened to walked by! It took her 5 minutes to get our waiter and it took him another 5 minutes to bring out the dessert menu. He suggested what's good for dessert, told me to think and disappeared into thin air after cleaning up our plates for another 15 minutes. Are you for real? I got angry and again flag down another waitress to bring me my bill!! She brought out the bill and left. It came out to be $152.50, 18% tip already included! (We had 2 appetizers: fried calamari and crispy crab wonton, 4 adult-sized orders and 2 orders from the kids menu for the 3 kids to share!!). Tips were $21.25. Gosh, I wished I could take it off. Anyways, back to the problem! After I signed my bill, I waited, and waited and waited.... for SOMEBODY to come over and swipe my card  so I can just LEAVE the damn place! But noooooo!!! My wish was not granted!  So finally, I had to drag my lazy butt to the counter, threw the damn bill in their face (not literally) and told them I wanted to pay for the meal! Then I angrily walked back to my table, sat down, expecting at least an apology from someone. HELL NO! I expected too much!  Another 2-3 minutes passed by and our ""nice and attentive NOT"" waiter FINALLY came over and asked me what we want for dessert! Are you KIDDING ME? Dessert? NOW? OMFG!! I wanted to slap him in the face but the bf was there so I had to be lady-like and said ""I paid already"". The waiter was shocked to hear that!! -__- He was like ""uh okay! Let me get your card!""  No apologies were ever said! From the waiter, the guy at the counter or the manager! At least they still remember my cousin's birthday so when we were about to leave, they brought out a sundae (the smallest sundae I ever seen) and sang a happy birthday song.  But that did not make feel better. I will never ever come back to this place again! I'd rather waste more gas and go to the one in Valley Fair instead!"
