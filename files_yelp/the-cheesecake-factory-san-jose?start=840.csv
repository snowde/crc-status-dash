Nitesh C.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/14/2011,"Came here on a Monday, so it was pretty dead across. Nonetheless, great service and great food"
Frank W.,"San Jose, CA",0,29,,2.0,12/30/2013,The food was good but the service was poor. We were there for two hours for lunch and went through 3 servers thus the reason for being the for two hours. The atmosphere was loud. The décor was nice and we didn't have to wait long to be seated although we did have to ask for our check to leave.
Mary L.,"San Jose, CA",4,48,3,2.0,6/28/2011,"This was my first time here, and it will be my last. My dining companion wanted to go here. I have avoided this place because of the notorious wait and high fat and calorie count, but I was game to try it. The food was chain restaurant quality and I guess ok, but the truly crappy part of lunch was the service.  It was early and there were plenty of tables, but for some reason they sat us in the bar area right behind the bussing station. We got to hear servers bs with each other loudly.  Our food took a very very long time to arrive and our sever flat out disappeared after it was delivered. No one bussed our table, despite bussing staff noticing our empty plates, and no servers would look me in the eye when I tried to get their attention to help find our server. Finally got the check, and were ignored again by the hostess.  I would usually just write it off, but the experience was so bad, despite not being busy, I was really surprised. It seems like one of those family-friendly places, but whatever."
Charles O.,"Campbell, CA",2,88,,2.0,10/31/2011,"Meh. I've experienced better is right. The food is overpriced and the whole place is over rated. Super expensive, but its probably the only place in the mall that wont give you stomech problems."
Julia B.,"San Jose, CA",4,20,1,1.0,3/30/2010,"This was THE worst service I have ever seen at a ""corporate restaurant""!  I was there for lunch, and looking around the restaurant I only see maybe 5 other tables!! As I wait for 15 minutes for anyone to come greet me, I notice 4 servers huddled around the POS talking, giggling, texting and even reading a magazine! Finally when someone does come to take my order ( an iced tea and salad) it was almost like I was taking away from her gossip time! It took 5 more minutes for the iced tea and 20 more for the salad. I get half way thru my salad, no one has come to check on me, my iced tea is empty and once again all the servers are standing around the POS! REALLY GUYS!!! Do you think this is acceptable!?!  I was appalled to have this kind of experience at a corporate restaurant!"
Chrese D.,"San Jose, CA",7,84,,3.0,3/22/2009,"The service and the food is just mediocre..nothing great. However, I LOVE the cheesecakes...I would come back just to eat them."
James K.,"Sunnyvale, CA",40,540,7,4.0,4/12/2009,"It's interesting to read the poor reviews regarding service but having only been there once (yesterday), I can only go with what I experienced..I think it goes to show that the waitress can have an obvious impact on your dining experience --anyways, my g/f and I were going to watch a movie and do some much needed shopping but decided to get some food..I have never been to the Cheesecake Factory (I usually don't do chains)..but I figured why not try b/c I heard the food was at least okay --first, the menu is extensive..I felt a little overwhelmed but was able to narrow it down to the chicken sandwich (spicy buffalo style) with fries..my g/f opted for a chicken pita with avocado, lettuce etc with side salad --the portion sizes are huge if you didn't know that already...but they do offer smaller portions on their other menu, which is a good thing..I ate after my workout so I was hungry but it still was a lot of food --my spicy chicken sandwich was hot and ready to eat but the main knock was that it had literally no buffalo sauce..there were a few daps in the center of the chicken but that was it..I just don't understand why a cook would do something so novice like..nonetheless, I told the waitress and she gave me an extra side of sauce and it tasted much better --service wise, our waitress was pretty good..older asian girl who was quick, attentive and refilled my agua plenty times..I just think it's probably ""hit or miss"" with service and luckily we had decent service --can't tell you anything about the cheesecake/desserts though..food wise, tasted pretty good, our waitress was quick, full bar I believe and plenty of seating both indoor and out..just make sure you have your appetite on when coming here!"
Patrick S.,"San Jose, CA",258,71,1,3.0,3/1/2011,"I've never reviewed T.C.F. before this, despite having eaten here on many occasions. It's a decent restaurant, no doubt, but my experience last night was sub-par. My fiancee and I showed up at 9:15 and were escorted to our table within about 5 mins. Our server showed up, greeted us politely and was quite pleasant. He got us our drinks while we decided what to have for dinner. After a few minutes he came back and we had some questions about the menu, after answer those questions and during a quick sidebar with the Missus, the server walked off and without explanation and didn't return for another five minutes, which was a bit weird. The night resumed with pretty good service, but after we finished our meal, we waited for about 20 minutes for a bill. Our server had disappeared unexpectedly, and then a hostess (I assume since she was wearing all black clothing instead of all-white) picked up the slack, she was friendly and prompt with delivering/retrieving our bill/payment, she offered us dessert and was genuinely sweet. We had noticed at this point that she had taken over for the other tables in our vicinity as well and we can only assume our server had gone on break or left for the evening. Kudos to the hostess that picked up his slack."
Victoria Y.,"San Jose, CA",239,679,,4.0,11/24/2008,"Haha I've actually never had the cheesecake here but I frequent The Cheesecake Factory a lot. Went to my first one when I was 11 in Chi-town.  I def recommend coming for the happy hour. Perfect portions of yummy appetizers at amazing prices. I go for the spring rolls, chopped salad, and the fried calamari.  If you don't make it for the happy hour, order the jambalaya. Spicy goodness!"
Stephanie T.,"Glendale, AZ",119,260,42,3.0,11/18/2010,"Their food is just like any other place but extra expensive because it's 'fine dining'. I've been here a few times and the best thing I've ever eaten was the free bread. I think they have the best bread, but either than that, yuck. Their food can be extra salty and everything is baked. The servers are nice, but there's always a few that are rude. Their cheesecakes are a bit pricy but flavors are sometimes nothing special. I would come back, but I'm almost sure I won't enjoy anything except the bread. Parking is a hassle too since this restaurant is connected to Oakridge Mall."
Janet D.,"San Jose, CA",104,1216,1381,1.0,10/18/2010,overrated super lame that they have advertisements for other stores in the mall. and the food is meh-tastic.
Stacey M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,2.0,9/1/2013,"Had a large family gathering for my Dad's birthday tonight. They brought him a ""scoop of ice cream"" for his birthday.  The ""ice cream"" was just a squirt of whipped cream in a bowl, with chocolate sauce and a candle on top. He dug all the way to the bottom looking for the ice cream. Is this their idea of ice cream? Really Cheesecake Factory?"
Joanne E.,"San Jose, CA",770,536,148,3.0,11/20/2006,"I love coming into Cheesecake Factory and ordering from a menu the size of a children's book.  I mean honestly over 200 items crammed into a book where you also find ads from the local shopping area or mall that the restaurant is located in is absolutely fabulous... ""Ummm Hi I would like to order a Cosmopolitan, Grey Goose, and also this Jaguar JX12 in Silver please and after that can I also get this 2.5 ct princess cut platinum ring from De Beers.  That's all !!"" I mean WOW!!! Its a great way to shop...now if only that can come in a to go box a girl can be freaking happy!! WHAT I DISLIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE: The damn teeny boppers taking up the time of your server, when you know in your mind you will more than likely have larger bill due to all the drinks you'll need to order to make the young yelps and cries and laughter turn into mutter. BUT NO....The server pays more attention to a young group because there's a cute girl sitting in the group.... **Attention server**  She's probably still in high school!!! Another round of martini's please with a side of ""SHOOT ME NOW IF I DON'T GET MY DRINK!!"""
TT V.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,4,1.0,1/30/2011,"Took my 12th years old daughter here to eat for the first time.  She was excited and awe struck by the restaurant--nice decor and large crowd.  We ordered the fried calamari and filet mignon.  All was fine until she discovered a small piece of wire metal in the calamari.  It freaked her out and we just lost our appetites.  They didn't charge the calamari of course, but we just felt gross.   Probably not coming back soon."
Chad T.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/18/2013,Always have a fantastic experience at this location! Recently from Amir who is patient and friendly!
Cynthia L.,"San Jose, CA",4,6,,2.0,10/2/2011,"i just had cheesecake factory for the first time and i have to say my expectations were higher than they could deliver. The wait time was reasonable considering it was Saturday night and the food was good. Normally that alone would warrant a good review. HOWEVER I SPENT 15 MINUTES after sitting down waiting to get drinks. 15 minutes is too long for a couple of waters. our ""waiter"" who will not be named was almost trying not to please us it seems. the apps came out wrong but once they were re made it was perfect. i recomend the mac and cheese balls but the delicious food does not make up for the low quality service and customer care. VERY DISSAPOINTED!"
Sophia H.,"San Jose, CA",0,25,,4.0,6/9/2011,"I been to this location a couple of times, and it has not yet to disappoint me. That last time I went here was on Sunday for my mama's birthday. The mall will filled so we parked on the other side of Macy/ Sears There's always plenty of parking on that side; and its only an extra 1-2 minute walk to the mall entrance.  Maybe my family is lucky but we never have to wait to long, even on this crowed day we waited only about 10 minutes. Knock on wood! The food range from delicious to mediocre. But the majority of the meals I tried have been  delicious! Food I recommend: Thai Lettuce Wraps: like a chicken taco with butter-lettuce as the wraps,it comes with 3 different sauce and moist flavorful chicken. Factory Chopped Salad -is my go to salad here, everything about it is delicious! Miso Salmon: Yummy! My only complaint is I want more of it, this dish tends to disappear the quickest! Cause its that good! Mahi Mahi Mediterranean: We were hesitant to order it, and surprisingly it was good. This dish comes with a huge potion of mash-potatoes.  Hibachi Steak: nicely marinated, and cut in the strips and cooked the way you like it. This dish also comes with a large portion of mash-potatoes, my family usually substitute one of the mash-potatoes portion, cause two portions of it is way too much. Pass on the Garlic Noodles, average compare to everything else I tried. Cheese cakes love them all!  Overall the service range from average to great! *** Manager extremely kind, there was a coupon for every $30 you spend, you get a free slice of cheese cake. And we forgot to print it, But the manager let us get it anyways. 3 free slices of cheese cake! For just enjoying our meal.. great way to end the day!"
Tom T.,"Kingston, NY",3,41,,1.0,9/3/2007,"The service was good, the food not so. We arrived at 6pm and were seated promptly (surprise). I ordered the Hungarian Goulash. My friend warned me that it wasn't a 'huge' meal. It also didn't resemble goulash. It was overcooked meat in an unrecognizable brown sauce with gummy noodles. The others were not as disappointed in their meals as I was. When the time came I eagerly ordered the '6 carb cheescake'. I can't eat sugar so it's a treat for me to get a dessert I can eat. They were out. They offered to sell me a whole cheesecake, frozen.  I didn't want to buy a whole cheesecake without trying a slice, so I declined. The combination of poor food and horrible parking puts it on my 'don't go there unless forced' list."
Bear S.,"San Jose, CA",24,164,17,4.0,2/16/2007,Bad place for a diet. This place is so good but their portions are ginormous. I would recommend having the waiter put half the entree in a to go box before he even brings it to the table. Some of the best cheesecake around (besides mine of course). PS. I really do make an amazing cheesecake.
Mani S.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/1/2011,This branch was horrible. Went there on July 30th. The waitress had no clue what they were offering. They brought the food and there were no spoon or fork given to us until after 5 mins. That too we had to ask some other waiter who was walking by. They even missed some of the sauces when they brought the food. The food quality was also not good. You can't compare the Valley Fair branch and this. Try to avoid this place. Drive to the valley fair one and it will be worth the drive.
