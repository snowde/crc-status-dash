Erin O.,"Neighbors Southwest, Beaverton, OR",85,643,59,3.0,7/22/2006,"I find the menu overwhelming. It's a novel! I prefer restaurants that focus on a few really good things than restaurants that try to be everything to everyone. It's just a recipe to fail.  -I've had the BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP thai dish. Sometimes too spicy for me, but when not...it's got good flavors with the expected vegetables, curry, peanuts, etc over rice. -Several times I've ordered HERB CRUSTED FILET OF SALMON served over mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemony sauce. -The BEST thing on the menu is the AVOCADO EGGROLLS--light and flaky (not greasy or tightly wrapped like other ""eggrolls"") and filled with avocado and other goodies, served with a sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  My complaints? -No kiddie menu! They have 500 pages (yes, exaggerating) of menu items, yet no kid portions/prices and no coloring crayons to entertain the younger set -I hate the ""wait by the palm tree"" queue for seating people. You get a pager, sit and wait, then get called to a wall by a palm tree and wait more, then you get seated. -The menu items are expensive (for this type of restaurant) so even though my favorite thing is the avocado eggroll appetizer, it's really not affordable to then order an entree as well. Plus, portions are so huge, who can eat all that?   Lower the prices, portions, and offerings and it'd be a better place.  I've been to the Oakridge location as well as Valley Fair and one above Macys at Union Square. All the same."
Alan C.,"San Jose, CA",15,115,4,5.0,2/8/2010,"I was searching for a place to take my daughter for dinner and make it a special evening.  After visiting 3 or 4 restaurants and not getting much help to make it a special evening I met Joe at the Cheesecake Factory on Blossom Hill.  Joe made it happen, special service, table and parking of my car.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it was 12, thanks.  Kate, my daughter enjoyed herself and I thank you"
Eden Y.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/3/2013,"The waiting lobby is always crowded. Depending on the amount of people, there can be a huge wait for tables. I do recommend coming early for dinner at 5pm or lunch at 11:30am. All of the waiters are always wearing formal attire. They are very friendly but busy. You will be served fresh bread then left alone before choosing menu options. Although it may take some time for the waiter to come back, there is always bread refills if you need it. I should also add when ordering food, if you have a hard choice of picking food, ask the waiter if there are any recommendations that people certainly like ect. The food there was good and satisfying.  I also recommend people to try the cheesecakes. They are light  and creamy."
Nancy M.,"San Jose, CA",10,63,2,1.0,6/30/2008,"Cold, inexperienced, and food poisoning. That is what I got from Cheesecake Factory.  My food sucked balls.  I got the combo plate with steak and scampi and I literally got 3 half inch pieces of steak, a pound and a half of mashed potato and 3 small soggy shrimps. The food could have been edible if it came warm but I guess the waiters were too overwhelmed by ""all the fucking women"" there.  I then asked the guy about recommendations for cheesecake and he told me he NEVER TRIED ANY!   Who the hell works in a cheesecake place and not eat any.   Regardless I guess it didn't matter because both my hubby and I got food poisoning.  Yep... wont be going there ever again. I wrote the corporate office and we will see what they have to say. Additional note:  We need to stop supporting and eating at these convenient chain places.  Thank god for yelp!  Try something new you uncultured pigs.  lol!  hahahahaha!  j/k"
T L.,"San Jose, CA",71,12,,4.0,12/30/2010,Friendly and awesome servers are attentive to what you need. The thai pasta i ordered was pretty good. its all the mall parking is a bitch. Got seated after about  20 minutes so it wasn't so bad. They have a full bar which is great.
Johnny P.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,4.0,6/28/2010,"I had the Spicy Chipotle Pasta or whatever. 6/10, it could've been better. The red velvet cheesecake though, was ORGASMIC. 11/10"
Davidson H.,"San Jose, CA",31,108,1,2.0,6/5/2011,"Iv'e decided not to write so much in the reviews since the stars will speak for themselves. A couple of things about this location is that the cheese cake is sub par and not worth the price. The food all came at different times as well, not recommended."
Tho V.,"San Jose, CA",8,79,,3.0,12/10/2008,"Pros: good for casual dining Cons: typical food I used to love Cheesecake Factory in general until I figured out there were better restaurants out there. All and all, it's still an OK venue to hold a big group dinner if one does not mind the typicality of the food."
Anna D.,"Birmingham, AL",20,173,4,4.0,5/31/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is tremendous! The Flying Gorilla drink is great. It's like an alcoholic banana shake. Their fruit smoothies are excellent too. I usually order the stuffed chicken tortillas or a pasta. I must have tried every pasta dish at this restaurant. Their chicken piccata is one of the best I've had, and I recommend the chicken madeira too. The service is  usually good. My mom is an over-tipper. The smallest amount she has ever tipped a server at Cheesecake is $10 and that's for a party of 2."
Reina M.,"Sacramento, CA",120,321,32,3.0,5/19/2008,"THE MENU IS ASTRONOMICALLY GARGANTUAN!!!  we went for breakfast this past sunday and the breakfast menu itself was on page 16!!!  PAGE 16!!!!!!!!!!! breakfast was good, portions were big, and service was attentive, even given the fact that there were about 18 of us on a sunday morning. the bartender definitely did not understand the meaning of ""extra spicy"" tho, even though i gave him 3 chances with the 3 blood marys i ordered, each time adding an additional 2 ""extra""s to my order."
Brandon T.,"Portland, OR",157,400,348,3.0,7/8/2008,"Spicy Cajun Black Pepper Shrimp....Chicken and Biscuits....Bread...Water....Soda...... toooooo much fooood. I came here simply because I wanted cheesecake and I ended up being so full that I had to get a slice to go and now it will get minfridgerator burn and I will enjoy it less.... The service we got was decent, nothing to brag about but nothing to fret about either.....and the wait was only 5 minutes....guess I am lucky?"
Keith B.,"San Jose, CA",113,2,,4.0,3/10/2011,"I don't normally write reviews for places I go all the time, but I decided to write one for this cheesecake factory! I've been here quite a few times and the last time I went here recently the bread was my most favorite part of the meal. The atmosphere here is great. It is usually dimly lit like many higher end restaurants and it probably is a little more expensive than your average sit-down, but that's why you get better service and food. The prices are usually around 12-16$ per dish, but they do have cheaper dishes during lunch time around 10$. I always love getting the brown  sweet-ish tasting bread of which is still don't know the name! The waiters are always freindly enough to give me more than the usual amount when I ask for it too. I would say my favorite dishes from here are the Chicken Tacos and the Meatloaf. The meatloaf is always very juicy and the potatoes complement it perfectly along with the corn. As for the chicken tacos, they are always arranged nicely and again, the servers will give you a little bit of extra sides if you ask politely. The only thing I might criticize is the oiliness of a lot of their dishes. Sometimes you might leave with a slightly upset stomach, but that just might be because you ate too much too! Overall, always a good experience!"
Andrew Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,3.0,3/3/2009,"While their decor is somewhat cool and their menu is extensive, nothing here stand out. I have tried their pastas, pizzas, and sandwiches...all of which have been ordinary and forgetful. Yes, their cheesecakes are good, but are WAY overpriced.  I only eat here when my friends want to. I would never come to this place on my own."
M A.,"San Jose, CA",3,16,,3.0,6/7/2013,We like having dinner at Cheesecake Factory. The food is delicious. We wanted to try the one at Oakridge Mall on a Saturday night. We had to wait 30 min to be seated. It is a nice environment and the service is OK (it would be nice if there is more waitress on Saturdays). The food was good.
Abby F.,"San Jose, CA",26,82,31,1.0,2/6/2010,I fucking hate the Cheesecake Factory.  It is the emblem of everything that is wrong with this country.
Erin G.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/14/2013,This is the second time that I have been disappointed. The first : we asked for outdoor seating and the waitress said it was not available. A few minutes later we saw that others had requested outdoor seating and proceeded to sit outside. The second: we went there today and waited 20 minutes to be seated. After patiently waiting we were seated. We then proceeded to wait at our table for 20 minutes without any service not even a request for drink orders! We left the restaurant without ordering anything and complained to the manager. I am very disappointed. For the amount of people that were there and the quality of food I would have expected a lot better service. I will never eat at there again. It is a shame because it is so close to my house.
Jessica B.,"San Jose, CA",117,62,,4.0,1/4/2008,"I've had pretty pleasant experiences here.  The ambiance is nice...the booths are nice and big so that you don't feel claustrophobic like some places however some of their tables are real small and you feel very confined. The food is decent...i think its a bit overpriced, but it does have huge proportions which are enough to share with someone or to take it to go. The cheesecake is great...it should be if that's what they're known for.   Great place for large groups and you rarely have to wait more than and hour."
Nikki C.,"Sacramento, CA",103,212,9,4.0,5/23/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I come here and leave happy all the time. The menu is huge, and I always try to try something new... And I've never been disapointed!  I love the chicken madiera, and the big five pizza, and the four cheese pasta.  We recently discovered the Buffalo Blasts on the appetizer menu, and they are amazing.  I'm addicted!  We also tried the whole appetizer sampler platter the last time we were these, and the sweet corn cakes are soo good, as are the quesadillas.  We got a bunch of fruity drinks, and were very satisfied with these as well.  They have banana daquiris!!  I LOVE banana daquiris!! :) Service is always really great.  Only once out of the dozens of times I've been here have we had less than perfect service..  We got a cold appetizer and didn't eat much of it, but no one ever came to check on us between the delivery of the appetizer and the delivery of our dinner.  When our dinner was delivered, we said that the appetizer was cold, and the server got our waitress, who apologized profusely for not helping sooner, comped the appetizer, and was on the ball the rest of the night. They are always crowded, and you have to wait forever to be seated, but for some reason, it never matters after you start eating. I'm going to keep coming back here, because I always discover new and delicious things on the menu.  I think you could come everyday for a year and never get the same thing."
Rana A.,"San Francisco, CA",89,400,175,4.0,10/15/2007,"It's a chain, but it's a great one.  Massive menu and the best martini ever (Well Maintained Dirty Martini). If you don't want to wait, go there on a Sunday night around 8:30pm. No wait at all. Shout out to Kelly, one of the friendliest waitresses there!!!"
