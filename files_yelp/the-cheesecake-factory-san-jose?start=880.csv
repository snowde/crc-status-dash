Quanghuy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,75,14,4.0,8/26/2008,"I just went here last month after the circus.  For appetizers, my date and I had the fried calamari which was really good; the dip was nicely seasoned and the breading was just right so there wasn't really any excess oil.  For our main course, I had the combination platter of the steak diane (I got mine dirty...""dirty dianaaaa nooooooooo"") and the herb breaded salmon and my date had the Jamaican shrimp dish.  The mash potatoes was delicious and the steak was marinated nicely.  The salmon was decent although I've had better. All in all, the food was good and I would definitely take my date back here again in the future."
Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,456,13,3.0,8/13/2007,"The first time I didn't have to wait for a table at a Cheesecake (gone to about 6 in CA).  We were there at 2pm.  Oh. A couple of us split a pasta entree while the others got regular portions.  We concluded that the lunch portion was plenty to share. Disappointed by the lemonade - too sweet, but they didn't have regular iced tea.  The sugar made us pass on dessert, and that was the reason for the restaurant choice in the first place. Still, we got decent table service at the local mall, and the extensive menu pleased the picky family members."
Cindy S.,"San Francisco, CA",201,129,293,3.0,5/3/2010,"The cheesecake factory here is very large and well-decorated. It looks similar to the one in San Francisco, but has it's own touch to it. I really enjoyed going in during happy hour (even though I don't drink) because the lunch menu was so cheap. It's like everything you wanted from the main menu, but in smaller portions - just enough to fill you up without having to lug around leftovers. It's great! Definitely try the chicken quesadilla."
Jeff V.,"San Jose, CA",9,34,4,4.0,4/21/2007,Took my parents out for dinner the other day. I had the fish & chips. Good stuff.  Forgot to leave room for desert this visit. Oh well.
Cynthia K.,"San Jose, CA",412,127,9,3.0,8/7/2008,"food is good, only one problem , I hate waiting for over an hour to sit. Not really their fault that so many people like them... it's just that I am a bitchy hungry person... Other than that I like 'em!!! Much better a t lunch time."
Lola P.,"San Jose, CA",21,10,2,1.0,3/14/2012,"Is not a surprise that you have to be patient and not have a full empty stomach if you're planning to have dinner at this place, but really...!!!! Last Saturday my boyfriend and I went to this location to have dinner I choose this location, because the Stevens Creek location is always packed, well our waiting time to be sit wasn't that long, but our waiting time to have our beverages, appetizers and dinner at the table was around 30 min. for beverages, and 50 min. for dinner...... cooome on...!!! Our server was really friendly but forgetful, the whole time I just think she forgot we were there, we asked for alcohol beverages and water it took at least 25 min to have or glass of wine and beer and 30 min to have 2 glass of water, then our appetizer never arrived until the server came back and she was apologizing about our steak taking so long so she offered some appetizer I was like reeeeeally...? you never took our order right since the beginning, because we asked for appetizer right away, well appetizers finally arrived around 40-50 min. since our arrival and 5 min. later our dinner arrived.... I was ready to leave by then...... this is the WORST SERVICE EVER...!!!!!!"
Todd P.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,4.0,4/7/2013,"Diverse menu.  Super generous portions.  Never had a bad meal here.  Generally, the service is great, but we have had a few instances where service was slow.  Try the Mai Tai---its great."
Christina P.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/27/2011,My husband and I came here for dinner tonight and it was your typical Friday night crowd. Once we were seated our waiter Christopher took very good care of us. Well we have our order in and we wait and wait and wait. Then the manager Joe came over and apologized for the wait and then our food would be coming soon. Well our food came and mine was wrong so they took it back. While all this was going on they were very accommodating and very kind about about all of the mix ups. We really appreciated that they were doing their best. We love the food and would totally come back.
Thomas W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,56,11,2.0,8/10/2007,"This place is overrated in my opinion. The acoustics are so poorly designed that when it is full it sounds like everyone is shouting from all the echos. Also, is it just me or is it really dark in there? I had to use my cellphone to see the menu when I was sitting deeper in the restaurant. The food was good, but there was way too much! It's like they are catering to whales or something. Not to mention the cost. Probably won't be going back."
Angie C.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,5.0,1/11/2011,I always love the service here. It's way better than the one at valley fair. The loaves that are given here are more fresh and just better. I would totally recommend coming here than the one at valley fair (:
Roxie R.,"Cupertino, CA",0,13,,4.0,12/6/2010,"I surprised this location didn't get a higher rating.  The food is the predictable Cheesecake factory experience, but the staff seems even more professional and helpful than any other location.  Like most Cheesecake Factory locations, this place is always hopping.  Regardless, the staff remains unflappable and always polite.  Kudos to the Manager who sets the tone.  This is a great place all around destination for good eats."
Carrie F.,"San Mateo, CA",54,116,10,3.0,1/19/2008,"Since this location is in my neighborhood, I've been a few times. Most evenings, this place is really packed and it can take anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes to get a seat. Since I usually go as part of a pair, we get seated in those really awkward two-tops that has a bench seat and a normal chair. I hate how close you end up sitting to the table next to you. Regardless, the service here has been pretty good. There was only one time where the service was excruciatingly slow (it took about an hour to get our food). We talked to the waiter and manager, and managed to at least get some free cheesecake out of the deal. Additionally, the food here has been pretty good. However, I recommend AGAINST getting the Pasta Di Vinci. It was extremely disappointing with nearly no chicken in the dish. Overall, it's a great restaurant if you're in the neighborhood, don't mind a potential wait for seating, and interested in ordering more food than the average person can eat in a typical meal."
Rachel R.,"Cool, CA",372,1059,12,3.0,1/16/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory offers a ridiculously huge menu that's fun for people who haven't eaten there before.  The dishes are also large, so sharing is great idea.  An appetiser can easily be your entire meal.  The wait here is comperable to the other Oakridge eateries.  Vegan Report:  The Cheesecake Factory has surprisingly few options.  Besides the bruschetta, I love the Chinese Chicken Salad without the chicken (or for a more reasonably priced and sized salad, I get the Traditional Tossed Green Salad wtih the Chinese plum dressing and I ask them to add rice noodles).  They have several good pastas and the veggie burger without cheese is decent.  I also always ask about the soup of the day in the off chance it is vegan.  Note that their Asian Stir Fry isn't vegetarian, because it has fish sauce in it."
Jaclyn N.,"Cupertino, CA",8,43,10,4.0,5/19/2012,"cheesecake at 10 pm sounded amazing so we decided to pay a visit. desserts at the cheesecake factory are alawys on point, but tonight the service made this a 4 star experience. jessica was attentive, friendly, and funny! had red velvet cheesecake which was creamy and not overly sweet... their tea selection was great too. cant wait to visit again tomorrow for dinner!!!"
Lauren H.,"San Francisco, CA",32,235,9,3.0,6/19/2006,"As much as I want to bash the place, I can't. I was there last night with some less-than-adventurous friends, and we had a really nice dinner. Service was good and we were seated right away. The drinks are really expensive, but they are good. My wine was served in surprisingly good stemware, better than 90% of the restaurants out there. My eggplant sandwich was acceptable, and the salad hit the spot. The three of us split a piece of cheesecake, and although I am totally over Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, I still managed to eat my third and enjoy it. If I have to pick a place in the Oakridge Mall to eat, I'll always pick Cheesecake Factory."
Keren M.,"San Jose, CA",22,73,28,2.0,8/25/2010,"the cheesecake on steven's creek is always great. so why not go to  another branch if we're in the area? it was bad. kid's chicken strips were bland and dry. my spicy chicken salad was tasteless and the rice was undercooked and no flavor at all.  the ahi carpazzio wasnt cut thin enough (but tasted good). the steak was nice .  the service was slow, the food wasnt good   i will not go back there."
Debra P.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,,2.0,11/3/2010,"The place is very nice, clean and comfortable but the food leaves much to be desired. My soup was warm and should have been hot and it tasted yucky so I left it. I had a sandwich which had hard bread - just not good. I will not go back."
Audrey N.,"San Jose, CA",273,300,110,4.0,1/25/2010,"I've never had a negative experience eating here. in fact, I love dining here. Their food makes up for the service at times. I loveee the louisiana chicken pasta, and their chicken madeira. I've also tried several other dishes since I've been eating here for years, but those are the two I highly recommend. Their smoothies are good as well. The tropical one and the frozen iced mango. As for their desserts, I loveed their tres leches cheesecake, unfortunately it's been discontinued. Bring it back! Anyhow, their new red velvet cheesecake is delicious! I don't think I'll ever stop eatting here =)"
Amy C.,"Alameda, CA",51,440,2,2.0,2/16/2006,"I don't particularly like this place. Its namesake, cheesecake, is kind of airy and too sweet. Charlie's Cheesecake Works does SO much better.   The menu's huge, but it doesn't seem like they do any one dish all too well. Spread too thin, I guess. But what they lack in quality they make up in quantity - the plates are humongous. Too expensive, but otherwise an okay place to fill up on food."
Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",135,651,469,4.0,3/14/2006,"This is also one of the better Cheesecakes.  The bonus is that this one is accessible from both the parking lot and the mall.  It is large and well-suited for big parties.  I have generally had good food experiences here, although I have on occassion noticed sometimes it's not salty *enough*.  Weird!  Times visited: 5+"
