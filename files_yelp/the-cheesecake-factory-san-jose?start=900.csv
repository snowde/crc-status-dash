Vu T.,"Milpitas, CA",36,121,,4.0,6/25/2006,"It was a late night, but luckily we made it before midnight.  I needed to get my dessert fix before ending the night.  My friend and I found our way here. I couldn't decide between something fruity or something chocolatey.  Since we are both fans of chocolate, my friend got the Black-Out Cake, and I got the Godiva Chocolate Cheescake.  Ooooooohhhh Myyyy!  Each bite was so delicious, and the portions were quite large.  I hammered my cheescake with no problem.  I probably could've finished off her cake as well.   The time of night that we went was good.  There was no wait at all, but it was a little chilly.  Boo for that, since my friend had to put her sweater on.  Hahahaha.  Really though, the 4 stars is just because the price is a little steep for dessert.  I never asked to get portions that were made for lumberjacks."
tatiana l.,"San Jose, CA",42,35,,5.0,6/7/2011,"My friend and I met for a quick lunch, however our conversation went on and on... Everyone around was very patient and accommodating with us. Good food, nice service. We've asked for outside sitting and it was arranged instantly. always ready to go back!"
Lilly G.,"San Jose, CA",128,5,1,5.0,1/19/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is another one of my favorite restauants.  I usually park in the parking lot in front of the restaurants.  People say they dont like parking there because it is always full, but I always get lucky and find parking, I guess.  Whenever I come here, I always get the fried calamari.  It is so delicious!  For dinner I usually get the Miso Salmon sub Mashed Potatoes.  Their mashed potatoes are sooo goood.  We went on a Wednesday night and we had a part of 10 and there was no wait, and my whole party wasnt even all there yet, but they sat us right away.  The last time I went, I got the Meatloaf!  Ever since I have been craving it since!  The servers are usually really nice.  We did actually have a bad experience there once, but the food is so good I still give them a 5.  We ate here for a friend's birthday dinner, and we brought our own cake.  We asked for plates and once we got the bill, we saw a fee of  50 cents charged for each plate they gave us.  I understand that they charge, but they could have told us before hand!"
Christy C.,"San Jose, CA",7,26,,4.0,3/4/2008,"Normally, I find chain restaurants bland and unremarkable, but I was just here for lunch yesterday, and it was great, all around. Our waitress was full of genuine personality and spunk, and her trainee was also very warm and personable. They checked on us often, but not too often. I like sitting in those booths that are made for six people. Typically, I have a hard time making up my mind, so even though their book of a menu has an abbreviated lunch section, it took a while for me to get through it. In the end, I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was surprisingly really tasty. The chicken cutlets were thin and crispy, the farfalle was cooked perfectly, and the spicy sauce was yummy. My co-worker had the fish and chips, which was just enormous. A little pricey, but a nice place to go to every once in a while."
Kivani R.,"San Jose, CA",66,126,13,4.0,1/24/2012,im a sucker for the buffalo blast and the avocado rolls are so damn tasty. and not to mention that you can get these fine delicacies for only 5 green backs during happy hour. legit!!
SK L.,"San Jose, CA",0,79,,4.0,9/17/2012,Great service and great food.  Sometimes waiting for a table on the weekend is crazy though.
Regina L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,46,,2.0,1/3/2007,"Food is ok, though they give you WAY too much for one person. When the media talks about the lack of portion control this place is the first I think about. And their cheesecakes are really rich, although one slice does have about 500-800 calories without whipped cream. Though the reason I don't go here isn't the food, it's the lighting. I cannot read anything on the menu, it's so dark. If you raise the lighting a bit more or actually used the lights above the tables, it'd be a better dining experience. But after ordering using the light of a cell phone and not being able to see most of the food at all, I'd rather go for better food and better ambiance. Makes me wonder what they're trying to hide with the dim lights."
Stephanie L.,"San Jose, CA",52,9,2,4.0,5/7/2010,Almost always happy with the food here.  It's very consistent and fresh.  You get huge portions so watch your waistline or take some of your meals home.  Also for the health concious they have a great weight management selection with some great salads
Veronica L.,"San Jose, CA",206,274,402,3.0,12/25/2009,"I'm being very generous by giving this particular location 3 stars and that is because I really enjoyed the food. However, the service my friend Becca & I received on Friday night was downright crappy. We got seated right away which was good, but our waitress was definitely not on top of it. It took her a long time to get our order. When we ordered drinks, she forgot my friend's wine not once, but twice. We had to ask her about it, then when she came back to our table she said she had forgotten about it. Instead of getting the wine after that, she attends to the table next to us. We were there first and why is it that she got all of their stuff in a very timely manner? I could understand that it's the holidays, but it wasn't even busy when we were there. The food we got was really good though, so I am happy about that. I couldn't finish everything-as everyone knows, they serve big portions. When I got my food boxed, I had asked if I could have more buffalo wing sauce since I only had a tiny bit left and a lot of food leftover. She said sure but when I ate my leftovers later at home, she didn't even give me more sauce. Instead, she poured the few drops (less than what I had) into a small plastic container. Pathetic! I should have checked my food before leaving. No bueno. :/ Next time I have a craving for The Cheesecake Factory, I will go to the one at Valley Fair or to my favorite one in the city. Forget this location."
Sophia L.,"Sacramento, CA",36,36,20,1.0,8/21/2011,Their fried calamari was DISGUSTING and I've had my fair share with fried calamari's.
Jackie R.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,1,,3.0,10/2/2012,"Really liked this place a few years ago. Recently went and their food was not as delicious as it previously was. Their service really needs to be improved. They brought the meals out at different times, part of the enjoyment of dining out is eating together, not having one party in the group finish their meal before another party even receives their meal."
Robby W.,"San Jose, CA",126,35,,3.0,6/16/2011,"3 Stars = A-OK according to yelp and that is just what I think.  It's pretty much hit or miss.  I went there 3 times in the last 2 weeks. 2 weeks ago 4.5 Stars- Waitress was amazing if I knew her name I'd share it. They were incredibly busy with Graduation Parties even at 9:45pm but you wouldn't know it based on her attentive service. Food was great too! Last week 4 Stars- Sat in bar, not too private, lots of noise.  Just had dessert and it was good.   Saturday 1 Star /  First order was from Specials menu- breaded chicken on top of pasta tossed with an aoili or baisil oil then w pancetta and arugula.  it is usually delecious but there was soooo much oil it was un edible.  I didn't really eat it.  Another young waitress took my friends ice tea to never return.  Waiter never really checked back to see if everything was ok, he was too busy getting his end of shift things done.  When he did come back he asked me what was wrong and I told him.  He tried to convince me that was how it was.  He did offer me another item so I ordered a light angel hair pasta tossed with fresh basil and mozzerella in a LIGHT TOMATO sauce.  Once again that lovely oil was smothered in my dish.  I didn't eat it and was done.  The waiter said hed get the manager.  When the female manager arrived she slumped agains the booth, smiled and said you asked for a manager, how can I help.   Like I said its hit or miss."
Jennifer L.,"Mooresville, NC",23,48,36,2.0,2/6/2007,"They get zero stars for service. They get one star for good food/large portions. They get 1/2 star for neat ambiance. They get 1/2 star for good drinks. They get zero stars for design of their restuarant. With the exception of ONE instance, I have always had very poor service at Cheesecake factory.  The hosts/hostesses are always rude.  The restaurant is not designed for good line of sight to your waiter/ress, and the waiter/ress has the same problem with not being able to meet thier tables needs due to ill line of sight.  The design is cute and fancy and all, but makes for a tough time serving well - and they always seem to be serving tables ALL over the restaurant, making it even more difficult to focus on all of thier customers.   The food is usually very good, and in large portions.  They may be pricey, but the portions pretty much make up for that.  A $12 meal at Cheesecake can easily be made into two meals. Verdict: Order ahead of time and get your food - and don't forget a cheesecake - to go.  Only dine in if you have time to spare and want to try one of thier yummy, fancy drinks."
SF N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/13/2009,"The food gets 3 stars.....okay but not great. But I gave them only 1 star because the floor was dangerously slippery and when everyone that worked there saw all the customers complain and walked very slowly they just joked around about it. It is very dangerous....sooner or later they are going to get sued.  The service was not very good....checked on us once in the beginning and that was it. The waitress forgot to give us steak knives, 4got to give us change, and the silverware was dirty...crusty tomato sauce of the forks."
Cristina C.,"San Jose, CA",1,25,,4.0,5/2/2012,"I recommend ordering your cheesecake first, after you eat you'll be too full for dessert! and the dessert here is the best part...what can you say this place lives up to its name ""The Cheesecake Factory"" Food is good but nothing special, you can find pretty much everything and another restaurant. Cocktails are overpriced. Service is good."
Carlos A.,"Fremont, CA",0,46,,1.0,1/6/2012,"I have been at this Cheesecake Factory twice now and I am not immpressed at all. The prices are way too high for what I got. This last time I ordered the fish tacos that were the worst tacos I have ever had. The fish was almost non-existant and the tortillas were cold, hard and dry. The bean and rice were just as bad. The only time I will consider coming back is just for a slice of cheesecake & coffee."
Jack E.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/19/2012,"This place is gross, the service is always off and the food is terrible. Too bad, usually Cheesecake Factory is pretty good!"
Roni L.,"South San Francisco, CA",10,335,4,3.0,7/22/2009,"Me wonders why a restaurant chain this big can't come up with a reasonable kids menu... Don't try to find parking on Restaurant Row... it's f'n unbelievable, as is the $6 valet parking scam... but that's Westfield's fault, not TCF's, so I won't let that affect their rating. We got here ~6:30-ish... no wait.  Server was quite nice and friendly.  Prices didn't seem outrageous...  we decided on the appetizer dinner.  I have no complaints, everything looked and tasted great. Then it came to dessert- you don't come to TCF without having cheesecake...  we ordered, but it almost took longer for the cheesecake to come as it took for the food itself.  How hard is it to grab 2 pieces of pre-sliced cheesecake, put it on a plate and blow cool-whip around it. Otherwise it was okay... Clean, interesting mediterranean decor.  Although they need to clear the entrance area... waiting patrons sort of just milled all around the cheesecake counter and it was a PITA to get past them to leave."
Tom M.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,4.0,12/21/2009,"You can rarely go wrong with anything you order at thus place. Only complaint is that servings are always too big. Can't believe I'm saying that. Still though, you always have to order the cheesecake, can't go wrong there either. I've got a theory about naming a restaurant: if you name it after a dessert, you compel your diners to order one after their meals. Smart trick."
R S.,"San Jose, CA",3,47,,4.0,8/2/2009,"I had recently gone here with a friend and we had a great experience. We sat at the bar had appetizers and drinks and the bart tender was very attentive with both our drink and food needs.  The calamari was great, we then got an grilled artichoke, it wasn't so much to our taste and the bartender noticed right away and let us pick another dish and did not charge us for the artichoke. Overall the food, service and atmosphere was great. I'd recommend this location with confidence."
