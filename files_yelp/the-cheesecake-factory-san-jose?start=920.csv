Ashley M.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/5/2012,the only reason i go it for the chocolate bread and the chipotle pasta. Great place to go out and have lunch or dinner. It does get pack but its worth the wait.
Cathy D.,"San Jose, CA",117,71,3,3.0,3/12/2009,"Never never ever ever go here on a weekend...Weekend = thurs - sun...you'll almost never find a parking space, unless you pay them the 5 bucks to valet your car...and c'mon, lets be real, this isnt a 5 star restaurant, so you shouldnt have to valet your car...and if you are lucky enough to find parking, well then, ur just lucky.... This place is always freakin crazy packed, like, 1 hour and 45 min waits...wth, its not the only restaurant in the mall? The only reason why i come here is cuz their chicken picatta is the bomb...and its the only thing i ever order from there since ive discovered it...i have tried alot of the other things on there such as the meatloaf (HUGE PORTION), who doesnt love meatloaf right? and they give u ur money's worth, but i can make meatloaf just as good at home...Ive also had the miso salmon...dont order it, it comes in the so called miso sauce but its like overly sweet...so hard to eat... The chicken farfalle is pretty good, has this garlicky flavor to it, and u know me, love that garlic! They have alot of good appetizers here, so i come for that too...if the fire roasted artichokes are in season, that is a must for me, and my hubby always orders the fire cracker salmon rolls which are pretty bomb....they only give you like 4 pieces which i think is a lil shady, but they lay it on a pile of cabbage so i just eat that too...their beef carpaccio is good as well, i just hate how they dont ever let me order it togo...health food reasons....whatever i already hate eating in there... If youre like me and would rather to order togo, they'll either bring the food out to your car, or you could park in the pick up parking area and run in...pretty convenient...and ask them for the brown bread...YUMMY!"
Lien T.,"San Jose, CA",226,169,20,4.0,4/10/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is considered to be a more finer dining experience. It's very dim in the restaurants and sets the mood. This place is pretty big and always busy. I've came here many of times, and always had a good experience. all the workers are always very friendly and service is super fast. I heard that they just added happy hour to their menu, so i'm hoping to try that out real soon. It's a great place to eat if you have a large party because their menu is ridiculously huge.  My favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the new orleans chicken pasta. The miso salmon is always cooked to perfection. The salmon breaks perfectly and just melts like butter in your mouth. The new orleans chicken pasta is very flavorful yet not too overwhelming, which i love. The chicken batter is so crispy and tender. I can never decide which to get, because they're both soo good. i usually make the bf get one and ill get the other so i can eat off his plate =] their portions are very big as well, i always take home more then half of my plate. I usually try to save room for dessert but for some reason i can never do that here, because of their large portions!"
Scott B.,"Gilroy, CA",0,21,,2.0,11/19/2011,"Two stars because recent experiences have shown the restaurant chain to be cutting back on food quality, quantity, and plain out being cheap.  Prices on menu's ahve not been adjusted accordingly so this place is now over-priced with average to below average food quality.  It's a shame because we used to love coming here to get good food, great portions, and reasonable prices."
Liquidman ..,"San Jose, CA",12,51,,4.0,4/21/2009,"I have to try a burger where ever I go.  I can't help it, I'm on a mission to find the best. So I ordered the ""Tons of Fun"" burger and I have to say it was one of the best ever...HUGE...tasty, cooked just right and that's unusual these days. Haven't tried the cheesecake because I don't want to hurl chunks after that mammoth burger but maybe someday.  This place also has a full bar that has a cool feel to it with great bartenders."
Audrey M.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,4.0,11/12/2009,"Get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta - I always get that! It is delicious, big dish, and they give you plenty of chicken. Don't get this dish if you have high cholesterol - hehe. But I always get this every time I go to Cheesecake with my husband, there is always left overs for following day which I am anxious to chump away at! Only downside, they are it is very expensive there and I don't like any of the appetizers."
Melissa T.,"San Jose, CA",5,38,9,3.0,5/22/2009,"Every time I come here to eat it's always an off and on experience. Either I get an excellent server or a far from spectacular one. Food is average but they're great for sharing (huge portions). The drinks are on the pricey side so watch out for that. I recommend sitting in the bar area. Self-seating, quick and attentive service, quicker getting food. You're in and then you're out."
David C.,"San Jose, CA",28,59,63,3.0,10/14/2010,this place is ok i just really love there pie's...dam those sweet's
Mike d.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/11/2011,Called in an order at 930 pm and was told it would be ready in 20-25 min..  Order was ready as promised and with a friendly greeting.  Food was very good and even the off duty employees were pleasant to be with.
Christopher Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/1/2011,I can seriously eat the dulche de leche cheesecake every day for the rest of my life..it really is a mind-blowing experience!

Julia H.,"San Jose, CA",2,12,,1.0,7/16/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes may be good, but their service sure sucks. Each time I have gone there (several times since I live close by), I've had horrible service. (OK, once I had good service but that's because I came in around 10 pm and ordered cheesecake, and that's it.) One evening, my sister and I decided to drop in for a quick bite to eat. It's conveniently attached to the mall, so you can go shopping and then have dinner. Our waiter was oblivious. He was trying to multitask by speaking the table next to us and pouring water into my glass. Epic Fail. He missed the glass completely and poured water all over my pants, and didn't realize it for a few seconds.  Another time, we came here for my friends birthday. I had to leave early (I have a child, so getting out is difficult), and I told our waitress the circumstance. I ordered the lettuce wraps (it consists of lettuce, cold vegetables, and tiny strips of chicken that take 6 minutes to grill, if that). I asked her to bring mine out right away since I was leaving soon. ONE HOUR LATER, my order comes out. I shove the food down my throat and leave, not without telling the manager my problem (she has no clue what she is doing either).  There have been several other times when my food has taken an hour to come out. This isn't Morton's steakhouse for crying out loud. It's Cheesecake factory. How long does it take to cook pasta or make a burger? The only reason I go there, is because friends want to go there (for whatever reason....). Otherwise, I would avoid this place like the plague and hike over to California Pizza Kitcen or BJ's"
stephanie n.,"San Jose, CA",36,71,7,3.0,1/28/2010,"Whenever me and my friends can't find a place to eat we always resort back to the cheesecake factory. I love their mash potatoes! Also I order fries with their honey mustard. I only order the fries because their honey mustard is one of the best. For our main dish we always get the pasta da vinci, with extra sauce. It is probably one of the best dishes there, but sometimes its a hit or miss, the pasta a bit stale sometimes. Their service is ""usually"" good. For their cheesecake, You'll probably get tired of it after 4 bites so I usually share it with a friend or two."
Matt K.,"San Jose, CA",39,366,13,3.0,2/7/2011,"I love the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad at Cheesecake Factory (I know, I know...not the healthiest salad but whatever)! My only complaints about this location at Oakridge is that parking is sometimes a biatch! Otherwise, food is typical Cheesecake Factory. Service is ok, definitely slow at times if they are busy, but overall ok. I would come back again...especially for the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad =)"
Ty L.,"San Jose, CA",4,27,,4.0,6/18/2009,"I just went here yesterday and it was not disappointing at all. The server was very kind and always check up on us and the food was good. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms which were yummy and the cheese triangle was also good. This place looks pricey but it is pretty decent prices. We spent less than an hour to order, wait for food, eat, and pay."
Joseph V.,"San Jose, CA",50,150,52,4.0,12/23/2008,"We came here tonight and didn't have to wait.  Whoa...thats a first because this place is generally packed.  As the host lead us to our seats, I had asked him if we could have a booth instead of open seating (no walls, next to other patrons) and he was very accommodating.  After a few minutes we sat at our booth.  Our server Skyler was very polite, and attentive to us.  After our order, he quickly gave us fresh baked bread and butter.  Very good stuff.   We ordered the Luau Salad (mixed greens, green beans, fried wonton wrapper with honey sesame on chicken with balsamic dressing).  This was enough to share with 2 people.  This salad is the best tasting salad they have.  The dressing is not overpowering, and the fried wonton creates an excellent sweet flavor to the salad.  We also ordered the Salisbury Steak with fries and green beans.  The chopped meat was flavored in salt and pepper topped with grilled buttered onions.  The steak was moist and juicy cooked well.  I wish there was more gravy sauce over the steak though.   Oh I almost forgot, we sipped on the tropical martini and the pineapple mojito.  The tropical martini was consistent to what I had here before, but the pineapple mojito was a bit too sweet and lacked liquor.  It was almost like drinking an icee.   Overall this place deserves 4 stars because of the service, food, environment, and cleanliness."
Ocee D.,"Denver, CO",571,1201,2657,1.0,5/8/2008,"I really used to like this place, but my last three experiences at this location (and a few at palo alto) earned the one star, and that's only because the servers are usually really nice.   Experience 1 - my gf wasn't feeling too good so I ordered her a BOWL of soup...yes, i said BOWL, that's the BIG portion at TCF, and we all know about their portions.  When I got home, the one container was 1/2 way full.  I called and spoke with the girl that gave it to me and she said, ""yea, for a bowl, we use 3 scoops""....sorry little girl, for a bowl, you fill up two goddamn containers, now I know! Experience 2 - I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta dish and she ordered the chicken littles.  Waiter told her that she could sub her side with ""CREAMED spinach"".  Food came out and no creamed spinach, just sauted.  Told the server, and she said, ""oh, we don't have that"".  ""then why did you say you did?"", ""the kitchen doesn't even know how to make that, if you want to tell us how, i'll see if they can do it"".....""that's not gonna work, can she have fries instead?"".... a few minutes later, as we were waiting for her fries, we started to eat and as she tasted my food, I saw her pull something out of her mouth.  it was A GODDAM PIECE OF PLASTIC!!! WTF?!!!  If that was someone's kid, they could've choked on that!  Fries came out, I told the server (who was nice although she smelled like so much smoke I felt like I caught lung cancer from her) that I think it's time for me to speak with the manager.  When she went to get him, I tried the fries that she JUST brought out and they were cold!  Manager came, obviously embarrassed.  ""I'm so sorry, I heard what happened""....""yea, I think we're ready to leave"" I explained the spinach, plastic bag, and fries problems and he said, ""can I at least explain where the plastic bag came from"".....""I don't really care where it came from, I think we're ready to leave""......""can I at least make you something to take with you""....""With all that's happened so far, I don't think it'll get any better, and we don't really feel comfortable (or safe) eating here"".....""ok, I won't charge you for your meals"".....""of course you won't, cuz that wouldn't make sense"".  He actually did handle it really well and after refusing his offer of a gift card, we left. Experience 3 - It had been a few months and I was craving a damn burger, so we decided to give them another chance.  Waited 45 minutes to be seated.  We ordered clam chowder and TexMex Eggrolls.  Clam chowder was fine, but the eggrolls were cold.  probably because theywere sitting there for 1/2 hour while after we ordered (total time so far 1 1/2 hours).  about 20 minutes later, my Well done Kobe Burger came, but her Ahi Carpachio didn't.  So We waited....and waited.....and waited.   The waiter (who was very good at his job) noticed I was getting really annoyed, so he brought the manager without me asking.  Manager apologized and I asked him why a RAW dish is taking longer than a WELL DONE dish?  he said that if we wait a little longer it'll be there.  ""WE'VE BEEN HERE 2 HOURS ALREADY!!""......""i apologize, and I promise i'll make it up to you"".  Fish came out a few minutes later (total time 1 hour 55 minutes).  They comp'd desert, but that wasn't enough to make up for them dropping the ball.   Staff is good here, management is good, kitchen needs a suprise visit from the health inspector to get them back on track and paying attention, and their procedures need an internal audit with some better organization.  Won't be back"
Adriana G.,"Oakland, CA",78,220,27,3.0,5/16/2010,"They are pretty consistent as other Cheesecake Factory's in terms of decor, food and service. However, I was quite pleased that we only had to wait 20  minutes for a table during peak dinner time. They sat us along the booths near the bar. I was completely fascinated by the mirrors that ran above the booths. It allowed you to keep up with conversation and eye contact while watching the TVs at the bar! Well done designers! It's a win-win for all parties b/c you are either looking at the monitors from the mirrors or the TVs directly if you are on the other side of the table. I'm not a huge sports fan but I couldn't help myself and found that I was keeping up with the baseball scores. I could tell it was starting to annoy my friend. I can only imagine the issues this could potentially cause for some couples. As far as the food: it was just OK and after a few bites of the fresh banana cheesecake I know I won't order it again."
Nicole K.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/20/2011,"Their bread at the beginning is wonderful, people are friendly. My friends like to flirt with the waiters there, it's pretty hilarious to watch. Anyways, most of the menu I've tried is pretty good except the nachos. Eww."
m. m.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,23,,4.0,3/3/2011,"food is real good, service always friendly, roomy booths, large portions, family atmosphere."
