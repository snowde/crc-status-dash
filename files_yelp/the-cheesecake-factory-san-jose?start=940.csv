Hannah T.,"San Jose, CA",7,59,,3.0,9/22/2007,"Foodwise everything I've had here has been pretty decent. Particularly the steak diane, pasta divinchi, chicken madera, and the free bread is REALLY good. What's the worst I've had here is the crab cakes. Ugh they're horrendous! They're smaller than kiwis, cost like 13 bucks, and are so bad I couldn't even finish them. I even tried to stuff in it the bread to gulf it down and that still didnt' work. Ugh..."
Brother A.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,1.0,6/26/2011,"What crap.  I spent 13 bucks on their crappy Cobb Salad.  It was filled with that cheap thinly sliced taco lettuce and had a grand total of 4 chicken squares... wtf is this crap.  95% lettuce, 5% cobb, 100% bullshit."

Tony S.,"San Jose, CA",7,38,1,3.0,1/2/2011,"To big for their own good. Does anyone remember when there was just one Cheesecake factory in San Francisco above Macy's that took pride on amazing customer service? Well, sadly as the franchise expanded they lost their touch. Here is my story: Went to Cheesecake Factory with the Misses for a romantic dinner with friends on new year's eve. Told 30 minute wait and given a beeper, ended up waiting an hour. It's cool it's new years eve. Standing room only waiting for the beeper to go off, but good company made up for it. Seated and was promptly take care of by an amazing server, ""Rod"". Then ""Rod"" went on break leaving ""Steve"" in charge of our table. Our food arrived and one of the people in our party wanted soy sauce and didn't get it. Our drinks ran dry. Where was Steve? Steve was no where to be seen? Steve? Steve was in ""his"" section on the other side of the restaurant. Finally, 15 minutes past and everyone had pretty much finished our did ""Steve"" show up. Water came. Soy sauce came, but Management shouldn't have left our table in the care of someone that already had another area and was too busy to take care of us. Food was amazing. ""Rod"" when there did an amazing job! ""Steve"" took it down from a 4 star experience down to a 3. I do highly recommend Cheesecake factory, just no on a major night during the holidays or on the weekends."
Liz A.,"Watsonville, CA",5,109,,4.0,1/13/2008,"I am going to go out on a limb and try not to sound like an alcoholic, but their Red Raspberry Martinis are outstanding and I pretty much get one (or sometimes more when I am not driving) every time I go.  I've been to this location several times now and I have yet to have anything on the menu that is mediocre.  Everything I've ordered has been outstanding.  When they are busy, it is often a long wait and their service suffers.  If you don't mind shelling out some dough, it is a great place to eat."
Marylou A.,"San Jose, CA",260,80,2,4.0,9/5/2008,"Great ambiance, attentive and customer-focused staff, and tasty cheese cakes!  Yeah, nothing extraordinary about their food but the portions are plentiful.  We like their Fried Mac and Cheese & Fried Calamari appetizers, and entrees Crusted Chicken Romano and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta."
Carly M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",28,186,,4.0,8/17/2007,"I've had a few good experiences at this location. I find that this location is generally slower than Valley Fair so I've never had to wait for a table. Maybe since it's slower they tend to focus more on service. I went here yesterday because I had had a dream about the pasta bolognese. This is a true statement. I could literally taste the sauce when I woke up. Since I knew I was going to lunch with my sister and niece, I was stoked when they suggested going to CCF.  We had a plesant time and everything was done in a timely fashion. I was happy with my pasta and (no big surprise here) had plenty of left overs which I happily ate for lunch this afternoon. Will definitely go back when my dreams steer me that way."
M S.,"San Jose, CA",0,36,,3.0,3/25/2011,Decent food but GREAT cheesecake. Staff is friendly and has good service most of the time. Drinks are a little expensive but other than that pretty good place.
Mookie K.,"San Jose, CA",12,30,,3.0,9/5/2008,"I am not sure what the hype is about The Cheesecake Factory.  The food is OK, the portions are way too large, the service is also OK.  This location is decent sized.   There are definitely better places to eat, say the Buca di Beppo a short walk down the mall."
S V.,"San Jose, CA",0,42,11,2.0,12/17/2010,"The food is as good as any other cheese cake factory, the cheese cake is excellent. But my low rating is due to the customer service. A group of 20 of us had made reservation. When we arrived, they claimed that we never made a reservation. When we said we spoke to Kevin, the manager Kevin told us he doesn't have any recollection of our reservation while the Kevin we spoke to us to come 15 mins early. I understand people make mistakes, but manager Kevin was not at all courteous and acted as if we made a grave mistake and we should be thankful that we got a seat to sit and eat. Our server was excellent. Just the manager Kevin and his attitude ended it for us. We used to go to this place for group lunch all the time, and they just lost out groups patronage and they don't care."
E G.,"San Jose, CA",38,94,1,4.0,2/13/2008,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory... how you do me wrong with fattening yumminess, but it always feels so right. I like coming here to meet up with friends for dinner. It's got a nice atmosphere, although it always seems to be pretty noisy no matter what time of day it is. I always find the waiters to be friendly and attentive. I've never had to wait long for a refill or any other request. For drinks I get the Red Raspberry Martini. Delicious! As for the food, I usually start off with the Avocado Eggrolls. The dipping sauce really brings it together. I've found through trial and error that my favorite dish is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. I just love the stuff the chicken is crusted in! I also like their mashed potatoes. And for cheesecake, my favorite is the Tiramisu. Yum! All in all, 4 stars because even though I love the food, it's always so noisy that I feel like I need to shout across the table."
Kristen K.,"San Jose, CA",126,63,49,4.0,8/15/2006,"I go here for the food, not the cheesecake.  The cheesecake is too sweet for my taste.  I'd rather have strawberry shortcake or tiramisu, or just a goblet of strawberries with whipped cream (the real thing, not the stuff out of a can, and not overly sweet).  Everything I've had has been really good.  I usually get one of the many chicken dishes (chicken piccata, Louisiana chicken pasta, chicken and biscuits, chicken Costoletta), I've also had shrimp, fish, shepherd's pie, Chinese chicken salad. They also have the best strawberry lemonade.  I try to avoid it elsewhere because it will be a disappointment.  I have a friend who I know would give it 5 stars.  He says it's the most favorite restaurant anywhere.  I really like it too, but it's not my most favorite restaurant.  It's always crowded, though I find the Oakridge location a bit less crowded than at Valley Fair."
Angie L.,"San Jose, CA",90,77,,3.0,3/18/2012,"I'm not really a fan of big chain restaurants that serve up thousand calorie gluttonous platters of food; however, I was quite excited to give this place a try after hearing all of the rave reviews from regulars. I've ordered several cheesecakes from here throughout the years for birthdays, but finally came by for dinner with my husband and daughter. The service was excellent, surprisingly so, on a Saturday night that was super busy. The waitress, who was very friendly and attentive, immediately came to our table with water, bread, coloring stuff, and a little fruit & bread plate for our daughter. We ordered a couple cocktails, the ahi carpaccio, crab cakes, chicken madeira, and hibachi steak. The ahi carpaccio was outstanding...I could eat several plates of that in one sitting. Although the portions were huge (we had a lot of food to take home), everything else tasted pretty mediocre. I'd come back again only for the ahi appetizer, drinks, and cheesecake."
orland c.,"Cupertino, CA",0,22,,3.0,10/21/2010,"I come here usually once every week since its close enough to my house and the gym. Service is always very good, you will be treated with warm smiles and very welcoming staff, I totally have no complians there. Food is just ok, nothing great but not bad either. I wouldn't call it a special place but it is quite convenient with a LOT of options. I dont typically get their dessert as I know they are all very fattening but they have lunch size portions which will already fill you up. They expanded their menu with small bites which allow you try try different things without over ordering which is good. My favorites are the Santa Fe and Luaua Salad, Renee's Special, and their Honey Oats bread which comes free!"
Lila J.,"San Jose, CA",69,180,,4.0,10/1/2007,"I love The Cheesecake Factory!  My favorites:  Chicken Piccata, Cajun Chicken Littles, and the Firecracker Salmon Rolls (appetizer).  Honestly, I have never tried any other dishes.  This is sad considering I have been here many, many times.  You have to get their ranch to dip your Cajun Chicken Littles in... it's the best sauce ever!!!  My favorite cheesecakes would have to be original, banana cream, white chocolate raspberry, and cookie dough.  Not all at once. Minus 1 star because I hate that this location is in the mall and the parking sucks here!"
Haily W.,"Beaverton, OR",79,308,45,3.0,1/28/2007,"So I decided to take my boyfriend out to lunch here today since I have never been and he seemed to really like it, along with tons of either people I've talked to. Sorry, but I have to say it does NOT live up to the hype. I was extremely dissapoint in our food. Minus one star for bland quesdilla, minus one for bland salsa, minus one for brown avcados and minus two for awfully greasy pizza that didn't taste like anything. The grease was literally pooled on the pizza and I had to take my napkin and soak it off. Unless you like your pizza that greasy, I'm sorry but thats just nasty. Plus one star for a great server who came back many times to check on us and was very friendly, fast and efficent. Plus two stars for Linda's Fudge Cake. TO DIE FOR!!!!"
Meera G.,"San Jose, CA",55,36,398,1.0,1/13/2008,"It was a party of 15........The gratuity was a sure thing and all was not right.   Two people in my party had ordered the teriyaki chicken that was dry, burnt and cold.  How does that manage to happen?   So everyone got their meals and then the other 2 did when the rest of us had finished.  Then we get the bill.....that had 4 charges for the teriyaki chicken and then 2 that were comped.  So I ask the waitress why we were charged for 4 meals when we had ordered 2 and they had to be sent back?  She said that usually happens and that is was normal. What?  So the manager took care of the situation, but it shouldn't have even happened.  Just another way to make a buck. Thanks. I won't be back soon."
Kat D.,"San Jose, CA",4,35,1,2.0,5/18/2009,"I just don't like it. I think it has to do with the redunculous wait time and all the servers I've ever had were sub par at best. BUT the food is usually pretty good, except my friend ordered plain butter noodles and chicken breast (she got like three or four pieces of chicken). They remade it for her, but they acted like they were going out their way for her. At any rate, the atmosphere is fun and the food is good, but any place I need to wait two hours to get seated and another 20 to get my drinks is too long for a porker like me."
YAMMY C.,"San Jose, CA",28,136,12,3.0,4/11/2006,"Their menu is a great collection of hits and misses. The hamburgers (they cook it the way you want) and fry bread sandwich really delicious . The bad would be the caesar salad (dressing way too salty and harsh) and the nachos (cools too quickly). Portions are huge. Desserts are yummy. For a busy restaurant, I have not had service I didn't like and it's nice to know they are open late.   Weekends suck for a table. Typical for that area. Great place for the finicky and not so daring."
