Mary K.,"San Jose, CA",1,14,2,4.0,9/30/2010,cool place... food is good... parking might be an issue
sud p.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,4.0,9/12/2008,Great service and food. Since this place is does not take reservations on weekends might have to wait during the peak time.
Alex S.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,36,1,4.0,2/13/2008,"The best selection of every type of food! Everyone in a group or even just the family, will be satisfied when you go out here. But go to the one at Valley Fair much faster better service."
Coco V.,"Monterey, CA",1,16,,2.0,9/9/2010,"Met my dad and his friend here for lunch. The most impressive thing about this place was the attitude of the staff. The bartender, the host and our server were all outstandingly friendly and accommodating. The food was not so impressive. My chicken tostada salad was a huge double mound of shredded lettuce over two stale shells. I had to play needle in a haystack to find the three small bites of chicken. Basically boring & flavorless. All that dry romaine would make a rabbit very happy, but it left me feeling hungry for another entree. My dad reported his chicken picatta was so-so, and the third in our party enjoyed every bite of his orange chicken with white rice. For dessert I opted for the plain & simple cheesecake - quite good, although still a bit frozen in the center. The strawberry shortcake, well, simply fell short. Gazing around the enormous neo-classic-ish, kinda-wanna-be-Frenchie decor...I reflected on the menu for a few moments and  thought to myself, hmm......exactly what IS the CONCEPT here?"
Tyler C.,"San Jose, CA",11,19,,2.0,1/23/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory is an upscale Olive Garden masquerading as a ""date"" restaurant.  The food is decent, the cheesecake is yummy, but the staff is sorely overextended.  Also, for some reason, every time I'm there I feel like it must be prom night.  So if you accidentally find yourself at the mall, starving, and the food court just won't cut it, jump into the factory assembly line and get fed."
Will G.,"San Jose, CA",2,116,,4.0,7/17/2006,"The food is quite decent, bit pricy but huge portions. The service is good and waitress are friendly. This place is not as packed as the others. It's also a good place to have cheesecake or desert fix at night."
Sophie Y.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,33,2,4.0,10/18/2006,"i hate the wait during dinnner hours, but i guess it's worth it. i love the pastas here!!!  i usually get the fettucine alfredo with chicken or the pesto pasta... yummmmmyy!!! it's great place to share food with friends, but not exactly a romantic place... more for larger groups, as the restaurant gets pretty noisy."
Tran T.,"San Jose, CA",0,26,,4.0,5/12/2007,"Anytime I ordered a fish plate, I was very satisfy.  The best thing on the menu are the SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS, FRIED CALAMARI and ENDIVE, PECAN and BLUE CHEESE.  The Steak Diane is a sure thing. The pasta dishes are quite unpredictable. Sometimes good, sometimes very bland no matter how much cheese or salt you add into it.      Dinner is a very, very long wait. They don't take call in nor reservation. So, if you want dinner without the wait, try take-out. Call and order on the phone. The waiter actually will bring the food out to your car if you call them and let them know where you park. You won't have to leave your car.  You by-pass the wait for service inside."
jason p.,"San Jose, CA",1,1,,1.0,1/23/2010,Not kid friendly at all.  No crayons or kids toys given or available.  The cups for kids are regular size plastic cups with lid and straw but like you would give to an adult.  Food was horible for the most part and especially bad considering the high price.  Cheesecake Factory use to be good but I will not eat in one of these places again.
Su T.,"San Jose, CA",0,64,1,3.0,6/27/2008,"This place has very mixed feelings and reviews. Of course i can't speak for all of them, however i'm pleasantly impressed by their broad choices of dishes and intimate enviornment. the restaurant is dimly lit inside so it helps keep you and your company more focused around the table. the dishes are a bit pricey, so if pricing is an issue for you you may want to reconsider. other than that i'd have to say you do get what you pay for, and out of the ...well i've lost count, but out of all the times i've been to cheesecake, i've never been disappointed. may i consider you trying the salmon, the halibut, beef ribs, thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer for you health nerds out there, the fettuccine alfredo with sundried tomatoes is a favorite and of course the filet mignon is a good one. the dishes are very big so don't fill yourself up too much on the bread, i've always had to take my food to go cuz i was just too full. also whats great is drink refills are free, so enjoy that as much as you can."
Barb B.,"San Jose, CA",134,619,30,4.0,11/25/2006,"So, I'm on this Jenny Craig diet to loose a few pounds childbirth (blame the kids who are teens now), workplace candy bowls (they Force me to eat it), and middle age (gasp!) has saddled me with. Now, my son comes home from Marine boot camp and announces he wants to eat out EVERY NIGHT until he goes back and has this list of restaurants to go to, Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge being one of them. Ok. I get the award for the most easy-going, well-rounded mom in the world (no pun intended).So, we go.  Now, I know I wrote a not-too-sterling review of the Valley Fair location because, well, basically it sucked. I have to say, if you are going to eat here, do not consume any other food for a whole 24 hours before hand. The menu has ""ads"" (I kid you not) and is the size of Glen Ellen's phone book. I get a little confused with so many choices...must be my age and the diet food. But, I finally settled on an appetizer of corn cakes with a salsa on it and it was delicious! My son had fish and chips and I still can't believe he ate the whole thing as well as an oreo cheesecake chocolate dessert. I had one bite of that dessert and gained 5 pounds on the spot. The service was pretty good too. They loose some points for the garish decor (like some midwest stencil queen you see on access tv  gone wild) and the ads in the menu. Food was great even the second time we went there in the two weeks he was home! And, now that my son is back in training, I am fasting like its Lent."
Jason H.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/31/2010,"Today was my first time going to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Oakridge and will be my lastttt timee.  The food was not only bad but also this Cheesecake Factory have a the worst and crappy service of all the restaurant that I went to eat at.  My waiter was rude and stupiddd.  I went here with two of my friends.  First, he brought the bread and butter out.  The bread was hard/dry and the butter was coldd so I asked him to bring out the new bread.  The idiottt brought out the bread that was burn and I complained to him then he said that it wasn't his fault.  The idiot  is so stupid that he couldn't even see that the bread was burn in the back.  Also, I ordered a California Cheesesteak sandwich and it was cold... The cheese on the sandwich was cold and the meat wasn't even hot..  I hope whoever is the manager for this Cheesecake Factory should train the waiter/waitress/hostess to provide good customer service and also, he/she wants to rethink about hiring a new chef...  The food sucks so bad that I couldn't even finish 1/4 of the platee.  I hope that whoever receive this message learn how to manage this restaurant because words travel about the reputation of this restaurant.."
Tawnie D.,"San Jose, CA",1,7,3,1.0,1/31/2010,"Cheesecake Factory to me is beginning to get worse every time i come back... I went to this location yesterday for my little sisters birthday... I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Calamari... The calamari portion was ridiculously small... I was so surprised... The pasta was big portion but it was plain... Not much flavor to it... my husband ordered the house ranch burger and the only thing i saw him eating was the french fries with the garlic sauce... The burger looked like they just threw cheese onion and mushroom together and mixed it together while grilling and put it on the burger... not tasty looking at all...  he ate a couple bites of his burger but couldn't take it anymore i guess... my sister ordered the dish they were known for, the Jambalaya pasta... she did not like it at ALL... there was no taste to it no flavor when you look on top it looks so good but once you lift the bottom of the pasta up it was just basically boiled pasta under there i told her to mix it up but even after mixing it the pasta still had no flavor... i would say the best thing of the night was our server... he was nice and talkative... but then when we asked him to bring a cheesecake saying happy birthday JACKIE on it... he brings over a cake that says happy birthday ERICA.... not a big deal for us... but just not something the birthday girl was happy about... this dinner reminded us of why we havent been to cheesecake factory for so long"
Simon C.,"San Jose, CA",0,86,,4.0,12/31/2008,"Watch out when you order fish, it is sometimes raw.  Not a place for diet.  Otherwise the food is fairly good.  Long wait.  We have always enjoyed having dinner here.  They have great cheese cake (frozen) that you could take home.  Except for a problem with rude waitress down in Disneyland, I always come back here."
Ana O.,"San Jose, CA",12,3,5,4.0,8/25/2009,"We were a party of 5 (me, hubby, 2 kids, and grandma) who wanted a nice dinner to thank grandma for babysitting the kids for the weekend.  Anyone who knows Oakridge Mall knows that parking can be a problem on weekends during dinner time.  So I decided to get out of the car to put our name on the waiting list while hubby hunted for parking.  I was nicely greeted by a friendly hostess who added my name to the waiting list.  Turned out the wait was only 5 minutes!  I let them know my husband was still looking for parking and they said it was no problem and to let them know when we're ready.  Parking was horrendous!  It took 15 minutes before my husband found parking.  We all came in and were seated right away.  We got to sit in one of their very nice large booths (seats 6).  Our waitress greeted us right away and was very nice.  The noise level was fine by me (my noisy 2 year old blended in without being noticed) and the atmosphere was pleasant and lively.  We've been to Cheesecake Factory before so I was familiar with the menu.  My daughter got the pepperoni pizza (I wish they had a kids' menu for more choices), hubby got the Steak Diane & Scampi combo, grandma got the Grilled Chicken Medallions, and I got the Chicken Madeira & Salmon combo.  Everything was delicious!  We even ordered the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake for dessert.  It was decadent!  One complaint is that the entree portions seem to be smaller than before.  We've been eating at this restaurant for a few years now and in the last year I've noticed the portions getting smaller.  So I'm giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars due to smaller portion size, lack of a kids' menu and difficult parking.  Other than that I'm still recommending them."
