Katrina F.,"Union City, CA",0,19,8,5.0,1/8/2018,"Our server Allison was AMAZING! She is super sweet & very accommodating.  I love the bread here & she even gave me more bread so I can take some home. We asked a bunch of questions about the menu & she was honest about which dishes she liked or which weren't that great. We were also her last table but we didn't feel rushed or anything.  ALSO! My friend thought one of the servers were cute & she was like ""I could talk to him for you!"" She's a server & cupid haha!  She made the experience so awesome. She has a very happy & friendly personality, very easy to talk to."
Arleen L.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Was here for dinner on a Monday night with a party of 11.  Had to wait an hour as CCF does not takereservations. For appetizers, we ordered some zucchini sticks n fried calamari. When people began to munch on the calamari we realized some pieces were actually fried chicken. We brought it to the waitress' attention and she just chuckled and said ""You got both. Don't know what the cooks are doing"" and off she went.  As dinner plates were being served, the waitress informed J there was no bread for her avocado toast so she needed to order something else. No bread?? Really??? ‍‍It gets worse. After everyone else aside from J got there orders placed in front of them, H was informed by the waitress that his fish tacos were made wrong  as they were beef so she chose not to bring it over. Poor H had to watch us all eat while his tacos were being made. Waitress did not apologize or offer to comp the tacos or offer at slice of cheesecake.  Sorry to say the CCF has gone down in quality and service. I will not be returning again."
Kristina K.,"Fremont, CA",36,10,2,4.0,1/2/2018,"Either a restaurant stands out for how good they are, or how opposite of good they are. And for that, they deserve recognition.  In this case, as much as I love the decor and ambiance of Cheesecake, my favorite thing here is their carrot cake.  In my recent culinary adventures I have been picking up a lot of take out lately, and visiting numerous restaurants on the peninsula.  The last time I was in Cheesecake picking up a take out order I double checked to make sure I had everything and left the store. As I was getting ready to pull out, the employee who was helping me suddenly appeared tapping on my window startling me and holding up a bag in his hands. It was my fries! Now that's what I call service and going above and beyond the call of duty! I asked his name and he told me it's Neil. Neil is awesome and truly exemplifies the meaning of hospitality in every way shape and form. I also told him inside at the counter that no matter how old a woman gets she still likes being called Miss as opposed to Ma'am and he began calling me Miss and corrected himself everytime he almost said Ma'am.  It's people like him that make me want to go back to cheesecake and explore the menu until I find something I love on the menu. Outstanding service and warm hospitality sometimes mean more than the food itself and even make it taste better.  Neil deserves a promotion and would make a great Manager with his natural warmth and genuine care he clearly exhibits. Winner!"
Tiffany L.,"Burlingame, CA",107,112,415,4.0,12/9/2017,"I came here with my family on a Sunday evening and we all enjoyed our dinner. Service was friendly enough but extremely slow. It took around 25 min to get seated, 30 min to get our food, and another 15 minutes to order and receive our cheesecake. Luckily we had plenty of freshly baked sourdough and wheat bread to tide us over. I absolutely love their honey wheat brown bread - it's sweet, crusty, and hearty.  Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu, and there are a decent number of vegetarian options. I've always enjoyed their veggie burger - the housemade patty is a well-seasoned blend of grains and veggies. This time I wanted to try something different and went with the super antioxidant salad. The toppings were all delicious, especially the roasted broccoli, but they really skimped out. I received a giant bowl of salad greens with very few toppings, which is unacceptable for the price ($11.49). Perhaps I'll have better luck trying out one of their vegetarian pasta dishes next time. Let's be honest though, I totally came to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake and not the entrees. In particular I've been waiting to try the Celebration Cheesecake and it did not disappoint!! It had so many different layers: funfetti cake, cheesecake, strawberry/chocolate/vanilla mousse, and cream cheese frosting. It reminded me of Baked Alaska but even more decadent. I'm a sucker for anything funfetti, so the Celebration Cheesecake easily became my favorite. Some of my other go-to cheesecakes are: fresh strawberry, fresh banana cream, and tiramisu."
Aviad B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,3,5.0,1/10/2018,I cannot speak for others but the cheesecake factory in San Mateo in the mall was great it is a decent sized restaurant feels very clean the restrooms where very clean stuff and waiters are very polite always keep asking if we need their assistance food is delicious like any cheesecake factory  They definitely will receive my five stars thank you guys and keep up the great work
Amy D.,"Fremont, CA",473,2306,5370,4.0,11/4/2017,"Although I didn't love all the new dishes I tried this time around, I'm staying with a 4 star rating since the food here is solid, and service was surprisingly good this time around. Apparently, coming for lunch on a Thursday around noon is the best time, since there was no wait and not crazy busy. We were seated right away, and I tried: -Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): This is still a great appetizer, and the flavors are really good. The cauliflower was also nice and crispy- highly recommended! -Dynamite Shrimp (Crispy Tempura Shrimp w/Spicy Dynamite Sauce, $7.95,  ): Not that great- the batter on the shrimp was too thick, and the dynamite sauce wasn't spicy and didn't have much flavor. Skip! -Crispy Chicken Costoletta (Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded & Sauteed to a Crisp Golden Brown, Served w/Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes, Fresh Asparagus, $17.95,  ): Just ok- they give you a giant plate of chicken (3 pieces) and mound of mashed potatoes, but the sauce was really bland. There was a nice crisp on the chicken, and that was pretty flavorful. However, the mashed potatoes could have also used additional flavor. I probably wouldn't get this dish again. -Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake ( ): Way too sweet, and the walnuts were weird in here. I also didn't like the combination of flavors with the cookie dough and cheesecake- skip! Our server was actually competent this time around, and our food came out quickly, which was great! I will definitely be back to The Cheesecake Factory."
Mercedes M.,"San Mateo, CA",6,34,98,4.0,12/23/2017,"I really enjoy dining here. The food is pretty creative and tasty. Have you ever had parmesan chicken shaped like a pizza and topped with angel hair pasta? It's actually really good! Must try! They've recently improved their cocktail menu too so more reason to hangout here with friends! Service has always been nice and fast, despite them being always busy. I never see this restaurant slow. So be prepared to wait in line."
Sarika S.,"San Jose, CA",126,358,98,4.0,10/17/2017,"Though this is one of the smallest of their restaurants I have been to, it's overall the same consistent food I expect.  I met up with some friends to have apps/dinner here. Since it was early, we opted to do happy hour but there was only 4 tables and a few seats at the bar. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table to clear. Our waiter was nice and friendly, even let us know a few min before HH was ending so we could place more of an order, but we didn't need anything else.  Like I said above, food is usually consistent. One thing, this place had a few tables on the mall part of the area lobby, not outside. I've seem in at one other place in southern CA. But it's weird because people are waiting there too so I'm sure they are staring at you."
Yoyo L.,"San Mateo, CA",45,79,296,4.0,7/15/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is never a wrong choice for either lunch or dinner, especially Dessert! Except you have to be patient to wait in line. My husband and I went there for a Friday date night, but unfortunately 45mins wait time just way too long around 6:30pm. We had to buy some snacks before getting our table, otherwise we probably starved to death, lol.  So we finally get seated, and immediately ordered our food. Signature burger with whole wheat bread. And my favorite pasta with fried chicken on the top. The service was nice and fast! Didn't wait long for our food! After we finished everything, we were just too full to order dessert, haha.  Red velvet has always been my favorite. Just saying.  Hope next time we can come earlier so we don't have to wait too long!"
Theresa M.,"San Carlos, CA",4,106,116,5.0,12/10/2017,"What does 49ers Jimmy G have in common with Anthony's Boubon Radioactive?  Fast, speedy and a winner!  CF typically great like all Cheesecake Factory throughout SoCal (San Diego) to Norcal (Sacramento and Bay Area).  But this particular Bay Area CF other than the usual hefty serving of indulgence good enough for a football team (to be fair there is also a Skinny menu) they have Anthony the Bartender who hikes up some unbelievable drinks. Today he made ""Bourbon Radioactive"" (privy to actually have the opportunity to name this particular drink) and it was good, no, very good, no absolutely hands down good!!!  Fast.  Speedy.  Winner.  Been awhile since returning here to watch his plays because there's always been a scrimmage (people lining up to sit at the bar so they can be served by Anthony).  The high tops are usually what's left and basically you remain in the sidelines.  No Anthony too.  But today, like a Hail Mary...scored!  Showdown went like this:  It was already late in the quarter but got seats at the bar, defense was good, first down!  Fought way through and gained more yards after ordering food (always a variety and consistent)  ie., nachos, chicken sliders, spicy nugget, pot stickers, salads are yumsters, pasta, and carnevors will not be disappointed.  Also had Sundae for dessert and also available are what seems like endless cheesecake choices, second down!  Then here comes Anthony and hikes up his creation ""Bourbon Radioactive"" and Receiver does his thing and passes for a touchdown!!! Like all the buzz about Jimmy G's back to back victory, Anthony also served up back to back wins (had two Boubon Radioactives) and a very good buzz at that!"
Tiffany H.,"South San Francisco, CA",242,131,222,2.0,6/22/2017,"After our table tracker finally rang to notify us a table was ready, we ended up waiting another 5 minutes. Why? I have no idea, the person who was supposed to sit us down walked away with nobody and came back looking all confused as to why we were standing there.  Sat down at 6:50pm and the waiter didn't come to get our drink order until 7pm, which by that time, we were ready to order our food too. All we asked to drink was water but that took a whopping six mins. I guess it took awhile because the waiter was getting bread too? But it wasn't hot or anything so I'm not sure what the holdup was. While waiting for our food to come, our party of four finished the bread and asked for more. This time the bread was warm and took only three minutes! In addition to our bread, they were holding onto drinks and bread from other tables as well. Three minutes is pretty good, which makes me wonder why it took so long earlier.  Once our food came, we were just kinda left alone. This has its benefits and drawbacks. Benefits: we can focus on us and our food. Drawbacks: if we needed our waiter for anything it was hard to flag them down, especially when we were done eating and just sitting here waiting...  About the food: Personally I ordered the chicken Marsala with mushroom pasta. The chicken was well cooked and was not too chewy and soft. I really don't like to eat overcooked chicken that gets dry and chewy so I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pasta itself had enough sauce. A weird thing to note is that aside from the bow tie pasta that came with my food also had a decent amount of spaghetti. Now that we have waited so long for the waiter to come back, we are all pretty full so no dessert unfortunately. When she finally came around, we told her we were too full and asked for our boxes but she walked off too quickly before we can ask for the check but she came back pretty quickly with it.  Why did I rate this place 2 stars? Well beginning from 5 stars, -1 for inconsistency and confusion in waiting time at the front to be seated, -1 for inconsistent waiting time for water/bread, -1 for just sitting there waiting for the waiter to come back so we can get boxes and the check."
Adrienne B.,"San Mateo, CA",108,23,452,5.0,10/10/2017,"I went here a couple weeks ago with my fiancé and had the bang-bang chicken and shrimp for dinner and a chocolate mousse cheesecake for dessert.  The bang-bang chicken and shrimp was amazing! It came in a creamy coconutty peanutty sauce with just the right amount of kick. I don't understand why this restaurant currently has a 2.5 star rating because the service I got was just as good as their food.  The server we had was always checking up on us to make sure that we were enjoying our meal. I came back last week and order the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, which is perfect for a garlic lover :)"
Amy C.,"Newark, CA",1518,982,1731,3.0,6/3/2017,"I think people should go to the Cheesecake Factory if they are going to get cheesecake only.  Otherwise, don't come here. First of all, everything is so high calorie! It's too much!  The menu is definitely extensive with so many different options, but it seems that all categories are just so fattening. These days I'm trying to be a bit more health conscious so I wasn't a fan of this place. My friend insisted on coming here for dinner cause she wanted cheesecake, but in the end, she didn't even order her damn cheesecake. Ugh.  I wanted to order the Ahi Tuna Salad, but they were out of it. So I settled on the Factory Chopped Salad which I didn't read fully before ordering since the girl was pressuring me into picking something. I hated that it had bleu cheese in the salad. Gross. Yeah, I'm one of those people who don't like bleu cheese. Yuck.  My friend got a chicken entree and a tatertot appetizer which she thought was tasty. Originally she was going to get the stuffed mushrooms, but surprise- they were out.  I know it was a holiday (Memorial Day), but it still suck to be out of things.  I love their cheesecakes! It's seriously so decadently sweet, but that's about it."
Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1998,829,6041,2.0,3/2/2017,"I've been to my share of Cheesecake Factories and this San Mateo location is one of the worst ones I've been to, due to service, wait time (of the food), and the quality of the food. So this location is located in the Hillsdale Mall - meaning that the wait time can get super long. And even though they give you the beepers that will vibrate when it's time for you to be seated, the signal doesn't reach too far so you pretty much have to wait around Cheesecake. When we arrived on a weekday night, we were told that the wait would be over an hour long. We decided to wait it out, and luckily it only took about 30 or so minutes.  But the wait for our waitress to take our order, refill our drinks, refill our bread, bring us the check - we ended up staying at the restaurant way longer than we should have. She seemed to be having a really bad day, her face reflecting her somber mood, which definitely translated in how she served her customers. We could tell that she really did not want to be there.  The complimentary bread was good, and we got seconds because the wait for the food was too long. Shirley Temple was also decent if you want a refreshing drink.  As for the food: Miso Salmon: This has always been one of my favorite dishes from Cheesecake, but I don't order it too often because it is on the pricier side. The overall taste was not too bad, but it wasn't as fresh or as vibrant as I've had at other locations. The rice beneath the salmon was a bit too hard, but the sauce and the salmon were tasty. This was one of the better dishes of the night.  Factory combination of 2 dishes: herb crusted salmon and the steak Diane along with mashed potatoes. This was not too bad, except that the herb crusted salmon paled in comparison to the miso salmon. Not as tasty, more dry, not as flavorful - the steak Diane was okay. I've been to a location where their steak Diane was horrible, so luckily the flavor was decent here. Nothing wowing about the two dishes, but I did like the mashed potatoes! This dish came out way later than the other two dishes, which was pretty sad considering we were almost done eating the other dishes.  Tomato Basil Pasta: not a bad pasta dish, although it could have used more sauce. Comes with chicken and fresh mozzarella along with penne pasta. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked - definitely lacking in salt, but nothing bad about the dish.  Cheesecakes:  Had to go with the fresh strawberry cheesecake since it's the most popular. And I can see why! The original topped with fresh glazed strawberries and a few dollops of whipped cream - very light and refreshing. The strawberries give a little tartness to the sweetness of the cheesecake, making you want to put another bite into your mouth after you've already inhaled one.  30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake cheesecake: this has layers of the original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream along with one dollop of whipped cream. This is very rich in chocolate taste, but not too overwhelming due to the layers of original cheesecake. I liked it! Very fudgy and definitely on the sweet side. I would reorder this again as well!  tl;dr - The biggest drawback was probably the poor service and the amount of time we had to wait for our food. Food seemed to be lacking, but the cheesecakes were good - thank goodness they can have consistent cheesecake. Don't think I'd return to this location if I was in the area."
Samantha A.,"Redwood City, CA",186,7,1,1.0,1/3/2018,"I have always gone to the one in downtown Palo Alto and always been satisfied. First time at this location and I haven't left a restaurant so upset before. Ordered appitizers we never got, pasta came out cold and chicken was still pink in my sandwhich and our waiter would Barely come out to see how we wer doing or how the food was. He practically forgot about us and we had to ask the host for assistance. When we asked for our check he was rude and I will never be coming here again. Very disappointed"
Em P.,"San Francisco, CA",503,163,127,1.0,7/31/2017,"0 STARS!!! Hearing of the Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo makes me cringe.  Here's my story. It's my mom's birthday. She just had surgery and had gone through all sorts of health problems and her request on her birthday was to eat at Cheesecake Factory. I called and spoke to a manager whose name is Craig. I explained my situation about my mom and how I really wanted to make it extra special for her. He was super nice on the phone, he explained they didn't take reservations but that he was going to take care of my family when we got there. He was very accommodating assuring me that he will make this a great experience for us and to ask for him by name.  I didn't expect to have a red carpet treatment or anything, but I do expect a manager to abide by his word and not mislead me into thinking that he was going to accommodate my party of 10, but in all reality he was not going to. After hauling my family of 10, I was told we would have to wait 2 hours! I asked for Craig the manager and this lady wearing a yellow jacket said that I could not speak to him and he's busy. C'mon! Their number one priority should be customers especially unhappy ones! After insisting that I see this man for myself and for him to tell me to my face how he was dishonest on the phone, the mysteriousCraig finally made an appearance.  I spoke to him and he just kept twisting his words. Saying I didn't say this and that and how you're gonna have to wait like everyone else it. (Which would have been fine if he didn't tell me on the phone to ask for him by name and assured me that he would make my mom's birthday a very special one.) It is completely dishonest, misleading and rude of a manager to say I will take care of your party upon arrival and then say, ""Actually never mind, I never said that."" Terrible customer service. I will not make the same mistake next time to bring my family here."
Todd G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,2,2,4.0,10/15/2017,"My waiter, Prince, was a very handsome and attentive server--however, the breadsticks were only supplied when asked for. I ordered a medium-rare filet mignon but it seems likes they forgot to take it off the pan, for a second I thought I was eating the waiter's shoe. The mashed potatoes were hella chunky. Four stars because my fiancée looking stunning sitting by the window behind her presentable pasta. P.S. service is very friendly, even the fat Vietnamese dishwasher came up and greeted us."
Gaurav K.,"San Francisco, CA",158,53,144,2.0,8/4/2017,Pretty safe to say that this is one of the worst Cheesecake Factory's I've visited in the United States. The food was atrocious (even by Cheesecake Factory standards) and the service was non-existent. We ordered the Dynamite Shrimp  and the plate was dripping with oil when it was brought to our table. I could only taste the strong oil in every bite I took and I'm not sure if there was any taste to the shrimp or the sauce that the dish was served with. All of this was after they took 40 mins to serve the appetizer on a not so busy Thursday night.  We should have ideally left after this with our takeaway order of cheesecakes but we took a chance and ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. The only problem with this was that the dish we were served was less Chipotle Chicken and more chicken floating in tomato purée.  2 stars just for the cheesecakes and a 0 for the food and the service.
Oscar L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,22,8,2.0,11/6/2017,"Two times is the charms?  Several times my food (always Eggs Benedict) has been delivered to the table so cold that it was insulting, after a long wait for it. Yesterday Sunday 11/5/17, Triana our waitress delivered 3 orders of Benedicts to our table totally cold.  We could not find one sole around us at 10:30am to help. Finally the manager came, two of my guests were already eating the cold stuff so the manager took my cold food and replaced it after an 18 minute wait. It ruined our breakfast. I was never offered a fresh cup of coffee or more coffee. The manager took one Bennedict  off my bill but we all know that's not the point. This is my 3rd. time since July of this year that I experienced COLD EGGS BENNEDICT at the Hillsdale location."
Kanella G.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,51,26,2.0,6/29/2017,"I can see why this particular Cheesecake Factory only has a 2 and a half star rating... My friend and I went here today for a late lunch and let me tell you, it was the worst experience we've ever had at any Cheesecake Factory. Literally the second we sat down our server already came up to us, ""hi can I get you something to drink?"" Uhhh okay, water I guess? How are we supposed to know what we want to drink when we haven't even situated ourselves at our table? It's as if she was already standing around waiting for us to sit in her section then she immediately rushes us. Coming from a person who actually serves at another restaurant, we have ONE minute to greet our table. You can at least wait 45 seconds until we have sat down and actually opened the menu for you to greet us, no need to be in a hurry. Every time we've been to a Cheesecake Factory, the server always served bread immediately upon greeting. We had to ask her this time if we can have bread and we got the ""sure"" response. So that's cool too I guess... Food and drinks arrived pretty quickly which was a plus, and it was very tasty. The server tried to rush me again though by trying to take away my plate when I wasn't even finished with it. Kind of an uncomfortable experience, like my friend and I weren't even wanted there. Once we got the bill, we noticed that the server circled the tip examples at the bottom of the paper. Hahahaha are you kidding me? You really think we're that dumb to not know how to tip? Definitely undertipped this girl a lot for her shitty and rushed service, sorry not sorry. I'm not an idiot. Not to mention, she also grabbed the booklet before we even got up from our table to leave the restaurant. Never felt rushed before in my LIFE! We left the restaurant then unfortunately about 10 minutes later, my friend realized he left his phone at the table so we went back and asked whoever was at the host stand if they found a phone. We told him where we sat so he said he would go check on it. We saw him walk towards the kitchen, then to our table, then back to the kitchen, looking like he didn't know what he was doing. So my friend and I just checked the table ourselves and found the phone from there. More idiots that didn't want to help us. Great job! Not......."
Ray K.,"Beresford Park, San Mateo, CA",3,58,34,4.0,11/24/2017,Good food and delicious cheesecake.. big and nice space.. long line and a slow service.. friendly and helpful staff.. good to be here once in a while..
Laura P.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/8/2018,"As a party of six we arrived at noon on Sunday.  We had two six  year old little boys.   We waited approximately 15 minutes to be seated, which was fine.  We sat and waited for the server to take our drink order.  Half of the order was brought to us.  As we waited, and waited, we were told they could bring half of our order??? WHAT?? No, came together and wanted to EAT together!   We were told that the Thai spring rolls was holding up our order...not a cooked meal...just salad components on a plate!   One of the boys wanted another glass of milk and we were told up front that we would be charged for another glass...no free refills. Well, if we had our meal served on time, we would not have to order another milk to drink with his meal. So, finally at 1:30pm...one by one...our meals arrived! One and a half hour after arriving at the restaurant.  Just happy we didn't go for dinner!  We would have left at midnight!   We had to ask for a refill for the tea pot, sugar for coffee and dressing for the salad.  And we had to wait for those items.  The salad dressing came to late as we were about to leave! We were NEVER asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. So, so disappointed for our New Year family celebration.   Guess we won't be visiting again for a celebration.  :("
Joanne A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,2,1.0,12/23/2017,Stay away from this place now during the holidays. Ordered to take out and when I picked up order which was over an hour they forgot one meal. Took 45 minutes to call back because no one would answer the phone. They apologized and I went back to get my order. No one answered the phone for 30 minutes as I waited outside at the curb pick up. Went inside to get my food and they did not have it ready. So now I'm going on 1 1/2 hours to pick up my lunch. Won't see me back for a long time
Paul O.,"San Mateo, CA",76,84,257,3.0,8/9/2017,"What can I say? It's the Cheesecake Factory.  It's decent (sometimes even more than decent) but not great. The line (and the wait) is always pretty long (generally 30 minutes or more) unless you get here early (before 6:00pm on weekdays). The Good:  1.  Compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations in the Bay Area (Palo Alto & SF) parking is much easier. 2.  Extensive menu so everyone can find something that they'll eat  3.  The service is generally decent 4.  Generally big portions *5. The bread (in particular the molasses wheat bread) is really tasty and often is served warm. Also, order the shrimp scampi!  So good!! The Not So Good:  1.  Generally takes awhile to get seated  2.  The quality of the food is probably a B to B+ (it's not Thomas Keller, people!)  3.  A little pricey for the quality I would probably give this place 3.5 stars if half starts were allowed. But since they aren't, I'm giving it three stars."
Luis A.,"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco, CA",821,26,261,2.0,6/20/2017,"This is one of those places where you come prepared to have a long wait not only that, but also expect to send your steak back, apparently the cooks don't seem to know how to cook a Medium Rare steak, they will send it however they would eat it.   I do understand this isn't a steak house but come one why sell steak if you can't get it right.  The service isn't the greatest, the hosts aren't too kind neither, they look at you with this face where you can tell that they simply hate there jobs, but hey it's not my fault I am just there trying to get a table so I can eat.   Management in the chicken seems to be a little out of whack, they always sending food cold or not cooked the right way, then they do NOTHING about it.  This place is truly a 2 and half * place"
Tim N.,"Belmont, CA",3,79,8,1.0,6/17/2017,I'm not the type to only leave feedback when it's negative feedback. I love praising. I am honest and unfiltered.  I can only say one good thing about THIS location and that is that they have the same food as the others.  It's time for a check. Stop popping these things in every mall because you can. Focus on your customers. Why are there so many low ratings here?
J S.,"Daly City, CA",71,69,17,1.0,9/7/2017,"This review is solely based on the waitresses and waiters that were scheduled today in the afternoon.  NOHA was our waitress, she is excluded from this review because she was actually the only mature one working today. However, the rest of them were VERY OBNOXIOUS, UNPROFESSIONAL AND VERY LOUD. They were ALL laughing and talking about personal life in a very LOUD voice. All of us (customers) were placed next to each other and as the obnoxious laughs got louder, we all just gave each other that look. Where is the manager? Why didn't the manager set these employees straight and tell them to stay professional? They all weren't even doing their job. They all just stayed in the middle talking LOUD as if this was high school all over again.  Someone seriously needs to talk with their staff about professionalism or people won't be back at this specific location."
Jennifer K.,"Goleta, CA",432,33,40,1.0,8/25/2017,"I have always had a pleasant experience at Cheesecake Factory in other locations. But for some reason, this one was not good whatsoever! I can't tell whether it is just this location or the plates that we ordered.  The crispy chicken and pineapple shrimp plate was awful. It tasted like Panda Express' orange chicken... this is not what I was expecting from Cheesecake Factory. Also, I specifically asked for brown rice but received white rice with some pieces of brown rice in it. The few brown rice pieces were super hard as if they cooked white rice on top of old brown rice.  As for the chicken riesling, it was INCREDIBLY salty when we expected it to be sweeter. The chicken was too salty to eat.  The best dish I had was the complimentary bread.  Otherwise, our server Sydney was very attentive and sweet which is why I gave this place 1 star."
Jean-Yves F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,136,,1.0,11/18/2017,"How long does it take to get a Filet mignon, medium rare, in this CheesecakeFactory? More than 40 minutes after order, AND, after first complain. We ordered a salmon, a kid's menue and a filet mignon medium rare, and a side of french fries. 2 couples sat to the tables next to us after we ordered our food. Both couples received their entrees, paid and left before we got our dishes.  I raised my hand to call a nearby waitress. This is when he really knew that there was a problem. He most likely informed our waitress, Champagne, who came  5 minutes later, with the kid's menu, the french fries and the salmon. My filet mignon was not ready. How long does it really take to sizzle a filet mignon? unless they completely forgot my order.  Now.. The food. I asked a filet mignon, supposed to be very tender, medium rare. It arrived burned, hard, and more like between medium rare and well-done. This is really the worst filet mignon of my life. An insult to the French cuisine. I'm sure that Mc Donalds can cook a better medium rare filet mignon if they could do it. What about the french fries? Too salty and cold. I complained to the waitress about the wait and she gave us an attitude, like she could care less. Once I was done with my filet mignon, here comes the check and the waitress was eager to see us leave. Maybe she did not like the fact that we were sitting too long to our table, waiting for our food. This is the worst experience of my life in any Cheesecake factory, the worst for thak kind of restaurant, I would say."
Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,4.0,8/19/2016,Review is only for their cheesecakes. Stopped by here after a Giant's game. My friend and I had no idea it was national cheesecake day until the waiter told us it's been pretty busy because of it - half priced cheesecakes! We ordered the oreo cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake. Oreo cheesecake was very decadent and a little too much chocolate for me taste. It took me 3 days to finish it because I could only handle a few bites at a time. My friend's classic strawberry cheesecake was great. I really like their glazed fresh strawberries. Our server was friendly and attentive. Overall good visit.
Erica R.,"San Mateo, CA",30,49,4,1.0,8/10/2017,"This post is for service! Poor service and not worth the one star.  This establishment has poor management and I won't be returning, can't imagine giving a single cent to a business that could care less about their customers. Please put some quality behind your customer service. I hardly use Yelp to write bad reviews but I couldn't believe the service we received and when asked to speak with management we were greeted with a smirk and DGAF attitude. I will gladly take my family elsewhere for dinner."
Angelo D.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,1,2.0,12/30/2017,The wait was too long and the service is too slow plus our waitress forgot my wife's bday after my kids telling him. My kids was so disappointed because the other table is singing birthday song. My kids was hoping to surprise there Mom but they got a dissatisfaction from our waitress even and he almost forgot to bring our cheesecake to go
Sarah H.,"Columbus, OH",31,14,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Was looking forward to having my boyfriend's birthday dinner at the Cheesecake Factory -- but this store left me very disappointed.  He ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo -- but instead received a soup of a pasta. Alfredo sauce is supposed to be thick, creamy, and decadent. The dish we were served was a sad excuse for a pasta sauce -- watered down, flavorless, and cost $16 for something that was ill prepared and disappointing. The sauce didn't even stick to the noodles -- never before have I seen a pasta where the sauce was complete liquid. Come on, Cheesecake Factory. Sad to say, never coming back to this location. Overpriced and terrible quality."
Shawn S.,"Fresno, CA",66,5,1,1.0,11/29/2017,I ordered curbside today and was calling to pick up my order but was disconnected and then on hold for 10 minutes.  I finally went in to pick up the order myself and there were 2 people ahead of me but they seem to not know how to handle their customers.  Totally disappointed. Still here waiting in line with no movement at all.
Amer A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,15,7,5.0,12/5/2017,Never met a cheesecake I didn't like. So this place is a Yes. Chicken Bellagio rocks. Big Servings. Yummy dishes. Oh you're still sitting there? Come enjoy a slice...
Allie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",522,327,658,2.0,6/25/2017,"Cheesecake factory is my favorite franchise restaurant. I've been to multiple locations and I've had the worst experience at this location so I will not be back to this location.  My party of 4 waited up to 1.5 hours. While we were waiting, we could see so many tables had no one seated and the tables just needed to be cleared. Where were all the bussers??  When we finally got seated and the waiter finally took our order, they didn't have chicken pot pie  or white rice left so we had to order other items on the menu. 20 mins in after we ordered, we still got no complimentary bread. From my previous experiences with Cheesecake factory, you never have to ask them for it and they just bring it to you. So we finally asked the waiter if we could have some. His response was ""Oh..I think we just ran out. Let me check!"" He came back 5 mins later with TWO small pieces for 4 of us. He said ""This is the last two pieces for real of the night."" The funny thing was, we saw on his serving tray there was another bread holder tray with 4 pieces and he served it to the table next to us with only 3 people in the party! My thought of that was because the table next to us was seated much later than us, and they had 3 people in their party only. However, he probably gave it to them since they ran out of most of the food they tried to order. (That table seemed really pissed too since he spent a good 5-10 mins just taking their order and the ran out of all the items they requested). So, the waiter was pretty good at lying. Our first dish we ordered came out 30 minutes after we ordered and each dish after that was another 10 mins after. Our entire experience was approximately 3 hours (wait time included and probably longer).  I won't be back to this location for the long wait and being understaffed and for running out of a lot of food."
Angela S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/27/2017,"Food is ok, but service was very slow. Almost 1 hour to get our meals (which arrived cold). We couldn't get the waiter's attention. Long wait, not worth it."
David A.,"Buford, GA",122,167,156,2.0,2/20/2017,"First off know that I dislike chains, but am willing to accept when there is one my wife very much likes, for example the Cheesecake factory. We frequent the Pleasanton location and have been to San Mateo as well as other ones in the US like Austin, TX. I have also posted reviews of those. The good at this location is the bartenders do have to work hard which they do and the food is quality like you get from your average Cheesecake factory (this is a good thing).  This particular location is understaffed and can be disorganized. For the plethora of options in San Mateo for miles and miles, they will struggle unless service improves. What drives me crazy is that the Hillsdale mall does not currently have a food court and Paul Martin is super pricey so if TCF was actually solid all-around they would probably be pouring in the customers and cash. This location is cheaper than the SF location for identical items."
Breanna O.,"Downtown, South San Francisco, CA",49,2,,3.0,12/28/2017,"My boyfriend and I were shopping, and wanted to grab something to eat. We've been to this location before, but their prices have definitely increased within the last two years. Along with increasing prices, the quality of the food and service definitely has decreased."
Alan S.,"Fullerton, CA",348,101,392,1.0,12/10/2016,The cheesecake take out register is SUPER SLOW. The workers seem like they hate their lives and they don't even acknowledge the customers even though there's a line... 20 mins to order some cheesecake to go and another 15 mins to get it ready? It's right there lol  Told the manager to fix their service and his response was that the cake cashiers do not know how to use the computer... HAHHA come on now bro...  Giving it a star because I like the cheesecake
