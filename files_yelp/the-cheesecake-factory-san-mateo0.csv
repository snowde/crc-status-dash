Anjali N.,"Claremont, CA",160,18,3,2.0,11/16/2015,"I was very excited about trying this place for the first time. And I was very disappointed with the experience! I'm not even taking into account the hour long wait time because if it's worth the wait,who cares? However, that was not the case. We got a salmon appetizer which was really good. And then we ordered a crispy chicken costolleta and a chicken sandwich without cheese. The waiter got the sandwich with the cheese and we had to send it back. They then just scraped off the cheese, turned it upside down and gave it back. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery and we traded it for a fish taco. The taco was laced with barbecue sauce and didn't go well with it. As for the crispy chicken costolleta, it was just breaded chicken with a lot of butter and some lumpy mashed potatoes. Oh and before I forget, I had to ask for a knife for my dish because there wasn't one on the table. By now I was done and just wanted to leave, but decided to get the fudge cake to feel better. But no, they were out of it !! So I had to get the triple chocolate tower something which was good. Ohh and again, I had to ask for the forks for this one too. All in all, this wasn't a good experience and I don't know if I'll come back."
Jennifer S.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,1,5.0,2/12/2017,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this place is exceptional. It's evident in the taste that their food is made with love. They provide a great service at a great price. They will be very successful."
Jordan C.,"San Leandro, CA",346,17,2,4.0,6/24/2016,"Definitely a good cheese cake factory! I'm pretty sure everyone's been here, and we're trying to make sure we're not going to a bad one but this one is just fine. They have the usual food, great service unless they're busy don't expect much haha. I usually get the guacamole salad which is always bomb, and the fried chicken wings which is really good haha. Definitley a good usual spot :D"
Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,8/27/2016,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and this was my first time at this location. It is located in the mall so it may be hard to avoid doing some shopping if you come to this location. The restaurant itself is a pretty good size and a large bar in the middle of the restaurant. We came here during a week day, it was busy since it was around dinner time but since there was only two of us, we got seated right away. Our waitress came right away but didn't seem to be to happy. She looked like she was either working long hours, didn't like her job or maybe both? None the less she provided us with the best service possible with coming frequently to check on our food and refilling drinks which earned her a decent tip at the end. We ordered salads and a fish dish which came at the same time as our salads so by the time we got to the fish dish it was slightly cold but it was still good none the less. I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory and will be coming back."
Dan K.,"Redwood City, CA",9,13,,4.0,1/2/2017,"So sue me, I happen to like the food. Yes, the service can be slow, the atmosphere is chaotic, and the portions are way too big. And it's a big corporate chain. But I keep going back because I like the food, and I generally have a good time there."
Jes W.,"Oceanside, CA",18,33,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Well, I will start off with I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food never disappoints, with that said, it ended there tonight. Our server was awful! My family got to the table about 20 minutes or so before I got there. They had only just gotten their drinks. They didn't see the server again. Was the server the one who got the drinks? Nope. A manager had to do it. He finally came and took our order, and that was really it. We only Saw him again when he dropped off 3 out of 5 of our meals. My family was about half finished with their food before my daughter got hers, but mine was nowhere to be seen. We got the manager again. He explained an error in the kitchen. That would be ok, but the server couldn't come and say anything about it? He was one of the worst I've ever had. No checking on anything, no refills, no presence on the floor, nothing. The manager comped my meal. Um, thanks, but did you really think I was going to pay for it? I really think he should have done more for that level of incompetent service. I will eat at Cheesecake again, but never ever ever ever here."
Niloofar A.,"San Mateo, CA",17,17,7,1.0,6/17/2016,Not the first time me and my friends get sick from eating at this restaurant! Yeah the food tastes good but not worth vomiting after an hour.
Alice L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,5,20,5.0,8/8/2016,"Great food and great service!! The food is clean and  is fancy. I love coming here because after a great meal, they have cheesecake that I love!!"
Anne C.,"San Francisco, CA",1231,30,10,2.0,3/16/2016,"I was honestly super excited to go to this Cheesecake Factory rather than the one in SF. However I was full of disappointment. When there is no one waiting except for ONE party of 3 (mind you I was just a party of 2) expect the wait to be 5-10 minutes.. Just like the host said... Yet we ended up waiting up to 45 minutes. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? As we waited and waited... People who just came strolling by without any reservations (who also came after us) were seated first. When 30 minutes hit, I went over to them & they said they were just cleaning the table and should right out. Then another host shows up. 15 minutes later, I had to ask again where the fuck is our table, & they had to say wait one minute, & someone FINALLY got us our table. They then apologized for their mistake.. But by the time we got there, it was just a mess. We got forks .. But no plates. Drinks but no water, even after requesting it. Flagging down a waiter was hard enough too.  I overall really liked our server though. He was a very sweet guy. However this experience was just ridiculous. The food was good / decent , probably a little bit on the salty side. But overall, we spend about 100 after taxes & tip (I used to serve so I know tipping is important).  In the end, 50 dollars per person is ridiculous for what we experienced. I truly wanted to like this place, I really did. But I was mainly shot down by the unbelievable wait for a table. Really not sure if I wish to go there anymore :/."
Ranjan P.,"Millbrae, CA",3,333,22,4.0,6/3/2017,"This was the closest place and we're starving, we popped in here for a late lunch. To be totally honest, my expectations were low, after all, it's considered a teflon, right? Three of us are seated fairly promptly, and we order lemon cheesecake, a lunch special small pizza and caesar salad, plus a Thai chicken curry over rice dish, which my husband and mother in law shared. First of all, the bread was remarkable: piping warm, crusty and soft (two types) with butter. The food was uniformly very good, the caesar sparkled, fresh and crisp romaine with a tangy dressing, which did not overwhelm (I did miss the anchovies, though maybe I should've asked for them). The pizza was more than decent, a crispy and blistered crust, blend of sausage and pepperoni, kalamata olives on request, a piquant tomato sauce. My husband scarfed down his rice dish and their tropical fresh brew iced tea for fantastic, fruity and not at all bitter without being cloyingly sweet. Here's my only negative: the cheesecake was disgusting--shocker, right? After all, they're named ""Cheesecake Factory!"" I'm chagrined to admit that after one teeny bite, I sent it back because no way was I gonna be able to eat it--it was inedible: the consistency was not light, airy, and fluffy; nor was it tangy and fresh lemony. Instead, it was a dense and artificially tasting, cream laden gunk of a bloby thing, gross . . . maybe the worst cake I've ever eaten. the food made up for it though. And here's the awesome part: every single person who served us was sweet, attentive, caring, warm, friendly, and super helpful! The guy who seated us offered to turn down the music, because it was blaringly loud for my aging ears. Our server was an incredibly kind young woman, who listened more than beyond the call of duty to my description of the cheesecake. As we were walking out, two different employees said goodbye in the sweetest and sincere way possible. This awesome customer service goes a very long way with me, and despite the cheesecake, this is a place I can imagine going back to. Kudos for the service, and thank-you!"
Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",285,689,138,2.0,4/14/2015,"Not impressed. Came in for lunch this week with a friend, expecting to order the same thing we've ordered for years at countless other Cheesecake Factory locations.  Service here is VERY SLOW and not so swift. It took 30+ minutes just to receive our correct appetizer (after the wrong one was sent out), which then arrived cold and poorly cooked. The bread was also less than fresh and overall we weren't feeling it. We ended up paying and leaving rather than waiting another hour on any more food."
Xiuwen S.,ニューヨーク,38,3,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Zero stars if possible. We have waited one hour to get in, 20 minutes to get our order in, then 40 minutes for the food to finally come. Not one waiter cares enough to check up on us, not did any waiter respond to us during the wait."
Sunil R.,"San Francisco, CA",708,2322,12,3.0,6/7/2015,This is a safe option for dining at the Hillsdale mall where dining options are not that impressive. I usually avoid Cheesecake Factory because the size of the dishes are intimidating.  One nice thing about this location is that they have outdoor seating where you can people watch.
Moe A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",335,193,46,1.0,8/24/2016,This place sucks. We waited a whole hour and didn't get our entree. No point of coming here if you're hungry.
Jin K.,"New York, NY",108,14,107,4.0,5/25/2015,"I'm visiting SF and since there is no Cheesecake Factory on the Big Island, I had to stop by.  The food, I would say, wasn't that amazing (everything seemed to be quite buttery or oily), but the cheesecakes were fantastic. I definitely want to stop by again before I head back to Hawaii, not for food, but for desserts.  Our waiter, Justin, was friendly. Though, he did mess up one of our orders (brought out the wrong pasta). But overall, he was one of the nicest waiters I met. I went with my parents and some of their friends who couldn't speak English very well, but he was very attentive and he tried his best to meet our needs. It's always nice to walk out of a restaurant, knowing that if my parents were to come again on their own (without a person who can speak English fluently), that they would still be treated the same as others.  Recommendations: the avocado egg-rolls & the lemon meringue cheesecake."
Philip L.,"Belmont, CA",48,1184,6,4.0,8/8/2015,"Perfect place for birthday celebration. Free & freshly baked bread is darn good, big portions, and good quality ingredients. High on calories (except for healthy menu) but fine for special occasions. Kobe burger itself was good altho the mushroom onion topping was a tad too sweet, took it off. Steak diane pretty good flavor, herb roasted salmon kind of tasteless but healthy. Birthdays get a free small sundae (50pct whipped cream) but cant complain as its free."
Anita P.,"San Mateo, CA",2,28,,1.0,3/29/2016,"Food was good.  The service is horrible! Waitress never smiled and lacked common sense. After meal, ordered a piece of cheesecake to be split for two women.  Waitress brings a plate and two forks. Then returns with cheesecake uncut, places it on table and walks away. I took the plate and cheesecake to the dessert counter and asked them to cut it.  Those staff members were very nice and helpful. We only tipped our miserable server 15% Table was sticky, we complained, server sent over a nice guy that had no idea how to clean a table. Lousy management, poor staffing and lack of training I would go to In 'n Out, before stepping foot in the Hillsdale Cheesecake Factory!"
Stuart T.,"San Leandro, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/5/2017,Took thirty minutes to get a horrible soupy tasteless and sickly crab and artichoke appetizer and an hour to get a tasteless entree.Thank god for the salt and pepper on the table.Dont eat here unless you want over priced food and terrible service.They need to close this one down asap bad management for sure.
Dianna H.,"Daly City, CA",93,353,1499,3.0,5/20/2014,"I'm not a big fan of the food at the Cheesecake Factory...it's pretty average stuff. Last time I went I ordered their Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane combo platter, and it was good but not great. I'm really here to write a review for their Frozen Iced Mango smoothie drink. I ordered it on a whim because I LOVE mangoes and I was blown away by how good (read: mango-ey) this drink was. All mango lovers should definitely give this a shot!!! I love the presentation with the red (I think raspberry?) swirl down the middle, but the taste was 100% mango with the tiniest hint of coconut. I constantly search out mango-flavored stuff wherever I go, and I was majorly impressed with this smoothie!"
Venus L.,"San Bruno, CA",187,607,1204,2.0,2/23/2014,"I remember going to the Cheesecake Factory a couple years ago and my memory of it was not a pleasant one. Originally the plan was to eat sushi in downtown San Mateo, but my boyfriend and I went on a Friday night and there was WAY too many cars fighting for parking so we decided to come here instead as I was ready to give this place another try.  Coming here on a Friday night around 8pm was a bad idea. The wait time (according to the hostess..) was about 50 minutes for 2 people. Fine. I was hungry and unwilling to drive anywhere so we just put our name down and got the buzzer.. thing. The hostess did inform us that the bar area and the high tables next to it were first come first serve meaning that if a table opens up... run to it. Run like the wind, Bullseye! It took us about 20 minutes for a high table to open up and when it did... we walked super fast to it.  Service... took a while. We sat at the table with the last group's mess for a while watching server after server walk by us for about 10 minutes before a server actually took notice of us and began clearing the table. The server my boyfriend and I got was very friendly and brought the drinks and food to our table as swiftly as possible.  Food wise... eh. My boyfriend's shepard's pie was yum, but my basil tomato pasta was a let down. The penne in my dish was still a little hard to chew and all I really tasted was the tomato sauce. No basil whatsoever. And I don't know if it's just the way it's suppose to be, but the sauce was super watered down. And there was oil floating around in my dish as well. (Go see my photo~) I didn't even want to take it home, but I would feel too bad for wasting food so I'll try to stomach it down later. Overall, eh. Service was good, but the food was just so-so. Kind of thankful I didn't have to wait the full 50 minutes for a table 'cause it would not have been worth it."
