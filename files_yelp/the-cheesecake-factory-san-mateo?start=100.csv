Kate N.,"Pleasanton, CA",542,223,237,5.0,5/12/2016,Came in for dessert.. Had a good time. It was right before closing and still had really good service. Also celebrated my girlfriend's birthday.. And the drinks were really strong and yummy!
Ena Y.,"San Mateo, CA",14,133,138,3.0,5/7/2016,"I think three stars is accurate for this place. food: 3 stars Variety on the menu: 4 stars Service: 2 stars Wait time: 1 star Cheesecake: 5 stars For lunch I ordered Evelyn's Favorite pasta. I got angel hair instead of penne. It was decent.  Our waitress didn't come back for a while and when I tried to flag down someone else for water, we were told ""that isn't my job"" and he didn't even offer to flag down another waiter/waitress. I'm not sure if the food and the wait time (especially on a weekend) are worth it. This is the only option on this side of the mall though, so that makes sense. Plus the cheesecakes are well worth the wait or other food.  Overall, it's a fine place if there are no other choices. Or if you're just coming for dessert!"
Winnie W.,"Hayward, CA",151,135,77,2.0,11/27/2016,"Been to this location twice. Once for a company dinner of about 7 people and another time to drop by and buy a frozen pumpkin cheesecake. Both times the wait was really long, longer than they had told us. We started off eating artichoke and crab dip and sipping on mixed drinks at the bar while waiting, which were all good. Avocado eggrolls weren't bad either. Got the pineapple mojito which was pretty strong for a mixed drink. The pasta I had was good as well, not particularly memorable. The second time I came to buy a pumpkin cheesecake, I had called ahead of time to ask about pricing and whether an order had to be placed ahead of time, so I wouldn't have to wait. However, after paying at the register, cashier didn't give me a heads up or anything after taking payment. Should have told me it would take more than 15 minutes to just box a frozen cheesecake."
Anand S.,"Philadelphia, PA",139,57,148,2.0,7/16/2016,"The service here is really bad . We had no plates on our table , no knife and  we were given only 3 glasses of water for a table of 4  . I had to personally go fetch everything from an empty table because the person attending to us didn't bother . May be she was having a off day because usually my other cheese cake factory experiences have been really wonderful but for a place which demands some sort of premium pricing I would expect the service to be better .coming to the food the bread and the cheesecake were really good as usual. Ordered the salmon which was really cooked well . I would not visit this location of Cheesecake Factory again only due to the bad service."
Tamana M.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/25/2017,"Worst service ever and terrible experience!  My husband called them to order Louisiana chicken pasta and plain cheesecake, but they put him on hold for 10 minutes and the phone got disconnected. So he called back and he was on hold again for a few minutes until someone finally took his order and told him that it will be ready in 20-25 minutes.  After 20 minutes I went to pick up our order. Waited in line for 5 minutes while they were attending another customer whose order was incorrect. Finally, I gave them my name and order but they couldn't find it in their system. I don't know if it was the cashier or manager told me that this never happened to them I must have called the wrong place. Basically, they tried to put the blame on us for their mistake. Luckily my husband send me the screen shot of the call to hillsdale Cheesecake Factory. And she says, ""oh, that's weird maybe he didn't complete the order because it takes more than 5 minutes to place an order."" Are you kidding me!? We order only 2 items, why would it take more than 5 minutes to place a simple order!  Thus, I had to reorder my food. To make up for their mistake, which she didn't accept, she offered to give the cheesecake slice for free and said she will rush the order to 10 minutes. After 15 minutes I go to her asking about my order and she rudely tells me that ""well it's pasta, it takes time"" and walks away. After another 10 minutes they finally call my name  BUT it's only the pasta. When I asked that employee, he had no idea about the cheesecake slice so I had to reexplain the situation.  It really is not about the money. Was 6-$7 piece of cheesecake worth my time and frustration?  Lack of communication, disorganized management, and careless attitude of the female employee was shocking. I have been to many Cheesecake Factory's and by far I have had horrible experience in hillsdale one whether if it was dinning in or taking out several times.  Onwards, Will definitely try to avoid that place!"
Karla B.,"San Mateo, CA",3,61,15,1.0,6/23/2016,"Our 20 minute wait became 40 then at 40 they say 15 more minutes, but yet more than half the restaurant is empty.  I get that sometimes a business can be understaffed for one reason or another, but at this location it seems to be a constant.  So many groups of people leaving after waiting an hour and still not being seated."
Sarina A.,"San Francisco, CA",101,235,694,1.0,4/15/2017,"Decided to have a Good Friday dinner here because they have plenty options of non meat dishes.  Our party included 3 adults and 2 children. 1 of the children even had a booster seat. Yet, the man who sat us gave us 5 adult menus. He even placed the adult menu in front of each person including the kids. Uhhhhh okayyyy. We had to ask for a Kids Menu from our Waitress and she too was surprised we didn't have any. It took 37 minutes to get our main dishes. I always order the Shrimp Scampi at every Cheesecake Factory chain , so I know exactly what it's supposed to taste like. The dish tonight however was so watered down and bland it was uneatable. I asked for the thai lettuce wraps to be boxed since it was BARELY touched. Because it took so long for the food we got full off the complimentary bread. The waitress boxes the food and places it in bags ready to go. It wasn't until the next day that I checked all the food. Why wouldn't you pack all 3 sauces for the lettuce wrap dish when it's part of the dish?? It was barely touched. That to me, means laziness. The dish looked almost untouched yet she forgot to pack all 3 sauces? How can you forget when the sauces are in the middle of the dish?? Yeah. No. I wasn't happy with the service at this location. She didn't even ask if we wanted refills on our sodas. I've had better experiences at other chains. I definitely do not recommend this chain and Hillsdale Mall."
Jose M.,"South San Francisco, CA",161,15,42,1.0,6/24/2017,I just ordered a Cobb Salad and so disappointed with the Clutter of Service for over priced Deli Food best part was the Avocado but everything else was so Mediocre and over priced!! I can't believe why people would want to wait for over a hour for a table to Served Food that is not appealing..
Maraea T.,"San Mateo, CA",111,6,2,1.0,6/23/2017,This has to be the worst cheesecake factory location I have ever experienced. Everytime I come here the waiters and waitresses seem like they're hiding and don't want to serve you. And the worst part is we don't even have to set foot in here and they still mess up our orders for pick up. I blame my love for the food on the menu for pushing me to put up with this location because it's nearest to me. I called in tonight to make an order and I was put through to the bakery to order and have been on hold for 20 minutes I even tried calling from a different phone and still holding forever. Don't waste your time here. Go to another location. This is by far the worst
Sennï Neleb P.,"Hayward, CA",102,17,62,5.0,9/4/2016,Food was really good! Reed our server was super attentive & always making sure we were okay with our drinks and our needs. I have nothing bad to say about this place been couple times we been here and always had good experience. You do have to wait a little for seating if you have a party of 5 lol!  Other than that everything was Amazing!!  Reed was clearly an example for few other servers   Was a good Sunday Funday! Now let's Shop
Dorothy L.,"Belmont, CA",12,55,,4.0,6/20/2017,"We live close by and have been coming here for years.  We noticed recently it is improving with the service, food and atmosphere.  It is getting jammed packed at certain hours with so many people. We would like make a postive comment about one of your employees. In our last visit, Brandan was very friendly, helpful, right on the spot service. There should something said about a good/outstanding service. I have been disappointed often with the opposite service these days everywhere else, and it's such an pleasure to get this excellent service.  Thank you Brandon!"
Rainar W.,"Redwood City, CA",156,174,186,4.0,5/3/2016,"Huge portions, extensive selection, great atmosphere, and delectable food. What's not to like? Oh right... the line, long wait during peak times and sometimes the service.  I come to this location multiple times a month. Sometimes the meal goes by smooth and wonderful and other times there would be a deafening fire alarm, service charging 3x the tip that I wrote which the manager compensated with a gift card however that said gift card had $0 when I tried to use it, taking over 10 minutes for missing lettuce and the list goes on.  However every time the food really shines. I love their Miso Salmon, Thai Salmon, Fresh Basil and Tomato and Flatbread, Wild Mushroom Soup, Fresh Kale Salad, Pasta, Shepard's Pie and lunch portioned items! It doesn't hurt they also offer a Skinnylicious Menu since most of their dishes are quite excessive in terms of fat and calories.  I have to admit I'm not much of a cake person. I rarely ever eat cake or cheesecake for that matter. However if I really had to eat a cheesecake then I enjoy their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It's one of the few that isn't overly drenched in chocolate and has a very yummy vanilla flavor.  All in all, I will continue to dine here and make due with the service because I can't be without their drool-worthy food!"
Gloria M.,"San Mateo, CA",1,12,8,1.0,10/13/2017,"Worst experience ever! My husband and I arrived at 4:50pm, the bar was full so we asked for a table. We got seated right away, since we go there so often we didn't need to look at the menu, we placed our order. 45 min later I asked my waitress if our food was almost ready, since people that ordered way after us had received their food. She went to check and came back with our food, she said my husbands fries were still cooking. I tried my food and it was cold, was husbands burger was also cold. I believe it was sitting out for at least 15 min, she came back with the fries, well same story super cold. We told her that our food was cold, and we had decided to take off and not eat the food. She said she would get the manager not once did we hear an im sorry or let me re-make it, the manager came to our table. Not sure why he even bothered, he didn't offer us anything he just said I heard what happened, have a good weekend. Thank you for being a robot both of you, my husband and I go there way to often to get treated the way we did, normally we sit at the bar. And seriously have way better service. Needless to say we will not be going back, I will for sure be calling corporate on Monday. Don't waste your time going there not worth the wait"
Jennifer N.,"San Mateo, CA",645,299,1718,4.0,8/22/2016,"I don't normally enjoy restaurants that are chained to the point of identical with no uniqueness to them. But there's something about cheesecake factories and their incredible power to siphon though every mall in America and make its mark with their American sized dishes and not so interesting menu.  That said, the Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo is nice, and a popular place for shoppers. I really enjoy their hibachi steak. It is steak with beautiful flavors of mushroom and onions, sweetish with an Asian taste. The mashed potatoes are seriously indulgent and goes really well with the drippings of sauce that's laid on the beef. The meatloaf is also quite nice, and complex. The flavors are tangy and meaty, just what I would expect meatloaf to taste like.  I think most people really like the sides. Cheesecake Factory does not go wrong with their sides. There is a certain level of standard when it comes to chain restaurants and this is probably the only thing that's worth mentioning. Consistency has always been on point. The service though, that's another story. They seem to love to under employ and many of the waiters/waitresses are too busy and make no eye contact. My waitress also forgot the asparagus that came with my hibachi steak and when asked she was so sure it didn't come with it though it was stated on the menu. She said it was really weird that it said that on the menu, but I've been there a few times this year and had the same thing. Nothing has changed. I don't think it's weird."
mehjabeen k.,"San Francisco, CA",6,29,6,1.0,2/26/2017,"Do not come to this Cheesecake Factory in the evening. The customer service is terrible. We walked in and were poorly greeted by Andy, the woman at the front. We were a party of seven and were told that there was an hour wait. The place was empty, at 9pm, but still an hour wait. So, we opted to go to the bar area to find some seats, as we were really hungry. Seeing that the tables were small, we asked if there was any way we could sit in a booth (we had a baby with us and it would have been easier). Michael, tried to accommodate our hungry group and right when we were about to sit down Prince (the Indian server) came to our group and rudely stated that we couldn't sit there. He was insensitive to the fact that we had a baby with us and empty booths all around. There is a way to talk to people and the way that Prince came at us was really unacceptable. We told Prince that Michael said it was okay and then Michael just denied it. Really?! Seven people heard you say it was okay, Michael. We are paying customers that just wanted to sit and have some food. There was absolutely no need for the attitude.  After that, we were desperate and decided to squeeze into the high table. Twenty minutes later, no menu, no napkin, no service, we decided to leave. I have worked customer service jobs all my life and the way that this Cheesecake Factory is run, with young kids lacking the basic customer service skills, is beyond terrible. We will not be returning to this location.  Lesson to management, train your employees and have them check their attitudes at the door."
Joey M.,"San Bruno, CA",136,33,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Loved the food hated the service.  Asked server for water, he did not bring it. Had to ask the server who brought our food for it.  Server said he would bring us bread and did not.  Server practically ignored us during our meal. Rarely check in with us."
Janet T.,"San Mateo, CA",918,211,,5.0,2/12/2017,"My best friend and i had an meal at The Cheesecake Factory today. 3pm....so it was either a late lunch or early dinner (lunch prices stay in effect till 5pm). We ordered for drinks, Nojito's, which is a non-alcoholic Mojito.  Very refreshing! Since we both absoultely love the Egg Avocado Rolls, we ordered that for an Appetizer.  I could make a meal just of those.....DELISH! For my entree i had the Pasta Carbonara. It was fabulous (as always!), i was so full i took half of it home.  My best friend had the Steak Diane. She said it was Perfect! The service was on point, waiter was friendly. Refilled our bread and water glasses, without having to ask  For dessert, we HAD to have Cheesecake. I had a slice of the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and my friend had tried the New Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake which she said was super. Whats not to like about Cheesecake!! I always enjoy the CF. Never had a bad meal. We had a bit of a wait for a table, about 30 minutes. But we were in and out in about an hour and a half......just in time to watch THE GRAMMYS at home."
David S.,"San Mateo, CA",17,128,5,1.0,12/20/2016,"Had door dash deliver. Driver had to wait for order fulfillment. Falafel salad had nothing to do with falafel. Not a garbanzo bean in sight. I think they actually deep fried doe. I included a picture. So I call the place and no one answered. It just rang and rang. What happened to the CCF? Terrible terrible all around. I was hoping to get a refund for the ""falafel"" salad, it was so disappointing."
Jessica S.,"Daly City, CA",9,93,18,4.0,12/4/2016,"The food is always good here, as well as the cheesecake. Not sure why it gets such a bad rep. The service was a bit slow (we waited 20 Mins for our cheesecake before we told them to just pack it up to go) but it was also super busy. The food is really what keeps us coming back, especially compared to other similar chain restaurants, like BJs (which can't compare)."
Mike B.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,17,13,3.0,4/26/2017,What can I say but LARGE MEALS and Great cheesecakes. Hard to choose which one to order. Service can be a little slow at times.
