Dirk D.,"San Francisco, CA",231,93,,4.0,2/4/2017,"I have to agree with other Yelpers about slow service when it is not crowded. Maybe they don't have enough servers at certain times of the afternoon. We ate here yesterday afternoon. Service was slow but picked up after placing out orders quickly at one time, The drinks came out, then the appetizers with the entrees. That's OK. ' Food is decent enough. I did find a new beer, Drakes Blonde Amber, very refreshing beer!  Otherwise everything was fine here."
Cassy Y.,"South San Francisco, CA",247,52,25,2.0,9/29/2016,"One of the worst cheesecake factories I've tried. The biggest thing is the food, right? I ordered the smokehouse BBQ burger and it was layered in oil. The bun was super oily, the patty seemed like it would be tasteless without the bbq sauce, and overall I felt like my arteries were clogging after a bite or two. I don't expect to have a healthy meal here but I do expect the actually be able to enjoy my burger without feeling disgusted with the amount of oil.  To add to my dinning experience here, our waiter almost never checked up on us and we had a hard time flagging her down whenever we wanted more water or anything else. We were also never offered more bread (which I love at cheesecake factory).  i'm very disappointed with this establishment."
Jaime F.,"Antioch, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2017,Worst experience ive had in a while. I tried calling for online order and kept me on hold for over 30 minutes i ended up giving up. The people answering the phone could not give a clear reason as to why it took so long.
Kathy L.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/25/2017,"This rating is not for the food but the service. I called in for a pickup (avoid the long wait) and it was done on time. But the gentlemen who does takeout really could care less about service. I asked for bread and he said, no problem I'll get that for you after you pay. After I paid, he proceeded to help the next customer. I had to ask again and where he then asked someone that get it. I asked for my cheesecake that I ordered and he said it's coming. He proceeded to two more customers and then just pulled a slice from the refrigerator behind him and put it on a bag and gave it to me. If that's all he needed to do then why didn't he do that in the first place. No reason for me to wait for three customers to order. Really, just an example of caring about completing a payment transaction but no interest in finishing an order."
K C.,"Burlingame, CA",1,18,19,1.0,6/25/2017,Waited 15 min at a dirty rable no service in bar  only to see two peeps cruse up to bar n order
Emma A.,"Daly City, CA",4,3,1,3.0,12/5/2016,"The food is not bad but customer service at the take out counter is terrible - uggh!!! One of the staff unlocked the door at 11:00 but did not open the door for me, and just ignored me like he did not see anybody at the door waiting! The service of the cashier at the take out counter was so horrible - no smile, no greeting, and no thank you!! I waited and waited for my order to come - It was all ready, but she did not give it to me until I asked if that was my order up on the counter.  I am not recommending this restaurant.  I wonder where these people got their customer service training from?"
Amee D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2017,"I wish their service was as good as their cheesecake because then it would be worth coming here. Each time I have come here with friends we are forced to wait to get seated in an empty restaurant, then once seated the staff continuously walks by without stopping by to check on us. Usually a 20-30 minute wait after being seated to get someone to take out order. We had to ask a waiter to take our order and after doing so she seemed bothered. All the staff does is sit around talking to each other and it's great that they like each other but they should like their job too maybe then they would actually do it. Always a disappointment coming here which is a shame because the food is so good."
Nerissa D.,"Daly City, CA",92,146,885,5.0,4/15/2015,"Cousins are visiting from out of town and they wanted to try Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter Jared was very attentive. We asked our bread to be toasted and he was very accommodating.  We had appetizers but they were all eaten before I can take a pic. We had crab bites, shrimp roll and of course fried mac n cheese.  All the food we ordered were awesome. Portions were huge so if you're not hungry share a plate.  Red velvet cheesecake to share was awesome! Definitely recommend this place."
Raina F.,"San Mateo, CA",1,9,2,2.0,6/21/2017,"I was going to give 1 star but had a nice waitress, Marilyn. Everytime i come here the host/hostesses are messes or rude. This time, I let the hostess (Female, long light brown hair and colorful tattoos on her chest) know my name as I walked in. She kept mispronouncing it after i had repeatedly corrected her and bc the wait tends to get long i didnt want someone else to mistakenly get called. When i corrected her the 3rd time she snapped in perfect flat English, ""Well I'm from Germany."" Did i ask? What a poor way for customers to be greeted, and sad that the first face you encounter reflects poorly on the business as a whole. Btw utensils always have old food so if you go here make sure to check em before you use them!"
Ben T.,"Burlingame, CA",6,9,,5.0,5/28/2017,"Went for brunch, it was amazing chicken and waffle Benedict was super good and the brullee French toast was the best French toast I ever tried do far, definitely be back for Sunday brunch"
Chocoolate I.,"San Francisco, CA",0,468,752,3.0,6/27/2017,"The place is alive at night in the bar so it is a good place for a drink and small plates. Drinks are expensive (a kettle One is $12.50 but they give a decent pour. The chicken taquitos, fish and chips and Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets were excellent. Beware that the recommended gratuity on the bill allows for a tip on the bill plus the tax not just the food items so do your own math, The server (Kayla) was excellent!"
Mike L.,"El Granada, CA",613,115,,5.0,4/23/2017,Sitting at the bar with my gf its all great cocktails here. Large glasses and all and food portion is big. Fast and lots of great service. By the time we ordered our food it took a max of 5-10 mins. Great tasting food along with cocktails too.
Peter R.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,30,20,3.0,8/10/2016,"I was planning on visiting the Hillsdale mall to purchase an item that only this mall had.  I contacted the Cheesecake Factory to see if they allow dogs to dine at the restaurant, this way I can plan my schedule ahead of time instead of searching around for restaurants that allow dogs.. Surprisingly, they said yes. Caresse, answered my call and advised me to contact them 1 hour ahead of time, this way they can guarantee me a seating as it gets busy sometimes.  I arrived, and the girl who looks stoned, with a nose piercing said, ""There is no seating for you as there are no servers.""  I walked out, and contacted the restaurant by phone to ask for Caresse, but another person picked up. A female named ""Andy"" picked up and stated that there is seating for us if we have dogs, but it will take about 15 minutes.  I did my shopping at the store nearby and thought ""15 minutes? I don't need to check in first..."" I did my shopping and went in to check and the stoned girl again said ""we don't have seats for patrons with dogs."" I advised her I called twice, once for Caresse and another time with Andy. She then said it'll take about 25 minutes to get us seated. I thought.. ok. 45 minutes later, I went up and asked her, ""What is taking so long?"" She advised me that there are tables that have been there for 3 hours... 3 HOURS! And she is not sure when they are leaving. So my 25 minute wait was going to 50 minutes soon. I asked if there is a way I could order to go, and she just told me ""not here, over there."" No compensation for time wasted or anything,  The manager, who was standing next to her at the time, then told me he will serve us himself as he felt bad we waited double the predicted time. He advised there were 4 call-outs on waiters/waitresses. I felt bad.  Honestly, I'm not an impatient person if you try to make things right... At the end, I felt good that the manager did serve us personally. However, I wasn't quite happy with the other staff in the restaurant.  I paid my share and tipped well since I felt bad for the manager having to deal with the stress of having unreliable staff... I know how you feel Chris.... I deal with unreliable personnel myself... Although I didn't get a discounted meal, I'll probably come back here... but not for a while.  Glad this restaurant allows dogs to dine with their owners."
Marny N.,"San Francisco, CA",55,98,675,3.0,1/26/2016,"Artichoke dip: This was hella good. Tastes like the one you can get in a huge container from Costco for $10, which is still hella good lol!  Fettuccine Alfredo: the blandest fettuccine I've ever had. This dish was seriously lacking in the salt department. I even asked for tons of grated Parmesan on top but the pasta itself was still incredibly flavorless. It wasn't creamy/cheesy-- isn't that what alfredo is supposed to be all about?  I was extremely disappointed. Even I could've made a better dish with a pack of pasta from target ($1.15) and a jar of pre-made Alfredo sauce ($4). Smh. I know better now.  Fish & chips: now this was OVERSALTED. How is this possible?! Bland pasta and super salty fish n chips?!?The fries were soo salty that the bf & I couldn't even finish half and fries are our favorite food so that's saying something. The fish itself was just meh.  Godiva chocolate flourless cheesecake: pretty sweet but super noms if you have a craving for chocolate.  Cucumber lemonade: super tart & refreshing. My fav part of the meal..... Like actually.  On another note, my server was super friendly and had a great attitude so that made the meal more enjoyable. Shoutout to my boy Z! LOL. Too bad the food was kinda lame. I'll come back for appetizers & drinks but the main dishes here always seem to disappoint."
Rocio E.,"Redwood City, CA",44,3,,2.0,6/20/2017,"I was here for Father's Day and I ordered the shrimp and lemon garlic pasta. My daughter and dad ordered filet mignon. I've been here many times and I feel that the quality is deteriorating. The pasta didn't have any lemon or garlic flavor and the shrimp was covered in pepper. When my dads steak was served, the vegetables were missing from his plate. Also, they didn't get steak knives. 3 months ago I brought my mom and both of our pastas were salty and my brother's burger arrived 30 minutes after our pasta was served. I thought that it was a bad day and thought that Father's Day would be different."
Laura C.,"Novato, CA",1,10,10,1.0,2/27/2017,"Wow I RARELY leave yelp reviews because really all I care about is food.. Lol and this place has good food! However I would only recommend getting takeout. THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED EVER. I get that places can have off nights but based off the reviews it seems like this particular restaurant has a rude, lazy, poorly organized staff. I would describe them all but it would take me too long because there was not one employee in that restaurant that I would even consider hiring if I were an employer, so if you walk in wondering which ones are a*****les, it's all of them.   It started out with simple things such as not greeting us politely when we walked in, then our waiter would take 15-20 minutes at a time between checking on our table filling water and bringing our food. We pretty much had to flag him down or stare at him until he noticed us every time we needed something. He forgot one of our entrees and then completely disappeared 10 minutes later we finally flagged down another server who told us she would go get a manager, then a manager came and told us he would figure it out then left, then our server came back and told us he would bring out the order fresh but by that point everyone was done eating so we asked for a box and guess what they didn't box it, another random server brought out the dish and when we asked him to get a box he never came back with one.. it just kept getting progressively worse. We waited so long for our check we had to get up and again seek out a manager who told us he would find our server and then just never came back.. then our server messed up our check. Twice!!!!!!!! the worst part about this insensitive manager is that he just walked around carrying a drink in his hand (non alcoholic) talking to the other employees who all looked like they didn't give a f**k about their job. It still took another 15 20 minutes to get out of that place and I have never been so disappointed by restaurant staff in my life. Seriously we were at this restaurant for over 2 hours.. never come here. Just get takeout."
Roderick T.,"Daly City, CA",23,32,353,2.0,1/8/2016,"I like the Cheesecake Factory.. this one in particular, not so much. Went here for dinner last Wednesday night, just to hang and grub with some of my family. I usually go to the one at Macy's in downtown SF, but this location was more convenient for everyone that night. It took a while for us to get seated, about 40 minutes or so. That was a bit annoying. I assumed there wouldn't be too many people out since it was a weekday. Perhaps folks are still on holiday. As we were seated, though, I noticed a lot of open tables. I'm thinking maybe they were understaffed that night. For the sake of brevity and comprehensiveness, I'll go through my qualms via bullet points. - Bread. First things first. Hook us up with dat bread doe! We got our drink orders in quickly enough, but didn't receive our basket of baguettes until our libations were ready. We need some of that light sustenance to keep the hunger pangs at bay! - Drink orders. One was wrong, plain and simple, another was way too sweet, and the wait time for all drinks to be served took longer than usual. My cousin ordered a margarita, and she was presented a mojito. All coo I guess since our waitress realized her mistake and got the correct order in. My sister, on the other hand ordered the strawberry lemonade, and she didn't receive it until well after the first two cocktails were delivered. Really? And to make matters worse, the beverage was entirely too sweet, even after diluting it with water. She eventually had to order a different drink midway through our meal. - Food. Overcooked, slightly burnt, and a little salty. My sister and girlfriend both got the Bistro shrimp pasta, and in both dishes, the shrimp were slightly overcooked and burnt. Normally the battered shrimp are golden brown crispy, but this time they were visibly darker brown (even in the dim lighting) and chewy. My girl also commented that the angel hair pasta tasted bland, and she had to constantly mix the plate in search of more flavor. I ordered the meatloaf dish, and found it to be a little heavy with salt. To be fair, it is a hearty dish, and the flavors are meant to be bold, but I was only able to eat one slice of three, and only a portion of the mashed potatoes and gravy. It made for excellent leftovers, though! My cousin ordered the Hibachi steak, and though it appeared burnt upon first inspection, it turned out to be fine. Again, the dim lighting didn't do any favors. 2 stars = ""Meh. I've experienced better."" The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant after all. This location is simply not my favorite. I prefer the one in downtown SF. Protip: Learn from our mistake! If you're in the mood for a sweet, non alcoholic beverage, try the frozen iced mango, if you don't mind slushy drinks. We used to get this all the time when we were younger. It's no longer served in the tall, slim glass of yesteryear, but it's the same tasty drink. Make it a strawberry or cranberry frozen iced mango if you want the added red swirls!"
Dan Z.,"San Francisco, CA",577,12,9,5.0,4/23/2017,"This is probably one of my favorite chesscake factory location, since they have a Tesla supercharger nearby..=) on april 22nd, @11:50pm I call to order togo..and the associate put me on hold for 10mins totally forgot about me, so when I called back she apologise and said we open at 11am. I drove to the store, its 12:05 am now the stores/kitchens closed..I met the Craig/store manager told him his associate handled the situation unprofessionally and he went in the back and made what i wanted...also check back with to let me know how long it would take for my food arrive..Craig is a real professional, I wish more people would be like him..."
Peter G.,"Modesto, CA",1,258,41,3.0,2/7/2017,I guess people come here for the atmosphere. Over crowed and over priced. This used to be a good place to hang out with friends. Food is okay. Go Across the Street on Santana Row and find a better place.
Nancy C.,"Belmont, CA",51,227,2191,4.0,3/18/2016,"Reviewing only for their cheesecake.  We were hungry for dessert and wanted cheesecake, so decided to come here.  We were not disappointed!  The many choices they offered was a bit overwhelmed, but decided on two most popular cheesecake:  Raspberry Lemon and fresh Strawberry.  Both were very good.  You can really taste the flavor of the raspberry and lemon in the cheesecake.  As for the fresh strawberry, the cheesecake was so creamy and tasted great with the fresh big strawberries that were on top of it.  Definitely hit our sweet spot!"
