Cathy N.,"San Mateo, CA",2,3,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"Poor customer service, we went there  on Easter Sunday to have lunch with my family, receptionist  was rude & not accomodating. We waited for an hour , they dont try their best to find a table to accomodate us & the kids , even though we saw some vacant tables outside. We just leave the place coz they were not helpful. I wont return to that place again."
Joseph M.,"Burlingame, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/24/2017,"If negative stars were an option that's what they would receive. This particular Cheesecake Factory has been going downhill for some time now. It used to be a great place with great food but the past year or so the service and overall quality of the food have been horrible. I use to eat here once or twice a month, not anymore. The last time I ordered food, they forgot to input my order, and I had to wait an hour for them to remake my order. I decided to give San Mateo Cheesecake, one more shot but sadly I was disappointed again. I was on hold for over 20 minutes, once I finally spoke with Dori. I expressed that I was very unhappy with the wait and she gave me some BS response that she was busy.  When I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food, she wasn't busy at all, she was standing at the register doing nothing. I don't know if they have new management or what, but whoever's in charge of this restaurant needs to be fired. I've had crappy service my last two visits, therefore, I will not eat at this location ever again. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!"
Christy N.,"Hilo, HI",100,24,8,3.0,2/19/2016,"My first visit to this Cheesecake Factory I probably would've given it 2 stars being that it took 10-15 minutes to be offered water or anything to drink. Then once the bread came it was cold and hard. The stuffed mushrooms were not good and halfway warm. Also, got food poisoning from the bow tie pasta dish I had. This most recent visit, the server was a bit more attentive. Stuffed mushrooms were way better, and came out fresh. I ordered the Coulotte Steak this time (to avoid eating any pasta that may have food poisoning potential) and that was very flavorful."
Lisa W.,"San Francisco, CA",106,183,1089,5.0,7/2/2016,"Always wanted to try this place because of their well known cakes and dishes. I only came because my cousin wanted to celebrate my birthday earlier and today was the day where everyone was free and not so busy. This location is located next to the mall so it's very crowded around dinner time because ya know, everyone is hungry. Wait time was 45 minutes which wasn't so bad considering on how many people were waiting for a table as well. We got a booth because we had over seven people(eight later on) and we got down to ordering right away. The server was super nice(forgot his name) but he was our server till the end of our stay. We got our drinks and free appetizer aka bread and butter within five minutes... woo!! Since the menu is so grand and so many to choose from, I was super indecisive if i wanted pasta or if I wanted a rice/mash potato plate(it was definitely going to involve some carbs tho ha). I ended up going with my first choice the Cajun jambalaya pasta(linguine pasta w/ shrimp,chicken,peppers, and diced tomatoes). Everyone's food came within ten minutes or less which is amazing considering on how packed this place was. Their portions are huge so you really get what you pay for. After all my pictures and my shenanigans, I got down to eating since it smelled/looked so good. The taste was what I just expected as what it described on their menu. It was the perfect amount of salt with the right amount of spicyness which wasn't too strong to handle. After eating my plate that I literally shared with almost everyone, we ordered one slice of tiramisu cheesecake aka my favorite. The cake looked way too beautiful to eat but it's really good and it's not the type of cheesecake where all you taste I cheese, you really taste the flavor they say it is. Overall the service and the price point you pay for the portions are awesome. I think this is the restaurant to come to if you're looking for something better than Oliver Garden with almost the same prices and a better flavor to their food. One con was that the food was a little too oily for my lips and tongue, I had to constantly wipe my lips down haha. Definitely a great place to come and enjoy with your family/friends!!"
Sandra S.,"Pacifica, CA",57,16,14,2.0,4/10/2017,At first waiting to be seated was great. The hostess Jessica had is waiting only for 10 mins and we were seated. Then later after being seated it was good. I got my plate and probably 6 bites into I found a piece of hair in my food. They took forever to bring the check.
Jennifer D.,"San Francisco, CA",22,16,35,1.0,12/17/2015,I wish I could give this place 0 stars! Not only was the service horrible they gave us a lot smaller portions on dishes we order quite often and not in a timely manner. Cheesecake is normally crowded and the bar was far from being packed and we had to wait over 40 minutes to get our food which came out cold and unfulfilling. Our server did not offer any bread and the manager even came over and was just as incompetent as his staff. I come here for a lot of my company lunches and I must say I will definitely refrain from coming back here in future.
Phil M.,"Belmont, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/28/2017,"A chain location well past its prime, this one suffers from inattention to every aspect of the experience. Poor hosting, worse waiters, mediocre and inconsistent delivery against menu favorites."
Alka C.,"Burlingame, CA",22,17,15,1.0,6/14/2016,"I LOVED this location when it first opened but lately, the service sucks, my order never comes out right, and the food is nothing close to what I expect when I'm paying $20 a dish. Not to mention, I FOUND A HAIR IN, and I mean WAYYYYY inside, MY CHEESECAKE. I understand how busy restaurants get, there is sooooo much pressure that falls onto waiters nowadays. But mess up my food once, and I'll let it go. Mess it up twice, it'll effect your tip. Mess it as many times as The Cheesecake Factory in the Hillsdale mall, and I give up hope on you.  The managers are super friendly but that DOES NOT make up for bad service almost every time I come in here (and I'm here at least once a week!). Every time I dine-in, either my utensils are still dirty, the water cup has lip stains on it, the waiter puts chicken in my pasta that I ordered specifically because it's one of the only ones without meat, or the table isn't ready by the time I'm seated so I never actually receive napkins or silverware or small plates for bread.  I finally hit my last strike with them when I bought some cheesecake slices one night to eat at home (because I figured: ""how could they mess that up??""). MISTAKE to even ask myself that question considering there was a looooongg HAIR that I didn't even find in my cheesecake slice until I was more than HALF done with it. It kinda just popped out from under the whipped cream that sits on the slice of cake. The cherry on that vomit flavored cheesecake that I almost puked up after pulling the hair out of the slice is that all I'm getting in return is a $10 gift card TO CHEESECAKE FACTORY. And I won't even get that until 10 business days or so. To sum it all up, I'm a saaaaaaaaad panda that I can no longer come to this location without feeling totally grossed out."
Anup T.,"San Mateo, CA",13,3,,3.0,7/3/2016,"Not a good Cheesecake Factory. Service is on par, but food is not. Not quite at Cheesecake Factory level. Atmosphere is open, pleasant, just wished for a higher-end experience. Even the cheesecake slices were not as overwhelming as I remembered. Was let down by this particular one, but all together I did not have a bad time there with my wife. We live a walk away so we'll inevitably be back, just not often."
Cathy S.,"San Francisco, CA",3,1,,2.0,5/22/2017,"Long wait and slooow service! People came after us and we're seated before our party. The service was so slow that i had to chase down another waiter to get the check. Asked for more bread, ran out bread. Ordered a  regular coke soda, tasted liked diet soda. Requested the Peppermill for my salad, never got it. Will not come here again!"
David D.,"Hayward, CA",2029,247,1265,4.0,10/29/2015,"The food really isn't the reason to take off stars for a Cheesecake Factory review (I mean it's arguably some of the best chain food you can get with huge portions); it really boils down to service and location.    This location is really good and bad for a few reasons.  It's bad because it's near the mall (which makes it crowded), on the corner of a busy street, and the service is a bit shoddy.  During my visit, we had to wait nearly 10 minutes to be greeted after being seated, and this wasn't good because we were starving and thirsty.  I've been here before and a similar thing happened.  You can navigate the crowds by coming at opportune times: Lunch on weekends, before 5pm on weekdays, and after brunch on Sundays. There's good about this location: It's near the mall, you can walk from across the street and park there (conveniently located by Barnes and Noble), and the food.   I know it may be controversial, but I love the food at Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe it's because I have a relative who worked here and I know the detail that goes into some of the food.  An example would be the lemon ricotta pancakes during Sunday brunch--they're fab and they serve them with real maple syrup.  I love the Crusted Chicken Romano (that sauce omg) and Chicken Fettuccini with Sun-Dried tomatoes but I think the latter has phased out.  My current favorite dish is the Cajun Chicken Littles (see pic); they're really great--the chicken is juicy and fried to perfection, served with mashed potatoes and corn/veggie hash.  I remember when they used to give you a whole ear of corn with this dish!  I guess they needed to increase profits.  Anyway, we also go the chicken n biscuits (see that pic too); they also recently changed this dish--perhaps now it's a little smaller and the biscuits are different, more corn-like and less classic buttermilk--so it's a negative in my view.   Finally, the other reason people come here, the pumpkin cheesecake. It's in season and it's awesome."
Paul A.,"Mountain View, CA",26,32,,3.0,1/10/2017,"This location is sometimes great, sometimes lackluster. I guess that shows what a difference it makes when you have good staff working. When they are on their game, I would say this is a great place to grab a bite to eat. Portions are very generous, reasonable prices, great selection of food, and nice ambience for a chill experience."
Dan F.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/20/2017,I love this place! Never had a bad meal. Love taking a couple different cheese cake slices to go because I never have room for dessert after lunch/dinner. Great place to hit up after shopping
Janet T.,"San Mateo, CA",3279,189,1,5.0,6/1/2016,"This is not my first time going to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  This might be like my 5th time eating at this particular one since I moved to San Mateo 11 months ago.  Actually, it is one of my favorite restaurants. I'm not typically crazy for chain restaurants but I think CF has a massive menu, the service is beyond good, and the ambience is relaxing and on point. I was recently having dinner at the CF with four of my best girlfriends. It was Bonnie's special birthday, and whenever it's any of ours birthday, we really have a good time. Since no reservations are allowed, we luckily only had to wait a mere 15 min for a party of 5 on a weeknight at primetime. We each started with a cocktail. I won't bore you with what everyone ordered....just mine. So here goes.... I had a. Cosmopolitan in a fancy glass. It was really tasty!  We ordered a couple of appetizers, since we each were ordering our own Entree.  One appetizer was the Avocado Eggrolls, it's Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion, and Cilantro Fried in a crisp wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. That was to die for!!!!  One of the stars of the evening. Our  second appetizer was the Crispy Cuban Rolls, Crispy wrappers Filled with Slow roasted Pork, ham, Melted Swiss Cheese, Pickles and Mustard. That was tasty as well, however just a little burndt on the ends. Our third appetizer Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip, a blend of Crab, artichokes, and Cheese Served Warm with Grilled Bread.  That was Excellent!  Our group can make a meal off the Appetizers Menu alone. For my entree, I had the Pasta Carbonara. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. I always order that, because it is ALWAYS Epic!!!!  I just love it. The shrimp that's added is perfection and the noodles are done just the way I like it.   The gals loved their entrees as well. Whoops...forgot to mention we had a couple of bottle of Pinot Grigio. Lol. For dessert, I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake which was so elegant. Thank god I didn't lick the plate clean. All the girls had different, various types of Cheesecake. After all, it is the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Our birthday celebratory dinner was perfect. CF did not waver at all. Excellence. Our waiter was a doll, so polite but not over the top. Will I write another review when I go back? Maybe. Doubt anything will change however. Its rare to find a restaurant that never misses a beat."
Penny G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,26,10,2.0,5/16/2017,"Food was very salty, they ran out of the chocolate bread and food came cery late. Plus it was mothers' day."
Sandy D.,"San Carlos, CA",3,72,3,2.0,6/15/2016,"Food: 4 stars Service: 1 star OMG - what has happened to my once-favorite restaurant?? The service here is so poor!  Our server last night could barely crack a smile - she got my son's order wrong (no cheese please) and after apologizing, the burger finally showed up 25 min later.  We had to continually ask for water refills (5 minutes later), ketchup (another 5 minutes), etc. etc.  It was a terrible experience.  Will not be going there anytime soon.   Management:  PLEASE fix the problems with your wait staff! It's inexcusable and such a shame - after reading many other reviews, it seems this problem is a common thread."
Mia K.,"Redwood City, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/25/2017,"My husband and I came for dinner on a Sunday night, our server Alvaro A. was terrible. We have always had good experiences at this cheese cake factory but this one was terrible. He only checked on us when we flagged him down; I was tempted to get my own drink from the bar. However, he had a grand time with the group of girls behind us, who seemed to be the new light of his life. Not to mention they cannot make a decent Tom Collins. He also was hard of hearing because I asked for another drink, my husband did not and both of us received drinks. We also had to remind him to bring our cheese cake to go. We didn't receive an itemized statement for our bill because we were fed up with waiting and just gave him our card."
H M.,"San Mateo, CA",1,58,,2.0,6/11/2016,"Not sure if the Host staff are inexperienced or just like to give attitude, less than zero customer service. The hostess first indicated it would be 1/2 hour, not bad for a Saturday night but then told me I would have to come back in 15 minutes to get a pager.  When I would return (I tried twice) she indicated they were out of pagers again. She would roll her eyes and take a deep breath when she spoke to me as well as others, like we were doing her a favor being there. There had to be six or seven ""hostess"" running around behind the desk, two of them were on their phones texting, one of them just stared at the computer screen and Miss Personality that I was dealing was slinging attitude.  Dozens of open tables, so either poor scheduling or no staff, we found a place at the bar and received excellent service from the bartender (that is the only reason I gave them 2 Stars) but it is a miracle this place stays open based on the initial experience at the hostess desk. The food is generally good and it was again today and I am equally as sure they could care less about a bad review given folks were four deep waiting inline to get in. Still sad to see a place with such poor customer service at the hostess desk get rewarded."
Ariel A.,"Redwood City, CA",0,11,,1.0,8/31/2017,"I got a to go order and part of it was the Thai Lettuce Wraps. When I got home and opened them, there were only 3 small pieces of chicken instead of six and none of the 3 sauces that it's supposed to come with. The complimentary bread was also missing, even though it was on the receipt. Then, I spent AN HOUR on the phone either waiting to be called back or on hold while someone tried to get a manager. I just wanted a refund on the wraps. Eventually I gave up because it was 10:30 at night!! Some of the worst costumer service I've ever dealt with, not going ever again. I'm going to continue calling until I get a full refund."
