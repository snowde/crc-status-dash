Jaskinder A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/8/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory multiple times and to many different locations and never been disappointed until now.  1. We called and ordered Curbside To-Go Service and when we arrived at the restaurant was told they no longer run food out to your car and you have to go in. This is absolutely fine, but when we ordered we shouldn't have been told this was curbside and services should be promoted appropriately. 2. We ordered 3 different sandwiches which are all meant to come with fries or a salad and they came with no side. 3. We ordered 2 cheesecakes and a black forest cake and we had to go back in for the cheesecakes, we didn't realize that the black forest cake was missing until we arrived home. The food and cheesecake was tasty as always, but at the end of the day we were paying for something that did not delivery to their normal high standards. It was quite disappointing and will definitely make me think twice about ordering take out from Cheesecake Factory again."
Thom S.,"San Diego, CA",0,47,35,2.0,5/6/2017,"Consistent decor characterizes the yellow walls, large light fixtures, high backed booths, and heavy tabletops.   Inexplicably long time for food to arrive after our party of 5 had placed our orders.  Another miss was toasted almonds were omitted from one entree salad even though we had not said hold them.  Turkey burger was savory.  Salmon was salted excessively, but a good size piece and not overcooked.   Dessert was a chocolate cake slice.  Disappointingly petite in spite of its $8 + cost."
Kevin N.,"San Francisco, CA",164,36,,3.0,12/29/2016,"With all Cheesecake Factories that I've been to, the menu is gargantuan, the food is okay (nothing great or disappointing), portions are large, and the cheesecake is great.  Great for groups that have varying appetites / taste as the menu has something for everyone.  Rarely will I go here for a meal, but rather for dessert."
Sev V.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/25/2017,This place has the most horrible customer service imaginable for any restaurant on earth. We were told 3 different things by 3 different people and were left waiting 35 minutes when we were told it would be a 10 minute wait. We were outright lied to by the hostess at the front.  I can't fathom why so many people come here. Never ever giving my business to this chain again and I strongly recommend you don't either.
Elysia M.,"Portland, OR",163,353,1322,3.0,2/26/2015,"So I wish I could give 3.5 stars here but a last, I can only pick 3 or 4. I decided to go with 3.  They have a large large menu, anyone can definitely find something here. In fact, they might have TOO many things! You get lost in the menu. it always takes me forever to pick something, but whatever I pick is usually good. Sometimes the food is veryyyy salty. And I like salt. Whenever I eat here, I always have to drink 3 full glasses of water at least with the food because it's  so salty! But it's also really good. The portions are quite large as well. My favorite part? The bread! and Cheesecake! They bread is sooo good, the brown bread is deliciously sweet. The cheesecake, well, it's called the cheesecake factory! The service, is iffy. I've been at this location a few times and sometimes I get a great server and sometimes I don't. It really is up in the air.  The place is clean.. but not immaculate. But It's safe. Overall, slightly above average. Not enough to make 4 stars though."
Kash D.,"New York, NY",15,266,317,5.0,2/16/2016,"I love cheesecake and The Cheesecake Factory never fails to deliver..  We got 2 slices of cheesecake : Low Carb cheesecake and Chris Chocolate Cheesecake with fudge and whipped cream.. Presentation and cut was great.. Taste was delicious..  The last time we went to SF for dinner, waited for 45 mins to be seated, it was full house.. Then 15 mins to take our order then another 20 mins for our meal to arrive.. After eating we were full already so we opted out for the cheesecake but the staff encouraged us to pick cheesecake of our desire each.. So we did, we thought of just taking it to go.. Then again another 15 mins waiting for the bill then here she came with our receipt and our FREE CHEESECAKE.. She said we need not need to pay for it as we waited long.. That was sweet and considerate.."
Will K.,"San Jose, CA",102,68,31,3.0,8/22/2016,"For some reason, the food comes out pretty good, the bad part is that if you have left overs--somehow, you get about less than half of what you ordered. Case in point. We ordered the pasta carbonara, it comes in a large dish. We made the mistake of eating a lot of bread and salad first so we couldn't really finish it. We asked to have it in a to go box. When we got it back, what was once a huge dish, ended up being in half a to go box.  Does that seem right?"
Aunggie N.,"San Francisco, CA",69,14,15,3.0,1/21/2017,I went to bought a Linda fudge cake. The cashier didn't give any attention to customer tho. Just keep talking with their co worker and let the customer with a long lines and waste the time to wait for. However I still like cheesecake here. Just need more quality of services.
Cheryl M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",319,1000,2185,4.0,11/15/2015,"Review for their variety of cheesecakes and fresh peanut sauce i buy from the take-out counter...I've had their food in the past and just think its okay but i must say it is pretty extensive with many options. Extremely busy from 11:30 - 1:30 but thankfully the cheesecake to go area is usually pretty quick.   Favorite cheesecake: tirimisu - chocately, hint of coffee...yum.  Mango is different but can be on the overly sweet side as it has sweetened coconut in the crust with some sweet mango 'jam' on top of the mango mousse with cheesecake on the bottom."
Deniz S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/31/2017,"If I could give a negative star I would. The food is mediocre at best, but the service is terrible, especially for takeout. The staff is completely incompetent. My food was 2 hours late and no one seemed to know what was going on. Cheesecake Factory needs to get their act together."
Brooke C.,"Chinatown, San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2017,"The worst customer service I've ever experienced at a cheesecake. The to go girls just sit and stare right through you and act like helping you is such a strain on them. I do not recommend this location at all, such a bummer because the food is great."
Mark O.,"San Francisco, CA",112,54,3,1.0,5/8/2016,"Went here for mother's day and had the worst experience in a long time. The reason for this review is an incredibly rude waitress named ""danielle/daniella"" if I recall correctly and while the manager did a great job in trying to right the situation, I don't think he understood how rude one of his staff members were. Here is a brief run down of what happened (I will shorten ""Danielle"" to D for the sake of brevity): 1) D starts off normally, we were all smiles and excited to eat after a long wait, which is normal at the factory. She takes our order, leaves and all seems well. Cool!  2) Comes back after a bit and says, ""What did you order? I forgot."" Okay, no problem! I repeated my order and said it's totally cool thanks for clarifying.  3) We ordered 2 drinks, one hot coffee and one iced coffee. She brings two iced coffees. We say, ""sorry but we ordered a hot coffee and an iced coffee"". She doesn't say anything and just takes the wrong order back. She seemed angry about her own error and me being anti-confrontational, I apologized to her when she came back since she had to go through getting the right order. ""D"" ignored this. Furthermore, we actually felt bad to ask, but she forgot cream and sugar so we asked for that too. At this point she seemed to be losing patience. She asks, ""You two want MILK or CREAM?"" we were like ""ermm I guess both?"" I mean, we must be pampered brats if we want cream and sugar with our coffees right?  4) She comes back with even more simmering frustration and drops the creams without a word. She never offered water so I had to wait to flag her down just to ask for a couple of iced waters. I asked almost timidly at this point b/c Im assuming she's having a REALLY bad day and I'm trying to give her a pass. She responds, ""I'll get to you"" in an angry tone. At this point we are really questioning why D is so dismissive and angry at a mere request for water. She could have just said, ""sure"" and I wouldn't have thought twice about it. Instead it was more like, ""leave me alone, how dare you make me correct my orders and NOW YOU are asking for waters TOO?""  5) D waitress comes back with, surprise, only 1 water. She is teaching us a lesson that we were acting spoiled when we wanted creme and sugar with coffee. Now we need to make do with only 1 cup of water. She drops it off again without eye contact or saying a word. I'm still trying to be nice and said, ""Thank you, I appreciate it"" and this is met by a stonewall of silence and D walking away. Now we are moving from timid confusion into full fledged indignant anger at paying to be treated like an unwanted vagrant in this fine fine establishment that manufactures cheesecakes.  6) Manager comes in at our request and was very apologetic and polite. However, it seemed like he was just saying sorry in general and didn't really acknowledge how poorly Miss ""D"" was treating us. He offered a glass of wine which we refused but appreciated as a gesture and said he will have a chat with ""D"". He did a good job based on how steamed we finally got at that point so he (I think his name was Chris?) has no bearing on this negative review. We appreciate him trying to make things right. Conclusion: ""Danielle or Daniella"" was such a rude, resentful, and angry waitress that we are never coming to this branch again, despite our general favorable opinion of Cheesecake factories in general. If this particular waitress is fired, hopefully nobody will go through such a random episode of poor treatment."
Yuka N.,"Brea, CA",316,441,1699,3.0,8/23/2015,"My 300th review is on this particular Cheesecake Factory.  This place is located in the Hillsdale Shopping Mall.  It was very busy even on a Sunday night.  I'm from LA so it was kind of difficult for me to find it, even with my GPS.  I've been to many other Cheesecakes but this one will always hold a special memory in my heart.  I finally got to meet someone (his name is John M).   I've been chatting with him on Yelp for few months.  To make the long story short, we shared a Dulce de Leche cheesecake, had coffee and a great conversation.  (Btw, the waitress that was serving us was super slow.)  Him and I are no longer Besties anymore and I won't be going to this Cheesecake (it's out of the way)."
Andreea M.,"San Francisco, CA",26,165,185,2.0,6/9/2017,"It almost seems like a waste of time to write a review of this place since most people (in my opinion) have a similar experience here. CF is hit or miss. It's a convenient location next to the freeway and an easy stop if you're shopping at the mall or running errands in the area. I've been to this location many times and those two scenarios are usually what brings me here. Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it's not. I have complained and asked for a manager on a couple of occasions due to extremely slow service, errors in what was ordered vs what was delivered, dirty plates and silverware, etc., Today (like many days) the service was extremely slow and we had to ask for everything (refills on beverages, napkins, bread). BTW we arrived right at 11:00am when the restaurant opens and at the time we ordered we were the only people seated in the whole section. We waited and waited and waited for our food and when we got it, it was mediocre. My pasta was dry. I asked for more marinara sauce on the side and the waiter brought me ICED COLD sauce in a dish *rolls eyes* I'd like to say I won't be back, but I know I will... sigh"
Ari V.,"Daly City, CA",8,18,2,5.0,2/8/2017,Jennifer L. at the bar is awesome! She was so attentive and kind. Highly recommend coming here for their happy hour specials.
Nikie R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",98,42,192,1.0,12/17/2016,"I ordered the lemon shrimp pasta on the ""skinnylicious"" menu and I am disgusted by what was on my plate. First off, the angel hair pasta noodles were sticking to each other, I could literally pick up all the noodles by sticking my fork in and lifting the entire pile of crap. Second, there was no sauce on the plate except on the shrimp. Third, the shrimp was de-veined but clearly the black disgusting threadlike intestinal tract was on all the shrimp (check out the picture I took). Fourth, the shrimp was overcooked and had a rubbery consistency to it. I told the waiter and all she could do was say ""I'm sorry about that."" She was nice enough to grab more sauce to add to the pasta. The best thing about this meal was the bread and butter they serve at the beginning. Never coming back to this place again. They need to re-think who ever is cooking at this Hillsdale location because this plate was not worth $18."
Momo C.,"San Francisco, CA",21,15,3,1.0,5/28/2016,"Is this how you serve your customers? With burnt shrimps...very unprofessional and very disappointing! If you burnt the shrimps, don't try to hide them in the pasta and serve to customers. We are not dumb and blind! I rather the chefs take longer to redo the shrimps than be served burnt shrimps."
Phoebe T.,"San Jose, CA",362,491,606,1.0,8/11/2015,"I'm writing this review as I continue to wait for service. I've been here for 15 mins waiting for a staff member to take my order for the curb side service. Let me rewind back slightly... I've initially called them and was stuck listening to elevator music for twenty minutes. I gave up thinking I'll have better luck if I go straight to the source. Negative. The staffs for the curb side service are overwhelmed, while three normal staffs stood around chatting with it others. It's ridiculous how they don't shift or transition their employees to adapt with the environment.  After 32 mins, Eliana finally took my order. She looked distressed. Hopefully management will read my review and change their workflow process to be more efficient for both customers and employees.  Will I order takeout from here again? Only if I have an hour to go shopping or time to kill."
Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1546,2068,30593,3.0,8/28/2014,"Not sure why I'm able to say this, but somehow tonight was my first visit ever to a Cheesecake Factory.  Overall, I was pretty impressed. There were some hiccups with the service, but some nice rebounding by the staff smoothed things over. A soup I ordered never showed up, but it eventually came out at no charge. That was nice. Salad dressings ordered on the side with two entree salads didn't come out with the salads, they came 5 minutes later. And my son's toast was very oddly toasted - golden and toasty one one side and white as a New England snowfall on the other. But the good points of our visit here were very good indeed. The opening bread basket  (light and dark loaves) was terrific. The menu is gargantuan, and CF gets bonus points for having such a varied menu including a lot of calorie friendly Skinnylicious choices. And then of course, there are the desserts.   I had a cup of the tardy Enchilada Soup and it was terrific- chockful of tomatoes and cheese and tortilla strips. I had a Skinnylicious Chopped Salad with blue cheese and chicken- it was great and pretty darned big. We had three slices of cheesecake -a blueberry/white chocolate, an outrageous chocolate, and Snickers. Yes- they were fabulous. Our server was wonderful, polite, courteous, and quick to remove the soup from our bill. That was a classy move. Our dinner with desserts ran $70 and we felt that it was a great value since we hauled a lot of the meal home for midnight snacks. In summary, it took me a long time to get into a Cheesecake Factory, and it is clearly A-OK."
Renee P.,"Pacifica, CA",81,127,154,4.0,8/24/2015,"I've eaten here quite a few times because I enjoy the food, especially the cheesecake. My boyfriend and I frequently get cheesecake to go, he can only eat the low cal one and its his favorite go to dessert.  Best time to come for dinner is around 5, we had no wait on a Saturday night. Might be early for some, but this place can fill up fast!  We love the calamari! And they recently added a some  new items under a ""super foods""category.  They were salads with the foods that contain a lot of healthy antioxidants and vitamins. I tried the falafel kale salad with grilled chicken. It was delicious, and I didn't need the added chicken. The portion was big, and I couldn't eat too much after the bread and calamari, but it kept well for the next days lunch. I usually enjoy their skinnylicious menu, but the falafel salad caught my eye and I'm glad I tried it.  Service was fine for us this trip. Liz was nice, kept our drinks refilled and we got our food in a timely manner. I think it all depends on the time you go."
