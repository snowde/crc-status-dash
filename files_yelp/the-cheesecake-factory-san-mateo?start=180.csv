Rose A.,"Daly City, CA",368,622,3017,3.0,12/29/2015,"This location is usually not as busy as the Union Square location in SF, but the wait can still be pretty lengthy. Service is decent and the food is pretty good. They have a huge menu; sometimes it's hard narrowing down a choice but there's something for every type of palate. The best part of their menu is...the cheesecake! You cannot dine here and not have a slice. From plain to fruity to chocolatey, I'm sure any flavor you choose will be delicious."
Alex Y.,"San Mateo, CA",17,2,2,1.0,3/12/2017,"Worst experience ever! I ordered to go. When I arrived, the cashier told me to pay for my order. I paid it, then she let me just wait. After I paid, she  just kept ignoring me and gave other customers order. I waited  more than 10mins, then she asked me"" are you come to pick up?"" WTF? Freaking kidding me? I stood RIGHT FRONT of her for 10mins.  Then, she gave me the order which was already finished about 5mins ago. By the way, my order has a steak!!!!she don't even give me the knife what am I supposed to do? Eat it with my hand? I will never make a Togo order at Cheesecake Factory!!"
Morris V.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,5,2.0,8/23/2016,"I don't recommend ordering whole cheesecakes from here. They keep them frozen and you are unaware how long they have been in there. I received my cheesecake in a damp box that seemed to be falling apart and frost all over my cheesecake. They warned me before purchase that it would be frozen, but I didn't think it would be in such terrible condition. Eating here is great, but I would definitely go elsewhere for things like this."
Jennie K.,"Washington, DC",95,263,455,1.0,8/27/2015,"Honestly, if I could give this Cheesecake Factory 0 stars, I would. It's honestly a disappointment every time I come here. Every server I've had has been slow and unprofessional. I've had instances where the server would forget my meal (when it's just me and one other person), and bring out appetizers before the entree. I always try to avoid one server. I won't name names on my review, but this person does not seem to have a good reputation. I usually request to not have her serve me, and it seems as though some hosts have given me a look of agreement.  I can't blame the chefs for anything, because food is pretty good, but I am not coming back here unless something miraculous happens with the rest of the staff. The servers here would be better off working as a telemarketer for microfiber sponges or something, because they're all irritating, and too incompetent to actually deal with people face to face. This may sound harsh, but I take this restaurant chain seriously. The one in San Diego rocks, but this one always disappoints me."
Michael R.,"San Leandro, CA",22,17,3,1.0,12/20/2016,"We were sat and sat for 15 mins waiting on our server, nobody came.  I had to flag down the waiter waiting another table and asked who our server was and he went ahead and took our order.  There was no more brown bread available which is what we love here... for a franchise that seems to always be packed with customers, i do not know why they would run out.  They should make more than enough for the night for the amount of customers they get and some.  Very disappointing..."
Paul H.,"Mountain View, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/3/2017,"My friend and I had food poisoning after eating here on January 26, 2017. Maybe the crab wontons? Too bad, because the food tasted good."
J C.,"Daly City, CA",1,58,9,2.0,10/25/2015,"Cheesecake Factory: Waited one hour to be seated. We finally got seated,  awaiting a few dirty silverware.  Shouldnt this restaurant have to check for quality before putting it kn the table? If i have to pay $20 a plate, i would think that they do quality check.  It took me 5 minutes to finally got a hold of a server to have the silverware replaced.. then when he return, it looks like he just went and rinsed it out, given the silverware were wet. Im just assuming. Order up: we ask 5 waters to begin with,  we got three glass.. its been 20 since i ask for water, i havent got it."
Jaymie G.,"Redwood City, CA",141,144,17,4.0,7/5/2016,"Not sure why everyone that comes in has a ""30 minute wait"" no matter the size of the party. Came here at 7pm on a Friday night. I did expect it to be busy. But hey if you give me a time frame I would expect that. 45 minutes later and I get told ""we're waiting for someone to clean the table"". Just tell me it's an hour wait and I would be fine! Thankfully our server Jackie (not sure if I spelled her name right) turned out experienced or around. Thank goodness for someone with such a great personality. It was her first night there and she made a couple mistakes but was quick to apologize for them. First days suck for anyone at any job but she really did great at making sure our food order was fixed. Not to mention she had such a great way of handling situations. People like her still give me faith in great customer service at establishments!  Also the manager, I didn't catch his name, very accommodating!  I remember I was there for my birthday a couple weeks back and the same girl up front told us it was a 2 hour wait... Turns out they forgot about us and when I went up 2 hours later they never had our name on the list. But he fixed it right away when the girls up front tried to tell me it was going to be another 45 minute wait."
Doug H.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,20,,4.0,8/15/2017,"Great food and service.  A bit pricey, but I got two meals out of a ""lunch.""  Good stop on a busy shopping day.  Entire family enjoyed the experience."
Cesar H.,"Hayward, CA",0,55,2,1.0,8/6/2017,"I just don't like their food , I tried different locations, different dishes and it comes flat, too greasy or no flavor, the cheesecake are usually good. Service are slow but fine."
Leslie M.,"Chicago, IL",22,51,,4.0,1/22/2017,"I wish I could give 5 stars BC the food was really great. We ordered, stuffed mushrooms(so so good, fresh caps filled with cheese and some type of marsala) avocado toast (ahhmazing as well), spinach dip annnd Mac and cheese bites. Noshing! Lol. Everything came out delicious and picture perfect but our service was poor :( !! I went 90% of my meal without the initial iced tea ordered, we waited about 25 min to order.... I was told the server went on a break so there must have been some miscommunication..."
The San Mateo K.,"San Mateo, CA",33,11,2,1.0,3/25/2017,"OMG , tried to place a Phone Order at 7:22 pm on a Saturday night and they could not even answer the phone. Called back and was told all the lines are blinking... Seriously?  I can't even place a phone order?  F**k this Place."
Jordan A.,"San Francisco, CA",11,11,2,1.0,6/24/2015,"It was my first time to The Cheesecake Factory...it will also be my last. I want to review this place from an unbiased point of view, but I fear that the experience I had will make it difficult. Our visit came on June 23, 2015 at roughly around 6:30 p.m. When we asked one of the three hostesses at the front how long it would take, she told us it would be approximately 25 mins. Not a terrible wait time considering it's around dinner time, even if it is a Tuesday. We decided to wait and the hostess have us our little pager.  While we were waiting, one thing we observed was that the hostesses weren't using the pager to notify people that it was their turn to be seated. Approximately 45 mins passed before my wife decided to ask one of the three hostesses how much longer we'd have to wait. The hostess told us less than five mins. By this point my son was getting really hungry. Another 10 mins and 15 people getting seated passed before my wife had to once again inquire how much longer it would take to be seated. The hostess callously states to her, ""In a minute."" We were finally shown to our seats without a single apology for the wait time and when we got there, the entire row was empty...seriously? I understand that this restaurant my be short staffed, but almost an hour of waiting and you have literally 11 tables all empty?  The saving grace was that our waiter was pretty nice. He came by often to check on us and refill our waters. But he was the only good thing about this experience.The food was bland and dry, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a day. I think ballpark food is handled with better care than a place like the Cheesecake Factory. How do you mess up pasta? The Cuban wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  Needless to say, I'm used to passing the Cheesecake Factory when I visit Hillsdale Mall, but the wonder of what it is and how the food is is now gone. Big Bang Theory steered me wrong."
Pnina E.,"Monterey, CA",47,6,,1.0,4/16/2016,"Asked for a gluten free pastas, got a regular pasta! I was lucky that I could tell the difference and after asking they verified that the pasta is regular.  This was after 30 minutes waiting to be seated,  another 30 minutes until the waiter came to take our order, and another 30 minutes until the food arrived.  Waited again for them to remake the pasta, but eventually got the wrong pasta again!!!  Returned the food and left the restaurant hungry.  Horrible service ever."
Andrea L.,"San Mateo, CA",2,41,,4.0,7/2/2016,"Been coming here since they opened. Service and food always meet our expectations.  Though it's mighty late, I want to give a shoutout to our server, Emmy. I hope she's still working there, but if not, I hope she's doing well. She gave us excellent service and was attentive to our needs, even before we realized we needed them. She had a pleasant demeanor also.  I tell you, food may be great at any restaurant, but the service is the deciding factor whether we come back or not. We'll keep coming back."
will c.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,,2.0,11/27/2016,I don't have high expectations of the food... I know it's factory food. My complaint is with the ambiance. I'm all for mood lighting but its so dark I can barely read the 50 page menu. Management of you are reading this please turn up the lights! You can afford it.
John L.,"San Mateo, CA",65,20,,1.0,1/3/2017,"Terrible service. Super slow. I had tea with my food. When I was out of hot water, I asked for a refill. I had to ask again, and again. This restaurant 's managers are not managing.  Got a response to my review. The verbiage is the same one used in other responses. Apparently a canned response. Lame."
Rachelle Jen L.,"Daly City, CA",24,4,1,1.0,5/8/2016,"Michelle, the host at the reception desk, gave my party the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. By far. This review is specifically for her. My party arrived at 11:40am and we weren't seated until 1:30pm because of Michelle. When we got there, we were told that our wait would be no longer than 40 minutes. 40 minutes passed and we checked on our table. They said that the party seated at the table designated for us had already paid and they were just waiting to clean it up. Another 20 minutes passed, so we went to go check again and Michelle gave us the run around, saying that people were ahead of us when in reality, we were there the longest. Just before that, they said that we already had a table. All of a sudden, we don't?! We waited another 10 minutes, all the while Michelle is talking about us to another employee with us within earshot. Disrespectful. Another employee came and asked if we have been helped and we told him not really because Michelle was of no help. Within a minute, we were seated. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Michelle targeted us and purposely gave our table away because she, for some reason, didn't like us. We just wanted to have a nice Mother's Day lunch and Michelle ruined a good 2 hours of our day."
Jennifer R.,"Oakville, Canada",27,133,43,3.0,10/19/2015,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to a few locations in the area, all with great food, but am giving this location three stars based on service.  Our server was very friendly, but he always seemed to be standing near the bar chatting with the other servers. He rarely came around or asked if we needed anything, so I was left to go to the bar myself twice. Once to ask for ketchup and once to get drink refills. He never apologized when he saw me standing at the bar and didn't make a point of coming around to see how we were doing after. Disappointing since even at the most busy locations such as downtown SF, I have always had superb service. The guac is my favourite thing ever. It is made to order just the way you like it. It's not packed too full of ""stuff"", so you can actually taste the extremely fresh avocado. Chips are great too, never stale. It is always a must when I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.  This time I had their cheeseburger. The thing is HUGE! I could only make it through half and took the other half to go. It hasn't been frozen and is cooked just the way you like it - I ordered mine medium rare and it was perfect. I got mine with a side Caesar salad which was also good.  The bread was brought to the table right away and our drink orders were taken soon after we sat down. No issues there.  The hostess could have been more friendly. We went during lunch and had to wait about 20 minutes. No smile, no real greeting, just a straight to the point number. It wasn't a deal breaker, but not what I'm used to. This particular location is in the Hillsdale Shopping Mall making it very busy on a regular basis. There is lots of parking close by and they offer curbside pick-up which I think is great.  I will be returning based on the food alone and it is very close to home, but I would prefer to go to another location if I have my choice."
Amy K.,"Foster City, CA",19,126,24,1.0,10/10/2015,"Wow!  That was just about the WORST service ever!  Got there at 4:30 pm. Place was empty, but for a party of 7, we were told we'd have a 10 minute wait.  30 minutes later, our host took us to our table only to discover that it was dirty and not ready for service. He found us another table on the total opposite side of the restaurant that was totally empty. While it was set for service, the table was visibly dirty and sticky to the touch. And several of the utensils looked like they hadn't been washed.  After another 10 minute wait, our unsmiling waitress took our orders. Our food did not come out for another 30-40 minutes. After our food was served, our waitress did not come back to check on us except once right after our food arrived. We needed drink refills and ketchup refills, but there was no one in our area to ask for help. She finally came and took care of our needs.  The food itself was typical Cheesecake Factory food. Nothing special. Your average run of the mill food. The fried calamari was too greasy, as was the fried asparagus that came with the steak dinner. Meh...will not be going back to this particular Cheesecake Factory."
