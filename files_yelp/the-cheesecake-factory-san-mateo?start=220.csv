Josh G.,"Millbrae, CA",245,34,3,1.0,11/20/2016,"Most likely the last time I come back here. We got our table around 7. We already knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. We got the ahi appetizer, fish tacos, and the hibachi steak. 15 minutes go by, then 30, then 40. We were told several times that our food would be out shortly but we waited about 45 minutes till we got our appetizer. Even the manager came out and apologized but basically blamed the kitchen and our server for forgetting to put our order in. A full hour and we finally got our food. It came out okay but not worth the wait. Didn't get anything taken off the bill or anything for making us wait so long."
Valery T.,"San Mateo, CA",136,59,34,2.0,3/23/2015,"Ugh I've never had such a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory! Well let's start with bread they bring out in the beginning, I was so excited to indulge in that yummy bread! But when it came out it was cold and hard, let's just say I took one piece and that's it... I usually order the Louisiana chicken pasta, and it's usually absolutely amazing. But yesterday during lunch hour it was absolutely horrible... Didn't even have a spicy kick to it and it was just so bland, the chicken had like no flavor. I even tried adding some Parmesan cheese to kick the flavor up a little and well, nothing. Our waitress was alright.... Just alright. Probably won't be back for lunch here. Saw the general manager going around to many tables, I'm guessing I wasn't the only angry and unsatisfied critic.   -Val"
Cindy M.,"Santa Clara, CA",135,141,125,3.0,6/24/2015,"Came here for a birthday dinner, party of four. We had to wait 25 mins but they had one of those pagers to let us know if our table is ready, so we were able to walk around the mall.  As we sit, I whispered to the hostess that someone in our table is having his birthday. We got our bread, but less variety than what I would get at Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory.  I got the Ahi Tuna Salad ($17.85). For the price I felt like I was being ripped off. My salad was just tomatoes, spinach and 6 pieces of tuna. Not even patatas,... My friend who got $14 pasta got way more stuff than I did. I felt like the ratio wasn't balanced.  Anyways, I thought our hostess forgot abt the birthday. Only untill the end that they came with a small ice cream thing with whip cream and candle and sing the birthday. That's right, folks. They DON'T serve free cheesecake anymore for birthday peeps. Service is super slow today... Our waitress was nice tho! So thanks"
Johnny B.,"Menlo Park, CA",41,46,6,1.0,11/13/2016,Most disappointing meal I have ever ordered. I ordered a jambalaya it came via door dash with no sauce barely any meat unspiced  bell peppers. Just dry stuck together noodles horrible taste like dish water. I ended up just throwing it away. And it took forever to get here. Beware cheese cake factory it was like getting robbed. Will I ever do it again? No never again and will post this on every social site I can and tell everyone I see how horrible my experience was for as long as I can.
elena d.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,1,2.0,3/24/2016,I have to agree with another feedback about service and food quality inconsistency. It's almost every time something is wrong with food or order. Today my sons chicken strips smelled like calamari !!! And he hates Seafood. By the time they made another portion my son was staffed on bread and sleepy to eat anything. I usually order Tuscan chicken and once I had a raw chicken served ! Yum... Not! Fries is often over salted. Service is super slow. I like some dishes but every time I come I feel some sort of disappointment and wonder was the visit worth the price we end up paying?
Matt C.,"San Mateo, CA",174,12,4,2.0,2/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory's menu needs an agent and a publisher. It's biblical in girth. So you would think that in all of those pages, you could find something you'd actually want to order. Some signature dish. Some reason this restaurant exists. But guess what? Not really.  The food is perfectly, completely fine. Just fine. Not a review any chef will ever tack to his wall and celebrate.  Maybe it's because the menu lacks anything approaching originality and the selections are equally overpriced. It is interchangeable with The Elephant Bar, in fact, another restaurant without any recognizable style or take on cuisine. They both delight in serving acceptable food in atmospheric environments. Good. Great. That's enough for some people. And I have come back to The Cheesecake Factory several times because it's tucked inside the Hillsdale Mall and therefore conveniently located when I'm shopping with the family. But I won't be going back any time soon.  Let me paint you the picture of my final visit. It's noon on a Wednesday. The restaurant isn't yet crowded -- it will be; I'm convinced San Mateo's residents never eat at home -- and even so, my huge, untenable party of three must sit and wait for fifteen minutes while the staff prepare our table. Or continue Snapchatting. Whatever it is they're doing while they avoid customers. Our waiter is an inattentive millennial with black tribal earring plugs and a myriad of tattoos. He graces our table just once in 60 minutes; never stops by to refill water or soda, to let us know why the appetizers we ordered haven't come out, to ask if we need anything, or even to flip us the bird. He is a millennial phantom, disappearing into the ether along with our order.  About 30 minutes in, no appetizers delivered, I bet my wife that all of our food will show up together. 20 minutes later, it does. Except, half of our items are missing, including lunch for our six-year-old son. I can't even complain to our original waiter because he never returns; rather, he dispatches another waiter to deliver our food. When I inform her of our situation, she goes to fetch him, at which point he materializes one last time, says he'll remove some of the undelivered items from our bill, and then vanishes again without a hint of an apology. Not fine dining. Just ""fine"" food served by distracted doofuses. This franchise ain't special to begin with, and this location is especially stupid. Don't support it. Instead, drive to downtown San Mateo and walk around. The city has emerged as one of the best on the peninsula for great restaurants, particularly if you like Asian or Asian fusion."
Leo L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,22,1,2.0,9/11/2016,"Worst service I have experienced in any cheesecake. They tell you that you will be seated in 10-15 min when it's actually 25 min. When you are seated you wait 10 min for the server and after you order the food another 20-25 min until it arrives.  Overall if you have 2-3 hours available you can come to this branch, just grab something to eat before!"
Fiona L.,"Portland, OR",769,467,3323,3.0,1/18/2015,"Tis' one of those sounds nice, but not so great afterwards. I advise you not to come in a large party. No reservations and long waits for no apparent reason.  I was in charge of organizing a get together dinner for work (11 people). They do not take reservations, so I made sure to drive earlier and get a table for 5:30pm. I arrive at 5pm to have my name on. They tell me by 5:30 it should be ready. I'm fine with that. But the puzzling look I have was that there was plenty of tables available and still had to wait ... Well good thing I came early! We get seated at around 5:45. Our server took a while to get us our bread/drinks. I could only imagine the waiting because the place was starting to get packed and he was managing other tables. Between our bread, drinks, refills, entrees and dessert, it was pretty long. About 30 minutes every interval.  Their pasta dishes is a hefty size and delicious, too! Not sure about their other entrees because my coworkers weren't too excited about it. Price was a bit on the expensive side.  To sum it up, pasta was GREAT! Others, not so sure. Service was very slow .... and our waiter was forgetful. I don't recommend coming with a large group or during dinner."
Just M.,"Redwood City, CA",0,31,4,1.0,3/21/2017,"I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Jeremy when calling in to inquire about a large party for Wednesday 3/22 I was told ""we dont take reservations because we dont have to worry about filling our tables"" when I responded and told him how arrogant he was he said well it is the truth we are a busy restaurant. If this is any example of the customer service they provide they will not get my business and I will spread the word!"
Jacky C.,"San Mateo, CA",119,125,109,2.0,6/4/2015,"This place can be a hit or miss, and this depends on your server and what time you decide to dine here. There were times where the servers were attentive and the meal went smoothly, and there were times where we were neglected and it took an insane amount of time for our food to come out (compound that with an 1.5 hour waittime) which made the experience horrible. A friend ordered chicken with their pasta(cost extra) and they forgot to put it into the dish. After inquiring about it, it took an extra 20 minutes for them to bring it out. it might have just been an off day, but somethings are inexcusable.  The total meal time took over 3 hours(from waittime till the end of the meal) which wasted a huge portion of our time. However, The portions on the food are pretty decent and the cheesecakes are delicious, but for the price of everything, it might be better to choose a different restaurant for a better dining experience.  I have also experienced their happy hour. The appetizers averaged $5.50 and the portions were good.  The drinks however were really watered down. The tuna tartare was good, but they gave very little. We also tried the Buffalo blast, crab and artichoke dip, and the happy hour burger. All were delicious but all greasy, so if you are a health nut, I might steer clear of this place. I would say I will eat here again, because I live close by. But if I had to travel a distance just to eat here, I would advice against it."
Kristin P.,"San Bruno, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2016,"Our meal was late coming to the table in the bar area. Our order was messed up by the kitchen twice, and the ladies  bathroom was so unclean, where two toilets could not flush because they were stopped up with poop, ( which is a biohazard by the the way!) no toilet paper in 3 of 4 stalls, and paper towels where none to be found, and the staff at the front was so rude when I mentioned these situations,  that I would not consider eating at this place again.  The server did not charge us for the 2 items that were messed up on the order, which was so nice, but the staff at the front were ridiculous! This makes me wonder how desperate Cheesecake Factory is in hiring millennials who don't care and have no people skills whatsoever! Do they even wash their hands after visiting the restroom or after they serve  specific types of food? Management might need to grow up and consider this!!"
Treci M.,"Northridge, CA",99,67,52,1.0,12/27/2016,"Horrible service, food was served over several minutes which means either u eat alone or your food is cold. Asked several times for dressing for the salad took 15 min.. epic fail"
Bernard A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,25,27,5.0,10/31/2016,"The 5stars is for this visit only.  Honestly, their service is typically terrible and slow and inattentive and uninterested.  We came back because we have guests from out of town who wanted to try the cheesecake, so came here to eat.  I was pleasantly blown away at how awesome Dominic was during our meal.  He came by and made sure we had what we needed and very personable.  Well done Dominic, the rest of the staff could learn a thing or three from you."
Genevieve M.,"Berkeley, CA",123,82,30,1.0,12/15/2015,The service was horrible. We had ordered a medium sized cheesecake... which keep in mind majority of their cheesecakes are kept frozen and then distributed in boxes and handed to the customers.  We waited... waited... 30 minutes passes and we were getting impatient an hour passes and we remained waiting... it took an hour and a half to receive a FROZEN cheesecake in a beat up box.  TERRIBLE. never going to this location again.
Toni E.,"San Francisco, CA",20,15,5,1.0,8/13/2016,Found plastic in the calamari. Manager apologized and asked if we want something else. I said sliders would be nice. He reversed the calamari and charged us for the sliders! Not very good customer service. He should have comped the sliders as well since we waited an extra 30 min for them.
Fran S.,"San Mateo, CA",196,33,271,5.0,1/30/2015,"I love living so close to this place!!! Best place if you're looking for a safety, they never disappoint! Finally tried out their skinnylicious menu for once since I go here so much, and I have to say, it was delish! I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich and I actually finished the whole thing! I have never ever finished a meal at the Cheesecake (and I'm in no way complaining about this). But it was nice to see that there are items I can eat and finish without feeling overly full. Definitely will be making many trips back :)"
Astrid D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,52,2,2.0,4/11/2016,"Been here a dozen times and since it's a chain well the food was good-okay. But this time service was a big issue... When we first got our name on the list I ask for a high chair, once we got our table it took the server 10 min to bring us one to the table.  The table was dirty as was the floor. The glasses of water dirty we didn't even want to drink off them.  Food came fast and was good as always.  After we finished and we were on our way out we were walking through a narrow aisle and we were half way through and one of the hostess walk in and said EXUSE ME! she was in a rush to get another family to their table and I had to drag our stroller just so they could go through, why not wait? Literally 5 seconds.  The table next to ours refused to sit cause the floor was filthy, took servers 15 min to come and clean.  I honestly think servers and hostess  need better training, some are rude and careless. And for the love of God use clean glasses."
Justin S.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,2.0,6/2/2016,"I was really disappointed here. I usually order some chicken strips deluxe and they are usually good but this time around you can feel and taste that they were old and sitting around.  I ordered to-go and waited nearly 50 minutes for my food and even the employee there said to me, ""oh you still haven't gotten your food?""  I got home and was starving but to find piece of crap food. I ended up giving it to my dog (even he was disappointed).  All in all, the service and quality of food suck here. Really disappointed."
Jaimee G.,"CA, CA",123,60,7,1.0,1/22/2017,"if it wasn't for my niece's birthday request, i would never come here! it all started on a bad foot with a horrible hostess followed by a 2-hour wait; she would've saved us much anger and frustration had she took the time to tell us the best time to come to cheesecake with a big group,  when we passed by the day before to ask if they took reservations. cheesecake factory customer service sucks! your hostess sucks!"
Martha T.,"Daly City, CA",134,1,,2.0,2/12/2016,"I understand that Friday nights are usually busy. However, my boyfriend was told that the wait time would take 45 mins. No problem right? 1.5+ later and we still are waiting.  We left to the mall and came back to check our placement in line. The waitress at the service counter told me that I was 4th on the list. Moments later, 4+ groups were buzzed (they all were in the waiting area).  Isn't honesty the best when it comes to customer service? Apparently it doesn't at this location.  So no it wasn't an expected 45 mins wait. And no I wasn't exactly the 4th in line. Not coming here again."
