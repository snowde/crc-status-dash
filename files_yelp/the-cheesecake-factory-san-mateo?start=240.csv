Crystal C.,"South San Francisco, CA",451,224,184,4.0,10/24/2015,"Ever since I was 11, my favorite restaurant was cheesecake factory. For my birthdays every year until I was 17, I went to Cheesecake Factory with my family and friends. I even remember one of my first dates with my first love way back when, was at Cheesecake Factory.  But I know this is a big corporate company, but food is food!  The service at this location is superb. I never have had a complaint about any server.  Food is always consistent, I always get the pasta, crab cakes, and calamari. Always perfected.  But just a good restaurant overall, but can easily get busy so definitely go on an off day, or an off time."
Loren S.,"San Francisco, CA",30,83,5,1.0,2/21/2016,"Incredibly crappy service tonight.   Placed a take out order, showed up to pick It up.  They had one overwhelmed girl trying to do takeout and serve cheesecake.  Waited 15 minutes to just get to speak to her to pickup my order (which was placed 20 before I showed up to stand in line ).   She runs away says nothing...only come back and say 'well we are busy tonight trying to pack up a lot of orders'...with a wonderful attitude.  And, of course...mine still isn't ready. I gave up"
Nichole M.,"San Jose, CA",112,72,21,4.0,2/27/2016,"Dined here tonight, had a long wait- not their fault. Staff was very nice, manager was very helpful. Had an issue with our nacho's but it was dealt with immediately, great customer service. Thanks Cheesecake Factory"
Regina L.,"South San Francisco, CA",386,64,300,4.0,3/29/2015,"Wowie, this place is really popular! I came here with my family of 4 on a Saturday night around 7:30pm. They told us the wait would be 80 minutes, so we went shopping in the Hillsdale Shopping Center while we waited. They called us in after 60 minutes, so that was a pleasant start to the night.  The unlimited bread was really good, especially the brown bread when it was warm and fresh. We refilled twice. We ordered four entrees and one cheesecake. We got the Chicken Bellagio, Renee's  Special, Factory Combination of Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon, Hibachi Steak, and the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake. The Renee's Special and Chicken Bellagio had very big portions! The food was very good and we had a lot of leftovers. Personally, this cheesecake was a little plain for my tasting but maybe it was because I was already full from dinner, so I couldn't fully enjoy the cheesecake.  The service was okay. We didn't much attention because the place is pretty busy. However, our food arrived fast and we got our bread refills but we never got refills on water."
Gary I.,"San Bruno, CA",25,1,,3.0,5/7/2017,"I especially love their meatloaf.  Even though it is a little pricey, you get three slices and big portions of mashed potatoes and succotash.  I guess I called to place a to go order during their busiest time on a Sunday since even though I waited on the phone for ten minutes, when I called back and informed them I was told it might be 15 to 30 minutes.  Also, the last time I ordered even though I asked for bread, it wasn't included with my order.  I was told that I would have to wait 10 minutes."
Shi Shi P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,224,15,5.0,12/21/2015,"We came here an hour before closing and were seated with a smile. Our server Louise was so wonderful at letting us enjoy our dinner with out rushing us out of the restaurant. We ordered fish tacos, and cheesy fries. Our family ordered margarita pizza which they enjoyed. They also give you really yummy bread and butter. Louise really made our dinner a great experience. Great service!"
A B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,58,2,1.0,8/4/2016,"Got a take out and asked for a cheesecake with no whip. Got a sludge of cake with melted whip on top check the picture. Always verify your take out I guess. Call the manager and he is like, ""so what do you want me to do?""  No apologies. Says bring it back and I'm gonna refund the money ... Like I'm gonna drive up to get a refund. Post Cheesecake Factory's reply: I went back to the same restaurant again, my experience was horrible a second time. It took me three calls to order food here, because the bakery put me on the hold and hung up on me twice. When I told the front desk that this happened twice, they were like ""yeah I am telling them not to dot it, but they keep doing it"". When i finally reached someone who was willing to take my order,  I ordered the chipotle pasta with extra sauce on the side and a Tiramisu cake with no whip. I checked this time to make sure that the cake did not have whip on it - it didn't. But, when I came back home, I realize there was no extra sauce with the pasta - and to make things worse the person who took my order probably imagined that I wanted all the sauce on the side. So there was literally no sauce it the pasta, it was sautéed without sauce. I tried calling back and speaking to the manager, but after getting hung up on twice, I gave up on it. The last time I spoke to a manager at this location, they were pretty rude - so there is no point in wasting more time. Well, I guess if you want cheesecake factory, go to palo alto. The management here needs to be fired."
Joy E.,"San Mateo, CA",39,21,1,1.0,9/7/2016,"Whenever there i order fried macaroni balls but today they came with a giant wad of cream cheese inside, it was gross. 2 of them had it and 3 didn't and they couldn't say why...summer rolls had a hard crusty wrapper as if sitting in fridge too long. Waitress was kind, apologized, but clearly new as she was fumbling a bit, she took food off my bill and had them recook macaroni balls. (They were delish)She came later and said kitchen owned mistakes of wraps out long and wrong recipe for balls. WTF? 2 mistakes? Manager never came over...hyymphh. THEN witnessed the busboy clear a table and set the table complete with a decorative fold of napkin then silverware. Never washed his hands. Gross Xinfinity!"
Taylor H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",630,20,8,3.0,6/14/2016,"Waited too long to be seated. Host and manager walked by many times before we were helped. Luckily, the food is good."
Nasir S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,16,13,2.0,6/29/2016,"Wow this is bad! I sat at the bar and the two stars is because the bartender was attentive. The food was horrible. I got the soy glazed edamame and some fried cheese. The edamame tasted like it was steamed in a dirty towel and the cheese was luke warm dog crap. I didn't complain because the bartender was nice, and I had to leave. The Cheesecake Factory in Oakridge mall is good, but this one needs a new kitchen manager."
Kevin J.,"San Carlos, CA",0,5,2,2.0,1/1/2016,Waiter was bad.. Food was OK. So my expectation for the cheesecake was almost non existent. Haven't been in a Cheesecake Factory for about a year.. I see why.
Sophie P.,"Dusseldorf, Germany",224,346,68,1.0,9/6/2014,"Wow, the worst service I've had from a cheesecake factory. Not sure if the server we had tonight was lacking significant intelligence or was very new on the job/ bored and wanted to go home. From beginning to end: 1) was seated at a booth (yay food) 2) waiter comes about 15 minutes later- we weren't even offered water or bread (we're  still pretty hungry) 3) we see tables start clearing out but waiter nowhere in sight with water or bread. (now we're fucking famished) 4) finally asks if we want water or bread-- since the waiter was so late we decide we're just going to order everything on the spot. By this time, 35 minutes passed we finally get water...15 mins later our waiter comes back over to tell us ""somebody deleted your order"" uhm. NO. we CLEARLY SAW YOU TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE at the booth in front of us AND LAUGHING with them AND WHAT NOT--- NEVER PUT IN OUR DAMN ORDER. 5) 1 hour later, we finally get our food....by another waitress who happened to serve us most of the night and the other waiter comes by once to see if we're okay. I hope the tip we left was given to the nice waitress who helped us throughout the night. Dear lord that was the worst service ever."
Joe C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,15,,3.0,10/16/2016,"Let me start by saying that overall I love the food here.  I was tempted to give this place 4 stars but decided against it for 2 reasons.  1) Even though, for the most part, the food here is awesome, there is an inconsistency.  Both with the preparation of the dish and the overall flavor.  Sometimes i find my food a bit overcooked and dry while other times it has way to much sauce.  Sometimes the flavor is right on while other times the sauce tastes bland and flavorless.   2) The service has been progressively getting worse.  The wait time is never to bad, but once you have sat down and ordered it can be quite a while before you get your order.  On occasions, we have been sat at a table without linens or silverware and had to remind our waiter several times before having it brought to us. Again, it pains me to give this place 3 stars because i really do like it here,  but it is what it is."
Jenny M.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,16,7,5.0,1/1/2016,"This review is for new year eve dinner. The 5 stars is for the service. (My food was a 0 out of 5)  The line to hold a table was out the door and there was only ONE guy working the desk. At first I was irritated but as I observed him handing people reserving tables AND handling the ones who's buzzer rang I had to give him props. Not one time did he look overwhelmed, he greeted everyone with a smile...even the grouchy ones. We waited about an hour and he remembered our name with ease. He told my partner how short staffed they were and apologized for the slow service.  Our server was sooo sweet and was really attentive. Food: my food was nasty, I usually order the Louisiana pasta but choose the spicy cashew chicken instead, and who ever cooked it thought they were slick turning all the chicken around so the burnt side would be at the bottom. I didn't bother eating it or asking for another dish because I ate off my partner and sons dish. If they were so short staffed or busy I would've complained."
Ariel E.,"San Francisco, CA",65,43,363,3.0,1/27/2015,"Happy hour portions are the same as regular portions!  The fresh spring rolls were hard! Dislike Buffalo bites were chicken fried buffalo wontons! Liked the crunch, disliked all the oil. Roadside sliders were standard. Liked Warm asparagus salad came with fried egg! Liked The bread is always yummy. For happy hour I like the Cheesecake Factory."
Alyssa C.,"Daly City, CA",283,224,186,4.0,1/10/2014,"This location has great service and the food always comes out well presented and tastes good! For the appetizers, I've tried the hot spinach and cheese dip, and the asian lettuce tacos. Pretty good, but the dip was watery towards the end.  Ive tried the fettucine alfredo with chicken,  louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken madiera. All 3 were very tasty! The portions are huge so it'd be smart to just split it with someone.  And I've tried their red velvet and dulce de leche cheesecake, both are AMAZING!  Overall, everything is good which is why I keep coming back!"
Marlui A.,"South San Francisco, CA",16,91,29,1.0,12/10/2015,"Tonight was the worst. If i can rate ZERO I would. Used to go here alot. You're service is getting worst every time I go here.   Only reason I was here tonight cuz my colleague wanted to try CCF. Otherwise I won't be here. Lmao, really!!! First our drink buzzz incorrect. Second my fries never came. I ask for no onions but of course I got onions, no one pays attention. I have a chunk of onions, tomato, pickles and shredded cabbage (?). No mayo n special sauce on the side. I got mayo!! I ordered a burger ( shredded raw cabbage instead of a lettuce). Was a bit confused, was I suppose to make my own coleslaw for the burger. I ask for well done I got medium. Raw in the middle. OFreakenMG!! Not done yet.  Our server's name is Reid. He offered a salad to go cuz the fries never made it, "" they're still growing the potato"". It's spring lettuce mixed n dressing on the side. Are you F'en kidding me!! Nothing else is in the salad but mix lettuce. Got it, I'll go to Trader Joe's for cherry tomatoes, croutons, cucumber, corn and cottage cheese.    My colleague order spaghetti w/ meatballs, his comment was "" bet if I threw this meatball across, the glass wall, will shatter"". The fork slides down, overcooked, hard as a rock!    Best advice, I can give Reid. Either learn the restaurant product or quit.  If I have to pay $79.82 + tip. Shouldn't I get a decent meal. Its been so long I haven't eaten in McDonald's, tonight I thought we should have gone there instead n won't cost me over $20 and taste better by far. Its so sad."
Lucy L.,"San Mateo, CA",17,162,330,4.0,10/11/2015,"Good food but long wait for a table. They don't take reservations and unless you get there for an early weekday lunch, be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour and a half! Good thing this place is located inside Hillsdale Mall so you can walk around while you wait. If you have young kids, the wait can be miserable. The waiting area is usually crowded. Once you get in though, the food is decent and pretty good and the service is usually fine. Extensive menu. I like the salads and some of the specially dishes. My kids like the pasta. Their alcoholic drinks are quite good. Not a cheap place so don't let the fact that it is a chain restaurant in a mall fool you."
April Z.,"San Francisco, CA",439,176,180,1.0,8/16/2015,"UPDATE: it's been 5 hours since I've eaten, and I have an upset stomach and probably minor food poisoning. Wonderful, thanks Cheesecake Factory. You've just earned a zero in my book.  ------ Came here on a Sunday at 5 and the place is packed. The servers were super busy. Anyways, we were served bread and butter and when we took a bite of the white bread, we noticed mold in it.... EW. So we asked the server to take it back and we thought we'd expect something for this mistake of theirs, and we got nothing... Not even new bread or some kind of complimentary anything.  Food was so mediocre.. We ordered the warm crab and artichoke dip, pasta carbonara, and the mushroom burger. Everything was beyond average at best...  Probably not going to come back here again."
Daniel W.,"Mountain View, CA",79,12,,1.0,5/11/2016,"This is the single worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service is terrible and rude. One time I ordered from their park and go service, food never came. I literally called them every 10 minutes for an hour and they kept saying its coming, never came."
