Richard Y.,"San Mateo, CA",1,50,23,1.0,9/6/2015,"Nothing worse than lousy service for expensive, mediocre food. The waiter knows who he is. Totally sour, no apologies for missed stuff and downright inattentive. -we asked for sour dough bread, he said he'd bring it but never did. -ordered a burger with salad and it came with fries. And boy was the burger tasteless (and I usually complain if it's too salty or sweet, so you can imagine this was 'yuck'.) -ordered a cheesecake for my kid and after 20 minutes of waiting, she went to the counter to find him chatting with his buddies. ""Oh it's sitting on the counter"", he later brought it over with a sour face, no apology. -had to flag him down to get the bill, and he never came back till I stood up and did a ""Giants baseball wave"".  I understand if one is tired, but when you pay $80+ for dinner for 2 and a kid, I expect more. If one hates ones job go do something else buddy. Our kid really likes the place, but now we just need to go elsewhere or buy cheesecakes to go. Ain't worth the usual long wait, pretty plain food, grumpy waiters......"
Julie L.,"San Francisco, CA",471,1078,2157,4.0,7/30/2014,"This is my go-to dinner spot w/ my GF after my dental appointments in Foster City.  We get seated relatively fast and the food is consistent. Gotta love that bread - so soft, fresh and supple. All staff are always perky and nice. The bill never turns out crazy."
Katie P.,"Daly City, CA",474,100,234,4.0,1/10/2015,The tex mex eggrolls is great! Appetizer menu It has spicy chicken plus some crunch underneath
Zach K.,"San Diego, CA",137,51,7,4.0,1/18/2016,Miso Salmon. Good. Chicken Bellagio. Good. But get extra prosciutto and extra arugula. BUFFALO BLASTS!  SUPER GOOD.
Vans C.,"Foster City, CA",224,65,60,5.0,7/26/2016,"I love the large portions here. I normally get the pasta because I can split it into two meals. They also offer really good bread. There's usually a wait time, even on weekdays."
Mary M.,"San Mateo, CA",444,76,22,3.0,9/2/2015,"This place has seen better days, that's for sure. I'm a frequent diner, but I'm going to have to give it a rest for a while. I'm reading all the other negative reviews, and I'm going to have to agree because my last 4-5 visits have matched those experiences. I hope they pull it together soon"
Amanda B.,"South San Francisco, CA",176,3,5,2.0,2/14/2017,Worst customer service. Both their website and yelp states they take reservations & when I called they refused. They wouldn't honor anything & told me I had to show up and put my name in then. False advertisement!
Alayna's Momma S.,"San Bruno, CA",1,104,23,4.0,3/19/2015,"Came here with my husband today and we were seated almost right away, I forgot the waiters name but she was such a sweetheart. Brought us bread almost right away which was nice because the hubby was starving! Haha we had the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer which was so tasty! I ordered the chicken and shrimp plate.. That was delicious!!  my husband on the other hand was the unhappy one he ordered a steak and it was one small piece of steak and only came with fries. I laughed so hard when I saw his steak. It was so small.. He's shy, he didn't want to complain.. So he dealt with it.  I will definitely come again but steak won't be ordered :)"
Bob B.,"San Mateo, CA",13,6,,3.0,3/2/2016,"Just got home and the main reason for this review is to applaud our server Jarod, we give him 5 stars! Very friendly, got our orders correct (there were 6 adults and 3 kids) and brought the food to us while it was still piping hot - he even played with our 3 year old! The food was so-so. Burgers and steak were over-cooked, fish and chips were greasy, very little chicken on the nachos, the calamari was fine though - 2 stars. Btw, they DON'T take reservations."
Mathew J.,"San Mateo, CA",146,1,,1.0,4/26/2016,This place is like ghetto fancy. Which is like McDonald's saying it's gourmet. It prides itself on something it isn't.  This dude that waited on my took HELLAAA long. And only came back to gove us the check. The table next to us ended up complaining to the manager because of the poor service. I got the appetizer after I finished the meal. Dude charged me for something I didn't even get. I put this shit at the top of the list. The Schindler's List. This place is the 9-11 of fine dining.
Jeff C.,"Santa Clara, CA",20,13,5,2.0,7/31/2016,Talked with three people on hold for over 20 minutes and even after waiting to talk to a manager the order for a chicken bellagio is still not done after 25 minutes waiting!
Samuel S.,"Redwood City, CA",633,6,,4.0,4/1/2016,"Typically go here during the week with a buddy if I don't head to the gym after work. Our Waiter Anthony was great. Very courteous and was always available. Only issue was my burger, I asked for Medium and it was well done. Then, I found a long strand on brown hair inside of my burger. Total turn off.  I'm giving this place a 4/5 because of the server Anthony and typically, the food is very good. However, last night... I didn't enjoy it much. :/"
Sue K.,"Redwood City, CA",0,73,46,4.0,7/17/2016,"Despite all the bad reviews my daughter and I had a great lunch today. Our service was excellent and the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes was superb.  Cesar salad was amazing , something you don't expected in these chain restaurants.  I learned one thing sometimes people way to angry when they write reviews you have to try to believe!!!!"
Julie S.,"Foster City, CA",0,21,10,2.0,7/28/2016,"The service here is horrible....I love the company but this location sucks. The food is not as good as it is in other locations. Servers are not friendly or customer friendly, bathrooms aren't even kept up. And the wait is ridiculous, even for a Wednesday at lunch time."
John P.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/15/2017,"We were greeted by friendly hosts and were seated within 5 min. When we placed drink orders we ordered appetizer at the same time. After about 25 min we realized that we were not going to get the appetizer and because 10 minutes later out came our lunch. At that time I told the waiter to remove it from our bill. The food was okay, I wouldn't say it was great. Upon leaving we purchased 2 salad dressing jars that were in the front display, however we quickly learned they treated this sale like a ""to go"" order. We waited for over 20 minutes, yes 20 minutes before the kid behind the counter went to check on the order for us, he even said it was taking to long. When we did finally get our dressing the jars were not labeled like the one in the front  display and were wet with water (assuming they had to rinse the dressing off that spilled). By this time we felt that were were there for 2 hours. The service is slow, however they had quite of bit of people running around looking busy...I would not recommend going here for lunch unless you have time to kill and dont mind average quality food."
Meg P.,"Burlingame, CA",0,28,14,2.0,12/28/2015,"I ordered a piece of carrot cake with real cream cheese frosting through Door Dash, a food delivery company. While the server was quick and friendly, I could not believe what the piece of cake looked and tasted like! I opened the container, and there in a crumbly array was a thinly cut broken up piece of cake. The frosting was good, but the cake was dry and not fresh, like maybe it was made about 2 weeks ago, and then left under a heat lamp. The frosting was not melty so I don't think it was under a heat lamp, the texture was like it had been under a heat lamp though. Needless to say, I will not be ordering carrot cake there via Door Dasher. Maybe the restaurant feels that it can give you a dried up piece of cake through a delivery company, because you are not at the restaurant, and so can't complain and get a fresher piece."
Hannah C.,"Redwood City, CA",64,45,15,4.0,1/9/2016,"Came here for a family birthday dinner last night! Even though we kept gradually adding people and our party grew from 9 people to 11, our server - I wish I got his name - was so accommodating and made it work. He was enthusiastic, prompt, and had an imperviously good attitude. We didn't even tell him it was a birthday, but he noticed a present on the table and he brought over some servers to sing and they gave my sister a free ice cream! Our server also kept a keen eye out when we were low on bread or water and we never had to ask him for any. The wait as usual was pretty long (40 minutes) but for that peak dinner time on Friday and our group size, it was to be expected. Food was excellent. The Bang Bang chicken and shrimp wasn't too spicy which was great for my low spice tolerance. Chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was  f a n t a s t i c ! I really recommend it for chocolate lovers who don't want to overload on the chocolate."
Bel S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,21,2,1.0,2/5/2016,"I'm usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory, but this one needs some work. 2x I've been there they've messed up an order and taken forever to bring a replacement. Don't even try Curb Side pick up because 1. No one answers the phone and 2. When they finally do, you still have to wait 40 Mins in your car (in addition to the 30 they told you it would take.) not to mention the rude person who takes the order.  Seriously, if you can't handle Curb Side pick up, don't advertise it or hire more people so you can handle it.   Only come here if you have about 3 hours to spare for dinner."
Jean W.,"Fremont, CA",131,2,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"at first when we arrived, the waitress was very nice. my friend and i each ordered a pasta and an appetizer, i ordered a chipotle chicken pasta and it was not appetizing AT ALL. i didn't want to say anything in the beginning since the waitress was so kind (i was planning to just pay for it) but my friend insisted we say something to the waitress so we did. after that, the waitress gave attitude and said that i should've told her earlier. i hope  next time waitresses/waiters would be more considerate."
Cupcake 1.,"San Francisco, CA",2,81,14,2.0,1/6/2017,"I have come to this location several times. Last weekend I came here with my boyfriend and his family. The server seemed to not be in tact or aligned in what he was doing. We were seated but waited for the rest of our party only for 10 minutes...We then waited literally 20 minutes for our water, let me add he gave us hot water instead of cold iced water......Which, we never even asked for. I also asked for bread that never got there until 30 minutes later. He then forgot all about our red sangria's and appetizers! By the way that's the best drink there in my opinion! Back to the story!... then he came to our table and said I'm sorry I confused your guy's order with another table so they got your food, it's all ready the appetizers and food together, do you guys still want it? We said uh yeah sure. Then our food came and it wasn't even hot. It felt like it had been sitting out for like 10 minutes. It was the worst experience I have ever had there. I don't feel like coming here for a while now to be completely honest."
