Karah P.,"Hayward, CA",1,11,1,1.0,2/19/2017,worst place in the world. you call to order to go.. they say they're busy... you show up... and they're not!!
Era C.,"East Bay, CA",228,55,160,1.0,6/16/2015,POOR SERVICE!!! Waited 10-15 mins to be seated as promised. Sat down and it took our waiter 20 mins before taking our orders. Waited another 15 mins for bread & some water. Took 30 mins for our food to get there. Our server never checked up on us. I had to get up and ask for a to go box and check from the front.  would not come back here. very slow compared to other cheesecake factory.
Tatiana D.,"Downey, CA",51,27,11,1.0,6/14/2015,"Terrible experience. First off I  want to say that this restaurant has the worst management I have ever encountered. I get there and the girl in the front tells me to hold on for a few mins to see how long the wait will be, I probably waited five mins just for her to tell me the wait time would be 30-35 mins ok no big deal. Mind you there was maybe another party waiting so I believed we came at the perfect time. Five minutes later we started seeing a lot of families coming in one after another parties with the same amount of people as us seven. I decide to go to the mall and have my mom dad and sister wait, it's been 45 mins since my check in and when I come back my family is still waiting. They tell me they've asked and nothing has happened. I talk to the girl who originally signed me in to see what was going on she tells me that a table is getting ready and they're just cleaning it up and that it will be a few mins. We waited 20 more minutes and still no call. I go up to another girl working the front and tell her I'm upset that it's taking so long and that a few mins turned into 20 mins she tells me that the table is being cleaned AGAIN by this time I'm very irate and ask to speak to the manager. Chris the worst manager I have ever met in my entire life. He was extremely unprofessional, rude and egotistical. I approach him to let him know he tells me my table is being cleaned which apparently is their cope out for any waiting customer and this is pretty standard from what I can see. I tell him I didn't want this to turn into another 20 mins after all we did travel two hours just to come here. He never apologizes or even tries to make eye contact with me and stares at the computer screen the whole time. He says to me "" well I can check but I'll be walking away from you"" like.... I really cared for his company go check!!!! I wait by the waiting area after he told me to give him ""five"" minutes and to my disbelief he never goes to check on the table like he said he would. I time him. After 5 mins I went up to him and told him that it had been five minutes he sighs as if I was bothering him and proceeds to tell me to get my family and wait on the side when they finally sit us.  I don't know what was worse the manager or the super burnt meatloaf they tried to hide from me by flipping the meat over. Thankfully I took a picture so you guys could see. The waiter apologized and removed the plate and said he would involve the ""manager"" I told him it was fine to just let it go... You would assume someone would still come to your table and apologize but no.... Which was not surprising.  Needless to say I have never said that the Cheesecake Factory has great service since I've been to many different ones but this one definitely took the award for being the worst. Thank you Chris for ruining my sisters UC Davis graduation celebration."
J T.,"San Carlos, CA",0,22,1,5.0,3/1/2017,"Service is terrific at the bar, they have by far the best service in the entire Hillsdale mall and vicinity."
Denise L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3229,523,3736,2.0,10/7/2012,"A definite meh. After an evening of go-karting, we were all very excited this Cheesecake Factory was open late. Our excitement was met with last-string, very unenthusiastic waiters. I understand being tired and not wanting to serve a large group, but you can't let it show. The food was good as always, but the service was extremely disappointing. Let me give you a few examples. 1. My friend ordered the regular banana milkshake, specifically requesting the one with NO alcohol. He doesn't really like the taste of alcohol, so he wouldn't want one in a delicious milkshake, right? So what happens? His milkshake arrives, full of alcohol. When he informed the waiter of the mixup, she acted completely put out, like it was his fault for not being an alcoholic on the fly. 2. The ahi tuna tartare was not available. This was unfortunate as I had been really craving some. The waiter came back and told me they were out, but didn't offer a replacement suggestion or any other information. She just stood there. Finally I picked up a menu and randomly chose something else. 3. The credit card processing took freakin' FOREVER. When we looked over at the cash register to see what was taking so long, we saw the waiters standing around chatting and laughing, while our waiter held our bill in her hand. On the bright side, I discovered a few winners on the menu: - Spinach Artichoke Dip - Cheesy perfection atop tortilla chips. - Mini Sliders - Surprisingly delicious and a good-sized portion. - Papas Bravas - Crispy and tasty. - Asian Pear Martini - Wow! My friend ordered this and I had a sip. Then a few more because I had to make sure it was good. ;) The asian pear flavor is subtle and blended so well with the martini itself. My new favorite Cheesecake Factory cocktail. The tiramisu cheesecake was flawless, as always. TIP: Don't come here for late-night fun. You'll get the last-string waiters who really don't care. TIP2: You don't have to feel guilty about eating so much cheesecake! Order to go, eating several bites at the restaurant and the remaining portion at home. It keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days after purchase. Oh, guilt-free pleasure!"
Mendoza A.,"Seaside, CA",5,4,2,1.0,7/24/2016,"We have to wait almost for two hours for are table,and when we finally got it ,our service was really bad ,our food came out on waves of 10 minutes apart,my daughter food came out last after every body finish and they always gives us stupid  excuses why our food was taking so long,the managers really unprofessional person s,I know that's the reason they work there. This is my last time I go to this place and I hope this review make every body think twice before they try this place."
Jeanette M.,"Oakland, CA",202,248,396,3.0,6/20/2015,"By three stars I mean it's fine and even good. Cheesecake Factory is like a big box store. They all the look the same, sell the same, and act the same. Our server at this particular location was very nice, expeditious, and knew exactly when to check in on us.  The food is good, but not out of this world - well except for the 10,000 calorie miso salmon that I just never have the guts to order! I ordered my full meal from the skinnylicious menu (brilliant idea btw). I had a margarita and the turkey burger, hubs had the herb crusted salmon, and baby had the kids chicken quesadilla.  The turkey burger was great. It had melt in your mouth onion and mushrooms. The salad it came with was lightly dressed and very generous ($10.95). The margarita on the other hand was mostly ice and not much Rita! I literally drank the entire think in 3 sips ($10$)!   My hubby had the Huen crusted salmon. The word crusted makes it sound like the outer part of the fish will be crisp but it actually isn't. It's very soft and has potential to be very delicious. I feel like it was missing seasoning and a acid in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was good but needed that little push to make me crave it next time ($17.95).  My LO ordered the quesadilla. It was huge. She loved it! What's not to love? Flour tortilla, lotsa cheese, and wee bits of chicken ($6.95). The kids meal also comes with a free drink.  All in all we love Cheesecake Factory. Beyond the wait, it's usually pretty reliable, the service is generally consistent, and there is a wide variety to choose from."
Thomas R.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,12,5,2.0,3/30/2015,"""Is everything going alright?""  Do I look alright to you? I don't usually get this worked up over something so trivial but they had the guts to serve me the worst cappicino of my life and burnt nachos. All of the chips were a toasted brown color with fabulous black outlined edges. They left the chips melting in the oven for too long and they just decided to slap the toppings on. I did enjoy the guilty looks on the waiters faces as they watched me pick my way through my sad excuse for a meal. It's not about the food it's the fact that they burnt nachos and they knowingly served it."
Denise C.,"San Francisco, CA",987,1464,2619,4.0,6/8/2014,"Cheesecake Factory gets bad reviews on Yelp, but I like this restaurant. I haven't been to Cheesecake in recent history, but many years ago in Maryland. The menu has many options to choose from. I wanted salmon and shrimp scampi, chicken katsu, or a spicy chicken sandwich. I ended up getting skinnylicious chicken soft tacos. They were okay. I asked for a sauce for an extra kick. I had lemonade and those came with refills, but it was almost too sweet. I got the key lime cheesecake and it was good...again very sweet. There's plenty to choose from on the menu. I am sure you can find something that will make your dinner at Cheesecake worthwhile. The restaurant is packed for dinner by 5 PM. We had my sisters and their families and my parents and me. The service was good. Our waiter did a great job and was helpful and attentive."
Wade N.,"San Mateo, CA",0,45,,4.0,1/28/2017,"The service we received at the Cheesecake factory was great, and the desserts were great. We weren't totally blown away by the food, but that's kind of what you get from a chain. Overall it was a good experience and we'll be back for big group parties and outings."
Vanessa Y.,"San Francisco, CA",354,146,96,2.0,8/7/2015,"Came here for my brother's birthday. Our waitress was missing majority of the time and she looked like she did not like her job. She tried hard to cover it up, but we still got this vibe. The food was good but the wait was just sad..  When it was time for dessert, of course we asked for the free scoop of ice cream for the bday boy! She did a double take and gave this weird look and asked if we were gonna order. So we asked for time to think and she left. Came back and we ordered. The bday boy had 1/3 of the cup filled with ice cream and the rest was whipped cream.. Ordered the cookie dough cheesecake and it was tiny and too sweet.. Oh! Did I mention we didn't get any utensils. Were we supposed to use our hands? Sorry for being so harsh. Still gave her a 15% tip kus my mom felt bad her tables were so far away from the kitchen. Good ol' mom You let me down, Cheesecake Factory!"
Jade D.,"Daly City, CA",42,104,81,3.0,10/8/2014,"We came here at 11:20 in the morning and there was no line. Thankfully. We were seated right away. Our waiter Jared was professional and nice. He asked us what we wanted to start with and I said water with lemon and their bomb ass wheat brown bread. YES!!!! LOL...must try, it's soooo good!  My husband ordered a MAC-N-Cheese burger which is his usual, and I ordered a Pasta dish (already forgot the name.) I can honestly say it was alright. It's mediocre food here for me at Cheesecake Factory unfortunately. Ordered a Oreo cake for my daughter & it was way to sweet. Usually all of their cheesecakes are really deelish but if I had a choice, I would have chosen something else. Also ordered their salmon rolls from their skinnylicious appetizer menu and that was by far my fave!  Overall, our experience was okay. Nothing good or bad about dining in here."
Tamara S.,"Burlingame, CA",245,303,225,3.0,7/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory like Starbucks like other chains, it's always consistent. No surprises you always know what you're getting.  It can get very crowded here, specially on Friday and Saturday nights so you might have to wait up to 45min. You can always walk around the mall or do some shopping to kill the time though.  The wait staff is friendly and professional, the restaurant is neat and the restrooms are always clean. The food is like any other cheesecake factory. If you haven't tried it yet, it good food (not great just good enough) some plates better than others. Skip the burgers though they have better dishes."
J. B.,"San Leandro, CA",0,37,2,2.0,7/5/2016,Went there July 3 for lunch.  Good food - bad service.  Think server was new and didn't seem to have been trained very well.    She took forever to get our drinks.   Then two of the four of us received our food while she stood at the servers order station and counted her tips.  Finally had to get up from table and  go ask her for the rest of our food.   Other staff members then jumped in and made sure we had our food and were taken care of.   Ordered cheese cake and again it took almost 10 minutes.   Not sure what the system is for placing the order and picking it up .... but for the cheese cake orders to take that long....   Weird  Again - food was good.   Service was supposing bad
Beverly K.,"San Francisco, CA",45,2,2,2.0,4/20/2016,Poor customer service and communication. Sucks that an establishment with such yummy food has unprofessional and unfriendly management and service.
Ryan A.,"Hayward, CA",154,380,169,4.0,9/14/2015,"We came here on a Friday night for dinner a few weeks ago.  We had a very good meal here.  Crab/artichoke dip with bread to start, then salads, which were ok, then our meals which were very good.  We even grabbed Avocado rolls with our cheesecake togo.  Cheesecake here theres a million selections and they all taste great."
Matt G.,"San Francisco, CA",2161,1911,3823,3.0,6/20/2012,"Joe Cool and his daughter came here for an early Father's Day dinner after walking around the air-conditioned Hillsdale Shopping mall.  The one-year-old Cheesecake Factory is located on the street side of the Hillsdale Shopping Mall. Just like all the CF locations, I like the dark ambience with a lounge-like feel.  Since we were here on Father's Day, the wait for an actual table was a ridiculous 45 minutes. However, I did see the empty bar with the NBA Championship game being televised. So we ran over there quickly sat at the stools to watch and enjoy the game for our dinner...we, as in, my daughter and I...at the bar, folks! Most of the restaurants give huge portions. So my daughter split a dinner-portion Caesar salad for $9.00 and a big appetizer dish of Buffalo Chicken Tenders for $13.50. The Caesar salad wasn't bad, but very hearty. But the Chicken Tenders, with the dipping sauces of Honey Dijon and ranch sauce and Mexican-style corn, was decent and nothing too stunning.  Salad:    Chicken Tenders:  Since we took the train to San Mateo, I opted to try one of the restaurant's patented cocktails: the Blueberry Mojito. The $12.00 cocktail had mint leaves, lime wedges, fresh blueberries muddled up in a glass. Then fresh Blueberry puree, huge shots of Blueberry Stoli vodka and rum. All combine in one tall glass. This is a very refreshing drink and tasted good while watching the basketball game. Cocktail:  We did take home a slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake for $10.00. The sweet treat was good (sorry, no pictures).  Just like many of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants we have visited, some of the foods are good. And some are bad. The drinks, desserts and service are good and efficient."
Ken C.,"San Mateo, CA",26,71,2,1.0,10/21/2015,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and I have to say this is by far the worst.  The food isn't terrible, but it's not as good as the others.  For one, their Chicken Piccata is way too oily.  Their Steak Medallions are also over-seasoned.  Not to mention that each piece of steak is a different degree of doneness.  I ordered mine medium, but the pieces on the sides are well-done.  The ones closer in are medium-well, and only the center pieces are medium. But the food itself doesn't warrant a 1-star.  The service does though.  The waiters and waitresses are okay.  They do a fine job when the restaurant isn't busy.  What really ticks me off is their bakery counter, where people pick up their food to go.  Every time I order food, I always ask for wheat-bread only.  90% of the time, they either 1) give me both types or 2) don't give me any bread at all.  Also, 100% of the time, the bread will be smashed.  I don't know why they do this, but they always squeeze two pieces of bread together then wrap it in tin foil.  If I really wanted to eat panini bread, I would've asked for panini bread.  My latest trip there today was the same deal.  What's worse is that when I got there, the person at the counter said the wheat bread won't be ready for another 10 minutes.  I said I can wait, so I stood on the side.  15 minutes passed, no bread came out, and none of the people at the bakery section were doing anything.  They were just chatting and hanging out.  So I went up and asked them if my food is ready, and that's when they went to the kitchen and found out everything was already ready.  So basically if I didn't speak up, they wouldn't even check up on my food.  Yea, great service.  I wish I got her name so everyone can avoid her, but you know what. I think the whole bakery section is full of people like this, so it's best just to never buy take-out here. This Cheesecake Factory also seem a bit dirtier than the others, but it's nothing too deal breaking for me. Food: 3/5 Service: 1/5 Atmosphere: 3/5"
Jimi L.,"Belmont, CA",2,17,6,1.0,6/13/2016,"Tried to set up reservations for a large party, but they gave us so much attitude about it that we decided to go with another restaurant that can handle a large group and wants the business. They seem to be lacking customer service skills, not sure if it was a manager we spoke to or just some miserable hostess that can't stand her job. Oh well looks like we won't be bothering with this joint anymore."
Mike I.,"Santa Rosa, CA",15,311,,2.0,4/6/2016,"Large servings (even the Lunch serving) of many pastas. Nothing imaginative (as you would expect from a chain like this). They no longer have the Pasta Bolognese, which is why we came here (my wife's former favorite menu item)."
