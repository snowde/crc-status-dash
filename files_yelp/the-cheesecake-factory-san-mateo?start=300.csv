Rita K.,"Union City, CA",617,592,299,4.0,5/29/2012,"I'm giving it a high rating because there wasn't a wait when we went and the waiter was very friendly to my coworkers and I. However, why did they put 7 people in a booth? We were squished almost!  I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo and it was delicious. I asked for spicy, I should've asked for extra spicy for spicy was just mild! Huge portions, so I had some leftover for dinner. The service was super friendly, the waiter checked up on us frequently. No mistake on our orders, impressive! The time it took to get our foods was very short in comparison to other Cheesecake factories I've been to. The rye bread with butter was so. freaken. good."
Brittany C.,"San Mateo, CA",366,147,295,5.0,7/21/2014,Never have an issue here. Service is great!  I love being able to try new things as the bf sticks to his usual fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. We always are too stuffed for dessert sadly.
Woodstock B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,18,3,4.0,1/22/2017,"Love the chicken teriyaki dish, the turkey burgers and the shrimp platter.  Prices are high, servings are large and they are always busy with a wait.   The cheesecake is awesome of course!"
Danny N.,"San Francisco, CA",1,182,87,3.0,9/26/2015,Pretty good Cheesecake Factory. Food was great and service was good! Pretty busy location in the mall so try and beat the dinner rush. Kids portions are great too.
Crag C.,"Belmont, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/3/2016,"Let me start off with my salad was very good. Now unto why only 3 stars? Because of a bad customer service. I called them to place an order and I was put on hold, I was on hold all the way to the them. I came into the place and they still had me on hold. That was good 8 minutes, nobody even bother to pick the line and at least let me know they didn't forget about me. Why is it so hard to give a good customer service?!"
Julie N.,"San Francisco, CA",170,415,933,4.0,3/1/2013,My mom and i decided to come here for a late dinner after our shopping at hillsdale shopping center. We didn't have to move our car since we park close enough to this restaurant and its the same parking lot with the mall. thats a good thing that theres plenty of parking.  Got seated right away after putting my name on the waiting list when  indicator vibrate/turn off after couple minutes even though the restaurant was busy on a friday night. The waitress that we was friendly. Appetizer: buffalo blast: more like chicken inside a wrapper where the outside is fried and there's some celery sticks as well and couple sauce that came with this dish. Not bad.  Main course: my mom and i shared caujan chicken jambalaya pasta since we knew how big the portion is at cheesecake factory. They split into two smaller plates for us since we got a very small table. It was very good. Cost about 16.85. Dessert: white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake for about $6.75+. A bit pricy for a slice but it was still yummy and light. The cream cheese didn't over power the cheesecake which is why i thought it was light. Has whip cream on top of the cheesecake
Ken I.,"Castro Valley, CA",3,20,35,4.0,11/7/2015,"One of my favorite places to eat. Extensive menu with almost too many choices, it can be a difficult decision of what to eat. I had the grilled pork chops that ended up being an excellent choice over the pasta dishes I usually get. A nice chop with glazing with mashed potatoes and vegetables. This place is normally busy so arrive early or be prepared to wait. And with good sized portions, the cheesecake usually needs to be taken to go. And I always enjoy the upscale feeling and look of these restaurants."
Jennifer O.,"Pacifica, CA",15,5,2,1.0,12/19/2016,"We went to the Cheesecake factory in San Mateo for my birthday dinner. The wait, on a Sunday evening was a 45 minute wait. Ok, so we walked around the mall with my 4 year old neice. We finally got seated and sat for 20 minutes before we even got a drink. I had to ask the bus guy to bring us water. At this point I had asked the manager to please make sure we don't get crappy service because I didn't want to have a shitty birthday dinner, the manager basically told me its unfortunate we came in a busy night, THAT IS NO EXCUSE!!!Finally got bread at least so Skylar had SOMETHING to eat. 30 minutes later we got appetizers. But we ordered our meals while ordering appetizers because our waitress was scarce. After 45 minutes we got our food. My chicken was so burnt it was literally black. Mom's burger was cooked so dry she couldn't even take a bite, poor Skylar had burnt sliders as well and we didn't even get ketchup or mustard. The same manager came over and apologized with absolutely no compassion and made it seem it was our fault for even coming. The manager took our 3 meals off the check and said he would give me a piece of cheesecake for my birthday!!! We spent 3.5 hours and this seriously pathetic restaurant. Ruined my entire birthday evening. We didn't even get him until 11 pm. I have never experienced such a horrible experience at ANY restaurant as I did at the San Mateo Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one in SF and had such a great experience that it was my idea to go to the one in San Mateo......I am SO ABSOLUTELY UPSET THAT MY BIRTHDAY WAS TOTALLY RUINED!!! NEVER NEVER AGAIN!!! Please read all Yelp reviews before you go to a restaurant that charges a pretty penny!!!!"
Kristina S.,"San Mateo, CA",39,196,237,1.0,3/4/2015,"EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH MY VISIT. Today I came here for a late lunch. After we were seated it took 5-10mins for the wait staff to come to our table (it wasn't even that busy). Although she was pleasant she went straight to asking if we were ready to order. We weren't asked if we wanted drinks. We proceeded to place our order and asked for drinks. The food took awhile to be brought to us (10-15mins).  When our dishes were brought to us I was extremely disappointed in my dinner size Cobb Salad. However, with all we had been experiencing this visit, I didn't even want to bother sending it back. I received a pile of lettuce with probably less then 1/4 cup of different items mixed together (not the usually bed of lettuce with various sections of veggies laid on top) with scrabbled egg around the trim of the dish. In addition to a few ingredients that were not suppose to be in my salad. I was starving and just wanted to eat and get on with my day.  I regret not saying something to the waitress or manager but this is really disappointing to see the quality and lack of consistency your kitchen is serving. The quality I received today was of a Denny's or maybe a TGIF."
Amanda H.,"Millbrae, CA",119,134,176,2.0,4/19/2016,"This place has left me disappointed more then once. Last night we went for a birthday party and had 8 people in our group. The restaurant wasn't too busy and although our waiter was very nice the service was slow (could be due to bartender and cooks). They were out of 2 items we tried to order. The menu is very large..maybe having less things on the menu would result in them not running out of items? The salmon we ordered was very raw. The waiter was very kind to offer us a new one but by the time the new one came everyone else was done eating..  Lastly, we told the hostess about the cake we had brought and she said she would let our waiter know. When it came time to sing happy birthday they brought out a mini ice cream with a candle. We asked where the cake was and they didn't seem to have any knowledge about a cake. The waiter handled the situation great and sung happy birthday again with the cake..it was just a bit disappointing that all these mishaps kept happening."
Robert F.,"San Francisco, CA",89,658,4224,4.0,7/6/2015,Only 4 stars because there is not enough cheesecake. Love the service and the ambience here. Parking it's cool. Reservations are best if not be prepared to wait a long time. Had some jambalaya. It was downright wonderful. I should have ordered 2 plates. The cheesecake was ridiculously good. An Oreo cheesecake freakin made my day. I was tempted to get on to go as well. Love this place.
Sabrina C.,"Hayward, CA",94,2,,1.0,2/12/2016,dislike this cheesecake factory. . im a san francisco native.  so i been going to thee cheesecake factory out there for yearrrssssss!! but today i discovered the one in san mateo. . all i can say is (smh)  my complaints are. . 1. the wait on a friday night for a table was ridiculous  2. customer service was horrible/sucks 3. never recieved my appetizers nor an explaination on what happenes to our food. .  overall im never coming backk here again and i suggest everyone reading this. . if you want good service and your full plate of food. . go to the sf location (trust me the wait is worth it) or find a different restraunt p.s ive worked in thee food industries so i know the expectations
Steven M.,"San Mateo, CA",46,97,3,2.0,2/21/2015,"Not a very well run location.  Cheesecake factories tend to be predictably good, but this one seems to be an exception.  Been here a few times and they always manage to either take an unusually long time or mix up my order.   When I went yesterday, even after the manager apologized for my order getting mixed up and then delayed an extra half an hr (I got to-go because the lady and I were having a night in), they managed to lose my only side order.  I gave up. The quality is fine, but since they're so unpredictable, I probably won't be back."
Jack R.,"San Francisco, CA",1931,1174,1327,3.0,4/16/2014,"It kind of saddens me that Miss Bad Idea Bear is moving away...further away than I care to drive given the price of gas and the bridge toll. And this our hang out spot. Like the Mafia has a pizzeria or liquor store as a front, we have this place. To talk. To catch up. Mostly to laugh. She likes their fried chicken sliders. I like their cheesecake.  And man, do I know about their cheesecake. I think I've sampled 75% of their cheesecake menu. They should hand out cheesecake badges, just like the boy scouts. I would rolling in badges. The cheesecake here is spectacular! But the food here is just average. I just come here for the company...."
Casey T.,"San Leandro, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/27/2016,Came here and it took forever I order the Hibachi Steak it was greasy  I felt nauseous right after the dishes for some reason are always dirty and our waiter had a hickey gross
Mark H.,"San Bruno, CA",85,324,186,2.0,2/16/2012,"Cheesecake Factory... another chain restaurant. I went for happy hour at the bar. Jason was the bartender. He was great. He gets 5 stars. The calamari I ordered gets zero stars. It came out undercooked, soggy and very rubbery. It was disgusting how undercooked they were. The fire roasted artichokes were very good but not enough dipping sauce for the plate of artichokes. It was nice seeing a healthier option on the appetizer menu. Beers were $4, Appetizers were $5. Mixed cocktails were $5.  I won't be going back because their food is just, meh. They are always overly crowded and usually overpriced.  If you are into waiting 45 minutes for a seat in a restaurant, then this is your place!"
Cathy S.,"San Mateo, CA",8,2,,1.0,7/10/2016,"After a long day of shopping at the mall, my girlfriends and I decided to grab some lunch. We first step in and noticed that it isn't too crowded, which is great! Meaning we wouldn't have to wait long! WRONG. I asked the hostess how long the waiting period is and she tells me 30-45 minutes. Are you joking? Whatever, me and the gals decided to put our name down because we were really craving some cheesecake. About 25 minutes go by, and our buzzer FINALLY goes off, THANK GOD. I hand it over to the hostess and she begins to gather up our menus. Great! We're getting seated 10 minutes earlier than expected! WRONG. She decides to give up out table to one of her ""friends"" I'm assuming...You work at a restaurant and when you're friends come by you want to ""hook it up"", whatever do what you want, but at your own expense not at a PAYING customers. COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL. She doesn't even apologize! Thankfully another one of her coworkers comes up and seats us.  When we were finally brought to our table, our waiter kindly gave us our STICKY menus, which went well with their crumb infested floors! Their menus contained a large selection, to my thinking. WRONG. My girlfriends and I all ordered something different, I decided to order a turkey club sandwich. After eagerly waiting 15 minutes later our waiter comes by and tells me that they don't have any turkey. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. What kind of establishment doesn't have turkey?! Because of this I had to order something new--I decided to just get a cheeseburger. This whole situation elongated our wait for our food. Good thing we had empty cups of water to hold us up for our wait.  When we finally got our food"
Jeff M.,"San Jose, CA",8,11,8,1.0,1/18/2015,"December 26th visit @715PM. The bar thought me and my girlfriend's IDs were fake. It took 15+ minutes and a very unprofessional confrontation with the manager for me to finally just walk out. NEWS FLASH: We're both hitting 30. I guess male pattern baldness and a giant beard wasn't a good enough indication. Their excuse? The ID expiration date was on my birthday in 2018. No sh!t sherlock, it's supposed to expire on your bday. Wrote to corporate. Almost a month later, still no response. Never had an issue with this location before. Never again. Cheesecake Factory lost 2 customers."
Chris E.,"Belmont, CA",0,26,1,4.0,5/29/2016,Three years does make a difference. We had dinner at Cheesecake Factory this past week and I was pleasantly surprised with the service and the food. I am glad things have improved.
Min P.,"New York, NY",82,6,62,3.0,4/23/2016,"The bread that they serve first was the highlight of our lunch... We ordered two pasta, they were just ok. One is too dry, the other one is too sweet."
