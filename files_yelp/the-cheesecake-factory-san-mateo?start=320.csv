Tony T.,"San Mateo, CA",18,82,20,1.0,1/29/2015,I use to love this place but after the last visit I may not be going back. I guess our waiter Jose G. was not in to his job that day and it reflected on to his service quality. We never got our bread or was asked if we wanted any. Then he never asked to refill my ice tea glass that was empty during my whole meal and last he swooped over to take the credit card receipt as soon as I signed it which is rude and annoying.  For such a pricy place your service should be much better.  If you are unhappy with your job change it and don't take it out on the customers you serve.
Shereen M.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/12/2016,"This was the best Cheesecake Factory experience!!! The restaurant manager Chris went above and beyond to make our grandma's 94th birthday a very special one!! He and his staff were so kind and attentive. They checked up on Grandma several times to see if she needed anything during our visit. The food at CF was delicious as always, but it was the customer service at this location that truly made this a memorable experience. Thank you, Chris!!! We'll be back with Grandma for sure!!"
VB L.,"San Mateo, CA",971,720,826,4.0,11/22/2011,"Busy?  Heck yeah, but that's because they have good food, a great menu selection, happy atmosphere, pro service and...well...cheesecake that will make you cry tears of joy and pain - the joy of all that delicious cheesecake going straight to all those various body parts.  Sigh.  **Life is Good**   Hubby and I were thrilled to spend our first meal at this Cheesecake Factory on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  We sat at the bar and had plenty of room for drinks and food.  One of the bartenders was ""unique"" but the rest of them were fantastic.  The food, as always, was soooooo yummy.  I didn't want to stop eating! I'm really excited to have this Cheesecake Factory so close to home.  With so many fabulous restaurants opening in Hillsdale Mall, the toughest thing now will be deciding where to go for dinner. TIP:  Parking in the back of the mall is a bit easier than the front."
EJ N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,96,1,5.0,3/19/2015,Have to say I'm a long time Cheesecake Factory fan. We arrived after 9pm so there was no wait but choose to sit at the bar anyways.   The bartender was AWESOME on service. The burger and chicken plates were great as well.
Drew L.,"Arlington, VA",5,1,,1.0,12/30/2014,"This was literally the worst service I have ever experienced. The time between getting seated and ordering drinks and food: 15 minutes. The time between that and learning that the kitchen is out of pears for a friend's order: 10 minutes. The time between drinks arriving and food arriving: 40 minutes. The rice in my burrito was ice cold. Everything else in it was warm, but the rice was frigid. But hey, at least all the food came out, right? Sadly no, not all the food. My friend's eggs came out ten minutes after that, which is impressive because THEY'RE EGGS, how long does it take to make eggs? My friend immediately asks why her food took so long to come out and the server couldn't get the manager fast enough. The manager comes out and asks what's up. My friend explains the situation and asks for her food to be comped, because we're basically done eating at this point. I send my food back because it's basically inedible. The manager, for reasons passing understanding, offers to box up my questionably-cooked burrito for free. I sent it back anyway, because that's how bad it was.  The manager fires off a half dozen apologies in rapid succession and then nearly sprints away, never to be seen again. Fast forward twenty minutes. Our server hasn't returned or checked in or apologized or brought the check over despite walking past the table several times. We're all done eating and just want to get out of there. We had to flag down a busser, ask them to print out the check, and bring it over. To their credit, they did so immediately.  The server made their way over five minutes after that and cluelessly asked if we wanted any dessert. We assured them that we were all set, had the check, and wanted to get out of there. Rather than taking the check, they cleared two plates and dipped, also never to be seen or heard from again. Five minutes after that, we hailed a busser, had a second manager run our check, and got out of there. Somewhat regret not dine-and-dashing, although we wouldn't have needed to dash to leave there unnoticed."
Brenda A.,"Burlingame, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/8/2016,"This 1 star is for the poor service. This place needs new management or better staff training. Waitress was not attentive at all. We had been seated for 10 minutes before anyone even came over to ask what we wanted to drink...and the person who finally came over wasnt even our waiter; he said our waiter took a break. We also had to ask two different waiters, including the manager, for refills. Food was not only incomplete (mashed potatoes were not ready), but cold too. It had been sitting out for way too long. The staff apologized but did nothing else to remedy the problem. Paid $60 for a cold meal and terrible service."
Erica W.,"San Mateo, CA",25,20,,4.0,12/8/2014,Their happy hour is great but crowded. The appetizers are half  off during happy hour so def check it out if you can. The main downside is that there is almost always a wait even if the restaurant is half-empty. I think they like to make customers wait to create the illusion that this place is exclusive and hard to get into like a club. Overall the food is usually great with a lot of variety so everyone in a group can find something they like. I have been here  at least 8 times over the past few years and will continue to go back for happy hour or dinner. Great place for groups.
Karan S.,"Union City, CA",0,34,3,2.0,5/19/2016,"Over crowded and understaffed seems to be the norm at all cheesecake factories. Though we arrived on a generally uncrowded evening, the wait was still about 30 minutes and that was mostly due to the low staff on hand. This seems to be the issue with all cheesecake factories in the entire bay area. Then it took another 45 minutes just to get the dam water and another 30 after that to get our food. Uncrowded thursday evening and it took over 2 hours to just get our food. The food was decent, nothing special. The company clearly doesnt give a dam about there customes, partly the reason why we have reduced our visits to only once per year. But clearly we should stop coming at all because they dont seem to like customers at all. Its not the waiter or cooks fault. Its just management cutting cost. I feel bad for the employees."
Vance T.,"Baywood-Los Osos, CA",1,4,5,5.0,5/1/2016,"Place was absolutely packed on a Saturday me and my gf got in very quick cuz we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender/waiter was amazing he was very quick and knowledgeable. We had great drink, great pasta, and awesome drinks! Will definitely be back!"
Priyanka C.,"Millbrae, CA",9,2,1,1.0,6/5/2016,"When we made our reservation they didn't even put our name and we waited in line for so long. People who came after us got their seats and we were still not getting any one to get us seated. So unprofessional for such a ""high class"" restaurant. The hostess was extremely rude and pathetic."
Christine V.,"Redwood City, CA",339,424,1439,4.0,12/18/2013,No problems here. Came for lunch with my co workers on a Tuesday. We're seated in 5 minutes and our server was pretty attentive. Food came out relatively quick and was good. The peppermint bark cheesecake was to die.
Christina C.,"San Mateo, CA",129,666,7,1.0,12/20/2014,"I have a difficult time getting into the swing of the holidays.  Sometimes, I wonder if my human programing could use an upgrade.  Sometimes, I wonder if I should have picked a different career if I didn't want to end up hating everything and everyone all the time and being constantly exhausted.  Hey, hindsight is everything, and if I could have predicted the future, I would exploit all the sporting event scores that I never memorized because I didn't realize it could be important/useful/valuable.  Again.  Could have, would have, should have. We come here occasionally.  Okay, we've been here 4 times.  Once, when I snuck out of work early and made it in time for happy hour, it was pretty decent.  It would have been a 2 or 3 star experience.  The service is always great and attentive.   The most recent time, this past Friday, the last Friday before Christmas, it was a disaster.  We missed happy hour.  The food we ordered was terrible.  The greek salad was terrible.  The spinach and artichoke dip was COLD.  The fried cheeses looked like lumpy kibble that had been battered and fried by armless kangaroos.  This was one experience where I can confidently say that I should have gone to TGIFridays instead because at least they have decent fried cheese. Seriously, when a girl's been beaten down all week by a bunch of spitting koala bears and all she wants is a platter of freshly fried mozzarella cheese with some marinara dipping sauce, don't give her sloppy kibble.  On Friday past, I should have gone to TGIFridays because then I could have the exact type of breaded heart attack that I needed to feel human again.  I hate the holidays."
Priscilla T.,"San Mateo, CA",108,36,12,2.0,10/26/2013,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to!! Since this location is fairly new I gave it a few tries but it certainly disappoints in at least one way EVERY SINGLE TIME... Now let's get started... First of all because Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, there are certain expectations and standards they need to live up to.. The first time I came was about a month after opening and I ordered my regular dishes of crab poppers, crispy fried artichoke hearts, salmon firecracker rolls and miso salmon. ALL THE DISHES WERE 2/3 THE SIZE OF THE OTHER RESTAURANTS. and it took a REALLLY long time for our food to come out. Disappointing. So I didn't go back for a while.  Another time I ordered the crispy crab poppers,which usually comes out in six pieces, it came out looking horrible. It was like one popper had broken and they tried to camouflage it as two so in reality we were missing one.. Minus points on being cheap and crappy presentation. We returned it and they made a new one, but this whole situation could have been avoided if they put some thought into it. The worst part was that when we complained, the waitress said she saw that it already didn't look right when she brought it out....Uh so you were just trying to get by with serving a SUBPAR dish!? Not cool  FFWD to my last time going (as in this will be the last time I ever go to this location, I'd rather make the trek to Palo Alto). More incompetent wait staff..our waitress never refilled our water.. When our salad came out wrong and missing the grapes she didn't even say sorry, she just took it back and threw some grapes on top..it's supposed to be tossed.. One of my number one pet peeves is when they do not take responsibility andDONT SAY SORRY. instead she tries to argue w the customer. Do they teach u nothing here?! Also the bus boy cleared the dish from the table as I still had my spoon in the plate scooping something.. I hate to use the word incompetent so much...but they really are..a lot of them need to go back to training. And every time I come here I just end up leaving annoyed."
Melissa C.,"Redwood City, CA",371,68,279,5.0,2/24/2014,"I've been to the Cheesecake factory a few times but today was wonderful! I went with my parents for lunch and we ordered the new potato skin tater tots? (not sure on the real name of the dish). They were fried tater tots filled with bacon and cheese and sour cream on the side. They were delicious! For lunch my parents each ordered Renee's special (Half sandwich, side salad, AND cup of soup). The soup of the day was a bean and bacon soup. It was similar to a minestrone, very good! I ordered the lunch Cobb salad with dressing on the side. The portion was HUGE! If mine was the lunch size, I can't imagine how large the normal size is! The salad has plenty of grilled chicken breast and bacon, all topped with egg.  Our server was Jan, I think. He was wonderful! Very attentive and knew the menu really well! When we asked for bread, there was only white bread at the time, but he made sure to bring us the brown honeywheat bread as soon as it came out of the oven (still hot!) When I asked for a box to take the rest of my enormous salad home, he offered to pack it up for me. He even packed up dressing on the side for me and put a few extra loaves of bread for us to take home.  Jan is awesome! I give the food 4 stars and Jan helped earn the 5th"
Vincent T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,23,,1.0,12/1/2014,I've never hated the cheesecake factory until i visited this location. My experience was just horrible. I came to eat with a complimentary cheesecake slice card and I had them scan it. The computer stated that it was expired. I told them that the card was still valid if they looked at the DATE. So they called their manager to come by because the card was still valid because of the DATE. The manager told me that he could do nothing because the computer said it was expired even though it was obviously still valid. LIKE REALLY!?   I came all the way down here to eat WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN CHEESECAKE!?! What kind of customer service is this? Does the computer make all the decisions here? Might as well have a robot run this place if you're gonna have someone make a decision off a computer. You can obviously see that the card is still NOT EXPIRED Make customers happy.... It's not that hard...
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,9/19/2011,"I have a friend that is contemplating opening a restaurant. We bounced ideas of business operations/logistics, staffing, concepts and what not. The most important thing to him I stressed is the business concept. A restaurant is more than just cooking, it is a business first and foremost. The food is what brings you in. Now some people may say that Cheesecake Factory is an altar to American excess and it's a chain, but if you look at it closely it's kind of a brilliantly run business. In the early days it took $250K to open one. Now it's north of $2 million however that number is consistent with each and every one they open. Also when they open anywhere, it's crowded, and their operations for the most part are super smooth because they 1. Know their core customer 2. Have the staff and cooks trained in a precise way 3. their food always tastes consistent. Whether you're in Chicago or LA or anywhere in between.  It's almost an exact science. The staff, the decor, the items on the menu (though there are some regional differences), how the expeditors process orders and maintain flow (they are absolute beasts that monitor the line), and everything else is calculated. For a restaurant to have 200+ seats and do 3-4 turns during a service is just amazing.   Now you can choose to like the food or not, but you have to say that they're a pretty well run business. So my friend and I came here on opening day to see how it would go. Somehow he scored a great patio table and we started chatting.  We split the samosas which are done with a phyllo pastry and ground chicken with much lighter spices. A way to ease middle America into Indian flavors. We then went for old fashioned American excess, meatloaf with huge mashed potatoes, and a fried macaroni and cheese burger. Yes you heard that right. Don't forget to add bacon. Surprisingly it was tasty and I could feel my health go downhill with each bite. Mac and Ceese and a burger plus bacon all in one? Why didn'y I think of that? When then split a cherry cheesecake to finish.  Our server was awesome with her great support staff and for a first day, full covers packed to the gills, it felt no different than any other CF I've been to. That's their brilliance. Offer something familiar in a universal way, with tons of choices and things that normally maybe adventurous formulate it in a friendly way.  I have no problem with excess. I just take it in moderation! Half my food came home with me as a second meal. Unsurprisingly a non chalant, predictable opening."
Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, WA",105,499,248,3.0,4/19/2014,"Good: - opens late  - huge menu - huge portion  - cheesecake galore!!! Bad: - huge menu - wait - too much frosting on (some) cheesecakes I recently had the raspberry lemon, mango, and Oreo cheesecake. The raspberry lemon was my favorite. It was justifiable to have some frosting on it since the bottom layer is actual cake. I still have to scrape half of it off. The mango was the most dense. I like that it didn't have any frosting. Mango'ness was a bit faint and sweetness was overwhelming. The Oreo was very rich but almost half if it was frosting -- a thick thick layer of chocolate frosting then a second later of ""cookie and cream."" Too much frosting. I feel cheated. Humph. We also dine here once but likely won't go back again. It's not their fault. My kids just love their shiny floor too much and they don't like their kid's menu enough to eat here. I had their veggie burger and it was delicious and fell apart like a disaster upon first bite."
Brennan C.,"Pacifica, CA",0,33,6,4.0,3/7/2015,"Foods here are of larger portion and tasteful. My favorites are jambalaya pasta, Kobe burger, blackout cake, Thai wrap. Order sweet potato fries when you get a burger there. Kids meals are good too.  The wait can be very long (over 30 minutes). But I don't understand why people complain about it. It's a popular restaurant in a popular mall. Just plan ahead.  No I didn't see Leonard, Raj, Shelton, or Howard hanging out there. Haven't met a waitress named Penny yet."
Kelly R.,"Belmont, CA",95,48,101,2.0,2/17/2014,"Waited 1.5 hr to be seated, then waited forever to get our own check! Food is terrific, overall service was good, but it started bad and ended bad! They need to take reservations and they don't! Irritating"
K T.,"San Francisco, CA",4,62,27,4.0,5/27/2015,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory location multiple times. I usually order pasta and am never impressed.  This time I chose to order steak ($20). (I forget the name of it but it is listed before the other steak option). My plate came with chopped chunks of steak as well as mashed potatoes and mushrooms. I have to say this meal was delicious. Would recommend the steak, not the pasta."
