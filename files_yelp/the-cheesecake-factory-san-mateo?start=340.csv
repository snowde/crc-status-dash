Kimberly H.,"San Francisco, CA",127,666,7895,4.0,4/10/2014,Usual cheesecake factory fair but ample parking in the mall and really great service. Stayed until closing and no one rushed us out. No reservations available for visits after 5:30pm.
Valerie R.,"San Mateo, CA",9,61,66,2.0,10/5/2013,"I think you should consider cafeteria style---your food is amazing but from my hostess experience to our server Kevin S---OUCH!  I know we were not dining at prime hours (3:30pm) but if the restaurant is going to be open then as a diner I would expect your staff to be ready to serve instead of ready to be on break.  I stood at the hostess counter for longer than I should have while two ladies were busy looking busy.  I even cleared my throat hoping one of the hostesses standing behind the podium would turn around--and yet I waited!   We were seated in what I can only call the ""forget about the customers b/c they can't see us"" area of the restaurant adjacent to the mall.  I had actually got up from my seat to find some help when Kevin appeared.  ""Sorry for the wait....what can I do for you""  fine fine.....ordered our drinks and food b/c we actually had that much time!  We asked for the salads to come first....not only did Kevin not serve us our food but the salads showed up after our appetizer orders---what was the point of even asking?  Kevin nor any other server for that matter could be found to refill our drinks....he asked if we wanted ketchup and we said no just a refill and guess what.....YUP! Ketchup to the table right away and refills....later, as in LATER! I honestly can say he took our order, delivered unwanted ketchup, p/u our food and brought our leftovers and the check.  That's all we saw of him....YIKES!   If your food wasn't so good--which to the chef's credit totally rocked!  I would walk pass your establishment just like your hostesses and servers walked pass me and the other diner! Even after I really crave those amazing chicken country sliders and the Faro Salad--I'll stop short at the memory of the horrible service!"
Robie B.,"South San Francisco, CA",68,39,305,2.0,12/6/2014,"Me: I'd like to make a reservation please. Girl: I'm sorry, we don't take reservations. Me: Was this a recent change? Your site states you take reservations, so you're stating you don't anymore. Correct? Girl: Please hold..(returns on the line) How many people in your party? Me: 5 Girl: We only take reservations for parties larger than 8. Me: So now you're saying you only take reservations unless it's for 8 or more, when earlier you said you don't take reservations at all. Correct? Girl: Ummm..yeah, sorry FAIL (2 stars because I've had their cheesecake before & it was good but the wait was ridiculous)"
Hector G.,"Belmont, CA",630,652,106,3.0,10/21/2013,"3.5 stars We've been to this location four times in the last year or so and overall I know what to expect. A really long wait during peak hours. A REALLY large menu that makes it nearly impossible for a group of people to agree upon anything. Decent but not great food. And of course, some serious cheesecake.  We were here on Friday night and sat through the long wait for an unknown reason. Seriously, I am not exactly sure why we chose this of all places. Anyway, we did and we waited a really long time for our entrees to arrive. An apologetic waitress came to our table with the entrees and a guy with a shirt and tie. One of the managers was holding my entree and he said ""Folks, I want to offer my sincere apology. Your entrees took 28 minutes and that's unacceptable. I'd like to buy  your dessert tonight."" First of all, I am a sucker for apologies. I was raised a certain way and I guess fewer and fewer folks were raised the same. An apology from a manager, on a Friday night at a place like this was a very nice surprise and I do appreciate it."
M C.,"Olivehurst, CA",294,2010,7472,4.0,3/11/2014,Really long lines on weekends and holidays. At least one can entertain oneself by going shopping.  The food is a bit better than Sizzlers or Olive Garden. This is a chain..
Elizabeth B.,"Las Vegas, NV",112,588,3010,3.0,9/5/2013,"Went here on my sister in laws request...and we really did not want to. I have an issue with menus that are 50 pages long and simply the fact that it is a chain restaurant. They had new menu items in an extra pamphlet called Skinny items. I really do hate CF and their concept of 50 pounds of low quality food on a plate. But I had no choice :( Hubby got a veggie pasta dish with no oil or butter. Just veggies and wheat pasta noodles. It had zucchini, squash, tomatoes etc. it was nothing special.  I got a veggie salad that had 50 pounds of edamame on it. The freshness of the salad was ok it had cucumbers, carrots, etc etc, no cheese, no croutons. I chose to have plain balsamic vinegar on side to occasionally dip or drizzle.  I try to avoid GMO and non-organic but I ate some of the salad and left the other 30 pounds of it :) I survived my visit to CF :) they should really shorten the menu and 1/3 the portions...wow."
Debbie H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,6,6,2.0,4/7/2016,"I come to this cheesecake quite often as it is open late and convenient. However, the service here could use some significant improvement. I chose to write this review after having many terrible experiencing dining here. Last night I was dining in the bar and was greeted by a very unfriendly, unprofessional server. After having to ask for bread after sitting there for about 15 minutes she walked to the table next to us and chose to hangout with her friends along with the manager who was sitting down with them, completely ignoring our request. Finally, our food was brought out by a different food runner-clearly having sat in the window for a while. Our sever finally came over and again we had to ask for bread (since she never brought it), drink refills, and the check- twice. The only thing that keeps me coming back is that the food here is pretty good."
Andrea B.,"San Mateo, CA",953,830,1271,2.0,10/1/2011,"Not impressed. The host staff told me 30 minutes, but to come back in 20 minutes to check-in.  Came back in 20 minutes, they told me 10 minutes and we were 4th on the list.  They told me not to go far because they would be calling us shortly.  We waited for 40 minutes outside the restaurant.  So frustrating, waited a total of 1 hour.  (Wouldn't have been so bad, if they would have just told us to come back in an hour.) After we were finally seated they told us that the wait staff would be with us soon.  Then they sat another table and the other table placed their order and received their food before we did; to add to my frustration. Ordered the Chicken lettuce wrap tacos - chicken was bland and Stuffed mushrooms - which were actually decent.  Ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and requested NO whipped cream, and of course what do they put all over it!!!!! Portions are always pretty large.  Prices are reasonable.  Customer service is horrible!!!"
Brittany T.,"Daly City, CA",3,7,9,4.0,4/11/2016,"I've been here a good number of times and to be honest the dishes start tasting the same (or maybe it's because I'm always ordering pasta). It's fairly emptier understandably earlier in the day so the wait to be seated is nonexistent.  Do expect to wait though if you come later in the day.  The ambience is always nice (especially at night, so cozy) and the place is fairly clean.  The service is good and I've only ever had one bad experience with the waiters.  Today's waitress was exceptionally polite and was the reason why I added another star.  One extra star for you glen coco.  The bread appetizer as per usual was delicious especially since it's warm and freshly made.  The wait for our pasta was reasonable and the waitress was always ready with a drink refill. The shrimp angel hair pasta was alright, just lacked a bit of something.  The avocado egg roll appetizer was also good but even with the pasta and appetizer split between my mom and I, we could barely finish everything. So beware of the portions (not necessarily bad to have so much though, just be aware). We finished off with a slice of cookie dough cheesecake and of course this was the cherry on top of our visit because who comes here and doesn't try cheesecake?! I have yet to try all the flavors but I vow to do so one day.  After we laid down the surrender flag, we ordered some more pasta, cheesecake, and bread to go which was a very convenient process altogether. Overall, you can't go wrong with a visit to the Cheesecake Factory."
Christopher X.,"Millbrae, CA",62,92,86,4.0,3/15/2015,"Not bad. I docked a star because of my last visit, but this time was a better experience. Our server AJ was attentive and friendly, and the service was excellent. All the food was great. There is a large selection of appetizers, and I recommend their pastas. Li had the BBQ smokehouse burger, and it was delicious. Cheesecake, of course, well done."
Derek W.,"San Mateo, CA",101,91,60,3.0,4/12/2015,"3 1/2 stars. The Cheesecake Factory is very famous and popular as a nice restaurant for a while now. But it's precisely what the name describes it as. A place built for cheesecake. The cheesecake here is awesome and can probably take up all of your cheat meals for the next year. But as a restaurant as a whole it isn't all that hot. I have been there now multiple times. Every time I go I try to order a different pasta, hoping that it will turn out better than the first couple of times. Every time I go I am let down again. For the attire, it looks like a fancy restaurant, no doubt. But it doesn't match the quality of the food. Most of the food here also can have you put on a couple of pounds and has you feeling full for the next week.  Bottom line: Come here for cheesecake and nothing else. You could probably come for some food but overall it isn't worth it. You're better off just going somewhere else for dinner then coming here for dessert."
Jit S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,17,14,1.0,7/5/2015,"One of the worst restaurant. Bad server, bad service. Completely unprofessional!  Served the breads without any plates.  Took 30 to 35 minutes to serve the simple straight forward lunch menu order!!"
Larry B.,"South San Francisco, CA",27,170,113,4.0,3/9/2014,"We ordered a tomato basil flatbread as an appetizer, it came out after about 15 minutes, and it looked like it was thrown together. The basil was a teeny bit of shredded pieces slopped together in the middle of the bread. We also ordered the chicken Madeira and ir came out shortly after the  flat bread. There was only problem with the chicken madeira, the fact that there was very little sauce compared to the usual amount on a regular order. In summary the food is tasty, the service is okay, but the wait can be pretty bad sometimes."
Wilson L.,"San Francisco, CA",168,2,,1.0,3/20/2016,"I came here last night wait about an hour with the 45 minute mark we asked how much longer lady said 15 so 30 minutes we asked lady said 15,we get seated our servers name was Lawerance there was 3 adults and he only got two and totally didn't put one of our orders in a d never came out to check on us on anything the boss comes out and try's to bring the food he forgot but everyone was finished with their food worst service ever!!! If I can go below 1 star I would"
Alberto D.,"San Bruno, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/16/2016,"We just stormed out of Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale disgusted with the treatment we were given. We just wanted a slice of chocolate cake. The guy at the cake counter did not know the difference between the Linda fudge cake and the black out cake except that one had 9 layers and then discovered that the other one too had 9 layers. He didn't even know what nuts were on that one cake. The other lady who was with him behind the counter rudely switched the names of the cakes and did not help the guy when he asked her what's the difference between the two. When I ordered a slice, he said there is only one cashier and she is busy there in the kitchen (pointed to the kitchen).  When another customer came up, that was the only time he called the cashier. A woman customer that was walking around came up, apparently she had asked the guy about something earlier. The cashier got her order which took time because the woman had not made up her mind yet. Meanwhile me my wife and I waited for her to finish, thinking we would me next to be accommodated. After the woman finished her order, the stupid cashier asked the third customer (the one who came after us) what his order was, completely ignoring us even when the guy we talked to told her that we were next! She even had the gall to say ""well stand in front here!"" How very rude!!!!! I hate her and I despise the treatment we got from Cheesecake Factory hillsdale!!! So rude!!!!  You just lost a customer big time!"
Elizabeth G.,"El Cerrito, CA",95,163,490,5.0,1/17/2015,So this is my fiancé first time  here and he enjoy the food and the service he order a bbq burger with fries I order fettuccine Alfredo with chicken  and shrimp and it was good like always .

Maria T.,"San Mateo, CA",24,19,6,4.0,2/16/2016,"I like the food and desserts here. But it's always packed. I like the ambiance and decor, but it's kind of loud (too many voices) not sure why, maybe too many people or bad acoustics. Some of their dishes are hit or miss, but they got such an extensive menu. Sure to please even the pickiest either. Portion sizes huge, so ok to split. Prices a bit on the moderate side, I mean, akin to other similar chains like PJ Changs. Still, all their cheesecakes are evil. So perfect, but caloric! Their low carb verson of their cheesecake is superb!"
Sam K.,"San Jose, CA",423,508,218,2.0,9/11/2013,"This is probably one of the worse Cheesecake Factory I have been with very slow service. The wait is SUPER long; we waited for over 1.5 hours with a 45 minute promise. Additionally, they seriously lack staff. Our waiters could barely cover our needs, let alone his entire row of customers.  Everyone's food was decent except for the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which came out sour and too tomato-y. The only salvage here is that at least the manager took it off of our bill. I would not recommend this place unless you enjoy the long wait."
Tim L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/30/2016,"First gave us a table without settings. Then resceptionist gave us dirty forks. Ask our waitress Daniella to replace the forks, she did but showing rudeness. She did not even give us a refill of bread that we ask. You have to ask her to refill the cola , even if she already saw that the glass is empty. The shrimp scampi was burned.  I don't know what's  there problem, DANIELLA IF YOU HAVE PROBLEM YOU SHOULD NOT WORK HERE !!! Manager was kind and  responsible."
Zakia R.,"Burlingame, CA",41,81,17,4.0,3/16/2014,"This is your average Cheesecake Factory. I have to admit that all the employees I encountered that night was very friendly. I sat outside on the patio. One thing I wish they had out there: heaters. Most CF I've been to has heaters on the patio, just not this one.  I ordered fish and chips and my husband had tomato basil pasta. My husbands dish was delicious but my fish and chips lacked a little flavor. The batter was a bit soggy and drenched in oil. *I am cringing at the thought of it.* I expect the fish to have oil on it *duh* but it was literally soaking in it on top of my fries making my fries get soggy. Ya doesn't sound too appetizing now does it? Although the coleslaw was delicious AND oil free :)  Oh and we can't leave without cheesecake! I had the pineapple upside down cheesecake that is cheesecake between two layers of cake. Yummy!!! My husband got the banana cheesecake. Tasted like banana cream pie! Overall a decent experience.  Well, that's all folks!"
