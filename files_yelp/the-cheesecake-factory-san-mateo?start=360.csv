Fatima A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/17/2016,We go there almost every Saturday for lunch and last Saturday there was no soup in the bathroom. I went there while we were waiting for a table. I complained to the hostess and she gave me an idiotic reaction like I'm an insane person. I said I don't know who to complain to but this is a serious issue. She said she'll figure it out. I wasn't able to wash my hands. 45 minutes later after we finish eating I go to the bathroom again and there was no soup still. This is so gross. I'm sure the hostess didn't do a single thing.
ASIANDIVAH A.,"San Francisco, CA",25,93,225,1.0,2/11/2016,"DIRTIEST, SLOWEST, SHITTIEST SERVICE!!! This branch should close, STAT!!!! Fucking wasted my 2 hours waiting for crappy service!!! The managers should be fired!!!"
Raymond Y.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/26/2016,This location is famous for long wait. They have couple tables each for 4 but not seating anyone for 30 min. so far...they just want you to wait....there are about 30 peopke waiting in the front....I do not understand the logic.  I will never come here except thus time a friend asking us to meet her.
Jen Z.,"Fremont, CA",20,131,67,2.0,2/7/2015,"2 stars solely for their cheesecake. Have tried both the banana & Kahlua cheesecakes and they were both a delicious treat--but expensive ~$8 per slice. Skip the meals. Not at all impressed with my fish taco lunch plate. I couldn't order a combination of fried and grilled fish (all tacos must be the same), and there was no hot sauce. Everything just tasted very bland. I was lucky to have been treated to both meals here, but definitely not a choice I would go to. They do have a large variety on their menu, but they should just stick to a few things and do it well. So just not worth it IMHO, just meh."
Kevin W.,"Mountain View, CA",171,373,615,4.0,4/9/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is one of my go-to's for Happy Hour when I'm too old to find a new hip spot or too lazy to trek into the scary big city.  The San Mateo location is one of the few with a bar area and Happy Hour specials - $5 cocktails and $5 for select appetizers.  Great service and plentiful seating. - Mojito & Cosmo - The bartenders are troublemakers.  Sweet but strong. - Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - A boatload of corn - literally, see the pic.  It's not really a tamale per se, but it's more a corn cake presented on corn leaves.  A little bit too saucy for me, but I like the corn - Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke - One and a half artichoke hearts.  Grilled but not burned and lightly salted. - Buffalo Blasts - BIG chicken strips with the buffalo flavor in the breading (e.g., the dry strips are not tossed in wet buffalo sauce).  Good spicy and sour flavor and very filling. Yes, I know I'm old.  I didn't get any cheesecake because I was full, and I had to rush to senior center for jello.  Stay tuned for my next exciting Yelp review of early bird specials!"
Sonia N.,"San Diego, CA",3,21,5,2.0,10/20/2014,"I've never been a huge fan of dining at Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is too big and I think most of their food is overpriced. However, they do make delicious cheesecakes and we always order a whole cheesecake for special occasions. They get one star for that. I've never dined in this particular cheesecake so this review is for their takeout. I was craving a healthy-ish salad last week and wanted something I could pick up on my way home. I decided on their ahi tuna dinner salad and my husband ordered the tamale cakes. The tamale cakes were good, so they get a second star for that. The ahi tuna dinner salad was a box filled with mixed greens, 2 thick slices of tomatoes, some slices of avocado, and 4 small pieces of seared ahi tuna. For an $18 dinner salad, I expected more than 4 pieces of tuna and at least some tomatoes that were properly sliced. I literally could have gone to Safeway and bought a bag of premixed greens, a tomato, and an avocado for a quarter of the price. I felt jipped. From now on, I'm only going there to satisfy my cheesecake craving."
Tiffany K.,"San Mateo, CA",1,12,1,1.0,3/4/2016,"This was prob the worst visit I've had here and I've had some crappy visits. Sat down at the bar with my husband and placed an order with the unfriendly bartender, Justin D, that looked absolutely annoyed with me for god knows why. Poured our Racer 5 with literally about 1 inch+ of foam. WTF?!?  We asked the other bartender politely if he'd top it off and the did but then scolded us that ""beer is supposed to have a head"". Ok bro...I can respect that BUT an inch+ of foam?!? You're tripping... A table opened up so we moved there and Justin D gave me an annoyed look and made me pay our drink bill first before moving. Sat down and after about 10mins had to ask for the table to be cleaned and then had to ask for a sever so we could place our food order. One finally came after I asked again...  This guy was ok, attentive but brought out bread that was room temperature which just added to our annoyance. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and chicken lettuce wrapped tacos and it took almost 40mins to come...  The mushrooms were room temperature and the sauce even developed a film...it was disgusting.  Literally the only person that showed good customer service was the busser. He was the only one that actually got us things when we asked. We've been coming here since they've opened but after these many many many crappy experiences, we're done."
Katrina C.,"San Mateo, CA",2,22,1,2.0,10/30/2015,"This used to be my favorite place to eat.. Love love love the avacado rolls and the cheesecake is to die for!!! However the last few times I have gone always a disappointmentI dont usually like to do bad reviews everyone can have a bad day... However The Chessecake Factory has definitely been a let down once again! $60 for brunch...young unprofessional staff with foul language, careless kitchen staff, cold food and make sure u ask for shreeded cheese on your omelette instead of sandwhich sliced cheese that is NOT melted. Uggghhh!  My boyfriend said it in simple terms... They Suck! Which is sad because they have a lot of potential but im getting tired of always giving them yet another chance and waisting my money!"
Kawhom L.,"San Mateo, CA",10,64,97,1.0,3/15/2015,"After we ordered we had to wait for the bread about 10-15 mins. When we asked for brown bread, they said we had to wait 15 mins more.Now the food came but we didn't get the bread. We understand if the food came out slowly when you were busy but not like this. So disappointed"
Rene V.,"San Mateo, CA",4,139,120,2.0,9/2/2014,OK first time here in December.. Cobb salad was terrible! Read my tip. Here now out of convenience. Springs rolls were edible..considering where I am at and I was starving with no time for a real meal. They make them once a day so the rice noodles are stuck together. Spinach dip took a while then came out dry and flavorless. I will never eat here again. Sent that back as I should have the Cobb salad. This is a place for people that don't know what food is suppose to taste or look like.
Jennifer T.,"London, United Kingdom",115,303,73,4.0,12/26/2013,"To be honest, I was never really a Cheesecake Factory fan. It was a fun place to dine in high school, but that was about it. However, they recently opened a Cheesecake by my house - at Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo. Since then, I've dropped by Cheesecake a few times and have come to fall in love with their chicken-seafood jambalaya pasta! Yum!! It's not super spicy, even though it says spicy on the menu, which is perfect for me (but maybe not for those who are more adventurous...I'm a mild-medium type of gal). The portion is also HUGE - so be prepared to take home half for lunch or dinner the next day. They also offer lots of bread and what I like is that it's always toasty. I hate when cold bread comes to the table. I also like the setup of this Cheesecake. There's inside seating, inside seating...inside the mall, and then outside seating as well. And what's cool about the outside seating is that during the summer, the glass goes up so you can enjoy the weather, and during the winter, it comes down to be completely enclosed. How cool is that?    PS - I just found out that they have their jambalaya pasta recipe on their website. Whatttt!!"
Amanda R.,"San Mateo, CA",102,83,1,2.0,9/18/2014,"The cheesecake is always good here!! We seldom do dine here, but when we do, the food is always only OK. They have a variety of items on the menu. We ordered the flatbread pizza starter on the skinnylicious menu and the serving was tiny, very thin, and cold. We also ordered the pear and endive salad - great portion here, but old, wilted salad and the ingredients just did not taste fresh. The salad was of course sent back - and the manager came over to apologize, but in the end there was nothing to compensate for the inconvenience.  The waiter was nice and professional, but the wait time took too long and we never even got a refill on our water. I think he was too busy entertaining the larger group next to us hoping for that good tip... too bad because I usually do tip 20%, but in this case, i left less than 15%. This location needs improvement, but if they can't even get salad right.... hmm.... many other posters had complaints about salad too. Perhaps we will stick to just picking up cheesecake from here. For a nicer, fresher dining experience in the same mall, try Paul Martin's."
Sharon C.,"San Ramon, CA",20,4,,2.0,11/11/2015,"Waited close to an hour on Saturday 11:30 am when the counter lady told me 20 min wait. We had a big group of 8 and didn't make reservation so we are anticipating wait time. But when we walked in at 11:30 am the restaurant were not busy yet. The lady quoted us 20 min prep time for the table and gave us one of these beeper thing . So we walked around in the mall and return around 11:50 am thinking the table should be ready soon. Apparently that is not the case. When we go to the same lady, she told us the table is ready, she will ask the waitress to prep it. Time goes by, 10 minutes later, we asked again, same answer, but this time she did check on the waitress. Another 10-15 minutes went by, I am ready to leave. Just when I made a reservation with another restaurant close, finally the table is ready and they let us in. Had to cancel the reservation with the restaurant. Feel so sorry for them. Food is just like other chessecake factory. Waitress was busy. Didn't check on us and missed the items we requested. The cheesecake in the end taste good though. I would only come here if I am bored and have extra time to kill. Definitely not worth the wait."
Brandy B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,94,202,1.0,1/9/2016,"Wow this place sucks, has gradually gone downhill and has finally hit bottom. They have such a wait they just really don't care about the quality of the food anymore. Everything we had today was horrible and we've been dozens of times, but the last few haven't been very good but we kept that ""it must be a one-off"" mentality, until today. No more cheesecake, your prices are a rip-off for terrible food."
Susie Q.,"San Mateo, CA",12,12,1,1.0,4/29/2016,"I gave this location three chances and three strikes and I'm out!!  We arrived at 5pm, the not-at-charming hostess didn't even look up to say hello.  When she finally did, she was chewing gum.  The ""manager""looked up and I told him we need a table for three. No one took our name, so we waited.  They started to seat us and then turned us around because it wasn't our table. The manager couldn't remember talking to me, which was 3 minutes ago.  They were not busy and plenty of empty tables.  We were seated and the waiter came after about 10 minutes and we asked for water and bread, and he was so flustered and asked that we give HIM a minute, seriously.  We had to flag down three different employees to get water and straws. We will never return and will not recommend this place to anyone.  Disorganized employees, slow and unfriendly service, and simply not enjoyable."
Hide M.,"El Granada, CA",409,71,25,2.0,1/30/2016,"Under new management within the last year and new chefs. I've gotten raw chicken on their Thai platter to cold steak Diane and shrimp scampi :/. Very unimpressed at their kitchen staff. Manager and wait staff has been good in trying to resolve these issues for us though and only reason why they get 2 stars from me. Also, deepening on when you go.... The wait can be extremely long on top of it. Oh well."
Aniko N.,"Redwood City, CA",16,321,245,1.0,2/12/2016,Don't ever order take out here. It's better to dine in than take out. Took them 15 min before they ordered my food. Kinda weird when they have some much worker standing around and no one can help take my order. Than the worst part it took 50 minutes to get my togo ready and the restaurant wasnt crowded either.
John K.,"San Francisco, CA",64,68,10,2.0,1/6/2015,"For the life of me, i will NEVER understand the attraction of the Cheesecake Factory. We came here on New Year's day....when seated, one of our spoons had....you guessed it....unwashed cheesecake on it.   Service was ok....Food...ok.  Just an average (at best) chain restaurant. Paul Martin's is a better choice in this mall."
Greg S.,"Fairfield, CA",27,164,66,4.0,8/27/2014,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is much closer to home than the San Francisco location, so coming here is still special, but you do not get to view Union Square!  Kind of sad but still, the food is great! Ive had happy hour here a few times, (Tables near the bar only, no booths) so pay attention to when those hours are... I think its from 3-6 pm M-F. Food is always good, usually get some sliders and some other mini portion as an appetizer. Drinks are always great, service is great as well, however I do notice that the shift change occurs whenever I am eating, so I fell conflicted on who to tip. I had my 30th Birthday Party here with my family.  I stopped in about 3 hours ahead of time and spoke with the manager because it was a busy Saturday evening, and dinner was around 7-730 so they told me to come back and ""check in"" at 6 (1 hour ahead of time) and they will make sure they have a table ready. I appreciate all the help they provided me on that special day and I was extremely happy with our food, service, and of course, my birthday. This is not a cheap place obviously, but this is not the Ritz.  For a good meal with huge portions, for date night or for a happy hour, this place is great."
Alan G.,"Burlingame, CA",29,38,30,2.0,7/20/2014,"Overrated, overpriced and overstaffed. You would think having one waiter per customer (or at least it seems) would force them to have good service. But somehow the service is still slow and not friendly. I understand that this location is in the mall. And maybe it's wrong of me to expect decent service in a shopping mall, but that's just me if I'm spending $20 - $50 for myself with drinks. Is it too much to ask for someone to refill my water? All of the servers pass by and go talk to other workers. You'll see the server twice the whole night. And they'll expect a big tip for that?! Please.  The food is alright but overpriced. I would rather go to Paul Martins. I'd probably spend more money there (which isn't a problem) and get good service and quality of food."
