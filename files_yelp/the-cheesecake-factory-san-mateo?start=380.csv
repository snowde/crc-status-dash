Jordan C.,"San Francisco, CA",151,454,6,3.0,10/23/2013,"This is a cheesecake factory, so I'll assume you're familiar with it. I've been here about half a dozen times, always for work lunches (birthdays, team lunches, etc). It is A-OK. If you like Cheesecake factory, you will like this one. I like cheesecake factory. Though the ""Kobe"" burger was't that great...I ordered it because work was paying and I thought I'd see if the extra $3 made a difference, but it was actually worse than the say, the Factory Burger. The staff is friendly, restaurant is clean."
Shirley N.,"San Francisco, CA",177,1291,147,3.0,4/4/2013,One nice thing about shopping at the mall is also doing lunch with gal pals. And this was accomplished at Hillsdale shopping center during the week.  The four of us walked in on Wednesday and were seated immediately.  I appreciate the lunch specials. Smaller portion sizes on select entrees.   One of their popular items is their meatloaf. I got the meatloaf lunch special.  Two slices with sides of mashed potatoes and sweet kernel corn.    I purposely just ate half my lunch. Doggie bagged the other half.  Had to leave room for coffee and a slice of creamy cheesecake.  One of my fave is the dulce de leche.   As no one else wanted dessert I asked the server to put my dessert and coffee on a separate tab.  $11.42 inc tax.  Add that on top of my lunch and I paid $27 total.  On the way out I perused the cheesecakes in the display case.  The red velvet cheesecake stood out.
T F.,"San Mateo, CA",0,14,,1.0,8/21/2015,"My wife and I had a light dinner and I order a California Cheese steak Sandwich. When i took the 1st bite i thought the meat tasted like it was cooked near the fish because it had a fowl taste to it . When i took  the second bite i realized the meat actually was  bad and  tasted old . The manager was informed and told me that maybe i wasn't used to that specific cut of meat and that our food is handle properly . I said no It's bad and taste   OLD. So,  I was offered a free piece of cheese cake  (big whoop ).  I would of thought  something more should of been done because our dinner was ruined and  I was concerned about getting sick ...(Food posioning is a horrible experience). They didn't charge me for the dinner but charged my wife . I think the right thing to was to comp the entire meal because my wife plate was only $12 POOR EXPERIENCE AT THE CCF  By the way ,California cheese steak sandwich should be renamed  Road Kill Cheese Steak ..."
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,3.0,8/6/2015,"I came here because it was close to where I was staying for work, just a quick Uber ride away, and it was National Cheesecake Day! I arrived before 6pm so our wait was minimal, just around 15 minutes I think. After 6pm it looked pretty packed so I'm glad we got there when we did. Our waiter was very nice, but sometimes slow. Our entrees were okay...I wasn't crazy about what I ordered. I was trying to go on the healthier side so I got grilled salmon with broccoli. I wasn't crazy about the salmon and it also didn't seem cooked enough for my liking. The broccoli had a weird taste to it and I wasn't crazy about that either. The mashed potatoes were the best tasting part, but obviously not the healthiest. And since it was National Cheesecake Day, we did indulge and share a piece of the Smores Cheesecake. It was okay...I would try a different kind next time. Overall, I'd say the food was average, but it was a nice plaza and the service was friendly. Also, the drinks were great!"
Carmen C.,"San Francisco, CA",177,227,268,4.0,12/10/2014,"i LOVE cheesecake factory, especially this one! The SF downtown one will always have at least a 30 min- 1.5 hr wait, but i have never waited more than 5 minutes here. Very spacious and well lighted from the windows. A lot more clean and parking is a breeze. Food is just like any other cheesecake factory and service is great as well. Can't go wrong with cheesecake here! Pro -large space, plenty of seating -less waiting time"
Joseph Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",786,55,,4.0,3/1/2015,"The Pasta Da Vinci is a light pasta to check out. My friend and I missed the CalTrain, and the bartender was really friendly and relatable."
Eddy T.,"Long Beach, CA",30,15,23,4.0,2/28/2014,"I like the variety of choices in this place so i visit it pretty often. Ambience is good. Music is not bad and its volume is not loud. Basically you can converse easily. Service is excellent. Always very attentive and never had any problems with the orders. Food is good. I prefer their chicken menu. I like the lightly breaded chicken choices (they have 2). Large portions, tasty and well layed out.  I like their tostada salad but the 'sheila' salad is not recommended. Its filled with tortilla chips and the sauce is not nice. I love their cheescakes. Fresh banana cheescake is great and the original is a must try.  Hope this helps..."
Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,4.0,10/1/2013,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory for a team dinner after work one evening.  We went about 6pm and were able to get a table right away.  There was no one waiting when we got there.  I guess it was early enough not to have a wait yet.  The ones in San Jose seem to have a line no matter what time of the day you go. We started with the avocado egg rolls.  They were very good.  Anything with avocado works for me.  I had the mushroom burger with no onions for my entree.  The meat was cooked nicely and I loved the flavor of the mushrooms and sauce on the burger.  I had a side salad instead of fries.  It was standard side salad but was fine.  Good ranch dressing.   I also had a strawberry lemonade to drink.  It was really tasty.  Fresh strawberries are used in it.   My coworkers seemed to like their meals too - one had a steak, one had the luau salad and one had one of the chicken dishes on the skinny menu."
Christian B.,"Hayward, CA",5,8,12,4.0,2/27/2015,"We had to wait like 10 minutes during a busy hour. We were seated in a private booth and the waiter named Rami was so nice and energetic with us. If you got him as your server, you are lucky because he constantly checked up on us and made sure everything was perfect. At first we got some cold bread but he brought out another batch that was warm. My girlfriend and I ordered the usual chicken Bellagio and it was fantastic. The taste of the chicken with the ham and with the pasta was delicious. We also had the tuxedo cheesecake which was tasty and highly recommended if you're a chocolate lover."
Idris A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,10,,4.0,3/12/2016,I came with my mom and her friend the service wasn't that good the food was delicious but the fruits were sour. I still like the Cheesecake Factory it's better than going somewhere else.
Rose S.,"Los Altos, CA",74,2,1,4.0,8/22/2016,Small plate- Kale salad.....favorites all time. And house wheat bread under $10 tips and all.
Wolfie M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,133,285,1.0,8/8/2015,"Wish i can give it no star cuz my pasta was dried with no sauce. They have no imagination in cooking. I order Chicken Madeira with pasta instead of mashed potatoes. They did not try cooking my pasta with the sauce. The dried up pasta just laid there..ahhh My daughter ordered Di Vinci which was tasty but needed more sauce. My husbands Asian chicken salad was small & boring. Lettuce was wilted..no crunch. So sad. Every Time we come the dishes get smaller, and taste so so boring. All they have to do is cook the pasta with the sauce to make it juicy & tasty. Terrible. Don't plan on coming back. Run"
Lydia C.,"Union City, CA",48,188,21,5.0,8/17/2014,"I honestly think this place has it all.  To be honest - I've only been here on week nights, and only for dinner.  However, I have never had to wait more than ten minutes to be seated.  The waiters have always been very friendly and helpful.  One of the high points was when my parents both ordered the same dish and the waiter actually told them, ""You know, this is a big dish, you can probably share it.""  He then brought them their order, split on to two plates, and they had two meals for the price of one.  And he was right - there was plenty for the two of them.  Their servings are very generous and I always have enough to take home for a second meal.  The wait staff is also good at refilling water and iced tea, even offering to refill when they drop off the check. I love their bread - the honey wheat is delicious.  The menu is extensive - perhaps too big - but there will definitely be something for everyone.  I always go for the Skinnylicious selections, and I have never been disappointed.  Oh yeah  they have cheesecake too!  About fifty different ones.  If you can't find one you like, take a chill pill, because you are way too picky."
H. H.,"Millbrae, CA",9,118,122,3.0,10/14/2013,"This place is hard to rank. I would give it a five for their cheesecakes. But I am not really a big fan of their food. Service is just okay. Hubby and I went here for a lunch. We waited for about half an hour for our turn. I ordered a raspberry lemonade and a kobe burger, and hubby ordered some garlic noodle. Food portion here is huge. I found my burger to be too salty. My sweet potato fries were good. Hubby didn't quite like his garlic noodles and found it way too heavy. We ordered a 30th anniversary cheesecake and it was really good. I love all their cheesecakes in fact.  Their service here is so and so. Nothing impressive. I don't think the food is worth the wait. I will just come back for their cakes."
Madie M.,"Pacifica, CA",0,3,3,1.0,9/25/2015,"I went today for a late lunch/early dinner. Our server was nice. I ordered the fish tacos. I ate two and when I went to grab another, there was a freaking rubber band in it. A blue rubber band. Like come on now. Seriously? I took a picture of my food before I ate it and I looked back at it. And sure enough it was peeking out the side. They need to look at the food before they serve it. The manager wasn't even great about it. Yeah he took it off our bill but didn't even discount us for the inconvenience or anything. He apologized but wasn't really sincere. I lost my appetite."
Kari G.,"San Mateo, CA",236,754,221,4.0,8/30/2015,"I know that a lot of people on Yelp rag on the Cheesecake Factory for being generic. I love it though. The beet salad is delicious. I love the large chunks of goat cheese. I also enjoy the bread they put out on the table. So soft and delicious. My favorite drink is the blueberry mojito. The passion fruit martini is also delicious! The cheesecake list is endless! There is frequently a long wait on Friday and Saturdays. Luckily, you can shop while you wait!"
EDITHA D.,"San Mateo, CA",5,1,1,1.0,7/14/2016,"Dunno who was having a worst night, myself or the restaurant.  Very, very, very disappointing experience tonight.  Never even got a dinner out of the visit.  Ordered the eggplant parmigiana and were told like 15 minutes later they had run out of it but did not update the server.  So, back to the menu to figure out what to have for dinner.  It is late so decided to just order a burger and share with my girlfriend.  20-30 minutes and still no burger.  What the %#*#%!!! How long does it take to make one burger?!! Did they run out of hamburger meat also and forgot to update the server!!!!  Fed up so walked out.  This is the worst ever. UGH!!!!  UGH!!!!!"
Gen Q.,"Bay Area, CA",35,9,,5.0,1/8/2015,"I went to have lunch with some friends here a few days ago and I wanted to write a review mainly for what happened at the end of our dining experience. I had brought some late Christmas gifts for someone at the lunch and in the process of handing a gift across the table I knocked over a bottle of olive oil breaking it and it began to spill across the table! We tried to contain it with all of our napkins and some baby wet wipes while a friend went to get someone to help us out. Of course I felt absolutely terrible for making the mess but the young man who came over to help, who I believe was also the host, named Anthony was unbelievably gracious and helped clear the table while cracking jokes to get me to stop apologizing. That could have easily irritated (understandably) any employee and I could have been given the stank eye and the silent treatment! Anyway, I just wanted to give Anthony a 5-star review for his wonderful service and great attitude!"
Margaret D.,"San Bruno, CA",1,4,,5.0,10/23/2015,"This Cheese Cake Factory location at the Hillsdale Mall was amazing! The servers Jack and Jasmine were both attentive and provided all that was needed. We ordered fried calamari & chicken quesadillas for the appetizer. As for the main meal, I ordered the Tomato Bazil Mozzarella pasta and some more of the brown bread and butter which is complementary. The ambiance is slightly dim in the exterior and there are high ceilings as the decor as well as high and wide glass windows to view the outside's weather. Overall, the whole experience is lovely. It would be even more great to have more money from the gift card that was given for a birthday gift and I would be more than happy to return to this location since there is no parking hassle as oppose to the 8th floor Cheese Cake Factory in San Francisco. We will definitely go back to the location because of the great experience!!!"
Jisun L.,"Milpitas, CA",4,97,100,3.0,7/20/2015,"food here was awesome! service could use a lot of work. here is what i ordered. fried mac and cheese- divine but could have been hotter, came out warm fried zucchini, portabella mushroom and avocado- delicious skinny menu steak medallions with veggies- simply awesome!  the server could have checked up on me a bit more and ensured the basics were delivered on time. as she was busy talking it up with another customer at the bar.  I had to ask for the water to be refilled. I had to ask for my basket of bread while waiting for the appetizers. I had to ask to order my cheesecake."
