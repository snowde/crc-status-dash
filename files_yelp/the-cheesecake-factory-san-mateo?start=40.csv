Mariah B.,"Union City, CA",345,6,,1.0,12/10/2017,"I came here for my birthday and was told I had a 40 minute wait. The first thing was I asked for a table for 5 and they wrote me down for a table for 2 and we ended up having to wait longer for an available table. They tried to scramble up a small table that could not seat any of us comfortably so we had to wait even longer for them to actually accommodate us with an adequately sized table. While we were waiting I overheard a hostess asking a customer for their number, I misinterpreted the conversation and thought they had a texting system that would let you know when your table was ready. However, when I asked if I could put my number down for texting updates, the hostess rudely cut me off and said that wasn't an option and proceeded to sarcastically me and explain what texting systems are and she doesn't have the capability to ""text every single person who is waiting for a table"". I then explained that I had heard her ask another woman for her number and thought that she was putting her number down so she could get text updates. The hostess kept cutting me off and looking at me crazy and didn't help me understand the context of that conversation. So, annoyed, i left to wait for my table...just to hear her give ANOTHER Customer the option to put their number down so they can get called when their table was ready....literally all i wanted was the option to be contacted when my table was ready. Whether or not it was a phone call or text the host knew what I was asking for because I asked her how if I could walk around the mall for a little while I was waiting and not miss my table being called.  Now fast forward to the meal, my sister ordered calamari and after about a 25-30 minutes everyone's meals were served except for the calamari. It took us another 10 minutes to catch the attention of a server who then told us that it was ""unservable"" but for 40 minutes never told us. On top of that I ordered a spicy chicken pasta and it was extremely sweet and so I had to send it back and our waitress walked past our table multiple times without coming to retake my sisters order or mine. We had to walk up and ask her to come back. We ended up asking to get the orders to go but they still served the meals on plates so we had to wait again as they put our meals in to go boxes. Overall our service was extremely crappy. And as ""apologetic"" as the workers were that didn't replace the effort or attention they could have put in knowing that we were all visibly upset.  Needless to say I won't be coming back."
Amie C.,"Cupertino, CA",0,5,2,1.0,8/31/2017,"Ordered the Thai lettuce wraps for takeout and when we opened the container at home, there was only three small pieces of chicken and No dipping sauces. Suppose to come with three sauces and looks like 6 pieces of chicken based on photo online. Truly disappointed in this takeout order, which is generally good when we dine in the restaurant."
Joey Z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,4,1.0,11/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is well known for their awesome desserts although a little pricey, it's worth it. But my memory of the Restaurant at the Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo CA should be a wake up for management to create a plan of action when things get hectic. I was waiting at the to-go counter to get a slice, maybe two of my favorite cheesecakes. The young man behind the counter seemed to have several technical difficulties at the cash register. Therefore catering to one customer for over 30 minutes. Meanwhile the line started to grow. And since the crowd would not fit the welcoming area, the one line became two or three. I also noticed an older couple claiming to be in front of me but I know for sure the husband wasn't. I asked the person at the front desk if that was the only cash register that took take out orders and she said that that was it. Um....where is management's plan B on this? Why are they allowing customers to get impatient so as to verbally abuse their employees? Oh yeah there was one who was in a dress shirt and tie who tried to assist our poor young man behind the takeout counter with the technical difficulty but left him again and again by himself unresolved resulting for that young man to run across the restaurant a few times, talk about safety issues. SO - I just left and told the person at the front that that poor employee had to cater to one customer for over 30 minutes. I had to leave before I would have said something I might regret - Lesson here is: Stay  away from the Cheesecake Factory from Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo during peak hours because management seem to not have the skill to train their employees what to do to ease crowd control"
Ran T.,"Denver, CO",101,461,190,2.0,11/29/2016,"Like everyone else said, dim light, very slow service and it took forever to get a table even though the restaurant is not that busy. Even the cheesecake has gone downhill. We ordered a chocolate cheesecake and for some reasons I can't taste any cheese in it. It tasted more like a caramel cake than a chocolate cheese cake."
Kiley G.,"Fremont, CA",28,15,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Worst service ever ! The food we order wasn't fresh , good or even warm , I got the teriyaki chicken, the rice looked like it had cilantro on it we asked someone to check on it see if it was before I eat it , it took him almost 20 minutes to come back to our table and tell us it was parsley, after thinking it was cilantro I was pretty much done , as well as hearing  that moms teriyaki chicken wasn't very good or warm , I just told them to give us our money back . Poor service, the ingredients should be clearly spelled out on the menu do to allergies!"
Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",34,114,653,2.0,1/26/2017,"I am normally satisfied whenever I eat at Cheesecake Factory but this time, I was not that pleased. The best part of dinner was having the free tasty brown bread and butter served before the meal and the classic caesar salad which was fresh and good. However, the main dishes were unsatisfactory. The pasta in the shrimp scampi was bland and the shrimp tasted burnt. The bacon burger and fries were just ordinary. The calamari, which is my favorite appetizer there, seemed more oily than usual. The server was nice and very pleasant though."
Vishali N.,"San Mateo, CA",0,18,20,1.0,11/30/2016,"Good food. But they say ""wait or leave"". Attitude problems. Very busy restaurant. Don't care attitude."
sharon f.,"Valencia, CA",66,96,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Let's do this review in real time.   Driving home from SF we decided to pick up some to go food from Cheesecake Factory. We called when we were in south San Francisco, no one answered. Tried again, got a pick up and transferred, I was on hold until I parked and walked in to order my food. That's 23 min. later.  I walk up to the bakery to order my food and take a lap around the mall, 20 min later I check on my food and told it would be a few more minutes.  I've been waiting 30+ and counting for chicken strips and pasta. No apology, no managers around."
Jewels V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",13,39,14,1.0,4/30/2017,"Slow service. Rude workers. Horrible food. You would be better off eating lukewarm leftovers from last month.  Whej we first got there, we are the complementary bread, which was delicious, so we thought we were in for a treat. Wrong! Every thing we got after the bread was a downhill ride that never seemed to have any upward potential. The mojito tasted like it was mixed by a bartended who specializes in jungle juice. The orders or Thai wraps had no depth of flavor. Definitely amateur hour there. We also ordered the jambalaya and shrimp pasta. The description sounded good. The actual taste left a strange craving for something other than what was brought to us.  Despite their long lines, the food left something to be desired.  So come for the cheesecake (we heard but didn't try). Stay away if you're looking for a semblance of a meal."
Charlie B.,"San Mateo, CA",431,578,3196,3.0,4/21/2017,"uh, the menu here is a BOOK no, really, its a book too many pages so you have to wonder how is it possible to make ALL this food and for it to be good - is it frozen? pare it down to the items you can do well...seriously!"
Evelyn S.,"Arnold, CA",143,4,,1.0,11/5/2017,"This review is for this particular location's service and food (as opposed to Cheesecake Factory as a company).  Spent 2.5 hrs here with little to no attention from our server. Food was pretty bland and took over 30 min to get to our table, again with no check in from our server. We asked for a cheesecake ahead of time since we were celebrating a birthday and instead we got a cheesecake to go and the bill dropped off on the table in passing...manager tried to talk to us after we complained that we never got the second slice or the whole birthday experience, but we had already paid for the whole bill and didn't get offered any sort of compensation in return.  Overpriced for mediocre food, and terrible service tonight. Wouldn't recommend you celebrate any birthdays here either, they can't seem to keep up with their customers and this was during an off time (around 2:30-5).  $100 meal for 4 can be better spent anywhere else."
Dee C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,106,44,1.0,6/22/2017,100 Db Kenny G.    If you like to be blasted with pop music at a level where you. Ant have an intelligent conversation / this is the place for you.  Long wait times. Good service and the food was fine.  Not my idea of ambience
Sharla O.,"Oakland, CA",1,6,6,1.0,4/29/2017,This star is because I had to give one out. Horrible service! I placed four orders for my coworkers and myself fifteen minutes prior to arriving. I was told that the order would be ready in 20 minutes. 45 minutes later the manager was notified of our dilemma (lunch order not ready) and didn't not provide any solutions... He was nonchalant and disregarding of our whole ordeal... mind you we were on our lunch break. Jeremey the manager is a poor representation of the brand.  I will NOT come back nor will my coworkers to this location!!!!  Very embarrassing to say the least especially since I recommended the Cheese Cake Factory! Never AGAIN!
Lee K.,"San Francisco, CA",470,377,330,2.0,3/19/2016,"INCONSISTENCY is the only consistent thing about this place. Like so many chain restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory has a hard time with consistency in quality, availability, and service.  We've had some REALLY GOOD dishes here... only to return and be disappointed with REALLY BAD versions of the same dishes.  Often items on the menu are not even available. One of my favorite dishes is the lemon chicken served with carrots, greens, and mashed potatoes.  When done well, it's truly a work of art.  But sometimes, it turns out to be a disaster with dry, overcooked meat and dried up lemon sauce.  On one visit, I ordered it for dinner only to be told 10 minutes later that it was not available.  Really?!  By the time, the server returned to take my ""new"" order, I was 20 min behind schedule with the rest of my party and completely out of synch. I've had similar highs and lows with plenty of other dishes on the menu. The huevos rancheros used to be another favorite of mine... but they switched things up and no longer serve it on corn tortillas.  Instead they use super greasy, fried tortilla shells and spiced up the dish a lot. My wife introduced me to the coconut curry chicken and shrimp and it was heavenly.  So, on my next visit I ordered it and it was over seasoned and disgusting. Service is also very inconsistent.  In a recent visit, they served my younger son a raw hamburger.  So, we asked to have another one cooked for him. Our server told us he would put a rush order in.   15 minutes later after the rest of us finished our food and having not seen our server, I had to track down a manager and inquire about my son's burger.    We were told that the order had not been placed. Oh, by they way, Cheesecake Factory when are you going to stop using transfats in your cheesecake?"
Beatrice T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",57,52,130,3.0,7/9/2017,"Hershey's chocolate cheesecake is probably always the only reason why we come here when we start craving for cheesecakes. I usually order the Vino Pasta for my main meal. It's all right. Big portions but dishes here are overpriced for their main dishes. They have comfort food and a variety of dishes to choose from but the prices are not worth the food. It's meh. I just want to eat the chocolate cheesecake, bottom line..."
Meenakshi T.,"Redwood City, CA",136,135,261,2.0,10/12/2016,"I really wanted to like the Cheesecake Factory - this was our first time here and I got my son here for his pre-birthday celebrations ( he hits double digits - turns ten on the 14th ). We were warned portions are large - I ordered the Kale Salad ( and could only finish half of it - he ordered the southern chicken sliders from the kids menu and finished just one slider. The meals tasted fine - not extra ordinary. However, our meal took an abnormally long time to be served ~ 1 hour even though we came before rush hour. We ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheese Cake - the Cheesecake is my sole reason for the 2 stars - it's heaven for the mouth and hell for a diet all rolled into one. My son loved the cheesecake but wasn't able to eat more than 4 bites.Will I be back - time will tell!"
Cat C.,"San Jose, CA",202,25,4,2.0,10/22/2016,"Dined here with my three year old on an impromptu mommy and daughter date.  I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory restaurants since the service is usually attentive, fast, and food is consistently good. Must haves when dining with a toddler.  Food - I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich and it came out burnt. My daughter had the mac and cheese kids meal. The cheese sauce was broken and grainy. I had to send back both entrees. I rarely ever do that.  Service - Our server came by after ten minutes of us being seated. Drinks and bread did not come until another fifteen minutes. My entree came out with the wrong sauces. We were charged twice for an item.  We were hungry, disappointed, and wasted over an hour of our date. We spoke to the manager and he offered to take the entrees off the bill since it was almost bedtime and there was no time to remake. Two stars for that. Probably would not return to this location."
Susie C.,"San Francisco, CA",21,36,,4.0,5/18/2017,"I recently went there With my niece ( for the first time ). The decor was beautiful, and  service was great! We had Mojitos, I had the pineapple one which was refreshing but didn't seem to have much alcohol in it. The Southwestern Bbq chicken salad although, it was delicious it was a lot and we couldn't finish it! We also had the asian inspired cauliflower a little on the spicy side, but it was okay, we also ordered both chicken and beef sliders which were really good, my fave was the beef slider. Now the cheesecake, I ordered for my kids and I; all delicious...Hershey's bar, tiramisu, and the CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CRUNCH CHEESECAKE- this one was sooooo yummy."
DANIEL W.,"San Mateo, CA",77,35,80,2.0,6/7/2017,"It must be Wednesday's not crowed poor service food ok got in before happy ended but without waiters by the time some one came to our table happyhour just ended so not happy if it wasn't  for the gift card we would of went somewhere else,,chains come and chains go wish black angus would take this over"
Abel G.,"Overland Park, KS",0,41,11,5.0,10/18/2017,How is the rating for this location so low? I went for dinner and aside from wait I was completely satisfied! (never been to CF and expected there to be NO wait) Food options are always plentiful and service is always impeccable! Had the Thai Lettuce Wraps and they were phenomenally fresh and tasty! Sorry everywhere else- these are the best! Ordered the truffle honey chicken with asparagus and the chicken was juicy and the truffle seasoning really cut through the grease and gave this dish a surprisingly refreshing and new taste! You can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes- had the Adams PB Fudge slice and it was so delicious! TVs were showing the playoffs and NBA season kickoff- what more could you ask for??!! See you again soon!!
