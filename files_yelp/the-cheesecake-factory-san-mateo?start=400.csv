Harsha G.,"San Jose, CA",531,562,1332,5.0,12/2/2012,"I love cheesecake so much that the day my brother landed in the US I brought him here to grab a quick snack directly from the airport on our way home :) We had the key lime, the red velvet(my favorite) and the chocolate tuxedo cake and loved all of them. For a friend's bday, we ordered the anniversary chocolate cake and the bday girl and all our friends just loved it. Writing this review, makes me crave cheesecake. Too bad the calorie counter in my head has waged a battle on the craving :)"
Paul G.,"Pescadero, CA",18,293,4,4.0,10/23/2014,"I have always had a great time here.  The staff is very friendly, and makes you feel like you are important.  The menu is huge, so there will not be a problem finding something to eat or drink.  I have never had a bad meal at any of their stores.  They are always busy, but I never felt rushed to get out so that they could turn the table.  Lots of parking, because it is attached to the mall, which I like."
Derrick S.,"San Mateo, CA",1,11,,1.0,2/6/2016,"This will be our first and last review of this place as we will never come back.  Apparently, they forgot to prepare one of our dishes and left the others under their heat lamps in excess of 30 minutes.  The pasta was rock hard and had a dark color on top where it was not in contact with moisture.  The French dip was ok but served on a hamburger bun?  The server did offer to remake the pasta dishes but after waiting an hour for our food, we decided to just go.  It would have been nice for the server to recognize that the pasta dishes were out too long and to have them remade prior to serving.  The kitchen has always taken forever here and there is a shame that nothing has improved.   Believe the 3 star average for this place."
Tarra R.,"Pismo Beach, CA",123,68,2,2.0,7/20/2015,"So, so, so dissapointed ...   I had been to a location in NY and had THE BEST veggie burger EVER and was hoping to have it again.  Tonight we went to this location and it was quite the opposite.  The service was standard, I thought it could've been better, but it was sufficient.    We ordered the pesto asparagus  rigatoni  and the veggie burger.  Both dishes were completely  underwhelming!   However, the mushroom appetizer was pretty good.  And our friend ordered chicken tenders and was happy with his meal."
Stormtrooper N.,"Daly City, CA",0,89,23,4.0,8/20/2014,"Friendly service, consistently good food and the best cheesecake around.  A solid dinner choice for any night of the week."
Peleg S.,"Belmont, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/4/2016,"Treble service !!! If you make a pick up order you may think twice.. Every time I'm trying to make a pick up order it's takes me hours!!! 1st you need to wait on the line for someone to be able to take your order for 15-10 min'! Then to wait more than 45 minutes!!! For your order to be ready! And I'm talking for at list 5 times that it's happened to me! More on this, when I came to take my order after I was waiting all this time they forgot to put me all I asked for inside my beg. And in the front desk wait some more minutes to somebody who can help you! And when I was trying to explain them how much time I was waiting and the mistakes in my orders. No one seems to be interesting to listen. Like I'm just anther one of a million costumers that isn't happy!"
Susan B.,"Hayward, CA",186,46,91,3.0,12/2/2015,"I ordered pan seared Salmon with angle hair pasta and spinach. It was very good but the spinach had some strange black hard foreign matter in it. I sent it back, they brought me new spinach that was perfect.  It should have been perfect the first time."
Eric N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,3,5.0,1/21/2015,"Great food, fantastic atmosphere, but the best part of the experience would be the staff. Specifically I would like to recognize Mel for being fantastic during our visit. She elevated the experience at this restaurant from 100% to 120%. I dont often ask to speak to a manager after but I felt compelled to tell them how fantastic she was.  I would have done the survey on the receipt if it hadn't been for the fact I misplaced it.  Thank you and we will be back!!"
Dana D.,"San Bruno, CA",63,9,1,1.0,2/2/2017,"I've never had a good experience at this location. Rice is crunchy, food is cold, and service is AWFUL. One time I went an hour or so before closing. (Which I know last minute customers are annoying from working in customer service myself). But our waitress was rushing us out like a mad woman! She gave us terrible service and quite frankly she didn't deserve any tip. We paid for the food and got the receipt back. On the tip line we wrote in ""cash"" instead of adding the tip to our card. She then took our receipt, comes back and made this HUGE scene! When she came back to our table, with a disgusting amount of attitude goes, ""Did I miss something? Is it under the table?"" Referring to the tip money.. she was even looking under the table for the tip money acting out. I was so shocked. How unprofessional can you be lady!!!??? I think we gave her a $1 and left, seriously. Giving one star just for the cheesecake itself."
Shadi K.,"San Francisco, CA",93,175,115,4.0,12/18/2014,"Typical Cheese cake Factory, new location, parking isn't that Bad.  shout out for premier service by Rami, Nisreen, Z, and Chris. These guys provide superb, quality, comforting experice."
Aarti B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,19,2,1.0,1/31/2016,"Had a poor take out experience here. They forgot to give us a slice of cheesecake but charged us for it, and when we called them back about it, we were on hold for twenty minutes."
V W.,"Las Vegas, NV",572,602,197,3.0,9/19/2014,"I would usually give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars, but this visit was just a tad disappointing. I ordered an Asian chicken salad and requested no onions and dressing on the side and about 20 minutes later I get a salad with dressing on it. If I weren't watching my macros I would have just eaten the salad, but since I have to be strict with what I eat I had them remake it. Basically by the time I had got the second salad about another 20 minutes had gone by and I was totally starving and kinda hangry. To make matters worse when my salad arrived I tell you the truth that it was just a bunch of puff. An avalanche of lettuce and rice noodles with approximately 2 oz of Mandarins and about 2 - 3 oz of chicken breast. In all honesty if I'm going to be paying $15 for just a salad then you have to at least put a decent amount of chicken so I can actually justify paying this much. In all fairness I would say 5-6 oz would be the right amount for $15 and I'm sure your still making money off my $15 salad. The whole thing was a HUGE let down and I wasn't going to say anything, but when the waitress came and asked how everything was, I simply stated that it wasn't so great, because there was hardly any meat on there. I guess she truly listened to my honest complaint and also acknowledged that it did take a really long time to get my food, because the order got screwed up in the first place. So she decided to comp my meal, which was an awesome generous thing to do. Overall I'm super glad that they decided to make things right and this here is a good example of why I'll keep coming back to Cheesecake Factory. Thanks CF!!!"
RJ R.,"CA, CA",89,12,10,1.0,12/15/2015,"The service was pretty bad. We waited for an hour for our food. After an hour it still hasn't arrived, so we found the manager and told him. We still had to wait another 2p minutes. Because things were taking so long we had been asking for bread and water. We had to ask 3 times for just that to arrive before our meals. The manager offered us free deserts due to the long delay but when it came time for us to pay, the deserts were not offered again. We complained to the host, he just apologized and we left. We ended up spending 3 hours in lunch. It was very disappointing."
Michael K.,"Honolulu, HI",39,45,,2.0,6/21/2015,I was a fan of the cheesecake factory till today.  Came here for father's day brunch today and everything was horrible.  It's like they weren't prepared for the father's day rush.  Our waiter looked flustered and was very insincere.  Our food tasted horrible.  Not the usual cheesecake factory standard.  Everything tasted like oil.  It seemed like they were rushing dishes out because it was so busy.  Even my toddlers french toasted tasted like it was drenched in oil.  Absolutely horrible!
Emily S.,"Austin, TX",28,13,,4.0,2/14/2016,"The food here is my favorite, and if you go early you can usually get seated quickly. However, when it hits the rush for dinner you are most likely going to be waiting an hour, and they run out of buzzers so you have to keep getting back in line to check on your table. However once a you do get seated the service is great!"
Kathryn B.,"San Carlos, CA",0,18,5,5.0,7/25/2016,"We had the most wonderful experience yesterday. A party of 10, we arrived at 10:50 and were seated at 11 AM for Brunch. We were celebrating my 62nd birthday. Our server, Jennifer L. was simply great. Patient and professional, she took our drink order with in minutes of our seating. Drinks came really fast and then she took our orders, offering helpful suggestions to people overwhelmed by the menu. Appetizers arrived in a timely manner, we had time to finish the appetizers and refill our drinks and then the food arrived. Everyone their meal was perfect (they all looked good, we took pictures). They did not rush us even though they were crowded.  What a surprise when my Strawberry Shortcake came in a dish that said Happy Birthday with my name on the edges.  It is only my third visit, but every time has been good, but today was exceptional."
Vilma V.,"San Mateo, CA",5,18,,5.0,12/17/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. I was going to put 4 stars (because the waiting time is tooo much) but l added one more because of the waiter, Alex. First we got a table at the Mall area and all people walking there while we were eating, we didn't like it. We mentioned this to Alex and he ran to find another table for us, more private. I gave the tip to the new waitress and an extra tip to Alex because he helped us to feel right, as customers :)"
Manny G.,"San Mateo, CA",22,22,4,3.0,8/26/2015,"Come here every tuesday to get a fresh strawberry cheesecake slice and its worth it i love it, my girlfriend loves it (reason why i get it every week)  But the service could leave so much to desire last time i got there was this week and usually they ask what i want and once i get it ask if i need a fork, knife and bag the girl that was there this tuesday just handed me the slice with nothing else when asked for a fork she threw it in top had to ask for bag and napkins which she only gave me one like they puts money out her pocket to buy them or maybe cus i wasnt dress nicely as the rest of the people since i jusy got out of my job still a paying costumer right!!! Anyways foods is always great pizza is my favorite from here"
Brittany C.,"Castro Valley, CA",59,27,16,3.0,7/30/2015,Very happy with the service from our server Steven. Food and cheesecake was amazing. Although we were put on a 30 minute wait that turned into an hour. I checked back around 40 mins and they said we were next in line to be sat...but there go 4 more parties. I hadn't eaten all day so I was slightly irritated lol but if you say someone's next to be sat then that's what they expect.
Pavan K.,"San Mateo, CA",42,16,3,4.0,10/19/2015,The california guac salad is mind blowing and extremely filling. Baja churn tortilla and alfredo pasta are amazing dishes too.
