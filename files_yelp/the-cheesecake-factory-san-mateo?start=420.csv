Lisa W.,"San Francisco, CA",17,129,4,1.0,6/9/2015,"Food here is usually a-ok, but on my most recent visit, the service and food has gone down.  I ordered Chinese Chicken salad which was great, but my poor husband ordered the Everything Pizza to eat with our son...and it came BURNT.  Ninety-nine percent of the pepperonis were burnt as well as the crust.  I clearly saw it under their dim lighting and I gave him this look....and he's like it's ok.  No, it's NOT OK.  So when our server came to check on us, I had it sent back.  If you're bringing food to the tables, you would think the servers would look at the food and see if that's what they really want to serve their patrons....GARBAGE.  JUST SO WRONG.  No apologies. Won't be coming back here in a long time."
Darya D.,"Millbrae, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2016,"Went here for dinner with my friend they said the wait was 20 mins  but really was over 30. The food was great except the fries came out way to late for us to even eat.. We had already had the bill.. But these aren't the real reason that I'm giving them zero stars.  We leave and get to the car and realize my friend doesn't have his phone so we rush back in and its not on the table... We go to a manager and tell them and they say "" well phones are a hot commodity"" like it was a joke.. So brand new iPhone 6+ is gone withing 5 mins and is off. We ask them to check the cameras and they insist on not doing so and for us just to report it to apple. Clearly something else was going on... So are only other option was to call the cops. Hopefully it turns up"
Jay S.,"San Mateo, CA",633,74,22,2.0,5/26/2016,"I don't generally review chains, but I was pretty disappointed in my experience last night. Ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. I have enjoyed this many times in the past but have not had it recently. The recipe seems to have changed. The sauce was much more thin and there was a ridiculously large amount of (overly) toasted coconut on top. It changed the whole texture and flavor profile of the dish and I ate less than a quarter of it before letting my server know I was disappointed in it. She simply asked ""Have you actually had the dish before?"" It should be a manager's job to troubleshoot my complaint, not hers. If there's a guest complaint, a manager needs to get involved. To her credit, she did apologize, but no manager visited the table to address my concern; she most likely didn't tell a manager at all. In any event, subsequently, she didn't take it off the bill or even offer a replacement dish. The server was friendly besides that and gave reasonably good service, but not sure if I'll be returning. The consistency I've come to expect from Cheesecake Factory seems to be declining."
Rebecca O.,"Oak Knoll - Redwood Park, Redwood City, CA",25,29,7,1.0,9/21/2015,The service is horrendous.  I've frequently eaten at this location and it never gets better with the service.  Today the front attendant was totally clueless. Mind you they have more than 70% open tables.  Because k have a stroller she puts us all the way in the back and says there is no room for us to sit.  Oh please!!!! It's almost a crime to have a stroller and try to eat at this place.   Just got up and walked out.
Lauren W.,"South San Francisco, CA",14,30,17,5.0,4/23/2014,"I have been to this location a couple times now. & My best experience was w/ this Waiter named Brandon a few weeks ago. He was the absolute SWEETEST!! I swear, the second my cup was 1/3 left. He had my refill ready. He was on top of everything from the appetizer to the desert!  I came here for Easter dinner & man was I dissapointed.. The waitress was rude & brought us our appetizers burned, & the artichoke dip was cold. Yet, it took 30 mins to be brought to us.  Honestly, if I ever come here again.. I'll have made prior reservations to sit in Brandons section ! He was so sweet & on time w/everything. He made dinner enjoyable & I just felt he deserved some credit!  Thank you Brandon for being a Hard & dedicated worker!"
Tati C.,"Redwood City, CA",5,3,,1.0,10/25/2015,Very dissapointed with their service. Waited over 25 minutes for just a pick up order
Aj M.,"San Mateo, CA",141,10,,1.0,12/24/2015,Called in an order and went a half an hour later only for them to tell us they didn't even register our order in the system. We asked how long it would be and they said 45 minuets. They didn't even apologize for their mistake.   Obviously they have some airheads working there. I don't think taking phone orders should be that difficult. Don't go here unless you wanna waste your time. Ill make sure to let anyone I know to not go here.
Sunny S.,"Redwood City, CA",2,21,3,2.0,10/18/2014,"Been here many times before, and I am regret this place is going downhill. Came around 10pm for late night snack, food and drink were served timely. However, the waitress girl then disappeared for a long time, my daughter was saying she's thirsty few times, we finally had to get up to the bar and asked for refill the kids drink, bartender just point us back to the wait staff. Finally the waitress came, told us there is additional charges for refill, then took the cup and disappear again! After 10 minutes she went back and asked ""everything good?"" Duh... The pasta we ordered felt like been sitting for a while and just a rough microwave heat up, and in the area we sat ( close to bar and kitchen) we heard at least 3 glass shattered or plates drop on the floor. Sigh, I just wish I have at decent place to go after 9pm, is it really that hard?"
Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,2.0,7/31/2012,"2 stars seems harsh, but it's fair at the same time because it really is, ""Meh, I've experienced better.""  I came on National Cheese Cake Day (July 30, 2012) and my friend and I expected it to be busy -- it wasn't. They were able to seat us right away, in front of the bathroom. Yup, of all the tables they had, they chose to seat us in front of the bathroom. I kept staring at the ""Restroom"" sign at the top of the door entrance. Okay, the bathroom thing wasn't that big of a deal since it didn't smell, I didn't hear toilet/sink noses, and it's a good walk to the potty. But really, half the restaurant was empty and we get seated in front of the bathroom. Our server was relatively friendly and checked up on us. But not once did we get water refills. The complementary bread wasn't brought out until requested. When the bread came out, it was hard and lukewarm. The butter was solid and cold. I had my favorite dish: salisbury steak with mash potatoes and string beans My entree came out warm, not as hot as other location. Because of the coolness, it took the pa-zzas out of it for me. The meal wasn't as staisfying. The salibury steak also tasted a bit old and not as fresh.Another thing I noticed was that they added pepper to my beans. Pepper was never added to my dish, ever, at all the Cheese Cake Factory locations I've been to. I took the meal home after about 10 bites and ate the rest for dinner. Tasted better, but definitely could have more potential.  My friend and I also ordered the avocado eggrolls. This was delicious! The sauce makes it so much better. It tastes best as soon as it comes out because once it cools doesn't taste as good.  For dessert, naturally, we had cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake to be exact. It was tasty the first few bites but then it started getting too thick because of all the cream and too sweet, again because of the cream. I wish they had more bread to the cheesecake.  The avocado eggrolls were the highlight of the meal. It was disappointing because my friend and I were really looking forward to National Cheese Cake Day. Maybe next time!"
Juan F.,"San Francisco, CA",7,7,15,1.0,11/12/2015,I came here last year now I know why I never came back.. The service here sucks been almost 3 1/2 hr and still have not gotten desert yet. Servers suck food sucked everything sucked I will never come back again. To bad I can't give less than a star.  o recommend not to come here I wouldn't bring my worst enemy here
Nelle L.,"Monterey Heights, San Francisco, CA",0,108,12,4.0,4/26/2014,One of the better fast food American grill places. Our server Benny was attentive and very eager to please which is refreshing snd a plus especially when you have to wait 45mins for table on sat dinner at the mall. It was long wait after a long day of shopping so the kids are hungry and cranky but our server again very good to bring the water and fabulous brown wheat bread. What a lifesaver.  We were quick to order since everyone is famished and incredibly the food was fast and good.  The lemon shrimp pasta deserve a mention and the special of the day is Thai baised salmon which is not in the regular menu and quite a good choice too.  Too bad we didn't have room for dessert but all agree to return another day just for dessert  Overall nice pleasant Sat dinner at the mall and its our server Benny that maked the difference.
Beverly M.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,6,,3.0,7/20/2016,I always come in and sit at the bar today my bartender lady was not there no one at the host desk so I used the restroom came back and a guy with a man bun was at the desk he said no wait but his co worker would seat me so I waited finally she arrived and I was sat 10 feet away from the hostess desk I was surprised man bun guy made me wait for that whatever...I had two cosmos that were excellent and the spinach dip the dip was cold had the hot beef sandwich it was cold my server was nice but told me she saw my food sitting on the counter and apologize it was served by the food runner cold if you saw it why didn't you pull it ? Anyways I ate it cold I was not feeling well because I had not ate the server did offer to heat it 60$ for cold food not even a discount whatever next time I'll wait for my Latino lady at the bar I think she's night shift she's always makes sure everything is perfect love her
Kat P.,"Mountain View, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/19/2016,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to several of them and was never disappointed with the food, although a bit over-priced. Last Sunday I came here wanting to try the pizza. I asked the server and she said she loves their pizza. I had a cocktail first $13.50!!! Then she brought the pizza but I decided to take it home because I had already got full on cocktail and bread. Once I tasted the pizza I couldn't believe it. I think another reviewer stated it was like licking a salt-lick. That is the honest truth. I couldn't even finish the margherita pizza because of the salt! Terrible, and at $13. I expected better. I will stick to my regular skinny meal next time. For a cocktail, medium pizza (kind of small) and slice cheesecake my bill was almost $40. actually with tip it came to over $45.  I will go to my local pizza parlor next time I get a craving for pizza."
Andrea R.,"South San Francisco, CA",28,25,10,2.0,10/10/2015,"This place is mostly a miss. Every single time I've gone here expect once, they have got my order wrong, forgot something, or my order was missing some of its ingredients. My favorite items are the hibatchi steak dish, shiela's too much chicken salad, the Salmon dish, and the samosas. These are all great dishes when they are prepared and cooked properly. Unfortunately, not from this location... I prefer the Pleasanton Mall location. Customer service is horrible here. I also remember ordering twice to go food and my cheesecakes tasted old, they had a stale taste to them . Not impressed at all!!!"
Christopher S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,,4.0,1/26/2016,This location is isn't as busy as their Union Square location in the city and although there may be a long wait around holidays or the weekends it still isn't as bad as some other places. I like that they always have something new on the menu to try and most times it's really good.
Ruce U.,"Daly City, CA",258,19,48,5.0,4/14/2014,"Prior to being here a couple times before, my last visit to Cheesecake in San Mateo pretty much hit the bar! That night, we were pushing our time pretty tight to closing time (11PM) but managed to get there 30 minutes prior. Soon after parking, and making our way in, we have realized how chill, quiet, and space of parking their was. We got the closest parking spot and hardly anybody was there, so I must say it jumped our night just a bit in a positive manner, so thats a plus! After being seated by our lovely waitress, LAURA P, she greeted us with such gratitude and a lovely smile, and gave us time to make our orders. Small conversations and such, with our environment being slightly quiet at this time of night, it was quite beautiful and chill. Our waitress gave us apple time to make decisions and also helped us choose what kind of craving we were looking for, which definitely helped us narrow our results down to something worth trying, and was quite impressed. The appetizers of Bread and Butter was delicious, and fresh to the touch. My date then informed the waitress of how great bread was, which the waitress took into consideration of bagging up some wheat bread for us. I was quite surprised by this random act of kindness, and we both had really big smiles on our faces.  After receiving our orders of the Hibachi Steak and the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, we just stared at our food... then of course, INSTAGRAMed it lol. Then continued to enjoy the rest of our meal. Speak on behalf of the steak (Since that is what I have ordered) was tender and made with love lol Shortly after mentioning that the dinner night was intended for missing her birthday three weeks prior, it was my late gift for her. Our waitress Laura P, was very generous and had such a sweet heart, and seemed spontaneous. A few minutes after mentioning that, she brought us a bag of wheat bread, an Icecream with a candle, and sung happy birthday... even though it wasn't her birthday lol.  Overall, the food, service, and quality was great. It was one of those nights that things that people naturally do to brighten up your day, and Laura P. was one that brightened up our night!"
Kelley L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,430,463,4.0,8/6/2012,"Ambiance: 4 stars Food: 4 stars Service: 4.5 stars I have been here a few times before during college, and now that I live two blocks away, I am here more often. So, I am not basing this review on just one review, I am basing this on at least three reviews. Unlike some people, I do not dine-in for just cheesecake, let alone the National Cheesecake Day. I find myself here for lunch or sometimes a really late dinner (since it is open late in the Hillsdale area). The servers I have had are really nice. They make sure that my guest and I are not waiting for drinks or waiting around to place our orders in. They also make sure to let us know the progress of our orders, which is a PLUS. I usually order the hibachi steak, rare. I love that they do this better than other Cheesecake Factories I have been to! True to The Cheesecake Factory standards, the portions are very big, especially with the potato! The cheesecakes are the same all around, so I will not have a special comment about that, other than they are good. I also love that I can order their wheat bread and take them to go if I do not get extras during my meal. The wheat bread is sooo good, I thought it was rye! Anyway, I would come back here again. The wait is not too bad. The service is great. And the food is great."
Matea F.,"Englewood, CO",20,223,64,4.0,9/21/2012,"It's a franchise, so I can't add much to that. But, I like the convenient location(in the mall), friendly waiters and abundant parking! If you for some reason haven't been to one of the Cheesecake Factories yet -- get going :) Wide variety on the menu, so if you have a large party-they can accommodate that and everyone's taste too. Kids would enjoy it too, although don't go there denying them the dessert, which is a better part of the restaurant :)  They have a patio, overlooking the street, but you'd get the fresh air and some sun maybe.. No dogs are welcomed :("
MJ B.,"San Mateo, CA",25,100,18,4.0,5/9/2014,"OK let's all relax here this is not a Michelin star rated place let's take it for what it is a nice chain restaurant and for what it is they do a very good job. The place is clean, the servers super friendly and accommodating and good food. The atmosphere is always pretty relaxing and sometimes a little loud but you know what it is the friggin CCF.  Great kiddo menu but dang some of the portions are just HUGE. This is a place you go to if your super famished and possibly a bit h hungover...lol Overall a good family place"
Carla F.,"Millbrae, CA",492,360,940,2.0,5/15/2012,You want me to pay 50.00 for a bottle of wine that  I can get at Safeway for 18.00! Dang........I guess.
