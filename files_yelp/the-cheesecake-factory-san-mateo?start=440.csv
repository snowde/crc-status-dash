Ashley S.,"San Mateo, CA",136,13,2,1.0,10/30/2015,Horrible service! Took nearly an hour and a half to get our food and our waitress could never be found. Our cheesecake was iced. Never going back to that place ever again!
Gabriel B.,"San Francisco, CA",91,411,12,3.0,4/1/2014,"I got a call from a friend asking me to meet her here. She had been shopping at the mall and decided she was hungry and I had to see what she bought for me so if I didn't like it she could easily take it back. I navigated 101 North traffic and eventually got here. I ordered a glass of Pinot and the Chicken Marsala. The service was very good, prompt, and helpful with the suggestions. The food came out rather quickly and dug into the Chicken Marsala dish, which was served on a big plate with a bow tie pasta and sliced mushrooms.  It was O.K. nothing earth shattering. I did my best work to eat it while paying attention to my friend talking and showing me each item. This place is nice, the menu has a wide variety of items and I even tasted some Cheesecake for dessert. She asked for the check and they quickly came and rung us up. We were out in a jiff. I knew coming in this place was decent. It's a solid 3 stars for consistency and quality."
Richard D.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/11/2016,"I've had food poisoning three times in the last 6 months from getting three different dishes. Never get anything containing raw egg, meat and pasta with chicken or steak that is undercooked."
Nolan G.,"San Mateo, CA",1,11,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Terrible service... took 1.5 hrs to eat Sunday brunch.  Food came out really bad.  The toast was like eating a cruton.  The coffee had about a tablespoon of coffee grounds in each cup.  Really great way to start the day.  1.5 hrs of bad food and lousy service.  The waiter blamed the manager without us even complaining, so apparently the problem is known... ugh.  Not going here again since it managed to surpass our already poor expectations."
Michelle T.,"South San Francisco, CA",852,312,3891,4.0,3/8/2012,"I fell in love with Cheesecake factory again. While I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, I have to say that Cheesecake and Yardhouse are my top two fav's. I absolutely looove there new Skinnylicious menu!! They have an extensive selection of plates to choose from, pasta, salad, tacos, salmon, etc. all under 520 calories!! I ordered the skinny herb crusted salmon. Finally a good meal I didn't have to feel guilty about.  The portions are huge. I had to take half of it home with me.   They also have a skinnylicious drink menu under 120 calories, I was torn between the skinny margarita or cosmopolitan but decided not too since I was driving. Boo!  Overall, still not a huge fan of this location, its just okay. The location appears to be huge but as you go in, its pretty small and dark compared to other Cheesecake's I have been too. I love the fact its right next to H&M and Forever 21 though :)"
ML A.,"South San Francisco, CA",11,83,,1.0,3/27/2015,"I normally like this place cuz the wait is not too long. If I can rate ZERO I would tonigh.The service was so BAD.  Here are the 10 things I can say about our server name Danielle and others server. 1. Seriously you sat by a customer to take our order. 2. The first thing she brought to our table after we ordered was the salad dressing for my salad. 3. We asked what happened to our drinks after 10 mins. 4. We asked for some bread and that took another 10 mins. 5. Another server came by to give us some bread, looks like it came from another table. Normally 2 different kinds, this time only kind 2 brown bread n has crumbs around the basket placing. 6. Our order came, the runner insisted that we ordered nachos, told her at least 5 times..NO WE DIDN'T! ! 7. FINALLY our food arrive after 30 mins of waiting and our extra request weren't followed. Example asked for less cheese, received extra cheese. Brought back a wait another 10 mins. 8. We asked what happened to Danielle, how come there are 4 different server are serving. The gentlemen answer OH I'm sorry I forgot to introduced myself. I told Danielle to take a break.  9. We asked for a box n our check, another 10 mins. 10. Danielle came back I asked her for a salad container..SERIOULY had to ask at least 3 times to get a salad dressing container and at this time I dont have anymore patience.   Sadly to say, the manager came out to bring the correct order and we asked why is everything taking so long. Is it busy or short staff. He post and looked lost and finally said, were busy. The place was half empty. This is one of our favorite place to go. It has been good 3 months last time we were here, and thought today dinner at cheesecake factor haha surprised.  MOST DISAPPOINTED EVER!!! :(  TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE.."
Carissa L.,"San Bruno, CA",1,5,2,5.0,9/14/2015,"Love this place!! If you're gonna come in, ask for Rami! He's a great server. 5 stars for this location and the service."
Forest S.,"San Jose, CA",6,175,2,4.0,7/31/2014,"Want to be a fatty?  This is the spot. The food is good, but I would agree that the pasta dishes are overpriced. You do get a lot, though. Enough to clog your veins."
Cat C.,"San Francisco, CA",1733,1578,2823,3.0,1/2/2012,"Came here with one of my friends a while back after being on a Cheesecake Factory hiatus for awhile.  It was busy in the restaraunt but we managed to get seated at the bar right away.  The one problem with all CFs is that their menu is so extensive...it took us like 20 minutes to decide what we wanted to eat.  We usually don't eat too much and wanted to try some cheesecake so we each got an appetizer and shared the red velvet cheesecake.  I got the wild mushroom flatbread ($5.95) and she got the crispy crab bites ($6.95).  The flatbread was under 490 calories & was a fairly good size and tasty for under $6.  She liked her crab bites too.  The red velvet cheesecake was huge and was under $8 for the slice that we couldn't even finish.  It was also one of the first cheesecakes I tried that surprisingly didn't make me feel like I was going to have a heart attack.  Service at the bar was okay though it was hard to get the bartender(s)/waiters' attention. Overall, CF is an okay choice when you don't know exactly what you want to eat as there are many options, though everything is so caloric and in huge portions, I'm glad they have a ""Skinny"" part of the menu.   Note to all my fellow iPhone users....signal is horrible in here!!"
edz A.,"Burlingame, CA",197,34,661,5.0,1/24/2012,"I love the convenient parking at this mall, in general. Love the location too of this cheesecake factory, u can simply drop by right after splurging at the nearby shops . IF you are smart enough to go there earlier than the usual prime times, u could avoid waiting. You could turn out any ordinary day into something sweeter by getting urself their red velvet  cheesecake for example.. They also have low carb options, yayy! .. and whoever thought about the skinnylicious menus, must be a genius with a great appetite and a rockin' body =)"
Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,4.0,3/25/2012,"I can't seem to stay away from this place. I seem to be drawn like a moth to a flame to the large, garishly decorated halls of this chain. Many times I've been here and I almost always seem to be happy with the results. Today, it was all about the beef and cheesecake. Their American-Style Kobe-beef burger was perfectly seared medium (as requested), topped with grilled onions and fresh sauteed mushrooms (which I swear tasted like sliced fresh shitake mushrooms). Excellent. Their thin sliced sweet potato fries were good but could have used a dipping sauce, as a chipotle mayo sauce was served with a full portion, but not with a side order to the burger (unless requested). Service too was good and the waitress even described their special cheesecake (a devilishly inspired Mango Key-Lime over a crust that had shredded coconut in it) that forced us to abandon all hope of splitting a single plain cheesecake slice and getting this special slice in addition. We weren't sorry, although if you are in it for the purity of simple cheesecake, you might have found that there was too much going on. I on the other hand loved the change and was glad we spent the extra $7 for the slice. Damn you and your flame, Cheesecake Factory. I will be back."
Shella A.,"Redwood City, CA",0,4,3,1.0,9/11/2015,"I already sent the email to the website got cheated on the slice of Linda's fudge cake normally it is a tall cake 8-9 inches tall only got half the size when I got home. When I ordered the cake I heard Anthony T said mine too so in short he got half of my cake, not to notice he Lady covered the end of the cake 3 dollops of whip cream, i don't mind the price but its the principle of getting cheated on food I ordered. I'll"
Boops D.,"San Diego, CA",9,83,8,2.0,1/29/2014,"Not sure what happened to this place! Ive been here a couple times in the last couple months and I feel like its gone downhill. Previous to last time I had the lettuce wraps, they were OK. The last time I was there, I had the turkey burger with a side salad. OMG, this salad looks RIDICULOUS. The burger was bland and the kitchen staff messed up my bun and put the wrong cheese on it. We probably wont be coming back for a while. Table next to us sent their food back also.  The manager came out (we didnt even ask for one) I guess the server saw that we were unhappy and she took off the burger from the bill. I got to Sneakers in San Carlos for a delicious chicken sandwich / turkey burger and that salad on the side comes with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and crouton!  Cheesecake factory, you guys are a huge corporation. You can make your food taste a lot better and please dont throw a few pieces of lettuce on a place and call it a salad. Seriously. Im paying for my meal, remember?"
Cindy N.,"Redwood City, CA",0,9,1,1.0,12/14/2014,"Let me tell you about my last two experiences at this place.  One night, my boyfriend and I went to dinner which ended up costing us around 70 bucks. We got the check & left the waiter a tip, but we neglected to scratch a line thru the tip section on the receipt, so this asshole decides to take advantage of this and charges himself a 20 DOLLAR TIP after we already left him one IN CASH!! We didn't even notice until my boyfriend saw his bank statement & wondered when the hell we spend 90 dollars at the Cheesecake Factory.. Now the second time we went, it was for a friend's birthday. We started off with a waiter but half way thru our stay there he turned it over to another waiter & guess who it was? The asshole waiter from last time. Well it looked like he remembered who we were because he avoided eye contact & rarely came to check on us. This time around I ordered nothing but a soda and a cheesecake. Only two people in our group are actual food. We asked if the check could be divided according to what each of us had ordered & he told us we could only divide the check in half or pay the full amount. BULLSHIT. I've been to this restaurant plenty of times & they have divided the check upon our party's request. Well I didn't argue any further & paid for the whole party's meal with my card. Of course I didn't forget last time's incident so I scratched the shit out of the Tip section on the receipt & on top of that we left no tip. Yes. You can call it a dick move but considering what he did last time plus he didn't check up on us for refills or anything else we may have needed that night. Well the gathering concluded & we were halfway to our car when the waiter calls after us ""Did you mean to purposely not leave a tip for me?"" WTF. Really?? He really had the audacity to chase us outside the fucking restaurant just to complain about his tip. As far as I'm concerned, tips are not required unless stated somewhere by the establishment, on top of that, you get an hourly wage, if that isn't enough find yourself a better job. Completely unprofessional. Never going back there again."
Perry M.,"Sparks, NV",0,1,,2.0,6/11/2016,On a recent visit we thought The Cheese Cake factory would be a safe bet for a decent meal but not to be true at this one. The wait staff in the bar was more interested in play grab ass with each other than waiting on us. I has to ask to order first then when I finally did we waited till they brought the food cold. I had to ask another waiter 3 different times to refill my water glass and when I asked for my waiter no one new where he was so I went to the restroom and there he was hitting up one of the waitress. I asked for a manger but no one ever came. The bar wait staff sucks here. Food mediocre.
Mina K.,"Belmont, CA",223,28,94,1.0,12/17/2013,Went today. Was seated within 5 minutes. Sat at my table for about 20 mins no one came by to even bring me water. Ridiculous. It wasn't even busy. I got up and left. On my way out I told the hostess and she didn't even apologize
Polly L.,"San Francisco, CA",276,114,140,4.0,5/31/2014,"The service was amazing, our server was on top of everything. Even when the restaurant itself was quite crowded, it didn't jeopardize the service. She gave us water & bread whenever we ran out, and being at multiple cheesecake factories, this was actually the first time a server has been so nice and on top. Our food was delicious. We got 3 things to share, with leftovers. BBQ chicken salad, Louisiana chicken pasta & roasted garlic pasta. One thing about the roasted garlic pasta was that I was expecting it to be roasted garlic, but when I ate it, it was just kinda pan fried and not really roasted. Overall, everything was great. We were waiting to order cheesecake but the main dishes got us too full so decided to skip that."
Dorothy V.,"Fullerton, CA",131,10,13,3.0,7/19/2015,Service sucked. For groups this is not the place. Wait is long and food doesn't come out on time.  Manager and food is good.
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,3.0,1/14/2015,"Typical cheesecake factory. We came for Sunday brunch so there was a little bit of a wait at noon. They also have a special Sunday brunch menu. Since it's a treat for me to be here on a Sunday, I ordered off that menu. I got the bruleed French toast. It was two big pieces of thick bread with a thin egg layer. I don't know what exactly made it brulee-d. Also both my pieces were pretty burned on the edges. I had to cut around a lot of it. Also I think it was $12 for the two pieces of French toast and no sides. Not really worth it. I'd go for other options. My friends had the burgers, lunch portions of the entrée and full size entrees. We also got a side of fries for the table and it was like a huge overflowing plate of fires - a lot. The full size entress are almost $20 but it's pretty big portions. Oh and the table split two pieces of cheesecake - lemon meringue and the godiva chocolate. Good thing, we were all pretty full and the cheesecake was pretty rich. Service was fine. It took awhile to get the complementary bread and drinks and the check. But they checked in on us and brought us whatever we needed. Connected to the mall so there's lots of parking and you can do some walking around after a huge meal."
Scott W.,"Foster City, CA",235,3,1,2.0,12/1/2013,"Not long ago I joined a small party of people who picked this restaurant and I was disappointed with the experience. While this restaurant has a very large number of selections on its menu, I could only choose between one or two at the most. I am on a gluten-free diet and I'll admit that not every restaurant caters to people like me. Before arriving, I was prepared to choose from a smaller number of selections than those who do not share my dietary restrictions.  When I discovered just how large the menu was with very little attempt to provide for those with restricted diets I was surprised. So many dishes I could not eat. For several of the dishes I was considering I had to ask the server to check with the chef as to whether or not there was gluten involved in the preparation. After a long wait, my choices got narrowed down to just one.  In addition, the place was a zoo with a long waiting time to be seated and long waits between service by very young and seemingly inexperienced servers. The reason I gave two stars is that once I got the food, it tasted quite good. Everything else about the experience was terribly disappointing though. I will never choose to eat here again while perfectly good options exist very nearby."
