Jay M.,"Boulder Creek, CA",2,1,,1.0,7/10/2015,"The food if fine,, but trying to order takeout was an absolute nightmare. What a stupid and badly designed process.. My daughter wanted food before work and we had no time to gen it."
Maria N.,"San Jose, CA",235,63,40,3.0,5/16/2014,Slowest service ever on a friday for lunch. Plus we had our newborn in a stroller and they sat us in a booth and our stroller was hanging in the aisle. They coulda sat us at a small table and taken away a chair. I forgave them because the food was good.
Vani J.,"San Carlos, CA",11,73,,5.0,5/30/2015,"Cheesecake is a must have!- any type or flavor suits. Avocado eggrolls are the best appetizers. Pasta was a li'l too oily but palatable. Pizza was decent. The unlimited freshly baked bread steals the show sometimes, especially the brown ones. The only thing which is negative about the place is its wait time- you can opt to take the cheesecake and food out but then you miss the awesome (free) bread.... Choice is yours."
Marjorie G.,"Daly City, CA",86,22,1,3.0,9/9/2015,"Cheesecakes are amazing!  But they constantly change the menu...which is both good and bad.  Good because you get new choices, bad because the dish you specifically come for is gone.  I wish that they had more sugar free dessert options."
Lawrence L.,"Millbrae, CA",362,489,2653,3.0,10/9/2011,"Been to plenty of other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this is by far the closest and newest location to my hood.  Came for lunch with a group if 8 and the wait turned out to be 1 hour!   Guess the wait was due to the new restaurant buzz, in addition to out large party.  Thankful that it's located in the Hillsdale Mall, as we were able to kill time at the Apple store nearby. We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (consistently tasty), and Nachos (ok).  Wifey had the Chinese Chicken Salad (nice crispy noodles added good texture), and I had the Green Chili Burger (green chili and jalapenos with crispy tortilla strips definitely added).  Overall the food was good quality, and plates arrived pretty timely.  But was it worth an hour wait???  Not sure...  It was just OK for me.  I have to say that they stay pretty consistent with the quality from location to location.  I also feel that I prefer their dinner entree's over the lunch dishes. The layout of this place was pretty nicely spread out with outside seating as well.  Service was friendly and attentive as well.   We grabbed two cheesecakes to go: pumpkin (tasted like pumpkin pie- ok), and coconut cream (chocolate macaroon crust was yum).  Definitely, the highlight from this place. With that said, it is still probably the best choice if you are trying to grab a bite to eat in this mall."
Leah G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,2,2.0,3/6/2014,"Wow, Im amazed at how this place has gone so far downhill, I don't think I'll ever come back again. I used to love this place a few years ago- even came here to celebrate my birthday with family once and extremely enjoyed it. But yesterday, I was accompanied with one of my friends and from the moment we sat down, the disaster started.  My friend and I were handed menus and the waitress asked if we wanted drinks. We just wanted water to start and hadn't even glanced at the menu yet, but she came back twice more asking if we wanted drinks. Well, after the horrifying experience, I felt I needed one! My mug of water had a lipstick stain on it! And it was not mine! I thought maybe it was an old stain that wouldn't come off during the washing process- um, no! It wiped off like that stain was just put there seconds ago! I told the waitress and she just said, ""Ew! And ran away with it."" Um, ok. I guess no apology is needed.  It took about 20-25 minutes to get some bread, and that's after we waited and asked for some. Nice cold, hard bread. Did this chic just not like me?  The chicken in my pasta was a little burned. Didn't eat it. The pasta was bland. My friends lettuce wraps were all blackened on the ends. My friend just looked stunned when she sees that and the waitress goes, oh they're big so u can put a lot of stuff inside. Yeah, we looked like that bc the lettuce was black, not bc they were huge lettuce leafs. Dang.  Whatever. We were trying to be polite about everything, but when it felt like asking for a straw was above and beyond and splitting checks was a burden, I decided not to come back to this appalling restaurant again.  Two stars because I like the modern sink in the bathroom. Parking is great. Other than that, this place really disappointed. Guess it's time to check out the restaurant at the other side of the mall.."
Les K.,"Cazadero, CA",12,109,8,1.0,1/18/2016,"Most of my past experiences have been mediocre at best but my son really wanted to go the Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at 5:56PM. Quoted 30-40 minutes to get seated for the four of us. OK... We could waste some time tripping around the mall. Came back in 25 just to make sure we had not gotten called already and even had one of their visual pagers to alert when the table was ready. They confirmed still another 10 minutes... The rest of the time we were waiting in the lobby. After 20 minutes checked again and they claimed 2nd on the list. After watching party after party getting seated I again check-in and they claimed they had called me. Total BS and the pager never went off. I then escalated to the ""manager"" who basically showed little interest in their poor service but claimed we were ""next"". That translated to another 8 minutes. So basically an hour and 15 minutes later we were seated from the quoted 30-40 minutes. Where upon we were put in a section with 5 empty tables and promptly got ignored for another 10 minutes. Throughout the rest of dinner pretty much had inattentive service. The food was OK as typical. The fact that the ""manager"" did nothing to make reasonable amends and seemed to just put us int he ""B team"" service area, invariably as punishment for having the audacity to ""complain"".  We finally got done at 8:28PM! I still don't see why so many people put up with the long waits for such mediocrity..."
Danielle S.,"San Francisco, CA",657,4,7,3.0,1/4/2015,This place DOES NOT accept reservations on the weekends even though the YELP reservation link allowed me to make one. We lucked out and my brothers birthday dinner was able to still happen so we shall see if everything else goes nicely.  At least they have Tito's Vodka.
Carlos S.,"Pinole, CA",51,27,24,1.0,5/30/2015,"Came here to have lunch during our daughter's 6th birthday adventure day. We were seated promptly and the waitress came to our table quickly but she seemed to be rushing us. My wife and daughter went to the restroom first but she already asked what they would like to drink (hmm don't know I'm not a mind reader). We've eaten at other CF's before so we know we're supposed to be getting fresh bread served to us appetizers, did we get any...nope not till I asked, and the waitress response ""Oh did you want bread?"" uh yes thats why I'm asking!!! Of course they only had 1 type of bread to serve but it was our favorite any way. As for the rest of our meal, my wife ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich w/buffalo sauce, what she got was a spicy crispy chicken sandwich, dry. There response, the buffalo sauce is mixed into the batter, well that pretty much gives it NO flavor when we're expecting buffalo sauce coating the chicken. I ordered the cajun chicken littles. As I chewed into one I noticed it's not a chicken texture. I looked into it and it looked like a hard noodle but it turned out to be squid/calamari. I pointed it out to our waitress, her response ""Oh sorrry, I hope you're not allergic to squid!"" Wow well if I was CF would be looking at a lawsuit. I even tried to get a floor managers attention ( 2 guys in button up shirts and a name tag) but of course they could care less and just went about their business making sure more tables were cleaned fast to (reload customers) and cleaning up the mess in the back (twice dishes/glassware were dropped loudly during our visit). All in All a place to get bad service and food!"
G. Y.,"Millbrae, CA",9,41,10,5.0,5/30/2015,"Had a day to spend with just myself and my daughter and without planning stumbled into this Cheesecake Factory. Hands down one of the best experiences with service!!! Justin is a complete doll, very thorough and thoughtful, never had to wait or ask for anything, completely on top of his game!! Big shout outs to Rami and Nisreen also, it's so nice to walk into an establishment and have smiling friendly faces!! P.S. The food was on point, that spicy pizza and 4 cheese pasta was killer, next time I hope I'm not too full to actually try their notorious cheesecakes!!"
Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1450,1057,137,3.0,12/5/2011,"When I saw Hillsdale tearing down the old Mervyn's, I thought, ""Finally! I didn't know anyone still shopped there..."" Little did I know that THIS was going in there! H&M and something else alongside, I was floored when I drove to CalTrain to pick up the Husband. When did Hillsdale get so fashionable, and WHY am I not shopping there right now? The Husband and I came here for one thing: dessert. Sure, it was a Friday night around 6:30-7, but it was packed. Apparently if you didn't have a reservation, you weren't getting in. The bar area was also completely packed. We just wanted cheesecake, what's the deal!? Thankfully, they have a take-out counter where you can order slices (or whole) of cheesecake to-go. We got a fudge layer cake and Adam's Peanut Butter something. Total: $16, including tax. WHAT?! For two pieces of cheesecake it's $8/piece?! I can MAKE my own cheesecake, and I have, for less money than that. You get it at wholesale prices, too, how can you justify such costs? It didn't even blow my mind, either. I mean, it's good - because it's cheesecake - but it's not like other desserts I've had that were utterly divine. I'm used to the San Francisco location (above Macy's?) being totally and completely packed constantly, at all hours of the day. There is no such thing as a ""15 minute wait"" in SF, but considering they've opened more locations along the peninsula, you would think the wait time would decrease. Not so much. I hope their food isn't meh, because I can see myself being dragged here with the Husband because I declined one night to not indulge in cookery by baking one myself. If the service is more meh, I'll just be wildly disappointed. Of course, I can always be bribed with clothes shopping to burn off the whooping 1200 calories a slice I just shoved in my mouth. Woo! Incentive!"
Lupe M.,"Oakland, CA",35,262,1,4.0,1/7/2014,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory situated inside the Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo!   I come to this particular Cheesecake Factory because the atmosphere is so festive and service quite good as well as friendly.  I also enjoy the food here, from the salads to the sandwiches to the many kinds of cheesecakes!  I usually come here for brunch or lunch so that I may burn off the just consumed calories while shopping at all my favorite stores in this mall."
James T.,"San Mateo, CA",345,53,19,1.0,2/11/2015,"4 stars for the food, 0 for the customer service. These guys are a joke, I have consistently waited 10 minutes or more to be greeted,  then another 10 before we got drinks/water, which would annoying but if they were busy but when they're half empty and I am watching our server joke around with his coworkers for 5 minutes straight it gets to be unbearable. I will happily take my business to BJs or anywhere else in the area before coming back."
Carol Y.,"San Francisco, CA",446,942,526,4.0,10/20/2011,"I thought the service was pretty good but then again it was 10pm. :P Overall, the restaurant is semi big but it is pretty! You dont feel like you are in a mall."
Taylor N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/23/2015,"First off i waited over 20 min for food, I got my food and then the green beans were cold the mash potatoes tasted as if they were re-heated, and the catfish just didnt' seem right. Maybe two hours after eating there I was sick as a dog. This isn't my first time here with a bad experience. I have now learned my lesson and will never return again."
Rose F.,"South San Francisco, CA",42,422,504,5.0,9/19/2011,"We planned to be here for Grand Opening Day, my dear friend Kim Chow and I.  Thank god, we did it early when they first opened because it was really busy by noon time. We ordered 2 tropical ice teas, Nachos, The Everything Pizza, Skinny Cobb Salad and for dessert we had Tuxedo and Adam's Fudge Ripple Cheesecakes. Great service.  Management came a few times to chat with us.   Beautiful deco, offered outdoor seating and indoor mall seating.   My first time ever at The Cheesecake Factory and definitely not my last.  I'm coming back tomorrow with my BF."
Kobi A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,24,1,2.0,5/31/2015,"Service was a nightmare, asking for a chicken sandwich with no cheese resulted in another 30 (!) Minutes wait... I don't want compensation! I want to eat lunch and wait reasonable time total of two hours lunch, no thank you.."
Samantha P.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/5/2016,"This place is horrible. Every single time I come here I expect it to be better and I keep giving them chances but I am fed up. Every single time I come here the service is nonexistent and they never give us any attention. Whether it be a few of us with less than 5 people or a group of 20 people, it doesn't matter, they don't care. Their general manager should be fired for not overseeing the details of customer service. I've ordered to go pick up twice from them. The first experience I encountered they told me it would take 30 minutes. I showed up around the 45 minute mark so they could have some extra time to prepare the stuff in case they were backed up. Those 15 minutes did not matter whatsoever. I had to wait an extra 45 minutes - 1 hour for my to go order of TWO SALADS AND THE CORN TAMALES. Please tell me why. And the last straw was tonight. My family order 2 hours ahead since last time it was such a disaster. I get there and the person taking my payment didn't smile at me once. She just mugged me and never said thank you or even please. NOTHING. IF YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THEN DON'T WORK IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. Then after 2 minutes this guy comes and asks who's order was it and she points to me. He tells me, ""uhh..we are gonna have to remake your order.""  I asked him why and I told him he doesn't need to, it's ok if it's cold I can warm it up at home and that I don't mind. He repeats himself and says, ""no we need to remake it because you took too long."" OK thanks for customer blaming. No one apologized and no one said anything. No one even told me how long it was going to take. By the time I got my food the original girl that I paid asked me, ""Did you pay?"" HOW CAN YOU FORGET IF I PAID IF IT WAS LITERALLY IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES?!  I'm going to call your general manager and also probably corporate because this cheesecake factory has gone downhill and does not meet the standards at all. ***AVOID AT ALL COSTS****"
Maureen S.,"Hollister, CA",3,75,89,5.0,1/31/2014,This place bent over backward to make our dinner experience 0156gm@  Elmira & Mariel  Manager David just couldn't have been nicer or have made our evening any better! Can't wait to get back there.
Emily G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,128,1,5.0,5/27/2015,I love the cheesecake factory. It's one of my favorite chains. My favorite thing to get here are the factory nachos. I also had great service this past weekend.
