Lori A.,"San Mateo, CA",4,43,29,4.0,5/23/2015,I've always had great service and food at this location (although I do not recommend the cheesesteak sandwich) but maybe that's just my opinion. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because there is always a long wait.
Clark K.,"Stafford County, VA",0,78,,3.0,7/25/2015,I agree with most of the other reviews.  Typical slightly higher priced chain restaurant. Huge selection of entrees. Generally consistent food quality.  The service is usually pretty slow and there is always a wait.  20 minutes is acceptable. Much more than that... Choose another place!  Alexa was very attentive. Very cheery and always smiling.  Good job!
Jenni D.,"San Mateo, CA",3,72,45,1.0,8/15/2013,"Came here to grab a slice of cheesecake before my 30 minute lunch ended...did it seriously take them 15 MINUTES to just grab a slice and put it in a box?! Yes, I know people in the restaurant want desert too...In addition, there were four I REPEAT FOUR workers just off to the side chatting. Yes, I know people have certain zones but really?! By the time I got my cheesecake, the guy asked if I ordered two cheesecakes. I only ordered one, but thanks for charging me for two! And not giving me my money back!"
Steven P.,"Foster City, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/29/2015,Hair in the Mac and cheese Small black kinky hair in the Mac and cheese. They put it on the bill???
Mel P.,"San Mateo, CA",2,33,31,3.0,5/17/2015,"Never do curb side assistance. I understand they are always busy but if they can't accommodate proper curb side assistance than way provide the service. Sit in dinning is fine as always but I recommend you walk in yourself for your to-go order rather than use the curb side, it saves you time."
Boo Z.,"San Francisco, CA",37,47,289,3.0,4/9/2015,"Party of 25+ planned last min. They said they can split check 3 ways. Offered bread once they were soft and good and another round of bread 40 mins later was hard ass shit. My hibachi steak was pretty good and tasteful. I had a frozen mango and I had them remade it bcus it was mostly ice. I feel as if the downtown location is way better. I honestly feel bad for the server but they should've atleast had a helper with him. I tip by service and how satisfied I am. If it's a good experience then it's good tip, good money. Never will I go in a big party. My money was well spent 7/10. Service could've been better but i understand that it was a big party. Don't ever get pasta bcus it taste straight up just noodles, too plain and overpriced."
April B.,"Richmond, TX",0,35,57,4.0,6/15/2015,Great food and friendly staff! Can't really go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory. Lots of good food to choose from! Only reason for the for four stars instead of five is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner.
Reyn J.,"Redwood City, CA",76,561,787,1.0,4/30/2012,"Sunday lunch. My expectations were low from my last visit to the Palo Alto store. This time, I ordered the fried chicken sliders, the garlic spaghetti, and the ""open"" Cabernet (house). All, surprisingly, were great. I chased it all with a triple espresso (to stay awake after lunch) and an original cheesecake. Really colorful place and they seem to be training new employees (another Cheesecake Factory somewhere?)."
John S.,"San Francisco, CA",3,41,23,5.0,4/19/2015,"A very good place to go for a chain restaurant.  The menu has something for everybody.  I had the Bacon Cheeseburger, my daughters had the pizza and pasta, and my wife had the eggs Benedict.  All in all- a good place to go after church for the family."
christina o.,"Oakland, CA",1,15,5,1.0,6/10/2015,"This is by far the worse service I have ever seen. It started with Angelo (our waiter) not once stopping at our table to even ask for a refill, to check on us or find out if we needed anything. We waited over an hour for our  appetizers,  and the insulting part was he waited on three other tables around us several times. The one star went to the Manager that did come to our table twice to apologize for the missing crab cakes, and to bring me a water personally. I am very disappointed my past experiences have always been good here."
Paisely S.,"San Mateo, CA",28,27,,4.0,9/24/2015,"good grub, wide variety, good for people who like different stuff."
SO S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,73,15,1.0,8/31/2013,"The single star stays until they clean the greasy, slippery floor! Gross--I felt like I was ice skating on the way to our table Has anyone else noticed???"
M L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,22,,2.0,8/14/2015,"As others have said, you know what the food is before you go. What's really sad is given the prices they charge that service isn't better. I agree with reviewed Phoebe T. It makes no sense for the prices they charge that they don't have nicer, friendlier people. Why they have a to counter when there isnt a person there when they open?? They like to say a few minutes, a few minutes which turns into 5,10, 15. If you have to go back to work, you do not have your entire lunch break to wait. If you have employees who  cannot be on time, hire new employees! The more interesting thing is that service is pretty lousy no matter which one you go to- San Jose, L.A. etc. I will only return if someone else pays but I won't spend my money there, especially when you could get good 2 Thai or Mexican meals for what you pay for one."
Silvie P.,"Folsom, CA",63,128,255,3.0,10/22/2013,"I am a creature that loves consistency. So I come here and for the most part order the same thing every time. And it is consistently good. I am a big fan of their breaded chicken. I really like the Crusted Chicken Romano, however the light tomato sauce on the pasta is too light so I always ask for more. I also like the Chicken Bellagio. During the few instances I had felt adventurous and tried some other things on the menu I have been a bit disappointed.  I definitely cannot come here without ordering some cheesecake. The Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake is one of my favorites. So creamy and the banana flavor does not taste fake at all. I also like the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. The sweetness of the raspberry and the tartness of the lemon are a great combination. During the holidays the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake is the way to go (it's a pecan pie on the bottom and pumpkin cheesecake on top, genius idea). Service here is always good, although when busy it may be a bit slow. However every server I have had has been very friendly and professional. They must have a good hiring/training program."
Rebecca M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,52,16,3.0,3/24/2015,The hostess sucked. I got there about 5 PM on Friday asked how long the wait was she said about five minutes I said okay put my name down I'm going to run into footlocker pick up my shoes that are on hold and come right back. she said she didn't want to put my name down because if they called my name and I wasn't there they would put it on hold I said I would be right back and didn't want to put my name down when I got back in case there was a wait at that point she kind of rolled her eyes at me said okay put my name down. I was back in like three minutes and there was tons of people waiting by that time. Good thing she put my name down. I don't understand what was so difficult about that. Other than the rude hostess our meal was good and I don't have any complaints.
Soraya M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,,2.0,10/23/2016,"Wait to be seated on a Sunday at lunchtime was only 20 minutes which was the only good thing about my experience here. I've eaten here plenty of times before but today sucked. I didn't even know my waiters name until he took a break and his replacement came by to introduce himself and let us know that ""Juan"" was going on break and he would be assisting us in the meantime. If he would of remained our waiter instead I might have given one more star. Food took over 40 minutes to come out once ordered which is the longest I have ever waited. My food was cold and my daughters pizza was burnt. That is unacceptable. It's a bit disappointing when your plate itself is hotter than the food on it. Not sure if the quality of customer service and food has gone down or if this was just one bad experience. It's too bad because other than that they do have a great selection of food and when served warm as it should be the food is pretty tasty."
Candra T.,"San Francisco, CA",3,22,3,1.0,4/21/2015,"Jambalaya pasta was completely tasteless. For $18, I feel so ripped off. We also ordered gumbo, which is supposed to be sort of like soup or stew, but for some reason, it was just rice and meat. We are so disappointed.  No complaint on the service."
Maricar F.,"San Francisco, CA",3,100,246,3.0,10/28/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Always hits the spot when I'm craving for their all time favorites!! We also got discovered a new appetizer, cuban rolls-pulled pork with melted swiss cheese fried to perfection like a spring roll. Nom nom nom."
Colleen K.,"Menlo Park, CA",187,54,71,3.0,1/19/2015,"Only giving 3 stars because the food isn't good. Don't get me wrong it's a fun place to go with large groups or maybe for a date night since the venue is quiet nice and rather luxurious, but to be fair-- only the cheesecake and drinks (from the bar) are worth the trip to Cheesecake Factory."
Z G.,"Millbrae, CA",58,104,4,3.0,4/17/2015,"Great variety of food and descent price. The best free bread, I love the chocolate one. Fresh out of the oven is the best. The dessert is great too.  Salad is very good combination. Not a entree that is memorable, but all very high quality."
