Golda R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",215,525,99,4.0,3/3/2012,"People love them some Cheesecake Factory!  I met up with a few friends at this location, and as usual, it was crowded.  But service was great, our server was nice, gave us extra bread as asked for, and waited until we were ready to order.   I didn't order a meal because I had dinner with my husband prior, but only ordered  a cheesecake instead - the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake.  It was a great way to finish off a very very long work week with friends."
Chris P.,"Burlingame, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/14/2015,"Granted it's a Cheesecake factory, but service was slow, plates and napkins were dirty, and pizza was overcooked. Basically a miss on everything. Probably a better idea to head over to Paul Martin's on the other side of the mall or go across the street and grab a burger at Custom."
Atanu R.,"San Bruno, CA",64,42,2,2.0,8/13/2015,"So I'll begin with their service. I reach the restaurant at 2:30pm when the hotel is near empty. A condescending lady ""greets"" us (if u can call it greeting) and asks us to wait. Remember that the hotel is near empty now. So she asks us to wait for 10 minutes.  10 minutes passes on to 30 minutes. In the mean time I request them to provide us just with a set of seats since my parents were having problems sitting in the reception area. But it fell on deaf ears.  So at 3:00pm(or thereabout) we get our seats. Once seated it takes another 15 minutes for a server to show up. Remember that the restaurant is near empty. And everything from thereon takes excruciatingly large amount of time to happen. Now lets talk about food: First they serve us their customary free breads. In other cheesecake locations it tastes great. And they come out directly from the oven. Not here. + Sourdough is missing. Bad bad bad. We ordered  Fried nachos, pasta, cashew chicken and pizza. Each of them (except pizza) tastes BAD.  Now for the good part. The cheesecake here is good. The ones we ordered are  Mango key lime and Tiramisu. Both of them tasted good.  Advice: If you are hell bent on spending your money here, please ""take-out"" the cheesecakes and run as fast as your legs can carry you out of the restaurant."
Veronika G.,"San Diego, CA",6,205,5,2.0,8/3/2013,"Have been here a couple of times for lunch while shopping. During the week i've been seated immediately, but on the weekends the wait can be very long and I've given up. I like their Skinnylicious menu. Some tasty items under 500 calories. I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps and the flatbread with pears and bleu cheese. The reason I didn't give them more stars is that the service can be hit or miss. I have had very attentive servers and one who I know completely forgot about me! Ok I have just lowered the stars to two. I have been back again and If you are dining alone they treat you like a leper. They seated me at one of those crappy tables in the back AGAIN and the service was also bad again.  I realize the check is not going to be as high for a party of one but treating people like they don't matter is not good for business. I won't be back unless someone is with me!"
Randy W.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",23,46,635,4.0,10/18/2011,This location has now been open about a month and it seems to be running smoothly.  I had the lunch combo Hawaiian pizza & small salad which were excellent.  My wife also really enjoyed her Chicken Piccata with mashed potatoes.  The included bread was fresh & tasty.    The service was friendly & efficient.    My only complaint: the noise level was pretty high but that is to be expected at a popular & festive place such as The Cheesecake Factory!
Kayla F.,"Palm Desert, CA",21,24,2,5.0,4/9/2015,Great service fresh warm bread and the food is always great our server Margret suggested I try the pear martini it was so good!
Karen J.,"San Carlos, CA",24,31,3,1.0,2/4/2016,"Worst ""meal"" ever. Don't come here. I love Cheesekake Factories but this one is having serious problems. Very slow service, forgotten then cold orders. The manager offered to put my cold overdone steak back in the oven. . I ended going home hungry after 2 hours. Disappointing family night out. On the bright side, The cheesecake to go was good!"
Mike B.,"San Jose, CA",325,82,66,3.0,6/9/2013,"I kinda think that this review will go unnoticed cause you either come here or you don't , kinda like Denny's .... But here it goes :  Decor & ambiance - nice  Service - good  Food - good   Like always the place was packed  25 min wait , food was good , nothing that really stands out as great ( actually my sons ribeye was awesome ) the one thing that stood out was they added the tip to the bill - usually that's done on party's of 8 or more but we were only 6 , hey I'm a great tipper especially with great service however I'd like to reserve the right to tip according to what I've received."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,17,1,1.0,11/3/2013,"We went on a Saturday night and it was packed. We asked how long the wait would be and were told 30 min. We decided to wait and did some shopping and wandered through the apple store. 30 min later we checked in and were told it'd be another 15-20 minutes....we had already waited so decided to tough it out. 20 minutes later there didn't seem to be any hope in sight. We decided to leave and told the hostess who gave us some stink attitude that screamed ""whatever.""  Save yourself some time, hassle, and dignity and go to the palo alto location."
M M.,"San Bruno, CA",0,18,,1.0,1/11/2016,The service was terrible. Sat at the bar area thinking the service would be faster. The waitress took her sweet time getting to us. She was the most unfriendly person. Did not even crack one smile. Had for ask for bread and she took her her time again. The chicken and the mashed potatoes were salty. The chicken was dark and overcooked. Like it had been sitting around for a while. Definitely do not plan to go back to this place again.
Kathryn Y.,"San Bruno, CA",19,228,1179,4.0,3/2/2014,One of my favorite restaurants. Love the atmosphere. Service is good. Food is consistent and always tasty. Favorite dishes are: Club Sandwich BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad Chinese Chicken Salad Jambalaya Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake
Lauren W.,"San Francisco, CA",110,2,,1.0,4/9/2016,"I came here with my friend for her birthday and when I went up to the counter to ask how long the wait was the rude ass hostess said 30 min with an attitude and ugly face. Then I asked how far you can go with the little device they give you and she gave more attitude pointed outside the door and said that far,this time she didn't even look at me.I asked my friends if they noticed how rude she was and they   we stood outside someone left their keys and my friend went back inside to say something and the other rude hostess looked at her and turned around. After all this we were seated and our food was really good our acual waitress was so nice but at the end I asked her if I could speak to her manager and he came over and I told him what happened but he didn't seem like he cared at all...and walked away from us as fast as he could. Overall the food was good our cheesecake was super good but the hostesses at the front were awful, like sorry you just seat people at The Cheesecake Factory your not that special"
Larion S.,"New York, NY",91,91,547,3.0,9/6/2013,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory you've been to. Pretty standard and nothing that differentiates this place from the others. Don't get me wrong though. This can definitely be a good thing. Familiarity makes knowing what I want and what to expect much easier. Food is solid. I really like the lunch menu options because they're not too large (so you don't get a bloated, full feeling afterwards) and they're reasonably priced. I also really like the salads (I tolerate salads, so for me to say I really like a salad and would order it again means that it's pretty good). And... well... the cheesecake is what it is. Large, rich, and delicious. But my favorite part of every Cheesecake Factory I've been to is the complimentary bread and butter. I can practically have that as my meal and I'd be content. When the waiter/waitress comes and asks that one question... I don't even have to think about it anymore. My response is automatic. ""Would you like some more bread?"" ""YES, please!"" In short: Food: B+ Service: B to B+ Price: B Positive(s): + The complimentary bread (they may as well just give me 5 baskets right away) + Food is standard and no different from other locations. Still pretty solid. + The location. The nearest Cheesecake Factories are either in Palo Alto or San Francisco, so having one in San Mateo is convenient. + If you're into shopping, the mall is right there. + Lunch menu (I think this deal is the best priced option on the menu) Negative(s): - Some of that stuff is expensive. - Service can be slow and inattentive. - Wait times for seating and service can get especially bad during peak hours."
Kao S.,"San Mateo, CA",485,259,1305,3.0,1/12/2014,New store opened near my house so thought I try it out. Nicely designed but located in a mall. It gets busy and waits are long. Aside from that the bar is great. Will come back and try out the food.
Andrew C.,"El Paso, TX",0,4,1,1.0,4/8/2016,I am visiting from out of town and went to this place a few years ago and Loved it! However i just got into town last night amd went to get a burger to go around 10:30 or so....right before they closed at 11. The staff was patient with us but our food was terrible. I got a burger on sourdough bread that was partially charred even though I ordered it medium and the bread was pretty stale. The fries were pretty good though. I know we were probably their last order and got the last pieces of food for the night but still.....
Ashley P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Worst service we've had in a long time, our waitress would ask us if we needed anything and when we were about to say something she just walked away. It became comical. The food was sloppy, and the bread which is one of our favorite parts was cold and stale. Disappointed, won't go back to that particular Location."
Josh K.,"Sioux Falls, SD",2,43,2,5.0,1/18/2015,"Went again in November 2014 for lunch on a Saturday. At 11:30 they aren't crowded yet, so it's a good time. This time, the service was good and the food was great.  I felt I had to change my review because this time, I was impressed with what I ate, and it was a bit healthier as well.  I had the huevos rancheros, and we all had the lettuce wraps, which came with chicken, a number of shredded vegetables, and 3 kinds of sauce.  It was good stuff."
Kellie T.,"Burlingame, CA",44,10,,1.0,5/13/2015,"Disclaimer: This review is just for the lousy service. Totally pissed. Having been in the US for only 6 months or so, We decided to visit Cheesecake Factory for food and some dessert. At the door, we were told that we had to wait 5-10.  We asked if we could pop right back as I wanted to grab something from next door and got an Ok from the counter. 10 minutes later, when we got back in, i asked if our table was ready and the lady said ""oh if you pop out, we dont hold your place in line"". Both my husband and I were shocked as she said it was ""ok"" for us to pop out. Why was this not told to us before we popped out? We would have been 100% okay to wait in line. Did not bother with even trying to queue again - if service from the counter is this bad, i dont think the meal would have been very much more pleasant.  To take off more stars, the lady at the counter had a permanent frown (even when we first walked in) which definitely sucked."
Christian R.,"Fremont, CA",132,66,22,3.0,7/1/2013,"Their wait time is no longer as long as 1 CSI episode. Hooray! Went here on a Friday at around 6:30pm for my sister's birthday, and within 15 minutes, our seat is available. The problem was, my party has yet to cross San Mateo Bridge from Fremont, so I had to give up our seat. Their receptionist, despite the influx of people, was still very friendly and attentive.  The wait staff were very nice too. They were very attentive and enthusiastic. I really like it when they don't seem to have any problems at all even though you see that the restaurant is packed.  Why the 3 stars? Despite their great service, the food here is so-so-- which means nothing that I have eaten here has been exceptionally memorable for my taste buds (with the exception of their complimentary bread. lol)"
Kevin B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,1,1.0,6/18/2015,This place suck ass my $27 ribeye was dried and it was sitting in a bath of juice or something and it very salty as hell my calamari appetizer had bbq sauce on it and and a freaking onion ring in it as well I wish that I can give it no stars. You suck!!!
