Jamil M.,"San Bruno, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/17/2015,"When I came there before, the service was great.  After today, I WILL NOT go there  ever again.  The waitress (Danielle H) I had seemed like she wanted to rush, get a tip, and did not use proper food-handling techniques.  I brought a friend from out of state to enjoy the California life and going to the restaurant was unprofessional, unfriendly, and to point that I was ready to go legal with them.  The manager for today was not professional and was argumentative with me, the customer.  This place of business lacks customer service, professionalism, and poorly trained staff including the manager for today.  After awhile, the situation was fixed, however, this type of service is what WILL make people not want to go there again.  Even when I do customer service, I am not argumentative nor making it conflicting and speaking it's business practice.  Regardless of business practice or not, it is not professional and also I wonder because I was a minority that my friend and I was treated differently.  If this country is going to get better, this kind of behavior must stop.  I WILL NOT go there again because the first impression was the LAST impression going there."
Jacky L.,"San Francisco, CA",204,11,,2.0,4/5/2015,"Had high expectations for this place since there were a shit ton of people waiting just to get seated and prices were $18-$20 per dish. Came with a few friends and girlfriend. Everyone's order came on time, except for my girlfriend's pasta. My friend also ordered pasta and got hers. Waited for 30mins, and then server finally came and said it was gonna be extra time and asked if we wanted a complimentary soup with a guilty face. Soup had burnt bacon in it, tasted like leftovers. He probably forgot to put the pasta on the order. Near the end of our meal, a fat guy in a suit, presumably the manager, was apologizing to the table right behind our's. This tells you something about their competence, which is next to zero. 2 stars because the tiramisu cheesecake was cracking"
Raina S.,"El Granada, CA",386,567,340,1.0,1/24/2013,"I had low expectations for this place, but the Cheesecake Factory still managed to disappoint. My daughter and her friend wanted to eat here, so I figured I'd indulge them.  The place was moderately busy, but we were seated after only a short wait.  Our server was pleasant enough, but often disappeared for long stretches. I had a hard time choosing a dish, because there seem to be 500 items on the menu.  I figured a club sandwich with green salad would be a safe bet.  My lunch arrived with a salad that had no dressing at all.  This was actually fine because I used the lettuce on my sandwich (which was also underdressed).  The turkey was dry.  This was one of the most bland club sandwiches I've ever tasted.   My daughter's friend ordered fettuccine alfredo.  She barely touched it.  My daughter had the pasta marinara, which looked decent.  She also barely touched her dish, saying it was ""too spicy.""  Since I love spicy food, I decided to have her leftovers for lunch the next day.  The dish was horrible!  Turns out, it was spicy because the sauce was inundated by undercooked onions.  I think they were rancid, to boot. CF has a nice patio area (though it's not actually outdoors).  While it's quieter than the restaurant itself, I don't recommend you sit here.  The benches in this area are crammed together so tightly that there is no legroom, even for a shorty like me."
Ellen H.,"San Francisco, CA",48,239,20,2.0,4/15/2013,"Little Caesar Salad - overdressed, but passable.  Skinny chicken soft tacos - fair Kids Sliders or Pepperoni Pizza - good for kids Oreo Dream Extreme Cheese cake - huge and probably the only thing you should order!"
D C.,"San Carlos, CA",90,130,54,2.0,12/18/2013,"I have a hard time giving this place 2 stars because the food isn't bad, and usually, the service isn't bad, but the last experience we had sort of ticked me off. In time, maybe I can forgive and forget, and I'll revise my rating. Anyway, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for happy hour ($5 appetizers - HUGE portions - from 4-6 pm) and I've always been pretty pleased. On our last visit, we sat ourselves at a booth in the bar area, like we'd done before, and waited for a server to acknowledge us. One walked in our general direction, and then stopped at the computer station... and the minutes ticked by. Finally, 5 long minutes later, he walked over and asked if we were there for happy hour. When we said 'yes', we were told that we'd have to move, either to the bar, or to the tall tables in the bar area to be served from that menu.  Uh, what? We were literally in there a week and a half before, seated at a booth, and scarfing down happy hour menu items.  Grudgingly, we got up and moved to the little 2-person area at the end of the bar that was dropped down so low that we felt like we'd been seated at the kiddie table at a cousin's wedding.  After that, bar service was a little inattentive (probably because we were 2' below eye-level), but the food was still decent, and the prices were, as usual, unbeatable.  Food: Nachos are big, but the toppings can be a little sparse. Corn cakes are like Chevy's sweet corn tomalito, but gigantic and topped with all sorts of saucy, condiment-y things - right up my alley, since I love things smothered in wetness. Chicken sliders are greasy, and mostly bleh. Buffalo strips are again, meh, and the chicken has the weirdest, softest, mushiest processed texture I've ever experienced. Next time, I'm going back for the artichokes!"
Mary Anne P.,"San Mateo, CA",98,77,161,4.0,7/17/2013,I've come here a few times. It's conveniently located in the mall and near home :) The wait isn't as bad as the other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to. The service is consistently good and the food is good.  I'm loving the new pretzel chicken strips they have and can't wait for the smores cheesecake at the end of the month. It's a good go-to place.
Vineeta C.,"San Bruno, CA",75,71,34,2.0,1/4/2015,"Stopped in to catch the game today sat rite in front of the beer tap at the bar as I was alone, ordered a beer and tex mex rolls...everything was fine until small gnat flies started flying around...1 or 2 little ones NO worries but all of a sudden there was like 10 flying all around the beer tap now to the point the lady next to me told me there were 2 gnats in my full glass of beer YUUCK!!! And the bartenders seen me trying to shoo the flies away but didnt say anything and that means it's time to go I paid and left....be aware do not sit by the tap unless you want their new beer ""GNAT BEER"""
Girish P.,"Redwood City, CA",1,62,1,3.0,12/7/2014,"Sometimes it can take forever to get a seat. Once I was blantly told that they don't take reservations over phone. Seriously, AYK me!!!"
Eleanor E.,"San Mateo, CA",290,89,54,4.0,12/10/2013,"Came back on a Friday night with my friend around 7:00. Got there and the wait was about 45 minutes.  We left and then checked back in and were seated almost immediately by April at a pretty booth. Sat down and started looking through the menu, our server Jose was pretty good about greeting us, taking our orders, and paying out considering it was in the midst of a busy Friday night shift. We had a burger and the jambalaya. the burger was juicy, fries were fresh, and the pasta was amazing. We then squeezed in a red velvet cheesecake a la mode which was pretty good as well."
Belinda C.,"Daly City, CA",264,699,2962,3.0,11/20/2013,"This place is like any other cheesecake factory.  The only difference is that there is parking here.If you come here after 9 p.m. you can still get a table, it's around a 30 min wait.  I usually just get the desserts here.  This fall, they have the seasonal Pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  I found it too puImpkiny and not chhesecakey enough. The pecan filling is on the bottom as a second layer.  I thought it was going to be   mixed in. Overal, i would prefer coming here over the large crowds in downtown."
V M.,"San Rafael, CA",38,377,60,2.0,12/31/2014,"Our waiter, Dan, tonight was awesome! However, I went to use the ladies' room and out came one of the hostesses while I was washing my hands and she just walked right out without washing hers. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!"
Daniela H.,"Tracy, CA",11,20,12,4.0,2/17/2014,"I want to first say i was happily shocked when i found out the wait time was 30 minutes.  This place had to be the best service we have ever received. Our waiter was amazing, he made it a point to check in on us often and made sure our drinks were full. The food was delicious. I will be going again."
G R.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,3,2.0,5/31/2015,Long wait. Wait is too long for just pancakes and they came partially cooked. Couldn't eat it.
Justin D.,"San Carlos, CA",44,32,1,4.0,1/25/2015,"Cheesecake is delicious, and their burgers are consistently fantastic too.  Large portions make it easy to take some home as well."
Farin R.,"Redwood City, CA",4,7,,3.0,3/18/2015,"I would give this a 4 star but I removed 1 for their service. The food was great. This is the place so far best steak I've ever had and don't need to mention about their cheesecake, everybody knows how smooth,creamy,yummy are they. But the service? Worst. The waiting time is long,but that didn't bother us, the attitude of the staffs was extremely bad. We weren't provided free bread as it was supposed to be finished, but we saw some people were served that though they came after us. Was it any racism? I don't know. The only thing I know I won't go there ever."
Zak S.,"San Francisco, CA",179,47,14,2.0,3/17/2015,"Slow service. Our waiter was perfectly nice, just not very attentive. Other than when we ordered, we only saw him when he dropped off the bill. As far as food, it was okay at best. My tacos were pretty tasteless and for the price it's rather disappointing."
Mico S.,"Daly City, CA",26,34,4,5.0,5/29/2015,"We had a great experience. We were a big party - two couples and three kids, on a Sunday, but they handled everything professionally, with a smile and a great fast service. Drinks and food exceeded our expectations - fresh appetizers, but mostly well-cooked steaks."
Renee C.,"Portola Valley, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/19/2015,"This is possibly the worst Cheesecake factory in the country.  Entrees arrived over a 20 minute period -- with the kids meals coming the latest.  Two of our entrees were stone cold when they arrived -- we didn't send back as we were afraid how long it would take to heat the food.  Server was nice, but kitchen was a disaster.  We asked if the manager knew what was going on...but he/she never stopped by our table. Get the cheesecake to go and eat somewhere else...there are better options withinin walking distance!  We will NEVER go back to this location -- they are doing a disservice to the entire chain with their shoddy operation. AVOID THIS PLACE!"
S. K.,"San Mateo, CA",33,50,7,2.0,5/13/2013,"Took my mom here for brunch and it was our first time trying their breakfast. AWFUL!  First off we were quickly greeted by a ""hi there i'll be right with you"" no name, no face really because he just flew by us as he put napkins down. Then he disappeared. Another server saw us with our menu closed and still no drinks and actually acknowledged us and got our drinks for us. Still as we waited for our server to come nobody showed! After about 20 minutes i went up to the host asking who our waiter was and we're not getting service. Finally a manager came and apologized and got our server to actually pay attention but didnt really take it as a big deal and said hed comp a cheesecake at the end of our meal. A cheesecake? we're here for brunch and shopping, its 12pm! Anyways, we were kind of excited to finally try their breakfast but apparently nobody really orders breakfast here bc a)the eggs looked like they had been microwaved b) toast, no butter no jam c) my moms french toast came out not what was described in the menu and had to ask for the cream and the syrup d) forget coffee refill since apparently our waiter was way too busy for us. We couldnt get out of there fast enough. The new San Mateo Cheesecake Factory is a total FAIL!"
Piere H.,"San Carlos, CA",0,26,1,1.0,3/13/2016,"Seating party of 4 is a joke, if the person on front desk for whatever reason do not like something about you, you are toast, time wise."
