Courtney F.,"Pacifica, CA",1,3,1,5.0,4/5/2015,Had a very pleasant late lunch/early dinner here with Jose E as our server. He was a great waiter and went above to make our experience here enjoyable. As far as food I ordered the crushed chicken Ramono  with a Georgia peach beverage and my parents both ordered the steak Diane. The portions were big as always and the wait time for our meal was exceptionally fast for a mid day rush. All around a great dinning experience.
Lisa K.,"San Mateo, CA",0,33,5,2.0,4/4/2015,"Always crowded. I like their services, however, the foods are just soso. Nothing surprised us. Foods are plain. There's nothing on the menu could make us want to order... most of them are chicken dishes. If you are not a fan of chicken, you do not want to go there. The only good things are: 1. Big portion (can't not finish the whole plate at once) but it's not tasty anyways  2. Desserts are pretty good."
Muresan R.,"San Mateo, CA",2,39,1,1.0,7/15/2013,"Tonight I came with some friends to have a nice dinner on the patio and listen to good music. Unfortunately I had the worst time ever and I will never ever come back here again! First, I ordered some thin spaghetti with prawns and tomato sauce (which wasn't there, only the tomatoes), and second I had an argument with the waiter who was rude and arrogant from the moment we came in. I told him to get the manager and he refused. Is it that hard to find a good restaurant with good service, which is rare nowadays?? And by the way this waiter is working here for 2 years and nobody seams to check or care if he knows customer service! And if he thinks, he tried to make it better by bringing me a slice of cheesecake which he threw on the table, like an obligation, he was terribly wrong. I don't need cake, I need nice people to come for again."
Cay A.,"Burlingame, CA",32,214,315,1.0,9/27/2013,"Service was excellent, the place is nice, the bathrooms are super nice BUT the hot spinach and cheese dip that I ordered was tasteless :-(  No seasoning at all...and to think I was adding the salsa and the sour cream.  Really poor way to spend $11."
Edwin N.,"Fremont, CA",42,207,15,5.0,10/28/2013,This review is for their cheesecake and coffee only. After an evening of shopping my group wanted a snack before our drive home to the East Bay.  We were immediately seated and when we informed our waiter that we only wanted dessert he didn't seem to mind. We all ordered different types of cheesecake and they were all delicious. I had the key lime mango cheesecake just because I wanted to try something different and I was not disappointed. I was eyeballing my cousins Godiva chocolate cheesecake...it looked and tasted amazing. The coffee was excellent strong and full of flavor. It's been a few years since I last visited a Cheesecake Factory and I am glad I did.
LuLu R.,"Redwood City, CA",0,26,4,4.0,5/3/2015,"I recommend that if you and your family are out in the area and are looking for a place, this is the place hands down. Ask for Romy! He made our experience very exciting, comforting and enjoyable. A lot of restaurants are charging an arm and a leg, but the quality in food and service are extremely poor. NOT THIS PLACE! With someone like Romy who is consistent in his customer service and the quality of food, may be the booster you need for the week! I never felt so glad and was happy to spend a lot on just a two person dinner. It made all the difference in the world when every expectation met our needs!"
Eric C.,"San Francisco, CA",212,387,417,2.0,10/11/2013,"Dear Hillsdale cheesecake factory. You will now be compared to Union square cheesecake factory.  By now after reading then first line. You could almost assume that this location is in imminent danger of getting ripped and chewed out like Hi-Chews from chinatown ... and from what went on down here. They would either need that or a total turnover of a number of wait staff... Granted there are some competent staff members here that deserve to keep their jobs. But others here would prefer to try to hit on and get with their coworkers before paying attention to the customers. Not the newest discovery in a chain restaurant.   However I am fairly sure that when your immediate guests include a bowler who is used to adapting his hearing to constant clanging, banging and high pitched screaming and arguing on the lanes + a couple of military personnel who are accustomed to IED and other explosives going off in short proximity from them  in addition to a number of patrons in their golden years sitting right by us...yet we can still hear your conversations without having to mute our silverware..then clearly you have a problem or just can't wait to hit on the girl you work with huh? Anyways back the food. Having ordered what cheesecake considers their rendition of the ""western"" burger/smokehouse... the first things I notice are the following two things... A)I think your BBQ sauce dispenser literally had an incident of the runs...cause I had to use a fork and knife to find the meat. (Don't complicate that statement)  [-1] B) By the time I did find the meat. I was worried about whether OE not the chef himself had the runs too haha..man was it dry....(don't complicate that statement either). [-1] By the time I even got through trying to finish the dish...all of the hot fried rings and grilles Bacon...coupled with the cooked to death beef patty didn't even allow me to consider the dessert menu. Which Is what the establishment is known for... How does it stack up to SF  Pros -- Cheaper parking Cons-- Because of then area its in. Hillsdale staff is seemingly the equivalent to the company practice squad when compared to SF's roster...at least when I've been here and there it seems as such.. What's the final negative star? - The parking + our particular female served kept it from being a total 0-1 star embarrassment however... we had to get our silverware sets  replaced due to unsanitary conditions. Kinda hard to tell till you unwrap your place mat but it was a standing issue that was resolved...however it will still count against you..just like a state health inspection.... which reminds me...thank god your bathrooms had space....but you could afford to have more stalls and urinals.. especially given your portions, quality and location....think SFO when you consider your bathroom layouts...it will be more convenient..no one standing in the covered urinal wants to be in the same immediate space as someone deciding to play battle-shit am I Right?"
Cicily C.,"San Francisco, CA",244,60,50,5.0,12/8/2014,"This review is mostly based on the service. I came here for dinner and the wait was only like 5 minutes long on a Wednesday night. The food was nothing too fancy but I still enjoyed it, like usual. I usually get some sort of pasta & I'm always satisfied. Anyway. Our waitress, Makaila (I probably misspelled that), was awesome. She helped me pull a fast one on my boyfriend and let me grab the check before we were done eating. She even had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on our cheesecake plate even though it wasn't requested or anything. When we were done eating and my boyfriend asked for the bill, she even handed him a fake bill that said that the bill was taken care of. It was really nice of her to go along with me. It was refreshing to get such good service at a restaurant. These 5 stars go right to her :)"
Mike C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5,23,1,2.0,11/3/2013,I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and this Cheesecake Factory is what you'd expect from a chain restaurant: big portions of unremarkable food.  Nothing really bad to say about it other than the whole experience is designed by corporate headquarters for mass market appeal. Their menu does have some healthy options which I appreciate though most items are calorie bombs.
Warren D.,"Oakland, CA",1,26,3,2.0,7/10/2013,"This place was a bumout. I have never watched an episode of the TV show the Kardishians but I have seen lots of commercials for it and I have heard lots of people talk about it. So, you could say I have limited knowledge of the Kardashians, and some limited insight or expectations. Same thing for the Cheesecake Factory. It was bloated, post-Tuscan, too-many-choice-kill-them-with-calorific-horror-coma choice menu bedazzle them with marble and make it up with a mark up. Service was OK."
Deborah B.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,3,2,1.0,4/26/2015,"Our experience at this location was very disappointing. Service was slow and irratic. Our party of 3 ordered simple menu items. One person received their food 15mins ahead of the others. Then those items arrived cold  the flavor was nothing special. And the bill was over 70, in spite of the fact none of us ordered a cocktail. Apparently the sad dinner salads pushed the bill up."
N S.,"San Francisco, CA",52,63,846,5.0,10/28/2012,"OMG. I LOVE THIS PLACEE! my very very first time going to the cheesecake factory. ive always thiught it was actually A CHEESECAKE FACTORY. but its not lol. my friends took me to there. and we ont had to wait for 15 minutes! so we go tot our seats.

W. M.,"Fremont, CA",1,60,4,2.0,1/11/2016,"I would give it a 2 1/2 stars max!!!!! I've been to better Cheesecake Factory's. The service is average and could be better. We have been there a few times. Each time, something was wrong such as salad was dirty, order was wrong or taken very long to get our food. This Cheesecake Factory has nothing nice to offer. I'd rather drive further and go to a different one or skip it and go to a totally different restaurant."
Jo S.,"San Francisco, CA",43,168,3,4.0,4/24/2013,Items I've tried: Farfalle with chicken pasta- yum Phillie cheese steak- greasy goodness Lettuce wraps- yum Crab bites-yum Vietnamese tacos-yum Key lime cheesecake- a little tangy but good Tuxedo cheesecake-so good but so bad. I googled the calories and it said 900 calories per slice. OMG!! What did I just put into my body?!!! Service is hit or miss. One day you'll get an attentive waiter/ waitress another day not so much.
MJ P.,"Daly City, CA",0,8,2,1.0,11/4/2012,"Hostesses are rude!! Don't get me wrong I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's around the Bay Area and they were great. But this one is the worst. I know the wait time can get really crazy. That's given at any of their locations. But over here is out of control. Tonight I had a party of 3. Hostess told me about 50min. I didn't mind the wait. After awhile I noticed folks coming in after me getting seated. I simply asked the hostess why others were being seated before me. Her response was "" I just had to wait!"" If I had gotten a more respectful response I would of simply waited. Instead I cancelled my party and left. I will definitely not be returning to this location anymore. I would rather wait hours in the downtown location rather than deal with snobby hostesses like that one. If you come to this location just shop instead. Hillsdale mall is right next door haha"
Mari R.,"San Jose, CA",14,22,,3.0,10/24/2014,"As much as I don't like long waiting times to be seated, I still enjoy eating here. I really like their sweet corn tamale cakes!!!"
Jay F.,"Redwood City, CA",100,24,,4.0,2/7/2015,"Ordered a cheese cake for my cousins bday.  The selection was fantastic.  We went with the white chocolate raspberry truffle.  At first I was definitely NOT happy to pay 58$ for a cheesecake.  I wasnt even that impressed when I saw it.  I changed my mind when i tasted it.  It was AMAZING.  I loved every bite and can't wait to try the other cakes.  I'm still not happy with the 58$ price tag, but for a party, I'd do it again for sure."
Kayla B.,"San Mateo, CA",2,6,3,4.0,6/14/2014,The cheese cake selection is awesome! Wait can be rather long. I recommend eating here on a weekday or for lunch. I really enjoy the Asian salad and the four cheese pasta.
Alex A.,"San Francisco, CA",245,33,,4.0,9/20/2013,The food was delicious. I always order the Chicken Carbonara or Chicken Maggiano... Best plates for your money. I like this one in particular because the wait isn't so bad. The bar is also a good place to sit as the bartenders are sweethearts. The noise level is moderate and the service is great. Super clean place and can't get enough. Will be back as soon as i go shopping soon.
Matthew G.,"San Mateo, CA",131,801,1348,4.0,8/15/2013,the decor is always the same! every single cheesecake factory looks the same.  kinda crazy.  new place just opened at hillsdale mall.  always crowded.  chain restaurant so you know what you're getting.  cheesecakes are rich and creamy.  on cheesecake day the lines were ridiculous.  had to dine in only to get half off.  waited about 40 minutes at 8pm! oh well so worth it for the new s'more cheesecake.  probably the best flavor they have.  food is meh.  its for fat people cause such big portions and so many calories.  well always gotta have cheesecake at the end.  servers in white.  bad idea when so much to spill and splatter.  so far all the waiters have been nice and attentive.   no complaints.  dessert is here!
