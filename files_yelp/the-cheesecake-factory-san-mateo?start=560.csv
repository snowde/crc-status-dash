Anita H.,"Burlingame, CA",1,5,,1.0,9/26/2015,"I will never eat here again. We got sat relatively quickly, however from there the wait began. We had a 3 year old and a 2 year old with us, so waiting 40 minutes for their dinner, which came about 15 minutes before ours (yes....that is over 50 minutes of waiting for our food) was not cool by any standard - especially  hungry toddler standards. But wait, when the ""Kids Chicken"" came the plate was hotter than the sun (not a great idea to put in front of a 3 year old) and the chicken was harder than shoe leather. We think it was microwaved because the rest of the plate (potatoes and carrots) were tough and jello like consistency. So we didn't even get to eat that. Then our turkey burgers arrived and were drier than the Sahara Desert, but at least they could be eaten by our kids and us, so we shared this. We also ordered sweet potato fries which didn't arrive and then we had to ask our waiter, who honestly couldn't care less about us, to remove them from our bill. As stated in the beginning, I will never be spending money in this establishment ever again."
Pamela K.,"San Mateo, CA",57,74,12,2.0,6/26/2013,"I gave 'em almost two years. Isn't that enough? The construction is finished and it's still unbelievably noisy. Can hardly have a conversation. Not because the customers are that loud but because of the hard surfaces. Then the customers get louder to be heard over the ambient racket and everything escalates. The menu? It's about half as large as it was with many of my old faves gone. Might be okay with you but for me, I'm done. Salads down to a few. No more Shepherd's Pie. A bajillion chicken dishes. Seriously? Everybody does chicken. Looked like an impressive appetizer menu.  But, the wait staff is really good now. They got that part dialed in.  Still sayin', go if you must. Go if you gotta have cheesecake. Maybe just go for appetizers and dessert... Then scram."
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,10/8/2011,Great stopping off place at the Hillsdale mall Several draft beer choices for Happy Hour along with wine & food specials Love the potstickers Pumpkin cheesecake was delish; Reese's peanut butter cheesecake was a little sweet Good food service
Fanny W.,"San Francisco, CA",16,31,19,2.0,2/24/2013,"When my boyfriend and I were seated, we noticed there was a cup of spilled water under our booth that was not cleaned. Our table had napkins and plates but no utensils, and the whole time we were there, there were no bread served to us because they were out and were baking them at the time.  When our dishes arrived, my boyfriend's chicken was extremely dry; my plate of pasta had a mix of bow ties and string spaghetti (even though it was supposed to be JUST bow ties), and it was really undercooked.  We were served by two different waitresses at the same time, which is uncommon considering the only time that usually happens is when one will cover for the other if our original waitress is on break. The only reason why this location even received two stars was because our waitress kept following up with our drinks and felt bad that we were not served any bread through out our meal, she gave us an entire loaf to take home.  This have been the WORST Cheesecake Factory location I've been to yet."
Dwyn A.,"Belmont, CA",9,13,,1.0,9/8/2014,"Terrible food, terrible service. They screwed up my salad majorly, then, when i complained, they brought another one that was missing half the ingredients and had no dressing. I just stopped bothering complaining, since clearly they were too busy to make a decent meal. Would never ever go here again, seriously overpriced with low quality food and inattentive staff. Cheesecake was mediocre as well, extremely disappointing. Don't go here if you want satisfying meal."

Jennifer F.,"Raleigh, NC",31,100,65,4.0,1/1/2013,"New Year's Day.  I had a party of 13, I took my group from work.  We were seated a few mins after arriving.  They gave us time to look over the menu & figure out what we wanted.  They filled our drinks & asked what we wanted all through out our visit.  We were there from 11:30a-2p.  We had a meal & dessert.  My group was very pleased with everything.  Our bill was $350, which wasn't bad for 13 meals, 13 drinks, 13 desserts, tax, & tip.  Meals were reasonably priced & we got so much for the price.  The desserts are expensive, but they are known for great desserts, they were delicious, everyone enjoyed them.  Everything came timely.  Only downer was some cheesecakes were not available, this was no big deal, as they had so many selections, & keep in mind, it was the holidays, & I can imagine it was so busy.   Over all, no real complaints.  Mind you I also work with people with developmental disabilities.  The staff was very patient & kind to my group.  Thank you for such a wonderful meal."
Olivia R.,"San Francisco, CA",182,1,,5.0,9/1/2014,"Took my friend out to dinner for her birthday last night and had amazing service plus food.  The waiters were extremely nice to us. I totally recommend giving big tips to Tim and Mike if you get either of them when you go there.  We had great conversations.  Tim even apologized asking my friend if she wanted to order another cheesecake because the one she originally asked for was currently frozen, and it took a little longer to get to us.  But she ordered it frozen, and said it was the best decision of her life (note that it was dulce de leche, best one there.) It is like A la mode all by in one!  It was cute how they decorated her plate and sang happy birthday to her.  The best part was when she told them to rap it and they all tried to improvise and beat box.  It was a fantastic night. :)  The skinnylicious herb-crusted salmon salad and chicken lettuce wrap tacos are great dishes too!"
Marty C.,"San Jose, CA",161,53,53,2.0,7/7/2014,Came here on Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar because there was no one to greet us. Bar service was the worst I've had so far.  Food took over an hour and they were not even busy. Food came out still no silverware. Drinks weren't topped off. Waiter wasn't around. All in all I don't think I'll be returning here. SF or PA are much better
Frank G.,"Antioch, CA",933,8,1,1.0,9/14/2014,I would give zero stars if I could but the General Manager there is a total JERK! I saw him get in someone's face. Very unprofessional!  I do recommend the Pleasant Hill and walnut Creek location
BRASS SERVICES B.,"Redwood City, CA",12,56,1,1.0,9/6/2014,"An overall disappointing experience for a high end place.  We should have returned to the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto where we've received great personal service every time.  We chose to try a different location to our chagrin.  The second-day-solo waitress ignored us, saw us once at the end of dinner, didn't offer dessert, and otherwise attended every table around us.  Sucks to be at the ""ignore them""-table."
Alison G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,11,,2.0,1/20/2014,"My husband and I received a CF gift card so we dropped by mid afternoon on a Saturday. No wait, friendly service, and the gluten free menu is extensive. The catch? Even though I made it clear to our server that I have a medical condition the food was contaminated (with gluten).  The contamination was so severe I wasn't able to make it home before becoming ill. We won't be back. My husband's food was tasty, apparently. Mine was just fine (taste-wise). The bottom line: celiacs beware!"
Collyn J.,"Pacoima, CA",112,150,535,4.0,7/29/2013,"It's your typical Cheesecake Factory. I'm writing this solely on our waiter. He was very personable, attentive, and always checked on our table. My sister, cousin, and I were confused as to what his name was, but we know it started with a ""D""."
Gayle Y.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",313,14,3,1.0,9/22/2015,"Came here for dinner and waited about 15 minutes or so for a table. When we got seated, the waiter introduced himself and asked if he could get us anything to drink, and that he was taking over for JP while he was on lunch. (I wish I could remember his name, but this was on 9/21/15 around 7:15pm.) He brought us back our two waters and we asked for a few minutes to look at the menu. He came back and took our order. All we ordered was the crab and artichoke dip and a bacon bacon cheeseburger with everything on the side.  15 minutes passed and we were still waiting for our food. Then 20. He came back to our table and specifically said, ""Let me go grab your food for you."" I assumed that meant he was going to the kitchen to get our food for us right? He never came back. Another 10 minutes passed. I had to get up and go over to the registers where I saw him standing and talking to other coworkers and ask if someone was going to get our food because he never came back to check on us. Then he says, ""Oh, yeahhhh you've been waiting like 15-20 minutes right? A manager didn't come to your table? Someone accidentally took your food and they had to remake it. So the manager should be bringing it out shortly."" I then saw someone in a maroon button up shirt (who I assumed was the manager) observe us during the conversation, but he didn't say anything at all while I was asking the waiter where our food was. There were two other waiters around us that checked in with their tables almost 3 times each to make sure they were okay. We sat there and no one came back to check on us.  First off, if you're already acknowledging that I was waiting 15-20 minutes for my food, you should have checked in with us. Second, I wouldn't have cared so much that someone accidentally gave our food to another table and that we waited so long for it, but not once did you communicate that with us while we were sitting and waiting for our food. Third, a manager didn't even come to our table to apologize for the inconvenience, nor did they bring our food out for us like the first waiter said they would.  JP, the waiter who was on break, came back and introduced himself. He was very nice and I actually almost felt bad for him because he had to clean up the mess that the previous waiter left. He ended up getting our food for us and took over the table for the rest of the night.  The one star goes to JP. But other than him, the service sucked."
Eric C.,"Burlingame, CA",0,40,,3.0,3/29/2015,"My wife was given a gift card, so we had to go try it.  We (party of four) went for Sunday brunch. Got right in, no wait.   Very modern decor, attractive restaurant. Service was very pleasant, but not fast.   But, even so, we were in and out in an hour.  Food was very good, generous portions, large and varied menu. We had a good time, but then we were not in a hurry and enjoyed talking among ourselves.  This would not be a good place if you are in a hurry.  If you have time, pretty good. Group at the next table looked like the cast from Big Bang Theory. Young urban professionals, one woman person among them."
Jacqueline M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,15,5.0,8/23/2014,One of my favorite restaurants I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory every appetizer I've tried have been delicious and we usually try different ones every time we go they have big plates we always get so full no room even for dessert but that doesn't stop us from taking one home I love the red velvet no reason to try any other but my husband loves the dulce de leche this is one of his favorite places too we come here regularly and won't stop anytime soon they have great food and service they deserve 10 stars not 5
S F.,"South San Francisco, CA",8,194,81,2.0,8/14/2015,"I have a love and hate relationship with this place. What is it about chain restaurants that gets people line out the door? Food, certain dish are awesome and some are not ok to feed it to my dogs. Service, waiters and waitresses are always nice. Hostess ....some are an  evil troll and rolled their eyes a lot and some are cute as can be. And for the ToGo section... Today I went in early and got a lovely lady helping me out and then there are days that I got a yappers that constantly yapping. To each other and not at all acknowledge customers in line. Brought a salad dressing and miss attitude with troll face is bitching about her boyfriend.......WTF??? Shouldn't you be getting my dressing but... Noooooo... After ringing me up, She went back yapping and when my friend got her attention about that. She had a nerves to doing the neck whip thing snapping "" I have to go to the kitchen and get it"" uh.... Ok... Maybe that is why you are having a man problem. Too much attitude perhaps? Take this place with a grain of salt. Go early and get better treatment. If late or when they are slammed...sigh... Healthy side of attitude comes with your meal. With Hefty extra charge by the way."
Katarina S.,"El Granada, CA",59,42,60,4.0,8/24/2013,"My mother and I like to come here after shopping since you don't even have to leave the mall to get inside.  The other day, we sat at the bar because we were only interested in drinks and appetizers and didn't want to wait for a table.  At first i told the waitress i wasn't interested in a bread basket, but the bread at Cheescake Factory is superb so I gave in. I took about ten minutes for the bread to come out, but the waitress said this was because it was just coming out of the oven.  I ordered a Greek salad and my mother ordered the roadside sliders. They were both delicious, and for dessert I ordered the strawberry shortcake. In my opinion this dessert trumps ALL of their cheesecakes. It's huge, and has tons of strawberries, a flaky warm biscuit, and 3 scoops of ice cream with a whomping portion of whipped cream on top. Definitely good to share!  Overall the service could have been better, but my experience wasn't bad."
Tammy K.,"Long Beach, CA",4,14,9,1.0,12/4/2014,Things have changed... I have been going here on and off for about a month and things have definantly been better. I sat at the bar and waited 15 minutes to get a drink and watched the bartender help what seemed like her friends get drinks before me. I tried flagging her down twice before she looked over annoyed that I was asking for a drink. The last few times I've been here they had forgotten a side I had ordered and brought it out after I had already finished my other food. It should be interesting to see how long it takes for my food to come out this time. I don't think I will be back. It's to bad cause the food it actually pretty good.
Karyn L.,"Milpitas, CA",118,138,152,3.0,10/13/2014,"It's an easy stop for a variety of meal options.  But definitely a 5 star for their strawberry cheesecake!  Haven't received bad service here and only had to sit in their broken AC restaurant once.  Other than that, come early before the lunch/dinner rush or make a reservation.  Portions are large."
