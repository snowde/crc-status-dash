Ciarra C.,"Hayward, CA",81,43,52,1.0,7/7/2014,This restaurant sucks now! The food sucks! The servers suck! The entire establishment sucks! It's also very cold!  Tables are dirty! Check your silverware & plates. Damn near $5 for lemonade (aka a bunch of sugar and syrup) I've had it with this place but decided to give it one last try! Sort of like giving that ex one last try ? Yeah so it still sucked!  Lesson learned! Waiter didn't offer bread (although I'm watching my carb intake) or appetizers. Food was sloppy! They're like TGIF now. I rather go to Paul Martins! Paul Martins could check the hostess attitude at the door but other than that their food is delicious!!!
M M.,"Moss Beach, CA",0,144,13,1.0,8/9/2014,"Overpriced, overstaffed, and overrated.  There were about 5 teeny boppers lurking around our table, but yet none of our food showed up hot and when it was ordered.  I got the skinnylicous menu item shrimp and angel hair pasta.  The angel hair pasta was hard on top which implied that it sat gathering dust while I sat at the table hungry.  Linda's fudge cake was good, but I have had better and the price was not that great.  The southern fried catfish was soggy, salty, and bland.  I don't get what the big deal is, I pay just as much to eat at a NICE restaurant but the difference is at the NICE restaurant I get quality food and service too."
Shilo B.,"San Francisco, CA",183,164,72,3.0,1/16/2013,"Seeing as I was in the same vicinity, I decided to try the place out. Granted, it was a Friday night and I should have made reservations or came in earlier but it seemed to not be such a big deal to the Host. Upon arrival, the Host encouraged me to stay and told my party the wait for 3 would be 20-30 mins max.  At that point, my party and I found ourselves at the bar, eating appetizers and getting our drinks. Mind you, when my tag finally vibrated and lit up, it was literally an hour later. At this point, I just wanted to eat. So, we ordered our food right away, I ordered the Sante Fe Salad. I requested - no corn. What did I get? Corn. And my chicken? Beside the fact that there was barely any in there, it was burned and tasted as if it had been either reheated or left on the grill for too long. On top of that, the dressing tasted as if it wasn't refrigerated properly or left out. I don't know if it was because it was a Friday night or really busy but the food mistakes is unexcuseable. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
Elaine S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/24/2014,"I came here with a friend last night by default - Macaroni Grill was closed, and California Pizza Kitchen was closed for the night. The wait was about half an hour at 9 PM, and the food didn't take too long to prepare. I had ordered the veggie burger with fries, which came with ketchup & garlic aioli. I ate half of my veggie burger last night, and while eating the other half today, I was appalled to find part of a rubber band in the veggie burger patty. I'm not sure where the rest of the rubber band is. Needless to say, I am never going to a Cheesecake Factory again."
Jon C.,"Daly City, CA",0,8,1,3.0,1/16/2016,We had a party of 6 we waited the 45 minutes and when we went to check in the manager just stands at the hostess stand and ignores us (poor manners) until the stand-in hostess said we had to wait longer and he only then said I'll take care of it. The servers are great but the greeting staff SUCKS!!!!
Lynda L.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/10/2016,Had heard at this newer location..long wait..& it was so....for such a mediocre food....I don't get it...way too long..hour?some hour& a half?!!!

Keith B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/20/2014,"Food is good but the service is very hit and miss, much better when sitting at the bar."
Benjie S.,"Daly City, CA",0,17,1,1.0,1/8/2016,the service was perfect the waitress was perfect but the food is well...a big 0 i order my steak medium rare the gave me a well done i sent it back they brough me another it was medium well. i am very disappointed my girlfriends food was dry and just not good we have been to the one in the city and it was awsome we decided to come to san mateo because it easier to park and less traffic but commuting to the city is way worth it over this place
michael n.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/7/2016,"We have always liked this  restaurant, good food, beautiful interior, reasonable prices, etc. unfortunately management and the front desk is manned by twenty something year-olds with questionable discretion. We visited the San Mateo location the other day with most unpleasant results. After being seated the waiter sat an obvious street person right behind us. His belonging were in a plastic bag, he was dirty and his SMELL was beyond belief. We moved to a new location but we still can not get the aroma out of our brain. I am indeed sorry for his plight, but a place like this can't seat these type of people, unless they want to drive out their regular clientele. A restaurant has legal right and discretion to not serve anyone. They need servers who exercise their discretion."
V U.,"Daly City, CA",80,152,5,2.0,6/15/2012,"The service was horrible.  The last time I came here to eat, the server forgot about our bread. I reminded him about it twice. He finally brought it out after he brought us our entrees.. and get this- the bread was cold and stale, and the butter was warm & melted.  It ruined my dining experience because it was something so simple yet it wasn't executed correctly."
Kyra S.,"Union City, CA",505,410,1205,5.0,6/19/2014,I've been at the San Francisco cheesecake factory and now this one. We walked in at approximately 730 and we're seated right away for a party of three. The menu is vast I like the idea that they had slim food for people looking to not eat 1000 cal for one meal. Is a menu that has either 590 or 490 cal per meal. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich that comes with a green salad. It was really delicious and the salad and dressing was good to. I would definitely come here again and eat this meal. My five-year-old daughter had the pizza I took a bite of it and it was very garlicky.  My 15-year-old daughter ordered fettuccine Alfredo and the portion was smaller than I expected. But all in all she enjoyed her meal very much.
Janine C.,"Daly City, CA",206,42,45,1.0,5/13/2015,"I always eat at cheesecake with my family. Today we got really bad service by Arthur P.  We asked to order and he said hold on and didn't come back after 20 minutes. He gave us bread and left without asking how we're doing. We keep waiting for him to give us the small plates and we ended up eating in our napkins. We asked another server for plates and she gave us some for the bread. He came back later with the food having no idea with the napkins. We asked him for bread to go with the pasta. He also didn't come back for awhile and again we asked a different server for bread and they gave us bread. After I called him over to ask for water because I was so thirsty. He said yea and then told us their bread is still cooking in the oven, when I told him that another server already gave us bread. In addition so many breads were coming out of the kitchen to different tables. Again it took awhile for my water and we had to ask another server. He then gave us a bill before he gave us the to go boxes. Too much waiting and we didn't get served properly. I Also wrote this whole thing while waiting for him and to pick up our bill."
A G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,23,2,3.0,9/18/2014,"Sampled a few cheesecakes in a group and as recommended by some other reviewers the Raspberry lemon is truly the best. Tiramisu cheesecake was OK too. Others were too sweet.  The brown bread they bring out for the table along with the sour dough ones are really very good, just by themselves, or with the butter, or with the pasta. The sweet potato fries were really good. Skinnylicious menu is interesting, but then portions get pretty small.  The vegetarian pasta I ordered was OK. Later found out that some other non-vegetarian dishes could be ordered without meat. I wanted to give 2 stars as I found a melted plastic piece in my pasta. But, it is really an OK."
John A.,"San Bruno, CA",0,33,6,1.0,10/25/2015,Good food but quoted 45 minute and was actually over an hour on a Sunday night. Finally sitting at the table starving. Tons of empty tables back here which tells me they are just under staffed. I'm just thinking a large publicly traded company like this should do something about adequate staffing. Look at the trend of busy times and get more staff. You think?
R A.,"San Mateo, CA",47,14,,1.0,9/29/2015,Horrible service and found a hair in my food! Water was never refilled and service was very halfass.
eric g.,"Redwood City, CA",13,103,9,5.0,2/24/2015,100%  Cheesecakes     Good  food    The  best   Cool  place to  eat   The  best  cheese cakes     Yummy   Food
Briana F.,"San Francisco, CA",6,72,2,3.0,7/9/2012,"Decent food. Average service. Loud atmosphere. Good for groups, just about every kind of food, kid options, reasonable (especially for the quantity offered), all-in-all gets the job done, but nothing to shout about. I would order the Ahi Carpaccio again--yum!"
Susie S.,"San Mateo, CA",18,7,1,5.0,12/19/2015,"We like to eat at the bar at Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale Shopping Center. The bartender, Melanie is cheerful, fast at serving and fun to talk to. She is efficient at her job (several bartenders there are very good) and her smiles light up the day/evening. The food is good, drinks great and Melanie should be given a bonus for great attitude!"
T L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,10,2,2.0,11/14/2015,"It's not the food that's the problem here, it's simply their shitty ass service. The hostess was arguing with my mother about a table that has been ready for the longest time because I saw them set it up and we waited another 30-45 mins. It was ridiculous and the hostess still refused to sit us. The wait wasn't worth it"
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,5,4,2.0,11/14/2015,rude workers period and bad bad service too. pissed me and my family off real bad. I wouldn't suggest I would rather get take out or some pizza in all honest opinion or find like a different location if you really want Cheesecake Factory. took 1 hour and 45 min
