Love Food And Wine W.,"San Mateo, CA",8,61,18,1.0,2/25/2017,"Been here so many times yet they still do not improve their service and sometimes food quality. Ordered curbside, called when I got to curbside, said they'd bring my food out, waited 20 minutes yet still no food, called back and the manager stated they are don't do curbside but it's clearly stated on the website it is offered. I told him you always give me some reason as to why you are not providing curbside. He then said we are short staffed. Well please remove curbside advertising and or fix the staffing issue. It is clearly false advertising to advertise curbside on your website and not provide it.  Worse of all, it was Valentine's Day so thought we'd eat at home. Then when I unpacked my entrees noticed the two chicken de pana entrees had spoiled broccoli. The broccoli was in terrible shape, discolored, with a strange smell. Not only was your service poor but so was the food. Gee, it's shameful really. Who is cooking and packaging the food? How can the cook see this and serve then package it and give it to customers in this condition? Or maybe the waitress packaged the food? Customers pay for edible food and expect good food. I had to throw it away and figure out what else to eat."
Dennette S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",66,97,216,4.0,9/25/2016,"Dont go hear if you are in a hurry. The menu has a lot of choices,  almost too many.  the service is very slow. Although our waiter was very nice, it took forever to take our order, then to get our food.  We tried the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer, it was delicious.  I had the factory burger and it was very dry. No condiments on it and nothing on the table. Asked for mayo and mustard ( it took 10-15 min to get it). The pasta cabanero was good and my husband's omelet was very good too. For dessert we had chris's cheesecake. A 7 layer style. Best part of the meal.."
Mike M.,"Belmont, CA",111,451,909,1.0,2/7/2016,"Just came from The Cheesecake Factory to pick up a few cheesecakes for my girlfriend & I, then while trying to pay with a gift card (that was brand new and had $50 on it), the service clerk, Katherine S (at the pickup counter) claimed that it had $0 on it with an attitude and basically waited for me to pay with a different form of payment.  I complied and paid with my credit card, then she decides to check the gift card after the transaction was complete and magically found $50 on it.  The clerk continues with her attitude even after packing everything.   To the management of this location, I HIGHLY recommend you re-train this person or let them go! She should have validated the card or went to get a manager, plus there was ABSOLUTELY NO NEED for her attitude. I've been a loyal customer of The Cheesecake Factory Hillsdale location for years, but after this experience, I'll be more than happy to drive to Palo Alto or even San Jose before I ever drop a dime in this location again.  I'm a huge fan of your food, but the service at this location STINKS!"
Iman S.,"Toledo, OH",17,21,,3.0,9/28/2017,"So this location is nice in the summer because it has outdoor seating and a nice ambiance. However, the Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated in my opinion. There's such an immense menu that you can get anything you imagine, but your pasta or burger won't be an over the top heavenly experience. It'll be a consistent solid good experience whatever you order, but nothing is to rave about other than the comfort of knowing every comfort food you may be craving is likely on the menu and it's a consistent enough place it won't disappoint you when you go"
Ahna B.,"Montara, CA",760,151,16,5.0,4/23/2017,My bf and I had great cocktails and the food was really delicious today. The cheesecake oh the cheesecake yum.
Sharine d.,"San Francisco, CA",127,274,98,2.0,4/14/2017,"No wait to be seated, but long wait for watress to come over. Ordered  Cobb salad.....would have been fine, if the chicken had been left off. Chicken was endlessly chewy.....tasted like frozen sandwich meat.  Appetizers were good : crab & artichoke, stuffed mushroom, avacado rolls"
Tiff C.,"San Francisco, CA",1132,1047,1737,2.0,2/4/2016,"I don't know why I bother going to Cheesecake Factory when I know I am not a fan. The food is mediocre and pricey for what you get. The only thing that was really good were the avocado egg rolls which I guess you can't go wrong with since they're fried. Service was so-so, I could tell that the server was getting annoyed with us and I do admit we are needy, but suck it up.. I am sure you've gotten worse people. I accidentally spilled my soda and one of the employees took care of it super quick. The server sort of made it seem like it was a problem that it had happened. Oh well! Accidents happen.... it wasn't that big of a deal!.. For my entree, I ordered a fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it was okay. Portions are big, but I still don't think it is worth the amount they charge. I will not be returning."
Navid N.,"San Mateo, CA",142,19,4,2.0,4/3/2017,"I've been to this establishment countless times. There are times where I come out happy, but also times where I didn't receive my food at all. This review summarizes my dinner I had two months ago to celebrate Valentines Day with my family. We came to have dinner on Saturday night, but we were told that the wait would be over an hour and a half long. We decided to wait until a bar seat was opened, no luck. So we waited about half an hour, early actually, to receive a table. The waiter was very nice and did her best to make sure that we were taken care of, but the long wait for food AND bread AND drinks didn't help her cause. For dinner, I had the Factory Burger, which has been one of my favorites. The overall taste was average, but it wasn't as delicious as it was in previous visits. The burger was on the dry side, but the special sauce gave it needed flavor. But I wasn't give my fries, and it finally caught the waiter's eye when she came to take my empty plate and saw my fries plate was missing. She was kind enough to give me an order of fries on the house, so props to her. For desert, I went with the fresh Vanilla bean cheesecake since I LOVE Vanilla. The Vanilla Cream with the texture of the pie crust plus the whipped cream - offered a delectable contrast. Overall, I was very happy with my desert. The food was good, but there's that one major problem that keeps overshadowing my experience here. That is the the poor service, the amount of time to get a table, and the amount of time we had to wait for our food. Honestly, I feel like the presentation and taste of the food keeps getting poorer and poorer with each visit, but the cheesecakes were good - which is one aspect of the dinner which I'm not complaining about. If there was another Cheesecake Factory nearby, I would go there, but because this is the nearest one to my house, I'm stuck with this one."
Angela S.,"Burlingame, CA",104,12,1,4.0,6/30/2017,"I really like this place. They're always very clean and they're very attentive, I think you just have to ask them if you want a certain type of service and the way you want it. In my experience here, if I asked the waitress or bartender for something specifically I've always gotten it. My friends haven't been as happy but that's the reason for my four stars. When you walk in the door you're seated immediately and the bar is nearly almost always open with seats if you just want appetizers. It's located right near the parking spots at the front of the mall, really convenient, really easy to get a quick (great) burger,  or appetizer, or, drink while watching the game at  the TV at the bar.  Four stars is only because my friends disagree with service,  but, they didn't ask for what they wanted, they just assumed. .... and after going with them and asking they now agree that the service is great. Just make sure you ask for what you want, they're very accommodating. Great food , great service great atmosphere for sure!"
Jen C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,75,,1.0,6/26/2017,I hate this place.  My son loves it.  We needed to buy him clothes so I figured I would feed him dinner before torturing him in Gap.  We were there early.  Seated immediately and then left for dead.  Not a single employee came to our table.  We waited 20 minutes.  At least 6 employees cruised by - ignoring us.  Pretending we weren't really there...  I don't know what was going on but the sad thing is I've experienced this before.  In this same restaurant.  What kind of idiot goes back to an establishment where she was ignored and expects the same thing to NOT happen again?  That idiot is me. After 20 minutes we got up and left.  I'm sure our menus are still sitting on the table where we left them and I'm pretty sure no one ever came by... Right now there are three places to eat at Hillsdale Mall.  Once that food court is open I hope The Cheesecake Factory will be a ghost town...  If you value your time don't waste it here.    Never again.
Simon C.,"San Francisco, CA",29,40,,3.0,3/2/2017,Came here for a going away dinner.  Pros:  Attentive and polite staff Easily accessible location in a suburban mall Not too busy on a Wednesday night Food is relatively cheap Cons: Nothing to write home about Food was ok Decor was ok Drinks are relatively expensive
Danika P.,"San Leandro, CA",364,329,1191,3.0,2/19/2017,"Loved the food, but service was terrible. First of all it was not busy at all and yet we had to wait for about 10 minutes until we were seated super secluded in the back. First our server started off good, but then it went bad. She ordered our appetizer and it came the same time as our main dish. We ordered the loaded bake potato bite and it never came. She came by to our table to tell us it's on the way over. As soon as she said that the manager came to our table to apologize and let us know that our order went to the wrong table. So to make up for it a slice of cheesecake was on the house. We figured that was so sweet and he mentioned our first order of appetizer would be removed from the check, but when we looked at our bill the check included the loaded baked potato which we never received. So we had to fix our check and it made it super inconvenient for us because we had to wait even longer for a fixed check. For a main dish i ordered the chicken and biscuit which was delicious and filling. I should mention the portion was huge. As for dessert I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake because it was finally in season and I loved it. I forgot what my cousins ordered, but we were pleased with our food. I don't think i'll come back to this location due to service, but I do recommend people who do live on this side of the bay to try it. Food portion is good and reasonably twice, but do order cheesecake!"
Manny G.,"Union City, CA",170,600,803,2.0,3/25/2017,"Compared to other locations this one fell short. The Service was slow, Food was ok. My father in law had the dry pork chop and Mother in law had the greasy fried prawns. My wife had a Great fried chicken sandwich and I had a over priced Brioche breakfast sandwich that was mediocre at best. Location is Great, next to shopping in a busy mall. My wife asked the server if they had a mousse cheesecake he said yes my wife then asked is that the only chocolate cheesecake and his reply was we also have lemon meringue. Im not sure if he was serious so we had a awkward pause, At least something fun came of the experience live and learn its all good.  Yes we did take a Chocolate Mousse cheese cake home."
Myrta H.,"Antioch, CA",3,26,19,1.0,8/6/2017,Table service was horrible - waited for a long time for beverages and even longer for food. Women's restroom as a disaster with no running water. Apparently the water had been shut off. Didn't realize a restaurant can stay open with no running water.
Liza W.,"Moss Beach, CA",82,212,81,3.0,2/3/2017,"According to the Yelp standards of what three stars mean, then, yes, The Cheesecake Factory at Hillsdale is ""A-OK"". I give this place a fairly decent review not because this is the most stellar place to have dinner (it is a chain restaurant of course), but because, where else can you bring a five year old for her birthday and get food she will actually eat at reasonable prices, in an atmosphere that is loud enough to drown out your kid's restaurant shenanigans, yet cozy and dimly lit enough to trick yourself into feeling like you are out to a ""fancy"" dinner? Why, that would be The Cheesecake Factory, at the mall. Yay, mall. Also, my child is head over heels for the Build-A-Bear a couple doors away, so she gets her annual birthday Build-A-Bear, and then we hop over to The Cheesecake Factory for a casual birthday dinner with new toy in tow. Happy Birthday to a little one! All of the above reasons are why there are multitudes of families waiting by the dozen to be seated at this restaurant on any given evening, especially on the weekends. The typical wait for the dinner-busy hour is around 20 minutes. Expect that, every time. It could be longer and it could be shorter, but don't hold your breath. I don't frequent here much, but when I have come here on occasion, the service has been mostly pretty decent. Tonight, on a Friday night that was extra busy, we lucked out with an excellent server. And it really is sheer luck. I eat from the Skinnylicious menu here. Let me tell you, the skinny menu is the saving grace of this place, otherwise you are eating a billion calories at a time. All of the entree choices on the skinny menu are 590 calories or less. They also have ""Skinnylicious"" drink choices which are 150 calories or less (so I always get the skinny Margarita on the rocks). From the skinny menu, I had the steak medallions which came with mashed potatoes (a very small portion!), asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and shiitake mushrooms. Oh my god! OH my god! I honestly could not believe how good this meal was. The steak was cooked to perfection. The marinated sauce on the mushrooms (which normally I dont like Shiitakes at all) and the lightly sauted tomatoes with asparagus was all so mouth wateringly delicious! Part of what keeps the calories down on the skinny menu are that the portions are normal sized, not hugely gigantic  like the portions on Cheescake's regular menu. I was so surprised at how good the medallions were that I kept announcing how good it was while I was eating it, hahaha. My daughter's bow tie pasta with fresh marinara was light, cooked perfectly and really tasty as well. The cheesecake was bypassed this time, because a very chocolate, chocolate birthday cake was waiting at home for my one-track minded newly-minted five year old! But, the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries is usually a favorite to share with the table (a couple bites is enough!). I can't eat all that crazy crazy sweet stuff they make the Cheesecakes into, but apparently that is what people love about this place.  Anyhow, if you come here, be prepared for longish waits, especially on the weekends. Don't arrive if your kids are already starving because they will be melting down by the time you get a seat and as all parents know, when that happens, you have hit that cranky button that is hard to turn off. If you accommodate this place and its long wait times, then you can make this place is an occasional go-to for families. It is decent enough."
Forever B.,"San Mateo, CA",3,22,25,4.0,4/7/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants. Great customer service & even greater food. Price $13-$25 plates but delicious & well prepared. However, Bc it's located in a mall, the wait is long about 30-50 mins wait, more so on the weekends! & you can only reserve for a party   But food is great so it was worth the wait.  I recommend for appetizer, the fried macaroni balls and avocado rolls"
Sandy D.,"Pacifica, CA",59,28,,3.0,9/8/2017,Yummy food but so greasy. The restaurant is sometimes dirty and the bussers use dirty towels to wipe the tables. Waiters and staff are friendly.
Gary C.,"Foster City, CA",61,26,16,1.0,1/29/2017,"Long waits to be seated despite it being a large establishment, and waiters are scarce and need to be actively hunted down for attention. The complimentary brown bread is incredibly delicious and possibly the best thing about eating here. We asked three times for a napkin, and eventually gave up on our waiter and got response from a very polite table busboy... as I write this, our aloof waiter came by to drop off napkins about 25 min after we requested. Food: 3 stars Cheesecake: no idea - it contains gelatin (usually pork) and is thus not suitable for a large number of dietary choices Service: abysmal Update: food arrived and it was the wrong dish. Ordered Thai lettuce wraps and received lettuce tacos. Had another server correct it since our waiter wasn't around... he came by 5 min later to say he entered it into the system incorrectly... at least he owned his mistake, but it's just another in a long list of avoidable issues."
Thays V.,"San Mateo, CA",33,7,17,5.0,5/3/2017,"This si not my first time here but is the first time to I want to write about... Was just simple and excellent. I have gestational diabetes and is really hard for me find some good cóctel with no sugar... because I like sweet cócteles, but AMANDA take care of us and she completely understand my situation and she make a special cóctel with Splenda and non alcohol... was just great, with a beauty decoration make me feel like I have an original cóctel... and the crab bite was spectacular with it, just for take something simple and fresh... Thanks so much!"
Jessica J.,"Union City, CA",222,128,50,2.0,1/9/2017,"I come here occasionally because of its convenient location (in Hillsdale Mall)... but beware, there can be long wait times on weekends.  The food is okay. It's the typical American fare, nothing spectacular. They have a pretty large menu with an assortment of different foods - salad, tacos, burgers, pasta, etc. Kind of like a BJ's but replace the pazookies with cheesecake.  They have a good selection if you're trying to accommodate a big group with varying tastes. The main caveat of this is the whole ""jack of all trades, master of none""  cliché. Nothing is particularly tasty, though nothing is really bad either. Just OK food.  Unfortunately almost every time I've ordered pasta, the noodles come out lukewarm or cold. Why?? Pasta is not a hard dish to make. Come on.  The wait for our food to come out is also ridiculous, and the service is often inattentive. We'll sometimes need to ask 3 times just to get one thing.  So meh food. Meh service."
