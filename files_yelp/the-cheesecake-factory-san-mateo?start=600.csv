Abigail D.,"San Francisco, CA",470,185,59,4.0,3/16/2013,"Update #2: This was my first time ordering takeout/curbside to-go and everything went really smoothly. Took about 15mins. Not long at all. I only ordered appetizers/small plates so that might be a factor but nonetheless is was pretty much hassle free.  I found more go-to items to order. For all you calories counters, the skinnylicious salmon rolls are delicious! Comes with 4 long skinny rolls and two different dipping sauces, both of which are so flavorful. Total thumbs up! And for all you crab lovers, I can absolutely vouch for their amazing crabcakes! Jam packed with so much meat. Most crab cakes I've had contain a lot of breading so the crab taste is far gone. But these, although small/medium in size, are full of meat. Their mustard and tartar sauces are awesome too, but I definitely prefer the tartar. Only gripe is that it comes with 3 cakes. I'd prefer 4 so it's easier to share if you're eating with someone. But other than that, it's worth the $13."
Snowbell S.,"Daly City, CA",1,12,3,4.0,9/12/2013,"Service: ""Erik"" was very attentive and suggesting good foods. Which is a plus for us.  Food: Jambalaya noodles with shrimp and chicken, never ever disappoint my taste buds. Chicken is so tender it's melting on your mouth! YuM!  Down part  is our table location: my husband is facing the big bright wall outside and it's bothering his eyesight. TOO bright! Very disturbing. I'm planning to change table but as we can see all tables on that floor is affected by that brightness."
Sunny P.,"San Francisco, CA",396,39,38,1.0,8/20/2014,"Came in here to get a quick cheese cake togo. It took about 20 minutes to get... that was fine. Slow, but okay. However the worst part was the girl prepping and getting the cheesecake dropped one, breaking the plate and dropping the cake knife on the floor. She looked around and picked up the knife and put it back to be reused right away! Disgusting."
Kim R.,"Pacifica, CA",54,9,,5.0,12/17/2012,"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess station was great--we were told it would be ten minutes to be seated, but it took less time than that.  And this was at LUNCHTIME on a Christmas-shopping Saturday at the mall!  Kathleen was our server--she was the BEST!  Busy as she was, she took the time to be certain that my husband and I were well taken care of.  We were provided with prompt service, a bread basket, refills on our beverages, and of course our entrees in a very timely manner. We couldn't resist dessert--if you love chocolate, then this is your place, because there are so many options to choose from! We couldn't help but notice how EVERYONE working there was hustling.  Servers, busers, cooks, chefs, hosts, hostesses, dishwashers, I'm sure I'm leaving someone out, but I certainly didn't see any slouches.  Kudos! Of course it goes without saying that our food was excellent.  And if you can't find something you like on this immense menu, then you just aren't trying!"
Zaireen H.,"San Bruno, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/12/2014,I love the food here! My fav appetizer is the fried mac and cheese! There cheesecake is to die for! Staff is great there! Best place to kick it with your girlfriends! :)
Ren K.,"South San Francisco, CA",89,6,1,1.0,11/7/2015,"We had the most horrible experience with bad service & bad food! Our waitress, Amanda had the worst attitude, very rude service. We requested well done burgers and our burger was not well done when it arrived. We cancelled that order and got Shrimp Scampi instead since we waited half hour for that burger that wasn't even cooked well. When the Shrimp Scampi arrived, it was smothered with so much butter the grease was oozing out of the pasta. A heart attack waiting to happen. We called our waitress, Amanda to let her know and her response, ""oh it's supposed to be like that, it's cooked in butter!"" Wrong answer Amanda!!! That place needs to train their cooks to serve quality foods and train their waiters & waitresses to have a friendly customer service approach and learn to apologize to their customers when they are unsatisfied with their product. We requested to speak with the Restaurant Manager but he never showed up. We are very disappointed with their service and food quality. No stars for this establishment!"
Christy L.,"San Francisco, CA",289,741,33,3.0,6/20/2012,"Cheesecake Factory - contributing to the growing waistband of America...now in a neighborhood near you! What can one say about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? Okay, I'll take a shot: They are now offering a new ""skinny"" selections menu...that was nice of them (guess I better scratch that first comment...) - their service was pretty decent when we went in - their tropical iced tea is pretty awesome... The rest has already been said. Skip the fish tacos - WAAAYYYYY too salty for my taste. If you order any of the salads, you might want to ask for the dressing on the side - they seem to be heavy handed. The banana cheesecake is pretty yum...wasn't too thrilled with the Red Velvet. Great for groups, picky dads and when you're on a binge!"
Desmond C.,"San Mateo, CA",80,160,3,1.0,3/29/2012,"Avoid this place! (Unless the only thing you're getting is the cheesecake). WARNING #1: You'll get better service at McDonald's. WARNING #2: You're server might introduce themselves and never come back to serve you! And they'll oddly come back at the end of the night to see how you're doing. AWKWARD! CLEANLINESS: 2/5 SERVICE: 0/5 (My first 0.) FOOD: 3/5 - BBQ/Ranch Chicken Salad OH BOY, where do I even start? I'm not a big fan of giving bad reviews, but this location left me no choice. Let's start with the cleanliness of this place. The decor and atmosphere looks really nice, I'll give them that. However, it bothers me that the utensils are placed DIRECTLY on the dirty table and NOT wrapped in a towel like most restaurants. You've seen waiters wipe those tables... if you even call it wiping. Service is TERRIBLE. Probably the worst I have ever gotten from a restaurant in my entire life. Once we got seated, we weren't given the towel napkins and the complimentary bread wasn't served. Then we got our order in. Still no napkins and bread. 30-40 minutes went by and now we're wondering where our waitress had gone. We look over at tables that got seated after us and they already got their bread and food! Still no sign of our waitress. Then another waitress sees us looking around really hard to find someone, and she kindly asks us if we needed help. She immediately notices that we weren't given bread or any napkins. (She saved our day. Thank you!). Here's a snippet of our dialog: Me: Uhm, do you know what happened to our waitress? Waitress #2: Uh, I'm not sure, but let me get you guys some bread. Me: Wait, is she even still here? Waitress #2: I think so, she might be on her break. Me: Oh, okay... Thanks. So, apparently Waitress #1 went on her break without us even knowing. So Waitress #2 notices that we already received poor service (or LACK OF SERVICE), and she immediately gives our table a little more attention. Thank you, again! Now, an hour as passed and finally our food gets to our table. Oh, but wait. THEY FORGOT MY ORDER. Waitress #2 notices that everyone at our table got their dishes except me. She literally said, ""Wait, you're food didn't come yet? That's crazy, you ordered a salad."" (Or something along those lines). I believe she told the manager about the service we've been receiving because he comes over about 10 minutes later with my salad and apologizes. Here's our dialog: Manager: I'm so sorry. We'll take the salad off the bill.  Me: Uh, what's the name of the first waitress? (He didn't say.) Did she just leave because the last time I saw her was 45 minutes ago. Manager: We're required to give our employees a break after 5 hours of work. OKAY. Where do I even start? I didn't ask for you to tell me your company policy on how you treat your employees. At most restaurants, whenever the waiter/waitresses are covering for one another, they come up to the customer and literally tell them that they have a new server for the evening. (THEY DID NOT DO THIS.) Hell, Waitress #2 didn't even know Waitress #1 went on a break! Thank god Waitress #2 saw us looking for some service or else we would of just walked out. We finally get to eat our food (which was mediocre).  Now the most awkward thing happens. WAITRESS #1 MAGICALLY SHOWS UP AT OUR TABLE! Oh god, I don't know what to do with myself. I really wanted to just yell at her, but the whole situation was so awkward. The Cheesecake factory must treat their employees poorly because Waitress #1 had enough time to abandon their customer and then show up towards the end of the night to TRY to service us. Keyword: TRY. Sorry, you failed completely.  I do give kudos to Waitress #2 for saving the night. Also, kudos to the Manager for taking 2 dishes off the bill. Oh, and did I mention it was my brothers birthday? Yeah, happy birthday to him. FAIL. My brother did get a complimentary cheesecake for his b-day. The manager offered cheesecake all around, but we didn't take the offer because it would of probably arrived at the time the restaurant closed. Or they might of forgotten our order. (The place wasn't even busy!) FAIL FAIL FAIL. It was also our first time at this location (probably our last). Maybe I'll come back after a couple years if this location is still here. Hopefully they'll have new employees by then. You'll probably get better service at McDonald's."
Jerri L.,"Burlingame, CA",48,21,14,1.0,2/27/2014,"Super unprofessional and extremely unacceptable. Called a week before my boss's birthday to inquire about reservations because this was my first time making a reservation. They told me that they do not do reservations, which is understandable. I asked them how would I go about fitting in a party of 18 people. The hostess or whoever answered the phone told me to come an hour before our scheduled dinner for somebody to put our name and number on the list and they will give us a call when our table is ready. I was pleased and a little relieved that we wouldn't have to wait so long if we all went in a bunch.. So I emailed 18 of my coworkers and told them dinner is at 7 p.m.. One of my coworkers was nice enough to head to the Cheesecake Factory to put our name on the list an hour and a half before 7 p.m.. The hostess was extremely rude and told her  ""that's impossible, your table will not be ready until 830 or 845"" My coworker was stunned because that wasn't the plan. She panicked and did not know what to do. Being an assistant manager at an establishment that strives for customer service, this was extremely unacceptable and beyond unprofessional. I was appalled. I had 18 people heading to this restaurant for a big surprise dinner for my boss and this is what happens and this is how they treat us? I immediately called The Cheesecake Factory and ask to speak to the manager to see what was the problem. Patrick, the manager told me in the most condescending tone that the hostess never said. And that he wasn't going to do anything about it and that we would have to wait until 845.  Really??? I was extremely pissed off. I rerouted 18 of my coworkers to a much better restaurant which was Elephant Bar in Burlingame. Not only were they able to fit us in but treated us with amazing customer service and the food was beyond tasty. My boss and my coworkers ended up enjoying our dinner. Its either they change their stupid no reservation policy. Or get rid of all their ignorant self-centered staff especially the manager and hire new people who actually has knowledge in customer service. And treats paying customers the way they actually should be treated.. Never ever coming here again."
Lauren P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,18,,4.0,5/12/2014,"We came in for dinner and were promptly sat. Our server was patient as we took our time ordering off the large menu. If I was rating this based on good, it would be 3 stars or less. The food just wasn't good. It came our incorrectly twice and overlooked twice. However, the service was phenomenal. Our server Allie (Ally?) was attentive, really patient, apologetic, and really made sure that we felt taken care of. It was great. Then we spoke with the manager working (Patrick) and he was so sincere and just wonderful! It changed our entire night and we really appreciated it. Will definitely give the food another chance because of how great the service was"
Jason W.,"San Mateo, CA",107,358,7,4.0,6/2/2012,"Y'know how you can tell the service is great at any restaurant? Sit down with a table of older, non-native English speakers! Today I had lunch with my mother-in-law, aunt, and a bunch of their friends. They're all really sweet ladies, but their grasp of the English language ranges from great to spotty and everything in-between! This Cheesecake Factory is much the same as any location in the chain. Large, spacious, clean, and well-staffed. They must have had like six people waiting up at the front to greet people. We had a party of 14 which they had no problem accommodating. I got the turkey burger with a side salad instead of fries (trying to watch my girlish figure). The burger was huge and the patty was really tasty and looked like it was hand crafted instead of pulled out of a CostCo bag. It came with some yummy grilled onions and a big slice of fresh tomato. The side salad was a basic mix of greens, tomato, and cucumber with a light vinegar dressing. Throughout the meal, the staff kept our drinks full, our plates cleared, and patiently took care of requests that weren't stated in clear English. All the ladies were really happy! On the way out, I grabbed a slice of red velvet cheesecake for my wife who couldn't make it to lunch.  I'd definitely come here again!"
Tami S.,"San Mateo, CA",162,474,156,3.0,7/2/2012,"I had been a little apprehensive to eat here... not sure why. Maybe it's the rumors of the ENORMOUS portions, the tales of lengthy waits for a table, and the impression I had that everything was a calorie-fest. But no fear, we were seated right away, service was efficient and friendly, and everything was good. Had a nice Sunday lunch here with friends, and enjoyed sitting on the ""patio"" (which is actually inside the mall).  LOTS of choices -- I can't imagine someone looking through the novel that is the Cheesecake Factory menu and saying ""nope, nothing I want to eat here."" They have just about every taste covered, from herculean salads, to burgers and sandwiches, to seriously substantial meals that probably throw the Weight Watchers point system into overtime. Come here on a Sunday afternoon and you'll also find a special brunch menu. If all that sounds overwhelming to your waistline, the array of selections on the light ""SkinnyLicious Menu"" is pretty decent, too. I ate a salad from that section of the menu and -- while I initially had to go hunting for the chicken in my tortilla salad -- by the end of the meal, I was sated.  Beverage wise, you'll find just about anything you want. I was really happy with my iced tea. They have three kinds: black, green, and tropical. I tried the green tea, and it was a very pleasant, light flavor, with a hint of mint. Really nice and refreshing. This may sound goofy, but it was a surprise highlight of the meal. I've had the cheesecake before, and yes, it's good. There are about 300 choices on the menu, give or take. So, again -- unless you seriously can't stand (or can't eat) cheesecake, surely you will find *some* option to make your whole party happy.  Long story short -- if you're at the mall and hungry, or if your friends are really eager to eat here, don't worry. You will find *something,* if not many things, you'd like on the menu. Enjoy your time in La Palais de Cheesecake."
Norman S.,"San Jose, CA",73,402,445,3.0,7/1/2012,"Ah, CF, with the ever present lines for dinner. The only times to come to CF and not have to deal with lines is lunch. The only other time I went to CF for dinner with no line was at the Las Vegas location but I suppose we got lucky that time. As with all CFs, this one has high ceilings and feels huge inside. We got to our tables with zero wait and Service was super prompt and friendly. Typical of chain restaurants, the menu is just overwhelming in it's choice. There are 12 salads to choose from...12! Fortunately, they had my favorite Fish and Chips. Boring you say? Hey, good Fish and Chips are difficult to make. I order it as a Lunch Favorite, meaning a smaller portion compared to the regular Fish and Chips. That's good since (1) it's cheaper at $11.50 and (2) it's not crazy huge requiring a gathering of friends and family to finish. So how good are CF's Fish and Chips? Good, 3-stars good. Not comparable to what I had in the U.K. or Australia but still nicely done. Fish wasn't over-battered, greasy, salty or over-cooked. Just nice flaky morsels of fresh fish coated in crispy batter. Like-wise for the chips. They also had a side of Cole Slaw - julienned cabbage served on a slice of lettuce - had a nice crunch. Oh, mustn't forget the Tartar Sauce which was nice and tangy with chunks of pickles. Didn't go for the Cheesecakes this time but based on past experience, they're a winner - 4 stars. CF generally has good food and service but just not good enough to justify the crazy long lines and waits for dinner."
Marina S.,"Carpinteria, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Poorly managed restaurant!  Arrived at 640 on a Sunday night and was told there would be a 40 minute wait.  After an hour, I finally asked the bartender why there were so many open tables and he said they were short on silverware.  I asked the hostess when we would be seated and she said in a few minutes.  Ten minutes later the bartender took things into his own hands and sat us. The place was half full!  We were seated at  750 and finally got our food (which was tasty) at 830."
Nicole O.,"San Jose, CA",28,32,37,5.0,7/6/2014,"Short & Sweet. Always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Came in Late the other night and was starved since I had just sat in Traffic in SF for like 3 Hours. Luckily our server happily took our table even though they were almost closed. Had The White Sangria( One of My Fav's Here) Delicious. & Friend had Typhoon Mixed Drink (dont recall exact name) Which also was yummy..Had Ahi app which was good and Pasta. Overall our Server- Brandon was great! Sweet, Attentive and on top of everything! Would go back to this location and specifically sit in his section since I know we would be well taken care of..."
Yas B.,"Los Altos, CA",0,15,1,5.0,10/28/2014,THESE STARS ARE ONLY FOR JUSTIN THE BARTENDER!!!  amazing guy. always have a good time when hes in there. you can see him talking to the customers and laughing.  gets our food on time and is great on checking up on you. wish more servers were like him
Daniel C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,5,,3.0,10/25/2015,"Only been a few times, but never had the most decent experience.  Always long waits for some reason 1.5 to 2 hours); one time while waiting more than an hour for a table, we walked around the mall to kill time, then got a call and were asked to come back and get our table within 10 min before they would give it away to another group; we made it back in 5 min and the manager had already given it away.  We had to wait another 20 min to get another table due to this incompetent manager.  Food was good, but newbie waiters kept bringing us other other tables' dishes (poor waiter management) but at least our food was not given away.  I'd only go back if it was just my wife and I, or if a group pre-chose this place for a birthday or other engagement."
Chary P.,"San Carlos, CA",31,59,20,4.0,6/25/2014,"Always good.  Found out today their nutritional guide shows ""n/a"" for fat, carbs and protein.  Really???"
Bobbie Kaye B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,10,,2.0,7/5/2012,"We've eaten here twice, and both times I was disappointed. First, they give you impossibly huge portions, and then charge you for it. I wish they had smaller meals. I made three meals out of my last order. My boyfriend had some kind of club sandwich, and it was mostly tomatoes. Thick slices of tomato made the sandwich look, well, thick. But he doesn't like tomatoes, pulled them out, and left almost nothing behind. The place is very noisy, too. Our server was very good, and she tried her best. The hostess could use some lessons in friendliness, though. My fish and chips was good, but as I said, I wish I could order half the amount of food for half the cost."
Kari M.,"San Jose, CA",602,597,196,3.0,2/16/2012,"Came here for dinner last week with a friend. She arrived around 6pm and managed to grab a table at the bar. Thank goodness! It was SUPER busy. As the Cheesecake Factory usually is. Especially when it's in a mall. :( Pretty much immediately after I sat down, our waitress came over and took our orders and brought out some bread with butter. I absolutely LOVE their molasses bread. So Freaking Good! It took awhile to get the entrees, though I ordered 2 appetizers, so maybe that makes a difference. Edamame and Ahi Tartar. The edamame was nothing to right home about. It was decent. The Ahi was incredibly good. Crisp chips were perfect to scoop up yummy bites.  My friend had one of their Crazy-ass huge salads. These people don't mess around with their salads, which is probably why they're all over 1000 calories. Come on, can't you do HALF of that!!?? Seems a little ridiculous to me, but I guess people want their money's worth. We got the check in an orderly fashion and they gave my friend a box to take home the other half of her salad.  Overall, OK. It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's OK food, with OK customer service. What more do you want from a chain?"
