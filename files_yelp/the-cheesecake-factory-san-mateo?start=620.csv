Simon A.,"San Mateo, CA",2,3,4,4.0,9/2/2015,"Very nice place. Food is really good and cheesecake amazing. But service is slow, bad.  I recommend this place for the food not for the service."
Joanna F.,"San Mateo, CA",8,37,,3.0,7/26/2014,"So, this is typical Cheesecake Factory. Food is pretty good, service is pretty good, overall reliable spot. They would've gotten 4 stars, but we had a not-so-great curbside delivery experience. Just be prepared to walk in and get your food."
Michael L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",147,478,333,4.0,10/16/2012,Meh! It's like every other Cheesecake Factory AKA a 1 up high school cafeteria.  +1 star for the booze though.
natalie g.,"Pacifica, CA",1,14,,3.0,9/29/2014,"Well, I always sit down with intent of 5 stars but then the service happens.  I asked for a Bellini and apparently the full bar can't do that. They do have a Bellini drink but somehow can't leave out the peach flavored alcohol and leave in the peach syrup and champagne. OK, I guess!? Amanda, in the beginning, seemed fine. I don't like my cheesecake as cold as it is when it comes straight from the cooler. So I ordered my slice at the same time I ordered my lunch and Amanda looked at me like I asked her to throw a box full of puppies off a bridge. When my cousin ordered her tea the mugs came dirty. My cousin asked for a clean glass and Amanda responded, ""Just a second please. I am a little behind."" Somehow that was our responsibility!?!?  Then we got Jose. He... Was... Great!!! Patient, smiled genuinely, and seemed to be happy to do his job.  I will be back because, let's face it, this place is pretty tasty so the 3 stars are for the visit."
Marisol C.,"Pittsburg, CA",46,2,,1.0,11/3/2014,Horrible service. Went on a Monday evening... Waited 30 minutes to be seated. A party of 9 only 3 ordered (mostly small plates) as we originally only went for dessert. 50 minutes passed by after that and the food was STILL not out. Other tables around us with guest that had gotten there after us received their food. We got up and left. It was truly disappointing.
Beth W.,"Clovis, CA",1,21,6,2.0,10/25/2015,"Only had a 15 min wait so that was ok...then got seated in a surprisingly uncrowded resturant.  Waiter was great, food not so much!  Dry, bland, overcooked, and for some reason the syrup was unbelievably SWEET!!  We have eaten very often at Cheesecake Factories around the state and have aways had great meals and service...until this one at this San Mateo location.  2 stars because of great servers.  Breakfast was mundane, dry, tasteless.  (Watch out for that syrup too...ugh)"
Michele G.,"San Mateo, CA",0,39,,2.0,10/25/2015,"Disappointed today.  Ordered orange chicken to go.  Very dry chicken - the orange sauce was just a tiny drizzle, and I mean tiny.  Couldn't taste the orange sauce at all...most of the chicken was deep fried dry - yuck."
Linzi E.,"San Carlos, CA",1,38,42,2.0,7/10/2014,"What can I say...this place is a dump!! Walked in immediately got a table with my friend, but they sat us right were the wall is...umm that was okay but c'mon... Next we ordered the hot artichoke and spinach dip, came at a reasonably time, grab some chips and starting dipping, unfortunately the dip was completely tasteless. My friend then tried to make it better by adding salt...better?? I think not! So we had no choice but to say something, feeling a bit bad for sending it back. But our waiter was very understanding...and he spilled to us that the dip is sent back all the time...long story short food is pretty much the worst!"
Jon N.,"San Mateo, CA",122,4,1,1.0,1/10/2012,"Go there to have a nice Chinese chicken salad to find a chipped piece of a ceramic plate in my food.  The manager comes over to apologize and offer something else to eat. I politely ask for another salad and say its okay for the other tainted salad.  As she bring the next salad to me, our waitress finally brings over our bread that was supposed to come out 10 minutes earlier.  Finally I get the bill and see that my salad had still been charged. The service at this cheesecake factory was definitely not satisfactory.  If I had a customer find a chipped plate in my food, I would do everything to make sure they are accommodated and that their food will be taken care of by the restaurant or even in this case, a free cheesecake.  I will always think about this awful service as well as the chipped plate in my food when going back to cheesecake factory if I even decide to go back at all."
Ju D.,Bay Area,6,199,89,5.0,11/18/2012,"come early, bit wait already at 5:30pm on a saturday night.  excellent dish choices. has the crab/artichoke dip that comes with toasted bread (not much crab taste). salmon salad was excellent.  its a big fillet of salmon (ask for it to get heated as it comes cold) with great side of vinegrette salad.  the steak (that had the carmelized onion, bean sprouts, wasabi mash) was supurb!!!"
Julie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",206,127,47,3.0,6/18/2012,"It's the Cheesecake Factory so I didn't go with high expectations. I had the Miso Salmon lunch special which wasn't bad. decent sauce and the salmon was not remarkable but it was decent. The regular entrees aren't worth the cost or the calories, but their small bites menu and lunch specials are worth it."
Ailly M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/14/2015,So my wife and I just ate at the cheesecake factory our server was Samantha she seemed pleasant at first I had to ask her for our free bread! When she finally arrived with our bread basket it looked as though she had brought it from another table from customer s who hadn't finished there bread it looked thrown together. Also mind you we are two married women I strongly sensed homophobia from this girl.when she was servicing a heterosexual couple she was telling them to let her know if they needed anything else and if they had any questions. Not once did she give us that treatment. She was superficial in her service. No sincerity at all! This is the first and last time my wife and I will be dining at this cheesecake factory. As for the one in downtown Palo alto quick and efficient service. We normally tip very well but for her service she didnt get what she thought she had coming. I do not recommend lgbt couples to go and dine at the cheesecake factory and steer clear from Samantha!
Chris C.,"Redwood City, CA",36,181,357,2.0,5/5/2012,Seating wench lied to us about available seating.  They are there for looks and just to pass the time.  Who the Hell is running this place?  Its far from the experience we had in PaloAlto.  Female staff up front are very aloof.   Food came out fairly quickly.  Pasta for kids was under cooked but palatable. Dirty glassware abounds. Get a straw if u can.
Mark B.,"Lake Forest, CA",52,16,36,4.0,9/1/2014,"Clean, good quality food and service. Pretty much what I expect in a Cheesecake Factory."
JP O.,"San Jose, CA",4,14,,4.0,7/9/2012,"I guess timing is everything.  This is my 2nd trip to the Hillsdale CF and each time both the food and the service has been really good. Both times - we ate late afternoon / early evening - so not crowded.  Each time - got seated promptly. My girlfriends had Angel Hair pasta with a red meat sauce and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I asked about their meals - both said really good as they finished their meals.  Only about 1/3 of the pasta left - a nice light lunch for the next day. I had the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas.  First - lets talk Corn Cakes - I don't know what to say about these except:  yummy.   I let my girlfriends try them - yummy.  The Stuffed Chicken Tortillas - just as good as expected - the cheese, the sauce, the spiciness, the chicken - just right. We then each ordered a slice of cheesecake - I had the kahlua chocolate cheese cake.   We each finished about half - took the rest home :) The service - very attentive:  took our orders promptly, answered questions about the menu, one of my girlfirends essentially created her own pasta combination - angel hair pasta with a red meat sauce - no problem - handled with a smile.   I have to say for a chain - the cheesecake factory almost always delivers.  You know what to expect - and you get it.  Huge portions, good food - not necessarily spectacular but really good. Can the atmospher be loud - OH yes - sometimes this place is really really crowded.  But it has a good positive energy."
Andrew M.,"San Carlos, CA",112,65,3,3.0,6/16/2012,"For the money, the Cheesecake Factory offers up decent food and decent service, but neither are just consistent.  Whenever I go into the place, I never know what kind of experience I am going to have. I've had a good experience and I have had one so bad that the manager (who did the right thing in this situation) not only comped our meal but sent us home with a few pieces of chessecake.   I think my biggest gripe about TCF is that for a ""kid friendly"" restaurant (they have a kids menu), they consistently send the food out from the kitchen WAY too hot.  This time, we ordered the little one chicken tenders with fries and the food was so hot that it was scalding to both my wife and I....and the waitress put the food right in front of her.  Luckily I grabbed the food to check the heat, something parents should always do with a toddler, and realize how hot it was, whisking it away from in front of her."
Mariya C.,"Belmont, CA",199,7,3,1.0,8/30/2014,"Poor service. They don't take reservation & the service is awful. Waited over 2 hours for a table because they ""couldn't"" kick the people out who were just sitting & waiting. We had a party of 12 & they couldn't put a few tables together for us so that we wouldn't have to wait for 2 hours? Ridiculous."
Kat W.,"Millbrae, CA",85,77,3,3.0,1/2/2012,"The food was a little too salty but it was still good and reasonably priced, granted we went at lunch time. The food was alright but I did enjoy their lemon rasberry cheesecake because it wasn't too sweet, thick, or overly rich. The servers were considerate and nice about giving us lots of time to go through their extensive menu.  Even though nothing was particularly amazing to me it had a nice atmosphere, though a bit loud, and it was easily accessible for me. So it's a good hangout for a small group and maybe I'll be back for a happy hour."
Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,11/9/2011,"Well, it's about time the Mid-Peninsula has a Cheesecake Factory.  No longer will CF fans have to drive up to San Francisco, Palo Alto, or Santa Clara to fulfill their avocado egg roll, Navajo Sandwich, or their Snicker's Cheesecake cravings. Like all CF's, we expected a long wait, especially on a weekend of its first opening.  We put our name down, given a pager () and were told the wait was 45 minutes.  We were in no rush, so we waited.  At the end of 45 minutes, our pager went off, and we were seated. On this particular weekend, the number of waitstaff was larger than normal.  Some of the experienced staff from the other CF locations were deck helping out the new San Mateo staff.  Our waiter was a young man, very nervous, but personable, energetic, and very attentive. After we placed our orders, we were given the usual baskets of bread. The kids ate the white bread, leaving the whole grain loaves for my wife and I.  The food took a while to come out, but our waiter kept our bread baskets and drinks full. Finally, our orders were ready: -Stuffed Mushrooms: stuffed with fontina and parmesan Cheese, garlic and herbs.  Not bad. -Kid's Penne with Butter and Cheese. Generous portion for a kids item. -Luau Salad: Salad layered with chicken breast, salad greens, cucumbers, green onions, peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and fried won ton sheets,with macadamia nuts and sesame seeds.  Basically a big, spectacular salad, what my wife usually orders. -Four Cheese Pasta: Split order for my oldest daughter and her friend.  Also a huge portion.  Penne, with mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan cheeses, and marinara sauce. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: Shrimp and chicken, peppers, onions in a spicy sauce. Everything we ordered was what we expected from a CF restaurant.  Pretty consistent in quality and taste. The wait for a table and food was long, but that was to be expected.  The service was great. We were too full for cheesecake for dessert, but being in the neighborhood, I'm sure I'll make sure I'll get a slice for two the next time."
Christine S.,"San Mateo, CA",45,15,4,5.0,8/30/2014,"So, I've been to this particular location three times already and have been super happy each time.  I even went during happy hour and was super impressed by the service! OMG! Their Service is amazing! I've always had attentive and friendly servers. The food is always delicious! I've tried the pizza, teriyaki chicken, mini corn dogs, stuffed tater tots and their clam chowder. Every single one of those items is beyond yummy. Their typhoon punch is so bomb! Finally, their cheesecakes, oh me, oh my, superb. Their strawberry cheesecake, perfection of course. Today I tried their banana one and I must say, it's giving the strawberry cheesecake a run for its money! It is a bit pricey but the portions are huge! My sister and I shared food and still brought home leftovers. Come hungry!"
