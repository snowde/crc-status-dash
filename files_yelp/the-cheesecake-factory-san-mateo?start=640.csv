Mark K.,"San Mateo, CA",176,55,49,5.0,5/24/2015,"My cousin and I came down for Sunday brunch, and it was definitely a good idea. Of course our eyes were always bigger than our stomachs, and we forgot that the portions are more than enough to feed your average family of four. We still think, ""Eh, f*ck it!"" We opted for the Monte Cristos for our entrée, and it's a definitely go to sandwich if you're feeling naughty. We also shared the warm crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer. Yeah yeah we know you're thinking, ""What the actual f*ck is wrong with you two?! That plus a brunch item?!"" Well we didn't give a crap, and yes we asked for more bread, so carb on!! We had a very delicious experience, and we now sit at home regretting every caloric decision we made, but it was worth it! Our server Justin, was very attentive, friendly, and we both agreed that he was very, very cute lol. To make CCF happy, yes he did offer us cheesecake, but we politely declined (I apologize for calling you crazy hahaha). After all we ate, my personal trainer will kill me. I wanted to leave a bigger tip, but we didn't know where you went or if you got phased or on break lol. :( Overall great experience, guest satisfaction was achieved, and we will definitely be returning! :)"
Kathryn S.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/30/2014,"One star because zero stars isn't an option. Incompetent servers, a 45 minute wait after ordering to get cold food, one meal that wasn't served until after the rest of the party was done eating, a manager who didn't actually listen to any complaints, and to top it off, a half hour wait to get the check so we could leave. The worst restaurant experience I've had in years."
Susan D.,"San Francisco, CA",80,70,36,5.0,1/30/2013,"Excellent!! Fast, courteous service, Good prices for the portion sizes. We have another meal leftover for each of us. Yummm!!"
Urueta G.,"Belmont, CA",557,11,,1.0,9/24/2014,Bartenders on wed night sept 24 2014 ... Horrible service sat there for almost 1/2 hour and neither one took my order .. Instead they took people with drink orders ... Looks like Cheesecake Factory is lowering their standards ... So long Cheesecake Factory
Lynda M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,35,24,4.0,6/10/2015,Like this place a lot. The usual food but amazing mac n cheese balls. Great service always. Just Good Ole cheese cake fun!
Dina V.,"San Francisco, CA",101,414,446,3.0,1/6/2012,"It's great that there's one down the peninsula now and closer than Palo Alto, even better that it's at Hillsdale. It was just okay. It's a ""new"" restaurant for the area, so the wait was horrendous, but we waited, an hour. It's dark in there, but aren't they all. Food is the same. Ambiance all the same.  I'm wondering how long the novelty will wear off and if the wait times will be more reasonable? It beats having to pay for parking downtown SF, so more than likely this will be our go to CF. One small gripe, when we ordered our cheesecakes to go there were quite a few already off the menu b/c they ran out. This is the Cheesecake Factory is it not? I understand there aren't people in the back cranking out cheesecakes up the yin yang, but I know that ish is in your freezer back there. Get someone to crawl their ass in the freezer and get me the flavor that i want. I actually like my cheesecake firm and cold with a little freeze to it anyhow."
michele k.,"San Francisco, CA",39,95,10,3.0,3/18/2012,"I'm a valley girl, so I can't help my love for chains.  It's just that living in San Francisco everyone is so snotty and anti-chain.  I consider cheesecake factory to be on the top of the chain hierarchy, so it's been a little easier to convince others to join me.   This place is 10 miles away from work, but due to the lack of SSF restaurants I convinced my team to join me... well, that and the fact that I was going to expense it.   The food was good as always.  We had the... -sweet corn tamale cakes (yummy) -Renee's special (soup, salad, sandwich) -salmon  -chicken piccata -Cali omelette  And to top it off the ultimate red velvet cheesecake!  I don't even like cheesecake, so I only had the red velvet cake part which was amazing! I will definitely keep on suggesting this place for work lunches, but the service was very slow.  They sat us immediately bc the place was huge, but there was a 10 minute gap in between 1/2 of our orders, I only got one soda refill, and I had to hunt down someone to pay for the bill."
Johanah I.,"South San Francisco, CA",112,107,53,4.0,4/14/2012,"I have heard a lot of negative reviews about this place, but it wasn`t as bad as people say. Like I said about the S.F. Cheesecake Factory, the food portions are huge. My friend ordered nachos as a appetizer for us, but we still have a lot left over. This time I ordered the ""Bar-B-Que Salmon"" and that was very good! it`s salmon glazed in BBQ sauce, served with mashed potatoes, corn succotash, & onion rings. The order was fresh and hot, the salmon was cooked perfectly with the BBQ sauce, the mashes potatoes along with the corn were really good, and the onion rings was a nice touch to it. Of course I would never leave the Cheesecake Factory without a cheesecake! I ordered the Tiramitsu! One thing that bothered me, was that I ordered a spiked strawberry milkshake (a milkshake with alcohol in it) & the alcohol was very strong. I continued to drink it, just because one shake is $13 so I might as well drink most of it, but it was kind of hard to do, it just tasted like a regular strawberry shake except its REALLY bitter, ugh. Besides that, I have no complaints about this restaurant, the service was nice and attentive, the place looked very nice, it was late when I came in to eat, so it wasn`t that busy, it was a great experience!"
Robert C.,"San Mateo, CA",32,40,661,4.0,12/31/2012,"This place is a chain, but dammit it is good. Gotta give it props. Get the mushroom burger. Big, juicy, flavorful. Seriously that burger stacks up to the likes of Jack's Prime and The Counter. DON'T ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME! IT DOES! JUST TRY IT!"
Charles L.,"Belmont, CA",11,25,7,1.0,11/6/2011,"We tried this new place and here is my review:  First the hostess was kind of rude when we asked how long was going to take after the time she gave us expired.  Second: our waitress (Rachelle J) had this pierce on her tongue, I understand the new youth some times express them selves in a different way then my generation, but eating my food having to sometimes look to that thing was not pleasant at all. Third: My food came incomplete, I order the  rib-eye that comes with fries(i changed for asparagus) and onion rings, when I was almost done came the asparagus, and when I finished came the onion rings, only because I asked for it three times, we also asked for a soda that never came. Two stars because the food was good, and the stars goes to the kitchen staff. I also want to mention that was my third time on this restaurant and all three times I had unpleasant experiences"
Joe M.,"San Francisco, CA",98,87,181,4.0,9/29/2011,"There's a Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale???  Why yes, there is. It's dark, it's crowded, and it's loud.  But aren't they all pretty much like that?  Came here the other night around 630 pm and they said the wait was 40 minutes.  No prob, I'll just walk the mall for a few.  And 40 minutes is definitely better than the 90 minutes you'd have to wait at the downtown location.  Plus, the parking situ is better than downtown as well.  And the wait turned out to be only 30 minutes.  Sweet! Like others have said, the servers can use more experience.  There was definitely a frantic vibe and some things took longer than they should have.  But the manager came by and helped out, and I even saw him deliver some food to another table.  So at least they're making an effort and I appreciate that. If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, it's pretty decent American food served in pretty big portions.  The menu is pretty extensive...They serve burgers, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, seafood, steaks, salads, beer, wine, and brunch on Sundays.  It'd be pretty hard to not find something on their menu to satiate your appetite.  But of course, the star of the menu is the cheesecake.  I mean, you don't come to the Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake.  But food first... In the past, I've gotten the meatloaf, the club, the mac n cheese balls, and a burger or two.  This time I went with the Caramel Chicken:  Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken in a Spicy Vietnamese Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Green Beans, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. It came with rice.  ( )  It was pretty good.  I liked the texture of the chicken batter, and there was enough sauce on everything that the veggies and rice soaked it up nicely.  The serving was pretty big and I could only finish about half of it.  I was saving room for dessert, after all.  The only complaint I have about the dish is that it did not taste the same the following night.  Everything except the veggies was thoroughly dry, and most of the flavor had somehow disappeared.  My advice?  If you think you'll have leftovers, get something that will taste good the day after.  Or, they even have a new ""SkinnyLicious"" menu with a bunch of items for those of us counting our calories. As for the cheesecake...well, we've all tried it before, haven't we?  I mean, they even sell a variety box at Costco.  The slices are pretty big and are served with a mini mountain of whipped cream.  I went with the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  This is made with 2 layers of their original cheesecake, 2 layers of fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream.  It was definitely a chocolate lover's dream.  A glass of milk would go nicely with it. Overall, the dinner and the resto get 3 stars, but I added the 4th because I really like the cheesecake.  The Cheesecake Factory, in general, isn't a place you'd go to often.  But I'll definitely come back if I'm at Hillsdale, have enough time to wait for a table, am craving a slice of their cheesecake, and don't mind walking around with a food baby belly for a while."
Brittany M.,"Redwood City, CA",44,62,43,4.0,2/20/2013,"Went to dinner around 7pm on a Tuesday night after shopping around at the Hillsdale Mall. I was with my mom and we got seated right away in a booth. Waiter came right away and took our drink order and brought bread along with the drinks. Their brown sweet bread is amazing and addicting!  Ordered the Moroccan Chicken, which was delicious! Came on top of couscous, asparagus, and almonds. Apparently they are taking this dish off the menu, after informed by the waiter who brought us our food. It seems to be a popular dish and I hope they keep it on the menu! Very tasty and our food came out right away.  The waiter was very fast and checked in with us often. Quick and friendly service. Lighting was a bit too dark."
Rachel B.,"San Bruno, CA",86,86,2,4.0,12/5/2011,"I love that Cheesecake factory is now in San Mateo but I don't love the long waits for a table on every day of the week. The food is ok but the cheesecake is amazing. it's worth going here just for dessert. Service isnt always good, sometimes it is but then sometimes its almost impossible to get some service at all. Best time to come is early o in the day for late lunch or early dinner then you avoid waiting an hour for a table."
Kelsey C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/20/2014,"Zero stars if i could. Rude waiters, everyone of my friends dinners were messed up. They forgot to devane my friends shrimp. & i got the stomach flu & hospitalized due to my food. Would rate 0 or more stars. Gross"
Gabriel I.,"San Mateo, CA",68,91,327,4.0,2/9/2012,I've always recieved excellent customer service here. But unfortunately they serve some of the worst food in America so beware. And the cheesecakes are off the hook!
Roni L.,"South San Francisco, CA",10,335,4,2.0,11/2/2011,"Food was fine, but it took the kitchen forever to make it. Server was friendly, but once the 20-person asian invasion (with token white dude) got seated next to us and the gleam of an automatic 18% gratuity hit his eye, we were all but forgotten. Am I being nice giving 2 stars instead of 1?  Maybe...  it is clean and nice cuz it's new... Oh yeah, after complaining 3 years ago to CF that they didn't have a kids menu and then they came out with one shortly thereafter, I'm still claiming credit for that..."
Veg Gal R.,"San Carlos, CA",122,86,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Remind me why people like this place?  I just drove across three cities and paid $40.00 (including tax and tip) for one of the most horrid meals I have had in a long time.  I called in an order for pickup.   They told me it would take about 25 minutes to be ready.  I was there in about half an hour.  When I arrived home the food was all ice cold.  I ordered the fried cheese appetizer, the four cheese pasta, and the 30th Anniversary cheesecake.  The fried cheese was over-cooked and bitter tasting.  The pasta, which I was told was, ""just like lasagna without the meat,"" was simply penne pasta in marinara sauce with a dollop of ricotta on top.  There was no other cheese to be found.  It was ice cold, runny, and had a bad flavor.  To top it off, there was a long black hair in the pasta dish.  Disgusting.  The cheesecake was a much smaller slice than I remember.  It was okay.  Not bad, but nothing special.  Odd, as this is supposed to be their most special cheesecake option.  Very expensive bad food.  I won't be going there again."
Sara L.,"San Francisco, CA",296,173,33,3.0,2/10/2014,"It was my first time at the Cheesecake factory. Maybe I expected too much but my experience kind of sucked. Food was great , atmosphere was great, but our waitress never acknowledged us during our meal. & she was no where to be found when we wanted something. But desserts were YUM!!!"
Ludette S.,"San Mateo, CA",30,11,6,1.0,9/23/2011,"Luv the food but 1& 1/2 to eat with a party of 7 with kids ...NOT FUN!!! If they were able to make reservations I would be more willing to go but not fun to wait 1  &1/2 , most likely won't go, don't need the challenge."
Mikhail Z.,"San Leandro, CA",114,5,,4.0,9/19/2014,"The servings are really good, the servers are also  nice, don't forget about those dMN Cheesecakes!!!! They are my guilty pleasure!!! A good place to go to for all types of occasions! Brace your Wallet though! A very Fancy restaurant has a fancy price."
