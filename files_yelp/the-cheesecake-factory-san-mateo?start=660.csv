Patricia G.,"Emeryville, CA",68,325,20,2.0,9/14/2012,"Came in late night and sat at the bar... Server was enthusiastic which I can appreciate. but at the same time, he was one of those servers who was there when you didn't need him but GONE when you needed a refill on water, to-go box or the bill.  Strange, right? Otherwise, the BIBLE they call a menu is still what is is, OVERWHELMING.  Food is average to say the least.   I want to be a fan of this chain but it's so hard. I think it's the fact that I really get lost in the overwhelming bible they call a menu.   blah."
Christina D.,"Belmont, CA",28,242,,4.0,8/14/2012,"One of my favorite things about Cheesecake Factory is the consistency of the food, you know exactly what you will get when you walk in (assuming you already know what you want). The only thing about this particular location are the long waits on the weekends/evenings. But being able to wander through the mall while you wait makes it a bit easier.  Also, I wouldn't recommend this place for a quiet meal with your significant other, unless you like shouting ""what??"" across the table."
Nancy L.,"San Mateo, CA",18,335,48,5.0,12/23/2011,"Our waiter Hamilton was super professional in mannerism and friendliness.  Even as young as he is, he astutely anticipated our every needs and wants. .  Why can't all waiters and waitresses have this insight?  Got in five minutes before Happy Hour ended but got four HUGE drinks and four supersized appetizers. Two cheesecakes To Go cuz we were stuffed, came to $59. The fried chicken sliders and Sweet Corn appetizers were good. The nachos and avocado rolls were so-so but excellent service outshone the mediocre appetizers.  Thanks again Hamilton."
Jessica M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,56,,1.0,9/15/2015,"I went to the bar today and while the bar tender had great service , the food was terrible. I eat here a lot. The chips in my order were stale. I had the bar tender try some and she seemed to agree and said a manager would come. I paid my bill in full and waited but the manager never came. I order this dish a lot the spinach and artichoke dip. It's never been as bad as it was today and the manager never came. I got up to leave and she said have a great day. I guess the manager was never coming. I think I'm going to avoid this location from now on. I was very nice and rarely complain."
GirlRacer Z.,"San Mateo, CA",86,39,4,3.0,10/11/2011,"Cheesecake if one of my favorite places!! This is a great addition to Hillsdale mall was so excited when it opened.  They have a lovely patio area with super comfy seating and fresh air -- my favorite place to sit.  Plus they have an awesome Cheesesteak sandwich - yummerz!!  Now, the only reason I gave them 3*'s is because the servers need more training.  Some have attitudes, orders were wrong, wait time is horrible, some can't multi-task, and each time I have gone there I had to flag down my servers to get things, even when it wasn't packed.  They should be more proactive and ask if you need anything.  One person who was serving my table left (on lunch or break not sure) but another server had to take over --guess the old server didn't communicate they were leaving.   The table next to me had waited over 30 minutes just to place an order.  There was one server I can't remember her name but she was on top of it!! When I go back, I will get her name and post it here as she should be the role model for all -- super friendly, visits your table several times, gets things as soon as you ask, etc. and always had a smile on her face. Pizza is not the best....BJ's definitely is a front liner to here.  Of course nothing needs to be said about the Cheesecake --- obviously everyone loves the vast variety!  Must try out the breakfast soon and review it. To sum it up, nice seating and location, Food is ok - good depending on what you get.  Restaurant is very spacious as is every Cheesecake factory....more training or friendlier staff needed. :)"
Carolyn A.,"San Francisco, CA",154,103,20,3.0,1/30/2012,"Cheesecake Factories should be pretty standard across the board so I don't know if everyone in here just conspired to have a bad showing, but it was pretty meh.  -First off, they tried to seat us at a table that was still dirty (ew).  -Their bread was really hard like it was made yesterday. We even asked for a second basket hoping for some improvement but there was none.  -They forgot extras we asked for in our orders.  Everyone was really friendly, and the food itself was not bad. For late night dining, I'd probably come back given no other options."
olga d.,"San Francisco, CA",0,27,,1.0,9/8/2015,"We ate there this afternoon. The service was very slow, despite the fact that it was a week day afternoon and almost no one was in there.  I had THE WORST cheese steak ever!!  It was served in a very messy fashion with thick, tasteless chunks of beef and peppers just thrown over a stale roll that they didn't even bother to slice open.  I've had plenty of cheese steaks in my lifetime and I'm used to thinly sliced, tender pieces of beef mixed with thinly sliced peppers and onions and it wasn't anywhere near that. The fries they came with did nothing to save the meal.  Will never go there again."
Jack S.,"San Francisco, CA",5,19,,2.0,6/27/2015,"Turkey burger was descent.  Substituted salad instead of fries. When it arrived at the table I asked the food runner if it would be OK to trade in the mixed greens for just Romain lettuce.  He looked at me as if I asked for a free meal. I was embarrassed.  server came back and said he'd do it but it will cost a dollar. Whatever.  After meal, we ordered 3 desserts.  It took forever. Said bakery was backed up. It was busy but not  worth waiting an additional  20 minutes just for cheesecake."
Alexandra W.,"San Francisco, CA",144,428,43,5.0,1/15/2014,Love the skinnylicious menu. So many yummy options with the calorie count laid out for you. I had the sausage and ricotta flatbread and it was SO good! We are also very pleasantly surprised to realize that our bill for 2 people's lunch was only $14. Like how can you get better than that?
J M.,"La Honda, CA",0,44,,4.0,10/6/2012,"I don't see how anyone could complain about getting too large a portion... They do serve you some serious amounts of food here. Prices are decent, maybe a little steep for some things, but overall service and attitude were nice.  Noisy place (but hey, it's the mall!), but I really can't complain.  Oh yeah, the appetizer came after the entrees (which came really fast), and the gal who brought them out seemed genuinely upset that they were late. I appreciate that level of care in a waitstaff.  Cheers, I'll be back!"
Mann E.,"Sausalito, CA",35,27,11,1.0,4/17/2014,Poor service. Food was served 25mins later after we order it was about 10:25. Ordered Chicken garlic noodles & the food was a disappointment after serving it late. Will never go back here again.
Gee D.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,5,1.0,4/19/2016,"This place is the least busiest cheesecake factory i have ever been too and i know exactly why! From the host to Server all the way to the food was horrible! Me, my wife my 2 year old and 9 month old,  my cousin and her four kids went to celebrate her eldest sons bday turning 14. When we got there the hosts was confused of our request for seating and he put us in a tiny booth when there were plenty of seating at a regular table. Then the server came introduce herself ""Demian"" ask us what we wanted to drink pretty normal stuff we said thank you, she didn't reply took our order came back with our drinks then i say ""i think we are ready to order now"" she reply with an attitude ""I'm just dropping off your drinks"" walks away puts the tray she carried the drinks with somewhere then came back and looked at us with a pen and pad without saying anything so I'm thinking to myself i guess its time to order now. She took our orders demanded the menus back. We were all like whats her problem. Food was served brought over by other staff members. She comes even before we get a bite in and say hows everything without waiting for reply walks away. Our waters wasn't being filled we never got a your welcome all the times we said thank you. And then on top of that i was tired of dealing with her shit cause i obviously realize shes prolly not happy with her life soo i didnt want to deal with her at time. She comes ask us if wanted dessert we order a slice for my little nephew bday. Wife and cousin and two youngest kids went to bathroom the server comes with the cheese cake and says oh there not here (my nephews mom) and says lets just sings just take lots of pictures. Mid happy birthday my wife and cousin comes back, song ends the server didnt apologize or anything or even suggest to sing ago. Long story short our experience herr was horrible! The server was obviously not happy with how her life was going and decided to take it out on her customers! From reading most of the comments on this cheesecake factory just reassured me of how i felt! Will not be supporting this place ever again! I rather wait 3 hours for a table at union square location then experience that kind of service again!!!"
Victoria L.,"South San Francisco, CA",69,130,1,2.0,11/12/2011,"I gave two stars for the food...but the service made me want to drop it to one star. The food was good - looooots of menu selection. Loved the brown bread that came to the table! It was SLOW though. Took forever to get our meals out to us (on a Tuesday night at 5pm Our waiter had some big tables and totally forgot about it. We had to flag him down for everything. He started off strong, but as the workload increased he obviously couldn't handle it. Why would you go to the Cheesecake Factory? Umm...for dessert, right? We had our child with us and after being done for a full 20mins and not being able to flag anyone down, we had no choice but to leave without dessert. Cranky kid = time to leave. My diet thanked me...but overall, I was NOT happy."
Sunny S.,"Belmont, CA",125,135,37,3.0,11/3/2011,"Hmm how many times is it now this week.I know this place is overly reviewed about all the incredible dishes but I wanted to write about the location and services.  Location- Outstanding addition to San Mateo, Hillsdale Mall in particular. They did a great job with the outside décor and landscaping it really gives the place an extra appeal. I love the enclosed outside area which has giant windows that they open up on nice days to turn into outdoor enclosed seating. I've sat outside there for a Sunday Brunch with the family and it was a great place to enjoy the sun with great food and great people. Yes, they have a Sunday Brunch menu and yes like everything else the food is amazing. Services- I've now had the chance to order take out twice and both times have been a hellish affair. When you first turn into the parking lot you will notice they have about 5 stalls designated for Cheese Cake Take Out but they are always full. So that leaves you to drive around aimless trying to get a parking spot near enough so the employee's can locate you. Both times the food was not ready at the designated time and we had to keep checking up on the status eventually my friend had to go inside and get it. I have to say that both times I went were during the first few weeks they opened so maybe they didn't have together yet but I have to say the food is worth the wait."
Nadia J.,"San Jose, CA",24,62,127,1.0,8/28/2013,"If I could NO STARS I would. It's sad cause I love the food but the service is disgusting. I've come here on a my lunch break often and this past Monday topped it off. We ordered a few appetizers, and we then realized an hour had passed and we had not received anything!!! The server walked by and we asked for a manager who looked 18yrs old dryly apologized and said he'd go check. No thanks, we got up and left. CHANGE YOUR MANAGEMENT!!!"
Abhishek K.,"Redwood City, CA",2,37,,1.0,1/25/2015,"They seem to be hiring waiters with mood swings. When asked for a couple things ( plates and butter), the bartender Justin made a weird face and banged his hand against the wall. The manager was apologetic, but looking at other reviews here, hope they try to give service some importance. And hire people who belong to the service industry."
Chris W.,"San Francisco, CA",12,35,1,5.0,9/21/2011,"They just opened, so I was not expecting a lot.  There wasn't really a huge line, so we got seated fairly quickly.  The decor is very similar to their other locations.  Even the restroom door handle is the same style.  It's impressive that they can maintain that level of consistency and branding. They have two different IPAs on the menu and they gave me the wrong one.  They swapped it out but would have been nice to keep both so I could compare.  Drunk yelpers tend to write better reviews.   I asked how the pork chop was, but the waitress hadn't tried it yet.  I know there are a lot of items on the menu, but maybe part of the training is that staff should be given samples of the food they serve.  I took a leap of faith and ordered it anyway.  Our friends started to get their food and I was starting to wonder where was my food.  Someone came over and said there was a delay with my pork chop b/c someone burnt it.  They comped me a soup, which I thought was nice of them.  When I initially ordered the pork chop, I was concerned whether or not it would be dry or not.  After hearing the news about the burnt one, cognitive dissonance was kicking in.  When it did come out, it was moist and perfect.  What a relief. One of the managers also came by our table to check in.  I thought that was very good of them to do that. I would have normally given a lower rating given the experience but b/c of the comped food and manager follow up, they recovered gracefully.  It gave me a feeling that they really cared and I was rooting for them to succeed. Since I wasn't familiar w/ the layout of Hillsdale Mall, it took me awhile to find the restaurant.  I entered the mall in the middle coming from the Caltrain station.  There was no directory at the entrance so I wasn't sure if I was even in the right building. I had even tried searching on my phone for ""Cheesecake Factory Hillsdale"" and only found news articles discussing the move in.  There was some scant mention of the old Mervyns location so that lead me to believe it must be physically connected to the mall since Mervyns probably used to be one of their anchor tenants.   They need some better SEO. When I walked further in, I did finally see a sign pointing to ""Restaurants"" but that led me to the exact opposite side of the mall.   It was at that end of the mall where I found a real directory and was able to locate the Cheesecake Factory.  Better signage please."
Athena S.,"San Francisco, CA",70,776,71,3.0,2/9/2012,"Inconsistency is the only consistency here. Some experiences good, some not so good. Judge for yourself.  My review doesn't matter, thus the neutral 3."
Alissa L.,"San Francisco, CA",196,23,108,1.0,8/1/2013,Highly do not recommend eating here to order a slice of cheesecake! However I do recommend eating here if you order a full meal! Do you get what I'm saying?
Ashley C.,"San Mateo, CA",102,166,42,2.0,10/18/2011,"Once you get in the service is usually pretty good.  Not at this location!  Granted they just opened a few weeks ago, but come on....train your staff.   Our visit started with a 20 minute wait that was actually an hour wait.  Just tell me if it's 1hr then it's about an hour.  Don't tell me a lie cause I would've gone somewhere else. Finally sat down and it took the server another 10 minutes before she came to greet us or even bring water. We were ready so we ordered right away.  This gal couldn't get it together!  I ordered a specialty salad with a regular iced tea.  thinking nothing off it, she took off leaving the menus with us so she can place the order on their POS system.  Five minutes have gone by and she's still at the POS entering the orders.  She finally got some assistance and we waited for our order to arrive. I kid you not, 10 more minutes go by and she still hasn't brought our drinks to our table.  We finally asked another server to please check on our drinks.  A few more minutes came and she finally appears with our drinks.  To my disappointment, I get this horrid flavored tea instead of the standard black ice tea. I called her to our table and asked her again for a regular ice tea and she claims that they don't have any. Their menu claims to have regular black ice tea and she says they don't carry it and that all their flavored teas tastes similar.  Whatever!!!! 5 more minutes go by and she comes back to tell me that I they ran out of salad.  I said excuse me....you mean to say that you don't have any mixed greens, poultry or bacon to make this salad.  These are staple items in a restaurant.  She apologized but I needed to order another dish.   I ordered something else out of frustration and my curiosity forced me to stop another server to question the lack of black iced tea and salad.  To my surprise, this server said yes they had iced tea and got it for me and further proceeded to check on the salad.   She brought the manager over and I expressed my concerns and that I wasn't sure her our was competent.  She apologized and offered to get the salad but low and behold, the food we ordered arrived and I didn't want to waste it Long story short...no compensation other than I'm sorry!  Definitely not a good first impression.  First and last time for me at this location!"
