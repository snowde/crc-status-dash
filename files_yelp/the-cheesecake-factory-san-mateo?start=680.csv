Lindsey J.,"Foster City, CA",2,63,2,3.0,8/9/2012,"I have only started to eat here because they are about two blocks away from my work so it's very convenient.  I really don't like how you can't make reservations, get seated until your whole party arrives or how loud it gets BUT I do like their food, service and hours of operation. The little house salad is the biggest little salad I have ever seen!  Love it! The ahi tuna appetizer is good but too small and kinda expensive for what you are getting.  I could eat three of those! lol The fish & chips were good but not reliable.  The first time was excellent but not the second time.  My cutie pie thought it was chicken, not a good sign right?? The meat pasta (and I ask for extra mushrooms) is pretty good.  Not watery like some places and the sauce is tasty.  Much easier than my homemade three hour sauce so can't complain. Overall, it's pretty decent and they have a great big menu to pick from.  Lunch time can be a pain but I have gone at 11 so I never had a service issue.  Noise level is another but if you sit by the windows, it's much nicer.  And I am sure the desserts are great but I won't know."
Sonya T.,"San Francisco, CA",112,232,34,4.0,12/30/2011,"I completely forgot that this Cheesecake Factory was open!  So one night we came here, just to check it out and compare services to all the other Cheesecakes we have eaten at.  I didn't think it was open that long, so I was expecting a horrible wait but much to our surprise our buzzer went off after about 10 mins.  We were seated facing the bar.  All Cheesecakes look alike, so I wasn't really blown away but what I really liked was having a lot of space and not feeling cramped.  The service was okay, slightly slow in the beginning but the quality of food made up for it - just as good as the other locations.   If you are a Cheesecake Factory lover, definitely come here.  The one thing I noticed that really stands out is that all of the cheesecakes are cheaper than the SF location by at least $2.  We had ordered two slices to go and I was expecting to spend around $20 but they were like $14, say what!  Pretty awesome in my opinion.  Also, the lack of crazy insane tourists and huge shopping families was nice."
Rick A.,"Redwood City, CA",1,7,,1.0,1/27/2012,Let me start with how much I love cheesecake factory I do.  But my experience at Cheesecake Factory of San Mateo was terrible.  The waitress forgot about us it took us a half hour to get water another 20 minutes to get our drinks oh and my meal was brought to us 20 minutes prior to my appetizers. All before we even got our water Did I mention my Santa Fe salad had the chicken backbone hidden under the lettuce.  Needless to say we did not pay for our meal that night but not because the manger comped us. No after all this he only took $10 of my bill.  I had to advise him that we would not be paying to which he agreed. Well at least he got that right. I hope this was just a bad day for everyone working there and not an indication of how this restaurant will be run
Lexy H.,"Millbrae, CA",2,35,34,5.0,9/22/2011,"I'm soo excited that we have one now!, Northern Peninsula! This Sunday, I'm hopping on the Cal Train and going here for drinks! It's just a hop - skip and a jump! Yay, strawberry Martini time!!!!"
Caroline P.,"Burlingame, CA",252,23,9,4.0,8/2/2013,Typical Cheesecake Factory. Sat in the bar area at a high top table in the middle of the afternoon. Service was great. But kitchen forgot an ingredient on my salad. Server was helpful in getting it corrected and always had our drinks refilled.
Will F.,"Foster City, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/18/2015,"I have been to this location 3 times and all 3 times I have had to talk to the manager to recover the situation or apologize. I love Cheesecake Factory! However, this location seems to fall short on the service every time. The speed of service is lacking, quality of the end product is disappointing. The portion seems way smaller than other locations."
Kellmerr M.,"Sacramento, CA",37,176,20,4.0,8/31/2013,We went here tonight for dinner. Our server Benny was awesome. Very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I had an issue with something I ordered and he had the general manager come to our table. The store manager came to our table as well. Excellent Customer service!  I will definitely come back when I'm the area.
Sherene L.,"San Mateo, CA",13,59,34,3.0,10/9/2011,"First off I'm happy that they have a Cheesecake Factory at the mall now, so I don't have to drive all the way to Palo Alto or SF for delicious cheesecake. Since they opened, I've been here twice.  I will have to say that it's worth it coming here early.  FIrst time I came for lunch I got sat right away, the second time I came, I was quoted a wait of 1 hour and 20 minutes...but it actually ended up being an hour and 40 minutes. :( First off, when you get those little buzz electronics alerting you to when you're table is read to seat you, be forewarned that Cheesecake claims that those buzz electronics only work right outside of Cheesecake and to the side where the outside seating is. (I'm sure once H&M opens it, it will work there as well) But not too sure... The two times I came, service was amazing.  The waiter the first time explained some of the favorites and was very attentive.  The second time, the waitress was very attentive and she even offered to split the bill for us before we asked.  Plus, she was able to split the bill correctly the first time without having to write anything down. Although I had some really great experiences at the Cheesecake Factory compared to others, I just felt that they didn't deserve 4 stars.  To be honest, I don't think I'm that old, but the lighting in there was horrible.  Maybe it was for atmosphere or something, but when you're going there for dinner and attempting to read that extensive menu, poor lighting and little font didn't help at all.  I ended up having to use my iphone to read the menu.  And I didn't like how long we had to wait, I don't think almost 2 hours for food that is just decent is worth that time in waiting.   Oh and a friend of mine mentioned it, they have the space to do like a second story or maybe roof top seating, we thought it would have been nice to build that...Always wondered why. If you don't have plans and just want to go for the food and cheesecake, I would highly recommend either eating there for lunch, getting take out, or eating somewhere else, and having cheesecake to go for dessert.  Not really worth 2+ hours wait...."
Kerri L.,"Bellevue, WA",71,232,262,3.0,9/25/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a fun good ol' standby restaurant, type of place I like to go ~1/month.  They have a menu w/ a large variety that can cater to just about anyone's dietary needs, large portions that are good for sharing (especially when leaving room for dessert), and a great going out ambiance that helps you forget you are sitting in Hillsdale Shopping Center in the middle of suburbia.   Fire roasted artichoke (app) and Chicken Marsala were ok - way too thick a cheese layer for my taste on the chicken.   Of course, I was just there for the Adam's PB Ripple cheesecake - which never disappoints me.  :)"
Ite H.,"Newark, CA",76,34,87,4.0,6/18/2012,"Always good. I love trying new things here.... You'll get your $'s worth and taste buds satisfied. Best healthy drink: H2O with cucumbers.... very fresh to compliment any meal. :-)  This time I tried the Chicken Pasta with Sun Dried Tomatoes in a cream sauce. It was divine. Savory and tasty. I'm usually ordering seafood (Herb Crusted Salmon/Miso Salmon/ Ahi Tuna, Catfish, etc...) --- but at the CF, as stated above...love trying new things. I was pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Pasta. Will have it again."
Tomtom K.,"Ontario, CA",0,49,18,4.0,10/13/2011,"Come on you guys, Its a chain restaurant!!  Cheesecake Factories are always packed!  I think they have an extremely long menu in hopes to distract you long enough so the server can help 2x as many people. They are super nice and always helpful. the servers are like flashes of white as they zoom past you but thats cause they are working their booties off to get you your food and drinks.   The food here is good. like i said large menu so there is bound to be something you like.  I personally love their pasta dishes, sandwiches, and soups.  I recently looked at the calorie intake on some of the stuff and yikes.  I think I'll be having cheesecake or dinner not both!  But they did come out with a new skinnylicious menu which is great. lots of filling options for under 600 calories.  I had the tacos and they were awesome. I asked my self would i get this again?  and the answer??? YES.  info specific to this location: Yes its new. No the construction is not their fault. yes I tried it out. Yes i have been to other locations before. no i did not think there was much of a deviation in service/quality.  parking was easy cause its a mall."
Jessica C.,"Hayward, CA",68,174,30,5.0,11/27/2011,I ran out of my favorite cosmetic product and decided to make a run to Macy's. I was ecstatic to see the Cheesecake Factory up and running.  My fiance felt the same way so we dined here for my birthday and it was a great dining experience.  Our server was awesome. The food came on time and was on-point! The ambiance was pleasing.  The cheesecake was PERFECT! Thank you for coming to Hillsdale! :)
Joyce E.,"Daly City, CA",138,1014,2098,3.0,3/11/2012,"3 stars for their cheesecake! Meh for everything else though. The hosts/waiters are all very friendly. I've never encountered an unpleasant staff member from this location. Whenever I'm seated in a booth, the floors are usually sticky! Gross. The food is overpriced and bland. My pasta never has flavor, my sandwiches are plain, and the drinks are watery. My mom loooves pina colada and she barely finished hers because she said it was too watery. I didn't believe her, took a sip, and complained to the waiter but he didn't do anything about it. The dessert is good, though."
Dominic S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,,1.0,10/17/2011,"I went their today for the second time because the first time wasnt the best experience. I thought i would be generous and give them a second shot. And boy has it gotten worse. Not only is the place grossly over staffed but you would think that with all the employees their would be fast prompt service, WRONG. It seems the staff is more interested in each others personal lives and talking then actually serving the customers. I work in the food serivce industry so i understand if things are a bit slow sometimes, it happens. but when your sitting their waiting for your server to bring your drinks or other items and they are relaxing in the corner talking and hanging out at the bar, its a bit rude and doesnt look to good on their part.  -THE food is very goooood !!! which prolly about all i can say. other then that they get 5 stars for laziness."
Petunia L.,"Pacifica, CA",668,501,319,5.0,8/12/2013,I love the Thai chicken  lettuce wraps! I also love the Godiva cheesecake! I also love their lil cozy veranda for nice days! I also love that they serve bread before your meal. I also love that they feed me fast! Mmmm cheesecake!
Brian C.,"Daly City, CA",81,89,15,4.0,2/26/2012,"Review only for desert. Came here in the afternoon with K because she was craving her sweets as normal.  Around 330 pm on a Wednesday, the restaurant was half empty but still well staffed and we were promptly seated.  Our waiter was attentive and brought waters out in beer mugs, which was a little weird but ok.  We ordered a black chocolate cake or something and it balanced the sweetness with almonds and creme fraiche.  Very tasty. The location seemed like it was very big, there was outdoors seating, semi-outdoor seating in the mall and plenty of seating indoors, there's also a bar area that was getting ready to accommodate happy hour guests as we were leaving. Overall, happy with the experience and service, taste was great and would be back if I never had to wait."
John S.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,14,,2.0,2/25/2013,"I read an article recently about the genius level executive management of this chain that made me want to give it another try after a long time. It talked about how all recipes are perfected and tested, how all the executive chefs are trained, and in turn train their own staffs, and how each plate is personally scrutinized and rated by the head chef before leaving the kitchen. Great attention to detail, right? So how to explain the waiter that showed up late for his shift, the delayed basket of bread that was smashed because the waiter had stacked another basket on top of it, the butter pats so soft they had to have been out of the fridge for hours, the constant attempts to upsell, the salad that was barely dressed, the breaded and fried crab bites that were soft and mushy, and pasta carbonara, a giant gloppy bowl almost completely devoid of flavor.  So, how to explain the horde of people we passed on our way out, waiting for their pagers to buzz and to be shown to their table?"
Dru M.,"San Francisco, CA",986,473,9,3.0,12/29/2011,"My mom, boyfriend and I found ourselves dining here on Christmas Eve this year. One reason was because they were open :), but the other would be because I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan for years. This was the first CF I've been too since moving to CA and I'm very happy with my overall experience.  Everything we ordered was delicious, prepared correctly and seasoned well. Now of course we didn't order anything crazy (I went with one of their tasty salads, which are HUGE, my mom went with the meatloaf, which she loved and the bf ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla). Their menu is very large...so there's something for everyone.  Service was great! Our server was very attentive, food came out quickly and price to portion was good.  Parking - since this location is by the mall (Hillsdale Shopping Center)...there's plenty of parking within the mall's lot/garage. Note - make sure you get a slice of one of their many varieties of cheesecake. They are all delicious and huge! Overall...if you're looking for a tasty, low stress brunch/lunch/dinner option...here's a place for you!"
Kaliah C.,"San Francisco, CA",84,63,43,1.0,10/15/2013,"My mouse hovered over the 2 stars, then 1, then 2, and I had to make the final click on the 1. This place is overpriced and gross. For a fairly new establishment one would think it take years to get this bad... The wait is RIDICULOUS. I'd understand if the wait was actually worth it, but seriously, the taste of the cocktails, the appetizers, the dinner and even THE CHEESECAKE is all horribly sub par. It's basically a giant menu filled with mediocre, flavorless and OVERPRICED items. The pictures are deceptive. It's all a giant disappointment, especially after the long wait. EVERYTHING tastes like it was shipped frozen in a box, then thawed, reheated and served. As a place with the name 'Cheesecake Factory', shouldn't the cheesecake at least be amazing?? That also tastes premade, frozen and thawed (topped with Reddi-whip out of the can). Everything was disgusting about the cheesecake- the crust was like powdered cardboard (texture and flavor) and I could taste the HFCS. You get a much better tasting cheesecake at Coscto. Seriously. At least I know it's baked fresh there... And the whole thing costs the same as one slice here. The only good thing about my experience here was our server- she was really attentive and fast. This chain is ridiculously overpriced... I can't say that enough. Don't waste a dime or your time. For the prices you can get superb food in SF. Some reviewers like the ones in other cities but I'm never coming here or going to any Crapcake Factory ever again."
Anahi H.,"Redwood City, CA",1,6,,1.0,5/9/2014,"I went to cheese cake factory like 2 months ago for the first time. I spent $60 on a dinner and I got food poisoned. I talked to the manager named Chris and he only said he was sorry. I was waiting to get at least part of my money back, but I didn't get anything from them. I would never go back to that place because you're playing to get sick. I totally gives them no stars."
