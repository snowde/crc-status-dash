Jill R.,"San Mateo, CA",1,14,,2.0,9/29/2011,"One of my favorite casual places to grab a bite.  So disappointed.  The onion rings that my husband ordered were actually swimming in oil.  If we were not so tired and hungry they would have gone back in a second.  The oil (I had a small bite) left a coating on my hands that could only be removed after a trip to the ladies room.  My tuna carpaccio, which I dream about was cut so thick and full of grizzle it was so chewy and disappointing.  I think they even changed the sauce that was promised on the menu.  hummmmmmm.  The last one we ate at was in Palm Springs and the food along with the resort feel was so fantastic I could hardly wait to return.  Now, not so much.  As for the cheesecake we usually leave behind because its more cake than cheese in its huge caloric mass.  It was my 50th birthday and was offered a desert and then was charged for it!  Yikes, can you imagine. Their were mobs of employees but we still had to ask for bread, ask for ice tea refills and although our requests were met as soon as we asked they still managed to all mingle in a huddle by our table full of giggles. That's when our $70 bill came for 3 appetizers and a entree.  Since we live up the street we will try again I'm sure but please Factory, get it together soon and save some $$ by cutting back on your frier.  Those onion rings are awful!"
David H.,"Foster City, CA",96,100,6,2.0,10/10/2011,"We went inside cheesecake factory and asked for a table, we're getting some cheesecake (only cheesecakes) for my cousin's birthday. The guy in the front told us that we would need to wait for 70 minutes for the seats, we're fine with it so we just waited, after 30 minutes the restaurant told us that there's a table for us, which is great, we were all confused though because the guy said 70 minutes... We went to our table, got our menu and everything; decided what we're going to order.  But the waiter comes after about 15 minutes, after that... Everything is slower than ever... We ordered, finally.  But then it took them 20 minutes, there was about 3 waiters and waitress that came to our table and served us at the same time, which was weird. (we ONLY ordered cheesecakes) and then... we ate...everything goes normal again. My cousin then asked for a box to take out the rest...it took them 15 minutes to get the box... and it took them 15 minutes to get the bills and everything done. We were glad that we did not tell the waiter that it's my cousin's birthday, or it might take about another 20 or 30 minutes just to get the cake and sing the birthday song. So I finally understand why the guy said 70 minutes, he meant 70 minutes just to go through the process of waiting. but the food is nice, as usual."
Marty M.,"San Francisco, CA",5,158,,1.0,6/18/2012,"I have eaten at other Cheese Cake Factory locations with much better results. We showed up to the Cheese Cake Factory at 6:30pm and were given the customary buzzer and told that the wait time would be approximately 55 minutes. After an hour had gone by I went to check on our table status and was told that it would be soon and that there were only a few people in front of us. Another 30 minutes pass by and I go to inquire again. She said they buzzed us and that we never responded. I told her that the buzzer never went off and that we were sitting 10 feet away from her in the waiting area. She said she would give us the next available table. I took this to mean that she would seat us next, but she seated us after the 20 people in line were gone.  After we were shown to our table we had to wait for somebody to come and clean the table and seats. There were crumbs and butter smears all over the seats. We ordered our food and it took a little while. The Asian waiter that we had never came by to see if we needed anything or if everything was OK. We had to flag down several other waiters for soda refills, ketchup, cheese, and extra napkins. The food was not hot and did not taste like anything special. We did not see our waiter until we were ready to pay the bill. We did not want to order our 2 cheese cakes to go, because our server was so bad and we did not want to tip him any additional on top of the bill. We ended up only leaving him a 12% tip rather than the usual 20% tip.  We then proceeded to get in line to order our 2 cheese cakes. The line took another 20 minutes. We were at the Cheesecake Factory for almost 3 hours. I do not plan on going back to this location anytime soon. I also eat at other locations from time to time as a Mystery Guest."
D M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,8,4,1.0,3/23/2014,"Ok I gave it a third chance to see if the below average food was a fluke but no! Was seated at a booth table that was not set then the salad I ordered was not delivered and they charged me on the bill? The main dish smelled like a musky sponge, you know the smell. Sent it back and even the waitress almost gagged when she smelled it. This had been my third bad experience here! I definitely will not be returning ever again. DONE. Bye, bye!"
Jeannie C.,"San Mateo, CA",7,90,5,5.0,9/24/2011,"Wow! This is long overdue for San Mateo, a vibrant American restaurant that will accommodate any palette. They are situated at the south end of the mall with plenty of parking. It is impressive that on opening week they were able to maintain the quality of food, outstanding friendly service, and upbeat atmosphere with people having a great time.  As you enter the restaurant, the bar is situated in the center, to the right there are seating out in the mall area, to the left there are outdoor seating facing El Camino. The restaurant is grand but still feels comfortable and welcoming. Their regal décor makes this a warm cozy place to eat. We ordered Chicken Madeira, sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese. Miso Salmon served with snow peas and white rice, sadly the rice was not warm. Our guest ordered Chicken Piccata served with mashed potatoes and Carlton salad served with grilled chicken. The chicken was moist, salmon and salad was fresh. It was just a perfect evening. It would be awesome if they could maintain the pace of their outstanding service and food. We all had a great experience; for sure we will be back."
Pooya S.,"San Mateo, CA",16,7,1,1.0,3/23/2014,"I have been to this restaurant six times over the last year. The service is OK. Unfortunately, the food has become worse over time. The last time I was there, I ordered Skinnilicious chicken pasta. The food was bland and cold. I am definitely not going back there."
Mark W.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,12,,1.0,3/6/2013,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! The guy that serves me was very rude! He delivered bread at the end of our meal which was very inappropriate. He was always giggling with other colleagues and wasn't paying any attention to the area he supposed to cover. Never filled up our glass until we asked for check. This Cheesecake Factory should do a better job TRAINING those young kids who do not care about the reputation of Cheesecake Factory!
Shauna S.,"San Francisco, CA",149,904,19,1.0,10/1/2011,"Let's get this out of the way, the food is good. I had the SkinnyLicious Veggie burger and it was tasty. The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip was also good, though they can stand to give you more pieces of sourdough bread. Where they really loose stars is all about the service. Which is just short of dishearteningly terrible. Yes, there's a lot of people (who lack manners) and an awful lot of kids running amok however it's part of the mall atmosphere so I can't knock them for that. But. My party and I order drinks and one appetizer -- the drinks arrive and then the waitress lets us know that someone else will be taking care of us for a bit (for what I assume would be her break or dinner). They leave and then after a while the second waitress takes our orders and then leaves. She came back to check on us and offer more bread to which we ask about the calamari that we've already ordered and apparently that order never went through. So she puts in an order of calamari for us and brings us more bread. A server comes out with calamari and serves it to the other table. Our second appetizer and our entrees come out now and naturally we're still wondering where the first appetizer that we ordered is. It's somewhere, but not here so they request another order calamari to be brought out to us. By now, we're done with our meals however we are told that a manager would bring us our calamari.  The calamari arrives after we have everything boxed. No manager in sight. Yeah, it took about 45 minutes before a manager finally came out to see us stating that they weren't told that they should have seen us in the first place. So now we've got cold calamari for dessert, no one showing us a dessert menu and everyone pretty much afraid to come near our table. After we turned down dessert and coffee (because let's face it, it's now 1.5 hours later and I see no reason that we should spend any more money here) the bill takes a while to arrive -- the manager has comped us the appetizers and drinks. Sure, I could forgive them had they just apologized upfront for the goof. I could have overlooked a lot of things, but the fact that this was so poorly managed from all people is just ridiculous. They may have tasty food but I might suggest that you get it to go."
Chuck k.,"Menlo Park, CA",151,360,56,4.0,12/13/2011,"I'd eaten at the CFs in Columbus and Palo Alto. From what I gathered if you stick to certain dishes, it's pretty good.  Case in point, I was here for a work lunch/celebration. 1/2 of the team was stuck fixing a release issue and end up being 45 minutes late. The staff was very nice, holding a big table for us, then getting half of us seated in 15 minutes (around 12:30) at a smaller table and putting the rest of us at the top of the list when we got there.  And our server was efficient, drinks were filled. And my kobe burger was cooked medium as I wanted, and very tasty. And the cheesecake is darn good."
Dave M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,27,,2.0,8/18/2013,"Good food , good service, crappy seat. If you go here don't let them seat you in the mall area. Its loud and feels like your in a food court."
Dan D.,"San Francisco, CA",357,79,51,4.0,11/14/2013,I've been continuing to come here with my GF and over the past year their customer service has improved a bunch... still some hiccups here and there but overall much better.
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1464,987,1073,5.0,11/11/2011,"Looks like I've already written a review for this place, and looks like the Pasta da Vinci beats the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  Depends if you want lots of spice or not~ Some of the tables can be really small, the tables for 2 that is, so you just got to hope the other person doesn't mind.  And the bread basket: the brown bread beats the french bread. The servers will joke with you, too.  Really friendly.  Thanks again cheesecake (& company!!) for the great meal~~~~"
Una H.,"San Bruno, CA",0,37,11,4.0,4/5/2014,"Way much better experience this time around.  Good food and drinks. Mango Margarita. Chicken salad sandwich. green salad. Awesome sweet potato fries. Better than Elephant Bar.  Excellent Service. I mean, Excellent. Friendly, attentive service. Awesome server, Jenny. I didnt get their names, but those who brought our food and drinks were awesome too.  And I was observing other tables too (What? I was multitasking) and service was great too. This is how service should be. Previous visit (years ago because service was rude and inattentive) Faith in Cheesecake Factory restored. Especially this location. Havent returned to SF location for years because of rude, mean staff. Hopefully assholes ( sorry for the term but that's how mean they were) have been replaced.  Minus one star because of a very minor thing. Asked for water with no ice. water came with ice. But this was a very, very minor issue.  Looking forward to next visit."
Pete T.,"San Mateo, CA",1,35,,3.0,4/4/2014,"Ugh....I refuse to go to Cheesecake Factory any more. The last 2 times I ate there, they made us wait in line for over 30 minutes even though 1/3 the place was still empty claiming they weren't staffed enough. THIS IS A TACTIC that many chain restaurants take which is similar to how night clubs make people wait in line to create an atmosphere of demand and popularity. Then, when we wait, the servers are hustling, but they are clearly understaffed. It takes 10-15 minutes of hailing servers to get the bread basket and a meal took 90 minutes. My kids are very easy going, but 90 fricken' minutes after waiting 30 minutes even though restaurant was not full for a 2 hour meal at the Cheesecake Factory?! Ludicrous. So recently, I went with my 7 yr old and they told us 15-20 minutes wait. We waited, and waited and after 25 minutes they told me only 5-10 more minutes. My patience was already boiling and I knew it would be a 1 hour+ wait to even get the food. WE BAILED. We ate at BK in the food court instead for $10, and with all the money we saved not eating there, we bought ourselves some jelly beans and gummy bears, got a Hello Kitty item and a couple cookies for dessert. What a great evening. No thank you Cheesecake Factory, I am never coming back because your service sucks. Food: 4 stars - I think the food is solid, and they give good portion. Great cheesecaske of course and their bread is phenomenal. Pricing: 3 stars - decent value restaurant and reason why people go there. Service: 1 star - they suck. The servers and hostesses are fine as it's not their fault. It's understaffed EVERY TIME I've been there (5+ times in last 2 years), and they purposely make you wait in line to get seated even when they are not full. Did I say their service model sucks? Be thankful I am even giving 3 stars as the experience there is NOT relaxing and frankly I rounded up giving you 3 stars (for the San Mateo location) only because the bread is really good and that it's not the servers fault."
Alexandra T.,"Sacramento, CA",96,9,,1.0,1/29/2014,Horrible service! Took 30+ minutes to get food that was only warm because it was sitting under hot lamps. My tomatoes were warm! EWWWW!!!  My sister was supposed to have sweet potato fries with her sandwich but regular fries came out with it. Then waited another 15 minutes to get sweet potato fries after we contacted manager. This is the cheesecake factory not a high end restaurant so we shouldn't  have to wait 30+ minutes for food for a party of 3. Get it together Cheesecake Factory Hillsdale. Won't be returning.
Bianca N.,"Millbrae, CA",0,8,7,1.0,10/13/2015,"Super disappointed with my visit. I usually LOVEEE Cheesecake Factory and I begged my boyfriend to take me here. He agreed and we arrived around 12:20 On October 9, 2015. We sat outside where the mall is and it wasn't a big deal for us. We sat there and noticed there was one table waiting for food and another table that sat after us. Our waitress took the drink and food order for table that sat after us. Then she came to my table and just asked for drinks and left right away. She didn't even let us order any appetizers (we already knew what we wanted to eat too). Then we waited around for 10 minutes for the drinks to come and right after she settled the drinks down, she just stood there with her pen and paper and didn't say a word to us. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and were like uhh ok. Then we ordered and she left. Our appetizer came out and 30 minutes later our dishes came out. There were a few other tables that sat a good 30 minutes after us and got their food right after us. And my boyfriends food was cold and the chicken was rubbery. We also noticed that every table around us left before our food even came. We were so disappointed because she didn't even check up on our table or anything. My boyfriend and I were fed up and eventually boxed our food to go and it took us 15 minutes to even get our waitresses attention for boxes and the bill."
Nit C.,"Belmont, CA",23,114,,1.0,11/29/2013,Ordered a kale salad appetizer to go... and 28 minutes later I got tossed greens. Should I wait for another one? And do I need to say more?
Matt K.,"Belmont, CA",5,57,9,5.0,2/25/2014,"CCF not only have tasty menu but also super nice service and waiters. After Paul's Matin forgetting to give us seat, me and my friend choose CCF with different welcome. Not just in San Mateo location, when we visit to Thousand Oaks we got same treatment. Even my mom push me to give more tips to handsome waiter. Mom! But he really did great job in terms of his responsibility and knowing what he needs to do. I can tell CCF management doing very well. If I think to hang out with friends and family in nice and cozy place, this is the one pop in my mind."
Katie O.,"San Francisco, CA",430,18,36,3.0,1/15/2013,"My parents and I came in at 5:30 pm for dinner and had to flag down a busser after 10 minutes of no service to grab our server. Then Michael came by who informed us that he wasn't our server, but just assisting our server, Johan (sp?). he  was extremely friendly and helpful and then introduced us to our server. The manager also came over to apologize and offered to buy us a cheesecake. Overall our experience turned out to be pleasant, after the initial issue! I like the food, so we'll return, but next time we'll ask for Michael!"
Rob D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,33,2,3.0,5/6/2015,"This place is fine, the waitress and other members of the staff did their job well and were rather nice. The food is good too - at least what we ordered. No disappointment. I would put 3.5 stars if I could, 3 seems a little low, and 4 a little too high, as I like it but don't consider myself a fan (yet)"
