Bing A.,"Belmont, CA",0,15,,3.0,8/28/2012,"since the restaurant is located in the mall, it can be tricky getting a table right away, depending on what time & day you go there. So far, the most that we've waited for a table was like any where from 20-30 minutes, so it's not that bad. I always order the Chicken Madiera, Shepards Pie - it's always these 2 dishes that stand out for my husband and I. My son, loves the bow tie pasta w/ meat sauce. Very yummy.  The Cheesecakes of course are delicious, my fave is w/ the Kona liquour. Now, at one point, we went there and the cheesecake did  not taste how it was suppose to taste, I think their cooler was not working properly and the cheesecake was kind of soft and not firm.  over all, a great restaurant."
Eva H.,"San Francisco, CA",224,277,322,4.0,10/7/2011,"Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Wait: 4/5 Price: $ Presentation of food: 4/5 Presentation of restaurant: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 NO STICKY MENUS!! (so far since they opened) Came here twice, both times they offered a courtesy kids plate consist of banana and bread for my daughter (points there!). Very attentive and friendly service."
Michael C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",4,23,43,3.0,11/18/2011,"Same food as any other, good, but, come on, its a chain.  As for the one at Hillsdale mall, it is nice, probably not as nice as the one in Palo Alto, but still nice.  The server was really professional and attentive.  The service was 5 stars.  Water was always filled to the top, food came out on a timely manner.  The wait was not to bad for me and my wife, but the server mentioned sometime a 3 hour wait.  Uh, I don't think so.  I would go back, but probably in PA first. The only real problem was the drinks were completely off the mark.  They were so bad we both could not even finish them.  Maybe stick to a bottled beer or a shot."
Tina P.,"Los Altos, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/2/2015,"Slow service; wrong orders; and a bug in the food (No Joke---all of this in one lunch) We sit down for lunch today and nobody comes to our table for 10 minutes...we see a table that was seated after us get a server but nobody for us.  Just as I get up and talk to a random server (who was kind enough to say he'd take the order), I see a server come to our table.  We order.  He apologizes for the wait and all is good.  He comes a few minutes later and introduces a woman as our new server...still all is good.  We get our food...I ordered lettuce wraps which were pretty tasty but then a bug crawls out of the chicken mushroom filling...I flag the server, tell her (and show her since it is not a flying bug and still crawling on my plate).  She was very apologetic.  She offers to get a new one made for me and I said no...not interested.  The manager comes by and asks what we want.  I said ""What do you mean?  There was a bug in my food and I told the server but I never asked for a manager""..manager said it is standard for a server to call him over when there is an issue and the is sorry and would take care of us on the bill.  While all of this is going on, one item we ordered never comes to the table (our flatbread)...the flatbread comes to us 15-20 minutes after the rest of the food...I think the order was never put in properly.  After all this, I ask for the check to see how the manager ""took care of us""...they deducted the cost for the lettuce wraps with the bug...wow, so kind of them to not charge me for something I couldn't eat because it had a bug in it.  Not impressed with the manager AT ALL."
Amanda R.,"San Francisco, CA",92,162,4,3.0,3/11/2013,"This Cheesecake location is pretty comparable to all of the others I've been to. No better, no worse. My friend and I went on a Monday night and luckily didn't have to wait. The server was for the most part attentive although it did seem that she had some other things on her mind, as she overlooked things sometimes. She was great at getting our refills and did check in on us frequently. My skinnylicious enchiladas were great, and I always have to have my Oreo cheesecake (which is why I have to order from the skinnylicious menu for dinner)."
'Johnson R. H.,"San Jose, CA",271,12,57,4.0,1/15/2012,"Had a good experience at this Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale today. Was seated immediately. Was a little busy for a Monday. Would of wanted to get our order in earlier, but understandable. Daniel, our server, was very attentive during the meal. Refilled my soft drink when it ran low and checked up on us several times. Good server. EXTRA: My guest was under the weather so we ordered hot water with honey and lemon. Does the trick for a sore throat when out and about. ""Guacamole Made-To-Order"", medium ($10.50) with chips for starters. -Next time, remember to have the chips warmed. -Not much of a bite for medium spiciness. May step it up one level next time. -A bit pricy for what it is, but you do get a lot. ""Bistro Shrimp Pasta"" ($17.95). - The shrimp was prepared nice and crispy. -Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce wasn't too sour or salty. Just right! -Parmesan cheese on the side to regulate the soaking and taste effect since it is a large dish. -Pretty big portion, especially after being served the warm bread and chips. NOTE:  The servings are quite generous for 2 people, so consider shopping around mall before coming back for one of their famous cheesecakes. Anticipate taking leftovers home if you don't have a big appetite. A pleasant dinner experience. 2nd time at this site. Would go again and recommend this place to others. Remember, ""Ask and you shall receive."""
Ellen H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,229,121,3.0,8/28/2013,"The food tasted good and service was prompt- but the portion sizes have become much smaller compared to other Cheesecake Factory! We (party of 2) were seated quickly on Sunday around 1 pm. Ordered crab cakes appetizer, which were very tasty but way overpriced for three small (2.5-3 inch diameter) crabcakes. Came with 2 tasty similar dipping sauces (mayonaisse/rach style with herbs). I got the factory combination (steak diane and chicken maderia), which was delicious, but again, the food was at least 25 less than what I've received in the past. (And they don't offer a lunch portion for the combination so it's always $19.95.)  Usually it comes with a giant mound of mashed potatoes but this time I got three small scoops. The piece of chicken was smaller.  My sister got the dinner portion of a bistro shrimp pasta but the plate was smaller and the food was level (none of the usual mound of pasta). As always we enjoyed the complimentary honey wheat bread but we were still hungry after eating our entrees. With the food, a strawberry lemonade, and a coffee, the total for two for lunch came to about $75 including tax/tip. Not sure it's worth going back cause I used to be able to bring home almost half of my food as leftovers for another meal, but no more."
Eduardo F.,"Cottage Grove, WI",21,89,41,3.0,11/24/2013,"Same o same o. Know one you know it all. Service was great btw. Also all the splits and shares went very well. I just had to believe that all food is organic (which deeply, I don't think so) anyway. One recommendation is : please buy at least organic chicken."
Patrick H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/14/2016,"food is just normal. cakes are awesome. services are really bad.... serving wrong dishes, waiting too long to sit, to order, to serve, even waiting too long to pay....."
Jeff C.,"San Francisco, CA",91,153,51,3.0,9/25/2011,"Ordered a slice of original cheesecake to go. Paid and waited for about 15 minutes after i paid. The place was starting to get packed. They had about 10 workers behind the cheesecake counter and most of them seem to be confused or standing around. I guess most of these workers are new? I never had this experience at the SF one. I'll give this place a break since they are like a 4 day old establishment at this mall. I'll definitely update my experience because I plan on getting some more cheesecakes to go since i work nearby on Saturdays. The entire restaurant doesn't seem that big, but at least its in a good, easily accessible area like Hillsdale Mall."
Jennifer Y.,"San Francisco, CA",76,5,1,2.0,1/1/2014,"Sticking to the downtown sf location. Waitress barely came by, and when she did it was because she realized that she had neglected us, too late. The wait for food was understandable because it's the dinner rush, but that doesn't excuse the food coming to the table cold."
Christine D.,"San Bruno, CA",0,33,6,5.0,2/1/2014,"The Skinnylicious Menu ROCKS!  About thirty choices make it easy to eat healthy.  No cheesecake on the Skinnylicious menu, duh.  Ambience is really nice and the wait staff was very efficient.  I'll definitely be back for more."
Cornelia P.,"Hayward, CA",63,11,2,1.0,1/31/2014,"This is a review for the service I received, only.... I was dressed in my work clothes so I decided to get takeout. Well the cashier was helping a lady that was ahead of me then she walked away to get the customer's order fixed. She comes back and asked the lady that arrived after me if she could help her. That lady said she was next. Well the cashier looked at me, didn't ask if she could take my order, then looked back at the other lady... Seeing as she did not seem to want to take my order I left! When I've gone in there in my regular clothes I have not had any issues..."
Keoni U.,"Ewa Beach, HI",56,234,38,4.0,7/29/2013,Typical menu from any Cheesecake Factory. Smaller than the bigger cities. Typical BIG servings. Went here at lunch time on a Friday afternoon. Got seated right away. Server was very good and always assisted us. No complaints from me. I'd rather go to this one than SF.
Sammy A.,"San Francisco, CA",4,17,,1.0,6/10/2012,"Passed on from 2 servers, 20 mins before the server arrives. Server was nice enough. Takes the order, another 20 mins pass, I had enough got up had to go, told her charge me, she charged me full amount and I still left her a ten dollar tip. So I paid for the food I never saw. May be the cool people didnt care because I was alone? Larger parties equal higher ticket, equals better tips.  While it is understandable, it certainly not professional or ethical. Please dont treat single guests with haste, who knows I may know a lot of people."
Fran A.,"San Bruno, CA",6,46,,3.0,11/5/2014,"We arrived at 5:30 and asked to be seated around 6:00 or when our party of 12 arrives. The hostess said it wasn't a problem then a minute later, said to come back at 5:45 cause our waiter would come in at 6:00. Our party was complete by 5:50 and yet they didn't want to seat us because our waiter hasn't arrived for his shift yet. Customers waiting for a waiter to clock in?! Never had that happen. We were all so hungry already. However, our waiter knew the menu pretty well and we were served food fast. Their birthday surprise song was only done by our waiter and wasn't fun at all. No free anything, either. Not worth the price. Desserts are good tho."
Albert C.,"Millbrae, CA",0,42,,1.0,11/5/2013,"Was in late afternoon and it was not busy.  But, the service was slow and servers lacked interest.  Ordered pizza and hamburger (Classic).  Took 25 minutes for pizza to come and was only warm. Then had to wait for another 10 minutes for the burger to come.  It was fine.   Asked for mustard and it had only French's. Disappointing experience.  Food and service used to be much better.  Would not recommend."
Vlad M.,"San Francisco, CA",550,115,221,2.0,2/4/2013,"I called in and placed an ordered ahead as I was in a time crunch and barely had any time to spare. I was told the order would be made within 15-20 minutes, but when I arrived exactly 20 minutes later I was made to wait another 15 minutes."
Brent D.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,1,,1.0,1/19/2016,"The only good thing about our meal was the waiter. The hostesses were very disorganized. We ended up waiting for more than an hour to get a table, even though they said it'd take 30 minutes. I saw other people with larger parties and without reservations get a table before me. When I pointed that out, they finally printed off our seating ticket. Then they lost it before we got seated, so we ended up waiting for another fifteen minutes. After having them find our name three more times we finally got our table. The waiter was helpful and attentive. The food was a big letdown however. It was bland and tasteless. I had a pasta dish and it was pretty bad. It had a lot of oil in it but with very little cheese, cream, or garlic. I've been to a lot of cheesecake factories in the past and the food was usually consistent at the very least. I will almost definitely eat at a Cheesecake Factory in the future, just not this one."
Teresa L.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/6/2015,"My family and I went for dinner last night.  It started out okay with good service at 6:00 pm.  It was not busy.  After our dinner was served and we finished our meal.  We decided to have dessert.  It was already 7:30 pm and we had waited approx. 20 mins. before the dessert arrived.  Then waited again for the bill.  By this time it was already past 8:00 pm.  The Waiter did not come back to collect our dinner money.  I decided to tell my family to leave.  in this case, how much of a 'Tip 'should we have given to the Waiter?"
