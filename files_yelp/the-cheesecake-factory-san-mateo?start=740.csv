Milana R.,"San Francisco, CA",19,63,,4.0,4/7/2013,Food and ambience is great. I have been here multiple times. Its not just about the cheesecake but their food menu is awesome with a nice variety.
Cheyanne M.,"Burlingame, CA",25,22,48,4.0,1/22/2013,Very nice setting. The customer service was good. We had a stroller and were seated somewhere where the stroller did not fit so they let us move to a spot where there was more then enough room for us to park our stroller right next to the table so the sleeping baby didn't have to be moved. Not to mention our food was delicious.
Z G.,"Redwood City, CA",1,5,,1.0,4/6/2013,"Server: Todd. Unfortunately our server was cold and arrogant, and checked on us once during our entire visit. We're easygoing people, but come on. 'You work at a Cheesecake Factory, in a mall. Get over yourself.'"
Ashley M.,"Pacifica, CA",3,19,1,2.0,1/11/2015,"The menu was lengthy and the food was good, but the service was so slow and we were there at 9pm on a weekday.  The host stand was probably the most annoying part- we put our names on the list and he said it would take about 10-15 minutes. We walked outside for some air, came back in 5. Waiting inside for another 10 where we realized everyone who came in after us was already seated. I asked the host and he said he called us. Well... Thanks for the accurate time estimate and checking again- especially since I know 6 people in the waiting area makes things confusing. And Cheesecake, please get with the times and either take reservations or let people call ahead. ALL other restaurants, even in malls, do it. You're slacking."
Sheila B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,20,3,5.0,1/9/2015,First time here and loved the kids' menu! I didn't realize how casual it was and didn't know it was so kid friendly. The menu is extremely extensive and the variety is almost overwhelming at times. I highly recommend this place for large groups or families with multiple kids. And the bloody marys are great also. Cheers!
Vanessa N.,"San Mateo, CA",58,3,,2.0,10/26/2013,"Recently went to this location and sat at the bar. Our server was, shall I say, less than stellar and often ignored us, or forgot simple requests (such as a to-go box for leftovers). She even neglected to bring my friends appetizer and gave attitude when she asked about it after everyone was finishing up.  In a nutshell:  service was definitely suffering."
Andrew L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/6/2015,"Came here for a birthday dinner. Called ahead for a reservation but they don't make reservations, not even for big parties. The girl advised to get here an hour before, which sounded reasonable. After putting our name down we waited 1.5 hours before returning to the desk and asking how much longer. The kid at the desk said about 15 min. 15 min later we went to ask again and he said another 30min. At this point our group of 12 was starving and dissatisfied with the service. We complained and spoke to a manager and he gave us free bread while we waited another 20min. This will be our last time here and I would advise against coming here unless you have time to kill and you aren't very hungry."
Kieran P.,"Belmont, CA",7,20,,5.0,10/19/2013,This place is absolutely amazing! I come here all the time! The bread is sooo good! The pasta is great to! Also the filet mignonette is good!
Fumi N.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2014,I called in advance to place an order for take out. I arrived 15 mins later and found out that my order wasn't placed! The manager came out and told me that there was an accident in the kitchen and so my order wasn't placed. I ended up waiting for more than 30mins after I got there. What a service. No apology.
Grace L.,"Anchorage, AK",1,4,,1.0,12/28/2014,"After giving me a 1 hour wait time for my party, I was immediately re-told it would be 2.5 hours. We shaved our party down in number and were given a new estimate of 1.5 hours. After deliberating less than 5 minutes of whether we wanted to wait that long, we were told the wait would be 2.5 hours instead. There are plenty of better establishments happy to take our business."
Justin G.,"San Mateo, CA",18,126,17,2.0,11/19/2012,THIS PLACE SUCKS BAD. Went here for me and my wife anniversary yesterday I ordered a kids pizza( bc our daughter was with us) egg rolls and  Alfredo pasta. egg rolls and Alfredo pasta were delicious. But my daughter's pizza was very burnt on the bottom and the crust got stuck to the plate.  Our server was the best she was understanding and comped my daughter's pizza. I work at the mall and this is bad for the mall. I guess I'll go to the one in San Francisco much nicer for little longer wait.
Christopher W.,"San Mateo, CA",26,5,,4.0,9/8/2013,"Convenient that it opens at 10am on Sunday - nice place to chill for a quick brunch, a tasty icy cold beer, and some football before mall opens."
S M.,"Redwood City, CA",2,26,,3.0,11/14/2013,"Go for the cheesecake.  Don't go for the service or the food.  If you get a good server, you'll be in luck.  If you don't...I feel for you. As for the food, it's not awful, but it's not that great either.  And the wait times are ridiculous."
Jay C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,16,,4.0,1/13/2014,"I used this restaurant for take out this week and I really enjoyed the food. I ordered  the food on phone and reached there at the time they gave me, I did not have to wait much to make a payment and get the food. Food was really great. Pasta was a bit less cooked, slightly harder, but otherwise good. Packing, presentation and everything else was professional.  Personnel at the pickup desk was friendly and served with a smile."
Jordan L.,"Belmont, CA",44,1,,4.0,8/8/2013,"I may be a little bit biased since I am an ex-employee, but if anything - the fact that I don't completely hate this place should really say something about this Cheesecake Factory. There are several things on the Cheesecake Menu that are worth talking about, but my three all-time favorites are the Miso Salmon, The Orange Chicken, and the Gumbo. All three of these dishes are spot on when it comes to taste, portion, and presentation.  The Miso Salmon, which I recommend to get in the lunch size since its 6 bucks cheaper and is roughly the same size, is a typical Asian-style Salmon with a delicious glaze of something that resembles Teriyaki sauce and a Miso-based sauce. Tastes great every time. The Orange Chicken (lunch size) at this Cheesecake is cooked to perfection with an excellent blend of Crispiness and juicy chicken. With a side of rice and vegetables its a simple, yet delicious plate. Lastly, the Gumbo. A new-found favorite! I tried this dish after trying many Gumbos from other restaurants - Kingfish being one of them, and man did this one stand out. The New Orleans classic was an amazing blend of spices and flavors that was served extremely hot (temperature), which is how it should be served. I had it with white rice, but used a whole loaf of sourdough and rye bread to help me take down this massive plate. I was only able to finish half. As for the Cheesecakes, I personally can't handle extremely sweet items, so I would recommend the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake or the Vanilla Bean, those ones are better suited for the sweet-sensitive eaters like myself.  I give this a 4/5 stars for the delicious food and amazing service (depending on the servers - most give amazing service)."
Matthew V.,"Abilene, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2014,"If I could give this no stars I would. Worst Cheesecake Factory  experience. First it took our server 15 mins to even come over and introduce herself and ask us what we wanted to drink. Then another 10 to bring our waters and the glasses were filthy. It wasn't like she was slammed. She only had four tables in her section. We order my daughter corn dog and French fries and the fries were ice cold so we sent them back and they came back luke warm. My food was gross. My wife's soup was watery, her bread for her sandwich was stale. We ran out of water half way through our meal and we had to ask other people for things. We didn't see our waiter till she brought the check. Never going back."
Nancy L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,1,5.0,7/19/2013,"This review is specifically for the service, because in terms of food - if you're going to the Cheesecake Factory, you pretty much know what you're getting. I was at this restaurant yesterday for lunch and it was several adults and three small children.  Now, eating out with young children can get crazy.  But Khai was our server and she was fantastic.  For example, when she brought over the bread basket, she also brought a plate with the bread cut up into smaller sizes for the children.  The plate also had cut up banana pieces on it - a very nice touch for the kids.  She always kept our water filled and was attentive and personable.  Thank you, Khai!"
Annie G.,"San Mateo, CA",104,59,43,3.0,9/3/2012,"The wait is just too overwhelmed !!  The food was ok. The cheese cake was not the best I've had. I had the Tuna salad last time I was there and it was pretty good. My friend had the prime rib, but it was a bit dry. The onion rings had too much flour. The upside is: it's located in the mall, so while you're waiting for your table which usually takes about 30-60 minutes, you can go shopping and then come back."
Michele H.,"San Francisco, CA",37,406,20,3.0,7/29/2012,"This is a great place to go with a group of people who can't decide what type of food they want to eat. they have everything, a little bit of Italian, American, Mexican, Asian...you name it, they have it. I really liked my Indian bread sandwich. But I have to say that I was very disappointed with  the red velvet didn't cheesecake. it didn't have much flavor just very sweet, but I guess that's how most people like it. We also had some sort of fudgy chocolate cheesecake which was by far a much bigger hit with our group. Overall, it a solid three stars. It's a chain restaurant so you get what you pay for, but as far as chain restaurants go this one is pretty decent."
Kevin W.,"Millbrae, CA",50,7,5,5.0,6/23/2013,Went to have dinner with some friends and was promptly greeted by a friendly hosting staff that escorted me and friends to a table and then we were introduced to a gentleman named Mike S he was friendly and courteous. He was always smiling and was full of energy! Overall the experience was amazing. Will defiantly go back hope we get sat in Mikes section again!
