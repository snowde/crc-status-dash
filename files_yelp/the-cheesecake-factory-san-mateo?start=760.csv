Jennifer H.,"San Mateo, CA",94,7,,2.0,6/22/2013,Loud. Crowded. Cookie cutter food.  Predictable if you like that sort of predictability....
The N.,"San Jose, CA",1,25,,4.0,11/6/2013,I like the cheesecake chain and I love the fact that they have their calorie info on the menu - it keeps me in check . Good food. I love the sheppards pie. There is a closed patio seating thing which is not temperature controlled and has an uninteresting view of the parking lot. We were seated it there initially but we told the hostess we didn't like it and she graciously re-seated us. The service was good. The food it came in quickly. My glass was kept full and refills were brought over promptly . It was a pleasant experience in all.
Leticia L.,"Redwood City, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/29/2014,"I was excited to come eat here because I love the Cheesecake Factory, but it was such a bad experience. I sit at the bar with my boyfriend in the bar section and we literally waited about 20 minutes before we left. No one came to us, or even brought us menus and there were waiters passing by the whole time. I'm very patient, but what really ticked me off was that a group of girls sit right next to us, maybe a few inches away, and the waiter comes to them and takes their order! I was flabbergasted because we were, no joke, right next to them. It was awful, the staff at the bar was just wow. I wish I would've complained to the manager, then at least we'd get something free. #badservice"
loulou p.,"Redwood City, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/9/2012,"Went here with a group of friends last week Friday. ( around 8:30) The waiter was very disinterested in serving us. Even though we were ordering dinner, our server never brought water or bread basket. We had to ask for it.  Since we were close to a pay station I could hear him say, ""I am so out of here soon"" I am not sure what he meant by this. We had to ask for water / drink refills . My friends were drinking alcohol he never came to ask they need a new glass.   I thought cheese cake factory hired people with better customer service than this."
Roberto A.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",288,25,18,4.0,4/11/2012,"Very busy, my applause to the staff as we were seated in a timely fashion with a group of ten. The food was better than average for a chain, very filling , large portions, the issue is overfeeding, no room left to try the variety of Cheesecakes."
Morgan F.,"Redwood City, CA",0,16,1,2.0,10/17/2013,"This restaurant is normally pretty good, but their takeout is horrible. The portions are smaller and the servers tend to not care.  I've ordered takeout 3 times and all 3 times my order has either been wrong, portion super small, or they forgot something. Very disappointing."
Christina W.,"Norcross, GA",0,26,,1.0,11/24/2015,"Usually love this restaurant.  Not sure what the problem is recently.  Went to dinner there on Sunday night.  They told us it was a 20 minute wait.  When we sat down we saw that half of the tables were empty.  We ordered dinner.  They brought the first member of our party her dish, ten minutes later they brought the second member of our party her dinner, five minutes later the third person got her dinner, and 30 minutes later they brought my dinner.  I had to ask for my dinner three times.  They told me that they had accidentally taken my dinner to another table, even though it was special order, and that they were making me another dinner immediately.  Wasn't true.  When my dinner arrived it wasn't hot.  It wasn't even warm.  I'm almost finished with my dinner and the waitress walks up with another plate full of fish tacos.  At this point just had to ask, are you kidding?  Then they tried to bill us for both orders of fish tacos.  Going to be a long time before we head back to The Cheesecake Factory.  They need to get their act together.  They may be the favor of the month at Hillsdale, but there's always another restaurant waiting to take their patrons."
N O.,"San Mateo, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/26/2011,"Opted for open seating in bar on Black Friday eve. Ordered draft beer ($6.50) and Lemon Drop ($11), the latter tasted like a glass full of simple syrup with a splash of gin,  Small basket of bread for two was great, while order of Guacamole and chips was not.Guacamole  tasted like lawn grass, probably because underripe avocado used.  Wait staff pleasant, decor nice as with all Cheesecake Factories. Use caution with expensive drink and appetizer selection."
Lisa T.,"San Francisco, CA",37,56,98,3.0,11/16/2012,"I came here for dessert and had their original cheesecake with ice cream. I only ate the ice cream because I realized I don't really like cheesecake, but there's not much I can say about this place. The service is great though! and you can park in the garage."
Margaret L.,"San Jose, CA",32,110,3,3.0,1/6/2013,Floors seemed a bit slippery. I wore rubber soled shoes and they still slipped on the floor. I do love the service there though. Food portions are large and fit for two.
Scott B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,10,5,5.0,6/25/2013,"Excellent as always.  Our server, Brittney, flirted with outlet 17 month old the entire time and he loved it.  She even brought him bananas and bread, which immediately calmed him down.  Service and food were above average and seeing that we don't have a CCF in Alaska, this was the only chance we get to eat here in 2 years.  Loved it!!"
Gris G.,"San Bruno, CA",2,90,12,2.0,8/24/2012,"I have visited this restaurant 3 times. First time, long wait. Had fish and chips and the original strawberry cheesecake. Service was good. Food was good. Second time, we arrived after 8 pm and wait time was not more than 20 minutes I had the pulled pork sandwich Apple cheesecake, service was OK. We got our appetizer at the same time as our meal, so we had to send it back.  Third (and last time), wait was about 40 minutes. Finally got to try the pear and blue cheese flat bread, this was yummy. And it arrived on time, before our meal. I had a shrimp and veggie pasta meal and the macadamia nut cheesecake. The service was OK. But both my husband and I got sick that night. He ordered the Salisbury's steak, so I am not sure what made us sick. I did notice that the wait staff is very young, sometimes this is good because they're energetic, but I worry about cleanliness.... I really wish they had a ""No Flash"" policy for parties, we got blinded throughout our meal and I know our neighbors did too, because a large party on the other side kept taking pictures and the flash was so strong it looked like we were in the middle of a lightning. This also happened on our second time there. I know a large party brings lots of money in a bigger check, but atmosphere should be pleasant to all.  I don't think I would go back, too long of a wait for average tasting food. I would maybe order cheesecake to go."
Chloe C.,Bay Area,0,17,2,1.0,3/26/2012,"3/25/12.... Told our server that we were just snacking so we ordered one appetizer, slice of cheesecake and two beverages. Tables ordered after us, got their food and finished their meal before we got our appetizer. The manager took it upon himself to take off the appetizer off of my bill.... It will be long time before I dine there again...."
Brown D.,"Vallejo, CA",0,21,,3.0,3/31/2012,"I would give this a better review if I didn't have a bad experience with one of the hostesses thinking she was too important to acknowledge me and ignore me once everyone around her had already been seated, thank goodness there was another hostesses available for us to be seated. I am a common visitor of the cheesecake factory and have visited a number of locations through the state and one in another one and so far since this had opened in September, the service and food has been acceptable. Since this being the cheesecake factory, the quality of service could vary depending on the moods of the servers as well as the night visited based on the number of customers that had decided to dine in that evening. On several occassions I've found myself order such dishes as one of their delectable steaks, or a specialty pasta which would be accompanied by appetizers such as macaroni and cheese bites, nachos, tex mex eggrolls yet as far as the korean bbq tacos i didn't care much for those. Ending the night with a slice of their signature cheesecakes is a must have, yet don't be suprised if the total by the end of the night sends a chill down your spine since being the cheesecake factory, shouldn't suprise you that it'd be quite pricy so plan on going if your looking for a fancy night out and not if your just looking for a place to have a lovely dinner at an economists budget."
Ashley M.,"Burlingame, CA",1,24,6,4.0,10/6/2011,"Well - it is what it is!! Cheesecake factory, happy to enjoy their food LOCALLY now.. Hence the 4th star. Service - OK. Manager came out to apologize for the wait, but hey, their a new staff at a new location - I can understand them having to smooth out the bumps before they get this quick transactional thing down. The only thing is, I would have appreciated the complimentary cheesecake or appetizer like everyone else I talked to who ran into the same problem.  Oh well, guess I was saved calories?! Cajun Chicken Littles = Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and two dipping sauces. Not bad, i enjoy chicken strips and i am a dipper!! Although I was confused by the title and maybe its from my lack of having seen 'little's' on the menu before, but i was expecting hunks of chicken breast in a spicy cajun sauce. Having got something completely different, was still satisfied. Tasty, tasty, tasty, but we knew that already right? I mean, its the cheesecake factory!!"
Agustinus T.,"San Mateo, CA",60,245,15,3.0,9/18/2012,Huge menu with average quality. Good service and convenient for chatting. Cheesecake flavors to get: banana cream and vanilla bean.
Shana S.,"Edmonton, Canada",2,26,,1.0,5/25/2012,"Terrible service & food poisoning! If I could give this restaurant a zero I would. Took 40 minutes for a hamburger and 2 Greek Salads. The server never came to our table except to take our order and take care of the bill. When I talked to the manager he could care less about our inconvenience and to top it off, my daughter got food poisoning from 1/3 of the hamburger she ate. Good thing she didn't finish it. Because the manager didn't care about our poor experience I thought corporate might. So I emailed them and told them of the experience & food poisoning. Two days since sending it and not a single word from them. I think it is clear where the poor service stems from. On a slight positive, the food we had tasted pretty good, just not good enough to be poisoned."
Ashley R.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,6,5.0,5/31/2012,My waiter was wonderful; I expected a wait since it's the cheesecake factory and the food was awesome! I love this spot. I was with a party of 10 and we wait about 20-25 minutes. It was so busy in there and a great vibe. I know other reviews are mad but give it a rest; they're new and the biggest restaurant around. Will be back for sure!
Sallie G.,"San Carlos, CA",2,13,,1.0,4/29/2012,"Waited 10 minutes to order take out because the cashiers were too busy having a conversation. Like the food choices, but the staff is poorly trained."
Racquel R.,"San Carlos, CA",12,106,35,2.0,11/4/2011,"I would have given it one star except that I added a second star because it just opened recently.  So maybe they're still working out the kinks. I've been to many a Cheesecake Factory in various parts of the state and even out of state and this location had the worst service.  I always order the same thing from their enormous menu.  Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  We checked in for lunch thinking that it would be relatively quick for a sit-down place.  Not so.  2 hours later, and lots of ""I'm so sorry"", ""I don't know why it's taking so long"", ""Can I get you more bread?"", ""More salad?""  Our waitress tried to do the best with the situation. But it looked like lots of other people were waiting for their orders, as we all looked from each other to the kitchen.  What's going on back there?  Ummm...where's our food?  Anyhow, they felt so bad, they comped one meal and left me to pay for mine, which ended up getting put into a to-go container because it was supposed to be our lunch and 2 hours was too long.  Then the pizza my friend ordered wasn't the right one!  WHAT??? Ok, that's it.   I decided not worth it. Definitely not worth it. If they can't get their act together...it's not worth going. Not even for the cheesecake!"
