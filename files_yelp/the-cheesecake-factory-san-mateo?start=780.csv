Chase L.,"San Francisco, CA",97,111,22,4.0,9/9/2012,"If you like Cheesecake Factory, you'll love this place! I came in with a small group of friends, and we were taken care of by the amazing Jessica. We actually had a little chat with her and learned that she just moved to the Bay Area. She is amazing! Everything on the menu is amazing, as well. I would definitely suggest the Fried Mac & Cheese and the Buffalo Blasts! We will be coming back often!"
Nicole C.,"Belmont, CA",0,15,6,3.0,1/8/2014,The food isn't terrible here but it isn't amazing either. My brother and his girlfriend got food poisoning here...twice.
Raymond Q.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,12,1,3.0,8/18/2014,"Decent food, usually good service. Bread happened to be out most of the time when we were there. Is this by desire? I rather they don't offer it instead of out all the time!"
John M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,22,,2.0,4/11/2012,"One star for the amazing cheesecake and one star for the decor and being an overall improvement over Mervyns. This place is a bit of a paradox - loud, horrible service, long waits, rich mediocre food which takes about 45 min. to get -- yet it is always busy.  Long story short: Do what many others do -- just get your cheesecake to go."
Wendy C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,236,2,3.0,6/4/2014,"Service is great, and the wait is long. Food portion has definitely reduced since it first opened. Food is just ok and nothing special.  I like the angel hair with shrimp and the avocado egg roll. I know this place is also known for its cheesecake, but it is slightly sweeter than how I like it."
C K.,"San Mateo, CA",143,30,6,3.0,9/25/2011,"Huge selection of food, modern decor, fun ambiance.  What's the problem?  The food tastes just OK.  This is a welcome addition to the Hillsdale Shopping Center.  Good place to go for drinks.  I had the filet mignon, it had too much fat on it and wasn't cooked as ordered."
Tanechka A.,"Belmont, CA",81,9,13,3.0,10/23/2012,Been going to this restaurant n love the food and dessert. Was craving for the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake so drove down there to give into our cravings. Took home a slice of this cheesecake and a slice of Linda's chocolate cake...disappointed to find that the Red Velvet cheesecake was burnt. The top layer of the cake was ok but the bottom layer was not even color red but brown and taste was not good at all. Overall taste of cheesecake was like eating dry burnt bread with cream cheese. I give it a 3 star because the Chocolate cake was still good.
Cecily B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,3,,4.0,9/6/2014,"Since I live nearby, I've been to this location four or five times. I've never had an issue. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory before, you know what it's like. The food is always good, and despite what people are saying here, I've never had trouble with the service. They are very nice and professional. Depending on where you sit- and how busy it is- it can be pretty loud. But that's to be expected and it wasn't completely ridiculous. A great restaurant if you're looking for something good and moderately priced."
Jay J.,"Santa Clara, CA",194,139,62,1.0,11/4/2011,I live around the corner from CheeseCake and the traffic is rediculous and the wait is even worse. I cant imagine what the Holidays will bring.
Kristinna B.,"San Mateo, CA",174,65,,5.0,9/23/2011,"i'll keep it short & simple... food was amazzzzzing, the garlic noodles is to die for and the red velvet cheesecake has me speechless...yummmmm! but the service was great...our waitress was a girl named NHINA Q., and she was wonderful. i didn't like that the supervisors or whatever they're called were all in her face when she was serving us or taking our order because it made me nervous for her, but i guess they were training her. but definitely if you go here please ask for nina, even though it just opened and she's new, she gave excellent service, i even made it a point to let her manager know. finally we have a cheesecake factory in san mateo..woo woo!!! :-p"
Cole S.,"San Mateo, CA",297,4,,1.0,10/16/2011,"What a HORRIBLE excuse for a restaurant, especially for one that is a chain restaurant.  I ordered my favorite cheesecake, chocolate raspberry truffle, as my birthday cake.  Since it is available at the location in San Francisco and in Palo Alto, I came to the conclusion that it would be on their menu.  Apparently I was wrong!  I got white chocolate raspberry truffle instead.  Now that might seem okay to you, reader, but I get nauseated and vomit when I eat white chocolate.  So, as I am here writing this review for a HORRIBLE restaurant I am having to keep myself from vomiting onto my computer.  Either get better or leave!!"
Jim C.,"Redwood City, CA",150,1366,711,3.0,11/13/2011,30 min wait on a saturday afternoon at 3pm? lame.  bottom line: love cheesecake factory and happy you now are in san mateo but  you're not worth the wait in the middle of a sat afternoon.
Sarah N.,"San Francisco, CA",21,74,26,2.0,12/22/2011,"I haven't had CF in awhile, and this was the 2nd time ever eating at the San Mateo one..SF pride to the fullest and will wait 2hrs to devour some CF at the SF UnionSq location.   It was a 40 min wait for 6ppl, average wait, but the place wasn't full enough for a 40min wait.  As we waited my party and I observed the workers, from the hostess to the waiters/waitresses...everyone seemed in ""slowmotion status"".  Idk if today was an ""off"" day for SanMateo folks but everyone seemed to not care about the customers.   We were finally seated, our waitress took about 10min to take our drink/app orders.  When she finally brought our drinks she took our meal orders...I ordered the bbq ranch chicken salad, no beans and substitute the chicken w/ grilled salmon.  She left and 30 mins later returned with our food orders...my order was incorrect, it came with an herb crusted STEAMED salmon and COLD, like it just came out of the refrigerator.  Told our waitress I asked for my salmon GRILLED and she apologetically obliged to get my salad fixed...30 mins later after the rest of my party had finished their food MY salad comes.  It literally takes only 3-4mins on each side to perfectly grill a piece of SALMON dammit.  WTF!!!  Anyway - as most ppl I know I'm very crabby when I'm hungry, my salad comes WITHOUT DRESSING!!!  OMG!!  so it takes our waitress 10 mins to get a side of dressing...my cousin requested for a glass of water and it took another 10mins for water...my husband ordered a refill of soda and got a glass full of ice and a splash of coke...My son ordered mac n cheese and it was literally only noodles, tasteless and barely any cheese.   My husband told the waitress that I should be comped for my salad, she discussed it w/her manager and agreed.   CF workers, please work on some customer service skills, be more personable, upbeat and outgoing - if you hate your job, get a new one bc if you rely on tips then an attitude like yours won't get you much-just sayin' note to self::  city folks should NOT eat in the BURBS!!!  the city has it all....but in my defense, I wanted to chk out the mall with the new ""upgrades""...not impressed!!"
Sharjah M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,132,97,3.0,5/18/2012,"I usually come to Cheesecake Factory with my one friend who's in love with Cheesecake Factory restaurant! We came here for lunch for the first time at this location.  It wasn't busy like it would be on the weekends I bet.  We were immediately seated since it was still early afternoon.  My friend ordered the spinach dip and I ordered the fried macaroni and cheese.  I been hearing their mac and cheese is  ! So I decided to try it out this time.  When we received our orders my fried macaroni and cheese came in meatball forms.  Turns out that's how its fried and its on top of marinara sauce.  It tasted ok but it was just an overload of carbs.  My friend's spinach dip tasted like any other similar to Chili's.  So it was alright.  I usually look forward to their desert and I ordered the same cheesecake because I love it so much.  The White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  There were other cheesecakes that sound appealing but I like this one by far!  Overall, servers are friendly and my friend and I are willing to come back to this location but not during busy peak hours where we have to wait for one hour.  That's a no-no!"
Roxanne R.,"San Carlos, CA",35,10,3,5.0,1/2/2013,I love cheesecake Factory  so much. Its my favor place to go to. Since we celebrate one of  friends B-day there.
edward k.,"Ambler, PA",0,49,,3.0,7/2/2014,"Travel for biz and eat at Cheesecake Factories periodically. Their key lime cheesecake is beyond incredible. Food is always consistent...certainly not high end dining, but consistent at a fair price. Went to this Cheesecake Factory recently, sat at the bar to eat and had terrible service. Seemed the bartenders (1 guy and 1 girl) were far more interested in the soccer game on TV and each other, then they were interested in serving me. I was 1 of 2 customers at the bar, so it was certainly not busy. East coast guy on the west coast, so I am eating at like 4pm PST. Paid the bill and split...probably never to return to this Cheesecake Factory again."
Mary Ann S.,"Daly City, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/8/2015,"I went to the front desk to make a reservation for two, gave my name, and she said it would be an hour wait and would call my name.  We went around the mall to kill some time.  We came back 20 minutes later and saw she was giving reservation pagers to people but she did not  even offer me one when I made my reservation.  I went up to the desk and then she asked if I wanted one, but I didn't see her enter any info and just handed me one.  So we waited another 50 minutes at least and nothing, so I went to the front desk to ask and told her it was over an hour.  She checked in the computer and all of a sudden I'm next.  It looked like she screwed up because now all of a sudden I'm next.  The waiter dropped my fries.  They didn't have the pineapple upside down cheesecake that my friend likes (the only reason we went there in the first place), but they had it on all the menus including online.  The food was mediocre and overpriced, not worth the wait.  I would not go to this place again!"
Monica T.,"Hayward, CA",0,38,1,4.0,7/16/2012,I love this Cheesecake Factory! Ive been here more than a couple times and I haven't had a problem with it so far. Our wait time to be seated doesn't take long and our waiters are always friendly. I can never go wrong with the Chicken Cacciatore! Try the Upside Down Pineapple Cheesecake if you haven't already.
Joe D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,8,1,4.0,2/4/2013,"The chicken salad sandwich was really good tonight.  As always, the cheesecake (had them all, tonight was Oreo Dream) was awesome. Not 5 starts on this particular night as the Ffloor was really dirty - like greasy dirty.  I was slipping everywhere.  One man at the bar who was sitting on the front of his chair too far had the chair slip out from under him and fall to the floor.  No damage done but really should try to keep the already slick floor less greasy."
Abi U.,"Fremont, CA",228,304,3,3.0,10/10/2011,"My husband spoke with one of the people in their corporate office and they offered their apologies. Today they mailed over a letter in writing thanking him for his feedback, more apologies, and sent him a gift card for the amount of his initial take out order. Although this doesn't make everything right it does show that CF is committed to providing good service. I hope that this location really starts to shape up now that it has had its doors open for a few weeks. YAY for upper management :)"
