Stephanie M.,"San Bruno, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/20/2017,I tried calling only to be put on a 15 minute wait and after calling back finally had my order taken. I get there and I'm told my food isn't ready. 45 minutes later I approach the guy who had previously rang me up and he tells me my food is ready. My food was just sitting there while he talked it up with his coworker. Like I shouldn't have to ask if my food is ready.  Seriously who makes someone wait 45 minutes for their food that they had already ordered over the phone!
Larry N.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,3,2,1.0,7/23/2017,"It was about 6:00pm when we got seated, so I ordered the food while my wife went out to pick up her items from the store, I ordered house wine,  Fry Calamari, Little House Salad, Cuban Roll, Saute Spinach, with Specialty-Pasta Shrimp Angel Hair, first the salad has no dressing ,so we ask the waiter to bring and told the waiter about the saggy veggie, he apology that is no offer to change but brought the dressing, my wife never finished the salad, the Cuban roll was soft, unlike the menu said crispy, the specialty pasta shrimp angel hair was put on the table, I tasted the shirmp it was very dry, and the angel hair pasta was cold, so I turn it back for an hot one, when It came back the angel hair pasta was hot but it was so soft that is no way I can eat pasta like tofu, so I called the manager, she came & apologize, ask do I wanted to get another one I said yes, it toke about another 35 minutes to get on the table just about we wanted to leave, also the manger ask me what else do I wanted, I tild her please get me another house wine while I wait for the pasta she totally forgot  and I have to order the wine from the waiter, at last the sauteed spinach I ordered at the first time ordering was never made to the table,  I was so disappointed I  don't even brother to ask anymore, so when the pasta came I just pack it to go and pay the bill and go home, and its was birthday weekend with this restaurant, other cheesecake factory I be all have good experiences.  It was a very busy night, but no excuses for what happen to me about this bad food and bad manager treatment of forgotten my order of wine which she ask me what else can she get me., I got out there about 7:30 p.m what a dinner."
Rachel S.,"Saratoga, CA",11,9,,2.0,7/24/2017,Curbside has good service but unauthorized cars parking there are not the restaurant's fault. Owner of mall needs to add more handicapped spots and monitor spots when traffic is high. So now I don't ever go thinking I'll actually get a curbside spot. Even during the week!!!
Joy L.,"East Bay, CA",36,64,59,2.0,7/7/2017,"Yeah...I have to agree with the other reviews of this location. Typically you cannot go wrong with Cheesecake Factory, but the service here is awful and the food is not up to the standards of the chain. Bleh. I won't return to this location."
Donna H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,63,2,2.0,12/28/2016,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory several times and this is my usual location. I've been craving cake for a couple days and happened to be at the mall so I figured I'd grab a few slices on my way home. I stood at the counter for like 10 minutes before one of the workers came near the counter to give someone else an order. He turned to walk away and I called out to him by saying ""excuse me"". He simply said ""I'm not a cashier"" and turned around and walked away before I could ask him where I could go to order. I stood there for about 5 more minutes but neither one of the two people behind the counter turned around at all. I walked away and the person who walked up after me looked to be in the conundrum. I walked over to the hostess stand to ask where I could place an order but she was taking a very long time checking people in and she looked annoyed as each person walked up.. So I decided it wasn't worth it and I just left. Horrible customer service. Annoying because I really wanted to get some cake!  Giving one courtesy star because I do usually enjoy their food."
Nicholas H.,"San Francisco, CA",196,73,26,1.0,5/16/2016,"Superlative - a word that means of the highest quality, supreme or above all; a word that does not apply to Cheesecake Factory. I came in with my family the day before Mother's day. I have always been dubious of the Cheesecake Factory, but this visit will be my last.  SERVICE 1/5: We were served by a gentleman with glasses. Not so sure what his name was, but if he is reading this review, he will know. When we first sat down, we already notice that a set of utensils were missing - I asked the waiter and he quickly forgot about it. He would disappear for long periods of time without checking up on us. Whenever we had our waters refilled, received bread or butter, it was only because we asked him to. I understand that that the restaurant was busy, so that was not the biggest issue.  FOOD 1/5: If it were possible to give 0 stars, it would have definitely happened here. I ordered the fish and chips lunch, while my SO ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries. When the dishes came, the dishes looked fine. However, after taking a bite of the fish, it was the exact opposite of fine. I am not even sure what I ate till this day - the fish tasted very off. I would rather order a filet-o-fish from McDonald's at this point. The biggest issue was the sweet potato fries. We told our consistently absent waiter that the sweet potato fries were both cold and soggy, a very bad combo for sweet potato fries. He didn't apologize for the quality of the food and disappeared for another 15 minutes. When he came back, he gave us the SAME order + more of the cold fries.  When he dropped off the check, our waiter never apologized or said thank you. Well, thank you for letting me know where to eat for next lunch - not Cheesecake Factory.  No tip."
Vivian N.,"Daly City, CA",40,17,26,1.0,5/22/2016,You wonder why this Place had 3 star... seriously... our waitress have no energy... can't get serve ( we have to walk straight to kitchen to ask for)  Our plate dirty... got new one and dirty too.... ( wonder if they're wash dishes)  Don't know if we will come back here again.
Tomas P.,"San Carlos, CA",76,340,71,4.0,1/24/2017,I've had good experiences with the service here! The food is just what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory: great quality at reasonable prices. Unfortunately the biggest problem was when a table next to us asked their bill to be split 9 ways. The server had to follow their request but that slowed everything else down for 15-20 minutes. If Cheesecake Factory has no rules against a request like that then they should also be ready to backfill whenever an unreasonable request like that comes up. Instead it just made the experience worse for other patrons.
Ta S.,"San Mateo, CA",96,41,55,1.0,1/7/2017,"I love this place. But recently when I've ordered take out, they seem to take forever with it. Over the phone after they take our order they say ""it'll be ready in about 15 minutes"" I only live down the street from here so I always take my time! I don't usually leave my house until 15-20 mins after and then drive over which takes about another 5 minutes. When I get there I pay and then stand around for another 20 mins. They need more structure at the take out register. All I ordered was 2 slices of cheesecake. I called in my order at 9:45 and didn't get my 2 slices until 10:30! It shouldn't take 45 mins for 2 slices of cheesecake!"
镱逾,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/30/2017,"This restaurant never disappoint me. Everything is pretty good,especially the cheese cake! Highly recommend the grilled Salmon and the Steak. Also,the service is good, all the server I met in this restaurant was nice. Will definitely come here again."
Hank F.,"Rialto, CA",20,21,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Once you're seated here wait 15 minutes for a waiter, sometimes another 45 for your food. Comes out cold. Third time with same results is why I'm finally rating this location. I've never had problems at other locations. This one is always understaffed. Don't eat here."
O O.,"Redwood City, CA",0,280,,3.0,11/23/2016,"I've been here maybe 3x.  Oddly each time I've made a food selection, the server returns to tell me my selections is sold out where I had to make another selection.  I find this restaurant out of food habit as strange where items listed on the menu are non existence, making the clientele to select  higher priced meals. Quality of food,  selection and pricing does not meet my standards.  If you have time to waste, Cheescake Factory is your place for desserts.  I will not return for a quick bit or memorable meal."
Dawn B.,"San Mateo, CA",2,3,,1.0,11/9/2016,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE curbside service!!!!!! Not only did I have do go in and get it, but I had to wait 20 minutes beyond my order being ready Never coming here again! Someone's hot food was sitting at the counter for over 30 minutes I hope they don't get sick.  Another patron was waiting for his 1 burger for over 40 minutes!!!! Can you say FAIL!!!!!!!"
Nitesh J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Worst service at the bakery. Sooooo slow, staff is always busy talking amongst themselves. Took 20mins to give 2 slices of cake to go."
Rakesh L.,"Burlingame, CA",3,37,65,4.0,2/11/2017,"We'd frequent the Cheesecake Factory often in the past but the long waits have discouraged us from coming here lately. Well, we decided to brave the 45 minute waiting time today and were suitably rewarded with an updated vegan friendly menu. The brown and sourdough bread were both good, though the brown bread was a tad bit sweeter than usual. I also ordered a virgin Pina Colada (no dairy - yay!). It was strictly ok since it was waaay sweeter than it's been in the past - 2.5/5 The Avocado Toast was 3.5/5 - nice texture, not too creamy and the pickled onions added a nice taste. The radish also complemented the watercress. Could have done without the tomatoes and could do with a just a pinch of red pepper flakes perhaps California Guacamole Salad 4/5 - leaves were crisp, dressing was just enough and not too oily. The hint of spice added flavor. Serving size was generous Service and ambience 4/5 We'll probably be coming back before the menu changes again and the vegan options become fewer again."
Ruth S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/23/2017,"Took my friend for a birthday lunch and it was a disaster as  far as service goes - like lunch took 2 hours due to poor service, Forgot to get forks, check took 20 minutes to bring over, lengthy wait to take order initially, etc, etc- veery unpleasant scenario- Wil not go back after this service - used to enjoy going there quite often-"
Yesenia V.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,7,4,1.0,8/13/2017,Sitting here for about 2 hours still no food! Mind you it's not busy nor refill on water or even bread to kill the hunger! What did we order SALADS!!! This is ridiculous...
Danielle L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Get it together !!!!!!!  Called 4 times no answer , called and was put on hold for over 5 minutes . Finally I call and get my order in and you forgot my app . Food is awful and dry . Waited over 40 minutes .. just awful no wonder you have 2 stars . Why are other Cheesecakes factory's so much better .. beyond dissatisfied"
Ray M.,"South San Francisco, CA",193,2,,1.0,8/2/2017,Service really slow during the day. Never coming back to this chain. Servers don't look like they want to be there. Not worth my money.
Will W.,"Burlingame, CA",0,8,,3.0,8/10/2017,"Typical Cheesecake experience, tends to get real busy in evenings. Be aware that the mall is going through a major renovation so traffic and parking can be tough."
