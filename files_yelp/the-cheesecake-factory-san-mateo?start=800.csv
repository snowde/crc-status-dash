d j.,"San Bruno, CA",164,54,,1.0,12/31/2011,Dont bother!  Waited an hour for a table my husbands food came out 10 minutes before mine.  When i got my food it was raw in the middle.  Told me they would redo my meal but waited for so long i just wanted to leave.  The server didnt even bring a manager to our table we had to ask for a manager.
Aundria G.,"Daly City, CA",103,29,35,1.0,10/9/2011,"Cheesecake factory is always one of those places that are known for CONSISTENCY, good food, decent service, decent wait time etc. So when my boyfriend and I decided we were craving we went to the Hillsdale location instead of downtown because we thought it would be a shorter wait. I wish we just went downtown. This place is terrible, all because of the people working there. First of all we were told the wait time for 2 would be 30 min, which was fine but when it got to 1 hr that's when I got irritated. We finally got seated and we had looked at the menu while we were waiting so we planned on ordering right away. No one acknowledged us for 15 min! Not for drinks not for anything, until a waitress came up and said she'll take our drink order because our original waiter needed some help. We ordered all of our food at that time too, 15 min later our drinks come *rolls eyes* then we were ignored again. Food came at a decent time,  but still the waiter that was suppose to be assigned to our table never came it was the same girl. I think she may have had a big IDGAF attitude because maybe the tips werent going to go to her, but thats besides the point. It's your job! And on top of that if that waiter can not handle all those tables, then he shouldn't be assigned all those tables hands down! It was during my meal that I got really pissed off, the girl was filling my boyfriends water not paying attention and spilled water all over my leg/shoes. And ladies who wear platforms know that this is not ok! My heels were ruined and she tried to ignore the fact she spilled all over me. She just said ""I'll get someone to clean the floor"" Are you serious?  We ended up throwing $40 cash down and leaving getting our cheesecake to-go. This location NEVER EVER AGAIN."
Elizabeth A.,"San Mateo, CA",63,151,,4.0,3/4/2012,"I have been here a few times. I am very satified with the food and service. I would like to see some kind of reference to the television show ""The Big Bang Theory""...one of the main characters- Penny suppose to work for the Cheese Cake Factory in Pasadena CA. I think it would be great if they made some kind of connnection in the decore of the actual restaurant."
amui J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,,2.0,1/6/2013,"Service and food was mediocre. I ordered Chicken Marsala and it was so bland. I have tried the same dish at downtown and it was so good. ordered a slice of cheese cake and the portion was smaller than before. Our waitress Donnie didn't ask if we want desert or cafe when we ask to doggie bag left over, she thought we were asking for the bill. When we want box to wrap up the left over she ask if we want to put them in the same box. What kind of question is that.  Where is her hygiene basics. On my way out, I went to takeout section to buy a jar of dressing. Ends up that they didn't  have enough of the one I order to fill up a jar. They wouldn't accommodate and let me do half of it and get half of other. Therefore I wanted a refund.  The cashier did a void instead of refund but gave no paper copy as a record that I would get my money back. What kind of service is this. How can a customer take your word that the money will be credit without any proof? I know they would save money doing a void instead of dong a refund but it is not right if there is not paper record for customer.  I demanded the manager to sign something for record because in this world you cant take anything anyone's word. i really think Karl should rethink how he manage this restaurant. Won't be coming back to this cheesecake Factory location. Service and food were so much better at the downtown location."
Leanne M.,"Hayward, CA",1,4,,1.0,1/5/2013,Horrible my pasta was not even done all the way my chicken was raw omg so sad i was really looking forward to coming back but im not coming back. Service was okay
Valerie N.,"San Francisco, CA",27,612,41,4.0,10/1/2011,"my girl friend told me about this new cheesecake factory that recently open in hillsdale, so we came to give this place a try. girl friends and i got here and we were greeted right away and there wasn't a wait, i think because we came as early birds. we decided to sit in the outside patio on a gorgeous sunny afternoon. services was definitely great and the food is okay (just like any other cheesecake factory i've been to)  overall, i had a great experience at this location."
Kayla V.,"Dublin, CA",11,144,21,2.0,3/23/2014,Service here is toooooo slow. The food isn't even that good. Pretty pricey too. Now I remember why I don't usually go here.
Jimmy M.,"San Mateo, CA",257,106,,3.0,5/30/2012,This place reminds me of being in Las Vegas.  I just came for Happy Hour drink with a friend and everything was fine.  Beer was cold and Giants on the tv made me a happy camper.
Christina H.,"Aurora, CO",122,71,2,3.0,3/10/2012,"I cannot get over the lines at this place all the time.  Ridiculous.  The service is slow and the food is overpriced.  Good place to grab a quick lunch, and maybe some takeout cheesecake, but that's about all."
Al C.,"San Jose, CA",114,291,1,3.0,4/3/2012,"Came here with coworkers for lunch.  Easy seating which was great.  The service was solid too.  The food was ok.  I had the garlic noodles, expecting what I get at the Yard House.  But, it seems like they forgot the garlic.  Yes, they have pages and pages in their menu...but, they should actually just stick to cheesecake and long island iced teas."
Nicole P.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/27/2011,Went here on my lunch break and after waiting an hour I had to get my food to go. What makes it worse is that I was with my co-worker and she got her food and had to watch
Opinionated X.,"San Francisco, CA",2,137,13,5.0,11/3/2011,"My rating is for the cheesecake counter. I've been there twice and the staff has been polite, friendly, and courteous. Expensive cheesecake but worth every crumb!"
John C.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,49,,2.0,10/1/2011,"Recently opened, food Meh and service was horrible.  Plus (Tuesday) lunch took close to two hours.  Server very inattentive and generally useless, every table was having issues with what arrived - I could have done a far better job myself with zero experience and training.  Hopefully they will fire him and hire an actual food server.  Food was pretty good but vegetables were essentially uncooked, tasted raw and very crunchy - my wife's sandwich was tasty, my pecan-crusted catfish was rubbery and tasteless (not sure how they managed that..) Cheesecake was yummy but then again cheesecake is not that hard to make yummy.  I may try them again in about 6 months - not before then."
Mrs A.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/15/2011,"Had a great experience tonight at the new Hillsdale location... 5 stars for our server Jennifer E (?).   The staff was attentive, and they were spot on with everything... I couldn't believe how many comments were posted about the staff not being up to par.  THEY JUST OPENED PEOPLE!!!   GIVE THEM A CHANCE... It takes time for store/restaurant teams to synergize and find a rythm.  As someone  who works retail, ya'll have NO IDEA what we go through.  For most, this is their first job... how would you feel if tons of people were writing negative reviews about you when you're busting your ass??  Just sayin."
Jamie G.,"San Francisco, CA",34,45,984,2.0,11/9/2011,"It was my first time eating at The Cheesecake Factory and I had a bad experience. I ordered the fettucini alfredo for lunch. and OMG.... it was sooooooo salty!! Every bite I took, I had to drink water after it. It was too gross. I was starting to feel a bit dizzy so I told the manager and we didn't have to pay for it. Other than that, the waiter we had was really nice and helpful. Oh I also liked the unlimited bread that they give you when they sit you down :)"
susan d.,"San Mateo, CA",2,5,,4.0,6/28/2012,"Just had another really good meal at the Cheesecake Factory.  We were a party of 6 and the wait was about 10 minutes, even though we were willing to wait the anticipated 20-25.  I'd crawl a mile through glass for the red velvet cheesecake, and everyone enjoyed their meal, from salmon to salads to blue cheese bacon burgers.  Our server was in training and handled everything quite well.  The staff in general is well trained, friendly and welcoming.  Special kudos to the hostess and the manager, Carl, who went out of their way to help me look for my Rx sunglasses, which obviously fell out of my handbag.  I felt rather silly when I found them on the floor of the car, but I called to let them know, since they were willing to search after the lights went up.  We usually stay away from chain restaurants, but this one is a winner."
Victoria D.,"San Mateo, CA",70,76,1,5.0,3/13/2012,Every time I go here I am not disappointed.  My husband and I decided on an early dinner since we were at the mall.  We were seated immediately (it was 4:30pm).  The waitress was great with our son and us.  She never let our glass go empty or our bread basket.   We received our food quickly and very hot.  The food was so good.  I recommend going in off hours.  During peak hours you will have an hour wait.
Sandi W.,"San Mateo, CA",4,6,,4.0,8/26/2012,"Always a long wait, but worth it!!  Actually their meal portions are too much & usually do not have room for cheesecake, but get it to go.  Food is good.  Chee secakes outstanding!!  Made right on the premises!!  So many to choose from!"
Tommy C.,"Daly City, CA",8,125,5,2.0,6/17/2012,"Below average american cuisine at above average prices. Was there on Saturday night. Waited about 20 minutes until we were called to the front to be seated. After we got our drinks, it was about 8 minutes before we saw our waitress again. After she dropped off some bread, it was another 8 to 10 minutes before she came back to take our order. When our food finally came it was not that good. My steak was way over-cooked, and my friends pasta was below average. Place looked great but that was not enough to make up for all the slow service and average food."
Olga B.,"San Bruno, CA",315,249,893,3.0,12/23/2012,"Food was good as gold, cheesecakes, especially, but service was dissapointing a little - we were waiting to be seated for 30 minutes because girl on the front desk messed up the quantity and name on the list. Meh."
