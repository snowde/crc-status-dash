Annamarie T.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,20,9,3.0,2/29/2012,my Husband and I woulda've never thought of coming to this place until we recieved a gift card for our Wedding from my cousin so we went months later and it was good his steak amazing not much to be desired for the asparaagus no sauce just dried out the cheeesecake was good this afteroon I took my little Mom to lunch and she had a Cuban pork Sanwich which was good however I ordered an endive salad with blacked chicken and dressing on the side when it came it looked like tossed little pieces  of left over chicked off someone eles plate and the dressing was on it nothing to even be happy about so I sent it back and the pears on it when returned looked old and the chicken was dried out  and dry so maybe this place is only goood at dinner hours
Jeremy D.,"San Mateo, CA",17,22,,5.0,8/15/2012,Fun atmosphere but you have to be ready for a long wait. Good food and love the low calorie menu. Make sense to order low cal dinner cause you gotta save those calories for the great cheesecake. My favorite cheesecake is the black & white.
Brian J.,"San Mateo, CA",21,2,,4.0,10/21/2011,"Went here the first week they opened. The service was understadably a little slow, but the food more than made up for it! HUGE portions! easily able to split between two people! The drinks were good but a little pricey.  All in all pretty damn good!!!!"
Darius A.,"San Bruno, CA",29,620,34,4.0,1/3/2012,Compared to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco this place is heaven. The food is much better and so is the service. The wait was only 25 minutes which was bad so we went to the bar and I got the most delicious ice cold Pyramid Hef I have ever had. Prices are reasonable and portions are large. My soda glass was broken on the top and I almost cut myself so make sure you drink out of the straw. The burgers are good here and so is the orange chicken.
Christopher M.,"Roseville, CA",12,12,,5.0,7/20/2012,First off If you see posts saying that people hate it because of the wait just ignore it because they are obviously impatient and can't wait. As for my review i think that this Cheesecake Factory has to be the best one that i have been to so far. The staff are amazing and the food is really good. Sure the wait can be crazy sometimes but believe me it is worth the wait. Also the location is very convenient (Just off HW 101 in San Mateo at the Hillsdale blvd exit). I've been to some Cheesecake Factory's and they are pretty far from where i live (San Jose and San Francisco were the closes ones from my house) but this one is only a few minutes away from my house.

Alicia F.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/18/2015,"I used to really enjoy coming to this cheesecake factory until my experience this past friday. I came for my friends birthday and there were about 7 of us and my other friend and I decided to share a meal, the salmon and shrimp scampi combo plate. They bring out the dish and we cut it in half and the whole inside was completely raw. The waitress apologizes and takes it back and makes us another plate. They bring the second one and there for the second time, the salmon was raw on the inside. She leaves us the mashed potatoes and the three shrimp and just takes the salmon. The manager comes up and says they usually don't cook it fully because they don't want the salmon to be dry?! I have never heard of that before in my life. We finish our potatoes and shrimp and when they brought my friend her birthday cake, they brought the third piece of salmon, which wasn't perfect. I was really disappointed and to top it off they charged us for the meal, I would not feel right about paying for such a poor meal so they took it off and then said next time if you don't want it, don't eat it. Incredibly rude and one of my friends even new another waiter who worked there and he told us our waitress was talking crap about us. Worst service I've had in a while and it's definitely not what I expect from a Cheesecake factory, very disappointed."
Steve S.,"San Carlos, CA",0,13,,2.0,9/20/2012,Menu too extensive; noisy; service good;food just ok
Lily M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",9,127,112,4.0,11/12/2011,"Great place to bring the family and have a wide variety of appetizers, entree's and desserts to die for. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the wait to get a table is usually between 45-60 minutes."
Jill C.,"Santa Clara, CA",6,65,4,4.0,12/6/2011,"Pros: Its has tasty food, located in a newer mall... you can walk around the mall if you are waiting for a table to open.  Our waiter/server was super friendly and easy going. She was willing to let us pay for a large bill with a combination of cash and credit cards. Cons: It was crowded when I went on Saturday night for my friend's birthday. They didn't take reservations for our large group.  We told the waiter about the birthday celebration, so they sang the birthday song to her and bought out a piece of cake but charged us $2.00 for it. Overall a good place but I think its a bit over rated."
Milan A.,"South San Francisco, CA",3,36,3,1.0,2/9/2013,"So me and my boyfriend decided to have lunch here today. Soon as we got in we were seated immediately.Anyways, we sat an ordered our food. We ordered stuffed mushrooms, Asian chicken salad and moroccan chicken. We also had the red velvet and peanut butter cheesecake. All of which were pretty good. No complaints there. Why the 1 star you ask? Well for starters, our server, NHINA, was very rude. The whole time she spoke she acted stuck up and acted like she didn't want to be there. When she brought out some bread I asked her if she could get us more sourdough bread. I waited 10 mins for her to tell me they were still baking so I had to wait. Ok that's fine, I waited. We were done eating and she packed out good and she still hasn't brought more bread like I asked. I didn't mention it again because I feel as a server these are things you need to remember. She also never asked how we were doing and if the food was good like normal severs would do. She never checked up on us. Horrible customer service. I wished we didnt waste our money here. I wish I would have complained to the manager but I didn't want to make it a big deal. I will never come back to this Cheesecake Factory because of the horrible customer service Nhina gave us. I definitely will continue to go to the SF one."
Peter H.,"San Francisco, CA",29,22,,5.0,9/1/2012,"The cheesecake factory is cheesecake heaven. I always go back to the plain old fashion New York cheesecake, my favorite. This is the best place to go to when you are craving cheesecake."
Matthew S.,"South San Francisco, CA",4,2,,2.0,4/8/2012,"Definite hype. I expected so much more from an 11 dollar burger, both of my friends ordered the same type of pasta and they were both under cooked, the 30 dollar flaminyon was like they just went to Safeway and microwaved it... Save your money. Trust me."
Erin S.,"San Mateo, CA",147,282,103,2.0,12/24/2011,"well, we FINALLY got to dine at CF last week.  Ed had the week off so we went to lunch.  We were in Vegas recently and we ate an amazing chicken picatta at their sister restaurant, the Grand Lux Cafe.  So, we decided that we would enjoy this again.  We ordered a regular size to share AND a salad to share.  YUMMY salad.  BUT, were not as happy about the chicken.  At the Lux they served the chicken..aprox four large pieces on top of a plate of linguine.  The entire dish has a nice sauce with capers and artichoke.  Well, here they served us a smaller plate, the pasta was a glob on the side of the dish WITH NO SAUCE and the other half of the dish had the three no so big, pieces of chicken.  There was a minimum of sauce...not enoiugh for the chicken and the pasta for sure.  What a bummer.  I love CFF..this is just disappointing.  I guess we will just have to go to palo alto or vegas again!"
Lina M.,"San Mateo, CA",3,111,,1.0,10/8/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory very much. But this location is a disappointment. The wait for food is insane. Their staff is generally incompetent and not trained very well. The place opened and it is very disorganized. In this economy it is bad business to treat customers this way. The manager came to apologize and to thank us for being patient, but failed to deliver or should have brought a piece of cheesecake or a no wait pass on the next visit. But it doesn't matter. I will not be coming back to this location."
Candace H.,"Redwood City, CA",12,4,,4.0,1/15/2012,We all know Cheesecake Factory. I think this new location adds something to the Mall and surrounding area. The servers were attentive and the food was good as usual. I do have to say their portions are a little too big but maybe that's why they charge more than another bar and grill.
A W.,"Redwood City, CA",0,11,,4.0,8/5/2012,My daughter's favorite place to eat.. Ahi tuna and lettuce wrap. Love all the desserts!!!
Mateo B.,"San Francisco, CA",59,24,1,4.0,10/24/2011,"Brand new place that opened up close by to my house. Took my woman here for a nice brunch. Great location, inside the mall and lots of parking available. Place was packed as expected, great atmosphere, staff was friendly and our waiter was great and very attentive. Ordered the Sliders and French Toast.  I felt the French Toast was a little too soggy and a little stingy on my powdered sugar. I've had better with thicker toast at smaller diners . Overall, its still a very nice restaurant for any types of gatherings.  Will go back again but will try a different meal :-)"
Bailey K.,"Alameda, CA",12,336,78,4.0,1/4/2012,There menu is so huge - everyone can find something they like.  The portions are huge so it is good to share.  Since the menu is so large go with a large group and order lots of different dishes so you can try a variety.  The food is good and of course the cheesecake is great - we all have our personal favorites - vanilla bean - pineapple upside down.  The service is always great once you sit down - it is actually getting to sit down.  The wait is long and the hostesses are so busy and in such a hurry they are very curt.  If you can get past the Hosts stand and get a table and that could take over an hour at time you will have a fun time!
Desiree B.,"Daly City, CA",275,55,159,5.0,9/21/2011,"came in earlier today and sat at the bar...holy guac! of all the experiences I've had at cheesecake factory, today. was. thee. best. one! came in around 2:40p.m and had the lousiana chicken pasta and a lemon drop w/ a salt rim...hands down the best lemon drop ever! shout out to the bartender who made my drink (wish i could've caught your name to give proper credit).
