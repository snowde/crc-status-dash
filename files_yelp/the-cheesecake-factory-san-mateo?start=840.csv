Sun M.,"San Mateo, CA",10,96,1,3.0,11/14/2011,This is more of 3.5 star but most of it is the amazing service from our waitess Jennifer D. So sweet n great personality. Seat in her section cause she will take care of u. We also had a huge party n she got everything done perfect. I had the fresh veggie salad n Jennifer suggested the lentil soup which was de-lish. Our table had crispy spicy beef which is real spicy if u don't like spicy. Overall good experience but the reservation part of this place is horrible. They need to work on it. People can't just hang around the mall for 2 hours.
Paulo A.,"San Carlos, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/27/2012,"I like the Cheesecake Factory, however my visit to the new location at the Hillsdale Mall the other day, was not the best I'd had. My buddy and I decided to sit at the bar for a quick lunch. I ordered the sweet corn fritters and the friend mac and cheese and my buddy ordered the catfish. Th food was great as usual. The service however was not par. We were two of four people at the bar, granted the bartender was making drinks for the restaurant, however when he walks by and stares at the empty glasses of water and doesn't offer to refill them, I start to have an issue. He does not know if the food was good, he didn't ask. Maybe it was our fault for sitting at the bar, maybe a table is the way to go.  I won't let his bad service keep me from going back, like I said, the food is good."
James L.,"San Mateo, CA",17,72,,4.0,4/7/2012,I had the fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes and chicken. Awesome!!! So flavorful and hearty. This totally hit the spot. I was very happy with my meal.
Bob S.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,20,1,3.0,10/1/2011,"Let me preface by saying I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Menu is extensive, food is reliably good and huge portions. As expected, this location has it's share of newbie hiccups. The service is slow, the kitchen is slow but that is to be expected with a new opening. Having said that, I am happy to see a Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale. A word of advise: Key Lime Cheesecake...enuf said."
Amanda L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/5/2012,Wow i love this place.  When my sister and i showed up the place was completely crowded and busy.  We only had a 5 minute wait and were seated by a very friendly hostess.  What impressed me the most was the awesome waitress!  She was so nice and had great service.  She was very calm even though she was quite busy.  I was even more impressed when the food arrived within 10 minutes!  My sister and i shared pasta and we didn't even finish it! I RECOMMEND SHARING! the portions are huge.  What topped it all off was the AMAZING MASHED POTATOES!!!!!!!  I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend everyone to get them! They are heavenly!!!!!!!!!!
Cara L.,"Burlingame, CA",69,57,19,2.0,11/10/2011,"Second time been here.., service not that great... Always have to ask for the bread basket... The one in the city is the best ..."
Janice T.,"Belmont, CA",18,25,9,2.0,11/8/2011,"I took away two stars because of the wait. Seriously watched 8 tables cleared, cleaned and set...it stayed like that for at least 30 mins! WTH! They do not know how to get you in and out. The waiting time they give you is when they will seat you even if there are tables open! Food: totally different rating although seems the kitchen either does not have enough staff or they just can't cook fast enough for the crowd?! When the dishes came out, they looked wonderful - or you're just starving from waiting so long. Our table ordered: a bleu cheese burger, a mac and cheese burger (not sure what it's called), chicken marsala and mushroom pasta, cobb salad and two cheesecakes (one tiramisu and one wild blueberries).  Had dessert to go, because the portions were large and we were pretty full. Everything tasted very good...too bad the front end didn't seat people when tables were ready, they would have received 4 stars. Hopefully this is just a little kink for new restaurant!  I say we would give them another try after the holidays..."
Alan B.,"South San Francisco, CA",22,10,10,4.0,1/7/2012,"We had a couple of issues with our order and the waitress and manager took care of it promptly ,very nice thank-you to our server Laura s."
Brian L.,"San Mateo, CA",99,10,1,5.0,10/16/2011,Went there grand opening day. sort of busy but the wait was worth it! love the survice. we had a party of 4 and we also had one coming. they took all our plates and moved us to a bigger table.
Dani C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2014,"I going on the record to say that cheesecake factory is one of my favorite places to eat out with friends and family. There food is amazing and they have huge portions. But the service at the Hillsdale location is a load of crap. Having crap service a few times, I can let it go. And by a few times I mean anywhere from 3-5 visits. But after that, something needs to be fixed. I'm not picky and I guess that's why have let so many bad services just brush off my shoulder. But today was the last straw. I work in Hillsdale mall at one of the stores and because I like Cheesecake factory, I have a menu to the restaurant. I know they are busier on the weekends, so when I know I'm going to be taking my lunch break, I call in advance 20 to 30 mins before so that by the time I take my lunch the food is ready. Today I called at 3 pm, and was placed on hold. Which is normal because they have to transfer you over to takeout. At most, you're on hold for about 4mins. Not today, they put me on hold for more than 10mins, and at the 10min mark, I decided to use another phone and call them again to ask what the deal was because no one was picking up the takeout line. the person on the phone apologized, put me on hold again on the second phone and I was hold for another 3 mins. I had 2 phones going on hold, and they never answered the original call I made. finally they took my order, which was a mushroom burger. Simple and easy. The girl who took my order told me that it would be 15-20mins and they would deliver it to my store, so I wouldn't have to come get. I said cool and paid the bill over the phone. Now all I had to do was wait, which meant that my food would be at my store by 3:35pm at the latest, which was the grace period she told me. 3:45pm rolls around and no sign of my food. Now because of the grace period she gave me, I waited to the last possible minute to clock out for lunch, because when you work in retail, you only get 30mins. I had to clock out for lunch at 3:30pm and my food should have come by then. So I call them back at 3:45pm to see if something happened. What I was told was "" sorry, but we got a little busy, but I have someone bringing your food right over"". I said ok, I still have 15 mins left in my break, that's enough time for me to eat and be back in time to work. So I waited and waited and no one showed up with my food. So I had no choice, my lunch break was over and I had to clock back in, hungry and annoyed. Finally at 4:05pm, the food arrives and the first thing that comes out of the girls mouth is sorry about the wait but here is your burger and I just need the card you used to pay to get the card number. I give here my card to copy down and I tell her in a calm but stern voice that I am disappointed with the service, and that all they had to do was call me to tell me that it was busy and I should come get my food. You had my cell number and my store number, a quick call was all I needed. Don't offer a service with a time frame and not hold your end of it. All she could say was sorry and left my store. Not 5 mins later after she left, I get a call from cheesecake. No message so I called it back to inquire what they needed, they had delivered the food(cold and soggy) and I had paid when I ordered the food an hour previous. When the guy answered the phone, I told him that I had gotten a missed call from them and no one left a message and his response was ""I don't know, maybe someone in the bakery called, did you order something?"" I ran through the situation with him of what happened and that I had finally gotten my food, and all he said was"" sorry about the wait, on your next visit with us that won't happen and that I hope that this experience wont effect my decision to come back to there establishment"". I proceeded to hang up because I was beyond frustrated with him and the staff no owning up to there misgivings. Saying sorry doesn't fix things. I never asked for anything other that to provided the service that was told to me on the phone when I ordered my burger. Not once did I ask for a discount or something free due to there crappy service even though with everything that happened, should have been offered. After hanging up on that call, 10 min later, I get another call from them, so I answer. According to the woman I am talking on the phone with(by the way, she was the manager on duty) the girl who wrote down my card number forgot to write down the expiration date. I literally wanted to jump through the phone because I was so angry. How hard is it for people to do there job. So I go get my card out of my purse for the third time and give her the info. I proceed to explain the whole situation again to the manager and all she says is sorry, and that we got busy. Guess what, I'm a manager in my store and I get busy to and if you have people waiting for you the least you can do is just keep them informed. It's not that hard. So I am officially done with The Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale mall."
Diana G.,"Belmont, CA",0,21,3,2.0,10/11/2011,"Before visiting this location I was a fan of Cheesecake Factory but after last night experience I am not planing to go back in a long time. Wait time was  is more than 45 min, not good if you are with hungry children. The server , Nicole didn't know the menu, I asked couple of questions and she wasn't able to answer it, I ordered Cabernet, I got Chardonnay and-after that  it took 20 min to get the right wine. We didn't get any bread or water  for 10 min. We ordered couple of appetizers- calamari and crab cakes, after 25 min of waiting I asked our waiters if the appetizers are coming, she went back to the kitchen and brought only the calamari- they were hot and yummy. After 5 more min the manager stopped by and apologized that the crab cakes are taking so long and offered to pay for them.  10 min latter we got our main course, but the crab cakes were still missing. We were almost done with our dinner when they arrived and they tasted horrible, soft in the outside and very mushy in the inside. I had  Steak Diane for main course , and was way to salty, my husband got fish and it tasted bland. So one star for the ambiance and one star for the calamari."
Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",59,13,4,1.0,10/2/2011,"Very disappointed=\ Pros: -The Cheesecake is yummyyyy!:D Cons: -Waiting time is way too long (need to start doing reservations, or be more organized) -Waiters are slow -Should be more considerate off all the paying customers. -Bad music (can barely hear it anyways.=\) I've been to the cheesecake factory in SF and in Palo Alto. Average waiting time would be 45-60 minutes which is fine because I know its a popular restaurant and it also allows you to walk around while you wait. Both places had excellent service and food. On a busy day the noise level was quiet enough to have a conversation with a person sitting across of you. The music was calming and there seemed to be a good classy flow.  Now let me tell you about my first experience at the hillsdale location. It was my birthday yesterday(10/01) and I was really looking forward to having dinner at the cheesecake factory. I arrived there at 5:30pm. There were heaps of people gathered in the front of the restaurant waiting and there was the waiting line to get a table. In the beginning the girls at the counter were nice and informed me that it'll be a 1 hour and 30 minute wait,...OMG!! Im patient, but that just seemed ridiculous. I dont like the fact that we can;t make reservations! They seriously need to change that. Maybe it'll be more organized if they did. So we shopped around for about an hour then waited infront of the restaurant for a half hour..I walked back in and asked why they didnt buzz me in..they informed me saying that it'll take another 20 minutes and that one more party was ahead of me. Thank goodness I brought my crazy impatient mother with me because after that extra 20 minute wait she had to demand them to seat us(btw it was just a party of 3 ppl!!...3!!..). They had skipped us and let all the other parties into the restaurant except us! We were the only ppl waiting outside in the cold wondering where everyone went. and we could obviously see many vacant tables inside. We basically waited over 2 hours!! They either need to replace or train these ppl better.. Now once we get a table our waiter immediately gives us our menus and drinks. He seemed very nice but he was making everything so rushed. We barely got to look at the menu! :( they didnt bring us the bread but we noticed they served some ppl that came in after us with bread and drinks. Its like they totally forgot about us!! the food was decent,. i was hoping for something better but I didnt get the chance to read much of the menu. i just ordered whatever i ate last time:P These waiters need more training and they should NOT gather in groups and talk too much because they made us wait sooooo long for the check ugh!! When they;re on their shift they should be there for the customer not to chit chat.  Besides the wait and the service the noise level was waaayyy too loud. there was a group of girls celebrating a birthday and they were yelling and screaming loudly. now i can't blame them only. of course everyone is talking within their table/booths, but these girls were too loud. We told one of the waiters and they said they couldnt do anything. We werent the only ppl that complained about these loud group of girls. After awhile I noticed that the manager was going table to table apologizing about the noise..he went to every table ..except ours!! WOW!! that's pretty rude. I've been to enough resturants in this country and other's..but this has to be the biggest disappointment. I always saw cheesecake factory to be a great place to have a date or hang with colleagues or friends or fammily..but after last night I dont think i want to ever go back there. Hopefully they'll improve=\"
Christine D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/24/2012,"We have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and this location did not live up to the other locations or experiences.    Very disappointed all the way around.   Service, food . . .      This was our first visit since this location opened and honestly don't know that I would go back.     The whole evening was ""pieced"" together, from us being seated, drink order, dinner . . .     Very bad, awkward, horrible service.   Meals were okay -- mine was cold and arrived much later than everyone else at the table as if it had been sitting.     As we were not having a good experience I didn't ask for it to be sent back.   I probably would have never seen a replacement order or the waiter/waitress again. Love the Cheesecake Factory -- hope this location gets it together."
nicole b.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,3.0,2/4/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory and I'm so glad there is one now in San Mateo. I only ate inside of the restaurant once and the service was great, but I always order for pickup and they never can get my order right. They always forget something that I asked for and seem to always forget to put utensils in the bag...wouldn't that be common sense if someone is picking up food that they need utensils?  So, when you are calling for takeout check to make sure everything is in the bag that you asked for before you leave....oh...and don't forget to get the Red Velvet Cheesecake! It's the best!!!!"
chad k.,"San Francisco, CA",33,46,,2.0,1/30/2012,"It is over priced, overcrowded, and not that great. Slightly better than Applebee's. Nothing original. I had to wait 45 minute at  PM on a Sunday. It in a mall and I don't like chain style resturants. It is what it is."
Michelle R.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",11,14,3,3.0,1/12/2012,"Food was great, big portions. I had the hot spinach cheese dip & chicken jumbalaya. Wait staff was very friendly. Definitely arrive early enough to read the novel sized menu (not great if you're starving and indecisive!)."
K W.,"San Mateo, CA",1,24,,2.0,1/3/2014,"Good food, inattentive service. Party of 6 dined at lunch today. 3 meals came out, wait several minutes, 2 more meals come out, wait several minutes, final meal comes out--inedible! Server didn't come to check on us. Had to flag down hostess to get server (not ours) who brought us our check, when all we wanted was an edible meal for the last person served in our party. They should have apologized and comped the inedible meal of the last person served in our party. Plan to return to give the manager a chance to make it right. Will update if they do."
Dana F.,"San Mateo, CA",70,8,,4.0,3/18/2012,"The wait was long, but to be expected at a newly opened restaurant.  The food was very good, except some hard rice.  The servers were prompt, efficient, and pleasant.  Manager stopped by and was friendly and engaging.  I will be back."
Leo T.,"Belmont, CA",148,478,,5.0,10/21/2011,This is a great Cheesecake Factory. Be sure to stop by here while or after you're shopping at HSC.
Dennis W.,"San Francisco, CA",525,57,14,4.0,5/6/2012,We went to Cheese Cake Factory in Hillsdale for the first time. Been to the one in San Francisco and San Jose so kinda know what kind of quality the food is. I have too say that they didnt disappoint me. The food is the same quality and the service is great. Would highly recommed this place.
