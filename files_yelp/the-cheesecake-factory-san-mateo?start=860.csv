LKT T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,110,2,3.0,9/15/2013,"This place is a hit or miss depending on who you get as a server or if you're sitting near the bar area.   Overall the good us good for a chain place.   But it's the service for CSF.   I like their whole grain bread the best.   Their smoothies are pretty good.   But I'm ok with the rest.    I like how they have a separate skinny menu with calories on each dish.   If I have nowhere to go, I come here and sit at the bar.   The bartender(not the server) is usually attentive."
Tiffany B.,"Redwood City, CA",5,28,,5.0,11/15/2013,"Let me start by saying ... I LOVE CHEESECAKE!!  So glad to see the Cheesecake Factory open closer to home, no more trekking to PA.  On our latest visit w/ our daughter and in-laws we had an interesting experience.  We got in after the normal 15+ minute wait, no problem.  GREAT waitress got our drinks/orders and bread. Then we sat, and sat and sat for almost 45 minutes, which is NOT the norm here!!  We called the manager over and he explained that they had a power outage a little while ago and were running w/o computers so they were a little backed up.  No problem - we just ate more bread until our food came.  After our food finally came, a couple things were not right so the manager came over again, apologized and offered to take some dinners off our tab for the inconvenience and bad experience.  Usually you get offered a free dessert or something that you weren't going to order anyway, so we were VERY happy that he offered that, it def made up for the bad experience.  Cory Willis was the manager and should be commended for his customer service during a hectic time.  We will for sure continue going to CF and know that as long as Cory is there we will be taken care of if there is ever a need.  Thanks Cory!!!"
Trisha R.,"San Mateo, CA",145,27,,1.0,11/12/2011,"Just wanted to say that they gave us a 70 minute wait.  After 30 minutes, I went and checked how much longer...they began to tell me 60 more minutes...What! They also said they don't hold tables, but there was a table for 6 open for 30 minutes because the party wasn't there...Just a rude manager to my in-laws (who are 77) and we ended up leaving.  Even some of the staff were embarrassed at their behavior and came over to us to apologize. We went to Celia's!"
Lisa D.,"San Mateo, CA",74,31,,5.0,11/11/2011,"Went with a friend last week, I forget our waitress's name, but she was very sweet and attentive. We ordered the nachos and the pot stickers and  two drinks. Both appetizers were delicious, the pot stickers are delicious, loved the chilled glass they offer when you get an alcoholic drink too, will be back :)"
P D.,"Encino, CA",0,37,3,2.0,10/6/2014,"I should have read the reviews on this location before coming in and not based my expectations on my neighborhood location. The restaurant was about 2/3 full and the first table I was offered was directly in front of the bathroom -seriously at the entrance to the bathrooms. The hostess seemed surprised I didn't want to sit there. The next table was located by the bar which was much better. My server came about 10 mins later and asked if I needed anything else -- he seemed to think I was the last person that sat at the table. I was then given another 10 mins to decide what I wanted only to find out that they were already out of my appetizer at 6pm. He did bring my beer quickly which helped. Then I realized that I was not offered the bread basket one usually gets before my food arrived - no I never received it. My waiter buzzed around but seemed to forget I was here only stopping by once until I was ready for my check which I had to flag him down to get after passing by me at least 6 times. The food on the other hand was typical Cheesecake Factory fare. All I can say is if good, or decent service is a factor for you, save yourself the disappointment and pass up this location and go for Mexican at Fernando's like I should have done. I won't be back to this location. Total time for a beer and 2 appetizers was 80 mins... I'm actually surprised I stayed."
Sel R.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,17,,3.0,1/24/2012,"i was very disappointed. I am a big fan of TCF but this one was upseting, i invited a large group of people to go with me and most plates were delicious but whats up with the small portions, if you want to GET WHAT yOU PAID for, PALO ALTO cheesecake is the one."
Mj J.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,38,,2.0,12/1/2014,"This used to be a great place but the kitchen and the service had gone downhill.  I took my friend there for her birthday lunch and ordered the salmon salad and added mango to it.  The waitress said the salmon is served cold. Fine.  Then someone came to the table and said that the salmon hadn't been prepped the night before and that it would be served hot. Fine.  My salmon came and the mango came in a dish on the side -- diced into tiny pieces with the skin on.  In case you haven't had mango, it has to be peeled.  Eating mango skin is like eating banana peel.  I asked them to redo the mango.  Then I cut into my salmon.  It was raw.  I asked them to cook it more.  The manager came over and apologized and said they'd comp my dessert (they should have comped my entree).  They served the salmon again.  I got myself clean silverware and cut into it.  Still raw.  I called the waitress over and asked them to broil my salmon for 5 minutes.  Finally it was cooked.  I got up and got myself another set of clean silverware and ate it. It was fine, not great, but I was starving.  I told them it was my friend's birthday so they'd put happy birthday on her dessert plate.   That didn't happen.  I got the bill and was charged for both desserts.  I called the waitress over and explained the problem.  She said she'd have to talk to the manager to comp my dessert.  Really ??? I was so nice to them in spite of the mess ups.  The waitress said she appreciated me not losing my cool, so I would have expected better treatment on the bill.  Maybe I should have gotten angry.  I won't go back to the Hillsdale restaurant.  i have been going to the Palo Alto restaurant and get good service and good food there."
MJ J.,"Redwood City, CA",3,203,10,3.0,5/26/2013,"Ok here's an updated review.   Our family got stuck at Hillsdale late on a Saturday night trying to catch up on errands after spending an entire day at Great America entertaining out of town guests.   Guess what - 915pm and kids were exhausted and this was walking distance.  We avoid chain restaurants as much as possible but no choice here.  I set my expectations low.  We were all pleasantly surprised - we ordered 3 sets of the Kobe beef burger with salad, one kid's pasta plus the Ritz Martini.  Kobe burger was excellent - San Francisco level quality.  Same with the Ritz Martini - outstanding mix and flavor.  We all looked at each other stunned.  The waiter was outstanding and so was the front desk.   I see so many reviews here complaining about poor service.  Can't comment on that tonight.   I have moved my rating to 3 stars now.   Since we ordered the safest food possible, if we end up at this place again in the future, we may take more risk and try the seafood specials which normally we would never attempt unless it was a restaurant in  Palo Alto or San Francisco with proven quality. thumbs up for late night opening. our family eats out generally late on weekends - 8pm or later."
Mia K.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/1/2012,"Other Cheesecake Factories are great - this one is soooo bad it's almost laughable. First impression - sign in area is absolute chaos!  Several employees talking to each other with their backs to the customers and no organization as to who is first in line.  Then they say ""the wait will be 2 hours 45 minutes"" with a straight face hand you a buzzer and turn away again.   Once seated, the waiters ""overtalk"" and  interrupt your conversation- they often have 2 waiters (one trainee). Been there 4 times - each time they got the order wrong.  Then they expect a tip by handing you a bill and saying ""thank you Miss Jones"" because that is the name they see on the credit card.  Like that is going to help. Twice they were out of Red Velvet cheesecake and the waitress recommended it - once the cheesecake was frozen solid and had to be sent back. Chicken Piccatta is a hot mess on the plate - I was shocked to see her put this mess in front of me.  Oh yeah, and ask about their take out menu if you want a laugh!  Their stock answer is  .  I said ""does that mean you don't have one?"", so she repeated www....  I said ""okay, I will just pull out my laptop from my bag and sit down and look at it online OR maybe you could print up a few since you charge $8.00 for a slice of cheesecake.   So all in all, this place needs a good manager who can actually train employees on Customer Service."
Chris H.,"San Francisco, CA",42,39,,4.0,12/12/2011,"I have always been a fan this place especially when I was in LA., Opened a new one- had to try it.  The facility was huge and very nice. The staff seemed a bit young but did a great job.  The menu is large so you will always find something you like. Enjoyed it for a decent price while at the mall."
Sandra H.,"San Pablo, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2012,"Their costumer service SUCKS! My family and I went there to celebrate my nieces High School graduation and waited over 2 hours.  We would have not minded waiting that long if only they had said that from the begining. My cousin got there at 6:45 and the rest of us got there at 7:30.  When he first got there and wrote his name down and told them how many were coming they told him the wait was 45 minutes.  Well it was 8:30 and we still waiting. When we went to ask how long more they told us there was another large party, and as soon as they left they would seat us down.  To make the long story short they didn't seat us down ti'l 9:30pm.   The food was not good either.   The whole experiece there was very upseting.   I really think they need costumer service training. After all the bad service and the FREAKING LONG WAIT, you think they would give us a bit of a discount.  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!NO THEY DIDN""T............................ It totally sucks when you spend your money at a place like this"
victor c.,"San Mateo, CA",0,14,,1.0,11/9/2013,"Terrible, terrible terrible. Took 15 minutes to even be noticed at our table (2 adults and 2 kids under 10). Took another 10 minutes for water and another 15 minutes for bread. Food was salty and 2 of 4 dishes were OK the others awful. I thought $60 for lunch was a bit much for what we got. Will never return."
Dave M.,"San Mateo, CA",35,53,2,4.0,1/5/2013,"I rarely eat at chains. However, this aint bad. It's also kid/family friendly. Cheesecake has fairly high standards in terms of consistency and cleanliness. Service is fairly reliable as well. The portions are huge, but the wait can often be long. If you have kids, just go early/off hours. Otherwise, put your name down, then go do some shopping in the mall for a while."
Rob A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/14/2011,"The restaurant is like all of the other Cheesecake Factories, which is not a bad thing, I just always order what I like. The problem is they just don't have it down yet. Our first time we sat at the bar, after our server took our order, asked if we would like bread, she left the building. After that we had to get whichever bartender would look our way to get any service. The second time, we were seated, our order was taken, we got our drinks, then after 30 min I had to flag someone down to find out what happened to our food. Something did happen because each part of our lunch came out separately."
Jessica G.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/4/2012,The service is great and food is to die for. It gets busy but it worth the wait. I love their cheesecake...
Jessica A.,"San Mateo, CA",123,239,19,4.0,2/23/2012,"The service was totally fine. The eggplant sandwich was AMAZING. SO GOOD WITH SWEET POTATO FRIES. Holy scheiße, man. Order that! SO GOOD."
Michael R.,"San Bruno, CA",1,27,1,2.0,1/29/2013,2 stars for the dessert. Very slow service along with food so salty to be in edible
Consumer A.,"Orange County, CA",0,14,,2.0,5/19/2013,"This review is for the Sunday brunch. Husband got the Chilaquiles. I got the brioche breakfast sandwich. While this wasn't our first pick for breakfast, our favorite local family-owned spot was packed so we thought we would give the brunch here a try. The sandwich was meh, with bacon and maybe even eggs that seemed microwaved, and the Chilaquiles were just OK. Though cheap, we will not return for breakfast but I'd enjoy a Luau salad and slice of cheesecake from here any day."
Aui T.,"Millbrae, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/26/2013,I loved Santa Fe salad. Delicious food and big portion.
Jim Chris U.,"San Mateo, CA",140,61,51,4.0,9/20/2011,"It was my first time to dine in here. we usually just buy cheesecake but this day,we decided to eat food from their 100+ menu items! LOL we waited for 10 mins and then we got seated. The ambience was warm and relaxing. It was packed! the bar was full! For starters,I got a mango daquiri and the popular AVOCADO ROLLS w/ TAMARIND SAUCE! THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks to our server Naha(or was it Niha?). The sauce really made it mouthwatering! Then i got the CHICKEN & SEAFOOD GUMBO. That was really good! usually,the rice of the gumbo is already mixed together with everything, but the rice was in the middle of the gumbo sauce which really made a good presentation of it!. I was very satisfied and since the restaurant was new, the whole crew was new so they still screw up a bit but the supervisors attended to them really fast to fix the problem.lol they were funny hehe. Then we got dulce de leche cheesecake and oreo cheesecake for dessert to take home. Yummy! Awesome place!"
