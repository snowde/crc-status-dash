Renee Y.,"San Mateo, CA",36,2,,1.0,3/21/2013,Horrible service.  I had to call 3 times to place a to go order.  After getting home I realized they forgot the dressings for the salad we ordered.  Spoke to manager he said he would comp one salad but when I told him I paid partially with a gift card he said he would only take care of what I paid cash.  I demanded that he comp at least one whole salad for having to drive back.  I will never do take out from this location again!
Ken B.,"Redwood City, CA",0,17,,4.0,5/27/2013,I love the food... and the menu has so many choices.... I like that.... the dessert and the service is the best part...Jessica... the bartender... remembered us the second time we came back....she hooked us up with some great drinks....I would give 5 stars... but the wait is long... but what do u expect for shopping mall restaurant...
Ted O.,"Pacifica, CA",124,13,,1.0,9/19/2012,I had blackened chicken sandwich. It was ok. My mom had a burger which was horrible. The salads were really bad. The host was nice. Our server was terrible. The one in SF is a lot better.
Terri B.,"San Mateo, CA",14,9,,2.0,1/16/2012,I have been waiting for the Cheese Cake Factory to arrive to the San Mateo area for years. I am a huge fan of this restaurant. The menu selection is very large and the food usually good. Unfortunately this new restaurant at Hillsdale isn't getting high marks from me. I was there a few days after New Years Eve day and a friend ordered the Lua chicken salad. I have had this salad dozens of times at other locations and love it but this had dry and unedible chicken in it. In addtion we had asked to see the dessert menu. Upon our waiter coming to take our dessert order he informed us that they were wiped out on most cheesecakes and the selection was very very slim which was disappointing. Instead of telling us what 6 cheese cakes they did have on hand he told us to keep asking him and he will check it against his list of non available cheesecakes.  Is this NOT called the cheese cake factory?? I always rate a restaurant by the cleanliness of not only the eating area but on the bathrooms cleanliness as well. The women's bathroom was a mess and 2 of the stalls had no toilet paper in them. Mind you this was at 12:30 noon time which says to me NO ONE stocked the bathrooms on the closing shift the night before. I just tried this same restaurant for dinner last night and AGAIN the women's bathroom was not stocked and out of toilet paper in stalls and a mess. I think management has some problems to work out here. The next time I get a craving for the Cheese Cake Factory I think the Palo Alto location will be my choice.
Kim T.,"San Mateo, CA",209,63,36,3.0,9/22/2011,"I came here with my parents, brother and his girlfriend. We were seated right away which was good. Service for that was a plus but other than that, overall on this place for the time we waited for water, appetizers and meal was long. Long long long. I don't know if it was coming in after 930 or if it was busy but all I know is that normally when you come in almost til closing time you get serve pretty quick and all I know is that they didn't look that busy at all. The food was ok. Not great but just ok. I got the garlic noodle hoping that it taste something like the garlic noodles at ppq or thanh long in sf but it soooooo didn't take anything like it or had any garlic taste. It was basically like a pasta with tomato, chicken, & asparagus which normally garlic noodle doesn't come like that. My dad got the bang bang chicken with shrimp ... Its suppose taste like curry but it sorta wasn't. I wouldn't mind trying this place again since I won't know what taste good til I try it. Oh! And didn't get a chance to have cheese cake so I can't rate on that! :( overall a- ok. Wish it could've been more. Maybe next time."
Jimmy M.,"Oakland, CA",0,8,,4.0,3/3/2013,had the best time there last nite with my husband bday and with friends i got to say the food was the best and cheesecake was the best too but one thing that i felt sad about when i ask them for more brown bread she refuse to give it to me and the excuse was they ran out and baking right now then i went to use the restroom and i saw others waiter walking around with it i was like wtf are you for real and i even left like almost $30 tips .
Sean W.,"San Mateo, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/1/2012,I have gone to this restaurante twice now and each time I ordered a cheeseburger that was served to me luke warm.  The Cheesecake Factory in SF is much better and same for the one is Salt Lake City.  The service at this one is very much below average.  There is no energy at this location.  I will not be coming back.  :(
Theresa F.,"Fremont, CA",0,14,2,2.0,1/2/2012,"**HAIR IN FOOD ALERT**Went there for a family dinner, hadn't had my son home in over a year; in the service and lives out of state.  We started with a party of 12, then 3 extras showed up unexpectedly; the waitress was kinda cool about it at first but then got irritated that we had a few more than the original plan because they had to bring out a little table to add to our existing table.  The portions at CF are just over the top huge; I've never appreciated that, it's just a stupid waste.  I had the Chinese Chicken salad--5 bites into it I PULLED A THICK, STRAIGHT, LONG, BLACK HAIR from my mouth. I called the manager over and he stood there and just about said ""what""?  His expression was ""lost"" to say the least. He ""compensated me"" by taking the salad off; then gave me a burger& a slice of cheesecake to go and sent us on our way.  My sis ordered the chicken fettucini but didn't get chicken.  She told the server, who responded with ""you didn't order chicken', then returned with a few scraps of chicken on a saucer for her to toss into the fetuccini herself.  I have never had a bad experience at CF before, but this one was a HUGE dissapointment. My kids ended up irritated with me for calling the manager back twice.  I hold him responsible for our BAD experience. Will go back to Macaroni Grill across the parking lot next time! NEVER back to that CF!"
Mimi K.,"San Francisco, CA",46,19,1,1.0,11/4/2011,"Totally disappointed! I came in to Cheesecake Factory for a big birthday brunch with about 25 people. Considering the fact that they weren't taking any reservations, I made sure to call in about 3 weeks prior and asked to talk to the manager. I was hoping she would be able to accommodate a big party such as this at least in some way. She assured me that if we arrived by 10:30 am and were all there that we would be able to get accommodated pretty quickly. Taking her word, my party and I arrived right on time. After a few minutes of waiting, the manager came out to tell me that we would not be seated until 12:00 pm. That did not fly so well for my party and I, and we asked if we could work something out. After offering her many options and her not budging, we finally came to an agreement that we would be seated in the bar area at the high chairs and would start off with some appetizers while they would set up the regular tables for our party. An hour and a half into it, we were still not seated and the elderly people at my party had to leave early because they were so uncomfortable sitting at the high chairs. We kept being promised that we would be seated within the next 15 minutes, but never ended up being seated nor eating the brunch food that we came in there to eat. Our party just ended up leaving. The only thing that was good about it was our server who was a sweetheart."
Mike C.,"Hayward, CA",1,133,,3.0,9/6/2012,"Five stars for the cheese cake. Three stars for the rest of the food and service. But overall I can't quite seem to put myself to give an average of four stars for this place because its just needs to have better food than what it has. The food is inconsistent on the menu. I could get a good orange mandarin chicken dish but then the cheese steak could not be as appetizing. Still, it is a good place to have dinner or a lunch with the friends as it has plenty of seating and is quite busy. It basically makes up 50% of the business at Hillsdale Mall. The cheesecakes are the highlight since it is their namesake. I can order any of the cheesecakes from their menu and be filled. The service is decent but can be a little bit more attentive. I understand it gets really busy but if you put all your attention on the big table, the small table is the one that gets neglected and is also the one that could give you the better tip. All-in-all, I would come back but it depends on the day and time."
Vivian P.,"San Francisco, CA",25,8,,1.0,10/11/2012,"We've gone to this restaurant several times in the past and when we went to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday, I was very shocked at my whole experience.  Here they are: 1. I asked our waitress when they would be serving bread and butter.  We were a groups of about 22 with 7 young children so we were hoping to get bread right away so the kids had something to nibble on while waiting. She responded with a little annoyed tone in her voice, ""We have to serve all the drinks and get all the appetizer orders first.""  The bread and butter was brought out about 30 minutes after we had been there and 5 minutes before our entrees were served. 2. My daughter ordered a hamburger well done.  After several bites, she noticed that it was not well done and mentioned it to the waiter.  The waiter requested another one.  She never got to eat her hamburger because they didn't bring it until we were done with dinner.  She was given a comp cheesecake for this mishap.  Who likes leftover hamburger the next day? 3.  When the appetizers were brought out, the waitresses were asking who ordered what.  There was a bit confusion, and the waitress threw the plate down on the table. 4. The last time we were there my husband ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  It was so good when I tried it that time, that we both ordered it again.  I had initially noticed two larger shrimp and the rest were small salad size shrimp.  My husband's shrimp were the same size as mine, small, and his brown rice was over cooked and crunchy.  My daughter's boyfriend also ordered the shrimp and when I asked him what size his shrimp were, he told me they were all this size - as he had one on his fork which was the same size as the two larger ones that were on our plates.  I mentioned this to the waitress.  She told me that when they don't have the larger shrimp, they'll compensate by giving a lot of smaller shrimp.  The shrimp was the size that you top salads with - SMALL.  The manager came over and told me that they cooked our plates with the wrong shrimp and were giving us two brand new plates to bring home. Needless to say, we'll never go back there again.  It's overrated, crowded, and customer service is less than sub-par for a big group.  BTW, we still tipped the waitress/waiter when we really shouldn't have."
Marjie T.,"Burlingame, CA",120,488,122,4.0,11/12/2011,"i'm happy that we have a cheesecake factory nearby, but my waistline isn't. it's the cheesecake factory we have come to love and i actually don't mind the wait because you can do a little strolling around to pass the time. i think when we were paged, we were near macy's, so there were some good things between there. i took down a star because when there is a new chain restaurant, the service is usually in dire need of fine-tuning, so once they get that down...it should reach the level of service we'd expect."
Dianna D.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/14/2012,"The last two times I have been to this Cheesecake Factory I have been very disappointed!  I generally love the Cheesecake Factory the one at Westfield Mall on Stevens Creek near 880, One in SF near the Union Square and the one in Palo Alto University Avenue.  All such great Pasta dishes!  But, last time I ordered a pasta dish at this Cheesecake Factory it was plain heap of pasta with a whole tomato chopped on top of it with no seasoning!  Then this time I ordered shrimp scampi.  Shrimps weren't in the noodles and sauce but in a circle around pasta breaded -- not any type of shrimp scampi I've ever ate.  Is there a new Chef there or what!!  I've never known the food to be so bad!  Please someone fix it!"
Jhon M.,"Daly City, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/18/2012,"Had lunch at The Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo today with my daughter and was served bread with mold. Sad part is that the cook or the Manager did not even come by to apologize, talk about first class service"
Chris J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,1,4.0,9/23/2012,"Ordered the chicken pasta thing, really good. But since the serving was so huge, no room for desert!"
T. W.,"South San Francisco, CA",51,164,16,2.0,5/29/2012,"I really don't want to give this place a bad rating~ it is The Cheesecake Factory, after all.  Been to a few others in the past, 1st time visiting FC location.  Got there before noon and we were seated immediately.  Food came in a timely manner, service was good.  But the food, unfortunately was not. I normally love beet salad~ and although the beets were fine, I did not like the goat cheese (seriously tasted like the way barn animals smell) or the dressing (had a scented candle/lotion flavor).  I don't think anyone in our party of 7 enjoyed their meal. It wasn't completely BAD, just not good. The bite of cheesecake I tried was delish. But pretty disappointed in the food :("
Miss Almond Shaped Eyes C.,"San Mateo, CA",11,43,5,5.0,3/11/2012,"Cheesecake is my favorite restaurant. I used to frequent the one in Palo Alto until they opened this one.  It is my second time visiting the San Mateo location and I live a block away.  The wait was 25 minutes which isn't bad for a busy spot like this place.  I came here with a friend hadn't seen in about 7 years so we had a lot of catching up to do.  We were seated and then given menus and brought over water.  I kept talking and talking and we weren't looking at the menu.  The chick kept come over and asking if we were ready and my fault, we weren't, but she didn't pressure us or seem annoyed at all.  Finally we put in our appetizer order and shortly after our entrees.  Calamari was good and crispy, came with two sauces and some lemon. I ordered the stuffed chicken tortillas and they were just as good as I remember from Palo Alto.  For desert I had the apple crisp and it was tasty.  We ended up being here for 6 hours and they never rushed us or asked us to leave.  Who does that??? I know we were taking up space for other customers and I thought it was just fabulous that they never said anything.  The experience was overall great.  Will def be back!"
Lauren L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,19,,4.0,11/9/2011,"Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the food here! Not crazy about the wait, but it's worth it in the end : ) The portions are huge too so that's a plus. The place is huge and there's always tons of people so you can only expect so much from the staff."
Gin M.,"San Bruno, CA",125,2,,1.0,6/10/2012,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I love the Cheesecake Factory, I've been to many of them and never been to one like this. It took us 20 minutes for our server to take our drinks down. Then, took another 10 to get them, and took about an hour for our food. He never checked our table for refills for our drinks. Then gave us our check and never came back for our credit card. I had to get up and pay it in the front so I could leave. I will never come back. This place is brand new, and I do not understand why this place has such horrible service."
Debora P.,"Redwood City, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/8/2012,No words to describe how bad this place is. The food was discusting no taste to it oh and costumer service super bad. All the people that work at this place need alot of training starting with the manager dont make your costumer wait 3 hours for a table use your common sense arrange something or due something. I dont want to go into details because there are too many things that happen that night all I can say is that this place sucks and that I am warning people not to waste there time or money. Manager if you get to read this use ur  skill to stay open and have your staff cheat chat less and work more and please go to training . Understant that costumer service is very important in this economy if bussines want to stay open. As I said I dont wants to write  detail by detail because it would take me a long time to write  this rewiew.
