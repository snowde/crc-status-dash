Michelle M.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/11/2012,"Food was ok and the portions are good.  But the service is so bad it overshadows anything good about the restaurant.  We asked to split a salad and they came on one plate.  When the other plate arrived it was warm and the servers did not offer to split the salad.  Just threw a big spoon at us.  We were halfway thru our salad and the main course arrived.  No apologies, just shoved the salad to the side. Ordered a nice bottle of wine and it was way too cold...almost frozen.  I would highly recommend finding another place to dine."
Quick S.,"Burlingame, CA",0,39,23,1.0,10/9/2011,"This place has not worked out its kinks and is definitely not a place to bring young kids.  Although they have a kids menu, they do not have anything to keep them occupied while waiting.  Our wait on a Sunday evening was 1 hour to be seated which was expected since they just opened recently and the Cheesecake Factory has a good reputation elsewhere.  Once we were called, we ended up spending the next 2 hours there.  It was freezing cold as the AC was cranked up.  Luckily, we had extra clothing for our kids to change into to keep them warm.  It was therefore very uncomfortable for me to eat there. The waitress took our drink order right away and we told her about the cold temperature.  She said she would tell the manager but it would take an hour to feel any difference.  We later told the manager (Carl) who was very attentive.  We didn't see our waitress again for about 15 - 20 minutes.  She then hastily dropped off our drinks and took off without taking our order.  She then came back 10 minutes later to take our order.  We must have waited 30 minutes for our food and with 2 young kids, that is not easy.  My husband could not get his food at the same time because they overcooked his pork chop and had to make it again.  The manager immediately came out to apologize and offered an appetizer or soup.  Another 20 minutes passed before he got his food and then another waitress came by with another meal while he was eating his first one.  They did the same thing with his lemonade earlier.  The manager offered some complimentary cheesecake for our bad experience which we accepted.  Although the waitress took our dessert order quickly, we didn't get it for quite a while (not unexpected) as our waitress was chatting with the couple at the next table for 5 minutes. The food is OK but certainly not worth spending 3 hours of my time.  I will not be back any time soon.  The staff needs more training and experience."
Catherine R.,"Macedon, NY",0,49,27,2.0,4/29/2013,"I've found this CF to be declining. When you go to a CF anywhere in the country, you're supposed to know exactly how your meal will be served -- they are very consistent in preparation. I always get one of two choices: the teriyaki chicken or the filet mignon. I ask for the chicken to be boneless, and dozens of times that has meant three smaller boneless, skinless breast pieces. Delicious. Occasionally, it's not prepared the same way. Last week I instead received two giant breasts with the skin. Once I removed the skin, the breast meat was blah and tasteless. When I order the steak, I stress ""no pink"" and suggest that they butterfly it. Still, I've had to send the steak back a few times because it's pink. Also, the seasoning is inconsistent. I notice that the restaurant isn't as packed like it used to be and wonder if others are experiencing the same decline. Some servers are eager to please and have the manager talk to you. Other servers just seem unsure of how to handle the situation."
Carmen M.,"Hayward, CA",2,205,,5.0,9/28/2011,"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory and was glad this location opened up.  The service is not yet the best because they've only been open a week and are still training their staff.  But the food is really good and the desserts are sinful.  Our server was very accomodating though and when there was a confusion with my order, they didn't charge me for it.  That's definitely great customer service, which is hard to come by now-a-days."
Ann A.,"Daly City, CA",1,4,,2.0,3/10/2012,"Loved the decor, and the food was good, but service was very spotty and the servers were not that on the ball.  My husband and I both ordered the orange chicken and specificied that we wanted the lunch portions.  When the larger, dinner portions arrived I asked the person who served them (not our waitress) if the order was correct and really never got an answer.  My husband asked for lemon for his iced tea and it never came.  I did not think that the place was too loud, but the servers seemed to be somewhat deaf.  Would go there again if in the area, but would not drive from Daly City to Hillsdale for the Cheese cake factory.  We did have a piece of cheese cake and it great.  The whole atmosphere and food seem like a glorified Elephant Bar."
Anna L.,"San Mateo, CA",42,33,,3.0,4/17/2012,"I just posted a review on Jack's Prime on burgers, and this afternoon I went to Cheesecake Factory for the happy hour sliders.  Not bad, not bad.  The burgers were juicy, the buns not too soggy and toasted enough, grilled onions and ketchup, but I have to admit almost a flavorless experience.  The Counter's sliders I had over the weekend were better.  However, can't beat that price of $5 compared to almost $9 at its competitor just across the street."
Kay H.,"Foster City, CA",0,26,,2.0,12/4/2013,"This is hands down the worst cheesecake factory I've ever been to and I've been to probably 10 different ones in my lifetime.  The food is not good.  I don't know how you can get cheesecake factory food wrong seeing how it's a chain, but they do get it really wrong here.  The food is overly greasy and not tasty.  The bread is even off.  It's overly hot and then tough and chewy.  It's like they microwaved it.  The only thing that's good is the cheesecake and I don't expect them to mess that up since they don't make it in house.  It's made offsite and frozen.  All they have to do is defrost it.  Although, they did manage to semi-ruin my cheesecake experience by serving brown/dried bananas with my banana cream cheesecake.  We recently had my son's birthday dinner here and after an hour wait for our table the waitress was slow as molasses forgetting our drink orders and not checking back in.  We had to hunt her down gabbing with a big group of other servers to tell her we needed something.  It took an additional 2 hours to complete our dinner!  My son fell asleep waiting for them to come and sing happy birthday to him.  I'd be willing to drive the extra 10 miles down to PA or SF to experience better."
Josie L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,,4.0,2/11/2012,"I've been to this restaurant several times and have gotten really great service. After reading previous reviews, I thought it's best to go during non-peak hours.  I order off the skinny menu and really like the chicken salad sandwich meal and the delicious sweet corn fritters (not from the skinny menu).  We appreciated the attentive wait staff and very good service.   I always look forward to having a  nice meal here with family and friends!"
Julie S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/5/2012,"the cheesecake factory has WAY more than cheesecake! I love the salads and the appetizers and small starters.  The service is great and they have a very convenient curbside pickup.  No going into the mall, just pull up and they bring it out quick and consistently delicious."
Helen V.,"San Mateo, CA",0,16,,5.0,1/30/2012,great food and plenty to go around. their dishes are very tasty and enough to fill two people. good price and very clean environment..
Tara B.,"Burlingame, CA",5,36,,4.0,2/17/2012,"i love this place but it takes to long to cook, a long wait to get in and it was really loud"
Brian S.,"Foster City, CA",262,1168,,5.0,12/20/2012,"I so finally got to try this last night and I know what all the fuss is about; good food, drinks, and of course, the star which is cheesecake at a little more than moderate.  But, you definitely get what you pay for.  Having had a big lunch, we opted for hors deorves.  The spicy ahi tuna rolls are crispy and greasless with fresh ahi, rice, and a light sauce; I love the soy dipping sauce as it is a good contrast.  The chicken pot stickers are crispy golden with a wonderful seasoned chicken filling; perfect with the vinegar.  The texmex egg rolls are crispy and greasless with a plethora of black beans, corn, chicken, and cheese perfect with either the fresh salsa or sour cream or both.  The crab won tons crispy and greasless are huge and filled with real crab meat.  The sweet & sour sauce is well balanced.  Our server, Irene, was very friendly and making recommendations and made sure we were doing well.  Round it off with a cold Stella and you you will not be disappointed.  I intend to return to try more items, including the entrees and of course the cheesecakes.  We enjoyed being seated in the fake open air section.  The best thing is is that if there is a wait, you are given a buzzer and can go off shopping until you are buzzed.  So, for excellent food and big portions at a little more than moderate with friendly service in a casual yet trendy atmosphere, Cheesecake Factory cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!"
David C.,"Burlingame, CA",2,49,,2.0,1/1/2013,"Went to CCF on the 1st  day of the year.  Was with a party totaling 8 people.  Initially told we would be seated at 7:35 pm a 45 minute wait.  No problem as CCF does not accept reservations and it was pretty busy.  At  8:00 we had not been seated, I asked the hostess, she said they were setting our table.  At 8:15 I pointed out our table to the host, she said they had run out of clean silverware and it would be just a few more minutes. At 8:25 we sat down.  Quite a few menu items were not available, obviously the restaurant had gotten slammed on New Years  Eve and had no deliveries on New Years Day.  Our waitress had to return to our table three times to advise something we had ordered was no longer available.  Calamari and most salmon dishes  were unavailable.  Overall the food was fine, comfort food is usually pretty simple and tasty.  I had the Shepherd's pie, it is always tasty.  The drinks were fine.  table service was a bit slow, in the past this waitress had done a pretty good job but tonight things just were not running smoothly.  We waited for quite a long time just to see her to ask for to go containers.   One desert I asked for she said was seasonal and no longer available, I advised her it was in the cold case in front of the store and still available.  She accepted our order for another cheese cake, vanilla bean  only to come back a few minutes later to advise it was no longer available.   My point it this, CCF is a big chain and should have an understanding of what to keep on hand year to year, someone screwed up as they seemed to be out of quite a few items, wait staff seemed slow and confused as did the host.  They just did not have things in order tonight.  I will return, I hope they clean up their act, have enough staff on hand to handle the crowd, wash the silverware etc.   Also, the mandatory tip for parties of eight or more is BS if they cannot handle the group in a satisfactory manner.  It was over 15%, I think it is either 16% or 18%.  I don't mind leaving 20% but expect things to run smoothly."
Only The Blunt Truth A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/30/2011,I had my comment removed before due to its content regarding employee issues instead...well it's my feeling that what's going on within a company does extend to its customers.  Due to what I do know I no longer eat at the Cheesecake.  There is alot of disrespect in the kitchen amongst the workers and I wonder if the customers ever hear it.  They're mainly young Hispanics cooking and it appears they don't like the Caucasians they have to work with.  Cheesecake also states they pay up to $13 an hour for line cook but really hire on people at $9 and less.  They also don't get their benefits until after working for 9 months and some 600+ hours before they can even see any medical or dental coverage.  Don't think this has nothing to do with how the service is or how the food comes out of the kitchen because IT DOES!!!  I'm tired of hearing of the harassment and cussing going on here.  Management needs to rid of the perpetrators and the workers who don't show up or are hours late to work before I think professionalism can be and in turn be shown to the customers.
Michelle L.,"San Mateo, CA",2,9,,2.0,2/14/2012,This is for take-out service.  I ordered on the phone and was told my order would be ready in 20 min.  I live about 5 min away so that was no problem.  I get to Hillsdale at precisely 20 min after I ordered and parked in the spaces reserved for take-out (many other people park here and it's not to utilize the take-out service).  I called the phone number to let them know I was there.  Then nothing...I waited 15 minutes and called again.  It's another 10 minutes before anyone appears.  They come take my card and go back inside to complete the transaction.  They finally come back out with my receipt and my food.  I get home and find...1. The food is cold (not suprising since I had to wait 25 minutes from my appointed time to get my food) 2. They gave me an extra piece of random cheesecake - not sure what that was about.  Food was ok - got the cuban sandwich and was suprised that the pork was like a pork chop.  Cold fries are never good.  Cheesecake always good though.  Have been back for in house dining and the food is ok - kind of greasy for my taste though.
Nassima K.,"San Mateo, CA",13,5,,4.0,2/27/2012,"how can you go wrong with cheesecake! while you are there try the chicken sliders, for happy hour they are only $5, and you get 4 of them. they are so good! i go there for happy hour and there is a whole menu for $5, and beer, margarias, and mojitos are $5 as well. VERY NICE!"
Sabine S.,"Redwood City, CA",7,80,5,4.0,10/14/2011,"So hard to rate this place since the food is what you're used to getting at any of their locations: really good. The service is, like everybody else is saying, sloooowwww. And yes our waiter disappeared on us too. Went there last night, Thursday at 7 pm, found a table in the bar right away. Waited for menus.  Waitress at table next to us was taking orders, collecting menus and walked away not bothering to hand us 2. I got up and picked them up from front desk, inpatient me! Normal wait to place order, no appetizers just entrees. Drinks arrived and we waited and waited for food. 3 different employees showed up over the course of about half hour, saying it should be out any minute. Hah! Finally I got my pork chop, my daughter had ordered the petit filet with French fries but only got the filet. Fries came 15 minutes later after she was done. They were very apologetic and offered us free cheesecake but since we're both not a fan of cheesecake we declined. Both our meats were cooked to perfection, my pork chop came with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach, delicious. And can't complain about the waiter except that at one time he disappeared for about 15 minutes. Break? I know it just opened and I think I'll wait a month or so before I go back until everything runs smoothly. I kept thinking of Chef Ramsey and ""Kitchen Nightmares"" that's what this whole experience reminded me of. The whole dinner took almost 2 hours. So if you're hungry order appetizers because they seem to be leaving the kitchen really fast but entrees take much too long."
Jean H.,"Hayward, CA",3,3,,1.0,10/13/2011,"Bad experience here. Had to wait 1/2 hour which wasn't bad since it was lunchtime (1pm). Finally got seated and we were ignored for 5 minutes until we had to flag someone down to get a glass of water. Waitress took our order, and totally screwed it up. My sister ordered a med./well burger which was raw in the middle. My mother ordered a BLT and got a chicken avacado sandwich, and never got the salad that came with it. My sister also didn't get her french fries because the power went out for a few minutes and they said they couldn't cook the fries. Obviously they couldn't finish cooking her burger too. So the waitress apologizes for everything and asked if we want to take the food home! HELLO it was not cooked and not what we ordered. Needless to say, the manager came by and said it would be no charge  (you think! couldn't even eat it) This place needs to work out all the all the kinks and get their shit together. Hope it makes it!"
Jon R.,"Alamo, CA",0,15,,1.0,10/3/2011,"My wife and I just came back from a terrible first experience at the new San Mateo cheese cake factory. the wait was long but expected due to it being new. First of all my wife received her meal 15 min before I got my simple hamburger. Then our onion rings were forgotten. We told the waiter and he went and placed a new order. We waiting until 45 min AFTER our meal was done and after at least 7 check ins with the waiter we were told that they didnt know why it was taking so long. My wife and I just got fed up and left telling the ""new"" waiter that we were fed up and couldnt understand why it would take over an hour just to get an order of onion rings. Our time after sitting down to the time we left was over 2 hours for a burger and pasta!  on top of that my wifes angel pasta with shrimp was dry and not at all acceptable. I was so fed up I didnt even stay to wait in line to complain to the manager, Worse experience ever. We will not be going back again"
