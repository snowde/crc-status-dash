Deb O.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,17,3,5.0,1/7/2018,"There hasn't been a time Cheesecake Factory has let me down. Which is why I go back frequently and tell my friends and colleagues!  Cheesecake Factory has catered meetings at work as well. Delicious!!  Anywhere I travel, Cheesecake Factory has the great food I can count on & excellent servers/employees.   I was going home to have a sandwich but I'm  turning around for the Factory's Chicken piccata!        Can't wait to sit at the bar and have some  conversation the guys and gals that are working!!!   And eat a lot of awesome food!  Always leftovers or midnight snack!   Love it!                     Thank you!                             Deb Oday"
Jesus E.,"Ann Arbor, MI",155,116,80,3.0,1/9/2018,"Call me basic but I love a Cheesecake factory moment. The food is always solid - I usually do the spicy cashew chicken (not spicy in the least but it is delicious). The huge portions ensure you'll have you'll have something to eat for lunch the next day. I do have a soft spot for their cheesecakes. My faves are the red velvet and the banana cream. The Valley Faire location is always insanely busy so definitely expect a bit of a wait, both to be seated and to get your food. Because of how full it always is, it also tends to be pretty loud. Last time I was there my friend and I ordered the grilled cheese sticks and nashville hot chicken nuggets and it was quite a wait before we got them. They ended up coming out after our entrees. Despite the chaos, it was a solid lunch overall."
rob s.,"Mountain View, CA",1,27,15,1.0,1/7/2018,"Was seated at 4:20 and placed our order for appetizer and entries around 4:30.  Appetizer arrived after 5pm.  A new server introduced himself and informed us that the previous server had left for the day and notified us that the entree orders had not been entered in the kitchen by the previous server.  One of the assistant managers stopped by and said the entrees would be at our table in ten minutes. That was at 5pm. She didn't even apologise for the delay.  I asked to speak with the manager and he profusely apologised for the issue and promised to bring our dinner right away.  5:40 pm and we were served our entree and it was piping hot.  But we were no longer hungry.  As a consolation, the manager offered us one free slice of cheesecake. There was four of us at the table.  Very disappointed at the experience.  The new server was very courteous and we made sure he wasn't held accountable with a generous tip."
George L.,"Cupertino, CA",475,192,235,4.0,1/1/2018,"Ahh... The Cheesecake Factory. We made the happy mistake of coming on a Saturday night at 6:00pm over the holiday weekend, but I was surprised that we only had to wait for 30-45 minutes given how busy the place was! I've been to this location several times now, and I really enjoy the ambiance of the place including its tall ceilings, dimly lit interior, and spacious seating. We had really great service and the food was highly satisfying and comforting! We had the complimentary bread (mmm), the Korean Fried Cauliflower (highly recommend), the Crispy Cuban Rolls (comes with 6 delicious halves), the Four Cheese Pasta (very filling), the Chicken & Biscuits (good chicken), the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken (wholesome chicken), and the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon (not dry!). We were planning on ordering some cheesecake afterwards but were too full this time. People seem to have varying opinions about The Cheesecake Factory, but me and my family happen to be quite fond of it! It's great for casual celebrations and/or a nice, slightly classier meal!"
Francesca P.,"Watsonville, CA",53,64,164,3.0,1/6/2018,"Stopped by here for a late lunch . My sister and I were greeted with a smile by the host and we were seated promptly.  We each had only been here once before and that had been a long time ago.  My sister got a chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries and I ordered the Shepard's pie. The waitress was nice and friendly she brought some bread and butter to start us off.  Our food came and was pretty good. My sister liked her sandwich and the flavors of the Shepard's pie were tasty . I had never had one before and this one was quit good.  On to the best part , cheesecake !  They have a HUGE selection, was so hard to pick just one. We shared a chocolate hazelnut with Nutella on top and it was so delicious!  I ordered a cherry cheesecake to go for the boyfriend. That one was just a cheesecake with cherry preserves .  Overall good experience would go back again ."
Vivek S.,"San Jose, CA",3,6,6,1.0,1/4/2018,"Went here for dinner, orderd veggie burger for myself and wife orderd Cajun Chicken Little, after 35 minutes server informed us that meal is almost prepared. Then 10 minutes after they brought wife's order and gave me side of salad while I was waiting for veggie burger still no courtesy to tell why order is delayed. While we were waiting for out food manager came and informed us that our order was by mistake served to some other table and he apologized for that. Understood! But it was not even a busy day. When we finally got our order after waiting for 1 hour bun was burnt and patty was over cooked. I couldn't eat that burger and had to leave disappointed this kind of service is not acceptable from such restaurant.  Oh and I gave 1 stars just beacuse of Manager!!"
Jason M.,"San Jose, CA",113,217,246,4.0,1/5/2018,"Really only 2 things that aren't fun when coming to Cheesecake Factory, 1. The wait  2. The parking So many good things about this place, food, desert, appetizers, bread, butter, drinks.  It's all good.   I like to be seated near the back, it tends to be more intimate and private.  The lighting here is good, flow goes well once your seated.   I enjoy  Ribeye steak - it's a great cut marbled and juicy seasoned well, the mashed potatoes are sweet light and delicious, veggies are almost never over cooked like most places.   Seared tuna - sometimes you get a great piece sometimes you don't it's a hit or miss on this dish for me.   Glazed salmon - same as tuna, but usually cooked nicely and moist.   Kobe burger - awesome, just awesome.  When you look at the menu as if the choices are just overwhelming, go for the burger and your good to go.  Juicy, drizzly, and delicious.   Cheesecake galore take your pick and eat up.   Martini -  they make a mean martini, just great here.   Get past that wait and enjoy a nice dinner."
Ngoc P.,"San Jose, CA",107,83,67,4.0,12/29/2017,"Back to the basics  My true rating is a 3.5 but since there's no option for that, I picked 4(rounding it up). Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. There is nothing too special but it has what I need. I usually come here for two things : happy hour and pasta da vinci. No matter where I go, I always come back to pasta da vinci. It's just one of those heavy and comfort foods that I gravitate towards once in a while.  Pasta Da Vinci - creamy pasta with chicken & mushrooms. It has a nice creamy consistency without it being too overwhelmingly rich. Tamales - savory with a little bit of sweentness which makes a good combination of yumminess. Buffalo wings - just your typical wings. It's nothing special but it's good. Chicken sliders - same, nothing special but good. Parking can be b****. Especially when it's close to valleyfair. Those who have been here during the holidays know how crowded it can get and finding a parking space can be challenging unless you're willing to do valet or pay 5$ to park in their small lot."
Joe A.,"Arcata, CA",23,21,2,2.0,12/24/2017,"We ate as a party of 8. 4 in their 70s and 4 younger. The restaurant has a policy of not allowing us to sit until 80% of our party was in the house.  What that policy meant for us is....4 tired old travelers who wanted to sit down and start buying drinks had to stand and wait. The restaurant was not busy, so...... Otherwise it was ok....."
CeeJay F.,"San Jose, CA",661,21,90,5.0,12/28/2017,"Just wanted to start my review by giving Jaimie a big big ""Thank You!"" for her excellent service tonight on my parent's anniversary dinner. Very patient with us, asked if we had any questions with the menu, and checked in time to time to see if we needed anything after getting our food.  Thank you for going above and beyond by making my parents a little Happy Anniversary dessert plate after you guys said you usually don't, only for birthdays. I really appreciate it so much that you made it happen. It made our whole dining experience tonight an amazing one, ending it on a high note. I always get the combo items every time I come here because you get two items for around $23 and it's really not a bad deal at all. It's a great selection of combos and it gets you pretty full.  But I thought I'd try something new tonight...and when I asked about the Miso Salmon, Jaimie pretty much sold it to me and I'm really glad that I ordered that tonight. I'm happy to have found my second favorite dish to get there besides the combos, the first one being the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. I think it's wonderful that you have an option of brown rice as well which is what I got with my Miso Salmon dish. The brown rice wasn't dry and was not too moist either, it was perfect. The salmon itself was great! Perfectly cooked, complemented well with the sauce on the sides all around the plate. I paired the rice and the sauce because it tasted so good. Haha. Plating was very appealing! (I recommend this dish if anyone wants to try something new within the Salmon area) For you with venturous taste buds, my little brother got the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It's actually pretty good! He says it's cheesy and the patty was cooked perfectly (medium well). It sure will get you full and it comes with a side choice of fries and I believe the other choice was salad? I might be wrong. But this was another really great dish!  My cousin ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Portion was good! He said it was pretty spicy! It had green pasta, the shrimp was peeled and it didn't have a tail, so it was easy to eat! It also came with chicken and the chicken was tender itself. Another dish he recommends to get if you're looking for anything in the pasta area! The environment is just like any other Cheesecake Factory, a little dark and intimate. Taking pictures is a little hard, but nothing a flash can fix. The wait also varies on what day you go and time. But it is worth the wait! Next time I'll make room for cheesecake! Haha. Thank you again Jaimie for your amazing service! Be sure to ask for her if you have the chance to! I definitely will when I come back again!"
Emily L.,"San Jose, CA",20,382,1183,3.0,1/7/2018,"I always like coming here for pasta!!!! steak diane is a good choice as well. deep fried mac n cheese is bomb. i love their mai tai's as well. After my dinner, i never make it to dessert and always get a plain cheese cake slice togo!"
Lauri P.,"San Jose, CA",144,6,11,1.0,12/7/2017,"Placed a to-go order at 4 pm.  Estimated to be delivered by 5:10 pm.   6:10 rolls by, one hour late and I call them and they say that the restaurant had computer issues and are still working on it.  6:40 pm rolls by and they call me to say they want to cancel my order.  No apology, no offer to make things right.  I asked if they could just make my order now and rush it now.  They just hung up on me. Very hungry and pissed off."
Anu P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,11,9,2.0,12/28/2017,"Went here for dinner. Ordered Korean fried cauliflower, it looks good but it has a bitter taste. Then ordered bowtie pasta with chicken in alfredo white sauce. It was also a waste not worth the price.  Only the cheesecakes are good in here. The place is crowded. But You have valet parking and also there are many nearby parking in this area"
Jocey H.,"San Jose, CA",19,109,166,4.0,9/30/2017,"This is my go-to spot whenever I feel like splurging a little bit. We normally come here for birthdays, holidays, and their lunch happy hour..  The only bad thing I have to say about this place is their front desk. They're always so rude here! They do not greet, smile, or say thank you. First impressions are everything and this always makes my visit so uncomfortable.  About the food: I'm loyal to one dish and one dish only. The garlic chicken farfalle  is hands down the best pasta dish they have here. That's the only thing I ever order when i visit TCF. Love how they have fresh grated parmesan as well..  They also serve complementary sour dough and brown bread with butter. So good!!! I always get full before my entree comes out.  Spent around $40 for 2 dishes (before tax)"
Andrea C.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,5.0,1/5/2018,"Have been to this location quite a few times. But this time was really nice. I have no idea my servers name but she was so sweet. She got our drinks and food out with enough time to not rush through our appetizers.  I got a side Caesar salad and Eggplant Parmesan. My boyfriend ordered an appetizer and the gumbo which he already loves. I've never had their eggplant parm and told the lady I am super picky with this particular dish as I grew up helping make it from scratch. She came back after I took a few bites to see if I liked it. I can honestly say it was great!  Our server was very friendly, extremely attentive and efficient. If I could remember her name, I would definitely go to sit in her section again."
Cindy M.,"San Jose, CA",196,338,853,3.0,9/19/2017,"Another birthday meal at TCF, this time dinner. Monday night and the wait was only 10 minutes. Our server Adeline wasn't the most enthusiastic, but was friendly. We'd later find out that she was slightly forgetful. Not trying to be hard on her but I'm going to be honest and give 3 stars instead of 4 stars for this visit. I would recommend that empty plates be removed when your server comes to the table. That wasn't done initially. Later in the meal it was.  For starters, our group had the eggroll sampler. Loved two out of the four (firecracker and salmon). Moving on to the chicken sliders deluxe. There were four large sliders with a side of fries. This alone would probably be good if you were here for drinks and appetizers. We weren't about to stop there, not this time. Onto the entrees. Birthday guest had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. As you know, the portions are huge so half was packed up the next day. Second meal was the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger which was enjoyed thoroughly by a burger-holic. Nice combo of bacon topped with pork belly. They barely finished it. Third meal was the surf & turf w/ Steak Diane Salmon combo w/ asparagus. Asked for med-rare on both fish and steak, but it was slightly overcooked in my opinion. The Steak Diane was okay. Salmon was good.  Both red wines I had were tasty. However, the Lyric Pinot Noir was better than the red blend. Finally, dessert was on the radar. During our dinner we heard about six birthday songs so we were in good company. Our server had a buddy come over to help her sing and our group joined in of course. The birthday guest was presented with a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake decorated nicely with the typical hot-fudge birthday wish written on the plate, colorful sprinkles, mounds of whipped cream and a birthday candle. It was oh so good. Light and creamy. Kids hot fudge sundae was good as well.  TCF is still the most diverse menu for your dining experience. Does it always knock your taste buds out of the park...? No, not really, but you can satisfy any craving nonetheless."
Shaun H.,"San Jose, CA",160,262,290,3.0,11/4/2017,"If there's a restaurant on the planet with a larger selection of menu items than The Cheesecake Factory I would be surprised.  The waitress placed a tome in front of each of us, it made a heavy thud.  Reading it was a project, decisions, decisions.  We needed more time, so we ordered drinks, a classic stall tactic.  Then a couple appetizers:  dynamite shrimp and cuban rolls. Finally we ordered.  I had chicken madeira.  My three dining partners had jambalaya pasta, salmon and hibachi steak.  The drinks and appetizers came quickly.  The dynamite shrimp were tiny fried shrimp with some slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Meh.  The Cuban rolls were an egg roll cut in half, stuffed with shredded pork, ham, melted cheese and some pickle-mustard sauce.  Cuban sandwich fillings in an eggroll?  Some fusion is bomb, this was a bit of a dud.  Not bad but not fantastic. Our main courses took a long long time.  I'm sure it's hard for the kitchen to support such a large menu.  So many things to cook.  My chicken madeira was burnt on the bottom, not charred, burnt.  It took me a few bites to get past that, but he sauce was decent.  My dining partners all reported that their entrees were ""ok."" We all ordered cheesecake to go.  I had my strawberry cheesecake later that night and it was super good. The Cheesecake Factory can be great, depending on what you order and who cooks it, but it can also be just ok.  I've never had a bad meal here, but it seldom blows me away.  The wide selection is great for groups with picky eaters because there is literally something for everyone.  However that large menu comes at a price.  They don't master it all.  Still, it's worth the occasional visit, especially for dessert.  I have never had a bad cheesecake here."
Elvis N.,"San Jose, CA",258,151,246,4.0,8/29/2017,"I love cheesecake. Where better to satisfy a late night craving than The Cheesecake Factory?  While I haven't tried dining here for their actual food, I've had plenty of their cheesecakes. But hey it's called The Cheesecake Factory, not Overpriced Pasta Factory. If I wanted that, I would go to Maggiano's across the street.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake topped with a mango mousse on a thick vanilla coconut macaroon crust is my favorite. Any cheesecake needs a good amount of citrus to balance out that fatty filling. The mango offers a unique tartness that the other cakes don't, including strawberry (which would be my second). The cheesecakes are great, service even for a supposed grab-and-go setup was and is always terrible, and the interior albeit nice is way too dark. Come for the cakes."
Kashish A.,"San Jose, CA",4,45,270,4.0,1/1/2018,Our server C j was amazing and I should say best server we had in all our trips to cheese cake factory very friendly  polite efficient and aware of the menu . We were there for   Late lunch and as soon as our order went in the computers were down but Cj did everything in his control to make our experience pleasant . Thanks to him will be back again .
Neha G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",66,33,40,5.0,1/3/2018,Best at what they are making. Love their cheezcake. Haven't tried their full meal course but looking forward to it.
Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",968,1930,3483,4.0,12/14/2017,"I like the Oakridge location better because the layout feels more open but all the Cheesecake Factories are ultimately the same. I have always had a positive dining experience here. The wait here can be long despite this place being around for a while and despite all of the various dining options around this area. Favorites of mine are their chicken madeira, chicken marsala and pastas. The interior is dim and moody but loud/lively. It is good for a family dinner or date (but not a first date...since the volume in here is pretty loud and maybe it might be hard to converse). Their menu is huge and includes a long list of delicious cheesecake options. It is hard to come here without wanting dessert."
Felicia C.,"Menlo Park, CA",219,84,209,3.0,7/9/2017,"The interior of Cheesecake Factory is beautiful and very clean. It was also really crowded so I suggest coming here early. We came at 5:30 and our food was brought at 6:45. We waited about an hour for our food, but in the meantime, the waiter brought us some bread, wheat and sourdough. My friends and I ordered the jambalaya pasta, eggplant Parmesan, original cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. Jambalaya pasta- The pasta had a unique flavor to it. It's basically jambalaya mixed with pasta. There were some shrimp and chicken in the dish. The sauce was very yummy. I would order this again. Eggplant Parmesan- The fried eggplant was extremely oily. So oily to the point that I didn't want to finish the dish. The outside wasn't crispy anymore. But the cheese and the marinara sauce was really good. The eggplant also came with some pesto pasta which was even more oily. I don't think I would order this dish again. Onto dessert!!! Original cheesecake- YESSSS! This is what they're famous for. It was creamy and tasted sooo good. Probably one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted, so I would definitely order this again. Tiramisu cheesecake- I expected it to taste at least a little like cheesecake, but it didn't at all. The tiramisu flavor overpowered the cheesecake flavor, so basically it was just tiramisu. I would have liked some cheesecake flavors, and this disappointed me, so I don't think I would order this again. Overall my experience at Cheesecake Factory was ok. The service was really slow and some dishes I didn't really like. The next time I go here, I will order new dishes to try, and I hope the service is faster."
Shannon W.,"Cupertino, CA",1663,159,483,2.0,7/1/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Westfield Valley Fair in West San Jose, next to Macy's mens. We came on a Saturday for lunch at 1pm, and got seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was very nice! We got the crab cake appetizer ($13) and factory combo: herb crusted salmon and filet mignon with mashed potatoes ($22.50). The food came pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. However, I didn't have a great experience for the value. For a lunch costing a total of $45 for 2, with only one appetizer and one entree, it was VERY little food.  The crabcakes appetizer comes with THREE crabcakes, with like a 2 inch diameter, tiny!! The two sauces were great, but it's not proportional to the amount of crabcake they gave! Delicious, but really not worth it.  The salmon and filet mignon pieces were also extremely small. The salmon was like 2x4 inches, and not incredibly good. The filet mignon was 3 small, thin pieces.. They didn't skimp on the mashed potato though. Gave an awful lot of that. But that's not worth $23 is it.  Also, I really like the wheat grain bread at the Cheesecake chains. So the first waiter for 1 wheat grain and 1 sourdough bread, and my friend and I finished that. so we asked for some more wheat grain bread, and it took 25 minutes for that to come out. We finally got to eat some bread.. after we finished our meal. It also took a really long time to flag someone down and give us a check.  This place has the decor, good location, and fine food, but the portions are incredibly skimpish and the service is lacking. I would not come back again."
K K.,"San Jose, CA",7,106,20,1.0,10/2/2017,"An absolute joke today!!! Just a complete freaking joke. I can't believe this place is staying in business with what I have experienced today!!!  It's taken over 17minutes just to get to the person to actually try and place an order. This after Victoria from the front desk refused 3 times to help me! The. I was hung up on twice!!! I call back to get a manage and another 4 minutes of being on hold and surprise surprise Maria from the bakery answers ready to take my order. Hmm, but no manager. Whatever. Way too much aggravation for this garbage!!!  Do NOT come here. Do NOT order take out from here. You're just going to get the runaround and treated like crap. Jason was the manager that refused to come to the phone when I asked for one. Or perhaps just made excuses why it took so long. Just another 7minutes waste of my time."
Alison Y.,"Fremont, CA",502,74,316,2.0,6/14/2017,"The only time I think of coming to The Cheesecake Factory is if I'm going with a large group to celebrate something. They're great for accommodating big parties, so I'll give them that. But in terms of their food, I'd much rather eat elsewhere.  We got here a little before 6:00 PM on a Sunday (after a failed attempt to eat at Din Tai Fung, which had an estimated 2 hour wait time - yikes!!), and we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The first part of our dining experience went pretty smoothly. Getting our drinks, ordering, and receiving our appetizers (and their delicious complimentary bread) all happened in a timely manner.  APPETIZERS: The WARM CRAB & ARTICHOKE DIP was very flavorful and paired really with their crunchy grilled bread! This was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. The NASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN NUGGETS were pretty good as well and not that spicy thankfully.  MAIN COURSE: Everything that went wrong during this portion of the meal is why I'm only giving this restaurant 2 stars. Strike #1: My mom ordered a Filet Mignon, and they didn't bring her a steak knife. She had to flag down our server to ask for one, which took some time. Strike #2: My dad ordered an omelette, which was offered with a side of potatoes or tomatoes. He went with tomatoes, and when the dish was delivered, there were no tomatoes. He had to ask about it, and our server eventually brought it out for him after. Strike #3: My brother ordered the factory combination with Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. And there was a piece of plain cooked pasta in his dish when his order clearly had no pasta items. Seems like sloppy food service or poor quality control to me... And lastly, I ordered pasta with shrimp and sausage, which was just average.  DESSERT: How could you come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake? We went with a slice of the mango key lime, which was a great option if you're looking for a not-so-sweet option."
Sara R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,1,,3.0,12/29/2017,"I Went there with my family to celebrate my son Bday.We made a reservation for 8 pl , 6:15 pm and when we came to the restaurant we had to wait for 15  min .Then we order food and it take them 60 min to bring the food and on top of it my son order hamburger without the cheese ,no mayo and they bring us with the cheese .We told the waiter about the wrong dish and he was apologize and tell us he will fix it.  When we got the new dish my son got it with the cheese and mayo on it :( We ask for the manger and she was very nice she went to the kitchen and bring us the dish after another 33 min that all of us already finished the food .I've to say that the customer service was nice and they gave us a compensation.Only because of the nice customer service I'll give them a second chance."
Gabriella T.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",84,90,92,4.0,9/29/2017,"This Is just one of many chain Cheesecake Factory stores that I have been to and most of them are honestly 3 star levels for me but this one I give 4 to mostly for the service. Came in here during lunch of a Wednesday with two of my girlfriends and got seated right away. Our waitress was super friendly, but sadly I forgot to get her name. My friends and I weren't too hungry so we just shared their Wild mushroom soup, fried Mac n cheese balls, and their four cheese pasta. I told her I really like their wild mushroom soup ( which they only served on Wednesdays) and she was so nice to give me a free small one to-go when I left ! I was surprised at the nice gesture. +1 star for that.  The rest of the food was decent but the thing that made it ok was the price, everything at cheesecake it a little bit higher priced than I would've liked. Oh and don't forget about the complimentary wheat bread (or brown bread some people say), I always ask for extra of that stuff !  Overall decent food, prices are higher, but I got a really great server this time !"
Cathleen F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",23,16,5,1.0,12/27/2017,"For horrendous service, this restaurant takes the (cheese)cake. If zero stars was an option, that would have been a no-brainer. 1. Very short staffed. Everything took a very, very long time. 2. Two out of four of our bread plates were visibly dirty. 3. They were out of fish for their Fish 'n' Chips (my husband doesn't eat meat, so that matters to us). 4. My pasta dish was terrible. 5. The customer service was horrible. My husband and I arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night, the day after Christmas, with our two year old and four year old, for a nice anniversary dinner. Our main mission was cheesecake, but we decided to have some dinner first. It was crowded but the wait was only about twenty minutes, so that was reasonable to us. We were seated at our table and after five minutes or so, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she came a while later, we mentioned that our plates were dirty and asked if she could bring new ones when she brought the bread. I heard her mention to our neighboring table that they were out of bread and that they were making more, so I knew it would be a while (and it was). But when she came to bring the bread a while later, no new plates. Waited a while for new plates. We knew what we wanted but waited quite some time, again, for the waitress to come take our orders. Then we went to place said order only to find out they were out of fish. We picked a replacement item fairly quickly but it still took a very long time to get the food. When the food arrived, my husband's eggplant parmesan was great, but my dish (Shrimp with Angel Hair with the basil garlic lemon cream sauce from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish) was terrible. It was watery, flavor-less, and seemed to be missing any trace of salt (I never thought I'd say this of a big chain restaurant, where salt is never in short supply). It looked somewhat creamy, but very, very watery. I tried salting it a couple times and mentioned it to the waitress so she brought some parmesan. That didn't make a big difference so she offered to bring some alfredo sauce. That kind of helped, but by that point it had been a long time and I had just sort of given up hope. My kids were eating the plain pasta (as most kids would), and I ate what I could so as not to be wasteful. Even without kids (who were being so well behaved and patient), I would not have wanted to extend my stay at that restaurant any longer by ordering something else or having it re-made. Not that that was even offered.  After experiencing the super slow service, dirty plates, and dissatisfying food, we thought it prudent to try to resolve it with a manager. We explained the issues to him, were very friendly, understanding and empathetic, and he seemed personable and apologetic. After listening and explaining that they were very short staffed, apologizing for the pasta dish not turning out very well, he offered a cheesecake as a resolution. In my head, I was thinking a whole cheesecake is pretty expensive and probably more than we need, but maybe they have small ones. And even then, if my pasta dish was $20 and a cheesecake is maybe $50, cost of food + bad experience = not that excessive in terms of compensation. So our waitress asks what kind of cheesecake we'd like, we tell her we'd like the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, but to go (2 year old was starting to fall asleep at the table, can't blame him). When she comes with our to-go bag, there's one small slice of cheesecake in it. My husband and I look at each other like, um, is this happening right now? Is this worth fighting over?

Ok, that's not the worst part. I ordered a kids fettuccine Alfredo, a pear and blue cheese flat bread, veggie burger and slice of cheesecake. The order was almo $60. The food finally arrives and the pasta has NO SAUCE on it. None. How does that even happen? After we waited for over an hour. My 12 year old was not happy. I had to get out of bed and go to McDonald's. The whole point of ordering door dash was so that I did not have to do that because I was sick in bed. The burger was cold. Not warm, no room temperature but cold. After I go get my son food. I come home. Warm up the flat bread and burger. Eat those two items and within two hours I was in the bathroom throwing up. ALL NIGHT! I don't know what was going on yesterday but my experience was terrible. Three emails to doordash and no response BUT Doordash didn't prepare the food. CHEESECAKE FACTORY DID  Update: as you can see Cheesecake Factory responded with a generic response below. Doordash was late delivering the food. However, Cheesecake Factory is the one that prepared the food incorrectly. It would be nice if someone took responsibility here. $53.00 wasted."
Melissa P.,"Arcadia, CA",118,5,,2.0,1/10/2018,"""Curbside"" was a train wreck this past visit.  I arrived the 20 minutes recommended after ordering only to find no one was picking up either the posted curbside number or regular restaurant number.  I waited 10 minutes and even though my baby was sleeping I got out her car seat and went in to pick up my ""curbside"" order.  I continued to wait in line for 10 minutes before ever getting to speak with someone only to find my order was STILL not ready for ""a few minutes""...  whatever that meant.  It was only ONE ITEM.  Many people looked perturbed like they were also unhappy and waiting for a long time.  The employees looked stressed and scrambling around as if they'd been the weeds for awhile.  I waited for 10 more minutes then asked to cancel my order and left empty handed.  What a horrible horrible experience.  The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because when I have time to dine in the food is always great and the servers are always nice.  Lesson learned...  DO NOT ORDER CURBSIDE SERVICE, YOU MAY JUST STARVE."

Brenda L.,"Syracuse, United States",968,1930,3483,4.0,14/12/2017,"I like the Oakridge location better because the layout feels more open but all the Cheesecake Factories are ultimately the same. I have always had a positive dining experience here. The wait here can be long despite this place being around for a while and despite all of the various dining options around this area. Favorites of mine are their chicken madeira, chicken marsala and pastas. The interior is dim and moody but loud/lively. It is good for a family dinner or date (but not a first date...since the volume in here is pretty loud and maybe it might be hard to converse). Their menu is huge and includes a long list of delicious cheesecake options. It is hard to come here without wanting dessert."
Felicia C.,"Menlo Park, United States",219,84,209,3.0,9/7/2017,"The interior of Cheesecake Factory is beautiful and very clean. It was also really crowded so I suggest coming here early. We came at 5:30 and our food was brought at 6:45. We waited about an hour for our food, but in the meantime, the waiter brought us some bread, wheat and sourdough. My friends and I ordered the jambalaya pasta, eggplant Parmesan, original cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. Jambalaya pasta- The pasta had a unique flavor to it. It's basically jambalaya mixed with pasta. There were some shrimp and chicken in the dish. The sauce was very yummy. I would order this again. Eggplant Parmesan- The fried eggplant was extremely oily. So oily to the point that I didn't want to finish the dish. The outside wasn't crispy anymore. But the cheese and the marinara sauce was really good. The eggplant also came with some pesto pasta which was even more oily. I don't think I would order this dish again. Onto dessert!!! Original cheesecake- YESSSS! This is what they're famous for. It was creamy and tasted sooo good. Probably one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted, so I would definitely order this again. Tiramisu cheesecake- I expected it to taste at least a little like cheesecake, but it didn't at all. The tiramisu flavor overpowered the cheesecake flavor, so basically it was just tiramisu. I would have liked some cheesecake flavors, and this disappointed me, so I don't think I would order this again. Overall my experience at Cheesecake Factory was ok. The service was really slow and some dishes I didn't really like. The next time I go here, I will order new dishes to try, and I hope the service is faster."
Shannon W.,"Cupertino, United States",1663,159,483,2.0,1/7/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Westfield Valley Fair in West San Jose, next to Macy's mens. We came on a Saturday for lunch at 1pm, and got seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was very nice! We got the crab cake appetizer ($13) and factory combo: herb crusted salmon and filet mignon with mashed potatoes ($22.50). The food came pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. However, I didn't have a great experience for the value. For a lunch costing a total of $45 for 2, with only one appetizer and one entree, it was VERY little food.  The crabcakes appetizer comes with THREE crabcakes, with like a 2 inch diameter, tiny!! The two sauces were great, but it's not proportional to the amount of crabcake they gave! Delicious, but really not worth it.  The salmon and filet mignon pieces were also extremely small. The salmon was like 2x4 inches, and not incredibly good. The filet mignon was 3 small, thin pieces.. They didn't skimp on the mashed potato though. Gave an awful lot of that. But that's not worth $23 is it.  Also, I really like the wheat grain bread at the Cheesecake chains. So the first waiter for 1 wheat grain and 1 sourdough bread, and my friend and I finished that. so we asked for some more wheat grain bread, and it took 25 minutes for that to come out. We finally got to eat some bread.. after we finished our meal. It also took a really long time to flag someone down and give us a check.  This place has the decor, good location, and fine food, but the portions are incredibly skimpish and the service is lacking. I would not come back again."
K K.,"San Jose, United States",7,106,20,1.0,2/10/2017,"An absolute joke today!!! Just a complete freaking joke. I can't believe this place is staying in business with what I have experienced today!!!  It's taken over 17minutes just to get to the person to actually try and place an order. This after Victoria from the front desk refused 3 times to help me! The. I was hung up on twice!!! I call back to get a manage and another 4 minutes of being on hold and surprise surprise Maria from the bakery answers ready to take my order. Hmm, but no manager. Whatever. Way too much aggravation for this garbage!!!  Do NOT come here. Do NOT order take out from here. You're just going to get the runaround and treated like crap. Jason was the manager that refused to come to the phone when I asked for one. Or perhaps just made excuses why it took so long. Just another 7minutes waste of my time."
Alison Y.,"Fremont, United States",502,74,316,2.0,14/6/2017,"The only time I think of coming to The Cheesecake Factory is if I'm going with a large group to celebrate something. They're great for accommodating big parties, so I'll give them that. But in terms of their food, I'd much rather eat elsewhere.  We got here a little before 6:00 PM on a Sunday (after a failed attempt to eat at Din Tai Fung, which had an estimated 2 hour wait time - yikes!!), and we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The first part of our dining experience went pretty smoothly. Getting our drinks, ordering, and receiving our appetizers (and their delicious complimentary bread) all happened in a timely manner.  APPETIZERS: The WARM CRAB & ARTICHOKE DIP was very flavorful and paired really with their crunchy grilled bread! This was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. The NASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN NUGGETS were pretty good as well and not that spicy thankfully.  MAIN COURSE: Everything that went wrong during this portion of the meal is why I'm only giving this restaurant 2 stars. Strike #1: My mom ordered a Filet Mignon, and they didn't bring her a steak knife. She had to flag down our server to ask for one, which took some time. Strike #2: My dad ordered an omelette, which was offered with a side of potatoes or tomatoes. He went with tomatoes, and when the dish was delivered, there were no tomatoes. He had to ask about it, and our server eventually brought it out for him after. Strike #3: My brother ordered the factory combination with Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. And there was a piece of plain cooked pasta in his dish when his order clearly had no pasta items. Seems like sloppy food service or poor quality control to me... And lastly, I ordered pasta with shrimp and sausage, which was just average.  DESSERT: How could you come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake? We went with a slice of the mango key lime, which was a great option if you're looking for a not-so-sweet option."

Gabriella T.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, United States",84,90,92,4.0,29/9/2017,"This Is just one of many chain Cheesecake Factory stores that I have been to and most of them are honestly 3 star levels for me but this one I give 4 to mostly for the service. Came in here during lunch of a Wednesday with two of my girlfriends and got seated right away. Our waitress was super friendly, but sadly I forgot to get her name. My friends and I weren't too hungry so we just shared their Wild mushroom soup, fried Mac n cheese balls, and their four cheese pasta. I told her I really like their wild mushroom soup ( which they only served on Wednesdays) and she was so nice to give me a free small one to-go when I left ! I was surprised at the nice gesture. +1 star for that.  The rest of the food was decent but the thing that made it ok was the price, everything at cheesecake it a little bit higher priced than I would've liked. Oh and don't forget about the complimentary wheat bread (or brown bread some people say), I always ask for extra of that stuff !  Overall decent food, prices are higher, but I got a really great server this time !"
Cathleen F.,"Sunnyvale, United States",23,16,5,1.0,27/12/2017,"For horrendous service, this restaurant takes the (cheese)cake. If zero stars was an option, that would have been a no-brainer. 1. Very short staffed. Everything took a very, very long time. 2. Two out of four of our bread plates were visibly dirty. 3. They were out of fish for their Fish 'n' Chips (my husband doesn't eat meat, so that matters to us). 4. My pasta dish was terrible. 5. The customer service was horrible. My husband and I arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night, the day after Christmas, with our two year old and four year old, for a nice anniversary dinner. Our main mission was cheesecake, but we decided to have some dinner first. It was crowded but the wait was only about twenty minutes, so that was reasonable to us. We were seated at our table and after five minutes or so, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she came a while later, we mentioned that our plates were dirty and asked if she could bring new ones when she brought the bread. I heard her mention to our neighboring table that they were out of bread and that they were making more, so I knew it would be a while (and it was). But when she came to bring the bread a while later, no new plates. Waited a while for new plates. We knew what we wanted but waited quite some time, again, for the waitress to come take our orders. Then we went to place said order only to find out they were out of fish. We picked a replacement item fairly quickly but it still took a very long time to get the food. When the food arrived, my husband's eggplant parmesan was great, but my dish (Shrimp with Angel Hair with the basil garlic lemon cream sauce from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish) was terrible. It was watery, flavor-less, and seemed to be missing any trace of salt (I never thought I'd say this of a big chain restaurant, where salt is never in short supply). It looked somewhat creamy, but very, very watery. I tried salting it a couple times and mentioned it to the waitress so she brought some parmesan. That didn't make a big difference so she offered to bring some alfredo sauce. That kind of helped, but by that point it had been a long time and I had just sort of given up hope. My kids were eating the plain pasta (as most kids would), and I ate what I could so as not to be wasteful. Even without kids (who were being so well behaved and patient), I would not have wanted to extend my stay at that restaurant any longer by ordering something else or having it re-made. Not that that was even offered.  After experiencing the super slow service, dirty plates, and dissatisfying food, we thought it prudent to try to resolve it with a manager. We explained the issues to him, were very friendly, understanding and empathetic, and he seemed personable and apologetic. After listening and explaining that they were very short staffed, apologizing for the pasta dish not turning out very well, he offered a cheesecake as a resolution. In my head, I was thinking a whole cheesecake is pretty expensive and probably more than we need, but maybe they have small ones. And even then, if my pasta dish was $20 and a cheesecake is maybe $50, cost of food + bad experience = not that excessive in terms of compensation. So our waitress asks what kind of cheesecake we'd like, we tell her we'd like the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, but to go (2 year old was starting to fall asleep at the table, can't blame him). When she comes with our to-go bag, there's one small slice of cheesecake in it. My husband and I look at each other like, um, is this happening right now? Is this worth fighting over? We ask the waitress for clarification, she explains yes, the one slice is intentional. She goes on to explain that when things go wrong, that's their go-to solution, one slice of cheesecake, and implies that the real problem is that I still ate my plate of pasta. I caught the manager again on our way out and he mansplained about their customer service, laughed at the idea of a whole cheesecake, and again faulted me for eating the dish.

The whole point of ordering door dash was so that I did not have to do that because I was sick in bed. The burger was cold. Not warm, no room temperature but cold. After I go get my son food. I come home. Warm up the flat bread and burger. Eat those two items and within two hours I was in the bathroom throwing up. ALL NIGHT! I don't know what was going on yesterday but my experience was terrible. Three emails to doordash and no response BUT Doordash didn't prepare the food. CHEESECAKE FACTORY DID  Update: as you can see Cheesecake Factory responded with a generic response below. Doordash was late delivering the food. However, Cheesecake Factory is the one that prepared the food incorrectly. It would be nice if someone took responsibility here. $53.00 wasted."
Melissa P.,"Arcadia, United States",118,5,,2.0,10/1/2018,"""Curbside"" was a train wreck this past visit.  I arrived the 20 minutes recommended after ordering only to find no one was picking up either the posted curbside number or regular restaurant number.  I waited 10 minutes and even though my baby was sleeping I got out her car seat and went in to pick up my ""curbside"" order.  I continued to wait in line for 10 minutes before ever getting to speak with someone only to find my order was STILL not ready for ""a few minutes""...  whatever that meant.  It was only ONE ITEM.  Many people looked perturbed like they were also unhappy and waiting for a long time.  The employees looked stressed and scrambling around as if they'd been the weeds for awhile.  I waited for 10 more minutes then asked to cancel my order and left empty handed.  What a horrible horrible experience.  The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because when I have time to dine in the food is always great and the servers are always nice.  Lesson learned...  DO NOT ORDER CURBSIDE SERVICE, YOU MAY JUST STARVE."
Mark P.,"San Jose, United States",8,109,73,4.0,21/8/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory I love there meatloaf lunch special and the well mannered dirty kettle one martini. Latisha made a really good martini at the bar if she's there I definitely recommend the well mannered dirty kettle one martini.  Always have a good time at Cheesecake. They even have a good brunch.
