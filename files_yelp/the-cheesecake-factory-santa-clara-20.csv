Irene G.,"King City, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Worst service ever, was seated super fast but once seated waited about 20 minutes before our waitress took our drink orders. After bringing drinks she took our food order, we waited 45 minutes for our food, everyone got their order except me, I patiently waited some more thinking I'm sure my food is on it's way, after everyone at my party almost finished eating my husband stopped a waiter that was walking by to ask him to get our waitress, she finally comes to our table and tells me she's going to check, about 5 minutes later she brings me the plate of the Louisiana chicken, the plate was super hot and the pasta was so hard from sitting under the heating lamp.  At that point I told her I didn't want it any longer... it's too bad that bad service ruined our meal. Should have walked across the street to the yard house."
Connie H.,"Castro Valley, CA",21,39,223,4.0,7/3/2016,"4.5 STARS My friend and I came on Wednesday at around 4pm for a late lunch/ early dinner. No wait! The hostess seated us right away. Our waitress took awhile to ask for our drinks and bring our bread, but nothing big.  Food; Bread- cold but hey! It's free, so no complaints lol Mac and cheese balls appetizer- AMAZINGGGG! 10/10 must get! Chipotle chicken pasta? (Don't remember the name)- 7/10 just because I'm not much of a pasta person but the sauce was good and generous portion for lunch price Service; Friendly and fast service!"
Gennee M.,"Mission District, San Francisco, CA",45,3,,1.0,10/30/2017,"It's my birthday we are here at Cheesecake Factory we check in our table at 130 pm still waiting for our food it's 2:20pm almost an hour server is missing so hungry we came from San Francisco the rest of the tables had their order except ours, still waiting no food hungry we want to get our check but no one even dare check on us."
Ranice L.,"Cupertino, CA",371,145,274,4.0,6/13/2016,"This is my mom's favorite restaurant! Pros: the free bread, large menu, nice location and atmosphere, and the food. All the dishes have large portions. I would recommend the fried calamari and gumbo; these dishes are usually my go-to. The garlic noodles with shrimp is also great. And you definitely should try a special cheesecake! I usually don't eat cheesecake, but it's a must-try at the CHEESECAKE factory. I'd recommend the mango key lime or the tiramisu.  Cons: the wait. Sometimes, there's so many people, so service is really slow. So if you're in a rush then I wouldn't recommend coming here!"
Sammy N.,"Saratoga, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/13/2017,"My friend ordered a tomato basil pasta other no chicken, but they still put chicken on it. When they asked me if I wanted chicken, but they didn't clarify that it was extra chicken. They charged my friend an extra $4. Also, it was my friend's birthday and they offered us cheesecake, but they didn't tell us that they were going to charge us."
Kimanne B.,"San Jose, CA",61,127,712,1.0,10/15/2015,Order: Medallion Steak on their new Skinny Menu.  Service: slow and waited for an hour to sit down.  Ask for well-done steak and it came out bloody red! Return the plate without taking a single bite. The manager at the time made a rude face and didn't even apologize. He took off the plate from the bill and charge for one soda. Definitely Avoid!
Jonathan T.,"Cupertino, CA",397,403,410,4.0,5/22/2015,"Woot cheesecake factory! Your go to entry level fancy chain restaurant. Perfect for when you want to go for a nice dinner on a budget.  This location does not take reservations, at least it didn't when I tried to make one on the Saturday of Mother's Day. The wait is long, and they don't tell you accurate wait times. If the wait is actually an hour, they'll tell you half an hour. Just watch out for that and be prepared to wait longer than what you expect.  They give you a buzzer that alerts you at limited range so go shop around Valley Fair and come back when it's almost your turn to be called.  Excellent Service - Friendly, attentive, and polite waitstaff.  Portobello Mushroom, Avocado, Zuchini small plate - These are all deep fried and served with this chipotle style cream based sauce. It's delicious.  It came out very crispy and with a lot of batter, more than I prefer for my taste but that's what makes it come out crunchy. The portion is just enough for a party of 4 to each try a mushroom, avocado, and zucchini piece.  Vietnamese summer shrimp spring roll - Sweet and fragrant. This is not your typical Vietnamese springroll! The ingredients are not your typical bean sprouts and basal. They're stuffed with thick plump shrimp and various veggies that have been pickled and/or marinated. The flavors work very well together. It comes with 2 types of sauces! One is the typical peanut based dipping sauce, and other is a sweeter, teriyaki style sauce.  We chose to order these apps because everything else on the menu was a lot of fried/creamy/fatty stuff. Yes the mushroom/avocado/zucchini platter was fried, but at least there's some veggie based foods in there. I guess this just shows how limited your options are when you're going for something 'healthier'. Hibachi steak - the steak was delicious, as expected. You can't really go wrong with steak aside from not seasoning it properly and not getting the right cook on it. It came out to a good medium well, and was still moist and juicy on the inside. This dish was served with garlic red mashed potatoes with a hint of wasabi over the top! Soo good.  Turkey burger - I ordered this with sweet potato fries. As with all turkey burgers, the meat patty is gonna come out dry, nothing you can really do about it, and that's kinda the point of ordering a less fattening/healthier burger. The turkey was still seasoned well. I've had a lot better burgers elsewhere so it would be fair for me to say I'm disappointed in their burgers.  You cannot leave cheesecake factory without ordering their cheesecake! 30th anniversary cheesecake - It's basically a mix of chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious. Thick, rich, creamy, and it just melts in your mouth. The cake portions are soft and moist, and complements the cream cheese area of the cake. You'd expect each slice to come out to over $10, but it's really more like $7-8 per slice. One slice is a good portion to share between 2 or even 3 people."
Annie N.,"Fremont, CA",30,30,25,3.0,7/1/2017,My bf and I dined here around 2/3 pm on a Friday. It wasn't that busy and we had a 10/15 wait before we were seated. That was fine. Food was good aside from the fact our order got mixed up in the takeout line and we pushed back. We ended up waiting for like 40 minutes for our food even though our server kept saying it'll be just a few minutes. I'd say it's one of my pet peeves when people over promise and under deliver so I was annoyed. I've never had an experience like this at any Cheesecake Factory and I like the food there so hopefully it was just one incident.
Seneca K.,"San Jose, CA",283,33,9,5.0,6/16/2017,"Cheesecake never disappoints and I'm so happy with the service I got tonight! Something happened with our order so my bfs dish came out but we still didn't receive the appetizer or my dish. We decided to cancel the appetizer which wasn't a problem. I had a number of waiters probably like 3 total apologizing for the mishap which I totally appreciate. I don't remember their names(wish I did!) but I do remember that the manager, Samantha, came to apologize as well. Got a free cheesecake on the house! Even though we had to wait a little longer, the service was great tonight and everyone made me feel cared for. Thanks to everyone that checked up on me and helped serve us!"
Kim N.,"San Jose, CA",63,268,100,5.0,5/26/2016,"To be honest, usually, I'm never quite impressed by The Cheesecake Factory. But when I came in yesterday for lunch, I was shocked to find that I had an absolutely wonderful afternoon!~  Came to grab a quick bite with my friend, Niko, and we ended up staying and chatting over good food for nearly two hours. The ambiance is nice - it's almost like a maze. I almost ended up in the kitchen like three times.. haha. But the ambiance IS enlightening! I ordered the Da Vinci Pasta, and wowzahs! The flavors were bouncing all over! It was quite the delicious meal!~ I would definitely order it again. I'm actually craving for it right now as I type.  The experience was great yesterday, and IT WAS ALL THANKS TO OUR SERVER CATHY. Thank youuu Cathy!!! Hope to have you as our server again next time too!~ The way she grated the cheese was absolutely majestic, and her customer service skills were off the charts. I felt so engaged with the restaurant having her as our server."
Hillary A.,"Santa Clara, CA",60,5,4,5.0,8/3/2017,"My fiance and I had lunch here on 8/3, we had gotten here about a half an hour after they opened, so right before lunch rush. We had to wait less than 5 minutes for a table. Once we got to the table our server Dani was a breath of fresh air, she was super friendly, super understanding, very patient as my fiance looked through their menu. She was super quick getting our drinks, refills, and everything else we wanted. The food took a little while to get out, but that didn't bother my fiance or I because the food was hot, delicious and very flavorful. The way Dani took care of us we felt like she genuinely cared about us. We will definitely go back and hopefully we get to sit in Dani's section again."
James A.,"Central San Jose, San Jose, CA",99,1,,5.0,8/3/2017,"Me and my fianceè had lunch on Thursday August third and our sever Dani was absolutely amazing. She greeted us with a huge smile on her face and a very warm greeting. It made us feel like family. Our food took a bit but when it came out it was very warm and delicious. Overall experience was amazing, definitely coming here again."
Ashlee B.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/2/2017,"Our waiter had verry poor customer service. We waited over an hour for our apatizers. (fried macaroni and cheese balls)   That is ridiculous. verry upset with our experience. separating the staff from food quality, food is excellent.  *personal note*, strongly do NOT recommend getting cheesecake on National Cheesecake Day from there.  you will receive warm almost melty like cake, due to high demand -thank you for reading my comment  I hope your day is better"
Cagdas U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,1,,1.0,8/2/2017,"No more kale and quinoa salad, we ordered but he said no more sorry, we will change the menu :("
Steven D.,"Beaumont, CA",61,3,,1.0,4/28/2017,Worst experience now two times in a row. Waited 45 minutes to bring out our food. Manager came over seemed very insincere  and blamed it on what we ordered.  Waitress avoided our table after we complained and brought out food which looked like it was sitting for some time. They didn't comp anything on the check oh and we had to pay for valet to even eat at this place.
Tru B.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/14/2017,"7 years later- Thank you for your idiocy! It has gotten me out of ever having to set foot in this over hyped, half baked establishment again."
Christina T.,"San Jose, CA",6,65,135,3.0,12/24/2016,I was better than I expected. I got the eggplant parmesan and shared a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  The eggplant came with a side of pesto pasta. I love pesto pasta but felt like they kind of skimped out on some pesto. You can barely taste it. Wasn't really a fan of the cheesecake. There were too many flavors fighting each other. I would have preferred the original instead.
Alix J.,"San Francisco, CA",107,183,30,4.0,11/12/2016,"I enjoy the cheesecake factory because of the drinks and the huge portions that they serve I have come here for birthday celebrations and other special occasions. I like that the menu is expansive and that you can do the skinny cocktails like a margarita and mojotio.  Also skinny food menu items.  It can be a long wait, but other times it is not bad depending on whether you want to sit outside or inside.  I been here like a dozen times it is somewhat overpriced depending what you order. I usuaully order a pasta dish, I usually have leftovers because the portions are huge and can not finish it!"
Ariana B.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,15,,2.0,5/2/2017,"Only giving two stars because my food was disgusting. I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was extremely oily, to the point that I lost my appetite. It was my first time going to the cheesecake factory and I was NOT impressed with the food.  The cheesecake was great though."
Eric S.,"San Jose, CA",1,19,5,5.0,4/16/2017,usually never fails us. we came late this time. about 1130pm. we got sat right away.  our server was edna. her 2nd day and she was perfect! so nice and tentative. thank you edna! we had a great meal and time.
