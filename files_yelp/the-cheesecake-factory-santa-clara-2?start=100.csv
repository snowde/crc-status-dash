Nikki R.,"Cupertino, CA",55,9,8,4.0,11/20/2017,It's pretty decent and has a lot of options. There is also desert other than cheesecake that is good.
Vivienne C.,"Fremont, CA",154,122,171,4.0,7/11/2017,"I mean it's Cheesecake Factory. It has a standard haha. I came with a huge group around 5:30 on a Saturday night with a reservation and we still got seated awhile later. The food service was pretty slow around 45 minutes, but it's great for social events. The food is okay, but here are some of the food we ordered. 1. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The pasta was pretty good, with a mixture of green (basil?) noodles and orange (tomato?) noodles. I was kind of disappointed that the only meat there was, was chicken and shrimp, which does not make it a jambalaya. Strong Cajun flavor, but literally there was no sauce. Kind of disappointed. 2. Eggplant Parmesan - The eggplant was so oily. After we finished eating 2 (out of 3), the whole plate was drenched. The top is very crispy, not a lot of Parmesan flavor, but the bottom was so oily, it was low-key disgusting. The pesto pasta was really good though.  3. Miso Salmon - DAMN this is actually really good. I love the outer crust flavor, a little bit sweet with Asian flair. Also the rice really matches the dish, because it's so easy to eat. Honestly they do Asian pretty good haha. 4. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Okay, I now understand the hype of this dish. It is actually pretty good because how many different kinds of ingredients there were in it. However, I feel like it was extremely salty, with the olives and the artichokes, the salt content was just too high. 5. Original Cheescake - Creamiest cheescake ever. It actually tasted pretty good, super silky and mesmerizing. I kind of forgot how it taste because yes, it's good, but it's not extremely memorable. 6. Tiramisu Cheesecake - This actually tastes like a tiramisu + cheescake combined. I don't know if this is the best combination, because coffee and cheese is kind of questionable together. Nevertheless, it is still really good. Overall, 3 for the food, but +1 for the bread. Okay the sourdough isn't really a sourdough, but the wheat bread was actually super delicious. I can totally eat that for the rest of my life."
Cynthia H.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,19,14,1.0,2/27/2017,Don't door dash cheesecake factory. Half your food will be missing and the quality is poor. They sent burnt fries and a raw a** burger. They also didn't pack my cheesecake....ITS CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! HOW U FORGET THE CHEESECAKE WHEN ITS IN THE NAME???!!! UGH!!! Update: in response their reply...DOOR DASH DIDNT BURN MY FRIES !!!!
Emily L.,"Santa Clara, CA",84,244,266,4.0,3/18/2017,"No fights during Cheesecake this visit! The progression of the meal: 1. Bread - The table bread is something I could've done without. It's on the house but nothing too special so I wouldn't fill up on it. 2. Firecracker Salmon - Kind of a cool twist on firecracker shrimp. It's a long, skinny piece of salmon wrapped in a thin won ton wrapper. Only the sauce has some hint of ""spice"" in the most literal sense of the word, so you don't have to be worried about any explosions. There's a refreshing red cabbage slaw that's tossed lightly with some light dressing on the side. It was a tasty dish and a nice change from any old spring roll. 3. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - This was on the menu at a whopping 2100 calories. Fried shrimp, garlic cream sauce...mmm it was worth every single calorie. It's an enormous portion which is what must account for part of its delicious unhealthiness. 4. Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake - I swear they make you wait for your table so you have to ogle all the cheesecakes in all their glory in the front. There's no way you can say no to dessert after looking in the display case. If you enjoy Ferrero Rochers, you would love this cheesecake. The Nutella is a nice addition but even just the cheesecake is great. Note that this location is on the Winchester side of the mall. It's also not accessible from inside the mall so you do have to exit through Macy's to get to it."
Michelle C.,"San Diego, CA",101,332,770,5.0,3/14/2017,"This was my favorite meal so far in my short visit up to the San Jose area! Haha! The server here was sweet and helpful as usual. We ordered the shrimp and sausage with Alfredo sauce (it usually comes in their marinara sauce), they used some hot chili peppers which gives the Alfredo sauce a special kick! Also got the Chipotle chicken pasta! Both were on their lunch specials menu! Then we got two slices of cheese to go, the hazelnut and carrot cake cheesecake! Very happy and food was yummy!"
Lorianne L.,"San Jose, CA",184,496,4524,4.0,8/24/2016,"It's been 3 years since my last visit to The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair. Surprisingly, my friend and I had no problem getting a table to celebrate her birthday. When we left, the place was packed, but we just beat the dinner crowd at 5:45. Marie and CJ (training) were our servers. Everything was fine, but nothing was outstanding. The birthday girl had Thai Lettuce Wraps and I had the Chicken Madeira & Shrimp Scampi combo. It was strange; the shrimp seemed like they were coated and fried. I don't remember them being cooked like that before. I don't think I'll be getting that again.  We ordered cheesecake to go so we could share with my friend's family at home. We took a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. To help celebrate, Marie & CJ sang for my friend and gave her a celebratory mini-sundae. Thanks Cheesecake Factory."
Robbin M.,"Santa Maria, CA",85,305,332,3.0,2/18/2017,"Our waiter Ramon, was absolutely attentive and amazing ( up until he took a break). If I could separately give him 5 stars for service I would. Unfortunately the rest of our experience here was not the same. Although we were warned that appetizers were going to take a while we waited well over 45 min. When they finally arrived our food came shortly thereafter it was ice cold. Also service from Ramon's replacement Kayla was impersonal and short. Bathrooms were a mess. I know this is a busy place but with all the money it racks in you should be able to hire some one to keep up. I'm embarrassed for you."
Marky M.,"Monterey, CA",5,27,18,1.0,7/10/2017,"OMG! Beware with your seats! They DO NOT maintain their place. Brought my cousin here because they love cheesecake. But then, before we even sit... There are small cockroaches on the seat!!  I'm updating my review. Because we were compensated by the manager. But our server was not informed. LOL? I guess she wasn't firmed about the compensation. Ordered 2 shared cheesecakes, 4 cold drinks and 1 Jamabalaya pasta. Thanks anyway.  To be fair on my review. There was a construction beside them. And that might be the caused. But still not an excuse for a restaurant. Specially we are talking about FOOD. It's everyone's health and hygiene we are talking about. And it goes to every customers coming in. Specially I have brought guests and my wife is pregnant. I have the photo & video but no need to UL."
Florence A.,"San Jose, CA",2,84,23,3.0,7/15/2017,"The cheesecake is the best thing about this place. The menu is way too big, and the regular food is just okay.  The wait for a table can be very long, depending on the time you go. I don't think it's worth it to wait  long for the food here. The cheesecake, you can buy at a counter near the door and take it to go."
Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134,2.0,2/17/2017,"Sooo probably not the best place to go on a holiday... Even before arriving here, the parking lot was packed, and the construction makes it really confusing as to where there may be open spots (unless you want to pay for valet). Some family friends and I went to this spot for dinner for four on a Tuesday evening, and the wait was quite long. Apparently they'll only take reservations if your party is over a certain number. After 40-ish minutes, we were seated. I stayed rather basic and got the most popular Chicken Madeira, while those around me ordered Bang Bang Thai Dish, jambalaya, and a mango salad. Forty five minutes in, our server told us that someone had dropped the Bang Bang, so they're scurrying to make another one. The other dishes came first, and they were of decent proportion, and my chicken madeira was better than I've had before (usually it's rather dry). The jambalaya looked like it had been sitting out a bit because the noodles were stuck together. The mango salad was huge and delicious though. The Bang Bang they to-go'ed for us since we opted for cheesecake - nutella hazelnut and red velvet. Honestly, I think the cakes are a bit overpriced and overly sweet. I typically go for a little bit lighter on the sweets but keep the richness of the cheese. By the time we got out, we had spent 3 hours in that restaurant despite the kind waiter letting us know how crazy it was and apologizing profusely for everything (we did end up getting one of the cheesecakes for free). As we were leaving, still a ridiculous line with people looking tired for having waited... Overall, given the time we spent and average taste for food, I'd probably only go here if I was invited again, but not voluntarily."
Sarina J.,"San Jose, CA",803,377,3738,2.0,12/12/2016,"This place has really gone downhill. My salad was served with a bunch of black and rotten leaves and the coffee that was served first thing in the morning was lukewarm. Yeah on a good day this place might satisfy my sweet tooth but after this experience, not sure if I want to go back. Shame on me for getting a salad I guess?"
Cassandra B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/8/2017,"I just waited 3 hours for these guys to fill a Doordash order. The manager was rude to the dasher and did absolutely nothing to help her out. If they are too busy to handle Doordash orders, then they need to not participate. In other instances, they've screwed up orders and left the food cold. Never stepping foot in their restaurant or ordering from them again."
Evan S.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/21/2017,"I don't Yelp often, but I feel like good service is often underrated and goes unacknowledged. I really hope I get this guys name right.. Gilbert who was serving us, covering another servers lunch, @ the high top section, supposedly he's also a bartender.  He's extremely welcoming, friendly, and overall just an incredible server accommodating my friends and I high requests of extra sauces, dressings, bread refills, drink refills. He was on his game. And well, I know my friends and I were highly appreciative of all of his work. So if management is reading this, recognize this guy, and be sure to keep him around."
Renee R.,"Concord, CA",319,5,,1.0,8/24/2017,"WORST branch of Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. We got here at around or before 8pm, yet we ARE STILL waiting for our food. They try to buy some time by asking if it's ""ok to just start bringing out the dishes that are ready"". BS, it's been 45 mins since we've placed our order and they JUST brought out a ""chicken tenders"" meal that we ordered (they brought out chicken sliders? Wtf) This is the WORST dining experience I've ever had. Not to mention their bathrooms are trashy as hell. Hella paper towels on the floor and no toilet paper whatsoever.  Save your time and money. I'd rather eat a lunchables."
Sara M.,"San Jose, CA",201,7,4,2.0,9/1/2017,"This restaurant used to be a favorite but it definitely isn't anymore. I recently went here for a friends birthday and we went on a weekday so it was not crowded. It took about 10 minutes for us to be seated.  When we sat we ordered water and got bread, but it took a long time for that to come out. The place was also fairly cold, which I thought was weird.  We finally ordered, and our food took 45 minutes to come out. We were anticipating our food, and kept looking around for our waitress, only to see that people sitting around us that had arrived later on got their food before we did. Our waitress passed by and I asked if she could check on our food. Right after she left she came back with our food.  Everything was good, but it definitely was not worth the wait. We asked for boxes once we were full, and that also took about 20 minutes for our waitress to bring out. We wanted to leave and go to the mall after, so we asked another waiter to give us boxes. Overall, super slow service and definitely nit worth the wait. The food is good but for the amount of time we waited for it, we could have easily gone somewhere else better."
Allie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",522,327,658,5.0,5/30/2016,"Cheesecake factory is my favorite franchise restaurant!! Quick service, consistent food, huge portions, friendly staff, and has a beautiful ambiance. When I come to Cheesecake Factory, I never care how much I eat and i never watch my calorie intake when I dine here because i know everything is going to be so good!! Food - (my favorites) -   The complimentary sourdough and honeywheat bread is always good. I love the honeywheat bread but I always make sure not to eat too much so I have room for my meal and dessert. Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta: My favorite pasta dish!! The sauce is amazing with the kick of spicyness. Govida chocolate cake - Make with no flour!! It is not too bitter and not overly sweet. Service - Despite how popular Cheesecake factory is and the long line of people waiting for their table, I am surprised that the wait for a party of 2-4 is usually less than a 30 minute wait. Even if it was 1 hour long, I might still be willing to wait for a table. Staff is always friendly and makes sure you are satifsifed with your meal. I came to this locations serveral times. Food and service is very consistent. One time, a waiter accidentally dropped a lady's dish and scared everyone around with a loud bang. He took is very professionally and gave her a new dish that came out 5 mins later and offered her sparkling water/soda to calm her down. Overall, I will always come back whenever I have a chance to expect great food and service. The dinner portions are always 2-3 meals for me and make sure toake room for dessert!!"
Rohit C.,"Milpitas, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/3/2017,"This is the worst place to order for pickup.  They have no idea how long food should take to prepare.  We were given an estimate of 90 minutes, but they took almost 2 hours!!!  Needless to say this is the last time I am ordering food from them."
Joe T.,"Honolulu, HI",120,16,13,2.0,7/15/2017,"The bar service was fantastic, but once we got to the table it was pretty bad. Sat around for over forty five minutes waiting for out entrees. We were a party of six, not that big. I've been in the service industry for over 23 years now, and I know a table of 6 isn't overwhelming.  We didn't even know who our server was. We would just try to get help from whomever walked by. A couple of servers came by to say they were helping our server because she was busy.  When she came by, she was very temperamental and short with us. She never bothered to even check on us, nor did she even introduce herself. None of us will come to this Cheesecake Factory again. So after an hour, we got 4 out of 6 of our entrees. We asked for cilantro on the side of one dish, and when it came with cilantro we were too that was a lot of modifiers.  Worst dining experience in years."
Atul S.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,3.0,11/20/2017,"they don't care about customers. I order on phone they gave me 25 min, but I was waited an hour and half, when i ask the guy at front desk was told me "" we are so busy at this moment"". ok I can understand if, you are busy then tell ur customers to come in hour to pickup their orders."
Yellow Boy A.,"Mountain View, CA",10,185,1129,4.0,5/27/2017,I always enjoy going to this restaurant. Mega size food portions and very wide range of choices. So good!!!

I've been in the service industry for over 23 years now, and I know a table of 6 isn't overwhelming.  We didn't even know who our server was. We would just try to get help from whomever walked by. A couple of servers came by to say they were helping our server because she was busy.  When she came by, she was very temperamental and short with us. She never bothered to even check on us, nor did she even introduce herself. None of us will come to this Cheesecake Factory again. So after an hour, we got 4 out of 6 of our entrees. We asked for cilantro on the side of one dish, and when it came with cilantro we were too that was a lot of modifiers.  Worst dining experience in years."
Atul S.,"Fremont, United States",0,3,,3.0,20/11/2017,"they don't care about customers. I order on phone they gave me 25 min, but I was waited an hour and half, when i ask the guy at front desk was told me "" we are so busy at this moment"". ok I can understand if, you are busy then tell ur customers to come in hour to pickup their orders."
