Dano G.,"Milpitas, United States",160,468,88,3.0,12/10/2010,"A factory that makes cheesecakes? A bustling warehouse, with smokestacks, spewing the smell of cheesecakes being manufactured. Only special people are granted access within. The tours are daily, with tour guides in lab coats, hard hats, and safety goggles. Visitors are given hairnets and face masks. Everywhere is a conveyor belt, showcasing every machines special operation into making each cheesecake. Factory Employees, or Cheesecake Experts, surveying the area, and ensuring quality. Most of the industrialized factory is a consortium of robotics. And at the end of the tour, a conveyor belt with your special made-to-order cheesecake. Nope. This wasn't a Factory. It was just a restaurant."
Alan M.,"Silicon Valley, United States",449,369,7,4.0,27/10/2012,"I didn't really plan to come here, but with a gift card the price was hard to beat.  After a long enough wait to make you start pondering things like what an actual factory that produced cheesecakes might look like, we were seated.  Our orders were taking a long time to come out of the kitchen, so the server eventually let us order a couple free salads (that happened to arrive at the same time as the food... but at least an effort was made).  Food was better than I was expecting though, so overall it was a good experience despite the wait (and the fact that it is a chain restaurant)."
Jaime O.,"Milpitas, United States",94,715,2,4.0,25/8/2013,"the wait was horrific.  The service was slooooow.  The food pleased us much.  Pasta Carbonara and that white bean chili.  I've yet to eat the cheesecake, always too full!"
Katherine L.,"San Jose, United States",99,150,112,4.0,13/7/2011,"Big portions and all around good food, there's really nothing to complain about. The service is friendly, and the wait isn't terribly long.  What I love most here ? The brown bread you get to eat with butter before your meal comes out. Warm with butter..mm. The variety is great, such a vast menu of both entrees and desserts."
Jonathan J.,"Cupertino, United States",5,100,367,4.0,10/11/2013,"went again (to the San Jose location) and it was as good as ever. This time, though, we came for brunch (for the first time) and were completely blown away by the belgian waffles (Elvis style) and the banana cream cheesecake. Simply amazing. We also ordered a salmon platter. I love bagels w/cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and whatnot, but I've never had them with smoked salmon. It was disappointing... I don't know what to say besides that I didn't dislike it, but I didn't like it either. Anyway, besides that, it was a nice experience. Also, just reiterating here, but the prices can seem a bit higher than average, but the portions are enormous, so the prices really aren't bad."
Pierre T.,"San Jose, United States",27,9,,5.0,16/2/2012,"I came here for a birthday party for my ex-girlfriend. The only reason I'm posting here is because the person who served me was really really good, and met all my standards of customer service. Her name is Liz, and she was great! She came around and checked my table plenty of wonderful times. The way she communicated with us made us feel welcomed, like as if we belonged there! She was really nice and was very friendly, I could tell by the way she smiles. Did you forget I came here for a birthday celebration? So I told Liz it was a my ex girlfriend's birthday. She acknowledged it. So I ate a nice Filet Mignon steak, my ex gf had a steak, and my brother had pasta. We were finished eating soon, and Liz came out with a few other workers, holding a birthday sundae surprise for my ex gf! I honestly had no idea that the surprise would happen, heck, I was surprised myself. Anyways, I just wanted to report that her customer service was really really good and I appreciate the things she did for us. Aside from that, the food was great. The Filet Mignon was a little small... even though I ordered a LARGE one.... but it's okay. It was still good. I had no complaints from anyone else either, so, I'll say this is a really positive experience."
Amy L.,"San Jose, United States",182,88,60,4.0,10/7/2011,"I came here for a late night snack on a Friday night around 10:00.  We decided to sit by the bar.  We had two people and we literally just ordered two mini appetizers (no drinks, we were both drivers that night.)   We took the first two seats that were available at the bar.  The bartender that night was FANTASTIC! Despite only ordering two small dishes, he was very attentive and nice!!  I had the Ahi Tuna Tartare and it was pretty good! A little too much avocado for my preference, but good nonetheless."
April C.,"San Jose, United States",25,4,,1.0,22/2/2015,"We are a party of 12. Our host who organized the party came in at 5 pm to secure a table for a 6:30 dinner seating because they do not take reservations on the weekend. She was told that if some came in at least 45 minutes ahead of time it should okay. It's 7:17 and we have yet to be seated. The manager is not really taking responsibility. Never coming back, their food isn't that good anyway."
Jake N.,"San Jose, United States",6,23,,2.0,14/3/2014,I'm a keep this review simple. The food is okay the service is a hit n miss the prices for what you get EH. This place is just ok.
Eugene T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",35,10,,4.0,23/12/2011,"The food here is consistent and shockingly good for a chain.  Ya don't get 4 stars because if you get there at the wrong time. You will be waiting for a long ass time to get a table. Specials vary. And I've partaken of the following and they are recommended - Avocado Egg Rolls - Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll - Roadside Sliders - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad - Meatloaf - Ranch house Burger. They don';t have this anymore. another reason for 3 stars - Grilled shrimp, bacon, lettuce and tomato club.  - Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - Pineapple upside down cheese cake. - Classic Mojito Oh yeah, every tuesday. They have a bitching Mushroom soup. Hmm.. I was a dumbass once (once hah!), got drunk and left my camera there. The cleaning staff turned it in and I was able to de-dumbassify  myself the next day.  Fine 4 stars..."
Roderick S.,"Milpitas, United States",23,69,12,5.0,3/6/2013,Have you ever had a Monte Cristo sandwich?!!! Well I hadn't until yesterday. Went here for Sunday Brunch with the girlfriend and some pals for the first time. I decided to try something new and our waiter suggested the Monte Cristo. Good thing it was my cheat day because this thing is not for the calorie conscious at all. Thick French Toast. Bacon. Ham. Eggs. All in a beautiful sandwich form. I almost couldn't finish it all but my table coached me through it and I wiped the plate clean. Can't wait to go back and do it again next Sunday :) Excellent service as always. Not to crowded for a Sunday around noon. We were seated within 5 minutes. Love this place
James A.,"Fremont, United States",125,182,26,5.0,27/10/2011,I haven't been at Cheesecake Factory for years.  It was my wife's B-Day and we wanted to celebrate it by eating some Avocado Eggrolls. The food was as good as before and my server was extremely courteous and caring if we are having a good time. It was memorable family dinner and we will be back very soon. P.S. Steak was surprisingly delicious.
Lorrie M.,"San Jose, United States",3761,2986,262,3.0,10/11/2008,"I like Cheesecake factory because it is probably one of the best chained type restaurants out of all the other similar restaurants like Elephant Bar and BJ's. Their food and the quality of food is consistent everywhere and they have great bread starters. I love their appetizers and their skirt steak is to die for. They also have especially good chicken dishes because their chicken is always very well cooked and tender so its great on any dish. Their cheese cakes I can't comment on since I'm not a huge dessert fan, but they do give out huge slices and one of my favorites I've tried is the fresh banana cream cheese cake."
Christella T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",132,58,5,4.0,19/6/2011,"I arrived here tonight (Saturday) at 9:15pm to ask for a table for 6...was told there would be a 50-minute wait.  Bummer!  But we made the most of it, chit-chatting to pass the time.  The wait turned out to be 35 min only...woo hoo. It took 20 minutes for us to skim through the entire menu, which is a book!  Lots of variety, from small plates, to breakfast served all day, to pastas, pizza, etc.  They have a ""weight management"" section, but I've ordered from it before and immediately regretted it...the flavors just weren't there.  Besides, who wants to order a ""weight management"" chicken salad??  They also have a menu that provides all the calorie-counts...which are surprisingly high for most of the dishes :(. I usually order the Chicken Madeira, which is super tender and moist...my fave!  The Louisiana chicken pasta is scrumptious as well.  This time, I went for the nachos...they were extremely greasy, and were loaded with cheese, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.  I should have ordered a ""small plate"" but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  There goes the hour-long workout I did earlier tonight!"
flying s.,"San Francisco, United States",0,15,1,1.0,2/1/2013,"Terrible management of large groups.  We have held our office holiday lunches there for years, and we will never go back.  The last few years were glitchy and poorly handled, but this last holiday event was the nail in the coffin.  They had an entire month to plan for our 40-person lunch, but they did not.  We arrived and waited in the very crowded, seatless foyer for over one hour (with little children, mind you), while the airheaded hostess seated 3-, 4-, and 5-member parties without reservations ahead of us.  Then, when we were finally seated, it was in three completely different areas of the restaurant!  This is a holiday lunch!  They had a whole month!  Never again.  Their food isn't even that great, it's just affordable and has huge portions.  They are not worth our business, and no one with a big group should ever come here."
Senthil V.,"Pleasanton, United States",81,149,20,4.0,13/6/2011,"I usually wont do this but am gonna start with a con .... 10 mins avg wait time. Well thats about it for negatives (but it does bother me a lot).  Aside that, this place tops my list any day for pizza, pasta n most of all the dessert. The Choc truffle tower cake is simply outta the universe. ...  You cannot get of it ever .... If ever you have a week off gyming.. DO NOT hesitate to try this, cos u wud need the rest of the month to burn it ... ;)"
Nicole M.,"Fremont, United States",14,202,59,5.0,23/7/2013,I love this place!  Everything is great on the menu and they have a big variety of food choices to choose from.  My favs are the thai chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken madeira.  Lunch portions are big and in- expensive too.  Drinks are well made and give you a good buzz.  Red Velvet Cheesecake is the bomb!  Service is always great and most of the time wait is not that bad.
Eugene P.,"Santa Clara, United States",15,216,144,4.0,8/6/2011,"Every time we go to this location, we've been lucky enough to get great waiters. Its always packed and there is at least a 30 min wait. Its a good idea to get your buzzer and go into the mall to do some window shopping. We always get their salads and find they are very filling. We always get a cheesecake but never the same one. We pretty much went through all their selections and never really had a bad one. So the only bad thing is the wait. Everything else is all good."
John O.,"Los Angeles, United States",98,215,17,4.0,29/8/2013,"what can i say?  it's as consistent as mcdonald's and one of the better chains out there.  you have a lot of choices, and most of them are pretty good.  portions are very big, and prices are very reasonable. i really come here for the food more than for the cheesecake/desserts, and favorites are the cajun jambalaya, louisiana chicken pasta, orange chicken, chicken enchiladas, and a whole lot more. you could do a hell of a lot worse and really not that much better, unless you are going for a really high-end place."
George L.,"Saratoga, United States",22,228,,3.0,7/5/2011,"Came here for a late Mother's Day Lunch.  I ordered a lunch portion Cobb salad, which was enormous and decently fresh, which is a plus.  I also had tastes of the Pasta Da Vinci, as well as appetizers like the Spinach and Cheese Dip (which was fairly salty IMO) and the Calamari, which was unremarkable.  The service was really attentive, which could have been good luck or the fact that our table seemed to be staffed by a waiter and a person who was being trained (or so it seemed).  Much moreso than usual. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory several times and this time was one of my best experiences here. A solid 3.25-3.5/5"
