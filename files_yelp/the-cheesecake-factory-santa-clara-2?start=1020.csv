Jay G.,"Vacaville, United States",11,21,5,4.0,10/7/2011,This review is for the Cheesecakes. I recently ordered a full Redvelvet Cheesecake as a birthday cake and asked if it can be personalized.  The only way that they can personalize it is by writing the message on a nice big chocolate bar.  It did cost an extra $3 but it was well worth it.  I also think the person who wrote the message was an artist because it looked beautiful!
Angi M.,"San Jose, United States",24,57,125,4.0,8/7/2013,"I have never been too thrilled with what I get from the regular menu though the choices are broad here. I do enjoy the desserts though, the Lemoncello Torte is amazing!"
Erika V.,"Salinas, United States",59,37,36,5.0,8/7/2013,"THIS REVIEW IS SOLELY FOR THE BAR SERVICE! My boyfriend and I occasionally come here. The wait for two is never too bad. However the seating for two is not the most ideal all the time, next to strangers to your right and to your left and sometimes you don't always want to sit face to face rather next to one another. This time we chose to sit at the bar. Let me just say it was the best decision ever! I didn't get the bartender's name but he looked like the guy from the Skyfall 007 movie. Personable, charismatic and attentive would be the three words to describe him. We ordered the avocado egg rolls..best ones I've had so far. fresh avocado and the outside of the roll crisped to perfection. We often order the orange chicken dish split into two which is a great portion. The chicken was perfectly white inside, nice and crisp on the outside and the rice was delish! The bar setting was quiet and intimate enough for our Saturday date night I am definitely coming back and hopefully we get the same bartender :)"
Kenny L.,"San Francisco, United States",174,762,80,4.0,16/8/2011,"I've been to this location a few times, and usually the WAIT sucks, but then that goes for ALL cheesecake factories.  The most recent time I came here, on friday 8/12/11 for a dinner for two, it seem like a nice night. The waitress was really nice and was quick/fast with everything like refilling water, asking if everything is ok, etc.  The small appetizers they offer now are really good. I always like the classic calamari and the steak diane combo they have here which is one of my favorites. They have some new chicken samosas that are good, so is the artichoke and crap dip too. They have a new special menu and we ordered a chicken-something, it came with basil noodles crusted chicken breast. a Little on the saltier side, but I liked it."
Cindy N.,"San Jose, United States",65,34,,4.0,20/9/2011,"Came here for my parents' anniversary maybe last year, so maybe my review is a tad outdated. What I'm totally sure about, however, is the fact that: - the food is delicious, at least to my tongue.  - the wait is ridiculous sometimes, but I guess that's understandable... there ARE a lot of people. - I've never actually tried the cheesecake, because I'm not really the kind of person to eat it a lot, so... Aw, short review! Anyway, the waiter service is of course splendid and food is splendid. Make sure your wallet is in your pocket, though! Good things don't come cheap."
Joshua T.,"Milpitas, United States",2,21,3,4.0,18/12/2013,Quite a formal place to dine. Great atmosphere. Fix for a friend gathering. Love the spaghetti and the pizza was okay. Their fruity drinks were good too. Cheesecake's fan but wasn't impress with any of the 4 we ordered.
Tina L.,"San Francisco, United States",163,142,122,4.0,24/12/2010,"I probably had the most tastiest steak here ever!  The salad was freaking delicious, my steak, I felt it was cooked to perfection! Service was good, the waiter filled my drink on time and didn't keep me waiting like some other places do. Typical Cheesecake ambiance, dark-ish lighting...."
John T.,"San Diego, United States",0,27,,4.0,7/2/2015,"As long as your sitting inside the restaurant the experience and food is great. But if you ever wanted to sit on the patio I highly suggest a gas mask.You are literally sitting next to a sewer vent, so instead of tasting your food you're tasting.... you got the idea."
Ayla L.,"Milpitas, United States",100,63,,3.0,14/10/2014,"I went here with my husband since it had been a while since I've seen here and he had come to visit as he is in the military and is often gone for long periods of time. I know the wait is always long and for the food & desserts I don't mind. This weekend we went there and waited 45 mins which was fine nothing wrong with that, got seated and the entire time both my husband and i felt that the serve seemed to be talking very fast and we felt kind rushed. through our entire meal. We placed our drink and appetizer order, took about 10 minutes to get a water and a soda, placed our entree orders which about 20 minutes later our appetizer came out (we had the nacho's) then about 7 minutes later our entree came out. To me 30 minutes for my appetizer is a long time and to bring out our food a few minutes later is just ridiculous. I barely ate my entree and when i went to place my dessert order the waitress didn't even ask if we wanted to order dessert or if we need/wanted anything else she handed my husband the bill before I could even ask for my dessert. So I said I would like a cheesecake before she walked away and she took my order &  we took it to go. I normally have very great service but I was very disappointed with my visit to this location."
Steven C.,"San Francisco, United States",155,550,297,3.0,8/4/2008,"What is with the wait for this place? 30-45min ZOMG. Cheesecake Factory has a rep for being good, but not THAT good. There's not much seating in the waiting area either so after 20min of standing around packed body to body and staring at the back of the person's head in front of you, you'll more than likely start feeling emo. I sure as hell did. I'm not sure why my immediate family or all the other people standing around aimlessly waiting choose to endure the long wait times. Note to self: demand a change in restaurants for family reunion dinners. Food isn't great but it's not bad either, some dishes are hit or miss but overall it's standard fare and any choice should be pretty solid on their huge menu. There isn't really a list of recommendations for this place listed on Yelp so I'm going to go ahead and suggest ordering their Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic for pasta lovers. Works for me, not too bland but just be sure to mix the bottom of the plate with the bow tie pasta. Regarding their cheesecakes.. I like them, not the best but still pretty good. Waiter service could use some work here, perhaps understaffed since its' been pretty meh the last few times I went. On a random note, it may just be me but this particular cheesecake restaurant feels poorly lit with the lights being dimmer than what I recall from other stores. Maybe it's lit poorly to encourage food coma naps after eating their huge portions, shrug. This Cheesecake Factory would be a lot more enjoyable place to visit if they ever chose to expand. Something tells me even though I complain about the long wait times and mediocre service,  I'll still be coming here in the near future cause of family and once again, the cycle of whining goes on."
Mike R.,"Santa Clara, United States",71,140,54,2.0,16/7/2011,"Beyond the obvious large menu selection and busy dining room, the cheesecake is supposed to the the leading item. I'm not impressed. The cheesecakes all taste the same to me, like they have one basic recipe/batter and then just add a flavor to market another variation. And... sugar sugar sugar!!! just wayyyyyy too sweet for my taste. One bite is good, and that's all I can manage to stomach."
Alena B.,"Silicon Valley, United States",157,821,21,2.0,5/6/2011,I really don't get the appeal.  The wait is long and the food is mediocre.  They don't even have a children's menu which is a bummer.  The menu is HUGE which means that they do a little bit of everything and nothing very well.  I always opt for the chicken pasta because it's a safe bet.  The Teriyaki chicken wasn't great...i guess the potstickers are okay too.  The two stars I am giving it is for the cheesecake...which is OF COURSE delicious!   Please please please go somewhere else for date night....go to some cute little local hole in the wall in support of local businesses and find something amazing rather than waiting with a pager for 45 minutes outside this place with everyone else.  It's really nothing special...unless you are getting cheesecake!
Herrick L.,"Fremont, United States",48,39,,3.0,2/6/2011,"Expect a long wait. The Cheesecake Factory is a popular restaurant, with a very appealing interior and a wide variety of signature cheesecakes and entrees. The serving sizes can be a bit too much, depending on what you order, so if you have a habit of always trying to clear your plate like I do, you will find it difficult to leave room for one of their delicious cheesecakes. Actually, even when I have to struggle to breathe from the amount of food I've eaten, I still make it a point to order a cheesecake. To me, they are just that good.  My favorite lunch option is the Margherita pizza, which uses fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil and is baked on a delicious flatbread crust. For dinner, I like the Steak Diane and Hibachi Steak. As for cheesecake, my favorite is definitely the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The pros: - Food is usually good, cheesecakes are thick and delicious - Large dinner servings if you're hungry, but some might see this as a con.  - Spacious, classy interior, provides an excuse to dress up a little The cons: - Pretty expensive (cheesecakes $7+, entrees $15-$25+) - Always a long wait - For the cost, I was expecting the entrees to be tastier.  - Would like a smaller size option for dinner entrees Overall, I think I wouldn't come here much if it weren't for the cheesecakes. The cost and the driving distance are also an issue for me, since I live ~20 minutes away. It's worth trying though, if you don't mind waiting in line, taking home leftovers and paying a little extra, you will probably enjoy coming here more than I do."
NewTo S.,"San Jose, United States",4,101,1,1.0,17/4/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this particular one disapoints. We went Monday 3/11 and our food was cold, under-seasoned and tasted old  - like it had been siting out for hours - surprisingly awful compared to our experiences with Cheesecake Factory in the past. Guess I'll be going to the Yard House across the street or CPK in the mall instead when I'm in the area from now on."
Linda B.,"Saratoga, United States",8,257,5,3.0,19/1/2009,"Interesting, tasty food Quick, accommodating service Lovely, peaceful decor Amazingly, I have never tried the cheesecake!"
Hanna Y.,"Bay Area, United States",70,306,1,4.0,6/3/2011,"Back in the day, cheesecake factory had this special pizazz about it that when one thought of Cheesecake Factory, one reacted ""oOOoo!"" with eyes wide open. These days, it's kinda rubbing off like any other chain restaurant.  Nothing fancy shmancy about it.  Their actual dinner plates aren't as delicious as their small plates and appetizers.  However, they have a pretty decent drink menu.   I think the best appetizer I've had is the Thai Lettuce Wraps - no grease, no fat, no cholesterol.  Just good, healthy, fresh, and hearty meal.  Good for lunch or dinner.  Enough for 2.  Prices haven't changed much, and they've added new things to their menu, such as the small plates. Good for groups, good service, obviously a plethora of cheesecake."
Alex K.,"San Jose, United States",643,334,79,3.0,19/2/2011,"I came here for a Valentines day lunch. Not crowded at all (keep in mind V-day fell on a Monday this year) The food was typical for Cheesecake Factory.  My complaint about the restaurant is with out fail, every time I dine here the servers switch to take a break or lunch. The problem with this is the first server can be amazing and then the second server is slow, uninviting and obviously wants to get you out. Who do you tip? What's the point?  I tried the Baja Chicken Littles. They were basically boneless chicken crispers. The sauce that is served with them has a great flavor. For desert I had the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Supposedly this is their ""most popular cheesecake"" I thought the frosting was overwhelming. I will probably stick to my old plain favorite the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake."
Brian M.,"Saratoga, United States",29,25,13,5.0,31/12/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants. Their pastas are great, especially the Spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Also good is the Chicken salad sandwich. It can get pretty crowded and they don't take reservations. Also, being at a popular mall sometimes makes it difficult to find parking."
David K.,"Cupertino, United States",735,970,188,3.0,9/1/2009,"Out of all the family type dine in restaurants (chili's, applebee's, tgif, etc.), hands down Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my top favorite places to eat. yeah all the food there probably isnt fresh ingredients and what not, but i love the big portions which leave you with some good left overs later. im  only giving this place a 3 star cause its nothing WOW about it, but decent at best. my gf and i went there for happy hour once, i thought it was fairly cheap, everything under 5 bucks.  also the only thing i dont really like about this cheesecake factory is the mall parking, sucks!"
James S.,"San Diego, United States",26,401,32,4.0,3/5/2013,"Really like this place. Too bad its not on the Santana Row side. Warm atmosphere and a wide variety of food. Still, its a bit toooo much. Would be nice if they scaled back the menu a bit and decided what kind of restaurant it really wants to be. Oh well, this is a corporate chain."
