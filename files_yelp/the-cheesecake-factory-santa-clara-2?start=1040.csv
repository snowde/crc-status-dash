Lisa N.,"San Jose, United States",410,712,345,3.0,22/1/2011,"I can't say I love their food. I've been to Cheesecake many times, and try to order something different but nothing has yet to jump out and say THIS DISH IS SO GOOD..not not yet.. it's just okay. Their Linda Fudge Cake is really good though! I like their calamari but their stuffed mushrooms is a no no. NOT my cup of tea...the sauce was just too much for me. I had the shrimp scampi with chicken madeira. I didn't like it. My fiance had the Louisiana Pasta, I didn't like it but he liked it. I just wasn't feeling it. I had the cucumber martini and that was okay. THe strawberry lemonade needed to be watered down it was way too sweet."
Antonio C.,"San Jose, United States",24,14,4,2.0,3/9/2013,"I gave this place 2 stars only cause the waiter was real polite, kind,and busted his ass....the food was horrible we couldn't get a cheese cake....at the Cheesecake Factory....really.....the front matradee  was a little rude and a bit of a moron. I told my wife that we shall never return to this place for any reason."
Jhey W.,"Fremont, United States",1,22,13,1.0,21/10/2013,I can't believed people give this restaurant a 3 stars. In my experience the service is sucks. I ordered a Kobe burger and when the waiter serve it it the top bun is missing. The buger patty is overflowing with oil. I was thinking that they are some kind of a descrimination people. I don't like this place and I will never come back again...
James D.,"Sunnyvale, United States",156,587,259,1.0,3/5/2010,"Although I find this place very sub par I do not know how I always find myself dining here! I guess because it's of other people's choice, but damn what a headache to come here, especially on the weekends. First off they don't take reservations so don't bother trying to have a birthday dinner here with large parties, you're just going to give yourself gray hair. So when I headed to the front to let the hostess know dinner for 7 (which isn't A LOT of people) she gave me a pager and said, ""for your large party, you're going to have to wait for a manager, and he'll give you a quote on how long your wait is"". Okay?! I have to wait for someone to tell me how long the wait really is, cool. While we waited, we just sat there in the lobby taking in ambiance and watching other people wait still thinking wow, why don't they take reservations. Total wait time was about a half hour which was acceptable (mind you I've waited an hour plus before) had we'd been told but while waiting absolutely no manager came out to ""greet us and tell us when our table was ready"" Anyways we were seated in a booth fitting 6 so my girlfriend's dad had to sit on a wicker chair at the head of the table. For $150 not including tip; our party got 7 entrees, 1 appetizer, 3 drinks, a free birthday cake the size of a baby's fist that didn't include cheesecake, inattentive service unless they overheard us, creepy manager guy looking over the wall that surrounded us, a birthday song for my girlfriend's little sister, and hella to go boxes. Considering I was the only one to finish my food, I wondered if my girlfriend's family even liked theirs. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic which was yummy as always, but what brings me to give this place 1 star so easily is the freaking service. Do these people get underpaid? Or maybe they just don't care? I thought one of the things we were so suppose to learn from the recession was that no job is safe and that everyone should work harder for what they currently possess. I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory but there is absolutely nothing that entices me to venture back, not even the oh so decadent cheesecakes, Farfalle Pasta and Fried Macaroni and Cheese. Yes your food is pretty good, but damn your service blows harder than a pornstar."
ChiYan T.,"San Francisco, United States",127,180,197,4.0,28/2/2010,"Yea, I know, it's a chain. I avoid the SF Union Square location like the plague. The wait times here are horrendous during peak hours. Everyone hates how the range of those electric light-em-up buzzers don't last to the Macy's next door, much less the mall indoors. Service is inconsistent due to the huge crowds and multiple large parties. So why the four stars?  IT CLOSES AT 12:30AM ON A SATURDAY. You know, when Straits, and everywhere else under the sun stopped at 11PM and the only other food in the entire San Jose/Cupertino/Santa Clara border would be either crappy pho, Dennys, Carrows, or the Jack-in-the-Box down the street.  See! Starting to sound appetizing? Sacrilegious as that statement may be?  Hungry after a little barhopping at Santana Row, it's conveniently right across Stevens Creek Blvd at the Valley Fair mall. Coming in this late there's no line and the place was pretty relaxed and lowkey. They do stop taking orders around midnight but they didn't rush us to leave after our plates arrived. We were able to recoup in a comfortable booth sipping some Tumi tea, with the hot water in out pots promptly refreshed from our friendly and courteous waiter.  The appetizers here are pretty good, from the gooey oh so delicious melt-in-your-mouth ""Avocado Eggrolls"", to the ""Salmon Spring Rolls"" served atop a bed of shredded red cabbage and topped with a gingery soy sauce so yummy, I had at one time contacted the franchise corporate office asking if I could buy a bottle (they were kind in their reply but wouldn't give it). I usually eat this whole thing like a salad. And of course, their cheesecakes are sinfully delicious. I've never caught onto their main courses, pastas, or salads here. And the nutritional guide can be jawdropping. Some of the things you'd think were healthier, like stuffed dates, have double the calories of the onion rings. Kid's portion pasta alfredo has 1800+ calories. That's a scary thing to feed a child.  But overall, compared to the limited options in the nearby area, this is was a great and relaxing way to wind down a boozy night in the local area.  Note: Oh, and be careful. 4-inch heels with no tread are going to slip all over the polished tiled floors here. Not that I was THAT drunk =P."
Selina S.,"Campbell, United States",52,307,237,4.0,9/3/2011,"I love cheesecake factory!!!!! It's always so busy for dinner so my husband and I tend to go for a late lunch around two. We usually don't wait longer than ten mins as well. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is friendly. I would say about 85% of the time our waiter/ waitress is great.    The best dishes I love: calamari, Thai lettuce wraps, bang bang chicken and shrimp, BBQ burger, chicken bacon avocado sandwich, and there's a few more but enough about the food. The cheesecakes are so delicious but we never order them because it's just way too many calories. My fav is the white chocolate blueberry when I do feel like splurging.         This restaurant is great for family dinners but is slightly pricey but the food is worth it. Also their menu has so many items to choose from. It's awesome;)"
Irene L.,"Milpitas, United States",62,1348,4,3.0,17/4/2013,"Haven't been here in a while and don't quite miss it. Eh mediocre food for a slightly higher price cause of the name & ambiance.The service is friendly. I ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich and my bun was so soggy and bits of the eggplant were hard to eat. :( BOO. And the salad w/ the vinaigrette dressing was a bit overpowering. Convenient location in VF and off 880 which I like, but this place is kind of good just for gatherings and what not."
Wayne Q.,"Berkeley, United States",58,410,230,4.0,1/8/2010,"I have always loved Cheesecake Factory since its humble beginnings in the '80s.  This particular location, maybe during these tough times, doesn't seem to have much of a wait for lunch.  On a recent visit, I ordered a chicken-pasta something or other that just did not taste right at all.  Since we were in a bit of a rush, I didn't really complain and tried to eat it.  The chicken was just too hard and dry.  When the waitress returned to collect plates, she took a look at my plate and asked whether everything was OK.  I then told her about the chicken, and she immediately went and told her manager.  She came back, and I guess had even taken a bite herself and was in agreement that it was not up to par at all.  They ended up comping us a free slice of cheesecake, which was a very nice gesture. Sure-fire dishes every time are the Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Avocado Egg Rolls.  You may need to request bread, which I also think is really good. Of the three or four Cheesecake Factorys in the SF Bay Area, my favorite is still the one in Corte Madera (see my review for that location)."
Kedar M.,"Santa Clara, United States",78,75,11,5.0,17/5/2013,"This review is for their pineapple upside down cake (PUDC) ! Came here for a late night dessert bite. The cake was really delicious! I like a little variety in my bites unlike their chocalate cheesecakes that have too much chocalate for my taste buds. The PUDC was a good change, perfect with the whipped cream. Yumm! Try it out while you are there!"
Liz V.,"San Jose, United States",13,23,,4.0,19/6/2013,I been wanting to eat here for the longest.  Sure enough got the opportunity by taking my nephew Jessy out for his birthday.  The place is nice only think a little bit dark but that's ok.  The menu WOW !!! talk about a selection O M G!! didn't know what I wanted so much to choose from.  Finally order from the skinny menu that's nice to know they offer this.  Everything was all good until we got the bill.  They charged us 3 times on my credit card that's why I gave them 4 stars.  So beware customers at your bill double check everything for overcharges.  I did bring it to there attention and they did take care of it.  Thank you management you did what you said you were going to do.  I will definitely try this place again and recommend to others.. :)
Kimmy N.,"San Jose, United States",135,87,19,2.0,31/1/2010,"First Impressions:  This might be bias, but I hate Cheescake Factory.  No hunger deserves to wait 2 hrs for mediocre food.  Parking at Valley Fair is horrible generally.  I really think people live there, they go shopping, they eat, shop some more, go get a massage at the stands, and then a hair cut, shop and eat again.  Really packed parking lot everyday and almost every hour of everyday. Decor:  It looks like Cheesecake factory.  If you are confuse, please click on this image link here:  Service:  From beginning to end, you get a pager at the front, 45 minutes later they tell you wait to the left, 10 minutes later a host/hostess seats you and makes small talk, 10 minutes later your server comes.  At this time I am ready for some bread because I am so hungry and know what I am going to order.  The server comes and tell you the special for the deal and tries to confuse you. (Not a bad thing), but I wish I would know about the special before I made up my mind an hour ago while waiting.  In general the server was catering, here and there all the time.  Taste:  Bleeehhh.  After reading the novel, you better watch out.  I have hit a few grenades eating at this and other cheesecakes.  When I mean grenades, I mean horrible food!  There are some that are decent.  The Louisiana pasta is ok. Specialty:  This might be really obvious, the cheesecake. Price: $25/person (with dessert) Recommendations:   I love their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake (not very fond of the Pumpkin Pecan).  I also like the dulce leche, Godiva, oh what the heck, I love them all.  I would Cheesecake give it 2.75 stars if you didn't have to wait for an hour, no novel menu, and not so many grenades on the menu."
Vicky C.,"CA, United States",13,172,15,3.0,13/1/2011,"Want giant portions of fatty poisons?  Look no further. Delicious yes, however.... still poison. The prices are pretty high so I guess they have to make it up in the portions so you don't feel cheated. I go here on occasion with a big group or to get something to go. Service is above average and an entree is enough to feed 2 people. Other than that it's your basic family restaurant."
Bindi S.,"San Jose, United States",23,115,5,4.0,24/9/2010,"I am probably one of very few people alive who like waiting for a table. It reminds me of my hometown where it is fairly common to wait atleast 45 minutes for a table. My first visit to Cheesecake factory included a 2 hour wait for a table. Yes, 2 hours. Well they actually gave us a tiny table in an hour and 45 mins but we opted to wait another 15 mins for a booth to open up. Service at the reception is really terrible...it should be on a first come first serve basis and not on the number of people in the party. We were just 2 and a lot of big groups were getting seated before us even though they came in after. Onto the food. Yummy bread basket, friendly server, good food, average portion size (thought the richness of the food fills you up). We ordered the avocado spring rolls (simply yumilicious), crispy artichoke hearts and the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza between 2 of us. I really enjoyed the pizza - it had the perfect combination of veggies, cheese and the slightly sweetish crust. This was one of the better tasting pizzas I have had so far in California. This was a drink free dinner as my husband and i are both trying to cut down on empty calories and our bill for the food came to about $33. I think it was a very reasonable price for a great ambience, lots of people watching and good food. Cant wait to go again!"
Kimmy G.,"Sunnyvale, United States",212,390,36,3.0,20/11/2010,"This is by far the busiest Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.  Yes, it was  Friday night, but man this place was packed.  The nice thing about the Cheesecake Factory is you pretty much know what you are going to get...their menu is a book, their entrees are huge, and they have Paradise Ice Tea (love) and of course there are plenty of desserts to choose from.  My Saigon Sandwich...good, chocolate cake...good, and everyone else seemed to like their food.  Waiting almost an hour to eat?  Eh...not as fun.  Is there a WOW factor?  Maybe not so much, but it was filling and I left pretty satisfied.  So thank you Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair for filling my belly with goodness."
Butterfly A.,"San Jose, United States",582,790,406,4.0,14/1/2010,"Today was our anniversary and we were going to go to Reno or Vegas to celebrate but didn't since our cat is very sick now and still in the hospital. I didn't want to go at first but was glad that I did. We shared the avocado egg rolls which are delicious. The cilantro sauce that comes with it is really good too. I also like their fresh sourdough bread and butter. It was soo good that I ate maybe five pieces and three pats of butter. I blew my diet for tonight, but oh well! I haven't had anything this yummy in over a week. Plus, if I don't cheat once in awhile, I'd go insane if I deprive myself of bad carbs too much, lol.  I also got a pina colada and it was pretty good too. My husband got a large bowl of the Mexican tortilla soup. I was sorry that I didn't get that as it looked good. For the entree, I got something I haven't gotten in a long time, the Cajun Jambalaya dish. It comes with chicken and shrimp and is served over pasta. If you'd rather have it served with rice though, you have to tell your server that. I failed to do that today and when I got my dish, I was like, crap! I didn't want to bother the waitress so just ate it anyways. The pasta was OK, but it was a little undercooked. The portion is huge so I ended up taking most of it home.  I didn't eat much of the pasta, so maybe the scale won't reflect that tomorrow. I also ordered the Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I'm not sure if that's the right name for it, but it's really good! I just might have a few bites later as today is a day to celebrate! I'll be good tomorrow and maybe take a long overdue trip to the mall to get myself something cute to cheer me up and to walk off those extra pounds.  I almost forgot to mention that it tends to be so loud in there, that my husband got away with letting out a huge loud five second fart and bragged about it in the car. I didn't hear it but cracked up when he said it was a juicy one, LOL! He loves to do embarrassing stuff like that from time to time and even though I tell him that he shouldn't be doing that in public, it still cracks me up. I really needed that laugh today!"
Chris L.,"San Francisco, United States",665,1731,1158,3.0,12/11/2010,"Why is this place so crowded all the time!  I see people of all ages, families, prom dates, casual/more formal dates, etc. here.  The wait is very long and I don't think it's worth it unless you're craving something specifically off the menu like the chicken and biscuits, salmon firecracker rolls or strawberry lemonade.  Good place, good times and good memories but try to go when it's not crowded."
Raquel R.,"San Jose, United States",93,288,62,3.0,3/12/2010,So I ventured here again tonight and I was kind of disappointed. I was disappointed last time I came here to. This time I ordered the bacon BBQ burger and for some reason it really didn't have much taste. How can that be? It was plain. the fries were okay but seriously the best thing about my meal was the free bread that they give you. Even my drink was watery-it was a soda... Last time I came here I got the Hibachi Steak that i have had before at other cheesecakes- this one was not good. Bits of the steak was hard and it made me feel so sick later on.  THe only redeeming factor was the service. She was spectacular and kept coming back to make sure we had everything we needed. I'm pretty sure she asked if we wanted more soda like 3 times... which is pretty unheard of.  I used to think coming here was a huge treat but now I'm not so sure. The prices do not equal the food quality or taste.
Michelle W.,"Union City, United States",187,389,1256,3.0,4/1/2010,"To the hostess up front, Thanks for giving us a broken pager, thus prolonging our wait an additional 25 minutes. Our growling stomachs were not pleased with your technical difficulties.  To the bartender, Thanks for serving me a pre-poured glass of Reisling that tasted as flat as water. But at least you switched it up for a new glass at my request, so I suppose I can't bash on you too much. Watching your quick hands mix and pour nonstop was quite impressive and entertaining, so keep up the good work! To whoever posted the calorie count for the cheesecakes, Thank you for saving me from completely destroying my health tonight. 1556 unforgiving calories for a slice of red velvet cheesecake?! Absurd.  Like any other chain restaurant, I try to avoid Cheesecake Factory as much as possible (not because I don't like it, but there's just SO many other local businesses I'd rather support first). The great thing about CF is that the portions are gimongulous and actually worth what you pay for. I'll admit, a few dishes can be a bit steep, but nothing too extraordinary for the most part. I love that the waiters act as professional as possible. Coming here since I was 16, I don't recall ever having customer service issues at any CF location I've been to. 5-stars for the service, 3-stars for the mediocre food and prices."
Sam B.,"Santa Clara, United States",194,818,933,3.0,18/3/2012,"I don't enjoy going to restaurant and waiting in lines for more 30 minutes or more for a table but I do love their Cheesecake.  It is so freaking crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Personally, the food here is very salty so we just come here for Cheesecake to-go. They have special parking sports across the main entrance to park your car for 10-minutes and pick-up your order. You can call to order but I prefer to just walk to the bakery and order my cake."
Jennifer V.,"Tracy, United States",72,72,14,3.0,18/1/2011,"what can i say... they have EVERYTHING! it was one of those nights where we ( my bf and i) couldn't figure out what sounded good to eat, we were starving and, already out. So we ended up at Cheesecake.  pros: they have something you'll like, big portions, nice decor, and they have awesome cheesecakes!  cons: the wait time is almost always on hour! BOOO!!!!  in this instance we headed to the bar and ended up eating there.. disaster diverted! lol  with a long island in hand we shared the pot stickers.. they were pretty good.  I recommend the tuna salad with wasabi dressing.. its the bomb! ask for more wasabi on the side.. its nose tingling good!  the bf had a pasta dish..it was not so good.. not memorable enough to remember the dishes name anyway. it was blan and dry, we had to ask for more sauce.  you really can't go wrong at cheesecake their menu is sure to please."

Kimmy N.,"San Jose, CA",135,87,19,2.0,1/31/2010,"First Impressions:  This might be bias, but I hate Cheescake Factory.  No hunger deserves to wait 2 hrs for mediocre food.  Parking at Valley Fair is horrible generally.  I really think people live there, they go shopping, they eat, shop some more, go get a massage at the stands, and then a hair cut, shop and eat again.  Really packed parking lot everyday and almost every hour of everyday. Decor:  It looks like Cheesecake factory.  If you are confuse, please click on this image link here:  Service:  From beginning to end, you get a pager at the front, 45 minutes later they tell you wait to the left, 10 minutes later a host/hostess seats you and makes small talk, 10 minutes later your server comes.  At this time I am ready for some bread because I am so hungry and know what I am going to order.  The server comes and tell you the special for the deal and tries to confuse you. (Not a bad thing), but I wish I would know about the special before I made up my mind an hour ago while waiting.  In general the server was catering, here and there all the time.  Taste:  Bleeehhh.  After reading the novel, you better watch out.  I have hit a few grenades eating at this and other cheesecakes.  When I mean grenades, I mean horrible food!  There are some that are decent.  The Louisiana pasta is ok. Specialty:  This might be really obvious, the cheesecake. Price: $25/person (with dessert) Recommendations:   I love their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake (not very fond of the Pumpkin Pecan).  I also like the dulce leche, Godiva, oh what the heck, I love them all.  I would Cheesecake give it 2.75 stars if you didn't have to wait for an hour, no novel menu, and not so many grenades on the menu."
Vicky C.,"CA, CA",13,172,15,3.0,1/13/2011,"Want giant portions of fatty poisons?  Look no further. Delicious yes, however.... still poison. The prices are pretty high so I guess they have to make it up in the portions so you don't feel cheated. I go here on occasion with a big group or to get something to go. Service is above average and an entree is enough to feed 2 people. Other than that it's your basic family restaurant."
Bindi S.,"San Jose, CA",23,115,5,4.0,9/24/2010,"I am probably one of very few people alive who like waiting for a table. It reminds me of my hometown where it is fairly common to wait atleast 45 minutes for a table. My first visit to Cheesecake factory included a 2 hour wait for a table. Yes, 2 hours. Well they actually gave us a tiny table in an hour and 45 mins but we opted to wait another 15 mins for a booth to open up. Service at the reception is really terrible...it should be on a first come first serve basis and not on the number of people in the party. We were just 2 and a lot of big groups were getting seated before us even though they came in after. Onto the food. Yummy bread basket, friendly server, good food, average portion size (thought the richness of the food fills you up). We ordered the avocado spring rolls (simply yumilicious), crispy artichoke hearts and the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza between 2 of us. I really enjoyed the pizza - it had the perfect combination of veggies, cheese and the slightly sweetish crust. This was one of the better tasting pizzas I have had so far in California. This was a drink free dinner as my husband and i are both trying to cut down on empty calories and our bill for the food came to about $33. I think it was a very reasonable price for a great ambience, lots of people watching and good food. Cant wait to go again!"
Kimmy G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",212,390,36,3.0,11/20/2010,"This is by far the busiest Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.  Yes, it was  Friday night, but man this place was packed.  The nice thing about the Cheesecake Factory is you pretty much know what you are going to get...their menu is a book, their entrees are huge, and they have Paradise Ice Tea (love) and of course there are plenty of desserts to choose from.  My Saigon Sandwich...good, chocolate cake...good, and everyone else seemed to like their food.  Waiting almost an hour to eat?  Eh...not as fun.  Is there a WOW factor?  Maybe not so much, but it was filling and I left pretty satisfied.  So thank you Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair for filling my belly with goodness."
Butterfly A.,"San Jose, CA",582,790,406,4.0,1/14/2010,"Today was our anniversary and we were going to go to Reno or Vegas to celebrate but didn't since our cat is very sick now and still in the hospital. I didn't want to go at first but was glad that I did. We shared the avocado egg rolls which are delicious. The cilantro sauce that comes with it is really good too. I also like their fresh sourdough bread and butter. It was soo good that I ate maybe five pieces and three pats of butter. I blew my diet for tonight, but oh well! I haven't had anything this yummy in over a week. Plus, if I don't cheat once in awhile, I'd go insane if I deprive myself of bad carbs too much, lol.  I also got a pina colada and it was pretty good too. My husband got a large bowl of the Mexican tortilla soup. I was sorry that I didn't get that as it looked good. For the entree, I got something I haven't gotten in a long time, the Cajun Jambalaya dish. It comes with chicken and shrimp and is served over pasta. If you'd rather have it served with rice though, you have to tell your server that. I failed to do that today and when I got my dish, I was like, crap! I didn't want to bother the waitress so just ate it anyways. The pasta was OK, but it was a little undercooked. The portion is huge so I ended up taking most of it home.  I didn't eat much of the pasta, so maybe the scale won't reflect that tomorrow. I also ordered the Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I'm not sure if that's the right name for it, but it's really good! I just might have a few bites later as today is a day to celebrate! I'll be good tomorrow and maybe take a long overdue trip to the mall to get myself something cute to cheer me up and to walk off those extra pounds.  I almost forgot to mention that it tends to be so loud in there, that my husband got away with letting out a huge loud five second fart and bragged about it in the car. I didn't hear it but cracked up when he said it was a juicy one, LOL! He loves to do embarrassing stuff like that from time to time and even though I tell him that he shouldn't be doing that in public, it still cracks me up. I really needed that laugh today!"
Chris L.,"San Francisco, CA",665,1731,1158,3.0,11/12/2010,"Why is this place so crowded all the time!  I see people of all ages, families, prom dates, casual/more formal dates, etc. here.  The wait is very long and I don't think it's worth it unless you're craving something specifically off the menu like the chicken and biscuits, salmon firecracker rolls or strawberry lemonade.  Good place, good times and good memories but try to go when it's not crowded."
Raquel R.,"San Jose, CA",93,288,62,3.0,12/3/2010,So I ventured here again tonight and I was kind of disappointed. I was disappointed last time I came here to. This time I ordered the bacon BBQ burger and for some reason it really didn't have much taste. How can that be? It was plain. the fries were okay but seriously the best thing about my meal was the free bread that they give you. Even my drink was watery-it was a soda... Last time I came here I got the Hibachi Steak that i have had before at other cheesecakes- this one was not good. Bits of the steak was hard and it made me feel so sick later on.  THe only redeeming factor was the service. She was spectacular and kept coming back to make sure we had everything we needed. I'm pretty sure she asked if we wanted more soda like 3 times... which is pretty unheard of.  I used to think coming here was a huge treat but now I'm not so sure. The prices do not equal the food quality or taste.
Michelle W.,"Union City, CA",187,389,1256,3.0,1/4/2010,"To the hostess up front, Thanks for giving us a broken pager, thus prolonging our wait an additional 25 minutes. Our growling stomachs were not pleased with your technical difficulties.  To the bartender, Thanks for serving me a pre-poured glass of Reisling that tasted as flat as water. But at least you switched it up for a new glass at my request, so I suppose I can't bash on you too much. Watching your quick hands mix and pour nonstop was quite impressive and entertaining, so keep up the good work! To whoever posted the calorie count for the cheesecakes, Thank you for saving me from completely destroying my health tonight. 1556 unforgiving calories for a slice of red velvet cheesecake?! Absurd.  Like any other chain restaurant, I try to avoid Cheesecake Factory as much as possible (not because I don't like it, but there's just SO many other local businesses I'd rather support first). The great thing about CF is that the portions are gimongulous and actually worth what you pay for. I'll admit, a few dishes can be a bit steep, but nothing too extraordinary for the most part. I love that the waiters act as professional as possible. Coming here since I was 16, I don't recall ever having customer service issues at any CF location I've been to. 5-stars for the service, 3-stars for the mediocre food and prices."
Sam B.,"Santa Clara, CA",194,818,933,3.0,3/18/2012,"I don't enjoy going to restaurant and waiting in lines for more 30 minutes or more for a table but I do love their Cheesecake.  It is so freaking crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Personally, the food here is very salty so we just come here for Cheesecake to-go. They have special parking sports across the main entrance to park your car for 10-minutes and pick-up your order. You can call to order but I prefer to just walk to the bakery and order my cake."
Jennifer V.,"Tracy, CA",72,72,14,3.0,1/18/2011,"what can i say... they have EVERYTHING! it was one of those nights where we ( my bf and i) couldn't figure out what sounded good to eat, we were starving and, already out. So we ended up at Cheesecake.  pros: they have something you'll like, big portions, nice decor, and they have awesome cheesecakes!  cons: the wait time is almost always on hour! BOOO!!!!  in this instance we headed to the bar and ended up eating there.. disaster diverted! lol  with a long island in hand we shared the pot stickers.. they were pretty good.  I recommend the tuna salad with wasabi dressing.. its the bomb! ask for more wasabi on the side.. its nose tingling good!  the bf had a pasta dish..it was not so good.. not memorable enough to remember the dishes name anyway. it was blan and dry, we had to ask for more sauce.  you really can't go wrong at cheesecake their menu is sure to please."
