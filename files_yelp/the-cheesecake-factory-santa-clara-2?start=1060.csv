gail b.,"San Jose, United States",191,131,6,2.0,1/3/2011,"I'm going to make this short and sweet because I don't want to spend any more time on this restaurant review than I had spent waiting to eat at this restaurant.... Looooooong wait for 60 minutes (seems to be Cheesecake Factor's mantra...be stupid and wait forever) in a crowded waiting area and eat food that isn't even that great. The cheesecake may be awesome (I wouldn't know, I didn't have any) but it's just not worth wasting my time."
Brittany K.,"San Jose, United States",114,17,,3.0,19/5/2013,$50 dollars for a 10in cake? No thanks. But their food is pretty damn tasty
Mindy S.,"Cupertino, United States",95,29,9,5.0,6/4/2010,"YUMMY! first off i'd actually give it a 4.5* because the food is delicious..-0.5* for the service..it could get a little hard trying flag down your waiter but hey, it gets pretty busy so i can understand...but the last time i went we got the sweeeetest waitress..she offered us everything and always had a smile on her face..so i don't even know what i'm complaining about haha. i've never gone to cheesecake factory and was disappointed with my food. i always try to eat something different and i've never regretted my decision..although if i want to feel safe i go with the pasta da vinci.... but i think i've tasted heaven when i tried the breaded shrimp pasta..YUM! holy crap...i'm not not that big of a pasta person but pasta da vinci and the breaded shrimp pasta have got me hooked! for appetizers i can't seem to stay away from the artichoke dip though..maybe they sprinkle a little cocaine in there..i don't know but damn it's good! their portions are HUGE too..i never leave without a doggie bag. the prices may seem a little high but for the amount of food they give you, it's totally worth it! o yeah..since they have red velvet cheesecake now i don't know why i don't come here more often...i guess i have to give them 5*s now. hehe"
Shirley M.,"Santa Clara, United States",639,296,861,5.0,1/4/2012,"Who doesn't love this place? Variety of cheesecakes, variety of dishes? Whatever one if in the mood for no matter picky the people are they have plenty of items on the menu. Waiters and Waitresses are proffessional and on top of things. Happy hour drinks & $5.00 mini plates are value for money.."
Eric Y.,"San Jose, United States",38,26,,4.0,13/11/2013,Went here for lunch today and the food was really. I had the veggie burger and even though I am not a vegetarian the veggie burger was very tasty! The fries were good and fresh and the service was great. It gets a little busy during lunch so there can be a wait and the parking at valley fair is always difficult.
Thien N.,"San Jose, United States",90,208,280,4.0,12/11/2010,"I think I am in love...with  their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake.  It's one of the better cheeseecake they offer. As for dinner, I the Chicken Chipotle  Penne is pretty good. Not too spicy but has a kick.  Portions are big...but make sure to save room for dessert!"
Nha H.,"Antioch, United States",319,248,58,3.0,27/3/2010,"Service: good, Food: less than average especially the pasta, Ambience: Mellow, Wait: Forever so try to make a reservation, Parking: really crowded. I don't know why I keep coming back here again and again. The last two times I've been here, and I ordered the pasta, they first got my order wrong and the pasta did not have enough sauce on it so it was DRY so was the chicken that went along with it. The only plate I like here would be the wasabi salmon. That's the best, but a little bit expensive."
Jerry G.,"San Jose, United States",149,180,58,4.0,5/1/2013,"Service was good, I ordered the Cuban came out pretty darn good. Vanilla bean cheesecake is awesome!"
Karen L.,"Fremont, United States",467,379,412,4.0,6/8/2010,"Yum I love their cheesecake! They have all sorts and each unique to their own. I'm never disappointed when I come here!  I come often for either cheesecake, lunch, or dinner.  Some of my favorite pasta dishes are: four cheese pasta, pasta da vinci (my usual choice), Louisiana chicken pasta, and fettuccine Alfredo. Of all the steaks I do like their Steak Diane. It's well marinated, juicy, and not over done. The portion is just right that is if you will be having appetizers and dessert. I've tried their filet mignon and was very disappointed. The steak was over done and charred, definitely not how a steak should be! My favorite appetizers are: Fried Calamari, fried mac and cheese, and fire cracker salmon rolls. Of all their choices I found those to be more pleasant. Don't bother with their crabcakes, they were salty, mushy, and wasn't done right. Last but not least, their cheesecake!! My top choices are: White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle,  key lime, vanilla bean, and lemon raspberry cream! Though it's pricey for a slice, it's worth it!"
Lilac K.,"Saratoga, United States",27,5,,1.0,16/11/2014,"Don't go here if you are hungry!! We waited 45 minutes to get in and 40 more minutes to get the food! Eventually when we got the food, it wasn't that great. This was a complete waste of time!"
R P.,"Sunnyvale, United States",37,353,201,4.0,21/12/2010,The place is huge and depending on the time of day a long wait. The menu is frigging huge!  And always loud. The staff - very attentive and eager to please - gotta say this is refreshing The food - I was skeptical with such a large menu they could produce some good stuff.  Everything we ordered was very tasty and served hot.  Ok for a cookie cutter chain resturant I gotta give it 4 stars (compared to other cookie cutter chain resturants)
Christine T.,"San Jose, United States",656,197,89,3.0,6/12/2009,"I'm pretty impressed by this Cheesecake Factory. I can say I was expecting mediocre food along with inattentive service, but they surely proved me wrong.   The wait was extremely long on a Friday night. I could say it was more than an hour. Our beeper never went off.. My boyfriend and I were tired of the anticipation for a vibration (no pun intended) that we went to the front desk and asked why it took such a long time.  They apologized and seated us immediately after that.  The pastas are all good. I'm pretty sure that if you order any kind, you'll enjoy them. The bread is always warm and endless! One of the reasons I love coming here.  The service was just right. They gave us enough attention and were not too bothersome at times either. I hate going to places where they constantly ask if our meals is ok.. Maybe I should start eating it first before you choke me with questions!! Overall, a fantastic way to end a shopping fill evening. Dinner for 2 or even a party of more, you'll have a fantastically delicious dinner at The Cheesecake Factory."
Keith H.,"San Jose, United States",33,16,2,5.0,5/6/2011,I'm trying not to over do it on 5 star ratings but these guys deserve it. Food is always great and the service at this particular CF is consistently 5 star. My fav is the club sando and I've tried a few other dishes over the years. The only warning I'd give out is to save space for some cheesecake afterward. Seems like have the time I over indulge in appetizers and a large main course.
Mark E.,"Santa Clara, United States",5,30,3,4.0,3/6/2011,"Franchise restaurant doesn't always mean bad... The food is consistently good, wait staff are friendly and attentive.  The only down side is the wait and the fact that they do not allow reservations for large parties.  Portions are usually large enough to either share or save half for later.   Best cheesecake on the menu: Pineapple Upsidedown Cheesecake"
sammy k.,"Santa Clara, United States",1,49,1,3.0,29/5/2011,"The Good: Food Sinfully delicious cheesecakes. The Bad: Crowded Long Loooooooong wait just to be seated. The Ugly: One time, they completely forgot our to-go order and we had to wait two hours for a sandwich and a slice of cheesecake."
Che H.,"Campbell, United States",3,8,,1.0,23/11/2011,"Went there the other night with my cousin and his wife who had both flown in from out of town. Dinner was alright ... nothing spectacular. But here's the kicker; we were presented with a bill and paid it. A few minutes later the server came over and profusely apologized that they had made a mistake on our bill. At one point saying that she didn't even think that it was ours. She said that she didn't want us to have to pay for something that wasn't ours. Sounds reasonable. The manager then came by and apologized too and promised to clear things right up. However we noticed that while the server and manager made it sound like they were doing us a favor, they never came out and said what the bill discrepancy was. We started getting suspicious. Sure enough when we got the bill it was $4 higher than the previous bill. Now $4 isn't much money. And it represents less than 1% of the total bill. But on the flip side $4 IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY! They probably spent more than $4 in labor going through the whole process of adjusting the bill. It came off as cheap and petty. And worse it came off as disingenuous. They played coy making it sound like they were doing us a favor but the whole time they were covering their butts over a $4 difference. Of course I lowered my tip amount so my total payment was the same as before the adjustment was made. Basically the server got penalized. Here's a tip to anyone at CF that might be reading: good customer service means that after the bill is presented to the customer you only adjust it one way ... down in the customer's favor. If the restaurant makes a mistake that costs them money then they should 1) tell the customer and 2) EAT THE COST OF THE MISTAKE! Telling the customer sets future expectations that the price won't always be this good. Eating the cost of the mistake gives the restaurant an oppurtunity to look magnanimus and instills a feeling in the customer that the establishment cares more about them then profit. Even if this isn't true, it's the customer perception that matters here. In this case CF just looks stupid (for making a $4 mistake) and petty (for making me pay for it). I'll never go back to The Cheesecake Factory again ... and neither should you!"
Jessica A.,"Miami, United States",9,12,,4.0,21/6/2013,"This was a nice Cheesecake Factory. Service was good and the food was good. Nothing that really stands out about it versus other Cheesecake Factories, so if you know one, this one will probably be about the same."
Cat F.,"Campbell, United States",21,21,,2.0,5/2/2011,"Ahhhhh-mazingly delicious avocado eggrolls. And the rest of the food ain't that bad, either. The flavors are slightly redundant and someone in the back is a bit heavy-handed with the salt shaker (and I'm not afraid of salt, just sayin'). But overall I was totally satisfied with my appetizer (especially the eggrolls) and dish, and my husband's dish was yummy, too. What's really unfortunate is the service and the wait. The management  needs to be a bit more strategic here, in my opinion, because service is a huge deal. When you have to wait an entire hour for an early dinner on a weekday, the service better be freakin' impeccable once you're seated. Right? Right."
Cindy T.,"San Jose, United States",115,1120,468,5.0,13/10/2010,"I hate cheese, but I love Cheesecake Factory! It's perfect for brunch, lunch, dinner or any time for that matter.  They have a great atmosphere, friendly service, big portions and the food is delicious.  They're menu is endless - it's practically a book! So if you have picky eaters in your group, they're sure to find something here. I love small plates because I love eating a variety of food in a single meal so I tend to order plates off the appetizer section. Tasty appetizers: - firecracker salmon rolls - buffalo blasts  - fried calamari - chicken lettuce wraps - southern fried chicken sliders - sweet corn tamale cakes - vietnamese shrimp summer rolls Tasty entrees: - hibachi steak - the club sammie - cajun jambalya pasta Tip: They make a mean arnold palmer with passion tea, so ask for this if you want a break from the usual sodas and lemonades. My only complaint is that wait time can get pretty ridiculous on weekends and they don't accept reservations.  Boo!"
Felicia V.,"Santa Cruz, United States",5,31,,3.0,14/3/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is like the Disneyland of restaurants.  Their menu is so expansive it would be impossible to try everything once.  What I love most is their namesake item:  cheesecake.  I try a different flavor almost every time I go! Reservations are definitely necessary on weekend nights, otherwise you may end up waiting around for a while."
