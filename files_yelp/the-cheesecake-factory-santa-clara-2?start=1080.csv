Christina G.,"San Jose, United States",362,473,144,2.0,14/12/2009,"Chicken piccatta... GOOD. Super undercooked (bright pink and bloody throughout) burger when medium-well was requested...BAD.  Luckily I wasn't health department inspector.  Seriously, cook your meats!  You're going to give someone's kid salmonella or e. coli.   True, young healthy adults aren't susceptible to these bacteria infections (hey, I'm not a hypochondriac here, I'll eat most anything) but they can lead to renal failure & death specifically in children.  Remember the Jack in the Box incidents, people?  Undercooked bugers killed dozens of kids!"
Bianca L.,"San Jose, United States",275,96,37,4.0,1/10/2010,"After last night, I've concluded that you will never know what kind of service you're going to get. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be greeted by a host who was all smiles and talkative. The same goes for our waiter who had been working there for 5+ years.  Normally, I would experience a waiter who neglects my table while treating their other tables wonderfully (possibly bc I look like I'm 13 and assume I don't tip well? idk), but this waiter really knows how to take care of his guests.  I ordered the shrimp scampi and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp BLT. We also got the new cheesecake--Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Shrimp Scampi: For all you shrimp lovers..if you've never tried this, you are missing out! They give about 6 or 7 pieces of Jumbo shrimp that are lightly battered and seasoned perfectly, adorned on top of a pile of angel hair pasta. The sauce is delectable and our waiter even gave us extra sauce on the side, without me having to ask! (+++!) Shrimp BLT: Once crowned the worst, most unhealthiest sandwich ever! BUT its soo soo good. I love BLT sandwiches, but throw some shrimp in there--I'm sold! Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake: From what our waiter told us, this is their newest addition. I'm glad that they collaborated and made this beautiful piece of cheesecake. It definitely taste like a peanut butter cup. I have an exceptionally big sweet tooth so this is definitely not for those who aren't a fan of sweets nor for those watching their sugar intake. Overall, I had a great experience here. The bottomless bread basket is superb, the food was wonderful, and the service was great. I guess I'll have to cross my fingers and hope I get the same great service the next time around.  Ps. I recommend the Passion Fruit Mojito...it's YUMMY!"
Coco L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",130,939,824,3.0,19/12/2009,- The service is nice and friendly; Typical Cheesecake Factory portion- Large ;)  - Pasta di vinci was good! and their avocado egg roll is always one of my favorites!  - they have deal where you can get a free piece of cheesecake with $25 gift card purchase!
Jesse S.,"Little Elm, United States",108,782,26,2.0,12/3/2008,"Why is the wait here always so long? Their ""cheesecake"" is pretty good, but it's way overpriced. $7.50 plus tax for a single slice? Geez! The service is hit and miss. The food is below average. There are a ton of choices but nothing is really good."
V C.,"Fairfield, United States",0,12,,2.0,22/7/2011,Pros- white chocolate raspberry cheesecake Cons- way too crowded. Ambiance is noisy. It's beside a mall (that's prob why it's too crowded). Not for an intimate date scene.
Tiffany H.,"San Jose, United States",219,304,168,4.0,17/10/2010,"My mom and I were already at Valley Fair when we started to get really hungry. We decided to eat here since it was the closes restaurant we would actually eat at next to Valley Fair. Came in got seated in less then 5 minutes. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night. If it wasn't we probably would have had to wait for hours. Due to the time, which we came at around 8pm. I love the brown bread they give here. I hate the white bread it's to hard.  For our starter we got the buffalo wings. 3.5 stars. They were tasty and for 2 people it was a fair amount. My mom and I have a big appetite. As my entree I got the Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak cooked medium rare. LOVED IT. I love the way the steak is cooked and the sauce that's it's drench in. The way it was marinated was perfect for my taste buds. 5 stars for the steak! My mom got noodles with meat sauce and sausage. It's not on the menu she kind of created her own pasta. (I didn't know you can do that) I can't review on what she got because, I didn't eat it myself.  For our dessert we got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and we ordered 2 scoops of Vanilla ice cream on the side of that. You can never go wrong with Red Velvet but, it gets a little too sweet after awhile and you just want to stop eating it. The vanilla ice cream really helped eased the sweetness of the Red Velvet/Cheese. Pretend Vanilla ice cream is milk, and you'll get what I am talking about. I will give this dessert 4 stars.  Average 3.5+5+4/3 =4.11"
Freya-Loki O.,"Palo Alto, United States",85,827,68,2.0,3/4/2013,valet parking is right in the corner. bravo! but once you tried the healthy diet. you never wanna get back to taste anything that are too artificially sweet
Crystal C.,"Sunnyvale, United States",75,323,1,3.0,27/11/2010,"I have been several times but don't go with a big group. Even though we told the waiters several times to split the bill it still wasn't done. It then took 20 minutes to get someone to process the bill. After wards we did not see the waitress for the rest of the night.  They have very large portions of food. I had the mac and cheese balls which are great. The mac and cheese are creamy and the breaded crust has enough crunch. They have a marinara sauce that you can dip it in. I can just eat that as my meal. I then ordered their house salad, which was really a lot. I only took a few bites and I was full. Always expect to bring home leftovers."
Kelly B.,"San Jose, United States",99,225,167,4.0,27/9/2009,"You may have heard me be a little disparaging about ""factory"" food, but at our latest party (Happy Birthday, Acacia!), this Cheesecake factory turned out a very decent respast. It does indeed have something for everyone.  I had a avacado-filled eggroll (how do they DO that?!) that was marvelous, along with a corn fritter.  My entree was the most beautiful barbeque chicken salad.  It was nicely dressed (equally throughout the entire salad) and beautifully presented.  It was waaaaay to big to eat in one sitting, they cheerfully boxed it up for me. I ordered the raspberry white-chocolate cheesecake, so that I could take something home to Dr. R..  It was very sweet and very good.  I had a bite of the red-velvet cheesecake (ok, two bites), purely for research purposes.  That was very, very good also. Service was very solicitous.  Sodas were refilled promptly, our entrees all came at the same time and were exactly as ordered.  I was very impressed by the legion of wait-staff.  They took very good care of our group of eleven people. The restaurant itself was very crowded, very loud, but in a cheerful way.  There was a large group of people waiting when I arrived, but my party had already been seated.   It was a great party (thanks Michael Sue and Bob)... and I might have to change my tune about factory food!"
Timothy C.,"San Jose, United States",0,16,,5.0,24/3/2013,"My wife, son, and I were here for lunch two weeks ago. The waiter (sorry, I forgot his name) was very caring. We got a small plate with 4 bread slices and 6 banana slices.  Although there were only 6 thin slices of banana, it did make my 16-month old son very happy and nicely collaborated during entire lunch. We truly thank for that arrangement. The mango cheese cake was very good, not only good for adult, my son also loves it."
K T.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,,5.0,8/10/2014,"We dine here at the Santa Clara, CA location a few times throughout the year but specifically come for our daughters' birthdays as The Cheesecake Factory is their favorite restaurant. However we always forget to call ahead to have their birthday cheesecake/dessert defrosted before coming every year for each birthday event. This time, I made certain to call ahead and Francine, front end greeter did an amazing job. I could hear in the background it was very busy. She still managed to help me by asking if she could put me on hold so she could run to their bakery to find out what cheesecakes were available and in what sizes. When she came back I had another question for her in which she politely asked if she could call me back as she was going to be off in another half hour and would then be able to better assist me. What a wonderful employee to spend her nonworking unpaid time to help me with my question which was pricing on the cakes. She indeed called me back with the cake prices and additionally gave me some great news that she had spoken with the manager and they could give me a reservation for our dinner party since they don't normally do reservations after 5pm (we were coming at 7:30pm and taking our chances walking in.) She also made sure that two of her associates knew that we were coming, had a cake reserved and set out to be defrosted and that I would be bringing in candles.  When we got there, everything was taking care of as promised and even our server, Justin was already briefed on everything. He tended to our table exceptionally well, always cheerful and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. We tried new dishes and they were all amazing and delicious. The dinner servings were as usual, very generous and everyone had enough leftovers for a full meal to eat the next day...really it was that much food! We also love how they write Happy Birthday on the plate that holds the cheesecake. A big THANK YOU and KUDOS to everyone involved especially Francine and Justin. After our dinner I made sure to speak with Mandy, the restaurant manager to let her know how thankful and impressed we were with both Francine and Justin and that although Francine had already gone home, we wanted the manager to know how much we appreciated her employees' professionalism and attentiveness to our needs. This is the reason why we always come back...fantastic service, fantastic food . :-)"
Daniel G.,"San Jose, United States",253,319,3,2.0,9/10/2009,"You know how you get that feeling like ""i feel like eating XXXXX right now"" or ""We should go to XXXX"", well I am confident that I will never have that feeling about this place. I only ever come here when it gets picked by someone else. I've been here a total of 5 times now. Each time, i've ordered completely different stuff. With the exception of what I just had for lunch about a half hour ago, i cannot remember anything that i've ordered previously becuase it just isn't that memorable. The food is just so-so. The service, unlike the food, is good. But when I factor in the fact that the typical wait time is around an hour, by the time i sit and order, ANY service is going to be good service. What baffles me is how this place is always so packed?!? I don't get it. The food just isn't that great t me. Maybe it's because it's at a mall. I mean, compared to mall food, it's pretty good i suppose, but that's really not saying much. Given the choice, I would choose something elese."
Sylvia S.,"Novato, United States",42,178,44,4.0,5/11/2009,"OK, so this is one of those big chains with very little originality, but I have to give it snaps for having some delish food and dessert.   The downsides are: long waits with no reservations, crappy parking and it gets so loud in here that you can barely hear yourself, much less anyone in your group trying to talk to you. The upsides: huge menu, good service (usually), yummy and fresh food and, of course, CHEESECAKE!! My favorite savory dishes here lately are the asian ones - Caramel chicken and Orange chicken.  Both are vey good.  I also like the crab cakes, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, Shepard's Pie, Meatloaf and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. As far as cheesecake goes, I haven't had a bad one yet!  My faves are the Snicker's, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup, Pumpkin and Godiva.  YUM! Be ready to drop about $25 per person when all if said and done.  Another option is to use their ""curbside to go"", which I do from time to time.  You can get out of there for less money without buying the expensive soda and other extras.  Plus, it's fast and easy."
Peter B.,"Newark, United States",66,92,49,5.0,14/11/2010,"This place is consistently GREAT. Am I easy?!  Let's say I'm not picky, because DAMN!!!!...it's just good to be alive! Food-  Entrees were excellent, but the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake is literally crack cocaine, ground up and mixed with cream cheese. It's a scientific fact. Ambiance- My neck is killing me(from all the swiveling it was doing last night). One beautiful girl after another. Many heading to Santana Row, after getting high on cheesecake.  Now.....just need to see what the Cheesecake Factory stock symbol is, 'cause I'm going to get me some."
K F.,"West Valley, United States",25,28,,5.0,12/8/2014,I don't think they have one bad thing on the menu! For being at Valley Fair there's rarely a wait...if there is it's not a long one!
Cathy N.,"San Jose, United States",438,287,139,4.0,30/7/2010,"Took a good friend here for her bday and we had an order of the Lousiana Chicken Pasta and the Fried Mac N Cheese Balls. As I recall from past experiences here, this pasta dish usually comes out extremely tasty and flavorful. But we must've came on their off night because it was super dry and bland, and both the pasta and chicken seemed overcooked. Some extra sauce would have definitely helped.  Luckily, the Fried Mac n Cheese was a hit though! MMMmmmm never had it made this way where the mac and cheese was stuffed inside a crispy fried ball. It was beautifully presented on the plate and its uniqueness made me love it even more! Comes with 4 nicely sized mac balls. Tasted so YUM!"
Kristel Dianne D.,"San Jose, United States",101,12,11,4.0,5/12/2012,"The last time I was here with my parents, we had a very pleasant dining experience. Our waiter was constantly checking up on us to see if we needed anything and if everything was going good. Overall friendly service and delicious food!"
Kamael B.,"San Francisco, United States",2,5,,3.0,30/8/2014,Second time here visiting san jose. Both times the service was ok. I ordered the corn cakes and they were cold when they came out. I sent them back and the server came and told me the we're on the way they were re heating the same cakes and sending them back.  When they came out the plate was piping hot but the corn cakes were still cold
Jessica M.,"San Jose, United States",47,63,1,4.0,26/2/2013,The wait is crazy usually and the food isn't outstanding. Pretty typical cheesecake factory experience.  This mall has crazy parking but the restaurant is bigger than oakridge I believe. I'd def be back.
Kristine A.,"Monte Sereno, United States",275,404,97,4.0,8/9/2012,"Never, ever, ever, ever eat here for dinner if you want a table quick. They have a bar area, so that's good if you're with another person. But the wait is insane (typical hour wait for dinner). If only they accepted reservations....eh, they're not that type of restaurant. I always get the miso salmon. Typical CF. But the food here is pretty fast, compared to other CF's. Maybe because my friend Carlos works here! Ha. Cheers."
