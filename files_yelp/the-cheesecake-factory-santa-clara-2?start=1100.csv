Kary M.,"San Jose, United States",159,168,33,3.0,17/7/2010,"It's always hard to review chains... but I'm going to do it anyway. Came here after a long day of work and shopping (and because the line was too long at pizza antica). There was a 15 minute wait, so I watched the dozens of people come and go after picking up a slice of cake. Mm...cake.  When we were seated, I found our waiter pretty entertaining and friendly. I glanced at the nutritional facts in that giant booklet of theirs, and I was kind of horrified how many of their meals were almost over the daily intake of calories. Gahhh.. totally put me off... I mean....how is that possible? It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted, because the menu is like a hundred billion pages, but its nice when you can't figure out what you really feel like. I ended up just getting a fettucini alfredo, and my boyfriend got the cashew chicken meal.  The fettucini was nothing to write home about, but then again I didn't expect it to be... I just had a craving for some creamy pasta. I really liked the flavoring of the cashew chicken, but the chicken was a tad overcooked and hard.  The portions are GINORMOUS (hence why the calorie intake is so large). I really think they should consider making their portions smaller... what a waste of food. Everyone takes home doggy bags...  I had this flashback of Gordon Ramsey being horrified for the same reason during an episode of Kitchen Nightmare :) Whatever, I guess when they make as much money as they do....it doesn't matter?"
Eddie S.,"Los Altos, United States",29,143,,4.0,16/10/2012,"This review is really for a drink I ordered on my last visit: the ""Well Mannered Dirty Martini.""   Its their version of a dirty martini and was delicious - described in the menu as: ""a ""Dirty Martini"" with Ketel One Vodka and Blue Cheese Stuffed Olives"".  I'd go back in a heartbeat and order another.  I think my wife liked her mojito/cosmo, but I was too focused on mine. Ambiance: Meh - it sort of reminds me of the cafe/coffee shop in the Venetian casino in Vegas. Food: Well it beats the mall's food court. At least the servings were big. It's almost as if one doesn't go here for the food, rather one goes just to get full?) Dessert: We split a piece of cheesecake because the appetizers and entrees were so large. It was fine."
Alex K.,"Cupertino, United States",131,21,26,3.0,16/2/2012,"This place is always a hit or miss for me. Sometimes the food is really good but the service is mediocre, while sometimes the food is half decent with excellent service. To put it into perspective, I've experienced an excellent meal with an empty water glass for 3/4 of my meal. I suggest coming here with no more than 3 people, otherwise the wait just becomes a ridiculous 2-3 hour wait for a semi-decent meal."
Amanda A.,"San Mateo, United States",1,45,,4.0,25/12/2012,"We came here for a birthday.  There was a bit of a wait, but not too long (15 minutes).  It was quite busy and some tables feel too close to other people, but that wasn't a huge downer.  The server was nice and welcomed any questions we had about the menu.  Our food was very good and the cheesecake was a nice big slice (good enough for two people, or one person with a big sweet tooth).  We were stuffed at the end of it.  Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this chain restaurant and this location was no exception.  We'll be back."
Cynthia C.,"Alameda, United States",328,1967,11386,4.0,19/4/2006,"Pros:  1. I could just eat an entire meal out of the free brown bread they serve in the basket.   2. Chicken Madiera 3. Ginormous salads, that stretch my dollar! 4. Tropical infused iced tea 5. Banana creme cheesecake, first cheesecake to leave a lasting impression on me, so light and airy!  Cons:  1. The stomach acid churning wait! 2. If you get seated near the front of the restaurant, you have to march all the way to the back for the restrooms on their non-grippy floor. 3. The symphony salad has been put to rest. 4. Found out the food is not fresh, prepackaged, just like the rest of the big chains. 5. What's with all the beanie babies in front?  That's so 90's!"
Melissa T.,"Fremont, United States",285,689,138,3.0,24/7/2007,"It is with a heavy heart that I give a Cheesecake Factory less than 4 stars. I freaking LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, but this location isn't quite as nice. It's in a mall. No big deal, a lot of decent restaurants are attached to a mall - but this one doesn't even have the decent floorplanning to make you feel like you're anywhere other than a dressed-up food court. The windows all face directly towards the parking garage (ooh la la!) and the tables are literally CRAMMED together in the majority of the restaurant. Those lucky enough to score a booth might not notice the clausterphobia surrounding them, but anyone who gets one of the benched tables is sure to rub elbows with all sorts of random, creepy strangers. When I was here last weekend I had the pleasure of staring down a random perv in the table next to me (a whole 2 inches away) as he unabashedly ogled my lady parts throughout the meal. Classy. Anyhow. The servers were pretty good and the food was up to par. It's just the freaking sardine layout that can ruin a perfectly good meal. Plus, they are extrasuperduper busy on weekends so you are sure to have a bit of a wait (and tons of clausterphobia) most times of the day Fri-Sun."
Suma S.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,14,,5.0,31/3/2013,"Super food. We tried spicy cashew chicken, and chicken samosa.. both were good.. good ambiance.. and cheese cake is yummy... had Godiva chocolate cheese cake.. :) had a good time.."
Nat N.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,65,,4.0,22/12/2010,"What I love about this place is that there's something for everyone. Hands down, my favorite chain restaurant. I've been to many locations and this seems to be the best and most consistent wit their food, as well as their servers. Either that or I just come here often enough that I end up getting the same servers time and time again.  Here's a review of dishes I've had here: Avacado eggroll: Best avacado eggroll I've had. I was always hesitant to try it because the dipping sauce looks rather intimidating. For someone who is not a fan of ""greens"", it looked a little bit like pesto. Of course it tastes nothing like pesto, but rather a really sweet candied flavor. Compliments the avacado eggroll perfectly.  Caesar salad/factory chopped salad: Very generous portions. I always get the appetizer portion and don't even finish. One thing I love about their salads, it always tastes incredibly fresh. Only part that doesn't always seem fresh are the occasional stale croutons.  Miso Salmon: I know everyone generally raves about this dish, and rightfully so! Whatever they put in that miso sauce is amazing. It's so subtle and doesn't overpower the salmon at all.  Chicken Maderia: Chicken and mashed potatoes, can't go wrong with that. If I'm hungry enough this is usually my go to dish.  Crispy spicy beef: I've only had this dish once. It's one of those dishes you can only have in small portions. By the 5th piece of beef, it can be somewhat overwhelming.  Cheesecake, dulce de leche, ALWAYS. Their whipped cream is freshly made, which makes the topping that much better. My favorite part of this dessert are the little toffee bits they sprinkle on top."
Jessica Y.,"San Jose, United States",9,4,,3.0,19/8/2014,I came to Cheesecake Factory with a friend from visiting for dinner. The wait is pretty long unless you have a reservation. We waited 45 min until we got seated. After looking at the menu we decided to order the along with a plate of chicken cashews. The salmon was okay - nothing special but the chicken cashews was so salty. The food here is really heavy and the prices here aren't justified. I wouldn't have come here if it weren't for friend who suggested it. Cheesecake Factory has quite a hype overseas but it's really no big deal.
Juliana T.,"Fremont, United States",157,483,46,4.0,23/8/2009,"I heart the Cheesecake Factory.  I know, I know, it's a chain.  For chains, this place is Tasty with a capital T.  Though, I must add their prices are high and their portions are HUGE!  Yippee for leftovers. I like that their menu is diverse to fit almost any palate.  I often go for the cobb salad (but being that my nickname was once ""Sally"" I always have my unique substitution requests to have my food made just the way I like it).  And, for those who know me well, I can hear you laughing at me. If you are a fan of the red velvet cake, try their red velvet cheesecake.  It will cause you to roll your eyes to the back of your head in joy."
Grant M.,"Santa Clara, United States",52,15,1,5.0,24/1/2013,I took my mother here for her 91st birthday.  Sarah was our server and was excellent.  Sarah worked real hard to make sure this was a wonderful birthday celebration.  Burgers were great and I left with Red Velvet Cheese cake.  I highly recommend this place.
Catherine W.,"San Jose, United States",109,46,,4.0,15/9/2012,"pricy a bit, not some place to go when on a bugit because honey let me tell you once you see the menu  , you will want to order   a lot more then you can eat just to try it all.  and i wont even get started on the list  for dessert. a wonderful place to go  have a meal  or even just a slice of creamy cake, friends family all by your self, this place is just right  and the staff are friendly too... valet parking everyday and a smile on your face from the time you walk in till leaving i cant think of a better place to chill out and get your  fix of cheesecake and Italian American classic food."
Harold L.,"San Francisco, United States",27,14,,2.0,19/1/2011,"Was welcome warmly by the ""above average"" service. It was my first time and I felt humble coming here and was expecting something nice to have for dinner. In the end, the food was bland and wasn't very good, the cheesecake definitely was their only highlight but the pasta i had wasn't worth the money. Nothing tasted fresh, I am certain most of the food here is prepared with frozen ingredients or pre-made somewhere else. Did some catering in the past and know ""frozen"" products when i see it. Their food is not on the same level as their service. Because of the high prices and below average food I need to give this place a 2 out of 5."
Catherine C.,"Oakland, United States",118,114,132,5.0,19/10/2012,"I went here 3 time last week. I hadn't been here in years. I came once recently with 2 friends. Asian lettuce tacos amazing, and spring rolls. Im so happy they have a skinnylicious menu! Came on 2 dates here and also loved my food. Salmon was so good. GREAT service. 3rd time I got lettuce tacos again, the sauces were awesome. LOVE THIS PLACE. Its so freezing in there though. AC was on bull blast past 9pm all three times. Slippery floor too for my high heels."
Christine D.,"Crockett, United States",116,304,132,4.0,19/6/2010,"Of all the California chains where the food and service never disappoints, it's the Cheese Cake Factory! Funny thing, cheese cake is not one of my favorites either! For those of  you that have never been there are some things you have to know: 1) No reservations accepted and anticipate wait times from 20-45 minutes. 2) The menu selection is huge! You have to flip through a spiral notebook with a lot of advertisements. However everything is yummy!  3) There is a huge selection of desserts which around $8 a slice. 4) Cakes and desserts are available to go and you can order entire cakes! These run anywhere from $25-55 a cake. It's all good! 5) Salads are huge! Portions are sizable - hope you're hungry! 6) Decor is nice and the bathrooms get a ""B"" rating I recommend ALL the salads (yes I've had them all) Avocado spring rolls appetizers - yum!"
Shaun L.,"Westerly, United States",29,421,,4.0,26/4/2010,"What's not to like about ""Cheesecake Factory?"" There is a TON of food to choose from, the service is typically very prompt and responsive, and the cheesecake is delicious! I'm a fan."
Rowena B.,"San Francisco, United States",42,59,6,4.0,9/7/2010,"I wouldn't normally review this but...There was no wait on a Saturday afternoon.  I was stunned.  Everytime I've gone to a Cheesecake (usually the one in SF) there is at least a 30 minute wait.   For this reason alone I give it 4 stars.   Oh, and It's at the Valley Fair mall...free parking!   I am a fan.  I like the food here.  So much so that (in SF) if I had to pay for parking and wait over 30 minutes to eat, no problem.  I'll be at the bar.   My faves are the Luau Salad and Bistro Shrimp Pasta."
Miss T.,"San Jose, United States",1,36,4,4.0,6/3/2012,"I came her after a bridal fitting at Davids Bridal down the street. the wait was 30 minutes. i hate waiting. but anyways, once my family sat down, we were immediately offered drinks from our server Robert or Roberto? the food i ordered wasnt great. i actually hated it. but after my meal, robert asked if everything was okay. i said the food was gross. and he offered to take it back and i got to order a new food item to take home! he had excellent customer service! he was more than happy to help me enjoy my dinner. (i didnt even know i could get new foods!)... also, i ordered a shirley temple. i asked for extra cherries and he was very kind to bring me a  whole bowl! if it werent for the bad food, i would have given this place a 5 star rating. but anyways... red velvet cheesecake is a must! and ask for robert as a server! he's awesome! :)"
Rhia R.,"South San Francisco, United States",256,600,483,4.0,15/2/2010,"I found it to be almost a miracle to seated in about five minutes for lunch on Valentine's Day. I noticed from the outside that there weren't too many people waiting around, so I (literally) ran ahead of the fambam to put down my name with the hostess.

I just can't seem to part from my usual, the Chicken Madeira. It never fails to disappoint me every time I order it. Sadly, I didn't have room left for dessert so I skipped out on getting the cheesecake. This location is still my fave to hit up. I probably won't have the same luck with the wait next time, but now I have an idea of what time to go."
