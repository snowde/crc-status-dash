Diane N.,"Fremont, United States",7,18,1,3.0,14/8/2010,"I give this place an average review, because I yet to try their cheesecakes! The service was friendly and quick on their feet, which me and my boyfriend would know the wait wouldn't be too long. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, it was decent but it needed more flavor. The only thing I really loved about the pasta is, the pasta tastes home made.  note: if ever wanting pasta, just stick to italian restaurants. As I said earlier, I've yet to try the desserts, but I will soon be coming back to give a second review."
Nhung T.,"Oakland, United States",208,773,,4.0,18/10/2009,"This place has a massive menu, from sandwiches to pastas. I love their guacamole eggrolls, one of the best out there. The firecracker roll is not too shabby as well. Ambiance is great, very nice and cozy. The wait can be long sometimes. Had the following: Louisiana Chicken Pasta: semi creamy sauce, very good  Pasta Da Vinci Pasta: on the creamy side, but good as well Overall, their pasta is pretty decent - portions are pretty big I love their chinese chicken salad - it's big...."
Lauren M.,"San Jose, United States",9,65,,4.0,18/9/2012,"So I've been to many locations and this one seems to stand out! It's huge and all of the servers, bartenders and hostess' are friendly and welcoming! I love the fact that they have the healthier plates and menus... Amazing!"
Lamya A.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,5,1.0,1/1/2014,"It was the worst lunch experience ever !!! When the waiter brought the senta fe salad, there was a hair inside it!! Disgusting !!! The waiter and manager apologized about it .. We had futitchini with chicken and sun dried tomato .. It was OK but at night my husband and I couldn't sleep because of diarrhea and vomiting !! I believe the food wasn't clean !! I've tried the same restuarant so many times in Boston .. It was the awsomest experience !! The food quality is much better .. And it is even unfair to compare!!"
Lisa A.,"San Jose, United States",150,10,,4.0,13/9/2012,I hate that they don't take reservations and their wait time can be pretty long but their service is always great and their food is delicious.
Marisa M.,"Chino Hills, United States",5,53,3,5.0,14/12/2009,"I know everyone dumps on this place because it's a chain, and in general most chains don't offer great food, but I happily make an exception for CF. I honestly have not had a bad plate from this place, and I have ordered everything from Asian to Italian to good ol' American, and haven't been disappointed. They give you wonderful free hot molasses bread which is a meal in itself ;-) I LOVE (in no particular order) the Vietnamese Summer rolls, Spicy meat Pizzas, Orange Chicken, The Navajo sandwich, grilled chicken and avocado sub, grilled cheese sandwich, Chicken burger sliders, Pasta da Vinci or Marinara. EXCELLENT French fries! I admit I have never tried their fish or steak stuff, since I am real particular as to how I like my seafood and steak. Oh and the cheesecake?? Get the Key Lime, with its light fruity taste, it is the perfect cap to your meal!"
Christine S.,"San Jose, United States",50,102,,3.0,18/10/2012,"One of my favorite things to do is go to happy hour at The Cheesecake Factory and eat hors devours and drink cocktails.  So we went for my birthday last night.  The service was great! The hors devours were excellent, and the cheese cake was mouth watering!  I took two stars off because their Mojitos were the worst Mojitos I had ever had!  The first one came and it was like drinking sugar water.  I asked the waiter  to remake it but not so sweet!  The bartender remade it and it tasted like they used gin instead of rum!   Don't even think of going to The Cheesecake Factory if you are on a diet.  The food is so good it is downright evil.  Their food comes in huge portions that are extremely high in calories, fat and salt!   My advice, forget the diet for one day, skip the mojito and order a different drink.  Do you think they could mess up a Margarita?  Don't forget to save room for dessert!"
Alice J.,"San Jose, United States",292,711,41,5.0,15/4/2012,"There are so many delicious items here. The spinach artichoke dip, luau salad, pesto pasta, burgers, and miso salmon are just a few of my go-to selections. Just the other day I tried the hibachi steak and it might be a permanent part of my regular rotation! It was perfectly cooked to medium rare, and it came with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. I've definitely had some misses here as well, but overall everything is usually really good and their free bread is the bomb! The majority of the time I'm too full for dessert, but when I have room I get the tirimisu cheesecake with the caramel royal macchiato."
Kyu L.,"Oakland, United States",614,395,714,3.0,19/4/2012,"this is the mecca of chain-store mall restaurants.  the shortcomings of the quality of food, is made up 10 fold in their overwhelming quantities and selection of food that they serve you there. that being said, as a mega chain-store restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory is indeed, a ""factory"" for their products.  it doesnt matter what location you go to, its gonna be the same.  consistent quality...fresh baked wheat loaf with a loaf of sourdough...its always the same.  the salads...the MEGAsalads...they are always like 4 lbs...no matter which location you go to...their appetizers...their entrees...even their new ""skinny menu"" for health conscious folk...all the same...always consistent, always good service...very solid. the only thing i dont like about this place is their lighting...too dark...i cant see my food...i know its there...i know theres alot of it...but i just cant use my sense of sight when eating it...i suppose this makes me use other senses to make up for not being able to see it, but still...more lighting at night please... other than that...what can you say...mega portions, good quality service, free bread and butter...oh...and CHEESECAKE...all 7,000 flavors of em...hella cheesecake!"
Jenny G.,"Milpitas, United States",21,117,13,3.0,10/6/2012,"This place is always crowded and there is always a 30min + wait so I just tend to head over to the bar/high top tables instead.  I love their pastas! If I want something ""healthy"" I'd get the Evelyn's favorite pasta. Their farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic is also very good. Their portions are generous so you do pay for what you get. Also, you can never go wrong with the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, but I would suggest not to force yourself to finish it all since the spiciness can get to you if you are a weak spice eater like me. :P  I have also gotten their crispy artichoke hearts under their small plates selections, it was just okay. Their vietnamese tacos were surprisingly delicious. Their buffalo wings with lots of blue cheese are really good because they are crispy and the meat is very soft. Their fried mac n cheese come in 4 balls, they're fried so of course, they are not good for your cholesterol levels. One bite into them, the creamy mac and cheese just melts in your mouth. Eating 2 balls is plenty because it does get filling.  Lastly, you can't forget their cheesecake. The ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake is OMG good! I always love to take this to-go because by the time I am done with my entree, I am stuffed so I won't get to enjoy the cheesecake.  Cheesecake Factory is one of the most unhealthiest restaurants, but oh so good. If you are trying to diet or on a diet, go elsewhere because you will not completely enjoy yourself  if you're not going to try their pastas/cheesecake!"
Pearl V.,"San Jose, United States",1246,993,3794,4.0,28/4/2009,"So I happen to like Cheesecake Factory, despite it's huge menu and dim lighting. Bite me. For apps, you can't go wrong w/ the calamari, avocado egg rolls, or crispy crab wontons.  If you like pasta, like me...  try out the Pasta da Vinci (comes in that Madeira wine sauce), Fettuccine w/ Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes, Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic, and if you're more into spicier pastas, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta or Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. I've heard wonderful things about the Steak Diane but have yet to order it since I am a creature of habit and love ordering a tried-and-true dish.  I think it all depends on what you like, but ALL the cheesecakes on the menu look DELISH. I don't think there's one you can order that wouldn't be good? Well that's my opinion. Take it as you will. I got a free appetizer and free cheesecake gift certificate after dining here last week, awesome... I will be back to redeem those.. FA SHO! =D"
J E.,"San Jose, United States",33,86,232,4.0,17/7/2008,"Again, I'd like to reiterate that I usually try to be a little harder on chain spots.. just because I feel like they lose a little charm & personality that smaller places may have. However, I'll never deny props to spots when I am able to walk away with a Happy Belly. Most anyone who has been to the CF is aware of the colossal portions. On this visit I was on a mission to have enough room in my belly left to have one of their notorious cheesecakes. Sooooo.... we had a couple appetizers instead (which are meals in itself). We had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Avocado Eggrolls, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake & Tropical Ice Tea. The  Lettuce wraps are good. The chicken is good but for me the 3 sauces make the wrap. The Avocado eggrolls w/sauce are an excellent combination of sweet & savory. The crispiness of the outside, creamy avocado and sweetness of the sauce... droool. As for the Chocolate Tuxedo.. I don't have words.. just try it ^_^ OVERALL: Chicken Lettuce Wraps w/ 3 sauces- Very Good Avocado Eggrolls- Excellent Chocolate Tuxedo Cream- AMAZING!!!!!!!!

Danny Q.,"Morgan Hill, United States",43,198,14,2.0,22/8/2009,"I gotta say reading all these reviews makes me think that cheesecake factory needs better marketing. Or maybe don't care as long as the volume of mass of people show up at their door.  I have been to a few Factories, and have the service was good, food was ok, and the feel of the place is just too big.  I came here for lunch yesterday and just wanted to get a pick up a togo order. The place looks like a airport who had a gaudy-minded 2nd rate decorator at the helm of the planning of this place (italy is rolling their eyes at this place).  Pick up my order, get home. I went their because my girl wanted the shrimp and bacon club, I had the chicken parmesan sandwich. Talk about bland, and steep in price. You would think that they would have some kind of lunch special, I mean 26 bucks seems steep just for 2 sandwiches ( which one I will not come back for). If they did have a special, they sure did not mention it me.  Next time suggests C Factory, I might balk at the idea. I will go, tolerate it, but I know there is much better places for my hard earned buck. New York Style pizza down the street sounds good now."
Susie N.,"San Francisco, United States",35,105,83,4.0,31/5/2010,"I remember thinking, ""WOW. THIS PLACE IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THE ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO!"" when I first came to this location. Every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory location, I always end up leaving feeling full. Even if you order from  the lunch specials! Their salads can feed like, 5 people! (well, I'm exaggerating, but if you were to eat one by yourself, you'd leave feeling pretty full). Something I always get when I come here is the avocado egg rolls. OHMYGOD. Those are absolutely mouthwatering. They have this semi unique taste to them but they're oh so good! *drool* For my main entree, I usually get pasta which is also really good. But for the real deal, aka, the cheesecake, I really like the banana cheesecake. It's so yummy! I actually like The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake better than New York's cheesecakes.

Sweetpea M.,"San Jose, United States",1,53,,2.0,2/2/2012,"Was here last week.  The wait for a table for two was an hour....geez.  They had 5 booths available and they told us that it was reserved... for whom?!?!?!?? THey made us wait an hour while 5 booths sat empty.  Geez!  Then the dinner.  meh.. I had the hamburger which was swimming in grease.  The fries were worse than burger king.  My main complaint that it was so dark in there.  I could barely see my friend opposite of me.  geez!!!!  Time to turn up the lights, folks!!!!  No desire to come back..."
Michael C.,"Milpitas, United States",118,180,11,5.0,15/4/2010,"I just went to the Factory for my fix.  I've been a fan since I had my first plate of fettucini pasta in cream sauce with sundried tomatos 14 years ago.  Yes, it was that good, hence the rare 5 stars.  Delicious memories still frolick playfully whenever I feel a bit drained by work.   Tonight, I went for the pre-dinner appetitizer drop-in.  We arrived at 6:30 and were immediately seated.  In fact, a hostess opened the door for us on our way in.  It's about the first time that's ever happened, very nice.  As others mentioned, do try to get a reservation for most nights or be prepared to wait.  With all the yelpers digging this place, expect long (1-3 hour) waits.  I ordered my absolute favorite, the avocado egg rolls with the sublime tamarind sauce.  Once in a while, when they get it just right, it's almost orgastic.  Unfortunately, tonight wasn't one of those nights.  But, it's still good.  My other favorite is the quesadilla with chicken.  It's so simple, but the melted cheese in the warm tortilla just goes down so nice with the guacamole, salsa, and sour cream toppings.    Overall, it was fantastic as usual.  The warm molasses bread always hits the spot.  I always feel warm and fuzzy afterwards, even if it's followed quickly by food-coma.  The portions are very decent considering their target clientele, who are usually size 12+ peeps and skinny, bottomless pit guys like me.  By little Asian girl standards, the plates are huge.  Even for me, I can only manage to handle two appetizers and a pasta plate.  I rarely make it to dessert unless I specifically went there for a night cap.   So, that was it for this stop.  My aim for the night was variety for my guests so we hopped on over to Thea Mediterranean to finish off the night.  I'll be back again soon enough and probably to hit the appetizers on happy hour."
Blanca S.,"Milpitas, United States",88,36,10,3.0,9/7/2010,"I had stop going to Cheesecake Factory due to poor service and after we mentioned it to manager we still received poor service? For a chain company you would think it be different, but unfortunately it was no difference.  I enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Salad, but the service was again, slow. I know its not your small venue, but they do need to improve on their service.  If you don't mind waiting, the food is good, but me prepared to wait for your drink and/or your food."
Ravi A.,"San Francisco, United States",17,192,8,2.0,15/8/2011,"I love CF's cheesecakes (Esp. apple streusel) and the turkey burgers. Those get 4 stars from me. I cannot wait for their new healthy option menu with lots of choices under 600 calories, including more healthy burgers! That said, this CF in particular gets 2 stars from me. It is last on my list oif enjoyable CF experiences. Really annoying sounds and loudness 24 7 it seems in this place. Always too crowded with too little seating. Parking is a royal pain. So if you are near Valley Fair and really really in the mood for CF, this place will do I suppose, but otherwise, too much pain for too little gain."

I ordered my absolute favorite, the avocado egg rolls with the sublime tamarind sauce.  Once in a while, when they get it just right, it's almost orgastic.  Unfortunately, tonight wasn't one of those nights.  But, it's still good.  My other favorite is the quesadilla with chicken.  It's so simple, but the melted cheese in the warm tortilla just goes down so nice with the guacamole, salsa, and sour cream toppings.    Overall, it was fantastic as usual.  The warm molasses bread always hits the spot.  I always feel warm and fuzzy afterwards, even if it's followed quickly by food-coma.  The portions are very decent considering their target clientele, who are usually size 12+ peeps and skinny, bottomless pit guys like me.  By little Asian girl standards, the plates are huge.  Even for me, I can only manage to handle two appetizers and a pasta plate.  I rarely make it to dessert unless I specifically went there for a night cap.   So, that was it for this stop.  My aim for the night was variety for my guests so we hopped on over to Thea Mediterranean to finish off the night.  I'll be back again soon enough and probably to hit the appetizers on happy hour."

For a chain company you would think it be different, but unfortunately it was no difference.  I enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Salad, but the service was again, slow. I know its not your small venue, but they do need to improve on their service.  If you don't mind waiting, the food is good, but me prepared to wait for your drink and/or your food."

I cannot wait for their new healthy option menu with lots of choices under 600 calories, including more healthy burgers! That said, this CF in particular gets 2 stars from me. It is last on my list oif enjoyable CF experiences. Really annoying sounds and loudness 24 7 it seems in this place. Always too crowded with too little seating. Parking is a royal pain. So if you are near Valley Fair and really really in the mood for CF, this place will do I suppose, but otherwise, too much pain for too little gain."
