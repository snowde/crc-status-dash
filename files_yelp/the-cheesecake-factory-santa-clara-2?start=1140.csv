Jackie L.,"Mountain View, United States",169,103,3,4.0,17/5/2012,This location has a welcoming layout and large waiting lobby. The high cushioned booth's my favorite place to sit. Came here for lunch with my mom and aunt right when the place opened so we didn't have to wait. I ordered the trio fish tacos and hot mocha drink. The tacos were generously loaded with condiments and tasty. I could only eat 2 tacos though before getting stuffed. Mom had the shrimp scampi with the tropical mango smoothie. The waitress was very attentive and everyone was super polite. Too bad we were all too full to try a slice of the cheesecakes!
Melissa H.,"San Jose, United States",9,51,16,5.0,8/8/2012,Went here for my birthday dinner and the waiter was extremely nice. He was quick with drinks and bread and came to check on us frequently which was surprising on a Saturday night since they get so busy. The food was great and the portions are huge so I find it easier to ask for half my plate in a to-go box before they even bring it out.
Gianna D.,"Milpitas, United States",311,259,3,4.0,16/5/2010,"Yes, this place is a chain. But I've come here many times and think the food is always good. I really have never been upset with the food or service. The only awful thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the nutrition! Almost everything here is a calorie bomb! I've started getting the Weight Management Chicken which is really good and about 500 calories. I wish they would have more healthy options here. That way I can always have some delicious Cheesecake without consuming a billion calories.  Also, the wait here is also extremely long on Friday or Saturday nights so either get here early or come during the week instead. Despite it being a chain, I will continue to eat here."
Michelle W.,"Santa Clara, United States",47,16,,5.0,18/3/2013,Why am I writing a review of The Cheesecake Factory for crying out loud? Probably because of Gilbert the bartender :) and I love cheesecake. Great service and fun  place to hang with my crew.
Bill S.,"Santa Clara, United States",1,8,,5.0,30/1/2013,"Love this place, the food is very good, service is acceptable, they are always busy so at times service i a bit slow, but if you consider that every time I come here, there are people waiting to be seated because they are packed to the gills, I understand that you have to some times wait for service. It's a busy place, lot's of employee's working running around taking care of customers,  What can I say, they do a great job and the food is very good"
faye m.,"San Jose, United States",4,3,7,3.0,16/10/2010,I never have like cheesecake. this my first time here. I had the banana cheesecake.   the whip cream was to die for. it was like home made not  some out of a can. I will be going back. don't get the smoothie no flavor more ice then any thing else
Sammy G.,"Campbell, United States",85,631,414,2.0,10/6/2012,"Not so pleased with the service or the quality of the food. They sat us down an hour later  instead of 30 minutes. The second glass of beer smelled like chemical which I made them change it.   The chicken in the chicken Alfredo with sun dried tomato was dry. Hard to chew thru. I'm just not so happy with the over all experience. I normally never give lower star to anyone but when I do , it means something."
Indie C.,"Sunnyvale, United States",3,76,1,4.0,28/8/2012,"I love this Cheescake Factory, The servers are friendly, food is great. They make their drinks well. They have a wide selection of food for everyone. Will be coming back here. And their Rye and Sourdough bread (complimentary) is SOOOO good!"
Evelyn R.,"San Jose, United States",130,210,20,4.0,12/7/2012,"I highly recommend this restaurant. They have a great variety of dishes and their meatloaf is delicious. I had the fried balls of macaroni and cheese and they were sooo heavenly, a must try. The service never fails to be good and their selection of cheesecake is great as well. I don't like cheesecake so I had a slice of their carrot cake, which tasted even better the day after. At times, parking can be a bit of a hassle in front but luckily they have a parking lot right next to them. The wait can be long, I waited for about 20 minutes on a Tuesday night just so I can sit at a booth."
Chris C.,"San Jose, United States",32,137,1,4.0,18/4/2010,"My friend and I came here for dinner tonight. I hadn't been to any Cheesecake Factory in a pretty long time, so I figured I was about due. I thought about trying something new, but decided on my usual Crispy Chicken Costoletta. I was happy with it, as I usually am. I'm not usually one to order dessert, but I was having a great time catching up with my friend, so we each decided to get a slice of cheesecake. I picked the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, which I hadn't had before. I wanted something light, and not overly sweet, so this turned out to be a good choice. Cool, creamy, and smooth. Mmm. This had to be one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to (at least better than the location at Oakridge Mall). Better lit, prompt service. Well, they were kinda slow in picking up our check, but I was enjoying time with my friend, so I didn't mind. Let's say I didn't feel rushed! All in all, I had a great time with my friend with some good food. Four stars for a great night. By the way, though, I was joking with my friend that every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory, without fail, I hear a plate break. This time was no exception. What's up with that?!"
Joon Y.,"Fremont, United States",1022,538,141,2.0,10/3/2009,"Cheesecake always manages to fail me whenever I come here with a big party. They always seem to mess up someones order. The service here is hit or miss. Sometimes, we'll get a awesome waiter/waitress or a troll server. It's never consistent.   The food here is over price for ""cuisine dishes"" that they do a mediocre job of cooking. Like the service the food is hit or miss. Thank goodness for salt, ketchup and other condiments.  The decor of the restaurant is pretty awesome but you pretty much eat in the dark if you come in the evening. You can't even tell what your food looks like!  Parking can be so so. Depending on the day/time of the week you come. Parking is especially a pain in the ass on the weekends or big shopping days as it shares the surrounding parking lot with Valley Fair.  For the folks who give this place more than a 3 stars; you guys are lemmings and I will de-friend you.  jk.=P"
Sarah L.,"San Jose, United States",22,8,,4.0,19/11/2010,"You MUST MUST MUST try the red velvet cheesecake here. Im usually not a huge fan of cheesecakes because it seems too rich, but this cheesecake is not too sweet and so creamy! I went with a group of 6 people and we ordered two pasta dishes (averaging around $15 a dish), an appetizer (calamari), and shared one slice of cheesecake (we were full but the cheesecake was a HUGE slice). When the check came, each person only had to pay 8-10 bucks which is very cheap.  Appetizer:  Calamari- crispy and came with two types of sauce. Good but the batter seems to fall apart a little bit. (Still recommended to get it) Entrees: Four cheese pasta and I believe the chipotle pasta: Pretty delicious, the first dish came out and the pasta was undercooked so we told the waiter and he made sure that they made us another dish right away. He also double checked on us when the dish came out a second time to make sure that it was up to par with our liking.  Dessert: The red velvet cheesecake: I was skeptical about this at first because many red velvet cakes that I've tried are dry, but this cheesecake is perfect. I think this is the best item the whole night ( I've still crave it now and then). All in all, good place to go to."
Amber R.,"San Jose, United States",36,37,4,4.0,25/9/2010,"Great Food!!  HUGE menu there is something for everyone. One of the few GOOD places in San Jose to sit and eat after 9pm. The young waiters and watiresses are nice and efficient. The drinks are always tasty. The major complaint from most people is the WAIT time! OMG its the worst. Even on weekdays the lobby is full and spilling out to the sidewalk.                                              GO TO THE BAR!!   You can walk right into the bar area and snag the first open table you see. If no table is avalible put your name in with the Host. Still  hang out next to the bar. Odds are:  a bar table will open up first. Once you are seated, just  return the pager and enjoy being seated an hour earlier. The  bar has same menu and same wait service, just not as spread out."
Jenny L.,"San Jose, United States",70,109,25,3.0,6/4/2010,"I come to this Cheesecake quite often compared to the other ones. It's cause it's closer to my house. This place is big and I get seated pretty fast if they aren't too busy. Since I usually come here with no more than 4 people. I usually get the ""Pasta Da Vinci"". It's my favorite. It was just recently, that the pasta tasted real salty. I should of said something, but I was so hungry that I didn't wanna wait.  This other time when I came with my manager and her friends. Our waiter was real nice! He gave us some coupons to use for a free slice of cheesecake. We were very delighted. I did try their red velvet. It's good, but the cream was a bit too sweet for me. This place can get very crowded at night since it's in the ValleyFair mall. Waiting might be really really long. They don't take reservations for big groups on weekends. I was sadden since I was gonna have my birthday dinner here."
Jenny L.,"Millbrae, United States",157,960,682,3.0,17/8/2005,"The franchise that lets you get together for meals, snacks, and/or desserts in between shopping at Valley Fair Mall.  Start off with avocado rolls, firecracker salmon rolls, and crisy crab wontons.  When you have an appetite, stuff yourself with the bistro shrimp pasta, chicken madeira, or their famous factory meatloaf, which is a colossal mound of food.   Don't forget to save room for a wide selection of desserts and cheesecakes.  For something light, try the tiramisu.  If you have a big sweet tooth, taste the heavenly Godiva chocolate cheesecake."
Shanna K.,"Campbell, United States",399,921,1986,3.0,8/4/2006,"Constantly packed, totally ridiculas portions and yes it's a chain but I gotta say.. it's one of the few places open late and with a wide enough variety on the menu to satisify just about anyone, so I end up here fairly regularly.   They also have a full bar, and that's important.  The strawberry martini's are top notch.   The Ravenswood Zin is very drinkable and they make a good gin martini.  I have never gone here during peak hours.  I wouldn't with so many other great places to choose from... but for later nights it can't be beat.   For the health conscious, like me, the salmon salad, turkey burger (replace fries with a salad) and spring rolls are always a good choice.   Also the grilled fish with a side of vegetables is good.   The staff here has always been very willing to make a substitute or leave something off in order to health it up a little.   Edited to add a couple gripes that I noticed last nght:   1.  Why is it always so damn cold in here?  Does cranking up the AC make people eat more?   Even if I have a long sleeved shirt on I freeze in this place.     2.  Why is the floor always SO damn slippery?  I've nearly slipped and broken my neck twice and last night I was just wearing Converse and I was still sliding around.  What gives?  Get a mop or something.

Danster L.,"Orange County, United States",1683,730,2280,3.0,8/2/2007,"This particular location, way too crowded, not for a date and why wait 2 hours and you end up taking some of your food home? Buffalo blasts are very good here while the pizza is so not cool. Super thin and not even crispy! The bread and cheesecake are good but for a nice romantic dinner, go to the Union Square location. CF's jambalaya is decent and is raved about but real jambalaya is better coming from the south. Head to Atlanta or Louisiana for some jambalaya but only go to CF for their appetizers. Vietnamese spring rolls??? Try Brodard in Orange County where everyone raves about their spring rolls which I will try out soon! =)"
Andrew C.,"San Jose, United States",64,61,,3.0,2/8/2012,"Horribly slow service for 9:30pm I thought. Not particularly attentive nor any real effort made. Mind you I'm comparing this to other Cheesecake Factories and I still find this place subpar. Nothing horrible to say about the food. Cajun pasta? Sure why not! Spicy yet creamy, chicken was better prepared than my friend's blackened chicken over rice. More shrimp than I expected too! Had an email for half price cheesecake but strawberries were too sour. Should have gone to Yard House instead"

Jenny A.,"San Jose, United States",119,245,247,3.0,28/2/2011,"This place kills me!! The service is soo slow!! The restaurant is too big that it takes forever for your server to come 1) take your order 2) ask how youre doing 3) bring your bill 4) bring BACK your bill. Came here on a Thursday afternoon, you would expect no one, but it was packed! They said they could seat us immediately and we followed the hostess. When we got within 100 feet of our table, the hostess stopped, did a 180 turn and told us to stand there and wait for our table to be cleaned. and ""THERE"" was right in the middle of COMPLETE CHAOS.  We stood there for at least 5 minutes just waiting. Ridiculous. Finally got seated and our waiter was terrible. He took forever to come take our order. All we got was cheesecake and that took at least 20 minutes!! When we came he mixed up the order. How hard is it even to DO THAT FOR 3 PEOPLE. God... I also hate this place because they try to specialize in way too many things. Is it Asian, American, Mexican, Italian?!?!?! What the hell is it!?!?! It takes you 15 minutes to just get through the menu. fdughdfigsret Only thing that gets 3 stars is the cheesecake. I love the red velvet and the banana fosters is delish as well.
