Catherine C.,"Fremont, United States",255,106,25,4.0,29/3/2010,"I came here today with my parents and at the end of the meal I was stuffed!! Even on a Monday it was busy! We came here today because we wanted to use our free slice of cheesecake and gift card  that we had received as a gift from Christmas. When we arrived, we only had to wait 5 minutes before being seated. When the menu was handed to us, I was already overwhelmed. There are so many options to choose from! My all time favorite is the Pasta Da Vinci. My parents and I decided on the Pasta Da Vinci and the Chicken Bellagio. We shared these two entrees because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish 3 entrees. The Pasta da Vinci was very delicious. I love the sauce that they use! The Chicken Bellagio was breaded chicken with angel hair pasta. The chicken was good, but the pasta was drenched in olive oil! As we were working our way through these entrees, there were still left overs! We were getting full but had to save room for dessert. We decided on the Tiramisu cheesecake and the Dulce de Leche cheesecake. The tiramisu was very coffeish, but was still good. I thought the Dulce de Leche was going to be sweet since it had caramel in it, but it wasn't. The candied walnuts in the whip cream went very well with it. I was so full but I kept wanting to eat more of it!  The service was pretty good until the restaurant became busier. We had a female server who was pretty quick about things until she had to go on her break. We got this male server and he was no where in sight when we needed him. But overall, the food was good and the service was good."
marian c.,"San Jose, United States",14,45,14,4.0,28/7/2012,I really enjoyed my meal there.  The service was excellent and the food was hot and on time.  The thing to remember is that it get crowded and that means waiting out side the restaurant.   The portions are large enough where there is not room for the cheesecake.  I had a enjoyable evening.
Oliver F.,"San Jose, United States",54,47,55,4.0,24/6/2011,"When the waiter asked, ""would there be anything else?"", I said ""my dignity"" and cried a little. He gave me a free cheesecake."
Dianna P.,"Hayward, United States",0,34,,3.0,1/11/2010,"Good service, clean & cute restaurant, good bread, good appetizers & of course, good dessert. Best appetizer = Dynamite shrimp, perfectly crispy tempura shrimp with a yummy ""dynamite dipping sauce"". Only big problem is their food(like their actual entrees). I have yet to be really amazed by their food! I mean, I wouldn't say their food is gross... but I wouldn't say it's yummy either. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - Not as spicy as it sounds. Actually it's pretty plain.  Four Cheese Pasta - Too cheesy but not the good kind of cheesy in my definition&I usually love cheesiness! Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - Nothing too special. It's actually kind of plain except for the little fried tortilla strip things on top. That was the best part. Mmmmm. Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried tomatos - Meh! I expected a little bit more creaminess (the description does say garlic, cream, etc!). But it was nothing close to it. In fact, it tasted like really really oily noodles is all. Oily to the point of oil dripping off each fork-full. Yum? Even the chicken of was tasteless. Okay, I will say this one was pretty gross. Some kind of chicken thing - Overcooked & dry but I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes & vegetables that came with it! :) I've decided that if I ever come back, I will stick to getting just appetizers & desserts."
Carrie S.,"San Jose, United States",123,35,,5.0,10/9/2011,"I don't normally go to this particular one, all the Cheesecake Factories are the same. I went here for a late dinner and server was great to us. The cheesecake was delicious. When we left, I realized I have left my cellphone on the booth we sat at and the moment I called to ask if my phone was there, they said it was. I told them I would come the next day (it was already closed at the time) to pick it up. Thank goodness no one took it and the hostess was able to keep it in a safe place."
Cindy W.,"Burlingame, United States",307,707,47,4.0,31/1/2010,"There's nothing like stepping through the heavy double doors and into its marble lobby and being greeted by the glistening rounds of cheesecake in the glass lit case. You know you've arrived. If nothing else, Cheesecake Factory makes the waiting area at least spacious enough. Our party of 8 loitered for almost an hour before our pager finally buzzed. I suppose there was no way around it. Thursday night, 7p, what are the chances of being seated immediately. Nevertheless, we happily trudged to our table. We devoured the brown bread loaf and quickly asked for more. For dinner, I was torn between trying a new dish or one of my old favorites - like the Jambalaya or Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp - I went for a new entree  this time - the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta ($12.95). Chicken, asparagus bits with red and yellow Peppers, the pasta dish was colorful. The spicy chipotle parmesan cream sauce wasn't actually very spicy. Could have been kicked up a notch. As usual though, the portion was gia-normous and I had plenty to take home for round 2 the following day. For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake ($6-ish). It tastes just like how it sounds - rich deep chocolate. And of course finished with a cloud of light airy whipped cream. Great for sharing. For the price, portion, and space, you really can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory."
Jamie R.,"Asheville, United States",47,58,11,1.0,22/7/2012,"Ive tried This place four times, at two different locations. 3 out of 4 times I got horrible food poisoning. The time I didn't, the friend I went with had food poisoning. Disappointing because at the time of eating it, it was really good..."
Timothy P.,"San Jose, United States",7,48,5,3.0,21/3/2010,"Just have to get over the fact that the portions are huge.  Most dinners are twice as much as I eat.  Eat half, then take home the rest.  Desserts are even bigger -- relax and take home. On the plus side, service is a little better than most.  The food is reasonably decent.  Some dishes are sweeter than I like.  However, there is lots to choose from. Favourites: corn cakes, fried macaroni balls, chicken and biscuits. Negatives: the noise.  Get a booth if you can.  Also lots of Birthdays with extremely annoying flash photography."
Yuyu Z.,"San Jose, United States",63,22,10,4.0,10/6/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory, probably one of my favorite restaurant. The food is super yummy. I recommend Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Picata, and as appetizer the Buffalo blast. Their food is a bit pricey but the portion is well worth the price. I always attempt to save room for cheesecake as dessert but it never happens. I think they have great waitress and waiters every now and then you get one that's not great but usually I love my waiter/waitress. One of my favorite sides to get there as not yummy as it sounds is a side of fries with ranch. They have THEEE best fries and THEEE best ranch. And trust me, I've eaten a lot of different fries and ranch before. Their complementary bread is also super yum! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's ALWAYS busy. Sometime the wait is not that long but sometime you could be waiting for HOURS. Sometimes they accept reservations sometimes they don't. The restaurant itself is beautiful, take a moment to take in the setting. Then look up around the ceiling and pillars its actually really pretty. The lighting is pretty darn romantic at night, I'd say it's a great place to have a nice romantic dinner. What more can I say? I love cheesecake factory!"
Bernard L.,"San Jose, United States",567,178,27,4.0,5/9/2010,"I love this place. It's one of those restaurants that I never get tired of. The menu has over 150 items to choose from, which has a lot of variety. The food is good and the dessert is simply awesome. The service of the staff is excellent and I haven't encountered one bad server yet. The only downside is that it's really busy during dinner especially from Thursday-Sunday so be prepared to wait a while if you come during peak hours. But at least the waiting area is fairly big so you're not bumping shoulders with anybody during your wait."
Terry H.,"San Jose, United States",1102,655,15,3.0,31/1/2009,"Have you ever had a headache that sits right behind your eyes so that you even smell things differently along with a strange inability to hear and see the TV like you are used to doing... a nosee'-sinusee' pressure with radiating ache to the point where you aren't sure if you are coming down with a cold or flu or something worse? A tiring uncomfortableness that seeks to drive you to bed way too early so that you can't watch any of the daily shows you have TIVO'd. No? Then neither have I.  Really, here's the review. Time to get serious and use my vocabulary that education has afforded me the ability to complete somewhat rationally. Maybe it's because I just broke my Atkins diet with a huge Alps-sized mountain of garlic mashed potatoes and my body wasn't used to it after 30 days. Or because I ordered my usual decaff coffee and ended up drinking 3 or 4 cups. Or because the crashing din inside of The Cheesecake Factory was so loud that I could barely hear what the people next to me were saying. Me thinks it was a combination of the three. The bottom line is that it is aspirin time which isn't a good sign for the Factory getting 5 stars from me. We came here for a birthday party, 11 awesome, sweet, diverse and hungry people. But in looking over the menu I felt like I was reading a textbook for an upcoming university Chemistry course with ads inside. Never have I been to a restaurant that had so many different choices, I said to my next-to companion that if I chose a different item everyday I wouldn't be able to go through from front to back in 4 months. Several of the party had eaten at the Cheesecake before so they warned me off of the appetizers, bread and the pre-salad. I listened and was glad that I did as the meal unfolded. My entree, after much mental anguish in making a proper decision, was the salisbury steak. Why? Because I haven't had that in ages and I frankly was missing it. When my plate arrived, I was stunned by the massiveness of the offering. Tons of crisp green beans warmed slightly with an essence of lemon-vinegar dressing. Crunchy to the tooth and full of flavor. Personally, it is really hard to mess up green beans if you remember to just barely cook them. I love eating them raw in the bag straight from the grocery store... naturally full of vitamins, minerals and sugar.  Then I sampled their garlic mashed potatoes, in first looking at it, I knew it was going to be like scaling the Matterhorn. They were creamy with pureed mixed with small chunks of red skin and garlic bite, not overpowering garlic but subtle and elegant. It is refreshing to be served real mashed potatoes, not powdered or premade but like you make them at home. So far, so good. I'm kind of wierd when I eat. If I really like something I tend to keep on eating that part of the meal before I move on to the rest. It's not something that I like doing and other people have commented on it but it's a habit none the less. Guess I have to try and break that one.  On to the salisbury steak. It was brown and juicy and covered with onions and gravy just like a salisbury steak should be but this is where the meal began to fall apart due to the fact that it didn't have much flavor. When I ordered it, I was under the mistaken impression that mushrooms would be involved in a mighty way but they seem to have instead run off to the hills, nowhere to be found. Now for me salisbury steak and mushrooms go together like pancakes and maple syrup, peanut butter and jelly, pizza and pepperoni, Cabernet Sauvignon and pork chops, the beach and sunglasses. Unfortunately, my finale fell flat. I didn't even finish it. As for the birthday girl, she ordered a wonderful chicken dish that included a half-chicken, some delicious looking carrots and a bigger dollop of potatoes than even I had. She was totally happy and even took what she couldn't finish home in a big, black box. It was her day, so I'm glad she chose the right thing for her. She also ordered an amazing smelling vanilla cheesecake covered with a festive mound of whipped cream and curlie-cue chocolate syrup that tied the plate all together. I even took a picture of it, my first picture ever of food too. Unfortunately, it was awfully dark by the time it arrived so it came out poorly. Next time, I'll use a flash and post it for you all to see. Would I be back? Well, it was awfully expensive even though they wouldn't let me pay for anything and it was so noisy that if you ever went here on a date or business meeting, you wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of the conversation, just a lot of blank nods and teethy smiles. The food was good but not remarkable, a little above average I guess if I want to be nice and I always want to be nice. But if someone else wanted to go here, I would say ""Yes"" just to make them happy because I like to have happy dates. Me! Meh!"
Nirmiti M.,"Sunnyvale, United States",3,26,1,4.0,15/4/2014,One of the best Cheescakes that I have eaten in a long time! Their Ultimate Red Velvet cake is superb (you might not want to eat it all by yourself!). Louisiana chicken pasta is delicious and they even willingly customize it as per my requirements.
Salina M.,"Campbell, United States",8,38,34,4.0,2/9/2009,"I eat here quite often and I have to say that even though I am not really a fan of corporate giant restaurants taking over and pushing out the little mom and pop shops, I love this place! I tend to eat really early or really late...9:30pm or later and it is nice that they are open so late. I like being able to stroll in to a restaurant at 10 at night and not have to feel rushed through your meal cuz the place is closing. The menu has a lot to choose from so here are my findings: Miso Salmon - excellent! salmon is never overcooked and the flavors are wonderful, I order mash potatoes instead of rice Kobe Beef Burger - yummy! if you like mushroom, ask for extra mushroom as the burger does not ""come with"" too many on there Baked Potato soup - eh not such a fan, sent this one back Bang Bang Chicken - DO NOT ORDER THIS unless you are ok with receiving a plate of food that is absolutely covered in dried coconut! Don't get me wrong I love coconut but in moderation. Mini Pizzettes: love the margerita and the mushroom one, portion is perfect, crust has great flavor and are not smothered in cheese. I like my pizza with only a little cheese so that I can still taste the crust Small Plate Stuffed Mushrooms: these are good every once in a while, the sauce is a little sweet for me sometimes Eggs Blackstone: sooooo good. This is on the Sunday Brunch menu, it is basically eggs benedict but with poached egg, mushrooms, bacon, spinach and hollandaise on english muffin.  Beware of other items on the breakfast menu - Ordered a couple of other breakfast omelette items and they were both terrible!! Fried Calamari: This is the best I have had yet! the breading is seasoned well and the calamari is moist and not rubbery Favorite Cheescakes: Banana and Tirimissu Drink: I always order the passion iced tea, it has great flavor and doesnt even really need sugar =) One last thing - ALWAYS ASK FOR A BOOTH, trust me it is worth the extra five minute wait. Tables are placed so closed together that if you are an average size person, you need to turn sideways  just to sit down (I'm so not kidding...) and its impossible to have a conversation without the people sitting next to you hearing everything you say."
Stacie V.,"San Jose, United States",21,132,,4.0,17/3/2010,"Came here again last night, and realized I'm probably the last person on earth who hasn't reviewed this place... I have always been happy with my food here.  And let's be real?  Who doesn't love the giant slabs of cheesecake? My all-time favorite dessert... So, we decided to split the edamame appetizer and it was GOOD!  Really great seasonings and they were steamed just right... We also decided to split the entree since we were hungry, but not starving and planning to walk around Santana Row after we were done eating and didn't want to carry our food around with us.  We split the steak dianne/herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes.  It was the perfect amount of food for us to share.  I ordered the steak medium and it came out just the way I like it with yummy mushrooms and onions on top.  The salmon was really good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce that it was resting on.  Luckily I took the extra plate so I didn't have any of it on there. The service was great as usual, and my black iced tea was just what I wanted:) We were too full for dessert, but my husband was stoked that they now have a pineapple upside down cheesecake and I was excited about the red velvet one, neither of them are on the menu...next time!"
Hula R.,"San Diego, United States",1124,291,60,4.0,26/5/2009,"IT MAY PUT THICKNESS ON YOUR HIPS, BUT OH BOY IS IT HEAVEN ON YOUR LIPS...  Have you tried the 50th Anniversary cheesecake? Think about 2 pieces of brownie with 2 slices of Cheesecake mixed in there! You might call it fatness on a plate, but I call it my personal heaven!  I was up in San Jose visiting my cousin and I said that we should try something VERY San Jose. A food item I could never get in San Diego and he said, ""What about Cheesecake Factory? It's across the street and should be easy to get in!"" I laughed and said, ""OK!""  I am so glad he said that cause I would have never had the deliciousness that is the 50th Anniversary Cheesecake! So RUN don't walk and have this piece of heaven! You will not be upset!  (And oh yeah, it's really nice in the San Jose Cheesecake Factory! Pretty typical of a Cheesecake Factory! It's all busy as get out but for sure is clean!)"
Tushar K.,"San Francisco, United States",86,166,4,3.0,3/6/2010,"I think both the desserts and the standard entrees are pretty good. But overall I don't know that it is worth the wait and the price. The desserts are more of an experience than the entrees, so maybe just go there for dessert and have dinner elsewhere. Expected bill: $15."
Carmen M.,"Sunnyvale, United States",23,51,7,4.0,21/3/2011,My friend and I went to The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Sunday. The place was packed and we thought we might have to wait. Since it was only the two of us we waited for 15 minutes. We were quickly seated to a nice table.  A waiter named Renee asked us for drinks in a timely manner. I had the Portabella Mushroom burger with no cheese (vegan here) and my friend had the pull apart pork sandwich.  My burger was delicious but my friend's pork had alot of fat in it (pork?) The service was great and the restaurant was well organized. I would go back in a minute.  I would also want Renee for dessert next time!  Hmmmm! Did I say that?
Joe C.,"San Jose, United States",359,243,6,5.0,25/3/2009,"CF is by far the best chain restaurant out there. Large portions, huge selection, decent prices, nice ambiance... Only negative is the wait at peak hours Favorites: Avocado egg rolls (MUST EAT)! Jambalaya (It's a dry Jambalaya) Chicken Madeira Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Rib Eye (Ridiculously good)"
Stine H.,"San Francisco, United States",201,478,198,4.0,3/8/2009,"As a franchise, I consider cheesecake factory quite satisfactory.  They have a vast menu of all kinds of food to choose from. And of course, being called ""cheesecake"" factory, they do offer a diverse menu of cheesecakes. Being a large american franchise restaurant though, you can expect to wait quite a bit to be seated. BUT if you come in late enough there wouldn't be much of a wait anymore... I especially like their little appetizer menu which isn't too shabby. There are a few different things to choose from there and the price ain't to bad for a nice little serving. Their fried zuchini is pretty tasty. Anyhow, I don't consider the prices too bad, and the portions are good. You'll probably be saving a lot of money by picking a few things and sharing it with another person. Afterall, these portions are meant for one person alone...obsesity! Oh, my favorite cheesecake is their fresh banana cream. YUM-O."
Joe P.,"Rocklin, United States",141,434,73,3.0,24/12/2011,Food is tasty and probably microwaved. Definitely over priced. Cheesecake is flat out the best. Red velvet cheesecake. Awesome.

It's not something that I like doing and other people have commented on it but it's a habit none the less. Guess I have to try and break that one.  On to the salisbury steak. It was brown and juicy and covered with onions and gravy just like a salisbury steak should be but this is where the meal began to fall apart due to the fact that it didn't have much flavor. When I ordered it, I was under the mistaken impression that mushrooms would be involved in a mighty way but they seem to have instead run off to the hills, nowhere to be found. Now for me salisbury steak and mushrooms go together like pancakes and maple syrup, peanut butter and jelly, pizza and pepperoni, Cabernet Sauvignon and pork chops, the beach and sunglasses. Unfortunately, my finale fell flat. I didn't even finish it. As for the birthday girl, she ordered a wonderful chicken dish that included a half-chicken, some delicious looking carrots and a bigger dollop of potatoes than even I had. She was totally happy and even took what she couldn't finish home in a big, black box. It was her day, so I'm glad she chose the right thing for her. She also ordered an amazing smelling vanilla cheesecake covered with a festive mound of whipped cream and curlie-cue chocolate syrup that tied the plate all together. I even took a picture of it, my first picture ever of food too. Unfortunately, it was awfully dark by the time it arrived so it came out poorly. Next time, I'll use a flash and post it for you all to see. Would I be back? Well, it was awfully expensive even though they wouldn't let me pay for anything and it was so noisy that if you ever went here on a date or business meeting, you wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of the conversation, just a lot of blank nods and teethy smiles. The food was good but not remarkable, a little above average I guess if I want to be nice and I always want to be nice. But if someone else wanted to go here, I would say ""Yes"" just to make them happy because I like to have happy dates. Me! Meh!"
Nirmiti M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,26,1,4.0,4/15/2014,One of the best Cheescakes that I have eaten in a long time! Their Ultimate Red Velvet cake is superb (you might not want to eat it all by yourself!). Louisiana chicken pasta is delicious and they even willingly customize it as per my requirements.
Salina M.,"Campbell, CA",8,38,34,4.0,9/2/2009,"I eat here quite often and I have to say that even though I am not really a fan of corporate giant restaurants taking over and pushing out the little mom and pop shops, I love this place! I tend to eat really early or really late...9:30pm or later and it is nice that they are open so late. I like being able to stroll in to a restaurant at 10 at night and not have to feel rushed through your meal cuz the place is closing. The menu has a lot to choose from so here are my findings: Miso Salmon - excellent! salmon is never overcooked and the flavors are wonderful, I order mash potatoes instead of rice Kobe Beef Burger - yummy! if you like mushroom, ask for extra mushroom as the burger does not ""come with"" too many on there Baked Potato soup - eh not such a fan, sent this one back Bang Bang Chicken - DO NOT ORDER THIS unless you are ok with receiving a plate of food that is absolutely covered in dried coconut! Don't get me wrong I love coconut but in moderation. Mini Pizzettes: love the margerita and the mushroom one, portion is perfect, crust has great flavor and are not smothered in cheese. I like my pizza with only a little cheese so that I can still taste the crust Small Plate Stuffed Mushrooms: these are good every once in a while, the sauce is a little sweet for me sometimes Eggs Blackstone: sooooo good. This is on the Sunday Brunch menu, it is basically eggs benedict but with poached egg, mushrooms, bacon, spinach and hollandaise on english muffin.  Beware of other items on the breakfast menu - Ordered a couple of other breakfast omelette items and they were both terrible!! Fried Calamari: This is the best I have had yet! the breading is seasoned well and the calamari is moist and not rubbery Favorite Cheescakes: Banana and Tirimissu Drink: I always order the passion iced tea, it has great flavor and doesnt even really need sugar =) One last thing - ALWAYS ASK FOR A BOOTH, trust me it is worth the extra five minute wait. Tables are placed so closed together that if you are an average size person, you need to turn sideways  just to sit down (I'm so not kidding...) and its impossible to have a conversation without the people sitting next to you hearing everything you say."
Stacie V.,"San Jose, CA",21,132,,4.0,3/17/2010,"Came here again last night, and realized I'm probably the last person on earth who hasn't reviewed this place... I have always been happy with my food here.  And let's be real?  Who doesn't love the giant slabs of cheesecake? My all-time favorite dessert... So, we decided to split the edamame appetizer and it was GOOD!  Really great seasonings and they were steamed just right... We also decided to split the entree since we were hungry, but not starving and planning to walk around Santana Row after we were done eating and didn't want to carry our food around with us.  We split the steak dianne/herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes.  It was the perfect amount of food for us to share.  I ordered the steak medium and it came out just the way I like it with yummy mushrooms and onions on top.  The salmon was really good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce that it was resting on.  Luckily I took the extra plate so I didn't have any of it on there. The service was great as usual, and my black iced tea was just what I wanted:) We were too full for dessert, but my husband was stoked that they now have a pineapple upside down cheesecake and I was excited about the red velvet one, neither of them are on the menu...next time!"
Hula R.,"San Diego, CA",1124,291,60,4.0,5/26/2009,"IT MAY PUT THICKNESS ON YOUR HIPS, BUT OH BOY IS IT HEAVEN ON YOUR LIPS...  Have you tried the 50th Anniversary cheesecake? Think about 2 pieces of brownie with 2 slices of Cheesecake mixed in there! You might call it fatness on a plate, but I call it my personal heaven!  I was up in San Jose visiting my cousin and I said that we should try something VERY San Jose. A food item I could never get in San Diego and he said, ""What about Cheesecake Factory? It's across the street and should be easy to get in!"" I laughed and said, ""OK!""  I am so glad he said that cause I would have never had the deliciousness that is the 50th Anniversary Cheesecake! So RUN don't walk and have this piece of heaven! You will not be upset!  (And oh yeah, it's really nice in the San Jose Cheesecake Factory! Pretty typical of a Cheesecake Factory! It's all busy as get out but for sure is clean!)"
Tushar K.,"San Francisco, CA",86,166,4,3.0,6/3/2010,"I think both the desserts and the standard entrees are pretty good. But overall I don't know that it is worth the wait and the price. The desserts are more of an experience than the entrees, so maybe just go there for dessert and have dinner elsewhere. Expected bill: $15."
Carmen M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",23,51,7,4.0,3/21/2011,My friend and I went to The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Sunday. The place was packed and we thought we might have to wait. Since it was only the two of us we waited for 15 minutes. We were quickly seated to a nice table.  A waiter named Renee asked us for drinks in a timely manner. I had the Portabella Mushroom burger with no cheese (vegan here) and my friend had the pull apart pork sandwich.  My burger was delicious but my friend's pork had alot of fat in it (pork?) The service was great and the restaurant was well organized. I would go back in a minute.  I would also want Renee for dessert next time!  Hmmmm! Did I say that?
Joe C.,"San Jose, CA",359,243,6,5.0,3/25/2009,"CF is by far the best chain restaurant out there. Large portions, huge selection, decent prices, nice ambiance... Only negative is the wait at peak hours Favorites: Avocado egg rolls (MUST EAT)! Jambalaya (It's a dry Jambalaya) Chicken Madeira Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Rib Eye (Ridiculously good)"
Stine H.,"San Francisco, CA",201,478,198,4.0,8/3/2009,"As a franchise, I consider cheesecake factory quite satisfactory.  They have a vast menu of all kinds of food to choose from. And of course, being called ""cheesecake"" factory, they do offer a diverse menu of cheesecakes. Being a large american franchise restaurant though, you can expect to wait quite a bit to be seated. BUT if you come in late enough there wouldn't be much of a wait anymore... I especially like their little appetizer menu which isn't too shabby. There are a few different things to choose from there and the price ain't to bad for a nice little serving. Their fried zuchini is pretty tasty. Anyhow, I don't consider the prices too bad, and the portions are good. You'll probably be saving a lot of money by picking a few things and sharing it with another person. Afterall, these portions are meant for one person alone...obsesity! Oh, my favorite cheesecake is their fresh banana cream. YUM-O."
Joe P.,"Rocklin, CA",141,434,73,3.0,12/24/2011,Food is tasty and probably microwaved. Definitely over priced. Cheesecake is flat out the best. Red velvet cheesecake. Awesome.
