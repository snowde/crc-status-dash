Archie G.,"San Jose, United States",1116,1026,42,2.0,9/1/2009,"Going to the restroom at this location is so dangerous. You have walk through this kitchen area that is super slippery. I always feel as I am going to fall. I keep expecting to fall on my ass, but it never happens. But I keep expecting it. I wonder if that means anything? Anyway, how can a restaurant with a menu several pages long that has approximately 239 food choices, have so little to offer? The food here is always uninspired. While the food is disappointing, the prices make it even worse. I have friends you who keep dragging me here, so I keep trying different things on the menu. In the end, I feel as if I they are taking stuff out of a freezer, warming it up, and putting it up on my plate. The servers annoy me as well. Every single time I order something, they have to remark how that is a good choice and how delicious that particular entree is. And then it comes out and I am forcing myself to swallow. So yeah, I do not appreciate liars. Nor do I appreciate this restaurant. Or it's crappy cheesecake.  Skip it and find a real restaurant with some sincerity, culture, and most importantly, flavor."
Michael S.,"San Jose, United States",661,71,129,3.0,14/3/2009,"We've all done TCF before, had our cheesecake, eating it, taking the leftovers home in banker's boxes.  This just in though! The Chessecake Factory (at least the one on Steven's Creek) has introduced a new ""tapas style"" menu and taken all of the advertisements out of the regular menu. No more accidentally ordering  Dr. Scott Hyver's new DVD ""Exploring Laser Vision Correction"" for dinner.  Now its just a regular menu with the food they serve, crazy! I loved the fried corn fritters!"
Emmieann d.,"San Jose, United States",1,9,,1.0,2/9/2009,"So, I went with my boyfriends family for mothers day one year...and my god was it horrid. Seriously, I could understand it being busy, but the food was most def. not great.  First off, they took a long time to decide to feed us, and quiet a few workers were just standing around. Then, when we got our food the plates were all warm, but the food was COLD! wtf? Yes, thanks for the hot plate and the unapitizing cold waffles, it litterally took about thee times for us to get our food as warm as the plate bleck, i doubt I'm ever going again, at least not at this location....I'd rather go to a dennys"
Jackeline A.,"San Jose, United States",135,20,,5.0,1/5/2012,"I'm addicted to their skinnylicious menu and small plates! More specifically their White Bean Hummus, stuffed mushrooms and White Chicken Chili! Almost everything here is good and the cheesecakes are delicious. I really like their sugar free Low Carb Cheesecake. It's not as heavy or sweet but still has a great taste to it. It's something that I treat myself to every now and then :)"
Marissa F.,"San Jose, United States",57,93,6,3.0,6/1/2009,"Several months ago, my mom and sister came to stay with me for the weekend. We worked up quite an appetite after meandering around Valley Fair and I thought it would be nice to treat them to a descent meal before their trek back to the Central Valley. And it was perfect because my brother came to join our mall excursion and we'd all be able to dine together. I suggested The Cheesecake Factory since they'd never been there before and because my mom is a cheesecake lover. We were seated promptly and arrived just in time to take advantage of the lunch portion options. We ordered 2 lunch portions of pasta with shrimp and 2 cheeseburgers. When our dishes arrived, we were given 3 pasta dishes and 1 cheeseburger...... Me: Excuse me, we ordered 2 cheeseburgers and 2 pasta dishes. Server: Uh, no you ordered 3 pasta dishes. That's why I asked you if you wanted a lunch portion. Me: (Looking around at my family in confusion) Didn't you hear me order a burger? Mom: Yeah. Sister: (Being such a sweetheart) It's okay, I'll just have the pasta. And the server never apologized or offered to fix the error. Instead of being too proud and/or lazy, she should have insisted on correcting her mistake. I was pissed. Two days passed and I was still pissed. I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager, explaining what had happened. She apologized for our server's behavior, said that's not how their staff is trained and that never should have happened. She took my address and sent me a $50 gift card, bumping my 2 star rating up to 3 stars."
Nicole C.,"San Francisco, United States",261,60,74,4.0,25/4/2010,"I also have love this place not only for their cheesecake but also for dinner. I like going here with friends, since there are so many choices that are pretty good (never a disappointment) They start by bring some bread which is pretty good when its warm. This place as big portions so the downside to this is when you take up the left over and heat it up... all the oil comes back out (at least for the pastas)  They have a variety of cheesecake. Depending on what you  like . The last time I went I had the red velvet.  I must say this is to die for.  I love it more than those red velvet cupcakes. Its not too sweet its just right. If you want to eat here I suggest to get there before the rush hr (usually a little after 7) If you get there late the wait can be 30min to an hr long."
Mary S.,"San Jose, United States",4,20,5,1.0,3/9/2012,"I used to love this place now I hate it. I would always get the Luau Salad and it was amazing until now, the dressing tastes too vinegary and lacks the yum plum flavor. And, they had more mangos and red peppers b4, now it tastes like something I couldve made better myself, seriously. They are no good, even the seafood pasta dish I ordered was messed up, they forgot the sauce! WHAT! It was scrimp scampi and I told them about it and the manager said its bcuz I ordered the Factory Combo... STILL IT SHOULDN'T BE SHORT OF FLAVOR!!! Really tho!"
Anita C.,Hong Kong,192,377,734,5.0,17/11/2009,"Came here for lunch. Had the gumbo. so. so. so. gooooood. Even better than the jambalaya. It was saucy and came with chicken, sausage, and shrimp. And the saucy goodness was excellent. Also, the chicken was moist, shrimp were plump, and sausage added good flavor. Also, a friend's sandwich took a long time to come, and when it came, we realized the chicken was not fully cooked. Later the waiter came back and apologized and said the manager would be over to talk to us. Manager was right on his heels and apologized. Then later on the manager came back to bring the order. They also comped the sandwich. Great customer service points there. What more can you ask for? Fantabulous food. Wonderful Service. Nothing else. Marvelous way to end the day for 5 ladies hungry enough to eat the tablecloth if the food wasn't good."
Bobby D.,"Milpitas, United States",0,75,,3.0,17/3/2011,"This places gets a resounding  ""Meh.""  Initially I was happy to see that the waiter was a fellow homo, because lawd knows homos make the BEST waiters, but I was truly disappointed with little Ms. White Pants.  He seemed bothered to be serving us, but maybe that was just the infamous gay attitude that these youngsters have these days.  The food was decent but certainly not worth the average price of $19 a plate.  I'd go again if i wasn't treating."
Graydon M.,"El Dorado Hills, United States",86,192,30,2.0,8/1/2012,"Your typical high end chain with unimaginative food.  Its good if you need to grab a quick bite but nothing special to ""write home about."""
Glenn H.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,2,,1.0,22/5/2014,"I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken, and my wife the Chicken Bellagio. In a word, more salt than the Pacific. Despite the reputation, we couldn't stomach dessert."
marcia k.,"Saratoga, United States",2,42,7,4.0,29/3/2014,Delicious meal there tonight and got two slices of cheesecake to go....one plain cheesecake with cherries and the other key lime.....got home to find that I was given mango lime cheesecake!! Uugghh!! I was sooo disappointed! I knew I should have checked my bag before leaving!
Lynn W.,"Chandler, United States",355,399,,3.0,28/11/2008,"I have been to this location a few times.  I had decent service and the food was ok.  Nothing totally memorable but ok.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.  It's crazy!!  If this is all it takes, I should open a restaurant.   And the cheesecake is nothing off the hook.  I did have an oreo cheesecake that was pretty good.  There seem to be so many of these chair types of restaurants out there these days.  I would rather go to a mom and pop place and have a so so meal than go to a chain and have a so so meal.   So overall........meh.  Would I come here again.  Maybe but only if it were when they were not super busy."
A K.,"San Jose, United States",89,53,19,2.0,15/2/2011,"I've always had a good experience with them, but on the last visit the waiter suggested the Jambalaya Pasta with extra spice. We took the suggestion and the food was so spicy to the point it was not edible. She didn't even offer to replace the dish for us, since that's what I wanted. I left disappointed, and would probably not come here again since the waiters apparently do not have any discretion to replace the dishes if it was not done right."
Natalie C.,"Cupertino, United States",299,8,3,2.0,13/1/2011,"Went here with my friend for a late dinner on Wednesday night. Normally cheesecake factory is our first choice for late night food for nights that we work late because of the super-friendly service. This was the first time they really disappointed us. We sat down in the bar area and after about fifteen minutes a server walks up and says ""Oh, well here is one menu, I'll go get one more."" He had a strangely rude, monotonous kind of voice. He came back after a couple minutes with another menu and said something about specials and soup, but I couldn't make out one word to the next he was speaking so quickly. Oh, well! He sort of hovered by the bar looking in our direction for a while and then skipped over to our table and said, ""Oh yeah, did you guys want something to drink? Maybe water or something?"" Um, hi. BAR AREA. Normally at cheesecake factory we're asked every five minutes or so if we want another drink. Gotta make money somehow, I suppose.  We went through with our order and a really sweet girl brought it out. She was probably the highlight of our night. She was super friendly and made it seem like she actually wanted to get us what we wanted. We weren't sure when we'd see our server again so we asked her for extra everything!  My friend got the tex mex eggrolls, which I liked but he thought they were pretty average. We'll stick to cheap chili's over those. The worst part though, I got the ""nachos with spicy chicken"" spicy? No. Flavor? No. Temperature? Right out of the fridge. Along with the rest of the nachos.. I've had nachos all over the place, but not once have I been served cold chicken on cold chips with unmelted cheese. Weird. So I ate around the edges until we caught sight of our server maybe five minutes later. I don't think I was rude to him, I just asked if they could heat it up a little because everything was still cold. He told me ""I'm so sorry about that, don't worry I'll get it fixed and take it off of your check."" Welp. I wasn't expecting to get it free, just warm at least. ANOTHER ten minutes go by and he brings out a new plate of nachos and says that he had them make a whole new plate for me. Unnecessary, but nice. Would've been nicer if half the chips weren't burned to black. Don't mess with people making your food is the lesson I've learned. To top it all off, the check came out and I was charged twice for the nachos and one of them was comp'ed off. I called him over and asked why there was a second charge and he mumbled back that he had to put it in the computer twice and charge me twice. After he had told me I wouldn't have to pay for them, I was a little confused, but he made himself sparse until he came back to pick up the signed receipt.  Disappointing to say the least for cheesecake factory. Moral of the story? If you get stuck at Joshua's table, run!"
Mariah G.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,9/6/2012,WORST service Ive ever had here!!!!!!! We were seated and literally waited 20 minutes before WE had to finally ASK someone to take our order! This was seriously some bs and the manager was informed of our long wait and didn't even come over to apologize or offer a discount! Horrible costumer service! Not eating there again!
Kai G.,"San Jose, United States",46,193,44,1.0,24/11/2008,"If you are into overpriced ""American"" food, this is where you'd want to be. I don't get why there are always lines here. Maybe it's cuz of the Valley fair affect. I'm sorry but I am not going to pay 7 bucks for a slice of cheesecake. Their entrees generally cost 15-20, and still leaves me hungry"
Lyv D.,"Honolulu, United States",113,86,35,3.0,30/7/2009,"This review is based SOLELY on the new red velvet cheesecake that made its debut today.  I've tried several of the cheesecakes, my usual being the low carb cheesecake with strawberries, but today our server convinced us to try the new red velvet. I mean it is National Cheesecake day after all. Might as well try it right? This flavor was not that bad. It was rich like the godiva or bland. In reality, its right in the middle. I was actually a bit surprised. I was expecting some sort of richness that made my teeth hurt, but not with this cheesecake!  I don't usually order dessert but today and today only the all of the cheesecake was half off so it was a good excuse to try dessert."
Wesley H.,"Sunnyvale, United States",52,152,2,4.0,3/8/2009,"Yesterday was the first time I had ever been to the Santa Clara location. I had only been to the Oakridge location before but even that was a long time ago. My friends and I came here yesterday before we went to see a movie at Century 22 just a few blocks away. I ordered the Tons of Fun Burger... not the healthiest thing of course, but it sounded good to me. The waiter who helped us, Joe, was great. He had a good sense of humor and the dinner experience was never made uncomfortable. My burger was the last item to come to the table and he told me, ""It is called the Tons of Fun Burger because for your friends it is a ton of fun to see how you manage to eat it.""  The burger itself was pretty good, it didn't blow away the competition or anything. What made the experience great was definitely the service and the people I enjoyed my meal with.  When we were finished eating, Joe asked one of the girls at our table if she wanted her mustard to go. (because she had explained how important it was to have mustard at the beginning of the meal.) She sarcastically said, ""No, just pack up the lettuce and butter for me.""  I said, ""I bet you he will."" Sure enough, he did. Awesome."
jenn w.,"San Jose, United States",142,745,541,4.0,22/9/2009,"I stopped by here for lunch with a few co-workers on a busy lunch day, and it was great that we were able to call for a reservation before we arrived.  We were seated within 3 minutes of our arrival which was great.  We told them that we had to have a quick lunch and get back to work and they were super accommodating.  I got one of the hamburgers and it was very good and super big.  I was only able to polish off half the burger and had to take it to go.  However, in the lunch rush, the waitress forgot to bring out my take out box and I did not realize that until I was half way out the door.  I was super disappointed that I was missing out on the other half of my tasty burger."
