Alex A.,"Santa Clara, CA",231,1,,1.0,10/10/2017,"When it comes to Doordash, The Cheesecake Factory is really slow with their orders. When they receive orders, you hear dinging noises, alerting the employees that someone from Doordash will be picking up the order for the customer. If the app tells us that the order should be ready by a certain time, why don't the employees get to work ASAP so the Dasher can just go in and out quickly. When the employees lag and the order is not being made, the Dasher has to wait alot longer than they should and the customer gets frusterated and it affects the Dashers' rating in the long run."
J B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",12,399,38,3.0,8/3/2017,The place is still nice and the fish and chips are great. Theo only problem was the service is still slow and the place has very limited air conditioning. It is best to return when they have full A.C.
Yifei W.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,13,41,3.0,8/19/2017,The cheese is the way too much? I feel too ni after that...But the salad is great and the hamburger looks nice... The environment is very traditional and the people there are at very age..Nice place for family.
Victor G.,"Hayward, CA",73,92,52,2.0,12/19/2016,"I've waited awhile for my food at the Cheesecake Factory and odds are, you have too if you've ever come here. But never have I ever waited 45+ minutes to for my food. A new personal record was set and it was probably the worst day for that record to be set. What grinded my gears the most was that our server was off doing her front of the house duties (polishing cups, cleaning silverware, etc.) and was was RIGHT BEHIND US. Never checked on our food. Never checked up on us. Thank god her manager was more aware of our situation or else I'm sure our food would've taken longer and this review would be negative stars. To conclude, the food here is pretty damn good but you have to be able to take the risk of hangriness and potential starvation if you want to get it."
Michael B.,"Los Gatos, CA",6,19,1,1.0,9/6/2017,"We just ordered $300 .00 worth of food at this location. We asked twice for butter and utensils. We work just down the street. When we called the manager, her response was first blame us. She said, you have to ask for utensils on to go orders ""we did twice"" instead of a sorry. The food  was cold as well over cooked. We will take our hard earn money to somebody who cares."
JoAnn Y.,"Cupertino, CA",94,285,17,4.0,7/5/2017,"Their skinnylicious menu is very comprehensive and a lighter fare option for a lot of tasty and great options. The restaurant is located in the front of Valley Fair Mall, which is a fracking war zone right now because they're adding a Bloomingdale's and a movie theater. I was with someone who had premium parking abilities, they also have valet--anything short of these options leaves this as a ""long haul for a short slide"" in terms of the payoff for the parking hell. That aside, the food is consistently good quality and the service is very linen-napkin like in a casual atmosphere."
Tim M.,"Campbell, CA",2,8,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Stay away. 2.5 hrs wait. First it was 2 hrs, after an hour it was 40 mins. They could not get their stories straight. 1.5 hrs to get food. The two orders disappeared, (taken to other tables). They were stretching the dough to remake my daughters cheese pizza, which never showed. So,  she was given mac and cheese which she only ate half as it was not what she wanted. The other was a fried catfish dinner which they brought out as everyone else had finished. Took it home and it was soggy by the time we got there. They comped the Catfish and the Pizza. This after we requested the manager who stood with his back to us 10 feet away from our table talking and laughing with who we thought was another table, turned out to be other waiters at the waite station. I actually yelled his name, Yo Justin, which got him to turn around only to continue his conversation. Poor service the food has gone down hill. portion size has been reduced. This was a Wednesday night. Never to return."
Faaro M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Horrible management in this location or based on what we were told, being hand-tied by the corporate. My friend took me there last night for my birthday and we needed to get a quick bite and go to another engagement but there was a long line so we decided to sit at the bar area. After a long wait a table was opening up and we asked them to give us the table when they leave. Long story short, we lost 2 tables to 2 men who felt it was ok to bully us, insult us and take the tables we had waited for. We talked with 2 managers, and our waiter but all we got was we're sorry! Either they need to implement a better process e.g. reservations or give their managers enough authority (if they haven't) to take care of the customers in cases like this, otherwise they are only encouraging bullying."
Ferdinand M.,"San Jose, CA",3,15,17,5.0,10/20/2017,"Im always a fan of Cheesecake Factory, foods are delicious, servers are very nice and good ambiance. But be forewarned, waiting are long during weekends and holidays. Otherwise, you cant go wrong with the restaurant."
Mary Q.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,1,1.0,8/18/2017,"They burnt my food, but I didn't have another 35 minutes to wait for another plate. No discount was offered."
Evonne L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",137,499,,3.0,6/16/2017,"Very accommodating of a baby shower lunch that we threw for a coworker here. We had a party of ~10 people. We had space for games, gifts, and a diaper cake. Food came out quickly and the service was attentive. I would recommend calling the day before your event to remind them of the reservation though. Some of the staff were confused when we first arrived ahead of time to decorate. Luckily the manager let us! Good times."
Ashley M.,"Schenectady, NY",1,56,42,4.0,6/5/2017,I met up with a few friends for lunch here. The waiter was fine no complaints there. My strawberry daiquiri was a little too sour for my liking but as always I enjoyed the pumpernickel bread and the fish and chips was good as well.
Chaz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,13,1,2.0,5/30/2017,We went to the this location for my birthday dinner. I mentioned that it was my birthday and the waiter acknowledged. When ordering our food we asked if our food could come out with the appetizers and not to wait for the appetizers to come out and then do the food he must have forgot that because our food came out a while after the appetizers were finished. The waiter was a little forgetful. When my wife entree came which was salmon with broccoli the broccoli had yellow flowers on it and there was brown spots also. We asked to see the manager and Jason came. He tried to explain that the broccoli was just fine and I showed him and told him that the the broccoli had brown spots he told me no it's yellow and I said no sir it is not yellow it's over right and it has lost a lot of it nutrients. He offered to go back to the kitchen and have some new broccoli made up that was more presentable when it came out it was overcooked and it still had brown spots on it. He also told me that they accepted the order of overripe broccoli.  The next issue which is a little more disconcerting is that during my meal I had fruit flies flying around our booth first there was just one and then by the end of the meal there was 4 of them flying around the window and then there was a dead one on the windowsill. Kind of makes you wonder how clean the restaurant is when they have fruit flies flying around. Oh and to top it all off they forgot my birthday oh well at least my hamburger was okay and my son like this spaghetti but we will probably not be visiting that location again because of the fruit flies and the lack of compassion from the manager Jason 5/31 Corporate called me and they were very nice apologetic.
Christina N.,"San Jose, CA",275,187,299,2.0,12/3/2016,"O Cheesecake Factory, I used to love you and your amazing food with great portions. With my most recent visit, I'll have to part ways with you. Service took forever, I couldn't even flag anyone because there was no one to flag down.  My complimentary bread was cooled down from being out for sometime. The entrees itself, was just so sad. My steak Diane and herb crusted salmon combo was bland and warm. Not even hot. My sister's shrimp scampi was bland and wimpy looking. The Cajun pasta was bland, not enough sauce and warm. Only the Luau salad was good considering there wasn't much work put into the salad.  I definitely won't be coming back or I will go to S different location."
Ruben G.,"Salinas, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/17/2017,Been here for dinner a few times & food and service are always on point ordered the New York steak with mash and veggies & was delicious ended it with a slice of strawberry cheese definitely recommend this place .
Heather F.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,204,435,5.0,3/19/2016,"It was very very nice, #e just wanted some dessert and a drink. We came and ordered a drink and some cheesecake; very quick on taking our order. I really needed that drink after shopping."
Astou T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",13,39,52,4.0,4/10/2017,"I went there for my birthday and the food was really good. However, they make you wait such a long time for that. It was a Friday so that was a busy day. Unless the wait, everything was great."
Jyoti K.,"South San Francisco, CA",23,34,12,5.0,7/28/2017,"Loved the food. Tried pasta, cauliflower were amazing. On top of everything was there cappuccino."
Rosemary W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,14,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Yesterday afternoon, I decided to treat myself to a dessert take out.  I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory for sometime, but always loved their food and desserts and always remembered a great time there. Well sadly I was reintroduced to very bad customer service. As I ordered my take out, and by the way I was the only one there, no other customers, I paid. She gave me my change then turned to another customer who had just walked in and started to serve her. I asked was she getting my order and she said for me to wait. !!!! Then she proceeded to help this other person and hadn't finished my order. Looked like she was going to help the next person who had next walked in!!! Another person appeared behind the counter...who as it was turned out to be ""one of the managers"" . All the time I was waiting this Fatima seemed oblivious of me waiting. I was really upset at the lack of customer care, when I pointed this out to both of them it was met with denial....just crazy. The ""Manager"" had told me that there were customers and I had to wait my turn....I told him I was the first in line. You know its very pathetic that a simple order cannot be fulfilled. I know that there are awful things happening all around us, but I certainly didn't expect a ""treat"" to turn into such a most unhappy experience. As I left they both sarcastically said have a great afternoon I shall not be returning I shall never return to this place"
Tamim S.,"San Jose, CA",24,12,2,5.0,8/28/2017,"The lemon cake I got was good. The waitress at my table was Alexis. She did an awesome job. She was super attentive, fast and very friendly. Will come next time with my family."
