Charlotte L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,14,,4.0,11/9/2012,"The cheesecake factory is the ONLY chain restaurant I go to- and this one did not disappoint. This place is huge and I didn't have to wait- granted it was Sunday brunch at 11am in the morning, but i love just waltzing right in to get seated! Their huevos rancheros were yummy and next time I want to try their chilaquiles!!! Hubby had the crab hash which was ok. We topped it off with a strawberry cheesecake...soo soo good...the highlight of the meal. I couldn;t eat for 24 hours"
Cindy K.,"Sunnyvale, United States",194,179,2,3.0,30/3/2009,"I came here a couple nights ago at 10:00 for some late night munchies and hangout time with my boyfriend and his parents.  I haven't been to this cheesecake in a while b/c we usually take a look at the # of people packed into the waiting area and decide against it.   Service was great once we were seated, really fast and really attentive.  So that's a big plus especially since there are so many tables to be served.  But there are a couple of negatives about it here.  First, this MAY be a plus for some people, but I don't like that there's 250+ items (that's what the waiter said!) on the menu.  It literally boggles my mind.  I change what I want every 10 seconds, and it really annoys me. hahaha.  I'm the type that needs a more narrow and tailored menu.  Second, there's always a long wait!! We came at 10:00 and still had to wait 20 min to be seated.   Other than that, the food is always pretty good.  My boyfriend and I usually get a fatty appetizer and a salad and share, and there are still usually leftovers since the servings are so large.  This past time we went we had calamari, the factory chopped salad, and the thai chicken lettuce wraps.  Calamari was really good!  I like both the dipping sauces and the calamari was not overly breaded and fried like it can be at many places.  The thai chicken wraps are also really good - and they're great if you're trying not to eat carbs.  The chopped salad was okay.  I'm a huge salad person (that's what I usually get for my entree) and this one wasn't spectacular, but wasn't horrible either.  I think the best part was the apple bits mixed in which add a little extra tang/sweetness to the salad."
Catherine L.,"San Jose, United States",133,168,8,1.0,17/11/2010,"NEGATIVE STARS stopped by here after a long day of work and got some food to go -- had a manageable order of an appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 cheesecakes --- i was excited to try the chicken mimosas since they sounded so appetizing on the menu but alas when I got home i discovered they had forgotten to include it in my bag --- i called them and it took forever for them to pick up the phone and it took forever for the manager to come to the phone --- when i say forever, I mean FOREVER -- i was almost done with my chicken madeira by the time she got to the phone ---- now it was just a small appetizer, but it's the principle of the whole thing - i went there HUNGRY and left unsatisfied so i wanted my money back --- once the manager finally got to the phone the whole transaction was painless and I hung up the phone feeling satisfied --- cc bill comes and i find that not only did they NOT give me my money back for the forgotten appetizer, but they ALSO charged me 56 dollars!  they did do a return transaction for the 56 dollars but still!   do you not know how to do a return transaction for one item on an order? boo to you --- i do not appreciate my card being wrongly charged and my original complaint wasn't even remedied!!!!! i will not be coming back here anytime soon."
bernita w.,"Santa Clara, United States",5,51,,4.0,24/5/2012,Who doesnt love this place... Its so close so I always want to go here! I love the service and wait staff they are always so nice and friendly. I always get the same thing and it always taste better everytime its like i never had it before.. I also like going just for drinks and appitizers..the bartenders are amazing! I will always come to this place when I need something to eat with friends or family...It does get rather busy on friday and sturday nights but the wait is worth it
AJ I.,"Aledo, United States",0,39,1,4.0,18/8/2012,We enjoy eatinf at the Cheesecake Factory. This is the location I frequent the most. I was disappointed in my last meal there. I had the SalIsbury Chopped Steak.  I should have gone with my first choice MEATLOAF. Mashed potatoes are delicious and the green beans fixed just like I like. I had the perfect lemon drop martini with grey goose vodka.Delicious!! WILL RETURN AGAIN
Lily L.,"San Leandro, United States",147,48,251,4.0,4/3/2009,"Dined: 21-Feb-09 Summary: Good pasta, good drinks, great cheesecakes! hehe This will be a different review than my 7/25/2008 review of the Pleasanton Cheesecake Factory. Took a friend here for her b-day. For 2, not too long of a wait for a Saturday night - 35 mins (yes I consider this short since I have been told up to 3-4 hours a few times) For dinner my friend had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - good vegetarian pasta with all the what I call must have pasta goodies including broccoli, artichoke, basil, garlic and pine nuts. She took the leftovers home and her kids gobbled it all up! Must have been good if kids approve! I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Yummy! I do not normally order shrimp dishes, but my friend wanted to try it. Good shrimp (and amount of shrimp), and more good pasta goodies - mushrooms, arugula (nice touch) and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. For drinks, my friend had the Strawberry Lemonade - good and not too tart or sweet. I had the Frozen Iced Mango - reminds me of the one raspberry swirl drink from the Elephant Bar. Yum! Onto the good stuff: dessert! My friend was thinking we order one cheesecake and share... sha! As if! I ordered 3 desserts for the 2 of us! That's what to-go boxes were made for! Greedy people like me! ; ) Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake - not bad, could have been better. No distinct flavors came out of it... The 30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE was awesome! Very simple - layers of original cheesecake and chocolate fudge cake with chocolate cream. Sooo good! And to change it up from all the chocolate, I got the dessert I tried and liked the last time I was here: The Lemoncello Cream Torte. Yum! I will be back! =D"
Brandon C.,"Santa Clara, United States",194,76,46,3.0,30/12/2011,"Dissapointed......I ordered the catfish special a couple days ago, and the choices that the chef had put into the dish just were absolutely foul, one part of the dish was more stronger than the other pieces of the dish put together....The dish just did not mix with graceful harmony....maybe cause it was in the refrigerator along with its other counterparts like the bland mashed potatoes that they dropped on the plate with the dish....*P.S. The red velvet cheese cake isn't that good either.........shame...what a shame......"
Jackee K.,"San Jose, United States",165,383,3,2.0,7/7/2011,"Usually a pretty long wait here, but if you come at odd hours, you won't have to wait too long.  The service is kind of slow too.  One big thing...I recently had ankle surgery and am on crutches.  I was totally unable to get into the restaurant on my own.  I couldn't find any of those automatic door opener buttons, and the doors are super heavy.  Luckily, some very nice gentlemen (not employees) opened the door for me."
Jim H.,"Castro Valley, United States",165,121,10,4.0,28/4/2010,"One thing good about cheesecake factory is that it has lots of varieties, thus feeds the need of most people.  The salad plates here are huge, and the flaked steak is tender and flavorful.  (might just be teriyaki sauce but it still tastes good)  I also loved the avocado egg roll and the bellini. Compared to all the over priced restaurants across the street at santana row, cheesecake factory is much better alternative especially for your wallet. However, i am not super impressed with the cheesecake, they put too much whip cream on it and its too sweet.  Its called cheesecake factory, its suppose to have awesome cheesecake! Oh yeah, and the wait here is only half an hour on average as oppose to the SF one, where it average 2 hours there.  Then again, the Corte Matea one never had any wait."
Evelyn N.,"Milpitas, United States",350,390,70,3.0,22/3/2009,"I hate how this place is always packed. I hate waiting. I love their original cheesecake with fresh strawberries on top (: I love their Thai Lettuce Wraps, Chicken Madeira, and Pasta Da Vinci. I think the sauce for the Madeira and Da Vinci are the same. My boyfriend likes to get the Farfalle and I think that's pretty good too."
Sarah F.,"Hayward, United States",47,131,95,5.0,27/10/2011,best HAPPY HOUR spot! i usually go here with friends after a hard day's work.. strong long islands $5 incredible selections of cheap happy hour appetizers. so close to Santana Row...great to walk those calories off!!
Vince S.,"Seattle, United States",101,303,18,4.0,11/1/2009,"Ask for Kim D. As in fellow yelper, Kim D. He's the fiercest server to hit you.  And he always gets down and dirrty.  No, but seriously he always gives great service.   And the service he gives at the cheesecake is OK, too. Anyway, they really need to do something about that floor.  People probably thought I was completely PLASTERED as I held onto everything on my way to the bathroom to avoid from eating shit on the way to the bathroom. What's up with all these uninspired food reviews?  Shit, it's still bomb food.  The thai lettuce wraps? MmMmmm... And the chicken salad sandwich rocks my world each time..."
Amy V.,"Oakland, United States",195,175,60,1.0,13/9/2010,"So came here for a friends birthday, we had something like 28 people...we had reservations for 6pm we arrived at 6pm and got seated at 9:20....nuff said...I could understand if we didn't have reservations -  but we did. Me and my girlfriend didn't order anything and we didn't stay till the end, but I heard all of the horrible stores about over charged and rude service. Good thing I dont live anywhere near here."
P C.,"Santa Clara, United States",3,175,,2.0,5/12/2009,"I am going to go two, because the food is not consistent. One visit it is good (given it is a chain), and the next visit it is disappointing.  Two recent beefs:  1) SOMEBODY LEARN TO MAKE A COSMO IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHARGE $12. 2) DO NOT SERVE LUKEWARM SOUP. Is that too much to ask? In the plus column: open late, big menu, fun atmosphere service pretty good.  If the kitchen and bar managers kick it up a notch, we could go to 4 stars. Factory, get consistent! I want to love you!"
Johnny D.,"San Jose, United States",103,29,3,4.0,16/2/2011,"Food is always good at Cheesecake Factory.  I tried the eggplant sandwich with fries.  Huge portion and pretty tasty, but I think I would've enjoyed the mushroom sandwich better.  I'll try that next time.  I really like their pastas too.  The only problem with this place is the long waits on the weekends.  Service isn't bad for the most part.  Oh and I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but their cheesecake is super tasty!"
Silvia Q.,"San Jose, United States",3,25,,2.0,6/1/2014,The wait is tortuous and if you throw a fit you get a seat first. Yes I've seen grown adults do this. But where else am I going to get the best eggs Benedict in the world from ?
Brian C.,"San Jose, United States",2,143,1,2.0,11/12/2010,"Long wait, even when we arrived early. Not a fan of the seating arrangement here as I can very clearly hear the conversations of the tables adjacent to me. Our main entrees were very disappointing.  The sauce on the Spicy Crispy Beef was waaay too sweet.  Furthermore, the dish was neither spicy nor crispy.  When we told the waiter, he said there's something wrong with my wife's taste buds.  WTF. Also, our waiter disappeared for 15 minutes when we wanted to call him down for the check. My Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms was surprisingly unspectacular.  I had a huge plate of bow-tie pasta left over and I'm the type that usually finishes my food. Oh, by the way, they were really skimpy on the liquor for my wife's cocktail.  For $8.50, come on guys! The highlight of my meal was my Fat Tire Amber Ale.  At nearly $70 out the door for two people (with drinks), I'd rather take my business some place else. i.e. Claim Jumper in Fremont"
Kristine D.,"Union City, United States",33,44,4,4.0,10/4/2009,"I always order the same thing - chicken piccata with extra sauce - so delicious! The staff and bartenders are great, they know how to handle a lot of customers. The drinks are really good and strong. The cheesecake is yummy buy I usually just take a bite off someone else's, too much for me. One downside is price but the portions are huge for most things. A dinner plate of pasta can feed two. Also, lots of people around dinner time.  Oh, they do have a lunch menu - lots of the popular items in a smaller portion for cheaper - which is a great deal."
JoeJet J.,"Los Altos, United States",379,298,595,4.0,12/8/2012,Younger and hipper crowd than our preferred location in Palo Alto.   Same otherwise though.
jason g.,"San Francisco, United States",862,711,104,3.0,16/8/2008,I usually don't like yelping franchise type restaurants but since I'm sorta on a mini vacation........sure.  Did you know most of the restaurants close at midnight on Santana Row?  So I have to give Cheesecake Factory an extra star for closing at 1230.  Food is as good as it gets for a franchise. Sliders......................................3 stars Popcorn shrimp......................4 stars Chicken pot stickers...............2 stars spinach and artichoke dip....3 stars chicken tortilla roll..................3 stars service was good but then again we were the only ones left in the restaurant.
