Linda C.,"San Francisco, United States",288,496,2513,4.0,31/8/2009,"Despite the long waits and gigantic menu that tries to please every palette on earth rather than concentrating and making a smaller portion of their food taste better, I still like cheesecake factory. The cheesecakes are still delicious!!! - Brown Oat Bread: love it! sooo good! - Salsbury Steak: too much spicing, felt like i was eating salt & pepper, but it was good, not enough onions, mashed potatoes were really good - Red Velvet Cheesecake: delicious! not too sweet, good balance of cheesecake and velvet cake"
T. C.,"Santa Clara, United States",38,269,6,3.0,21/1/2014,"Food mediocre.  Cheesecake way too sweet.  Great place for fun lively get together.  Come for the ambiance, not for the food."
Ronny T.,"Modesto, United States",54,7,,2.0,5/4/2011,"The 2 star rating is reflected on the service at this certain location since this is a food chain.  Other than that OVERALL the food chain itself would've gotten more than 5 stars. I've had some bad experiences as far as service at restaurants, but by far this one was the worse.  My co-workers had taken me here as a going away get together for drinks and appetizers, our waitress was a complete...well you know. She never once asked us how our drinks or appetizers were.  Every time she came to our table she always glared at us as if we were a waste of her time.  And by the end of the night, she didn't ask us if we even wanted dessert, she just came over to hand us the check (which is the most ANNOYING thing ever at ANY restaurant). Other than that, I will break it down on whats good and what I usually order. -Their bread is served free and fresh (most of the time lol) whenever you are dining in.  My fav. is their multi-grain, it's got a hint of sweetness to it which goes well with butter (and I LOVE butter). -Viet. Shrimp Summer Rolls, now I rarely order appz. at TCF mainly because their entrees are pretty big servings (which is rare to find in an upscale restaurant).  I was not a fan of these ""summer rolls"" because A. I've had better and B. To me the asparagus in this just doesn't belong in there,  It's just kinda there... - Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp:  if you want the other tables starring at this when it arrives, then definitely order it.  I love presentation, and I love curry!  Basically it's an island of rice topped off with peanuts and shredded carrots surrounded by an ocean of creamy chicken and shrimp curry.  I hate peanuts so I usually order this without the nuts and tell them to cut down on the carrots (they do like to go overboard with it).  To me this dish isn't spicy at all (but we all have diff. taste buds) if anything its mild.  It's one of my FAVORITE dishes here.  And for those of you who are afraid to try curry, this is prob. a good starter dish to get you into it, it's not that in your face curry smell. -Teriyaki Chicken:  I remember going here with a friend and he had ordered this and I had ordered my Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and I remembered him saying it was pretty good so one day I decided to give up my regular for this and oh my what a treat!  The chicken is served on a bed of white rice with a slice of grilled plantain and pineapple.  The chicken is cooked to perfection leaving it a little bit charred (it gives it a smokey taste), the sauce isn't overpowering but the sweetness of the sauce makes it go really well with the rice.  For the grilled plantain and pineapple I say screw the pineapple and give us more plantains.  If they haven't done it already (which I don't think they have) they need to make a plantain dessert after this (maybe even a cheesecake mmm) I'm not sure if they added sugar to this but it has a little hint of sweetness to it, it definitely brings the dish together somehow! -Desserts(my fav. part about this place)       -30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: this is over the top, I wanted this for my birthday and got it but man I did not know what I was getting into until I took a bite out of this.  It's really good if you like rich desserts.  Obviously cheesecake is already rich itself, but when its layered with choco. fudge cake oh man you're in trouble (I hope no one is on a diet that goes to TCF lol).  I usually have a separate stomach for desserts, but I had to throw the white flag up and save this for when I had an empty stomach.          -Godiva chocolate cheesecake:  This is the first slice of cheesecake I've had from here and if you love chocolate you'll LOVE this one.  It's rich and chocolatey, made with flourless godiva choco. cake, godiva choco. cheesecake, and choco. mousse topped off with 2 pipings of whip cream (it's their signature to cheesecakes) and garnished with a the signature choco. square from godiva. It could use more whip cream though.     -Kahlua coffee cheesecake:  At first I thought this was an odd mixture, but I love coffee and I didn't want to stray from my regular.  If you are a coffee lover you will love this, to me it's not AS rich as the other cheesecakes I've had.  It's made with a brownie bottom, then layered with kahlua cheesecake, choco. mousse and choco. ganache. -Classic Mojito (specialty drink):  I've had better mojitos, this one is way too sweet for my taste (maybe way too sweet for a mojito in general), and I love sweets usually.  I'm not sure but I think they dumped a whole bunch of sugar in here or something =\ -Strawberry creamsicle (specialty drink):  This is almost like drinking a strawberry milkshake, it's SOO delicious you'll want to order more.  One of my favs :)  Overall, this is a great food chain as far as taste, ambience and portion size.  Did I mention they have beautifully painted walls and decor? Definitely worth it for the price you pay."
Stephanie W.,"Santa Clara, United States",110,19,,2.0,14/3/2012,I ate here once and it was okay... Really overpriced though! Then I ate here another time and got some sort of pasta dish and it was so awful I sent it back and got a burger cause you can't really screw up a burger. Their cheescake I give 5 stars but food.... not so much and way too much for what they are serving you.
Michael H.,"Hayward, United States",319,1403,650,3.0,27/10/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory is a fallback restaurant for those who can't decide want they want to eat.  If nothing else they have cheesecake and booze. The walls have the textured look of cheesecake.  Music consists of Kenny G. like interpretations of pop classics.  For some reason this place reminds me of Las Vegas, imitation extravagance and mediocre food at tourist prices. The service is either hit or miss.  I've only been here with big groups. Menu selection is quite extensive at a fault.  It always takes people like fifteen minutes to make up their mind.  And what's with the advertisements?  Every other page is an advertisement!  I come here to eat, not shop.  If I want to do my shopping I'll go to Valley Fair thank you very much. Like I said, the food is mediocre.  No matter what you get, the quality of food doesn't justify the prices; yet, I've never had anything really terrible.  If you want to play it safe just stick to the cheesecake.  And if you don't like the cheesecake don't come here."
Shannon C.,"San Francisco, United States",159,292,29,3.0,3/9/2010,"mediocrity at it's finest. everything tastes the same, but they have a ton of options so you can't complain that you ""aren't hungry"" or ""don't see anything you want"" to make boys think you're not a total pig (don't worry, i am).  i honestly would not come here if it weren't a place with a bar directly across from my work. one of the bartenders is really nice, though i forget his name. cute asian dude. he's rad. oh, and one more thing: CORN FRITTERS. deep fried batter with corn mixed in, some kind of spicy dip that i believe to be mayonnaise thus we cannot speak of it anymore, and so greasy they have to serve them on a napkin. that's bad, right? so bad. yet so, so delicious."
Lindsey A.,"San Jose, United States",143,455,22,4.0,2/5/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is good. Whoever says that is not is just being a prude. Whatever. You know you like it.  I haven't had really bad food ever there. Salads, desserts, everything is good. Yes, portions are too big, but-- hey-- who can complain about doggie bags? They're the best!  I have gotten the chicken & biscuits (good), chicken costoletta (very good), cajun chicken littles (very good), chinese chicken salad (very good), luau salad (very good), and chicken madeira (very good). I'm sure I've gotten other things there before as well. Anyway, my hubby had the most amazing dish today there though: portabello mushroom burger. Ooooooh my god, it was HELLA good. You must, must, must try it. It is simply delicious.  Don't get me wrong, I don't eat at Cheesecake Factory all the time. Maaaaaaaybe 3 or 4 times a year, but I honestly have never been disappointed in the place. It serves up consistently good food at a really decent price."
Candice T.,"Burlingame, United States",519,377,312,2.0,12/9/2008,"...and the cheesecake isn't even all that good. **in the spirit of the (continuous) Tarantino argument i've been having with my boyfriend as of late, i'll give you this review backwards... there just comes a point when you have to realize that no matter how much your friends and loved ones rave about it, they simply don't realize that you can't eat the Soylent Green... for obvious taste reasons. i guess my mistake was not eating the one or two items that i've trial-by-error after trial-by-error found to be worth putting through my mouth. i've given this place A LOT of shots, eating from the fish menu to the burger menu, from appetizers to salads...  The Factory dishes are simply that; as well as distractingly bland. in the middle of a conversation, i'll notice that i've taken several bites without a enjoying a single one.  oh, and the Tarantino argument: with about three exceptions, his written-directed films suck. maybe you can tell that i really liked pulp fiction and kill bill..."
Karen H.,"Daly City, United States",344,1087,3,4.0,10/9/2013,"I don't normally write a reviewsfor these type of places, but I had to. Cheesecake has a huge selection of items and most of them are pretty yummy. I ordered my fave pasta. Bow Tie pasta with chicken, tomato, mushroom, peas, and bacon with a cream sauce. Of course NO PEAS. I haven't gotton this pasta in awhile, so when I received my pasta, I kind of forgot what was suppose to be in it. It only had bacon in it and I asked the waitress are there suppose to be mushrooms in this dish, and she said no. I swear there was, but I kept eating it because I was so hungry and it was really good. Later on I asked for a menu and checked that everything in my pasta was missing. I only said no peas.....it was really good still, but I told my waitress. She went and told the manager and took 25% off the bill. She didn't have to do that, but was so nice about it. Most would just take the pasta off the bill, but 25%. Great service!!!!"
Abi U.,"Fremont, United States",228,304,3,3.0,12/8/2008,"I remember when my friends and I used to be single we used to have ""contests"" on who can 1) score a date and 2) get the guy to bring us here. This location didn't exist back then (we were betting on the one in SF) and clearly I didn't win too often bc had I known this is what I was competing for I would say, ""really? here? ehhh?"" For the record I had dates.... i just didn't make it to the Cheesecake Factory (good thing or bad thing? lol I don't know..)!  I don't understand the hype about this place. The food isn't worth the price BUT f*ck yeah is the cheesecake good!!! I've had the steak which isn't too bad, salmon, asian noodle thing (oops sorry can't remember the name!), and fetuccini. If it wasn't for everyone and their mother requesting to have their bday here I probably would have never come back to order. Really, I only come here to get my Cookie Dough Cheesecake... mmmmmmmmmmmm!!!! The cheesecake is sooo good! Atmosphere is your typical date atmosphere; dim lighting, soft music.... too bad there's a ton of people everywhere all the time and parking sucks. Ruin the mood why don't you.... lol.  Service is great for how busy they are. I feel for the people that work here, I hope they get good tips."
Nicole M.,"San Jose, United States",0,10,,3.0,15/4/2012,"The food is great but I always seem to have issues with the lack of customer service. During a previous visit, my pager went off and I had to wait +15min to be seated due to some type of error with the receptionist. During my last visit on 04/13/12, I sat for +20min without ever being acknowledged by a server due to a change in shifts. However, I still continue to come here because the food is good and I'm expecting better service for my next visit, which I have yet to experience."
Angela L.,"San Francisco, United States",47,997,621,4.0,4/1/2009,"(This is for Cheesecake Factories in Bay Area in General) FOOD: 1.) Pumpkin pie Cheesecake = Super yummy! If you like pumpkin pie, and if you love cheesecake! It's seasonal though :( 2.) Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake = Mmm your basic strawberry cheesecake.  3.) Lemon Rasberry Cheesecake = OMG I had this long time ago, but I totally forgot about it. I'd say it is the BEST cheesecake they have x_x WHY DON""T I REMEMBER THESE THINGS?! SERVICE: I always feel like Cheesecake Factory servers are very good at their job. I mean, they always seem nice and sincere; although sometimes too nice and sincere where I think it's fake. But I guess I'd rather it that way. Ah ha, but yeah very nice, professional, even though I often just go there to order dessert and drink :( They don't let on any disappointment for a small bill ATMOSPHERE: Love it! Well only because it seem like a fancy restaurant with the high ceilings, high door frames, marble floors, roman pillar decor, and dim lighting. But! with reasonably priced food, and a wide selection of it. Oh and Cheesecake Factory locations are usually conveniently right next to shopping."
judy l.,"San Francisco, United States",4,114,9,5.0,10/7/2009,"This Cheesecake Factory has the best service ever!!!! The server was attentive but not too in your face.  Normally, at other Cheesecake Factories the service is bad because they are handling so many tables/patrons.  The food was delicious as usual and our water/drinks were refilled as soon as ice started to sit on the bottom of the cup.  The server came by two times during our meal to make sure everything was ok.  The woman who brought out my pasta actually went to get me a pasta spoon!  I've never had anyone at any other Cheesecakes do that, so now I know what I have been missing. Thank you Valley Fair Cheesecake Factory Staff for keeping me to believe that there are good decent food server/waitstaff still around. P.S.  I will never forget how full I felt and still had a lot of leftover for dinner."
Dino G.,"San Francisco, United States",2,21,1,4.0,7/1/2010,Food's great and comes in great quantities - cocktails and stiff too! Get the Godiva Cheescake: you'll be sick afterwards but it's 1000% bliss.
Thanh L.,"Sacramento, United States",112,81,12,2.0,13/2/2009,"We had the firecracker salmon rolls which were REALLY good, so we decided to get another plate, but after a bit it made me so nauseous. We also ordered the Miso salmon that the waiter suggested. It was REALLY sweet, I like sweet food, but I have to say it tasted so wrong. something that was meant to be savory and eaten with rice was candy sweet. I made my friend eat it all since she said it was ""not bad"".  I am a true foodie, the food here for me really didn't impress and had a one note to the taste. Was not worth the money =\"
Darlene G.,"Seattle, United States",4,20,2,2.0,27/11/2009,"Food is ok. Service is terrible. Our waiter was way too high to be at work.  Not my crowd, Good for groups of young loud drunk people."
Sasha S.,"San Jose, United States",8,116,18,1.0,4/9/2009,Its too glorified for its food....  the only thing good IS the cheesecake and other desserts  everything else taste like refrozen or cheaply tossed together.  I'm a horrid cook... and my mac&cheesh balls come out much more flavorful...
Emma F.,"Fremont, United States",1,13,,3.0,30/5/2012,"This used to be one of my 4 stars, lots of joy to go to restaurants.  Lately, though, they've adopted a ""penny wise (and pound foolish!)"" approach that leaves me disappointed.  I drink coffee, and I used to be able to order it with whipped cream ,and get the creamy, sweet whipped cream that accompanies the cheesecake. Last time, I got the decorative air that goes on top of most drinks.  Just not the same.  I would happily have paid for the whipped cream, if I got the good stuff, but the cheap substitute after getting the good stuff on a series of visits was a telling disappointment."
Sarah D.,"San Jose, United States",6,125,6,4.0,28/12/2013,"Love the appetizers, great drinks and of course cheesecake. Nice location that isn't as long as a wait as it looks or how long you're told to wait. Good service, not amazing but I like this location!"
Carissa G.,"Pasadena, United States",1,462,81,4.0,8/1/2009,"I love the cheesecake factory. They don't have one in NYC! I couldn't believe it but they don't have a Nordstroms either so.... anyways i love and miss the cheesecake factory. I was back in CA for a period of time and knew I had to come. I love their strawberry lemonade and their pasta the Da Vinci is great (I always ask for it on angel hair pasta--try it, it's great) the Louisiana chicken pasta, evelen's favorite pasta, and the farfalle are all great as well. As for cheesecake (you can't go to the cheesecake factory without getting cheesecake) I like the godiva the best, raspberry truffle and dulce de leche also worth trying.  Have fun!"

Angela L.,"San Francisco, CA",47,997,621,4.0,1/4/2009,"(This is for Cheesecake Factories in Bay Area in General) FOOD: 1.) Pumpkin pie Cheesecake = Super yummy! If you like pumpkin pie, and if you love cheesecake! It's seasonal though :( 2.) Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake = Mmm your basic strawberry cheesecake.  3.) Lemon Rasberry Cheesecake = OMG I had this long time ago, but I totally forgot about it. I'd say it is the BEST cheesecake they have x_x WHY DON""T I REMEMBER THESE THINGS?! SERVICE: I always feel like Cheesecake Factory servers are very good at their job. I mean, they always seem nice and sincere; although sometimes too nice and sincere where I think it's fake. But I guess I'd rather it that way. Ah ha, but yeah very nice, professional, even though I often just go there to order dessert and drink :( They don't let on any disappointment for a small bill ATMOSPHERE: Love it! Well only because it seem like a fancy restaurant with the high ceilings, high door frames, marble floors, roman pillar decor, and dim lighting. But! with reasonably priced food, and a wide selection of it. Oh and Cheesecake Factory locations are usually conveniently right next to shopping."
judy l.,"San Francisco, CA",4,114,9,5.0,7/10/2009,"This Cheesecake Factory has the best service ever!!!! The server was attentive but not too in your face.  Normally, at other Cheesecake Factories the service is bad because they are handling so many tables/patrons.  The food was delicious as usual and our water/drinks were refilled as soon as ice started to sit on the bottom of the cup.  The server came by two times during our meal to make sure everything was ok.  The woman who brought out my pasta actually went to get me a pasta spoon!  I've never had anyone at any other Cheesecakes do that, so now I know what I have been missing. Thank you Valley Fair Cheesecake Factory Staff for keeping me to believe that there are good decent food server/waitstaff still around. P.S.  I will never forget how full I felt and still had a lot of leftover for dinner."
Dino G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,21,1,4.0,1/7/2010,Food's great and comes in great quantities - cocktails and stiff too! Get the Godiva Cheescake: you'll be sick afterwards but it's 1000% bliss.
Thanh L.,"Sacramento, CA",112,81,12,2.0,2/13/2009,"We had the firecracker salmon rolls which were REALLY good, so we decided to get another plate, but after a bit it made me so nauseous. We also ordered the Miso salmon that the waiter suggested. It was REALLY sweet, I like sweet food, but I have to say it tasted so wrong. something that was meant to be savory and eaten with rice was candy sweet. I made my friend eat it all since she said it was ""not bad"".  I am a true foodie, the food here for me really didn't impress and had a one note to the taste. Was not worth the money =\"
Darlene G.,"Seattle, WA",4,20,2,2.0,11/27/2009,"Food is ok. Service is terrible. Our waiter was way too high to be at work.  Not my crowd, Good for groups of young loud drunk people."
Sasha S.,"San Jose, CA",8,116,18,1.0,9/4/2009,Its too glorified for its food....  the only thing good IS the cheesecake and other desserts  everything else taste like refrozen or cheaply tossed together.  I'm a horrid cook... and my mac&cheesh balls come out much more flavorful...
Emma F.,"Fremont, CA",1,13,,3.0,5/30/2012,"This used to be one of my 4 stars, lots of joy to go to restaurants.  Lately, though, they've adopted a ""penny wise (and pound foolish!)"" approach that leaves me disappointed.  I drink coffee, and I used to be able to order it with whipped cream ,and get the creamy, sweet whipped cream that accompanies the cheesecake. Last time, I got the decorative air that goes on top of most drinks.  Just not the same.  I would happily have paid for the whipped cream, if I got the good stuff, but the cheap substitute after getting the good stuff on a series of visits was a telling disappointment."
Sarah D.,"San Jose, CA",6,125,6,4.0,12/28/2013,"Love the appetizers, great drinks and of course cheesecake. Nice location that isn't as long as a wait as it looks or how long you're told to wait. Good service, not amazing but I like this location!"
Carissa G.,"Pasadena, CA",1,462,81,4.0,1/8/2009,"I love the cheesecake factory. They don't have one in NYC! I couldn't believe it but they don't have a Nordstroms either so.... anyways i love and miss the cheesecake factory. I was back in CA for a period of time and knew I had to come. I love their strawberry lemonade and their pasta the Da Vinci is great (I always ask for it on angel hair pasta--try it, it's great) the Louisiana chicken pasta, evelen's favorite pasta, and the farfalle are all great as well. As for cheesecake (you can't go to the cheesecake factory without getting cheesecake) I like the godiva the best, raspberry truffle and dulce de leche also worth trying.  Have fun!"
