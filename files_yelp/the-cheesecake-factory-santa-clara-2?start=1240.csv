Emi B.,"San Rafael, United States",22,26,13,4.0,20/2/2011,"Great place for lunch while shopping at the mall. The food is good as well as the portions. The wait time can sometimes be a bit of a problem. I have one favorite pasta dish I usually get (Chicken with sundried tomatoes) that one time came so salty I got sick (I don't do salt!) But they did send me a gift card for my next visit...in which the pasta came out perfect. Flat iron steak is delish too. If anything...stop in for the cheesecake - try the ""lemon drop"" if you drink :) the Cheese Cake factory in Corte Madera rocks too!"
Rainbow B.,"San Jose, United States",18,137,2,3.0,12/7/2009,"Hmmm. The only reason why I've come here since basically ignoring this overly-crowded spot was because I had a gift card.  You know, the horrored and crazy calories that have been exposed in chains like cheesecake, macorroni grill and such... so I've pretty much stayed away.  The cheesecakes, especially the carrot cake (above all the cakes) are the unhealthiest ever.  It's pretty pricey here I must say.  And the food is pretty salty.  So I usually stick with the salads..  Tonight I've ordered the lemon-herb chicken.  I hope it turns out okay and it doesn't make me feel like I will have congestive heart failure afterwards.   Is it quality food? I'm kind of on the fence about it.  I will give them some credit for having so many options... The service: sometimes when I call in I get like... I think a teenager or something, where they are all giggly on the phone.. and they can't hear me because their people are talking in the background.  After I max out my gift card, I don't think I will be coming back.  Nothing special for what you pay for.  Best item: the wheat bread and mashed potatoes.  That probably says a thing or two....."
Jennifer S.,"San Jose, United States",1,10,,1.0,19/1/2015,"I want to start by saying that i am shocked that i have to write this as your customer service is normally better than anyone!  However, on 12/31 at 4:33PM called to place an order for 3 appetizers and cheesecake.  I was told 30 min and to pull up to the customer pickup and call the number and my order will be brought out. When I pulled up the pick up parking was taken so I with 3 other cars had to double park in the red zone, so there was not an option to walk in.  I called at 5:11PM and was told they would be right out. When no one came out by 5:21PM I called again and again at 5:31PM (and was told I cant believe they have not brought that out yet you have called 2 previous times) and again at 536PM.  In the last call I asked to speak to the manager. The lady said she was the manager I told her i had been calling for over 25min and she told me, ""we are busy tonight"".  6 mins later someone came out and brought me the food.   I understand that the restaurant is busy but if that is the case then don't tell people the order will be ready in 30mins.  After all the waiting the order was not correct.  No bread and wrong cheesecake.  I feel like we are all busy and did not appreciate being told you are too busy to process and bring my order in the time period you gave me."
S S.,"Fremont, United States",2,65,,4.0,24/1/2010,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and I generally enjoy the food despite my general tendency to stay away from chains. This location was no exception.  I went with my family, all of whom (excluding me) are fairly picky eaters. Two of us got the Factory Burrito Grande without chicken, and the other two got pastas (four-cheese & pasta w/ marinara sauce). We were all incredibly satisfied by the portions and quality of food. What was equally impressive was our waiter, Eric E. We told him we were vegetarian and he later came back to ask if we can take chicken broth. Apparently it's in some sauce in the burrito, and he noticed it and came to ask! The food took a little bit longer to prepare because of the burrito modification, but he and the manager apologized to us several times. We were all incredibly awed by his sensitivity to our dietary needs and even told his manager as much. I've rarely ever had such a thoughtful waiter!  My reason for knocking off one star has to do with the price of the cheesecake. I used to frequently visit The Cheesecake Factory in Batimore, MD, and I remember the cheesecake slices being reasonably-priced, NOTHING like the $6.75-$7.75+ at the Valley Fair location. Ridiculous! $7 for ONE SLICE?   Otherwise I would recommend this place, but come early because it gets really crowded after a while!"
Jboogie L.,"San Francisco, United States",30,2182,879,3.0,19/9/2009,"Been here multiple times and there is always a long, waiting line.  We arrived around 5pm and had to wait 5 to 10 minutes before being seated.   Service was good and dishes came out promptly. The food is really mediocre.  I got the meatloaf and I tried my friend's Mahi Mahi and Chicken Madiera.  We shared the Raspberry Truffle White Chocolate Cheesecake.   The cheesecake is always my favorite and the highlight of the meal"
Bret B.,"Salinas, United States",1230,120,103,3.0,6/8/2013,"food great, service sucks, unless you like being ignored"
Heather M.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,,2.0,4/12/2008,"Oh the Cheesecake Factory. Where to start. The food is mediocre at best. The servers are fake. The food comes out cold every time. How there is a wait in the lobby, I have no idea. I ordered the Chinese Chicken  Salad. It was watery and not crisp like a salad should be. The manager came by and acted like the salad should be like that, and that I was stupid or something. I couldn't even eat it, so I asked for something else. I got the Chicken Costelletta which was an improvement, but was greasy and butter infused and I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate.  The service was good, but I don't go to restaurants for service. I'm paying for food, and what I got was mediocre and fattening. There must have been 5000 calories in that.  Oh well, the mom and pop places will enjoy my business after the overly corporate experience"
Rev. Dr. Christopher J. G.,"Mountain View, United States",501,520,1,4.0,18/9/2008,"I woudl totally give this a lower score if I could. Why can't I? Because I've never been disappointed. It's a shame, it really is, as there's this dead-eyed corporate feel that irks me something fierce, and when I'm dragged there by The Little One or My Mom, it's always good food.  They have a Meatloaf thing that's like a savory meatloaf banana split with the mashed potatoes serving as the icr cream, the gravy as the fudge and the meatloaf as the banana and crispy onions as the nuts! It's fantastic and I took my first bite, unhappy to be at the place, and just went 'Aw man, this is really good."" They also serve portions that can fill me up, which is even rarer. Evelyn's pasta is also excellent, especially for serving to a little girl named Evelyn. I also really enjoyed the Banana Cheesecake. The wait is long, but dammit, I've always had good service. I hate myself for loving them! They're attentive, they checked on us a lot, kept things filled. The prices are high, but I'm holding on."
Eli T.,"Los Angeles, United States",370,289,95,4.0,31/7/2008,"Cheesecake factory Located at good old valley fair. The place looks nice and the staff are nice to look at too.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  We had avocado eggrolls, a pizza, and steak and mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were so good and piled HIGH.  The steak was done just right with sautéed onions and mushrooms. The pizza tasted excellent. Then it came down to the avocado eggrolls, it was kinda bland with an egg roll shell. I am accustomed to egg rolls with meat so eating this was bleh.  Honestly, I came here for their 30th anniversary 1.50 cheesecake. I wanted the tres leche but the ran out at 3pm. So I went for the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and that was yummy!  If they had this for a buck fifty on a daily, I'd become a diabetic within a year.  I'd give it 5 stars for their cheesecake but 3.5 stars for their food so that's why i'd give it a 4 star rating."
Rosetta C.,"Campbell, United States",158,256,11,4.0,21/7/2009,This restaurant is pretty decent with a lot of variety to choose from.  Great for the whole family.  Our family usually comes here for dinner a few times a month as it's accomadating for the whole family and we get to pick from a large menu.   The only one downfall is that it gets crowded most nights unless you get there before 5:30pm which we usually do as we have kids and they like to eat early.  We've made reservations there before for 7 people.   Surprisingly their cheese pizza is amazing.  I think they use several different kinds of gourmet cheeses.  We ordered it for one of the kids one time and he didn't like it as it was too gourmet but the adults loved it. The service is nearly always good and they try and accomodate you as best as they can.
Tina P.,"San Jose, United States",24,3,,1.0,6/1/2013,"We had went there for dinner with our coworkers and district manager, the hostess said it will be 45-1 hr wait which was fine, it actually took over 2 hours, kept telling us ""oh we are waiting for the people to get up from their table""  blah blah blah DM asked to speak to the manager finally he seated us and then offer to give us $50 off on our bill which sounds great. We had two different waitresses one was great the other one was rude and horrible. Three out of the 8 of us ordered drinks and another ordered drinks but forgot their ID, whatever oh well we kept it moving, one of us shared an alcoholic drink with another but didn't have ID the waitress straight up walked to us and embarrassed the whole table said ""if you don't have ID you can't have any drinks and you can't be sharing"" she goes and tell another lady ""the alcoholic police"" and she came and mistaken one of us for sharing and asked for ID which the other hostess already ID. WoW and she even told us the same thing if you don't have your ID can't be Sharing drinks! Never! Ever! Have I been embarrassed by the people that worked there, never will I ever go to any Cheesecake Factory especially this one! Bad overall experience."
Baothuong N.,"San Jose, United States",378,110,12,1.0,20/2/2011,our server's liquor knowledge was zero. we were sat next to a young white couple...young like they wore hoodies with dollar bills all over them. they got incredible service from her. i guess my bf and i dont look like good tippers. food was bland. maybe we ordered the wrong things.
Jenny P.,"Lathrop, United States",133,64,9,4.0,7/11/2011,Went here on our 2 year wedding anniversary that fell on a Tuesday night. Not too long of a wait. 5 minutes! The host sat us on a super small table when clearly there were booths available. We asked a waiter and we were immediately seated in a booth ;) Food was good. Hubby had the flat tire beer along with his main course. Gotta get the chicken croquettes! Delish! And ahi tartar... YUMM! Finished it off with a Pumpkin Cheesecake =)
Shayne T.,"Portland, United States",14,102,8,4.0,19/12/2011,"Huge portions, lots of options on the low calorie menu, great fast and friendly service..."
Joel S.,"San Jose, United States",133,167,82,4.0,4/5/2011,"The Good: A great selection of health conscious items, decently priced, excellent cheesecake! The Bad: Inconsistent food/service. The Review: I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times and I've never been wowed before.  I've never had a really good experience, and I've never had a really bad one.  Just average.  Lately however, whether it be my new diet, or just me being less critical, I have had great experiences here.  I noticed that the cheesecake factory has some great options if you are on a diet.  The last time I was here I ordered a Wild Mushroom burger (no onions, protein style), sweet potato fries, and a strawberry cheesecake.  Every one of those items was delicious.  The burger was cooked perfectly, and tasted great even without the bun.  The sweet potato fries were made very well, and made the hurt of not ordering regular fries seem like a mild sting.  And the cheesecake...oh the cheesecake.  With a name like Cheesecake Factory your cheesecake better be top notch, and this one didn't disappoint.  It was just the classic cheesecake with a dollop of whip cream and a couple of strawberries.  It was so rich and the strawberry added that extra kick if you wanted it. The result: Yum!"
Shelly C.,"Palo Alto, United States",33,30,5,5.0,28/3/2012,"They are the best. Even though sometimes I didn't order the right cheesecake for the day, but I really think all of their cakes are awesome. Hope they last forever for people who have sweet tooth like me."
Sharon C.,"Chicago, United States",322,56,21,5.0,10/8/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  The service is great, the food is abundant, delicious, and beautifully plated.  I eat here maybe once every 3 months and I am never disappointed.  If I have a bad day at work and I need a drink, I consider coming here.  The lighting is nice and dim and soothing after a hard day's work.  There are so many dishes to choose from and I have tasted most of them.  This is one restaurant that I can point to any dish on the menu blindfolded and I would love it.  Of course most dishes taste so good because the chefs don't hold back.  Warning: this is not a good place to eat if you trying to lose weight."
Nicolas D.,"Mountain View, United States",8,22,,1.0,5/8/2010,"So disappointed for many things: 1- First of all, we've been told there is a 45min waiting time. We waited for 45 min, 1 hour... Still no table. We asked what's happening: the table is still not available. 1h15... same thing... 1h30: finally we can have a table! We arrived there at 8:30 and started eating at 10:15. Great ! 2- the dishes my friends and I took were TOO SALTED. This is not a good or fancy cuisine as they try to advertise. It is good for a chain restaurant. That's it.  Huge portions, nothing ""delicate"" - salt, oil, meat, sauce... (i got the Shepherd's Pie and my friend the Seared Tuna Salad - this one was great though). Same for desert: huge portion! Good cheesecake... but TOO SWEET. I only felt the cream and sugar. What's the point? 1500 calories for the cake... 1700 calories for my dish... so now what? Should I go make a marathon ? Can't they make something smaller, healthier and tastier? I come from France, so maybe that is why I am picky about food.  I was surprised to see people getting nicely dressed to go to the cheesecake factory... They are other restaurants in the bay area, for the same price range (and some with a 1 star at the Michelin Guide), where you can have good quality food, healthier and tastier... and no need to wait 1:30 ! And you can make reservations ! Cheesecake is good if you eat like 3 and love super salted and sweet food. Service was nice... but they did not do anything for the fact we waited extra 45 min. Next time we'll go to Left Bank in Santana Row..."
Truc N.,"San Jose, United States",334,200,45,4.0,19/4/2011,"Food is good and cheesecake is even better. I love the cheesecakes here!!  ALl the ones i've tried have been delicious.  The dulce de leche is really good.  Not overly sweet.  I also really like the tres leches!  Sooo good!  But my favorite right now has to be the red velvet cheesecake.  it's so good!  Dense, flavorful and scrumptiously delicious.  I don't really care if service is bad because food is always good and the cheesecake is always amazing!!!  I know service can ruin the experience but I would always come back here for the food.  I've never really had a bad experience at this location though.  Service may be a bit slow at times, but they try."

The Review: I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times and I've never been wowed before.  I've never had a really good experience, and I've never had a really bad one.  Just average.  Lately however, whether it be my new diet, or just me being less critical, I have had great experiences here.  I noticed that the cheesecake factory has some great options if you are on a diet.  The last time I was here I ordered a Wild Mushroom burger (no onions, protein style), sweet potato fries, and a strawberry cheesecake.  Every one of those items was delicious.  The burger was cooked perfectly, and tasted great even without the bun.  The sweet potato fries were made very well, and made the hurt of not ordering regular fries seem like a mild sting.  And the cheesecake...oh the cheesecake.  With a name like Cheesecake Factory your cheesecake better be top notch, and this one didn't disappoint.  It was just the classic cheesecake with a dollop of whip cream and a couple of strawberries.  It was so rich and the strawberry added that extra kick if you wanted it. The result: Yum!"
Shelly C.,"Palo Alto, CA",33,30,5,5.0,3/28/2012,"They are the best. Even though sometimes I didn't order the right cheesecake for the day, but I really think all of their cakes are awesome. Hope they last forever for people who have sweet tooth like me."
Sharon C.,"Chicago, IL",322,56,21,5.0,8/10/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  The service is great, the food is abundant, delicious, and beautifully plated.  I eat here maybe once every 3 months and I am never disappointed.  If I have a bad day at work and I need a drink, I consider coming here.  The lighting is nice and dim and soothing after a hard day's work.  There are so many dishes to choose from and I have tasted most of them.  This is one restaurant that I can point to any dish on the menu blindfolded and I would love it.  Of course most dishes taste so good because the chefs don't hold back.  Warning: this is not a good place to eat if you trying to lose weight."
Nicolas D.,"Mountain View, CA",8,22,,1.0,8/5/2010,"So disappointed for many things: 1- First of all, we've been told there is a 45min waiting time. We waited for 45 min, 1 hour... Still no table. We asked what's happening: the table is still not available. 1h15... same thing... 1h30: finally we can have a table! We arrived there at 8:30 and started eating at 10:15. Great ! 2- the dishes my friends and I took were TOO SALTED. This is not a good or fancy cuisine as they try to advertise. It is good for a chain restaurant. That's it.  Huge portions, nothing ""delicate"" - salt, oil, meat, sauce... (i got the Shepherd's Pie and my friend the Seared Tuna Salad - this one was great though). Same for desert: huge portion! Good cheesecake... but TOO SWEET. I only felt the cream and sugar. What's the point? 1500 calories for the cake... 1700 calories for my dish... so now what? Should I go make a marathon ? Can't they make something smaller, healthier and tastier? I come from France, so maybe that is why I am picky about food.  I was surprised to see people getting nicely dressed to go to the cheesecake factory... They are other restaurants in the bay area, for the same price range (and some with a 1 star at the Michelin Guide), where you can have good quality food, healthier and tastier... and no need to wait 1:30 ! And you can make reservations ! Cheesecake is good if you eat like 3 and love super salted and sweet food. Service was nice... but they did not do anything for the fact we waited extra 45 min. Next time we'll go to Left Bank in Santana Row..."
Truc N.,"San Jose, CA",334,200,45,4.0,4/19/2011,"Food is good and cheesecake is even better. I love the cheesecakes here!!  ALl the ones i've tried have been delicious.  The dulce de leche is really good.  Not overly sweet.  I also really like the tres leches!  Sooo good!  But my favorite right now has to be the red velvet cheesecake.  it's so good!  Dense, flavorful and scrumptiously delicious.  I don't really care if service is bad because food is always good and the cheesecake is always amazing!!!  I know service can ruin the experience but I would always come back here for the food.  I've never really had a bad experience at this location though.  Service may be a bit slow at times, but they try."
