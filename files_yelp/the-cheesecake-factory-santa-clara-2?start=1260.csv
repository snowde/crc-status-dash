Jonathan P.,"Washington, DC, United States",981,106,37,5.0,22/4/2008,"The only thing I eat is the Bang Bang Chick en and Shrimp dish. yeah. *mouth waters* I highly suggest before you die, try this dish for kicks.  I am recommend ing everyone to try it who likes curry or wants to  break their curry cherry to eat this dish.  It is so damn good.  The middle is a nice cupped rice on top of the  garnishes with a sea of  tender chicken and shrimp swimming in a sea of Thai Curry.  WOW.  It is good.  I really can't explain it in any other way.   holler."
Amanda D.,"Menlo Park, United States",432,373,430,3.0,24/3/2009,"The menu is overwhelming! If you have a hard time deciding what to eat when you go out, don't go here. It took my friend and I a good 15 minutes just to get through the enormous menu. With that said, this place is great if you are SUPER hungry and have an endless stomach. For the size of the menu, they do OK in terms of quality of the food. My friend and I both got pizzas. I got the Vegetarian and goat cheese. It was really good, but extra greasy. They put extra amounts of basil oil on top and I don't think it was necessary. My friend had the white pizza and it was delicious. You should just share a pizza - they are much bigger than say CPKs.  Finally, for dessert - a little indulgence - we had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Omg. Heaven!!  If anything, go here for the cheesecake. It's their namesake after all, and they know what they are doing!"
neal w.,"Milpitas, United States",367,24,,4.0,28/12/2013,"I've had the jambalaya in the past, the pasta I usually get is pretty good. This place is kind of popular and on the expensive side 10$+ for each entree."
Geomar R.,"Santa Clara, United States",127,220,11,3.0,5/8/2008,"Cheesecake Factory was actually decent....5 years ago. The service and quality of food has been declining ever since I have first eaten there 5 years ago. This place is constantly crowded and the wait times are ridiculous. I have recently been there to celebrate my step son's birthday, and it was just ok. The only bright spot that night was the crab wontons appetizer. It was crunchy with cheese and crab oozing out during each bite. There is sweet sauce that compliments it very well. I was not hungry that night, so I ordered the philly steak sandwich. It was pretty good at first, but for some reason, it tasted colder as I reached the middle of the sandwich. My wife ordered the beer battered fish and chips which were mostly soggy and not crunchy - a very poor execution of fish and chips.  The ambiance reminds me of the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas, which was pretty nice. The service was lazy and uninspiring. Overall, a mediocre eating experience..."
Donna N.,"Fremont, United States",0,10,,5.0,22/8/2012,"Service here is phenomenal! Our server, Jamie B was extremely patient while I explained my order. (trust me, I am not easy to deal with sometimes!) The atmosphere is very calm and pleasing. We were checked on promptly to see if we were enjoying everything. Definately one of the best Cheesecake Factory's I have had the pleasure of dining in. Great service makes great food taste better!"
Lena T.,"Reno, United States",232,304,748,3.0,19/2/2009,"At times there's a long wait especially on the weekends or during graduation, so it's better to call ahead of time. This place is good for lunch or diner. Unfortunately every time i come here i end up ordering something not so great but, it's ok i always end up picking at the boyfriends plate. I do like their fruit smoothies and the firecracker salmon rolls are the bomb, and of course what little fatty would leave without ordering what their known for?!"
Caleb L.,"Cupertino, United States",136,39,,2.0,19/8/2008,"Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Monday night = still waiting for 45 minutes? Nothx. Had the pasta bolognese, was really MEH for $13, with the noodles way too hard and chewy.  Service was cheerful and friendly but slow (see a pattern here?).  Pyramid Hef on draft = win, $7 for a 22 oz.  This place is so overrated. 2.4 stars"
Lily M.,"San Jose, United States",254,123,12,3.0,22/7/2009,"Had dinner with my girlfriends last week and we received great service.  The food is another issue. This would be my second experience dining at Cheesecake and both times the food was lacking in the flavor department.  I had a typhoon cocktail that was nice and shared a combination of steak Diane and salmon with lemon sauce. The dish was plated nicely but the salmon was dry and a little tasteless even with the lemon sauce slathered all over it. It's alright, I'll just salt my food and order cheesecake next time I'm there."
Cherryl D.,"San Jose, United States",362,645,188,4.0,6/3/2009,"My Ratings: Quality of Food - 4 Stars  Quantity of Food - 4 Stars  Price - 4 Stars  Location - 4 Stars  Parking - 3 Stars  Service - 4 Stars  Speed - 4 Stars  My Opinion/Story: When I first had Cheesecake Factory, I was a bit hesitant because I thought it's mostly about the cheesecake dessert.  I don't really like cheesecake but I'm glad they had other dishes as well.  I remember ordering some sandwich which turned out too big for me to bite.  Then over the years, I've tried their other dishes, pasta, steak, veggies and other entree.  They have alot to choose from and when I ate there with my co-workers, one ordered a pot-pie which turned out to be so big that 3-5 people can actually share.   Service is always good but come during their busy hours and you end up waiting for hours.  Food is great, service is great, location is great but can get pretty loud and you end up going home with left overs. This Santa Clara location gets pretty busy because they're situated by the mall.  If you come at the wrong time, expect to wait looonnnnggg."
Chet A.,"Hayward, United States",24,37,35,4.0,22/1/2012,Well the hot chocolate is a bit to sweet but the service is good and on top of their game. We will see when the food gets here.
Berg W.,"Sacramento, United States",94,298,1,2.0,14/4/2008,"Well, you know that if there is the noun ""factory"" in the name, a restaurant is bound to be good...right? Honestly, what images does that term conjure? To me, it means mass production with an emphasis on quantity. That philosophy certainly applies to this place: quantity over quality. The charm of this place is the fact that you can get ANYTHING that you want. The menu is like 48 pages long. Personally, I would rather have five things that are thoughtfully produced, than five hundred that are thrown together haphazardly. Yeah the cheesecake is good and big, but unless you really have a thing for cheesecake, I don't think it's a life-altering experience. Let me tell you about the buffalo blasters appetizers. That's a blaster before and after you eat it, to not be completely graphic. The portions here are HUGE, if that's what you're into. How about a shredded iceberg salad piled four-feet-high if you're on a diet? That way you can order two wedges of cheesecake! Don't really need to come here again, but if I'm in Omaha or some other city with a lack of quality culinary offerings, I might."
Lydia S.,"Santa Clara, United States",55,34,,4.0,7/10/2009,"I love eating here, the place is very busy but worth the wait.  Their prices are very reasonable compared to some of the other places across the street at Santana Row. I love the appetizer selection and try a different one each time I eat there.  I have yet to try the cheesecake because I am so satisfied with my meals that I am too full to eat desert.  My goal is to go there for a light dinner and then indulge myself with one of their famous cheesecakes.  I can't wait!"
Daniel P.,"Los Angeles, United States",24,12,68,5.0,3/12/2010,"The best server in the world works here, funny and cute, make sure you ask for her Lynna she recommended the Carmel chicken and sub the rice with ""Lingtossgarbutt"" as she put it or linguini tossed in garlic butter sooo delicious."
E H.,"Watsonville, United States",12,55,10,4.0,17/5/2008,"Had a chance to dine here for the first time.  I'm not a resident of Santa Clara, so to make a long story short a friend and I decided to take a chance on the CF. First of all when we arrived, around 1:30pm, the place was hopping.  We went up to the front and said is it possible that we will be able to eat by 8:00pm tonight, and the person said if its just the two of you, it'll be a 8-10 min wait.  Well, we were seated exactly 10 min later.  We had a wonderful waiter, DRAKE, ask for this guy he's totally professional and very personable.  No he's not a friend or relative.... The food was good as well as the portions.  We split a calamari appetizer, as well as splitting a Chinese Chicken salad.  Plenty of food, and plenty of room for cheesecake.  Drake suggested the Strawberry Cheesecake, which we went with, and it was plenty for two to share.  There was a table next to us that split there cheesecake 4 ways! The burgers looked outrageous, and Drake said if you eat one of those, your done.  So, eat just half of it to save room for the cheesecake. Prices are very reasonable, great service, good size portions of above average food. Would I visit again?? Hey, Yesss!"
Chris M.,"Las Vegas, United States",149,41,46,3.0,21/6/2010,"Brought my dad here for Father's Day. He's not very picky, but he just can't have anything spicy because of his Ulcer. The only thing I want to review is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. I usually order the same thing at Cheesecake Factory, but decided to try these.  It was so good! It was like eating dessert before the main course. It's like Chevy's sweet corn dilio but a larger portion flattened like a small crab cake and drizzled with a creamy chipotle sauce. So good. I didn't even eat my meal once it came out. Gotta try it!"
Ram S.,"Santa Clara, United States",11,27,,4.0,25/6/2009,"Sure the prices are quite steep but the decor and the service was impeccable.  Our waitress was extremely attentive and the portions are quite large. One thing I didn't like this time and every time I go there, is the waiting time.  We went on a Wednesday and it's still packed.  I guess you really can't fix that but ...geez. They also need to improve on their vegetarian selections as we didn't have too many options.  A++ for the desserts though! I would recommend it but I wouldn't go there often as I'm sure it will kill you soon enough if you did :)  It's more like a once-in-3-months type thing."
Kati B.,"Concord, United States",30,25,1,3.0,24/9/2008,"One of the best things I have ever eaten can be found at the Cheesecake Factory.  The avocado eggrolls may sound a little weird, but trust me, they are amazing.   I have introduced several people to them, and all of them have since spontaneously brought them up several times, reminiscing about how good those eggrolls were. There are many other great things on the menu (such as the portabello burger, OMG), and the cheesecake is even pretty darn good (though, admittedly, not my fav).  It's a fun place to go for a chain restaurant, and I'd definitely recommend it."
Evelyn K.,"Cupertino, United States",295,470,135,4.0,1/3/2009,"Another great experience today and had their eggs Benedict which was delicious.  Also tried my friend's waffles which was great too.  Our waiter was very attentive and if you want to try breakfast on Sunday's at Cheesecake, come around 11:30am.   Because when we left there was a lovely crowd waiting to be seated.  Didn't realize they had music playing, nice touch."
Athens r.,"Union City, United States",56,134,,4.0,28/2/2009,"I HEART CHEESECAKE FACTORY NO DOUBT.  IVE LEARNED TO LOVE ITS STYLE. came here on a friday noon to eat lunch and yes wE didnt mind waiting (aside from the secondary gain of our purpose) i would love to say that waiting here doesnt really matter to me coz the food is worth it.....  i have loved their bistro shrimp pasta-- ive loved their variety of bread, ive loved their greEn tea with mint... even if i keep getting these same stuff over and over.. too bad my chance to try other food in the menu is shut off bec of this attitude. and too bad i seldom reach the desserts after a great meal. Maybe ill sit here one time juz trying several desserts.... hmmm. minus one star for the waiting but thats okay.. the noontime mojitos-- is sweet enough for my taste..luvd it! only--the kick was strong, strong enough to get me the worst bloated feeling ive ever felt on a lazy afternoon. oh well, CF still gets a four star. I would always love to go back and try something new every time. COZ EVERY TIME, CF never failed me."
