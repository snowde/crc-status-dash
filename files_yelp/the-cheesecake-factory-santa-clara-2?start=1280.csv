Rob G.,"Sunnyvale, United States",116,136,23,4.0,29/3/2009,"I've been here probably twenty or thirty times... and I've been completely satisfied almost every time. Anything that's ever gone wrong wasn't really a big deal and didn't dramatically affect the quality of my experience. The other night I dined here and we ordered one of their new ""Small Plates,"" fried artichoke hearts with lemon-garlic aioli... WOW it was amazing!!! I thoroughly recommend it. I ordered the Miso Salmon and it was fantastic... Other things I've ordered that were awesome: Crispy Spicy Beef (my personal favourite) Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Orange Chicken Hibachi Steak and probably more... Everything is always great and the service is usually great. I highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory to anyone at the mall who wants to eat well."
Liz L.,"Mountain View, United States",322,676,129,4.0,10/7/2008,"I agree with my friend Min L.  This Cheesecake Factory rocks.  In fact, this was the first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to when I was a wee college freshman and my friend had a craving - 5 of us piled into a borrowed car and headed here for some cheesecake goodness. Came back again a couple nights ago and was not disappointed.  The wait on a Tuesday night around 7:30 for 2 was about 10 minutes, and service was great the whole night.  In fact, I'd venture to say service was as good as I've received at some upscale restaurants. Their ""small salads"" are definitely big enough for a dinner portion, male or female.  I recommend the factory chopped.  The beans and corn cakes that come with the chicken tortillas are also superb. And their georgia peach cocktail is delish, as are their many mojitos.  Who knew?"
Steve P.,"Redwood City, United States",60,85,,5.0,10/5/2011,"Located at the Valley Faire Mall, I've been here twice now. Very nice décor, clean environment, plenty of wait staff. The menu is very extensive, prices are reasonable, and so far the food I've had has been amazing. I've had the Hawiian salad and the Compton salad. Both very tasty and both are pretty big. Oh, and the Reeses Cheesecake is to die for, make sure you save room for dessert."
Tien H.,"San Jose, United States",51,19,,2.0,26/6/2010,The food here is all right and the cocktail drink is so so.  The service I had for the day was not very good considering I have to wait a long time for a refill of water that I requested for a long time.  It took them awhile to bring out my dishes.  I think I would have enjoyed it a little bit more if I had better service and a better waiter.  She was all mean and doesn't look like she wants to be there.  I guess I happened to catch her bad day ...
Hailey K.,"Pacific Grove, United States",4,21,,5.0,9/5/2010,"Always packed,  great service, great food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the bread that they give !! so fresh and warm!! great with butter melting on the bread.! Oatmeal and sourdough !! Huge dish you can share with friends! I usually get Parmasan Chicken that comes with little pasta on side!  I've also had Beer Battered Fish Chips in the past! so good!! really big portion, came with fries and coleslaw!!"
Ailsa B.,"San Jose, United States",90,211,4,4.0,31/3/2008,"3.5 stars, rounding up to four since I'd be willing to go here again. This was my first time eating at this location.  I was part of a group of 7 last night - and I found the experience mostly enjoyable.  Our waitress was really on the ball which was fabulous considering how crowded the place was.   Pluses: HUGE menu with great variety, friendly and attentive wait-staff (not only were our drink and food orders taken in a timely manner, bread and drinks were refilled regularly), the food came quickly and was cooked well, the portions are HUGE (I think most of us brought home extras),   I wish I'd brought a camera to take pics of the food when it arrived though! Very Big Minus: The place is LOUD with people talking and background music that is way too much in the foreground.  One of our party asked for the music to be turned down some, but the waitress said they wouldn't do it.  We were at a fairly small table considering there were 7 of us, but we still had to raise our voices pretty high to be able to hear each other.   I had the fish and chips - which was ok.  In retrospect I wish I'd ordered a pasta dish, those that others in my party ordered looked amazing.  For dessert a friend and I split a Dulce de Leche cheesecake.  It was ok.  Not as caramel-y as I'd hoped and WAY too much whipped cream on the plate (seriously you could hardly see the slice of cheesecake), so I'll definitely try a different type next time."
Alma B.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,4.0,16/12/2013,Wait time was about 1 hr for a party of 8 which wasn't too bad. The service was great and all the food tasted good. Will be back for sure.
Hank L.,"Terrebonne, United States",1,26,,3.0,27/9/2012,"Pricy yes, great food yes, but strange service sometimes especially today!  I ordered a cheesecake curb side but was on hold for close to 10 minutes, and I was told 15 minutes after someon finally picked up...Ok, Easy one would think.  It's a cheese cake and it is already made.  So, got to the curb and called just after the 15 minute mark and was then told 5 more minutes.....waited...waited and about 5 minutes past the the already extra 5 minutes minutes I actually had to walk in and ask for my cheese cake. I went to the counter and waited, paid and they finally gave me my cheese cake. I graciously took the cake and the Gentleman behind the counter said ""What, no tip?"" And I replied with a smile and said ""Nope.""  I left without telling them that it practically took an act of God to get the cheese cake whereas there was no actualy curb side assistance.  I hope somebody informs the staff that it is completely rude to ask for a tip when the service only consisted of cutting the cake and putting it in a box..."
H T.,"Silicon Valley, United States",158,1024,231,3.0,12/2/2010,"Came here for my yearly Cheesecake Factory outing, what was new to me this year was the calories per slice in their display case. Who would've thought my entire daily caloric intake could be consume by a decadent piece of cheesecake?! sigh. reality is not always pleasant so I chose to skip the cheese cake. Yup, that's right. Didn't even split a piece. Instead just had my usual entree - the portabella mushroom sandwich ($10.95) which was really good (either that or I was really hungry). The service was good and there was a wait (as always at this location) but we were lucky since it was  late in the evening on a Sunday and got seated within 20 minutes. Unfortunately they don't take reservations and you can't call ahead to add your name to the waitlist. Parking is always a challenge here so don't be afraid to park far away - it'll help burn off the thousands of calories you're about to consume.  Bottom line, in all I think it's worthy of 3.5 stars - it's good value for your money, a nice atmosphere, but just wish they had more vegetarian options and a healthier menu but am glad that they at least publicly advertise their nutrition content. yay for honesty."
Archie R.,"Moss Beach, United States",899,695,12,4.0,24/3/2007,"Protion contrrol. Poritiion cnotrol. Potron control. Portoin contorl. Portion contrtol. Yeah, they can't spell it either."
ANDY K.,"Campbell, United States",6,58,,2.0,15/2/2008,"Good food but over-priced. I do not know why this place is always so crowded. Seriously-it's just food. It's like so many other places; you go there to keep up with the Joneses.  Biggest offense: ads in the menu. Big full-page ads. Why? I'm here to eat, not to buy laser eye surgery. Lame. I was also  a little put-off during my last visit because my waiter was a bit of a young punk and his breath was atrocious; further punctuating this appetite suppressant was the obvious fact the he smokes like a chimney. Gross - and very likely a singular event."
Eladio S.,"San Jose, United States",110,138,5,3.0,6/4/2009,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory numerous times. First time being in Union Square in the City back when this was the only location.  I've always been pleased with the food at Cheesecake Factory. They have such a wide selection of dishes. It takes me a while just to figure out what I want.  I was here about a week ago for brunch which prompted me to write this review. I ordered a Belgium Waffle that was insanely good. I had a drank a bit the night before (my BDay), so the waffle was the perfect thing to eat to soak up all the remaining Patron in my system. I'd definitely go back for some Brunch or any other meal of the day."
Chester Y.,"Berkeley, United States",22,12,17,2.0,21/8/2006,"This place looks like they took their design cues from the general look of Tuscan villas then mixed in the vomit of a Cirque du Soleil art director. It's difficult to describe and nobody at the table could figure out what the motif was. Were I to title the aesthetic, I would call it ""Ghetto Bellagio"".  More tackyness came via the laminate-flipbook menus: every couple of pages is an advertisement for one of the businesses in the mall. And it doesn't need further cluttering. One could see that their corporate executive chef wondered to himself, ""should we go with Cal-Ital, Asian fusion, American coffee shop, dessert bakery, or Tex-Mex? Well I'll be damned if you limit me to a menu with any sense of coherency! I can do it all!""  Anyway...  I rather liked my salad. Baby lettuce with a fruity vinaigrette that was maybe a little bit too liberally applied, but well within the boundaries of judiciousness. My parents had an endive-based salad with blue cheese and other interesting leafies.   We all shared the ""Fresh Artichoke Fire-Roasted with a Spicy Vinaigrette"" and the ""Fresh Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Eggroll"" appetizers. The artichoke was quite nice, well-roasted and seasoned, but the avocado eggroll was precisely the disaster you would expect. Cut on the bias, they seemed like floppy spearheads as the eggroll skin was so non-crunchy that it was almost chewy. Normally I wouldn't order something quite so preposterous, but a paternal directive had been handed down, dictating that ""green"" appetizers be chosen. Plus, I was pretty curious as to what an avocado eggroll would taste like.  Anyway, by that point, we'd been reminded of one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Cheesecake Factory: portions so large they are of comical, Dagwoodsian proportions.  The avocado eggroll monstrosity could have been an entree --- and I guess it would be, if anyone were demented enough to eat avocado eggrolls as their main course.  By that point, I don't think a single one of us was actually hungry any longer. I was busy trying to steal water from my father's glass to dilute my strawberry lemonade (which had a syrup/water ratio akin to that of molasses) when our waiter brought out our entrees. For a moment, I forgot whether we were having dinner or staging an eating contest.  I had the ""Honey-Maple Pork Tenderloin,"" which came as a sliced log of pork arrayed on top of three full-sized ice-cream-scoops of dense mashed potatoes. This was flanked by a pound of steamed, diced carrots, and about two pounds of steamed broccoli. My father, a great proponent of prominent vegetable content, almost shat himself in envy when he saw my plate, because his ""Farfalle with Chicken and Mushrooms,"" which was a creamy sea of off-whiteness, nary a fleck of green in sight.  The Moms had the ""Herb Encrusted Filet of Salmon,"" which were two salmon filets leaned up against a scale replica of the Matterhorn, fashioned out of mashed potatoes. M.'s ""Grilled Pork Chops,"" had a similarly-geological mashed potato sierra. At this point, the overarching culinary philosophy of Cheesecake Factory had been illustrated for us: bountiful amounts of mass quantities.  As would be expected, the quantity had an inverse relationship with quality. My pork tenderloin was dry and bland and the sauce's only utility lay in pooling around the broccoli as glaze of cloying slime. The mashed potatoes were too dense and devoid of flavor. The steamed broccoli and carrots were, well, steamed broccoli and carrots --- except for the broccoli, which had been Ghostbustered by the aforementioned syrupy effluvium.  I traded for some of my veggies for some of my dad's pasta. The farfalle was alright, and copious, but the chicken tasted more or less like the steamed vegetables, only with a chicken breast texture. When my mother and I remarked on this, my father said, ""What do you expect? Chicken is chicken.""   Correspondingly, pork is pork. M.'s pork chops tasted like the chicken, only with a pork chop texture. Given that, I didn't feel the need to try any of my brother's chicken marsala, and was downright scared of trying my mother's filet of salmon. I was afraid the salmon would taste like chicken, only with salmon texture. Had that been the case, frankly, it would have freaked me out.  The good thing was that our tiramisu cheesecake tasted like tiramisu cheesecake, and not like chicken with a cheesecake texture. Actually, in all seriousness, it was pretty damn good. But, by then, it wasn't feasible to eat much of anything else.   And that's the story at Cheesecake Factory: everyone brings home a bunch of food in leftover boxes, packaged nicely enough that one almost wants to eat the same shitty food the next day.  [Note: This was a write-up from a visit four years ago. But the point of a chain is to be consistent, even if in mediocrity.]"
Valerie B.,"Union City, United States",13,109,2,5.0,18/2/2011,"Wasabi Crusted Ahi and the Jambalya are my absolute favorites. I would love to try more on the menu, but I always end up choosing one of the two. I love their food and their service. The cheesecake....yummy! My ultimate favorite right now is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. I also like their Oreo and the Pumpkin cheesecakes. Always a favorite place to eat for special occasions."
Barb B.,"San Jose, United States",134,619,30,1.0,16/9/2006,"This seems like a place for large, loud groups who like to sit and chat and take pictures of each other while giggling annoyingly in between eating. True-the portions are jai-normous, food so-so. wait time ridiculous...but I think its for the wanna-be-seen crowds, at least in the evenings. My salad was so large, I could have split it with 3 people. This was my first time (and last) there and how was I supposed to know I was getting two heads of lettuce?? Don't go here if you hate, crowds, picture taking gigglers, and your mother used to tell you at dinner...""eat all your food, don't you know there are people STARVING in this world!!!"" And, I am not too enamored by staff who tell gripers to ""deal with it""---as anyone who has worked in the service industry will tell you, the customer is your base."
Hank T.,"San Jose, United States",39,44,,5.0,8/5/2011,"Took our whole group here for Mother's day brunch. Terrific. Johnathon, our waiter, was attentive beyond belief. Their coffee machine went down and they made a run to Starbucks with big pots to soothe the savage beasts. The food was hot, attractively presented, tasty and plentiful. None of us licked our platters clean. Just too damn much.Clean and well-lighted. You won't go wrong, particularly if you have a reservation and show up early."
Christina Y.,"Union City, United States",79,323,19,2.0,1/9/2006,"Cheesecake Factory = OVERRATED I went here for the first time not too long ago. With all the hype going on about Cheesecake Factory, I had high hopes. So I came here with high expectations & left unsatisfied. Maybe it was my fault for choosing something like pasta, but even so.. shouldn't it at LEAST taste good and NOT be obvious that it was previously frozen?? Maybe I'll try something else next time, but I have no reason to go back anytime soon. Cheesecake wasn't even ALL THAT either. :P"
Mike S.,"San Jose, United States",261,101,23,2.0,22/6/2006,Gigantor portions of mediocre food.  Extremely long waits for unclimatic dinners.  Waitstaff looks unkempt & uncaring.  But the cheesecakes!  The cheesecakes are to die for.  Order one to go & enjoy in the comfort of your own home.
Julie K.,"New York, United States",226,418,883,4.0,12/3/2007,"since there's no 'Cheesecake Factory' in NY, I had to go...  my ex co-worker, she had to pay for my whole meal and original cheesecake..  as I expected the food was just perfectly creamy (for crab salad?? no way...), lemonade was hilariously sweet (where's lemon??), and the cheesecake.. the only REASON why i wanted to go that place... was... ummm...  1 MORE, please~   @.@ it was early dinner (not really...), we could get the booth... nice service..  and the waiter was so silly...   3 stars for only cheesecake itself...  and 1 star tip for the waiter..   =)"
Katie T.,"Pleasanton, United States",60,39,3,2.0,10/5/2007,"Alright, the food is okay--not great--but bordering good. The menu is huge and so are the portions. With that said, I still can't stand this place. The wait is invariably ridiculous and their system of making servers sort of share tables is frustrating. One person comes to greet you and bring you drinks, another takes your order. The first person comes back and brings you your food. You ask for a refill and they tell you that they'll make sure your server gets that to you right away. Dagnabbit, who is my server??? Why is it that the person who seems to be doing all the running around doesn't get the tip? And why can't I ever get a refill? You just gave me four pounds of pasta, can I have another water please?  Please, sah! 'Ave some pity on me poor, parched soul and give me a refill, guv'na!!! I'm not blaming the servers, I know they're slammed with the bazillion other people demanding things in this gigantic restaurant with behemoth servings. It's the whole system. The three different cheesecake factories I've been to have all been like this, and I've tried to give them a chance multiple times. Also, the food is so rich that if you order an appetizer, you barely dig into your meal, and my boyfriend has gotten a stomach ache off those boneless buffalo wings--twice! Not a fluke! I scorn you, Cheesecake Factory. Even though your avocado egg rolls are dee-lish and your cheesecakes are a fanciful glutton's dream, I want nothing to do you with you any more. We are over."

But, by then, it wasn't feasible to eat much of anything else.   And that's the story at Cheesecake Factory: everyone brings home a bunch of food in leftover boxes, packaged nicely enough that one almost wants to eat the same shitty food the next day.  [Note: This was a write-up from a visit four years ago. But the point of a chain is to be consistent, even if in mediocrity.]"

I love their food and their service. The cheesecake....yummy! My ultimate favorite right now is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. I also like their Oreo and the Pumpkin cheesecakes. Always a favorite place to eat for special occasions."
Barb B.,"San Jose, CA",134,619,30,1.0,9/16/2006,"This seems like a place for large, loud groups who like to sit and chat and take pictures of each other while giggling annoyingly in between eating. True-the portions are jai-normous, food so-so. wait time ridiculous...but I think its for the wanna-be-seen crowds, at least in the evenings. My salad was so large, I could have split it with 3 people. This was my first time (and last) there and how was I supposed to know I was getting two heads of lettuce?? Don't go here if you hate, crowds, picture taking gigglers, and your mother used to tell you at dinner...""eat all your food, don't you know there are people STARVING in this world!!!"" And, I am not too enamored by staff who tell gripers to ""deal with it""---as anyone who has worked in the service industry will tell you, the customer is your base."
Hank T.,"San Jose, CA",39,44,,5.0,5/8/2011,"Took our whole group here for Mother's day brunch. Terrific. Johnathon, our waiter, was attentive beyond belief. Their coffee machine went down and they made a run to Starbucks with big pots to soothe the savage beasts. The food was hot, attractively presented, tasty and plentiful. None of us licked our platters clean. Just too damn much.Clean and well-lighted. You won't go wrong, particularly if you have a reservation and show up early."
Christina Y.,"Union City, CA",79,323,19,2.0,9/1/2006,"Cheesecake Factory = OVERRATED I went here for the first time not too long ago. With all the hype going on about Cheesecake Factory, I had high hopes. So I came here with high expectations & left unsatisfied. Maybe it was my fault for choosing something like pasta, but even so.. shouldn't it at LEAST taste good and NOT be obvious that it was previously frozen?? Maybe I'll try something else next time, but I have no reason to go back anytime soon. Cheesecake wasn't even ALL THAT either. :P"
Mike S.,"San Jose, CA",261,101,23,2.0,6/22/2006,Gigantor portions of mediocre food.  Extremely long waits for unclimatic dinners.  Waitstaff looks unkempt & uncaring.  But the cheesecakes!  The cheesecakes are to die for.  Order one to go & enjoy in the comfort of your own home.
Julie K.,"New York, NY",226,418,883,4.0,3/12/2007,"since there's no 'Cheesecake Factory' in NY, I had to go...  my ex co-worker, she had to pay for my whole meal and original cheesecake..  as I expected the food was just perfectly creamy (for crab salad?? no way...), lemonade was hilariously sweet (where's lemon??), and the cheesecake.. the only REASON why i wanted to go that place... was... ummm...  1 MORE, please~   @.@ it was early dinner (not really...), we could get the booth... nice service..  and the waiter was so silly...   3 stars for only cheesecake itself...  and 1 star tip for the waiter..   =)"
Katie T.,"Pleasanton, CA",60,39,3,2.0,5/10/2007,"Alright, the food is okay--not great--but bordering good. The menu is huge and so are the portions. With that said, I still can't stand this place. The wait is invariably ridiculous and their system of making servers sort of share tables is frustrating. One person comes to greet you and bring you drinks, another takes your order. The first person comes back and brings you your food. You ask for a refill and they tell you that they'll make sure your server gets that to you right away. Dagnabbit, who is my server??? Why is it that the person who seems to be doing all the running around doesn't get the tip? And why can't I ever get a refill? You just gave me four pounds of pasta, can I have another water please?  Please, sah! 'Ave some pity on me poor, parched soul and give me a refill, guv'na!!! I'm not blaming the servers, I know they're slammed with the bazillion other people demanding things in this gigantic restaurant with behemoth servings. It's the whole system. The three different cheesecake factories I've been to have all been like this, and I've tried to give them a chance multiple times. Also, the food is so rich that if you order an appetizer, you barely dig into your meal, and my boyfriend has gotten a stomach ache off those boneless buffalo wings--twice! Not a fluke! I scorn you, Cheesecake Factory. Even though your avocado egg rolls are dee-lish and your cheesecakes are a fanciful glutton's dream, I want nothing to do you with you any more. We are over."
