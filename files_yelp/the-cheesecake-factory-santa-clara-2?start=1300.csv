Janelle R.,"Marina, United States",32,103,5,5.0,30/3/2010,They have new breakfast items on their menu! I dare you to try the lemon ricotta pancakes. I didn't even need syrup they were so good.
Samira A.,"San Jose, United States",110,64,15,4.0,1/3/2010,"Delicious place and great service.  My only complain is the parking situation. Since it is in a mall, I hardly find a good parking spot, so either go really early or valet your car. They do not take reservations so if you are planning on having a big party, go early to get a table!"
Jennifer O.,"San Jose, United States",24,46,,5.0,17/9/2010,my mom and i's favorite after shopping lunch/dinner spot. usually very crowded on the weekends no matter what time it is. but on average we try to go there at an odd time so there isnt so many people and wait like 20-30mins.  the wait is worth it to me since all the food is amazing and sometimes you just CRAVE cheesecake and gotta have it! my favorites... Appetizer- FRIED MAC AND CHEESE served in ball form with marinara sauce. its crunchy on the outside and hot n cheesey on the inside.  Lunch or dinner -  BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA herb crusted shrimp with veggies and a light wine sauce(i think) its amazingly good and isnt as heavy feeling as a lot of other creamy pastas. citrus lemony taste of goodness. they have it as a lunch or dinner portion...either way i still go home with left overs. and its really good as a left over!  Dessert- RED VELVET CHEESECAKE i love this because its both cake and cheesecake. the perfect balance! its smooth and creamy. i also love the chocolate tuxedo and the fresh banana cheesecakes.  ive never really had a problem with service here. usually the only poor service are the ones taking ure reservation at the front desk but who cares we dont tip them. hah!  will always come back for lunch with my mother here. woohoo!
Todd J.,"San Jose, United States",0,19,,3.0,15/8/2010,"I give this place 2.5 stars for the food, 3 for service, 2 for atmosphere.   It's quite noisy especially at peak times, and the entrees are rather salty.  The dinner menu is very extensive. It's like reading a novel.  Personally I think giving too many choices is not a good thing; it takes too long to order and contributes to long wait times for tables. Wait times can be insane, like 40+ minutes on Fri/Sat nites at 7.  You need to go early for dinner; before 6p the wait time is under 10 minutes."
Lily N.,"San Jose, United States",12,177,55,5.0,21/4/2008,"This is my favorite casual eating place ever. The food is great for it's price. If you like sashimi I suggest to start off with the tuna cappaggio (spelling?). Its very light and will give room to your entree. Entree sizes are GIANT. Lunch sizes are more than adequate for me. I always get either the miso salmon or the pasta da vinci. I am in LOVE with these dishes. I even love their ice tea! lol. You can't really go wrong with cheesecake factory if youre looking for a casual place to eat. Definently not a place if you want something quiet. Service is typical like any casual place like this. Theyre not really going to spiel you or talk you up wines. But like i said many times before, its a casual place to just come in jeans and get your grub on. The only way cheesecake factory went wrong (though i did not take a star off since this is the steven's creek location) is the Oakridge mall location. I've tried to give this place a second chance. third chance and it had failed me EVERY time. Someone has got to fire the chefs, because my friends and i have tried different dishes, dishes we even thought ""hey they cant mess it up!"" btu they did. Comparing it to the Valley fair location, oakridge's lacks flavor in all its dishes. Its pretty sad."
Amy G.,"San Jose, United States",100,601,104,1.0,23/1/2013,"Have you ever had your money stolen by a waiter before? Well if you'd like that to happen come here. We came in a large party, 15+. We split the check and counted the money 3 times before handing it off to the waiter and getting up to leave. He goes behind us to count the money and then informs us that we are short $20. Ok, so you're telling me, 3 college graduates are unable to count a check for $200+ including tip? He immediately says, ""I SWEAR"" well that is sketchy enough because we never accused you so why would you need to swear? Anyways we didn't want to argue and ruin a good night so we just gave him the so called missing $20 and left. We contacted the manger afterwards to inform them about this and they said they will look into it, check the cameras and call us back in 2 days. Well, they didn't call us back and we had to call them again and he told us the cameras were not pointed in that direction. Great. Well all I must say is, waiter, I hope that $20 was worth losing the 15+ customers because dishonesty is worst than bad food."
Sharon T.,"Santa Clara, United States",169,370,26,1.0,9/7/2007,"i used to love this place for their basil pesto pasta, strawberry lemonade and their bar... [3 stars] however, every time you decide to eat here on a weekend evening, you WILL hear ""happy birthday"" being sung at least three times.  i GUARANTEE it.  *cringes* now, theve taken away my favorite dish and replaced it with really CHEWY bow-tie pasta varieties, and they are TOUGH to chew and flavorless. then, i wanted their yummy artichoke dip, and they brough me a grilled artichoke instead.  not cool.  and what REALLY pissed me off was what they tried to pass off as an onlon ring... please refer to pictures for that one... they were the SADDEST LOOKING ONION RINGS EVER. because of that, one star.  sorry cheesecake.  im sooo over you."
Tiffany K.,"Fremont, United States",904,996,49,1.0,14/10/2007,"WOW, I am surprised this place has so many 3-5 stars. Maybe my tastebuds are off, but Cheesecake Factory is a very good representation of why I do not usually like chain restaurants.  First of all, the menu is way too big here, and nothing on it is very appealing.  I personally do not understand WHY a restaurant needs to bombard their customers with such a large menu and aside from menu options, there's ADVERTISEMENTS in their menu.. why? why? why? They really need to learn that the more simple a menu is, the better.  Also, the food here in my opinion, is absolutely horrible. All of their food taste like the frozen microwave dinners I buy at the supermarket. Every time I've come here, I've gotten bad service.  Last time I was here, our waitress had the audacity to be rude AND roll her eyes at me.  I also feel bad for the uniform here.  The all white suits w/ties is really really unattractive on the females. I know my review may seem to be harsh, but I'm really not that picky.  Check out my other reviews.  I feel like I am too lenient and not picky about restaurants.. But Cheesecake Factory is really one of those places where i CANNOT UNDERSTAND why there is always a wait, and how they even stay successful. Now you must wonder why I've been here a couple of times.  One of my friends love it here, and if it's her turn to choose, she'll pick Cheesecake Factory once in awhile. uGhhhhh.... oooh, last but not least, drinks here aren't good either. honestly, if the food here were cheaper, i wouldn't think so badly of it.  The price really does not equal the quality.  Definitely a quantity over quality restaurant.  Sorry, I like quality in my food."
Danny N.,"Campbell, United States",67,53,,5.0,9/7/2011,"Great service and food and ambience.  Went here for my girlfriend's birthday, and we seated down within 5 mins.  Bread were delicious here, and we got the factory nacho here and its really big and good.  We were full after the bread and nacho.  We also orders pasta with chicken and chipotle sauce and that was pretty good.  And that dish was huge! Had to take that plate Togo since we were full from the appetizers."
Melanie C.,"San Jose, United States",81,279,50,2.0,23/10/2007,"We came here for lunch because CPK had a 35 minute wait. I think I would have preferred to wait. Cheesecake Factory may be awesome for cheesecake, but otherwise, I'm not impressed. The majority of the dishes, including the appetizers, are unnecessarily not vegetarian.  The soups are not vegetarian either.  I appreciate that the staff at least knows, but WHY?  Use veggie stock instead and I can have those yummy corn tamales and macaroni balls! Lacking options, I ordered a pasta dish and a side salad.  I was informed even their side salads were large, so I declined.  But can't you just make less?  I ended up sharing the salad that came with my mother-in-law's pizza.  It was indeed large, and there wasn't enough dressing. I'm just never impressed with Cheesecake Factory...especially when seeing a simple root beer is $3.  Can we say overpriced? I'm also perplexed by the decor.  It's....aesthetically pleasing enough, but I'm disturbed by the numerous allusions to female body parts.  Little paint swoops that look like breasts, some sort of window etching resembling a uterus with Fallopian tubes, and the strange geodesic vulva topping the booth backings.  Not exactly appetizing."
Poops M.,"San Francisco, United States",5,27,,4.0,26/5/2007,"Note: I am only reviewing the bathroom. The men's bathroom is kept clean, and the stalls are reasonably good at keeping down the poops-related noises. The toilet paper is acceptably soft, yet strong. Soap and napkins are available, plentiful, and don't require getting your hands dirty after you've washed them. Generally, a pleasant bathroom experience can be had, if necessary, at the Cheesecake Factory."
Ferdinand L.,"San Jose, United States",723,242,35,2.0,14/1/2013,"I don't normally go to The Cheesecake Factory unless it's some sort of special occasion or what have you, but I ended up going here this past Saturday night  The place was slowing down and the restaurant was starting to look a little empty so I expected the service to be very accommodating and focused; but  I was wrong.  We are asked to wait as our seats are being cleared which took about 5 minutes which wasn't an issue, but when we were told to follow the hostess we walked up and the tables weren't cleared yet, in fact they had us walk around the dining room as a seat was being cleared, (even though the restaurant was half empty).  After we sat down it took quite a bit of time before anyone checked up on us, I want to say more than 10 minutes but I can't be sure because I didn't time it.  After that, our server was sporadic in making sure our stay was pleasant.  The food was still amazing, but as you can tell from some of my previous posts, I'm a stickler for customer service.  At the end of the meal after dropping off our bill, it took almost 15 minutes before my friend and I stood up and walked over to the kitchen to find our server.  Food is great as always here at the factory, but if you get a chance, go to a place that has better service."
Mals A.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,8,,4.0,2/7/2013,"Went here immediately after a terrible experience at Sino (see last post). In short, the gentlemen at the bar (Drake and Chris) were sweet, fed me, and put a smile on my face. Thank you!"
May C.,"San Jose, United States",69,183,3,4.0,13/6/2008,"If you're coming here for dinner, then try to come by 6, AT THE LATEST; otherwise, you'll be stuck there FOREVER.....and I mean, FOREVER, particularly at this location.....  First off, there's no point in giving white bread in the beginning...cause EVERYONE knows it's all about their WHEAT bread. I always tell myself not to eat so much bread before dinner, but it's SOOOO HARD to resist, especially when they serve it to you when it's still nice and hot... and watching the butter, slowly melting aways upon its surface.. Ahhhhh.... Second, this was my first time trying their MISO Salmon! SOOO GOOD! It melts in your mouth, and I ate the ENTIRE platter. And you know damn well that one Cheesecake platter can feed like 4 people, but yet, I was able to manage to eat it all by myself. I probably could've eaten two of the same platter. It was THAT good: served w/ jasmine rice and snow peas. I would highly recommend this dish to everyone.  Third, this was my first time trying their TRES LECHE cheesecake w/ Strawberries. It somewhat had a resemblance of the Strawberry Shortcake Cheesecake from Juniors in NY. It had the whipped cream, the cheesecake filling, the cake, and the strawberries. I would also highy recommend this cheesecake dessert.  Again, try to come early; otherwise, don't even bother going. There's no point, and you'll just be grumpy and will end up not enjoying your food.  Other must trys:  Grilled Skirt Steak Crispy Beef Chicken Madeira Luau Salad Garlic Noodles w/ Chicken and Shrimp Strawberry Lemonade"
T D.,"Long Beach, United States",690,519,1402,2.0,5/3/2008,"I've never been a fan of their food. I've been to many locations various times, but never had an exceedingly good experience there. The only thing I get here is their cheesecakes. I'm a fatty mc fat fat so I'm always craving for a slice of heaven. Their desserts are to die for. But if you have no other choice, but to go here...for lunch I usually get the The Navajo, dinner I'll get the Miso Salmon or Chicken Madeira. And save room for dessert, that's for damn sure! EDIT (3/5/08): I just had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake...best cheesecake ever, it was like a party in my mouth."
Daddy O.,"Santa Cruz, United States",168,538,118,3.0,19/11/2007,"Shopping for a new cell phone late on Sunday night at Westfield Valley Fair leaves one with few dinner options. We were left to choose from: - The food court (no.  just...no.) - ""Sushi Boat"" (Mall sushi on a Sunday?  Get real) - California Pizza Kitchen (AKA Overpriced Pizza Kitchen) - Cheesecake Factory Not the best selection...all I can say is holy carp.  Yes, that's right.  Holy carp.  Holy carp = holy mackerel x 5 Anyway.  Good thing we were busied with programming our new cell phones because the wait at 8:00 on a Sunday night was ridiculous!  I think we spent 40 minutes sitting outside piddling time away...and if we'd been smart about it, we'd have just spent that time driving to Los Gatos or someplace offering better food.  Live and learn I suppose. As far as Cheesecake Factories go, this one was a bit sub-standard.  The wait staff, while pleasant, were operating at 250% capacity and it showed.  It took 10 minutes for someone to come over and offer us bread and water, and a waitress dropped a -whole tray- of dishes right behind me shortly thereafter.  Mid way through our meal, our servers switched and we had a new girl who came by to try and take our food away and offer us dessert while we were still eating.  Oy.  This is where basic powers of observation come into play. The food was prepared adequately, but was nothing I would write home about. I don't care how big the platter is; if I'm dropping $14+ on some fish tacos, they'd better be out-frickin-standing (they weren't), because I know I can walk up the street to taqueria vallarta and get them for a third of the price and triple the flavor.   I choked down my overpriced bland tacos and of course had to waddle out because as most people know, Cheesecake Factory don't do ""portion control""."
Stephanie Y.,"San Jose, United States",24,61,,4.0,28/6/2010,"ahh. Cheesecake Factory.  With a menu that could pass as a short novel, I find that I order the same things because it would take just too darn long to find a new dish.  I often order pastas here because the portions are huge and they're so tasty. The downside is that many of the dishes are packed with calories, so if you're trying to watch your weight, share the dishes with friends, or wait to visit this place. In general, whether it's pasta, or salad, or something different, their portions are very hearty, and probably worth two meals for a female, and enough to stuff a male. I absolutely love the complimentary bread, warm and fresh from the oven. Two kinds-but everyone knows the brown bread is better than the sour dough (at least in my opinion).  My favorite dish has got to be the Chicken Bellagio. It's a really good deal, with hearty portions at a lower price than some of their regular menu pastas. The chicken is lightly breaded and moist, with a bed of pesto pasta sitting in a light cream sauce. It's topped off with fresh arugula and large pieces of prosciutto. All in all a great combination of flavors.  This place can get very busy at night, especially on the weekends, and you can't make reservations without a larger party (around 8 or 10 people), so I'd get here early if you can. I've waited an hour to eat here with only a party of two. But the bread is just so good...it was worth the wait. Stephs' Recommendations: Chicken Bellagio (it's on the Specials Menu, so you won't find this on their regular menu) Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake"
Melody C.,"Fremont, United States",118,36,6,5.0,15/2/2009,"I come here all the time just for calamari.  The rest of the food is kind of hit or miss.  BBQ chicken pizza = 3 stars. A bit too sweet. 5 cheese ziti = 4 stars. I love this but everyone else thinks it's bland. Some pasta or other with dried tomatoes = 1 star. Smokey and awful. But the calamari alone is worth 5 stars.... Why doesn't anyone else do it so well :) PS. The cheesecake is tasty (expensive) but the strawberry shortcake is great if you're looking for ""something else"""
Eric K.,"Dublin, United States",45,1116,9,2.0,30/5/2007,"Any one read Fast Food Nation? This is the kinda place that they talk about from the standpoint that the portions get bigger to help justify the prices that they charge. The quality of the food is in line with places such as Chili's, TGIFs, Applebees....  wrap it in a setting where they have spongepainted walls and pillars and stuff, add 50% and make you wait 3x as long.... that's what the Cheese-house comes out to be. These places are perfect examples of the ""yes, we're busy, so you can wait, and you'll like it."" They don't take reservations, and they won't seat large groups until the last seating of the night, then they'll give poor service, because they already lock-in their 20% gratuity for parties 6 or more.  but they try to compensate by throwing a free appetizer at you which prolly costs them like $1.00 to make even though they are gonna make a killing on everything else. Yeah... so I try not to go here, and it's not a real hard try either."
Naomi Y.,"Los Gatos, United States",666,206,904,5.0,1/11/2008,"Pros: I have never gotten bad service here. The appetizer platter is delish. I LOVE LOVE the Chicken Madeira, Hibachi Steak, and  Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.  Some of my other favorites are the Miso Salmon, The Jambalaya with extra sauce, and Scampi (the prawns are huge!), and the Tuna Tataki Salad, and their version of a philly cheesesteak is very flavorful and the bread is perfect!  Their mashed potatoes (thank God!!) are fresh and creamy! I love their complimentary bread too; Sourdough and wheat (love the wheat). You can even buy the loaf of bread for 7 bucks. Desserts: The Tiramisu Cake (NOT CHEESECAKE!) is the BEST I have EVER HAD..... The Next best desserts are the pumpkin cheesecake, Dulce De Leche cheesecake, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and I love the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake!!! mmmmhmmm!!! So 5 stars easy because service, quality, and those two things are worth the price! Also, this place is consistent. Cons: The parking can really suck at the Valley Fair Mall location. It's a frenzy looking for a parking spot on a regular day! BUT when Christmas is around the corner just go to the valet and get your ticket validated to save you some 20-40 minutes of scarce parking frenzy.  Floor can be really slippery, so watch out ladies in your stilettos Lastly, they DON'T take reservations EVEN for LARGE parties. WALK INS ONLY and the WHOLE party or MORE than Half the party has to be there to GET SAT... SIGH.. Also, if the party is more than 2 then the wait is at minimum 45 minutes at dinner time. At lunch time I typically get sat right away or wait maybe 10 minutes max. Have a friend run in and put your name on the wait list as you search for a spot. Pretty much this place is consistent with the pros and cons. So, if you go here you know what to expect and that's why you are usually prepared for it.  ;)"
