Jen S.,"San Jose, United States",1251,135,33,4.0,1/11/2008,"I can order almost anything on the menu and know that it will be delicious.  I've never been disappointed with the food here. My personal favorites: Buffalo Blasts, Bang Bang Chicken, Chicken Madeira, Thai Lettuce Wraps. The only thing that sucks is the whole lobby situation.  I wish they would put more places to sit because every single time I come here, the lobby is packed with people just standing around, eyeing all of the benches waiting for the next party's pager to buzz, so they can swoop up on a seat.  Another thing that's kind of dumb is that once your pager goes off, you have to wait again in another line! The service is hit or miss. Some of the wait staff are EXCELLENT and some others are just way too slow or do not come around to ask if you need anything, unless you flag them down and finally catch them after several attempts."
Donna Z.,"San Jose, United States",630,557,106,4.0,15/9/2007,"I worked here a few years ago, and I'm sure most people have already been here. With that being said, I know the menu very well, and even got the opportunity to try *close* to every dish and dessert while training.   And since the menu is overwhelming at times, here they are, my EXPERT suggestions (you can thank me later): Appetizer: Roadside Sliders Salad: Luau Chicken Salad  Pasta: Louisiana Chicken Pasta (it's flippin' AMAZING) Burger: Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger (a guy favorite) Lunch: Lunch Pizza (Pepperoni) and Salad (Caesar) Asian-Inspired: Crispy Spicy Beef (SO GOOD) Seafood: Shrimp Scampi, although the Jambalaya was a customer favorite Vegetarian (besides salad): Grilled Cheese Sandwich---also one of the cheapest meals on the menu *ask for a side of their ranch, it's muy delicioso, for the fries and sandwich Sunday Brunch: French Toast or CA omelet Cheesecake: Pumpkin (when in season), otherwise, Tuxedo Dessert (non-cheesecake): Factory Mud Pie Booze: ANY of it, but esp. the Strawberry Martini, Typhoon Punch, or Pink Lemonade This list may seem massive, but my goal was to pick apart the [even more] massive menu and point out the best in several categories.  Remember, too, that pretty much everything is big enough to share/take half home. Bonus: Open until 12:30am on Fri and Sat nights. (Took away one star strictly for the service, which is definitely hit or miss in the dining area--but the bar is always top-notch)."
Veronica G.,"San Francisco, United States",204,461,,1.0,17/9/2007,"I am not a fan of any employer who treats their employees like slaves.  No, really. The kitchen staff is overworked and underpaid (and you know what that leads to....yeah it's like that at this location too...if you've worked in the restaurant business you know what I mean) as are the waitstaff. If you've lasted more than 3-6 months, you're an oldtimer to the crew. As far as their menu goes, it's the same at any of their locations.  The appetizers are your best bet in terms of ""bang for your buck"". The entrees are big as everyone says (leftovers). And the desserts? WAY too rich for me (but then again I work in the confectionary business so yes, I don't eat a lot of sweet stuff). But the treatment of employees.... There is NO ONE who works at this place who can fesibly live on their own (meaning their own apartment) within a five to ten mile radius of this place (unless they are (a) a bartender or (b) provide superhero service (as in freeze time a la Evie from Out Of This World and finish preparing your food while you're stuck in the moment) and collect on tips.  So yeah, you mess with my friends, you mess with me. Deal. I'll be ordering to go from now. In SF. At least if their waiters, kitchen staff need a 2nd job they have better options than those offered near Valley Fair. Pthhh!!!!!"
Vee D.,"Santa Clara, United States",1,60,19,1.0,19/3/2013,"On a separate occasion, we had terrible service, order was not what we asked for and the cheesecake... was melted... i'm not sure what was going on there.  pure dissapointment"
Ninja C.,"Santa Clara, United States",17,175,24,2.0,11/4/2007,"I would give Cheesecake Factory a higher score if they offered the option of calling ahead of time or took reservations to cut down the horrible wait time.  Aside from typically having to wait an hour to be seated at a table, there is virtually no place to wait.  Oh wait...the bar!  Of course, so I can pay $8 for a $2 drink.   Aside from the wait, the food is OK.  I mean, I think you could feed a small country for a month with all the food Cheesecake must put out on a nightly basis.  The wait staff is usually pleasant though I've never seen the same waiter/waitress twice.   Of course, the big draw is the cheesecake and the various types they offer.  I agree with previous recommendations:  order the cheesecake to go and laugh at the people who have waited 55 minutes (but are about to be called up in 5)."
Sue Ann D.,"Fremont, United States",185,260,2,4.0,6/3/2008,"Too be honest, I don't really hate this restaurant like so many of my fellow yelpers, but I do understand why people hate it/get frustrated/think it's overrated, etc, etc.......... However, I don't hate it due to the following reasons: 1) I have had some good memories and times at this particular location with friends and family that I hold dear to my heart 2) While the food can be overwhelming, and nothing short of GIGANTIC portions, you can find something to share to not make you feel like a baby whale rolling out of the restaurant. 3) The drinks I've had have been strong, and with just the right amount of kick.....mmmmmm, me likey. 4) I've always (knock on wood!) had great service 5) and the number one reason I really like it there?    they don't look at me and whoever I'm with like we're loons when we're stalking the place at 10:55am just to avoid the 2+hour wait (minus 1 star) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Jay P.,"San Francisco Bay, United States",10,144,57,4.0,9/11/2010,"They have a large selection of food. That can be good and that can be bad unless you have a real good idea of what you want before you walk in or you'll sit there skimming the menu for quite a while. Hahah! Had the Herb Crusted Salmon, today. It came out perfect, tender, and juicy. I chose green beans and asparagus as my sides. I highly suggest it. The ambiance is nice and the staff is friendly. Plus... for you shoppers out there, it's next to the Valley Fair Mall and Santana Row."
Annie S.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,8,,2.0,27/7/2013,"Our server was great, but the hosts made a really bad first impression, not because they were intentionally rude, they just seemed too stressed out by the seating chart ,or whatever, to welcome customers. If one of the three or four hosts standing behind the podium, would have looked up and smiled, I would have asked where to leave my name, but that didn't happen. They were looking down at the computer and speaking with each other about seating arrangements. Meanwhile new customers were entering through two sets of double doors,  it was confusing which customers had arrived first and the people who were more aggressive (hungry?) were moving forward toward no host in particular.  I'm a teacher and I know how important a seating chart is, but the hosting station isn't backstage. It is front and center, and when the curtain is up the hosts make the customer feel welcome or not."
Csndra L.,"Anaheim, United States",5,93,2,4.0,16/7/2008,"Obviously this one was better than the one I last went. So I left my phone and I forgot about it somewhere inside the mall, and our waiter comes by and he saw me freaking out. How accommodating when he offered me his own cell phone to call my own in order for me to track it down, being blessed my phone was recovered. Otherwise my night would've been seriously fucked up, so my bf came back and our waiter asked if everything is okay now. -1 star because we sat next to a bunch of fat corporate men -,-...one of them nearly took up my seat, christ..."
Freshfoeonefifth S.,"Fremont, United States",301,4,3,2.0,6/6/2013,"First time here and probably will never return. I heard great things only to discover otherwise. My twin sister picked this place for our 25th birthday because she knows I love Jambalaya Pasta. I eat a lot with my family so we tend to fine in large groups. Cheesecake Factory seemed accommodating. But upon arrival we were told to wait for a manager just for a quote wait time. The wait was less than about ten minutes until we were seated. But there were no formal greetings just wait . We were surprised at to be seated because we were under the impression that we were waiting for a superior. The waiter/waitress were not attentive. I noticed that they would take 2-3 orders at a time and jump from person to person. It took them 20 minutes to bring me my beer. That's 20 minutes AFTER all other beverages and appetizers were served. Not only did they lag on my beer, I waited yet another 20 minutes for my pasta. All the while my entire party were at the end of their dish. The jambalaya pasta was a complete fail. Not only because oft experience at the time but because it genuinely lacked all the authentic flavors. The added chicken was bland and tasteless. The Cajun shrimp was boring. The taste uneventful in any way . The vegetables undercooked. Also, I hate the fact that restaurants like such charge a higher percentage ""gratuity fee"" when their Hospitality does not justify such demand. They are not fit to accommodate a larger paying party. 15 people with No room an second to none eating space. When I see 2-6 parties eat with lounge luxury. So, in conclusion: I was very Very Excited and Eager to try Cheescake Factory for the very first time. But to no avail. I hope people can appreciate the constructive Criticism. On a good note: My Lovely Gf Swears by their Red Velvet CheesCake. ""The Bomb.Com"" :)"
Azizi A.,"Newport Beach, United States",126,578,1735,3.0,15/12/2008,"I went there today and the food was okay, I like their bread. I have been to this location in the past and I have also visted many other locations. The service at this location seems like it has improved, but usually the wait is long (much longer then they say). But the great thing about this place is that they have a large variety of items and the atmosphere is nice. So you can eat whatever your in the mood for. Its not bad for a chain restaurant."
Chris O.,"San Jose, United States",62,15,36,5.0,29/7/2010,"Lemoncello is delicious. Sponge cake is the shit. Lady fingers, lemon marscapone, sugared strawberries. Can't go wrong."
Kristin O.,"Cupertino, United States",72,220,42,4.0,28/3/2008,"This place is a normal food kinda place.  They have a little of EVERYTHING so you can never go wrong.  They only specialize in their cheesecake...which is really fluffy, so I'm not sure if it's real cheesecake.  I'd give it three stars...but the extra star is given for the excellent customer service. I took my friend out for his birthday dessert, and I had the waiter/bartender guy stick as many ""crazy candles"" on two pieces of cheesecake (crazy candles were purchased at Safeway).  He and a birthday singing crew came out with the two pieces of cheese cake, decorated, and glowing with 16 candles (he was turning 24).  The candles were hanging off mounds of whipped cream over whipped cream, on the sides of the cakes, on top of the cakes, and they were all so friendly and happy to be part of the whole shebang!  If you have an event, the workers there are happy to help you get the celebration you want and need :)"
Marlene B.,"San Jose, United States",115,72,27,4.0,13/12/2008,"One of the bad things about The Cheesecake Factory is that there are SO many delicious items on their menu that it's hard to order.  Appetizers are SO good.  The kids love the nachos and I love the avocado egg rolls and the Spring rolls.  I have never had a dish I didn't love. Service is GREAT!  I've never had bad service.  One waiter was the best I've EVER, EVERRRRR had.  He got a fat tip. Of course it's always beautiful and clean.  Honestly, the only truly bad thing I could say is for families and middle class folks, it's a special occasion place.  Although it doesn't break the bank, it can get pricey."
Ewa L.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,8,3,3.0,4/9/2013,"I had an awesome salad there yesterday, it look beautiful and tasted pretty good too, my husband had a burrito, which he liked as well, but when I tried to look up their nutritional info I realized that they don't have it.  I thought it was standard especially in California to provide that information, have to say was disappointed they don't have.  I like to know what I am eating."
Dianne H.,"Milpitas, United States",0,19,,4.0,23/5/2011,"I love this place! Only gave it 4 stars because I do not like places that do not take reservations. The food there is delicious, and they have a bunch you can choose from. From pasta, to burgers, to soup, and sandwiches, they most likely will have what you are looking for. The drinks are alright, if you are ordering anything alcoholic, you must try the Flying Gorrilla! It's not that strong, but it taste delicious. Their signature drinks are good, but if you wanted anything from the bar, I don't feel as if their drinks are very good.  Their bread is yummy and their staff is very nice.  The tiramisu cheesecake is delicious! Their cheesecake menu is to die for, so you must try!"
Van N.,"Milpitas, United States",507,202,29,4.0,18/2/2008,"I love cheesecake factory and their book for a menu.  The variety is huge here and I've tried mostly all the dishes and they are good.  One thing I haven't been able to do though is to try every cheesecake they have to offer.  The only problem I have is that I usually have to wait for a table and they don't take reservations.  I also like the healthy portions they provide.  Even ""I"" have to bring home leftovers and that is saying something. Must try = avocado eggrolls"
Ryan L.,"San Jose, United States",7,41,,3.0,30/8/2013,All around average. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad for about $10 total during their lunch special and enjoyed it. The portion was enough to have some extra for leftovers. Service was slow and they never did get back to us with that order of bread.
Wendy T.,"San Jose, United States",943,206,139,4.0,11/2/2008,"This is the only place( that I know ) that makes the best shrimp and chicken Jambalaya pasta! I always get EXTRA sauce because its a little bit dry. I love eating spicy food so I put extra chili flakes and than add hot sauce. O yeah EXTRA chesse please! haha  When I want to try something else besides the pasta I get the Salmon, which I liked alot, I like how their portions are big. I always end up taking it home and eating it the next day.  I don't usually like cheesecake either but I have to say this is the only place I'd ever eat cheesecake at! The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite! O and if you aren't a big fan of Cheesecake you definitely have to try the Strawberry shortcake! HEAVEN!!"
Leah C.,"San Jose, United States",173,31,5,3.0,10/1/2011,"I came here with my husband because we got a gift card from our friends. It was a Sunday during lunch and I thought we were going to be waiting forever. Luckily, I think because there were only two of us, we were seated within 20 minutes. Sometimes I really like the fact that when I go to Cheesecake Factory I know what to expect and what kind of food I'll get. Since I've been going there for years I know exactly what to order and I know it'll be good. My usuals are the Miso Salmon or the Hibachi Steak. I've tried other food but have found that I don't like them as much as I like those. As for the cheesecake, suprisingly I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake at all, but I do like the Tres Leches and the Raspberry Truffle."
