Kennedy L.,"Milpitas, United States",0,7,,2.0,1/11/2014,"This was my first time here and I was quite excited. My group ordered various things that people order, such as the chicken samosas, the hamburgers, pizza, quesadilla, and pasta. After waiting for thirty minutes, we were served our food. Let me tell you this...we were so disappointed. The hamburgers were alright, but the cheese was kind of eh. When I was served the quesadilla I was very confused with the absence of chicken it. I asked the server what happened and he said they did not add chicken to their quesadillas. It was kind of annoying because on the menu it says they can add chicken in it if you ask. Our pizza wasn't the best, my group agreed it could have been better. Our salad was as if they had plated it and left it for a long time, it was not enjoyable. We ended up having a lot of food left because the food wasn't the most appetizing. Honestly, I do not think I will be coming back here."
cat s.,"Saratoga, United States",0,4,,5.0,21/8/2011,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE. we came here for one of my friend's birthday last week & i did have my doubts originally (i had heard that it wasn't that good) but boy, am i glad we came here! The portions are big so we ended up splitting the lettuce wraps, caesar salad, herb salmon & cajun jumbulaya pasta for 6 people & we had leftovers :)  The food was all reallyyyy good. & the lettuce wraps & caesar salad were not oily at all. the other ones were a bit unhealthy but if you split, you feel less guilty :) The cheesecake is obviously amazing but we had the carmel pecan one & the strawberry one (the strawberry was good!) the carmel pecan one wasnt as good as most people say cheesecake from here is supposed to be...but i dont like caramel much either  The wait time was great! We came in at 8 at were seated in literally 5 minutes!  We had two waitresses because the first one had to go on break, they were both great but i cannot put into words how AMAZING THE FIRST WAITRESS WAS. she was so nice & helpful & gave us her honest opinion  on dishes (not just suggesting expensive stuff) A little pricey but great for special occasions. I will def be coming back!"
PRETTY D.,"Fremont, United States",9,47,1,5.0,24/2/2008,"This is my fav cheesecake factory....me and my husband have had the best service ever!! The waiters are prompt..one time we customized our pasta and the chef actually came to our table to make sure we were satisfied with what we got. The food is good..like any cheesecake factory.. A Plus for service, ample parking available in the mall's parking lot, please make reservations if you intend to go during peak hrs."
Nonik M.,"Los Altos, United States",0,40,23,1.0,28/4/2010,"My husband chewed and almost swallowed a 2 cm piece of metal today. Luckily nothing happen. He lost his appetite, which I do too. The manager came after we report it to the waitress. She kneel down apologized to us. I asked the waitress what that piece came from, he said  that it was a piece of the frying basket. They gave us free on his lunch, 2 piece of cake, and $10 dollar coupon. Did we ate those? Not really, since we lost our appetite duh! And yes we still did not use the coupon yet. Still in trauma."
Ashley J.,"Sacramento, United States",187,29,1,4.0,28/6/2007,"After our waiter walks away with our drink orders... ME: He's a cute gay guy! MY BOYFRIEND: He's gay? How do you know that? ME: Look! He's wearing white pants! MY BOYFRIEND: Um, it's their uniform. ME: Ohhhhh! haha. OOPS... i mean he's... uh, yeah, nevermind. Needless to say we had exceptional service from Mr. Whitepants. He was personable, funny, and punctual. Our drinks were good and so was the food. We took most of our dinner home in a doggy bag, along with a cheesecake for later :) YUMMY, all around."
Vu H.,"Mountain View, United States",6,11,5,3.0,14/3/2011,Had dinner here last night here.  The service was slow and had to ask for refills.  The herb chicken was not tender as I would have liked and way too vinegar tasting.  I do not see myself coming back for dinner anytime soon.
patricia n.,"San Jose, United States",71,111,,4.0,30/1/2010,"i loOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOve good food. and last nite's food @ cheesecake factory was good food! girls night out with my co-workers. food and drinks all  around baby!! and here's my pick of the nite.

Served with Julienne Vegetables, Miso Sauce and Rice. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- i guess you have a choice of how your fish is cooked. being that it was ahi tuna, i asked for ""raw"". it came with rice, tuna, and cooked wasabi in the sauce. not bad at all. very.... different. ehehehe --------------- Banana Cream Cheesecake  -----------------  my ultimate favorite!! light. sweet. fruit. CHEESECAKE!!"
Jackie C.,"San Jose, United States",33,38,26,3.0,4/4/2008,"Holly Molly...can the wait be any longer!!!  So the food is AWESOME, seriously everything that I have ever ordered here has been delicious, but come on now...a hour wait!!! WITH NO WHERE TO SIT!!  Me and my hubby love this place, but its ridiculously crowded all the time, and its rather stressful. The one thing that is quite entertaining and makes the time fly is standing next to the hostess desk and listening to the ""not so bright"" people that come in and ask how long the wait is going to be. Mind you, they ask after walking into a completely crowded room, and when they hear 50 to 75 minutes, they sigh...come on now people!!! So anyways, eat here if its going to be a slow afternoon or a time that you are not starving Marvin like me!! Otherwise, not worth the wait!!"
Danika F.,"San Jose, United States",67,83,,2.0,11/12/2008,Skip the food. Stay for the cheesecake. In love with the French Vanilla. Dont freak out if you go for dinner and they turn down the lights so low that you can barely make out the menu or see the people seating across from you.  Just dont freak....you might cause a scene!
Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, United States",46,359,22,4.0,11/12/2008,"For all the complaints and low ratings that I've seen for this particular  Cheesecake Factory, I have to admit that my experience at this location was great. My party of 3 was seated promptly (maybe we came at the right time, mid-afternoon, on a weekend if you can believe that!) and the service didn't feel fake at all.  The Cheesecake Factory has a LOT of items to choose from their long menu. I even found it surprising that they place ads ON their menu! What's up with that? But whatever you choose here (I got the chicken madiera and non-cheesecake tiramisu), be prepared to either share your meal or ask for ""doggie bags"" because the portions are HUGE (and from my experience, tasted great too). And the bread basket is full of hot bread. Yum! However, if you're just coming here to buy some dessert, you're better off ordering to-go at the bakery. I'd wait for a full meal, but not for the dessert. And here's to hoping I don't experience rubbish service and wait times the next time I go there..."
Nicole B.,"San Jose, United States",21,104,14,4.0,24/2/2011,I absolutely love their cheesecake (given). I am not too crazy about their appetizers or entrees except for the chicken bellagio and the orange chicken.  They are like heaven on a plate.
Robert B.,"Santa Clara, United States",17,7,1,1.0,23/2/2013,"My girlfriend wanted to come here for dinner, initially things went well, our waitress was a total sweetheart. I ordered the steak and salmon combo. When I got it I was very disappointed, the portions looked like they were meant for a child. Whatever I thought ""if it's good everything is ok"" they covered my steak and salmon in a sauce that tasted like it was made from corn syrup and scraping from a burnt pan. Now normally if I don't think something is up to par I'll eat, pay and just not come back. However, this was terrible, I asked my waitress for a dish without sauce. Which she brought. ""Great, now I can eat"" I thought. No, no, while my salmon was at least passable now, my asparagus was over cooked,and my steak was raw, completely raw and cold. This place is a pathetic excuse for a restaurant. I wouldn't ever recommend going here. The food is vomit inducing at worst, mediocre at best. The cooks here should be fired, I wouldn't trust these morons to clean the dishes let alone prepare my food."
Vu T.,"Milpitas, United States",36,121,,4.0,28/6/2006,"This is too freaky that this is my second outting here, but at a different location.  Come on though!  Twice within three days?  I guess my buddy's birthday makes it alright for this sin.  One thing for sure is, I love the late hours that is here, compared to some places that closes earlier. With my constant dining out lately, I had to refrain from indulging like a carnivore, and go with something on the lighter side.  I thought I was able to escape the giant portions with the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad, but I should've known better for the price.  I could've sworn the salad weighed at least 10 pounds.  Although it was quite tasty, I had to bring it home.  There was plenty leftover for all three meals the next day.   I got a chance to sample the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls that my buddy ordered.  It was pretty good, but why would you get sushi at a place like this.  In fact, the one thing that annoyed my was the menu.  Everything seems to be a ""specialty.""  I don't see anything that special.  Sure, change it by 10 percent, and you got yourself a new creation.  This is just some sick way to get patrons to scan the menu, causing more confusion.   I suppose the menu ordeal was saved when our waitress came over.  She was very friendly and helpful.  She came by so much to make sure we were doing ok, she should have joined us for dinner.   I had left just enough room for some dessert sampling.  The Fresh Strawberry Shortcake and the White Chocolate Carmel Latte Cheesecake sealed the deal.   Overall, the evening went well.  We ate, we sang, we paid, we left.  What more do you want from a birthday dinner?"
Melissa S.,"San Jose, United States",941,74,86,4.0,12/12/2009,"The crowded waiting area never phases me at this location. Thank God for the bar area other wise I would totally find myself antzy waiting for party to be called. Came with my bf on a random Thursday after some shopping and remembered that I had a fifty dollar gift card!  score. Ran into an old friend as we headed to the bar and wanted to introduce the bf to her but I was looking around and he was no where to be found! said bye bye to old friend and saw my bf waving me down at the bar like a kid at a candy store...i guess he was hungry, geesh!  Our bartender/waitress was very pleasant and handed us our menus. I ordered for the two of us since my bf didn't really know what was good...me being a show off ordered for both of us since I always stick to two main items and refuse to ever try anything different. of course the complimentary bread and butter is a perfect starter..no need for appetizers for us....so back to what we ordered: 1. Chicken Madeira 2. Miso Salmon ""Oh Em Geee....now that's good food!  ""  is all my bf kept saying all night.     Indeed it was great. It's always great food because again, i refuse to try anything different.  maybe i will one day when i'm open to being disappointed..nah, i don't think i would but these two dishes are just too darn great. After, my bf's repetative ""damn, i'm full"", i of course have to have my cheesecake fix! yes, I'm a dessert person and my bf isn't so much. I believe in ordering our own separate desserts but he refuses to listen and would rather share. since he kept saying he was full, i figured he wouldn't eat too much dessert.  I ordered myself an oreo cheesecake a la MODE!  ..the waitress gave us two spoons with the dessert..uhhh..ahahahahah i'm totally kidding i don't mind sharing my dessert with my lovey...but i did notice that   he dug into the crusted part first and I eyed the way the devoured the piece..in slow motion...i then ate my portion with the ice cream and was in....Heaven.  He stopped eating after 4 bites so the rest was mine! YUMM... I was content.  overall, this cheesecake factory is really busy...u gotta figure they're doin something right if people are willing to wait 45mins to an hour for regular seating!"
Jessy Y.,"Campbell, United States",0,17,3,5.0,12/5/2010,"If you're familiar with Cheescake factory in general, the only problem with this factory is the parking. The restaurant is very large and one of the best cheesecake factory places i have been. Great place for date since you ca take a walk to Santana Row on the other side of the street. highly recommended."
Connie W.,"San Mateo, United States",120,246,34,3.0,5/9/2010,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years. I used to go all the time and loved it. After today, I'm not sure why I used to love this place. Either the quality has gone down or my standards for food has gone up (probably the latter...as I get older I care more about quality than quantity). I can't complain that the selection is weak - the menu is spiral bound for goodness sake. But then it makes me wonder how good the food is since there are a bajillion items on the menu. I rather have them specialize in a few things and make every dish a winner. Our meal was ok overall. Doubt I'd come back willingly in the future although their cheesecakes are pretty good. I wouldn't be opposed to picking up one for a party or something."
Ravi V.,"Santa Clara, United States",2,39,,4.0,17/2/2011,"We have been to a couple of locations (cheese cake factory) in bay area. The service is excellent, very courteous, polite, prompt. Would have given a five star except that one of the dishes (Jambalaya) was not up to the mark. The rest of the dishes  including appetizers were delicious. Yes, the wait time at this restaurant is high  but we took the pager and spent some time in the mall so it was really not a long wait for us."
Jona C.,"Oakland, United States",1,247,2,4.0,3/6/2010,"Sliders, grilled artichoke, beet salad, fried macaroni balls, happy hour, two rounds of drinks all at the bar and even a big white chick punching a little Asian gal in the face over a table in the bar area.  I need to play more hooky from work.  Unfortunately the Sharks were denied into the Stanley Cup final and the white chick got away."
Kristina A.,"San Francisco, United States",466,261,118,3.0,26/3/2007,"This is a pretty good Cheesecake Factory. The food is still overpriced, but they have a nicely varied drink menu and their cheesecake is absolutely delicious. The tiramisu cheesecake is far and away the best variety, but the others each have their own charm. The wait here doesn't seem to be as bad as other locations and the mall location makes for lots of parking."
Michael D.,"Sunnyvale, United States",115,92,15,2.0,26/10/2006,"Not quite sure why there is ALWAYS a hour or more wait for this place.  The wait to be seated is forever, the food is nothing special, the prices are ridiculous for the quality of food, and the food takes a while to get to you. If you really want to go here just get curbside pick up. Trust me."
