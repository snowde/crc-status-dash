Muriel I.,"Bronx, New York, United States",12,41,,1.0,2/2/2007,"The last time I ate here, I ordered the Portabello Mushroom Burger, which I enjoyed greatly until I pulled a long, dark hair out of it.  Yuck!  The server apologized, as did a manager, and my meal was replaced; unfortunately, by the time the new food got to me, everyone else at my table was finishing their food, and I wasn't even that hungry anymore.  Bummer. It seems as most of us are in agreement regarding The Cheesecake Factory's faults, so I won't get into that.  However, something that really surprised me was how long it took me to get a slice of cheesecake to-go.  I had a craving for some cheesecake and decided to stop by on my way home.  When I walked in, there were no less than 5 employees chillin behind the to-go counter, so I figured that I'd be in and out.  Wrong!  I waited 10 mins for one $7 slice of cheesecake.  They must honestly think very little of their customers if that's how they treat people.  While the cheesecake is good, I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."
Niki M.,"Orange County, United States",65,360,22,4.0,11/10/2006,"of the 1,094,537 things to choose from, my current favorite menu item is: SPICY AHI TUNA TEMPURA ROLLS: think spicy tuna roll, without the rice, but flash-fried tempura style, served with a tasty light dipping sauce.  the ginger they serve it with is fabulous! yes this place is madness most of the time, but the service is always great and just about everything on the menu rocks in one form or another, so do try. would i go again: i do, on the regular."
Andee A.,"Cupertino, United States",43,279,,2.0,18/1/2007,"Holy moly the wait for this place sucks ass.  Even the wait at the bar to get a drink sucks.  If it wasn't for the fact that I fancy their cheesecakes, this location, and possibly every location, would get ONE star.   This maybe lame to include, but I have the hardest time deciding on ANYTHING.  There are way too many menu choices here! and i'm not being sarcastic! I can never remember what I ordered the last time, and its so hard to narrow down the menu."
Salem T.,"Santa Clara, United States",43,143,3,3.0,23/8/2008,"I love this place, I just hate the wait. The food is pretty good and the service just depends who you get and their mood I guess because I have had both good and horrible service here. The prices arent too bad, but I think this place is to hyped up and people just come here because its ""the cheesecake factory"" and not so much for the food."
Ian C.,"San Jose, United States",69,100,1,3.0,21/9/2008,"Cheesecake Factories are all the same in my opinion.  You pay a pretty penny for upgraded chain restaurant food, fancy decor, and normally good service.  In my opinion, that is not necessarily a bad thing either. This location though takes a hit b/c the parking situation is not ideal.  You have tons of mall attendees to compete with and the $5 valet service they offer is ridiculous.  You can offer the service, but that doesn't make up for the stupidity of location. Next, our service at this location was pretty lackluster.  Besides being slow, the orders came out wrong.  That can happen anywhere, but normally the staff would react better.   If you do want a good piece of cheesecake then there is nowhere better to go.  3 out of 5, and hoping next time will offer a better experience."
jubi l.,"San Francisco, United States",106,296,284,5.0,5/12/2007,"Last night, my friend took me to cheesecake factory. Bar menu is the best (M-F 6-8 PM) Average price on the menu $2.95-$3.95 We ordered chopped salad (good portion), calamari, chicken potstickers and sliders (yummy). Our tab less than $20 PS: the faucet in the ladies room is a bit weird."
Crysta K.,"Las Vegas, United States",301,126,,5.0,18/7/2008,"5**stars** to the Chinese Chicken Salad and the Fried Macaroni balls. I could live off of those. Ok maybe not. But they are my favorites. Yes I'm one of the people who orders the same thing every time I go. And isn't that great that they sell their salad dressings individually? If you have to get food on the go, call your order in and pick it up. I've tried this a couple times at the Oakridge location and had success. Across the board I'm not impressed with the service. The service is mediocre and I don't feel like the staff truly give a d*amn about their clients, but the food is great so you can count me in on coming back again soon."
Tesla X.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,19,,4.0,14/4/2013,"Great service, good value.  Food is decent considering the wide range of options.  Try sitting at the bar if you do not want to wait for a table."
Matt T.,"Marina del Rey, United States",2,46,,4.0,28/11/2010,"I have been to MANY Cheesecake Factory's and this one is just as good as the rest. I have had a few bad experiences at Cheesecake Factory but many more great experiences. My wife and I love Cheesecake Factory, we probably eat there on average once every two weeks and sometimes once a week. I can not recommend Cheesecake Factory enough. Enjoy the great food. Try the Chicken Madeira it is the best thing on the menu! JMO"
Martha L.,"Clayton, United States",0,7,,5.0,28/5/2013,"AMAZING! Every time I come here I get excellent service! Of course the food is delicious as well. The Cheesecake Factory is definitely the place to be. Whether it's for a romantic date night, or you just want to indulge in the endless list of desserts (Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake is my fav)!"
Kim N.,"South Bay, United States",2945,9796,55587,3.0,2/1/2007,"There's only a handful of things that I stick to with C.F. since it's something I grew up with. Turkey Burger, Shrimp Scampi Pasta, Iced Tea and of course Cheesecake. I'm also used to the one's in LA where people watching seems to be much more fun. This however fills the niche when I'm feeling nostalgic."
Jenna J.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,,5.0,27/6/2013,"Delish!..Menu is huge, but everything tastes awesome....AND the Drinks..Uh huh!"
Jenny K.,"Los Angeles, United States",947,1248,244,4.0,26/5/2008,"i like how the wait is not very long.  it's also great that if you went on a busy night, you can just go shopping for a while in the mall. my favorite appetizer of all time (and of ANY RESTAURANT) has to be their avocado eggrolls.  these are the most heavenly appetizers that your tastebuds will savor.  warm avocados in a light crispy eggroll.  it comes with a sweet tangy sauce.  avocado lovers must have it!!  =) i have several avocado eggroll buddies.  =D  i am of avocado eggrolls and wake up drooling.  great thing about that is that in your dreams, what you eat is 0 calories.  LOL.. my favorite dish is their chicken madeira.  juicy chicken breast with madeira sauce topped with mushrooms and asparagus.  yummy mashed potatoes.  i usually eat half and take the other half home for lunch the following day.  ;) if you want a great salad, the thai noodle salad is great to share.  portions are big...so control yourself.   i never eat cheesecake at the cheesecake factory since i'm stuffed by the end of the meal.  but my favorites are the vanilla bean(had it when someone brought it for a party) and the pumpkin cheesecake(seasonal)."
Lea B.,"Livermore, United States",438,489,188,3.0,22/11/2006,"Last time I went here, they were having a problem with the pagers and I swear I saw several groups/couples who came in after us get seated first. After I asked about the wait, our pager was exchanged ... so it's possible we had to wait an extra 20 minutes because the system (or someone) messed up. Anyway, the food is still good though. My main complaint though is that they don't have hardly any vegetarian options! The menu is HUGE and there's probably three things at MOST (possibly less). I actually usally get the Thai Chicken Pasta, minus the chicken. And it's good, so not complaining. I just seem to always get that because my options are limited. They do have a decent number of veg. appetizers though, so thumbs up to that. I just still cannot get over how crowded these places get and how everyone puts up with it (myself included). But that's any C.F., not just this one. Anyway, recommended ... but make sure your pager's working!"
David T.,"Milpitas, United States",290,178,23,3.0,5/11/2010,I come here every now and then when there is nothing else to eat.  It's always busy and packed.  Parking is a pain in the butt.  The service is always good and the waiter/waitresses are polite.  The food is pretty expensive but their portions are decent.  all in all.  It's not worth the hype and the price.
Lily L.,"San Jose, United States",201,463,48,4.0,30/8/2006,"wow, I'm surprised at all the bad reviews.  Cheesecake factory has always been pretty good to me.  I've been stuck on the lettuce wraps and the chicken madeira.  The madeira has 2 chicken breast fillets piled on top of garlic mash, asparagus, and cheese. Its about $15 for it but definitely well worth it!  I always save the other half for lunch the next day because I just can't finish eating it.  I have yet to try the salads but everytime a waiter walks by with this big ol' plate of salad...i can't stop staring!  I think I will try it next time. Ok so i tried the salad the next time I went and it was TOO MUCH! The portion was enough to last me FOUR lunches!"
Sean H.,"San Jose, United States",529,25,,5.0,12/12/2008,"Probably my favorite restaurant due to its huge menu with a great variety of dishes.   The service is not always very fast paced but it definitely is always pretty amiable.  The problem with this place is that it gets pretty packed throughout the day.  3 in the afternoon is the best time to come if you don't want to worry about waiting for a table. Strawberry lemonade is awesome, they line the cup with sugar which gives it a great contrast to the tartness of the lemon.   Almost every time I go i try a new menu item and the only one I didn't like was the navajo fry bread chicken sandwich The chicken and dumplings is easily my favorite and impossible to finish, it isnt for the faint of heart so only order it if you are ready for the deliciously rich biscuits chicken and veggies covered with gravy. The asian crispy beef, philly cheesteak, jamaican shrimp, fish and chips, kobe burgers, lemon roasted chicken and appetizers are also amazing delicios"
NICOLE T.,"San Jose, United States",0,70,13,4.0,1/12/2009,"I enjoy coming to The Cheesecake Factory whenever I can. I don't care for their cheesecake (but I do like the kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake) as much as their food. I love their factory nachos with chicken, it's an appetizer but it's huge and can pass for an entree. I love their chicken medeira, i'd describe it as savory. I enjoy their grilled salmon also. I'm sure I'm not the only one, but i love love love their strawberry lemonade and how it comes with sugar around the rim of the glass. I have to be careful not to eat all of the bread when it comes out, it's warm and tasty.  I've ordered take-out here and it's always ready when I pick it up. I prefer to eat inside though. The service is fine, although it always seems busy. I have no complaints. The Cheesecake Factory has a large variety of options and if you pick the right thing I'm pretty sure you'll be pleased."
Max P.,"San Jose, United States",124,236,,3.0,3/7/2008,"Came out here with my 2 drinking buddies we had a great time Not much on the menu that appealed to me so i went for a burger and fries pretty big portions I guess that is cool for most people  but to me its just a waste of food the server was pretty cool  but she was a bit on the slow side, probably due to a shortage of staff Great place if you want to hang out and take you time Lots of eye candy for the single guys Its a little too corporate to be my kinda hangout but if my friends wanted to go here agian I wouldn't have any problems doing so"
Terry B.,"Sacramento, United States",67,135,6,3.0,12/9/2010,"Food is good, really good.. but parking is an absolute nightmare.. the wait times are usually unimaginably horrible.. the staff is alright, but they dont seem to genuinely care about anything or anyone.. the only positive thing about my experiances here after 3 visits was the food.. the food itself makes it worth returning.. make sure you do NOT go during peak hours or you will not be able to find a spot for a while - and if you do.. it will be a 5 minute walk away, then you have to wait an hour to get a table."
