Trudy H.,"South Florida metropolitan area, United States",96,221,,4.0,30/7/2010,"This was one of the best Cheesecake Factories I've visited. The service was great despite the 55-70 min wait. In their defense, it was a Friday night and 1/2 off cheesecake night. The food was wonderful and I had a great time with family and friends. Cheesecake usually doesn't disappoint me so nothing bad to say really. Also, the pomegranate adult beverage-perfect!"
eileen g.,"San Jose, United States",137,88,,2.0,25/11/2009,"I've repeatedly come back for their Tuna Tataki Salad, which is incredible..I've got a handful of my friends hooked on this salad...On my birthday, I ended up eating way too much sweets and junk food at work that I decided to cancel my birthday dinner w/ the bf and order something light...so my bf ordered two tataki salads to go and came home. Mind you, I've had this salad numerous times, but they barely gave me enough lettuce, skimped out on the dressing and worst of all, there was a crumpled piece of some sort of packaging sticker mixed in with my salad... so disgusting...it's like trash in my food... my bf called and complained and was able to get refunded for the salad..but really? has the quality and service really gotten that bad?"
Brenda H.,"Fremont, United States",45,543,13,3.0,23/7/2008,"I've always felt like Cheesecake Factory was okay.   There really isn't anything remotely healthy or good for you on their menu and the food is pretty basic.  The menu can be overwhelming, but if you slowly but surely become a regular - you probably have your basic 1, 2, or 3 items that you order.   The last time I came here, i had nachos.  BOO.  It was really greesy and the cheese was pretty firm (when cool).  But again, what should I expect for nachos.   The one and only thing I stand by at this restaurant is their Strawberry Shortcake.  It is Shortcake with fresh strawberries loaded with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  For an even tastier experience, make sure to request additional strawberry sauce and pour it over the amazing fluffy cloud of strawberry heaven."
Dave C.,"San Jose, United States",0,43,1,4.0,20/1/2008,"In part 2 of the search for ""a Great Burger and Fries,"" I elected to try this place at Valley Fair Mall. While I have dined here previously, it has been a long time since the last visit. Because, it is a very busy restaurant, it is advised to arrive early on any given day to avoid the crowds. I would have to say that this place will get high marks for both service and quality. Overall, the burgers are very good, not excellent, but still good with quality ingredients. The fries here are nearly excellent and perhap with another visit, they could be most excellent. The staff are friendly and helpful. The service is good and I was never rushed to finish. The atmosphere is pleasant and the decor is nice. They have an extensive menu with many options. So, if you are looking for a good burger at a reasonable price, this place may very well fit the bill. Oh yes, and as the name implies, if you have room for desert, their cheesecake desert options are superb!"
Jacki W.,"Napa, United States",8,36,,1.0,26/8/2008,"first off the wait at this place is aweful.  WE called ahead b/c we had a large party (having worked at restaurants I was trying to be nice and give them a heads up) but Diana at the host station was VERY RUDE and told me her scripted we don't take reservations scheel.  We enedd up waiting 45 min just to be called and wait another 10 while the two hosts they had seating people helped folks that were there before us.  Again, no help from Daina when we asked what the problem was. The food sucked, it came out cold and crusty from being unde rthe heat lamp, how they managed that one I will never know.  The prices are really unreasonable for the style of food they serve as well, you can eat A LOT BETTER and MUCH CHEAPER aomewhere else.  The saving grace was our waiter, he was very professional and cute.  Thanks Tim for saving our dining experience. I won't be going to the cheescake factory again."
RickyRicardo J.,"San Jose, United States",2,9,,1.0,11/4/2013,I love the Cheesecake Factory but last Thursday I had the worse experience. I called to place an order well I tried to place an order they took more than 10 minutes I had to walk in to place to place my order!! And when I arrived the server was just standing talking to the other server!!
Teno C.,"Fremont, United States",7,3,,4.0,9/11/2009,"F.E.A.S.T. Rating: 3.6 Cheesecake is one of my greatest weaknesses. I like plain cheesecake, cheesecake with toppings, even that cheesecake mix-in-a-box. Thus, I suppose it makes sense that I get around to reviewing Cheesecake Factory, a chain renown for their selections. This review, however, takes into account that they serve other things besides slice o' heaven. Financial (10%) - 4.0 Meal prices are reasonable, especially considering how big portions are. Few main dishes exceed $20, which is about right for a mid-level chain. A slice of cheesecake is pretty expensive (in the $6-8 range), but is big enough to share with a friend or two. Getting whole cheesecakes will give you a good wallet walloping (typically ~$26 for 7"" and ~$50 for 10""). Expression (15%) - 4.0 CF likes to showcase their cheesecakes; that is their strongest point. From the whole pies on display, to the decorative patterns found on individual slices, CF wins the most points for this category with their eponymous dessert. The main courses are cleanly presented, and heaping portions kinda has its own morbidly fun appeal. Speaking of which, they always seem to empty an industrial-sized can of whipped cream onto your slice of cheesecake! Ambiance (20%) - 3.5 Did I walk into a Las Vegas hotel? Familiar wall prints, classical columns...all that's missing is a Roman statue :) The waiting area, cheesecake counter, restrooms, and kitchen doors all share common space. I prescribe a little caution when wading through this overcrowded area. Expect to get to know your neighbors and their food when squeezing into the cramped seating, especially at tables adjacent to the bar where stools are placed almost haphazardly. Service (25%) - 3.5 As I previously mentioned, it's incredibly busy. And that's unfortunate because they don't take reservations. Instead, you're given an ETA and a buzzer device that notifies you when seating becomes available. Typical wait times on a crowded evening are about 45 min. Service can be somewhat uneven due to crowding and hectic pace (a true measure of service when you see how your server reacts in such a dynamic environment). And don't come to CF if your party exceeds 4. They will try to seat you, but expect to add another 30 minutes to that wait time. However, CF staff are genuinely friendly and accommodating. Taste (30%) - 3.5 The food is actually not bad considering the focus on dessert and diverse menu. The only problem I have is that CF tends to get the key flavors wrong (the syrupy sauces may be to blame). The Crispy Spicy Beef has so much potential, but is salty despite the sweet-spicy sauce. The Spicy Cashew Chicken is sweeter than it is spicy. On the other hand, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp struck almost all the right notes despite its funny name haha. The curry, peanuts, chiles, and coconut surprisingly don't overpower each other. I'm also a fan of their breads. What about cheesecakes that I already haven't mentioned? I brought a White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake to a picnic once and ppl refused to let it thaw. Gone in 60 seconds! I received accolades, but all I wanted was a slice :("
Michael C.,"San Jose, United States",11,189,,3.0,28/1/2007,"Great for people who can eat their entire meal because the portions are huge!!!  I've never had a good experience with the meat here, meaning it's never cooked to mine or my friends or family's liking. The wait is AWFUL though because they don't take reservations.  Be prepared for an hour wait.  The wait gets longer if your party is bigger too!   Caution: The floors are really slick for some reason there when just some grease hits the floor.  Marble???? Recommendations: Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Cheescake.(WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE and ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE. Sometimes they have some that aren't on the menu so be sure to ask!)"
Charissa P.,"San Jose, United States",127,220,46,4.0,16/2/2008,"My favorite food here is the Buffalo Wings but I get the strips.  Roadside Sliders, Avocado Eggrolls and Tex Mex Eggrolls are yummy. Chicken Pot Stickers are ok. I've had better pot stickers elsewhere. Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are good. I prefer these than the authentic kind. Fried Macaroni and Cheese is alright. You get tired of eating it by the second one. Thai Lettuce Wraps are better at Elephant Bar. Chicken Madeira and Hibachi Steak are really good, like drool worthy.  I can go on and on.... some things are delicious and some are okay. As for the cheesecake, so good. You should have a main one for your ""I-don't-feel-like-trying-anything-new"" days and the other days, you know switch it up. The wait sucks! I haven't been here in awhile and now that I'm writing a review for it... I'm getting hungry!"
ron v.,"San Jose, United States",0,18,,5.0,26/3/2011,Well I have a friend who always gets me a gift certificate here so I am a regular here. Wile shopping at the mall it's a great place to go actually a lot better than the so so fast food choices near by. Service has always been good and the food excellent. Oh when the wife shops and you sneak away it's a cool place to grab a beer...
Vivi T.,"San Jose, United States",37,36,31,3.0,6/8/2010,i dont really like the food here. every time i go and order food its always  either average or below average so when i come i only TRY to order cheesecake. I guess its because every time i look at the menu it just sounds good but when the food comes out its just ehhh... so i recommend cheesecake only!
Johnny J.,"San Jose, United States",144,304,1,4.0,18/4/2007,"Another guilty pleasure of mine. Now, If you have been here as many times as moi you should know not to come at dinner time thu-sat. Make it a late or early (5pm) dinner. The food at every CF I have ever been to from LA to San Jose to Miami (tonight) the food is consistently the same. Good too. Portions are huge so you don't need an appetizer unless that's all you are going to be eating. If you have room for dessert after a meal you are destined to be in the Nathan's Hot Dog eating contest. Favorites of mine are the spicy cashew chicken, and the burgers.  Or......... Go just for dessert and get extra whipped cream!!!"
redking g.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,2.0,13/8/2009,"This restaurant has seen a marked decline in service and food quality. My visit this week was the third time in the last 6 months that I was not happy and again the quality was not up to what I had come to expect. Not all table mates are getting the food at the same time; the gaps are noticeable and embarrassing. I asked for no salt on the fries that came with my dish. The dish came without the fries and I was told that the ""no salt"" fries were on their way. They had not come when I and the table were half done with their meals. In the end I had to ask for them. They came slightly worm, obviously waiting under the heat lamp all this time. This restaurant was excellent  at one time. The assigned waiter is cheerful and friendly but they rarely bring the food, this makes for a disconnect that is not helpful to the customer."
Anna S.,"La Mirada, United States",344,872,131,5.0,15/9/2007,"I don't care what everyone else says. I love this place.  HUGE PORTIONS, and wonderful desserts. I usually stick to their American type fair and avoid the Asian infused, or Cajun type flare. Love their chicken marsala, romano chicken, salmon rolls, avocado rolls, mango/luau salad, crispy chicken sandwiches, and their tomato white bean soup. (pause for breath) Oh, and I actually prefer their classic cheesecake with strawberries, creamy and less dense than the others. Their tiramisu is to die for... and for the ladies and (gentlemen) that like froofy drinks... Try the Peach bellini and the Georgia Peach drinks... You could polish those drinks off and not realize you had alcohol. Ahhh... so refreshing, I want one now...."
Elizabeth G.,"San Jose, United States",208,325,10,3.0,27/8/2007,"I love a good chain restaurant, and there's no chain like the cheesecake factory.  You know it's predictable and if you're in a town with nothing better, it's an option.  I heart cheesecake and they have about a million flavors.  My favorite is the dulce de leche. If you like big food, like obese people size portions, this is the place for you.  I like their salads, and the lunch portion could feed my whole family.  The appetizers are decent.  Try the fried mac n' cheese, or the crab wontons."
Lily T.,"San Jose, United States",2,20,,4.0,24/11/2010,"Red velvet cheesecake is the best, especially with milk (so good it can probably compete with oreos && milk). However, if you order your cheesecakes to-go (and not in individual slices), it can take a while for them to hand you your cheesecake. The wait is definitely worth it though. Prices are a bit on the high side, but that's what you get for eating delicious cheesecake. Foodwise, it's decent. I always get the penne with mushrooms in it (I can never remember dish name sorry) and it's pretty good/has a unique taste. The waiter I got last time could barely speak English though, but she was trying. Service was good, nice decor as well. Their dishes are def not as good as their cheesecakes, but I guess that's why they're called the cheesecake factory."
Lisa M.,"Phoenix, United States",155,27,16,1.0,6/6/2010,Food and service leave a lot to be desired. We waited over one hour for food to come and then one person in our party got sick from it.
Rachel R.,"Cool, United States",372,1059,12,4.0,22/1/2006,"This location often has a two hour wait for dinner.  They give you a pager that won't work in the mall, but we usually go walk around the mall anyway.  I often prefer CPK in the mall for faster food, or Maggiano's down Winchester if we're willing to wait.  The Cheesecake Factory offers a ridiculously huge menu that's fun for people who haven't eaten there before.  The dishes are also large, so sharing is great idea.  An appetiser can easily be your entire meal.  Vegan Report:  The Cheesecake Factory has surprisingly few options.  Besides the bruschetta, I love the Chinese Chicken Salad without the chicken (or for a more reasonably priced and sized salad, I get the Traditional Tossed Green Salad wtih the Chinese plum dressing and I ask them to add rice noodles).  They have several good pastas and the veggie burger without cheese is decent.  I also always ask about the soup of the day in the off chance it is vegan.  Note that their Asian Stir Fry isn't vegetarian, because it has fish sauce in it."
Joanne E.,"San Jose, United States",770,536,148,4.0,7/5/2006,"I've come here a few times for ""business"" cocktails and lunches.  Since opening day to present day, the food has been getting better.  They have been working their way up to the same quality that the Union Square one has always been.   The Melon Martini hmmm.......To BUZZ for....and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake....TO WORK OUT RIGHT AFTER FOR!!! and when I come here I ask myself...WTF is the menu like a book?! Do you need all those choices...and for those who have tried nearly half of the things on the menu, can you please message me so I can shake your hands for being that patient... AND P.S. WTF is up with the portions?!  Are we truly that FAT in america?!"
Heidi L.,"Milpitas, United States",192,220,43,3.0,3/4/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory!  But definitely for the cheesecake, not so much the food. My favorite has to be the vanilla bean, or banana cream.. As for the food, it has never made me wanna shoot somebody for an extra plate, except for this one dish.. All I remember is that it had shrimp and rice and some weird sauce in it. I know, not that much of a help, haha.. but it was good! And the appetizers are delish.. Yummy calamari! Just don't plan on coming to this location on a Friday or Saturday night. Hell, don't come after 6ish PERIOD. This place gets ridiculously packed, and you have to wait for what seems like years to get seated..  I mean, it's a great location, with great service.. but the fact that it's at such a busy mall like Valley Fair, says it all."
