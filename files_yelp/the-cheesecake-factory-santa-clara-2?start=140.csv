Kip B.,"Denver, NC",0,6,,1.0,10/13/2017,"Nightmare for parking. They have a sign for To-Go & valet parking but even if getting To Go, you have to pay to valet. Ridiculous. We self parked which is on the other side of the building and walked in.  My wife is on crutches and they wouldn't even let us park long enough to drop her off up front. We will NEVER eat here again.  We were picking up a cake for my mom in-law's bday. She's from Russia and loves one particular cake on the menu. If we had had the time we would've picked it up from any other location."
Aneera B.,"Oakland, CA",0,25,6,1.0,10/9/2017,I thought this Cheesecake Factory would be different not only was the customer service wack . My food was so cold . I finally came to conclusion that I will no longer be eating at Cheesecake Factory because of my horrible experience.
Lushi Z.,"San Jose, CA",70,169,72,2.0,2/16/2017,"The wait time on Valentines day was about an hour and 15 mins which wasn't too bad considering there were 40 parties ahead of mine. The annoying thing was that they didn't have enough buzzers so I would just have to stand around and constantly check in with the host.  My boyfriend and I were seated about 10 minutes before the party next to us. Our server came over shortly after and took the drink orders for both tables. She came back 5 minutes later with drinks for the other table and took their order. Another 10 minutes pass before she finally comes back with my glass of wine and take our order. (She didn't bring my bf's drink for another 10 minutes after mine but to be fair it was a cocktail). Annoying since we were seated first and my drink order was not even complicated. Not to mention she forgot our waters and I had to ask another server for it halfway through our meal.  We decided to order the nachos to share and it was huge! We barely made a dent in it! My bf had the steak dianne and I had the pasta da vincii. When my pasta arrived, the penne was so hard! I told the server and she said that their pasta is served al dente. I've dined at cheesecake factory before and other Italian restaurants and my order was not al dente, it was hard!. I decided to let it slide since the they were busy and she did offer to have the kitchen remake it. 15 minutes later, and I get my pasta back and it is the exact same texture. Not sure if she just gave me back the same plate but whatever I had two bites of it and decided to just take it to-go along with the nachos since I was practically full from eating off my bf's plate.   When I got home, I opened up the box of nachos and a cockroach crawls out! GROSS. It couldn't have gotten into the box while it was closed so it must have been when the server was boxing it up for us. I am so grossed out that I tossed my barely eaten pasta as well in fear of there being little critters in there. Such a waste of a meal. This is by far my worst experience yet at Cheesecake factory and I will not be returning.  1 star because they were busy so I understand for most of the mistakes  1 star because my bf actually enjoyed his meal and drinks"
Samantha H.,"Campbell, CA",23,197,42,1.0,1/31/2017,"Definitely done coming here.  The problems all stem from bad management. Saturday afternoon 6 adults and 1 toddler. Called to our table that isn't ready, told to wait in various places, awkward!  Ordered drinks and apps as soon as our waiter came, the first 3 apps we requested aren't available, we found ones that were. Drinks came, apps came and that was the last we saw of our waiter for an hour.  He reappeared with apologies and refilled drinks.  Then our food came which was just ok, 2 persons ordered pasta, no offer of grated parm, waiter gone again for a good 30 to 45 minutes, no checking to see if we needed anything.  He came back and 4 people ordered dessert, I got up and bused our table as there were dirty dishes everywhere and they didn't seem to be going anywhere. Dessert came along with the requested check, we were out of there. So poor  inattentive service, items not available, empty drinks for an hour, menu items not available.  The food was less than attractive or inviting but I want to keep this reasonable short. My guess is poor management 100%, not going back again."
Chul L.,"San Jose, CA",245,300,89,4.0,10/11/2016,I come here often with my family at least once a year. One thing I love about this restaurant is the consistency on flavor compared to the other cheesecake factories I have been to.  My favorite dishes are the jambalaya as well as their chicken Madeira and their Tex-Mex eggroll appetizer.  I prefer coming here on a weekday as it gets way too crowded and wait time is too long on the weekends.  You can never go wrong with a popular franchise restaurant such ass cheesecake factory.
Val S.,"San Jose, CA",28,14,16,2.0,2/20/2017,"Really disappointed by Cheesecake Factory last night. We did  the curbside order, first off took 3 tries to get an answer. No biggie, they're busy, I understand. I place my order and the rep says ok it'll be ready in 30-35mins park in the pick-up area. I wait get there by the 35 mins. Call, no answer. Call again and again, called 4 times. NOTHING. SO I get out go in tell them my name, I pay. The kid at the register says, ""so sorry gonna be another 15-20mins"" ummmm what?? Says they're slammed etc etc...  FINE wait my 20 mins.  Come back in. Is my order ready? No. He runs to the back says ""so sorry, they're finishing up your sweet potato fries, another 5-10 mins"" ARE YOU @)$&%# me?! So now it's been 30 mins longer than your person on the phone said and they can't even do fries quickly?! This is crazy.  FINALLY I get my order. All the does is keep saying sorry and doesn't offer a way to make it better.   1) never over promise and under deliver. That's just customer service 101. Be real with your time table. I would have been happier if you told me an hr wait from the get go 2)empower your staff to be able to make a situation better.  Offer free beverage, discount for next time, free piece of basic cheesecake. OR at the min teach them to bring a manager to apologize for the situation.  3)when you do finally give the food. AND it's 30mins late.  Maaaayyyyyybe make sure everything looks presentable (see pics). Who knows when/if we'll ever go back..."
Robert M.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/9/2017,"Cheesecake Factory offers a large selection, and I have good memories from years ago.  However, like others recently, I was disappointed after ordering through DoorDash.  I placed the order at 5:15, and delivery was quoted for 6:27 pm.  When that time passed, I sent a text to DoorDash to ask for status.  At 6:45, DoorDash called to say the restaurant was not accepting any more orders and my order was cancelled.  I'm not sure if there was a communication problem between the delivery service and the restaurant, but if the restaurant had received the order at the time of placement, and could not fulfill it, they should have advised much earlier.  Had to make other dinner plans."
Sam S.,"Campbell, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/11/2017,Received a cookie-cutter reply trying to push the blame onto DoorDash. What a despicable company.
Precious Ethel P.,"San Diego, CA",920,184,317,3.0,1/14/2016,"Most of the time, especially during the evening and the weekends, they are super busy and the wait is at least 30-45 minutes.  This is a huge restaurant but their food is pretty good and affordable so its understandable.  They also have great service, of all the many times I've eaten here, not once have I've experienced anything negative. I know a lot of people come here for their Cheesecakes, obviously, but I guess I'm not really a cheesecake person since I think that their cheesecake is just alright?  They have many different flavors that you can't really find anywhere else though so that's the plus and I guess that makes their cheesecake all that much better.   What I love about this location is that since there is such a long wait, they are connected to ValleyFair Mall, so, might as well shop while you wait?"
Silencia M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,18,5,5.0,2/7/2017,"We love the glamburgers here. My go to is the Mushroom Swiss, and my partner's is the Kobe. Never fails, it's always delicious! We usually do curbside, but this round we decided to dine in. Along with curbside, we've had some light service. But the staff is always polite. Our experience for dine in was really great. Miranda was our server. Couldn't ask for a better server. She was absolutely bubbly, and energetic. She made our dining very pleasant, and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you, Miranda! We are happy we came in!!"
Mohamed N.,"Santa Clara, CA",30,9,1,1.0,3/27/2017,"Ridiculous wait times. Service is very slow, we didn't get our main dishes after 90+ minutes wait. The place is understaffed. Update: just remembered, they didn't even serve the complimentary bread and butter."
Holly R.,"San Jose, CA",150,71,225,2.0,8/21/2016,"Horribly slow service and disgusting food compared to other cheesecake factory's. First time trying out Cheesecake Factory for brunch, I would not recommend it nor would I go back for that meal.  I'm not sure if it's because breakfast isn't their everyday but the service is so slow!! To top it off I order the eggs Benedict- eggs poached hard. After waiting for 40 minutes for my meal (the server made it a point to tell me the kitchen informed him it takes a lot longer to poach and egg hard) I was served eggs Benedict with one regular (runny) poached egg and the second egg was actually just  a fried runny egg!!! To say I was irritated would be an understatement.  I gave it a two star because our server seemed to genuinely care about the entire mess, even though it was not his fault."
Mary Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,19,28,1.0,1/28/2017,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Took my nieces and nephews there for early dinner. The parking lot was a mess and traffic was terrible. Got in by 5:10 PM. Waited 20 minutes to be seated. It was crowded but not too bad. Even the staff leading us to our seat said it's not as busy. We sat for a good 10 minutes and no one comes by. I remain patient then decided to ask for assistance. Someone finally brings water to us and apologized as they ran out of glass and he handed us to-go cups. Okay...understandable. We wait another 10mins and the kids get a bit antsy and hungry. I finally grabbed another waiter. Not happy at this point and asked if we could order as it's been well over 20 minutes. He apologized and investigated what happened. Of course it took another 5 mins and finally our waiter came around. Took our orders and said would bring bread. I asked for more water. Of course, 10 mins go by and no water. I grabbed another staff walking by and asked (still very politely) for more water. Anyways, you know how the story goes. Good came out late too. My nephews kid menu had fries with it but it never came out until my third request (literally). Of course our waiter had disappeared at this point and a manager came over to refill our waters. I immediately asked for our check. I was furious at this point and forgot about dessert until he asked. I ordered cheesecakes to go and we left.  We will never return to this place again!!"
Xuaner Z.,"Emeryville, CA",130,339,298,5.0,8/6/2016,Having lunch at Cheesecake factory is a good idea since there is usually no queue... And also a great choice after shipping at the mall. The skinny chicken pasta seems healthy and tastes pretty good. I also really like their complementary bread.
Quyen L.,"San Jose, CA",651,438,1647,2.0,12/13/2015,"Long waits, giant portions, ASTRONOMICAL CALORIE COUNT, not the best descriptions for any restaurant, but unfortunately those fit the bill when describing the Cheesecake Factory. Located next to Westfield Valley Fair on Steven's Creek Boulevard, there is no denying that this is a lucrative establishment. Even at 8:30 pm on a Sunday night, there was still a 15 minute wait to grab a table at a place that must have HUNDREDS of seats. My sister, her husband, and I were too lazy to go anywhere far from the mall and since it had been over a year since I ate at the Cheesecake Factory, we thought it would be a good idea for dinner. If only we knew better... Appearance wise, the decor is great. Low, mood lighting, beautiful artwork on the ceilings and walls, marbled floors and columns are just a few of the intricate designs you will find in the restaurant. It is certainly a good place to take a date or your friends and family for a classier dinner, if all you're looking for is ambiance.  Our waitress for the night was friendly enough, but she seemed incredibly scattered. My sister had ordered a glass of Moscato and she failed to bring her the beverage at least 15 minutes after she had ordered it. When we needed her help, she was nowhere to be found and we had to wait for a good ten minutes before she finally came back. She was clearly a nice person, but as a waitress, left more to be desired. For our entrees, my sister ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (extra spicy), my brother-in-law got the white chicken chili with white rice, and I chose the cajun jambalaya pasta.  When I read the description for my entree, I was super excited to dig into a dish that boasted spicy flavors, crunchy bell peppers, juicy chicken, and succulent shrimp on a bed of linguine pasta. What I got was a dish that lacked any sort of spice, aside from the aroma from the bell peppers, and linguine that was horribly bland. How can any entree called CAJUN JAMBALAYA be bland? Is that even possible? I couldn't believe how boring everything tasted!  My brother-in-law's dish looked like it was missing half of its portion, although if it was just going to be more of the hard, stale rice, I think he would say it wasn't much of a loss. My sister's pasta was definitely not spicy, let alone the extra spicy she had requested, and lacked a good amount of sauce as well.  Honestly, the only redeeming quality here was the house wheat bread, but even its warm, soft goodness couldn't save this train wreck of a meal. At the price we paid, we definitely felt like we were ripped off. It was obvious that the cooks didn't put much thought into their dishes tonight. Was it because it was so late on a Sunday evening? Perhaps, but regardless of the time, we were still paying customers who were looking to enjoy a pleasant dinner. It had been almost two years since the last time I've been back to the Cheesecake Factory. Clearly, I should have stayed away longer."
Vanessa T.,"Gilroy, CA",0,4,7,2.0,9/17/2017,"9/16 we experience bad service we waited 1 hr to get a table after we waited more than an hour to get our food , one of my friends got a simple sandwich me and my other got how stuff so they brought us our stuff quickly but a sandwich?? They lag then they said they put wrong bread if she still wanted it ? That was just rude they made us wait for nothing the server was ehh not too nicely , wont go to that place again ,"
Bn Ty N.,"Long Beach, CA",26,7,15,5.0,5/22/2017,I am super like the cheesecake here. The smoothies are also good. I will come back to check other cheese cake taste.
Victoria T.,"San Jose, CA",266,19,15,3.0,5/7/2017,"I'm deeply saddened by my recent experience at cheesecake factory since it has always been one of my go-to restaurants these past 5 years. I order the Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad and Chipotle Chicken Pasta everytime I come.  Chipotle Chicken Pasta 5/5 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad 5/5 Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip 4/5 Bread 5/5 Food overall is great! Service however was 2/5 for my most recent experience dining here. I ordered 2 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salads and was delivered two plates of Seared Ahi Tuna on rice. My family and I were extremely understanding of the miscommunication since there are a couple dishes that contain ""Ahi Tuna."" The manager apologized for the mix-up and took the appetizer off our bill. The Ahi salad and chipotle pasta again were amazing. However, our server not only blamed me for speaking too low while ordering but also quickly reduced her quality of service for the rest of the evening. I'm not too sure if I'll be back at this location. I appreciate the manager's accommodation but hope that this review helps improve Cheesecake Factory's customer service."
Julie B.,"San Jose, CA",58,3,,3.0,9/14/2017,Wait time is long.  They should take reservations.  And the construction going on don't help. Food was ok
Sammy C.,"San Jose, CA",243,423,752,5.0,12/4/2015,"When I visit Cheesecake Factory, I always and only sit at their bar; especially for this location, their bartenders are extremely friendly and nice. The ones I often speak to are Gilbert, Chris and Justin; their service is right at the level of high class saloon bartenders, very knowledgable and professional (trust me, I've been to many). I'm the kind of girl who's straight forward and cannot tolerate bullshit; when I casually ask for fine scotch, they know what I'm talking about (most bartenders from other chain restaurants often provide miss information). I find it very enjoyable to have a nice fine scotch and dinner here at the bar; If the bar takes a 45-min wait versus table, take the bar any day. Oh, and my favorite dishes are Miso Salmon and Grilled Artichoke; I'm not a cake person but my husband loves their Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.  Ps: Awesome job guys!!!"

When I read the description for my entree, I was super excited to dig into a dish that boasted spicy flavors, crunchy bell peppers, juicy chicken, and succulent shrimp on a bed of linguine pasta. What I got was a dish that lacked any sort of spice, aside from the aroma from the bell peppers, and linguine that was horribly bland. How can any entree called CAJUN JAMBALAYA be bland? Is that even possible? I couldn't believe how boring everything tasted!  My brother-in-law's dish looked like it was missing half of its portion, although if it was just going to be more of the hard, stale rice, I think he would say it wasn't much of a loss. My sister's pasta was definitely not spicy, let alone the extra spicy she had requested, and lacked a good amount of sauce as well.  Honestly, the only redeeming quality here was the house wheat bread, but even its warm, soft goodness couldn't save this train wreck of a meal. At the price we paid, we definitely felt like we were ripped off. It was obvious that the cooks didn't put much thought into their dishes tonight. Was it because it was so late on a Sunday evening? Perhaps, but regardless of the time, we were still paying customers who were looking to enjoy a pleasant dinner. It had been almost two years since the last time I've been back to the Cheesecake Factory. Clearly, I should have stayed away longer."

Victoria T.,"San Jose, United States",266,19,15,3.0,7/5/2017,"I'm deeply saddened by my recent experience at cheesecake factory since it has always been one of my go-to restaurants these past 5 years. I order the Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad and Chipotle Chicken Pasta everytime I come.  Chipotle Chicken Pasta 5/5 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad 5/5 Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip 4/5 Bread 5/5 Food overall is great! Service however was 2/5 for my most recent experience dining here. I ordered 2 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salads and was delivered two plates of Seared Ahi Tuna on rice. My family and I were extremely understanding of the miscommunication since there are a couple dishes that contain ""Ahi Tuna."" The manager apologized for the mix-up and took the appetizer off our bill. The Ahi salad and chipotle pasta again were amazing. However, our server not only blamed me for speaking too low while ordering but also quickly reduced her quality of service for the rest of the evening. I'm not too sure if I'll be back at this location. I appreciate the manager's accommodation but hope that this review helps improve Cheesecake Factory's customer service."

Sammy C.,"San Jose, United States",243,423,752,5.0,4/12/2015,"When I visit Cheesecake Factory, I always and only sit at their bar; especially for this location, their bartenders are extremely friendly and nice. The ones I often speak to are Gilbert, Chris and Justin; their service is right at the level of high class saloon bartenders, very knowledgable and professional (trust me, I've been to many). I'm the kind of girl who's straight forward and cannot tolerate bullshit; when I casually ask for fine scotch, they know what I'm talking about (most bartenders from other chain restaurants often provide miss information). I find it very enjoyable to have a nice fine scotch and dinner here at the bar; If the bar takes a 45-min wait versus table, take the bar any day. Oh, and my favorite dishes are Miso Salmon and Grilled Artichoke; I'm not a cake person but my husband loves their Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.  Ps: Awesome job guys!!!"
