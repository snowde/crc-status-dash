Joel A.,"San Francisco, United States",254,236,53,3.0,5/2/2007,"We came here for a birthday dinner on a Friday night.  [grimace...]  Yes, a crowded Friday night. We met up with my family at 7:30, but we were told by the host to come back at 7:45 to pick up a buzzer and wait another 20-40 minutes. They have a bar area, so we stood around and had drinks until we were buzzed. The bar is in the middle of the dining room, so be preapred for the stream of waiters trying to get by with food.  (BTW, The buzzer shakes uncontrollably until you return it, so for a cheap thrill, keep it in a pocket close to your body. After 40 minutes, you'll probably forget about it and be brought back to life by its electric jolt.) Despite our long long wait, I enjoyed dinner. For a chain restaurant, the flavors and general quality of food was better than I was expecting. We enjoyed the appetizer platter. The avacado rolls are yummy. The portions are really huge, so consider sharing an entree. It was my brother's birthday, so they sang to him and decorated his cheesecake plate with writing which was a nice (albeit cheesy) touch. I'm not sure I would come back if I had to wait that long again."
Kevin C.,"San Jose, United States",171,243,4,2.0,7/1/2008,I am doing this review for all Cheesecake factories... FYI - There is a reason why they call it the Cheesecake Factory.  If you order anything other than cheesecake...be prepared to take the punishment... The servings are huge and the quality is low...they don't take reservations and waits are too long... Only the appetizers are remotely enticing...the cocktails are good... Otherwise...two thumbs down!!!
ETHEL L.,"Campbell, United States",219,29,,4.0,28/9/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but only because of their Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I ALWAYS order that and their red velvet cheesecake. mmm [= There were a couple of times where they messed up on my order but it's cool. But anyway, I always ask for EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA Parmesan. I always feel bad but they say they don't mind muahah"
Linda P.,"Sunnyvale, United States",193,97,394,5.0,25/4/2008,"I favor Cheesecake Factory!  This is where I go when I feel like pigging out!  First off, lets talk about the wait here... The wait here is absolutely absurd! It can possibly take up to almost an hour if you come during dinner and they do not take reservations. However, when it comes to food, I can wait!!!  Ok, back to the FOOD (I'm already getting hungry talking about it). Here's my 5 favorite plates:  1. Miso Salmon  2. Jambalaya Pasta  3. Chicken Madeira  4. Crab Cake Sandwich  5. Steak Diane The portion they give here is a lot. You can definitely feed 2 for each order. I always take home my leftovers. And lastly, you cannot pass out on the Cheesecake. No matter how stuffed I am, I have to at least take a bite of the Strawberry Cheesecake with whipped cream and walnuts sprinkled on top. It's so mouthwatering.... YUMMMMY!!!"
Erin P.,"Fort Collins, United States",5,48,,3.0,4/6/2006,"The menu is so big, hard for people like me who can decide when there are only 2 options let alone 50!  =)  We sat at the bar b/c we were two tired shoppers desperate for some water and calories ASAP.  The bartenders were nice, attentive and boy were they ever busy making a million cute, fruity drinks!  I recommend the fried mac and cheese and the luau salad.  Both were tasty...and get the lunch portions, plenty big."
Guy F.,"Irvine, United States",46,53,,5.0,12/1/2007,"I am giving this place 5 stars not only because the food is good (duh), but because I DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT!!!! We got a table instantly! That shit has never happened at The Cheesecake Factory EVER! Doesn't matter what city I am, but this place's wait is ridiculous! Not this time....Now I know where to go if I ever want to eat here and not want to wait an hour!  Chicken Salad Sandwich was delish! The bread was decadent, and our appetizers of the mini hamburgers was mouth-watering! And let's not forget to talk about the bread they serve first! YUM!"
Anthony D.,"San Jose, United States",87,76,,3.0,8/3/2007,"I feel this type of restaurant gets a bad rep.  I've been to several locations (here, Palo Alto, San Francisco in Union Square), and this is among my favorites.  I went here on a Sunday afternoon at 1 PM and only had to wait for like 15 minutes - when you first walk in and there are 1500 people in the waiting area, you figure it's gotta be an hour.   The portions are enormous, and I've yet to see someone finish their entire meal AND a piece of cheesecake.  The menu is also massive, with all kinds of selections.  Admittedly I don't often stray from the Navajo sandwich, which is due in no small part to my unhealthy obsession with avocado."
Katie W.,"San Jose, United States",20,99,1,4.0,20/5/2008,"I've finally got my moneys worth! Its been about 3 years since I've ate here due to their many disappointing meals. I only came because my friend kicked off some GCs to me (she and her husband rather give away their GCs than eat there). I've tried a good variety before, but was never satisfied until... their HIBACHI STEAK. At medium-rear, this was the best piece of steak I've had in a long time. Its got an Asian twist to it, but doesn't lack that smokey taste. It was so good, I bought one to-go for my bf.  All their other dishes were average at most. Their iced-mango raspberry drink was pretty refreshing too. I would come back here, but only to order their HIBACHI STEAK (yes, that good). Thanks, Mrs. MY"
Sara B.,"Fremont, United States",44,19,,3.0,9/8/2010,"We went there on a pretty busy night, but only waitied about 20 minutes.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad and it was really good until I realized my salmon was still completely raw.  The salad dressing was really good too.  The manager came to the table and apologized,  took my order  back and cooked me another piece of salmon.  They still charged for it even though it was an inconviniece.  By the time I got my order again, everybody was done eating and I took it to go.  I tasted the chicken and artichoke soup, which was to die for and the warm crab dip. The dip was really good, but they didnt give enough bread for as much dip there was, and after a few bites it started to taste too much like mayonaise.  Overall the food was good, but I wish my fish was cooked all the way, and the service was great.  I would go there again."
Marevie T.,"San Jose, United States",1823,674,26,3.0,29/3/2008,"Food is awesome here! But here's why its missing two stars from me:  1) The wait is hella long for a table and for food  2) The waiters that I have gotten here are either really soft spoken, or tells me they are going to go on their lunch... ugh!!! TABOOO!!!"
Jonas M.,"San Jose, United States",429,124,58,3.0,19/3/2010,"The wheat bread is the best. I have way too much everytime I come here. When you ask for bread, you can ask for both white and wheat, 2 white, or 2 wheat, depending on your preference. The plates I must say are GINORMOUS, and I recommend sharing one. Given the portions, the prices are actually quite a steal, and the quality is better than most places with similar prices. So, why do you end up spending so much money here? -- the drinks and desserts, which are about $7-$10 a pop. So be careful! Of course, why go to this place without ordering a cheesecake, right? My personal recommendation is the tiramisu cheesecake."
Scott C.,"Gibson City, United States",3,41,8,4.0,18/2/2011,Jumbalaya pasta was really good. Mango key lime cheesecake isn't on the menu yet. It's delicious.
Hendrick L.,"Santa Clara, United States",28,226,3,3.0,14/3/2008,"I'm not sure what happened over the years, but Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite casual dining restaurants. Their menu is still impressively large and varied, but the quality isn't quite the same any more. The food portions are HUGE, and the bread is still quite delicious, but the overall taste is now more bland... and it seems a bit more oily too. Service is still good as well, so I can't complain about that. The wait here is ridiculously long. The quality of the the cheesecake is still pretty good from what I understand (I'm not a big dessert person), but the prices are pretty absurdly expensive. Unless you're in the mood for a particular type of fancy cheesecake, you're much better off going to a place like Trader Joe's or Costco - the value there is ridiculous, and the quality really good too. Is it worth the wait? I would say it's not, so if you're curious to try out the restaurant, go when it's not as busy. Avoid the weekend evenings, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Also, they give you pagers, but I have no idea why they only work around the restaurant. It pretty much defeats the purpose if you ask me. They should take your cell and give you a call so you can pass time walking around the mall. It'll help the economy with more shopping and reduce the perceived wait time."
Roen R.,"Hayward, United States",44,123,25,4.0,29/9/2010,"I like this restaurant better than the San Francisco one, and mainly because its way less crowded and I won't die if an earthquake happens. The food here is good, the overpriced cheesecake is great, and the servers are friendly too. I like the pricing also, they serve big portions for the right price, if you come during lunch time you can catch the special lunch portion which is cheaper and they still give you a lot. I love eating at these type of restaurants because it makes me feel...fancy. I mean, I am a 18 year old teenager, with a minimum wage job and eating at a place like this is, with the price this high is like rare to me. So when I feel like blowing off my paycheck, I would go here, and shop around the mall its connected too."
Mark W.,"Fremont, United States",2,62,1,5.0,11/3/2008,"I got lucky at this one, it was great. I've been to three other Cheesecake Factories and this one it the best I have tried. The service was GREAT - Five stars. The food was four stars. Very nice.  So, I guess I can't write them off after all. My last three experiences at the other ones were not impressive. I'm glad I gave them one more try.  maybe I'm weird, but nothing on the desert menu appealed to me. I was looking for something light and fresh after such a HUGE meal. Perhaps a freshly made orange sorbet. Or some sort of creative berry medley of some sort. Or some kind of yogurt parfait or something. Nothing like that. So I skipped desert. At the Cheesecake Factory. Yea. I'm weird."
Esther A.,"San Francisco, United States",645,1160,406,4.0,17/5/2006,"I used to love Cheesecake Factory ever since I first tried the Union Square location when it used to be the only one in the bay YEARS ago. So when they opened three other ones here in the bay (2 in SJ and 1 in PA) I was ecstatic b/c that means it relieves the wait at the SF one since I knew alot of these people who made their way out to the city to wait about 1.5 - 2 hours for a table were from ALL over the bay area. My sister thought I was crazy for waiting this long since she lived in so-cal at the time and they have several locations and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes, or so she claimed. I LOVE their avocado roll and their fried mac & cheese. Caloric, yes but very tasty.  I also love their selection of cheesecakes/desserts and their fruity tropical drinks.  I try to stay away from their bread that they serve b/c I need to save room for the huge portioned entrees.  Also, if you're going to order a salad, order the appetizer size b/c it is the size that you would assume you would get if you had ordered the entree size."
Lily M.,"Santa Clara, United States",481,764,25,3.0,5/9/2006,"I really hate rating mass chain restaurants..BUT I guess I can make an exception for CF. For a long time I only ordered the BBQ Burger because of how superb it was. I was hooked and it always came to me the same: perfectly cooked and huge! Now that I don't have the same metabolism, I ventured out and tried their salads and the Chicken Madiera. I'm pretty impressed...but really only look forward to the cheesecake if I go. The food is good for those times that you don't want to leave the mall but not eat in the food court."
Randy T.,"San Jose, United States",255,379,11,3.0,31/3/2007,"Well I'm sure everyone has been to a Cheesecake Factory at least once. This one at Valley Fair is pretty much the same as the others. Decent food. Huge portions. Adequate service. The only unique thing is the Arnold Palmer I request here. The iced tea they use is passionfruit flavored, which is quite flavorful and tasty. I often get 2-3 refills because it's so good. It's a nice family place and get-together spot for friends and co-workers."
Steave G.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,,5.0,29/12/2012,wOw... where do i even begin this review.. my favorite place in the world !! i go their at least once in a week. i'm addict to the avocado egroll !!!! everytime i go i pick something new from their amazing menu. i'm totally recomend on this place
Leo C.,"Union City, United States",81,202,15,3.0,21/6/2010,This place is not an awesome restaurant but it will do the job if you're starving because the portions are extremely generous. I enjoy the dessert here the most as well as the service. They have a huge selection of food so I'm sure anyone will find something they like here.
