Heidi L.,"San Jose, United States",56,50,13,1.0,9/9/2012,"It was a really hard time finding something gluten free to eat on the menu - it was  a lot of going back and forth with the kitchen - almost everything has gluten (even some items listed on the internet that stated it was GF was incorrect). Then when finally my food did arrive they served it with their tartar sauce, which has gluten!!! Luckily I had googled a lot of information and had known it contained gluten since the waiter did not. Long wait, one of the waiters had really bad breath, menu contains a bunch of adds, not gluten friendly there and the food was just OK. My family and I are not going back."
Karen R.,"Seattle, United States",65,219,114,3.0,25/10/2007,"This was the only place opened after 10pm when everyone on Santana Row went to sleep - on a weekday.  I wasn't thrilled by the idea of going to CF but I didn't have much choice as it was just across the street... all the other CF's I've seen have always been packed with people and the crowd often overflows onto the mall or wherever it's located.   I'm not a cheesecake fan (at all) but I must say, the two slices of cheesecakes that we brought back to the hotel... yummers!!  I know it's mass made and all but I really liked it! The food is kind of chili's-like but if you have a huge group and don't know how to please everyone, I say this is a good place to go.  Their menu is HUGE!  It takes a good portion of the meal time to read lol!   The buffalo blast (buffalo chicken in spring roll wrapper and deep fried) is good but don't expect to  be eating anything else after that.  it's super filling!  Too much for two people for sure. The Santa Fe salad should have been served in a fish tank!  It's mega huge!!  I ate and ate and ate and the pile of vegetables never subsided!  I couldn't see any chicken but every bloody mouthful I took, there was chicken.  Pretty insane!  Not a very impressive or colorful salad and sadly, Chilli's has a better salad... so don't bother...  Come hungry and leave space for desserts or be ready to bring some home."
Trish S.,"San Leandro, United States",383,139,26,4.0,13/3/2010,Cheesecake factory has a large variety of food and the service is always superb! This location is great since I love valleyfair and Santana row. The servers are more than polite and very easy to converse with. The only downside is the long wait and the food isn't the healthiest so of course you bring half the food home. I enjoy the factory burger and caramel chicken (special menu). The bread is delicious! I never have room to eat the cheesecake even if I tend to only eat 1/3 of the food..
Niket B.,"New York, United States",491,110,59,4.0,28/5/2010,"order: miso salmon, thai chicken pasta veg: tomato basil pasta (no chicken), brown bread i've been here 100 times. it's chainy. it's nice and classy. they serve you well (though they don't take reservations on the phone). they're open til 11. and they have delicious cheesecake (the original, strawberry, tiramisu and godiva are my favs). what more could you really want?"
Shiho F.,"Carmel by the Sea, United States",4971,2834,2440,3.0,14/11/2007,"We only made a quick lunch pit stop here since my Mom and I were craving a glass of red.  After she picked me up from OAK airport we made our usualy stop at what used to be called Valley Fair and took a stroll around Santa Row.   The St. Francis and Franciscan Cab were delightful even though the stemware they served it in was a bit dirty but we were that desperate to enjoy a glass so we sucked it up.   We also tried the Ahi Carpaccio which was served with Wasabi Pest, Creamy Avocado Dressing and a drizzzle of Togarashi Aioli.  Not bad."
Yvonne L.,"Campbell, United States",124,105,5,3.0,1/4/2007,"The entrees are OK, nothing to write home about.  The cheesecake selection is phenomenal -- hence the name. I just don't get the lines.  Why do so many people wait an hour for so-so food? Don't try to park in the garage on a weekend.  It's just crazy.  Take the valet parking."
Katie C.,"Los Angeles, United States",163,407,338,3.0,17/2/2010,"When you think of Cheesecake Factory, you think of the fancy place for overpriced American food. Don't get me wrong, their food is fantastic, but just expense and the portions are huge. In my opinion, I rather have a regular sized portion for a good price. Who needs more than they can eat anyway?  Lets start off with the environment. It's impossible to find parking especially on a Fri or Sat night. It's right across from Santana Row so people like to park in this area and just walk across to Santana Row after shopping or eating at Valley Fair. You can always Valet your car, but people in San Jose just don't do that... The restaurant is beautifully decorated and truly fancy. You can come here in a prom dress and you won't feel out of place. There is lots of seating, but this restaurant gets really busy, really fast. And they don't take reservations and that is horrible on their part. They refused to let me make a reservation before prom, I mean we aren't willing to wait 2-3 hours for a table for 11 when we have a prom to go to. You're losing out on a $200+ bill. Too bad for them right? Before I came here for my 15th birthday and I literally waited 2 hours for a table for my huge group. It was horrible. I vowed never to come back with a group bigger than 5 people.  The service is great. They are top notch for a chain restaurant, Usually you expect service like at Chili's or Applebees, but no. They are really fantastic. They help you order, answer any questions and are always attentive on refilling drinks. They also don't mind giving you more bread. And by the way, the bread here is FANTASTIC. So good. Comes out warm so the butter just melts on to the bread. Just don't get too carried away with eating bread, remember the food portions are HUGE. You'll be lucky just to finish half.  For appetizers, I have tried the sliders and the spinach and artichoke dip. Usually I just get full off the bread but sometimes I like to change things up. The sliders were just okay, I wouldn't order it again. The spinach artichoke dip isn't like the normals ones you get from CPK or Applebees. Here they use real spinach and you can tell. It's good, but I have to admit I like the frozen ""fake"" stuff better. I also tried the stuffed mushrooms which are not on the appetizer menu but instead on small plates and snack menu. They are really good. I recommend order from the ""snacks"" menu to compliment your bread while you wait for the main course.  The pasta menu, that is what I usually order. I tried most of their pasta and they are all very good. My favorite is the Louisiana chicken pasta. Spicy and yummy and PERFECTION. Its so good. MUST try. My second favorite is the Pasta Da Vinci which is full of mushrooms and I love MUSHROOMS. Avoid this pasta if you hate mushrooms. The sauce is different from a cream based or tomato based sauce. Always nice to change it up! The Alfredo here is just okay, I wouldn't order it just because I love CPK's better. I rather get the garlic noodles which is a bit healthier since it doesn't have a cream based sauce. REMEMBER the pasta portions are HUGE I recommend you share. Even if you come during lunch, the lunch sizes are huge too but the price is cut down.  Moving on the MEAT. I have tried some chicken dishes here and my favorite is the crispy chicken costoletta. You won't be disappointed. You get the fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes... So good. Usually I don't like lemon based sauces, but this was so delicious. Love it. The shepherd's pie is okay. Their burgers are MEH. Let's just say you don't come to cheesecake factory just to order a burger. Their fries are stringy too. I don't like that. I also tried their California Cheesesteak. It was really greasy and drenched in oil. It was dripping. Kinda made me sick to my stomach. Wouldn't try it again.  As for salads, I have only tried the Caesar and the Factory chopped salad under the appetizer salad menu. Because their salads are HUGE as well, it was smart to order from the appetizer salad menu. I really liked the chopped salad. Some people think that it looks like baby food cause it's all chopped up, but it was really good. I got everything into my mouth with just once scoop. It was delicious the vinagrette was savory and tasteful. I would go back and try their regular salads as well.   Moving on to desserts! Now you GOT to know that you're getting cheesecake when you're here. I mean there is NO point whatsoever to come to cheesecake factory and NOT get dessert. They will look at you like you're crazy... Okay, maybe not, but I would.. My all time favorite cheesecake is the White chocolate raspberry truffle. Its like heaven in your mouth. I LOVE it. So delicious and not too sweet. Best cheesecake EVER. My second favorite is the red velvet, then the 30th anniversary and lastly the brownie sundae. You won't be disappointed in whatever you choose GUARANTEED. If it wasn't for the wait, this place will get FOUR stars."
Josephine K.,"San Jose, United States",3,65,5,4.0,14/2/2008,"Regardless of how crowded it is and how long the wait, i still almost always have an enjoyable, delicious meal here. We love the lettuce wraps to start. Very yummy with 3 sauces. The chicken teriyaki is my daughter's favorite. The mashed potatoes are so lumpy and good! We've tried the burgers, the pastas, the fish.. everything is always delicious. The only time I was disappointed was once when my soup was served COLD, not kinda warm, COLD. They forgot to heat it, I guess.  Now about the cheesecake. At first, I refused to eat their cheesecake. They are NOT BAKED. They are refrigerator cheesecakes. I finally got off my high horse and tried them. I had to admit, they were good, even if they are not baked. Their chocolate cake and apple turnover was very good, too. Service is always friendly and prompt to make up for the long wait and no reservation policy.."
Laurin A.,"San Jose, United States",82,335,186,3.0,8/12/2006,"It surprises me that people will actually wait 1 hour or more just to eat the mediocre food from here.  Most likely, they're just putting their name on the ""list"" and going shopping a little more.    The only problem with that is, when I'm hungry, I'm hungry!!!  There are few places in this town that I will wait more than 20 minutes to eat at... and the Cheesecake Factory ain't one of them.  However, if it's late and you want some semi quality food at a decent price, this is a good place to come to. The lines will have died down and you'll have little to no wait.     Try to share your meal with someone if you can, as their portion sizes are so huge, it's embarrassing."
Jason F.,"Denver, United States",56,297,72,4.0,25/7/2007,"Ginormous portions of food!!! We have gone here for special occasions, birthdays, holidays, and just any other day of the week and its always good! The service is prompt and courteous even though the place is usually packed, and sometimes has a wait.The portion ordered for one person could easily be eaten by two or three people, its really that much food trust me! And if you eat too much you miss out on their extensive dessert menu, with endless choices of cheesecakes and many more yummy things to eat! I really like eating here on occasion, the ambiance and decor make this place a fun place to go out to! Not to mention their delish cheesecakes!"
Albert C.,"Campbell, United States",85,473,21,3.0,26/12/2007,"Pretty standard fare with a wide variety of lunch and dinner choices and really good dessert. Favorite entrees include the Chinese chicken salad, the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and Joe's special omelette. Most of their entrees are large enough to share (or for two meals), which appeals to my cash-strapped sensibilities. Among the cheesecakes, I like the fresh strawberry and the chocolate Oreo mudslide. The Valley Fair location almost always has long waits and parking really, really sucks. You've been warned."
chris c.,"San Jose, United States",70,241,19,3.0,18/3/2008,"I really like their food. I like the huge portions and cheesecake happens to be my favorite dessert. However, things I really hate are wait times. This place always makes me late for whatever I'm going to afterwards. I can eat an entire meal in like 20mins but I have to wait 1.5hrs to get it regardless of location.  Service is pretty good most of the time. I've had numerous apologies for the long wait times followed by fast service. Hopefully one of these days I can get a comp or something(wishfull thinking I know). So yeah, I like the food but damn its gotta be an event in itself just to eat here. Plan your schedule accordingly."
Laura G.,"Newark, United States",8,6,1,2.0,22/7/2008,"We received a gift card to this place a year and a half ago, but never went because the wait is always ridiculously long. However, my family and I went on Monday night around 5:15, and the wait was only five minutes. I guess that is the time to go if you don't want to wait.  At first glance, we were overwhelmed with the size of the menu. My thoughts are when the menu is too big, how can the food be specialized? Anyway, we ended up making our selections. My daughter's (ages 3 and 5) liked their cheese, avocado and bacon omelet (can't really mess that up), but thought the potatoes were too spicy because of the red pepper all over them. I thought my Chicken Avocado Sandwich was delicious and I was pleased with my meal. However, my husband did not feel the same. His Arnold Palmer had some black ""floaters"" in it that appeared to be rotten produce of some kind. Furthermore, it the middle of eating his Seared Tuna Salad, he discovered a long curly hair entangled in his lettuce. Yuck! The manager was nice and took it off of our bill.  We took home some cheesecake, since the mood had changed drastically since our arrival. I did not enjoy the Tres Leches Cheesecake. The wet cake on the bottom of cheesecake tasted too mushy for me. but the Tiramisu Cheesecake was delicious. Overall, I think the decor is light and cozy and our server, Stephanie, was super sweet. Unfortunately, I don't see us going there again unless it's to pick up some cheesecake to go! The menu wasn't that exciting and the wait is usually too long. It's a bit over-hyped!"
Karen S.,"Elk Grove, United States",0,219,49,5.0,4/6/2010,It's been awhile....SINCE I HAD SOME YUMMY TASTING PASTA!! I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya and man was it it flavorful and the pasta was soft and the way it should be!! It's a bummer they don't have Cheesecake Factory EVERYWHERE!! 5 stars!! Been a long freaking time since I had some good food!!!!
Marjie T.,"Burlingame, United States",120,488,122,4.0,2/7/2011,"great service...we initially went to get some eats at yard house late night, but they were unnecessarily busy, so we were more welcomed here. the bread is always good and the lettuce wraps are extremely plentiful for an appetizer. our server didn't make us feel rushed even though it was late. pretty good, overall."
Miguel R.,"San Jose, United States",9,58,2,4.0,31/5/2008,"This place is real nice. I usually order some kind of steak which is always delicious and the portions are HUGE. Kinda pricey but thats cool considering how much you get. Yes, the black bread is awesome. I wonder what kind it is. Service is ok, they're cool in the begining but its usually a hassle getting them to come around for my check. Do they still have the fried mac n cheese? 6000 calories but sooo good."
Gregory S.,"San Jose, United States",30,59,3,4.0,15/5/2008,"I would give these guys 5 stars but for the location.  The parking sucks! My Gawd, they have the best burgers I've had in years!  I can't say enough.  I guess Jimmy said it best:  ""A big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat."".  That's it.  The only thing missing is a big kosher pickle but I guess you could ask for one.  The cold draft beer is a given and they serve big ones too! Forget the cheese, mushrooms, bacon, sprouts, avocado and all the other yuppie junk people add to burgers to make them edible, these guys make burgers for burger lovers.  If you ask for it rare, it comes RARE!  They don't come out with some wussy liberal BS about ""We can't serve rare meat.  You're too stupid to know it may be bad for you"".  I can't tell you how many dumps I've walked out of where I heard that.   The only reason a restaurant would be wary of serving rare beef would be if the kitchen staff can't remember to wash their hands, their meat was not the best or their storage and/or cooking skills were suspect.  Hell, I eat ""Kitfo"" regularly; an Ethiopian dish that's basically raw beef in a butter sauce.  It's absolutely incredible! Chow down!"
Amy L.,"San Francisco, United States",135,651,469,4.0,14/3/2006,"Definitely one of the better Cheesecakes out there.  Easily accessible from the parking lot, prompt service, clean, and generally good food.  I have yet to have a nasty experience here.  Times visited: 10+"
Rosann Y.,"San Jose, United States",78,64,27,4.0,10/9/2006,"Wait time can be an issue, especially with parties larger than 5 people, after 7 PM. Recommendation: arrival before 7 PM, wander around inside the mall up to before 10 minutes before your buzzer is scheduled to go off. Service has been satisfactory for me throughout the dozen or so times I've been there. I recommend the Chicken Madeira, Pasta da Vinci, and Hibachi Steak, though we all know the real reason any woman comes here is for the dessert! I like the simple Strawberry Cheesecake, but sometimes I order a slice of Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Ripple (I'm partial to peanut butter)."
David L.,"Fremont, United States",24,368,24,3.0,15/10/2006,"It's a mystery to me why so many people are willing to wait an average of 30 - 45 minutes to eat here.  There is a wide variety of dishes to chooise from and they are generally pretty good.   I recommend the Pasta Da Vinci ($12.95).  Good portion size (but not huge).  Also, the restaurant is quite noisy and it becomes too dark when they dim the lights when the sun sets. Bottom line:  Service is spotty, come early (before 5 pm on a weekend) to avoid long waits."
