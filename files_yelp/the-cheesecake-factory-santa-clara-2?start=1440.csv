M L.,"San Carlos, United States",29,109,,4.0,17/1/2007,"Mileu: Chain restaurant, loud with nice dim lighting to wash the crowdedness of the area. Service: It depends.  If you get lucky, u'll get an awesome server.  They get busy, but they do always give me lots of bread.  So that is for sure the best. Food: AWESOME.  One of my favorite places to go b/c you can never go wrong with their food.  Its not the best crafted food, but hey what do u expect with chicken and biscuits?  Right?  They do have the best avocado egg rolls in the world.  I think a whole bunch of restaurants have copied them, but can not match theirs though.  They also have the best cheesecakes in most towns.  I have tried pretty much all of their cheesecakes and will go back for more.  If you can't decide on what to eat, I swear cheesecake factory will cater to your appetite."
Nate M.,"Brooklyn, United States",14,194,12,3.0,2/2/2007,"I was never a big fan of their food here. My family likes it a lot. But I could never find anything I really liked here. AND WHY ARE THE ADS IN MY MENU? Lame. But the cheesecake... oh, the cheesecake! My weakness in life is cheesecake, and this place is my kryptonite. SO GOOD!"
Linh N.,"San Jose, United States",50,57,,2.0,17/8/2007,"I hate the service at this cheesecake factory,....  and the food is just..... greasy.  I think the only thing I like here is their meatloaf, but its kinda zesty... and their menu is just all over the place.   Well, this is what happens when you eat at a mainstreamed manufacture restaurant.. what can you expect?  If the food aint great, at least make it up for the service... which unfortunately, I wasn't too happy about.    I don't think I will go back to this place to eat, unless I'm ordering to-go and the only thing I'll make an exception for is the cheesecake dessert menu.  Otherwise.... *ugh*."
JoAnne M.,"Anaheim Hills, United States",104,203,,4.0,19/11/2007,"we went here for my husbands birthday last nite.  There was 7 of us, but we were ot all there at the same time.  They seated us anyways. Our server GILBERT was excellent! 1. VERY accommodating! 2. all our orders were prompt, correct, and great 3. VERY friendly and made a point of asking my 3 yr old sons name and called him by name thru the meal when he served us for which I was very impressed I felt bad we were there for so long waiting for the rest of our party, but Gilbert was very cool about it.  When we go back we will definately ask to be seated with him the only problem was our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, and the portions are HUGE but so yummy. I definitely recommend anyone who is there during the holiday season trys the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, it is to die for!"
John R.,"Tracy, United States",9,54,,5.0,9/12/2007,"My ex-girlfriend introduced me to this wonderful place and each time we went it was awesome! The wait was long but a couple cigarettes in the parking lot easily passed the time along. The parking directly in front of the restaurant is SMALL but I have always been able to time my entrance to the restaurant where I come in the lot the same time someone is leaving.  YES! The portions are huge and the drinks are GREAT! The seating is also roomy, especially the booths. I love CF's menu and drink selection.  Good times here!"
Min L.,"San Francisco, United States",122,123,245,4.0,11/1/2008,"An hour wait on Friday night. Can you handle it. Otherwise, food is ginormous as expected, Luau salad is the best, service was great the night was I was there, dishes not overpriced, cheesecake is uber."
Jessica S.,"Thornton, United States",13,3,,4.0,4/10/2008,"My first time going to the Cheesecake Factory was pretty good. I was really intimidated by the menu, which was really a book. I didn't like that it was so small and there were three or four pages of entrees. I couldn't compare descriptions well, so I ended up just choosing something off the chicken page. The fact that there were ads in the menu was also pretty strange. Given the prices and the traffic there (there were at least 1015 occupied tables or so around 2.30pm-3pm while we were there), you would think Cheesecake Factory could afford to print their menus without having advertisers. I got the Orange Chicken, which was pretty good. It basically tasted like Chinese food that you could get anywhere, but was still good. It was a hefty portion, even ordered off the lunch menu. My boyfriend got a burger and he was raving over it the whole time. I wanted some dipping sauce for my fries (I got fries instead of white rice and veggies that were actually peas and carrots) and it took forever to flag down our server. She maybe refilled our drinks once. I'm not sure why she was so busy, as it appeared that she only had three occupied tables in her section. I had to get dessert because, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. I got Tirimisu Cheesecake which was amazing. It was too rich for me to eat all at once, so I got half boxed up and ate it later. Overall, it was pretty good. I'll be going back, though I'll make sure to go at lunchtime. I hope they change the menu to something less crazy but I'm not holding my breath."
Justine A.,"San Francisco, United States",60,71,7,3.0,19/3/2009,"Ate here the other night and had an ok experience. In essence, people eat at restaurants in order to: one, have good food, two, have good company and most importantly to enjoy the time/experience.  It was a Tuesday night and the Cheesecake Factory wasn't very busy. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our waitress took drink orders, brought bread out, and then took meal orders. After doing all that, she disappeared. We ran out of bread and water, thus, started looking for her to ""serve"" us. Since we couldn't find her, we asked a busboy to grab us some bread and another waiter was so kind to refill the water. Thanks! Our waitress comes back to take orders at the other tables, but doesn't bother to check on our table. Great! She now brings out some of the meals, however; she doesn't have mine. She doesn't say anything and just walks away. Common courtesy would have been to let me know that my food will be out shortly, but no.. she just left. Another waiter brought out my meal a few minutes later. She returned to take dessert orders and give the check, no thank you, no nothing. blah!  The meal was good. The cheesecake was good. The service needs to be better."
Roxana M.,"Mountain View, United States",3,25,,5.0,17/6/2010,"Yummy, ate lunch during the US Vs. England soccer game this past Saturday. BUSY, BUSY so we decided to sit at the bar, which was best and got to watch the game. Our server was on break and we were served pretty fast. When my server returned I had to return my shrimp dish since it was bland and flavorless. She helped pick out a new plate. Chose the chicken avocado sandwich, Yum Yum! The manager brought me my new dish and agreed with the shrimp not being a good choice. We had a great time and the food was delicious!! The QUESO does not disappoint."
J l.,"Saratoga, United States",0,96,,4.0,23/9/2012,"I love the sliders,pasta and yes red velet cheescake. i have had alot of cheesecake. it crowded but it worth it and if it really crowd go to the one on blossom hill"
Jackie D.,"San Jose, United States",600,386,31,2.0,28/11/2008,"blleeehh..... i wish there were better food choices. sure, there's tons of choices but the quantity of food surpasses the quality of food here. i normally get a salad or nachos or a quesadilla...something that isn't so nasty and grease ridden.  when people suggest eating here, i cringe. unless it's the only place we can think of, i'll go but if not, then i'd prefer to go somewhere less....chain restaurant-y. that's just how i roll. i think the cheesecakes are slightly too sweet for my tastes. i try to get something that isn't so chocolate-y since i don't like chocolate that much but everything just is waaaaaay too sugary. there is no winning here, huh? as a last resort, i will eat here."
Alexander D.,"Daly City, United States",213,39,4,3.0,9/3/2008,"I really didn't want to give this place over two stars. But it really wasn't as bad as I thought for a ""soulless chain- restaurant- I- don't- know- where- to- take- you- for- a- date- so- we'll- go- where- everyone- else- goes"" type of place. Went here with my lil sis and her boy last night. She knew the menu pretty well. I ordered the crispy spicy beef, but it turned out to be a white people's version of sweet and sour beef. Tasted good, though. Average. No real ambiance here. Too crowded. Floors sticky. Nice decor. Clean bathrooms. Not too much to say... Good pineapple mojito, though!"
Shawn ..,"San Jose, United States",1173,21,18,4.0,8/11/2008,I never go inside to eat here. I always do the curb side to go. The staff is always very friendly and attentive and on point. They have never missed an item and I do to go here at least once a week. Oh ya the white bread with butter yummy!
Mai H.,"San Jose, United States",41,130,21,4.0,13/4/2010,"Honestly, every single time I come here, I leave happy. The service is always outstanding at any time of the day that I go! I love the food here, and the portions are RIDICULOUS! They are HUGE! I love that during lunch, they have the smaller portion, which is what you would get at a normal restaurant for double the price. Cheesecake Factory never fails me! I love it here, and I will continue to go until I am tired of it. Usually I get the cajun jambalaya pasta, cashew chicken, cashew salad, bang bang chicken and shrimp, and or orange chicken. Today, i changed it up and got the Louisiana pasta! OMG! I LOVED IT, it was FANTASTIC!!!! Mmm yummy! This dish will be added to my all time favorite list above!  I love you, cheesecake factory!"
Harry S.,"San Jose, United States",2,2,,4.0,10/7/2010,"I frequent this restaurant. I like the the staff and the food. There are some things that I've noticed that bother me. The parking right in front of the store should be for guests not employees. I actually had an employee cut in front of me while I was waiting for someone to back out of their parking. When I complained to the employee he laughed shrugged his shoulder's and entered the restaurant through the main entrance. This is my second point , why is managment allowing staff members to enter through the front door. Isnt there an employee entrance? You see kitchen staff with soiled uniforms sauntering in like nobody's business. You see them leave through the front entrance headed to their parked cars that they probably took from a guest. This is bad business and I'd I like to think managment is not aware."
Rose S.,"Mountain View, United States",27,46,9,4.0,5/11/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory is perfect for a date, special occasion or family gathering. The menu is very extensive. I personally enjoy the Spicy Cashew Chicken(tastes great if you don't mind a spicy kick), Orange Chicken(the chicken is very tender, while the outer crust has a perfect crisp), Herb Crusted Salmon(the salmon has always been fresh and the Hollandaise sauce is wonderful!) and the Big Five Pizza.  They have excellent Mojitos, very refreshing and minty! I'm always sure to order their Tropical Iced Tea, a very unique taste!  As for cheesecake, I like their banana cream and pumpkin(when it's fresh).  The only downside to dining here is the wait, especially during peak hours. You can't make reservations"
Missy-Fishy X.,"Fremont, United States",6,52,,3.0,2/2/2007,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is.  Yes, it's a soulless chain restaurant.  Yes, it is loud.  And yes, it can be crowded.  However, their cheesecake is great.   They have a huge menu that has dishes ranging from the awesome (Lousiana Chicken Pasta, I'm talking about you.) to the mediocre (pitiful sandwich calling yourself a Cuban, you know I'm talking about you.  I don't care that the waitress said she liked you.  She lied.) All in all this place gets 3 stars because there is something on the menu for everyone, you know beforehand what you are going to get, and if you know what to order you can get a great meal and a yummy slice of cheesecake for dessert."
David C.,"Santa Clara, United States",25,140,128,2.0,6/1/2008,"HAIR ALERT! There was a hair in my girlfriend's pasta today!  I understand it happens... and the manager came by and was very nice about it and apologized, so the purpose of this post is to make people aware of what they are eating when dining there.  It makes it worst due to the low lighting in the restaurant, which makes it hard to see what you eating."
Bubba G.,"Union City, United States",22,220,32,3.0,17/2/2008,"I am not on a special diet this month.  So I allowed myself to go to the colossus caloric intake Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered the Renee's Special.  It consists of a salad, half of a sandwich and a bowl of soup all for less than $10.   You would think that this might be somewhat healty because you're getting a salad and soup.  The sandwich choices were the chicken salad or the turkey.  I opted for the chicken salad.  The half of a sandwich probably has the same amount of calories as a whole pizza at Round Table.  The bread is dipped in melted butter and toasted on the grill.  The chef must think that the bread is really dry after the toasting, so he puts on a generous amount of mayo on each slice.  Then the chicken salad with mayo is added into the mix.  What do you get?  A thick crunchy sandwich with a gooey mayonaisse laden inside.  It must be close to 1500 calories.  And I haven't even touched the salad or the soup. Portions are generous, the atmosphere is trendy, and the prices are, well, pricey.  I would still come here in the future, but it would have to be on a calorie deficit day."
Alie C.,"Santa Clara, United States",576,683,14,3.0,6/2/2009,My friend and I ate here today for lunch. It took 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and the waiter got my drink order wrong so we were turned off right from the start. Its always big portions and decent food so besides the service being pretty bad today it was worth it for the food.
