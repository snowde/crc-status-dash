Elaine H.,"San Francisco, United States",241,979,112,4.0,12/4/2009,"This location looks much nicer than the one over here in San Francisco. The entrance looks much more grand and spacious. The food is about the same, just alright. I had the Jamaican black bean shrimp, and although the flavors were bold, the shrimps were overcooked. I was surprised when my friend's flat iron steak came out to be very yummy and cooked perfectly. When I said medium, it came out medium. It was thicker than what I expected too! Decided to try the keylime cheesecake today and I wasn't impressed. It was way too soft, as if it was left in room temperature for a while. However, I did like our server (she had short hair and her name began with a J) and the hostesses. Overall a decent experience."
Karen L.,"Houston, United States",11,16,,2.0,27/4/2012,Had a horrible time finding parking and then decided to pay for valet parking. I ordered a turkey burger on wheat bread. It was absolutely horrible. The meat only spread across 50% of the bread with a huge slice of tomato.  It looked like a 5 year old put it together. They need new cooks. I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge which is great. I was so disappointed in my meal and how ghetto the woman who calls your name when your table is ready.  Use the disks like Oakridge uses. Totally disappointed in this location which is suppose to get higher class people because of Santana Row. We went here because it was close to work. Not a again.
Michael S.,"Fremont, United States",0,3,,1.0,29/7/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory has to be the worst place i hav ever eaten. the food was horrendous, the service was weak and the lighting was to dim for my mother to read her menu. Some perticular foods that i hate are, all the burgers for being bland/tasteless, the club sandwich because the bacon tasted like plastic and the turkey was limited to a low amount, and the crispy fried cheese for being the nastiest tasting cheese ever. The only bright side to this place is the cheesecake, which i actually enjoyed.(I had the Red Velvet Cake)"
Giovanna M.,"San Jose, United States",106,38,3,5.0,15/1/2007,"A great place to get  variety of foods from different cultures. You can sit at the bar or in a booth. Though this is a busy place, it has  a great atmosphere. My last visit there we had a wonderful waitress who was always there when we needed something.She gave us the rundown on her favorites, and the specials I went with her favorite on the drink. Remember to plan your day accordingly you may need to wait 15 to 25minutes depending on the time of day and type of day you go. (holiday) enjoy"
h s.,"Morgan Hill, United States",38,55,59,4.0,22/6/2007,"MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT!!!! MENU: i love their salmon firecracker rolls and avocado rolls as the appetizers. For their entrees, my favorites are chicken marsala, pasta da vinci, chicken and shrimp bang bang, miso salmon, wataki seared tuna salad, thai chicken pasta or shrimp scampi. SO DELICIOUS!! although i have to say their portions are HUGE!!! so i normally go in during lunch for smaller portions and lower price. their drinks are even huge!!! i can't really say anything about their desserts because i never have room for any.  PRICE: it's what you get for the price that you pay.  SERVICE: it always depends. i've been to cheesecake factory many times and the one in oakridge and valleyfair, the servers are very friendly and nice. But the one in sf, they're too snobby and they're always rushing us out!! i hate that!!  FUTURE VISITS: YES! YES! YES!!!!"
Wendy C.,"San Jose, United States",3,29,4,4.0,13/8/2007,"This is one of our fave restaurants because it's close to our house, kid-friendly and part of Valley Fair! It gets packed at all times so we always get there right when it opens.  With a 3 year old, dinners are hard so we stick to brunch/lunch. We've been here a lot and have never had bad service (knock on wood).  The staff is really friendly.  We love the food and yes, the portions are huge!  Never quite have room for cheesecake... My husband's fave dishes are:  Thai chicken pasta, Calif. Cheesesteak (Philly cheesesteak minus onions) and my fave, the chicken madiera. The decor is really pretty, too."
Kimberly L.,"San Jose, United States",88,315,345,4.0,29/11/2007,"This place is GREAT if you don't mind waiting. I love the variety of food they offer. My favorites are: Appetizers: - SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS  - SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES - FACTORY APPETIZER FAVORITES  Entrees: - CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA (love the sauce) - FETTUCINI WITH CHICKEN AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES (one of the tastier ones I have had) - THAI CHICKEN PASTA  (love the peanut sauce) Cheesecakes: (Their cheesecakes are to die for!) - WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE - WHITE CHOCOLATE with carmel (it's not the one on the menu, but a new one that has not been listed yet) I love going here when I want variety and large portions. Their food is always good. I even love the fresh bread they bring out. I always seem to have a good experience when I go there. Just hate the wait. The good thing is, if the wait is too long, I can always go to the one at Oakridge. So one star off for the always super long wait, but I think it is getting a little better. Also, it never hurts to be located at a mall since it does give me something to do while I wait.  The cheesecakes are to die for."
Chang Z.,"Mountain View, United States",24,21,2,1.0,3/12/2007,"I did not know this is a ""Status Only"" or ""Dress Very Expensive"" type of restaurant!!! If they would just post the sign in front door, I would saved some trouble of entering. The service is sooo bad, that I think I was back in the time of segregation era. At the end when I was trying to pay my bill with a credit card, the waiter asked me, ""Should we keep the change?!!!"" Yes, I am a Chinese, and all Chinese pay everything with cash!!!  The only thing good over there is the food, but...   Too bad that I couldn't give negative rating..."
Judith J.,"Silicon Valley, United States",12,67,,2.0,19/2/2010,"CF is definitely NOT the place to come if you are in a hurry. The servers are supposed to do the waiting -- not the customers! Our group had to WAIT for a table, WAIT while they cleaned it, WAIT for our food, WAIT for our checks, then WAIT more while mistakes on the checks were fixed. Menu was very large, but not very interesting. Portions were huge, but so were the prices. No one in our party was thrilled with their food. The restrooms were not well-supplied or clean and were not the right capacity for such a huge restaurant."
Danny P.,"San Jose, United States",304,109,18,2.0,12/5/2009,"the two stars represent the TWO bad experiences that i've had here. once was with a friend, the careless waiter got our order all mixed up and NOTHING was what we wanted.. my vegetarian friend ordered a dish without meat and what do ya know? her meal comes out with FULL BLAST chicken in it.. geez. it wasn't a tough order to remember, was it? i ordered my burger well-done, and what do ya know? RED MEAT heaven~ aiyah.. i was pissed. i had to pick around my burger to look for the cooked areas. at the end, it looked like raw ground beef. how ironic!! the second waitress noticed that we weren't happy and notified the manager, because he came over and made one of the meals free. he then probably FORCED the original waiter over to apologize because he came over with his careless attitude and quickly said sorry and scurried away. the second time, i was with my family, trying to have a NICE mother's day dinner. the waitress lacked personality and happyness. she was probably tired, but sorry! it's your job, missy, i'm sure you need the tips. suck it up and do your job. she wasn't really great, i had to request for bread twice and she didn't look too happy when taking our otders. it kinda killed my family's mood. thanks a lot!"
Kevin C.,"San Jose, United States",98,264,114,2.0,18/8/2008,"the wait:  absolutely horrible, 1 star the service:  slow and forgetful, 2 stars the food (quality):  average, 3 stars the food (quantity):  very good to great, 4 stars the prices:  match the portions, 2 stars The wait is painfully, mercilessly, notoriously long.  We knew this in advance, but foreknowledge doesn't make the wait any shorter.  Our group of eight was waiting from 6:30 to 7:15 on a MONDAY.  Imagine the wait on a weekend.  (And lest you think it's just because we had a big group... small parties had comparably long waits.) Here's something that puzzled me: parties were given pagers while they waited to be seated... but a CF employee was still walking around calling some parties by name.  That seemed amateurish (matching the service to follow). After a long wait in the increasingly crowded (but aptly named) waiting area, our pager buzzed and we reported to the front desk.  And waited some more.  Eventually a sweaty but friendly welcomer in a black polo showed us to a booth in the back.  (Guy could have used an undershirt.)  Only five place settings were on the table, but more were brought after we asked. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly, but service was really slow for the most part.  It was a long wait for beverages and bread, and an even longer wait for the beverage order to be corrected.  Consider that we had already been waiting nearly an hour at this point.  The bread refill took just as long; the place must be really understaffed or something.  Every aspect of service was slow, except the speed-talking of the waitress.  (She was like the Micro Machines guy.) The food quality was average, probably on par with Chili's and the like, but the portions were generous to say the least.  My friend and I shared a BBQ bacon double cheeseburger ($11) and a ""tons of fun"" double cheeseburger ($11).  Impressively large, served with a large side of crisp fries.  Not great, but at least there was a lot.  One friend's chicken was on the dry side, and another's pasta was undercooked (firmer than al dente). It's easy to be floored by the size of the dishes, but the prices are high to match.  $10 for the cheapest cheeseburger, it had better be either great (no) or big (yes).  Huge salads, but they're something like $14.  $20 for the popular miso salmon or steak Diane. As expected, the waitress offered dessert (twice actually), but because of the gargantuan entrees, that was expectedly out of the question. Service was decidedly below average, but groups of seven of more pay a compulsory 18% gratuity.  Meh.  I get that it's a regular policy, but it seems like it gives the waitstaff license to be lousy. What's the deal with the lights getting progressively dimmer?  It went from bright to dark around 7:15, and dark to darker around 8.  I guess it would create a more romantic evening atmosphere, except that guest parties are seated incredibly close to one another.  All-up-ons close.  This is no gentlemen's club; I don't need strange people on my lap. As we left around 8:45, the place was still packed, with people waiting to be seated.  (No, we didn't eat incredibly slowly... the slothlike service was to blame.)  I don't really get why this place is so popular.  The cheesecake, sure... but it's like 6 bucks, 800 calories, and 50 grams of fat per slice.  My wallet and arteries clench just typing that.  Just get a much cheaper (but equally unhealthy) CF frozen cheesecake at Costco... something like $20 instead of $50."
Linh N.,"Milpitas, United States",186,253,166,5.0,16/8/2009,Always serving customers with superior customer service.  I never have to ask twice for anything. My order is always done right. The food is decent. The desserts are yummy.
Jennifer H.,"San Jose, United States",38,246,,4.0,26/10/2011,"the rating is between 3-4, the service was ok, a little slow. i got the ice green tea with mint (not bad) for close to zero calorie, ahi tuna tataki salad (delicious and light). i also got to try my colleague's spicy crispy beef with rice, a little too salty for me. we ordered potstickers and calamari to share... the fried calamari appetizer was okay only. the potstickers were not bad, tasted quite chinese and delicious actually..finished off with key lime cello cake, pretty good and not too sweet. overall, the food experience was good, but pbb will not go back since i was not particularly impressed by anything (service or food)...."
Johnson H.,"San Francisco, United States",384,399,150,4.0,10/1/2010,"The service great - they came every so often to clear the plates, refill the bread basket and drinks. We waited only a few minutes to be seated. The kids loved it. We left stuffed to the brink and then workout the food by walking around the mall.  I think this Cheesecake Factory is less crowded than the one in SF.."
Chelsea L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",163,39,7,2.0,2/1/2009,"The only memorable thing about this place is the annoyingly large portions. The food isn't even good enough to eat the left-overs, and it's way over priced. One time the waiter even forgot to bring all of our food. I've been there a few times and every time get something different, and I have never been impressed. The food isn't good, the portions are WAY to big, and it costs too much. I've had better food at Jack in the Box, sadly. If you are thinking of going there to see what all the ""fuss"" is about, don't. Save your money and go somewhere else."
Haily W.,"Beaverton, United States",79,308,45,3.0,18/7/2009,"I don't really get the hype. The food is just mediocre. We only came cause the boyfriends dad had given him a gift card. I've only had one dish here I REALLY liked (the chicken jambalaya). I was stupid today and should've ordered that again, but I wanted something different. Chicken BBQ pizza = not good, Sliders = ok but too much pepper and fries = Mickey D's. Service was fine but we sat waiting for our check forever! He must of thought we were still eating cause we had 2/3 of our food left. We took it to go and then tossed it."
Beatrice C.,"Fremont, United States",0,5,,5.0,19/6/2008,"This is the only place I walk out with a doggie bag.  The portions are enormous.  For all you big eaters out there this place is for you.  The Buffalo Chicken Sandwhich is to die for!  The staff there once you get past the annoying host/hostess are really great.     I have only had 1 bad experience and that was on mother's day, where they had mixed up my order and the manager fixed up me and my friend with free cheesecake!  They really go out of their way once you sit down, to having an enjoyable meal. This is what keeps me coming back, no matter how long the wait is."
Tiffany P.,"San Mateo, United States",7,67,1,5.0,14/12/2009,"I love love loooooooooove cheesecake factory.  The drinks are awesome - I love the caribbean cooler or the pineapple mojito.  The food is great - at this cheesecake factory I have always had a great food experience.  I recommend the fried zucchini.  Best Ive had in a long time.  Also the BLT salad is a full meal.  Its on the appetizer menu, but its soooooo good.  The bacon ranch dressing is to die for.  They sell some dressing by the cheesecake counter, and unfortunately we didnt find this one.  Ive tried a lot of the dishes, and almost all of them have been great.  Im not a fan of their burrito or anything really mexican food inspired...not good.  But there pastas, sandwiches, salads, steaks and chicken dishes are amazing.  Love the flavors!"
Andrew S.,"Saint Johns, United States",3,31,,4.0,4/11/2011,"Service here counts as much as the food.  I have always received good service followed by good food.  I wish I could say excellent, but the food still tastes mass produced.  The salads are huge, fresh, and cold.  However, I have had to send one back that was served on a warmed plate.  Now I remember to include that in my order: ""No warmed plates please.""  The salmon tastes fine, but their red meat beats it hands down, especially the skirt steak. The vats of water/and or lemonade they serve  will last a very long time.  I like the service, but it always seems like the waiter lasts about halfway through the meal and then hands it off to the next one.  That only seems to happen at The Cheesecake Factory.  Parking is a pain, especially on the weekends.  Avoid the area during holiday shopping.  If you come in and the wait for a table is long, I suggest grabbing an open stool at or around the bar where there is no wait.  A good sign is that I am usually too full for dessert."
stephen n.,"San Jose, United States",9,57,,5.0,7/5/2010,I've been here once and i loved the food! Everything including the service was great! i ordered the chicken stir fry rice or something close to that; can't remember the exact name. Next time i come here i should give the cheesecake a try!
