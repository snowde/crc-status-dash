Hannah L.,"San Jose, United States",127,531,237,4.0,26/6/2009,"The farfalle bow pasta is my favorite dish here. I like the cheesecake here, since that's what it's best known for. The vanilla bean cheesecake is superb or the original cheesecake with strawberry topping. Yummy. Gets busy on special occasions and weekends. I hate the fact that they only take reservations for a party of 6 or more, which is pretty bull."
Judy T.,"Fremont, United States",6,55,3,3.0,14/10/2006,"This place is TOO busy!  I know the food is pretty good and the portions are good-sized (not as much as a few years ago though), but I wouldn't wait more than 45 minutes to eat here.  We came here about 5:30-6pm on a Sat night and still had to wait about 30 minutes. Luckily, our party had studied the menu while waiting so we ordered as soon as we sat down and a waiter came by.  The service is a bit slow (the wait people are constantly rushing around), but our food came out pretty quickly.  I really enjoyed my Louisana Chicken Pasta.  The slice of Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake was delicious, as expected.  Their cheesecake is really good, if a bit pricey.  $6.50-7.50 for a regular slice."
Chanel V.,"Fremont, United States",2,16,,3.0,20/5/2007,"The food was pretty good I got the filet mignon, the only thing is the amount of food was just sooooo HUGE. But I guess for the money you pay it's okay to take some food home. The cheesecake is to die for though. The service, ehh so-so. What can you say, it's a chain restaurant. :]"
Rob N.,"Sunnyvale, United States",23,18,,3.0,29/5/2012,"I like the cake. Other food are just ok. The waiting line is crazy, and you need to wait for 30 min+ even during week day. So make sure you have plenty of time for your dinner before you go."
T Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,11,2,1.0,19/11/2011,"Really disappointed with the GM of this Cheesecake Factory. Took my mom for a celebration dinner, and we were having a great time, but unfortunately for us a waiter tripped and pasta sauce went flying over mom. She felt a shower of cold sauce on her neck and hair, and had spots of the red! sauce on her wool coat (which was draped over her chair) as well as on her shirt and jeans. The waiter did apologize, and we know mistakes happen. Our waiter offered us a dry cleaning, and the manager came over and apologized and told us to come back with the dry cleaning bill for them to cover, which we accepted. We left right away as my mom needed a shower ASAP, got our barely eaten food to go,paid for our dinner and tipped generously, of course, as it was not our waiter's fault. However, it was embarrassing for my mother because we noticed the couple sitting next to us could not contain their laughing at the spilling of spaghetti sauce over my mom.To the couple: I don't see what is so funny about it, but thank you for your insensitivity. Needless to say it wasn't a very enjoyable night at the Cheesecake Factory Went to the dry cleaners and the owner stated he ""wasn't sure the stains would come out"", and was pretty sure the ""smell would not come out"". He said there was a way to get it out, but it would cause the jacket to shrink too much, which may make it too tight to wear. He also said in his experience, the restaurants were supposed to reimburse you with cash for the dry cleaning immediately, and was surprised this establishment did not do so. He said that what he has seen with his customers in some incidents were that restaurants conveniently had a ""short memory"" when it came to accidents like this, and would not reimburse if they did not recall such an incident. But we didn't know that, and of course, it wouldn't occur to us to demand cash on the spot, nor would it look very good on our part. The dry cleaners said he would do his best to clean it though. The jacket is not Chanel or anything I admit, but I got it for her for her birthday, so you can see why we were concerned. Anyway, my mom called the General Manager, who was rude. Said if the dry cleaning place ""claimed"" it could not be fixed that we can bring it over to him and they will clean it.  Acted like we were trying to get money out of it and that he was doing us a favor already by offering to dry clean.  Personally I think that is an expectation, not a favor. She tried to explain accidents happened, not here to report anybody (didn't even have the waiter's name) but was just concerned about what would happen if the dry cleaning could not remove the large stains of spaghetti sauce over her clothes. He did not want to listen, never once said he was sorry and acted too busy to attend to the mistakes of his staff. Really disappointed with the handling of this experience. An apology would have sufficed. Would reconsider eating here again and also want to tell my friends that they will not take responsibility if the waiters spill food on you."
Florence W.,"Fremont, United States",122,281,27,4.0,5/6/2009,"This is like an other Cheesecake Factory, but one event made this particular location stand out. My friend and I finally got seated after a long day of spending way too much money. The wait here is always long-ish, so be prepared for that. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which is really awesome. The food arrived and we started to dig in. After a few bites, I noticed a short straight hair on the other side of my pasta (the side I wasn't eating form, Thank God. I paused and had to ask myself what type of hair I had (long and wavy--not mine. EEK!). My friends and I were, needless to say, super grossed out. I flagged down the first server I saw and told her and she took it away. A minute later a manager came by and apologized for the incident and assured me it was an isolated event, which I did believe them. She asked if I wanted to order the same thing or something else, which I ended up choosing the Pasta Da Vinci. She offered me a soup or salad while I waited and I declined (I'm already eating carbs, do i need any more food in my belly?). It was a nice gesture, however and I did appreciate it. My original server came by and apologized for the incident as well, even though it was not her fault. Ten minutes later, another manager brought out my food and apologized. I really appreciated everyone's efforts and they handled the situation well. By the time the server brought our bill, she had taken off my pasta. It was extremely nice of her to do so, and I was prepared and expecting to pay for my meal, since everything turned out fine. She did not have to do so, but she insisted, so she got one big fat tip from us. The managers and the servers were extremely nice and remorseful about the incident, and I would definitely come back again.  Final Verdict: Despite the long wait, you should still come here. I found a hair in my food, which is my friend's biggest fear! Despite wanting to puke, everyone was really nice about the whole thing, their kindness and good customer service makes our hearts sing!"
Xi L.,"Cupertino, United States",9,2,6,4.0,13/11/2011,"I had Pasta Da Vinci and Red Velvet cheesecake, they taste good, but the amount is too large to finish... price is reasonable. waited for 20 minutes before seated."
Jenny Y.,"Milpitas, United States",60,126,216,5.0,25/5/2009,"All I can say is 'MORE CHEESECAKE PLEASE!' I love, love, love their cheesecake! So much, I order it first. Came here on May 23rd for 2 friend's Birthday dinner. Me and my brother shared a Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s. I also shared a Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake with a friend and it was like a 'food orgasm'. I would go all the way over there and wait their long lines anyday just for their fresh baked bread and cheesecake!"
Helen C.,"San Francisco, United States",257,334,97,2.0,8/7/2011,"The only time in my life when I really liked The Cheesecake Factory was back when I was in college and when places like this was a big splurge and plus there were not so many around at the time so it was a novelty.  But now...The CF to me is a place for humungous servings of food of mediocre quality.  I don't even really like the Cheesecake from here, it's good but not superior.  However, I would say when I do come here..everything is consistent..there is nothing to be disappointed about or really anything to like rave about...because it's ALWAYS the same thing.  This place is so generic that I am not sure if anyone really reads the reviews...but I thought I write one because I recently tried the TAMALE CAKES and became a fan of it..my friend ordered this and she let me have a bite.  It's pretty darn delicious.  It tastes like the Tomalito which I love from Chevy's but instead of a spoonful you get 3 huge pancake like servings.  However, I just learned how to make Sweet Corn Tomalitos myself and it's not very hard.  But the ones from TCF is pretty good still!"
Henry S.,"Dublin, United States",387,1497,49,4.0,6/7/2009,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend for a friend's birthday dinner.  There was a total of 7 adults and 4 kids.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  Never once did I ever have to ask for a refill.  Our waiter was on top of things.  We just enjoyed our time with friends and enjoyed our food.  Speaking of food....we ordered three different appetizers:  Avocado egg rolls, buffalo won ton wraps, and the friend calamari.  All were delicious, especially the buffalo chicken won ton wraps.  I ordered the chicken mushroom pizza with grilled onions and garlic.  The crust was thin and crispy and had great flavor.  I highly recommend coming to this CF if you are in the area."
Joan L.,"San Jose, United States",130,192,126,5.0,5/7/2009,"My all time favorite dessert is cheesecake & my daughter has followed my footsteps. Most kids want a fancy, big, frosted caked for their birthday. But not my daughter she requested for some cheesecake, a girl after my own heart. So we stopped by the Cheesecake Factory to pick some up. Of course we had to order the fresh strawberry cheesecake. CF has never held back on their strawberries, always sweet & delicious. I was craving for some chocolate cake so I decided to go with the Linda fudge cake. So yummy. If you're looking for layers & layers of rich chocolate cake plus fudge frosting than this is the cake for you.  But don't forget to have a nice glass of milk handy because you will surely need it."
Larry L.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,2.0,26/3/2012,"Service was good,  however they messed up one order on a table of eight.  Thai chicken was good.  My co diners claimed their sandwiches were dry and pasta under cooked Not worth the wait"
Lan L.,"Santa Clara, United States",16,92,12,5.0,16/9/2008,Things I hate about Cheesecake Factory: - the long wait Things I LOVE about Cheesecake Factory: * Cajun Jambalaya pasta * Luau salad * Tataki Seared Tuna salad * Avocado Egg Rolls * Frozen Iced Mango smoothie ** The cute waiter**  ;)
Michelle B.,"Santa Clara, United States",24,41,,2.0,27/9/2008,I used to love this place.. and I was in high school and thought Denny's Grand Slam was the best breakfast and would beg to have my birthday at TGIFridays.  There's a ridiculous long wait here and the menu has advertisements.. THE MENU HAS ADS?! It's already a book of a menu and then you have all these ads to look through. Annoying.  I now prefer restaurants to have a more refined/specialized menu as the food usually tastes better.  I'd love to see the nutrition facts for this place.. I'm sure they're pretty scary.  I threw in an extra star because the cheesecake is AMAZING I do have to admit.
Shauna S.,"San Francisco, United States",149,904,19,4.0,26/4/2009,"This review is only for the Banana Cream Cheesecake -- to go. We waited for a long time before the 7"" cake finally came out then it took a good number of hours to finally defrost. I'm not going to hold that against them since it seemed an awful amount of kids were at the location and it was the weekend. The cake was delicious and well worth the wait, especially great with a cup of coffee -- even if it is midnight."
Eva D.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,13,,5.0,30/12/2011,"Came here for my 21st birthday with 11 of my friends. I made a reservation the day before, and when we were seated almost right away when we came in, despite the super busy crowd by the host stand.  Our waiter, Jeremey, was more than great. He was very nice and listened to our every need. It did not bother him that we had some late folks and he assured us it isnt a problem. Water glasses were always filled and he was always near the table to answer any question and fullfill any need. All of the food tasted great. It came out super fast (again, despite the business of the restaurant) and not a single person had a complaint.  I got a free birthday sunday with my name spelled out on it even and I was sung to! It was awesome. Usually large parties are not given as much attention as small parties, but jeremey definitely had our back. I was very impressed with everything and will definitely be back :) thank you cheesecake factory, for an amazing birthday dinner!"
Liz T.,"San Jose, United States",4,8,,5.0,8/8/2009,The manger Jason here is the best. I had a minor incident at the curbside to go a couple weeks ago and he ended up calling me the next day to apologize for what happened. Not only did he apologize but sent a gift card. This place treats their customers well and I will of course continue to frequent this one at Valley Fair. I have never gone wrong with anything I have ordered and of course the staff is super attentive.Thanks.
Nilanjana C.,"Cupertino, United States",16,34,,3.0,13/9/2011,"my previous experiences there have been much better. this sunday pasta was a disaster and i'm still giving them 3 stars to appreciate the service. hopefully, i will enjoy the next meal there..."
Irfan R.,"San Jose, United States",370,517,37,4.0,6/6/2008,"Cheesecake is known for it's desserts (the dulce caramel is the best), but it also has pretty good food.  The crab cakes are excellent.  So is the crab cake sandwich.  The Jamacian Black Pepper Shrimp is great.  Salmon is good.  Portions are huge.  The honey wheat and sourdough bread is nice.  Try to iced mango drink.  Sometimes the wait is long, but worth it if you havent been here before.  Dont forget to save some room for the cheesecake:)!"
R S.,"San Jose, United States",10,36,,1.0,1/10/2011,"What a sour experience!  I  took a friend of mine who came from out of town to dinner here and sang its praises in advance.  First of all, it took forever to get service. The  poor waitress was new , confused and  it was obvious that English was not her native tongue-- that, coupled along with the noisy roar in the restaurant,  you can imagine the results!  After what seemed an eternity, my salad came first and then my friend's meal-- with all the wrong ingredients in it. By now, he was so hungry and agitated  that we did not want to  reorder since it would take another  eternity for the meal to come back-- the manager apologized and did not offer to do anything about it-- and I was charged full fare for my meal-- I was so embarrassed when my friend said , ""Let's go get fast food where the service is better!""  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory because I will never take friends or people I want to impress to this establishment again! To be truthful, it was  an embarrassing evening for me and left a most unsavory feeling in my stomach."
