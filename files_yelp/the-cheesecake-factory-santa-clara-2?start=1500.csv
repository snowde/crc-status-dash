Rich A.,"San Diego, United States",3,40,,5.0,29/8/2007,"I love the Cheesecake factory. I usually eat at the Valley Fair location but have also eatin at Oakridge Mall, Palo Alto, Chicago, and Las Vegas. It's too bad people give it bad markings because of the waiting time to eat. DUH! There are tons of people there because it is a great place!  My 3 favorite dishes: 1) Miso Salmon. If you like Salmon, you will be blown away by this dish. Although I get it with steamed broccoli instead of the fries. 2) The Incredible Eggplant sandwich is one of the greatest sandwiches in the world. Grilled eggplant, grilled peppers, melted mozzarella cheese, and a garlic spread. A little bit messy but unbelieveable! 3) Fresh Fish Tacos. - Very tasty and 3 huge soft tacos with beans and rice.  You probably won't be able to finish it. Also, I LOVE the brown bread they serve when you sit down. AWESOME!!! Great place...one of my favorites!"
David O.,"Foster City, United States",15,205,727,4.0,8/3/2009,"Cheesecake Factory 3/7/2009 Valley Fair 7PM  My wife and I thought we would end a day of errands and shopping at the Valley Fair mall and then hit the Cheesecake Factory for dinner... when we arrived at 7PM the restaurant was packed, the polite hostess told us 35 to 40 minutes and handed us a vibrating caller thing, but when we finally sat down it was over an hour, not that we minded any we were prepared and so should you.... the bar is very accommodating  my better half had a Caribbean cooler and I had the Mai Tai and both of us proceeded to get a buzz while enjoying the delicious authentic drinks that remind us of Hawaii,,, while waiting you cant help noticing the neat architecture that is in the spirit  of a Las Vegas strip hotel, the hustle and bustle of people working, talking and waiting to have dinner in my opinion is invigorating, also there are car hops running out to designated parking spots in the parking lot taking orders and delivering food like a 50 burger dinner, Yum... For us this was a great place at that moment in time, we have been to Palo Alto & SF CFs but the Valley Fair really was over the top stupendous quality excitement, I had an awesome Skirt Steak and my wife had the Hibachi steak medallions  both were incredible (did you hear that Town?) both were cooked medium rare and delivered to us perfectly cooked with seasoning  that was second to none. I highly recommend this place for a fun festive get together or even a dinning experience to brighten up your day. Steaks are about $20.00 to $30 depending on what you order foo foo drinks will set you back $7 or $8, all in all they offer many reasonable priced dishes ranging from around $11.00 on up. Be sure to stroll the dining room to see what other people are eating to get the blood pumping :-D Oh yea be sure to get some Cheesecake!"
T Is For Tom N.,"San Jose, United States",304,219,,3.0,19/9/2008,"Good food definitely a lot better than their other location off the Oakridge Mall because that place is horrible ( I ordered pasta de vinci and they mixed two types of pasta in my dish and the chicken was not fully cooked and they once served me with a burnt cajun rib eye steak). Overall, I get the same dishes that I get at the other Cheesecake, but I prefer the food and service here a lot more maybe because it is a bigger store so they care more about their customer feedbacks? Who knows, but I just feel a lot more comfortable here. Try these if you are a newcomers to the restaurant and you won't be disappointed -Pasta De Vinci  -Chicken Madeira with Steak Diane - Must have their Frozen Iced Mango Oh ! and who would be able to resist their wheat and sourdough bread!!!! Yum"
Connie L.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,2.0,1/1/2010,"Visited this location for the third time just before CHristmas.  It was against my better judgement as I have had horrible service in the past.  I actually walked out after sitting in a booth for 20 minutes while staff walked by and failed to even bring a glass of water.   This time, although the service was still so-so, we were at least acknowledged quickly and the meal was served in a more timely fashion.  I still would not recommend this location. I lived in LA and visited the original restaurants for years - I think the corporate office would be very disappointed in this location."
Starla L.,"San Francisco, United States",45,139,204,4.0,29/3/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has so many items on their menu, it's hard to decide what to get. I've been here many times and have ordered safe items like fettucini, angel hair pasta, or the like.  But on this occasion, I checked out Yelp to see what others recommended, and am so glad I did. I think the Cheesecake Factory experience is so much better with the right choice of foods. I tried the Chicken Madeira, which comes topped with mushrooms and asparagus and a huge side of mashed potatoes. It was delicious! The chicken was so tender and infused with the sauce. I love mushrooms so it was a plus that it was included in the meal. The mashed potatoes were creamy and had a great subtle flavor. I was only able to finish half of the entree, as their portions are very generous. I'm looking forward to lunch tomorrow when I get to finish the leftovers. My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which was surprisingly good. The chipotle pepper mayo sauce that it comes with gives it a kick. The cheesecake selection is great. I have noticed also that the slices are smaller than they used to be. We still ended up taking half of our shared 30th Anniversary slice home though. The dinner was very filling. Other good items I've tried in the past: Luau Salad, Louisiana Chicken Pasta  and Tiramisu cheececake."
monkey p.,"San Jose, United States",8,108,5,2.0,29/4/2008,"the food served here is probably the most expensive crap i've ever eaten.  i really wanted to like this place because i love their cheesecake ... but the food is horrendous!  every time i've gone it's been a disappointment.  i've tried their pastas, salads, steaks, appetizers.  nothing is appealing.  the noodles are always overcooked, the dressing on the salads taste suspect, the steak is just okay.  nothing special about the appetizers that you can't get at any other place.  maybe i'm just ordering the wrong thing every time?  i don't know.  the menu IS like a novel.  the wait is always long.  service takes forever.  maybe there too many tables per server.   only thing i like about this place is the cheesecake.  it is delicious.  5 stars for the cheesecake.  -3 for everything else."
Mary T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",38,652,89,5.0,23/3/2008,"I had a great time here last night with Cal. I might be a bit biased because Kim D. waited on us and is the main reason why we had a great time. I had to try the soup of the day. It was cream of chicken, and I have to admit that it was better than the crab bisque at Nordstrom Cafe. For our main entrees, Cal got the Caesar and I had the the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. I thought Cal's salad was pretty good, different because it was more garlicy than we're used to, but still good. I loved loved loved my sliders. They were super cute and fun to eat. I could only eat 1 and a half (there were 4) because I ate too much of the yummy bread. I got the vanilla honey coffee drink, and it was good, but so sweet that I couldn't finish it. I'll stick with regular lattes and cappuccinos. Because we stuffed our faces, we decided to pass on the cheesecake. Next time, definitely next time."
Sharon Z.,"San Jose, United States",2,7,1,1.0,15/8/2011,"When I came in I was told the waiting is 20 end up waiting 1:15 min, not even one apology, no problem there are many other places around, it was not the first time we waited longer but at least the manger apologized before, not today, will never come again."
Margi T.,"Saratoga, United States",84,446,76,1.0,10/1/2009,"I HATE the Cheesecake Factory! Maybe if they didn't have like 200+ mediocre items on their menu and they focused on ~50 instead, their dishes would actually be better. Why are there always like 20+ irritated people waiting around the entrance for tables, along with who knows how many on the waiting list roaming the mall. The food is not that good. The service is lousy. I've never once had the patience to wait for a table here. My husband and I have done take-out at least eight times, but aside from the dessert...it's nothing special. But it is overpriced. You can dine better, South Bay!"
Kimberly B.,"San Jose, United States",104,428,25,3.0,23/2/2009,"my friends and i struck lucky. we got a really good parking spot right near the front entrance of the restaurant and only had to wait 2 minutes before we got seated. we came on a sunday afternoon around 12:20pm, so we were quite surprised that we didn't have to wait too long. i think the rush started right after we sat though, so the earlier, the better. all the food here is really good, but my renee's special was mediocre. they gave me an ample amount of Caesar salad and a huge cup of their soup with my turkey sandwich, but my turkey sandwich didn't taste that good. it was really bland, and the turkey was pretty dry. i'd recommend getting another lunch item instead. i also heard that their chicken salad sandwich isn't that good either.  the lunch specials really aren't that much of a money saver if you look at the regular prices of their other pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches. you can get a much better-tasting sandwich or burger for a buck or two more than the renee's lunch special. i think i'm going to do that instead. our first server was totally whack and absolutely LAZY because he was going on break soon. our 2nd server that covered him was much, much better. the first guy didn't give us straws to sip our drinks with and didn't come out with bread either. he also tried rushing us on our order in hopes of ringing it in before the 2nd server covered him. whaacckkkkk. anyway, we're glad that the 2nd server was an absolute sweetie and was really attentive to our table.  this place will never be worth the 1 hour wait that people go through on a regular basis when they eat here."
Steve L.,"San Jose, United States",0,20,,3.0,23/9/2011,"Always seem to get a decent salad here, but I have not been overwhelmed with the Pizza's.  I like the BBQ chopped chicken salad, but the calorie counts here have always concerned me.  Still, a fun, and decent place, but not really special."
Cary W.,"San Jose, United States",29,196,26,2.0,22/8/2006,"A martini at this place is $9, which is around what really nice restaurants and lounges charge. But at the Cheesecake factory? What really, really, really annoys me though are those stupid ads in the menu.  Their cheesecakes aren't bad...but overrated. Almost anything will taste good if you put a fist-sized mound of whipped cream on top of it."
Raymond G.,"Rocklin, United States",75,266,,2.0,14/7/2006,$7.00 per slice. Waaaaaaaaay overpriced below average cheesecake. Did I mention it was $7.00 per slice?
Preston Y.,"Sunnyvale, United States",422,64,33,3.0,30/1/2011,"The place definitely is not as good as it used to be...the food is often pretty heavy.  But portions are large and cheesecakes are still as good as ever.  I especially love this location bc of its proximity to Santana Row.  While everything else closes really early, Cheesecake is open a bit later so you can just stagger over there on the shoulder of your friends and satisfy your late night craving."
Fiel R.,"San Jose, United States",411,176,232,5.0,29/12/2008,We had some gift cards to use so we went here again on Sunday.. the double bacon cheeseburger was awesome.. only could finish half like usual...
RUBEN R.,"Newark, United States",49,82,17,4.0,25/1/2009,this place is always a good place. the wait can be a while sometimes. always loud and can sometimes be hard to hear who ur with. everthing really good. love!!!!! the crab won tons they get me drooling every time i think about them.  and best thing u can get a order of cheese cake to go. sometimes me and my gf just gets cheese cake to go and eat it in the car.
Puchu ..,"San Jose, United States",12,89,,1.0,9/5/2006,Horrible food in large quantities.  Really the only reason to ever go here is because you are in a very large group and are unable to do a walkin anywhere else.  Hmm.  Maybe getting takeout and crashing somewhere might be better then going to Cheesecake Factory.
Jeff H.,"San Francisco, United States",1,93,11,3.0,17/12/2008,"I had a relatively enjoyable experience at this place.  It took us a while to realize that this place isn't actually connected to the mall.  I walked all over the mall and had to ask the information booth.  Now I know.   Once inside, we had to wait just a bit for a table.  I can't imagine going to this place Friday - Sunday.  We were seated in the area next to the bar; I would have preferred an area less open and loud.  Yeah, the restaurant decor looks fabulous but I don't pay attention to things like that.  I care primarily about food, followed by service. I was amazed by the vastness of the menu.  I think its ridiculous to have such a large menu encompassing so many types of food.  They could cut the menu in half and I still think it would be more than adequate.  She had the Steak Diane, I had the Cajun Jambalaya.  The former was delicious, the latter was too dry.  The portion sizes of both were very generous.  If you finish your entree here and don't suffer from food coma immediately after I would be impressed.     So the food was OK overall, I just wish that they pare down the menu and the quantity size (just a bit) and focus their energy on delivering dishes that taste better.  Also, the cheesecake is delicious but $7 dollars per slice?  Maybe they sprinkle crack on it? The service was good though.  No complaints here about that."
Mabel L.,"San Jose, United States",131,102,23,4.0,26/6/2008,"I'll admit it. I love going to The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, there are many more non-franchise, mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall, unique eateries in San Jose, but sometimes you just want huge portions of yummy American fare in a fun environment. I love that they have a million things on their menu and everything I've tried has come out pretty tasty. The servers are usually attentive and fun, and I forgive them for slow service when it's packed in there, which is most nights. I enjoy sitting in the huge booths and getting endless warm bread and butter. Overall, whenever I come with my friends I have a great time and am usually stuffed because their servings are so huge. This restaurant is definitely a staple that I enjoy coming to once in awhile. I would just recommend against going on weekend evenings because it's usually packed. I like going on random weekdays or late at night so I can get seated and served quickly.  My favorites: Bistro Shrimp Pasta Kobe Burger Crispy Chicken Costoletta Chicken Madeira Tomato Mozzarella Salad Yes, their portions are big. Don't go here if you're on a diet or will freak out about ""too much food."" (why you would do that? I have no idea) I find it most manageable to share with a couple friends."
Janet L.,"Milpitas, United States",246,83,25,4.0,8/4/2008,"Let's start by saying that the waits are ALWAYS painfully long for dinner, no matter which night you go. I believe the service is always spectacular. The food is good, depends on what you order. The calamari appetizer is DELICIOUS. Luau salad is great as well. The other things I've tried weren't as memorable, but of course, they get the 4 stars because THEIR CHEESECAKE IS WONDERFUL! (Overpriced, but hey, once in awhile, you gotta get yourself a treat!)"
