Angel A.,"Santa Clara, United States",21,60,9,2.0,30/8/2006,"What is with the hype? I can't believe with all the amazing places to eat in the Bay Area people wait OVER 2 HOURS for a table here. The food isn't bad, but it's nothing special. The portions are big, but so are the prices.  No one ever has room for cheesecake, but you order it anyway since it's in the name.  Good marketing on their part.  It's a place to go when you want to feel like your hip, but not willing to wait 3 hours across the street at Santana Row.  No thanks, I'll meet you at Falafel's Drive-In."
Julia C.,"Santa Clara, United States",83,736,78,2.0,15/4/2008,"Crappy parking, ridiculously long wait, expensive mediocre food, decent drinks."
Kay V.,"San Jose, United States",199,73,3,2.0,31/5/2006,"when they first opened at this location i truly was excited b/c it's so near to home. but now i'd rather drive far far away to the SF spot despite the long wait. no matter what night it is...this is NOT the spot to go with a party larger than 8. for a mid-week night we still waited nearly 2 hours when they first told us 1 hr 10 min. & the only thing they gave us on the house was 1 piece of cheesecake for a party of 10.  it was worse to find out that there was another large table open behind the one we were seated at!! another recent time i ate here with a big group they tried to split us up in 2 seperate booths. they have the worse seating arrangements/planning skills!!  i really do just come here for the chicken madeira or miso salmon for my main dish, avocado egg rolls to start, & vanilla bean cheesecake!"
Steve S.,"San Jose, United States",9,85,15,3.0,21/12/2008,"Food is great. Chicken Madeira, Bistro Shrimp Pasta, and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (my fav.) were all delicious. Waited nearly 30 min. for a table, waiters asked us 5+ times if we were done with our food, waters weren't refilled regularly. They should have like a Cheesecake Express, kinda like Panda Express cause I really like the food, but don't want to wait around to eat it ya know?"
Mitch A.,"San Francisco, United States",1347,481,149,1.0,10/5/2006,"The chesiest chain out there.  If you go, make sure you leave your culture at home and be a typical stupid American. BLAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
S. L.,"San Francisco, United States",4,83,,2.0,15/12/2006,"I hate this place, who wants to wait an hour at the mall? Not me! They give you like 10lbs of food which is all just ""ok"" but it is so not worth the wait. The only thing I would consider picking up from here is the damn cheesecake if that. This is all hype."
Chris C.,"Union City, United States",51,549,15,3.0,29/5/2007,"The GF and I decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory because we had a $50 Gift Certificate.  Cheesecake Factory is a mid-upper mid level restruarant chain that caters to 3 main items:  1)  About 30+ different selection of Cheesecake, 2) A pretty wide menu and big menu ranging from American, Chinese, & Southwest 3)  Humgo Portion sizes. We got here about 5:30ish which was just in time to beat the dinner time rush.  Cheesecake Factor has this upscale venician feel to it.  Very open, very pleasant, but with all the open space it can get very loud.  We waited about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  We were seated at a nice table and the waiter had the menus to us right away.  CF has a pretty big menu selection.  Most of their food options range either in the American, Asian, or Southwest realm.  They have a big selection of salads, sandwiches, and pasta with several vegetarian options.  They also have a pretty big mixed drink selection if you want to get your drink on.  Most appetizers here range in the $5-$8 range and most meals you can get under $17. The GF and I decided on the small house salad, the Corn Tamale Cakes, I got the Cuban Sandwich and she got the Grilled Cheese.  We also ordered drinks and I got the Raspberry Lemonade.  The Raspberry Lemonade was pretty good, it also helps that I have a sweet tooth, so I didn't mind it being on the sweet side.  We got the Corn Tamale Cakes and small house salad, and we forgot the number item at Cheesecake Factory, everything is served in SUPER HUGE SIZE.  The small house salad would put most restaurants regular salads to shame.  It was huge.  And the Corn Tamale Cakes, 3 big corn cakes stacked with salsa, sour cream, and slices of avacados.  After eating about half, we were both stuffed.  Then came the sandwiches, both were HUGE.  About triple the size of most places.  Both my Cuban and Grilled Cheese were pretty good.  The fries... they were very forgetful.  We both barely got through a quarter of our sandwiches and about half of our fries.  There was just TOO MUCH FOOD! We save enough room for the Apple Crisp (though they have 30+ selections of cheesecake, the GF isn't much of cheesecake fan).  There was more than enough for the two.  We probably only ate about a third of it.  We ended up taking home 2 bags worth of food which ended up being lunch and dinner the next day.  Not too bad that we got almost 3 meals for about $55 including tip. After eating here, I've come to realize, places like the Cheesecake Factory is why Americans are fat.  We were one of the few people there who didn't finish their plate full of food, which was AMAZING.  But overall, I enjoyed coming here.  I thought the food was good and the ambiance was pleasant, and the server well trained.  I know people who like to knock a place because it's a ""chain"", but if you like the food, the service was good, and the ambiance pleasing, why knock it for being a chain.  Solid 3.5 Resturant!"
M M.,"San Jose, United States",2,49,,4.0,12/5/2009,"Went yesterday for lunch and decided on getting 2 appz from the lunch menu, wild mushroom pizzette & the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates - also sat at the bar! Dates - 5 of 5 - AWESOME!!! the dates were stuffed with parmesean cheese, a little too much, perhaps a nuttier cheese would have raised it another level, but it was very tasty - they used a whole strip of bacon where half of one would have worked, i love them for that!  It was crispy and had some pieces of fat, which i also like, and it smelled soooo good too.  They roast them, btw. Wild Mushroom Pizzette - 3 of 5 - bigger than i thought it was going to be, but small enough to where i was not full afterwards.  Crust was nice and crispy and tasted fresh, it was topped with mushrooms, garlic, herbs & cheese - no sauce - which was pleasant - i dont know if its because i ate the dates first but it wasnt as hot as i would have liked - mushrooms were not over-cooked like on most pizza's but it didnt have that right temperature i enjoy when eating pizza - herbs and cheese were fine. Service - 5 of 5 - James is good peoples.  He had this weird customer like 3 seats to my left, and dude was asking lot's of lame questions and was quite demanding and somehow James kept a good spirit and delivered the same awesome service when most would have been annoyed, commend him for that - what made me truly know that this customer was weird was when he started talking about his Houston Rockets and how when they win the title Tracy McGrady was going to be named MVP - to this i laughed, but alas, it was not a joke, he was dead serious, i politely turned and finished my food and left."
Stan H.,"San Francisco, United States",13,127,277,3.0,1/2/2009,"Cheescake Factory is just as good as the Palo Alto location. The food is nothing to laugh about (with the tasty concoctions and large portions), so it's worth it's price. The menu is expansive with all kinds of tasty new American cuisine. I couldn't finish my tasty meatloaf and as usual, had to take a doggy bag. It's just that big!!! These places can get very crowded, so come really early. The service was okay considering the busy weekend dinner rush, but it's slow at times. There's just too many people and too few quick working waiters (they're all very considerate and attentive). If you enjoy a casual and filing meal with friends and family (with drinks if you want), then come here EARLY."
Stacey G.,"San Francisco, United States",11,177,170,3.0,22/12/2008,"I had an avocado chicken club sandwich, it was huge! Their portions are enormous here.  The service was a little lacking and everyone is always squeezed in at the tables - far better off getting a booth. The strawberry lemonade is delicious. I kept asking for water but never came."
Monica H.,"San Jose, United States",927,683,956,2.0,20/9/2010,"i really am still amazed how so much people still come here! well i guess im just a bit of an anti food chain person... but it is the only restaurant at Valleyfair mall aside from California's Pizza Kitchen that was open after 9pm..- so okay. whatevs. we came here for Dinner. As usual, the wait was incredibly LONG. Say 45mins for a table for 2.  The food..hmm.. I had Crispy beef with Rice...it's decent...but you can just feel it clog your arteries after every bite you take. there's too much Salt. and it was pricey when i know..I just know it could be a lot better and a lot more tasty at my next door Chinese place in the hood. BF ordered the Wasbi Crusted Ahi Tuna. The name on the menu looked droolingly good and different. I wanted to order it for myself, but he wanted something soft so he stole my order. so anyway...It was a bit disappointing. It lacked taste. It looked like a salmon patty you can buy from a Grocery Store. So BF and I exchanged plates several times because he just wasn't enjoying his order. And for $22...it wasn't worth it at all! Oh! there's one thing i like!! the strawberyy lemonde and red velvet cheesecake (only if i have 2 other friends share it with me though. because it's too sweet and too fattening for one person) I will never plan on going here again...unless i have to."
Eric O.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,,4.0,27/7/2013,"great place, awesome atmosphere. i can relax here. menu has an excellent variety of foods to try every time i come here. of course, who can hate the cheesecake here? it is their freaking name! good service. i dont come here often but when i do im not disappointed."
Taun T.,"San Jose, United States",268,182,3,2.0,27/5/2007,"The service is good. I like the brown bread they give as appetizers. The rest of the food is just awful. Sure the cheesecake is good, but the entrees are horrible. So fattening, with not much flavor. The portions are huge. The wait just to get a table takes forever. 25 minutes at least. Definately not worth it for such revolting food."
SugarSHER B.,"CA, United States",26,25,1,2.0,23/1/2007,"Every time I hear 'oh so-n-so is having their birthday party at Cheesecake Factory' a feeling of dread overcomes me. The wait is painfully long, I think one time we waited almost close to 3hrs! They don't take reservations, and besides the chicken madiera the food isn't all that great! The cheesecake is fine but if I can order it one in the waiting area! Oh and the lighting is too dark for me, I like to see the color of my food without all the dark yellow lighting!"
Ben I.,"Austin, United States",7,21,,1.0,2/12/2006,"I could go on and on about the ludicrous wait, the slow service, mediocre food, high prices, 3rd party ads in menu's, astonishingly annoying clientele, and stupefying popularity.  But all I'll say is this, and I say it as a native New Yorker:  If you go here for the cheesecake, you must not like cheesecake."
JAYE m.,"San Jose, United States",4,25,16,4.0,2/4/2009,"the cheesecake factory, man when i first herd of this joint i was like, ""dude i wanna eat food, not cheese cake"", but ever since i been thier im a fan. you would not imagine the cheesecake factory to look how it does with a name like that but it has to be one of the most eligant resturaunt's i've eating at. the prices are well worth the it some range up to $30 the highest. every time i go thier it always has me smiling when i leave.  p.s if you want a bomb dinner with the family order fried zucinni, calimari, fried macaronni balls, or salmon egg rolls as your appitizer."
Lynne C.,"Tracy, United States",44,10,,5.0,26/3/2009,I love Cheesecake and I most especially love going to the one at Valleyfair so I can walk off my food after. Avocado Eggrolls is the best there! And if you love Garlic order the Garlic Noodles too!
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, United States",446,2659,990,2.0,28/12/2006,"I have been to several Cheesecake factories and this by far is not the best for a variety of reasons. The parking situation is horrible (but considering it is Silicon Valley and people don't know how to drive-- it is to be expected). Fortunately we got there before the three hour wait, however it took them a while to get us seated after telling us our table was ready. Our waitress was not the most diligent person on earth-- I have had better service at McDonalds. She referred to the drink special as a ""non alcoholic something or other that tasted good.""--- umm okay... She got two out of the four orders wrong... which for the sake of time we said ""whatever."" The fries were dried out as if under a heat lamp, the chicken strips my friend ordered were rock hard... I was unimpressed by the Chicken Salad Sandwich... She did not card my friend (who although is of drinking age) which was unprofessional and a lapse on her part.  She did not come by to check up on us-- until  recommending dessert... the waitress. forgot I had ordered coffee and my friends were 1/2 done with dessert by the time it came... although it is the closest Cheesecake Factory to where I live-- I am definitely traveling the extra 30 minutes to the City"
Gene A.,"Brooklyn, United States",244,412,25,1.0,28/3/2007,"Aside from the huge portions of food that is mediocre at best, this happened awhile back and is why I gave this place one star: I went the Cheesecake Factory at the Valley Fair Mall with my now, ex-girlfriend. Upon eating our Thai Lettuce Wrap appetizer, I bit down on something hard. It turned out to be one of those plastic tabs that hold bread bags together. I immediately called a waiter over. A manager came by to tell us that the appetizer was going to be ""taken care of"". Later, the waitress lagged on serving us, more particularly, taking 10-15 minutes to fetch a simple glass of wine. Again, it took another 10-15 minutes to receive the bill, and when we did, we found that the appetizer was still on the bill. I then asked to speak to a manager. All he offered was to ""take care"" of the appetizer, to which, I gave him a look of awe and anger. He then offered free cheesecake, to which i gave him another look of dissatisfaction. I then said to him, ""You're the manager. You obviously want to take care of the customer. What do you feel is necessary to do so?"" He ended up giving us a 30 dollar gift card which only covered half of our meal. This also took another 10 minutes to get. Not only that, but we ended up not being able to go to see a movie, which we've been planning on seeing for over a month. Furthermore, one of the servers disclosed the fact that another customer found a rubberband in his broccoli the other day. In summary, they (the Cheesecake Factory) are lucky that a little child or anyone else did not choke on that plastic tab. But then again, they are very unlucky, because this is going to be put out to every facet i can access."
Keren M.,"San Jose, United States",22,73,28,4.0,7/5/2011,"we've actually been here many times but today was exceptionally good.  our server, Ashley, was so nice (and beautiful too :))  and everything we have ordered was very very good.  i had the simply grilled salmon with steamed asparagus and carrots (trying to lose some weight...). the carrots were supposed to be steamed too but they had oil on them. of course i ate that too , it was yummy... (I'll cry about that later).  on the side i had the small Greek salad with the dressing on the side.  didn't eat the dressing , the salad was very flavorful without it so why not save those cals for the cake, ha?  this Greek salad had arugula which i thought did not go well with the rest of the ingredients but over all it was fresh and light.  my husband had the bistro shrimp pasta that was sooooooooo good!!!  unfortunately , i had a little taste and ended up having more than enough... boo hoo. I'm so bad.  my husband also had the ahi carpaccio as appetizer, and it was very good too.  my daughter ate a new kids dish which is chicken sliders. its nice! (too much bread i think but very tasty. she ate it all).  we also had the bikini martini that is sweet , very sweet! strong too!  my head was spinning !! perhaps i was so drunk that i had the dolche de leche cheesecake without giving it a second thought.  bad bad bad!! no more food for me today!!!  gotta hit the gym. bye."
