Jordan P.,"West Hollywood, United States",87,56,,2.0,7/5/2006,It just depends on how much you like waiting around.  It's overrated.  It's doesn't come highly recommended.
Christopher R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, United States",116,21,6,4.0,14/9/2006,"""You know, people give this place alot shit for no reason.  You know the portions are large, so deal with it.  Split something.  If you dont like it, Arbys is right across the street.  For being the Leader in the resteraunt Industry and having by far some of ther best incentives to be an employee there, it is quite a catch.  I love my Job, no matter how much I gripe about it.  No other resteraunt, in fact, ANY customer service oriented business, would have the managers bend over backwards to make sure you leave with a smile.  The servers go through a 2 week training course so they know what they are doing when they are ready to serve you.  There are tests you would expect  to find in colleges, not for new hires.  Before I became a Bartender here, I had only visited once and was thoroughly impressed with the food and quality of service and the eagerness by EVERY staff member to accomadate.  If you are looking for a place that has a Huge list of delecious Drinks and food, as well as a GREAT staff, this is the place for you. Especially if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg."""
beno h.,"Santa Clara, United States",282,398,315,3.0,5/8/2008,"my cousin told me about anti-asian racism by the staff here years ago.  me, i never experienced it.  i've seen many asian servers here, and servers of all races have treated me here fine.  the servers are usually really friendly.  furthermore, i read in _the_blue_pages_ that this company has good business practices and politics. my favourite dish here is the sweet corn tamale cakes.  i enjoy most of the dishes and beers here.  the menu is a little diverse in that they offer gentrified, watered-down, americanised version of dishes from a small variety of cultures.  i guess that's the most objective way to put it.  i don't mean anything particularly bad by that.  i mean, i'm fine with it.  i'll eat at p.f. chang's or el torito, no problem.  the portions are huge, really huge. at the same time, one reason i won't give this place any more than three stars is that the waiters here tend to try hard to upsell.  as i said, the portions are huge.  you really don't need to order too much.  however, yeah, it seems like well, the waiters pressure you to order drinks, appetizers, entrees, of course cheesecake, and after meal drinks... everything.  i've fallen into the trap before.  also, the wait here usually really long."
Liz A.,"Watsonville, United States",5,109,,4.0,13/1/2008,"This location is slightly better than the other location in San Jose.  I've always had good service here, but it is the Cheesecake Factory which means pricey but good food and portions.  Again, I reiterate the quality of the Red Raspberry Martinis, however if you are not willing to shell out $10.50 per glass, you might want to pass (or share).  Always get a booth, otherwise you are pretty much sharing a table with people you don't know, and depending on the conversation and company it could make for an unpleasant evening"
Martin G.,"South San Francisco, United States",307,198,17,3.0,20/4/2009,"went down there on Sunday with my wife and kid I am not to big of a fan of the place, but I will say compared to the one in Palo Alto this was way better. The wait was 5 minutes the server was very good!!! and the food was not bad. I shared a plate of pizza and salad with my 2 years. The only thing I would want to see there would be a kids menu. Other than that. it was good I would advise if you have the chance get there at lunch cheaper and you get  a good size portion"
Andy N.,"Milpitas, United States",23,20,16,3.0,22/10/2008,"The service is good, but the food is pretty mediocre. With the price you pay for it, it should be really good but really, its just the hype.  If you're getting steak, go to a steak place. If you're getting pasta, go to a pasta place etc etc etc. The only thing thats probably worth it here is the cheesecake itself. one star for you."
Hoa Q.,"Santa Clara, United States",47,404,,4.0,24/7/2008,"The food doesn't excite me, but this has become one of my default places to go with my friends because of its versatility.  There's a great variety food for everyone, even if you're a super picky or super safe eater.  For the broke, there's also a bottomless basket of bread.  The big slices of cheesecake are yummy but really rich and sweet.  They're great for sharing.  The waiters are always friendly, even after being asked inappropriate questions by your nosy friends.  It is formal enough to make our dinners a special occasion but casual enough not to leave us starving for the rest of the month after paying the bill."
Karen C.,"Belvedere Tiburon, United States",195,341,66,1.0,25/7/2008,Came here on a rainy Friday night.  Waited 45 minutes to be seated.  Food was awful and overpriced.  Yuck!  It may be better with a group.  Gonna try to Oakridge location.  Maybe it's better.
Urittnaz J.,"Dublin, United States",8,20,2,5.0,4/7/2011,My favorite place to go to when hungry and when I'm looking for a nice atmospher to chill out with the boys!
Lloyd C.,"Campbell, United States",130,154,12,5.0,6/4/2007,"I give it 5 stars because i love their deserts here and mainly only go here for that, usually take out haha. My all time favorite is the tiramisu and the dulce de leche cheesake and the tiramisu cheesecake."
Linh N.,"Union City, United States",81,26,361,3.0,30/10/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory is not all its hype up to be, service is there but the food lacks what you would expect. The price you pay is not really worth what your eating. Overall I wouldn't be going here for anything other then cheesecake."
Yong L.,"San Jose, United States",3,25,13,3.0,5/5/2013,"cheese cake it so good it so expensive but it,s worth it for once an awhile"
Vincent C.,"San Jose, United States",0,54,3,3.0,22/1/2009,"A lot of the stuff on the menu is so ordinary, that it is not worth waiting 30+ minutes to be seated.   That being said, I really like their Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp entree and some of their fried appetizers.  What makes it special is the black pepper sauce. It's sweet and spicy and sour and salty all at once.  It goes great with the white rice.  The black beans are also quite tasty.  I normally do not eat the beans anywhere else.  The mango salsa is ok. And you get some fried plantains.   Oh, and there's some shrimp too.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory maybe a half a dozen times and have settled on this as the reason to go there.   The cheesecake is way too sweet.  I ordered it once and never again."
T M.,"San Jose, United States",11,346,22,3.0,15/8/2007,"This place is a bit overrated.  The food is good, but not as good as you think it would be.  I've ordered a salad, chicken tortilla soup, and some kind of fish separate visits from this restaurant.  The salad and the soup wasn't very impressive.  If anything I would come back for just the cheesecake, in particular the tiramisu cheesecake.  Also, it's too expensive for what you get."
Anna T.,"San Jose, United States",24,20,24,3.0,12/4/2007,"If you want some cheesecake, then this is the right place to stop by. The last time I went there was like last year. It always crowded everytime I stop by, usually weekday is less wait. They don't take reservation, last time I had a group about 12 people and we have to wait close to two hours. That's totally sucks. no reservation !! Nice atmosphere  & decoration but sorta noisy for conversation."
Jasmin J.,"San Leandro, United States",51,46,8,2.0,7/9/2010,"I was excited to have dinner at the Valley Fair Cheese Cake Factory being that I had never been there before. It was my girlfriends 19th birthday and she had a party of 28. Being that none of the restaurants take reservation she got there and hour early to make her ""in-person"" reservation at 6:30. Time went by an as 7:30 rolled around the hostess told her and her guest we would be waiting 45 minutes to be seated. Some of our party went into the mall to shop a bit, came back and its now 8:30. Still not seated. At this point 2 of our guest left and hostess where telling us the party in the section for us had just put in there order. Note that my friend put in her reservation at 6:30. I don't understand WHY we did not get seated till 10! 4 hours of waiting. It did not take this party ahead of us 4 hours to eat. On top of that all we paid our check in full and the waitress somehow add and additional $56.98 to our tab when the check CLEARLY had the TAX and TIP printed clear on the check. The manager paid for 2 appetizers and the birthday girls cheesecake. 2 appetizers! For a 26 guest party. I'm very upset about the extra fee our party had to throw in last minute and it didn't seem like the waitresses waiting us were very happy at our large party. Its unacceptable that it took 4 hours for us to be seated and looks 2 of our guest in the process. I will not be attending San Jose/Santa Clara Cheese Cake Factory any time soon and will tell all my loved ones to do that same. Not good for big partys... AT ALL!"
Richard A.,"Los Gatos, United States",3,126,,3.0,14/8/2007,"Good food, aggressive service - a bit expensive for lunch but worth an occasional indulgence. Had the Miso Salmon for lunch today.  The salmon was nicely flavored with a mix of teriyaki and miso flavors and four small sugar pea pods.  Among the other entrees that looked interesting were the lettuce wrap and Chicken Madeira.  The server indicated that the Chicken Madeira is among their more popular dishes and that the Miso Salmon was their most popular seafood entree. Service was a bit odd as the servers remove your glass from the table and come back with it later. In the few, occasional instance where I've had room for dessert in the past, I found the cheesecake very good - but served in a portion size a bit too large.  Last time I had a slice of their cheesecake I split it with two other people."
Annie A.,"San Jose, United States",124,114,12,5.0,6/7/2008,"I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE!  it's so cool, when you walk in, you feel like your in this really fancy restaurant, and it is fancy! the cheesecakes, omg, they are to DIE FOR. i havent tried a lot of them but my friends always order them and whatever they get they always turn out really really good. the food is great! everything on the menu i would recommend. my favorite has been the salmon miso (being a pescotarian), it was SO GOOD! i loved it! i didnt really like this tuna wasabi dish i tried, it was too raw for me but my boyfriend really liked it. the gratuity is always A LOT. i hate coming here with big parties cus theres always a problem at the end. I usually come here with my boyfriends' family or with a group of friends, the food is great, you gotta try it!"
Quanghuy L.,"Los Angeles, United States",37,75,14,3.0,14/9/2008,"My girlfriend took me here on Friday night, where I was surprised by friends.  My friends had planned a surprise birthday dinner for me and I was definitely surprised for like 30 minutes.  I ordered the skirt steak this time around.  I was disappointed by the dryness and rubber-like texture of the steak.  However, the potatoes were great as always.  The service continues to be a hit or miss; due to the large amount of people presently there, the waiter/waitress were not as attentive.  Overall this was an okay dinner, made great by the company."
Phil W.,"South San Francisco, United States",357,67,32,4.0,29/3/2007,"People complain about this one and the one in the city, yet its always packed and both get a ton of reviews so obviously a lot of people still go. I like this one much better than Union Square. The line is much shorter and the service is way better. Considering how packed both get, I don't see why they just don't open a few more. Probably the whole less is more attitude, like In and Out. I like the food. Yes they have a lot to choose from, but I'm a really good chooser. Everyone always ask me to choose and I haven't let them down yet. I totally adore their appetizers. My favorites are the spicy ahi tempura rolls, tex-mex rolls, and firecracker salmon rolls. I guess I have a thing for rolls. I've tried the sliders, fried mac & cheese, and calamari. Those are more or less ok, great for sharing. I'd definitely stay away from the popcorn shrimp, all batter no shrimp. The chicken strips can sometimes be a little cold in the center, I guess they haven't figured out the microwave cook times yet. The potstickers I'm sure came from right out of bag someone picked up at Ranch 99 before coming into work. Otherwise, let's move on to entrees. Their menu is like ""everything you wanted to ever eat and more."" You can really sit here for 20 minutes pondering over the menu, especially if you're hungry, everything sounds good. Seriously, you can really get anything here, chicken done 96 ways, beef done another 49 ways, and way more pastas than you can imagine. I've been here at least 20 times and I'm not even half way through their menu, believe me when I say I eat off everyone's plate at my table.  A couple of high and low lights: Kobe burger- American Kobe is no where near Japanese Kobe, not worth the premium in price. I would say something along the lines of top instead of fatty sirloin. Shepards Pie- I can make this with a can of Chunky beef and vegetable soup and some instant potatoes. Soggy and bland. Grilled portabello on a bun- bread and mushrooms, go figure.  Beef Goulash- Must be what was eaten in a gulag for all those people to die of malnutrition. Tasteless, beef was way over-cooked and not tender at all, sauce a bit runny. Shrimp Scampi- pretty tasty, a little on the oily side, but well flavored with plenty of garlic and parsley, quite buttery, great with practically anything. Cajun Jambalaya- very good, spicy and rich, almost authentic taste, loaded with chicken and shrimp, great over rice. Cajun-style Ribeye- it says marinated for 36 hours, tastes great, very even taste throughout the meat, have it rare you won't regret it. One of the best cajun steaks I've had outside of Vegas.  Overall I'm usually quite satisfied with the meals I've had here. Compared to Union Square, it's at least half the wait time. On weekday early evenings, I can usually get a table within 10 minutes. Oh I almost forgot, the cheesecake. They have about 30 different kinds of cheesecake here, the consistency is excellent, I like mine usually a little thick and firm with the crust slightly moist. I find most of their specialty cheesecakes to be a tad too sweet for my Asian taste buds so I still with the original. Do not, under any circumstances, get the 6 carb diet cheesecake. It really tastes like bad cardboard, as opposed to good cardboard you find in the freezer section of your local supermarket. If you're counting carbs, you shouldn't even be in this restaurant."
