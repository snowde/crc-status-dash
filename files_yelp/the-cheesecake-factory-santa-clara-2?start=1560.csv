Brian T.,"Los Altos, United States",202,6,,4.0,18/10/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is where all the teenagers go for birthday parties or dinners before proms. I really enjoy the food, but the restaurant is very expensive and the lines are long. The lines for the baked goods are not so bad though and it's always great to grab a cheesecake on the way home."
Kylee A.,"Mountain View, United States",12,68,1,3.0,27/7/2008,"I like comming here for dinner with family and friends. I came here today for my daddy's birthday. The server wasn't very good with his english and at the end it sounded like he said ""have a good flight"". The food is good & the prices are worth it cus you get really big portions. :) The cheesecake is yummy too, but idk I guess I'm not just a big fan of cheesecake so I don't order it unless I'm going to share with someone."
Katherine N.,"Milpitas, United States",53,88,,3.0,31/8/2008,"The 3 stars is for the restaurant as a whole. Yes, the wait is awful, but it's not the worse. The service is pretty good. The food is mediocre. But the cheesecake IS TO DIE FOR. 5 stars, hands down. But you dont need me to tell you that, because cmon now, it's The Cheesecake Factory. It's a nice place for a nice dinner. It's kinda loud, but not over the top loud. I'll definitely come back for their cheesecake, in a heartbeat."
Katrina V.,"Oakland, United States",195,366,79,4.0,9/1/2007,"aww, i don't know why this place has gotten so many bad reviews!  i always get good or at least decent service when i eat here. the food is good, the menu is huge and can accomodate all sorts of tastes.  everything i've tried here has been at least ""good"".  the portions are way way too big though. a lot of people seem to complain that this place isnt worth the wait. i wouldnt know since i havent dared pop in at a peak eating time"
Mani S.,"San Jose, United States",0,15,,5.0,3/3/2011,We like the quality and consistency of this place. Portion sizes are also huge.
Genevieve L.,"San Jose, United States",19,42,6,5.0,18/11/2008,By far the best Pan Seared Albacore I've ever had! Yelp worthy! Nuff said!
Jessica T.,"San Jose, United States",163,816,304,3.0,17/6/2007,always crowded and always will be hella expensive...damn you cheesecake factory. Their classic burger was HUGE plus a side of a buttload of fries for $8-9. Their mashed potatoes are HELLA good :D bathroms are really clean which is a plus because when it comes to restaurants bathrooms are something I expect it to be: C L E A N should've ate at home instead or in n out :P
Joe Q.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,12,,1.0,28/7/2009,"We only went here because we had a $50 gift certificate.  The prices are really high.  Most entrees are $20, and that is without vegetables on the side.  I ordered a steak ""medium rare"" and it came completely rare, just barely grilled on the edges; yuck!  My wife's food was not hot when delivered; some of the things on her plate were rapidly becoming cold by the time it got to our table.  Earlier in the week, we ate at the Italian restaurant in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel at Union Square, and honestly speaking, we got more and better food there for a lower price than we did at this Cheesecake Factory.  Finally, we ordered slices of cheesecake to go, and each slice was a huge calorie bomb - about 1000 calories each.  We wanted two different slices, but we did not want that much cheesecake.  I have no idea why this restaurant was crowded.  It is really below par."
Pablo V.,"San Jose, United States",4,47,18,4.0,8/12/2005,"To get a table was pretty slow, but the service once seated was good.  I forgot what I ordered but it was DELICOUS!  I just know it was there ""most popular"" dish or best dish or something.  I just remember it was chicken."
Nicole W.,"San Jose, United States",62,385,445,3.0,23/6/2008,"Don't go for the food, go for the cheesecake! If a restaurant has a 20+ page menu, watch out. My favorite cheesecake is the KAHLUA COCOA COFFEE."
Jay S.,"Bay Area, United States",107,247,10,2.0,25/3/2008,"The wait here is always ridiculous and the prices are outrageous! They have great cheesecake but their food is just okay. Last time I was there, the service was decent but other times I've been their, the service has been terrible. Go to CPK (on the other side of the mall) for better food and less of a wait."
Christiana B.,"Los Altos, United States",0,5,,1.0,27/1/2013,"My family usually loves going to The Cheesecake Factory, however, we went last Saturday night (our mistake) and the experience was awful! The entrance area was so packed that I had to push through people to get to the hostess' desk. Trying not to be rude, I didn't interrupt what the employees were doing, but they clearly saw that I was waiting. Before they had finished what they were doing, two people stepped in front of me and put their name in, despite the fact that I had been waiting. Instead of acknowledging me, the hostess went right back to what she had been doing. The wait was going to be an hour (I overheard the hostess tell this to one of the rude people), so my family just left. Not a single person at the desk helped at all. The lack of customer service was beyond frustrating. I don't recommend going at peak hours, unless you're someone who doesn't care about common courtesy. Otherwise, be prepared to be ignored."
Sandy B.,"London, United Kingdom",77,557,40,2.0,5/6/2010,"Almost every time I walk past here, there's a ton of people crammed inside waiting for a table with those electronic buzzers in hand. I stopped by during a slow afternoon after some shopping. The bread they serve is always the same -- white, sourdoughish stuff and some brown stuff. Kind of stale and reheated. I hadn't been here in ages and I'd forgotten how HUGE the portions are. I had a lunch size salad and it was pretty much the regular dinner portion at a normal restaurant. I'd imagine the regular sized salads could be split amongst like three people. I had the Pasta Da Vinci cos I would never make it at home as they don't typically sell madeira pasta sauce in jars at the grocery store, and I quite liked it. The chicken was a bit dry though. This place has such a huge menu with EVERYTHING on it (""Mexican"", ""Thai"", ""English"", American...) and a full bar, but I don't really like cheesecake, their meat is usually dry, and they just don't do anything exceptionally well. The only thing remarkable is just how huge the portions are. I wouldn't bother going out of my way for this."
Fraulein C.,"Santa Clara, United States",1187,656,126,2.0,4/8/2007,"I hate it when I come here, because the wait is WAY TOO LONG!! I do enjoy the food....well, some of the meals are appetizing. I prefer to order the Caesar salad and any type of cheesecake you like on the menu. Sadly, this place only gets two stars."
Rheanna P.,"Santa Clara, United States",6,16,,3.0,18/5/2008,"If it weren't for the last time I went to The Cheesecake Factory, I'd give this place 4 or 5 stars, but unfortunately The Cheesecake Factory ruined my 2year anniversary dinner. The appitizers were delicious like always, shortly after I ordered my all time favorite Lemon Herb CHICKEN with the amazing mashed potatoes and candied carrots.. 40minutes went by and our server came back with Lemon Herb SALMON. Maybe I wouldn't have minded if it was accompanied by the previously mentioned mashed potatoe candy carrot goodness, but of course not. Chillin with the Lemon Herb SALMON was ASPARAGUS and some mayonase sauce thing. GROSS."
Cynthia C.,"San Francisco, United States",313,623,1613,4.0,2/7/2006,"Even though this place is a franchise, the food is pretty consistent no matter where I go to Cheesecake Factory. The servings are huge and delicious but make sure you save some room in your tummy for the best part of the night... DESSERT!! They have the best cheesecakes! (Hence the name Cheesecake Factory! DUH! hehe!) My favorite things here are the miso salmon and the vanilla bean cheesecake!! Yums!! If you can try to avoid going here on a weekend because the wait is just horrible! Or you can be a piggy like me and just order the cheesecake while you're waiting to get seated! LOL!"
Jovi C.,"Newark, United States",64,213,26,3.0,29/1/2007,"As chain eateries go, this place isn't bad. Their regular food is mediocre, but let's all be honest here. We come for the cheesecake. It's totally decadent, and you absolutely will need a triple bypass after eating one, but that's okay.  Their Dulce de Leche cheesecake is probably my favorite. It's caramel gooey goodness and perfect for sharing or taking home 1/2 of it for those midnight sweet cravings. However, be prepared to wait a very... very... very... long time to get in here. Anytime I've ever gone that isn't 10:30 in the morning, it's packed. Wait is about 1 hour or longer."
Kenny W.,"San Francisco, United States",88,99,12,4.0,1/8/2007,"i cant fully comprehend people's animosity towards this place. perhaps its because i've always gon here at odd hours or because i dont mind spending $7 on a slice of cheesecake since i'm ballin out of control. we got seated rather quickly for 2 at 9pm on a wednesday nite. it was pretty packed but our server came by quick as did our food. i've tried a lot of different things and it's all been decent to good. since i'm too lazy to compile a list here, just ask your server next time for recommendations. in the end, you can't go wrong with the cheesecake with fresh strawberries."
Shalee S.,"San Jose, United States",36,243,11,3.0,30/8/2007,"I am so over this place.  I used to love to come here and would try to come as often as my husband could stand it but I don't know what changed.  Me, maybe as I approach thirty my taste buds are changing and I no longer think that chicken thighs are acceptable to someone who is about to turn thirty  .  Or, maybe the love that used to flow through the food is no longer.  I think that is what it is.  I have tried many dishes and they just don't taste the same the last year.  If I go with a group I still get the factory burrito and it's passable.  The three stars are for the drinks and the cheesecake, still the best around."
The P.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,1,1.0,20/7/2010,"i like the cheesecake factory...but not this one...its garbage....first we get a waitress named Sunshine...and I thought were in good hands.....bbbbhhhaaahahahaha....she doesnt even offer us bread...takes 1/2 hr for some stinking bbq sauce...then when she brings me the two sauces , its got shrimp pieces in both of them....both of them tho?...ok Sunshine...more like thundrstorm...it sounds minor but you have to be there to experience the whole thing...dont eat at this one...the one at the Oakridge mall is better"
