batu b.,"San Jose, United States",0,32,,1.0,16/7/2008,"My wife and I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight.  We had a $50 gift card, so it was an excellent chance to immerse ourselves in a culture that we weren't really familiar with. Simply put, the Cheesecake Factory is Not Good.  It's all sugar and fat and salt and pepper.  The Steak Diane basically tasted the same as the Shrimp Scampi.  It's amazing - one was dark red color, the other pale color, one from land, one from sea, but they all sort of blended together into one sweet, salty flavor.  I think there is a corporate directive to never use the term ""bitter"" lest that sensation enter into the food and provide a modicum of balance.  The Gin rickey tasted like something from 7-11.  Ditto on the pineapple pisco sour.  Props for having pisco at the bar, drops for it being reduced to a condiment for a fruit punch. Speaking of condiment, it may be that the quality reference for everything is ketchup. For example, our Ahi Tuna Carpaccio was some thin slices of ahi tuna, drenched in some sort of Thousand Island dressing (without the relish bits), served on a square plate to help enhance the Asian influence. I'm guessing the fish was too dark a red, so they had to lighten up the color towards the ketchup ""normal,"" adding this sweet, mayonaissey substance to correct it. Also speaking of condiment, one of the burgers (we did not order this) offers steak AND bacon as a topping.   Not just meat-on-meat, but meat-on-meat-on-meat.   The interior is like some mid-range vegas strip encounter.  Smooth Jazz piped in from the high ceiling.  Full page glossy advertisements populated many pages throughout the expansive menu. Besides the letter ""e"", the most common characters were ""®"" and ""™"", indicating the proprietary names of their menu items or the trademarks of the brands incorporated into an offering (such as ""Snickers™ Delight Cheesecake""). More than a dining experience, the CCF offers a parody of America, with it's diverse clientele, profit-at-every-opportunity (ads in the menu??), and ethnic-influenced menu that takes a variety of flavors and makes them all the same.  I left feeling like a visitor in my own country, however, I can say I didn't leave hungry."
Melissa W.,"Belmont, United States",31,281,,3.0,4/6/2006,"I would only go here if I wanted lunch at 11:30, any other time of the day it isn't worth the wait. The menu is huge so there's likely something for everyone but most of the things I've tried that I'd like to recommend (avocado rolls for example) are not exactly things I can afford to eat every day... and why would I want to calorie splurge on mall food?"
Christine V.,"San Jose, United States",38,84,10,4.0,30/6/2007,"I'm usually always satisfied with the food at this place. Compared to the other Cheesecake Factory in Oakridge, I think this one is better. I've never had anything to complain about except for the huge huge crowds and long periods of wait on weekend evenings. The portions are always more than I can consume and I always ending up getting a box to go."
Sherry R.,"Redwood City, United States",242,101,3,4.0,10/11/2007,"Aside from the long wait, I think the food is pretty good.  I usually go there with friends because everyone can always find something they like on the menu.  The wait staff is very pleasant and there is tons of food!"
Laura W.,"San Mateo, United States",312,180,2,3.0,21/11/2007,"Oh, Cheesecake factory. How your prices make me so sad.... This place is pretty good, but for the quality of the food (excluding the cheesecake), I think we pay way too much. It's tough to rate because I'm not sure what the Cheesecake factory is supposed to be... It's ""formal"" in design, but the food reminds me of Hometown Buffet (fried mac n cheese, spaghetti, bad lemonade). The only thing that saves this place is the fact that they have amazing desserts. Pumpkin, Macadamia, Cookie Dough and regular cheesecake flavors are my favs. And, cheesecake is the place my old cheer friends and I go when we meet up while college is out (Motions All Star National Champions!!!), so it's kinda sentimental. If you can find a different place to go, go there... oh, and the service is HORRIBLE. I've gone prob like 12+ times, and not once have I had better than mediocre service. I've had drinks spilled (by the same waitress!) TWICE in my food and then NOT bring me a new one (pasta davinci was swimming in a pool of lemon water), not even comp me a desert or anything. She offered to drain it in the back... ), they won't split a check, it takes 20 mins to get a glass of wine, forever to get seated, and even longer to get bread... you get the picture..."
greg w.,"Sunnyvale, United States",3,70,,4.0,17/7/2010,"Four of us went out to dinner tonight at around 10:30pm (they are open until 12:30a.m on Fridays). The crowds had gone and we had a great time. Our waiter, Jerod, was wonderful and was very attentive. He said we could ask for him if we came back. Two of us had the Kobe beef hamburger and it was fantastic. One of the best hamburgers I have ever had. My wife had the factory chopped salad which was pretty good but I would not have it as a main course for dinner(maybe split it). They have two types of Sangria, red and white. I like them both. Try the white one if you like sangria. We also had the strawberry shortbread with ice cream for dessert which was very good. The service was a solid 5 stars, thanks to Jerod. We have also tried the cheesecake Factory in palo alto, and it was excellent. This is one of the few chain restaurant that I like. The manager, Rhonda, seems to set a high standard for food and service. If you have a problem, talk to her. This would be a great place to take a date or significant other for a late night out."
Jason C. J.,"San Francisco, United States",1500,983,612,3.0,26/5/2007,"Service was decent as was the atmosphere. I had the Kobe burger which was pretty good since it came with sauteed mushrooms, roasted onions and a mound of fries. the only thing I didn't like was the loooooooong wait for food and to be seated."
Kathy T.,"San Jose, United States",273,16,,4.0,4/10/2007,"Food here is consistently good. The menu is very large and the servers are attentive. My favorites dishes are the chicken piccata, and the herb crusted salmon. YUM! They lose one star because they are so busy and the wait can be long during lunch and dinnertime. If you go between 2-5 pm there isn't a wait at all."
Sami A.,"San Francisco, United States",53,80,,2.0,20/11/2008,"So, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants...especially if I walk out and my clothes smell like the place--unless you're a hole-in-the-wall (which I LOVE...though, not the smelly clothing part), this should not happen to patrons at chains.  In any case, I've been here once too many times, and I could go to Trader Joe's, pick up some pasta, and it would taste better than their food. I don't like their food. Although they have this appetizer, some type of avacado fried something...it's good. Anyways, as someone else mentioned, service is hit or miss. Some people love their cheesecakes...I think it's too much. First off, it doesn't taste like real cheesecake...it just tastes like I need to wake up at the ass crack of dawn and do 3 hours of cardio to burn off too many calories...and if I'm going to be doing that, the dessert better be good.  Though, I will say, this place is good for groups, but not good for satisfying the taste-buds."
N N.,"Plano, United States",3,204,74,4.0,29/1/2010,"Always a great place to eat.  Good food, service, and atmostphere.  We came here for dinner last night with a couple friends and they loved it too.  We didn't wait long for a table, luckily we got there when there was no line at all.  We had 2 servers (1 before our food while other was on break) who were both nice.  Caitlin was pleasant as well as the other (forgot his name-had on a cool 'dollar bills' tie).  Caitlin did a great job upselling desserts...even though we were way too full to have any.  She was very upbeat, funny, and said she could feel our positive & pleasant energy!  :)  The food portions were more than great.  Two of us finished and two of us had the rest boxed.  We didn't have to wait long for the food either.  Good job to the restaurant and our servers!"
Jessica Y.,"Kissimmee, United States",99,33,,4.0,24/1/2008,"If you go early, as I did, there's absolutely no wait.  I was seated immediately.  I happen to order the same thing every single time I go to the cheesecake factory.... so I of course ordered the lunch portioned Luau Salad w/o chicken.  I love how it tastes the same at every single cheesecake factory that I've been to (San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco).  And for cheesecake I didn't go out on a limb or anything here..   i just ordered the strawberry cheesecake (the 2nd one listed on the menu).  I'm never all that impressed with their cheesecakes.. maybe someone can recommend on here can one to me!  For the price range.. definitely 4 stars.  This place has way better food and atmosphere than say, Chili's or TGIF."
Carolyn P.,"Portland, United States",62,318,4,3.0,5/8/2007,"Six of us went for an early lunc so we got seated right away and had great service. Everyone like their food as well. My only gripe is that if you subsitute something as I didn't want fries they charge you the ala carte price for the other item you choose. Ex, I had the crabcake sandwich and decided that I'd have asparagus instead of fries. That added an extra $3.00 to that meal making my sandwich $15.00 that is ridiculously high for a sandwich and some veggies!!!!!"
Kimberly B.,"San Jose, United States",1,8,,2.0,16/7/2008,"It's an American chain.  Go with this in mind and you will enjoy it well enough.  It's higher end food than Applebees or Chilis, but only because their menu has 20 pages and they actually serve fish other than fried cod.   The entire chain caters to the American palate of tons of salt, tons of dressing, tons of cheese, and last but not least, METRIC TONS of food.   Their cheesecakes come in almost every flavor you can think of, but they over-do the sweetness in each one.  I LOVE super sweet things and they still go overboard.  Viva la American palate?  This is not a chain aimed at subtle."
Jessica L.,"San Mateo, United States",0,5,,3.0,13/6/2010,"Food is all right, but overpriced, in my opinion. For the price, I would expect something a little more impressive and original. The portions are also huge! The waiting time was approximately 20 minutes. Unfortunately, the food was not really worth the wait."
Sheri A.,"Santa Clara, United States",1,34,,4.0,4/9/2007,"I remember when there was only 1 cheesecake factory in all of the bay area at the top of the Macy's building in San Fran! Now they have 2 in the south bay! Ok I love this place. Sad to admit but so many options I could go here all the time! I LOVE the miso salmon, the salads and of course the cheesecake (though I try to avoid this as much as possible...) The portions are HUGE. There is always a wait so get there early and prepare to wait... but it is worth it. The food is always predictable and they bring it out fairly fast!"
Lee D.,"Westlake Village, United States",16,141,18,4.0,14/7/2009,"If you're a food snob then you typically sneer at food chains like the Cheescake Factory, but gosh darn it I can't help myself...I like it!  While in-town at the shopping mall next door to it with my wife this is usually the default place to eat for us.  Their menu is VAST, so if you're feeling pretty fickle about what you want on that occasion they usually have something that peaks your interest, and it's usually pretty good.  Lately my wife and I have become a fan of sharing their appetizers like the burger sliders or their main dishes like the baja chicken tacos since most everything at the Cheesecake Factory portion wise are very large plus it saves us room to split one of their cheesecakes for desert.  The Godiva Chocolate is our hands down favorite.  Fun drinks too.  I tried some gin mojito-esque concoction the last time I was there and it was pretty tasty.  I'd be wiling to try others.  Always leave here pretty satisfied and happy.  Thumbs up."
samantha f.,"San Jose, United States",1,42,2,4.0,13/11/2008,"cheesecake factory you are the BEST!! the service was the best refills on time food came out in good timing as well , our server made sure we had everything! so that god for cheesecake!!!"
Kip C.,"Sacramento, United States",1,4,,1.0,29/12/2009,"Now i have eaten at other cheesecake Factory outlets before this one and overall they produce a good  pricey meal.  At Valley Fair  during the end of the lunch run on a Saturday around 1;30 we were told that there was no wait for a party of two and to wait at the hostess station.  The next ten minutes allowed us to watch as 5 other couples were called up from the waiting sofas and be seated as we shifted our weight from foot to foot. Got to our booth , got the specials spiel, ordered our drinks asked for a few minutes to decide and....waited.  Ten minuted later we were able to order our spicy beef and Shepperd's pie and again...... waited.  Another ten minutes and another waiter arrived to ask if we wanted bread and water, brought just the bread and retook our order this time with additional soup and salad. These arrived promptly and the soup was great.  25 minutes later the remainder of our meal arrived.  Upon my asking why the delay, was told the computer system had lost our order.  Well, having done a stint as a waiter in a previous life, it looked and tasted like our deep fried crispy spicy beef has sat around for way too long under the heat lamps.  Like old shriveled french fries that you reheat in the micro just 'cause you're hungry.  The Shepard's Pie as the previous reviewer noted was just plain flavorless with raw julienned carrots that needed to be bite sized added as an afterthought.  The inaccurate bill arrived, I paid with the appropriate tip added and left the brightly lit overly staffed restaurant  feeling quite disappointed."
blue c.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,30,,5.0,24/6/2007,"The best place for desert, the best place for large portions, the best place to be in a crowd."
Ugur T.,"Campbell, United States",3,30,3,3.0,8/7/2007,"I have been here so many times. Food usually good. But the service is different evert time. I go there always late. I get out of work late so the only place left open that is a restaurant is here. I go there like 2 times a week. Last time when me and my girlfriend went there our server was crap. He brought us our drinks and placed them at the end of the table and didn't even look at our faces, passed us went to somewhere else. When we first sat he was calling me BRO!. Yeah that is a way to behave in a restaurant. (Maybe in dennys) I enjoy the food but service sucks. Maybe a few times i got good service but most of the time they are slow and not paying any attention. I will go back there for their food and being open late."
