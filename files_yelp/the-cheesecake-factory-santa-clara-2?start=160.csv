Jennifer C.,"Pacific Grove, CA",41,33,,1.0,8/27/2017,"1 hour wait for water at our table.  We waited another hour for our food, it never came so we left!  Bummer.  Bathrooms were destroyed as well.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, but this location needs help."
Mallory P.,"San Jose, CA",117,7,16,4.0,2/8/2017,I only came here for dessert. Strawberry Shortcake is one of my faves! I came in with a group of 5 and we decided to sit at the bar table. Service was kind of slow but our waitress was sweet and professional! Dessert was delish!
Noel A.,"Willow Glen, San Jose, CA",95,20,1,3.0,9/24/2017,"Good location. I feel like the food is rushed, have had times where my pasta has came undercooked or completely wrong, everything I don't want sometimes is on it, that is why I say I feel like they rush in the kitchen. Other than that when they get the food right and the pasta isn't undercooked it just tastes great!! I recommend the Chicken Alfredo with side of steak Diane"
Ki H.,"San Jose, CA",896,55,597,2.0,6/17/2017,"I used to like this place a lot because it's the closest one to my house and also very near Santa Row too.  Other than that, whenever I came there, I could expect almost same tastes and same service because they are nation wide chain restaurants.  Their food is grrreat, they are all tasty and high quality, various style and some food is unique as well.  So I can expect grrreat food with the same quality all the time, this would be the great reason, that I don't hesitate at all to go to this place even when I am at another city.  But there was not okay thing happened this place.  When I was having a family lunch at this location, server almost throw bread baskets in front of us.  I do not know what happened to her before coming to work but I just thought in my mind why do you do this to us because we are Asian people (I really hope it's not !!) ??  I did not tell her anything though just because I did not want to ruin our time but felt so bad about her attitude.  I want expect for them to spend more money to train servers and to keep same service quality as well, not just to make them look same or just a similar outlook such as uniform.  I am still coming to Cheesecake factory but different location. Thanks !!!"
Melissa N.,"San Jose, CA",16,123,275,4.0,7/15/2016,"Pros: Got seated right away (arrived before dinner rush, so that explains it), Dominique was our waitress, she was pleasant and friendly. We got drinks and she even recommended a few drinks we should try. I liked that, because Im always up for trying new things. The oreo dream extreme cheesecake was pretty good. Not too chocolatey. :) The only thing I didnt appreciate was because the restaurant was getting busy, I noticed Dominique wasnt coming around as often, and we had to ask for refills. By the time we got our food, it wasnt hot. It was a little warm, to say the least... my mashed potatoes were cold and a little stiff, i got the salmon and steak factory combo, the salmon was good, moist, and my steak because it wasnt brought out right away, it was chewy and wasnt that great. In other news, the calamari came out piping hot. So Im glad i got to enjoy that."
Brittany R.,"San Jose, CA",410,321,11,4.0,8/1/2016,"Parking: This is located at the mall so parking is relatively easy. There's a big open lot in front and also a garage next to it.  Venue: It's pretty standard when it comes to all the other Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to - big enough to get a different table each time :) I always love the interior design of the restaurant. It's always so bright! Food: Their menu is really similar to BJ's- if you like anything from that menu, you will find its equivalent here. Plus there's around 16 pages of menu items. If you can't find something you like, you're being ridiculous. They have sooo much- my favorites are: -Parmesan Crusted Chicken -Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms -Lemon Garlic Shrimp -Steak Diane -Thai Glazed Salmon -Almost ALL the appetizers -ALL the cheesecakes of course Service: It always depends on your server and how busy it is but mostly, I've always had friendly, quick servers."
Krystal S.,"Mountain View, CA",98,58,4,5.0,3/31/2017,"I've had a craving for cheesecake factory and we don't get to dine here very often, so when hubby and I had to go pick up our car from the dealership down the street I knew this is where I wanted to go for lunch. We walked in and immediately sat in the bar area. We ordered buffalo blasts as our app, hubby ordered the fried catfish (which was pretty bomb) and I got my usual miso salmon which never dissapoints. We got our entrees before our appetizer, which confused us at first but it was no biggie.  Immediately the manager Julian (hope I spelled your name right) came to our table, apologized for the mixup and even comped the the appetizer! We started the meal with great service from our waitress, and then it ended with EXCELLENT customer service from Julian. Keep it up cheesecake factory!"
BE S.,"Fremont, CA",29,23,7,1.0,8/27/2017,"We were there last wk for date night, on a Wednesday night. No wait to get a table or to get drinks, however, it took 55min for our food (two pasta bowls) to come out. We were about to leave. When it finally came out, mine was fine but my boyfriend's was cold and his chicken was worse. We called the waiter, he apologie2 and he got the manager for us. However, she came to us with attitude, as if we were in the wrong for complaining about it. She told us -well, what do you want me to do, get you a new one or heat this one up? Really? How about an apology. I told her to box it up we were leaving.  When my bf told her we were not paying for either meal since we had to wait so long and now can't even eat there, she said no. So we walked out. We have been going to this restaurant for so long, but sadly we will not be back."
Janine N.,"San Jose, CA",573,142,263,4.0,10/28/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! How can anyone not love the Cheesecake Factory? It is such a cute place with nice decors for a nice outing with family and friend, or even a date night! Either way, I always manage to have a great time at the Cheesecake Factory!  I love that they have a huge menu with over two hundred items to choose from. Even so, I always go with their Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. It is my absolute favorite dish of all time! Some of my other favorite dishes when I can get past my craving for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta are: Pasta da Vinci, Louisiana Pasta, Chicken Madeira, Chicken Piccata, Miso Salmon, etc. These are certain items on the menu that you have to try! Not to mention, they have very generous portions, especially for dinner.  Also, they have a great selection of Cheesecakes and they are displayed very nicely at the Bakery. I love their Original and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. This says a lot because I'm not even a Cheesecake person, yet I'll only eat Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory!  Anyways, my last experience there was on a Friday night last week. My friend and I sat at the bar and was helped by two very sweet bartenders: Jimmy and Justin. They were both very nice, attentive, accommodating and patient with us. Anyways, I only ordered some sliders this time since I mainly came here for drinks. But I need to mention that their sliders were only decent. However, their drinks are good, especially the Strawberry Daiquiri! It is delicious; and remember, you have to ask them to put whip cream on if you like whip cream with your Strawberry Daiquiri. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Excellent food and service. The only thing is that the food can be heavy and a bit greasy, but that is just why it's so delicious. I will definitely be coming back since there are  hundred of other items that I have not yet tried."
Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",64,16,,4.0,4/12/2017,"Gilbert (the bartender) is the star! Damn, i was impressed by his awesome customer service.  Came here for cheesecakes on a Thursday. He patiently explained the menu, differences between the cheesecakes, promoted new items. He was friendly and funny.  I hope the management will recognize great employee like Gilbert."
Andy T.,"San Jose, CA",350,2,,1.0,5/5/2017,"Went here for my first time with friends  and ordered a steak Diane with shrimp for 22.95. The server was super friendly, however the food was disappointing. For this price, I got 3 small pieces of steak, 3 pieces of shrimp, and a slab of mashed potatoes. The plate was hot and the food was cold, meaning it was microwaved.  My other two friends ordered a chicken alfredo and Cajun jambalaya. The alfredo was drenched in sauce. It was way too creamy to the point where it wasn't satisfying to eat. The Cajun jambalaya was really bland and dry. There was no flavor to it. We all left disappointed and unsatisfied and would not come back."
Marco C.,"San Jose, CA",3,169,,3.0,9/14/2017,"Just ok, I was more curious because it is mentioned in the Big Bang theory TV series, the restaurant looks completely different than from the show. The quality of food is just ok, they have a great tasting bread."
Alice C.,"Tracy, CA",4,82,4,5.0,7/10/2017,"Stopped here for lunch while shopping at the mall.  We love The Cheesecake Factory franchise and usually don't have a problem.  We had Miranda as our waitress and we decided to order our favorite pasta dish without the chicken.  The waitress asked if we were vegetarian and when we said we were, she informed us the sauce was beef based.  Very disappointed as it was our favorite sauce however, we were unaware it was beef based and appreciated the information.  She suggested a few other items that could be made vegetarian which we appreciated.  Food and service were very good.  Our only complaint was having to ask for a refill on our drinks and the second batch of bread that was brought out was burned."
Jennifer D.,"Felton, CA",1,5,,2.0,5/15/2017,"If you would have asked me before last night to rate this restaurant, I would have given it 4-5 stars. My family and I usually come here about once a month with a fairly large group, around 7-9 people, and have never really had any issues until now.  We came here last night for Mothers day dinner. It was busy when we arrived, but not overly so. Wait time was about an hour, which was fine because we knew there would be a wait on a holiday and we were able to kill time in the mall before heading to dinner. The problems started after we ordered our food. We were visited by two different managers at our table before our food even showed up to apologize for the wait, which we thought was odd since we didn't feel the wait was excessive at that point. It just seemed average for a weekend dinner here. When the food arrived at our table, one of the entrees was wrong. We promptly notified the person who brought the food out to the table (who wasn't our server) and they said they would fix it right away. Fair enough. Our server then came to the table, apologized for the mix up and said the correct entree would be out in about 5-7 minutes.  We waited another couple of minutes and the ""new"" entree comes out to the table. The supposed ""new"" entree ended up being the exact same plate of food they had sent out earlier, which was wrong. We told them again that it was wrong, they apologized again, and again they said they would correct it. At this point, one person at our table still did not have their food, Our waitress seemed to have disappeared and the correct entree still had not been brought out yet. We waited about 15 minutes and tried to flag someone down to figure out what was going on. You would think that it would have been easy to flag down a manager since two of them had already been to our table, but they were nowhere to be found at that point. Neither was our waitress. We ended up flagging down a server from another table and asked to speak with a manager. At this point a third manager comes out. I believe his name was Justin. We explain what was going on. At this point, those of us who got our food were pretty much done eating and the corrected entree never came out. He apologized and offered us a couple free deserts. We reluctantly agreed. Several minutes later and no server had taken our dessert order. We finally found out from the manager that he had switched our server without telling us, since he thought that we had an issue with the first one. It wasn't really her that was the issue, it was the kitchen staff, but ok. If you are going to give us another server, why wouldn't you tell us so we know who is going to be taking our order? At this point we were fed up and one of us was still hungry since he never received his correct food. They offered to box it up for us to go, but we were just so frustrated at this point that we wanted nothing more to do with this restaurant. We decided to skip dessert, which I had been looking forward to all day. It surprises me that on such a busy day with so many ""managers"" floating around the restaurant that our service was so terrible. It pretty much ruined our Mother's Day dinner and left me not wanting to come back. Which is sad, since we've had good service here before. Oh well."
Tracy N.,"San Jose, CA",112,71,75,5.0,6/9/2016,"From the last time I came here, which was in 2014, I thought I'd give it one more try. This place has really improved. I came here with a party 5 over the weekend. The lines were extremely long for a table but a waiter helped us out. I forgot his name! He provided great customer service and excellent communication skills. So $20 hand tip for you!  I ordered a entree of pasta di vinci. Our orders came out hot and ready! Barely got to wait that long. I'm seriously in love with their pastas! Definitely so much better than pasta pormodoro. I'm glad the service and the food wasn't horrible like the last time I came here."
Nikita B.,"Fremont, CA",140,225,49,2.0,10/2/2015,"Had the worst customer service from multiple people today ...  It was three of us in the beginning and we had more people coming in later so we decided to go chill at the bar and the bar tender was super rude for no reason.. When our other friends came she carded everyone which is protocol and one of my friends IDs were expired and again I get that it's protocol to not serve someone with an expired ID but she was super rude about it   Anyways moving forward our waiter (Steve) was super rude as well! We asked for bread about three times and he kept saying its in the oven how ever other tables were getting bread ... And he even rolled his eyes at one of my friends like if you're having a bad day please do not take it out on us..  My other friend went back to the bar to get a beer and the same bar tender gave him a lot of attitude to the point where she verbatim said ""I'm speaking English "" what do you think my friend was speaking in? And way to be racist ...  So we decided to inform the manager bout our server and the bar tender she came back to our table trying to give reason why they did what they did and not even genuinely apologizing for anything .. (Grace) I mean she apologized but it was the most unapologetic apology I've ever heard..  Anyways so we got a new server whose name I wasn't able to get but she was amazing ! Hence the two stars or else I would have gave just one.  In the end the manager did try to get on our good side by giving the birthday girl a free cheesecake  Great food but horrible service I doubt I'll ever return to this cheesecake again."
Allison N.,"San Jose, CA",75,15,3,1.0,12/9/2016,"Been sitting in my car since 7:55pm waiting on a to go order, was told 30-40mins.. boyfriend has been in the lobby since 8:40.. it'd now 9:03 and still no food. Update: received our food at 9:07.. no apologies and no bread that we asked for. Update:... at home with my food now, no tomatoes means I don't want any tomatoes in my dish. And there was a chicken strip in my zucchini fries."
Tina V.,,206,67,75,4.0,12/30/2016,Always a good go-to when in you're in the mood.  A bit pricey and you can always count on looking forward choosing a decadent slice of cheesecake if you are not too full from your meal!
V J.,"Manteca, CA",0,20,2,1.0,11/11/2017,"This the worst Cfactory! As if the parking wasn't bad enough due to massive construction, we waited 1 hour for our food and it came separate as prepared because chefs forgot side dishes. SERIOUSLY for the cost to dine here be warned you definitely pay the price both ways!"
Wenya L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",29,13,35,4.0,12/13/2016,"I liked that they served some bread before serving the mains. Food and service are great. I felt the ambience was ok but too dimmed to my liking. Everything is generally good, just extremely long waiting time. About 25-40mins waiting time."

My other friend went back to the bar to get a beer and the same bar tender gave him a lot of attitude to the point where she verbatim said ""I'm speaking English "" what do you think my friend was speaking in? And way to be racist ...  So we decided to inform the manager bout our server and the bar tender she came back to our table trying to give reason why they did what they did and not even genuinely apologizing for anything .. (Grace) I mean she apologized but it was the most unapologetic apology I've ever heard..  Anyways so we got a new server whose name I wasn't able to get but she was amazing ! Hence the two stars or else I would have gave just one.  In the end the manager did try to get on our good side by giving the birthday girl a free cheesecake  Great food but horrible service I doubt I'll ever return to this cheesecake again."

Update: received our food at 9:07.. no apologies and no bread that we asked for. Update:... at home with my food now, no tomatoes means I don't want any tomatoes in my dish. And there was a chicken strip in my zucchini fries."
Tina V.,United States,206,67,75,4.0,30/12/2016,Always a good go-to when in you're in the mood.  A bit pricey and you can always count on looking forward choosing a decadent slice of cheesecake if you are not too full from your meal!
V J.,"Manteca, United States",0,20,2,1.0,11/11/2017,"This the worst Cfactory! As if the parking wasn't bad enough due to massive construction, we waited 1 hour for our food and it came separate as prepared because chefs forgot side dishes. SERIOUSLY for the cost to dine here be warned you definitely pay the price both ways!"
Wenya L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",29,13,35,4.0,13/12/2016,"I liked that they served some bread before serving the mains. Food and service are great. I felt the ambience was ok but too dimmed to my liking. Everything is generally good, just extremely long waiting time. About 25-40mins waiting time."
