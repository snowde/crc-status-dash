Will C.,"Berkeley, United States",4,64,,4.0,22/9/2007,"This place is the WORST enabler for overeating.  I'm always afraid to order something because I'm afraid that there will be more than enough food on my plate to feed 3-4 people.  The portions are massive.  And I feel like that's an understatement.  They conveniently omitted the words ""portion control"" out of their handbook.  I was with someone who ordered a ""small"" salad and calling the thing small is like saying the president has only made a few tiny mistakes.  For those of you that didn't get that, it's a gross understatement. However, large portions and all, the food is usually delicious and this one is always full.  I had to wait 15 minutes to eat lunch at like 2 in the afternoon.  On a weekday. I'm not really complaining but I've never had to wait to eat lunch in a mall on a weekday.  What sucks though is that by the time I'm done eating I don't even have the room for one of the trillion varieties of cheesecake they offer.  And dessert is my favorite meal ever! (Minus 1 star for this because I do not like this happening and I am going to be a bitch right now.)  The menu is gigantic and not for the indecisive, ever.  Under any circumstances."
Stace V.,"San Jose, United States",22,11,,3.0,6/1/2008,"It good food, not great.  A huge menu.  I like the cheese cake though.  Service is kinda slow."
Shaun C.,"San Jose, United States",1180,231,9,3.0,10/12/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory is the most overrated restaurant chain in existence.  I can remember back in the day when visiting one of the original (this is not a fact, I am guessin..) Cheesecake Factory's in Thousand Oaks, in the mall and they had the best cheesecake on earth and the food was great...blah blah blah.  Now, things are definitely different and contrived.  The service is hit or miss.  It's a hit when I know the people who are serving me and complete bullshit when I don't know them. I think the service at the Cheesecake Factory is deemed ""fake"" or ""robotic"" because the management forces the employees to say the exact same thing over and over and over and over again (I sound like a bad morcheeba charango song now)..  They sound like mindless drones who know that they are about to rape us with expensive crap.  The way they justify charging so much for bad food is the portion size.  I wish someone would tell them that QUALITY over QUANTITY is what the consumer needs and wants .  Eh, who cares though, its easy and mall food generally sucks. Perhaps their motto should be ""Mediocrity is KEY!"""
Joe W.,"Sunnyvale, United States",14,43,3,3.0,28/8/2009,"I really don't get why this place is so popular.  The food isn't especially good, and the quality doesn't reflect on the price you pay.  The only thing that tastes good enough to leave an impression is the cheesecakes.  However, it also does leave the impression of $8~$9 a slice!!!  If $ were no issue, come here.  Otherwise, you can do much better elsewhere."
Yelper Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,98,1,2.0,16/1/2010,"I came here on Wednesday, December 23rd around 7:30pm.  There was a brunette female hostess  going to seat us.  We waited 25 minutes to be seated, and didn't get seated.  My guy friend asked for a booth instead of table.  He wanted a booth because he wanted to talk about something confidential to me.  He said people at the tables will hear us more, compared to a booth.  Then the hostess both of us a dirty rude look with her evil eyes.  She said ""you can't have that booth, and you need to wait another 15 minutes for a booth"".    That is fine, but why give me the rude look, I didn't ask for the booth, he asked for it.   So dumb of her.   The food is good though.  Terrible service."
Lew L.,"Mountain View, United States",0,14,,2.0,4/8/2007,Dropped by on a Friday night at 10:30 to pick up a couple of slices of cheesecake to take home.  I noted that people were waiting for tables -- probably 15 minutes in my estimation.  No one was waiting for their order at the take out counter.  Tab was $14.61 for two slices -- smallish slices at that.  Cheesecake servings are shrinking at this location.  Are they shrinking at other locations?
Christopher d.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,4,,1.0,23/9/2007,"There is no reason to ever go to this restaurant. The only thing even marginally noteworthy about this place was the service, which was good. I went with a couple of friends a week ago, and none of us was impressed with this place. Two of us ordered pasta, one a hamburger and another some breaded chicken strips. The portions are very large (far more than one needs to eat), but the quality is not great. Both pasta dishes, despite being incredibly rich and creamy, were not very flavourful.  The hamburger, again, was massive, but there was absolutely nothing memorable about it. Similarly, the chicken strips, while great in quantity were somewhat sub-standard in quality. Basically, for a $20+ meal, I'd prefer something of substantially better quality. One star awarded based on value for money. Poor value for money."
Jen C.,"San Jose, United States",31,234,94,3.0,6/5/2009,"I would actually give 3.5 stars based on tonight's visit. The location looked busy as always but our wait was minimal (more or less two minutes). The server was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. He seemed to be very busy too so I appreciate the way he took time to introduce specials and dessert items to us. The Cajun Rib Eye Steak was flavorful but nothing too special about it. It was definitely overcooked as it was supposed to be medium rare. It came out more like medium or medium well. It was nevertheless still tender and delicious. The Thai Chicken Wrap was alright. All the ingredients were fresh and well prepared, but the chicken pieces were not like real ""chicken satay"" to me. I know it's not the best thing to do to expect good quality asian flares at american restaurants but oh well, I gave it a try since everyone seems to rave about it so much. I regretted taking the suggestion of my server to change my ordinary iced tea to an innovative passion fruit iced tea. It tasted artificial to me and I'd rather stick to something less adventurous. Overall, I see why this place is well loved but the menu items could be hit and miss at times."
Minh V.,"San Jose, United States",55,131,4,3.0,12/8/2008,"Of all the chain restaurants I frequently go to for dinner, this is in my top 3 for sure.  They have some refreshing drinks for you to enjoy at the bar, whilst you're waiting for your number to be called for your table.  One of the biggest downsides to this place is the sometimes ridiculously long wait time for your table - because it's soo freakin' popular, and they do not take reservations.  So, if you have a large group (4 people), I strongly recommend you get there early, or be prepared to wait a very long time.  Parties of over 10, I wish you the best of luck.  I recommend getting the steak Diane, whereas as other people seem to really enjoy their burgers (personally I don't want to wait over 1hr for a freakin' burger, I'd rather just go to In N' Out Burger for that)  The cheesecake and other desserts they offer are also of course mouth-watering and delicious, and I'd recommend trying them all at some point.  We usually end up spending about $25/person, but it's a nice atmosphere and some very good food - well worth waiting for."
Jeff H.,"San Francisco, United States",78,297,9,1.0,22/6/2008,"I'll tell you why it sucks and why I will never patronize this particular location again.  We went there for dinner and they lied to us about how long it would take to get a table.   The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes. So we waited.  After 25 minutes had gone by, I asked if we could get a table and the gal told us to wait another 10 minutes.  Another 15 minutes had gone by, notice I'm quite patient, and no table.  This time, I demanded a table and the gal came up with some lie about the beepers weren't working and she quickly called a waitor and finally got us a table.  When we got to the table, it wasn't ready and had  left-over dishes and food still  there.  Ok, now we have to wait another 5 minutes for the bus boy to clean it up.  And so, we just gave up and left.  We wasted a good 1 hour and 15 minutes at this stupid restaurant!   If you do decide to go to this place and the hostess says it's a 15 minute wait, don't believe her, she's lying.  I don't know if it's a company policy to build up a huge queu at the waiting area, but I think it's quite unethical to create a false sense of demand to be seated!"
K W.,"Irvine, United States",2298,740,1089,2.0,19/2/2007,"i've only come here for cheesecake, and it was overpriced and mediocre. way too much whipped cream. props to the large yummy-sounding varieties to choose from...but sorry, i don't enjoy paying $8 for a slice of okay tasting cheesecake when i can get a few boxes of delicious sara lee's (mmm cherry cheesecake) at safeway instead."
Jessica W.,"San Jose, United States",7,39,,4.0,28/1/2009,im giving this place a u know what......upgrade!!!!! i had the montecristo two sundays ago and omg hecksa good like really! there thai lettuce wrapes=bombdotcom im giggin this place instead of three stars i give it an extra one 4!
arielle h.,"Gilbert, United States",38,30,10,4.0,26/2/2009,"If you are lucky enough to have Steve as your server, the wait will be more than worth it! He's been ours twice in a row now and remembered our large groups names and drinks 3 weeks after the first time he served us"
Valerie C.,"Milpitas, United States",0,7,,4.0,29/9/2009,"I love this place! Me and my boyfriend never hesitate to go on a date here.  This dim lighting is intimate and the waiters are very friendly. The only thing is that the tables might be a little too close together and i often hear the conversations of the next table, which means they can hear mine too! Other than that  the service great and so is the food.  My favorite is the Pasta Carbonara, but i rated this restaurant 4 stars because they are inconsistent with how well they cook their food.  Sometimes this dish will be amazing, and other times it's missing some ingredient, but its so good that i disregard those incidents and keep coming back!"
j w.,"Santa Clara, United States",2,41,,3.0,5/8/2009,"Who's idea was it to post the calorie content of the Cheesecake Factory menu?  I knew my favorite dish was very fattening (avocado eggrolls), but I didn't want to know just how fattening it really was.  My mom likes to go here when we're shopping, but only if there's no wait for a table.  I've tried the mixed drinks at a couple different locations now and they're always gross, I can't even drink them."
Rachel G.,"San Jose, United States",22,78,,3.0,25/1/2009,"I've only been here twice.  Once for my birthday a few years ago and more recently for a co-worker's birthday.  For my birthday celebration, I remember ordering some kind of meat dish, but it tasted awful.  I didn't even eat half of it.  And yes, I was drunk from all the shots my friends were gifting me, but it still tasted awful. Isn't food suppose to taste better drunk? Well, not in this case.  I didn't even get a piece of cheesecake!  Fast forward to 2008 and I get an invite to lunch for one of my co-worker's birthday.  I order the cobb salad.  So good!  The lunch portion was a huge serving even though it was a half serving of the original size.  I also ordered a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake, which was very delicious! Had to take the rest to go, since it was so rich.  Ate the other half during my work break.  Overall, the factory is not really a place I'd go out of my way to eat at.  It's just okay."
Tran H.,"San Jose, United States",312,86,8,2.0,11/12/2005,i give props to their desserts... but cheesecake factory actually any of them... their food aint that great and the price is terrible for the taste of their food.  i dont recommend this place.. it's over priced and so not worth it. (sorry)  BUT their dessert is good and huge thats a plus.
Kris L.,"San Francisco, United States",198,805,261,2.0,3/9/2006,"I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years.  The LOOOONG waits just put me off.  Long waits for food and service that is just so-so.  We ate here yesterday because we happened to be shopping at Valley Fair.  We rolled in about 5:30pm and there were people out the door.  Here we thought we'd go to dinner early and not have to wait.  Wrong!  For our table of 7, they said the wait would be 25-40 minutes.  It was a little over 40, but that's not too bad since once I had to wait well over 2 hours for a table at the SF one.  The portions are humongous so I always try to split with someone.  I'm never going to eat that much by myself.  I had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which wasn't bad.  My nephew kept grabbing a fork and stealing the pasta off my plate.  The service was fine, although when they brought us back to the table, the table wasn't even cleared off yet, so we had to stand in everyone's way until it was cleaned up.  Then when they set up the table, no one got plates.  We had to ask our waitress for plates after she gave us our appetizer (the avocado rolls).  Also, my sister's glass of water had lipstick marks on it!  Eew.  Are they even washing the glasses here?  The floor under the table was filthy too.  There was food all over there.  Not very clean at all.  We were all so full afterward that all 7 of us split one slice of lemon raspberry cheesecake - which was actually pretty good."
Bryann R.,"Spokane, United States",167,26,1,1.0,3/1/2007,"Yes, that's right.  One lowly star...and they're lucky to get that after the service and crappy drinks that my boyfriend and I got at this CF last night. First of all, it took FOREVER to get seated.  I saw hella people that came in after us get seated way before us, and when I asked the hostess if maybe our pager was not working (they were starting to yell for parties to be seated), she rudely said, ""No!  Your pager is FINE!  You've only been waiting for 12 minutes!""...and then she turned around and proceeded to chat with a fellow hostess.  She's lucky I didn't get her name or else it'd be in this review.  All in all, we waited for about 35 minutes to be seated. The guy who actually sat us was very nice.  Didn't get his name though either. After we were seated, it took FOREVER for our server...Tim...to come by and introduce himself and take our drink orders.  When he did, we ordered two of their famous mojitos and waited for about 25 minutes for them.  Yes, 25 minutes FOR DRINKS!  When he did bring them, he just dropped them off and took off to go flirt with a table of 3 girls that were sitting behind us.  What was really bad was that there were 2 male servers AND the male manager at this table...all flirting with these fat, ugly chicks while they were neglecting their duties elsewhere.  After about 15 minutes of that crap, our server saw that we had put our menus down and finally came over to take our appetizer order.  Good thing THAT didn't take forever.  Maybe 'cuz it was the tuna carpaccio?  By this time, I still hadn't taken a drink of my mojito that I waited forever for.  My boyfriend had a sip of his and nearly gagged.  He asked me to try mine and see if it was ok.  Just then, a server was delivering food to the table next to us and she saw the look on my face and stopped to ask if everything was ok.  Our mojitos were PURE SYRUP!  No limes, no alcohol, just SYRUP!  Tim, our server, came by and took the drinks back and I got a Georgia Peach and my boyfriend got a Corona instead.  I HATE having to send drinks or food back because I always feel rude for doing so, but after we sent those mojitos back, our server didn't come by hardly at all after that.  It was almost as if he was avoiding us!  Finally, we ordered our food and then waited 45 MINUTES for it!  Our food was wonderful, but the service was terrible.  As I mentioned before, our server was avoiding us, and when my boyfriend finally flagged him down to order another Corona, he took his sweet time flirting with all the waitresses along the way.  We had to ask another server who was passing by to get the 2nd beer. After we were done eating, I had to flag our server down to get a to-go box.  He offered to box up my food for me, but I told him I'd rather do it myself and save the time (and spit)!  He asked if we would like any dessert and I asked him, ""Well, how long is THAT going to take?""  He said, ""Why, do you have to be somewhere at a certain time?  Do you have a movie to catch?""  I sharply said no and that I would just like the check.  He was completely oblivious to his crimes!  He had NO IDEA that he was LAGGING like that! I'm sure he got the hint with a $2.14 tip on a $60 tab.  Yes, I feel horrible for tipping so little, but the guy didn't even earn that $2.14.  I wanted to stiff him completely, but my boyfriend talked me out of it.  I understand that the lagging may not have been ENTIRELY Tim's fault, but still.  Don't flirt with chicks, don't piss off the bartender so your drinks are slow to come, don't piss off the kitchen so your food is slow to come, and don't avoid your customers when you're the one that delivered a horrible product.  Better yet, Tim, just quit the restaurant job.  Obviously you're only in it for the chicks.  The fat, ugly chicks. I will NEVER go back to this CF EVER again.  From now on, my money can go to the Oakridge CF...where I've always had service and food/drinks that was above and beyond. And Tim, I hope you read this.  Maybe you'll understand now why you got a crappy tip."
rm t.,"San Jose, United States",0,8,,2.0,15/8/2009,"This used to be a reliable place to head for lunch or dinner.  The last couple of times the food was sub-par and good service was spotty at best.  I have been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory since they opened - even though they were traditionally mobbed at dinnertime and the prices were fairly high.  Unfortunately, I'm on the hunt for another local restaurant with great food and service."
