Brent B.,"Los Gatos, United States",0,4,,4.0,7/7/2009,"Excellent tasty food with geneours portions. Sevice slow at times. Overall, recommend it highly."
Julia W.,"San Jose, United States",67,208,14,3.0,18/3/2006,"This place would have 4 stars if they were not so, oh forgive me, cheesy!  The food is passable but the portions are staggering... Clearly this restaurant caters to tourists and tired shoppers.  While the ceiling height and Mediterranean decor give the illusion of an expansive restaurant the actual seating space is limited and a bit cramped.  Once seated the atmosphere seems less elegant but more cafeteria like with the exception of waiters.  The waiters are generally super but on the frazzled side.  And don't go here for a quick bite to eat as the host will tell you it will only be 20 minutes, then 5 more, then five more, then only two tables ahead of you...Back to the gargantuan portions, good if you're a fan of leftovers & a nightmare if you are still tortured by memories of having to finish everything on your plate before having dessert.  The cheesecakes are why everyone goes there but who has room for a quarter section of a cheesecake or a mountain of cake?  Just get one of something with lots of extra forks. Seriously, for about the price of a slice here you can get an awsome frozen cheesecake from trader joes."
Rochelle F.,"San Jose, United States",47,163,9,1.0,8/3/2007,"This place is horrendous. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory restaurants before, but this one really sucks!! The wait is always out the door and the lines are crazy long. I think that because they are so busy, the service is horrible. The wait time is ridiculous along with the food. I ordered a simple salad that was completely different than the description on the menu and it tasted like SHIT!! excuse my language, but the first bite is important.. and my first bite of the salad tasted rotten and disgusting!! I spit it out and sent it back to the kitchen because trust me, it did not taste right at all!! The manager came over and appolgized and I didn't dare order anything else. That night we waited for over an hour for some crappy food and horrible service. Try another Cheesecake Factory, but not this one!! After that experience, I don't plan on eating at the Cheesecake Factory (any of them) ever again!!"
cristina b.,"Sunnyvale, United States",2,6,,5.0,9/4/2008,heellla yea its da best  me and my boyfriend spended like 60 but i think  its worth it . really good food and cake..yum im gana go again.. da 1 in santa teresa is da best place...
Daron M.,"Cupertino, United States",4,77,,2.0,28/3/2009,"For the price, this place sucks. The cheesecake is delicious, but I believe they are serving smaller slices. I remember a HUGE cheesecake, not it's tiny, and still the same price. Damn recession. I was not pleased. The burger was good but still, only as good as a Jack in the box burger which is 5 dollars less. The cheesesticks are about enough to put in your mouth in a handfull. Literally. They give you 5 cheesestick patty things, that are about as small as two pennies, and charge me 5 bucks?!!? The waiter barely spoke english and kept bothering us. This is why restaraunts dont get a lot of my money. Service and quality. Both are lost in chains. Look at the ratings for ""mom and pop"" restaraunts. Much better.Not worth the wait or the money., But of course, its all about brand name so you yuppies will still go here. I really don't feel sorry for any of you who lost your 600,00 dollar homes. Especially when you could have gotten the same home in Oregon or Washington for half! Sorry, ranting."
S S.,"Milpitas, United States",2,5,,1.0,7/2/2007,Very disappointing experience! We went last night to celebrate a birthday. Obviously we had long long wait and too much crowd. But there is something else which made me mad. Although our friend did not want the birthday cheer from staff we went ahead and told the receptionist that we were there to celebrate his birthday because we thought it would be fun for 2 kids in our group. Even after reminding servers two times no body did anything. Not that we were dying for their stupid cheer but it was frustrating to see them ignore us. Servers were not et all attentive and total show off. It left a bad taste in our mouth.
Hana S.,"San Francisco, United States",23,91,,1.0,22/10/2007,"As usual the food here is fairly decent, I was here with the bf for the bar menu. He got the spicy tempura ahi roll-- he took a bite and chewed X50 times; then we realized the chefs left the rolling wax paper in the maki! How incompetent! Only that dish was credited, service was mediocre- probably never coming back to this cheesecake."
Ali C.,"Mountain View, United States",479,596,80,4.0,8/5/2007,"i like the cheesecake factory.. the bar, the food, the cheesecake!!  sure, the portions are huge but that just means you have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!  some of my favorites are the well-mannered dirty martini, avocado eggrolls, jambalaya pasta, pasta da vinci and the chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake.. they are all so good!!  the prices are a bit high but the quality is great and you get a ton of food!!  it's always crowded so get here early or come with people you don't mind waiting around with."
MK D.,"Burlingame, United States",59,1986,1591,4.0,9/9/2007,ooooh tres leche cheesecake..oh how i love you! this is the only place i would go to devour you and that's just a treat all in itself with their house coffee.
Padma K.,"Cupertino, United States",22,32,,3.0,13/9/2005,I know its lame to write for this restaurant since probably everyone has been here but I usually hate going here because the menu is the size of a novel and is impossible to find anything good in it aside from the assorted cheesecakes of course. But if you are stuck going here for lunch or dinner cause your frienda can't think of anything better or well you are in Valley Fair mall(the best mall ever)  I finally found an amazing dish there. SANTA FE SALAD. Best item on the menu.
Kevin C.,"Milpitas, United States",7,30,,4.0,18/4/2008,"Went there for lunch and lives up to all the other Cheesecake Factory experiences.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere.Just be prepared to wait.  Prices are a bit more than I'd like to pay on some of the dishes, but I always leave satisfied."
Nicolle W.,"San Jose, United States",12,109,,3.0,24/8/2007,"the food is going downhill.  what happened to the sesame crusted salmon??? that was their best dish by far.  the only thing that saves this place is the avocado eggrolls and the strawberry shortcake.  everything else sucks.  and it is WAY too crowded.  i just CANNOT believe how many people want to eat here!  go get some good food, people."
Charmayne O.,"Fremont, United States",108,110,,4.0,20/1/2008,"Be ready for their notebook of a menu, it's huge! But also be ready for that 1-2 hour wait during dinner hours. This is one of my favorite places to eat when you don't mind waiting to be seated. You get most-of-the-time fresh bread when you're seated, sourdough and thier rye/wheat kind that people rave about along with butter. Some of the things I suggest: the appetizer fried mac-n-cheese ( 3 large balls of mac-n-cheese breaded and fried served with someone kind of marinara cream sauce), the chicken and biscuits (served with a hearty serving of mashed potatoes), grilled cheese sandwich (if you're feeling simple, served with large portion of fries), cajun chicken littles(huge portion, gotta eat with a sauce, some may think it's a bit bland), chicken madeira, and I also hear the burgers are great. Thier salads are like mountains, it could easily serve 3 side salads. Thier breakfast of eggs, thick bacon, and hashbrowns is awesome- not greasy like diners. If you're going to order dessert I highly suggest one thing, and it aint' even cheesecake. It's the fresh strawberry shortcake. Holy crap my mouth is salivating. The shortcake, somehow, it's almost crispy, the ice cream is delicious and the strawberry syrup and strawberries are just right. It's huge, and if you've got a sweet tooth you could eat it just as your meal-that's how filling it is. You're going to have leftovers, I promise you. Thank God I have lunch plans to go here with a friend until Wednesday or else I would be dragging that chain with me to San Jose as I speak. One star down just because of the long wait and occasional so-so service."
Bucky M.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,500,2,3.0,22/8/2006,"Cheescake factory is all right, not worth the hype and 2-3 hour wait though."
Maria T.,"Stockton, United States",6,18,7,3.0,1/10/2007,I love the food but the wait is just tooo long... I'm willing to wait because I think the price is decent and the meal is great. Love the variety!! :P
David D.,"San Jose, United States",0,39,,4.0,30/11/2007,The food is awesome and so is the service.  It's pricier than most restaurants but the place has large sized portions with plenty of options to satisfy people with all kinds of tastes.  The dessert is the best - fudge brownie cheesecakes.  I would also recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which has a mild spice to it  but is something I've been eating for quite some time now.  The only ding I have on them is that it is so ridiculously packed that you can wait to almost an hour to get a table during dinner time.  They are so busy that people have to wait that long but then again it means they're doing good enough for people to keep coming there!
Saleem C.,"Santa Clara, United States",7,187,,5.0,10/7/2007,"The best cheesecake you ever had! Pricey, but delicious large amounts of cheesecake are sold here. A great place to have a party."
Kamui K.,"Santa Clara, United States",8,72,,3.0,6/1/2008,"Cool for the dating scene, but afterwards, gets a little boring.  Too oily and sometimes the wait is a little overbearing.  Overall, decent with some good varieties."
suzanne d.,"San Jose, United States",0,3,,4.0,11/3/2008,"Love the desserts, but the drinks don't have any liquer in it. The service is friendly but need cuter waiters."
taryn b.,"San Jose, United States",0,3,2,1.0,30/7/2007,"I still can't believe how bad this dinner was - and I've let 2 days pass before writing this review.  It was my birthday dinner - and I arrived early to put our name down for a party of 8.  I knew it wasn't going to be quick to get seated - but I had no idea how the rest of the night would go. They called our name/buzzer, and we went to get sat - only to find out that they had sat a party of 4 in this area.  10 minutes later, they tried to sit us at a booth that only seats 5!!!!  20 minutes after that, they finally seated us.  They did provide us with free appetizers, but my brother-in-law did ask if we were going to get something comped for our troubles.  They took our drink order right away- and we told them we were ready to order.  The waitress said she would come back and take it in a minute.  No big deal - except she didn't come back to take our order or to bring our drinks for at least 20 minutes - well after we had finished our appetizers.  The food took forever to arrive, meanwhile we had a waitress swap out - while ours went on break, and we had to ask the manager to check on our food.  The food arrived and some of my family felt like it was cold.  By the end of the night - we had been there for over 3 hours, 2 hours at the table, and my husband had already had to leave early to put our daughter to bed!  We ask for the check, provide a card - and she disappears for what seems like another 20 minutes!  They still charged us the 20% gratuity for large parties.  Total lack of class.  Learn from our mistake - and try another Cheesecake factory."
