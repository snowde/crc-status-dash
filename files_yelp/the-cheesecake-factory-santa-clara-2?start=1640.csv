cathy C.,"Cupertino, United States",0,4,,2.0,17/10/2010,"i came here because i received a gift card for my birthday. from the outside, the restaurant looks large but there is always a very long wait on weekends. the menu is large. i am hoping that restaurants add whole grain breads, pastas, etc to their menu since this is the healthier choice according to FDA. oh well. i ordered brunch food and the waiter asked type of bread i wanted. later, waiter said that my meal does not come with bread. so? it probably cost the restaurant more money to have the waiter spend time walking to my table to tell me that, than give me 1 piece of toast. most people that i have spoken with agree that it takes a long time for their meal to be prepared and served. everyone in my group said their meal was so-so, not great, not too bad, not memorable. i ordered apple cider with my meal. warning - no refills. apple juice is one of the cheapest juices in the US. i could buy 2 gallons for the price of the small glass they gave me at the grocery store across the street... the waiter kept asking if i wanted water, and i said no. i just don't think i could recommend this restaurant to anyone, and don't feel like going back. i would also recommend that kids order from the regular menu."
