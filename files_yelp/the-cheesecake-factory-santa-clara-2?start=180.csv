Rose F.,"Santa Clara, CA",92,4,1,1.0,8/13/2017,"The server is new to the restaurant, and he forgot to send out order to the kitchen. I was waiting for my food for 50 minutes. The manager came to me and say sorry. The only thing they did is to give me a coupon card for cheesecakes. There is no discount for the bill. I remember I went to yard house once, and they make me wait for 30 minutes for the food, the manager came to us say sorry and let us have the food for free. Not gonna go to this restaurant again."
Raj L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/4/2016,"It's a franchise so the basic food quality is about the same. The service at this Valley Fair mall location, however, is rather poor. Let's just say that customers should never see garbage being handled as they are ordering food, that sloppy counters are a huge turnoff, and that it should not take 4 people to pick up, hand off, and ring up a single frozen cheesecake order to go. Yes, we know none of you lackeys want to be here. But it's the customers that are the reason you even have a job. So please pull up your pants, stop listening to gangster rap music, and just get me my food in a timely and sanitary manner."
Karina C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Absolutely disgusting! Most people like super sweet cheesecake but not me. My brother enjoyed a lime cheesecake and I got a caramel one which was super sweet and gave me food poisoning! Overall the cheesecake taste worse than others and even costs more . Ha! never going back, Overpriced and too sweet or too salty ew!"
Mub E.,"Fremont, CA",0,13,,1.0,11/11/2017,Service is terrible. I ordered the Bang Bang shrimp which is something I always order and it's NEVER had apples in it until now. They brought me my food with big apple chunks. Even the menu has NO mention of apples in the entree. It tasted gross and I couldn't even eat it. When I told the waiter he just shrugged his shoulders and said that's how it's always been too bad. Last time eating here!
Michelle G.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,10,2.0,8/21/2017,"If this review consisted of just the food it would be a 5-star review but unfortunately the service we received complete ruined our time. I came to have a very relaxing time here with a coworker of mine. We were seated relatively quickly since we got there before the dinner rush.  Once we were seated the waitress came to our table and took our drinks order. We also requested bread at that time. It took like 20 minutes to get bread. We actually got our appetizers before we got the bread. After a while we got our order in. We got our food and started to eat. Here is where things start going south. The waitress came to our table, I kid you not, about 10 times asking if we were ready for boxes. She actually reached to take my coworker plate and silverware before she was even done eating. We were also ordering a to go order but we told her that we were going to order it right before we left because we didn't want it to be cold and we were going to be there a while. We hadn't even gotten our dessert yet when she comes out with our to go order. She literally said ""I took it upon myself to place your to go order because I thought the kitchen was going to take longer"". We specifically told her we had no rush in leaving as we were trying to enjoy our cocktails and dessert after work.  After we received our to go order, it clicked for us that she was going to be off which is why she was rushing us. We remembered her telling us when she took our drink order that it was ""home stretch"" meaning she was close to being done with her shift. I understand everyone wants their tips but if you are rushing me I'm not even going to give a tip. Honestly, if you have to clock out, give your damn table to another server so my service won't suck.  I felt rushed the whole time I was there and was not even able to relax after a long/stressful work week. Might be back but definitely won't stay at a table where this server is serving."
Casey M.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,62,17,1.0,5/8/2016,"Very disappointed! Came to order take out for Mother's Day so I can skip the long wait and it was worst mistake ever. Took 40 minutes for the order. They forgot my sauce so I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the sauce. They never asked if I wanted bread to go and I've seen them ask everyone else. No utensils either. What I ordered: Miso salmon: bland and ok. I had this a few times and it did not taste good  Kale salad: it came out very warm. They put the salad on the bottom on the bag and so my salad was cooking. Gross. If I wanted a warm meal, I would have ordered something hot, but I ordered a salad and it was so warm. This was my mom's dinner. Horrible!  Eggplant Parmesan: pasta was so dry. It was all stuck to eat other. I was able to pick up the clump of pasta with a small fork. It was so hard. Banana cheesecake: it feel apart before I was able to take it home. Overall, very disappointed. I was so embarrassed to serve this to my mom on Mother's Day."
Gigi G.,"San Jose, CA",11,14,1,1.0,8/26/2017,"If I could give lower I would. Over the years we have gone here, it's trendy, by Santana Row etc. on a Monday night we figured it would be quieter, we didn't want to cook and wanted something we could pick up. What a mistake, was told I could pick up our order in 30.  1. Could not park in pickup area, guy was rude and told me to park over at Chase if I wanted. So parked at Chase, no choice. 2. Got inside, over, not kidding, over 10 Doordash people waiting on orders and I had to wait behind them. 3. I am now 50 minutes into this and not one person has gotten to me. Another 10 minutes go by and I shove my way up front. 4. Where is my order? Called it in? I got back, what? Where is my order? Gave my name. She went looking for it. Never to see her again! Another 10 minutes, ask again, husband calling, where's the food etc.  5. Food shows up, hey, we think we called your name already....I was livid, paid the bill. 6. I get to my car parked at Chase mind you, opened it up, food is missing, food is smashed and cold.  Do I dare go back in? Or do I vow never to put myself through that again for an $85 order.  Thanks, but trendy Santana Row can keep you. Negative TEN!"
Diane M.,"Los Altos, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/13/2017,"We had not been to this Cheescake Factory before at the Mayfield Mall. We were invited by family. It was very busy on a Wednesday early evening.  We had a drink at the bar until everyone showed up. We were seated right away. My husband and I ordered from the light menu. I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp with vegetables. It was very tasty. My husband had a beef entree with vegetables which he enjoyed. The children were happy with their choices of linguine alfredo, pasta with meatballs, and a hamburger with fries. The other adults had salads with their salmon and chicken entre. The service was good considering the restaurant was full."
John E.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,17,1.0,8/12/2017,"Food is OK but service is slooow. This is my second visit. As predicted, I had to wait a long time for food to arrive. Table that sat after us already had their food. Same apologies here.. but no improvement. Only reason I came here is to get parking validated for Westfield shopping mall.  I don't recommend this place. Service is poor."
Jessica W.,"Cupertino, CA",8,62,2,2.0,7/16/2017,"I've been going to this location once a month for lunch with a girlfriend, for about 2 years. Things have been fine. However, the last 3 or so times, I could feel dried crud on the outside/under side of my plate or bowl, which makes me wonder if the surface my food is on is really clean. I'm sure it went through a dishwasher so it was sanitized, but it's so gross, I can't stop thinking about it. I think we need to find a new lunch spot. So gross."
Michael B.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,30,11,1.0,6/15/2017,"We came for a late dinner last night (Wednesday the 14th) and we asked for a table. The nice young man a the front desk said it would be 20-25 minutes, said we could try the bar. The bar was full but got a table within ten minutes. We waited at the table another ten minutes before it got cleared. Jamie T. Was our server (young Asian influenced lady). She took our Oder within another five minutes. We then got buzzed five minutes after that for a table but told the hostess me would just stay as we had already ordered food. We ordered crab bites, Asian lettuce cups and the Thai lettuce wraps. Plus my fiancé ordered a black tea. Our server brought the crab bite, which were smaller than in past visits to dine here. But taste was spot on. The Asian wraps were next, larger with overall ingredients than in previous visits but the amount of chicken (main protein here) was very lacking. My fiancée Thai lettuce cups came and again of the small side with the amount of chicken compared to what we normally would get. Our server however seemed to be more inclined to talk with her friends than to pay any attention to us. I went the entire meal without being able to get a refill on my water and she never brought us my fiancée tea. Which was a big surprise when we got the bill and it was still in there. We asked that she remove the cost of the tea because we didn't receive it. She just shrugged her shoulders as if to say O Well. Did not even bother to apologize or show any kind of concern. Maybe you all need to gain your servers more or more often on common courtesy. This resulting in a super small tip  Be careful if you get her as a server."
Melissa A.,"East San Jose, San Jose, CA",1,8,3,1.0,10/23/2016,"I hate being that person but let me tell you why I'm give this place 1 star; I made my order for pick, not only was I on hold for about 15mins but my order when I got home was wrong! I paid 20$ for a simple Fettuccini Alfredo chicken. There was no chicken and it looks sad, barely any sauce and my order was giving to me super cold (as if they had it in the kitchen for a while before giving it to me) I am very disappointed and if I ever make another to go order in the future I will be that super anal person that make sure whatever I paid for is what I'm getting."
Nir L.,"Santa Clara, CA",6,1,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory branch ive been in my life.  I was waiting 50 min for my food , bad service."
Yo T.,"Marina, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/25/2017,"Worst time ever... And I usually love the factory. I brought my grand kids for lunch. Server was ok but manager came by and asked everything was ok, I told her silverware was not cleaned and bread plate had chocolate sauce on the side. Obviously it was not put through the dishwasher.  The manager came by the table was named Samantha... She was abrupt with full of excuses and had bad attitude. Lunch for four was over $130.00. I can't imagine avoiding one of my favorite restaurant coz of one moody and rude floor manager... Shame!!!!!!  Need to better train your managers or have better screening process.  I can better spend my hard earn money else where I'm better treated!  Update... After we got home after few hours my wife felt ill, she vomited and had stomach pain. I had diarrhea as my daughter who had cheesecake we brought home for her.  I strongly recommend Cheesecake Factory to check their product for temperature controlled storage and food handling and date control of  perishable food items.  Their business has dropped I'm sure do to mall construction next door. More so they need to maintain food rotation and outdated items that need to be discarded.   Thank god we have recovered following day."
Aida U.,"San Jose, CA",51,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,My party of 9 (2 kids) had to wait 2 hours for a table. Don't ever go on a Friday with a large party. The food was cold and took another 45mins to be served. Never again coming to this restaurant again. The manager was not empathetic about our wait and was careless. I can't believe i was in this awful restaurant for 4hrs total and it only took us less than one hour to eat.
sonia m.,"San Jose, CA",36,16,9,1.0,8/18/2017,Waited for two hours Manager told us that they Are waiting for the big table to be ready OMG really there is no big tables they just the table together they could it done it before don't get me wrong I like cheesecake but I doesn't like at all.
Jake M.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,17,3,5.0,8/11/2017,"Excellent food, good wait staff. Never had any bad experience here. Only minus is the long wait. Even on a weeknight it's more than 30 mins. I guess it's crowded because everything else is great there."
Joe H.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,25,1,1.0,10/29/2017,"They don't take reservations. Expect to stand around for an hour. If your entire party is not ready to sit when your table is available, then they won't hold it for you. I only go here because my mother likes it; no food is worth that kind of hassle."
Melanie J.,"San Antonio, TX",62,24,73,5.0,5/22/2016,"Jessie is the best waiter at the Cheesecake Factory. Very family oriented and will make you feel at home. I brought my 8 month old son to the Cheesecake Factory and was nervous because this was his second time sitting in a restaurant high chair. Jessie checked the buckle on the high chair without me having to say a thing and even brought us another high chair that was with a brand new buckle.  Jessie was the best Waiter I've ever had: he gave my little one the perfect temperature on soup, and some apple juice, and checked on our table the exact amount of time to make us feel welcome and at home. He made our restaurant experience 5 stars."
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,3.0,4/4/2016,"I had a gift card so I roped some co-workers into coming here. It's crazy busy there, even on a weekday for dinner. I was slightly late but my coworkers waited probably about 20 minutes for a table. We were seated in a huge booth off to the side. I had strawberry lemonade, a margherita flatbread pizza appetizer and cheesecake. It was a wondful filling meal. For the cheesecake, i had the lemon raspberry cream. So good. Dessert is a must here. And that was my whole gift card - kinda pricey. They were really nice and split our bill for the four of us. And we stayed till closing till they started cleaning up around us and we felt guilty and left. Haha. A cool place to hang out. Sucks that the wait can be pretty long though. Parking is easy peasy with it being connected to the mall and all."
