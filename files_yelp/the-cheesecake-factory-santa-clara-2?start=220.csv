Luis A.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/2/2017,I've been standing here for 7 minutes a lot of employees around and no one has even said hello welcome
Sophea T.,"Bothell, WA",0,4,,5.0,10/19/2017,"What can I say about our server, David? Three words. Tall. Lanky. Awesome. Merciless. Jackhammer. Insatiable. He was hilarious and the food was good. Thumbs up."
James T.,"San Jose, CA",3,10,1,3.0,7/7/2017,we have been going here for quite a while now and today is the second time they served us with burnt food. satisfied with service but not with the  food.
Akon W.,"Fairfield, CA",1,3,,1.0,3/25/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the service I received at this location was horrible. Upon arrival, one of the hostess' was having a heated discussion with a waiter, and audibly said ""don't touch me"" to the waiter who was attempting to calm her down. To my left, I noticed at the to go and desert counter four employees, in which one was working the register, while the other three were goofing around. My husband and I were then seated by the restroom, after passing up empty seating in the front. The straw that broke the camel's back was the kitchen mixed up my order, and it took 20 minutes and a talk with manager for the food to arrive. We will never eat here again."
Diha A.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,5,4.0,10/8/2017,"Me & my husband went last night for a date night dinner , food was delicious we ordered Salmon rolls, Hibachi steak & grilled steak Madillions. It was sat night so much crowded & they told me for a 20-30min wait we accept it but our turn came after an hour so I found lil mismanagement in this matter plus servers on reception wasn't cooperative but managers are nice. But due to good experience was very good so we forget that wait. I would suggest don't go on sat night or put the name first & roam in a mall."
Jeremy C.,"Mountain View, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Extremely long queue!!!! And they are not honest!!! They said about 45 minutes, but it turned out to be 2 hours waiting!"
Anais R.,"Fremont, CA",35,13,2,5.0,4/9/2016,"I always try to see the good things on a restaurant...for me to give a bad rating is hard!  I give a 5 star... the waitress that was attending our table was nice,patient,good appereance,etc. Nice food,big portionnsss**  Ive seen the comments before coming and most of them where bad! But why not to give an opportunity? Yet people really dont care about yelp rating because here people can come in write what ever they want(even tought they could be lies)... that is why i always give a taste by myself. So here is my rating!  Who ever wrote that you have to waith alot well  THATS IS VERY GOOD it means that is busy because it is popular duuh- who wrote that service and food is not something different than others? Well duuh restaurant is a restaurant and FYI goid taste and big portions and a very extended menu!  I loved,definetly will come back even tought i have to wait an hour. Thanks!"
Deana C.,"Pittsburg, CA",56,2,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Cheesecake Factory San Jose Horrible Horrible. Christal is also the worst manager making them look even worse. Got food delivered and it was a soggy mess. she also said it's not their fault no utensils, condiments or bread was in the bags because you have to ask for these things. She's lying. They knew we were at a hotel and needed those things with the delivery. Her answers were laughable. Pay $30 and gotta beg for a fork! Never again and I am telling everybody"
David Z.,"Chico, CA",54,41,11,3.0,4/15/2017,"Went there while visiting with family in the Santa Cruz area. The wait time was minimal, service great and food was exactly as ordered. The waiter was friendly and the noise was minimal."
Diana T.,"San Jose, CA",221,400,872,4.0,10/23/2016,"I like Cheesecake Factory because it has a huge variety of cheesecakes in all different flavors to choose from. Although, my favorite is its original strawberry cheesecake with real strawberry toppings there are so many kinds to choose from.  The restaurant also has a lot of good entrees such as the miso salmon, steaks and pastas.  The salads come in big portions too."
Amit S.,"San Jose, CA",35,118,122,5.0,2/23/2016,"Cheese cake factory is my favorite restaurant simply because of an awesome gigantic menu and brown bread. Bang bang shrimp and chicken, mandarin style chicken, white bread pizza, Cajun jambalaya pasta are some of my fav dishes here. The appetizers selection is pretty awesome. The only thing I dont like is the wait times as they don't allow reservation."
Sid M.,"San Francisco, CA",469,9,,4.0,6/12/2017,The ambiance is great and food is good. Wait times were ridiculously high since they don't take reservations. Overall a solid experience
Andy H.,"Anaheim, CA",62,296,356,5.0,10/2/2016,"I love going to cheesecake factory. All their food is always good and you could never go wrong with their cheesecake. I prefer this location over the Oakridge one, because Oakridge's service is ALWAYS  a hit or miss. I would definitely recommend this location. This is the place we chose for a quick celebration or an evening out for dinner."
Susan M.,"Foster City, CA",486,288,1376,5.0,3/3/2015,"Always a wait when you come here. Wish they took reservations but unfortunately they are so fortunate to always have a ton of business at all hours of the day.  Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. Main reason for coming here is for the avocado egg rolls! They are delectable little treats that are crispy, fresh, have great flavors/sauce. Each bite is pure bliss, yum. A lot of other restaurants try to copy cheesecake factories avocado eggrolls however no one makes it even close to cheesecake factory's! Definitely recommend the Pasta da Vinci. Tender pieces of chicken, different types of mushrooms, grilled onions with penne pasta in a creamy white sauce. It is a little heavy and greasy but I love the flavors of this pasta dish.  The miso salmon is delicious! Salmon was perfectly cooked, great miso flavoring on top of a bed of white or brown rice. This dish could use more veggies though, there was only 5-6 pieces of snow peas. Beautiful presentation though, this is a dish that tastes as great at it looks. Strawberry cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake and white raspberry cheesecakes are all delicious!  Service has always been great here. Portions are HUGE (even lunch portions). I always share entrees here to make sure I have enough room for cheesecake!!"
Vanesa R.,"San Jose, CA",41,2,,1.0,9/24/2017,"We have gone to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times, but this terrible experience has definitely made us reconsider ever going back. We got there at 6:50 We were amazed on how fast we got a table, but unfortunately that was the only positive thing to happen to us. After sitting for a while with out a waiter acknowledging us we had to ask for someone to helps us. We let it slide thinking it was busy for staff. We finally place our order, and I take a call at 7:20. The table next to was having a difficult time with their order; it was completely wrong and late. (We notice that the place was not as packed as we originally thought it was). 20-30 minutes later they settled and leave. By this point we ask about our food and for more bread (we are starving). They inform us it'll be out soon. Ok cool, we can deal with that.......15mins later, we check in again and we are informed that something is wrong in the kitchen so are food will be longer now, and they just walk way. They didn't ask if we wanted anymore bread or drinks. By this point we are not even hungry anymore the anger was filling our tummies. At some point the manager that had been helping the table next to us, walks up to us apologize for the delay. We calmly ask why it's taking so long, we have been sitting there waiting for our food for almost an hour. He tells us we have only been sitting for a few minutes and that he'll check when we placed our orders. He informed us that our order was only placed 30 minutes ago, it's 8:30pm!!! WTF happen to our order?!!! We paid for our drinks and walk out. We really don't care that we had to wait, we understand that something's take time and or that shit happens. But what we don't like is the bad customer service especially from a management member. Don't come over to apologize for a long wait and then say we weren't waiting that long."
Jackie O.,"Mountain View, CA",162,44,6,5.0,12/15/2016,"Today our company treated us to lunch. We each ordered something under $20 I opted for the salmon, mashed potatoes with asparagus instead of broccoli.   Absolutely delicious!   Props to our waiter (Will) his service was impeccable don't let the tattoos fool you he is witty, friendly, charming, and a memory like a boss!  With 15+ attending in my group he didn't write down a single order and got them all right!"
rebecca M.,"San Jose, CA",3,151,306,4.0,5/15/2017,"1st time here , came with my in laws and BF. I ordered the Salad and pizza Lunch special.  The onion soup was delicious according to my BF. It has a welcoming  atmosphere . Happy crowd.  Waitress is very nice and friendly. Happy hour  4 to 6 pm  ONLY at the bar"
Robin H.,"San Francisco, CA",714,117,427,4.0,8/13/2016,"THE CAKE: I've had many fond memories dining at the Cheesecake Factory, mainly because the service of the staff and the quality of the dishes have been consistently excellent with every visit. My only qualms for dining @TCF is the lack of parking and long lines during peak hours (holidays and weekends), so give yourself some lead time before your meal. You'll be glad you did. THE CREAM: My TOP 10 favorites dishes: 1.  MISO SALMON_$20_Light and flakey grilled salmon in a complex sweet & savory sauce over white or brown rice (I prefer brown because it doesn't sponge up the sauce and is delightfully fun to chew). Despite its lack of veggies (the 5 snap peas are nearly raw, so I order a side salad), the sauce puts this dish on a league of its own.  2.  SKINNYLICIOUS TUSCAN CHICKEN_$17_Surprising juicy and well-seasoned chicken breasts, asparagus, cherry tomatoes in a warm & tart vinaigrette sauce. Chicken + veg = low-carb dish. 3.  BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP_$19_Smooth Thai coconut curry oozes with mix of exciting textures: crispy coconut flakes, juicy chicken, peanuts and vegetables served over fluffy rice. *FOOD COMA PORTION. 4. ORANGE CHICKEN_$17_Well-battered chicken takes a dip in a thick sweet/sour/savory sauce, stir-fried and served over rice. No veg. 5.  CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA_$18_Light-breaded chicken breast served w/ delightfully tart lemon sauce. Served w/ mash potatoes & asparagus. *FOOD COMA PORTION. 6.  LEMON HERB ROASTED CHICKEN_$18_For a classic comfort dinner, this hearty, well-seasoned roasted 1/2 chicken is served w/ zingy lemon sauce. Served w/ roast carrots and mash. *DINE+TAKE HOME PORTION. 7.  CHICKEN PARMESAN SANDWICH_$14_Nice balance of flavors and textures: golden breaded chicken and sweet bell peppers between two slices of cheesy rustic bread served w/ a side of marinara sauce to take this sandwich over the top. A bit heavy on butter, so I suggest a side of baby greens to add to the sandwich. *DINE+TAKE HOME PORTION.  8.  SMOKEHOUSE BBQ BURGER_$14_Burger crave? This one's sure to please. A well-seasoned beef patty is stacked with crispy bacon, cheddar, crispy onion strings, and frilly iceberg lettuce on a sweet fluffy bun. Served with creamy BBQ ranch sauce on side. I prefer baby greens over fries for less guilty meal.  9.  SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES_$11_Sweet & soft cakes w/ dynamic texture: sweet corn, course grain of corn meal in complex combination of savory sauces + the cooling effect of guac, sour cream and fresh pico de gallo salsa. Every inch of this dish is different and good to the last bite. Best when shared as it's too small to be a meal on its own. 10.  SEARED TATAKI SALAD_$19_Simple, but tasty salad w/ seared tuna and mixed baby greens, thick-sliced tomato and avo, and balsamic vinaigrette. *FAST AND LIGHT PORTION."
Blanca H.,"Fremont, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/13/2016,"The food was pretty good, I always come for the cheesecake so that's never a disappointment... HOWEVER the service was shitty. My server was dull and kinda gave a face when we asked if we could move tables. I understand that asking to be moved sometimes can be a pain, but our plates were too big for the little ass table my BF and I got seated....In addition our server just wasn't giving much of a welcoming and overall good service. I felt like she was rushing and didn't even bother to offer us extra plates. I used to be a server myself so I get that if you're having a bad day you don't want to be serving especially giving full attention to your customers, but still. Sad thing is that one of the workers who wasn't a server was the one who was taking care of us..  All I know for sure is that I will never be coming back to this location"
Jasmine H.,"San Jose, CA",349,156,437,4.0,1/18/2016,"Came here to dine in on a few different occasions. Great place for brunch and dinner alike! My husband loves their cheesecakes, so occassionally, we pick up slices of cheesecakes even if we are not dining in. I love their strawberry cheesecake, while my husband loves all of their cheesecake combos involving chocolate.  Sometimes, you can find Cheesecake factory dining voucher at costco or online that offer a discount or free cheesecake with purchase."
