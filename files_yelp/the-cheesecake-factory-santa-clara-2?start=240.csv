Kathy M.,"San Jose, CA",228,24,67,4.0,4/28/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is the one I go to most since it's the closest to my house. I mostly come here with family but today I decided to come here with my boyfriend for their happy hour, which are weekdays from 4pm-6pm. The appetizers range from $5.50-$7 and the serving sizes are pretty big. Their draft beers are $4 and wines and well drinks are $5.50.  My boyfriend and I ended up ordering the fried zucchini, southern fried chicken sliders, and the crab wontons with two draft beers. When the food arrived, we were surprised at how big the portions were and became unsure if we could conquer it all. The fried zucchini was crispy and tasted delicious with the grated cheese sprinkled on top, dipped with ranch. The crispy crab wontons were also good and quite filling since it had cream cheese inside. The wontons came with a sweet chili sauce mix, which complemented the flavor of the wontons. Lastly, the southern fried chicken sliders were super delicious. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and soft, juicy meat on the inside. They put pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes on the side with two sauces. The sliders themselves were pretty big and came in four servings.  After finishing the last slider, we felt defeated and had to take the rest of the unfinished appetizers to go! I will definitely come back for their happy hour, but next time, order less food."
Pallavi I.,"Syracuse, NY",1,5,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Worst experience ever! The food came so late that I had no mood to eat. People who came after me, and were a larger group, got served first, and  were  finished with their food when mine arrived(took more than 45 minutes). I had ordered orange chicken and it was not very great either."
Bianca O.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,3,5.0,6/25/2017,I want to start off by saying the service was great! All thanks to our waiter / server Jonathan P. He was hands down one of the best waiters we've had. He made sure our drinks were always filled and not coming by us too much like other servers do. The food was great as well. The Louisiana Chicken pasta is so good I recommend it!
Mizy C.,"California City, CA",18,113,158,4.0,4/26/2016,"I like to come here for my daughter mommy date.. My daughter loves the cheesecake here...  Great food, fast service around 3pm.  Miranda was our server!!! Fantastic Job... give her a Raise!!!! Great customer service skills!!!!  Moscato wine is great, I always have it with my salmon meal!  We will be back!!"
Pno E.,"Oakland, CA",15,90,841,5.0,10/25/2016,"Usually it took a long time to deliver my favorite lunch specials - Louisiana Chicken or Spicy Pasta with Sausage. But, big thanks to our server - Brenda, we had pretty fast delivery of our dishes. We were able to have an delicious lunch in and out within 45 minutes. The complimentary breads and olive oil-balsamic vinegar were wonderful too."
Alex G.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,33,2,2.0,5/28/2017,"Brought my mother and wife to celebrate Mother's Day ..a week after official Mothers Day. It was a Wednesday night and was not busy. We love this place for its fresh rye bread and a variety of menu choices. Unfortunately, our experience was forgettable due to unbelievably bad service. First of all, we waited our meal for 50 minutes. We got the drinks fast but there was no water offered. After 45 minutes of waiting, our server didn't check on us even once and we asked him what was going on since many tables his area of service was not busy. We tried to ask a server for help from another area but she said she would call for our server to help us. He returned with our dishes in 10 minutes... Finally , we politely asked where our water was and he brought it in 20 seconds when we were finishing our meal. Out of respect for this restaurant chain and just by being nice ,we still left good tips but I hope the management would read this review to its staff and train servers to follow up at clients' table, offer water, and follow up if there is long wait. Will I come back here? I highly doubt it. P.s this is my officially first bad review on Yelp and I didn't expect it to be on Cheesecake Factory, well, I hope the management will address the issue."
Shantanu I.,"London, United Kingdom",0,11,1,4.0,9/25/2017,"The wait time is nearly an hour during the weekends and 30 mins during the weekdays. No reservations on weekends as well. Food and cocktails are great! Love their pastas, mushroom appetizers and their cheese cakes (Hershey's and 30th anniversary are my all time fav)"
Shaleen L.,"San Jose, CA",37,12,21,5.0,8/28/2016,OMG had the best experience ever!! We sat at the bar had the best services. It was close to closing time. Justin the bartender took the best care of us and made us feel like we were welcome and no pressure to leave. Great pizza and wine!!
Rochonne S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,1,1.0,3/10/2017,Really bad experience today.  Cobb salad bad no clam chowder. Who runs out of clam chowder on a Friday?  Waiter struggled with the bill. Very disappointed
Tim V.,"San Francisco, CA",241,65,16,3.0,4/7/2017,"Love the portions and although I never get excited for big chain restaurants, this place started to grow on me! They have a strong seating system so you never half to wait more than an hour, fast service and don't let the huge menu fool you the food is done well."
Laura T.,"Union City, CA",2,31,12,3.0,12/11/2016,"If you're planning to have dinner here, prepare to wait.  For a party of two our wait time was 45-50 mins.  When we arrived, there were people hanging out in front and in the lobby area waiting to be called and a line almost out the door just to leave their name on the waiting list.  On the upside, across the restaurant is a designated parking lot area just for the Cheesecake Factory.  It's not very large, but better to have than not. My usual is the Miso Salmon, it never disappoints, well at least it hasn't so far.  My husband's usual favorite is the Shrimp Scampi.  However, this time round he said it was a little overcooked. The staff was very friendly and they work really hard.  Yes, you have to wait sometimes to get their attention as they zip by passing your table. Rather than wait to order dessert we thought it would be faster to just go up to the take-out counter. Wrong!  There was a line for that as well. It wasn't too bad but after placing our order it's placed into the queue between desserts ordered for dine-in and take out.  It would have been faster if I went behind the counter and retrieved it myself.   The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake was worth the wait.  Can't say the same for the Banana Cream Cheesecake.  The restaurant is family friendly and it's not a quiet restaurant.  So kids can talk loud, laugh or cry and adults near the bar area can watch sports and cheer on their team. It can easily accommodate larger groups  just keep in mind the day of week and time you decide to dine here."
Jack P.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,5.0,5/31/2017,"I went here about 12:30 and I thought it was going to be busy so I was kind of skeptical of going but when I went they seated my girlfriend and me right away. The customer service here was amazing, my waiter David and he was just amazing, he made sure that I was all set, I was kind of shy of asking for refills and extra ketchup but he just walked by and saw that it was almost done. He immediately went and made sure and asked and brought it right away. My first time here but definitely not my best, also the food came pretty fast and it was better then what I expected, other people have bad experiences (according to the reviews) but maybe it's just a hit or miss. Thanks David for the experience. Today I came back and like always, didn't have to wait which was great since it was just two of us. I sat down and the waiter was very nice which is good since I've came here about 5 or 6 times and every time it's a hit, everything is spot on, I ordered a classic burger and when it came, it was spot on, cooked perfectly , while enjoying my meal, a guy walking around wearing a plaid polo shirt was going around making sure everything was right. He saw that my girlfriends and my soda was quite low so he offered to go refill it for us which was quite nice. Although I did ask for ketchup and he forgot lol , other than that everything else was perfect , the wait time for my food was about 10 min which isn't too bad. I'll be back soon for sure, always a great experience."
Andrew M.,"Fremont, CA",169,517,257,3.0,9/12/2016,"It is a chain restaurant that has decent consistency. I try different dishes each time and it goes from ehhh to yeah that was good. I wish the service was consistent, but hey its waiter life, I know everything can't be perfect. The portions are good, like if you get a lunch pasta, that's more than enough for 1 person, dinner pasta would be for 2 or more. Only go to cheesecake for other people, on my own, would never choose this."
Derek G.,"San Jose, CA",105,3,,1.0,2/19/2017,"If you're venturing out to brunch on Sunday DON'T consider The Cheesecake Factory at Westfield Valley Fair. There is no parking on Sundays unless you Valet for $4-6.  Otherwise you have to park at the parking garage by Nordstrom. It's a scam.  They even block off the Chase parking lot.  I talked to the manager and he told me they were ""affording me the option"" to park there.  Needless to say there are plenty of other choices..."
Lynn L.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,1,2.0,9/19/2017,"Our time there started out good despite it being cold inside the restaurant (which is why I have two stars) . The server was attentive and nice. Then our server went on break and we were given another server who was horrible. He did not check on us once! He literally went around our table and did not even bother to check on us. Finally I called over the Manager to get some water. Then we waited 20 minutes to order cheesecake and the server never came. Once again I called the manager over and asked for our check. I was pissed I wanted cheesecake but I was not about to wait any longer there. The server ran our payments and there was a balance of 11.33 due. I put down cash and we left. Suddenly the server chased us out stopped my friends car and told her we owed the $11.33. My friend told the server to check because we put cash down. The server told her not to drive away as he ran in to check, sure enough the money was there. I am beyond upset with the professionalism and aloofness of the server and establishment. Seriously he chased us out instead of checking the folder where the signed receipts and cash was, it was uncalled for and question our integrity, despite being extremely embarrassing. I will never go back again."
Kathryn H.,"Danville, CA",0,5,1,3.0,5/14/2017,Beautiful tiramisu and lemon raspberry cheesecakes but aggressively salty buffalo chicken strips.
Turquoise N.,"Mountain View, CA",59,15,,4.0,6/10/2017,"I went for dinner with a friend the other night for a post birthday dinner and it was really nice. Our server was incredibly patient and helpful with the cocktail and dinner menu. We had the Vietnamese spring rolls as an appetizer which was pretty good. My Chicken Marsala was great, I had the garlic mashed potatoes instead of pasta. For dessert the Dulce de Leche cheesecake was on point and I got a mini ice cream dessert for my birthday. Can't wait to come again!!!"
Andy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/24/2017,Probably the worst experience ever. The server was very nice (5*) but the food delivery way too sub par. Quality of the food was good but not worth the revisit.  Corporate world.  Worst ever 3 hours to get apps food and check
Jennifer F.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",0,7,2,1.0,9/2/2016,"Decided to try take-out again. Ordered a Smokehouse BBQ Burger with fries. Fries were forgotten. Ordered Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. Received burger sliders for the person who does not eat red meat.  Sorry, Valley Fair Cheesecake Factory. You just don't live up to your brand."
Brian B.,"Livermore, CA",588,1091,120,2.0,11/12/2015,"The promise of TCF is always better than the reality. It feels like a 3 star place but I can't give it 3 and look at that ""A-OK"" tagline when it's a ""Meh"" experience. This location always has a wait because it's popular. No crime there. You put your name on the list and sit in the lobby area the size of the capitol rotunda. There are no soft surfaces and the tiny voice of the hostess is no match for the din. It's an annoying way to start the night and it's easily fixable.  The voluminous menu is overly confusing and includes advertising including one ad for an online service helping the friendless. Not a dating site. Just a site helping lonely people find other lonely people to become friends with. Festive, right?  The food seems overly fussy, a little bland and arrived just a tad on the cool side. We had no napkins and in asking for them were told that our server should have provided them. So now we have no napkins and feel like we've gotten our cheerful server in trouble. ""I can take care of that"" would have been a better response since I have zero interest in the inner workings of the processes and procedures at TCF.  The wine list could be MUCH better. Particularly the by-the-glass list. My malbec showed up slightly oxidized and tired but after the napkin moment, I frankly wasn't looking for interaction with the staff. It wasn't terrible. It's never terrible here. It's just ""meh."" I'll probably come back at some point hoping for better in the form of a good experience and I'll probably be disappointed again."
