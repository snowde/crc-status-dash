Molly M.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",2,19,2,1.0,1/18/2017,"We excitedly got together to celebrate 2 birthdays (group of 5) and we were disappointed from the time we came in. We were promised a 15min wait, however we had to wait 55min. Many guests who came after us, groups of 3,4,6,and 7, were seated before us. I kept asking, the manager kept telling me the same- we don't have tables for you.  So finally, we get seated, and I've never been so offended in any restaurant- our server was very dismissive, rude and not helpful at all. I asked him if he can replinish our bread basket, because we were very hungry, after waiting for a table for so long, he responded ""just wait, I can't help you now, I have other tables."" He was scolding me. I have never had this experience before. He was never available for any of our needs, so I decided to ask other servers who were passing by for our dessert, an extra orange juice drink, the receipt, and  to go boxes. Other servers were extremely pleasant and I appreciated their help. I would also mention to them that the server is no where to be found and he doesn't seem to want to serve us. They would apologize and would serve us right away.  To say the least, it was a horrible experience. I will never go back to the Valley Fair location. And I will tell all my friends and family to avoid that location as well. I spent $150 that evening and I tipped him 15%-  didn't want to because he didn't deserve the tip.  The manager was unprofessional and unhelpful, I did not want to deal with her as well. Because I asked so many times as to when our table will be ready, she offered a cheesecake slice on the house, when my bill came, I paid for all 5 cheesecakes- and I wasn't going to even try to get a slice free- I ran out of there as fast as I could. Very disappointed."
May C.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,4,1.0,7/30/2017,Terrible food! Have always love this place in the pass.  Went there on Saturday for lunch with my friend. We both ordered salads. The server came by a few minutes after we got our food and ask how everything was. I told him that my seared tuna was fishy and wasn't fresh. He offer to make me a new piece of fish. I agreed.  A minute later a manager came over to tell me all the fish was the same batch. Ask if I wanted something else. Also took the rest of the salad away. I said I wanted the same salad with steak. 45 mins later the salad arrived. My friend was done eating already. I took my overcooked steak salad Togo because we had already been there for almost 2 hours.  We were also charged for regular price for our salad and not lunch price. Didn't fuss. It probably would have taken another 1/2 hour to got it fix. Really!!! Very disappointed! The food use to be good. What happened?BTW didn't eat my salad. By the time I got it home it was all wilted and burnt pieces of steak were like wood chips.
Aj C.,"San Francisco, CA",647,890,2422,3.0,10/29/2015,"We went here to celebrate my friend's birthday. Came around 9pm and found parking without difficulty. We were expecting a long wait time but luckily it was only five minutes! We were quickly seated and ordered our food. I shared mine with my friend and let me tell you that the Louisiana pasta was amazing! Their servings here were definitely big so expect big portions. Luckily, we shared because if we didn't, I would've never finished it. There were a couple of things that I didn't like. First, the very dim lighting. I understand that the ambiance they're trying to portray was intimate, but it was literally Abercrombie & Fitch version of a restaurant. Another thing was the slow service. At the beginning, it seemed fine, but towards the end, our server seemed MIA. A contributing factor could've been our servers switching shifts. Would I come back here? Yes! I love to try more of their food. I've been told that it never disappoints, but the service was what holds me back. Would I recommend this to a friend? I would."
David H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/16/2017,"Went in for pick up, was told ten minutes.  An hour and a half later the order was ready after speaking with the manager. All I got was a ""thank you."" No apology. This happened on 9/16/2017.  Arrived at this location at 8:27pm, left at 9:55pm."
Becky T.,"Milpitas, CA",99,5,2,1.0,12/20/2016,"We came in to the Cheesecake Factory party of 10 which Krystal told us the wait will be an hour and 15 mins which was understandable. After an hour we wanted to get an update just to get and estimated time, however that's when thing went  left ,Krystal the manager seem to get offended when we ask about the time. She informed us that she already talked to the ""Asian"" lady, which by the way was rude and an unprofessional for a manager to act to refer to a person by the race , that it will be a long wait , which was understandable. Krystal should have handle the situation professionally which she didn't and we were highly offended which in turn had us walking away. For the future I recommend that Krystal don't refer people by their race and remain calm and handle it In a more professional way"
Ray Y.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,14,3,1.0,10/22/2016,"Annoying. Ordered a pick up and server told us it will take 20 minutes. When we got there it after 20 mins, the same guy told us our name and order were not  on the listed, then a min later he  recalled our order then acted like it he didn't forget. Guess what, I'm still waiting atm which already passed another 30 minutes just for two piece of cheese cakes and Text Mexico eggroll...seriously say sorry at least for wasting someone's life and admit that you forgot our order. Super annoying. I do not normally write a bad review, but this is way too annoying. Updated: Manager did not say sorry too and just offered a discount then told us like accept the fact and it happens. The hell is wrong with this place. Then, he left and we got the food... A minute later, the server , another one, who was listening the whole situation did not give us any discount and said "" I do not know any of this and talk to someone else.."" Already waste more than a hour so we just left... we will never come back this disrespectful place ever again."
Tarek S.,"San Jose, CA",14,35,1,1.0,2/4/2017,"I am not sure if its only me or there might be someone else, but I always feel sick after eating there. I am suspecting some hygiene problems or undercooked food. Once I ordered the chicken dish with rice and cashews  (very salty rice, very sweet chicken). The other day I ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta (I always get this one). These two times I had bad stomach issues and you can imagine the rest. Unfortunately I won't be there again. Seems there is a problem!"
Laure S.,"Upland, CA",0,56,8,2.0,8/7/2016,"Probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have visited thus far. I ordered the fried mac and cheese balls that were practically frozen in the middle. I had them remade for a second time only to have the same issue. Waitress didn't offer to remove it off the bill nor really seemed to know how to alleviate the problem.  As other reviewers have stated it took 40+ minutes to get my entree at 10:30 PM with a not very crowded restaurant. The food was average at best.  I ordered a cheesecake and mistakenly didn't know that a whole cake came in different sizes. The waitress charges me the most expensive $55.00 cake and didn't ask what size I wanted upon taking my order. I understand that I should have checked that, but as a waitress I would have expected her to ask ""what size would you like?"" Instead of charging me for the most expensive cake. I have a feeling the back of house is very unorganised and communication is lacking.  All in all I do not plan to eat here again. Pretty sad considering most of the cheesecakes I've eaten at have been pretty decent."
Monica S.,"Saratoga, CA",87,394,1358,4.0,11/3/2015,"Whenever I eat at the CF, I ALWAYS order the same thing: Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which is similar to a pasta primavera. Feeling a bit adventurous, I asked the waitress to help me off the beaten path and I decided on a Chicken Madeira, which is one of their most popular items. The chicken dish was moist and tender (just like our server said) and I had no complaints. Accompanying the chicken was a crazy amount of nicely seasoned mashed potatoes flecked with bits of red potato skin and couple stalks of asparagus. My dining companion had the factory burger which came with fries and was also pleased with his meal. In addition to our entree, we shared a salad of arugula, beets, apple, and goat cheese. Since I liked this salad combo, I decided to make it for a dinner party I was hosting that weekend. After the dinner, we, of course, had to have a cheesecake and ordered the limited edition salted caramel and it tasted as heavenly as it looked. While I was looking at the menu, I noticed they have a ""Super"" Food section which I would like to try for the next time. Although I don't eat at CF too often, whenever I do go, I'm always pleased with what I order."
Rosemary A.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,11,2,5.0,5/15/2017,I received the most exceptional Customer Service from Marilyn! She was really friendly and engaging as soon as we sat down. She made wonderful recommendations and we loved the food! She knew when to check in on us and made sure we were enjoying our food. Because of Marilyn we will be returning to this restaurant and I will recommend to see her with all my Friends and Family! Thank you Marilyn for a memorable incredible eating experience! Thank you Cheesecake Factory for having a phenomenal employee!
Daniel W.,"San Jose, CA",86,284,6,1.0,4/4/2017,I ordered the Caesar's salad without croutons because I am gluten free.  I specified that at ordering time.    There was a soggy hidden crouton in the meal.  They must pre make the salad and just picked out the croutons.  Celiacs beware.
Michelle F.,"Marysville, CA",92,10,14,4.0,4/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is my all time favorite restaurant. Our host was Grace, she was great. Came in at 11:30pm and I ordered stuffed mushroom for appetizer and she informed me (with a very good attitude) that they're out of stuffed mushrooms and asked for my second choice. Jokingly, I said that I had my heart set on them.. she came back minutes later to let us know that the chef is making us stuffed mushrooms from scratch. Wow! You don't often get that kind of service from well known/successful restaurants. She was also very polite with a positive attitude for the rest of the time we were there. Awesome food as always, fresh warm bread, excellent cheesecakes. Giving this location a 4 instead of 5 because of parking. Due to the construction around it, parking in front of cheesecake was $6 so you're better off going to the mall parking lot. Other than that, awesome experience tonight!"
Melissa M.,"San Jose, CA",142,24,9,5.0,12/2/2015,I came here yesterday with my mom and my grandma and everything was amazing!  It wasn't that busy and our server was on point!  Service was amazing. They were out of artichokes but our server recommended the sliders and they were so good.  We always come here and we will definitely come back!
Steven S.,"Greensboro, NC",23,151,65,5.0,10/30/2015,"The best of the Cheesecake Factory locations. Located at the Westfield Shopping town Valley Fair, next to Macy's Mens Store. Valet Parking $4. I have not been there in years but when I was there, this location was head and shoulders above any other of their many locations. Highly recommended, I usually have the shrimp with angel hair. This is fresh crunchy large shrimp sautéed with herbs, lemon and garlic served over angel hair pasta, fresh tomato and fresh basil, which I rate @ 10! Outstanding. I capped this off with the lemon/raspberry cheesecake - that is outstanding."
Joan E.,"Mount Hamilton, CA",37,10,,5.0,11/5/2016,"I was going to a dinner party and in charge of dessert, so decided I would bring a small cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory.  I called and ordered, and then found out that they did not open till 11 - I was already on my way.  Jason, the manager, said no problem, if I was paying with a credit card, he would open the door for me to get.  I brought in $5 for a tip, and even though he arranged eveything, he gave the money to the server working the bakery that day.  All I have to say, is Cheesecake Factory is lucky to have a manager who cares about his company and his employees.  A well run operation with EXCELLENT Cheesecake!!                                               JOAN"
Sohini B.,"Santa Clara, CA",66,4,2,4.0,11/16/2015,Tried the antioxidant salad. Was pretty good. Woul have liked the salad with little less olive oil. Calorie wise was pretty high due to the olive oil.i guess thats not the worst thing. My friend tried cheese quesedilla. Was filled with cheese. Couldnt finish it.
D Y.,"San Jose, CA",46,1039,190,3.0,9/16/2016,"Giant burrito - ok Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - good Cold brew iced coffee - strong Service - they try to seat you quickly, but it can take a while for the food to come out after they take your order"
Sophia Elisia M.,"San Leandro, CA",45,20,2,5.0,9/6/2016,"It's been a long time since I've stopped by cheesecake factory but me and my boyfriend had dinner here a few nights ago. We were seated super fast for a Sunday, and also got the best server in the house! Brenda was amazing and so delightful, she made my night. She was so friendly and on her game.  I wish I could eat with her all the time!  Honestly this girl is the best."
Rudi v.,"Oegstgeest, The Netherlands",4,4,3,1.0,7/25/2016,"Ive been in a number of their restaurants and it was alwas ok, but this time it was absolutely a 1 star... The food took very long to get, and was not good. Old croutons in the ceasar salad, sticky, tough nachos and a half frozen piece of cacke. Next to that the restrooms were DIRTY, and it took more than 1.5 hour and a talk to the manager to get them cleaned ...  Not recommended this time"
Callib C.,"Cameron Park, CA",7,21,,1.0,5/28/2016,"My girlfriend, her mom, and I went to this location for dinner. There was a wait, which for the time and day wasn't a shock nor a big deal. However the food and service was the worst we had ever had in our lives. To top it off both my girlfriend and her mother have been or are waitresses so they know their way around a restaurant. The waiter didn't know the menu, that's to say he didn't kow the size of their pizzas or if something came on the sandwich. They also spilled a full glass of water across my girlfriends mom and then just left the table, booth, and her soaking wet. It also bothered her that the waiter kept say hi guys or what do you guys need or sure guy I'll get that in right now, when short of myself she and my girlfriend are obviously women. The food was bland, flavorless, and the pizza was a salt lick. To top that off the cheese they shred onto your food was kept across from us in a rag on the server station. Then someone put a tray with dirty dishes on it and the it jus kept piling up and was eventually taken to another table to be used. They also took a fork off of the dirty dish tray and gave it to my girlfriends mom when she asked for a fork later. I had to stop her and gave her the one I wasn't using. I will never go to this location again and honestly may never return to the cheesecake factory at all. I wouldn't recommend it after this experience because there obviously isn't any love or passion in this place and if we are going to spend our hard earned money on food the it should be good and the service should compliment it."

The food was bland, flavorless, and the pizza was a salt lick. To top that off the cheese they shred onto your food was kept across from us in a rag on the server station. Then someone put a tray with dirty dishes on it and the it jus kept piling up and was eventually taken to another table to be used. They also took a fork off of the dirty dish tray and gave it to my girlfriends mom when she asked for a fork later. I had to stop her and gave her the one I wasn't using. I will never go to this location again and honestly may never return to the cheesecake factory at all. I wouldn't recommend it after this experience because there obviously isn't any love or passion in this place and if we are going to spend our hard earned money on food the it should be good and the service should compliment it."
