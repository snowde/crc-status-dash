Ree R.,"San Jose, CA",311,41,1,5.0,9/4/2017,"We love to come here and just sit in the bar area, which is family-friendly, because even when the restaurant is packed you can usually find somewhere to sit in this area. We love that it's open late and the food is great. The waiters and bartenders here are always friendly, personable, accomodating and give wonderful service!"
Jodi H.,"Silicon Valley, CA",290,812,1283,2.0,9/7/2014,"I've gotta say...Cheesecake Factory has gone dooooownhill in the past couple of years. I went back a couple of days ago with my family, and we haven't been in a couple of years...and back then we LOVED TCF. Maybe it was because I was still a kid back then and totally loved the glitz and glamor of the beautiful large space...but the quality of the food, service, and ambiance have completely changed for the worse. Located in the prime space of Valley Fair shopping center, EVERYBODY I know has been to this TCF location. With that being said, you're always going to have a wait whether it's 5 minutes or over a solid hour. The place is GRAND and gorgeous with their European-painted ceilings and royal setup and white-clad servers. However, the place felt so empty and the AC was turned up way too high on the weekday night that I was there. A few years ago, TCF was always bustling with people out in front, and the place was packed with chattering and laughter, but we just didn't get that the night we ate here. Maybe it was because it was a strange weekday night, but who knows. We were served by Bridget, and she was polite and smiley, but only came around to check on us once in a while. We really enjoyed her going above and beyond to give us a sweet Happy Birthday ice cream, so thanks girl! As a server in the industry, I just wanted to comment on the unfortunate dress code policy! I felt so bad for the servers because they had to wear ALL WHITE (top and bottoms), so it was more obvious to see their stains and what not...but that's just me being a picky observer. In terms of the food, it was a bit pricey for the portion size/quality. I had Evelyn's Favorite pasta...and it was WAYYYYYY TOO SALTY! My mom also had a pasta that was pesto of some sort, and we both agreed that we were just oversalted with our taste buds! The flavors were pretty yummy, but the pasta chef really needs to tone down the salt level. I wouldn't come back here in a while--too much has changed in the last couple of years, so it would take lots of convincing for anyone in my family to come back. There are better options across the street in Santana Row--so I highly recommend going there versus TCF here."
Larry J.,"Paso Robles, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/3/2017,This typically is my favorite restaurant to frequent although this was the worst experience ever and it takes quite a bit for me to complain for starters my wife ordered a burrito which in the menu indicated that it had sour cream and guacamole received the burrito neither was on it mentioned it to the waitress and she said she wasn't sure if it came with it after showing her the menu she brought out to sides of it then on my salad menu said it had crispy onion rings but weren't there mentioned that and the waitress brings me a small bowl of stale onion rings and thirdly my child ordered fettuccine alfredo it comes out with no sauce it's like when you bring it to the table it's pretty obvious it's missing white Alfredo sauce the waitresses need to get better product identification manager came out and removed the burrito from the bill we appreciated that
Brandon G.,"Santa Clara, CA",12,7,8,4.0,9/13/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to eat and drink! The ambiance makes you relax and want to have a nice drink with good company. Service is always great, refilling as soon as we're out and asking us if we need anything.  Food selection is a huge component when it comes to great restaurants, and this place has it! Their chicken nachos are AMAZING! Share it though, the portion is huge. Their buffalo wings are good starters, and The Americana burger is delicious.  It's also at a good location, right next to Valley Fair mall and Santana Row. Both super nice to walk around in. Can't wait to go back soon!"
Amanda N.,"Santa Clara, CA",222,328,568,4.0,9/11/2014,"This place is great for dinner. The servers tonight were very friendly with fast service.  For the appetizer we ordered the buffalo wings and I kid you not, they are the best wings I have ever tastes. They are super crispy and the flavors are just amazing. For the main course, I decided to order the Caesar salad, and my bf ordered the ribeye. The dressing for the salad was a bit sour (?) but it was still really good. The ribeye was perfect with tons of flavor."
Anais S.,"Fremont, CA",2,11,2,2.0,7/15/2016,"Our entrées were amazing and dessert was delicious, but when it came to our waiter Daniel, things weren't as great. Daniel was a really cool waiter, asking us how our Summer has been and telling us things from his own personal life, but when it came to the check it all went downhill from there. He started becoming unresponsive and short answered, even another waiter was about to grab our check because he saw how we were beginning to become restless. Finally, after a good 20 minutes of back and forth check giving and receiving we finally left. Hoping if we ever come back, he won't be helping us."
Lin Y.,"Piedmont Ave, Oakland, CA",23,22,12,2.0,6/3/2016,"Bad service. Ordered a slice of cheese cake to-go on a busy Friday night. I pointed the Chris Outrages Cheese Cake and asked: ""Is this chocolate."" The cashier said: ''yes it has chocolate."" This answer was not completely wrong cause it does have chocolate but turned out also coconut and walnuts. There was nothing wrong with the cashier's answer but I really expect that she could be more responsive and have said something such as ""this cake is mostly coconut"" or ""only the brown layer is chocolate cake"". I did not pursue my question so I ended up with a nutty coconut cake, which I ""kindly shared"" to a friend."
Janae B.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/15/2017,I love the servers at this restaurant. A waiter accidentally slipped and fell with our food in the back the manager promptly came to our table to apologize as even bought us salad and cheesecake on the house for the extra wait. The hospitality is real
Shelly H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,25,3,1.0,9/19/2016,"Had a very bad experience at this location a few days ago. Initially the service was good and our appetizers came on time. But after waiting for over 40 minutes our main courses never showed up. People seated after us ate and left. We asked multiple times and were told 'just a few more minutes' , 'they're plating' and my personal favorite 'they're at the window waiting to be delivered'.  I know a busy restaurant such as this one things can get hectic and mistakes are made, but no one - not even the manager, apologized nor tried to compensate us for our grievance.  Just accept your mistake, and try to make it up to the customer! Customer Service 101. But I guess with lines wrapping around the block, a few disgruntled customers don't matter right? Never again."
Eimear M.,"Clontarf, Republic of Ireland",0,5,2,3.0,7/10/2016,"I usually enjoy he Cheesecake Factory but just last night we got take out for dinner as our kitchen is out of action. Never again. We ordered two entrees but can't be too sure that's what we got. My husband ordered the chicken 'littles' and little they were not. The serving was huge. When it came to my meal I ordered one of the skinny luscious dishes, steak medallions. I have had this before at the restaurant and it was filling and delicious. That's not what I got this time. There was barely a tablespoon of mash potatoes, no sauce to speak off and very little else. Highly disappointing. I will have to think twice about going back there. I've heard people say it's over priced and it certainly was for us this time."
Donna P.,"San Jose, CA",91,20,2,1.0,12/4/2016,Last Thursday night I went to have dinner with a friend. As we were eating I looked to the side of the table and notice a cockroach that crawled from my plate. I immediately told the waiter who called the manger. The manager came and offered if he could get me something to go which was nice but why would I want something to go after I just seen a cockroach. We were getting ready to get up from the table and it started running all around the table the manager came back and see it and thank god there were other customers who see the cockroach as well. I will never go back.
Taylor E.,"San Jose, CA",4,13,9,1.0,4/10/2017,"I'm too annoyed to even want to write all of this out. We waited 30 min for someone to tell us that they couldn't serve us two of our  entrees because they were taking it off the menu . Okay fine , so we changed two of the orders to something else .  By this time were all kind of annoyed but thought it could get better. We sat around for another 15 min and still didnt even get our drinks! In the end we waited forever for food that was ""ok"" at best. My fiance didnt like his dish but did not want to wait even longer. The bill was expensive and the experience was poor. We will not be back."
Kevin L.,"Davis, CA",217,55,712,4.0,2/10/2016,"Having bought the giftcard and cheesecake deal during thanksgiving, we finally came by Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I ordered the garlic noodles, as I like garlic noodles. We started off with the usual bread and I especially enjoyed the darker bread (don't know what flavor it was). The waitress was also friendly and helpful to us. When the garlic noodles came, I started to eat. Since the server didn't ask if any of us wanted parmesan cheese, the waiter came by and noticed that and offered to grate us some cheese. So attentive! After getting cheese, we all started eating. The garlic noodles were pretty good in my opinion but I would've loved a stronger garlic flavor. As for the rest of the party, I've also took nibbles of each dish. There was some other pasta dishes and a tamale dish. All of which was pretty good. Having finished our meal, we ordered cheesecake.  We had the anniversary cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. I liked the red velvet cheesecake way better. The anniversary cheesecake was a bit too chocolatey for me. If you LOVE chocolate, I think you'd like the anniversary cheesecake. They had both a cream cheese layer and a cake layer. I don't know how they do it, but it works and it's good. I liked it. My meal was complete and was enjoyable. The service was also good and the atmosphere was peaceful."
Matthew B.,"Gilbert, AZ",79,2,,1.0,3/22/2017,"Very dissatisfied with the service we received this evening. Everything started off great, but then we waited 45 minutes for our entrees. The worst part is the table that arrived after us received their meals before we did! At that point we were just going to cancel our order and leave however a minute later our meals finally arrived. While we received the standard ""the kitchen is backed up"" about three times, no action was taken to address the matter. No manager came by to discuss our concerns. Not pleased at all. We weren't even offered a dessert menu and the end of our meal. We were simply given our check. We will not be back!"
Linda C.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2017,"Just ordered an omelette.  It was terrible.  Overcooked eggs(looked like the kind from a carton) that they sprinkled with bacon, avocado, and a little bit on onion(had to look for it),  asked for cheddar cheese, but they put a slice of American Cheese in it, then folded it in half.  It was cold and the english muffin was hardly toasted.  If you want an omelette, don't order it from the Cheesecake Factory.  The sad thing, the waitress never even asked how it was.  Kind of obvious when you leave everything on your plate."
Isa R.,"San Jose, CA",52,106,32,1.0,5/20/2016,Horrible service & disgusting cold food.  I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy.  45 min in the pick up line just for the wrong order.  They are just a name.
Chesean R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,57,54,1.0,12/6/2016,This place is never on time I could still be 22 minutes late and they still don't have my :) good ready its getting really anoyying busy or not it shouldn't take 30 minutes past the time the food is due and the store wasn't even packed when I went.
Timothy Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",36,5,,1.0,3/4/2017,"I ordered a birthday cake on the phone two days before the event. They either didn't take the order or completely forgot about it. They were very busy that day, which made me felt like my business isn't important."
Edgar V.,"San Jose, CA",1,1,6,1.0,6/27/2016,"Mmmm yummy  the kitchen  is so filthy  people , all people  care is to have a pretty  plate right. Hahahhaa"
Alexandra L.,"San Jose, CA",104,66,88,2.0,11/14/2015,"Bland bland bland. We usually eat at the Oakridge location, this was our first time here. Our favorites that usually taste great were SO BLAND this time. It's like the dishes were never salted at any step of the cooking process. My shrimp pasta came with the tiniest, saddest shrimp ever :(  Pasta dishes were almost all noodles and barely any goodies.  The gumbo though, was as good as usual. Seems like it's the only thing that tastes good at every location.  TL;DR do yourself a favor and skip the mediocre, bland pasta and get the gumbo."
