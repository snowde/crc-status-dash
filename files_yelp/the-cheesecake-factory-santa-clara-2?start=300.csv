Utpal S.,"Santa Clara, CA",52,3,,1.0,3/14/2017,"This place is totally ridiculous!  Hair in the food couple times, rude manager, insanely long wait times.  I would avoid this place at all cost!"
Isabel L.,"Berkeley, CA",396,52,52,3.0,7/31/2016,"I don't really understand why this restaurant seems to be so popular. I visited on a Sunday night for a friend's birthday party- we were told that our table would be ready at 6:30 pm, but we still had to wait until 7:15-ish. Though we immediately ordered, the food didn't arrive until 8 pm. My friend and I shared the shrimp and chicken gumbo ($16.95), which was large enough to feed us both, but wasn't anything spectacular.  Overall, a nice restaurant for special occasions, but be prepared to wait for 1-2 hours for your food! Pros: - Nice interior/ambiance - Free bread - Large entree sizes - Good food Cons: -REALLY LONG wait"
P A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/27/2017,"i have been getting take out occasionally from the Cheescake Factory for many years.  While never great, they had decent food and great variety that pleased my family.  This weekend, we got take out which consisted of 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 slices of cheesecake.  We regretted everything.  I truly feel the food was barely edible, and much of it went uneaten and discarded.  What the hell happened?  I will say the cheescake was good, but half the size it was in previous years, but not half the price.  Sorry, Cheescake Factory - we are breaking up.  It's not me, it's you."
David W.,"Newcastle, Australia",11,4,,5.0,3/11/2017,"Excellent service, terrific food. I really enjoyed my meal here, and if only I were a local I would be back again and again."
Kim N.,"Alum Rock/East Foothills, San Jose, CA",0,6,10,3.0,2/26/2017,Food was lack of flavor and margaritas were pricey. Nothing special. Our table was stolen by someone btw :( .Hosting should be done better.
Venkatesh A.,"Fremont, CA",10,1,,1.0,3/21/2017,"I am very disheartened and angry with Cheesecake Factory after my Sunday visit. My wife, my 22 month old daughter and I waited for our table for about 30 minutes. We finally were take to our table where we eagerly decided what to have for dinner. No one came to take our order for about 15 minutes. I had to ask one of the waiters to help us, they obliged and we finally gave our order. After placing our order we waited of 15 minutes before we had to ask someone for water and bread as my daughter was staring to get hungry. The waiter suggested we wait and would only be served by the same person who took the order.  After waiting for 10 more minutes we asked another waiter to help out; he said he would check the status of the order. He finally came back with some water but said they were out of bread and were preparing the next batch. While we were waiting for bread to arrive I saw every other table being served with bread and food. Despite mentioning that by daughter was hungry nothing was being done. After 1 hr 15 minutes we decided to leave as we never got bread or our drinks.  We let the receptionist know that we are leaving without having any food, she asked us to talk with the Manager. The manager intervened and mentioned that we don't have to pay for food; without even listening to what we complaining about. After letting the manager know that we had nothing to eat she said sorry and would be ok if we left.  This made my wife and me sad and angry. None of staff cared about a 22 month old leaving hungry without any food. I was angry that the Manager jumped to a conclusion saying that we don't have to pay for food even before listening to us. I did not expect this kind of behavior from any restaurant. I felt like yelling at the Manager but I did not see any point in that."
Teresa H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,38,25,3.0,8/4/2016,Pro's: The food is wonderful and once you are seated the waitress was helpful and friendly. Cons: The greeting staff did not even look up once and quite honestly when I asked how the wait was she was very curt in her response. The three others were not very courteous either. Seriously should not be up front. If I were not meeting friends here I  would not have stayed.
Magda T.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,17,,1.0,10/22/2016,"I used to love the curb side pick up. Now it's horrible. I called in my order of a salad. It took more than an hour. Waited at the curb for 20 minutes before I gave up and left. Unfortunately, Door Sash has ruined this. There are at least 20 drivers waiting to get their orders and apparently they take priority over drive up customers."
Dwight M.,"Fremont, CA",11,30,45,5.0,12/10/2016,This place is great the bartenders hold up under great pressure. Gilbert and Robert are the best
RubyJournal ..,"San Jose, CA",2,50,137,1.0,9/6/2015,"You know service is REALLY bad if you FINALLY decide to create a yelp account after procrastinating for so long.  We were a party of 14 and waited about 2 1/2 hours to get seated.  It's a Saturday night and we had a bigger party so that was understandable.  However, when you're told '10 more minutes' 3 times, who wouldn't get impatient?! After being seated, our server took our orders in a very impolite manner.  Also, we were missing 2 waters at one side of the table and was told she'd bring it but never did.  That was the same thing with adding cheese to the pasta my sister ordered and when asked for the cheese again, the server had the audacity to give attitude and say 'oh you wanted cheese?' In addition to that, my bf didn't even get the burger he ordered yet and said he'd have to wait a little longer then bc of the cheese. EXCUSE ME?? Really? Then she continued to roll her eyes and walk away.  It also got to the point where we had to ask and talk with the manager. Long story short, food was definitely not worth the wait and service was just HORRIBLE.  It's such a shame to come here for a birthday party celebration and have a server ruin the night with her bad attitude."
Shirish B.,"San Jose, CA",146,2,,1.0,3/19/2017,"The server was outright rude, right from the start. The least you can expect the server is to not treat you like shes doing you a BIG favor by asking you for the order every time. Terrible experience. Her name was M something and in her mid 40s."
Amanda R.,"San Jose, CA",1,7,,1.0,3/28/2016,"How bad does your service have to be to screw up a take out experience. TAKE OUT?! Where interaction should be at most 10 mins, most of which is on the phone placing the actual order. From the moment the bakery picked up to take my order, it was obvious the guy was in a bad mood. He made the evident from the complete lack of any type of phone etiquette or pleasantness. I only ordered two slices of cheesecake which meant the order should've been easy enough. As soon as he gave me expected ready time and before I could even say thank you, he had already hung up. Considering it is a Monday night, are you really that busy you can't even afford to be pleasant on the phone.  Once we got there to pick up our order, we came to find a huge line of 10+ people waiting to place cheesecake orders. We asked the host if we still needed to wait seeing as how we already placed our order (the point of placing a to-go order is to avoid all of these things). After letting out an obviously exaggerated sigh as if we were bothering him, he said yeah and walked away. To do what I'm not sure as there was no one waiting to be seated. After about 20 mins of waiting in line, we were greeted without even a smile or eye contact from the woman working the bakery register. I was so annoyed with the total looks of constipation and annoyance everyone in that established had that we just paid and left.  Once we got home, yet another disappointment. My cheesecake was thrown together so sloppily it was falling over and apart in my container and was starting to get watery as if it had been left out the entire time. Seeing as how my boyfriend was holding it up on the drive home, there's no way it happened during the drive.  Ridiculous. Never again."
Munazzar T.,"San Jose, CA",128,63,9,5.0,2/5/2017,Seriously the dude who served us for really nice especially since it was a birthday plus I had a 5 year old and he was very attention be and quick service! Great experience as always :)
Eric Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/31/2017,"We waited 40 minutes to get a table, which is fine as they told us it would be 20-30 minutes.  But when we got to the table, we ordered food and drinks immediately, as we had a 4 year old with us.  Over 50 minutes later, our food arrived.  Our server did not show up except to tell us our food was being plated three times, but the last visit was at least 20 minutes before we got our food.  the manager came to see us, and you could tell he was a pro at talking to unhappy customers.  Offered his apologies that the kitchen was slow, but told us it was because it was National Cheesecake Day and they were short staffed.  Of all the restaurants that may be aware of National Cheesecake Day??????  Food was ok, but overpriced.  I recommend taking your business elsewhere."
Brianna F.,"Santa Clara, CA",25,3,,1.0,8/5/2017,"I've been here several times for birthday dinners and just casual family get togethers. Service here is average nothing too great, but today marks the day where service was completely bad. We waited for our food for about 30-45 minutes, and my brother and I  got our foods first. My mom and dad didn't get their food until 15 minutes later. Our waitress explained that someone ""stole"" my dad's shrimp and sausage pasta that's why they had to remake it. My mom got her burger on the wrong bun and had no fries with it. Also the burger patty itself was way too over cooked it would crumble every time you touch it."
G. N.,"Cupertino, CA",1,23,,5.0,2/21/2017,"Ate here a couple of weeks ago -- love this place! My friends and I came in here to try cake slices, and we ordered four different flavors of cake slices. We were seated without much wait (maybe 5 minutes) and got a nice booth. Our waitress was really nice and she quickly obliged when we asked for takeout boxes and extra dishes to go. And, she was nice about helping us split the bill with our credit cards and cash. No complaints."
Jonathan D.,"San Jose, CA",5,3,,5.0,1/24/2017,Went to have dinner with some friends for another friends birthday and had the pleasure to be helped by Drakw and the bartender Dj.  They were definitely very helpful in making suggestions to drinks and food since it was our first time. Food came quickly and drinks were on point.
Jerae K.,"San Jose, CA",168,53,47,3.0,11/4/2016,"ONLY HUGELY IRRITATING thing I hate to point out is their lights. I'm guessing low light is for a more intimate setting kind of feel, but I mean can I least get some light to read my menu? I love their great tasting food here, it's a bummer that I'm stuck in a dilemma every time because of their lighting. Service is great, always on top of re-fills and everything we ordered comes just as we wanted. I could've just gave 4 stars since light is the only thing wrong but it's such a huge problem. By the time I get my entree I have a huge headache from the dim lights, maybe if they could have lights and an option to brighten them somehow that would really change my 3 star to a 5."

I told the water about my dinner and he said he was sorry but didn't offer to have it fixed right. and I didn't want to raise a stink about it. cheese cake was ok but my wife's was great. I will not go back to this place. I've gone to other cheesecake factory's and they were good."
Brittany A.,"San Jose, CA",33,227,110,3.0,5/24/2016,this place has a decent happy hour but I've had several occurrences where getting take out took too long and the service is somewhat slow. the food is pretty good however and i love their Brunch! I wish it wasn't only on Sundays but i recommend coming early any time of day because they typically have long waits. If you really want the cheesecake experience (and don't mind waiting until you're old) go to the one in San Francisco Union square and sit outside! Amazing view!
