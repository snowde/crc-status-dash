Krista G.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,2,1,1.0,2/12/2017,Had a reservation at 6:20 - got the table at 7. The kids meal was so bad it should not be served in a restaurant ( overcooked pasta that was brought in after standing a while somewhere) . Food didn't come all at the same time - fries came after everyone was pretty much done with their food. So bad I will never go back. One plus is the manager acknowledged this. But that won't really help when you spend 2 hours like that....total disaster.
Marty C.,"San Jose, CA",161,53,53,1.0,3/14/2016,"By far the worst experience at this Cheesecake Factory 3rd time in a row. I order from here all the time and take my food Togo and I also dine in. Tonight was the straw that broke the camels back.  I placed my order at 9:30pm. Was asked if I want complimentary cutlery and bread. I obliged and said yes and I also requested ranch dressing. The server told me it would be about 20 min and the food will be ready.  I arrived at 10:15pm.. When I arrived the lady at the register was inputting her tips in the computer and asked me to wait for 10 minutes I waited like an idiot and now 55 minutes later and my order was still not ready. I asked for ranch because they forgot my ranch. Finally 5 minutes later ranch came out  I wanted to add banana cheesecake to my order they were out..  I wanted to add chocolate moose cheesecake to my order they were out..  I wanted to add carrot cake to my order they were out .. I wanted bread with my meal. Guess what they handed me a rock hard stale piece of bread and when I asked the cashier for some real bread. He went digging in other people's to-go bags until finally going to the kitchen and finding out there's no more bread!  At this point I have been at Cheesecake Factory for 40 min it's 10:55 and they are about to close. And the guy who helped me saw I was frustrated and annoyed and didn't offer any explanation but send an older Asian lady  over to tell me they had no bread.  By the time I got home finally and sat to eat food was cold and not edible. Ended up throwing all the food away.  Cheesecake Factory how can you run out of cheesecake??! It's your main product. This place should be called ""were out of Cheesecake Factory""  No one offered me a single discount and no one apologized for the crap service. I guess they don't care about their customers. I'll never be back again to this ""We're out of Cheesecake Factory"". Go to the actual ""Cheesecake Factory"" at Oakridge"
Christina T.,"San Jose, CA",190,297,768,3.0,9/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory - the standard to get what you want with lots of options and big portions! Tonight, I started off with a cosmopolitan, huge martini glass!  Feeling light - ahi carpaccio - savory  and fresh Crispy crab cakes - tasty crab cakes, mushy  Miso Salmon - one of my favorites from them If you tell them it's your birthday, they will give you a mini chocolate Sunday with a candle!"
Kiirstie R.,"Watsonville, CA",0,2,,3.0,2/5/2017,"Wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Food was pretty good, but the service wasn't great. I had high hopes for this place. This review is based off my first and only time there. They were out of many items on the menu and as a first time visitor, I would hope they would have a full menu. Overall not bad."
Jorge A.,"San Jose, CA",64,3,,4.0,2/3/2017,A nice casual spot if you would like to come on a nice dinner. It is usually busy on friday nights but totally worth the wait time. The pastas are excellent and the factory nachos are just a delecasy.
Jamie L.,"Cupertino, CA",0,4,3,1.0,1/5/2017,"Really bad experience tonight during our dinner. The food took 45+ minutes to arrive at our table. To make matters worse, our server forgot that we also ordered an ala carte side dish of French fries. Now more waiting was required. Our server disappeared for over 20 minutes during this wait. Very bad time for him to go on break! Our steak was cooked medium when we asked for well done and it came as cold. There was a dark red hue in the steak where we expected 0 coloration. We ordered our desert at the same time as our entrees but our server apparently didn't log that in as he offered desert ideas to us while we were still eating. Be aware if you want to visit the place because you have to help yourself since waiter here just can't remember your order and they don't even care about it. I will not be back any time soon!"
Maddy L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",233,14,2,4.0,7/9/2017,Good service but I don't recommend ordering a Moscow mule here. Probably the worse I've had. The cheesecake was great and food is alway good. Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.
Katie F.,"San Jose, CA",24,65,12,4.0,6/14/2016,"I used to have this love-hate mindset when the topic of The Cheesecake Factory would pop up: Love their cheesecake. Hate their food. My boyfriend and I finally decided to drop by to use a gift card that's been collecting dust for around two years. I was initially planning to either (hopefully) cash it in to someone or just give it away, thinking there's no way I'd use it. I'm glad I did. We ordered the buffalo tenders appetizer to start, which is a little pricey at $9, but surprisingly yummy. Normally I don't really like spicy buffalo anything, but my boyfriend ordered it without prior knowledge of this, and the waiter swiftly put in the order before we could track him down to change our minds haha.  My boyfriend also ordered the Cheesecake Factory burger with cheese (I think?? Does this exist on the menu? lol) and I got the au jus sandwhich (I can't remember the name of this either). Both were really freaking good! We could only finish half our meal, so took the rest as leftovers for the next day. Even microwaved it was great :D I definitely have a change of heart for Cheesecake Factory now. Many people I know don't really like it either, but I don't mind attempting to change their minds after this."
Catrina A.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"WORST SERVICE ,  we've been to a couple of their restaurants . But they've messed up on our order, burnt out food and refused to give us complimentary food. Advice for the manager, look for a new job."
Tiffany W.,"San Jose, CA",267,314,197,3.0,8/14/2014,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, what could go wrong? I don't particularly love this place, but I don't have anything against it. It's actually nice place to have dinner with some friends or family if you're not in the mood for fast food. The menu changes every 6 months so your favorites may get tossed out of there. Everything is pretty decent and tasty here. I do love the free bread that comes with your meal, especially the brown bread. It's freshly baked, and usually warm. Of course, their cheesecake is good.  Oh yeah, it looks nothing like what it does in The Big Bang Theory, LOL."
Amy C.,"Newark, CA",1518,982,1731,4.0,3/16/2014,"If you're craving for some delish cheesecake, do get your bootie at a Cheesecake Factory ASAP. Haha cause no matter what kind of cheesecake you are into, they are bound to fulfill any type of flavor you're hankering for since their menu is extensive!  I've tried several ones which were all yummy but I'm def more into the sweet decadent chocolate ones the most.  My most recent visit my friend and I shared a S'mores Galore & Key Lime cheesecake. I so loved the s'mores galore cause it was deliciously decadent. Not much of a fan of the keylime though since I'm not of a fan of keylime anyways. Too tart for my tasting. They also a variety of food which are pretty yummy. I had a Mac & cheeseburger which was very cheesy & nomtastic.  But my fave location has got to be Union Sq because of view. :)"
D G.,"Arcata, CA",4,102,4,2.0,10/11/2016,"Service and ambiance were ok. Casual dining, nothing more nothing less. I was looking forward to the Pit Beef Dip. Unfortunately I have to agree with another reviewer that the meat was full of gristle and fat. It's kind of embarrassing to be the one person who's constantly wrestling with their food, or having to casually set pieces of chewed gristle aside on the plate. I love french dip-style sandwiches, but this one was waaaaaaaaaaaay too salty. I know that this type of sandwich is high in sodium by default, but both the meat and the au jus were so overwhelmingly salty that I couldn't taste whatever other seasonings might have been used. Not the best impression this time around. I'll stick with the desserts for now."
Christy M.,"San Jose, CA",67,8,8,1.0,3/26/2016,"The wait time was about 20 mins. Not too bad. It was a busy lunch time. We were seated and after we ordered our appetizers the waitress did inform us that the kitchen was a little behind. Which I thought was thoughtful of her to do.  Food was ordered. Food came some time later. Absolutely no flavor. One dish seemed like "" where was the food?"".  We had a great waitress. I would not recommend this place for the lack of flavor to the food in combined with the costs.  I would have gone to Maggiano's and would have waited for their food instead."
Laura A.,"Hollister, CA",3,21,1,4.0,12/21/2016,Service and food were excellent. Our wait time was 10 mins and and food was fast. I took one star away because the bathrooms were disgusting. There was only one stall that had toilet paper out of four stalls. The paper towels had over flowed from the garbage onto the floor. Someone clearly had not tended to the bathrooms in a long time. On my way out I mentioned the bathrooms to one of the employees.
Nathan N.,"San Jose, CA",264,127,170,4.0,5/8/2016,"I've come to the Cheesecake Factory a bunch of times over the past few years because it is always a solid option for dinner.  In terms of consistency with food, service, wait and atmosphere I would have to rate the Cheesecake Factory among one of the better restaurants.   Ambiance:  Very spacious environment with high ceilings and lots of room.  Definitely a very loud, fast paced and packed environment throughout the day making it one of the more fun places to dine at with a group.  Whether you are going as a party or a date, the Cheesecake Factory provides a fun and exciting environment to enjoy your meal in.   Food:  The menu here is super extensive with hundreds of options to choose from for meals, drinks and desserts.  I'm not lying when I said the most difficult thing is deciding what to eat and then trying to finish their massive portions.  My favorite options so far have been the: Pasta Da Vinci, Chipotle Chicken Pasta and Factory Meatloaf.   The pasta's are always cooked well with great ingredients and served as a massive portion.  The meatloaf is huge, cooked perfectly and topped with a very deep and beefy mushroom sauce.  Other good dishes I have had here are the stuffed mushrooms, burgers, chicken bellagio and their steaks.  Last but not least I can not forget about the delicious cheesecake options they have here.  Similar to their dinner menu, they have what seems like hundreds of cheesecake options which are all very delicious and rich.   My favorite one so far is the Red Velvet cheesecake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  Service: Service here is always very friendly and helpful.  Top notch servers with great knowledge of the menu and very helpful with any requests or questions you have.  Requests are taken care of quickly, water is always filled and you are checked on without being pestered too much throughout your meal. Overall Experience:  I recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone looking for a solid option whether its brunch, lunch or dinner.  Great staff, great food and great ambiance make for a good meal every time I visit."
Yikai L.,"New York, NY",91,331,504,5.0,5/19/2016,"Arrived early (about 4:50 pm) so no need to wait. Very nice waiter provides recommendations on salad. Hear they sing birthday song too. Very large portion for salad! Cheesecakes are a must, original, strawberry and oreo are all awesome!"
Shanique J.,"San Jose, CA",139,3,,1.0,10/9/2016,"It was a very busy night and I could tell our waitress was tired. I tried to take that into consideration until numerous things started happening, such as my friend getting a dirty glass with food on it..as well as my other friend getting a bad macchiato with all foam, and then me having to wait an hour for my pasta because it was burned. With all of this going on, the waitress didn't make any comments to check in on us and let us know the food would be there soon or communicate anything to us. #HorribleService"
Nicolas J.,"San Jose, CA",327,40,,1.0,9/6/2016,"Tried calling twice to place a take out/to go order. Both times she simply answered ""thank you for calling Cheesecake factory may I place you on a brief hold(CLICK)..."" Neither time did she even acknowledge my response. It's laughable -I suppose. The first wait was 5 mins before I hung up. The second time I called back I simply waited to see how long they'd actually leave someone on hold. 11+ mins. Is this acceptable?  For comparison, The Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto is typically 3-5 minute exchange from dialing all the way through to order confirmation."
Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",271,647,3103,4.0,7/12/2015,"My husband and I are from Upstate NY, where we usually had pleasant experiences dining out.  We found that the customer service at many Bay Area establishments was seriously lacking, but not at this place! :) We dined at this eatery on multiple occasions between fall 2014 through spring 2015.  The service was always on point, food was fresh and the cheesecake was delicious. I recommend trying a piece of the plain cheesecake with hot fudge, it's amazing!"
Abby E.,"Gilroy, CA",1,4,,3.0,8/23/2016,It wasn't my first time there but it was not great. It took a long time for appetizers and we were very hungry. The garlic bread was really good but I did not love the hamburgers. I liked but it don't think I will be back anytime soon.
