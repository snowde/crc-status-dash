Brittany C.,"Castro Valley, CA",59,27,16,5.0,9/29/2016,"Fantastic service from our server Levi tonight. Came out for a nice evening and got just what we were looking for... Levi was friendly, helpful, and kept us informed of the status of our order when it was running a little long. We were waiting for some Thai lettuce wraps and when they were delivered (slightly behind schedule, as we were informed that they were going to be) the presentation was exquisite. Well worth the wait. And then shortly after diving in, the manager came by to make sure everything was just right. This was a proactive stop at our table and of course the entire evening had been the perfect date night. Thank you Levi and the manager who stopped by to double check. See you again!"
Jennifer W.,"Cupertino, CA",61,94,77,4.0,6/24/2015,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory today for lunch around noon. There was no wait and we were quickly seated.  Like others have mentioned, the menu is a bit overwhelming, but the lunch specials seemed decent. We ordered the Miso Salmon and the Salmon Genovese (both were the lunch special versions). The food came quickly. Be aware that the portions, even for the lunch specials, are large! We both ended up eating only half and packing the other half to-go. Both salmons were cooked well, and despite having a lot of sauce, neither were too salty. If you're debating between the two, the miso has a more subtle flavor that's a bit sweet while the genovese has stronger flavors that are more savory. The server was attentive and friendly, and the service overall was quick.  Be aware that the AC there is turned up high, so if you're sensitive to the cold, bring a jacket!"
Wenting Z.,"San Jose, CA",25,107,185,2.0,3/30/2016,"Service is not good. We were waiting for a hour on a Wednesday evening, and I finally asked them. They said oh, your pager didn't ring? We called your name a while ago..... But the fact is that we were in front of the reception desk all the time.... And then, we got sited. My plate and knife were dirty...... Food has good size, good, but it doesn't worth 1 hour waiting. Tips for people, if you have waited too long, make sure to ask them."
Beer W.,"San Jose, CA",10,130,20,4.0,4/30/2016,"Decent food for the price point. Their avocado rolls are the best. Their chicken entrees are also consistently solid.  Their salad are so so.  The cheesecake and the carrot cake are also super awesome.  Which is no surprise to anyone.  They also have very late hours on the weekends, which is a definitely plus in this area."
Ashley L.,"Los Angeles, CA",249,9,20,5.0,3/5/2017,Went out to the mall and decided to grab some cheesecake. Well we ordered 2 pieces togo and made sure to ask the guy that took my order if they were prepackaged. He said they were so we proceded. Litsten I always come here and wait like an hour to get seated so I usually dont mind. Tonight I ate dinner already and just want my favirate cheesecake for my birthday. Well nooooo I still had to wait -____- 25 minutes when I saw my cheesecake sitting on top of the counter. Our server Austin looked at us and walked away! There were 6 people behind the counter and only one was preoccupied by a customer! The other staff was just standing around while there were boxes and boxes waiting to be given to customers who had already PAID! I always get a skimp ass piece of cheese cake from this location and crappy service. Maybe I should wait for new management to return im tired of wasting my money. There was a point where i came in at least once a week for a slice. Not now -____-
bao t.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/19/2016,"The qualify of food here is not consistent by any means, but we've never had a bad experience from this location...until now. My wife ordered a burger and requested medium rare. I ordered the steak and also requested medium rare. My steak came out overcooked, but I was fine with it since it would take too long for them to make another. My wife's burger came out looking OK, but a few bites into it, she showed me the burger and it was very rare! The burger patty on the inside was red and completely uncooked. How two requests for ""medium rare"" came out entirely opposite is beyond me. The manager came over and acknowledged the mistake, apologized, and offered her another dish but she declined since she has lost her appetite. The bill came and unsurprisingly, they charged us for the burger. We were mad, but there was no point in arguing and ruining our Friday night.  They need to change their billing policy and not charge for flawed food. If you're going to charge $12 for a burger, at least do it right. I've had a small mom and pops restaurant comped $80 of food because it was salty. A huge restaurant chain like this surely can swallow $12."
Sara J.,"San Jose, CA",1,23,,5.0,9/19/2016,Came in on a Sunday night (9/18/2916) and we had the pleasure of having Ramon as our server. He was very attentive and sweet. He went out of his way to make sure we received a certain dessert and we were highly appreciative! Thank you Ramon :)
Sam C.,"San Jose, CA",3,12,1,5.0,9/16/2016,"Did a little ordering in tonight and we decided on trying some appetizers to pig out! We got the loaded baked potato tots, sweet corn tamales, and the sliders. The tots and tamales are amazing and were the first things gone, the sliders were dry and really needed cheese and maybe some kind of sauce. With the crazy long menu I think doing a few appetizers is totally the way to go here."
Jessica R.,"Fremont, CA",40,6,,5.0,8/2/2016,Celebrated my Birthday here. Our server was excellent really friendly and professional. I ordered the White Chicken Chili which was delicious. To drink I had the Georgia Peach cocktail which was really yummy. We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls appetizers which is one of my favorite dishes - love the cilantro peanut sauce. I've received exceptional service each time I've been here whether I sit at the bar or get a table. This is one of my favorite Cheesecake locations I always recommend this location when friends want to go to Cheesecake factory. I picked out the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake for desert which is my second favorite cheesecake here now. They decorated my cheesecake for my birthday which was a nice touch.
Rocking V.,"New York, NY",7,117,37,1.0,3/6/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake factory.  We ordered tonight through Doordash. The food arrived cold and tasted crap.  - Mac and cheese balls - someone had added salt twice! It was totally unpalatable. We simply had to throw it away.  - Everyone's Fav Pasta - is no one's favorite pasta. The pasta was uncooked! - Stuffed mushroom - was the only thing slightly edible They did not even include utensils. Seriously, for the price you pay, this is NOT the kind of crappy food you expect. Do they even do quality checks for to-go orders? It seems like they just make some crappy shit in a hurry and throw it out for customers.  This is easily the worst branch of Cheesecake factory. Going by the number of negative comments here, I doubt anyone reads these reviews or cares, anyway!"
Cesar F.,"Oakland, CA",0,19,,1.0,9/12/2016,"I came in after having called in an order, at the time they told me it'd be ready to find out the order hadn't been put in. They told me to wait just 10 minutes and they'd have it up. It's not a lot of time, but the reason why I called in the order is because I'm in a crunch for time in the first place, so every minute counts.  15 minutes later the order comes up I'm handed a bag with the food, and walk out. No apologies from them, no discount on the bill. I get to where I'm going only to find out when I get there that there is no utensils or napkins in the bag. Nice!"
Sarika S.,"San Jose, CA",126,358,98,1.0,12/27/2015,"Wow! I placed a to go order on 12/11 of Louisiana Chicken Pasta, picked it up, brought it home and found hair. I emailed them a few days after to tell them about my experience. The manager from the store called me and left me a nice VM & apologized and said he would send me something. Fast forward to yesterday. I got something. $15. That didn't even cover the cost of the meal which I didn't eat. So, I paid for a meal, tax, tip, couldn't eat my food, had to go out and get more good and only got $15. Thanks guys!  Way to show you care about my experience."
Ladyreyes R.,"Daly City, CA",7,72,41,5.0,2/15/2016,"Awesome happy hour!! Made up for the horrible one across the St at LB steakhouse. As soon as we walked in it was warm and inviting . Bartender was awesome! The food and service was perfect . I had a Cosmo and my BF had a delish mojito !  Both served as regular portions , perfect pour! The whole staff tending to us was great! The sliders were perfect and all portions were generous. Get out there! So worth it"
Tena V.,"CA, CA",24,109,159,5.0,1/12/2016,"Last night (Monday), 8 of us went for dinner and a b'day celebration. It wasn't busy (we got lucky) so we got seated immediately at 7:00 pm.  I want to brag on our amazing waiter, D. J. He was super nice and we never had to look for him to give us water and take our plates. I snuck a note to him to give our birthday guy a surprise cake and ice cream. He brought it as soon as the dishes were cleared and he and a few other wait persons sang happy birthday. They had wrote around the edge of the plate in chocolate, ""Happy Birthday, Allen"". Which made the surprise special.  All of our (generous portioned) dishes were delicious.   Thank you, D. J.!"
Espino L.,"King City, CA",0,7,10,3.0,12/11/2016,"Great place to eat , god food sometimes service is slow due to full place but highly recommend it and the desserts are money"
Phuc D.,"Milpitas, CA",0,50,37,5.0,5/17/2016,"I came with my family for celebration. Host so friendly, waiter is cool, he take care us excellent. Food good, great decorated.  I will come back again."
Joy R.,"San Jose, CA",190,259,25,4.0,1/21/2016,"Been around the river bend, from SF to the yay area and this factory is the way it is anywhere else LIKE! That is when it comes to the food.  It has been consistent.  A comforting thing to note.  Overall in regards to service I have had a commendable experience. Another star on your lapels! Surprise a feature item.  Still good.  I won't complain.  but the signage on your ""To Go"" parking slots; is that at any point a conclusive or inconclusive item to note?   With that said, customer service going in and buying to 'take out' was good.  Thanks with Cheesecake syrup on top."
Yvonne B.,"Santa Clara, CA",108,157,1120,4.0,2/27/2015,I have always like the Cheesecake Factory especially for a nice place to eat out. I love the Chicken Madeira and the Cajun Jambalaya over noodles. The restaurant makes the best mashed potatoes in my opinion. Every now and then I will get a slice of cheesecake especially the seasonal flavors like pumpkin.  But my other favorite which many people tend to overlook is the strawberry shortcake. Sounds simple enough but there is just something really extra delish about it. Everything just melts in your mouth and presentation is extra nice.  The atmosphere is noisy though so it is hard to talk to people above the noise.
A Z.,"Hollister, CA",45,133,151,4.0,1/25/2015,"The wait is usually extremely long. The food is so worth it tho, I've loved everything if ever gotten from this cheesecake. And I have always had great customer service here considering they're always so busy"
Salim M.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,1,1.0,6/4/2017,"I've been there many times and usually very mediocre service! The person that seated us was very kind, our waiter decided to come out and take our order 20 minutes later and then our food never came till about an hour later. Asked for a manager they never showed up either. Called and Spoke with a manager, she didn't care either. Our waiters name was Jesse, very patronizing and tried to be a smart a*s. NEVER EVER GOING and don't recommend anyone EVER going. Definitely should've been compensated but instead I got a mediocre response from the unprofessional manager that didn't bother to even show up to our table when asked to."
