Rita K.,"San Jose, CA",17,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,"I used to love Cheesecake Factory for all  variety of foods and specially for the low calorie menu.  Yesterday I brought my friend there to celebrate her birthday and we had terrible experience.  First, we sat at the bar and ordered few drinks in meantime my friend noticed that table behind us at the bar was about to become available and we informed the person that was sitting there that we would like to have that table when he leaves so we can sit down and have our dinner but as soon as that person took off another man rushed and grabbed that table and insulted my friend who tried to tell him that we were there first.  Then another table same thing happened.  Bartender noticed what happened didn't do anything.  My friend at that moment she was really upset and complained to 3 different managers everyone was sorry but didn't offer anything and didn't even try to resolve the situation or speak to those men.  I was really upset at having my girlfriend bullied like that.  I know in that free range area at the bar is first come first serve but in our case we just got bullied we were there first and still weren't able to get those tables just because we got bullied by men who told my friend get out of my face!!! Honestly I will never ever go to Cheesecake Factory again, management need to establish some system first before this hall thing happens again, they at least need to pay attention to what is happening."
Mateo M.,"San Jose, CA",46,53,33,5.0,3/5/2015,"Came for a really nice early birthday dinner with my love. Didn't have to wait, seated right away and our waiter Luis was great. Kept on top of things and super nice, real cute.  FYI the bang bang chicken and shrimp is hella good!"
Helen M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,63,6,1.0,7/27/2016,"Went in today for lunch with a co-worker, and it took 45 minutes for them to prepare/bring our food.  I'm serious, 45 minutes! They totally forgot our order, and after I complained about it, the waitress/manager lady came and apologized saying that many of their staff changed shifts, and they were understaffed for half an hour or so!! What? Will I get a refund at least? NO way, don't even think about it.  They made sure we pay every single penny for what we got after 45 minuets of waiting! Poorest costumer service ever... Avoid coming here, with SO MANY options around this area, don't even bother to walk around this place...  One star only for their cheesecakes!"
Maysa H.,"Belmont, CA",31,12,16,5.0,5/7/2016,"I love this place and a love their food, I keep coming here to have their amazing cheese cake collection. Although the waiting time can be as long as an hour sometimes but it is definitely worth the wait"
Joy L.,"San Jose, CA",41,197,53,4.0,12/9/2015,"I went here on a Sunday for my friend's birthday where there were a total of 9 people.  First and foremost, the floor is extremely slippery!  I went to the bathroom and there was a lady who was experiencing the same thing as me where we both were walking slow because the texture of the floor when we step on the tiles makes us feel like we're about to slip.  We bonded over that and she said there's a lawsuit waiting to happen which I totally agree with her.  The management and the executives have to look into this matter because it's serious... Someone can get injure badly. The food was good, let alone I was extremely hungry and hungover from the day before because of a company's Christmas party.  I had ordered the miso salmon and I devoured everything on my plate.  My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya and he felt like it wasn't a jambalaya dish, it was merely pasta or spaghetti dish with shrimps only.  I also got a cheesecake from there and it was called Adams peanut butter cheesecake and it was delicious.  I just got off of work and I'm hungry just talking about the food.  Wish I was there now!  I'll be back... But seriously... They should do something about the texture of the floor!  It's not safe!"
Betty L.,"Cupertino, CA",75,2,2,1.0,5/17/2017,"used to love this restaurant , but because a server name Lidia , my family and I will not go to this restaurant anymore !! She have a really bad attitude and no responsibility ! It was my worst restaurant experience ever !!"
HappyMommy ..,"Fremont, CA",13,71,40,3.0,3/11/2015,"I come to this location a lot. Especially after shopping at Valley Fair mall. The night we decided to come here, we sat at the bar location because we didn't feel like waiting for a table. FYI, it's always packed and they do not take reservations. I love their big sizes and ""healthy menu"". I always order the chicken samosas and the Greek salad as my starters.  It usually doesn't fill me up so I also order  a main dish.  I only go for their main dishes and not the cheesecakes because by the time we are done eating, no room for cheesecake! LOL So, back to this one evening. I ordered the meat loaf ( I LOVE meat loaf lol it's my comfort food)  and halfway while I am enjoying.. there was a piece of long dark hair buried in the meat :( I was praying it was mine but it couldn't be. Especially if it was buried deep in the meat. We notified our server and she was really sweet about it. She then told the manager on duty. He came to our table and apologized. Asked if we wanted to replace it or get a dessert on the house. I refused to both because it wasn't about the freebee. They did take it off the bill though. They always have great service. Unfortunately, someone's hair in the kitchen decided to come say hello. Hey! At least it wasn't a piece of nail :) Anyway, it took me a while to get over that hair incident. I did return a few months later because hey I love food !"
Jill H.,"Mountain View, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/18/2017,Worst Cheesecake Factory ! They only care about mass producing food and churning people in and out.
Sonya A.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,3.0,11/7/2015,"Worst wait time ever. No doubt the food and environment is great. However, the system they currently have in taking names and wait time is beyond ridiculous. The most inconvenient part, is that they do not take reservations on weekends. Weekends are the busiest times. Especially for large party events. Tonight, my friend hosted a birthday dinner. Because they do not take reservations, we had to wait close to two hours to be seated. Mind you, we all arrived at 6:00PM. We were not seated until 8:45PM. We were a party of 13. If they would just allow people to make reservations, this ridiculous wait time and terrible experience would not be happening. My friends and I were not happy with the rude treatment given when we were trying to ask about our table.  Bottom line is, this place is great in every other aspect except in respect for their customer's time. Please please implement a new system, allow customers to make reservations and all will be solved."
Monica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2357,1171,1522,3.0,8/25/2013,"3.5 stars, bordering 4 I've been coming here since I was a little girl still in school...now I'm old and decrepit and I STILL go here! Not as often, especially since I've moved away from the area, but  the food is pretty solid as most Cheesecake Factories are. The salads are giant, and portion sizes are crazy. Taste, however, is not ""WOW AMAZING"", but nor is it ""BLECH!"" It's a ""pretty good, but I've had better and this is forgettable"" sorta deal. Service ranges from ""eek!"" to ""wow this person is amazing!"", with most of my experiences being good. Cheesecakes are a must, as this is THE cheesecake factory! Very rich, decadent, and hell on the arteries, but almost all the cheesecakes are divine. My personal favorite is the classic vanilla bean, but you can't go wrong with Oreo or chocolate tuxedo.  Be warned of constant huge lines and hordes of people waiting for a table though...I think that's the worst part of the experience, and the food does take a bit to come out, so be prepared. Luckily, bread IS offered in case you are starving!"
Ananta S.,"Santa Clara, CA",45,33,144,5.0,9/3/2015,The cheesecakes at the Cheesecake Factory are to die for. Ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake yesterday night - it's a three layered chocolate cake with cream on the sides. A must try for all those chocolate lovers out there!  I ordered the Fried Mac n Cheese as an entree. The dish is listed as a side on their menu. Sinfully - the dish apparently has over 1.3K calories. Haha. For 4 round mac n cheese balls. Amazing though - the best mac n cheese I've ever tried. We also ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken. Amazing as well. The service at the restaurant (think Andrew was our server) was very good as well.
James A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,11,,1.0,2/14/2017,"I  only have myself to blame for coming to this place.   The food is thrown together with little to no care, the staff isn't concerned with wait times or service., and the management is even less concerned than the staff.  Waited an hour to be seated, ordered and 2 hours later was told it would be another hour to get our food.  This  is not the first time I received poor service from servers and managers at this store, but I know ever place as off days and gave it another try.    Needless to say we left and will not return, and if I could give this place a negative rating I absolutely would.   Avoid this place at all costs."
Nitin A.,"San Jose, CA",84,49,63,2.0,8/14/2016,"Am a regular at Cheesecake Factory and have a few favorites here. Ordered them last evening and one of them dish turned out great and the other was below par compared to the usual experience. Right from ordering the food to giving feedback about the food - the service was much much below par compared to what is norm at Cheesecake Factory. The waiter was least interested, sighed profusely and made it clear that he was annoyed when we mentioned about the undercooked pasta. He then went inside, tasted it and apologized for the good, but of course with a very irritated face. It seemed like he was super busy with tons of other things and was glad to be out of our way. Noticed his service at next table wasn't any different compared to ours. The food was redone and was good. 4 stars for food, 1 for service."
Jennee L.,"San Jose, CA",2,13,100,5.0,9/2/2015,"I think tonight's dinner in itself deserves a 5. I never rated Cheesecake Factory even after dining there since like junior high. Everything was pretty good, alright, bland, or just plain super sucky.   Tried the Miso Salmon from the bf and I always wanted to try that. DELICIOUS!  My Chicken Bellagio was exactly the taste I wanted.  Savory, breaded juicy chicken, a salty and chewy bite of prosciutto, lemony hint of the arugula, and basil pasta.  Plus was our server was awesome. Professional and knew the menu well with great service.  lemme find his name... Richard. Omg Cheesecake Factory has redeemed itself with my last few times being a disappointment."
Deb K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,,1.0,2/11/2017,My husband and I have been to Numerous Cheesecake Factory and Grand Luxe restaurants throughout the US as they are one of our favorite restaurants. We recently moved to San Jose CA and  went to the restaurant at Westfield Mall on Steven's Creek Rd.  It was so disappointing. We waited over 45 mins for our food so we had to take it to go. My husband ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich which had no tomato sauce on it and the waiter said the fries weren't ready.  We thought we would give the restaurant another try using their curbside service.  Again we ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich and another entree. When we arrived at the curbside parking I called their number which rang for 5 mins and I was then transferred to the bakery and held for 4 mins and was hung up on. My husband then went inside and waited in line for our order.  And yet again- no sauce on the sandwich. He then talked to the manager who simply said - sorry.  The service here is horrible and I would really discourage anyone from going to this particular location.  They truly create a horrible experience for this otherwise very reputable restaurant brand.
mary d.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,14,,1.0,10/24/2016,"I can't say enough bad things about this place! My company orders lunch every week and has for many years. We have ordered from The Cheesecake Factory far more times than we ever should have and EVERY time it's extremely late and a food item is either missing, incorrect or not there. It's a joke! We only order for 10 people and they consistently disappoint us. If we call and ask what happened, we are treated like garbage and if we complain it's as if we criticized their first born. I'm appalled at the food quality, service, timeliness and managerial professionalism.  There are too many good places for lunch we can use that's cheaper than this place too.  We won't ever use them again and I recommend everyone follow suit."
chris w.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Never comeing here again. Service was super slow. I understand it was a sunday and busy but still. We didnt get our bread until our food came out and at that point who even wants the damn bread? Then i end up leaving my debit card in the bill holder thing by accident and leave the restraunt. I call and they cant locate the manager and suggest i call back later or come back. I come back and the manager is basiclly no help, says they havent seen my card..makes me wait so she can ask the other manager and completey forgets i was there smh. So i had to grab her attention and remind her and she says they havent found my card and Tells me to call before they close. I call 30mins before they close, somebody answers and i ask if they found my card. they put me on hold for over 20mins so i just hang up. Probably just gotta order a new card to avoid going out of my way back there. ..horrible management and service all the way around skip this place and go to a diff location or a better restraunt."
Tamika V.,"San Jose, CA",97,15,34,4.0,6/15/2015,"I wish that I could break up my review into different status'.  Ideally a four star would be for my delicious miso salmon and rice and three stars for the help.  It is not helpful in a customer service environment when the serving staff projects their frustrations and feeling of being overwhelmed onto the guest of that establishment.  I'll chalk that up to a lack of training and lack of employees.  Needless to say, where they lack in people skills they make up with my salmon. The menu is overwhelming and can confuse a straving person with the various choices. So to keep life simple I stick with what I know.  And I know that the miso salmon is DeLICIouS!!!"
Sarah R.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,1.0,2/8/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, however my 17 year old daughter left her wallet in the booth and we live 5 hours away, and didn't discover we had left the wallet until we were home. After 4 attempts to get the wallet they found returned, we were told they don't mail wallets and they would shred her items... Including the cash and Social Security Card, in her wallet. This is terrible customer service, after all we spend a lot of money eating at Cheesecake Factory's all over Nevada and California. I am very disappointed in their policies, and will not return."
Bori G.,"San Jose, CA",227,21,1,5.0,11/21/2015,"THE PASTA IS SO GOOD I WANNA THROW UP AND EAT IT AGAIN! Specifically the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish. I forgot who, but a friend or acquaintance recommended it to me year and years ago and I've been getting it ever since. It's got a nice hint of spice and the chicken that it comes with is lightly breaded, so your taste buds do not get clogged with all of that flavor stealing breading thievery.  Before that I would get the Chicken Littles which come with mashed potatoes and corn and I remember that being lovely as well.  I'm always way too full for cheesecake because the dishes are the size of 49 Volkswagen Beetles, but I have had a few of them in my lifetime and they were DELICIOUS.  Oh and that FREE BROWN BREAD they serve you while you wait for your meal is extremely tasty. They run out sometimes on the weekends though, so if they don't have it tell them BORIS said ""you already know you are gonna run out so MAKE MORE... NOW!"" IN CONCLUSION: A simple YES!"

I forgot who, but a friend or acquaintance recommended it to me year and years ago and I've been getting it ever since. It's got a nice hint of spice and the chicken that it comes with is lightly breaded, so your taste buds do not get clogged with all of that flavor stealing breading thievery.  Before that I would get the Chicken Littles which come with mashed potatoes and corn and I remember that being lovely as well.  I'm always way too full for cheesecake because the dishes are the size of 49 Volkswagen Beetles, but I have had a few of them in my lifetime and they were DELICIOUS.  Oh and that FREE BROWN BREAD they serve you while you wait for your meal is extremely tasty. They run out sometimes on the weekends though, so if they don't have it tell them BORIS said ""you already know you are gonna run out so MAKE MORE... NOW!"" IN CONCLUSION: A simple YES!"
