Cathy L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/14/2017,"I'll never come back. I'm actually writing this review as I wait for my food...we've been here for well over an hour (of sitting)...after a 2 hour wait before even having been sat down! That makes a totally of 3 hours & still without entrees.  If it were not for the fact that my children and nieces have their hearts set on eating here, I would have left after they missed their originally committed wait time of 1.5 hrs. My advice: if you're looking to get in & out, don't ever come here. Servers were good though; seems like they're trying their best but all servers and front hostesses could use some additional help and much needed training in customer service. Btw, my food just arrived: cold!? Wtf? Just don't ever come here. Disappointing."
Abdul S.,"Union City, CA",1,6,2,5.0,11/8/2016,David Woo such a great guy nice personality.. delicious food I really liked the service
Maneet G.,"San Jose, CA",257,256,454,4.0,12/17/2013,"My students took me out to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday. I've seen this restaurant so many times when I'm near Valley Fair but haven't tried it. I'm so glad that I did! I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and requested them to add vegetables into the pasta. When my dish arrived, it looked amazing! There were tons of delicious veggies in my dish! They put broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, and mushrooms. It tasted divine and had the right amount of alfredo without it being overly salty or rich. I think this has to be the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever eaten! Yum!  For dessert, we ordered the strawberry cheesecake and the oreo cookie cheesecake. The strawberry one was great, but the oreo cookie one was a little too rich for my palette. Perfect for kids though! Anyways, I would definitely come here again. :)"
Aarize D.,"Santa Clara, CA",822,381,841,3.0,9/25/2014,"My friends and I come here at least every 2 or 3 months to play catch ups. If I'm in the mood for some pasta I usually get the Spicy Chipotle Pasta with Chicken or the Pasta Carbonara with chicken or shrimp or both. If I'm in the mood for anything that sounds delicious in my book, I usually just get it and so far it hasn't disappointed me at all. I love their cheesecakes especially the smore's one - I forgot the exact name of the cheesecake but the chocolate was super decadent and rich! Their dinner portion is a bit too big but I usually just have it as leftover for my lunch at work if I'm lazy to grab food or make my own lunch and plus, I gotta get my moneys worth for my big portion left over, right? The wait here will have to vary because of course if you come on a Friday-Weekend night, the wait will always be long since everyone is on their dinner dates and someone will always have a big party for their birthday celebrations. Other than those days mentioned, the wait is always 15 minutes for a table for 2 or sometimes 4 as well; bigger parties will have to wait a little but not too long."
Monica F.,"San Jose, CA",7,18,4,2.0,10/23/2016,"The wait was forever. After 40 minutes or more they brought my son's ""Alfredo Pasta"" that was more like a butter only pasta. And our food came 20 minutes after that. So like an hour after we got the drinks. NO FOOD is with that wait."
Maria G.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,5,4,2.0,5/16/2017,i love cheescake and been at least in 6 diffrenet locations/ BUT this location the WORST waiting for the food in the middle of the day when the resturant empty took about 30 min and when its arrived its was cold i really reccomand to drive 15 min more and go to the one in oakridge mall/
Jena Y.,"San Jose, CA",386,6,9,4.0,11/27/2015,"Came here for a family outing and as always, the Steak Diane didn't fail to please me! The combo entree is also extremely filling, and overall I think their amount per entree is pretty decent! The restaurant's Meatball & Spaghetti was a classic and it was nearly unstoppable."
Jeani S.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",24,24,,2.0,7/30/2016,Still can't get this out of my mind. Thursday night I took my granddaughter to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her birthday during her week long visit from her home in Florida.  She loves The Cheesecake Factory so we didn't mind waiting for a table.  My granddaughter loves fish but does not care for salmon.  The waitress told her that they had swordfish with a lemon caper sauce (which just happens to be my granddaughter's favorite fish!); so of course that's what she ordered.  When the plate was delivered it was SALMON.  The waitress said she'd have her order fixed. By the time her plate was delivered my meal was cold and my hungry granddaughter had filled up on bread. The crowning disappointment?  At the end of the meal the waitress informed me that the manager had comped the incorrect order so I wouldn't be charged for both fish orders.
Mia M.,"Seaside, CA",1,4,,1.0,4/9/2017,"Where do I begin to explain this horrible experience. I came here for dinner on Sunday around 6ish. I totally understand that this is a very popular place and it does get busy. It took more time to receive our food than it took to get a table. Our waitress was just horrible. I will not name her because that is very embarrassing. She was more attentive with the table besides us and doing who knows what. When she would check on us she walked away so quick we'd still be taking to her and would have the audacity to leave in mid sentence while we were talking.  The food oh my. HORRIBLE. My fiancé had the fettuccini Alfredo pasta. We drove nearly two hours for it because that is the only pasta he likes and for it be uncooked and hard was just disappointing. By the time we even saw our waitress it was just too late to say anything about the food. I had the pasta de Vinci and that was uncooked too. This restaurant is a very well known place. Multibillion corporation, you'd think they'd give they're chefs some cooking lessons. Uncooked pasta can make one very sick. Food and service was horrible. Took us nearly an hour just to get the check and another hour just so she can pick up the check. It died down around 8:30 and we were still receiving bad service. Hope you guys retrain the servers. Oh and hopefully you do something about your floors too. They're really slippery and someone can get very hurt."
Michelle C.,"San Francisco, CA",350,155,422,3.0,2/28/2014,"Be prepared to wait if you choose to dine here! Came around 7:30 and did not get seated until almost 9pm, which goes to show just how popular this restaurant is. I don't mind waiting but what I do mind is waiting extra unnecessarily because they had made a mistake and thought we were a party of 2 when we clearly said 4.... My family ordered: The Calamari appetizer - just like any calamari appetizer you will get Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - Didn't really eat too much of this one Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo - Wouldn't recommend, I've had better Gumbo & the rice was hard Louisiana Chicken Pasta - Always a Good choice of pasta Steak Diane - It was good. I know on the menu it says it has black peppercorn on it but it was too much pepper for me And for Dessert: Red Velvet Cheesecake - Delicious!  Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Too rich, thick, and made me want to drink water after every bite; definitely on the lower end of my list of cheesecake choices. I've been to Cheesecake several times and have ordered other dishes as well - Overall a very consistent restaurant. Tip: Usually I'm too full to order dessert but if I plan to attempt to get a Cheesecake for dessert, I usually only eat half of my entree. The serving sizes are huge and how can you not get Cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Michelle A.,"Fremont, CA",0,12,1,4.0,4/20/2017,This place has changed a lot since my last review. The service and food has gotten so much better within the last year. Definitely recommending this location.
Julius W.,"Oakland, CA",46,4,3,1.0,3/25/2017,"I'll start by saying, I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory, but today's experience was UNACCEPTABLE and borderline insulting! My wife and I were heading home to the East Bay, but decided to stop at this location to grab dinner on our way home. We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY seated in the back right next to the restrooms, even though we walked past an ENTIRE open section in the front where NO ONE was seated. (We continued to watch as customers of color continued to be led to the back of the restaurant.) Why is that? After ordering apps, it took over 20 minutes for my app to arrive. (My app was an order of spring rolls). Why did it take 20 minutes for it to come out? Then, it took a while longer before our food came out. Our waitress kept telling us, ""It's on the way"", but I assume it was just words as nothing came out. Once our food finally arrived, my food was good, but my wife's order was WRONG! She ordered grilled fish tacos, but fried fish tacos came out instead. Again, the waitress told us, ""We'll fix it right away and bring it out to you."" 20 minutes passed by and NO TACOS. My wife went to get the manager and we explained to him what happened. He gave a half apology, but offered nothing for our inconvenience and lack of quality service. I used to work in a restaurant and when I messed up, I offered a comp. bill, dessert, a sincere apology, and I made sure to follow up with the customer. Guess what??! Those customers always came back and I treated them like VIP customers when they came in. The manager here seemed to not really care about our dinner experience. If that's the case, let me know and I'll get up and walk out. The staff today did not meet our expectations in any way and because of that, we will NEVER eat at this location again. To me, it seems like customers of color aren't valued. I hope I'm wrong, but as I tell my kindergarten students, ""Your actions always speak louder than words."" Before driving back home, my wife and I stopped by Pleasant Hill and grabbed her an EXCELLENT burger from Moana's. Thanks to them, she had an enjoyable meal! If you're thinking about eating at this location, please read the reviews first. If I did, it would have saved us a lot of trouble! From here on out, we'll stick to The Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek or Corte Madera. They know how to treat ALL customers with respect!!!"
Ditty V.,"Boston, MA",19,2,,1.0,7/25/2016,"Never eat that bad in a cheesecake factory. For starters the restrooms are that dirty, i cannot discribe, wet on the floors, toiletpaper everywhere and the dustbins were overflowing. I mentioned it but one and a half hour later there was no change, now they were also out of toiletpaper! The food:  it took a very long time to get served and wasn't all that good the croutons were old and chewey the nachos were chewey and fat one of the entrees came more than 10 minutes after the other ones the cheesecake was half frozen! Never come back here again!"
Amla Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,1,2.0,10/3/2016,"While I use to once love the taste of the food, it has significantly declined in taste and quality. I thought last time, it was by happenstance, but this time- I'm convinced something has changed. The food was horrible. The server-Teaneah-kind, sweet, and exuded excellent customer service. Next time, we'll be going across the street and eating at Yard House and hopefully we'll have a server as kind as her to compliment the taste of the food. Thank you Teaneah, for mitigating the bad food with your gracious smile and sweet service."
Jenna H.,"Campbell, CA",2,28,11,5.0,10/2/2016,"Came here tonight and was super busy! My boyfriend and I had THE sweetest server, Teaneah. Even though our food was a long wait due to how many people were there, Teaneah kept us updated and offered us more fresh bread while we waited. At the end she let us know one of our cheesecakes was taken off the bill for the wait. She was so sweet and attentive, and didn't have to take anything off the bill!  Thank you Teaneah for turning an okay experience into a great one!"
Britnee S.,"Seaside, CA",4,55,33,5.0,6/13/2016,"I ordered TOGO, it was ready at exactly 15 minutes just as they positioned! I had a tricky order as I created my own dish but thankfully they got every detail correct. (SO REFRESHING). I of course ordered my very favorite cheesecake the Adams Peanut Butter and it was fantastic as always! Quite honestly this place always impresses be, so busy but the staff and the restaurant continue to always so a great job! Thank you for the experience!"
Jane Q.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,20,1.0,3/1/2016,"I've been to this specific location many times in the past but this review is about my visit last night. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by at this location to have a couple of drinks and order some salads. We arrived around 8 o'clock on February 29th. We sat at the bar.  Cheesecake factory makes really good Mojitos and just a few days ago I was at this location and ordered one and it was really good but the Mojito that I ordered last night wasn't that well done. My boyfriend ordered double gin and soda and he said it was good.  As for food I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and I can't believe they were OK with serving me that gross tasting salmon. The salmon tasted old and it was cold. It took longer than the usual to have it served to us so I think they might have left it at the counter for a while until they picked it up to serve it.  Also,When I ordered my salad I asked for plate of bread which is the complementary bread that they serve to every customer but every time I stop by they automatically serve it,this time though I had to ask for it twice until I got it and the quality of the bread was pretty much the same as the salmon that I had on my salad, old and cold.  After taking two bites from the salmon I couldn't help but feel so grossed out by it so I pushed my plate to the side and our server asked if I wanted a box for my food and I had to tell him that it didn't taste god at all and the bread did not taste fresh. The server asked if I wanted to order something else off the menu , but worrying that somebody's going to spit in my food I didn't order anything else. It was disappointing and the server, even though he asked if I wanted something else, he didn't seem to care that my experience wasn't pleasant at all. Service wasn't special and food was gross. I don't think that's the general quality that's served here but it definitely wasn't good quality last night."
Amy T.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,3,3,3.0,4/14/2017,"This used to be my favorite place and now I avoid going there. Such a bummer. My boyfriend and I went for happy hour one weekday. It was pretty empty in the place, but our food took over an hour. We ended up leaving before our food arrived. We tried giving the place a second chance and were yet again disappointed. We were ignored by the waiter. Then I ordered a burger which the waiter brought out 40+ minutes later without the fries! Then told me the fries were on their way. First off, you don't bring an incomplete plate out. Second, the fries didn't end up coming out till 20 minutes later when I was basically done with my burger. So disappointed in the downfall of my favorite restaurant."
Melissa A.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,7,2.0,4/27/2017,"The last 3 times I have been there have been horrible.  They gave me normal pasta when I asked for gluten free, they burned my burger and they also gave me cold eggs.  Never going back..."
Cramer B.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,22,35,3.0,5/25/2016,Had lunch here and ordered drinks appetizers and entrees the drinks were good the appetizer had a hair in it which was quickly switched out when I told the waiter and a new app was brought my wife's burger was not well done more medium which she didn't order by the time her food came back out we took it to go overall i might give this place a second chance but not this location
