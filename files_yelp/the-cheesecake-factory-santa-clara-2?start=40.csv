Karen M.,"San Jose, CA",5,3,12,5.0,12/15/2017,We had our Christmas Lunch here and I Love Love my food!!!  Amazing customer service even during busy times! Thanks Leslie!!!
Katrina C.,"San Jose, CA",242,282,285,3.0,3/18/2017,"What happened, Cheesecake Factory?? You used to be a 4 back in the day, but you're now just a solid 3.  My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30pm. First thing I noticed when I sat down was that my knife had some crap on it. Ick.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, so we were able to get seated right away. But for not being so busy, we waited a long time for service in general. It took a while for our server to introduce herself and get our drinks. It then took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out, which is not Jon Taffer approved! Our waitress was nice and friendly though.  The food at the Cheesecake Factory tasted good but was far off what I expected. We ordered, for instance, the Nashville hot chicken nuggets. They were definitely no Hattie B's hot chicken from Nashville. I didn't think they tasted anything like Nashville hot chicken at all actually. Nashville hot chicken is also drenched in the sauce. Cheesecake Factory has the sauce only on one side of the nuggets. For what they were, however, the nuggets were yummy. The Shepherd's pie, which was my entree, was good but didn't exactly taste like a shepherd's pie to me. It was so saucy, and the beef sauce was very thick. I did like my boyfriend's jambalaya, but the cajun flavor doesn't pack in boldness."
Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",429,506,2328,3.0,2/5/2017,"I know Cheesecake Factory always gets mediocre reviews but for some reason I keep coming back. It's not like the food is phenomenal, but it's oddly comforting. I came to this specific location for my birthday with my significant other. It was a Friday night and crazy busy as you would expect. They told us it would be about 25 minutes for a booth to open up. We waited like the rest of the crowd. Once our buzzer started ringing, we were seated. If you didn't already know, Cheesecake Factory has a huge, huge menu. Furthermore, their portion sizing here is no joke. Appetizers are the size of full entrees and entrees could probably  feed two mouths. Since it was my birthday, we decide to do a bit of splurging. We wanted the tuna carpaccio but they were unfortunately out of tuna for the night. We decided to go with the buffalo blasts and the calamari to start.  The buffalo blasts are really interesting. I have never had anything like it and it's pretty hard to describe. They are deep fried to the point where they almost taste like fried chicken on the outside. They are inside what seems like a wonton wrapper and the inside is a buffalo chicken, cheese mix. It's soft and squishy on the inside but extra crunchy on the outside. It comes with blue cheese dip but my s/o and I thought ranch would be better so we kindly asked our server for some.  The calamari is pretty standard. I think there is so much breading on the calamari that you can barely taste the seafood. Thankfully, the outside is pretty crunchy. Some places don't know how to make calamari crunchy on the outside so it ends up being squishy.  We wanted to take leftovers home so ended up ordering two entree sized pastas (way too much food). I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta while my s/o chose the jambalaya cajun pasta. I actually really like the Louisiana chicken pasta. The bow tie pasta is smothered in creamy sauce and the chicken is breaded thinly. It was my first time trying the jambalaya cajun pasta and it was underwhelming. I actually think it had barely any flavor at all. The sauce was pretty tasteless unless your bite had a bit of the sausage, shrimp and veggies. I personally just didn't really like this one. It didn't even gain any more flavor after sitting in the fridge overnight (which you would think would allow the flavors to sit some more). I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake to-go because there was no way we would be able to fill our stomach anymore. This cheesecake is a mix of fudge cake and original cheesecake in one piece. It was the perfect thing for me because I wanted cake for my birthday, but also was craving cheesecake. It's super rich and indulgent of course, but that's my kind of treat! The server came over with a couple other servers and sang me Happy Birthday and had other tables join in. I never told my server how old I was turning, but he thought I was turning 21. I guess this birthday I lost years in my age! None the less, I appreciated that they came and sang for me and gave a complimentary mousse type thing with a candle even though it was so, so busy. Because it was so busy, service was a bit slow but we were still checked up on here and there and had our needs met.  Overall - not bad. I still enjoy coming here with my s/o to indulge and of course, get dessert."
Jenny O.,"San Jose, CA",250,211,975,3.0,3/7/2017,"Haven't been to this place in a while but since I had a gift card and a free slice of cheesecake, I decided to drop by. I love the cheesecakes here and I am always satisfied with whatever slice I decide to go with.  The lunch specials are not bad for the price ($13-$16) for a large plate of food, but the regular menu items are pretty expensive for what it is. I finally tried the much so raved about miso salmon and everyone's right - it IS delicious! The salmon wasn't overcooked and the hoisin-like sauce was delicious. I made sure to soak up every last drop with my jasmine rice. But for a $20+ dish I expect more than 5 snap peas please! And of course, I gotta have my brown bread. That sh*t is crack and I can eat loaves at a time!! I asked for some on the way out and the waiter said they were out of the brown bread. I know I was being shady for trying to take some to go, but how dare they lie to me especially since another waiter just brought some out to the table next to us. Guess the shader (me) got shaded, lol. Gripe: There's literally nowhere to park right now and it's $4 valet parking with validation - $25 without (ridiculous). And of course, there is ALWAYS a wait. It was about a 20+ minute wait for 2 on Saturday at 3PM - I can't imagine going with a larger group. Service is mediocre and is slow per usual. Good thing we weren't in a rush or too hangry!"
Sandeep P.,"San Jose, CA",44,132,33,4.0,1/2/2018,"As usual, excellent food especially the TexMex and Avacado Egg Rolls, Chicken Wings, and Jamaican Spicy Shrimp. But always crowded and you need to wait for atleast 45 min. Valet parking needed ($5) but you can easily find free spaces near Chase or even Santana Row parking structures."
Dang L.,"San Jose, CA",8,132,183,2.0,3/12/2017,"We came here on a Friday night. Paid for the valet parking lot because there wasn't anywhere to park. When we got in at 730pm, there was a 40-50 minute wait. I had predicted this would happen, but the hubby had insisted. These two issues wouldn't have bothered me so much as the rest of my experience all cumulated.  We got seated and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to come by. We ordered. He was supposed to come back with drinks. Got the bread. 10 minutes, water and appetizer. Still waiting for the drinks. Waiter said he was going to bring it over. 5minutes later he brought one drink and said he was going to come back with the other drinks. Waited another 15 minutes. Got the food. Still. I drink. Half way through the meal he checked on us. We asked for the drink and they finally bought it. I realize it's busy but still. Now after venting: Mac and cheese ball - 4 stars. Probably the best dish of the night. Although is quite salty, the creamy tomato dish takes it to another level.  Sirloin with mash potatoes and veggies- 2.5. The hubby ordered well done. It came between medium and rare. But too hungry so he ate it anyways but left about 1/3. Because it was too rare for him. Mash potato- standard although on the saltier side.  Clam chowder - 3 stars. Good but nothing outstanding to rave about.  Steak tacos- comes with 3 tacos, beans & rice. Topped with chopped onions, salsa, guacamole and cilantro. Pretty decent but I didn't like the fact that it tasted sweet with a lingering after taste. Will not order again. - should be mostly savory for a taco.  Greek salad- 1 star. Mostly leafy greens with 2 olives and a couple if tomato and cucumber slices. It literally had no taste except the saltiness  of the feta. Had to ask for a dressing - balsamic. Then it was better. I was told they did toss it in a dressing.  Over all the low stars for the service and disappointed food prep. Maybe going on busy hour may not be a good idea. But I've been to 5 different cheese cakes factory throughout California and have eaten here before too. This was the worst one."
Jessica L.,"Fremont, CA",489,61,72,4.0,8/21/2017,"This past time I went to the Cheesecake Factory, I actually really enjoyed almost everything that we ordered! Top choices: - strawberry cheesecake  - farfalle pasta  - Thai chicken wraps (an appetizer)  These items were incredible! We also ordered spinach artichoke dip, buffalo wings, and oreo cheesecake, but these weren't as standout."
Anthony G.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,52,,5.0,11/4/2017,"Here is a restaurant that never disappoints. Nice and open environment, big portions, excellent service and decent prices. The last time we went we ordered clam chowder, caesar salad and fish and chips. The previous visit we had orange chicken and burger. All of them were very tasty. Let's don't forget the delicious cheesecake. If you are lucky you may see someone that has personality as well. That's an extra bonus in this area. I have understanding for all those that write 10 paragraphs or more for a meal, but I am not there. GLUTTONY IS NOT A VIRTUE."
Alberto V.,"Salinas, CA",6,116,149,4.0,9/12/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory... The place is upscale, the food is fancy, the cheesecake portions are huge! Depending on when you come in will determine how long of a wait you'll have for a table. Normally weekends are the busiest. Obviously! Expect to wait anywhere from 30-40 min to be seated. Once seated the waiters are always kind and friendly. I've yet to have a rude waiter here. In my opinion the food is delicious and very well presented. Pricing is a bit up there but portion wise you do get what you pay for. Their cocktails are packed with flavor and not overly strong. For me this is a good thing. Cheesecake! Hello! You can't leave the Cheesecake Factory without a piece of cake. Even if you're full I highly recommend taking a slice home. A plus is coming here for your birthday. My girlfriend loves it when they come with her cheesecake decorated with HBD and a candle. A simple gesture goes a long way. Oh, and by the way if you don't want the signing simply ask your waiter not to bring the staff and make a scene. Otherwise be like my girl and ask if the entire restaurant can sing you happy birthday. lol...  Lastly; I docked a star because parking is always complicated even with the valet service. Secondly because I hate; I mean HATE! when they seat us in what I like to call the couple tables. I'm literally within arms length of the people next to me. Talk about no privacy."
Jana E.,"Hayward, CA",46,24,37,1.0,12/29/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times. But today is a different story. I'm writing this review because of the horrible horrible service that my family and I received today. Our server was SLOANE.. she needs a bit more training on how to serve her customers. I don't want to put her on blast like that but it's seriously needs to be done. Because the service we received was so bad that I am absolutely upset.  First of all, she NEVER checked up on us. Second, she forgot to give us whatever it was that we asked for. For example I asked for a new plate because it was dirty and had crumbs all over it. She NEVER came back with a plate.. and by the time I reminded her, our appetizers were finish. Well, what's the point. Ok so she MIGHT have been busy. But not really because there was empty tables. Well we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Ok well then when we asked for straws for the whole table, she completely forgot... AGAIN! I tell you, I'm not sure what it was but either she didn't like us? I'm not sure what the case was. Third, everyone in our section who sat AFTER us got their food BEFORE US. We ordered a turkey BLT, fish tacos and a miso salmon. I don't think it's that much. And a big party was eating way before us. And she was their server as well. It took about 35-40 minutes from when we ordered (we ordered right when we sat down because we were looking at the menu while waiting to be seated) to get our food. And in those 35-40 minutes she forgot about giving us our plate and straws and never checked up on us. The only thing she did for us right away was giving us our check when we asked for it. It was in less than 1 minute she came back with our check. Figures...  -- btw I'm not trying to say cheesecake servers are horrible because we seen the wonderful service other tables were getting. Just not us for some odd reason.  Anyway Sloane or management if you're reading this it's quite upsetting to see how this is such a great restaurant but it seems that some staff possibly favors other tables more. (PS; I've come to this locations plenty of times and never ever had a problem with our servers. But this is concerning and I do plan on contacting management and headquarters.)"
S L.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,30,,3.0,1/9/2018,It is your usual American restaurant. The portions are big like their menu. I always have a hard time selecting what to order. The bread is different from other places. One day hope to make it for their happy hour. Getting cheese cake to go is always good as they do a good job in packaging it and is easy to take with you.
Amber M.,"San Jose, CA",0,36,24,3.0,11/27/2017,"I have to say the customer service is great here and I've always loved the Cobb salad with extra balsamic vinegarett dressing. But today not so much, the salad came with what mush have been half a head of cabbage. Which I've never ever had on my Cobb salad non is it listed on the menu. Then I also got a jar of dressing which is normal for me to have salad the next 2 days. Welp looks like this is nothing like I get. It's so thin it's not even sticking to the lettuce. It's like water consistency. Worst 25 bucks I've spent. Very disappointed because I really was looking forward to this."
W Y.,"Folsom, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Horrible service. Ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go, server guys had my order ready sitting on the counter but the cashier guys just wouldn't put in a bag for me for 10 minutes. Instead, cashier guys just kept taking new orders and let the queue of ready orders fill up the entire counter because no one was serving them. When the cashier guy finally put my slices in a bag, he put them in SIDEWAYS and asked me to hold the bag sideways. WHY GIVE ME A BAG if I have to hold it sideways and cannot use the handle?"
Brett S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",2,78,7,4.0,11/11/2017,The two hour wait scared us away...can I  invest in this place? But we got cheesecake to go and the Godiva chocolate was great and this marshmallow chocolate was also heavenly. I guess it was a little heavy...how stupid a comment is that? It's chocolate cheesecake; how could it not be heavy? But it had a more silky smooth look.
Heidi P.,"Irvine, CA",15,97,18,4.0,8/11/2017,"Man, I remember when this place first opened and the wait was like 3 hours. More recently, group of 4 had to wait near 40 minutes but this was during a late dinner rush on a weekend so not too miffed. Food was wonderful as always--consistent! Large portions, nothing surprising. Service was fast and friendly. Currently there is work being done to build the new parking structure. I'm not sure about the morning, but if you stay late enough when the mall closes, there's a free 'shuttle' (hired by Cheesecake Factory) to deliver guests to wherever they parked--asked valet how to get to my parking spot (other side of closed mall) and they told me about the shuttle which delivered me RIGHT to my car on the 2nd floor!"
Jeanne P.,"Mountain View, CA",63,124,529,4.0,3/6/2017,"First time at this location. Came here on the night of my birthday and waited around 1 hour to get seated. Unfortunately, we got one of the worst tables. It was a table meant for 4 and it was only the two of us. Not to mention, the bright lighting of that table placed us in a spotlight.  The food itself took around 30 minutes or more. The waiter David was friendly. He gave us automatic refills. He also conveniently offered the cheesecake menu to us after our meal.  I ordered my favorite Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken. The chicken breasts were a little more well-done than usual. However, the experience here was the same as any other Cheesecake Factory visit."
Michael L.,"San Jose, CA",349,14,20,4.0,12/27/2017,"10/10, our server slaughtered me with spicy and edgy roasts. Food was okay. 4 stars because of the server :) If you like gambling, I would recommend the chicken taquitos, they either come out golden brown, crispy on the outside, succulent chicken on the inside; or burnt to a crisp and chicken dry as a flip flop. The shrimp scampi is also pretty tasty, but you dont get a lot of shrimp :/"
Mehrnaz H.,"Cupertino, CA",55,355,524,4.0,1/22/2017,"When at a loss of where to eat and we need to shop at Valley Fair, Cheesecake Factory is our go to place. They are always packed, but reliable service, a good selection of appetizers, entree and drinks not to mention their awesome cheesecake selection. I always try their salads and was so happy to see new kale salads on the menu. We split the nachos appetizer amongst the three of us which was so large that did not leave too much space for the entree. Small kale salad was plenty for entree and the server was great not to push a full size salad. We also had the chicken Cesar and bang bang chicken in our party and they were both very tasty. Bang bang chicken was not the traditional flavor that we are used to but was still good.  We always walk out with to go bag from Cheesecake Factory due to their large portions. Atmosphere is always great and has the buzz specially when there is a game on TV, the place is always full and comfortable to dine at."
Stephen C.,"Campbell, CA",343,264,1063,1.0,12/11/2016,"Did not have a good dining experience at Cheesecake. This dinner took place December 10th, beginning at 6:45pm. We had a party of 5 people. It was a 45 min wait. It was fine. We understood. Saturday night. it was poppin. When we got to the front desk... we missed our window to grab the table by 5 mins. They put us back into the queue. Told us we had to wait another 20mins. After a while we  go up to the counter to check if we were up next. They said they already called our name when we were literally standing in front of the host/hostess desk. We continue to wait 10+ mins before we get seated.  Putting aside the long wait..it was time to order. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich. After a long ass time... the food begins to come out. They hand me a crispy chicken sandwich...and i say nope. i didnt order this. As any consumer, you just immediately realize that if this is the sandwich that made for you... they are going to have to start from scratch and make it again. It's going to take forever. But again... things happen... so as the others eat... I wait for my sandwich to come. What's odd is that I understood why i had not gotten my food. But my friend who ordered a Cuban sandwich ALSO hadn't gotten his food neither. With no explanation to WHY he hadn't gotten his food.. we were both left waiting. My food finally comes out after another 20 mins. It's now 8:30. My crispy shrimp sandwich arrives. But WHERE WAS THE CUBAN SANDWICH?! But the best part about it was, WITHOUT any explanation, his sweet potato fries came out without the Cuban sandwich. I guess it was still lagging behind LOL. It was 8:40pm when the sandwich finally decided to come out. 3 other people at the table had finished their meals when we took our first bite.  I was waiting to the end of the meal before I started to rating this meal to see if the waiter or the manager or anyone working at cheesecake was going to do anything for our inconvenience. I understand mistake happens. I understand when it gets busy... people get flustered and even drop the ball from time to time. And that is perfectly okay. It is ALWAYS about how you treat the customer and making a bad situation into a better one. But NOPE... NOPE...NOPE...NOPE.  Our waitress said sorry probably like 10 times but that does nothing for our meal. It wasn't completely her fault. It was the entire crew at Cheesecake. I am a huge fan of this place. It is just disappointing that I was looking forward to eating here and this is what we get....  Overall stats: waited over an hour before getting seated. took over an hour to get everyone's food. People already finished eating before the last person got their dish. Where was the manager? Would have been nice if he/she came over to make sure all the customers are satisfied but hey... ""Cheesecake was probably busy"" ""there were probably another issue he/she had to take care of."" Either way... we were left in the dark. Nothing was compensated. For that night, Cheesecake Factory offered a horrible dining experience. Will not return any time soon.  Thanks for reading my rant. This is an honest review."
Kalani S.,"San Jose, CA",2,25,140,4.0,7/1/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a nice place for all occasions. A social events with friends, celebration , family get together, a date and etc. 1) Food: Great continental style food with great selection 2) tastes: Pretty good with the well prepare sauce, seasoning, and the presentation was classic 3) Service: Great personality, ratio of Servers against customers were well stagger, and it seem like the servers is having great time working there 4) Price: Individual budget at average $40. And that is pretty good. 5) Decor: well done with continues to maintain and give it clean 6) Bar: any restaurant with bar and good selection of drinks are always going to be a hit... 7) hours: late hours attract different levels of crowd. Good for business Overall I gave 4 stars and I enjoy coming to this location. Been here more then 10+ times"

Jessica L.,"Fremont, United States",489,61,72,4.0,21/8/2017,"This past time I went to the Cheesecake Factory, I actually really enjoyed almost everything that we ordered! Top choices: - strawberry cheesecake  - farfalle pasta  - Thai chicken wraps (an appetizer)  These items were incredible! We also ordered spinach artichoke dip, buffalo wings, and oreo cheesecake, but these weren't as standout."
Anthony G.,"Los Gatos, United States",0,52,,5.0,4/11/2017,"Here is a restaurant that never disappoints. Nice and open environment, big portions, excellent service and decent prices. The last time we went we ordered clam chowder, caesar salad and fish and chips. The previous visit we had orange chicken and burger. All of them were very tasty. Let's don't forget the delicious cheesecake. If you are lucky you may see someone that has personality as well. That's an extra bonus in this area. I have understanding for all those that write 10 paragraphs or more for a meal, but I am not there. GLUTTONY IS NOT A VIRTUE."
Alberto V.,"Salinas, United States",6,116,149,4.0,12/9/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory... The place is upscale, the food is fancy, the cheesecake portions are huge! Depending on when you come in will determine how long of a wait you'll have for a table. Normally weekends are the busiest. Obviously! Expect to wait anywhere from 30-40 min to be seated. Once seated the waiters are always kind and friendly. I've yet to have a rude waiter here. In my opinion the food is delicious and very well presented. Pricing is a bit up there but portion wise you do get what you pay for. Their cocktails are packed with flavor and not overly strong. For me this is a good thing. Cheesecake! Hello! You can't leave the Cheesecake Factory without a piece of cake. Even if you're full I highly recommend taking a slice home. A plus is coming here for your birthday. My girlfriend loves it when they come with her cheesecake decorated with HBD and a candle. A simple gesture goes a long way. Oh, and by the way if you don't want the signing simply ask your waiter not to bring the staff and make a scene. Otherwise be like my girl and ask if the entire restaurant can sing you happy birthday. lol...  Lastly; I docked a star because parking is always complicated even with the valet service. Secondly because I hate; I mean HATE! when they seat us in what I like to call the couple tables. I'm literally within arms length of the people next to me. Talk about no privacy."
Jana E.,"Hayward, United States",46,24,37,1.0,29/12/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times. But today is a different story. I'm writing this review because of the horrible horrible service that my family and I received today. Our server was SLOANE.. she needs a bit more training on how to serve her customers. I don't want to put her on blast like that but it's seriously needs to be done. Because the service we received was so bad that I am absolutely upset.  First of all, she NEVER checked up on us. Second, she forgot to give us whatever it was that we asked for. For example I asked for a new plate because it was dirty and had crumbs all over it. She NEVER came back with a plate.. and by the time I reminded her, our appetizers were finish. Well, what's the point. Ok so she MIGHT have been busy. But not really because there was empty tables. Well we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Ok well then when we asked for straws for the whole table, she completely forgot... AGAIN! I tell you, I'm not sure what it was but either she didn't like us? I'm not sure what the case was. Third, everyone in our section who sat AFTER us got their food BEFORE US. We ordered a turkey BLT, fish tacos and a miso salmon. I don't think it's that much. And a big party was eating way before us. And she was their server as well. It took about 35-40 minutes from when we ordered (we ordered right when we sat down because we were looking at the menu while waiting to be seated) to get our food. And in those 35-40 minutes she forgot about giving us our plate and straws and never checked up on us. The only thing she did for us right away was giving us our check when we asked for it. It was in less than 1 minute she came back with our check. Figures...  -- btw I'm not trying to say cheesecake servers are horrible because we seen the wonderful service other tables were getting. Just not us for some odd reason.  Anyway Sloane or management if you're reading this it's quite upsetting to see how this is such a great restaurant but it seems that some staff possibly favors other tables more. (PS; I've come to this locations plenty of times and never ever had a problem with our servers. But this is concerning and I do plan on contacting management and headquarters.)"
S L.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,30,,3.0,9/1/2018,It is your usual American restaurant. The portions are big like their menu. I always have a hard time selecting what to order. The bread is different from other places. One day hope to make it for their happy hour. Getting cheese cake to go is always good as they do a good job in packaging it and is easy to take with you.
Amber M.,"San Jose, United States",0,36,24,3.0,27/11/2017,"I have to say the customer service is great here and I've always loved the Cobb salad with extra balsamic vinegarett dressing. But today not so much, the salad came with what mush have been half a head of cabbage. Which I've never ever had on my Cobb salad non is it listed on the menu. Then I also got a jar of dressing which is normal for me to have salad the next 2 days. Welp looks like this is nothing like I get. It's so thin it's not even sticking to the lettuce. It's like water consistency. Worst 25 bucks I've spent. Very disappointed because I really was looking forward to this."
W Y.,"Folsom, United States",0,5,,1.0,30/12/2017,"Horrible service. Ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go, server guys had my order ready sitting on the counter but the cashier guys just wouldn't put in a bag for me for 10 minutes. Instead, cashier guys just kept taking new orders and let the queue of ready orders fill up the entire counter because no one was serving them. When the cashier guy finally put my slices in a bag, he put them in SIDEWAYS and asked me to hold the bag sideways. WHY GIVE ME A BAG if I have to hold it sideways and cannot use the handle?"
Brett S.,"San Luis Obispo, United States",2,78,7,4.0,11/11/2017,The two hour wait scared us away...can I  invest in this place? But we got cheesecake to go and the Godiva chocolate was great and this marshmallow chocolate was also heavenly. I guess it was a little heavy...how stupid a comment is that? It's chocolate cheesecake; how could it not be heavy? But it had a more silky smooth look.
Heidi P.,"Irvine, United States",15,97,18,4.0,11/8/2017,"Man, I remember when this place first opened and the wait was like 3 hours. More recently, group of 4 had to wait near 40 minutes but this was during a late dinner rush on a weekend so not too miffed. Food was wonderful as always--consistent! Large portions, nothing surprising. Service was fast and friendly. Currently there is work being done to build the new parking structure. I'm not sure about the morning, but if you stay late enough when the mall closes, there's a free 'shuttle' (hired by Cheesecake Factory) to deliver guests to wherever they parked--asked valet how to get to my parking spot (other side of closed mall) and they told me about the shuttle which delivered me RIGHT to my car on the 2nd floor!"
Jeanne P.,"Mountain View, United States",64,124,529,4.0,6/3/2017,"First time at this location. Came here on the night of my birthday and waited around 1 hour to get seated. Unfortunately, we got one of the worst tables. It was a table meant for 4 and it was only the two of us. Not to mention, the bright lighting of that table placed us in a spotlight.  The food itself took around 30 minutes or more. The waiter David was friendly. He gave us automatic refills. He also conveniently offered the cheesecake menu to us after our meal.  I ordered my favorite Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken. The chicken breasts were a little more well-done than usual. However, the experience here was the same as any other Cheesecake Factory visit."
Michael L.,"San Jose, United States",349,14,20,4.0,27/12/2017,"10/10, our server slaughtered me with spicy and edgy roasts. Food was okay. 4 stars because of the server :) If you like gambling, I would recommend the chicken taquitos, they either come out golden brown, crispy on the outside, succulent chicken on the inside; or burnt to a crisp and chicken dry as a flip flop. The shrimp scampi is also pretty tasty, but you dont get a lot of shrimp :/"
Mehrnaz H.,"Cupertino, United States",55,355,524,4.0,22/1/2017,"When at a loss of where to eat and we need to shop at Valley Fair, Cheesecake Factory is our go to place. They are always packed, but reliable service, a good selection of appetizers, entree and drinks not to mention their awesome cheesecake selection. I always try their salads and was so happy to see new kale salads on the menu. We split the nachos appetizer amongst the three of us which was so large that did not leave too much space for the entree. Small kale salad was plenty for entree and the server was great not to push a full size salad. We also had the chicken Cesar and bang bang chicken in our party and they were both very tasty. Bang bang chicken was not the traditional flavor that we are used to but was still good.  We always walk out with to go bag from Cheesecake Factory due to their large portions. Atmosphere is always great and has the buzz specially when there is a game on TV, the place is always full and comfortable to dine at."
Stephen C.,"Campbell, United States",343,264,1063,1.0,11/12/2016,"Did not have a good dining experience at Cheesecake. This dinner took place December 10th, beginning at 6:45pm. We had a party of 5 people. It was a 45 min wait. It was fine. We understood. Saturday night. it was poppin. When we got to the front desk... we missed our window to grab the table by 5 mins. They put us back into the queue. Told us we had to wait another 20mins. After a while we  go up to the counter to check if we were up next. They said they already called our name when we were literally standing in front of the host/hostess desk. We continue to wait 10+ mins before we get seated.  Putting aside the long wait..it was time to order. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich. After a long ass time... the food begins to come out. They hand me a crispy chicken sandwich...and i say nope. i didnt order this. As any consumer, you just immediately realize that if this is the sandwich that made for you... they are going to have to start from scratch and make it again. It's going to take forever. But again... things happen... so as the others eat... I wait for my sandwich to come. What's odd is that I understood why i had not gotten my food. But my friend who ordered a Cuban sandwich ALSO hadn't gotten his food neither. With no explanation to WHY he hadn't gotten his food.. we were both left waiting. My food finally comes out after another 20 mins. It's now 8:30. My crispy shrimp sandwich arrives. But WHERE WAS THE CUBAN SANDWICH?! But the best part about it was, WITHOUT any explanation, his sweet potato fries came out without the Cuban sandwich. I guess it was still lagging behind LOL. It was 8:40pm when the sandwich finally decided to come out. 3 other people at the table had finished their meals when we took our first bite.  I was waiting to the end of the meal before I started to rating this meal to see if the waiter or the manager or anyone working at cheesecake was going to do anything for our inconvenience. I understand mistake happens. I understand when it gets busy... people get flustered and even drop the ball from time to time. And that is perfectly okay. It is ALWAYS about how you treat the customer and making a bad situation into a better one. But NOPE... NOPE...NOPE...NOPE.  Our waitress said sorry probably like 10 times but that does nothing for our meal. It wasn't completely her fault. It was the entire crew at Cheesecake. I am a huge fan of this place. It is just disappointing that I was looking forward to eating here and this is what we get....  Overall stats: waited over an hour before getting seated. took over an hour to get everyone's food. People already finished eating before the last person got their dish. Where was the manager? Would have been nice if he/she came over to make sure all the customers are satisfied but hey... ""Cheesecake was probably busy"" ""there were probably another issue he/she had to take care of."" Either way... we were left in the dark. Nothing was compensated. For that night, Cheesecake Factory offered a horrible dining experience. Will not return any time soon.  Thanks for reading my rant. This is an honest review."
Kalani S.,"San Jose, United States",2,25,140,4.0,1/7/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a nice place for all occasions.
