Cherise X.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,4,2.0,9/18/2016,I'm giving two- stars only because they took over an hour to bring my bf and i both dishes and didn't bring them complete had to wait even longer to receive fries and grilled veggies another twenty minutes. Filled up on bread and salad didn't even touch my entree which by the way was missing crust onion straws. This used to be my favorite now not so much. Our server however was apologetic and kind.
Antonio E.,"Salinas, CA",7,72,19,4.0,4/25/2016,"Everything I ordered was good, especially the bread. Although the wait time was long the food was good, waitress was very friendly and portions were quite generous. The cheese cake was very delicious and made the drive and wait completely worth it. Would I come back here again? Maybe"
Tina N.,"San Jose, CA",1007,671,6490,3.0,4/21/2013,"Cousins, friends, and I went here last night after going to Yard House. Hahah, why? It was too full across the street so we went here instead. The wait was about 30 minutes. Pretty good for a Saturday night.  I always order their calamari! I mean it's so bad for you, but yet so good.  This time around I wasn't as hungry as I anticipated so I ordered the ahi carpaccio under the appetizers. It was very soft and had a smooth texture. I wish I had soy sauce and wasabi though, I didn't bother to ask since it was so busy.  Unfortunately, I didn't get our server's name but she was a Hispanic lady. She was very attentive and refilled our drinks without question. Good service and good food. Not quite yet great."
Jenn R.,"San Jose, CA",613,679,1868,1.0,1/3/2015,"I ate here yesterday and I'm so disappointed. They don't have too many gluten free options.  I ended up ordering the pasta carbonara gluten free. The waiter got it wrong and brought me pasta with tomato sauce. They had to take it back and remake my original order, which came out super soggy and watery!! It is probably the worst carbonara I've ever had. It was more like a soup!! So disappointed!  My friend ordered a gluten free burger and they brought out a regular burger which they almost served to her. Both of us have gluten allergies so these kinds of mistakes cannot happen. This would be a huge liability!  They don't offer a single gluten free cheesecake option on their menu. Can you believe that? Another disappointment.  Cheesecake needs to step up their game on gluten free menu offerings or else I'm never coming back here.  I could've made a huge commotion about these screw ups but I didn't want to deal with the drama. It was the new year and so I just wanted to be chill about things... But that still doesn't change how I rate this place. Service was terrible. Food was also terrible. Gluten free options are lacking."
Shyla J.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,48,127,3.0,4/8/2015,"***Four stars, but deducting one star until the ladies restroom sinks don't run water for a very long time...**** (We are in a SEVERE drought people!) The sinks are run by a timer, the other two sinks don't run as long as the first. We have told two different managers on two occasions. Hasn't been fixed, minus one star!  The food here, depending on what you get, is usually pretty good. I go here semi-regularly, here are my favorites:  Appetizers:  *Fried Mac N Cheese*- Delicious! Must try! I order it every time, but beware, don't let them get cold! Eat them PIPING HOT! Crispy outer layer holds well, with gooey EXTREMELY cheesy shell mac inside. I can't resist, it comes with 4, and they are fairly large.  *Potstickers*- Potstickers are potstickers, the sauce is amazing!  Entrees:  *Crusted Chicken Romano* I believe it comes with pasta which I do not care for, so I always sub. for mashed potatoes.  *Orange chicken* Truly one of my absolute favorites here, fried chicken with sweet orange sauce, amd the rice here really good! (Weird, I know, because its just steamed white rice, but it goes so well with the sauce!)  My sister, brother and dad pretty much always enjoy the *Chicken Madeira* which I know is very popular. Cheesecake:  *Tuxedo* ALL TIME FAVORITE. Have been eating this cheesecake since I was a kid! (I should really be a chubster..) *White Chocolate Raspberry* If you like raspberry at all, YOU MUST TRY THIS, if you haven't had anything White Chocolate & Raspberry you need to seriously make it a priority, haha, because it is the BEST combonation in the WORLD!  *Oreo* Standard oreo cheesecake. Pretty f***ing good!  Raspberry lemonade is definitely recommended!  The interior is beautiful! Kind of fancy but not like you need to dress up. Place is kept clean, bathrooms and eating areas, along with small waiting area (which gets crowded durimg rush hours) are all nicely maintained.  Service is hit or miss, sometimes you get placed in a bad servers section.. For the most part with the exception of a few dishes (Bbq Pizza, Cajun Chicken Pasta, etc.) I like the food & will continue to come back (& Update if/when the fossit time has been reduced!)  Get there early and definitely don't go STARVING because you probably won't be eating anything until 45mins after you are seated.  But, get there :)"
Yunzhu C.,"Belmont, CA",54,141,1021,3.0,2/1/2015,Pasta DaVinci is good! Cheesecake is also creamy~the free grain bread was warm and delicious!
Shirley V.,"San Jose, CA",542,314,1516,4.0,10/3/2013,"I only have a couple of things to say about TCF. I will be succinct. Big big big portions. (e.g. Mom, dad, and I shared 2 entrees and were stuffed. I can make one entree into at least 3 meals) Decadent cheesecakes ($6-$8 a slice, tasty but pricey).  Eat the chocolate bread (it's not chocolate, it's molasses but I lovingly call it chocolate bread because it's delicious warm).  Chicken marsala is very tender, mashed tatoes are good, lots of cheese on the chicken, asparagus is asparagus. Luau salad comes with 2 big fried wonton sheets, mangoes, green beans, carrots, red and yellow bell pepper, macadamia nuts, mixed greens, chicken breast, cucumber. If you like Asian salads/don't like cheese like me, get this one."
Victoria N.,"West Covina, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/13/2016,"Waiting 2 hours and counting to be sat, and have been told 15 more minutes for the last hour. If I wasn't here for a friends birthday, I would have been gone long ago,"
Liyuan W.,"Santa Cruz, CA",41,1,9,3.0,12/24/2016,"Food always good. But the services for today are unbelievable. We waited nearly an hour to have the pasta and also took the wrong one. The food definitely already cooked for time and reheated to sever. This Cheesecake Factory is really worst in quantity of service which I have been. Btw the manager gave us a discount. However,the server still horrible."
Dejene T.,"Hayward, CA",1,15,6,5.0,9/18/2016,Love the brown bread and ultimate margarita at cheesecake. Meso salmon was on point. Brenda our server was one of the best in cheesecake factory. She is a natural people person. See you again soon.
Amy H.,"San Jose, CA",1246,1323,2163,3.0,4/11/2013,"Everyone absolutely loves this place and I sorta don't know what the hype is about. Yeah the food portions are huge and it is like a fancier Applebee's or something. I've been here a couple times for dinner and the prices are around $15 for plates. The portions are pretty big so you will probably have leftovers. A negative is that the wait is around 45 minutes My review will be based off of their famous desserts! There are soooo many delicious slices of cheesecake/cake to choose from and it was just so hard to choose one. I ended up making a great decision and got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cake. MY GOODNESS. EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE. Peanut butter, chocolate and I even found a piece of butterfinger on the bottom. It is VERY rich and thick so I only finished half and saved the other half for the next day. In my head I thought, it is just one cheesecake, how bad can it be? I looked up the calorie count online and I almost fainted at how ridiculous it is. IT IS 1300 calories!!!! hahaha I LOLed when I saw this but it was sooo worth it.  Overall, the entrees are alright and the dessert is bomb. **TIPS** 1) Watch those calories when you choose a dessert. It will go straight to your hips. Definitely share a slice! 2) Walk around the mall while you wait so your long wait time will pass. 3) Enjoy!"
Shani R.,"San Jose, CA",32,10,3,5.0,10/12/2016,LOVE this place. Everything tasting amazing here. Super recommend for the miso salmon and the Camille bean cake is my favorite for people that love white chocolate. Also the customer service really good !
Theo T.,"Fremont, CA",1075,367,381,4.0,8/27/2013,"Now I have to start out by saying that I have a slight bias about The Cheesecake Factory because I used to work here and I left on really good terms. Even though I used to work here, the only real problem that I have with it is that the food is SO heavy. I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes which are always so delicious. Even though it is an appetizer, it is so heavy and large that I was able to eat it as an entree. Everything you order comes in a huge portion, which is good for the price, but not on your waistline. They are great at accommodating large groups, but it still takes quite some time since they do not take reservations. I would recommend for one person in your party to come early about an hour to an hour and a half and put your name down. Then plan that whatever time they quote you add 15 to 20 mins on top of that. Once you get your time just head to the mall and relax. That lobby gets so crazy, just standing in there gives me a headache. Regardless if the wait is long or the food is heavy, I will always come back to The Cheesecake Factory."
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA",2026,1460,8032,5.0,5/6/2013,"I'm actually surprised that the rating to this place isn't higher. There menu is huge and they will make dishes that aren't even on the menu. (Try the crabcake sandwish. It's amazing!) Bread good? Check! Great food? Check! Great service? Check! Amazing desserts? Oh yeah! Love the red velvet cheesecake.  I really can't find a complaint about this place. Maybe I've just been lucky with my food selection, but this place is amazing. Thumbs wayyyy up!"
Clarissa W.,"Permanente, CA",110,2,5,1.0,9/8/2016,Food is too oily like they put gallons of oil inside your food
Jessica R.,"San Jose, CA",48,12,11,4.0,11/27/2016,"My girlfriend and I have been here numerous times! We always order the Chicken Costoletta, it's probably the most savory chicken dish I've ever had. However, last night we came for our 5 year anniversary and were extremely bugged by our server Marilyn. The time before last night that we were here, we left a $31 tip on a $50 tab  and last night we left a $9.30 tip on a $60 tab and I honestly didn't want to tip her. We got here at about 11:10 pm and everything was going great, we ordered quickly and she came with our drinks pretty fast. However, she could not let us enjoy our meal in peace, she popped up literally every 3 minutes asking us the same question. She interrupted our conversations all the time and 3 of those times were to push us into buying a cheesecake that we didn't even want since we don't like cheesecake. A couple of minutes later, WE WERE STILL NOT DONE EATING and she just comes and picks up our plates and asks if we want boxes. Are you freaking kidding me?! So thoughtless and rude to just pick up our food without asking if we were even done eating. At this point my girlfriend and I were so annoyed. When the server brought us our tab she circled the recommended gratuity with a heart at the bottom of the receipt, she did that on both receipts and she then stayed the whole time  that we were writing the tip on the tab. I was so pissed off at this point, this is my favorite restaurant and we honestly should've just gone to Yard House across the street, because she totally ruined our mood for the night. I don't know if she's new or not but that is not the way to go about service. I used to be a server and let me tell you this lady needs proper training, because now I would much rather go to a different cheesecake location."
Shannen Q.,"Milpitas, CA",168,7,,1.0,9/5/2015,"I've been here before and had decent experiences but after tonight I will not return . We put our name down at 7:20 for a party of 14 and was told the expected time is 1.75 to 2 hour wait . We had no problem because it is a Saturday night . However after 2 hours, we did not even receive a buzzer . 30 minutes later we got a buzzer and said about a 10 minute wait before we can be seated . We waited another 20 minutes until I found out that other customers would not leave the tables that we needed . No buggy, it's not their fault .  However , our tables were set and we sat ourselves because no host came to take us to our seats . Then right off the bat, our waitress comes with a small attitude trying to rush us to get our orders in . After ordering, our food took almost 30 minutes to come out, and you can not tell me that they wait for all the food to be ready because all the burgers did not come until 10 minutes after . Another issue that really irked me was when a guest of mine asked for cheese the waitress never came with any so we asked again , and we let her know that we asked and she said she would come back and she then replied with attitude, rolled her eyes, and walked away .  Lastly, my food came out dry and I requested for some extra sauce and I asked 2 different waiters for the sauce . I waited until half my party already finished their food before I called the manager to complain . Fortunately the manager was nice enough to give my food for free, take away gratuity, as well ask pack my food up with its extra sauce . Afterwards, three other waiters along with or waitresses were off staring at us and whispering.  This place has one of the most rude service I have ever experienced . I expected so much more from such a big restaurant as Cheesecake Factory. If you want to go to a Cheesecake Factory , I recommend to go to the one at Oak Ridge mall ."
sonia b.,"Saratoga, CA",0,21,,2.0,12/7/2016,After waiting for 20 minutes I had to ask the bartender what had happened to my order. Soon after my meal arrived cold. Not happy!
Heun Y.,"San Mateo, CA",1,13,32,1.0,8/31/2015,"I used to like to come this place for lunch with my company friends, but after today I don't think I want to visit here again. After checked out, they didn't return my credit card!!! I found out that several hours later when I needed to use the card at bank. I called back and a guy told me they kept my card at a secure place and I can get my card back with my ID. He didn't apologize for any inconvenience that was caused by this until I asked for. Instead, his point was that I should appreciate they found it and kept it for me.  My card is a very thick card, and he said it was behind all my receipts. However, I did take away all the receipts for signing the bill. It's impossible that I could miss my card. What an attitude!!! I have to drive to the restaurant again for my card and all these were caused by the restaurant not me! Watch your card and make sure you get your card back after you pay your bill. Can't forget the conversation with the guy there on the phone, and it's your own employee drove your customer away from you, a regular customer! No more Cheesecake Factory!"
Nicole S.,"San Jose, CA",568,273,762,3.0,7/21/2014,"When I'm dragged to a chain restaurant this Cheesecake Factory is exactly what yelp's 3 star rating describes as, A-OK. I've been to this location as well as the one at Oakridge Mall plenty of times over the last few years. When comparing my favorite dishes, this location has always done a better job.  Been trying to eat healthier, trying is the key word, so I like how Cheesecake Factory has their Skinnylicious menu. My favorite pasta dish was the Pasta DaVinci, but at 1520 calories it sadly needs to be avoided.  I can't help but laugh at the name skinnylicious, sounds like bootylicious, maybe their menu will help me get there, lol.  Anyways back to the food. I ordered their chicken and mushroom lettuce wrap and surprisingly enjoyed my meal. It's listed as an appetizer on the menu but was filling enough for me because I just asked for more lettuce.  Service is always friendly here. Water always gets filled without issue."
Cherise X.,"San Jose, United States",0,21,4,2.0,18/9/2016,I'm giving two- stars only because they took over an hour to bring my bf and i both dishes and didn't bring them complete had to wait even longer to receive fries and grilled veggies another twenty minutes.

After checked out, they didn't return my credit card!!! I found out that several hours later when I needed to use the card at bank. I called back and a guy told me they kept my card at a secure place and I can get my card back with my ID. He didn't apologize for any inconvenience that was caused by this until I asked for. Instead, his point was that I should appreciate they found it and kept it for me.  My card is a very thick card, and he said it was behind all my receipts. However, I did take away all the receipts for signing the bill. It's impossible that I could miss my card. What an attitude!!! I have to drive to the restaurant again for my card and all these were caused by the restaurant not me! Watch your card and make sure you get your card back after you pay your bill. Can't forget the conversation with the guy there on the phone, and it's your own employee drove your customer away from you, a regular customer! No more Cheesecake Factory!"

I've been to this location as well as the one at Oakridge Mall plenty of times over the last few years. When comparing my favorite dishes, this location has always done a better job.  Been trying to eat healthier, trying is the key word, so I like how Cheesecake Factory has their Skinnylicious menu. My favorite pasta dish was the Pasta DaVinci, but at 1520 calories it sadly needs to be avoided.  I can't help but laugh at the name skinnylicious, sounds like bootylicious, maybe their menu will help me get there, lol.  Anyways back to the food. I ordered their chicken and mushroom lettuce wrap and surprisingly enjoyed my meal. It's listed as an appetizer on the menu but was filling enough for me because I just asked for more lettuce.  Service is always friendly here. Water always gets filled without issue."
