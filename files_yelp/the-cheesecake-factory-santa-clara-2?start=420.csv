Alice D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/27/2016,Great place. Reasonable prices Love the many options they have
Saina D.,"El Sobrante, CA",38,23,3,1.0,6/21/2016,"My waitress was so rude she took 40 minutes to bring my food and when I asked where is my food she came back with a cold food, so I am sure my food was ready she just didn't bother to bring it because I was too patient to ask! And she gave me attitude as well!"
Lana N.,"San Jose, CA",330,303,43,4.0,7/27/2014,"Been to many Cheesecake Factories and I've been to this location several times. My all time favorite is the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  If I didn't gain weight, I would eat it everyday!  They had a skinnylicious menu and we tried a couple of items on there. +skinny margarita - tastes like the original one, but not with all the calories. +crab bites - came out on a little cast iron dish with 6 pieces and some mustard/tartar sauce on the side. These were pretty good and enough to share. +skinny turkey burger - this was surprisingly good, it came with tomato, grilled onions and a side salad. Very filling, but not heavy on your stomach.  +Evelyn's pasta - husband always orders this,  it's a nice and simple pasta dish which I've learned to replicate at home, yet he still orders it lol. +original cheesecake with fresh strawberries - of course this isn't on their skinny menu, but it was so good, I couldn't resist. Service was great as usual, the only thing I dislike is the long wait. They said it was about 30 minutes,  but it was more like 45 minutes. Which really isn't too bad for a Saturday night dinner."
Amrita G.,"San Jose, CA",195,172,128,3.0,10/9/2014,"We ordered the sweet and spicy chipotle pasta it was great. Will try their cheesecakes the next time after I have lost a little more weight . Service was mediocre. Our server could not get us the bread (we did not ask for it, it's complementary, not that hat we wanted it, but having told us twice that she would and then failing to get it) .Also the wait is Very long and once your named is called they still make you wait further!"
Albert W.,"Milpitas, CA",788,219,142,2.0,9/20/2015,"Service was very slow. Water was taken away and server brought back after 5 min for refill Second appetizer came out slow over 15 min after the first appetizer came out Took over 10 min after we finish dessert to get attention from our server and after the bill came, Bill was sitting on the table with credit card over 10 min Butter was reused and melted for the first round of bread Crab cake wasn't hot when it came out Chicken mushroom wrap was too salty First server pass our table to second server and saying that he will help as well. First server neglected us for the rest of the time we were there"
Cristina L.,"Los Altos, CA",151,2,2,1.0,6/6/2016,Seriously disappointed with this place today. I was there on my lunch break trying to have a nice meal. I got ranch spilled all over me and in result of that I hit my toe on the table base when I got up to go clean myself off and my big toe nail pushed back and snapped off. Now I have a bad injury. Although the waitress was very apologetic the fact that not even a manager came over to ask if I was ok after the situation shows lack of leadership. I left due to having to return to work. I was very upset that they didn't have the courtesy to bring it up to management. I called once I got off of work and asked to speak to a manager and I am currently sitting on hold 20 mins and counting waiting for someone to grab a manager for me...... This is probably one of the worst customer service experienced....... I love Cheesecake Factory but they really let me down with this one. I can't attach pictures but I will post my toe and the phone call of me waiting. Which is almost at 25 mins.
Kia F.,"San Jose, CA",3,125,12,4.0,7/24/2016,"It's 10 at night, my companion and I have been wondering where to eat at this hour and we were just rudely turned away at 2 other restaurants that won't honor their closing hours, Cheesecake Factory to the rescue. My server Jasmine is unaffected by this long hot day, she is pleasant and attentive and just what 2 hungry patrons need. I just want to thank her with a nice review. I wish we could always encounter servers like her who are resilient and always on top of things."
Harini V.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I usually don't review  a place unless it's exceptional or really disappointing. Latter is the case now.This cheesecake factory location near valley Fair Mall , San Jose is unbelievable. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and the wait was 30-50 mins which is acceptable, but even after my buzzer went on we were not seated saying 'it doesn't work that way ' ,why the hell did you give me that thing then.. well, after we were seated, for 20 mins! ,none of the servers cared to come, let alone take our orders. I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old  and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server  and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing . How can I blame him if 'my table's server' didn't even bother to show up after all our talk with the manager which was after 45 mins wait . The manager who was a lady was like u don't have to pay any bill , I didn't taste any damn thing in ur restaurant to take out my wallet.  The worst worst part of everything is we had a 2 year old with us and inspire of telling them we had to feed the baby, their response was 'there was some miscommunication and your table didn't show up in the list to be served'... What the hell lady, can't u see us sitting there and forgive us your majesty for choosing to come to ur restaurant and yeah asking for ur food."
Kimberly J.,"San Jose, CA",33,1,,1.0,9/18/2016,I would give zero stars if possible. I ordered the Cobb salad and had it delivered through door dash. My salad was missing the bacon and avocado. It was also supposed to have egg but it had a measly 1/4 of one hard boiled egg. It is also supposed to have chicken breast but I was digging through the mound of shredded lettuce only to find like three thinly sliced pieces of chicken. Very disappointed with what I got.
Lily L.,"Santa Clara, CA",37,544,2141,3.0,11/26/2014,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory numerous times and each time I ask myself why I come here.  Their food is average at best.  I guess I go because it has a nice atmosphere and a large selection so when I'm indecisive, I can eventually find something to eat.  Maybe their menu is too large which results in mediocre tasting food.  It isn't bad, it just isn't very good.  They do have nice drinks (alcohol) which makes it a fun gathering place.  Maybe that's it, go if you want a nice place to gather with friends over drinks and a vast menu that has to have something for everyone.  Just don't expect great tasting food."
Nikki A.,"San Jose, CA",21,28,58,5.0,9/2/2015,The Cheesecake Factory..... Oh the cheesecake!!!! Loooove this place. Nice for a fancy dinner or date.  The food is obviously going to be more expensive because of the ambiance as well but it's really good if you want to treat yourself!!  I alwaaaaays have to order the avocado rolls for $10. It fills me up and I don't have to buy a big pasta dish for dinner anymore. I always go with an appetizer or 2 for my dinner here when I come here for my friend's birthdays cause I'm a cheap ass and only order from that one page. Pretty obvious by the name of the restaurant but the cheese cakes are bomb ass hell!!!!!  $30 for a 7'' cake but it was totally worth it.. Also my mom made me buy it. Anyyywaayysss.  If you're eating here might as well say it's your birthday to get a free ice cream out of it!!! LOL. GET THE AVOCADO ROLLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sayeed A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/16/2016,"Absolutely No Stars At All !!! My family and I just had a horrible experience of lousy customer service and being mistreated at the CheeseCake Factory located in the Valley Fair Mall. My family and I arrived at the restaurant for what we were looking forward to as a nice meal and overall experience at the place in the evening. And I am sad to say that what transpired was an exact opposite and an utter feeling distaste. We placed our food order, we're just served appetizer and drinks and were kept waiting for more than 45 minutes. We did get a hearty serving of extremely shabby and horrible customer service by a couple of discourteous staff ... They know who I am talking about ! Instead of apologizing and accepting the fault in their discourteous service, and trying to compensate for the dissatisfaction  the staff that we dealt with just acted like its business as usual ! Sadly we will NEVER visit this location of the Cheesecake Factory and contribute to their business ever now !!!!"
Linda R.,"San Jose, CA",62,29,,1.0,5/31/2016,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I normally like CF food but this was a HORRIBLE experience.  First we were seated on the 'lighter' side of the restaurant only to be told minutes later that the host had seated us wrong and then we were put on the dim side. Ok, not horrible yet, but annoying.  Then we waited 40 minutes for our meal to come out. I ordered the Herb crusted salmon, mash, and asparagus, my hubby ordered the pork chop, mash and green beans. The salmon was TASTELESS and barely cooked. Seriously, this is fish, how long does it take to cook well? My mashed potatoes were cold. My hubby's mash had some black stuff in it that we couldn't identify but when we told the manager she confirmed that it was burnt potatoes??? OMG! The green beans had no flavor either and tasted as if they were sitting in a pot of water for hours.  The service: Once I brought the ridiculously long wait time to the attention to the manager, the waitress got irritated and appreared to not be interested in trying to serve us any further. Which is STUPID because the food wasnt directly her fault so not sure why she was acting all butt hurt. Being that our waitress was MIA I had to ask a hostess to call a manager and she acted like she didnt hear me. RUDE!  The manager's that I spoke to were respectful and nice and comp'd us a cheesecake and the meal, but at $20+/plate I expected more so that I wouldn't have had to talk to the managers.  You can be sure we will not be returning. This was unacceptable and inexcusable and it's a shame because this could have been a really nice eating spot for us."
Lovegood F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",57,63,,5.0,11/22/2016,"Sat at the bar with Justin.  Had an amazing experience.  Excellent food.  My husband had the burger, cooked to perfection.  I had the Chicken Castoletta, amazing changed it up a little had pasta in place of potato.  Service was great, food amazing and happy hour.  I highly recommend this location unlike Walnut Creek.  Parking is a little difficult to come by due to construction."
Samira Z.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,5,5.0,3/13/2016,"We had a great night in The cheese cake factory on Friday. The food was very good and Our server Maricela was amazing, friendly and nice to explain menu.  Highly recommend. We will decently be back, Thank you for everything."
Christine Allison M.,"San Jose, CA",148,8,4,5.0,10/24/2015,"Jimmy and Justin are so nice! The best bartenders you could ask for! Attentive, accommodating, and such a pleasure to talk to (especially when you're high maintenance.  Kudos.) Ps. The Cali Guac salad is pretty tasty."
Jan E.,"San Jose, CA",181,271,980,4.0,9/11/2013,"This is a great place to take someone on a date because it's fancy and the menu has a million things to choose from. We usually get 3 appetizers to share and each get our own main dish. We even get a cheesecake to wash everything down. I like the strawberry lemonade and that has unlimited refills. We've never had a problem with the service. They are pretty good about bringing your food out and refilling your water. There's so much to choose on the menu. We like trying new things. Everything is pretty good. There's room for improvement for some of the food though. For example, I ordered the spring summer rolls and the wrap was all broken. They did not know how to wrap a Vietnamese spring roll lol. The crab cheese wonton is also good. The lobster and artichoke dip is good. Ahhhh my mouth is watering as I'm listing some of their yummy food. My hubby liked the pork chop but to me it was kinda dry but that's just me. I liked the hibachi steak but he did not like it. I remember not liking the club sandwich either. Overall everything is pretty good. They also give you bread and butter while you wait for your food so that's cool if you are hella hungry. Our bill is usually $100 because we don't eat here often and like to go all out. I still say its a good date place but if you're cheap then go eat at the food court lol. One con is that our snicker cheesecake was old one time. You can taste the old ness. $7.50 for an old slice of cheesecake is a no no. You would expect fresh cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory right?? But nope they gave us an old one that was at least a few days old. Other than that we still like this place and will come back."
Katelyn R.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,1,2.0,6/5/2016,This place needs to realize Doordash is there in place of the customer and we are just as important as everyone else. Oh and if you have orders sitting there get rid of them because people are waiting. I waited 30 mins for a bag that was there the whole time AND I was told my order wasn't even made yet! Bull!
John E.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/7/2016,"Just had dinner here, very good service, waiter was knowledgeable and offered a lunch size for me which was just right. Have not had shrimp and pasta that good since I was last in Paris, France.Pricey but reasonable. Ambience was spectacular and very comfortable."
