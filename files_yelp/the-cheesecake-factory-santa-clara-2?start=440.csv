Abhinav G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,21,,1.0,7/31/2016,I wish that Yelp had a 0-star. This Cheesecake Factory has one of the worst services I've seen. Super rude service and unwilling to adjust to a simple request.
Alex K.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,8,4,1.0,8/9/2017,"If I could give this place 0 starts I would. The only good thing out of dining here was the bread. To start off the restaurant wasn't super busy but had a 15-20 minute wait which wasn't horrible. The waitress my girlfriend and I had was friendly but was not attentive to anything we said. We order drinks, an appetizer, and a main course. The appetizer never came. The drinks came when our food came after waiting 40-45 minutes and after reminded her twice about the drinks. My drink was at least 75% ice and tasting flat. We then ordered one slice of cheesecake thinking it would only take a few minutes for one slice of cheesecake to travel from the front of the restaurant to our table, nope. Almost 15 minutes of waiting. And that point we were both pretty fed up and paid the bill. I will be returning to talk to the manger because the service was unbearable. I do not recommend coming here to anyone. The scenery is nice and romantic but everything else is shit."
Thank M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,33,,5.0,8/22/2016,Visited recently to eat dinner with a large team. I have only good words to say about this place except for the large wait. This place is so poplar that we had to wait an hour to get seating for the large team. The service and the food was excellent.  They also brought some sweets and sang a birthday song for the person who was celebrating her birthday!
Holly T.,"Milpitas, CA",2,25,1,3.0,7/31/2016,"We celebrated my sister-in-law's birthday here. The food was alright, nothing special. Service could have been faster. We ordered a few cocktail drinks, and none tasted good or decent. The servers did come out to wish my sister-in-law's a happy birthday. She got a complimentary sundae. Overall, we would not celebrate birthday here again unless request by the birthday girl/boy."
Miss A.,"San Jose, CA",5,61,12,5.0,8/19/2015,Yummmmmy. The food and drinks couldn't of been better. We sat at the bar and the bartender Leticia was super friendly and fast! Great experience!!
Emilie D.,"Tucson, AZ",83,89,10,4.0,10/26/2015,"What can I say, who doesn't love a good piece of cheesecake?! Came here on a Friday night (yes it was packed to the rim) and had a great night. What my group of 4 people did was that we had 2 girls leave 45 minutes early, put down the names and then the other 2 girls came later to meet them. I will say, it must've sucked for the other 2 girls, but hey they volunteered and I only waited 15 mins :) I got the skinnylicious chicken soft tacos and they were quite filling. And of course for desert we shared a piece of cheesecake! We ended up getting the Oreo cheecake and it was BOOOMB. Best part was that the staff was super friendly and totally accomodating. Will be going back very soon!"
Harish D.,"Santa Clara, CA",74,63,388,4.0,8/23/2014,This place is great to hangout at even on weekends given how big it is. We ordered white chicken chilli which was basically a tasty chicken curry with 2 or 3 different kinds of pepper and small portion of rice. It was absolutely fantastic. I was hungry and left wanting for more at the end of my meal. We also ordered the Calabrian pizza and it was great. I think I've had the best pizzas at Wolfgang Puck and this one came in a close second. It was easy to bite into with the right amount of cheese and a good assortment of toppings.
Neha C.,"Santa Clara, CA",17,3,,1.0,5/20/2016,This review is for the customer service. We called in today to place a take out order. 4 times we were told that we are putting you on a brief hold and even after 15 mins no one answered. If its that busy you can straight away say that we cannot take anymore orders right now.
J S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/21/2017,"Horrible service, cold food and half the items we attempted to order were unavailable.  Don't waste your time or money here."
Ocee D.,"Denver, CO",571,1201,2657,1.0,5/15/2015,"Got food poisoning here a few months ago and hadn't been back since, but I've been craving one of their salads for the last few weeks, so I decided to squash the beef. My mistake Last Friday night: Called in my order for curbside pickup, and they told me it would be ready in 20 min. Got there and called them, and they said they'd be right out. Was waiting for a while, but it was pretty packed, so I gave them some more time. After 15 minutes of waiting, I called and let them know that I'm about to leave. They were out w/in a minute, apologized, and said my order was sitting on the counter and that I shouldn't have had to wait so long. Thursday Afternoon: Same order. They said it would be ready w/in 15 min. I gave them 20. Pulled up, called, and was put on hold. After staying on hold for over 5 minutes while I could see that they weren't busy at all, I left.  F**k you TCF for wasting my time!"
Xin W.,"San Francisco, CA",294,111,234,4.0,4/24/2015,"So I'm always on this endless pursuit in finding the best cheesecake. There are various qualities that I look at: the texture (and how smooth it is), the softness/fluffiness of it (it should melt in your mouth), the balance of sweetness and tanginess, the levels of acidity (very important in a rich dish like the cheesecake), the crust (not too thick and not too thin) and how crunchy it is, the flavors, the presentation, and the freshness (especially when there are fruit toppings). The secret is to bake the cheesecake low and slow to prevent it from cracking, to prevent the sides from rising and the center from sinking, and to result in a light, moussey texture. However unless you're Gordon Ramsay or on Masterchef, it usually take 5+ hours to bake the perfect cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory add synthetic binders, like guar gum and xanthan gum, to their batter to allow it to be baked faster while still holding it together. While the cheesecake here is definitely not the best I've tasted, it tastes pretty good. My favorite is the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. Nice bite of acidity, good balance of sweetness and tanginess, thin crunchy crust with an airy-looking texture. All of the other cheesecake I've eaten here are either too sweet or too rich.  For the entrees, I really love the Steak Diane. Very flavorful, very tasty, and the steak is cooked to perfection, very juicy. The shrimp scampi is also great! Although I wish they would put in more shrimps. I'm not quite a fan of their pasta, it's very buttery and very rich.  Ambience is cozy, although it can get busy at times."
Delilah B.,Australia,12,13,18,5.0,7/11/2014,"This place is awesome. Its relatively cheap and the portions are generous. The menu is extentsive and I haven't tried anything I haven't liked yet. I will warn you though, there is usually a wait time of 20 minutes or more any time I have visited.  But you get free bread. The Brown bread is the bomb! Its a little sweet and 100% delicious. I always end up eating at least two rolls of it while waiting for my meal. I always pass on the White bread, its pretty blah. Eat at the Cheesecake Factory! You won't be disappointed! P.S The S'mores Cheesecake is the BEST."
Teri C.,"Campbell, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/13/2015,"Door Dash has responded, they have credited me the cost of my food.  No word yet from Manager at Cheesecake.   Thank you Door Dash"
Yvette J.,"San Jose, CA",64,4,,4.0,8/18/2016,Great experience took my nephew there for his birthday they sang to him and made him feel special the food was great excellent service just too long of a wait
Kelcy W.,"Woodstock, MD",95,1,1,1.0,7/21/2016,"One star because they did not screw up my rice. Everything else on the other hand... ordered the fish tacos and it took 20 min to come out (do not get crispy, it just tastes like grease). I sent it back and got grilled instead. They forgot to put the sauce on. I talked to the manager and they took it off the bill but. These pueces of fish are SO tiny. Maybe I am picky because I ave gottent acos elsewhere and they have been fabulous and huge but cheessecake factory was lacking today."
Tim A.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,4.0,8/3/2015,"A lot of choice on the menu. The food is good. The service is professional.  But it is always very, very crowded. Expect to wait to be seated. And expect a lot of noise. The staff tries to cope, and I guess they do a good job at that. But still."
Aggy E.,"Jacksonville, FL",81,105,103,4.0,9/19/2014,"Just 2 weeks ago, it was my first time I've ever had Cheesecake Factory and holy cow I am in love. I tried their 'Chicken and Biscuits' menu and I have never had anything like it before. Although they are a bit pricey compared to other restaurants, definitely worth it if you want to have a special night out. The food is amazing, the bread was also amazing. It came to the point where I put ""try all the menus at the Cheesecake Factory"" on to my bucket list. No kidding. Can't wait to go there again!"
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,3.0,7/3/2012,"This is the location I frequent the most since it was the closest, but it's usually a long wait, and always busy and packed, and service can be hit or miss here. Although since the restaurant is conveninently located in Valley Fair, I usually shop for a bit at stores while I wait, which helps the time pass by quickly. But I'm always worried I'll lose my place, so I try to come back before the estimated wait time they give. I prefer sitting in booths because when they seat you in the row of tables, which I have sat at before, you are so dang close to your neighboring patrons. It gets so loud sometimes that it's hard to have a conversation with who you're dining with at times too. I usually get the miso salmon or farafelle with chicken. My friend got the chicken lettuce cups here as her entree, and they were pretty darn tasty, and comes with various sauces to dip with. For some odd reason, even though the food is the same, this seems to be the most chaotic location."
Marie S.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/22/2016,I love their variety menu.  I never get tired ordering the same dish.  I love the beef dish . The service is always good.
Babak G.,"Santa Clara, CA",73,137,21,4.0,9/7/2015,"Sometimes you don't know what you need or you can't get what you expect, Cheesecake Factory and especially this one is good for these kind of situations. You can have standard service and standard food and be happy. But nothing amazing..."
