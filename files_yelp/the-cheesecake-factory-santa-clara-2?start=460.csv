Julio N.,"San Jose, CA",372,30,183,4.0,6/21/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is always a good go to option. The wait is sometimes long but well worth  a half hour wait. Don't know if I would wait an hour. The chicken and shrimp jambalaya is my go to dish. It is one of the best dishes I've had. With pasta and veggies and spices! You can't go wrong.
G. F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",7,84,795,4.0,7/9/2015,"Had a great time here with my good friend after a long, fun day at Great America! Food was good and service was pretty good. Left too full and happy. Loved the beet salad. And mac and cheese was good also."
Angel Y.,"Fremont, CA",14,53,41,5.0,11/6/2014,"Delicious food, Huge portions, amazing service, reasonable prices! I've been to this location Cheesecake Factory a total of 6 times and every time have left with leftovers, a full stomache, and a smile on my face.  Just went here last night for my fiancé's birthday-we ordered the California cheesesteak sandwich (comes with regular fries or onion rings) he chose both, I ordered the chipotle bow tie chicken pasta, a soda, and of course red velvet cheesecake at the end (enough to share), total bill came to $50.00! THAT IS NOT BAD AT ALL! We had plenty of food remaining, and believe me we can both grub. The onion rings are stacked up high and they are massive, the fries is large enough to be compared to size xl at fast food joints. Love this place!!!"
Olivia R.,"San Jose, CA",33,28,1,4.0,8/19/2015,"The cheesecake factory is a fun restaurant with decent food and good service. It offers a wide variety of foods on the menu (mostly comfort food) as well as a bunch of different deserts and drinks. Last time I went I order the eggplant parmesan and it was decent enough; I've have better before, but it was still really delicious. The price of the food is not too bad either; you can get a pretty decent sized meal for around $10-11 dollars. The problem I have with this place is how ridiculously crowded it can get sometimes. I've had wait times be as long as an hour and a half at times just to sit down at a table. That being said the service here is really good, our waitress especially was super friendly and I have to give her props for being as quick as she was considering the crowd. Definitely a fun place to eat, kids will especially love it."
Anubhuti C.,"San Jose, CA",10,20,,4.0,6/28/2016,Very fond of the food and the ambience here. The restaurant has been our go to for the birthdays in our group. Love the chocolate pastry here and the avocado egg rolls.
Karen L.,"Cupertino, CA",481,61,64,2.0,7/30/2015,"I don't understand why people are so hyped about Cheesecake Factory. Wait: If you're going around dinner time or any rush hour, prepare to wait about an hour. Service: I'm sure they have outstanding servers, BUT, I have yet experience a warm and kind server here. It's not that they're rude, but you can tell that they're tired, or irritated...I mean, we're all human and I can empathize, but it's not an amazing dining experience, yah know? Food: Ehhhhh. Mediocre...Shrimp Scampi was good if you like a cream based sauce. Extensive menu, but very few cream sauce pasta options, and the only seafood pasta they have will only be shrimp based.  Cheesecakes: Extensive menu, and they're known for their cheesecakes! You can't go wrong. TLDR: It's not a restaurant that I will crave or die to go back to...not only is the food just alright, the experience in itself didn't capture me either."
Xiao X.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/6/2015,"I placed an to go order at this location and unfortunately they missed the cheesecake but charged for it - I did not realize I did not get the cake until the next day as I was planning to eat it the next day so I called the restaurant. After been put on hold for 10 mins the mgr interrogated me for 15 mins including asking me twice why I did not check the order on spot like that is the law. I ended the conversation as I felt like not wasting time on a piece of cheesecake. I used to love this restaurant but treating your customer like they want to scam you for a piece of cheesecake is not an intelligent way to grow business.  This happened on 6/6/15 and this mgr-on-duty really should improve her work ethics as well as intelligence. I mean after all she is in the service industry and it is her most basic job to treat customers in a respectful way, then second comes managing a restaurant."
Donnette T.,"Saratoga, CA",15,68,148,4.0,6/2/2016,"We have been to more than one location but this one is our usual spot because we shop at valley fair and Santana row. Sometimes a wait but always good food and giant portions. Our family just really likes the ambience, food, drinks & cheesecake! A few of the appetizers/ alvo eggrolls & buffalo sum things  ( can't remember the actual name) need more dipping sauce.., save your waiters the pain of running back n forth and the customer the issue of asking- give more dipping sauce please:)! If I dip my thing 5 times and all the sauce is gone and we still have a half a plate of stuff... Ya know. But this place is pretty darn yummy!!!"
Steve H.,"San Jose, CA",5,24,6,4.0,12/21/2015,Go here often for the convenience and familiarity.  The drinks are good and food is dependable.  Always an option when at Valley Fair. Pick up orders can take a while to pick up when they are busy as they understaff the pickup register to favor the in-house diners.
Liz W.,"Cupertino, CA",166,54,1,4.0,6/17/2015,"Their menu is so huge I'm often lost on what to eat here. But I think I finally found my favorite after many trial and error.  PRICE  - Their lunch special is fairly reasonably priced - ranging from $10-15 depending on what you pick. We had the pasta and the salad from the lunch special.  FOOD  - Their Louisiana Chicken is quite amazing for pasta! It has this right balance of cream with a bit of spice. So you can actually eat the whole plate without craving something spicy to balance the creaminess of the pasta. Also, I really liked the way the chicken was fried! The batter was crisp and the chicken was moist. Very delicious dish. 4.5/5.  - Their Luau salad was really good. I love the combination of fruits and vegetables. I did wish that the mango was a bit more ripe to bring out its sweetness. The presentation was also very pretty - with all these colorful bell pepper slices & mangoes in the midst of all the green. However, the chicken was very very dry. 3.5/5.  - Their cheesecake is excellent - honestly, I've had a lot of different types and I haven't been disappointed in any of them. I didn't get any this time around because I was stuffed, but I was very very tempted to. haha.  SERVICE - I know she had a lot of people to serve, but she was still so accommodating and nice. I love how she left a little handwritten ""thank you"" on the bill. :].  MISC  - Also, I found it interesting that their lunch special lasts all the way to 5pm! In most restaurants I've been to, lunch specials usually end around 3pm or so.  - I always found cheesecake factory a bit cold. So bring a jacket!  - One thing to note is that, we asked for the salad dressing to be on the side, and we did get the dressing on the side, but the salad still came seasoned with some sort of a sweeter dressing. I wasn't sure if that was a mistake or if the salad is pre-mixed.. but the dressing that was already on the salad and the dressing on the side that it came with had very very different flavors (the dressing on the side has more lemon, vinegar and sour taste to it). - you will always wait here. I've been to this restaurant multiple times and I've never just been able to walk in and eat hahaha. I came today on a weekday around 3pm and I still had to wait a couple minutes (literally no more than 5-10 minutes, but nevertheless, a wait). I'm not complaining about the wait at all, but just know that you do. especially for a bigger party than 2."
Karen M.,"San Jose, CA",6,84,840,2.0,2/19/2016,"I believe the customer service could be better. I arrived a few minutes before opening at 11AM. The day was bitter cold and windy in Santa Clara and there were several women huddled at both the locked doors. Inside, one could see the manager and several workers standing around talking and laughing; they could see us standing there in the wind. I feel that management could have at least let us into the lobby area; but no, we were freezing out there with our noses pressed against the windows. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. The flavor was fine, it was the beef that was tough and extremely fatty; literally, there were huge chunks of fat throughout the beef. After removing as much fat as I could, I was just about left with a cheese and grilled onion sandwich. I know there are a lot of people who enjoy fatty meat, but it isn't my cup of tea. The Wait Service can use some attention. Our server seemed to disappear all the time; had to constantly look around for her to get her attention. Just a note, management sets the tone for the entire staff."

If I ever do stray from Oreo, my other favorite is the classic Fresh Strawberry cheesecake which you can never go wrong with. Maybe one day, I'll summon enough courage from within to truly deviate and try something new because there are a bunch of solid options to choose from."
Cory L.,"Aiea, HI",13,109,317,4.0,7/5/2014,"Picture of my food looked amazing right!!!!! Well the foods great service is awesome. Only complaint my food arrived to my table ice cold. I ordered the most fattening such on the menu. Miso Glazed Salmon. Salmon was perfectly cooked no complaints.  However my sauce on the plate (butter cream and miso) ice cold, rice served hard and cold. I substituted the snow peas for asparagus and it to was ice cold."
Sean H.,"San Jose, CA",15,137,25,3.0,4/15/2015,"I do like the Cheesecake Factory most of the time, especially having this one right there at valley fair and Santana row.  Time: slow, we got seated and ordered the artichoke appetizer, waited about 30 minutes for it. The artichoke itself was actually really good. Then we proceeded to order food, the food took absolutely forever, I mean about an hour. That's quite a long time.  Service: she was super nice and helpful. It was obvious she was super busy, and couldn't help the food time. For a Sunday night, it was busy, and there were obviously too few servers.  Food: it all came out pretty well, just needed to be a lot faster, 2+ hours is a long time for the Cheesecake Factory."
Colby D.,"San Jose, CA",156,546,1919,4.0,7/25/2014,Got a macaroni cheeseburger and it was pretty good. S'mores cheesecake was great. A little overpriced.
Sandra N.,"Fremont, CA",388,343,1082,2.0,9/12/2012,"We were celebrating a friend's 21st birthday and asked our waitress if they do anything special for birthdays. She said they did and brought out a dessert towards the end of our meal. It was just a shot glass full of whipped cream. Just whipped cream! There was nothing else in it. Seriously? Cheesecake factory couldn't afford to give even a tiny piece of dessert in that tiny shot glass? If it was free, then I would've just been mildly annoyed. But after we left, my friend told me that they charged us $9 for that shot of whipped cream -____- Besides that issue, the rest of the experience was okay. The wait for a table was pretty long since we had a large group. Service was average. I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice since the birthday girl recommended it. It was definitely tasty but I'm not sure if it was worth the price. I'm hoping this is the only Cheesecake Factory that's so disappointing, but I probably won't be going to another one anytime soon to find out."
Andrea W.,"Fremont, CA",149,1828,990,3.0,7/19/2015,"I came here with a group of 8 around 6PM on a weekend, and we waited for about 30-40 minutes for a table. We were seated in a booth and promptly served menus and water, as well as drinks. There's complimentary sourdough bread and brown? bread (I'm not entirely sure what it was, maybe oat bread? My friends said it was somewhat sweet though), and the bread was very fresh and soft. The waiter was pretty good about coming over to see whether we were ready to order and to refill our water, as well as coming back to ask how our food was during the meal and clearing our plates afterward. I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, and it was alright. There was a LOT of pasta (there was green pasta as well as the usual white pasta), and the chicken was pretty tender. The shrimp wasn't very fresh though, and there seemed to be a lack of sauce. There was somehow a lot of oil though. The sauce wasn't very spicy, and I think there could have been more toppings to balance out the amount of pasta in the dish. Either that, or there should have been less pasta. For the amount of food, the price is decent seeing that this is a higher-class restaurant - my pasta was around $18 pre-tax pre-tip. I also shared a strawberry cheesecake with my friends. The whipped cream is really good! Very thick and not overly sweet. Yum. Each cheesecake slice is around $8 pre-tax pre-tip, but I guess that's excusable seeing that this is Cheesecake Factory. Anyway, average food, pretty good service. Come here for fancy occasions, but not on a regular basis."

Tala P.,"Santa Clara, CA",88,114,203,2.0,5/15/2016,Rating this for their Sunday brunch lately.  My family and I would come here all the time for years on Sunday's brunch but for the past couple months their brûlée french toast has been failing...  It's like fried bread with syrup.  Asked for ketchup and the second waitress that brought our food out (Asian girl - not our main waitress) totally forgot.  And it's early and hardly any people here.  Very disappointed.
Jennifer L.,"San Jose, CA",113,108,269,4.0,4/16/2014,"I always go here and it always seems to be packed!! So always expect a wait. Sometimes you do get lucky and get seated right away! Or you can always opt for the bar area if seats are available.  Cheesecake Factory has got to be one of my fav places to eat at. Extensive menu!!! Their menu is basically a book! So much to choose from. It can be overwhelming for someone who's never eaten here before. But because I've eaten here so much, there's always those dishes I keep going back for!  Cocktails .. My favorites are the Ritz Martini and Ultimate margarita. Ritz martini basically has Courvoisier, Champagne, Cointreau and Pomegranate Juice. It's soooo good & strong! When I'm in the mood for tequila, can't go wrong with that ultimate margarita (stronger Version of their margarita?) I believe it's top shelf also.  Favorite Appetizers.. Avocado egg rolls, Mac and cheese balls, ahi tuna tartare ( wish they gave you a bigger portion though!) Entrees... Louisiana chicken pasta and pasta da Vinci are to die for! So flavorful. Pasta da Vinci is a bit on the sweeter side because of the Marsala sauce. The sauce for the Louisiana chicken pasta is a Cajun style spicy. When I'm in the healthy mood, I opt for the ahi tuna tatake salad. The ahi tuna is perfection. The best ahi tuna salad compared to other places I've tried.  And lastly... Cheesecake!! at this point I'm usually already super full, but either get the cheesecake to go or continue to stuff my face. Can't go wrong with the tiramisu or red velvet cheesecake. My two fav!  Service is always great here. Never had any bad service. They're usually pretty good and quick at your drink refills and bread."

Tala P.,"Santa Clara, United States",88,114,203,2.0,15/5/2016,Rating this for their Sunday brunch lately.  My family and I would come here all the time for years on Sunday's brunch but for the past couple months their brûlée french toast has been failing...  It's like fried bread with syrup.  Asked for ketchup and the second waitress that brought our food out (Asian girl - not our main waitress) totally forgot.  And it's early and hardly any people here.  Very disappointed.
Jennifer L.,"San Jose, United States",113,108,269,4.0,16/4/2014,"I always go here and it always seems to be packed!! So always expect a wait. Sometimes you do get lucky and get seated right away! Or you can always opt for the bar area if seats are available.  Cheesecake Factory has got to be one of my fav places to eat at. Extensive menu!!! Their menu is basically a book! So much to choose from. It can be overwhelming for someone who's never eaten here before. But because I've eaten here so much, there's always those dishes I keep going back for!  Cocktails .. My favorites are the Ritz Martini and Ultimate margarita. Ritz martini basically has Courvoisier, Champagne, Cointreau and Pomegranate Juice. It's soooo good & strong! When I'm in the mood for tequila, can't go wrong with that ultimate margarita (stronger Version of their margarita?) I believe it's top shelf also.  Favorite Appetizers.. Avocado egg rolls, Mac and cheese balls, ahi tuna tartare ( wish they gave you a bigger portion though!) Entrees... Louisiana chicken pasta and pasta da Vinci are to die for! So flavorful. Pasta da Vinci is a bit on the sweeter side because of the Marsala sauce. The sauce for the Louisiana chicken pasta is a Cajun style spicy. When I'm in the healthy mood, I opt for the ahi tuna tatake salad. The ahi tuna is perfection. The best ahi tuna salad compared to other places I've tried.  And lastly... Cheesecake!! at this point I'm usually already super full, but either get the cheesecake to go or continue to stuff my face. Can't go wrong with the tiramisu or red velvet cheesecake. My two fav!  Service is always great here. Never had any bad service. They're usually pretty good and quick at your drink refills and bread."
