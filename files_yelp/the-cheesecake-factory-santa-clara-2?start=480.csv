Susan K.,"West Covina, CA",149,7,4,1.0,5/19/2015,"Why does anyone ever go here ever? (Extra ever added for emphasis.) Our mistake was going to the Cheesecake Factory.  First of all, we waited forever to get water. We did not have bread on the table for over 30 mins and we were ordering appetizers before anything else came.  Food was average. Nonetheless we waited and we ate, but it was the worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. We asked for a refill on our drinks not 1 but 4 times. Not exaggerating at all. After the 3rd time the waiter grabbed our cups for the refills but never came back with the drink until we asked for the 4th time. I really believe our waiter was drinking on the job. To top it off when we were getting ready to pay their computers crashed and we had to wait for the system to go up. HORRIBLE. The tables next to us were all running out of patience for service.  The Cheesecake Factory has been steadily going down hill for years now, but tonight reached an all time low as far as my experiences go.  I'd never ever give this place another dime. Such a disappointment."
Loan M.,"Cupertino, CA",2,6,71,4.0,6/13/2016,"The free bread and sweet butter was delicious.  Great portions.  We ordered the fried eggplant parmesan cheese and it was just ok. However, the baked salmon was very moist.  Highly recommend this place."
Aly B.,"Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/2/2016,Just sat on hold to order takeout for almost 10 minutes before I hung up.. I guess all of the reviews about the takeout service are still relevant.
may t.,"Milpitas, CA",2,9,,1.0,10/2/2016,"Today, had the worse service ever.  For the first time, my husband left NO tip. Sighed. The waitress started out very friendly and pleasant and then it went down hill.  She came back to clarify our crab has egg benedict order.  We never got our food (only two entrees-  a pizza and crab hash eggs benedict). 35 mins go by and no waitress to be found anywhere.  Then other people's orders were added to ours which showed up on cell phone bill. Finally,I had to flag down another waiter and got a manager over.  I almost walked on out. The manager comes over to track down the pizza and found it on counter left UN Claimed served cold. Then I said where is our other entree. The manager ran into kitchen and came back out with the crab has not good and left out the English muffins that was supposed to come with the entree!  All he said was sorry and here it is and will take off other people's charges on your bill and it was mistakes.  We dont plan on going back.  Will go to California pizza kitchen instead. I know restaurant food serving is hard work but today was ridiculous.  This is the second time that has happened.  Another time was my son's bday.  I was told kitchen ran out of ice cream sundae cups so NO FREE bday sundays but go ahead and order a dessert separately.   Management: pay attention to your training of new employees!"
Shreyasi V.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/28/2016,Previously I did not think there were good veggie options here. But tried their veggie burger which was really good.Love their brown bread basket and dessert menu.The wait time can be a bit long.
Carol F.,"Milpitas, CA",65,56,7,5.0,1/15/2016,Came here evening with my friend...we both got salads...i got the luau salad and my friend got ahi tuna salad...both very good! Our waiter was top notch super enthusiastic when we came in and he was very personable and friendly (his name was Drake)...kudos to him! excellent service and food was very good! Also ordered the tropical mojito and that was fantastic too! Yup this place is super bombalicious!!!!
Chris L.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,67,319,4.0,3/20/2014,"Can we be real here...They put crack in their ranch dressing right? That stuff is so damn good! I buy it by the jar - don't judge me.   I don't eat in at this location very often. I generally try to avoid Santana Row and its surrounding areas like  the plague (One can only take so much douchebaggery) but I do pop in here and partake of their curbside delivery and I always order the same thing; green salad with chicken and their stuffed mushrooms. Their salads are always fresh and of course the ranch dressing is scrumptious. The stuffed mushrooms are cheesy and buttery and just yummy.  All in all the curbside delivery is nice, but if you end up dropping in to order take-out be prepared to wait. They are slow as molasses when taking and preparing your order, it's very frustrating - Especially when I've been standing at the damn counter forever waiting to place my order and the cheesecake lady is there pretending to be busy while completely failing to acknowledge my existence or taking a second to call someone that can actually help. A simple ""Someone will be right with you"" will always suffice - take note annoying lady!"
Kim Y.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/22/2016,love this place. great food and great service. specially like the miso salmon you should try it!
Janet D.,"San Jose, CA",104,1216,1381,3.0,5/5/2014,"i am going to have to revise my review due to the fact that the food is just not that good. We had the avocado eggrolls and they were just gross. I had the salmon and a pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes. I was truly underwhelmed. BUUUUUUUUT i did again have the red velvet cheesecake and that is easily still worthy of a four star. Seeing as the food was a two star, i averaged it to you 3. Only come for the dessert  eat somewhere else or pass."
Nancy T.,"Morrisville, NC",505,95,313,1.0,3/28/2014,"Let me start off by saying this was probably the most annoying dining experience I have ever had.  We came in Thursday night around 7. The wait was about 20 minutes, not bad at all.  We were seated and the host handed us the menus. We started looking for what we wanted and decided rather quickly. 15 minutes had gone by, and we didn't even know who our server was. 5 more minutes and the server stops by our table to say she will be right back.  She comes back and asks us what we want to order. I ordered some chicken avocado sandwich and I asked to switch out the French baguette for a soft roll. Our server says that she doesn't think they have that but the menu did. I asked her to let me know so I could change my order if needed.  We also had to ask for the water and bread because she did not bring it out for us. We ordered and the food came out about 20 minutes later.  My friend ordered the same thing as me but she didn't ask for the baguette to be switched out. Our server never got back to me about the bread so I also got the baguette. Another 5 minutes go by without her checking on us. I send the food back to have the bread changed about 20 minutes after we get our food because that's when our server checked on us (finally) and it comes back 10 minutes later with the same thing!!!  By this time, the rest of my party was done eating so I didn't even want to deal with it being sent back again to be changed. I asked for the order to be cancelled with another server because ours was no where to be found. The manager was very understanding and cancelled the order right away.   The service from our server SUCKED. Never coming back."
Amy D.,"Fremont, CA",473,2306,5370,3.0,3/26/2014,"This review is just for the 2 cheesecake flavors I tried that we got to go. We went in on a weekday to pick up two slices of cheesecake, and tried: -Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (Chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake w/Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel,  ): Pretty good, but it was really sweet. I liked some of the layers more than others, and wished they didn't have the two layers of super sweet caramel and huge chunks of peanuts. The original cheesecake and fudge cake layers were really good, as was the peanut butter frosting on top. Although I liked most of the cheesecake, I don't think I would order it again over my other favorites. -Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake (Layers of Rich Brownie, Kahlua Cheesecake, Creamy Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Ganache,  ): Just ok- the Kahlua and coffee flavors were too strong and a little bitter for my liking. Although I really liked the creaminess of this cheesecake, I wouldn't order this flavor again. Overall, I will definitely be back to Cheesecake Factory for their food and cheesecakes (the whipped cream they serve with their cheesecakes is always amazing), but won't be ordering either of these flavors again."
Chantelina J.,"Fremont, CA",139,149,37,5.0,3/9/2015,"It's been a while since my husband and I went to a Cheesecake Factory. The last time we went, we were celebrating our marriage with family at the Union Square location in San Francisco. When we got here, we saw it was packed, but I knew that the wait would be long for bigger parties. Since it was just my husband and I, it only took 15 minutes for a table. And what's great was that it was just as the hostess said: 15 to 20 minute wait. Started off with a Blueberry Mojito for myself and Stella Artois for the hubby. Definitely get a Blueberry Mojito, always! They make it so yummy that I can't taste the alcohol and that can be dangerous for me because then I want more and I'll get drunk way faster than I can imagine. But that's a different story. I ordered the steak diane (medium rare) and herb crusted salmon combo which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the hibachi steak (medium rare) which also came with mashed potatoes and he ordered a side of corn succotash. SO GOOD! Everything we had was definitely up to par and my mouth is just watering just thinking about that salmon though. Lemon butter sauce? PERFECTION. I would have bought a cheesecake for dessert, but my fat ass ate too much good food I had to decline it. AND I LOVE CHEESECAKE. But next time, I will definitely get a taste of that cheesecake goodness!"
Katy D.,"Palo Alto, CA",469,93,224,5.0,3/7/2015,"Cheesecake Factory will always be my favorite Franchise restaurant since it has SOO much to offer!  Always a long wait no matter which location, but that is because everyone loves it here!  I can't get enough of their sweet molasses brown bread, fruit smoothies, calamari appetizers, steak, chicken madiera, salad options, and the amazing cheesecake at the end! Most of the times I am too full to eat cheesecake, so my family and I order it TOGO so we can eat it later! Best cheesecake ever!  I have never really had bad experience with service, as all the servers we experience are very friendly!  Keep up the good work cheesecake factory!"
Amber M.,"Salinas, CA",1,52,4,4.0,5/13/2016,"This was our first time eating here. The food was pretty good, it had a strange take on some classics but still good. We got there just as they opened and we still got our food in a reasonable amount of time. The service was nice and very polite. Portions of the meals were larger than we thought so we didn't have room for cheesecake. But this place was pretty good. I would eat here again. Oh! Beware the terrible music that plays far too loud."
Brian D.,"Campbell, CA",960,1173,284,4.0,5/29/2015,I love this chain.Moderate to gourmet overtones on appetizers over dinners. The dessert selection is high end with a few well known choices. The service is very good here and tables private.Always busy in this mall.Hard to park at times but great food here. All the seared tuna appetizers are my favorite.
James H.,"Santa Clara, CA",144,113,39,4.0,2/21/2016,"I hate coming to the mall area in general. I hate that shoppers come here and take spots away frome when I am coming to eat at this place. But anyways let me get to the point. I love how spacious and big this place feels. I say this because I CE here with a group, so it worked out. Second I have to say the service here is pretty on top. Our food came when expected,  bread service was amazing and I like how they had 3 types of bread and it is all unlimited and their pasta was pretty good. Not bad this place surprised the heck out of me. Now I never ate any cheesecake here, but I am also not a big dessert person so if you are cheesecake lover you are in luck because the selection here is huge. Hence the name of cheesecake factory."
Candi L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",449,284,404,4.0,5/29/2014,"The service is usually very good here! Even on a busy night the wait is usually not too bad! The waiters and waitresses are very attentive and keep up with refills. They have a variety of food items to chose from depending on your mood! I usually get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta or the garlic noodles! Both dishes come with big portions usually enough to bring home left overs! Their complimentary bread is also good! If I do get a slice of cheesecake I usually get the dulce de leche which is my all time favorite! Overall, great service and good food! Can never go wrong here!"
Jeff B.,"Concord, CA",9,69,6,4.0,5/23/2016,We went here for lunch yesterday after the Winchester Mystery house. It was very good. I had my two beers which were delicious. My mom had two blueberry mojitos which was good too. The food was great. The waitress was really good too. Very nice. I love how they are totally ok with rare burgers. The rare burger was delicious too.
Victoria L.,"Soledad, CA",83,10,7,5.0,1/20/2016,"Delicious food, I ordered Thai Wraps and Original Cheese cake to go.  Oh and a very nice waitress, Dominique.  Thank You!"
Sandy G.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/27/2016,awful place. waited three hours to be seated. Their excuse was that they had already called our name when we were sitting right in front of them the entire time. Food was cold and bitter. horrible.
