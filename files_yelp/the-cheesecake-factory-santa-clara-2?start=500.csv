April C.,"Santa Clara, CA",93,119,68,5.0,1/25/2015,"Only a cold hearted, evil, hateful person would not like The Cheesecake Factory. Or someone who's lactose intolerant that one bite of their sinfully delicious cheesecake would cause their bowels to go BOOM within 15 minutes of consumption . Oh wait, I'm lactose intolerant. But it doesn't stop me from eating their cheesecake! And isn't there a children's book called Everybody Poops? Anywho, me, my daughter and my friend went here just to get some cheesecake. I got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. Wooooo doggie! That's some good stuff. They have so many choices in cheesecakes, it's hard to decide which one to choose. Their slices of cheesecake are decent size. I tried to finish mine but couldn't. My daughter was kind enough to take it back to her house for her to enjoy later."
Ter L.,"San Jose, CA",186,821,8639,3.0,5/5/2014,"depending on the time of day you come here, it can get pretty jam packed. parking can be pretty annoying and be aware that you can NOT park in the bank's parking lot. there is security that is constantly walking around.  food is almost always on point here...but there have been a few times where our food comes out on the salty side. eeek.  good customer service and its a very chill ambiance. large parties normally come here and celebrate birthdays, so it gets pretty loud.  nothing makes this place stand out in my eyes beyond their dessert/ cheesecake menu. there is a slice and flavor for everyone!!!!!! on more than one occasion, i come here just to order a whole cake for my family gatherings. pricey but delicious."
Kelly G.,"San Francisco, CA",676,530,288,3.0,5/3/2015,"Meh, Cheesecake Factory is whatever. The portions are way to large, like unnecesarily large. The service was particularly slow the night I went. We had to go in search of the waiter, which is never good."
Stefany V.,"Las Vegas, NV",2182,3981,9961,2.0,11/20/2013,"Notoriously known for their massive menu and calorie counts, I probably shouldn't have come here. But at lest I came when I was cutting carbs, so that did limit how much damage I could do. There was still somehow a 10 minute wait even at 8:30 PM on a Monday night- very odd. We were seated relatively quickly though, at a table with lackluster service- not at all on par with my expectations for this restaurant. BF's dad had the worst luck here- ordered a margarita that was 80% tequila, first time I've seen him not finish a drink in quite some time. He also opted for the chicken tortilla soup, which had only one flavor: spice. Literally seemed like mush accented with pepper. Sent it back to a baffled-looking waitress who couldn't seem to understand why anyone wouldn't love that soup. Did not taste like any other chicken tortilla soup we've ever had, and not in a good way. Also had the salmon wontons, which were just okay. BF's mom had the luau salad which was surprisingly vibrant and huge- I boxed leftovers up and took to work for lunch today. Salad usually doesn't save, especially not when dressed, but other than the crunchy bits being soggy, it held up relatively well. Lots of peppers and a delicious dressing, though I can't recall what it was called and it probably had more calories in it than anything else on the table. BF and I opted to share the tuna tartare small plate and the Boston salad with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch- salad was by far my favorite, it was huge and had plentiful amounts of the assorted toppings, just wish it was tossed prior to arriving at the table, as it was so dark in our particular booth that we didn't figure it out for a few minutes. The tuna was just okay- BF seemed to like it more than I did, and I liked the marinade at the bottom, but just wasn't really my thing. We wrapped up the meal with a slice of the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, shared between the four of us and still deadly- and surprisingly delicious! Crust is made of a pecan sandie cookie, which sounds amazing because it is. Highly recommend that. Our waitress was MIA most of our visit and stopped by to check on us once. Drinks didn't get refilled and Â table was cleared in an awkward and clumsy manner that seemed to indicate she was in a hurry to leave, even though we hadn't ordered dessert- and we had to prompt her for a dessert menu in the first place. Very odd for a place known for their desserts. Will come back because there's a million things on the menu, but hoping for better service next time. Going to try the avocado egg rolls and maybe some seafood in the future. And the peanutbutter cup cheesecake."
Veronica A.,"Union City, CA",119,189,167,4.0,5/31/2014,"Came here for Mother's Day a couple weeks ago. If you plan on coming for lunch or even brunch on Sundays, I recommend coming right when they open because the wait gets extremely busy on weekends and parking can also be difficult to find. I really recommend trying the brunch items, it's really delicious, try the crab cake Benedict! The potatoes it comes with are so good. The waiter we had was so nice and patient, especially on this day where it was so busy. I also ordered a mimosa that came with a strawberry, yum. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu cheesecake which is bommmmb. Be aware, there is the regular tiramisu dessert and the tiramisu cheesecake. Get the cheesecake!  Trust me, come early if you plan on eating here, if not expect a long wait."
Mina C.,"New York, NY",33,51,34,4.0,3/28/2015,"The Reese's peanut butter cheesecake...it melted in my mouth and I went to heaven. Too bad I decided to check the calories after I had already eaten half of it. One star off because the cashier was less than welcoming. As a tip to the Cheesecake Factory management, maybe you should give out numbers to the to-go customers so they don't accidentally take the wrong cheesecake. I would've been pretty upset if I ended up with the carrot cake by accident"
Oliver L.,"San Francisco, CA",92,264,162,3.0,2/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of those restaurants that I've known of but never actually tried...until now. I ended up dropping by with a friend since we were in the area; we ended up waiting for around half an hour on a Saturday night, which wasn't too bad. The hostess did a good job of going through the line efficiently while still being polite. I was a bit astounded at the huge selection on the menu, but eventually settled on sharing the fried mac and cheese as an appetizer, and the Pasta Da Vinci. The mac and cheese was fairly hearty, although the center was still a bit lukewarm and not piping hot. The pasta dish had plenty of flavor and was actually quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the heart attack-inducing portion sizes meant that I barely finished 1/5 of my main dish before admitting defeat. Definitely a very American-sized restaurant, both in terms of food and clientele, if you catch my drift. Sadly I was unable to try the namesake cheesecake for dessert.  Despite the restaurant being quite busy, our server was very attentive and friendly, popping up to refill waters and check on us periodically. She managed to remember small requests, like no ice in one of our waters, throughout our meal.  I can't see myself really ever craving Cheesecake Factory, but it's definitely a solid chain restaurant and I wouldn't mind coming back for whatever occasion demands it."
Mark A.,"San Pablo, CA",73,47,38,2.0,2/13/2015,"Pretty bad front desk service, to be quite frank. We waited 40 minutes and when our buzzer went off, they set us aside for another 20 minutes while they ""accepted"" other people with the same party number. They must've lost our name or forgot about us, and since one of the hosts seemed really hungry (she was sneaking food at the front desk), maybe this was not such a good idea! If you are hungry, don't bother to come here unless you bring your own food while you wait!!"
Li C.,"Brisbane, Australia",6,128,11,1.0,12/2/2014,"This cheesecake factory has killed the experience for us. The star is not for the dining experience. Read the bottom for the star. We were first in on Wed 11/26.  Our waitress? Did we disturb your 11am start of doing nothing until lunch? Or had you planned to sleep all day and were forced to work? Or you just have a bad attitude, period. Well, I was sick as a dog, but managed to continually be polite to you throughout your whole bad attitude. The food? HORRIBLE. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E! Ordered the tortilla soup, the best word to describe it ""ewwwww"" completely inedible. It was like licking paprika off a spoon. Hubs order salmon, lemon, hubs can usually eat anything, this he did not finish.  We sat 20 mins after food served, no drink refill, then sat another 15 waiting for check. The restaurant was empty! Really? Do wait staff in the Bay Area need a GPS, or are we supposed to be feel entitled they're serving us? A little friendly and appreciative service is the difference between the $5 tip you get compared to the $50 we were willing to give. If it had been left up to me you would have got $0. The star is for the staff at the take out counter. We ordered a cheesecake for TG and they were very helpful and patient with choices and serving sizes.  No star for the cheesecake! Cheesecake Factory, what have you done to your cheesecakes? They taste bland and very uncreamy. Before they were rich and creamy, now they taste like sugar, thin sour cream and flavoring. And the cream used to be thick and OMG so good it should be illegal, but now tasteless and like regular whipping cream. :("
Kristina N.,"Milpitas, CA",73,126,142,4.0,12/29/2014,"Today would be my 5th time coming to this Cheesecake Factory location and what can I say, not once have I left unsatisfied. However I'm only giving this place 4 stars because the food is okay, nothing extraordinary and the service is a hit or miss. Came around 2 today and oh my, it was packed! Parking sucks as always and the wait usually are about 20 mins to an hour. Their portions are huge, I can never finish my food so if your appetite is small, I suggest sharing a dish or you can always take it home for later on. Their cheesecakes are pretty amazing, and again one slice can make me full. Anyways, this place is a good place to eat after youre done shopping but if you want something different and more tasty, Santana Row is where you should be at."
Kathy C.,"Cupertino, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Had the most horrible experience buying a cheese cake In Westfield Valley fair location!! My husband and I were shopping at valley fair yesterday, before heading home, we thought it would be nice taking home a cheesecake for a nice dessert at night.  We waited in line for about 15 minutes and finally the ""original"" cheese cake order was placed. We were told the order would be ready in 10 minutes. 10-15-20-30 minutes had gone by, the cake was never ready! With multiple checking in for the order status, we were just feed up with all the wait crap and decided to cancel the order. I can not believe that the order cancelation would need a manager's approval, again we were put another WAIT for the manager to show up at the cake stand !!!!!!!! It was a BIG mistake step in this chaotic restaurant, will never go back to this restaurant any more!!!!!"
Kymm N.,"Salinas, CA",107,8,53,4.0,6/29/2014,"Had a great experience today. Waited for 20 minutes not the 5 we were quoted. Asked for a booth and got one. Â We enjoyed the Spicy Shrimp Tempura appetizer. Â Nothing special but a lot for the $6.95 price. They serve free bread. Â The squaw and sourdough fresh from the oven. Â  We ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad...scrumptious. Â Tuna seared perfect...with a great salad mix , large beefsteak tomatoes avacado and ginger...cleaned the plate. Â My son ordered Steak Dianne and really enjoyed it...such a large portion he didn't finish the smashed potatoes that were delicious . Â  Great service from Jaime T. She kept our glasses full and was very pleasant and recommendations were spot on."
Janet R.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,2,5.0,5/24/2016,Omg. Â Where to start. The bar is awesome. Â Good taps. The desserts are to die for. The spicy cashew chicken is amazing. Service is tip notch and attentative. All this me favorite.....oh yeah.
Lorie N.,"San Jose, CA",524,539,551,5.0,9/24/2013,"I've been here several times and I can't imagine why I haven't reviewed this place before. Â We came here on the busiest day- Â Saturday. Â It was around 3pm and the wait was only 20 minutes but we found seating at the bar. Â In my quest to not give into my sweet cravings, we both opted *not* to have cheesecake on this day which probably defeats the purpose of going to the Cheesecake Factory. Â But, the food was still really good anyways. The bartenders were super attentive taking our drink orders promptly and giving us the awesome bread which I absolutely love. Â We didn't have dessert, but still had the bread. Â Go figure. Â I'd never ordered a sandwich here before so here's what I had: Southwest Chicken Sandwich: Grilled Chicken Breast, Crushed Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, JalapeÃ±o Peppers and Chipotle Mayo on a Toasted French Baguette The above was just cut and pasted from the menu which I do quite often here on yelp since it's hard for me to remember everything I ate. Â In one word, it was ""Yum!"" The toasted french baguette was nice and crispy and soft on the inside. Â The Chipotle Mayo had a nice kick it which wasn't super spicy but gave everything a nice flavor. Â Everything else was just icing on the cake. Â Grilled chicken was great and was so the crushed avocado. Â You can never have enough cilantro in my opinion so having this in the sandwich was awesome too. Â  If I had to pick a sandwich I would get this again. Â Next time I'm coming back for the cheesecake. Â 1300 calories a slice can just kiss my you know what."
Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,3.0,11/26/2013,"I hadn't been to this location in a long time, and now I probably will try to avoid this location because holy cow the wait is long. Way way way overcrowded. No thanks! I know that it just means this place is good, but I can't stand waiting in line to get a table.  You get all that you would expect from Cheesecake Factory. Good service, delicious food, complimentary bread, and if you have room, yummy cheesecake.  Even though it was popping for dinner, our waiter was very attentive and provided speedy service. He would remember to check on it, refill our waters and bread. Thank you!  Some of my favorite dishes: Stuffed Mushrooms Avocado Spring Rolls Pasta da Vinci Fish Tacos Chicken Madeira Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi Steak It's the wait that really killed it for me, but nothing they can do about it."
Melissa T.,"San Jose, CA",349,15,8,4.0,6/26/2015,"We came around 6 oclock on a Thursday so the wait was about 5-10 minutes long. Our waiter was very friendly and patient with us. I got the Pasta Da Vinci, and when it came out the noodles tasted super stale and bland. I asked them to redo the meal for me and they did with no hesitation and even offered me free soup or salad while I wait. While I was waiting the manager came up to me and apologized to me personally for my meal. They came out with my meal again and it definitely tasted better!"
Joy H.,"Brighton, United Kingdom",38,152,91,4.0,1/19/2014,I've been here a dozen times and have never been disappointed. I always order the Pasta Da Vinci - absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the chile relleno burger with sweet potato fries which was also quite tasty! And to finish off we had the amazing kahlua cheesecake.  Would definitely come back soon!
Lena H.,"Milpitas, CA",398,974,860,5.0,11/16/2011,"This review is specifically for Lynna at the bar. She is super amazingly awesome. While waiting for our table, we decided to get a drink at the bar. Lynna helped us right away and even though they technically don't have a mango mojito on their menu, she conjured up something from what she had and it was one of the best mango mojitos I've ever had. I may be a lightweight, but the mango flavor was strong but I still got a good buzz during dinner.  She was super polite and spoke to each customer using their name. She made sure we were happy with our drinks and was consistent with her friendliness with everyone sitting at the bar, even this annoying group sitting next to us. She asked everyone if they wanted to sit at the bar and eat which was nice to know that you could do that if you didn't want to wait for a table. This night, we were set on a table so we didn't take her up on her offer.  Yay for amazing customer service! It really does make a difference."
Sylvia J.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,13,12,5.0,12/26/2014,Loves this place. Good food except the steak. It's not really worthy. The cheese cakes are really good. Good for kids too. They give you very big portion sizes
Anthony B.,"Denver, CO",4,8,,5.0,11/7/2014,"Let me preface this review by saying that myself and the people I dined at Cheesecake Factory with this evening all have years of server experience. Our server tonight was Daniel, who absolutely blew us away.  I can't say enough good things about this experience, seriously. The food was fantastic, (try the clam chowder).... as I am used to with Cheesecake Factory, but tonight Daniel and his service stepped up the game. I will now choose Valley Fair Cheesecake factory over Oakridge every time I choose to dine there.  It's like this guy (Daniel) appeared out of nowhere, refilling our drinks, checking up to see how we were, or just holding a friendly conversation while taking our order.  To top it all off, at the end of our meal, he brought us lemon scented hot towels... Where am I.... A spa? But seriously. Major points because my girlfriend and I had lettuce wraps so my hands were feeling it.  Overall five freakin stars. Will dine again, just to sit in Daniel's section. And I suggest you should, too."

Â In one word, it was ""Yum!"" The toasted french baguette was nice and crispy and soft on the inside. Â The Chipotle Mayo had a nice kick it which wasn't super spicy but gave everything a nice flavor. Â Everything else was just icing on the cake. Â Grilled chicken was great and was so the crushed avocado. Â You can never have enough cilantro in my opinion so having this in the sandwich was awesome too. Â  If I had to pick a sandwich I would get this again. Â Next time I'm coming back for the cheesecake. Â 1300 calories a slice can just kiss my you know what."

Way way way overcrowded. No thanks! I know that it just means this place is good, but I can't stand waiting in line to get a table.  You get all that you would expect from Cheesecake Factory. Good service, delicious food, complimentary bread, and if you have room, yummy cheesecake.  Even though it was popping for dinner, our waiter was very attentive and provided speedy service. He would remember to check on it, refill our waters and bread. Thank you!  Some of my favorite dishes: Stuffed Mushrooms Avocado Spring Rolls Pasta da Vinci Fish Tacos Chicken Madeira Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi Steak It's the wait that really killed it for me, but nothing they can do about it."
Melissa T.,"San Jose, United States",349,15,8,4.0,26/6/2015,"We came around 6 oclock on a Thursday so the wait was about 5-10 minutes long. Our waiter was very friendly and patient with us. I got the Pasta Da Vinci, and when it came out the noodles tasted super stale and bland. I asked them to redo the meal for me and they did with no hesitation and even offered me free soup or salad while I wait. While I was waiting the manager came up to me and apologized to me personally for my meal. They came out with my meal again and it definitely tasted better!"
Joy H.,"Brighton, United Kingdom",38,152,91,4.0,19/1/2014,I've been here a dozen times and have never been disappointed. I always order the Pasta Da Vinci - absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the chile relleno burger with sweet potato fries which was also quite tasty! And to finish off we had the amazing kahlua cheesecake.  Would definitely come back soon!
Lena H.,"Milpitas, United States",398,974,860,5.0,16/11/2011,"This review is specifically for Lynna at the bar. She is super amazingly awesome. While waiting for our table, we decided to get a drink at the bar. Lynna helped us right away and even though they technically don't have a mango mojito on their menu, she conjured up something from what she had and it was one of the best mango mojitos I've ever had. I may be a lightweight, but the mango flavor was strong but I still got a good buzz during dinner.  She was super polite and spoke to each customer using their name. She made sure we were happy with our drinks and was consistent with her friendliness with everyone sitting at the bar, even this annoying group sitting next to us. She asked everyone if they wanted to sit at the bar and eat which was nice to know that you could do that if you didn't want to wait for a table. This night, we were set on a table so we didn't take her up on her offer.  Yay for amazing customer service! It really does make a difference."
Sylvia J.,"Santa Clara, United States",2,13,12,5.0,26/12/2014,Loves this place. Good food except the steak. It's not really worthy. The cheese cakes are really good. Good for kids too. They give you very big portion sizes
Anthony B.,"Denver, United States",4,8,,5.0,7/11/2014,"Let me preface this review by saying that myself and the people I dined at Cheesecake Factory with this evening all have years of server experience. Our server tonight was Daniel, who absolutely blew us away.  I can't say enough good things about this experience, seriously. The food was fantastic, (try the clam chowder).... as I am used to with Cheesecake Factory, but tonight Daniel and his service stepped up the game. I will now choose Valley Fair Cheesecake factory over Oakridge every time I choose to dine there.  It's like this guy (Daniel) appeared out of nowhere, refilling our drinks, checking up to see how we were, or just holding a friendly conversation while taking our order.  To top it all off, at the end of our meal, he brought us lemon scented hot towels... Where am I.... A spa? But seriously. Major points because my girlfriend and I had lettuce wraps so my hands were feeling it.  Overall five freakin stars. Will dine again, just to sit in Daniel's section. And I suggest you should, too."
