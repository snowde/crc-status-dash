Kevin T.,"San Jose, CA",234,235,,1.0,6/17/2015,"Overall Impression: I know the location is convenient... but PLEASE don't go to this place. Oh dear PLEASE don't try this location. Cost: Pretty pricey for what we ended up getting at this location. Taste: It plain out sucked. We ordered an appetizer and entree. The stuffed mushrooms were nothing special and drenched in a copious amount of oil. The garlic noodles were crunchy and stuck together. Yes, they were horribly undercooked and disgustingly also drenched in oil. These chefs do not do it right. Please do not order their food.  Customer Service: Not applicable since I ordered take out.  Ambience/Atmosphere: Not applicable since I ordered take out."
Lynn C.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/11/2016,"This is THE worst customer service when ordering thru catering.  They are non-chalant like you're bothering them with so much work.   To top it off, they're SLOW when you pick up.  I've tried th is place 4 times and each time, they've NEVER been on time with pick up.  I've had to wait at least 20 mins.  One visit I went INSIDE thinking that would be quicker.  Ha...  I was told they would get my order. Instead the hostess forgot about me.  I sat there for 10 mins and finally asked someone else if it would be ready soon.  They told me I needed to check in at the bakery counter!  So I ended up waiting another 15 mins while that person checked on my order.  Stupid me.  I thought ok, well I know things are busy there... I'll give it another shot.  This time I waited for 15 mins. to find out I forgot my wallet.  BUT I had my check book.  I pleaded with the catering hostess to take a check and I would return as soon as I dropped off the order at my office (40 people were waiting for lunch!!!).  I would return right after and pay with a credit card.  I promised her she could cash the check if I didn't come back and it would NOT bounce.  Her answer:  ""I'm sorry, it's against our policy to accept checks"".  Here is $550 worth of food sitting in my car and she's going to take it back to the kitchen.  Not sure what she would do with it.  I told her I've order multiple times with them for $500+ catering orders and I wouldn't reneg on them.  No can-do is her answer.   I told her I WOULD NEVER COME BACK AGAIN and this would get a negative YELP review.  She didn't care one bit.  NEVER AGAIN!"
Patrick F M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/20/2015,"Westfield Mall + Christmas shopping = long lines and wait times at every square inch of the place. We sat at the bar to avoid waiting for a table. The bartender, Latisha (sp?), was wonderful. She made a specialty drink for me that I had while traveling recently that was not on the menu and it was even better than the original. She was incredibly attentive, especially considering how busy the restaurant was. We let both managers know before leaving that she was a true asset. Thanks again for the great food and the tremendous service."
Unniko U.,"San Jose, CA",2,78,1,4.0,1/24/2016,"Dinner date. Atmosphere is right. The long 45 minute wait was not fun. Food is delicious, head a tropical smoothie. Kid menus are on point. Having a great time. Left full."
Shrenik D.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,14,1,4.0,6/29/2015,Excellent food and a great ambience! The cheese cakes are absolutely fantastic. Service can be a little better (faster).
Blanca B.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,21,1.0,4/30/2016,Our waitress was awesome however the food was mediocre to put it nicely. For a place that focuses so much on presentation maybe they should spend more time on taste of the actual food. Went in search of having a great bunch came out disgusted and with no appetite and no desire to ever come back.
Michael K.,"Santa Clara, CA",503,768,46,3.0,3/17/2014,"The wait is usually very long for this location, but I usually have a good time at Cheesecake Factory because of the service, atmosphere, and beautiful dining decor. Our favorite dishes are: Ahi Tartare: This is great starter dish, but it's tiny, so I recommend ordering one for every two people if they all want some. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: OOhhhhh this one is good! A good amount of kick, great amount of chicken and shrimp, but a less than impressive amount of noodles in my opinion. However, this is super filling and super tasty. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: This one is delicious as well! Asparagus, chicken, and penne pasta with yummy spicy chipotle cream sauce. Pretty much all of their cheesecakes I've tried were delicious. I love the Oreo, the Kahlua Coffee, and the Strawberry."
Kathleen H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",247,15,,4.0,7/24/2016,"Came here for my birthday dinner at around 6:40 and was seated after a 20 minute wait. Our waiter was friendly and refilled our bread and water when we asked. I thought the service could've been more attentive, but he was serving everyone in the area we were seated. One of the best parts of The Cheesecake Factory is that the menu is huge, so there's something for everyone. Of course, the warm complimentary bread is delicious, especially the wheat one. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which came in a huge portion (I took half of it home). The pasta was delicious and cooked al dente with a light wine sauce, so it wasn't heavy or greasy. I noticed that I wasn't offered fresh parmesan on my pasta unlike the couple next to me--I'm not sure if it's only offered for specific pastas, but it wasn't a huge deal. The rest of my family ordered the Factory Combinations (two meats) and we were all satisfied with their meals. At the end of our meal, four staff members came to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to my twin sister and I, and also surprised us with small ice cream sundaes too! We already had cake at home for dessert, so we passed on the cheesecake this time. I haven't had their cheesecakes yet, but I'll definitely be back soon for them!"
Wendy Y.,"Fremont, CA",295,615,614,4.0,2/15/2015,"I've been to this particular branch several times and I always have a great dining experience. It's pretty difficult to find parking around here since it is located at the busy Valleyfaire and so many people eat here on a daily basis. Just a note: be prepare to wait on most days! They don't take reservations after 5pm, so I do suggest getting there early or just be prepared to wait.  The amount of different food on the menu is pretty vast. I absolutely love their bread, especially the wheat ones. It's so tasty and we always get refills every time. I don't usually get appetizers here just because I know the entree would be enough for me and I need to order a cheesecake no matter how full I am. You're at the Cheesecake Factory, how can you not order a slice of delicious cheesecake?! As for the entrees, I do tend to get their pastas though. They're all so delicious and very consistent. My two all-time favorites would be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. They have always been pretty consistent to be and I absolutely love them!  As for dessert, all of their cheesecakes are just so great. I do go for the Red Velvet because I absolutely love red velvet. As compared to the other cakes, it's not as sweet and there's that cake-yness to it. Most are just straight up cheesecake or chocolate and that's a little too strong and too thick for me. I do love cheesecake, but eating a whole slice of cheesecake by yourself is a little too much.  Overall, I enjoy dinning here with friends and family. I always have a great time here and I will definitely be back. You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory."
Arnaud H.,"San Francisco, CA",178,55,1,4.0,6/24/2015,"The chocolate bread they bring at the table is delicious. The regular bread is good too. I truly loved the Kobe Burger american style kobe beef with sauteed mushrooms and onions, yummy! Their was a big table (around 25 people) next to us, it was noisy but what can you do."
Sonia T.,"San Jose, CA",209,237,248,4.0,11/1/2013,"Really great place to go to. My husband took me here for our three year anniversary, and it was amazing. This place is kinda pricey due to the higher taxes in the area.  Other than that it is a great place to go to. Very friendly staff, and not too long of a wait. Be very specific where you want to sit at though because the will seat you in a very small area if not. My husband complains the size of the cheesecake is smaller than Oakridge.  I recommend to try it if you are in the area, and are willing to spend quite a bit for a good meal."
Ana H.,"Newport Beach, CA",25,47,36,1.0,4/23/2017,"My hubby and I go to Cheesecake Factory in Irvine Spectrum on average once a week, often with friends. This was our first time to this Stevens Creek location and it is the worse, extremely slow in taking riders, bad customer service, they don't ask if you want bread and when you ask for some they disappear. Told me once they ran out of Steak  Dianne, so I ordered Thai glazed salmon and the manager came by to tell me they don't make it anymore and I should try some chicken curry dish because it was similar to salmon--unbelievable. They need new management and a lesson in customer service. The hot grilled chicken for the salad was cold from the fridge and a different manager finally came to apologize.  The waitress asked us if we wanted water after all our food was finally finished, did not bring a soup spoon for the soup at our table despite two waiters being asked and my brother in law had to go search for one. Don't come here."
Sky S.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,1,2.0,8/1/2016,"Good food, bad service. It was 2 degrees in there. Unless you like being a frozen Popsicle bring a jacket inside. Waiter forgot our silverware twice and when we got our silverware it was dirty barely washed  will not be come back"
Tracy T.,"Portola Valley, CA",1,5,,1.0,10/25/2014,"As a party of twelve we tried to make reservations, however the first time we called, we were told that reservations were not accepted after 5pm.  Ok, when we called to confirm our reservation at 5pm, we were then told that they accept no reservations at all on weekends.  Ok, so we arrive at 5:30, on Sat Oct 25th, and are told 1-1.5 hours wait time.  Fine, we wait.  At 7pm we are told 20 more minutes, this goes on until 7:45pm, when they seat a party of 11 that arrived well after us.  We eventually were seated at 8pm, 2.5 hour wait, strung along in 20 minute intervals for 1-1.5 hours longer than we were told. It seems ridiculous both to not take reservations for large parties, or to miss by 2x on a wait time, and to seat large parties significantly out of order from their arrival time. On top of all of that, they were rude, unapologetic, and generally did their very best to attempt to dismiss us, which includes the manager, and he was particularly rude, sarcastic and combative. I literally have never been treated that poorly by a restaurant reception staff, or process.  Regardless of the food, that kind of service is simply unacceptable."
Diana N.,"Hayward, CA",6,24,2,2.0,1/7/2015,"I don't like to ever say anything negative, but  Cheesecake Factory has disappointed me 4 times in a row. I called and ordered to go and when I came to pick up my food (just the dolce de leche cheesecake with extra whip cream), I still had to wait 20 mins after I had called 15 minutes earlier.  This happened on 2 occasions. A month later...I placed an order to go again for my brother who wanted the meat loaf and I ordered my cheesecake again. Yet again, they took about 30 minutes to get me the food I had placed 30 minutes prior!  When I got home, they didnt even pack the cheesecake!  I should have checked before I left to see if it was in there, but I had already waited the 30 minutes and just wanted to get out to beat rush hour. Finally, I came in to eat with my friend and we waited 30 minutes to be seated (there was no one there at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon).  Once we sat down, no one came to serve us for another 15 minutes... with a completely empty restaurant! I didn't even bother ordering anything to go because Ive already learnt my lesson the past few times.  I prefer to spend my money at small businesses anyways. I suggest everyone does too!"
Marc K.,"Cupertino, CA",1328,508,1100,4.0,11/28/2013,"First let me say that I'm not a big fan of their meals, and the review is only based on their cheesecakes. With that said, I don't enjoy paying $9 for a slice of cheesecake, but it sure does taste good. I've tried many of them and usually not disappointed. Again, their meals don't do it for me. Cheesecake, however, is good."
AJ E.,"San Jose, CA",43,1,,2.0,10/20/2016,"Shoutout to the short asian bitch behind the dessert counter. Waited 45 minutes for my food and tried to tell a playa he couldn't have any forks and napkins cause they're having a ""shortage"".... LMAO and tried to have attitude with me when I'm one the chillest mothafuckas you'll ever meet. This my first review just tired of bad service from people who hate their jobs. And too the child behind the dessert counter hope you get promoted to waitress or something more upscale you bitch"
Chelsea P.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,1,4.0,4/8/2016,"Lunch or dinner, this is always a classic spot to dine at. This location however can get pretty busy during their peak hours. I never mind waiting, taking a walk down Santana Row or going to the mall to kill some time always works! My favorite dishes include the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, practically not even a salad though, it's packed with so much delicious ingredients, the lunch portion is a heaping amount. The wheat (or as they call it chocolate bread) is my favorite! The Buffalo Blasts are bomb as an appetizer too. Overall, food is delicious, waiters and staff are always pretty friendly!!"
Jemille G.,"Salinas, CA",180,113,2527,4.0,1/14/2015,"How can you not like this place, the dessert case alone will suck you in. My favorites are the tuxedo and dulce de leche...oh yeah the food, chicken madiera is hands down my favorite item there!"
Mr T.,"San Jose, CA",0,33,2,3.0,1/11/2015,"We were here for a weekend dinner.  After about 10 min wait they seated our party of 6 at a small table which parallels the wall in the back room.  It's way too small for our party but the hostess was initially reluctant to get us another table.  After waiting a few more minutes we were reseated where we should have been in the first place.   As for the food, I tried out the Ligurian Pesto Pasta but it's too rich/oily and wasn't that tasty.  In the past I've had the Evelyns Pasta which I think is the best vegetarian item they've got.  I've also had the Cuban sandwich, also a tasty item.  Appropriately I think they've got the best cheesecakes in town so you can't go wrong there.   Health inspections reports at shows score of 81/100, which is meh for an (inter)national chain.  Having been in business for a few decades I'd expect them to do a little better."
