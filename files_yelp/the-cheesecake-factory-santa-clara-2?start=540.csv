Jovanna C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",16,15,23,5.0,12/29/2014,"Great food, good service. Small tables BIG portions. Every time I come always gotta take a Cheesecake to go."
Jessica C.,"San Jose, CA",372,167,300,5.0,12/12/2014,Love this place! Closes AND stops serving at 12:30. Always save half your entree so you can have a slice of cheesecake!!!! Peanut butter or s'mores sOOOO good yumz!
JoJo M.,"San Jose, CA",3,29,1,1.0,9/4/2016,"Food is pretty good, but service is horrible. We were told a 40 minute wait, which was understandable because it was busy, but at the 50 minute mark, I saw people that were not even waiting that long getting seated before us. I inquired how much longer and was told we were 4th in line just a few more minutes, well then as I watch I must've counted about 8 more parties getting seated before us, and they also didn't wait that long. I understand a party of 2 getting seated quicker, but I saw parties that were the same size as ours getting seated. When we checked again, we were given the same line of being 4th in line. The girl up front was telling everyone else that they were also 4th in line. This place is good but not worth the bad service. Can't say much about the rest be after being fed up, we left and went to Tony and Alba's across the street since they actually care about their patrons. What a complete waste of time."
Dana W.,"Tucson, AZ",22,50,17,3.0,9/7/2014,"I'm going to write a short one here and I don't care what yelp says.  Food is just normal, it's a chain so nothing great but it's consistent  ... One thing that bothered me was the place is definitely more dirty and sticky than other cheesecake locations I have been to.  No excuses! Clean your floors and use a different rug to clean tables and seats  What's so hard about that??"
Janice M.,"Alameda, CA",663,130,304,4.0,6/3/2013,Old Fave : Steak Diane & Pasta Da Vinci Fast forward 5 years later: now a pescatarian.... My all time fave is the HERB CRUSTED SALMON!!!! So delicious! I love the asparagus garnish as well. I still crave this until the day after so i stretch my food till the next day by eating only half (which satisfies me). I still get the pasta da Vinci if I want to stuff my face with carbs but now substitute the chicken for shrimp. The bread is ALWAYS good here. Fave Appetizer: Calamari Fave Cheesecake: Dulce de Leche. Service here has always been positive. I've seen busy days here so expect a longer wait.  (Located on the corner nearest to the Macy's men's entrance... You can't miss it)
Vanaki V.,"Capitola, CA",1,6,2,2.0,4/7/2016,I ordered lunch especial with no onion I got it with onion and the green salad next to it so not fresh very old with no dressing but the service was good at least
Lisa B.,"Santa Clara, CA",229,272,440,4.0,8/20/2013,"This was a very special day that I was to meet my long 30 years missing cousin.  So I thought what better uplifting place to have a nice time but The Cheesecake Factory.... With the hustle and bustle of the crowed and a full bar.  That my cousin wanted to have a drink before dinner.  So we meet at the bar she had a Peach sunrise blended drink.  She just loved it.  The menu is so big and so many great items to choose from I had the Herb Roast Chicken the sauce it sat on was absolutely awesome !  They give you about a half a chicken.  it came with mashed red potatoes, and carrots.  The plate was so good ! I could n't finish the place so I did take alot to go home with me.  I also couldn't resist taking home a cheese cake with strawberry's on top.   Service was excellent, the waitress was very attentive."
Judith A.,"Manteca, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/6/2014,"Short and sweet review: there was a sharp piece of metal in the calamari that I bit into. Handed it over to the manager before I could snap a picture. Said it was a piece of the basket they cook it in (I think that was supposed to be comforting). At the end, they didn't comp the calamari, so I had to ask for at least half off.  I tried to be polite about the whole situation and so did they at first, but it was just a weird and quite disgusting experience."
Cathy C.,"San Jose, CA",30,77,121,3.0,11/23/2014,Great service... Waiter was friendly and on top of service. Alcoholic beverages are very diluted I would pass. Expect long wait .. Located at a very high traffic mall and area.  Awesome note to mention is they do have curbside to go... Something the hubby and I will be taking advantage of next time
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",3715,733,1722,4.0,11/6/2014,"Quick and friendly service. My friend and I had lunch here today. We sat at the bar. It was a very reasonable price for a turkey sandwich, soup, and salad. Way too much food for one person to finish in one sitting."
Pooshan V.,"Fremont, CA",22,6,,4.0,3/3/2016,"Awesome cake, It test superb. Except cake other food item is okay, not as good as cake."
Melinna L.,"San Jose, CA",122,5,3,1.0,10/17/2016,"This has to be one of the lowest ratings I've ever given The Cheesecake Factory! Let's start off by saying that the girls who sat us down have no sense of customer service what so ever! I kindly asked for my cousin and I to be sat somewhere with some kind of stroller space since my toddler was sleeping and they immediately rejected me by exaggerating on the waiting time for a bigger booth. (30-50) minute wait considering it wasn't busy at the time I was there. And now moving on with the server, who didn't seem she knew what she was doing she took forever on getting us our food ! She brought out one plate at a time and never brought out my daughters pizza. She finally brought it out when I asked for to go boxes and tabs and the same time! Definitely my last time at this cheesecake !"
Angeline Z.,"Santa Clara, CA",59,179,257,2.0,4/21/2013,"I used to be obsessed with this place to snack on their crispy crab won-tons, tex-mex egg rolls, and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp dish, but here are my notes from last night's dinner. Expected: A ridiculous wait.  Arrived at 8:02pm and was told it would be 40 minutes. Unexpected:  At 9:03pm decided to ask why they are running so behind, as I saw two other couples that arrived after us get seated.  The hostess claimed they had already paged us which is complete BS as I had the pager in my hand the entire time sitting with the herd at the foyer with my 8 month pregnant wife, so I was not pleased. However, they did get us seated immediately after realizing their error, but took a while to get seated once they call you up with your pager. Our waiter, Christian was terrible.  Initially a waitress named Jenny got our order and I wish she would have remained our waitress.  This dude never came back to ask if we needed water and only until the very end did he fill up our cups.  Completely ridiculous.  I know they are busy, but come on, do your job. With this experience I will not be returning anytime soon unless I have to, but incredibly disappointed with their service, but the food was good as usual."
jen p.,"San Jose, CA",0,31,1,4.0,10/7/2016,"for a mall restaurant absolutely fantastic sometimes slow service, but most the time great one time waitress forgot to bring dish and so everyone else had food for 10 minutes before it was brought out, and it was COLD . it seems like the manager would offer that dish for free, but perhaps the waitress didn't say anything. we did not ask at that point, we wanted to get out of there  sometimes its loud/crowded  pros can serve large groups food is consistent and good large menu"
Maria Trinette T.,"Sydney, Australia",58,99,77,5.0,9/22/2015,"I will always give any Cheesecake Factory restaurant five stars because I love their cheesecake. It's always so hard to choose which one to order because I'm from overseas and only come to America every once in a while. On this occasion I ordered the new salted caramel cheesecake which hit the spot because I love caramel too. My friends found it too sweet so if you don't like caramel, you probably won't enjoy it as much. We stayed a bit after paying because we had a lot of catching up to do but we didn't feel rushed to leave by the staff. Great service and great food!"
Taisha D.,"San Jose, CA",5,3,3,2.0,4/16/2015,"There's a reason why it's called the ""Cheesecake"" factory and not the ""Tiramisu"" factory.... Lesson learned. Don't order the tiramisu cake."
Amy R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/2/2016,"The service was pretty awful and very disappointing.  The hostess took my husbands name without even making eye contact so that gives you a glimpse. As we were walked to our table there were several dirty yet empty tables. We were seated (she was pleasant and gave us a choice of table which I appreciated).  The flatware was dirty.  We then had 10 minutes to look over the menu and then waited. I grabbed a server walking by to ask if our server could come over. She came over, took our order... She returned shortly with our drinks and only white bread, no wheat, she said they were out.  The food came quickly and it was delicious. The food was why I didn't leave one star. There was no follow up about the meal, she cleared once we were done and brought the check. It was 2pm so we had a late lunch. Very poor training and management if that's the standard."
Medi C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/5/2016,"I'm only leaving two stars for this particular location.  Cheesecake Factory in general has an expansive and pretty tasty menu.  But this location suffers with execution and the manager seems ineffective.  I think he is fairly young and may not be up to the task of running this place well.  I have spoken to him multiple times and he seemed nice enough but ultimately lied to me about compensation for multiple screwed up takeout orders - said he sent me a gift card as an apology. That was four weeks ago (I assumed it would come in 1-2 days) and still no card. And even getting him to make that gesture in the first place was like pulling teeth.  I have had Eureka in Cupertino or Town in San Carlos make mistakes and they do not hesitate to make it right. And I have been back to those restaurants again and again and again.  Restaurant Managing 101 isn't it? If you make a mistake, take responsibility and keep your customers. Responding to Yelp reviews and making empty promises about improved service next time is NOT taking responsibility for your screwups.  I'd call it ""for show"" damage control. (good luck with that) Ultimately, I will never eat at this location again.  Yard House across the street has similar food with way better service."
James B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/4/2016,"Great food, slow service, and hence 4 stars.  Why don't they take reservations?"
Leslie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",245,650,585,4.0,12/16/2013,"I am a frequent customer of this place, but the one in Pleasanton...... This was a first time visit here, this hectic weekend and I found a great parking spot, waited 10 minutes and we were seated...... There are just some things that I can't make at home, plus their bread is a big given here.....so delicious..... The service wasn't up to standard at all, didn't refill water, didn't give us serving spoons to share and no plates....so we used our bread plates throughout the meal.....which were kind of small..... The 4 stars is for the chef here, the food tasted much better than the one in Pleasanton, sauces were much more richer and flavorful, not skimpy on the chicken and overall just tasted better......"
