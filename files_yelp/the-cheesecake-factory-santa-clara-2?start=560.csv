Martha Stuart H.,"San Jose, CA",21,152,8,5.0,4/11/2016,Great food. Good service. There are so many restaurants around here it's so hard to choose. But coming here was. Our server was the best she knew exactly what we wanted like she was a mind reader...lol
Salman H.,"San Mateo, CA",15,98,86,3.0,2/2/2015,"I was extremely extremely disappointed to find out( after several visits) that all their cheesecakes have beef gelatin which we can't eat due to religious restrictions. I feel TCF should mention the gelatin somewhere since we had no idea. we had to ask the server who had no idea either and had to ask the head chef.  The place is quite busy at night so be prepared to wait. the service is not amazing. besides the sad gelatin part which means I will never be able to eat at TCF again, their cheesecakes are usually spot on.  I have always loved their Linda's fudge cake. This big slab of chocolate fudge cake.mmm.. at 9$ a slice its a bit on the expensive side but tastes awesome!  I have also tried their snickers, Oreo, Hershey's, n Reese's cheesecakes which all tasted delicious.  The not so great ones were the key lime pie, white chocolate raspberry, and dutch apple caramel streusel. These ones were sub par especially the apple caramel streusel. Tried their shrimp pasta, and cheese quesadilla once and they both tasted pretty great!  Will not be returning though since I can't eat the cheesecakes anymore :("
Mossi G.,"Newark, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/15/2016,The food was good but the reason it gets 1 star is the fact that I was over charged when it came to leaving a tip. I left. $10 tip but was charged $15. I called the management to notify them and they said they would take action. Be aware of how much you're being charged.
Faisal F.,"Mountain View, CA",1,12,6,1.0,6/24/2016,Absolutely disgusting. There was a tiny piece of stone in the food. Such a big name and food had a piece of stone. Completely unacceptable. Looks like the potato was not washed properly.
SK L.,"Folsom, CA",9,160,,2.0,7/31/2014,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory!  However, I can't think of a time where I was disappointed this much.  This was the first time that I came to this branch.  I went for dinner, and it was not a big surprise that there was a wait, which I don't mind because their good food was worth it.   The workers seating us were really nice and professional.  Our waiter was excellent!   However, I timed the length of time to get my food and it took 28 minutes to get my favorite entree, the jambalaya pasta.  I could tell that our waiter had no control bringing the food over quicker.  He was very kind and let us know it was coming.  He came by our table multiple times, so that made our experience tolerable.  When I finally received my food, the noodles were all stuck together, over cooked, and mushy.  The chicken was over cooked, as it was really tough.  The shrimp was cooked ok.  I probably ate about 1/4 of it just because I was so hungry, and then I couldn't take it anymore and just asked for a box just to look kind to the waiter.  If the food is going to come out that late, I better get food cooked properly. The food also came out so late that we didn't even have time to have one of our most favorite desserts, their oreo cheesecake.  The kids were already going to go nuts because of being there so long and we had to leave.       If food is coming out this late, I at least expect a manager, especially from a popular restaurant like this one to warn us about really slow service or giving a little extra to make the dining experience outstanding, which is what I'm sure the corporate expects from each restaurant.  I wanted to complain so much to the waiter, but because I knew it was beyond his control about the food being brought in quicker and the food being cooked properly, I just let it be.  This should be a 1 star rating but I put it at 2 because of the excellent service by our waiter."
Eddie K.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",349,15,19,5.0,6/29/2014,I love the food I ate for lunch and the employees are so nice and the restaurant is clean and gets busy for lunch hour. I like there dessert and I will eat at Cheesecake Factory with my friend on this Tuesday
Kristy L.,"Milpitas, CA",0,7,2,2.0,3/11/2016,"The service is great but the food was something else... My steak Diane came out rare, like it was bloody. They brought it back and remade it and it tasted fine until I bit into an uncooked mushroom. Sigh Cheesecake Factory you let me down."
Janet N.,"San Jose, CA",1809,1073,2881,3.0,3/15/2011,"My family and I had a late lunch/early dinner or as some may say dunch or linner ... jk, I think I'm the only one who combines words like this. I had the Peach Smoothie that was large enough to share between two and it was garnished with a pineapple wedge and strawberry. The waiter started us off with sourdough and honey wheat bread along with butter. We decided to go family style on the appetizers we had;  Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls Crispy Crab Wontons  Fried Mac N Cheese I decided to have the lunch Cobb Salad, which is still a large portion if I may add. I thought the Smoothie was delicious, refreshing and I appreciated the use of ripe fruit as garnish. The appetizers were good, the summer rolls are TCF's take on Vietnamese Spring Rolls and were edible even for my dad who is picky about places that try to recreate his homeland's food. The Crispy Crab Wontons were incredibly filling and dense with crab meat these have a spicy bite! And the Fried Mac N Cheese was just plain delicious fried to perfection, gooey inside and sitting on a bed of creamy tomato sauce. My Cobb Salad was just that, it was kind of overwhelming and I wasn't found that as I chewed away at my salad there was slices of chicken hidden fork deep into my dish. I do love me some good ol' Bleu Cheese though. For dessert, Banana Cream and Red Velvet cheesecake to share amongst ourselves. It's called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason. These are by far my favorites! I don't know what kind of food this place serves, they have an extensive menu with all kinds of flavors like texmex, asian and american. Plus, this place never fails to keep you waiting for your table. You'd think with a big restaurant and large wait staff you'd get serviced faster. Meh, me thinks not."
Luicidal S.,"San Jose, CA",392,17,14,1.0,7/10/2015,"My coworkers and I come here almost once a week for lunch together during their ""Happy Hour."" It's a great place for us to connect on a weekly basis and we've had no problems in the past. This time was different. Four of us arrived in the bar and lounge area and business was understandably slow for a weekday. Regardless of slow business, our server took 15-20 minutes to even greet us. We then proceeded to order and asked simple questions about the menu and drink specials. She did not know any answers in regards to pricing or to what comes with certain items. The brainless server had to ask the bartender near by all our questions. She then returned and exclaimed to us that she ""hadn't worked a Happy Hour in over a year in a half.""  I knew then we were in for a fun lunch yet we proceed to enter our order. My coworker asked for a burger WITHOUT Thousand Island dressing, my other coworker asked for a small side of fries. Both of these orders were brought back incorrectly. The burger was smoothed in dressing, and we had a huge bowl of large fries in front of us. The server then decided to disappear for another 20 minutes and we were greeted with a new server and we were told he was ""taking over."" The first server wasn't off of work, she couldn't handle working with multiple tables and cowardly made her way towards the back. They attempted to correct our orders but that took another 20 minutes, by that time we had to go back to work. We asked to speak to a manager, perhaps they could comp one of our items or maybe just a simple apology. We received neither. Instead THE MANAGER GRACE, proceeded to argue back and forth with my coworker to the point of shouting. As a manager this type of behavior is unacceptable. She finally comped our burger which was 5 dollars by the way, and then took ONE DOLLAR off our incorrect fries order.  Never will we return to this location and we spread the word to the rest of our team as well. Sometimes people don't want things for free, people just want to be heard and acknowledged. That's what customer service is about, someone should have told GRACE that."
Ashley K.,"San Jose, CA",205,136,65,2.0,11/9/2014,"First let me say we had the BEST server I have had in a while, her name is Ashley H. She always had a great attitude and you could just tell she was happy to be there.  The food however not even close to as good as the service. My husband had a rib eye that didnt taste very good at all, we could have made better at home he said. I got the Shrimp Bistro and sent it back because the shrimp were WAY overcooked. The manager then came out and apologized but they were so busy it took another 20 min for my new shrimp to come out. Once my meal came out it was good though! We got the snickers cheesecake and the tiramisu both were outstanding. Overall our experience was okay, nothing awesome and I wouldnt take any guests there."
steve r.,"San Jose, CA",172,4,,1.0,9/6/2016,Had a birthday dinner with 15 friends.worst service ever.food was terrible.took over 1 hour to figure out our bill.tried to charge us for items not even ordered.there for over 3.5 hours
Yesenia C.,"San Diego, CA",671,235,106,4.0,12/6/2013,"Well I worked at a Cheesecake Factory down in San Diego for a while so I know the standards and this place passes the test. Now I must say it's the smallest cheesecake  and they don't have a patio but they have a great Happy Hour from 4-6 which include $5 mojitos, margaritas & Long Island ice teas and a lot of the appetizers for only $5 which you can totally fill up on.  The staff there are friendly and nice. They are right next to 2 major malls do it gets super busy here but it's Cheesecake Factory so you know it's worth it!"
Maureen S.,"Hollister, CA",3,75,89,5.0,2/9/2016,"I love this place, always great food, always great service! Our server Leslie was absolutely darling. She made our day. Great great service, cheesecake factory is lucky she's there."
Newlife 2.,"Cupertino, CA",1,13,,4.0,5/21/2015,"There is a reason why this place is always packed with so many people. High end interior design, good food, reasonable price. I always order samosa. It tastes even better than the ones in an indian restaurant. I also like the chicken salad, big potion, one dish is enough.  Will come back here again, but I'm afraid of the long waiting!"
Bill J.,"San Jose, CA",1,39,2,2.0,8/1/2014,Expensive and the bartender was not very attentive.  Hello my beer is empty.  How hard is it?
Megan F.,"San Jose, CA",275,62,92,4.0,5/31/2014,"Whenever I come here and don't get my favorite dish, it's either a hit or miss, but I usually get my delicious 4 cheese pasta. It is the most amazing pasta I have ever had and I can never get enough of it. Even when my girl and I go- we split the pasta together and the dinner portion is enough for two! Yum now I'm starting to drool..  The servers here are always pretty sweet too. I have never had a problem with any of them."
Fn S.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/6/2016,"I had a bad experience at the cheesecake factory on stevens creek blvd.  They charge $8.65 for a tiny slice of carrot cake.  They have a huge carrot cake on display, then when you buy a slice, they give you a tiny portion.  Why do they have to be so stingy? It was 6pm, what are they gonna do, save the rest of that carrot cake for the next 3 days?  The manager was not helpful, he could have at least offered a bigger slice of carrot cake, but he thought it was better to give me a refund and take back the slice of carrot cake that was already cut.  Some people just don't have any common sense or have no desire to provide good customer service."
Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,982,176,3.0,11/24/2013,"Something about their mini-corn dogs is a bit off putting. :/ They're too greasy and the texture just...freaks me out. Food is decent and usually served in huge portions. Skinnylicious chicken pasta isn't bad at all, but I tend to find myself always gravitating towards the French Country salad (no beets!) and Chicken parm sandwich. Parking is easy with valet. I refuse to duke it out with someone over parking if I can spend a tiny bit of money for peace of mind. AVOID THE SMORES CHEESECAKE. That's it."
Hoa T.,"San Francisco, CA",5,111,30,4.0,12/15/2015,We came here last night. The wait was not long because we came here on a Monday night. Where we sat was pretty dirty not clean it seems like they didn't clean the seats. The bread was not fresh at all not even warm and their water cups look dirty. They really need to keep the standards of the cheesecake restaurant. I assume it depends where you go and location wise . The food we order was amazing thnakfully it was but the place is pretty dirty.
Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,4.0,1/4/2013,"It's pretty hard to resist The Cheesecake Factory. Who doesn't like to over indulge in classic American dishes? Followed with a 1,200 calorie dessert. It was Game 3 of the World Series and the Giants were out of town. We decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory and watch the game and get a bite to eat before heading over to the Winchester Mansion. The wait was surprisingly short, roughly 15 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is no piece of pie. That baby has about 12 pages of 2 person dishes, yet I had an idea of what I wanted to go with: Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It's never let me down, but once I looked at its nutrition content, I reconsidered. After poring over the menu, I finally decided on going with two items from the SkinnyLicious menu: Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (Mexican); and Flatbread Pizza (Margherita).  The wrap tacos came out and were much bigger than I expected. A trio of butter lettuce leaves filed with chicken and stuffed with avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, roasted corn salsa, and crema. The tacos were a great choice but my only complaint were that they were difficult to handle. Additionally, one of the leaves was already ripped, which made everything fall out immediately. If you have trouble handling the tacos, you can easily make it into a small salad. As tasty as the tacos were, the flatbread pizza was even better. The portion was generous and larger than I expected. The crust was crispy without being burnt and the mozzarella, tomato, and basil all made for a freshly made (healthy) pizza.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with The Cheesecake Factory. The bar was a little busier than usual because of the World Series game, but other than that, it was pretty straight forward on getting a table; our waitress was friendly and gave great service, and the food was great. I would have loved getting my typical Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but I was in no position to break the calorie bank. If you're looking to eat healthy at The Cheesecake Factory, I suggest exploring the SkinnyLicious menu, as the two items I had were delicious, and there's even alcoholic drinks on the menu.,  Ambiance: 4 Stars (out of 5) Food: 4 Stars (out of 5) Service: 4 Stars (out of 5) Price: $$ Overall: 4 Stars (out of 5) Pros: + THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY + Large menu + New SkinnyLicious menu + Portions + Value + Location Cons: - Crowded at times"

If you're looking to eat healthy at The Cheesecake Factory, I suggest exploring the SkinnyLicious menu, as the two items I had were delicious, and there's even alcoholic drinks on the menu.,  Ambiance: 4 Stars (out of 5) Food: 4 Stars (out of 5) Service: 4 Stars (out of 5) Price: $$ Overall: 4 Stars (out of 5) Pros: + THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY + Large menu + New SkinnyLicious menu + Portions + Value + Location Cons: - Crowded at times"
