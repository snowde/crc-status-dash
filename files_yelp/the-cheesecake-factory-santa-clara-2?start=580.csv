Julius Y.,"Milpitas, CA",15,20,1,1.0,1/24/2015,"Terrible service and burnt food. When we asked our waitress  to see the manager grace, she said that management is too busy. This sums it up.. This establishment has management that is too busy to help customers.  When grace the manager came by she said that their food comes seared and burnt. Stay away from this location!"
Anna M.,"Fremont, CA",74,40,31,2.0,1/20/2015,"I knew I should have gone to the Pleasanton location.  This is the third time I've been here that they've ran out of Chicken Samosas. It seems they can't order according to the volume of their restaurant.   I had to ask for the bread they're supposed to bring to the table, and then had to ask for more instead of it being offered.  The reason I gave this two stars and not one was because they offered to comp my entree due to the fact I've been sitting here for almost an hour with just bread.  Although I love the restaurant itself, the Pleasanton location has MUCH better service. 20 min update**** Second entree- Grilled Salmon came out RAW"
Auden W.,"San Francisco, CA",466,409,1116,3.0,8/17/2014,"Let's start of by mentioning the wait... Cheesecake Factory always have decent wait time during peak hours! customer service is mehhhhh... 3.5 stars at most! what I do enjoy is the food... Personal favorite has to go to the shepherds pie; full of flavor and for sure fills a six foot man up! if you feelin ballah, hop on that filet mignon!"
Nicole G.,"Fremont, CA",79,77,286,4.0,12/6/2014,Great fast service at the bar the Americana Burger was delicious our waiter  was friendly and full of energy
Gabrielle L.,"Pleasanton, CA",29,63,9,1.0,8/4/2015,"I'm really disappointed to be writing such a negative review because I've had wonderful experiences in other locations. This, though, was a total disaster. If there was an option for zero stars, I would give it.  Yes, the wait is long, but that is the case in pretty much every location anywhere close to a meal time. What was confusing about it, though, is that they give you the pager but when it goes off they just have you wait some more. When my party was called, there were so many people just standing around the front desk that it took us about forty five seconds to reach the desk, but by the time we got up there, the hostess had already crossed our names off and was calling the next group. Still, they took us, but it was another half hour after being seated that our server actually introduced herself and offered to bring water. I understand it was busy but we saw her only that one time before she asked us to order. So, we ordered drinks, appetizers, and our meals at the same time. We got our drink after about twenty minutes, but we got our bread at the same time the wrong appetizer arrived!! In the end we got our appetizer at the same time we got our meals. We had been sitting for almost two hours before we got our food.   My boyfriend said the fettuccine alfredo was just okay, and I thought that the shrimp scampi was about three stars. The sauce and the pasta were good but the shrimp was very, very chewy (overcooked or undercooked?). It wasn't bad so I didn't send it back or anything, although that wouldn't have been possible because we hadn't seen our server since we ordered.  When we were finished eating, I spoke to our server since it was my boyfriend's birthday and I asked what they could do and she said they give a little cup of ice cream and sing Happy Birthday, which sounded good to me. Well, they never did. There were at least three other birthdays in between the time I spoke to her and the time we left, including one at the next table over, but not for my guy. I felt really bad because this was the only thing we ended up being able to do for his birthday.  While we were eating, there was a particularly fussy toddler across the aisle from us who threw a bowl on the ground, and the hundreds of sharp little pieces hit myself and a few other people nearby, but no one came to clean anything up even though a few of us were sitting there with cuts all over our legs. Our area wasn't very clean at all, likely because they were trying to get people in an out as quickly as possible. There was a fork and napkin underneath our table and not until we received our check did anything off of our table get cleared.  In the end, I wish I'd given a smaller tip. I feel so, so bad that this went so horribly, because it was my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to come here to celebrate."
Breana J.,"Purchase, NY",80,63,101,4.0,12/26/2014,"Considering we came here the day after Christmas service here was pretty good. We had 1 appetizer, 3 salads and 4 entrees. I had the pork chop and it was great -moreso because of the homemade apple sauce and mashed potatoes than the actual pork chop. The sautéed veggies tasted like they were previously frozen and we're extremely bland so I could have done without. But all in all the service and food was great. My sister's order was incorrect and they made sure to take it off the bill and bring her a new dish in under 10 minutes."
T. J.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,22,,4.0,2/15/2016,"This is not an inexpensive restaurant, but considering the portion size (very generous) and the quality of the food, it does provide good value. I never order the cheesecake because each slice costs an arm and a leg, but the main dishes, salads and soups are great.  I usually have a sandwich, which comes with either soup or salad.  Their chowder is the best in town! The service is usually pleasant. The only negative is the l......ong waiting time."
Luciana S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,5,1,5.0,8/30/2016,"chicken costoletta is always large and delicious, can't go wrong with any salmon dish, classic cheesecake to go so I can go to bed with no regrets :)"
Angela K.,"Santa Clara, CA",13,37,98,5.0,1/16/2016,"Day and night, whenever you want! Dessert, drinks, burgers, Italian, Indian, American cuisine, seafood. Any kind of food that you're looking for. And always, lovely stuff and good customer service. Even my husband tries to celebrate our every special days here, I like it :) but you have to be ready to wait for a while, if you dont have a reservation. That is really worth it, though!"
Samantha C.,Bay Area,119,437,510,4.0,2/17/2011,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants! The food is consistent, the portions are huge, the prices are economical, the service is delightful, and the environment is clean. Wait time however can be a bit long, especially if you are accompanying a large party and you come during their peak hours, otherwise its not so bad. My boyfriend and I usually attempt to sit at the high tables by the bar which are on a first come first serve basis. I almost always order their salads, because their entrees are outrageously packed with calories. I love their chicken caesar salad; it is perfect! If you really love caesar salad, like I do, then you will probably enjoy it as well. Others, however, have complained that the dressing is too strong. If you like a bit more of a variety in your salads then you should probably get the cobb salad, which is also good and perhaps healthier.    I also enjoy their fried mac n cheese, stuff mushrooms, calamari, buffalo blast, garlic noodles, red velvet cheesecake, and pumpkin cheesecake."
Christina C.,"Fremont, CA",25,7,19,4.0,12/31/2014,Cheesecake Factory does not skimp at all on portion sizes and has particularly good apps and serts. The service is always friendly and I love their selection of cheesecake!
Evan H.,"Las Vegas, NV",632,105,24,5.0,5/5/2013,"First Cheesecake Factory away from home! Loner status helps me avoid the wait and I walk straight to the bar!  Offered on draft, Firestone pale ale (local California beer), is a nice light refreshment on this Sunday afternoon. My ""Hawaiian"" pizza (ham, onion, and pinapple) comes out in record time under 8 minutes looking, smelling, and tasting consistent and delicious just like I expect from back home! There is so much staff movement and stuff going on that there isn't much chance to interact or chat up the bartenders so maybe rolling up with a friend would have been more ideal. Other than that everything was awesome! Oh uh... Cheesecake? I skipped it. No dessert this time."
Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",40,96,309,2.0,6/23/2013,"Disclaimer: this is only about the service, not the food. I am sure the food is wonderful.  I was planning a banquet for around 20 people and had one of my members call this location to try to reserve a table on a Monday night. They told him that while they did not do reservations past 5:30 or so, they were not busy on Monday nights and that they should be able to accommodate us easily.  Because they had reassured us that it would be fine, we decided to hold our banquet at The Cheesecake Factory. I told my entire group to meet there at 7. I got there 15 minutes early just in case. When I got there, however, I was informed that the wait time would be at LEAST an hour and a half. I informed them about what my member had been told, but they said that no one should ever have told us that since it was impossible to promise seating.  As if they thought that this was a viable solution, they told me that if I split up my banquet into 2 groups of 10, they could get us in within 45 minutes. Needless to say, you can't split up a banquet. And even if you could, that wait time is still way too long. The rest of my party arrived dressed nicely for a banquet but were unable to be seated until well after we were promised. This forced us to frantically call different restaurants in the area to see who could hold a party of 20 right at that moment with no reservation. Luckily, California Pizza Kitchen had just enough room, and we were able to walk there to hold our banquet.  Regardless though, Cheesecake Factory should not have made false assurances they couldn't keep. This is not a rant, but rather a reflection on how Cheesecake Factory could've easily ruined our end-of-the-year banquet simply because they tried to earn our business by saying they could seat us quickly, when they knew very well that they couldn't keep a promise like that. I most likely will not come back to eat here."
Kevin L.,"San Jose, CA",116,134,137,3.0,12/23/2014,Very pricey and pasta is pretty small in proportions even bough they say it's a big proportion. It's $18 for a pasta carbonara and you don't get that much.
Alba M.,"San Jose, CA",1,16,1,4.0,2/18/2016,"For being such a large chain, they do a really good job with keeping up with quality. The food is always good and there are options for everyone. the only thing is that it can take a while to be seated sometimes. Other than that, its great!"
Adamme K.,"San Francisco, CA",3,111,175,5.0,11/28/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always good, especially with such a ginormous menu, but the wait is atrocious. Especially in such a touristy area."
Karen C.,"San Francisco, CA",159,48,78,1.0,12/5/2015,"Horrible pick-up parking and parking overall.
