Inde A.,"San Francisco, CA",43,73,73,1.0,12/19/2017,Ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta which I've had countless times at many different Cheesecake Factory locations. The entree came out with soggy linguine sitting in a pool of water. It was a pathetic attempt at cooking pasta. I sent it back right away and left. On my way out I spoke to a manager named Jason. His lame attempt at explaining the issue was that a couple different sauces go into the jambalaya entree. Not sure what that has to do with over cooked pasta that wasn't drained properly. Avoid this location - it has gone downhill in recent years.
Elaine T.,"San Francisco, CA",46,12,64,1.0,12/2/2017,"Lack of service sucks! Poor customer service.  The waitress served 3 tables that arrived after us. Place wasnt even full at 4pm.  I complained at the Host Station. They gave a weak ""sorry"".  I think it was the manager who was at the Host Station also, he was wearing a red/burgundy shirt.  Very disappointing to have had driven all the way from San Francisco to eat at Cheesecake Factory for my early birthday treat and not get served.   We did buy a slice of cheesecake to-go  before we left the place.  We went to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) instead,  which is in the Mall.  Fast friendly service and their Chicken Picatta at CPK is great!  They served us water and bread right away after being seated. Great customer service at CPK.  No problem with the food that I have had at CF before, but if they can't serve it to you........"
Celine L.,"San Jose, CA",22,225,341,4.0,6/29/2017,Service was fine except for the lack of straws. We ordered the steak Diane and the Chinese chicken salad. Both taste pretty standard. The steak was cooked medium which was good. Clean and run as expected of Cheesecake Factory.
Amy N.,"Milpitas, CA",72,4,,2.0,12/9/2017,Took well over 40 minutes to get an original 7 inch cheesecake. With no heads up... Didn't know it was fresh to order in the back.... One person doing all the work while two others yawning the whole time. Giving it up for the lady doing everything she can though. 40 minutes is still 40 minutes.
Nicole G.,"Union City, CA",183,316,470,4.0,12/3/2016,"Food: California omelette with wheat bread, potatoes  Chicken samosas with dipping sauce  Food was good and filling. Can't miss the hot warm bread and butter! Drinks: coffee and Diet Coke  Ambience: bar seating Staff: very friendly and attentive  Parking: mall parking during the holidays. Good luck Overall Experience: we sat at the bar and enjoyed our service."
Tessa H.,"San Jose, CA",133,19,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Not sure what was the purpose of Cheesecake Factory asking me to reach out to them for, when they never followed up on the steps they claimed they would take to try to investigate this incident.  After I got their Yelp response:  1st thing I did:  I went to their site link, inputted a message that they wanted to talk to me, provided my # for them to call.  Later, I got a call from a guy from corporate who was very nice and seemed genuine in passing the message onto the real guy who is in the ""Investigation Dept"" (who was out of the office on time off).  A few weeks went by, nothing.  2nd thing I did:  I called back to corporate and asked to talked to this ""guy"" in the Investigation dept. He didn't seemed to know of my story (perhaps it was never communicated to him) and came off flustered. After telling my story again, he said he would look into it but that without any tangible evidence or police report, this was going to be a tough one.  Hmm...well of course the police never got involved but given how things played out, why not go interview your employees or review the tapes from the cameras at this location? Or at the very least, update me on what you're actually doing? Anyways, still no call or email from them and it's October. Seriously, this was all just a waste of my time. Thanks, but no thanks."
Tiffany A.,"San Jose, CA",251,35,28,2.0,12/10/2017,The lady that helped me was utterly distasteful and rude. Like I was an inconvenience. I only came in to pick up a slice of cheesecake. That'll just take 2 minutes out of your shift tbh. I was in and out. I expected at least a little professionalism. And the slices here are so SMALL now. I haven't gotten one in a few years and they must've really downsized. 9 bucks for a small slice is not worth it. I should've just went to the grocery store next door.
Moushumi K.,"Atlanta, GA",3,70,171,1.0,5/14/2017,"What can I say, I love the desserts of Cheesecake. Experience at this chain establishment has always been consistent across different cities, food and service. Um, not quite at this location. Far from it. I get it, it's Mother's Day and every restaurant in town is packed. And hostess tell you what the wait time is - pretty straight forward. Again, not at his location. Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. While checking out the menu at their bakery section, the guy behind the counter took down my reservation and said wait was 45-50 mins. 20-25 mins later I went to check. Lo and behold, my reservation didn't make it because ""bakery doesn't do reservation"". Apparently, I should have known booking a table meant I should have gotten one of their table buzzer. Um, no. YOU should have given right info. Also? He wanted me to ""describe"" the person who took my reservation at the bakery. Where am I, at Cheesecake Factory interrogation room?! Incompetent. All the above from the ""manager"" Jason. OMG. Condescending, patronizing with a complete fake smile. His tone? Suited when addressing kids. Are you kidding me? Jason, get retrained or find another job. Get it? The entire review is on their disastrous service and COMPLETE disarray at the front entrance - face of a restaurant. As for food? Didn't wait around to find out. 1.40 hours wait because you messed up AND insinuating *I* should have know how the system works? Um, No. Yard House is right across. Go there instead. Rating deserves minus 5, 1 star is too generous."
Jaane F.,"San Jose, CA",72,278,1970,4.0,11/3/2016,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory for 3 times. I had my first time here for my birthday with my family, and then the next 2 times were with my friend and bf. The staffs here were nice and courtesy. They even sang me birthday song last time.  The food portion here kind big for me. I usually need to share with someone or pack for the rest. I usually like to order pasta. And I also like to have their cakes. The Godiva chocolate cake is good! I tried different cakes , they are all good especially with cheese cake. I can tolerate the cheese flavor even though I'm not fancy with cheese."
Marcus-Alex G.,"Davis, CA",175,56,9,4.0,10/3/2017,"Tried it once a long time ago, wasn't too impressed, but tried it again last weekend, and it was pretty good. Totally underestimated this place. Their desserts are definitely  , but even the dinner and appetizer was pretty good. I got the miso salmon and the sauce was amazing, got super full way too fast though. Service was nice and overall good experience."
Ricky H.,"San Jose, CA",30,9,7,4.0,5/31/2017,"It was a long time since i last visit. My friend from Penang suddenly request me to bring her here. This place is awesome, but too bad that parking is limited, and need to pay extra money for jokey parking service. The service and environment is good. The design of the restaurant is so beautiful, but the food is just so-so for me. No surprise. We ordered a black velvet chocolate cheesecake. Cake is creamy and topped with crea m cheese icing. Thumbs up"
Kaylee B.,"San Jose, CA",6,1,,1.0,12/19/2017,"This is a really beautiful and good restaurant but the service is horrible. Me and my family and here and we were just ignored by the waiter. We tried to get his attention but he kept ignoring us. I will never come here again until there waiters are nicer, and more caring to their tables, this is unexceptionable that they do this."
Mercedes B.,"Renton, WA",83,29,8,1.0,11/13/2017,"So I was in California for the Niners game and we decided to go out for celebratory dinner afterwards. MY GOD. We waited over 45 minutes to even be seated, plus at least another 30-45 to get our food. On top of that, I got the wrong meal but ate the random ass food bc it would of been another 45 for my correct meal to be made and I had a flight to catch. I was shocked at it. I live in Seattle and even on its busiest days it's not like the this and the food is at least correct and edible. PLUS, their rude ass bald headed manager was completely oblivious to what good customer service is and how to even treat his own employees."
L D.,"Newark, CA",0,115,3,3.0,1/5/2018,"I always love this place... the foods are just for me... especially jambalaya and tiramisu.  However, in this location, parking is very hard plus the waiting can be from 1-2 hours... the last time I went was during my bday, even though the service and the singers were actually great, but those 2 hours of waiting were killing my mood."
Evan R.,"San Jose, CA",0,39,25,1.0,11/24/2017,"Confused girl answering the phone doesn't know if they offer curbside togo still.  Then she abruptly announced she was transferring me to the bakery, and left me on hold for a total of 15 minutes.  I called back after the first 5 and she did the same thing again.  She implied there was nobody else ahead of me, so I can't imagine why they can't manage to answer the phone or handle a togo order.  If your'e going to answer the phone I think you should know basic stuff like that, its a very common question and something their location was known for.  The mall h as been getting a lot of parking lot remodeling though so I wanted to double check, or at the very least just place a dang order.  It's been almost 20 minutes now.  Going somewhere else."
Annie L.,"Sacramento, CA",145,61,79,1.0,8/27/2017,"I hope management sees this.  Normally, my experience at The Cheesecake Factory is great. The food and service are always consistent except for my last visit. This negative review is solely based on the service my friend and I had.  Jessica N. was our server during brunch. I can say with confidence that I've never received such rude service from any server as I received from her.  We ordered two pasta dishes and one Bloody Mary. During our meal, I took only three sips of my drink and really did not like it. When we got our bill, I asked her if she could take the drink off the bill since I hardly drank it and was unsatisfied. She replied by yelling, ""WELL YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME BEFOREHAND."" What the hell? I was so taken back by her response. The two tables beside us both told me that what she did was incredibly rude and suggested that I shouldn't tip her. One of the guys even said, ""I'm glad she wasn't our server."" Please address this."
Susan L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",16,6,,4.0,1/5/2018,"Shout out to the bartending staff. Once in awhile for a treat I stop in for a quick lunch on a Friday (non-alcoholic!) and they are always super friendly and conscientious about trying to provide a good dining experience. Today, my order was inexplicably late and Justin, the bartender on duty, kept checking with the kitchen, apologizing, and giving me updates. A manager came out to apologize too even though I kept assuring both of them that I didn't mind today, but would need to get the meal boxed up to go if the wait time was much longer as I had to get back to work.  Finally, my order arrived, and to my surprise Justin also offered a complimentary slice of cake to make up for the long wait. Awesome! In other news, it's too bad about the mall renovation going on nearby - I'm sure this intimidates some new customers with the parking situation. But if you want a family atmosphere, friendly service, variety of choices,  and mostly generous portions, this is a reliable place for just such an experience. P.S. Letitia @ the bar on Fridays is great too....there are a few wait staff who have been there forever who are always friendly and helpful as well."
Gonzalo O.,"Santa Clara, CA",17,227,74,4.0,9/22/2017,"About 6 months ago I decided to jump the gun and order a gift for myself, a 150 dollar gift certificate for The Cheesecake Factory.  I figured since I have a sweet tooth and I could put my "" money where my mouth is "" ( literally ) :) I would kill two birds with one stone and get a slice of cheesecake every now and then and not spend all my money on them, and I would have money here and there to spend on other things.      Let me tell you I was RIGHT!  Buying the gift certificate was a stroke of genius!  I go to The Cheesecake Factory every now and then for a slice of cheesecake and I don't feel guilty about cos it's not like I'm eating it every day, every week, or every month!  I just go when I feel like it, and yesterday I went to have a slice of their Hershey's cheesecake and it was WOWZERS!!!  Better than the Oreo cheesecake, and the Godiva one, BAR NONE.  I haven't yet tried their Snickers cheesecake but that is next on my list to see who is winner in the Pantheon of top chocolate cheesecakes.  If you love cheesecake just buy your cheesecakes from here.  I really don't know of any better place to do so, and it is worth the money you spend here!"
Vivian C.,"Stanford, CA",185,235,391,3.0,3/27/2017,"ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION! We waited for 45 minutes on Saturday night! So learn from our mistake!  Service was a little wonky when we went! One order took too long because it didn't meet restaurant standards. And another order was confused and the wrong dish was given to us and we realized it was the wrong dish and they said they were looking for that dish! But, service gave us a free side to hold us over. We really like their dark brown bread so we asked for only brown bread, they gave it to us without question or judgment. That was really appreciated!  Food is yummy per usual except it came to us lukewarm rather than piping hot.  I got the factory combo with salmon and chicken madeira. Yum! Wish it came with more sauce though!"
