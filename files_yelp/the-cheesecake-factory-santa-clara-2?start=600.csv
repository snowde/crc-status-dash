Bharat S.,"Fremont, CA",0,28,3,3.0,1/5/2015,"Love coming here, but the service can be quite slow at times.  It's pretty loud most of the time.  The four cheese pasta, while pretty cheesy, is really quite good.  My family really loves dining here.  However the noise and the slow service is really disturbing at times. Also, it is such a long wait!!  Last time we had to wait for more than an hour and we had gotten there around 6 pm...pretty early to have dinner to begin with."
Linnea E.,"San Jose, CA",364,689,145,4.0,4/21/2011,"Great food and drinks!  If you want a great drink, ask for a lemon sunburst! They took it off the menu, but most of the bartenders still know how to make it.  OMG sooooo yummy!!!  For food, you have to try the avocado eggrolls... mmmmmm! Service is usally pretty good too.  I love that they don't rush you, which makes it great for hanging out with friends.   Happy hour in the bar has a good selection of munchies at decent prices.  The bar area is fairly small, so it does fill up quickly for the self-seating."
Genevieve S.,"San Jose, CA",4,26,,4.0,12/10/2015,"We floated in here unexpectedly last weekend after miraculously finding a parking spot.  It had been YEARS since I'd been here and were pleased to find they've added a ""healthy"" lite menu.  We tried a few things on it and all were really good.  The regular menu has way too many items on it though and is very overwhelming.  Not to mention you should probably check with your cardiologist before ordering a few of the things.  Service was really good and they were busy!  It was a nice surprise and we'll definitely return."
J. W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,19,,4.0,1/19/2016,"This is the perfect place when you are hungry because of the portion. However, it could be the worse place when you are hungry because of the wait. Take your pick.  Their pasta is very rich in flavor but very filling at the same time. Remember to save extra room for dessert or you might end up kicking yourself watching other people's orders."
Jenny L.,"San Francisco, CA",151,562,189,4.0,8/20/2012,"What's not to love at Cheesecake Factory?  Their food is always consistent (at least the times I've been here).  The only thing that varies is the service.  And my service here has almost always been superb.   I don't go too often, but when I do, I almost always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta in lunch portion.  I'm never able to finish it.  Dinner portion is like...3 meals for me.  It's carb overload and absolutely delicious with thinly fried pieces of chicken breast on top.   In the few cases that I've left enough room for dessert, I get the Godiva cheesecake.  OMG.  Pure luscious, velvety truffle cheesecake.  There's something about chocolate and cheesecake that goes so perfectly together.  The original with strawberries is also another favorite of mine.   Writing this review is making me hungry.  I must go back soon!"
Lilian L.,"South Bay, CA",129,526,116,4.0,4/10/2013,"QUICK FACTS: I've been to this location MULTIPLE TIMES  & I actually HATE The Cheesecake Factory -No dishes ordered were ever good P.S. (the sweet potatoe fries here aren't great) I HATE CHEESE!  ------ However this review is strictly base on this one visit with an amazing dish: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ""Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. Also available over Rice""- from their site The dish was right on almost with proportion, a little too much, but less than the other dishes I have seen. The dish is a must-try, It's hard to get things at this place because its either not good or all the good dishes are cheesy and creamy which I can't eat (I get sick) and it doesn't taste great for me. ---- Service: the waiter was super nice. Wait: Terrible as always, not as bad for tonight, pretty shorter than experienced before.. The only deal with this chain is how they won't split bills. (they will for say 3-4 people in a huge group but that's it) And I don't understand the weird table setting we got..."
C.Michael T.,"Campbell, CA",248,50,,1.0,12/2/2015,"I had lunch at this restaurant.  The wait staff was super led by Irene and Donnie.  They were spot on.  Friendly and attentive.  The best ever.  What I was upset about was that I asked to see the manager to tell them what a great staff he had. The manager on duty was Brian.  However, after a five minute wait, I left very discouraged to see that he felt that it was unimportant for him to make an appearance.  Higher management take note.Also I really feel that management should be on the floor during lunchtime.  Any restaurant at lunch and dinner time can use an extra hand."
Jackie C.,"Santa Clara, CA",62,66,,4.0,6/20/2014,"Regular spot for me, I love getting together here for cocktails, they have good soup on certain days and so much variety of foods!  Great place for a date, get together or just a friend outing! Cheesecake is great too!"
Joy B.,"San Jose, CA",18,106,36,5.0,11/5/2014,Oreo cheesecake is FAB Service/Staff definitely varies and you can't always be guaranteed that it's up to par. We've had our share of good and bad waiters attentive and not attentive. The one thing that makes us always come back and bring a guest is the chef. We have always had excellent food. We try to avoid Saturday or Friday nights because it's not worth going through.
Ocean B.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/8/2016,This review goes for all cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The food is really bad. It is so oily. I feel sick every time I eat their food ( I only eat the food here if I have to) Please shrink your menu to like 1/4 of what it is now and focus on making healthier food that is not drenched in oil.  Why is your menu 100 pages ??  Really bad!!!!
Sunny L.,"New York, NY",47,23,141,3.0,11/19/2015,The decorations are fun but the quality of the food is okay. Things come in big proportions and plates are generally too fried or too salty. Having one bite of each plate is tasty. Overall service is great though!!
Daniel H.,"San Jose, CA",507,1495,8561,3.0,10/10/2010,"I've been here a few times in the past but I guess I never reviewed this place. I came here recently for my friend's birthday dinner.  I don't think we waited that long to be seated.  I was the only one who didn't order steak, but I also didn't want to spend so much money on steak even though I was kind of craving it.  Two of my friends ordered Filet Mignon ($31.95), one ordered Hibachi Steak ($19.95), and I ordered Four Cheese Pasta ($12.95).    After the waitress took our order, we did nothing but wait.  Sure the bread came out but after that the wait was so long.  It almost felt as bad as my experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory in terms of waiting.  I remember the last time before my most recent visit was also slow. Our food FINALLY came and we started to eat.  I tried a piece of my friend's Filet Mignon and a piece of my other friend's Hibachi Steak.  The Hibachi Steak tasted pretty good and I liked the flavor.  The Filet Mignon was also pretty good.  My Four Cheese Pasta was alright but I would have liked more chicken in mine. All said and done, this Cheesecake Factory location has very slow service.  If you don't mind waiting a long time then come here. 2.5 stars."
Hsiuhsien L.,"Rogers, AR",1,6,10,5.0,1/2/2015,"Luckily, it took only 10mins to get our table! What I love about this place is the menu has variety to satisfy my family's taste!  Always save some room for SOME cheesecake !!!"
Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",446,567,3746,5.0,12/18/2012,"The Chicken Bellagio is soooo good!!!! Perfectly soft yet crisp outside pan fried chicken breast finished with prosciutto and arugula sitting atop al dente pesto pasta with just the right amount of yummy white cream sauce mmmm don't be afraid to overload it with Parmesan cheese either. Mmmm makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Definitely go for the Shepard's Pie if you want something filling and buttery tasting! Tender and flavorful chunks of ground beef sautéed with peas, slivered carrots & cucumbers, onions, mushrooms! crowned with a hefty portion of their to die for buttery mashed potato goodness! You know something is good if you savor the flavor even when completely full. Their mashed potatoes hit the spot every time! Expect leftovers to take home unless you're sharing this dish.  The shrimp bistro pasta is worth a shot too-- lightly breaded and fried shrimp on a bed of pasta with lemon cream sauce and now that I think of it-- capers! I love those! The macaroni and cheese burger is ok. Their Caesar salad is good! Cheesecakes I've tried & recommend: -Red velvet: smooth and delish! Plenty of white chocolate curls on the edge, moist red velvet cake alternating layers with their smooth original cheesecake -Oreo dream extreme: my new favorite! Traditional Oreo crust beneath a mound of yummy cheesecake filled with whole Oreo cookies! It's more complicated than that but just take a look at a picture =] top it all off with chocolate cream icing and whipped cream -Snickers: a must try if you love chocolate bars! Each bite is filled with creamy cheesecake and chunks of caramel, peanuts, nougat, and of course chocolate!  -Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple: the favorite of one of my best friend's (she's in love with peanut butter) peanut butter cups, fudge, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter topping that's seriously too sweet but this cheesecake has got it going on!   I've also tried the one with macadamias/caramel/white chocolate and the caramel pecan turtle-- they're alright. I'm not a big fan of caramel IN my desserts. Maybe on it is fine.  -Chocolate chip cookie dough: simple and sweet, reminds me of the days we ate cookie dough straight from the package, or was that last week ... One waiter I must compliment is Jesse J. He strives to be the best without even breaking a sweat-- it's all natural to him. My friend and I had him twice, and good thing we did because the first time he took over for another waiter that really shouldn't have been working when it was obvious he didn't care much for the customers. Jesse was the relief we needed after our past server was seen in the back chatting with fellow workers when I needed to follow up on my order when it was his fault in the first place for not getting it right (I had asked the waiter for a macaroni and cheese burger and then he asks me what kind of burger I wanted?? I thought he meant there were choices in patty so I said I didn't know and he wrote down classic. Umm hello?! Mac & cheese please! Plus I said I wanted the Caesar salad instead of fries and he asks ""with fries?"" DUDE! What planet are you living on?!?!) Enough with the nameless waiter I didn't bother getting the name of!   Jesse goes above and beyond! He always anticipates our needs right before we ask! Our waters were consistently filled, we were given more bread without complaints, he asked about boxes for leftovers, and didn't even ask for the 50% cheesecake Facebook print out a few months ago-- he just glanced at them AND knew which cheesecakes to deduct from (ordered cheesecake to go also). Some servers use the discount on the cheapest item on the bill but ours didn't and I'm happy for that. Businesses should have more employees like this-- we're sure to come back because of people like him."
Sam S.,"San Jose, CA",325,145,55,5.0,10/4/2015,I don't understand why people give anywhere less than 4 to Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistently great. Portions are beyond generous and the staff are super professional and nice.
Jessica L.,"Silicon Valley, CA",276,275,453,4.0,8/5/2012,"Things I recommend: Chicken Madeira Farfalle with Roasted Chicken and Garlic Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad Chicken Bellagio Pasta Da Vinci Luau Salad Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Fresh Grilled Salmon (toss up depending on how they prepare it) Famous Factory Meatloaf lunch special (best bang for your buck) We all know you can come here with a small group, large group, or anything in between. When you come to Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect. It may be great one time, horrible the next, either way there are some great choices on their menu, you just gotta find them."
Kay L.,"Santa Clara, CA",6,24,,3.0,11/24/2015,"2 stars for food and 1 star for service. The waiter wasn't very friendly. He spoke with no emotion at all. Doesn't seem he enjoys working there. Warm crab and artichoke dip - not recommended. Don't taste any crab or even artichoke. Bland, too.  Fried shrimp platter - okay. Cole slaw had too much mayonnaise. Too much fries. It was my birthday, but they no longer serve cheesecake for birthdays. Only a tiny whipped cream sundae (with very little vanilla ice cream). It wasn't worth the wait. They used to serve a slice of cheesecake with a Happy Birthday message on the plate.... Too bad."
Mitch M.,"San Jose, CA",7,147,47,5.0,8/30/2014,At least 2x a month and get the same thing....spicy cashew chicken.  The service is grrat.  They have tvs.   And they generally do not like to see you with an empty glass. 5 stars 8th my book and why I keep coming back
Shaila B.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,2,1.0,4/27/2015,"I have always been a very patient person. I try to be very understanding, however the Cheesecake factory at Valley fair really pushed the limits. Now, keep in mind this has nothing to do with the food, just the customer service at this particular Cheesecake factory. We had a very large party for a special event between coworkers. My job is VERY customer oriented, so ALL of my coworkers know the value of making the customer feel HAPPY and WELCOME. So here's the deal. My coworkers called the cheesecake factory to make reservations for our large group. They did not take reservations... no problem! One of my coworkers was sent to the Cheesecake Factory to put her name down. She was informed that we would not be seated until 80% of the table was there. No problem, everything is still normal.  Now here is where the Cheesecake factory REALLY dropped the ball. They gave away our table not only once, but TWICE! But it gets better- they didn't even inform us about the situation. We were informed that Marsha, the manager ""did what she had to do."" Well, Marsha, I'll tell you what you have to do.... Inform your customers as to when you'll be making them wait over an hour for a table that you'll be giving away TWICE with no warning. It's really not that hard to do. That being said, we took our money to California Pizza Kitchen where they IMMEDIATELY accommodated our large group at a late hour (due to the ludicrous wait at Cheesecake factory) and we were treated with the upmost customer service.  So- if you have a large party, or really even a small party- take your money somewhere that you'll actually be treated with CUSTOMER SERVICE- such as California Pizza Kitchen."
Paul D.,"San Jose, CA",89,275,,3.0,10/5/2015,I use to eat at the Cheesecake Factory a few times a month. I feel like the food quality has really gone downhill. My favorite item was the chicken piccata. If you love cheesecake of course this is the place to go for dessert. I would recommend to order very light because the dishes are very large so it's hard to have enough room for dessert. I hope they improve the food quality.
