Stephanie B.,"Tracy, CA",577,630,900,4.0,11/4/2010,"I've been getting the same thing since I can remember. The chicken madeira has always been my favorite.  I love the baked on mozzarella, the mashed potatoes, and the asparagus.  The entire dish is just paired so well! This time I did something different.  I ordered a cheesecake, which i've never have done before.  Which is a little silly, but whatever. I ordered the banana cream cheesecake (I really hate anything banana flavored) and I loved it! It had a hint of banana and an entire sliced banana on the side.  It was actually quite good! It has given me a new outlook and it makes me want to come back just to try all their cheesecakes."
Catherine L.,"Palo Alto, CA",22,878,3421,4.0,1/6/2011,I went to my honeys house and he told me to look in the fridge. Thinking there was something yummy and salty for my tummy I briskly walked over. To my surprise there was a huge slice of my favorite cake-- red velvet! This particular red velvet had layers of cheesecake between the decadent and perfectly moist layers of red delicious cake batter. I had way too much cheesecake as a pudgy kid growing up so I'm kind of tired of it as an adult but I felt like a kid again while I devoured large forkfuls of cake and airy cheesecake which didn't have a heavy aftertaste (which I very much appreciated it not tasting of). The two piped whipped cream balls are really light and it tasted of fresh whipping cream. No Reddi-Wip for me :)! Yum!
ROBIN H.,"San Jose, CA",8,10,1,1.0,4/4/2016,Called in an order for 5 salads for pickup during lunch. Was told 30 minutes. One hour wait.
Amanda K.,"Modesto, CA",17,19,30,1.0,1/30/2016,"I stopped here to get dessert to take home.  The line was outrageously long, which I was happy to wait though, because cheesecake is delicious.  The bad thing is, they have zero method to their line and people were pushing, shoving and stepping on one another.  Again, I was okay with that because, cheesecake. It's delicious! I finally got up to the front to place my order, which I did and I was told it would be another 10 minute wait.  No problem, because cheesecake, but, as I was watching the cheesecake being packaged, I noticed that two young ladies were wearing gloves, while the girl handling mine was using bare hands.  I quietly called the manager over and expressed my concerns.  She apologized and offered to have it repackaged by someone wearing gloves.  I was extremely happy (you know why!!!) The manager did tell the girl to put gloves on (and she washed her hands first) buuuuut...as she was preparing the food, I saw her WIPE HER NOSE with her gloved hand then continue to prepare the food, without changing her gloves or washing her hands.  GROSS!  I said something to the manager, again, and her response to me was, ""So do you want a refund?"" No! I don't want a refund! I want the cheesecake I drove over an hour to get!  What I want is for your staff to be trained in food safety and for your management staff to enforce it!  I finally have my cheesecake (yay!) and am heading home to eat it.  Here's hoping it was worth the wait and annoyance."
Amanda G.,"San Jose, CA",27,3,2,5.0,11/10/2015,Had such a wonderful experience with the bar staff. Jimmy really anticipate my needs with my food order. My food was timed perfectly and tasted great. Thanks for the amazing service.
Sancho And Jennifer P.,"Garden Grove, CA",115,84,92,4.0,2/12/2012,"YES!!! Fantastic service. Celebrated a buddy's birthday a month-and-a-half late but still got the 'Happy Birthday' song from our waitress, Jasmine, and her fellow employee. One of our dishes, the Jambalaya, was a little on the salty side and the manager offered a replacement dish and even took it off the bill.  We stayed for at least 30 minutes after we were finished eating but no one shooed us away.  In other words, the folks at Cheesecake Factory treated our group like kings and queens and we enjoyed our dining experience quite a bit. Minus one star for the saltiness of the Jambalaya but I tried another dish, the Chicken Marsala with pasta, and it was right on point. One last thing, for all the cheese-haters (I HATE CHEESE), you don't have to eat cheesecake for dessert! Yes, you are at the 'CHEESECAKE' Factory but the Strawberry Shortcake is HUGE and whomps on any stinky cheesecake. YES I SAID IT. COME AT ME, BRO!!"
Peter T.,"San Diego, CA",302,835,382,4.0,12/29/2012,"You know, this place gets bashed a lot, but at its core, it is obviously, by many miles, one of the top tier chain restaurants around.  Food is rich, portions are overly generous, and prices aren't too premium! The only down side is that the mass public is aware of this, so, consequently, it's always always busy. Try to slip into the bar if you're a smaller party, you can save a lot of time!"
Jillian E.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Absolutely horrible horrible service. We waited for an hour for our food while we watched who were seated next to us get their food within 25 minutes. They had the nerve to tell us some excuses when clearly the waiter forgot to put in our order. Here's the thing, I've worked in the industry and now I work in customer service so I'm not one to complain but to have that wait time and have it to be your birthday sucks. I love that they only offered us to give us a free birthday dessert for the wait which is standard at most restaurants like this one. Paying almost $100.00 for this was so horrible. I will never ever go back."
Susan W.,"Santa Clara, CA",27,8,2,1.0,10/11/2015,Went there today for a birthday dinner for my best friend. I used to love their food. But the food we had today was a totally disappointment. Terrible food and terrible service. Never go there again!
Diane W.,"Los Altos, CA",140,408,,5.0,12/18/2012,I just love this place. Not only is it beautiful but it is immaculate. Everyone is so gracious.  We enjoy an assortment of small dishes so we can share. We always get the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and try s few new things. Today we had Vietnamese Tacos (scrumptious) Sausage Ricotta Flat Bread Beet Salad and the Chicken Salad. Everything was absolutely perfect.  I eat way too much dark sweet bread they set on the table. The irony here is that we are always too full for cheesecake!  It looks amazing so next time I am thinking of starting with the cheesecake...
Nora O.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,2,4.0,1/10/2015,"Took awhile to be seated last wk but to be expected after New Years & everyone shopping returns etc Valley Fair mall,  me and my daughter had the baked avocado appetizers, zucchini fries and the best overstuffed french dip sandwich, she enjoyed her club! I love the decor in there as well.  Nom nom Cheesecake Factory!"
Shema P.,"New York, NY",45,83,47,5.0,8/24/2014,I love Cheesecake Factory and this time we went the waitress just made it a complete 5 stars. So basically we went in for dessert but we ended up getting food. I don't remember the waitress's name but Caucasian lady short hair super sweet she was so enthusiastic and I loved it. We came for dessert but she still offered bread and of course we took it because the bread is bangin! Anyways we go the nachos with spicy chicken. Chickens not that spicy but it was so delicious and cooked well. Nachos were so filling and yum! Finally for dessert we got the Linda's cake with vanilla ice cream. So bomb! Totally recommend this place the dessert and nachos!
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2246,2841,1478,3.0,9/25/2012,"I used to love the Cheesecake Factory. The servers were on the top of their game, the food was delicious, the menu HUGE. It was a great place to go where a party of six could each order something completely different from one another and enjoy it thoroughly. Perhaps I've just grown tired of the standard routine there, or perhaps this location just isn't on top of their game the same way others are. I'm not sure. But I've gone twice now and it's just been okay... and it used to be a destination restaurant for me. The service is just so-so now. Certainly nothing special. Maybe they're not training their staff as well, or perhaps the standards of service in the South Bay just don't compete. There's always a wait and there are always lots of unbussed tables when you enter. They're not efficient like they once were. They've taken a lot of excellent items off of the menu (hello Shrimp Poor Boy) and replaced them with a lot of uninspiring choices. It's still tasty. I'll still return. But it's not the bomb the way it once was. Now I go when I'm dining with a finicky eater in the Santana Row area and I don't want to be surrounded by pretentious heterosexuals so I cross the street."
Ana Maria F.,"San Jose, CA",4021,121,61,4.0,12/31/2013,"Large variety of food and drinks that are quite tasty. I've always received great service from all the staff which also keeps me coming back for more.  That and the Happy Hour they have during the weekdays from 4-6pm.  $5 appetizers and drinks at the bar.  I usually order the Georgia Peach which could use a little more alcohol, but that's fine. It's still a delicious drink. Always a great time with the hubby and friends at the bar!"
Linda P.,"Kansas City, MO",135,286,1188,4.0,11/20/2010,"Came for small bites and tuna tartare was flavorful and delicious.  I was surprised at how big the small salad was I almost could've just ordered that. Most occasions I love the Chicken garlic and Farfalle bow tie pasta.  It is one of those pastas that can be heavy but so worth it if you split it into two meals.  Tip: do not try to finish it all in one sitting or you will regret it and never wanna order it again.   Though the last time I've ordered the pasta either there was a new cook or they changed the recipe to be less dense and heavy.  The sauce was watery and the garlic cream sauce was nonexistent. I was very disappointed.  Even after requesting more cream sauce to put on my sauceless pasta, the side cream sauce didn't taste right like all the years before. I wonder if I should take the chance again or maybe all recipes have changed to be more health conscious.  =T"
Lori S.,"San Leandro, CA",26,17,2,1.0,1/21/2015,"I normally love the Cheesecake Factory.  Food is always good.  However, on December 26, 2014, I had the worst experience that anyone can have in a restaurant. I didn't write a review right away just because of the horror but I definitely don't want them to think that they got off scott free without me telling anyone what happened. In the middle of our meal a cockroach crawled up on the table. The managers initial response was that he wished that he ""could see the cockroach"" and that he was  ""surprised that a cockroach would be in the dining room with all of these people"" I informed him number one that I used to be a pest control operator and number two that the fact that a cockroach was in the dining room meant that their kitchen had some serious trouble. But the cockroach granted him his wish and reappeared.  They offered to move us to a new table and they offered me a new entre, REALLY!!! it amazes me that they think I would want to eat another crumb of food out of a kitchen that is clearly infested with cockroaches. Anyway,  I still love the Cheesecake Factory I just won't be returning to the one on Stevens Creek in San Jose."
Andy P.,"Bellevue, WA",21,16,,1.0,9/1/2015,Of course the food sucks. You come here sometimes when nothing else is open at night. Today we came here for dinner. My wife has been vegetarian since she was born. We specifically asked for pasta without chicken. When the server got the food they said that it is without chicken. However it had chicken in it. I am never going to Cheesecake Factory again.
Faith O.,"San Jose, CA",16,63,360,1.0,1/24/2014,"OVERRATED!! My first exposure to the infamous Cheesecake Factory was a total let down. Food was NOT HOT and there was a LACK of SERVICE. Its no different than going to these other chain restaurants...maybe worse. In fact, I think I may have been exposed to food poisoning...because my stomach was rumbling the next day. But let me tell you what my friends and I had to have this violence occur in my stomach: -Fried Mac & Cheese $9.95 --Description: Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce. --Mac & Cheese was gooey and cheesy, fried cheese is alway good, but it wasn't piping hot --marinara sauce was so bland  -Tex Mex Eggrolls $10.95 --Description: Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese. Served with Avocado Cream and Salsa. --Egg roll skin wasn't fried crispy enough, skin was a bit dough on some parts, otherwise nothing special -Dynamite Shrimp $6.95  --Description: Crispy Tempura Shrimp Tossed with Our Spicy Dynamite Sauce --Fried lightly, but when it got cold, it wasn't crunchy and nice anymore --Shrimp was really skinny and there was A LOT of breading and there was a lack of seasoning...tossed with spicy dynamite sauce?? Where's the sauce? -Pasta Da Vinci $16.95 --Description: Sautéed Chicken, Mushrooms and Onions in a Delicious Madeira Wine Sauce Tossed with Penne Pasta and Parmesan --Nice mushroom taste, chicken was soft and moist --Pasta was not al dente...way too chewy -STUFFED CHICKEN TORTILLAS 14.95 --Description: Corn Tortillas Stuffed with Spicy Chicken, Covered with Melted Cheese, Green Onion, Tomatillo Sauce and Cilantro. Served with Grilled Corn Cakes, Black Beans, Salsa and Sour Cream --The grilled corn cakes tasted good, the corn was sweet and the cake was crispy --Everything else was bland -Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake $7.50 --Description: Pineapple Cheesecake Between Two Layers of Moist Buttery Pineapple Upside-Down Cake --It was OK. Too much warm whip cream. I felt I got jipped because the size of the cheese cake was small. --Pineapple cake was heavy like fruit cake -TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE $7.50 --Description: Our Wonderful Cheesecake and Tiramisu Combined into one Amazing Dessert! --Nothing Amazing about it. I don't even remember the taste. -FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE $7.50 --Description:Banana Cream Cheesecake Topped with Bavarian Cream and Fresh Sliced Bananas --They mixed artificial banana flavoring in the cheese cake and that was all I tasted. The so called ""bavarian"" cream was no different from the whip cream from my pineapple cheesecake. -CAFE MOCHA $4.95 --Description:Espresso, Chocolate, Steamed Milk, Whipped Cream --Tasted really chalky and powderly --Temporarily disabled my taste buds Overall: 1 star for ""meh"" food and  service. My stomach still hurts a bit when I think about this place. The service felt like what I would get at a Asian restaurant. If I wanted that, I would have gone to one. Our waiter seem very unethusiastic and inattentive to us. He didn't refill our drinks or really checked up on us. The ""free"" bread was barely warm and it was hard. Our utensils were placed ON the table (OMG do they even clean that??) and the soda my friends got were flat...maybe because the soda pitchers were sitting across from us the entire night?--OR maybe they were ice tea as someone here pointed out...ANYWAY...it took awhile for our food to come out.When we went there, it was packed! We had to wait for them to call my name in the lobby and you can barely hear them...I really don't recomend coming here unless you love waiting....waiting for your seat, waiting for your food, waiting for your waiter, waiting for your check...OMG..."
Brittany V.,"San Jose, CA",19,19,6,5.0,12/17/2015,"Chicken sandwich salad , my fav ... Also RED velvet cheese cake ""bomb"" !!! 5 stars because the food here is fantastic !"
Teresa M.,"San Jose, CA",31,137,16,1.0,1/22/2015,"I came here like I usually do when I want a burger.  I ordered it MW, and it usually comes out perfect.  However, on this particular night, I bit into my burger and immediately spit it out because what I bit into was raw meat.  It was raw inside and still smelled like raw ground beef.  I was so disgusted!  I literally went into their bathroom and vomited.  They took it off the bill since I didn't eat it, but I was unable to eat anything else because I was so disgusted.  I sat there while my family finished their dinner.  I couldn't believe it!"

Our waiter seem very unethusiastic and inattentive to us. He didn't refill our drinks or really checked up on us. The ""free"" bread was barely warm and it was hard. Our utensils were placed ON the table (OMG do they even clean that??) and the soda my friends got were flat...maybe because the soda pitchers were sitting across from us the entire night?--OR maybe they were ice tea as someone here pointed out...ANYWAY...it took awhile for our food to come out.When we went there, it was packed! We had to wait for them to call my name in the lobby and you can barely hear them...I really don't recomend coming here unless you love waiting....waiting for your seat, waiting for your food, waiting for your waiter, waiting for your check...OMG..."
