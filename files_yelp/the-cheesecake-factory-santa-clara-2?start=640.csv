Judy W.,"San Jose, CA",55,134,105,4.0,8/4/2015,"I ordered pasta da Vinci and the pasta tasted so good. They put a lot of seasonings and the chicken was tender. My friend Linguinco penne pasta and it is really good. The waiter, Jesse, was really nice and smiled a lot. I'm coming here again :)"
Magic M.,"Waxahachie, TX",214,433,2,5.0,1/29/2015,Always awesome.  I tried to balance my skinnilicious salad with a slice of red velvet cheesecake.  Salad was wonderful but I really should have said leave out the blue cheese; it kind of ruined it for me.  Otherwise fantastic though.
Johnny L.,"San Jose, CA",269,218,231,5.0,2/10/2014,"I've been here over a countless amount of time. I gotta say I love the customer here, every time I go here I was greeted by a host named Jonathan. His customer service skill is great. He would always compliment me on the clothes what I'm wearing and ask me about my day. He knows that I like sitting in the booth so he always sits me in the booth. Besides the great customer service I love the food here, the farfeille pasta is definitely one of my favorite pasta. I like eating the hamachi steak too, good portions for its price. The thai chicken lettuce appetizer is fulfilling too so be aware to share it with someone. The drinks here are delicious (strawberry lemonade). Did I also say I love desserts here? What's better than having a red velvet cheesecake after dinner!"
Maria M.,"San Jose, CA",6,3,,5.0,6/19/2016,"Eric the libra was so amazing!! He was very attentive, helpful and completely honest. The floors were way to slippery though."
Erika G.,"Livermore, CA",368,754,449,2.0,8/3/2012,"So dissappointed in my recent meal here.  Another working lunch and brought my regional and another associate. Service was almost perfect. Several people involved during our meal.  So I wonder if they cash out eachother since the waitress who took the order was different than the one who brought out our food, refilled the water, cleared plates, brought a to-go box and even took the credit cards.... all different people!   My meal was horrible!  I ordered Garlic Noodles with an added order of grilled shrimp.  It was not garlicy at all!  I mean - AT. ALL.  Watery, no flavor what so ever.  Shrimp was horrible.  Rubbery and very strong odor.  The shrimp was terrible cooked - took the point some were almost like they dried out or microwaved crispy!  Gross.  AND I didn't eat any free bread because I was hoping to eat all my carb'd pasta.  Bummer. Everyone elses meals were ok.  One salad was drowning in dressing.   Very dissappointing.  Will think twice about eating here again."
Maria G.,"Sacramento, CA",536,30,1,2.0,7/28/2015,Omg!!!! I'm freezing here!!!! I can't even feel my fingers. My food got cold super fast. I asked my server to turn it down and he said he would but he lied!!!!!!! I can't wait to get out of here!
Johnny T.,"San Jose, CA",132,61,25,5.0,4/7/2014,"Holy cow, one of the best Cheesecake that I have eaten in a long time. The place is so clean and upscale that is perfect for a group of people. My family had a birthday party of 14 people and we manage to get a table which was awesome! YEs, I would recommend people go here but since it is valley fair that parking can be a little problem.  Other than that awesome desserts!"
Mea B.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,3,2.0,8/31/2015,Terrible customer service. No acknowledgement for 15 minutes. Not coming back to this one ever again. This is the second time I've had a bad experience here. Get it together people.
Chris A.,"San Jose, CA",4998,745,1908,3.0,11/30/2011,"It all started many many years ago when I was forced to eat there with my family. When it was time to order dessert, I told the waiter, ""I hate cheesecake,"" which is still pretty much true. She told me to try the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake because ""it doesn't even taste like cheesecake.""  That moment was life-changing.  The best non-cheesecake cheesecake ever! If you arrive there after 6pm pretty much any night then you'll have to wait FOREVER for a table.  I find the restaurant to be great for family.  I often just get appetizers and dessert because I hate most of the entrees. They never taste as good as they sound, but I will share some highlights of the menu: --Appetizer sampler. . . so big, but great --Avocado eggrolls --Thai lettuce wraps --French Country Salad --Napa Burger --Fish Tacos And my favorite cheesecakes-- --Chocolate Tuxedo Cream --Brownie Sundae --Tiramisu --Love the bar"
Jackie L.,"San Jose, CA",11,12,8,5.0,7/17/2014,"The red velvet cheese cake is to die for and if you care about good service, this place has the best."
MaryAnn W.,"San Diego, CA",103,177,49,2.0,12/27/2013,We got here at 6:15pm. Wait was suppose to be 35 mins. We ended up waiting for an hr!!!  Food was good. Service was okay our server disappeared for a little bit...
Jaynne L.,"Seattle, WA",4,66,17,4.0,8/5/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is awesome!!! The price is kind of expensive but you get a good amount of food for it.  Yesterday I went and had the loaded baked potato tots and omg theres absolutely nothing healthy about them but oh were they good and the sour cream they put on the sauce I wanted to drink up! I had the Cajun jambalaya pasta and it was delicious! The noodles were well cooked with tender pieces of chicken and shrimp. The sauce was amazing although I wish they made it a little bit spicier. The design of the plate was perfection as well with sprinkles of parsley and I believe cayenne or paprika.  For dessert I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. I forgot how big the portions are but I finished a little bit more than half. It was delicious with the Oreo crust and creamy cheesecake with bits of chocolate chips and cookie dough. This was topped off with a huge amount of whipped cream. Again nothing about this is healthy, but that won't stop me from coming back!"
Sherin L.,"Santa Clara, CA",370,182,221,4.0,5/22/2014,"Other than the waiting time, everything else is perfect :) we always had pastas and felt like it's pretty good.  Our last visit, we tried their steaks and it was PERFECT! medium rare just right and the sauce is all goes together very well :P But usually I hate how we never had room for desserts (even tho it's called the cheesecake factory) Service: 5 stars Food: 5 stars Waiting time: ehhh...  Will be back? DEFINITELY"
Martha J.,"San Jose, CA",1,90,185,3.0,9/14/2015,"We ate here at The Cheesecake Factory on Sunday around 4:00pm and to my surprise there was not wait, so we sat down right away. Our waitress came by and took or drink orders, then came back with our drinks. The menu is so amazing it took us over 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted. So when she came by to take our order we gave it to her then asked if we can get some bread because they never gave it to us. She came back after 5 minutes with bread and butter. Our food came out and it was great. We had the PARMESAN-HERB CRUSTED CHICKEN, FARFALLE WITH CHICKEN AND ROASTED GARLIC and Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp. The food was cooked perfect, we had to keep waving the waitress down to bring us bread and re-frill our drinks. I also was disappointed they never came by and offered us extra cheese to be put on our food. I thought we would have gotten better service since there weren't than many people.  The bathrooms were clean they just need to empty the trash out because it was overflowing."
Sharonda L.,"Monterey, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/23/2016,The worst customer service in the history of customer service! My $200 coat was stolen and the last people at the table were the staff and management did NOTHING  to assist in the situation. In fact when I refused to pay for my food they threatened to call the police on me! Save yourself the frustration and stay far far far away from this place. The management is horrible.the managers Brian and Brian were super unhelpful! And their was an Asian female Manager that offered me a sweater before threatning to call the police on me. I should have called the police on them. Thanks for ruining my 10 year anniversary. I will never give you my business again. And I will make sure any and everyone that will listen will never  give you their business  again.
Jennifer G.H. W.,"San Jose, CA",455,837,1983,4.0,12/19/2013,"Ok, Cheesecake Factory! You are so consistent! I love it! You are my to-go place for a steak, if I don't want to go somewhere fancy or cook it at home. Notice: I'm not going to pay for a sub par steak especially if I could make it better. So, cheesecake is pretty good for that. Don't get me wrong, I love the other items on the menu too! :) Steak, fries, and wine sounds like a great meal for me!"
John B.,"San Jose, CA",2,4,,1.0,9/5/2015,Didn't even get to eat the food. The host forgot about us twice. Just two of us waited a whole hour and we didn't even get seated. Most likely will not be coming back.
Karen M.,"San Jose, CA",74,12,14,1.0,3/17/2014,Horrible service and  ok food. This place is so overrated. The shrimp was soggy and our server seemed so inconvenienced to be working there.
Joyce Z.,"San Leandro, CA",341,798,5072,3.0,11/4/2013,"Stopped by Cheesecake Factory for dinner on the way home from our SLO weekend since I wanted a slice of their seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  Although the menu is huge, for some reason, nothing really jumped out to us so we ended up with 2 small plates and a breakfast item that is served all day.  It's okay but nothing worth writing home about and after having a weekend of great food and great prices, this one fell short for us."
Jimmy L.,"San Jose, CA",33,854,133,4.0,5/12/2014,"I've been here a few times over the last coupla years since my last review, and they have a consistently good formula going on.  Parking sucks, of course! Service and wait times suffer because of their volume in terms of food, drink, and larger parties, though am willing to sacrifice for the quality and servings you get in return for the decent price points.  I AM a foodie, and picky about it, and how it's served, etc. For now, this restaurant works well for me since they're not too formal, and yet they're not po-dunk, and it's a place to which I can go to with family, or if I just wanna have fun with friends. This last visit, though, I went with the Baja Chicken Tacos, which were good. The web description is as follows -  Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado,Tomato, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Black Beans and Rice. They could've been ""slightly warmer"", though we had already been waiting a whole hour and 15 minutes for our table; not to mention the wait-time for food, so I wasn't about to send it back. Still pretty good, though.  The chicken was on the border being barely moist and still decent. Didn't taste the spice, either. Asked for extra avocado, though don't think they really added any extra, cuz each taco only had a quarter of an avocado on top of each one; the waiter claimed that they added extra. I stand by the Romano Chicken as my favorite, also the warm (rye, i think) bread, and vanilla cheesecake.  On the other hand, I DO set my expectations accordingly, and would still come back for more, considering the quality, amount, and quality that you get for the price."
