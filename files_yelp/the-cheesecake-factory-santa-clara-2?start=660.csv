Ana A.,"Cupertino, CA",11,28,9,5.0,2/24/2015,We came here to get food to go and the line up wasn't too bad...waited about 15 mins. The foods always great and the staff is always nice so no complaints at a.
Mara I.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,28,,3.0,8/22/2015,"I've been here over two dozens times by now, probably more. The cheese cake is the best! I love the Godiva Cheesecake and when it's in season the Blueberry cheesecake! The food is okay. Some dishes are really good, some just so-so. Service is very spotty. On really busy days like Saturday's or during the lunch and dinner rush, expect service to be at a snail's pace. If you're with a large party, expect to wait about 40 min  or longer to be seated. I went with a party of seven last year, on a Tuesday night for dinner. We waited over 45 min until we were seated. Because of the long wait, we received a free appetizer.  Another time, my parents and I went for an early Sunday lunch, we were seated immediately but no one came to our table afterwards. We were the first people seated in the section but everyone seated after us was seen to first. After over 20 minutes of waiting for service (no one came to take our drink order) I finally got hold of a seating hostess and was told there was no server for our table. She hadn't come in yet.  So why the hell were we seated there? We were given a free meal and three free desserts for the grievous error on their part. We didn't go back for almost 4 months after that fiasco.  Parking is in the shopping mall, but it gets very, very busy.  My rating: Desserts/Cheesecake 5 Food Overall 3 Service 1.5"
Trae P.,"Sunset Park, NY",13,56,41,4.0,7/5/2014,Great food as always the Tuscan  chicken entree  which was a little on the bland reason for 3.5! Stars but everything else was great.
Emily C.,"Saratoga, CA",5,9,,2.0,2/20/2014,The service here was poor.  We ended up waiting for more than 2 hours after all the hubbub. They were going to put 7 people in a 5 person booth and when we added one more person they said it was going to be another 45 min wait. The food was only ok and the prices are pretty high. I had the Pasta da Vince and it was nothing spectacular and a almost lukewarm.  The portion sizes were really big and I would have rather them cut the portion and the price. Overall not a great experience.
Brittany D.,"Berkeley, CA",420,410,1063,4.0,1/2/2014,"The cheesecakes here can satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. We luckily had free cheesecakes from a friend who purchased a gift card during the holiday season. It was a great deal bc cheesecakes can easily cost $8. If you buy a $25 gift card, you can get a free cheesecake. The only thing is that there are restrictions but there is a very wide window to redeem them.  When we got there, it was very busy. It was expected because we came on New Years. The wait time to get a table was 2.5 hours!! This was around 7pm. We ended up just picking up our cheesecakes at the register. The line wasn't very long & we got our cheesecakes very quickly despite the crowd waiting in the lobby. My bf & I shared the caramel turtle pecan cheesecake. So good! Just very sweet so we had to drink water almost after every bite. My friends ordered the Oreo & Reese's cheesecakes. They said that the portions were so large that they couldn't finish it between the two of them. Luckily, my bf & I stuck with one. We were also able to sneak them into the theater & eat them while watching our movie. I thought it was definitely worth it =)"
Jason D.,"San Jose, CA",320,189,246,4.0,8/12/2013,***This is just for the cheesecake**** AHHHH how I love their cheesecake! I know it's so bad for you but I cannot help it! I love every kind of cheesecake that they have! It's my guilty pleasure as some would call it! It's pretty pricey at around $9 a slice so that's why I do not go there too often but I do think about it...HMMMM CHEESECAKE! There is a line most nights just to order a slice so be patient and you will get your fix. The service is pretty good and they try to get your order to you as quick as they can so you can go enjoy the deliciousness. Okay gotta go get a slice after writing this and thinking about it mmmmmm
John W.,"Saratoga, CA",0,33,4,2.0,12/27/2014,"Honestly, they need to work on their quality control. Every time i go there i order the chicken marsala and mushrooms. On one visit, they had forgotten to put mushrooms on the dish. A separate visit when it's less busy, the dish was perfect. On the final visit; however, the chicken was RAW, something completely unacceptable. I know the kitchen is completely capable of producing quality food, but this location misses the mark for me. Sorry, i'm sticking to the sf location."
Christie V.,"Downtown, San Jose, CA",160,6,1,5.0,7/12/2015,"I always come here for lunch when I'm in the mood for my Tomato Basil Pasta. I am a creature of habit and that's what I always get and it NEVER disappoints. I love places that are consistent. The honey oat bread and butter is also my fav out of all chain restaurants. Also super baby friendly!! The waiters always bring out something extra for my toddler and I love a place with good, friendly service"
Melissa L.,"Fremont, CA",39,247,85,3.0,3/30/2014,"really, really long wait. we went in on a friday night around 8:15pm; we didn't get seated until 9:15pm (and we had walked around santana row for 40 minutes to lessen the wait). they didn't have a pager to give us initially because they had run out -_- standard cheesecake factory fare; if you go off their skinny menu (the low cal stuff), the portion is very, very small (which makes sense). but that does mean if you are starving you either have to order something else, doubling the price of what you would pay for a usual entree, or fill up on the bread, which defeats the purpose of ordering from the low cal menu....."
Adam S.,"San Ramon, CA",1,32,4,1.0,2/5/2015,"We called 10 mins  ahead of arriving and was told there was no wait.  Cool, right?! We get there and to our surprise there was a wait.   They said it should be a short wait 10 to 15 mins.  Ok.   Whatever I'm here. I'll wait.   Well after 30 mins  I asked what happen to the no wait u told me over the phone to the 10 to 15 min wait that has now turned into a 30 plus minute wait.  After some complaining we where seated after 40 mins.    We will not be returning."
Christine P.,"San Francisco, CA",606,676,616,4.0,7/23/2011,"Before heading home from our staycation, we decided to stop by Cheesecake Factory to grab lunch.  I ordered the crab rangoons to start and the Salmon Miso lunch.  My husband ordered fish and chips.  As usual the portions are huge.  We also shared a Tiramisu cheesecake which was delish and satisfied our sweet tooth."
Christine H.,"San Jose, CA",68,300,1324,4.0,4/23/2014,"Atmosphere is great, but it's usually pretty crowded. Great cheesecakes(as should be expected of because of its name-I tried the Mango Key Lime one, and the Strawberry). The portions for the regular dishes are pretty big so the price is not too bad, though still on the high side ($10~$20). I recommend the Pasta Carbonara, Steak Diane! Make sure to try the chocolate wheat bread they serve prior to your meal!!"
Tom S.,"San Jose, CA",2,18,,1.0,11/20/2014,"I just picked up a cheesecake from here for my office party, which I pre-ordered three days ago. It took five minutes to get someone's eyes to meet mine, then I paid and left a nice tip.  It then took them another 15 minutes to get the cake out of the back. Explain to me why a desk that isn't busy takes 20 minutes to bring me a cake I pre-ordered."
David S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/6/2015,"This experience ruin an otherwise great day.  After an exceptionally long wait for our food, it was served cold on very hot plates.  They certainly can't serve food promptly and It seems they can't even reheat food properly! Never again."
Steph G.,"Sacramento, CA",560,790,1237,2.0,12/21/2011,"Waiting....waiting....waiting... So, this review is strictly for this location.  As usual, their laundry list of menu options left us in a quandary, but thankfully for Brunch you only have a few pages to read through. Our server, bless her little heart, she tried and I don't blame her but seriously....after she took our order, multiple tables sat down, received their food, and one even paid their bill, before we received our food. It should have been a red flag when the Manager stopped by and apologized for the wait.... But that was it, about 20 minutes later we received our food. No apologies from the server, no slight inclination as to why it took forever? Dumbstruck we ate our food, which was actually pretty good. I hope subbing chicken chorizo for Avocado and using egg whites only wasn't the hold up, but the table kept teasing me that it was :(  The size of the burrito was about the size of my head, no joke. This thing was as huge as a body builder's forearm, eyes glazed over, I dug in. Great flavor, fresh Avocado, slightly spicy (but we all know how much of a wimp I am). Instead of a side of beans, I got the Spanish rice, which was a great addition to the burrito. I have no complaints with my food, nor did anyone else at the table. The flavor was on point. They are good for baller-on-a-budget needs, two meals in one. The Manager needs to step up his customer service game.... Simply chain-tastic...."
Myleisha D.,"San Jose, CA",15,29,5,4.0,10/31/2014,Awesome service. I like the vibe here. The bartenders are great and friendly. Bathrooms and restaurant are super clean. This is my favorite cheesecake factory location.
Ngoc L.,"San Jose, CA",346,394,5502,4.0,6/24/2011,"This was by far the best cheesecake factory I've been to. We came with a party of 7 at around 10:40PM and we were seated within 10 minutes. We were suppose to go to Yard HOuse but there was a 45 mins wait and they can't guarantee that they'll take our orders after 11 cause that's when the kitchen closes. Well Cheesecake closes at 11PM but they happily took us in.  We knew what we all were going to ordered already.. We got 3 orders of the Habachi Steak, 3 orders of the Pasta da Vinci and an order of the Mac n cheese for my brother.  The food came out pretty quick... Maybe cause we had plenty of fresh bread to keep us company during the time. Our server was really nice too... He came by many times to make sure we didn't need anything. The quality of the food was just great... My steak was done perfectly... Flavor was good and everyone enjoyed the meal. This is definitely Cheesecake Factory I would come back to!"
Rose C.,"San Jose, CA",165,142,504,3.0,4/21/2014,Been here a few times already and usually it's a great experience except for today...the Mojito tasted horrible! The entree was alright & the cheesecake is great like always. Only 3 stars because the Mojito wasn't the same like how I normally get them served there so oh well.
Janelle P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",30,17,2,5.0,7/15/2015,Friendly staff great food. Never disappoints! I'm always excited to get lunch here lunch portions are so huge I can't even imagine the full size dinner portions.
Hima C.,"Santa Clara, CA",37,15,,2.0,7/14/2015,"Very very limited vegetarian options.  Pricing:  high compared to other places.  Wait time: Week day wait was for 20 minutes. Over all comments: Was terribly disappointed that vegetarian options are so less in such a big, popular restaurant. Almost every item was either made with Chicken stock or had some kind of meat ingredient.  Definitely expected more from this place as I have heard a lot about it."
