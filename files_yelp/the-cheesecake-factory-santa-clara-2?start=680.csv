Diana A.,"San Jose, CA",105,162,73,3.0,7/26/2012,I just had cheesecake factory again after at least 3years. I have been avoiding that restaurant cuz the calories there is HUGE! really bad for my waist line haha :P I went there last night with a couple of girlfriends and I ordered steak diane and chicken madeira combo but well I should have just ordered chicken madeira. I ordered the steak medium well but it came out really tough! their chicken madeira is as good as usual. The portion is REALLY HUGE! We were planning getting a cheesecake but we were too full so next time cheesecake :) We went there around 8 and the line was still really LONG! we need to wait for at least 50minute just for a group of 4. The line was crazy!
Sairam B.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",102,77,7,4.0,7/11/2015,The cakes were tasty. The service was good.
Jeff S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,,4.0,8/31/2015,I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner on a Saturday at 6pm.  The place was packed and the wait was 45 minutes but the waitress was prompt once we were seated.  We shared the cajun jambalaya pasta and chicken gumbo.  The dishes were good and so large we couldn't finish.  We were so stuffed we didn't make it to dessert.  We will definitely return!   Note that valet parking can be validated but it only decreases the parking from $8 to $7.
Corinna P.,"Homestead, FL",3,2,,1.0,8/3/2015,"Came here on a date with my girlfriend and it stared out pretty good till my chicken was not fully cooked !,parts were bleeding and still uncooked if your gonna charge so much on your food make sure it's fully cooked"
Toni L.,"Fremont, CA",1,4,1,2.0,8/2/2015,"50 minute wait. Poor service. My daughters were halfway through their dinner and I still hadn't gotten my salad dressing for Chinese Chicken Salad. After being ignored by every waiter that walked by I had to get up and go find my waiter to ask for salad dressing. I told my daughters that, in the future, if they want cheesecake I'll go to Safeway!"
Tien N.,"San Jose, CA",81,46,23,5.0,12/22/2013,"I went here for my birthday and their service was great. Although it was crowded, and the food kind of took a while, it was worth the wait. I had a great birthday and a nice dinner. Don't forget the cheesecake !!! Hmmm hmmm hmmm !"
Weber S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/1/2015,"Food quality is just so so. What can you expect from a chained restaurant any way! Don't be fooled by the long waiting line during dinner time, not many restaurants around the mall :( What makes me feel uncomfortable is the space between their tables. My wife is 5.5' and 100lbs, which I thought should be pretty skinny. But when she tried to walk through between two tables, I realized she was so fat that she could not even fit into the space. So now I have to either change my definition of skinny girl or believe Cheesecake Factory is discriminating we fat people."
Brian L.,"San Jose, CA",131,29,19,5.0,12/18/2013,"Came here on a busy night. After everyone got their food, the manager informs me that the cook has burnt my food. I was starving and was a little annoyed at the fact, but I understand that mistakes happen. The company I was with were more angry than I was. They were being rude to the waitress and trying to get free stuff. I absolutely can't stand people like that, so I apologize on their behalf. Our waitress was very sweet and it's not her fault the cook messed up my food. I've worked in the industry before and know how difficult it can be. Everybody's mess ups falls on the waiters/waitresses. People have to be more understanding and stop acting like entitled douche lords.  Anyway, I ended up getting free soup, free cheese cake, and my meal was free. That was awesome but was not necessary."
Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",485,786,1873,4.0,5/23/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory serves a huge variety of food from Asian to Western styled food in a classical modern setting. This particular Cheesecake Factory has a modern appeal, especially the bar that they have and the liveliness of the crowd.  Pros Food: The food here is really flavorful here and the wide variety makes it interesting to come and try out the new meals that they have. Like the name suggest this place is known for there cheesecake and they don't disappoint. They have a huge variety of different cheesecakes to choose from.  Service:The servers, front desk and employees here are really nice and have a sense of humor. Location: The place is located in the heart of the shopping district of Valley Fair and right across the street from Santana Row so its a great place to grab a bite and be near some amazing night life and shopping areas.  Atmosphere: This place has a dark toned to it. It definitely comes alive during the night time. The decor is of classical decoration and has a modern feel to it.  Cons Crowded: This place and get packed during the night time and it does get pretty crowded on the weekend so expect a long wait time. Also it gets pretty loud so don't expect a quiet date night.  Overall this particular cheesecake has great food with a lot of choices to choose from. The service is fantastic and the atmosphere is great for large groups or a night out."
Trisha G.,"Lompoc, CA",46,66,15,4.0,4/19/2014,"visiting from out of town. walked right in after adventuring the  mall and was taken to our seats, no wait at all, and it was like 4:15pm i ordered the lunch special with Hawaiian pizza and Caesar salad. my husband got the chicken Caesar salad. way too much food, we took pretty much it all back to the hotel to munch on throughout the night. he ordered the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake, he loved it. waitress was nice and attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the menu as well. the dinner rolls/bread were yummy as well"
Thank Y.,"San Ramon, CA",2,43,4,5.0,1/24/2015,"The key is to sit at the bar. The best service in the entire resteraunt. You don't have to wait an hour to be seated. The bar and tall tables near it are all open seating. We love chatting with the bar tenders. They are never wrong when suggesting food or drinks. It's perfect for my husband and I when we want to grab either just snacks, dinner or dessert. They also have a large drink selection for those who like to drink."
Glenn L.,"San Jose, CA",721,596,1712,3.0,11/5/2011,"Some things never change!  The wait is ALWAYS long here.... But Chessecake Factory still deserves 3 stars! + 1 STAR for good food! Despite the long wait, their food is really good!!! I like pasta and my top choices are pasta marinara, fettucini with chicken and sundried tomaotoes, and Evelyn's favorite!  For appetizers I've tried their spicy ahi tempura roll and firecracker salmon (like the sauces too!)... Both are good! In addition to appetizers I also like their mashed potatoes here for some reason! I always order it and it never fails. + 1 STAR for their lunch special! You can order some of their special dishes for a cheaper price and smaller portion! It's worth it when you're not that hungry and you wanna get your Cheesecake Factory fix! +1 STAR for good service. Servers are nice and friendly! Haven't had a bad experience...except the longggg wait! *knocks on wood*..."
Gabby B.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,2,5.0,7/13/2015,"I really love the chicken marsala with bowtie pasta, I get this every time now. I've tried a few other things and learned that not everything is good here.  The chicken quesadilla from the kids menu was really good too crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside , it was a pretty big portion too my son only ate 1/2.  We got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake which was super good as well. Yum!"
Steven N.,"San Jose, CA",129,222,68,4.0,5/6/2012,never fails. I can always get a great meal for dinner and have left overs for lunch the next day. The wait is always long as usual since they don't take reservations.
Doug B.,"Anderson, IN",668,211,209,5.0,3/10/2012,"Sorry to the big box haters but these guys are consistently good.   The only problem is that everybody knows it.  If the folks at corporate could figure out a way to scale not only out, but make the space work for the crowd they draw (build an upstairs, double the bar size, etc.) they would be a killer category.  Biggest (only) complaints are frustrated consumers who don't know enough to just leave if there's a wait.  Why not mitigate that by making these babies on a grand(er) scale."
Holly L.,"San Jose, CA",581,349,1089,4.0,9/11/2011,"I've been here so many times... and I never reviewed it? Shame on me!  CHEESECAKE FACTORY is one of my favorite places for their brown rye bread... it's soooo good. Perfection when it's straight out of the oven. If you've tasted that, you know exactly what I mean. Deeeeee-lish! DRINKS I recommend: Peach Bellini or the one I've just had last week... the BLUEBERRY MOJITO. It's so freakin' good and comes in a tall glass too! Just tasty!  FOOD: I personally always get the PASTA DA VINCI. yes, i know i should try different things... but sometimes when you do, you just end up dissapointed... so i always get PASTA D because it's a favorite. i always know it's good. however, all the steaks here are good. lots of flavor!!! i've had them twice. DESSERT: if you love cake, order the LEMONCHELLO!!! that's another favorite of mine. i'm not really into milk or dark chocolate all that much, so the strawberries and sweetness and lemon tartiness of the cake is just the perfect balance.  however, if you were to ask me for cheesecake recommendations: i'd suggest the red velvet (but only if you prefer more cream cheese than cake since there's 3 layers of it), the white chocolate raspberry (reallllly gooood combo), the snickers chunk cheesecake, or the tiramisu one! and last tip: if you stop by the bar, make sure LYNNA makes your drink. she recommended that mojito and makes it so good!! :)"
Bryson L.,"San Jose, CA",490,902,228,4.0,2/4/2014,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory experience, decent food, awesome cheesecake, and plan on waiting a while to get a table.  There isn't really too much to say, I love cheesecake factory, and this ones alright.  It gets a little packed at times which is a bit of a problem, but once you're seated it really isn't an issue.  Another thing to note is if you're trying to buy cheesecake from the counter, expect to wait ages for it, for some reason putting cheesecake into a box takes at least 10 minutes..."
Mariza V.,"Santa Clara, CA",512,2,,2.0,4/22/2016,"My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lunch today. We've dined at multiple cheesecake restaurants so we knew we wouldn't be disappointed with the menu options. We were greeted and seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The place wasn't too busy for a Friday, I'm assuming because it was in between their lunch and dinner rush. Although it took our server a few minutes longer than it should have to greet us and get our drinks started, she was all around a pleasant server. Because my boyfriend and i are both in the restaurant industry, we offend critique the service we receive without even noticing. Despite having a pleasant experience, my boyfriend couldn't help but notice another couple who was sat at the same time as us and had not been greeted. We were probably 20 minutes into our dining and their server had walked past them multiple times. Our server, who had the section adjacent to theirs, also failed to acknowledge them. This bothered us so much that we made sure to notify a manager, simply because someone should have took it upon themselves to greet them or start their order if their server was too busy. We love the food and enviroment of this restaurant but with a prime location like this, sadly their service falls short."
Minerva L.,"San Jose, CA",517,1184,24,3.0,2/23/2012,"It's OK, it doesn't have as many variety as Elephant Bar. I think they're trying to go Asian fusion, but doesn't work too well. I think the pasta is way too thick, and drenched with way too much sauce. The salad is alright, not much variety there. Their appetizer may be the only compelling thing for folks, and of course their cheesecake. I remember how I used to go to the one in Sac, just to get the cakes. Now after realizing how BAD they are for you, I no longer go there. BUT I do have to admit that their baguette is super yummy..the wheat/brown one that is. I would go there just to buy it (about $2-3 for a whole stick).  People go there only bc Yard House and other places are super packed and also because this is stuck right at the mall. I think I'd prefer CPK over this anytime."
Pine F.,"San Jose, CA",1,6,,1.0,5/1/2016,Hamburgers are burnt and taste like charcoal and the lettuce tasted old. I have a dairy allergy and when I told them they acted like it was some new thing they never heard of.
