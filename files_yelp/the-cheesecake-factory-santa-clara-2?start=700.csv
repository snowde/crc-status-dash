Renee S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/20/2016,I work right down the street at Crestview Dental Group.  My co-workers and I come to The Cheesecake Factory at lunch and after work. The service is always impeccable and the food is  delicious.
Chantel G.,"San Jose, CA",1,9,3,4.0,6/26/2015,"Very good service from the host stand to the server at our table. Our server, April, was so great to my boyfriend and I. We really appreciated her kindness and service."
Tram N.,"San Jose, CA",631,2358,9298,3.0,6/3/2011,"Taking it down a star because today although Dharam and I had a good lunch but the service was mediocre to say the least.  We came in at 1 and the wait was about 5 minutes which is cool so we both took a seat by the hostess island.  Minutes later what seemed to be a hostess-in-training walked around the waiting area, silently calling out my name.  We were lead behind the bakery area overlooking the parking lot and Santana Row.  We were in the middle aisle where one side contains the booth seats and the other side, chairs.   Our server did come to greet us w/in 2 minutes so that was a plus but his facial expression, his tone of voice, his vibe simply told us that he hated working and that he is having the worst.. day.. ever.  He asked us what we wanted to drink and asked us if we wanted bread.   Once our refreshments and the bread came out, we started chattering away and continued to view the menu.  Now normally I would have no problem choosing what to eat but because I'm currently a lacto-ovo vegetarian so my choices were limited.  In the end I ordered the Four Cheese Pasta but for some reason it had chicken it it *Tram = sad* My guy ordered the Fresh Grilled Salmon, I think.  I'm not a seafood person so I didn't pay attention in detail to what he ordered but he pretty much cleared his plate and so did I (minus the chicken) so at least our entrees were good so - KUDOS. The bread came out at the beginning was warm and I had no intention of eating it but he broke part of the sourdough, buttered it, and made a mini sandwich and placed it on my side plate - ""Awww, right?""  Ever since he poured me my soda at Hunan House Restaurant... I was sold!  He was a gentleman and still is =) We didn't order dessert (a shocker, really) because we were both stuffed.  I didn't even need my Diet Coke refilled but he got his Coke w/ no ice refilled.. at least in the end we had a pleasant time together, a good tasting meal but we had to put up w/ the grim of our server.   Hopefully our experience will be better next time."
J. B.,"Chino Hills, CA",19,42,29,5.0,10/13/2013,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. The only bad part is the usual hour long wait :( Ordered the Chicken Madeira which always is delicious. Two succulent breasts topped with cheese and asparagus......yummy. Be sure to get an extra side of Madeira sauce because you're going to need it for those fluffy mash potatoes. Don't fill up on all the warm bread because the dinner portions are insanely huge. Plan on taking in around 2000 calories if dessert is on your mind. Which in my case, it was. I never leave Cheesecake Factory without getting an ice cold chocolate shake. This baby comes in a huge glass topped with a mountain of whipped cream. And they actually give you a massive straw to enjoy it with. Attentive service, great food, definitely a regular favorite. Oh and I think they might have a few Cheesecake desserts here......but I'm not too sure :-P Enjoy"
Neha C.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",2,8,,1.0,3/20/2016,The worsht cheese cake factory I have been to! I placed a to-go order over phone and 30 mins later when I arrive to pick it up they tell me they did not put the order in. I wait for 30 more minutes at the restaurant after which they gave me the wrong order and missed packing a cheesecake for which they had already charged me. The attending waiter did not have the courtesy to apologize for this and instead made me wait for 10 more mins to just pack the cheesecake!
Sara P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/24/2016,Tonight was absolutely the most amazing experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Valley Fair Mall. Jessica our server was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. When I had a specific question about a cocktail not listed on the menu she went directly to the bar and efficiently came back to tell myself they were able to make it. Then regarding menu items gave examples upon what I was interested in. Last but not least the Godiva cheesecake she suggested was absolutely fantastic. Thank you Jessica for making my experience at Cheesecake Factory perfect. I will be coming back shortly.
Tricia N.,"Spokane, WA",816,154,96,3.0,9/12/2011,"Cheesecake Factory seems to be my go-to restaurant if I'm craving anything, really. I love their food (especially their pastas... I have a thing for pasta), the service is usually pretty great, and their desserts are yum! There are a few cons though - - The wait is ridiculous sometimes. I ended up waiting 2 hours on my birthday... - There are times where food just seems to take days to come out. Main courses are usually big, so it's perfect for sharing. By the time that you've downed the bread and main dish, you'd be extremely stuffed. The environment is great for big groups or a one on one dinner date. It'd probably best to call in and make reservations first though. (They don't take reservations on weekends, unfortunately.) Like I said, it's still my go-to restaurant, so there must be something worth coming to each time."
Rachel L.,"San Jose, CA",304,9,,4.0,5/26/2015,"I've been here several times and overall, it's OK.  Service is pretty good, but expect it to slow down around dinner time, especially on weekends. Our waiter checked up on us consistently and was very friendly.  The food is usually pretty good; I like to order their pastas and small dishes, and they're very flavorful. Every cheesecake flavor I've tried here is very yummy too. But tonight, I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and it was disappointing. I got a mountain of pasta with not enough sauce to flavor it evenly. When I asked for more sauce, I got a small dish with too little sauce to make any difference.  Portion size in general here is a bit much for me and I would normally be okay with taking home leftovers for lunch the next day, but I really didn't want to be taking home this much bland pasta tonight.  Taking off a star because of the poor preparation of this plate and portion size of it. I would come back, but I won't be ordering this pasta dish again."
Megan F.,"San Jose, CA",30,36,13,3.0,9/15/2014,"We ordered the chicken piccata and Alfredo pasta. Both were equally bland. It was so tasteless that I had to add a ton of salt... I would honestly go to CPK instead and have their chicken piccata there (which is delicious and more worth the money). The service was great, but the food? Not so much."
Brooke S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5,108,112,1.0,3/20/2015,"I had no expectations for this place, so on the bright side, I wasn't disappointed with my dinner. It scares me when a restaurant has pages on pages of a menu- it tends to be a sign of quantity over quality, and that is exactly what this place is. I had never been here before, but assumed it'd be like all other chains- insanely fattening, crowded, not incredibly tasty, and wholly overpriced. This place was filled with people packed like sardines into booths and screaming babies around every corner. As expected, the vegetarian options are pasta or salad. I opted for the baked ziti and it was good, but after several spoonfuls i felt completely stuffed. The amount of cheese and cream in my dish was enough to fill me with regret from agreeing to let my friends choose the spot for our dinner date. I didn't even have enough room in my stomach to have cheesecake! It was certainly not worth the 15-20 I spent total on this meal and I won't be venturing back! Too over priced for a small amount of veggie options and enormously fattening fare!"
Alex R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",9,96,11,1.0,9/8/2014,I had a salad and jumbo shrimp.  Salad had so much dressing I couldn't even eat it. Waiters was completely oblivious when I told her.  I came with 6 other people.  Will never go back there again.
Gina C.,"Santa Clara, CA",55,26,,2.0,11/19/2014,"Way OVER priced, drinks were OK, no pip beef really... too much stuff on menu.. loved our waitress, but couldn't get check right.. over charged us :( not even a break on the check.. $80 so not worth it.. we won't be back"
Oliver L.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/24/2015,Last night I had the best waitress ever and she was new! The food is always good and they get it out to you fairly fast. I have never had a complaint here and love going here to treat my friends out or family. Favorite drink is the piña colada so good !
Leigh R.,"Dublin, CA",62,339,480,4.0,8/17/2011,I love the cheesecake! This review is strictly for these cheesecakes: 1. red velvet = 4 stars 2. fresh strawberry = 5 stars! 3. mango key lime = 5 stars! i love the coconut graham cracker crust and the hint of lime and mango 4. fresh banana = 4 stars These 4 are the ones I've tried so far and I absolutely love them all! Can't wait to try more cheesecakes =)
Erica L.,"Campbell, CA",243,26,23,4.0,7/8/2013,"The cheesecake factory is right next to Westfield's Valley Fair mall, so it's very convenient when you want to shop and then grab some food afterwards! I had the spaghetti with meat sauce, it was okay but not for 15$! I feel like I could have made better at home..but their philly cheese steaks are delicious!  The cheesecake is pretty good, but there were so many choices I didn't know what to order! Pretty good overall and recommended for anyone who goes out in large parties."
Umair K.,"Palo Alto, CA",391,348,165,4.0,5/8/2014,"Not unexpectedly for a place called the Cheesecake Factory,  the cheesecakes are excellent ; although the less exotic the model the better the taste.  The rest of the food is fairly typical diner fare although with exceedingly large portions. Does not leave you feeling healthy or energetic, only heavy and guilty.  But then that too is not unexpected if you are coming to a place called the Cheesecake Factory."
Joshua G.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,2,2.0,11/20/2014,"I want to say although I enjoy going to the cheesecake factory to get the cheesecake of course I have to say I felt completely disrespected at this restaurant particularly. Well to be fair it was not the sit and dine portion. It was the cheese cake bar area. After waiting in traffic I finally was able to get to the restaurant. The whole area in the entrance was packed but it consisted of diners. So the cheesecake area was empty and filled with employees just standing around. More so just chilling and chatting instead of taking my order.  I was then approached by a young lady with dark hair who heard me wrong. I then realized I had paid for the wrong size of cake. I asked some guy there to help me out and he just told me ""oh don't worry she will be right back"" It took her 20 mins to return while the others just stood there. When she had returned and I explained the problems she gave me a dirty look and got her supervisor and then the both proceeded to get me dirty looks.  I'm sure they realized that I was literally 2ft infront of them and I was able to hear all the huffing and puffing. I spoke loud enough, any louder and I would be yelling at her for my order. I will not be going to this cheesecake factory restaurant but instead will continue to another thats farther than where I live."
Amy L.,"Santa Clara, CA",401,747,273,4.0,7/31/2011,"Not a terrible Cheesecake Factory, but it's probably my least favorite to go to. Maybe because the acoustics in here make all the sounds bounce around, creating an annoying din. There's usually a wait, but it's not a big deal; I don't mind walking around Valley Fair for 20 minutes. Servers are generally nice, and the food is consistent. Gotta love their Pasta Da Vinci! Oh, and my favorite cheesecake, the pineapple upside down. If you're in a rush and want a casual snack/meal/drink/slice of cheesecake/etc, you could always just snag a seat in the bar area! There's usually a few seats/a table open, and the servers are quick to clean up after people leave the area, too!"
Darshan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,15,,5.0,5/5/2015,My wife and I love visiting here. We love the cheese cake tamale cake for the appetizer.
Stephanie C.,"Redwood City, CA",4,363,5,3.0,8/20/2013,"It'd been a long time since I'd been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I had been hoping for pasta and had forgotten that their pasta apparently all has eggs in it (and I have a mild egg allergy). Oh well.  Instead I got the eggplant sandwich without the aioli, which was decent, but not stellar, and was actually surprisingly messy to eat. My companion got a pasta dish that I can't recall and we ordered the polenta fries as an appetizer. I very much liked the polenta fries, in spite of their lack of the structural integrity required to actually dip them in the marinara they come with :) My companion was disappointed by the lack of pumpkin cheesecake, but he didn't notice the seasonal note next to the item on the menu :P He did enjoy the cheesecake he got, but I think he'll want to come back for the pumpkin cheesecake come October, as that is a favorite dessert of his. The service was pretty clearly stretched thin, unfortunately. They were confused when we got back with our blinking table buzzer (perhaps they had mistakenly pinged us?) and we had to wait on the side for them to ""clear our table."" Our waitress, who was clearly trying quite hard, was speeding between several tables and took a while to get us our drinks and such. The whole place was crowded, but I guess that's how it is on Friday evenings."
