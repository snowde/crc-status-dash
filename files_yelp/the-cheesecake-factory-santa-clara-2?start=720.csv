Ray T.,"Redwood City, CA",305,116,44,4.0,3/4/2013,"Say what you will about a chain like Cheesecake Factory, but this is probably one of the more consistent dining experiences for this type of restaurant. The food is very fresh, flavorful and beautifully plated. Portions are extremely generous too. I love their Chicken Madeira and the Herb-crusted Salmon. Mashed potatoes are delicious. When the bread is fresh and hot, it's also great. The few times where something was not up to par, the wait staff is usually very nice and good about fixing it. If you still have room for dessert, they have the best selection of desserts to choose from, including dozens of flavors of their famous cheesecake. Overall, this is a great go-to restaurant with a wide selection of dishes, prepared very well."
Kristin K.,"San Jose, CA",161,189,163,3.0,10/10/2013,"I come here once in a while, but its usually so crowded and I hate waiting.  Their menu is huge, its like a book, and can be overwhelming for some people.  I typically order a salad of some sort.  The portions are huge, and the ingredients are always fresh.  I dont think i've ever had brown/wilted lettuce.   Service is never very good, but what do you expect from a place that is always so crowded.  The other night we went around 730pm (it was a Tuesday) and there was still a short wait.  We got seated and our service was just so-so.  The food came out quickly, which was great, but everything else was very slow.  It took about 10 mins for our server to come back after asking us if we wanted dessert.  During our wait, we determined that we would rather go home and watch the Sharks game than to wait 15 mins to get a slice of cheesecake and then 10 mins to get our bill, then 10 more mins for them to run the card.   We werent in a huge rush, but slow service makes me antsy.  Of course I'll go back, but the Cheesecake Factory is not one of my favorite places to go."
Kevin D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,15,2,2.0,4/7/2013,"It was our first time at The Cheesecake Factory. And to start off with good: The decor is really nice! Probably too nice for the low-quality food and service, so maybe it set my expectations too high. This is a great place for cheap kids food, although my kid's cheese pizza tasted like soap. Life advice: Please do not get the fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, unless you enjoy tough chicken, Chef Boyardee sauce, and bland pasta. When our server asked how it was, I said, ""Not great, it's..."" but then she walked away. I wanted to order something else, so I waited for the server to come back. They didn't. I asked another server if they could get ours, and they said sure! And 10 minutes later, no one. So I went in back to ask for help, they said they'd be right over -- and still didn't! And another 10 minutes went by -- so I went back again! And like a bad joke, they said they'd be right over, and believe it or not, they still did not show up. They did offer to reduce our bill, but I didn't want that. I just wanted to know how we'd become invisible, and I really wanted to eat something besides the bread and my kid's soap pizza. I think I've been spoiled by good restaurants. To be fair, if you like food at Chili's or Applebee's, you'll probably like this. I didn't starve and life is good, but I did need to get this review on Yelp in case a newcomer wondered what it was like."
Ashley Q.,"Santa Clara, CA",177,301,116,3.0,11/28/2011,"Decent food and drinks. Ok service. The quality is consistent. It's a good place for groups, but the noise level makes me want to bring earplugs. I don't know how the servers can stand it."
Aaron L.,"Mountain View, CA",2,4,,1.0,8/30/2014,More than 2 hours wait time after being promised for 1.5 hours. Servers extremely slow - food is okay
Mickey L.,"Mountain View, CA",2,58,38,3.0,4/24/2015,"My experience was okay. The chicken pasta I had was pretty good. However, I'm giving them 3 stars because the service could have been better and the food and drinks were a bit overpriced. These seems like a very popular place so I can see why the service is hard to maintain when they get that many people. I will most likely end up at this restaurant again in the near future and if they do a better job with their service then I'll consider changing this to 4 stars."
Chris A.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/15/2016,"Stopped by for an anniversary dinner on 9/15/16 aroind 830pm and what a mistake that was. After receiving our cold/bland spinach artichoke dip with stale bread we asked our server Jason to take it back.  Instead of apologizing and offerering us a different  option he told us the bread was toasted and supposed to be like that. He took the food back and comes back 10 minutes later to take our order. Our entrees took 45 minutes to come out. While waiting for our entrees Jason never aknowledged us for refills on beverages or bread . He had no problems frequently helping the 2 tables next to us who had arrived AFTER us!! I flagged him down and asked to speak to his manager. I ask the manager if he would be so kind to get us refills and some bread since Jason never asked us if we wanted another appetizer instead. I expressed to the manager that i had never felt so discriminated against in a restaurant like this ever. He gave me a less than sincere apology but assigned us a much better waiter named jonathan who we made sure got a good tip since he was helpfull and very attentive.  Never saw the manager again after our meal to see how we were doing... i guess he must have better things to do than follow up with his customers. In the end...food is overpriced and bland, the service is horrid. Wont be back."
Araceli R.,"San Jose, CA",25,9,,1.0,11/4/2014,"So disappointed! I have been a regular at the Cheesecake Factory for 8 years. This was my go to place, to have a great dinner with friends, and have a drink from time to time. I recommended to my boss to order her for our in office lunch. I ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps from the appetizer menu. When I got to work, I started eating them and noticed on one of the leaves was a pretty good amount of DIRT!...I couldn't believe it, I looked at all of the leaves of lettuce and more than half of them had dirt on them! Not just a little spec but a lot, it was pretty visible. Common sense to wash the food well before preparing and serving is it not?....I am seriously so disappointed because this has always been my favorite place. The food there is fantastic but this slip up really changed my mind. Now I've got to find another place. Thanks :(."
May L.,"Arcadia, CA",1,4,18,4.0,7/26/2012,"Had a really late dinner at the cheesecake factory, since the kids had to eat at home first. When we got there it was like 10pm, but still 20mins waiting. Guess one of the reason is the neighborhood restaurants close at 9pm or 10pm...while CKF close at 11pm! Big plus!  We were seated at the booth... 4 adults and 2 monsters! Our server caught that we were with the kids! She promptly bought out two plates of dragonfly made with bread n' banana slices for the kids!! That was so sweet and we were v. impressed!  Food were always fair. Good service is the catch."
Anna N.,"New York, NY",455,170,32,2.0,4/27/2013,"It bugs me that this place doesn't take reservations and that it is always packed to the brim on weekend evenings. I came with my parents at around 7PM and we ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table. We ordered almost immediately once we were seated. I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo, my mom got the cajun jambalaya pasta, and my dad ordered the kobe burger. The wait was ridiculous! I understand that they're busy on a Friday evening but we waited almost 40 minutes for the pasta and gumbo. Then, our waitress, noticing that we still hadn't received the burger, went back to check. It turned out that she had never entered the order! It took another 20 minutes for the burger to come out. At that point, my dad was pretty mad. Our waitress was extremely apologetic about it though. She gave us a complimentary slice of cheesecake to make up for the delay.  Regardless of the forgotten burger, the wait time for food was unacceptable. My gumbo was good and I think that I would come back just for that dish...but I won't, because it would probably take me an hour just to start eating."
Nikki W.,"San Jose, CA",1971,128,,4.0,1/21/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory was one of our favorites food establishments, but lately we have not come so often because of the location/drive. We love the white baguette breads, and my favorite pasta dish has been the Pasta Da Vinci. They were always consistent with their foods, which we enjoyed. The avocado eggrolls, fried calamari, sweet corn tamales cakes were all great appetizers. The steak hibachi and steak Diane were also good dishes, with the steaks cooked just right. Our favorite dessert was the Godiva Cheesecake, hands-down the best cheesecake! Overall, the service on the many times we have visited were great, but sometimes the wait were long, so that's a con."
Jenn K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",123,256,35,5.0,2/27/2013,"5 stars for the always delicious food and for Gilbert the bartender at the Stevens creek location by valley fair!! Gilbert is prob the nicest person ever! My coworker and I come here for a few drinks and a snack after work and he totally has our jack and coke and dirty martini all ready when he sees us. He's really sweet and nice to talk to! Great customer service! It is my goal to try every item on their menu. I always take 20 mins just to figure out what I want. Everything I have tried has been delicious so far!! Few of my favs: Santa Fe salad.. The cilantro dressing is sooooooooo good!!! I'm obsessed with cilantro FYI Tex mex egg rolls.. Perfectly crispy with bold bold bold flavors. I'm drooling just thinking about it  Vietnamese tacos.. The bun is so soft and the meat is perfectly seasoned with the perfect amount of tang and sweetness  Buffalo blasts.. Think of buffalo wings but without the bone and deep fried on the outside. Sooo good! Perfect seasoning too Spicy Louisiana chicken pasta.. Bowie pasta with parm chicken in a spicy Cajun sauce. Uh huhhhh. No further description needed There's so much more but I can't remember. I think whatever you order here, it's safe to say it won't disappoint!"
Caroline D.,"San Jose, CA",1,14,1,4.0,10/26/2014,"I love the dark bread, Filet Mignon and Godiva Cheesecake-these are my favorite reasons to come here. Waiting time can be a little long and the ambient noise a little loud but other than that I am big fan of the Cheesecake Factory."
Alexis H.,"Fremont, CA",4,71,3,3.0,9/16/2013,"I got a couple of Cheesecake Factory gift cards and somehow managed to wrangle my other half into joining me. We waited about ten minutes. It's not fine dining or anything, but we got a booth far from the madd'ning crowd and an relatively attentive waiter. I ordered: -Southwestern Eggroll (2.5 stars). I got it without the avocado, and I think it lost a little something because of it. -Hibachi Steak (3 stars). Medium well done. I wasn't expecting much from this place, but the shitake mushrooms and sauce really elevated the dish. My husby ate the leftovers, and he hates anything other than well done. -Hershey cheesecake (3 stars) Because why would you go to the eponymous restaurant without sampling their namesake? The husby ordered Fried chicken sliders (5 stars) the best part of the entire meal. The flavors were spot on. Grilled porkchop (3 stars). I liked it, he didn't. Dulce de leche cheesecake (???) This is one item I never sample....he has a very personal relationship with this particular cheesecake. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but I would never go without a gift card...too expensive for the quality. I don't mind spending money on good food, but this was only so-so."
Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,4.0,8/22/2013,"My friends and I met here for dessert one recent evening.  The place was still packed at 730pm on a Wednesday night.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Doesn't anyone cook at home anymore!?  Once we got to the table, our waitress was very attentive.  She took our drink order then came back for our food orders. 4 of us had cheesecake and one had the apple turnover.  We all enjoyed our desserts.  I had the Adam's peanut butter variety.  I love the flavor, especially the peanut butter frosting on top.  Definitely a great place to go for dessert if you want a big variety of options."
G K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,82,,4.0,5/5/2015,GREAT bar service! Good cocktails and FRESH salads....the side caesar salad is large and delicious!
John F.,"Vacaville, CA",61,72,10,5.0,10/18/2014,Came all the day from Vacaville Ca. Our waiter's name is Robert. We ordered the Chinese salad full size and pasta for the kids. Our meal is tasty and refreshing. Robert hooked us up with the bread and our meals in a timely matter. I got nothing negative to say but thank you. We'll comeback next time.
B P.,"San Jose, CA",0,64,1,4.0,3/8/2016,Came here today and had the Georgia peach ! What can I say this drink is soooo gooooood  omg so good I want to go back and get another one but it was $11.50 for a small little glass :( despite the price (even though I docked a star for it) it was really good and I recommend this drink to anyone who wants to drink without feeling the alcohol. Thank you cheesecake for having this drink
qirk z.,"Los Gatos, CA",81,1126,375,4.0,2/11/2013,"Ordered the Reeses PBC Cheesecake, and a Cuban sandwich w/ fries. Had the cheesecake come first, yum. Confused the food server as he wasnt sure if that was the table to serve the entrees, as he saw me eating the cake. Sure enough, it was, and it took like five seconds before he dropped off the entrees. Split bites between the cake and the fries, and sandwich. The Cuban was good.  I was stuffed. I think the cake put me over the top. ~~~ Must make note to self, fish and chips are so so. The lunch is 3pc, the dinner is 5pc. They are not all equal sized so you make get jipped on portion ~~~ The Mac n cheese hamburger is awesome and huge!!  Awesome."
Dinah M.,"San Jose, CA",0,109,1,4.0,8/23/2016,"I'm not a chain restaurant fan.  This review is written based on putting Cheesecake Factory in context on that level, and not comparing it to a non-chain restaurant.  I had the Factory Burger there last night.  Asked for it medium rare and that's *exactly* how it arrive.  A very pleasant surprise, and often MR gets translated to medium.  The fries were nice and freshly done.  My negative on both the burger and fries were a significant lack of seasoning...neither had any discernible salt.  You just can't leave food unseasoned and expect it to taste good.  And if you don't salt a fried item *immediately* after removing from the fryer the seasoning won't stick to it.  So get with it CF...season your food!  Otherwise, I have no criticisms...it was a good burger and fries and the portion size was perfect as far as I was concerned...not huge (thank you!), but definitely enough to fill you up (well, I ended up only eating half and taking the rest home)."
