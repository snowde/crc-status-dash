Guille D.,"Los Gatos, CA",18,267,227,1.0,4/1/2015,"Ok.. Yes.. I saw several mice running around while I was eating. Didn't say anything, but why were the mice there? I find out that this place has a rat and mice problem for a long long time.. I left my food and paid, left and never turned back.. I would look around the floor while you walk and eat, you might see a mice.. if you have cheese on your plate, try feeding it, it might enjoy your company more..than your appetite."
Rosavida C.,"Santa Clara, CA",256,254,237,3.0,10/28/2013,"Fourth Cheesecake Factory experience in my whole life.  Servers were attentive. The restaurant had the A/C blasting when it was 50 degrees outside. Not sure why? It was so cold that the butter was unspreadable, yet technically at ""room temp."" Haha. The food in my opinion isn't worth the price, but I guess it's just the thing you have to get through in order to justify your dessert. Really though, I don't think taking a filet of salmon and throwing some teriyaki sauce on it is worth $16 bucks, but hey - they get away with it all the time. The sheer amount of calories per dish is insane. By the way, each slice of cheesecake is actually FOUR servings. You eat the whole thing, you're getting upwards of about 1300-1600 calories. I hope you don't plant on eating anything else.   Came here at around 9PM on a Monday night, so the wait was only 10 min."
Pat R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,37,,2.0,5/18/2015,Lunch today. Had lunch size cobb salad which was huge but so bland. The chicken had no taste whatsoever and the crumbled egg around the plate looked like it came from an industrial version of egg. Added pepper and had ranch dressing to sprinkle over it but every mouthful just tasted like lettuce.  The service was lovely but this salad was a nothing. Sad.
Aparna K.,"San Jose, CA",31,180,198,5.0,5/18/2014,One of my favorite places. Jamaican black pepper shrimp is to die for. Mango salsa paired with it is something made in heaven. I pretty much tried All their cocktails and dinner entrées. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!   Can get super busy during weekends. So get there ahead of time.
Michaela C.,"San Jose, CA",25,19,,4.0,4/19/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely great place to eat. Service is very good, portions are pretty big, prices are fine. However, this place gets very busy in the evenings when it's dinner time. And so you are put on a waiting list and it might take a while before you get a table."
Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",301,1475,174,2.0,7/17/2011,"Of all of the restaurants within a 3 mile radius, our crew couldn't agree on a cuisine, so we went middle of the road: Cheesecake Factory. I am not a Cheesecake Factory fan, but didn't weight in as I'm always willing to give the place ""Another shot"".  After waiting the prescribed 45 minutes, (We got here at 8:30PM), we sat and ordered. Since, I'm not a fan, I went for a simple Chinese Chicken salad to avoid trying exotic foods. The salad was fair...not great.....just fair. Service was ok, ambiance was way too formula for me.    We had fun dining at Cheesecake factory despite these woes. I probably will continue to pass CKF without stopping, but got in my obligatory annual trip."
Jennifer T.,"Campbell, CA",93,227,483,4.0,4/30/2013,"okay i love this chain. they have everything on their menu so you can't really have someone not find anything. that can also be the down fall cause you want everthing! all i know is that if you sit in the bar area, there is an upbeat gal that has a flower in her hair, blond. she is a 49er fan! she was one of the best servers ive ever had. i'm in love with their fish tacos, which you can get grilled or fried (love that you have the option). also a fan of their grilled artichokes. chain haters you can't hate on these guys cause they are awesome. amazing items: fan of their ice tea, grilled artichokes, carrot cheesecake, stuffed mushroom, mashed potatoes, grilled ahi, asian salad,  grilled fish tacos, parm chicken...list goes on those are a few. not: half salads are huuuuuuge!"
Jen H.,"San Diego, CA",334,1885,187,3.0,4/29/2011,"Avoid eating here Fridays and Saturdays night!! Normally, I avoid going to ""chain restaurants."" This was my first time back at Cheesecake factory in over one year. There are just so many good ""mom and pop,"" non-chain/franchised restaurants out there! I rather spend my money there if they are equally as good as the chained restaurants.  Ordered: Louisiana Pasta (4/5) Pad Thai Pasta(3/5) A couple more other dishes that were not noteworthy. The house bread was delicious, especially the brown one. I like to dip the bread in ranch--a new discovery, thanks to L :)"
Rose C.,"Milpitas, CA",227,364,197,2.0,9/13/2011,"My previous experiences with Cheesecake have been better, but Sunday night was just a disaster!  My mother has never been to Cheesecake Factory and she's not really the type to spend over 10 dollars for an entree, but since my sister and I were craving, we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory. The previous times I've been there I've loved it. The cheesecake is delicious (they have so many flavors!) and the pasta is good. However, I usually go there for lunch when the food is MUCH MUCH cheaper! I was saddened to find that the Pasta Da Vinci is almost 18 dollars....EIGHTEEN DOLLARS? Geez. I can buy two pairs of jeans and a top at Ross or at Forever21. My sister also wanted the same thing so we ended up both getting the Pasta Da Vinci. My mother wanted something with shrimp so we ordered her the Pasta Franchese and it was HORRIBLE. Something clearly went wrong in the cooking process. The breaded shrimp was delicious, but the pasta was incredibly salty. If you ate just one strand your mouth would blow up with saltiness. Unlike the description on the menu, there was only 2 or 3 pieces of artichoke hearts within the pasta. We asked the waitress to swap out of the pasta, and she did, and came back with a new batch which was still salty, and so we asked for Penne instead which was STILL disgustingly salty. My mother didnt end up eating any of her food which wasted a good 15 dollars. It wasn't the waitress's fault, she was very sweet and accommodating, but really? Why was the pasta so damn salty? My food was fine. So the bill came out to 53 dollars plus an 8 dollar tip, but my mother refuses to ever go again. Also, it was freakin' cold in there. Bring a jacket or light sweater when you eat there!"
Tina L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,23,,4.0,4/27/2014,This location was better than san francisco. Easy to find parking and staffs were nicer I normally ordered pasta or salad Really big portion Dessert should be original or tiramisu cheese cake So yummy
Nguyen T.,"Milpitas, CA",348,10,,5.0,3/30/2015,"This place a great and has free BREAD! The food taste restaurant quality and prices are not neck cutting expensive. Expect to pay around $30 for two people with no drinks, appetizers, or dessert."
Vibhusha J.,"Milpitas, CA",3,50,20,5.0,2/4/2014,"This place is just awesome. People who serve are always friendly and full of every and food is just delicious. My fav there is an appetizer ""sweet corn tamale cakes"". This is the main reason why I go there every other weekend. Pastas there are also pretty good.  But there can be long queues at times. I have even waited for 40-60 min sometimes.But you can always check the mall (westfield valleyfair) in the meanwhile (make sure u dont go too far with their device or may get out of range.better to come back 5 min earlier the estimated time)"
Margaret L.,"San Jose, CA",32,110,3,3.0,1/13/2015,"Portions are large but the cheesecakes are always so good here. Parking can sometimes be an issue. I wish some people learned to read. A couple of people parked in the curbside pick up thinking it was regular parking. Hello, read the signs. You didn't just get lucky with finding a parking space right in front of the restaurant."
Michelle M.,"Belmont, CA",197,1852,605,4.0,12/29/2010,"Valley Fair Cheesecake Factory.  You are such a busy place.  This place always has a wait, but nothing like SF during the holidays.  Just be patient and wait for them to call you. Notes: Best to look on their website to know what you want to order.  Then you have a game plan and can order right away.  I went during lunch time and ordered the salad and pizza combo.  It was way too much food so I ate the salad and took the pizza home, yay for two meals!  If you are in a big group you have to get the deep fried mac n' cheese balls.  Uh so good! Cheesecake:  There are so many flavors.  And they are kind of expensive $$$$ 6-8 per slice.  My all time favorite is their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Want to try Red Velvet, Reese's Pieces and the 30th anniversary."
Hoàng Anh T.,"San Jose, CA",67,6,7,5.0,2/20/2015,"Have to wait half an hour, but it's worth. Try the Combination Diane Steak with shrimp and Red Velvet Cheese Cake. It's so delicious..."
Cheryl E.,"San Jose, CA",121,4,,2.0,1/19/2016,"This review isn't reflected on the cheesecake that i had... The cheesecakes are really good without the doubt... But the server that I had, named Emerald, was a terrible server. I think she was my sever a few years back, but it doesn't matter, because this is the second time i came here with bad customer service and i only went to this location twice. As soon as she started taking my friend's and my order, we immediately felt uncomfortable and rushed through our cheesecakes, when we just wanted to enjoy our cheesecakes and talk and just have a great time. And its not like we felt rushed because it was a dinner rush, there wasn't a waiting list when we got our table so really we shouldn't have felt rushed to begin with. All in all my friends and I had a bad experience. It's not like i wanted the server to cozie to our every need, but i should feel appreciated that i am providing the store with job security. We're at Valleyfair, sure we're youngsters, but you don't make our experience bad, especially when there are more hardworking employees at the food court who show better customer service in the 1 minute time frame you get when ordering, and they don't even get tips. I will not be going to this location EVER again, i can get my cheesecake from another location that will provide good service."
Kai H.,"San Jose, CA",55,38,1,1.0,8/30/2012,"HELL NAW. HELL NAW. AND HELLLLLLL NAW. lol I came here for my birthday dinner with a party of 15 people.  Of course, I expected a little wait as I was told there were no reservations.  It was on a Saturday so I didn't expect to be seated right away or for a table to all of a sudden become available for a big ass group...  I was told a table opened up so OF COURSE I anticipated being seated next. well shit was I wrong! about 10 ten minutes after being told we were to be seated, a group a girls, wearing barely there dresses and sky high heels walked right up to the hostess I was talking to and said...table for 14 please.....and THEY WERE SEATED IMMEDIATELY when our wait was OVER AN HOUR!!! Are you frickin kidding me?!  I DIDN'T REALIZE I HAD TO LOOK LIKE A STRIPPER TO GET FAST SERVICE AROUND HERE!!!! Had I known I wouldve worn my freak em dress and clear platform heels. I was ripping them new assholes left and right....they just brought out the HOOD in me lol So allll in all a total of 2 hours of waiting, we FINALLY got seated and got free appetizers. I feel like the whole night shouldve been free for all the crap we went through just to eat dinner. After dinner plans were canceled due to the fact it was just too late. I havent dined here since and NEVER WILL! horrible service. and 2 middle fingers up to the staff! P.S-thanks for the complimentry slice of cheesecake assholes!"
Dana W.,"Mountain House, CA",310,160,309,3.0,10/29/2014,"We ordered curb side which was really fast and convenient. Call your order in ahead of time pull into one of there curb side parking spots and call the number on the sign and they will be out with your order in minutes. I felt bad for the young guy that helped me he just had his wisdom teeth pulled and he still came to work because he knew that they were short on cashier's... that's a trooper if I ever saw one! As for the food Chinese chicken salad was mediocre probably wouldn't order that again, Tex mex egg roll I would have to say chillis has them beat and probably wouldn't order that again as well. I offer the crispy chicken costeletta and that was probably the best thing and I would order that again except I would ask them for extra lemon sauce since it was a little on the dry side.. diffinetly needs more sauce..."

So we waltzed straight to the bar and scored two corner stools. Habachi Stake was delishious. As I dug in to meal I felt loved by the taste of the stake and enoyed it halfway through. Then something odd happened. All of the sudden my stake tasted too sweet. I kept eating but the closer I came to finish it the sweeter it became. And I had some left over which rarely happens. But it was still delish. Hungry Hippo was happy with his meal. Beer selection is limited but im not gonna complain, heeheee."
