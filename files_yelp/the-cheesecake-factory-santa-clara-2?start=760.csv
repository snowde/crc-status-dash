Jesus J.,"San Jose, CA",14,2,1,5.0,1/19/2014,"Rebecca kassel, is just one of the most amazing servers I've had. My friend and I came down to have a late dinner, and she just made our night. There are servers that are good, others great, but she was outstandingly wonderful. I totally recommend her as a server if its your planning on a late night dinner. We will definitely come back for her."
Kalei Y.,"Fullerton, CA",3,1,,3.0,1/17/2015,"This specific location was extremely busy so I took our group of eight 2hours to be seated. Iv been to other locations and I get the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and it's amazing. I ordered the dish at this location and it was awful. The chicken was dry and tasteless, the noodles were over cooked, and I had to ask for extra sauce because it was tasteless. Everyone who ordered pasta didn't like it but everyone who order anything else but pasta said it was amazing. I would have gave this location -1 stars based on the pasta and the wait but because everyone else's dishes were good and the cheesecake was amazing I give it a 3"
Shaheen S.,"San Jose, CA",7,27,2,3.0,4/18/2013,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, Your patrons don't like it when the wait staff hovers over us. Attentive service is welcome, but please ask your staff to allow us to finish our food before attempting to take away our plates. Let us enjoy our meal (even if we do so at a leisurely pace!), and don't try to hustle us out the door. This will keep your fans coming back for more of that fine cuisine you are famous for."
Veronica S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",492,279,547,4.0,10/14/2010,"Since their cheesecake is classic famous yummy in my tummy, I am not reviewing this joint for the fact that I cannot seem to lose weight. This review is about everything but the cheesecake. Happy hour? They weren't  joking! Cosmopolitan, Margarita, Long Island and Mojiot for $5 AND the appetizers! $5 calamari, rolls etc etc during Happy Hour is my Happy Hour dream-come-true. Happy Hour starts at 4pm and ends at 6 pm. They have a full bar and the bartenders are awesome! They know I mean alcohol and that's what I get. hehe. The Mai Tai is deadly and the martini is as dirty as it gets (only if you like). Their fish of the day is always fresh and their Luau Salad - smashing. Staff is attentive and if you come here early, there's plenty of seating. Cozy and the ambiance is pretty cool. I always love coming to this branch too. It's a few walks away from Santana Row, Macy's and Valley Fair Mall. If you run outta cashy, Chase is right around the corner too. My favorite cheesecake,  if I may recommend - tiramisu."
Lyna F.,"San Jose, CA",64,36,116,2.0,6/9/2014,"I went here yesterday for my lunch date, usually Cheesecake Factory doesn't let me down, but for some for some reason, our waitress yesterday was very rude. We originally had a male server; his service was great, we loved it, but when we were introduced to her, she made my table felt as though we were trouble to her. One of the plates that we ordered was the Cajun jambalaya, usually the dish is really good, but yesterday, it was bland. We asked her if we can have some marinara sauce to add to the dish, she came back with it, yet tossed it on the table. I myself have been going here for years, but after yesterday, I would not come back. The one on oakridge may not be as good, but the servers are genuinely nice."
Cheri A.,"San Jose, CA",13,17,86,5.0,1/13/2014,"I love this restaurant, we come here a lot and just cant get enough. Some times the wait can be a little long but for us its worth it, when we go out were in no rush so the wait doesn't bother us. The menu has a great selection and the service is always amazing. Some of the tables can be a little close to others on busy days but if your willing to wait a booth is better. But once we sat close to another older couple who was celebrating their 36th anniversary and we ended up pushing our tables together and had a nice dinner with them, so sometimes it just works better in the end!  Tips: Come before 6pm, we usually do an early dinner at 5:30 and the wait if any is short, weekends of course are busy so lunch time is better, or around 8pm for a late dinner.  p.s. We love the deep fried macaroni and cheese appetizer!"
Julie T.,"San Jose, CA",138,286,1131,3.0,7/26/2011,I just came in to pick up a birthday cake for a coworker.  I had called ahead of time and told them I would pick up at 7pm.  Sorry! I came 40 minutes earlier than i had said.  Thank you to the girl at the bakery for telling me nicely that the cake was still in the back because I was early.  I sat down and waited patiently as they got my cake.   I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheese cake.  it was very rich.  I could only eat a very small slice.  It looked gorgeous with the dark chocolate crust and the white chocolate and raspberry swirled in the cheese cake.
Amie N.,"San Jose, CA",103,10,5,4.0,12/21/2014,"My boyfriend and I visited here sometimes during anniversaries or holidays.  So it mostly always crowded and long line waiting.  Yet, food is good!  Service is not bad; we did have to wait quite long, but not a big deal when we had good time. In addition, I love the original cheesecake here, which is not too sweet. I prefer to take the cheese cake without adding flavors."
Carter S.,"Tacoma, WA",16,10,2,3.0,1/31/2015,"It was our first time here and we were very excited to try this place. The service was very good, our server Daniel was very full of energy and polite. The food took a little bit too much to arrive to the table, like 25 minutes, but we understand, it was busy. The things is we packed some things to go because we were full and when they brought things back we grab them and left. When we got home, one of the boxes was food from another table, which really ruined the whole experience. We were very excited to finish our food later but nope, I'm not eating other people's lunch. So, yeah, that screwed the review of this place (sorry but food wasn't free) we'll go back, but will check 3 times before leaving and so should you if you go."
Madeleine H.,"San Jose, CA",99,38,38,4.0,8/29/2010,"Evan's Thoughts Cheesecake Factory...why you so delicious?  Time and time again I have been impressed by the quality and diversity of the food they serve.  I truly have never gotten a bad dish here.  It's great for dates, family dinners, brunches, lunches, and anything in between.  If you like great food, you'll love the Cheesecake Factory.   Note:  Another equally great option:  Cheesecake on the go!  They're famous for their decadent cheesecakes (which is an understatement) and you can now obtain that heavenly cheesecake even quicker!  They also have loafs of the bread they serve to each table prior to dinner for $3.50...beautiful. ************************************* Madeleine's Thoughts I have eaten at several different Cheesecake Factories across the US but this is the first one I have reviewed. As far as chain restaurants go, this one is great. They have tasty bread, fairly quick service (at this one), and great cheesecakes! I got a great shrimp angel hair dish and loved the crab bites and avocado eggrolls. For dessert (because you would be insane to not eat dessert here) we got a piece of Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake and the Reeses something something Cheesecake (it's a new flavor). Both were delicious. The Reeses sneakily has a layer with snickers in it, and the chocolate cake actually contains a layer of coconut cheesecake to break up that chocolatey goodness. Scrumdidlyumptious! I will definitely be coming back, if just for dessert... :)"
Nathaniel H.,"Springfield, MO",4,38,12,4.0,9/1/2013,"Normally I don't have problems when I eat at any Cheesecake Factory. This one experience was a complete turn around. The food was great, but I had all kinds of issues with having to wait for things. Waiting to be seated after being called (with other groups being called and seated before me), waiting to order a drink, waiting for that drink, and waiting for an appetizer. Dirty dishes were also a problem. Luckily, they started a shift change while I was eating. Everything changed for the better. Quicker response times, more attentiveness, etc. My second waitress was much better at her job than the hostesses or my original waiter. All that said, I did complain to the manager. He appeared to be very concerned with the issues I had and voluntarily gave me a significant discount on my meal. He did a great job of turning a bad experience into a more positive one. I would have rated my visit as a 1 or 2 star, but given the turn around, I have increased it to 4."
Sydney M.,"San Jose, CA",47,123,939,3.0,10/11/2010,"After a long day in the concentration camp the bf was hungry, and after a short 1 day off this week, and shopping madness at the new TARGET store, we opted to try this place. Maybe late Sunday night is the rack?  Was told about 15mins was only like 5 to get seated for two.  Cool interior.   Drinks: Strawberry smoothie  $5.95 Icy, watery, not much flavor, skip. House (Berriger) white zin; $6.95 - you gotta be kiddin,  for a less than 1/2 filled glass?  skip... Apps: Fried Mac & cheese:  crispy outside, creamy inside.  not much zing, a little sweet, needed some pep.  creamy and fresh tomato sauce.  $8.95 for 4??  idk, 2 for $4.99 would have been better, and didn't like the slightly sweet cheesy flavor.  skip.  when they packed the lefties they didn't include any sauce...  Kids would love it tho, they's be happy with just this. Sweet corn Fritters:  very good.  hush puppy type breading, perfectly cooked corn.  $4.95 for six or so, good value for money.  Mustard sauce?  Not!  more like chipotle mayo.  still, good with the fritters.  Lefties were packaged w/o sauce...  :( entres: Pasta carbonara.  Superb!  Lots of bacon flavor. Diff server, but she  brought fresh basil when asked and offered fresh cheese.  $13.50.  Nice portion, but over priced.  You and me know how much we can make this for at home... Special:  fried shrimp platter $13.95. Great portion, lots of butterflyed crispy shrimp with fatastic tartar sauce (big hit of garlic) and light coctail sauce; needed a bit of zip, some hot sauce offered would have been nice.  Outstanding coleslaw and perfectly cooked frites, katsup was offered and accepted.  Minus!  Again, forgot to pack my coleslaw in the lefties...I know, I should have looked in the bag....sigh.   It was really good... Deserts: Apple caramel strusel.  Fantastic.   Banana cream:  another big hit; the whipped cream stood up for two whole days!  BF used to be a card-carrying cheesecake hater!  Dare I say we've witnessed a new birth? ...LOL Other pluses:  Ryan was pretty attentive and appologized when he was taking too long.   when Ryan boxed our lefties, he provided two fresh warm loaves of the breads for EACH of us wrapped in foil.  big plus there.  we didn't ask for that, we'd been happy just to take what we left on our table.  diff server brought fresh basil when asked and offered fresh cheese for the bf's pasta. Minus:  Someone else served our entre's and got the bf's wrong.  Though she said ""cabonara"" and we both pointed to the bf, we thought it was strange it had bowtie pasta.  Then we noticed the chicken.  BF specifically ordered no chic.  New lady server went to get the cheese, and when she came back bf pointed out the error.  She said something like, ""let me check"" something and disapeared.  The bf sneaked a few bites of the pasta.  Said it was WAAAAYYY undercooked...  Anyway, she comes back very appologetic and asks what he wants.  Well, he's DYING for some creamy pasta full of bacon!  So away goes the offending dish, and wham zam, the correct dish is in front of the bf.  I think he got served somebody else's dish...oh well, it happens... Attentive service at first got lax as the evening wore on, but hey, they got busy, and we weren't in a hurry.  Again, nice Ryan appolgized when he laxed.  Some fresh sauce in a small plastic container for the fritters and mac would have made a five star.  And they completely didn't box my leftie coleslaw, that I paid for.... :( Total for above w/o tax or gratuity:  $75.10 We thought the wine and pasta was over priced.  There's lots on the menu we want to try, but we will skip the high priced drinks and be more choosy about the apps and entree's, since we also felt the cabonara was overpriced for the portion, and if there's a next time, we will deff check our doggie boxes to make sure everything we paid for is in there.   we're going again, for sure"
Michael F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",378,305,460,4.0,6/10/2011,"I've been to this particular location several times.  Once for my 18th birthday celebration with a bunch of friends, and another time last night with three other friends.  The food is great and I'm absolutely addicted to their four cheese pasta.  My friends and I ordered calamari as an appetizer and they also gave us pretty good bread.  For dessert, of course, we all ordered cheesecakes.  Overall, I have no major complaints.  The food was great, our waitress was attentive, and the ambiance was pretty good too.  It can be a little on the pricey side, but, IMO, you get your money's worth.  I'll definitely be back again. 4 stars"
Brian B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",373,1302,44,3.0,6/7/2013,"Didn't spend too much time here, but it's just like any other Cheesecake Factory.  The food is expensive, but the portions are huge...so it kind of works out.  It's a fun place to take a group of people.  I think a lot of people go for the cheesecakes, more than anything."
Shel N.,"San Jose, CA",321,208,254,4.0,8/29/2011,"My usual here is either the steak Diane or the herb crusted filet of salmon. One neat thing about my usuals is that there is an option for both dish as one dish; best of both worlds!  Our server was really attentive, a bit too attentive."
Ron R.,"Fremont, CA",333,94,96,3.0,4/10/2013,"This is what I don't understand...why don't you allow call ahead seating or do reservations for a large party. Then you have to wait an hour plus. Geez, if I wanted to wait this long, I would have cooked at home.  How much more would you satisfy your patrons? I did not know that making your customers wait so long was part of the ""experience""."
Isabelle K.,"Austin, TX",186,572,452,4.0,9/10/2010,"It's across street of Santana Row and next to the mall.  The menu looks the same everywhere. It's like a book. Took me 10 minutes to read every page and every option. Finally we ordered a salad, pizza and shrimp + salmon scampi. The salad is so boring. Just several leaves and a piece of cheese. The pizza is boring too. The shrimp/ + salmon scampi looks pretty. Nice presentation. The shrimps are huge. The salmon is very soft, but lack of flavors. I ordered sweet potato side dish. It's pretty tasty. The strange guy next to me is very very annoying. He watched the baseball game and yelled all the time. Very loud. Really want to kick him out of that place."
Teri P.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,46,1.0,12/29/2014,"Cheesecake Factory needs to get better hostess.  The lady's that they have seating the customers are IDIOTS!!! We came during happy hour on 12/19/2014 asked for a table for 6 ppl in the bar area. The hostess said the wait would be 45 minutes when there were actually 2 open tables in the bar area. We told them and they said oh they have 2 parties of 6 waiting for those corner tables. We eventually found 2 pub tables next to each other. 1.5 hours after our dinner and cocktails the 2 corner table was still open.  Before we left we had our buddy pretend to be a new customer asking for the corner table and again the hostess said there is no table available, and they still had 3 ppl waiting for those corner tables.  Either the cheesecake manager instructed the hostess not to seat customers in the bar area during happy hour or they truly have idiot's hostess who actually don't know what they are doing."
JPhillip J.,"Stockton, CA",156,5,,1.0,1/17/2015,"Our experience sucked. This place is horrible. Our waitress Stephanie basically ignored my wife and I (along with our kids) after we placed our order. While everyone was getting served, we were just sitting there. My wife needed a refill on her iced tea, but nobody was around, so she refilled it herself. Never coming back here ever again. People, if you have kids, leave them at home if you wanna eat here because they'll straight up ignore you."
Alice H.,"Chicago, IL",368,436,280,4.0,8/20/2012,"Tips: $6.50 for a buttery nipple shot. $6-$9 for a slice of cheesecake. Free yummy rye and sourdough bread. Does not take reservations. -------------------------------------------- The food at cheesecake factory is awesome! I really do enjoy coming here although I really should come here only once in a while. After looking through the calorie counts for all the dishes you definitely start to regret the food. One time I got the Royal Caramel Macchiato which was SOO delicious, but it was 600 calories for a drink. It's a definite rainy day drink that comes warm. I love love love the cheesecake at cheesecake factory. (I mean their name is cheesecake factory right?! They better do the cheesecake justice.) I'm the type of person that LOVES the original cheesecake that's a solid chunk of cream cheese without any cake in it. Snickers Chunk Cheesecake - Very good! I really liked this cheesecake. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - This one wasn't very good to me. It seemed like a vanilla bean custard was the majority of the cheesecake while the bottom later of the cheesecake was in fact the original cheesecake. I don't think I'd get this one again. Buttery Nipple Shot - It was definitely tasty as a buttery nipple shot should be. Though I have to say that I've had better. Overall, I love the atmosphere at Cheesecake Factory and it's a great place to either be casual or even dress-up a bit. This restaurant is versatile like that. The service I've gotten there has always been good as well."

Attentive service at first got lax as the evening wore on, but hey, they got busy, and we weren't in a hurry.  Again, nice Ryan appolgized when he laxed.  Some fresh sauce in a small plastic container for the fritters and mac would have made a five star.  And they completely didn't box my leftie coleslaw, that I paid for.... :( Total for above w/o tax or gratuity:  $75.10 We thought the wine and pasta was over priced.  There's lots on the menu we want to try, but we will skip the high priced drinks and be more choosy about the apps and entree's, since we also felt the cabonara was overpriced for the portion, and if there's a next time, we will deff check our doggie boxes to make sure everything we paid for is in there.   we're going again, for sure"
Michael F.,"Sunnyvale, United States",378,305,460,4.0,10/6/2011,"I've been to this particular location several times.  Once for my 18th birthday celebration with a bunch of friends, and another time last night with three other friends.  The food is great and I'm absolutely addicted to their four cheese pasta.  My friends and I ordered calamari as an appetizer and they also gave us pretty good bread.  For dessert, of course, we all ordered cheesecakes.  Overall, I have no major complaints.  The food was great, our waitress was attentive, and the ambiance was pretty good too.  It can be a little on the pricey side, but, IMO, you get your money's worth.  I'll definitely be back again. 4 stars"
Brian B.,"Santa Cruz, United States",373,1302,44,3.0,7/6/2013,"Didn't spend too much time here, but it's just like any other Cheesecake Factory.  The food is expensive, but the portions are huge...so it kind of works out.  It's a fun place to take a group of people.  I think a lot of people go for the cheesecakes, more than anything."
Shel N.,"San Jose, United States",321,208,254,4.0,29/8/2011,"My usual here is either the steak Diane or the herb crusted filet of salmon. One neat thing about my usuals is that there is an option for both dish as one dish; best of both worlds!  Our server was really attentive, a bit too attentive."
Ron R.,"Fremont, United States",333,94,96,3.0,10/4/2013,"This is what I don't understand...why don't you allow call ahead seating or do reservations for a large party. Then you have to wait an hour plus. Geez, if I wanted to wait this long, I would have cooked at home.  How much more would you satisfy your patrons? I did not know that making your customers wait so long was part of the ""experience""."
Isabelle K.,"Austin, United States",186,572,452,4.0,10/9/2010,"It's across street of Santana Row and next to the mall.  The menu looks the same everywhere. It's like a book. Took me 10 minutes to read every page and every option. Finally we ordered a salad, pizza and shrimp + salmon scampi. The salad is so boring. Just several leaves and a piece of cheese. The pizza is boring too. The shrimp/ + salmon scampi looks pretty. Nice presentation. The shrimps are huge. The salmon is very soft, but lack of flavors. I ordered sweet potato side dish. It's pretty tasty. The strange guy next to me is very very annoying. He watched the baseball game and yelled all the time. Very loud. Really want to kick him out of that place."
Teri P.,"San Jose, United States",0,23,46,1.0,29/12/2014,"Cheesecake Factory needs to get better hostess.  The lady's that they have seating the customers are IDIOTS!!! We came during happy hour on 12/19/2014 asked for a table for 6 ppl in the bar area. The hostess said the wait would be 45 minutes when there were actually 2 open tables in the bar area. We told them and they said oh they have 2 parties of 6 waiting for those corner tables. We eventually found 2 pub tables next to each other. 1.5 hours after our dinner and cocktails the 2 corner table was still open.  Before we left we had our buddy pretend to be a new customer asking for the corner table and again the hostess said there is no table available, and they still had 3 ppl waiting for those corner tables.  Either the cheesecake manager instructed the hostess not to seat customers in the bar area during happy hour or they truly have idiot's hostess who actually don't know what they are doing."
JPhillip J.,"Stockton, United States",156,5,,1.0,17/1/2015,"Our experience sucked. This place is horrible. Our waitress Stephanie basically ignored my wife and I (along with our kids) after we placed our order. While everyone was getting served, we were just sitting there. My wife needed a refill on her iced tea, but nobody was around, so she refilled it herself. Never coming back here ever again. People, if you have kids, leave them at home if you wanna eat here because they'll straight up ignore you."
Alice H.,"Chicago, United States",368,436,280,4.0,20/8/2012,"Tips: $6.50 for a buttery nipple shot. $6-$9 for a slice of cheesecake. Free yummy rye and sourdough bread. Does not take reservations. -------------------------------------------- The food at cheesecake factory is awesome! I really do enjoy coming here although I really should come here only once in a while. After looking through the calorie counts for all the dishes you definitely start to regret the food. One time I got the Royal Caramel Macchiato which was SOO delicious, but it was 600 calories for a drink. It's a definite rainy day drink that comes warm. I love love love the cheesecake at cheesecake factory. (I mean their name is cheesecake factory right?! They better do the cheesecake justice.) I'm the type of person that LOVES the original cheesecake that's a solid chunk of cream cheese without any cake in it. Snickers Chunk Cheesecake - Very good! I really liked this cheesecake. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - This one wasn't very good to me. It seemed like a vanilla bean custard was the majority of the cheesecake while the bottom later of the cheesecake was in fact the original cheesecake. I don't think I'd get this one again. Buttery Nipple Shot - It was definitely tasty as a buttery nipple shot should be. Though I have to say that I've had better. Overall, I love the atmosphere at Cheesecake Factory and it's a great place to either be casual or even dress-up a bit. This restaurant is versatile like that. The service I've gotten there has always been good as well."
