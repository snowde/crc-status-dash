Anne M.,"Stanford, CA",5,291,78,2.0,10/20/2014,"I have a major concern with this place. You arrive, they tell you that it's going to be 15minutes wait and give you a buzzer. The buzzer rings after 15m, you go up and hand it in to the lady who then asks you to stand in a line. Stand in the line and wait another 10m for someone to shout your name ( why can't the buzzer just ring when they are actually ready to seat you?). Then we are taken to our table, but we can't order because we have to wait for our server to come take the order, the lady that brings us to the table can't take any orders but water.  Once you order and can actually eat your food, you have someone come every 5m to ask if everything is ok, to ask if we are still working on this or can they clear the table, etc.  I appreciate that they want to make sure that everything is ok and want to provide good customer service, but the whole thing means that it is impossible to have a conversation because you are interrupted every 2 seconds. In addition, the whole thing feels really rushed, like they are trying to do everything as fast as possible. I went there to have a relaxing time and didn't.  The food: avocado egg rolls are pretty good. Ahi tartare is overpriced ( one mouthful of tuna, 4 tortilla chips and some avocado). Fries had a horrible aftertaste."
Piotr H.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,4,,4.0,2/7/2015,"Great food, including the cheesecake. Very nice service too. Only the interior is not much my style, all dark and orange."
Kathleen M.,"Napa, CA",6,15,2,2.0,1/7/2015,"I promised more.... Once we were able to eat, my salad and his pasta were perfect and delicious, but his pasta was then cold! Totally unfair that we've honestly had to go through this each and every time I order salad. We'll be back, plenty more times, I'm sure, but PLEASE address this issue!! As two people also in the food service industry, this is a pretty big misstep in service that cannot be overlooked."
Julia S.,"San Jose, CA",164,289,148,4.0,6/15/2011,"(+) - the place to go for practically any event (birthday, grad, etc.) - reasonably priced - huge menu selection - huge food portions (-) - can be a long wait I have been to this cheesecake factory countless times. It's really my fallback restaurant for any kind of occasion since usually everybody can find something they like on the menu which is huge. I love their free bread (especially the brown one). The louisiana chicken pasta is usually always a safe bet and the chopped factory salad is also amazing! its an appetizer but its frickin massive. My most recent trip here, I got the arugula salad which was only 5 bucks (under small plates and snacks) and a slice of black out cake (7 bucks). The arugula salad was pretty filling for being under ""small plate"" and the black out cake was sooooooo good, if you need a chocolate fix, this will totally hit the spot. but its huge so share with a friend! I think the food here is above average and has something for everyone, this is why sometimes when I want to try a new restaurant, me and my friends somehow end up back here haha. cheesecake will forever be our saftey restaurant!"
Anthony A.,"Santa Clara, CA",136,50,24,4.0,1/5/2015,Don't know why all my friends don't like cheesecake factory. I've always been a fan. I grab the Cajun Chicken Littles every time. Cheesecake is great too. Big portions for the price. I'll keep coming back.
Sandy Q.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",21,893,21,4.0,10/31/2014,"A while back, I was living in an apartment by this restaurant with my husband.  While I was pregnant with my first child, I would always come here with my husband for dinner every Friday.  I usually switch between the chicken madeira and this spicy shrimp & chicken dish (substituted pasta for rice).  I've also tried other dishes but have always come back to these 2 dishes.  Some times when we're craving for something sweet, we would order the strawberry shortcake.  The wait is always long but the food makes up for it.  Parking may be hard to find (if you only want to park near the entrance).  Every time we come here, customer service is good so no complaints there."
Thu N.,"San Jose, CA",271,182,60,4.0,9/21/2011,"I have to admit, the ONLY thing about Cheesecake Factory that makes me come back is the brown bread they serve while we are waiting for our order.  Location: convenient since it's inside Valley Fair shopping center However it's always crowded so you have to wait to be seated. The wait is actually not that long so It's not really a big deal. The price is of course a bit pricey. I have to say nothing special. For pasta, I would recommend going to Santana Row for better dishes with about the same price. Cheesecake here is...ok. It's probably for sweet treat I am not so picky so I'm fine with anything."
Albert C.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,61,,3.0,1/16/2016,"Always crowded even in late evenings because of its location I guess. 30min wait time or more is normal. Like all CF they have offer great service and great cheesecake. I do think the quality and selection of their pastas (CF in general) have gone down, which is quite disappointing."
Norma I.,"American Canyon, CA",294,132,280,4.0,3/29/2014,"I've been at this location a few times now. I am not a huge fan of big chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory has always been a fan favorite amongst several of my friends. It is a great place for friends to meet up and the menu has enough variety to satisfy most everyone's taste.   Surprisingly, I have never had an unusually long wait at this location, like I have at so many of the other Cheesecake Factories. Our wait was approximately 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad on a Thursday night. I have had as long as a 2 hour wait when I went to the Marina Del Rey location on a weekend night. Uuugh! We sat down at a table across the floor from the bar. The old world charm of the decor and the sultry lighting adds to the charm of this place. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with describing items on the menu that some of us were unfamiliar with. She was also great at making suggestions on certain items. I ordered one of their signature combinations: Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. It is a sauteed chicken breast with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese, topped with a mushroom Madeira Sauce. It is so tasty! It didn't sound at all that appealing on the menu, but I am so glad that it was suggested and I ordered it. The chicken was tender and the various flavors really made this dish a hit. I believe I found a new favorite! The Steak Diane are beef medallions covered with black peppercorns & a rich mushroom wine sauce, served with mashed potatoes. My meat was not cooked at all the way I asked! I told them I like my meat medium, more on the rare side, but no blood! I want it pink without blood oozing out! I was assured that they would make it the way I wanted, but that this would be considered medium cooked. It came to me tough and chewy. You would have thought I asked for it to be cooked well done. I hadn't plan to say anything because there was so much food on my plate that I knew I would not be able to eat it. Besides, I was enjoying my chicken. But one of my friends mentioned it to my waitress. She came over and I explained to her how the meat was. She took a look at it and agreed that it was over cooked. There was no pink in the meat at all. She went back to the kitchen and came back with another steak cooked exactly the way I had asked and my friend ate it because I was stuffed! He loved it! lol! My friends ordered a variety of cheesecakes to share, but I am not a huge fan of cheesecake. I had an ex- that had me on cheesecake overload and I have stayed away from it ever since! But OMG! The Strawberry Shortcake is so yummy! It is made on their own homemade biscuit, sprinkled with sugar and covered with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. I love it! I know most people come here to eat their incredibly tasting cheesecakes. There are so many to choose from. But I love the Strawberry Shortcake! All their dinner portions are huge. You can share a dish with a friend, but always save room for dessert. This is what you come here for! :) Enjoy!"
Emmitt W.,"Union City, CA",55,31,12,4.0,2/9/2015,What's not to love?!  Have to say this is my first time ordering the meatloaf and it did not disappoint. As for the cheesecake. How could we go without getting any?!  Dulce de leche alllll day!
Rebekah R.,"Newark, CA",142,1,,1.0,12/17/2014,"I cannot say a lot for the management and hostess. They were rude and did not look happy to accommodate a party of 9. After waiting an hour and a mix up of whose party was all there, we got the feeling they wanted us to leave. The manager Marsha was no help at all. My party ended up leaving after 1 and half. She was pleased to see us leave while she grinned. Afterwards we agreed upon Applebee's and we got better service within 2 minutes. Not going there ever again plus they ruined my birthday."
Gassan H.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/17/2015,Good service. But cold and hard fries. And the chicken sandwich I got was so hot in burned the roof of mouth. I def have been to better cheesecake locations than this one. Next time you have lunch in this area. Think twice before coming here.
Andrea S.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,3.0,1/11/2015,"My husband and I came here for a date night and this is my review of our visit.  Firstly, I was disappointed that we could not make reservations, because it always seems to be packed. So we showed up and was very busy for a Thursday evening; loud and crowded. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  After a few minutes our server brought us our drinks and bread and returned a few minutes later to take our order. We asked him what he would recommend and at first it seemed like he was a little annoyed with the questions. More like ""I'm busy, just hurry and order"", but after a minute he decided to be more helpful. My husband ordered the garlic noodle dish and I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken.  Both dishes were decent, not horrible but definitely nothing spectacular. Wouldn't order either dish again.  I went with the intention of having a slice of cheesecake for dessert but ended up not getting a slice after all.  Not for any bad reason,  I was just full.  So overall, everything was pretty average. Service, food, atmosphere."
Zooraw G.,"Ben Lomond, CA",2,35,,5.0,12/8/2012,"Perfect respite from the mall...after hours of shopping at Vally Faire we were dazed and hungry and we needed to refuel to finish our shopping excursion; the Cheesecake Factory was just the right place.   We had the miso salmon, the pot stickers and the spring rolls. ALL were very good.  Great quality and flavor.  The service was excellent. We will definitely be back to try more things off the menu (including cheesecake) I was really pleasantly surprised with this place.  Very good for a chain type restaurant."
Ab S.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/31/2014,Beth S treated my family and I like a royal. We are so happy with her service. Thank you Beth!
Stephanie H.,"Santa Clara, CA",1636,160,273,3.0,6/13/2012,"3.5 stars I really don't like American food. I really don't. Places like Cheesecake Factory have mediocre if not tasteless tasting food at ridiculous prices with high fat and cholesterol content.  I don't want to pay $10+ for a stupid salad, burger, sandwich, or bland spaghetti plate I could make myself. However, what I do give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars for are their homemade CHEESECAKES! They are pretty pricey, around $7 I think for a slice, but they are HUGE slices.  I can't finish one slice in one sitting.  I believe they have 50% off cheesecakes during some time of the year.  I wouldn't come here to eat anything besides their outstanding cheesecakes."
bhavya k.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,69,45,4.0,11/11/2012,Taking off 1-star due to the very limited selections for vegetarians. We tried the fettuccine alfredo pasta and the vege pizza and both were awesome.
Eunice S.,"San Jose, CA",57,72,3,4.0,6/20/2011,"I love cheesecake factory! Its like THE place to go on a date or a girls night out!   The service is always great, the food quantity is HUGE, so you will most likely be having left overs unless you are super hungry. Plus the food is tasty so why not take it home and eat it later?  I love coming here because the appetizers are awesome as well as their drinks! I personally like their appetizers more then their entrees. I've been to the cheesecake factory in Palo Alto but the quality sucks compared to the one here. I can never get bored of this place! The servers are also more friendlier here and cuter! =)"
Charlie S.,"San Jose, CA",2,7,,1.0,11/29/2014,Employees were rude from the get go. Food was shit but cheese cake was good. Don't recommend dinner. Just desert. They focus so much on image and their food is straight up booty.
Michael B.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/19/2015,The FOOD is great and the cheese cake was amazing  Service was great btw but it gets really busy so probably you will have to wait for a table And the cheesecake is out of this world
