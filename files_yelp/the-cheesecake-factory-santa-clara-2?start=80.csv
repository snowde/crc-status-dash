Jess K.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,5,5.0,11/21/2017,"The stars are all for service tonight, the food was good as usual but the service we got tonight was literally some of the best service I've ever gotten. I go out a lot. Gilbert was our server and he was super friendly, very on top of orders and getting our dishes out of the way. I have never left a restaurant more happy with my service than I did tonight."
Marla A.,"Toronto, Canada",11,52,107,4.0,9/15/2017,"I'm from Toronto, Canada and this was my first time eating here and it was great! We parked at the lot specifically for the restaurant and the gentleman at the booth was really helpful at showing us where the next available parking spot was. We came here for lunch and we were a party of six and to our surprise we were seated fairly quickly. Our server was extremely friendly and very funny too. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci and the Madeira Wine Sauce was a little overwhelming since the portion size was huge but it was tasty. The wait time for food was average. My cousins and I decided to each get a cheesecake to try. I got to try Salted Caramel, Oreo Dream Extreme, Hershey's Chocolate Bar, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. I must say my ultimate favorite is the White Chocolate Rasp. Truffle (I've had it a few times and clearly I'm obsessed). Overall experience was great! Cannot wait for the grand opening here in Toronto!"
Nedim N.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Their parking is really bad. They force you to use valet but it seems like there's always just one person working so you wait 40 minutes just so you can park. Makes little sense. Why not let people park their own cars. Much easier and faster. If you're willing to wait 45 minutes just to get in and eat, not because the food is so great but because their parking logistics are bad, then this place is for you."
Sammi L.,"Dublin, CA",1241,534,3726,3.0,8/20/2016,"Service here is slow! I think it is because of the large crowded parties that always come here to celebrate because Cheesecake Factory has the one of the most-reasonable pricing for their dishes. We had a party of 11 (cousins/relatives), we waited 45 minutes to sit on a Thursday night.... We were too hungry and tired so we didn't want to try other places since it was a struggle to find parking in this mall. Once we got seated, took them about 8 minutes to flag our waitress down since a lot of them said they didn't know who will be serving our table. After flagging our waitress it took another 10 minutes for her to bring us our water/drinks/bread. She brought us two trays of bread and one of the tray's bread was cold.... That ruined my appetite because I suppose that she just took it and didn't even bother to heat it up. We ordered pizzas, appetizers, pastas as usual but it took a while for them to bring out the appetizers before our entrees lol. We were a little disappointed but food was good so 3 stars~ Around $20 for a pasta dish that can feed at least 2-3 people is a deal. Their fresh strawberry cheesecake is also my favorite for dessert.  + Parking might be hectic here also as it's located in the Westfield mall."
Joon P.,"Santa Clara, CA",356,30,3,1.0,3/12/2017,"I gave this place 5 stars in 2014. And I've done 30 reviews on Yelp-- all of which are 5 stars. That changes tonight, I guess. I can't believe I'm writing a review in anger at 11 pm but it should not go unsaid. I called to place a Curbside order at appx 920 pm.  This was for the Valley Fair mall, Santa Clara location.  I was on hold for eleven minutes before someone answered.  I placed my order.   I arrived at the location immediately, they came out and I paid in cash.   Obviously it's the end of the dinner rush and Chzcake is a busy restaurant so I understood that it would take time for my order.  But 20 minutes passed.  Then 30.  Then 40.  Then 45.   47 minutes passed before I finally lost my patience and called in.  I told the hostess who answered the phone that I had been waiting over 45 minutes for my food.  She said she would get me to someone in bakery right away.  I was on hold for six minutes and no one picked up.   At this point, I was about to simply leave but realized that I had already paid.  And tipped!  I called back, the same hostess answered the phone and she told me she would get someone right away.  Someone at the bakery picked up and said they would bring the food right out. When I received the food, it was clearly evident that the pasta had been sitting for some time, as the food (which is covered inside of a box designed to stay hot) was slightly less than lukewarm.  I told the guy to just give me my money back. He went in and out came the manager.  Her name was Samantha Zaragoza (sp.?).  She handed me my cash.  Her words to me verbatim: ""Sir, your order tonight was $31, here's your cash-- did you need anything else tonight?"" I kind of wanted to say, ""Yes, my food, hot as it should be, delivered on time, without having to hold for a combination of over 15 minutes on the phone please :)"" but instead I decided to just leave. Cheesecake Factory is busy.  I get it. But it's a public company with a mission statement that is literally ""to create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority!"" I don't care what your labor cost is.  I don't care what your food cost is.  Hire more people.  Schedule more employees.  Find GMs that do not stand for this type of service and train managers to find solutions rather than being disappointing AND having no solution for an upset customer."
zahra b.,"San Francisco, CA",287,54,2,1.0,8/1/2017,"Woah. I just had one of my worst restaurant experiences ever here. A few friends decided to come out together for their July 31 cheesecake special. We arrived at 8:30pm and were told the wait would be 60-75 minutes long. No problem. We were seated at approximately 9:30pm. We came for the cheesecake special! It was advertised on their website, signage, etc. So place our orders, with some for dine in, which we assume will be on the special and some to go, which we assume will be full price. However, the waitress tells us we need to order entres to get the cheesecake discount. Except that's not anywhere in the marketing or fine print. She insists it is. One of the girls had been there the night before and says she wasn't required to do the same last night. The waitress says it was a mistake. We ask about all of the other people who have been in line and are there as it doesn't appear they are all ordering entres. The waitress says some of the other staff may be unfamiliar with the rules and undercharging people. We ask her to check with her manager.  She does. Her narrative stays the same. Entres are required. The sign at the door says it. I go look at the sign. It matches what corporate has on the site. One per person. Dine in only. Nothing about a required entre. We ask to see the manager.  The manager comes out. He apologizes and says he understands we have been waiting and will give us the 1/2 price cheesecakes. We ask about the confusion and he explains the wait staff were asked to encourage people to order entres to minimize the lines.  What in the world? Encourage and require are two very different things. Not to mention the lying about the posters and other people's orders.  Ok. We're all set. Cheesecakes were ordered nearly 30 minutes ago, pricing issues have been cleared up, and maybe we will enjoy the rest of the night? No.  10 more minutes go by and we still don't have our cheesecakes. One of the girls asks the waitress. Oops. Between the waitress and the manager and clarifying the misrepresentation about the promotion's requirements, they forgot to actually place the order."
CB Y.,"San Jose, CA",2,45,154,4.0,6/24/2017,"The cheese cake factory.  Best thing about this place is you can get a decent cheese cake after your meal.  And also you have variety of food choices  Like you can get a spring roll with pasta  Service is nice.  Table for two is too small tho.  I ordered shrimp scampi, buffalo wings and spiring rolls.  It was good. Shrimp scampi was blend.  Buffalo wing was really good. Crispy outside.  Spring roll I loved those sauces"
Rochelle E.,"Blossom Valley, San Jose, CA",445,264,288,1.0,2/23/2017,"Yuck and yuck! My co workers and I ordered to go from cheesecake and it wasn't a pleasant experience.  First, when they took our order, they said it would be ready in 30 minutes and it still wasn't ready in 50 after trying to find parking.The parking at valley fair is atrocious so just to find parking took my co worker about 20 minutes. Then, when we finally got our food back to work, it looked really unappetizing. The salad looked good and that's about to. The buffalo wings had no buffalo sauce and we were charged double the price listed on the website. When we ordered, we asked for some extras on the side and of course they weren't there even though they were on the receipt. For 2 people our bill was 50$ and that's without a tip. It was definitely not worth it for the quality of the food. I would have rather gone to McDonald's to get a salad and chicken nuggets."
Amadea M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,18,17,1.0,12/10/2017,"What an awful first time experience at The Cheesecake Factory! I went with a party of 6, and we had to wait over an hour until we got seated. While it was really busy, it had died down quite a bit once we got to our table. Service was super slow and it took another hour after ordering before we saw any food. What really bothered us was they brought out our food at different intervals. Two people got their plates first, then another two plates arrived 15 minutes later, then the last two plates arrived about 10 minutes later. It really sucked, especially since we didn't start eating until everyone got their food. By then, some of our plates lost their heat. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and couldn't believe what they served me. The (small) piece of salmon looked and tasted old, and was definitely not crusted with almonds. Instead, they squirted a mayo sauce on top and sprinkled almond bits on top (which I couldn't eat, and scraped it off). The bottom of the salmon and edges were super dry too and did not look fit for eating. I don't understand why people like this place so much. It's overpriced, slow and poor quality. I can't say anything about their cheesecake though since I opted not to try and because I couldn't stomach any more of their food."
Rohini E.,"Rapid City, SD",2,32,22,5.0,4/1/2017,"It's like any other cheesecake factory in the world. Super cheesy and cakey. Went down there to celebrate my friends new job offer.  Our server was amazing and he took care of us like the babies we are in real life. Without him, we'd feel super poopy about ourselves. I totally forgot your name but please let your folks know that at I admire you guys. We got a stake dish and the avacado rolls. Please get the avacado rolls with that extra sauce it comes with. It's suuuuuper good.  And we didn't get cake. Really wanted too. May be next time."
Robert S.,"Palm Desert, CA",2,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair has been disappointing on our last few visits eating there. I can only say is I'm not going back. So many better restaurants to choose from.
Krystle D.,"San Jose, CA",66,46,76,4.0,9/28/2017,It's my 4th time eating here at same location and my visit is always pleasant. My favorite is the grilled salmon with spinach. Customer service has always been superb!
Amanda C.,"Dana Point, CA",3,6,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Customer service at this location is atrocious. I've never seen a crowd handed so poorly or been spoken to by staff with such disrespect. I came to take advantage of the deal for Cheesecake Day. But I am never returning here, for any reason. I'll learn how to make my own cheesecake- I know I'll get better service at home.  I also let corporate know. Hopefully they will shut this location down and start from scratch somewhere new. Step 1: train your staff on customer service."
Kelsey B.,"Union City, CA",30,10,1,3.0,12/5/2017,"I went here for my birthday dinner this last weekend and although the food was amazing, the serving staff seemed really unorganized."
Akemi R.,"San Leandro, CA",0,9,19,1.0,11/7/2017,Waited an hour and twenty minutes for my order. Went to ask the host what was taking so long and it was sitting on the counter the whole time.
Shalaka J.,"San Jose, CA",43,50,13,4.0,8/8/2017,"Excellent service. Ordered the stuffed mushrooms, tempura fried shrimp and orange chicken. Excellent, is the word!! Hardly had to wait for a minute to be seated. The breads served were so good, especially the rye bread with butter tasted ultimate."
Camey L.,"Burlingame, CA",12,9,4,4.0,10/8/2017,"This is probably my favorite restaurant at the area, each one of the brunches serving good food and amazing service. Definitely recommend on the key lime pie for desert, so delicious"
Preeti J.,"San Jose, CA",18,41,155,4.0,9/17/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place of fine elegance & dining. Ambience is good & even with adequate seating arrangements the wait timings are long especially on weekends. Service & hygiene could be improved a bit for bettering the place. Pricey for certain but yet again the portion size of food served is great. Food- Being vegetarians shouldn't deter one to not visit this eatery,the options are good.  We ordered a fresh basil, tomato & cheese flatbread from the Skinnylicious - Small plates & Appetizers section. It was spot-on! The bread baked to perfection- soft n fresh & the harmony of basil -tomato with the melted cheese was simply great! Next was a Veggie Burger from the Glamburger & Sandwitches section. A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Onion. Served on a Toasted Wheat Brioche Bun with Melted Fontina Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles and Mayo this was one whole some meal! Though the brown rice patty was dry n didn't much stick as one the flavors were good. Bread was soft n toasted well. We shared a burger n still felt very full. One cannot leave the place without tasting  its signature cheesecakes. My order was for a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake. It was divine!!!!  An absolute sweet tooth lovers haven. Sweet to the palate, but contagious to not put back your spoon to dig in for another bite. The hazelnut flavor was very well dominant n so the crunch. Creamy n soft was the Cheesecake.To reduce the overpowering sweetness the whipped cream acted as a great accompaniment. By the end of all every bite was sinfully amazing.  With ample choices for every course of food the Cheesecake Factory is a great place for classic dining."
Isabelle V.,"Daly City, CA",84,16,1,1.0,12/14/2017,"You guys need to get it together. A line of 6 people waiting while 8 Employees are standing around behind the counter talking and watching the transaction taking place on one of the two registers. I get it, retail is busy! The manager was assisting a transaction with gift cards that was about a $600 purchase with multiple gift cards being loaded! Understandable. But The girl on the second register was talking with employees and didn't acknowledge the line of people waiting behind the first register until the manager directed people to the other line. Didn't seem like the second register was open since the girl was too busy talking with other employees. Multiple employees made eye contact with me and made no effort to assist me even though they were all doing NOTHING. Finally a man asked me if I needed help. Then the lady who I assume was the manager on duty gives me attitude because I mentioned it. All of a sudden once the manager says that the girl on the other register was open I was so irritated. Do your job and talk on your break!!! To the manager, instead of giving attitude maybe you should check your employees and have them working instead of standing around chatting during the dinner rush. Thank you to the man who helped me!"
Aditya T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",27,6,,1.0,10/29/2017,"I just picked up an icy cold pasta from this place. It was icy cold because it was just sitting there for over half n hour while i was waiting in front of the desk. When I finally went to ask about my order she pretended to go back to the kitchen to check my order and came back empty handed , picked up the pasta from the shelf and gave it to me. The worst part is she knew the whole time that the pasta is ready but just didn't bother to give it to me. Disgusting behavior from the staff."

Sweet to the palate, but contagious to not put back your spoon to dig in for another bite. The hazelnut flavor was very well dominant n so the crunch. Creamy n soft was the Cheesecake.To reduce the overpowering sweetness the whipped cream acted as a great accompaniment. By the end of all every bite was sinfully amazing.  With ample choices for every course of food the Cheesecake Factory is a great place for classic dining."

A line of 6 people waiting while 8 Employees are standing around behind the counter talking and watching the transaction taking place on one of the two registers. I get it, retail is busy! The manager was assisting a transaction with gift cards that was about a $600 purchase with multiple gift cards being loaded! Understandable. But The girl on the second register was talking with employees and didn't acknowledge the line of people waiting behind the first register until the manager directed people to the other line. Didn't seem like the second register was open since the girl was too busy talking with other employees. Multiple employees made eye contact with me and made no effort to assist me even though they were all doing NOTHING. Finally a man asked me if I needed help. Then the lady who I assume was the manager on duty gives me attitude because I mentioned it. All of a sudden once the manager says that the girl on the other register was open I was so irritated. Do your job and talk on your break!!! To the manager, instead of giving attitude maybe you should check your employees and have them working instead of standing around chatting during the dinner rush. Thank you to the man who helped me!"

It was icy cold because it was just sitting there for over half n hour while i was waiting in front of the desk. When I finally went to ask about my order she pretended to go back to the kitchen to check my order and came back empty handed , picked up the pasta from the shelf and gave it to me. The worst part is she knew the whole time that the pasta is ready but just didn't bother to give it to me. Disgusting behavior from the staff."
