Michelle L.,"San Francisco, CA",972,726,101,3.0,8/6/2010,"My friends and I originally wanted to go to El Jardin to catch up, but upon discovering that it closes at 9 (wtf!?) we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory across the street instead. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times before and I always have the same issue of deciding what to get on their very large menu. This time was no different. However, after a very long time with the menu I decided on a burger (the one with goat cheese) and a glass of sangria (white! my roommate got the red.) My friends ordered the chicken madeira and the miso salmon. The food arrived relatively quickly, and the waiter was really nice and everything, but I just wasn't too impressed with my burger. It was really small, to begin with, and it didn't taste as good as I had hoped. Maybe it was because there weren't very many goodies in my burger, as there were only a couple of mushrooms. ): However, the side salad was big, which was good since it made me feel a little better about eating the unhealthy burger. If I were to come back I'd probably not order a burger, and order one of the other million things on the menu. Regardless this is a nice restaurant to go for a dinner with family, or out with friends to catch up (like we did!) Plus, they close at 11 so we were able to take our time while eating."
Anitha C.,"San Jose, CA",164,237,21,4.0,4/21/2013,"I'm on a no carb diet and the parents wanted to try this place. I reluctantly agreed and was mildly surprised that I had a few options. I had the warm asparagus salad and honestly is go back just for this! The others on my table ordered Avocado egg rolls ( yum but mushy), fried cheese ( hmm what's not to love), milkshake ( I heard oohs and aahs over it) and spicy garlic noodles ( again I think the person licked the bowl clean!) Service was good and price was reasonable...  Maybe a 3 star for the rest of the menu items but our experience was great!"
Michelle T.,"Cupertino, CA",118,505,301,3.0,1/28/2011,"This place has been around FOREVER and yet I never yelped it!  Silly me!  I saw this baby being ""born,"" so to speak. I think for a chain restaurant it has a great selection, large portions, and good service.  I can't say that the food was amazing, but good for a chain restaurant again. Recently, I've been ordering the Thai Lettuce Wraps I love the Thai Letttuce Wraps! Great place if you can't decide where to go for a large group. I would say a downfall is the wait time."
Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,4.0,1/11/2011,10 minute wait on a Sunday evening.  Attentive staff.  Requested Rye bread only since no one ever eats the sourdough.  Sausage and Ricotta Pizzette ($4.95) was delicious. It had little chunks of ricotta cheese on top of the mozzarella cheese. The sausages were not the round circle balls of msg which is a plus.  Salisbury Steak ($12.95) never fails me. I always bring home at least half for the next day's lunch. I think it tastes better the next day anyways.  Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic ($15.95) was A LOT. It could serve two people or eat two meals worth. The farfalle was not downed or dry in sauce. The chicken was soft and very tender.
Krystal L.,"San Jose, CA",64,126,29,2.0,3/10/2014,"So we went to Cheesecake Factory on my birthday at valley fair. First off, two of the cheese cake our of 4 were ""frozen and would take hours to thaw so you should pick another kind."" So we did. And the wait began... We waited quite a while for just two desserts to show up. One was the exact one I ordered. Then mine finally came and the last one that looks like it was melted ice cream. No ice cream at all.  Then it took a very long time to get our check. We asked a few times of the nice waiter. It finally came. Granted I believe the service was slow since Brent burns from the sharks was at the table next to us and had multiple waiters helping that table of 6 or so people. Two more than our table. Disappointment at cheesecake. Maybe next time it'll be better. Cudos to whoever the ninja was who filled my water without me seeing them at all."
Chloe F.,"San Jose, CA",36,23,40,4.0,6/13/2013,"The lunch meatloaf was good, still a big portion for a ""lunch portion."" It came with corn and mash potatoes -which was also good. Greek salad flavorful and tart, definitely will be getting that again. The red velvet cheesecake also lives up to the hype. Turtle cheesecake was yummy too."
Mike S.,"San Jose, CA",424,175,371,4.0,2/12/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory, oh the fond memories I've had at your various restaurants throughout the years. This used to be one of my favorite go to spots years ago. I'm a little amazed that you somehow haven't found your way onto one of my reviews yet. I used to appreciate you a lot more back in the days when we had to travel to San Francisco just to spend some time with you. But now that you've popped up in so many locations close by, perhaps I've taken you for granted. Last week I met up with Kim on a busy Wednesday night. You'd think on a Wednesday night there wouldn't be that many people, but then again this place always seems to be packed. Once we were seated we were served a bread basket and instantly my quest of deciding what to pick from their extensive menu with never ending choices begins. While I'm munching on my favorite, the brown oat bread I finally narrow down my choices between two dishes, the Grilled Pork Chops or the Pasta Carbonara. Btw: If you haven't tried their brown bread, you have to try it because it's so delicious. After some debate, I decided to go with the Grilled Pork Chops and Kim ordered the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane. ( ) Grilled Pork Chops (3.5 stars) ( ) Center cut chops served with house made apple sauce, mashed potatoes, and fresh spinach. The pork chops were good and perfectly cooked, but nothing breathtaking or to die for. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, as they were fresh and quite creamy like. Yum! To this day, I'm not sure if I've ever tried their cheesecake, which is amazing considering how many times I've come here. The problem is their portions are so huge, that by the time I finish my food or tap out, I'm overstuffed like a turkey in stage 3 food coma. Some of my favorite dishes here include: Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Avocado Egg Rolls, & Chicken Madeira. Summary (3.75 Stars): Great place for picky eaters or a large group of friends, as they offer an extensive menu with many different dishes to decide on. They also have a full bar with many delicious drinks to choose from. :)"
Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2110,1114,541,3.0,2/7/2010,"There is a reason why I rarely go eat at Cheesecake Factory.. Two words: THE WAIT.   I think i waited for about an hour last friday night for a table of 2.  My motivation in coming here all of a sudden was.. 2 words again: GIFT CARD.  Yes, a gift card brought me to here. a $50 gift card I may say!  A perfect amount for a typical meal for 2 at Cheesecake factory! My total check was about $63 for an appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and 1 cheesecake.   Pros: the enormous selections of foods this place has to offer.  And I may say that most of their dishes are delicious!  Another Pro, the dishes are ginormous... Definitely your money's worth!  You will find yourself going home with a to go box like 70% of the time! I swear!  I definitely like the chicken madeira and combo shrimp/salmon dishes.  Their mashed potatoes are delicious and their spinach artichoke dip is awesome also!  Watch out.. you get full off of the bread baskets! My favorite: BROWN BREAD..*drool* Ultimate Fav Drink here( to die for ): STRAWBERRY LEMONADE 2 words once again: FREE REFILLS Half of the time I don't get to eat dessert due to how full I get.  I have tried their strawberry, dulce de leche, white chocolate raspberry, and lime cheesecakes.  Last friday, I tried the red velvet.  It is quite good but I couldn't handle alot of it.. WAY sweet and diabetic attack to be happen!"
Karina A.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,2,5.0,11/8/2014,One waiter was especially kind and on too of his game. I believe his name is Daniel! Such a great waiter. Food was absolutely delicious. And I love the BIG dishes. Definitely paying for what you receive!! (:

Hailey D.,"San Jose, CA",12,51,27,1.0,4/27/2015,"It honestly pains me to give this low of a score because I usually have a good time here, but after the experience I just had I don't think that will continue. I called in a few hours before I planned coming here to make a reservation for a party of 15. Turns out they don't take reservations. We made the decision to just go there afterwork and not worry about having a reservation. We sent one girl from our party to the restaurant to put our name down for a table and they informed us that they won't seat us until at least half of our table is there. We waited 40 minutes and when our party was ready we went up to the front only to find out that they gave our table away. We were furious! There was no communication and even though the girl claimed she was the manager, she never once checked in with us to see if half our party had arrived. They put our names back on the list and told us it would be another 40 minutes. We had no other options at this point so we decided to just wait it to out only to discover that they gave away our table AGAIN. We left and headed over to California Pizza Kitchen where they went above and beyond to give us a good experience. In the future, we will avoid this location and either go to CPK or the cheesecake factory in Oakridge."

Chris W.,"Stockton, CA",13,77,3,1.0,3/13/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory offers little more than the others; I would have easily given it at least 3 stars, possibly 4 or perhaps even a 5.  The food was decent and the cheesecake was excellent.  Interior was well decorated, and the bathrooms were pretty clean.  What really detracted from a great experience was terrible service. My girlfriend and I waited for about 20 minutes after our main course without acknowledgement from our server.  Normally, I wouldn't complain, business might be out of control, maybe she's covering an extra shift.  What really set us off was the way she would pass our table (5 times total) without even checking on us and prioritize other customers that were seated after us.  The server gave the couple next to us great service, and they got in a good 7-12 minutes after we were seated!  She would check on them often and bypass our table.   This is the second worse service I have received; doubt I'll return anytime soon."
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,3.0,12/20/2012,"These guys are really annoying sometimes but I still love them overall, I can't help it, too much tasty food and overall a good atmosphere. This isn't my favorite branch though as it's very crowded and they have lots of cruddy seating where you sit 1' from other tables. Also one star down for having advertising for other business in your menus! Do I get a discount for that?! Grrr"
Sandra S.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,2,2.0,11/15/2015,The worst brunch experience of my life. The omelette was horrible it tasted like the eggs came from a carton. We got there when they first opened at 10am and we just left at 11:17. We waited so long and the food was so bad. Of course I should have known not to pick a breakfast place that only serves breakfast on Sunday's. The French toast was thick and soggy inside. We couldn't finish anything we ordered it. Never again!

Meadow S.,"Campbell, CA",416,19,2,1.0,4/26/2015,"Congratulations to the Cheesecake Factory for being my first bad yelp review!!! Let me just say wow do you guys deserve it :) I think it's fair to say that I will never be returning to this place after the experience I had. My friends and I all decided to come here for dinner tonight because we had a couple of coworkers leaving and wanted to have a farewell dinner and we all decided the Cheesecake factory was the place for us (we were obviously wrong). Because we all work in customer service ourselves we tried our best to be as helpful as possible by calling in advance to let them know we were coming, and having someone there to check us in so they can prepare for a very large group. You would think the respect would be reciprocated but it was apparent that they could care less about their customers when they gave our table away TWICE. Did they really think 16 girls sitting in a lobby for 45 min would be better then holding the table for 5 more min? We decided to give California Pizza Kitchen a call and they seated us immediately (take notes). Not only were they so accommodating but they also made us all feel very welcomed and went above and beyond for us. They gave us all the customer service that you would expect at a pretentious place like The Cheesecake Factory. I know that in the future when we plan large party dinners (which we do very often) we will be going to CPK now.  Moral of the story, this place could care less about their customers, if they did then they would've helped a large party with open arms instead of leaving us all frantic looking for a place to fit us in in such short notice (something we obviously tried to avoid) If you want to go somewhere great to eat go to CPK!!!"
Tony R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",273,69,110,4.0,4/26/2011,"Whenever I want some cheesecake, some really really good cheesecake I come to the Cheesecake Factory, or my grandmas house. But grandma doesn't make cheesecake all the time unfortunately so this place does just fine. As a person who loves cheesecake and eating my desserts first, I'll review dessert first. The selection of different cheesecakes here are amazing, and if you're like me, and cheesecake is one of your favorite ""foods"", you will probably be in heaven, there is something that will satisfy ever pallet  Recommendations (My Top 5): 1.) Oreo Cheescake (very good for oreo lovers) 2.) Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake 3.) Brownie Sundae Cheesecake 4.) Reese's Peanut Butter Cheescake 5.) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake As far as food goes, the food here is not delicious as the cheesecake, its decent however. I enjoy coming here for happy hour, select appetizers are half off with the average price per plate being $5, you definitely get your bang for your buck, and the portions are humongous. I LOVE the happy hour here. Definitely a must try is the Fried Mac N Cheese, I was a little apprehensive to try it at first, but once I did I couldn't get enough of these."
Linda K.,"San Francisco, CA",108,273,1063,3.0,11/9/2010,"Maybe it was my mood? And they hype too I suppose.. I feel like Cheesecake Factory is definitely hyped up, especially the one in SF and this one is no different. Came here because I owed a bestie from a bet - and it's his favorite restaurant AND once again I was starving - I love wheat bread! Sat down as they dimmed the lights. Errr maybe it's because it seemed too romantic for me? And it's kinda awk with a bestie, know what I mean? Anyway. Got Salsbury Steak off the special menu, and he got Kobe Burger.  Salsbury Steak topped with thick sauce and cooked onions came with mashed potatoes and peas, yum! I've been craving mashed potatoes for the longest time! But it was kinda dry though :\ Traded off and had some of his Kobe Burger. It was good, but wasn't to die for. The fries that were included were good! But didn't want too much of that. WAYY too full to even have cheesecake. Sorry bestie, Dulche de le luche next time?"
Fleur S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,4.0,4/30/2012,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory restaurant I've been to. The most outstanding rave is the exceptional customer service and I've been here three times in two weeks. The alcoholic beverages are mediocre  for the cost, so I stay with the food and dessert menu. I look forward to the cheerful staff, the good food and the friendly atmosphere here."

I know that in the future when we plan large party dinners (which we do very often) we will be going to CPK now.  Moral of the story, this place could care less about their customers, if they did then they would've helped a large party with open arms instead of leaving us all frantic looking for a place to fit us in in such short notice (something we obviously tried to avoid) If you want to go somewhere great to eat go to CPK!!!"
Tony R.,"Sunnyvale, United States",273,69,110,4.0,26/4/2011,"Whenever I want some cheesecake, some really really good cheesecake I come to the Cheesecake Factory, or my grandmas house. But grandma doesn't make cheesecake all the time unfortunately so this place does just fine. As a person who loves cheesecake and eating my desserts first, I'll review dessert first. The selection of different cheesecakes here are amazing, and if you're like me, and cheesecake is one of your favorite ""foods"", you will probably be in heaven, there is something that will satisfy ever pallet  Recommendations (My Top 5): 1.) Oreo Cheescake (very good for oreo lovers) 2.) Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake 3.) Brownie Sundae Cheesecake 4.) Reese's Peanut Butter Cheescake 5.) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake As far as food goes, the food here is not delicious as the cheesecake, its decent however. I enjoy coming here for happy hour, select appetizers are half off with the average price per plate being $5, you definitely get your bang for your buck, and the portions are humongous. I LOVE the happy hour here. Definitely a must try is the Fried Mac N Cheese, I was a little apprehensive to try it at first, but once I did I couldn't get enough of these."

I feel like Cheesecake Factory is definitely hyped up, especially the one in SF and this one is no different. Came here because I owed a bestie from a bet - and it's his favorite restaurant AND once again I was starving - I love wheat bread! Sat down as they dimmed the lights. Errr maybe it's because it seemed too romantic for me? And it's kinda awk with a bestie, know what I mean? Anyway. Got Salsbury Steak off the special menu, and he got Kobe Burger.  Salsbury Steak topped with thick sauce and cooked onions came with mashed potatoes and peas, yum! I've been craving mashed potatoes for the longest time! But it was kinda dry though :\ Traded off and had some of his Kobe Burger. It was good, but wasn't to die for. The fries that were included were good! But didn't want too much of that. WAYY too full to even have cheesecake. Sorry bestie, Dulche de le luche next time?"
Fleur S.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,9,,4.0,30/4/2012,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory restaurant I've been to. The most outstanding rave is the exceptional customer service and I've been here three times in two weeks. The alcoholic beverages are mediocre  for the cost, so I stay with the food and dessert menu. I look forward to the cheerful staff, the good food and the friendly atmosphere here."
