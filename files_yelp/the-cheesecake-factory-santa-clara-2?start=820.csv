Kim R.,"San Francisco, CA",548,284,37,4.0,2/8/2010,"Came here on a weekday with Mike.  It was surprisingly busy, people waiting to be seated.  It was a 30-minute wait and was pretty much a 30 minute wait.  As soon as we were seated, they gave us bread + butter. Their menu is extensive, espeically in pasta dishes and cheesecake of course. I had the Pomegranate Margarita - on the rocks, its tart & moderately sweet, but not enough tequila!! :( Factory Combo: Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane - I thought the shrimp scampi came with pasta, but to my surprise it didnt.. I was sad, thought I was going to have a little bit of pasta & steak.  So in the middle of my plate was a mountain of mash potato, to the left was the steak (more like 4-5 small pieces) with mushrooms tossed with some Asian soysauce dressing and to the right was 3 lightly battered jumbo shrimp sitting on some creamy white sauce with pieces of tomato.  It was decent, but I dont know if I'll order this again, considering they have so many other dishes to choose from. I really wanted to try their cheesecake, but was too full to even try.  I think the next time I come here, I won't finish up all my food, but leave room for dessert. :))"
jim h.,"San Jose, CA",12,76,1,5.0,7/10/2013,"Just have to say Thank you Kelly for the Great service last night!!! You truly are very sweet and know how to treat people right!!!

Jonathan for President of the Cheesecake Factory!!!!  :0)  You all are TRULY the BEST!!!!  What a GREAT Team!!!  Thank you again!!!   Jim & Bev"
Sara K.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,15,3,2.0,10/10/2014,"Thus place had the worst chef that day. All the food we had at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants was uncooked or bland as he'll. And when we complained, the waitress had an attitude!!!! Don't waste money here. Never going back there. If I hadn't received good service at other restaurants, I would be totally put off of this chain."
Vincy L.,"San Jose, CA",214,111,59,4.0,1/17/2013,I love the cheesecakes here. My favorite is the original with strawberry. I also love their miso baked salmon. Delicious! I hate coming here with parties of three of more because the line is crazy. I only go to the bar where there is almost always an open seat.
Erika C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",144,32,5,4.0,1/19/2014,"Me and my girls decided to eat here at the last minute and we were starving!! I ordered the chicken Madeira with spinach. When I got my dish I couldn't even see where the spinach was. The waiter was very kind and got me more spinach. On top of that the kitchen manager ""Ron"" came out and was just soooo apologetic and very respectful/polite in regards to my spinach mishap. I was soo speechless because when the kitchen manger approached our table he gave me direct eye contact and just made me blush with how suave he was!!! I definitely would like to go back just to see the kitchen manager!! Lol Thank you very much Ron!!!!"
Owie N.,"San Francisco, CA",622,1348,4663,5.0,6/4/2010,"Probably the best bang for buck restaurant out there. The portions are well worth the price you pay for them and they are just as tasty. A few favorite dishes of mine are the hibachi steak and louisiana pasta. The only problem with cheesecake factory is their isle seats which can be too cramped, so make sure you request a booth in order to enjoy your meal."
Kristen N.,"Sacramento, CA",36,30,45,2.0,8/24/2014,"Sat down 15 minutes ago and still haven't ordered... I'd get up and leave, if I wasn't so hungry! A bit irritated with Cheesecake Factory"
Sue Ellen E.,"Santa Clara, CA",364,515,355,5.0,12/24/2011,"Like last year, my birthday (yesterday) dinner was celebrated here! Fabulous! They even sang to me and brought me a special birthday ice cream sundae with my name spelled out in chocolate syrup! Our party of six got the royal treatment, with prompt service, friendly faces, accurate orders, and delicious yummy food!  I ordered the samosas and a house salad. My brother, his son, and friend got pasta dishes. My mom got the salmon, and my sweetheart got fries. For dessert we shared a Hershey's chocolate chip cheesecake and chocolate fudge cake, and of course my special birthday treat! Everyone loved their food and had leftovers to take home. Who knew getting older could be so much fun? Bring it on! The booths are big enough to open presents at the table, and enough elbow room for everyone. Several waiters including our own came to sing to me, as they did for a couple others so I clearly was in good birthday company for the evening! I love that it's nice enough here to really dress up, or not if you don't feel like it. We were dressed up. A waitress even agreed to take pictures for us! Splendid! I really have to hand it to the staff here. They work amidst a lot of noise and deal with a lot of people and really hold it together. They didn't make any mistakes, despite a waitress change when one went on a break and it being a busy Friday night in the last-minute shopping crowds of the Christmas season. Very impressive. I already want to go back!"
Ricky O.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/26/2014,"I have to be honest, I was not overwhelmed with this restaurant, but I love the location.  Valley Fair really is the nicest mall in northern California, and being able to eat here after shopping with my girlfriend is nice.  Alas, it was so packed Saturday night we had to eat at the bar.  I am still not sure how the seating selection/placement works.  The drinks were ok, but nothing to write home about considering the price.  Maybe it depends on how you look and who you are/know here... Maybe/probably, it's just me.  Good food though and pretty upscale.  Worth the price if you can get a table I suppose."
Suzanna W.,"San Jose, CA",38,5,,5.0,4/5/2015,I have been going to this cheesecake factory for years now .. They have excellent customer service and the manager (Africans american) thurly knows how to take care of the customers he is excellent and a wonderful store manager. Great great food but their bistro shrimp pasta has no taste if you are someone that likes flavor in your food do not get it. Other than that everything else in the menu is good.
Erica S.,"San Jose, CA",248,1371,348,4.0,10/5/2010,"I still like this place as  I can always find something here.  I recently had one of my favorite salads from here, Luau Salad.  I like that it comes with lots of veggies: cucumbers, green onions, red and yellow bell peppers, carrots, green beans along with mango and chicken.  The vinaigrette dressing is tasty, but make sure to ask for it on the side as they tend to over dress.   Also had the Four Seasons Pizza.  If you like different toppings, you'll like this one.  The pizza with 4 sections:      1. artichoke and roasted tomatoes      2. prosciutto      3. mushrooms      4. fresh mozzarella and tomato Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Difficulty is parking, but I try to avoid the busy dinner and weekend crowds.  Come late in the night for no waits."
Katya S.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",1,7,2,4.0,11/17/2014,Was so great to celebrate birthday!! A lovely place with really nice food. If you order ice T make sure it's not sweetened cause then you'll get a terrible sugar rush. They decorate the cake plate with the birthday boy name- really surprising and sweet!
Joana C.,"San Jose, CA",3,3,1,1.0,10/18/2014,"Food is cake, but take out service sucks. Take out = chaotic service when house is full."
Angela L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",1992,355,627,4.0,3/28/2010,Wow.  I can't believe I have passed by this place numerous amount of time while shopping at the Valleyfair mall and never curious as to give it a try.  Curious no more.... I have heard so many good thing about this place but never been motivated to give it a try.  I never liked cheesecake so the name of the place just seemed not to impress me one bit.  Boy was I missing out. I can't believe what I have been missing out on.  Never liked or care for cheesecake until I came to this place.  It is a fun place to dine and have wonderful and delicious cheesecakes.  They have a lot of varieties of cheesecakes.  The one that is my favorite thus far is the red velvet cheesecake.  It is to die for.   Talking about it is making my mouth watery and just want to run out and get some.  Anybody want to join me? Their entrees are pretty good as well.  I only had a few dishes so far but from the look of things--I will be back..........
Jose G.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/11/2014,Food tastes good and dining service is good not excellent but good.  My bad experience was ordering curbside.  First of all you cannot order on line they make you call to place your order.  When I arrived and called to let them know I was waiting for my order the phone rang at least 20 times before it was picked up then was transferred to bakery.  Bakery never picked up the phone so after 12 minutes of waiting on hold after an additional 5 minutes of trying to get through i decided to go inside to get my order.   They need to take lessons from other establishments such as BJ's and Outback on how curbside ordering should be performed.  Busy workers like myself do not always have time to wait an hour to be seated to eat in the restaurant.
Enza P.,"Milpitas, CA",602,575,344,4.0,10/21/2010,"I really like Cheesecake factory because it's classy while decently affordable. The decor is lovely and I've always been satisfied with the customer service. The wheat bread is here is so delicious also! I call it chocolate bread because the bread is a really dark brown. Their wheat bread is always moist, warm, and amazing! My hubby and I always start with calamari and it never disappoints. I usually get the garlic noodles with chicken. It's full of butter and a decent amount of garlic. The chicken on it is always tender too! My hubby enjoys the burgers here because they're BIG!  I've never had the cheesecake here but my friends who have really enjoy it. My mama always spoils my brother with a slice when we go together.  I like that Cheesecake factory has a large food menu and a decent cocktail menu. It's nice to have a variety. I end up always getting the same thing though! It's so hard to choose. Whenever my hubby and I wanna treat ourselves for a hard week's work, we'll go here. The one bad thing about Cheesecake factory is the long wait. We usually go for a late lunch or early dinner to avoid the rush. I don't think it's worth waiting an hour in line for 2 people to eat. I went here for a birthday party for several occasions and remember waiting 2 hours."
Liz C.,"Milpitas, CA",114,226,2401,5.0,2/25/2014,"I've only been twice, but both times have been delightful. The waiters are always great. The food comes fast and hot. Good variety of food on the menu including amazing desert obviously and healthy choices too. It's a bit more expensive, but worth it for special occasions. Nice décor, very classy."
Disha D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,11,1,4.0,5/27/2013,"One of my favorite places where they have a lot of options for the main course and dessert! I have been here countless times and have never been disappointed. The service is always great and quick most of the time. The only thing I wish they did was take reservations or call aheads because they have long wait lines on the weekends. I found it to come here 9pm or after on weekends to avoid all waiting.  I usually get their tropical smoothie which is perfect if you are craving something fruity and flavorful, Louisiana chicken pasta and tiramisu. I have tried a lot of their cheesecakes and so far my favorite flavors are the herseys chocolate, tiramisu, dulce de leche and the godiva (for the chocolate lovers!)  Its a great place to come here for dinner date or for group dinners especially because of their ambience and variety of food. There is always something for everyone. HIghly recommend!"
Carolen M.,"Milpitas, CA",2237,1236,10042,2.0,12/30/2007,"I remember while in college trying to get to talk to a manager for a software engineering project and they never got back to me.  For being a non-franchised restaurant, I would think they would be a little bit more friendly.  Anyways, my family and I went here for some appetizers and cheesecake because the appetizer's big enough for an entree and we were there primarily for the cheesecake.  The wait for tables can be as long as 2 hours.  We were lucky enough to get there early so our wait was 15-30 minutes...which ended up being 30 minutes.  So come here for an early dinner otherwise you'll have to wait staring at the cheesecakes in the display... I noticed that the cheesecake in the display outside had more options than what they had in the menu.  I tried ordering the Lemoncello cheesecake and our server kept wanting to give me the torte.  I ended up just getting a the white chocolate peanut butter cheesecake which was extremely rich.  I was also afraid of walking around the restaurant in fear of falling due to the ultra greasy floors.  The restrooms were completely atrocious.  There were two unwrapped toilet papers on the floor due to the fact that the rolls in the holders were empty.  I would have thought such a nice establishment would at least keep its restrooms clean. The Firecracker Salmon Rolls wasn't that spicy, but the sauce and cabbage was great garnish to eat.  The avocado roll was so full of avocados...I'm not a big avocado fan so if you like avocados go for this appetizer.  The dipping sauce was sweet and went perfectly with the roll. Overall, I only go here when my family goes since I would never go here on my own.  I really don't like cheesecake and would rather splurge on ice cream.  I also realized I do not like peanut butter in my desserts.  Just too salty and really puts an imbalance in my mouth.  Good to bring relatives I guess so that they can experience the glory that is cheesecake.  I'd rather drive to SF though or perhaps I should try the Stoneridge Mall's Cheesecake Factory.  It might be better than here."
