Leslie H.,"Cupertino, CA",407,923,214,3.0,4/22/2012,"What should I expect? Well, an hour long wait for one thing. Actually, that's not too bad considering it was a Saturday evening, and we showed up around 6:15. I took a seat and settled in for some prime people watching. It seems like Cheesecake Factory appeals to all sorts of demographics. We saw ""Girls Night Out"" crews, families, prom goers, teenagers on group dates, pretty much everything. When you check in, the hostess gives you a pager and a time estimate, but don't stray too far because the pager only has a 30 foot range. I was told 45-50 minutes for the wait and given a pager with a detached capacitor. I wasn't fully convinced that it would buzz, so I just waited for my name to be called.  The Cheesecake Factory has a smart business model. Make people wait so they get hungry and then give them a massive menu with a huge number of choices. I'm not sure why a typical pasta dish costs upwards of $15, but their portion sizes sure are huge. I've really enjoyed their chicken Madeira and chicken Marsala as well as their various pasta dishes in the past, but I just can't bring myself to shell out so much anymore, so I usually go with their crispy chicken sandwich. It's a chicken breast that's battered and fried, then topped with a slice of cheese, a slice of cheese, one measly slice of tomato, and a bunch of shredded lettuce. You'd think a place like The Cheesecake Factory that would charge $12 for a sandwich could at least use whole pieces of lettuce, but no. It doesn't even come with onion or a pickle! But it's still one of the cheaper items on the menu. It also comes with fries. I used to really enjoy their shoestring fries, but they seemed to have switched to thicker cut ones. One thing I will give them is that their chipotle mayo and their ranch dressing are darn tasty. I did greatly enjoy our white chocolate blueberry cheesecake yesterday, but I did also balk at the $6.95 price tag. Oh well, you kind of get what you expect and are willing to pay for when you come to The Cheesecake Factory. Typically, I would say I won't be back, but this being the popular dining spot that it is, it's likely that I will return. Oh well."
Grace T.,"Campbell, CA",280,109,66,4.0,1/11/2011,"Great service, generous portions, with a great ambiance (makes a recipe for a GREAT time)!  My favorite small snacks and plates include the pear and blue cheese pizzette, fried zucchini, crispy fried cheese, and the vietnamese tacos (MUST TRY THIS)! My favorite appetizers include the avocado eggrolls, spicy ahi tempura rolls, and guacamole-made-to-order.  My favorite dishes include the miso salmon, lousiana chicken pasta, hibachi steak, and chicken costolleta. My absolute favorite dessert here is the adams peanut butter cup cheesecake. But the fresh strawberry is a classic I also like to enjoy. The chocolate tuxedo cream is also delicious!"
Raymond M.,"San Jose, CA",38,87,31,5.0,8/1/2014,"5 stars for their service, food, and the vibe of this restaurant. Got the chicken marsala, steak diane, and mashed potatoes. There's so many choices that I couldn't decide which to order so I went with a three in one. All I can say is, its good. Also got a whole red velvet cake. Shout out to my female bestfriend for the surprise! Not really a fan of the cake but its definitely better than most."
Jessica H.,"San Ramon, CA",55,234,273,3.0,11/27/2010,"So...$13 for my Pasta Da Vinci. The pasta itself was too hard, I thought I was eating rubber. The sauce was okay, it tasted pretty good at first but it turned really nasty. I felt like throw up after like eating half of it."
Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/3/2015,"We went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate a birthday, and we had a good size party. It seemed to be slow night, it took an hour to get our food. When we did finally get our food, half of it was cold, he had to ask for refills on our drinks. My kids ended up not even eating because of the wait, they were full on bread. When we got my daughters order of chicken sliders, it should have been with fruit not fries, it took them 15 minutes to bring her some fruit that looked like it was cut up for a baby(pieces the size of the end of your pinky). Since it took so long to get our food I thought it was a good idea when our food came out to place my To Go order for my spouse at home, so the order would be out in time. We waited another hour for my to go order. When I asked about the 4 times, he said "" He was waiting for the order"", then "" He was looking for the order"", then "" They didn't bring it out"" and last "" Oh it was sitting up there waiting for you to tell me you are ready"". I proceeded to check my food, the chicken and mashed potatoes where cold. I told the server this and he said "" I can have it warmed up for you"", I told him I could do that at home.  When I asked for a manager it took her 15 minutes to get back to me. My family was waiting outside since she said she would be right back.  Needless to say the birthday dinner for horrible from the bad service to the cold food and all around horrible customer service.  I will never go there again!!!!!!!!"
Lee K.,"San Jose, CA",0,35,3,4.0,10/6/2015,Cheesecake factory is consistent in their food throughout the chain.  I have been pleased with the quality of food and service that has been provided by this location. They are very busy so my recommendation is that you expect a wait of 20-30 minutes.  The food has always been good so recommend it to anyone that wants good food at a good value.
Miss P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,143,2,4.0,11/15/2012,"I usually come here during the off hours with the family.  The service is better and it's not loud.  There does seem to be a large turnover with the wait staff.  We don't go often, but when we do go, we always seem to get a newbie.  Our waiter, Jeff, was really polite and I can tell that he was nervous.  He did forget a few of our items, but he made up for it in providing great service.   The food here is tasty, but this is definitely not a place that vegetarians can go to often.  There are maybe three main meals that are vegetarian.  So, I usually end up with mostly sides.  And, of course, ending it with cheesecake and cappuccino.  Yummmmmmmmm.... A good place to go every once in a while when you feel a need for a splurge and just to get out and enjoy some family time with good food."
Michael G.,"Santa Clara, CA",144,73,28,2.0,3/13/2014,"It's always hard to review chains... but I'm going to do it anyway. Came here yesterday with my family of 5 as a pre surprise for my 40th birthday.  After a long day of work and  a beautiful day in the sun and school for my children. My wife dicided to surprise me and my 3 daughters for a night to unwind and dinner free household. there wasn't a wait we were so lucky we were led to a table. What was weird was as we were walking pass 3 available table that I  thought could hold 5 ppl we were led to the back near the restroom? As we came close my wife was maybe a mind reader she also was thinking what i was thinking and decided to voice her opinion so we were re-directed back to the front. Right here I already had a strike on the service and basically played along with the night. Little that they know I'm a critic and a very voiceful  individual when service are not perform to the satisfaction.    When we were seated, I found our waitress wasn't  friendly at all from the beginning. No smile, no welcoming and compassionate vibe was coming out of her personality. As I glanced across the section where we were sitting i seen a friendlier waiter doing his job with another guest properly. so I said oh my!  So to make a long story short we got our food. We didn't get any comments how was our food nor are water glass and refreshment wasn't being service when they were empty. Oh get this I hated to seeing waiters and waitress watching me eat as they stand right across of me waiting for guest or they just didn't have anything to do. So honestly this visit was a total waste of time and effort and I really don't understand why big chain restaurants are beginning to fail in there customer satisfaction report card? Don't they know we as the customer is the bread and butter of the restaurants flourish to shine? I'm sorry but I have experienced other places that give better service."
Ha V.,"Chicago, IL",170,199,175,4.0,11/3/2009,"My girlfriends and I had some time to kill so we decided to eat and get drunk, of course. We had stopped by on a Sunday night, and we easily grabbed a table by the bar. Our waitress came by to take our order as soon as we sat down. Thank G!d for the few good waitresses out there. Our's was amazing. She was patient while I searched through my messy bag for my I.D., and she always always always remembered our orders even when we kept getting excited and forgetting. I wish I had stopped chattering and remembered her name! I will be sure to get it when I return! We had decided to order a couple of tiny appetizers. We wanted to fill up a little bit since none of us ate lunch, but we didn't want to have to unbutton as soon as we were in the car and no one was looking. As you can imagine, we were delighted to see that there was a 'small plates and snacks' menu. :) To eat, we ordered: - Greek Salad (standard) - Tex Mex Eggrolls (not really my thing, but always a hit with friends) - Shrimp Scampi Crostini (sooo yummy, but sooo small) To drink, we ordered: - Lemon Drop Martini (idk how, but it got my friend super tipsy...FAST) - Typhoon Punch ( tasty and does its job well) - Factory Peach Bellini (fun and tasty, but not hard) We followed with:  - White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake (i died) I ordered to-go: - Red Velvet Cheesecake (my hot little love interest completely devoured it before I could even get to it) Great food, great drinks, great service... I'm happy. :)"
Jackie S.,"Milpitas, CA",416,1463,2091,2.0,8/19/2010,"My department decided to have Cheesecake Factory cater a lunch event. I decided to pick up the food with another co-worker since CF does not have delivery and the food is cheaper. They go through a third party vendor,  , to deliver the food.   is a rip off as each dish is a couple dollars more, and there is a 15% drivers fee (excluding the delivery fee). Since our food was over $1400, the driver's fee could have been easily $200. Anyway, I called the restaurant on Friday morning for pick up on Monday at 11:30am. The event started at 12:15pm, so there was plenty of time. When we arrived at 11:30am, the food was not ready. We waited 30 minutes for the food to be brought out. Yeah ... at 12pm!!! The restaurant should have done that at 11am and not at 11:30am when it was the pick up time. The lady who had the receipt made sure that all the food was brought out and she didn't even apologize for bringing out the food. By the time we got back to the office, it was well past 12:15pm, and we had to set up the food. How unprofessional. I would NOT recommend having you pick up your catering food at Cheesecake Factory. It is not worth the hassle. At the end of the day, I guess   was worth the additional money and lack of stress. Otherwise, the food is consistent at Cheesecake Factory."
Judy N.,"Sunnyvale, CA",531,775,142,3.0,11/3/2012,Came here with a girlfriend and her two daughters for a snack after we went bridesmaid dress shopping.  Red velvet cheesecake  and strawberry cheesecake.  both good. but fresh strawberries is always my fave!
Hazel D.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,3,,3.0,9/26/2015,"The food was good as always but what's with bringing out 1-2 dishes and then having to wait another 3-4 min for the next couple of dishes to come out? We were a party of 8 so that made for our food cold by the time we all started to eat.  Also, nothing can make a visit to a restaurant worse then not having toilet paper! The large stall was ""out of order"" and was the only stall that had toilet paper so every person that entered had to go in the large stall to get tp and then wait for a diff stall to become available."
Ignacio O.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,25,29,4.0,2/28/2013,"I was suppose to take the before pic of my burger but as soon as I took the fist bite I soon noticed it was almost gone. The meat is very delicious and it was cooked the way I asked for it "" medium rare "" awesome job Cheese cake Factory! The fries sucked but I did not come here for fries. It was my first time here and it was a pleasant carnivorous time. Don't be shy, come give it a try. Oh! And the fried Mac n cheese? Well, its fried maverick n cheese balls. All I'm about asking is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Because I want more!"
P S.,"San Francisco, CA",8,188,16,2.0,10/26/2012,"Surprisingly mediocre cheesecake.  This is the second or third time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory, and I've decided I won't go again if I have a choice. It's overpriced and just not that great."
Melissa S.,"Cupertino, CA",112,316,53,4.0,3/29/2012,"I'd come here every time I'm craving for something junky, but not as junky as McDonalds. I think I've been always ordering the same thing over and over again - Pasta Da Vinci and cheesecake for dessert. Why? Because that's the best pasta that they serve - penne with mushrooms and chicken in buttery sauce, the best.  I think you cannot go wrong with any of their cheesecakes, although my personal favorites are the Red Velvet, Godiva Chocolate and Strawberry cheesecakes. The others are either just too sweet or too complicated for my tongue to comprehend. They've just added the ""skinny menu"" recently and I think that really takes away the point of going to the Cheesecake Factory. The dishes don't look or sound very attractive. I mean come on, who goes to The Cheesecake Factory to eat salads? or whatever cheesecake made with Splenda."
Taylor J.,"Santa Clara, CA",393,32,1,4.0,1/28/2014,Always an awesome place to go. My parents and I went last night with some friends and the service was great and it wasn't too loud. The jambalaya dish I had was huge and super yum- tho it could have been spicier. Of course the cheesecake is always good and a must have when you go! So go!
Hilary L.,"San Jose, CA",148,19,,4.0,6/5/2012,"I came here tonight because I was at the mall and really didn't want to cook when I got home.  I ordered the crab dip and Spicy Cashew Chicken, which is definitely one of my favorites.   This review is for the really awesome bartender who made me a raspberry lemon drop, even though it isn't on the menu, while I was waiting for my takeout.  He had a genuine smile and was very attentive the entire time, even with a busy bar.  I wish I had his name, but my receipt said ""Nancy"" and I'm pretty sure that wasn't his name.  LOL"
Jasmine P.,"San Francisco, CA",287,247,4,2.0,11/13/2011,"I am soooo not a fan of any cheesecake Factory, so my review is going to be a tad negatively bias, to say the least. Why is the menu like 40 pages? I always get a headache coming into this place. My brain is working super hard to read the menu, and I'm hungry, and the lighting confuses me, and there's noise, and the waiter comes to check on me... and I don't know what I want... and I look the trough the textbook sized menu and can't ever find something ""simple"".  Everything on the menu is trying to be fancy.  It's like a little girl dressed up with make up on.  Gerrr... No matter how much you dress up your still what you are.  Your a basic burger, so why all the fluff!!! Guess... that's the point.  This spot is just too much fluff for me."
Heidi M.,"CA, CA",275,295,791,5.0,9/13/2010,"Came here saturday afternoon after the Macys sales 9-1pm. It got really crowded around 1:30 because people were done shopping.  +1 they sat us right away +1 big menu and lots to choose from +1 our server was great.  +1 I ordered the Herb crusted salmon and sub the mashed potatoes for green beans which was DELISH!  +1 my boyfriend got the fettucine with sundried tomatoes which is great too Must have: Banana cream cheesecake. I bought a small cake. One slice is $7. A whole cake is $24, i think. Just keep the box in the freezer and take it out 30 minutes before eating.   I've eaten at alot of cheesecake factories and always have a good exterience. I knwo that friday and saturday are always packed."
Janis A.,"San Jose, CA",166,308,215,4.0,3/21/2012,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory?! :D Something cool that I never knew before... my fiance bought gifts cards for Christmas gifts at the restaurant because we happened to be in the area. He got a coupon to get a free slice of cheesecake for every $25 he spent! Pretty good deal :) Not sure if they only do this during the holidays or every time someone spends at least $25 on a gift card there. Check it out though. Oh, and I recently tried the newest item on their Sunday Brunch menu: Green Chilaquiles With Carnitas And Eggs and I LOVED it!!! My favorite dish to have for dinner is the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. My favorite cheesecake is the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. Yum yum yum!"

Because that's the best pasta that they serve - penne with mushrooms and chicken in buttery sauce, the best.  I think you cannot go wrong with any of their cheesecakes, although my personal favorites are the Red Velvet, Godiva Chocolate and Strawberry cheesecakes. The others are either just too sweet or too complicated for my tongue to comprehend. They've just added the ""skinny menu"" recently and I think that really takes away the point of going to the Cheesecake Factory. The dishes don't look or sound very attractive. I mean come on, who goes to The Cheesecake Factory to eat salads? or whatever cheesecake made with Splenda."
Taylor J.,"Santa Clara, United States",393,32,1,4.0,28/1/2014,Always an awesome place to go. My parents and I went last night with some friends and the service was great and it wasn't too loud. The jambalaya dish I had was huge and super yum- tho it could have been spicier. Of course the cheesecake is always good and a must have when you go! So go!
Hilary L.,"San Jose, United States",148,19,,4.0,5/6/2012,"I came here tonight because I was at the mall and really didn't want to cook when I got home.  I ordered the crab dip and Spicy Cashew Chicken, which is definitely one of my favorites.   This review is for the really awesome bartender who made me a raspberry lemon drop, even though it isn't on the menu, while I was waiting for my takeout.  He had a genuine smile and was very attentive the entire time, even with a busy bar.  I wish I had his name, but my receipt said ""Nancy"" and I'm pretty sure that wasn't his name.  LOL"
Jasmine P.,"San Francisco, United States",287,247,4,2.0,13/11/2011,"I am soooo not a fan of any cheesecake Factory, so my review is going to be a tad negatively bias, to say the least. Why is the menu like 40 pages? I always get a headache coming into this place. My brain is working super hard to read the menu, and I'm hungry, and the lighting confuses me, and there's noise, and the waiter comes to check on me... and I don't know what I want... and I look the trough the textbook sized menu and can't ever find something ""simple"".  Everything on the menu is trying to be fancy.  It's like a little girl dressed up with make up on.  Gerrr... No matter how much you dress up your still what you are.  Your a basic burger, so why all the fluff!!! Guess... that's the point.  This spot is just too much fluff for me."

It got really crowded around 1:30 because people were done shopping.  +1 they sat us right away +1 big menu and lots to choose from +1 our server was great.  +1 I ordered the Herb crusted salmon and sub the mashed potatoes for green beans which was DELISH!  +1 my boyfriend got the fettucine with sundried tomatoes which is great too Must have: Banana cream cheesecake. I bought a small cake. One slice is $7. A whole cake is $24, i think. Just keep the box in the freezer and take it out 30 minutes before eating.   I've eaten at alot of cheesecake factories and always have a good exterience. I knwo that friday and saturday are always packed."

He got a coupon to get a free slice of cheesecake for every $25 he spent! Pretty good deal :) Not sure if they only do this during the holidays or every time someone spends at least $25 on a gift card there. Check it out though. Oh, and I recently tried the newest item on their Sunday Brunch menu: Green Chilaquiles With Carnitas And Eggs and I LOVED it!!! My favorite dish to have for dinner is the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. My favorite cheesecake is the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. Yum yum yum!"
