Rinkon P.,"Santa Clara, United States",18,21,3,5.0,14/9/2014,I just luv the place ... Crab bites are phenomenal ... Great food ...best pasta ever had in life .... Ordered chicken mediera that's comes with fried beans mashed potato n sauce ... Superb tasty
Thundar C.,"San Jose, United States",0,17,1,2.0,18/6/2012,"I'd like to give this a higher review but two things really bug me about this restaurant: 1.  Sunday Brunch - they open at 10 AM but they are never ready at 10.  It seems like it takes them 20-25 minutes to get going.  Last Sunday we were seated at 10:07, promptly ordered and it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  That's a common occurrence.  Why not have the staff arrive a little earlier so they can be ready to go when they open? 2.  They almost always burn the hashbrowns.  Last Sunday I specifically asked them not to burn the hashbrowns...guess what....they burned the hashbrowns.  For some reason the cooks think if they put the burnt side down we won't notice.  I pulled the burnt chucks out and stacked them on the side of the plate and told the waiter this is an example of how they always burn the hashbrowns.  He apologized, blamed it on the cook (duh!) and asked if we wanted another side of hashbrowns as a replacement.  We were nearly done with breakfast so we politely declined. When we were waiting for the check a manager stopped by, apologized and also offered us a replacement side of hashbrowns.  We're done eating...no we don't want another side dish. At the very least they could have offered us a coupon for a freebie piece of cheesecake. This isn't the only thing they burn.  I've gotten a chicken dish in the past where the entire bottom portion was burnt.  I've cooked at restaurants and I know when I've burned something.  It seems like these guys think they can put it black side down and cover it in sauce and no one will notice it tastes like charcoal."
Lynn V.,"San Jose, United States",283,435,249,5.0,18/10/2009,"Red Velvet Cheesecake!!! This review is for their cheesecake. I've eaten here plenty times and never bothered to write a review because it was out of the ordinary. I think it's safe to say that everyone has eaten here at one time or another and you know what to expect from it.  BUT!!! Have you tried the Red Velvet Cheesecake!!!? WOW! It's absolutely delicious! I thought I had found THE best red velvet cake @ Satura's, but to have it as a cheesecake, it's incredible. So moist and so damn good. The cheesecake paired with the red velvet was perfect. Not too sweet. Textures worked well together. Ugh...I can't begin describe how good it was, just go try it for yourself! It's a huge slice too!  I think it's only served for a limited time =( wahhhh  I hope they keep it forever! 5 stars becase 25¢ from the sale of each slice will be donated to Feeding America, the nation's food bank network. Mmmmm *drool* hubba hubba"
Charles T.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,1,3.0,11/9/2015,"very satanic, demonic, egyptian symbology through out the whole restaurant, very creepy, pricey, bad service, loud, serpents around all the lamps, all seeing eyes on every booth, disgusting place. woe to thee easton..."
Elaine N.,"San Quentin, United States",577,240,8187,4.0,3/8/2010,"Been here several times. The wait is ridiculously long sometimes, depending on the time and day. The waiters here talk to you as you walk to your table. They're always nice, warm, attentive, and friendly (: The bread is always warm, which is different from the other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The waiters are also always stopping by to offer more. And, the food gets served kinda quickly, its awesome. There was one time when my waiter didn't write down my order completely (forgot the stuffed mushrooms). When I told him about it, he said that he was very sorry and offered to get them for me for free. Since I was kind of ready to leave, I declined... He looked really, really sad ): It was alright, though. - Quick service for food - Very friendly and attentive waiters - Long waits for tables sometimes (meh, but I guess it's like that for every restaurant) - Warm breadddddddd STEPHANIE'S RED VELVET CHEESECAKE!!!"
Paula G.,"San Jose, United States",185,166,7,4.0,18/11/2011,"La Tisha Vega is the best bartender ever! She makes thee best dranks =) Good Appetizers: Salmon Eggroll looking things, Ahi tuna Tar Tar, Artichoke. Good Food: Bang Bang Chx n Shrmp, Pecan Crusted Catfish, Jambalaya, Miso Salmon, Beet Salad with Goat cheese, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, Pasta Di Vinci, Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Good drinks: Bloody Mary, Peach Bellini, Strawberry Martini, Dirty Talk (i think), Bikini Maritini, Sangria and Strawberry Lemonade (free refill!) Good Desserts: Godiva Cheesecake, Red Velvet Cheesecake, Banana Cheesecake, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  Great place for ""I don't know what I feel like eating today"""
Lianne D.,"San Francisco, United States",437,169,122,3.0,3/3/2010,"I honestly think Cheesecake Factory is more of a hype factor.. in my opinion that is. I came here last weekend for my friend's weekend. We had 17 people and they seated us in 20 or so minutes. Pretty much got seated at 4:30 so by, 4:45 everyone was ready to order.. we waited for the waiter until 4:55 and the waiter tells us that we're not longer able to order in the lunch menu... like Really? We were sitting there and waiting and you're going to wait until 5 to come take our order.. Of course being in a large party, people definitely wanted the lunch menu so, the waiter arrange it to work. The service was pretty decent. Our waiter gave all 17 individual checks so we didn't have to pay for the party service.. which is definitely a plus! I ordered the Farfelle pasta... I wouldn't recommend it. I feel that it was tasteless. There were really nothing special about the sauce. So, I wouldn't recommend it. Other than that, 3 start for the cheesecake!"
Christine Ann I.,"Milpitas, United States",405,29,35,2.0,5/11/2013,"Their ambience is great, but their food quality needs work. They don't have much vegetarian dishes. The fish and chips are not worth taking home."
Julie A.,"San Jose, United States",201,244,335,2.0,15/10/2012,"I came here with a group of friends a few days ago, after attending a very draining funeral not far.  We decided to stop here for dinner and drinks. The service was GREAT... the food was good, and the desserts were also amazing... The cocktails were also great.... BUT as we were walking out of the restaurant, one of my girlfriends said, ""Why are the floors so slippery?"" They STILL have the issue with the greasy floors in the bar area.... I wrote about this issue in my last review TWO YEARS AGO...  PLEASE CLEAN THE FLOORS! This is really, really unappetizing!"
Ede S.,"San Jose, United States",198,529,6,4.0,29/1/2012,"I'm usually not a big fan of chains, but there's something about Cheesecake factory that continues to draw me in. The rest of this review is more directed for families with young children (aka: babies).  My husband and I always talk about walking over to Santana Row after browsing Valley Fair for lunch. Out of the two times we've talked about it, we've never been able to make the trek over. Instead, we always stop by Cheesecake factory right before the wait gets too crazy.  Our son is only 7 months old, but he's a huge 7 month old boy! Without asking, the hostess brought us to our table with 2 adult menus and a kid's menu. We later told her that we didn't need a kid's menu. Right when we sat down, our server brought us over some slices of bananas with bread in the shape of a butterfly. Yikes, they were so nice! We can't tell them that he can't eat solid foods yet. So I mashed up the bananas and gave it to our son for a pre-lunch snack.  We never realized how important changing pads are in restaurants till we had a baby of our own. I dunno what's worse, a bathroom with a nasty changing pad or a bathroom with no changing pad at all! Anyway, Cheesecake Factory has a really nice bathroom with a clean changing pad area!  In short, this is a great chain restaurant to bring young ones. Plus I'm also a fan of the spicy chipotle pasta and the luau salad."
Chris C.,"Stockton, United States",0,5,,1.0,17/9/2015,"I was very disappointed with my experience at this site. The waiter was very indifferent to service. Basicly took the order delivered the food and that was it. The food was tasteless and actually kind of gross. The Teriyaki Chicken was clearly microwaved, and the rice tasted like there were chemicals dumped in the water. Sad thing was I wen there mid week at 3pm, and there was hardly anyone there. Very disappointed and will not return. Im done with high prices, bad service and bad food."
Alex B.,"San Jose, United States",203,362,294,5.0,31/1/2012,"Check out Happy Hour, 4-6pm.  Specialty drinks are $5 (Mojito, Long Island Ice Tea, Cosmo, etc.)  Lots of different food items are also $5-7.  For dinner: try the Chicken Madiera + side of broccoli.  That's enough food to share for 2 people, and it's delicious! For dessert: you can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes.  My favorite is the low-carb cheesecake (it makes me feel better... not like I should feel great after drinking Long Islands and eating a large dinner + cheesecake, but still.  It makes me feel better!!  Ok!?!?!). Enjoy!  =)"
Jackie C.,"Fremont, United States",91,160,355,2.0,31/5/2010,"Came here for a friend's 21st birthday.  We had a super large party (10+) and made reservations. But didn't get in until about an hour later =/ My friends around me ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, 4 Cheese Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, Fried Mac n Cheese, Crispy Taquitos, 2 shots of Hennessy, a sour apple martini, and a tropical martini. The Cajun pasta was the only plate that turned out good. It tasted kind of like pad thai in some sort of way. The 4 cheese pasta was super bland, no flavor and the pasta da vinci noodles were really undercooked also with no flavor. We had to pour in a lot of tobasco and pepper into the plates to try to get that stuff down our throats. Mac n Cheese texture was nasty. It felt like I was eating Mac n Cheese inside a fuzzy furball. And the taquitos were average. But I must have to say the sour apple martini was perfection. Besides that the Tropical martini was a bit on the strong side, and the hennessy shots weren't worth the money since it wasn't filled to the rim.  The service was great. But it didn't make up for the lack of quality in their food. But by golly was their bread GOOD. I ate like 3 loaf of them. no joke. for about $16 a plate, I don't think I would come back. Maybe just to try out the cakes and for a couple of drinks only."
Jordan K.,"San Jose, United States",1,16,,5.0,13/12/2014,Came here for a fun night with my friends the food was delicious the server Santos (sorry If I spelled it wrong) was great! I have never had such great service!! It's the perfect fancy/casual place to go eat!!  Love it!!!!!
Caroline B.,"Fresno, United States",506,302,4504,2.0,21/8/2011,"I really like Cheesecake Factory, but my experiences here haven't gone so well. My BF & I had waited all week to have dinner here because we love their Herb Salmon dish and the ""brown oats"" bread! The wait time was around 45 min. (which was expected from this location), service was friendly but I wish our server recommended better dishes as he said most dishes on the menu were his ""favorite"". For some reason our Herb Salmon dish tasted sour, and the herbs tasted like seaweed. It wasn't satisfying and did not taste the same like it did before. The server also recommended the Chicken Madeira for my sister's BF but it didn't look too appetizing as well. Our server was friendly and I'm sorry to say but the service was pretty slow. Lesson learned: Will NOT be taking anymore recommendations from the servers from this location at least."
Katrina T.,"Cupertino, United States",61,959,1588,4.0,25/3/2012,"3.5 stars or 4 stars? I'm in decisive, so can't decide how many stars I should really give The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to come here lots as a kid. Loved it! Loved getting their cheesecakes because they are truly one of the best with their endless decadent choices. It's been awhile since I had come here and after my visit, the feel for this place felt different.  I didn't get the feel of originality from the restaurant anymore. I felt like it was just trying to keep up with its competitors in terms of their menu. They have a ""SkinnyLicious"" menu. What I don't understand is why the prices on this menu are the same as the regular menu. The only difference is that it is less in calories, so essentially its ""healthier"". Shouldn't the prices be less if there is less food? IDK.  Anyway got the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. Pretty spicy. Fresh tuna. The salad wasn't the best thing ever at the same time wasn't the worst. I think I should have gotten the BBQ Chicken Salad or pasta.  Our waiter was really nice but super off. He took forevs to give us our bread. My gf ordered a BOWL of clam chowder, he though she said cup and apologized saying he would charge her for the cup instead. When the bill came out he ended up charging her for the BOWL. Uh weird. Then when he needed to talk to another party sitting next to us, he awkwardly had to kneel over our side of the table to reach over to the other side. This probably doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but whatever he did was AWKS.  Hopefully I can come here again and enjoy myself more! They have tons of menu options, and next time, I don't wanna be too full so I can get a Cheesecake! YUMS."
Lynda S.,"San Jose, United States",173,217,804,4.0,6/5/2012,"Who doesn't love cheesecake factory food? There are soooo many options worth exploring! :D Today's stop was for appetizers and of course cheesecake!!! Haha..our meal today was: 0: my pomegranate margarita blended- it was a good kick of tequila - tiny bit on the salty side but I still sipped it all - numbering 0 because it wasn't food - hehe :P 1: Fried calamari - hubby was craving this one today and although wr've had better, it satisfied his craving 2: Spinach and Artichoke dip with chips - it's just the right amount of cheese and goo served warm dipped with a tortilla chip is a must have for me! Loved it! 3: sweet corn tamale with toppings on the side - for me little bubba, toppings consists of salsa, sour cream and avocado chunks - he doesn't care for the sour cream and salsa but loved the avocado chunks with his sweet corn tamales! 4: small plates fried artichoke hearts - it was perfect! Delicious crunchy on the outside and healthy on the inside! Yummy goodness! 5: Classic fresh strawberry cheesecake to share - it really doesn't get better than that! Food Service was on point today, the wait was bad but not brutal for a 6:15 on a Saturday night - quote was 10-15 but we waited 25-30 mins for a table. Parking wasn't too bad either, we lucked out today!  Am sure we'll be back for more - I like their spicy jambalaya and chicken Madeira too much not to come back for it! Good serving sizes. Until next time ;)"
Elise G.,"San Jose, United States",166,890,2241,4.0,18/10/2010,"Craving sweets on a Sunday night, my boyfriend and I grabbed a slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake to go.  A bunch of other people must have had the same idea because it was busy! There was a small line huddled around the dessert counter, which was a brightly lit display fridge housing an array of delectable cheesecakes to choose from. Decisions, decisions...Some of the cakes were even cut open so you could see the tempting layers on the inside, which was how the Red Velvet lured us in.  The wait was no more than a few minutes, as two staff members took orders while a third packed up slices to go. When we got home, we broke open the box and delved into the delicious wedge of Heaven. The cake was tiered, alternating between creamy white cheesecake and spongey red velvet cake. When we reached what would have been the crust if I were describing a pie, we got a mouthful of crisp, white chocolate shavings pressed into the frosting.  We washed each bite down with hot gulps of coffee. It took some time before  the sugar high and caffiene buzz wared off, but yum! It hit the spot. Note: This review is only for the Red Velvet Cheesecake."
Arvindram R.,"Tracy, United States",105,155,1008,3.0,10/5/2014,Avocado Egg Roll was good but felt like frozen-put-on griller. Chicken Parmigana with Alfredo sauce was good and yummy.
John T.,"San Jose, United States",39,78,12,2.0,5/9/2012,"Used to love coming here, always eat in the bar because frankly I cannot be bothered with the check in process whereby everyone is forced to wait like cattle to be seated. At any rate, if you haven't noticed, the cleanliness factor has dropped to ridiculous levels lately. The floors are covered with some sort of slime that tells me it is only going to be a matter of time before a slip and fall happens. The food is ok, but seriously, the whole no reservation, wait with the unwashed masses in the entry way? I will pass."

Then when he needed to talk to another party sitting next to us, he awkwardly had to kneel over our side of the table to reach over to the other side. This probably doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but whatever he did was AWKS.  Hopefully I can come here again and enjoy myself more! They have tons of menu options, and next time, I don't wanna be too full so I can get a Cheesecake! YUMS."

There are soooo many options worth exploring! :D Today's stop was for appetizers and of course cheesecake!!! Haha..our meal today was: 0: my pomegranate margarita blended- it was a good kick of tequila - tiny bit on the salty side but I still sipped it all - numbering 0 because it wasn't food - hehe :P 1: Fried calamari - hubby was craving this one today and although wr've had better, it satisfied his craving 2: Spinach and Artichoke dip with chips - it's just the right amount of cheese and goo served warm dipped with a tortilla chip is a must have for me! Loved it! 3: sweet corn tamale with toppings on the side - for me little bubba, toppings consists of salsa, sour cream and avocado chunks - he doesn't care for the sour cream and salsa but loved the avocado chunks with his sweet corn tamales! 4: small plates fried artichoke hearts - it was perfect! Delicious crunchy on the outside and healthy on the inside! Yummy goodness! 5: Classic fresh strawberry cheesecake to share - it really doesn't get better than that! Food Service was on point today, the wait was bad but not brutal for a 6:15 on a Saturday night - quote was 10-15 but we waited 25-30 mins for a table. Parking wasn't too bad either, we lucked out today!  Am sure we'll be back for more - I like their spicy jambalaya and chicken Madeira too much not to come back for it! Good serving sizes. Until next time ;)"
Elise G.,"San Jose, CA",166,890,2241,4.0,10/18/2010,"Craving sweets on a Sunday night, my boyfriend and I grabbed a slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake to go.  A bunch of other people must have had the same idea because it was busy! There was a small line huddled around the dessert counter, which was a brightly lit display fridge housing an array of delectable cheesecakes to choose from. Decisions, decisions...Some of the cakes were even cut open so you could see the tempting layers on the inside, which was how the Red Velvet lured us in.  The wait was no more than a few minutes, as two staff members took orders while a third packed up slices to go. When we got home, we broke open the box and delved into the delicious wedge of Heaven. The cake was tiered, alternating between creamy white cheesecake and spongey red velvet cake. When we reached what would have been the crust if I were describing a pie, we got a mouthful of crisp, white chocolate shavings pressed into the frosting.  We washed each bite down with hot gulps of coffee. It took some time before  the sugar high and caffiene buzz wared off, but yum! It hit the spot. Note: This review is only for the Red Velvet Cheesecake."
Arvindram R.,"Tracy, CA",105,155,1008,3.0,5/10/2014,Avocado Egg Roll was good but felt like frozen-put-on griller. Chicken Parmigana with Alfredo sauce was good and yummy.
John T.,"San Jose, CA",39,78,12,2.0,9/5/2012,"Used to love coming here, always eat in the bar because frankly I cannot be bothered with the check in process whereby everyone is forced to wait like cattle to be seated. At any rate, if you haven't noticed, the cleanliness factor has dropped to ridiculous levels lately. The floors are covered with some sort of slime that tells me it is only going to be a matter of time before a slip and fall happens. The food is ok, but seriously, the whole no reservation, wait with the unwashed masses in the entry way? I will pass."
