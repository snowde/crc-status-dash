Jessica S.,"San Jose, United States",6,6,4,1.0,17/12/2014,"If i could give this place 0 stars I would! We came for a party of 9 (my baby sis birthday) tonight for dinner. They dont take reservations after 5pm so we had to wait. We checked in at 7:43 and they explained that there would be an hour wait . Ok , not too bad. So we waited. There were at least 4-5 other groups there that checked in very closely to us with groups of 5 people or less and one other group that had a party of 10 people. An hour goes by ok, however not only did we see all the other groups of people go in that came the same time as us, but 4 other party's of groups of 3-5 that came later than us were sat right away. and through out the entire time we checked in to for  the status and each time the lead us on by saying we were ""3rd on the list"" or ""were getting your table ready now"" which were lies. Finally after waiting for an hour and a half, we complained and the manager, Marsha came out and said it was their fault that they got our name mixed up with some other party's and that now we were going to have to wait additional time for another large table to open! Are you F-ing kidding me!!!?? She came off with an ""I don't care"" attitude I mean I understand your establishment is busy but YOUR the manager,  act like it ! And manage how you seat your partys.TIRED AND FED UP, We made the decision to leave and as were leaving we could see the manager marsha and another working chuckling and laughing, wow! Tell me that's un-professional if I've ever seen it! All in all, when you go to an establishment such as the ""cheesecake factory"" you think they would treat you with professionalism and have a great experience,  well NOT HERE !!"
Missy H.,"Saratoga, United States",11,13,1,4.0,25/11/2013,This is maybe my favorite family style restaurant. I always get great service and the menu is huge. I love looking at the cheesecakes even though most if the time I don't have room in my tummy for one after I eat. Hope I get this right but the lady Leeyani? Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. She was the last server we had last time we went and I hardly ever remember their names but she was great w my daughter and her chatty ness about the pony she brought from home. Ordered my usual chicken picatta and devoured the brown bread.
Joel G.,"Santa Clara, United States",41,516,41,4.0,23/7/2012,"The CKF is one of those places that is always at full capacity. That tells you something. The menu is vast, the place is beautiful inside and our servers were very cool indeed. We had a picky trouble maker in our party and the server handled him perfectly. She had us all laughing over his pickyness. The portions are huge, I had the jambalaya, and the cheesecake choices are vast and delicious. The prices are just right. Good bread too. Really like this place, just wished it was not so busy all the time. Oh, also be careful walking in there, the marble floors get real slippery probably from ."
Tina A.,"San Jose, United States",1,10,,4.0,20/4/2013,"One of my favorite places to dine of all time. From the gorgeous cheesecakes to the lip-smacking main course, this is a great place to dine for all occasions.  You will need a bit of patience as the wait time could be around 45 minutes just to be seated. It is worth the wait if you ask me because I simply love the food here.The serving portion is big enough for leftovers. The menu is impeccable. With a wide assortment to choose from and most of the choices excellent, my favorites include the chicken samosas, hot spinach and cheese dip and factory nachos for appetizers that are all must try items for anybody. Also love the club sandwich which is a good portion.  There is an varied list of delicious pastas and the best I've had are fettuccine Alfredo and shrimp with angel hair.  Also try their seafood options of shrimp scampi and the finest of all is the Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with rice, black beans and fried plantains along with spicy black pepper shrimp and a mango salsa. I also like the tropical smoothie to go with this and don't forget the cheesecakes for desert.  Dig into the ultimate red velvet cheesecake or tiramisu or take some home for later if you are stuffed. This place has an excellent dining service and a mellow ambiance.  Try it out and see for yourself."
Alina C.,"Fremont, United States",0,21,4,1.0,17/12/2014,"HORRIBLE! IF I COULD I WOULD NOT EVEN PUT A STAR BUT YELP MAKES ME!! The hostesses and manager Marsha were giving us unreliable comments on seating my party of 9 but we were told an hour wait so of course we started asking after our complete one hour wait and they called us shortly and just had us waiting, standing there after taking our buzzer. So of course we started complaining and the manger Marsha said a party that came barely 5 mins after us got seated accidentally instead of us! She kept coming to us saying we'll seat you right, its ready blah blah blah. So finally after waiting for almost an hour and a half we decided to let ms Marsha know we are leaving and as we leave ms Marsha had a smirk on her face. She literally ruined our night and our experience there. She barely even apologized and really didn't seem sincere about it at all. It seemed like they just wanted us to leave. DO NOT GO HERE!"
Crystal T.,"Campbell, United States",30,217,28,4.0,14/4/2014,I get the ahi tuna tataki salad here and it's wonderful every time! Kind of pricey but a nice treat! Plus it's paleo for you primal eaters out there..
Cindy M.,"San Jose, United States",38,6,,5.0,28/8/2015,"Was pleasantly surprised on a hot afternoon with the ""Lighten Up"" menu offerings.  We shared the three lettuce wrapped/grilled chicken taco's and they were perfect!  A crisp leaf of butter lettuce, grilled chicken tender, sprouts, shredded carrots, bean sprouts, pickled cucumber, toasted peanuts and cilantro - yum!  Just a light peanut sauce inside and two freshly made ""salsa's"" to dip in.  Great food and attentive service! Can't wait to go back!"
Brittany E.,"San Jose, United States",0,154,,4.0,30/7/2015,"I love this place. Good food, fast service. Only problem is they are always packed because it's right next to the mall. Make sure to make a reservation!"
Bree T.,"Santa Clara, United States",117,166,7,3.0,25/5/2012,"This is the place we go when our group can't decide what type of cuisine we want. The menu is enormous, but as a consequence, there is no one single item that really stands above the rest. The food is usually of consistent quality, even on the takeout items, but nothing is spectacular.  The design of the restaurant amplifies the sound level, so it gets deafening when it gets busy."
Angeline H.,"San Jose, United States",1208,446,359,3.0,8/5/2012,"After work a few of the co workers and I decided to head here for drinks. It was Cinco De Mayo weekend. Two of the coworkers were already seated with drinks and I couldn't find the server so I ordered drinks from the bar. I ordered a Pomegranate Mojito. It was sweet, not strong, and had a TON of mint that wasn't muddled correctly. When I forked out the mint to a plate I'd have to say there was a handful. NOT WORTH $10.50... 30 minutes in and still no sign of our server...up until I said to the table ""where's the server?! I haven't even seen who he/she is yet"" then comes a gentleman turning around and asks if everything is okay..  Another server came to our table and asked how the drinks were because the bartender said he made it pretty strong...strong? really? because I didn't taste any alcohol in it -__- I'll stick with shots and the cheesecakes."
Grace K.,"Plano, United States",1750,1109,1033,5.0,19/6/2009,"Seriously?!?! Why did this place only get 3 stars?  Sure it's a bit pricey but you get HUGE portions!!!  Every entree can feed two people, no joke. . .I LOVE THIS PLACE! Goish, there's so many things to choose from I always have the HARDEST time deciding what I want to eat here. . .there's so many good dishes but only one stomach!  Best to come here with a bunch of friends so you can eat off of each other's plates :)  A few dishes that I love: bbq ranch chicken salad, spicy chicken chipotle pasta, louisiana chicken pasta, cuban sandwich, cajun jambalaya pasta. . . If you're out with girlfriends jsut for cocktails and you want to much on something with your drink, I'd highly recommend the Factory Appetizer Favorites.  This dish includes several of their appetizers and it's a perfect amount for when you're not really hungry, but you could eat a little bit :P The only thing that sucks about this place is that they don't take reservations.  I guess I could understand because they're always busy, but it'd be nice to have an exception when you have a party of like 10 or more. .it sucks to have to arrive an hour early just so that you can put your name down. . .then you gotta sit/stand and wait. .or go to the mall and roam around for a bit (but then your pager doesn't work). . .sucks!"
Nivedita V.,"Philadelphia, United States",1,1,,5.0,16/8/2014,"This is the first time I have gone to this place and it turns out amazing. The staff is so friendly and the one for my table gave us really good recommendation for the food. Louisiana Chicken pasta is the best pasta I have ever had. It has such a good blend of sauces. One entire plate was not enough for two of us, so we ended up packing nearly one-third of the plate. The Godiva cheesecake was really good, but still heavy on the two of us. I strongly recommend this place, if you really want to have good pasta and dessert. The only qualm could be the waiting time because the place is always full, but for us, they got a booth very fast, so we were really lucky."
April P.,"San Jose, United States",92,129,51,2.0,22/7/2011,"I don't know why I always expect food served at chain restaurants to be any good.  Especially when that chain has a menu that rivals the Bible in length. Visited the Cheesecake Factory last Friday afternoon with 2 teenage girls.  Of course they were thrilled as all get out that we were going there.  I ordered the Pasta Carbonara.  If I was ordering this dish simply because I wanted a huge plate full of food, then I'd be giving this establishment five stars.  But I'm more of a quality over quantity kind of girl. I ended up with enough pasta to feed a family of four in a very greasy sauce that tasted of hickory smoke flavoring.  And that's pretty much all it tasted of.  The flavors of the chicken and green peas that were included in the dish were overpowered.  The Key Lime Cheesecake that I ordered for dessert tasted, and had the consistency of, Key Lime Pie.  If there was any cream cheese used I'd be surprised. The teenagers enjoyed their food (Mini Hot Dogs and Four Cheese Pasta) but then they also eat things like Sour Gummy Worms. Pros for this adventure?  The service was excellent as was the bread.  But spending $77.00 (before tip) for bread is a bit much."
Eirika H.,"Los Angeles, United States",332,247,26,4.0,26/8/2011,"What can I say, I'm a huge fan!  The wait gets pretty long on the weekends (friday evening -saturday evening) I love the fried cheese appetizers, and I generally get the Renee's Special (1/2 sandwich, soup of the day, and salad all for ~$11 ! ) (on a side note, I love fridays because the soup of the day is clam chowder! :d )  For desert, I'm in love with the fresh strawberry cheesecake and the tiramisu cheesecake, but I'm pretty sure all of them are just as delicious!)  Highly recommended and great for dates :)"
Tricia F.,"Sunnyvale, United States",2,5,,5.0,22/6/2014,"The food was awesome as always. But I'm giving this 5 stars for the service. Had a wonderful waitress (the bill said her name was Dominique) that did not make me feel rushed, even though it was a busy Saturday night. Such a relaxed and comfortable vibe. Honestly haven't had good service like that in a while."
Lupita G.,"Bay Area, United States",91,66,94,3.0,28/8/2011,Service was ok. Super noisey .. food was amazing.
Ace V.,"Santa Barbara, United States",6,98,1,5.0,8/3/2014,Everyone enjoyed their food. Excellent service by Patrice. Come at an off time if you don't want to wait.
Warren W.,"Burlingame, United States",412,233,85,5.0,20/7/2009,"As a former Cheesecake Factory employee and frequent patron, I just had to drop a line, especially with the insider info yo. #1 - your experience is at the utter mercy of your server 100%. It makes or breaks everything. For that reason, I'll wait 2 hours for a hella bomb server that I know and have worked with. In case you're not so patient (haha), you can grab seats at the bar. The bartenders are hella cool, chances are you'll see Sam or Jeff or this other pinay hottie whose name escapes me right now lol.  You also grab the high top tables beside the bar area. Those are totally up for grabs. A complete free-for-all so during busy nights, you can just hover around there and wait for a free table. Skip the entire line that way. ;) But yea man, like the Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to go, definitely one of the highest bang for buck places for sure. I DARE YOU NOT TO HAVE LEFT-OVERS lol. ALmost impossible.  Try: -Miso Salmon -Bang bang chicken & shrimp -Chicken Marsala -Da Vinci Pasta -Laua Salad Like your drinks?? dude: -ultimate margarita (prepare yourself) -georgia peach (great girly drink lol) -MOJITOS! (dang, love that mint. they make it hella bomb too) -Arnold Palmers, love that sugar rim on the glass.  Appetizers!!!! --- my fav part -AVOCADO EGG ROLLS (i swear by these) -SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES  I love those two appetizers TO DEATH.  If you don't like them... shoot..... I'll buy you a slice of cheesecake or something lol.  Cheesecake! Ahahaaa... (use to work in the bakery mwahaha) -GOdiva. 4 kinds of chocolate. dense as hell. more calories, sugar, carb than a big mac =D -Chocolate Tuxedo. it is THE coolest looking cheesecake. mix of dark and white chocolates, insanely cool decor on the plate, trust me -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - one of the bestsellers for a reason -REgular Cheesecake/ REg + strawberry - the classic -Turtle Pecan - my personal favorite, very rich rich, creamy =) -Vanilla Bean - a twist on the vanilla flavor with the richness that ice cream has never captured, you will be very pleasantly surprised THere's almost 50 slices and I've tried them all. They're all good.  If you got a big appetite and you're ambitious as hell.... try the dessert of the gods: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake. [you will die.] Craig's Carrot Cake is hella insane too.  AND of course,  your meal always comes with bread at the beginning.  FYI, that brown bread is not chocolate bread lol It's wheat baguette, hella bomb. =) You can ask for as much as you want! Hey, enjoy your meal =D If you're there on weekday nights/weekend nights and you want the best server in the house, ask to sit in Marcel's section. Tell him Warren sent ya. ;) He'll take care of you yo.  Just celebrated my 6 month anniversary with my girl and this guy made our dinner absolutely... indescrible. THE best dining experience I have ever ever had. He's the only man I've ever tipped 100% of the bill. He is a god among men."
Rei P.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,6,3.0,13/11/2012,"I loved Cheesecake Factory. The first time I came here I was in awe of all the food choices and just couldn't get enough of coming back. My sisters and I made this our go to restaurant. That is why I am incredibly sad to say that this is probably no longer the case. I understand that prices have to go up, and I don't mind that if the portion size stays the same. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory has raised their prices and made their portions a lot smaller than what I remember. My favorite dishes were the shepherds pie and the lemon herb roasted chicken, and I would alternate between getting these all the time. The shepherds pie used to be covered with potatoes completely so that I couldn't see the beef underneath, but it seems the potatoes on top just keep getting smaller and the price has risen $2-$3. The same goes with the lemon herb roasted chicken's price. The chicken pieces they gave used to be huge and the sauce was so flavorful, but the past few times I've ordered it, the chicken was small and the sauce too watery or none at all. I still love their cheesecakes though. Most of the time the servers are good enough, but when I went with my sister on Sunday it seemed that our waitresses(there were 2) forgot about us and another person actually noticed us just sitting there and offered to pack our food for us.  I'm really sad to say that I won't be coming here as often anymore, but it will help me save money."
Robert K.,"San Jose, United States",141,437,196,3.0,24/8/2009,"Yet another semi mediocre review for Cheesecake Factory. Unlike other businesses, this place survives not on repeat business but on the fact that they have an amazing location, great decor, are open late, are HUGE, and have a huge menu.   That being said I always find myself going here despite the fact that the food isn't really all that great.  Their 20 page menu has so much to choose from and I've had quite a few dishes there and it seems to get worse and worse.  It's just really a bad attempt at fusion and it mostly comes out Americanized, no matter what the dish, and it seems like it's all microwaved and thrown together.  Not good. The bar is nice though and yes the deserts are pretty good, too.   The new red velvet cheesecake is the best desert I've ever had, period.  It's 1550 or so calories too, FYI! I'd also like to point out that a manager told me that this particular cheesecake will be around for a while because ""it'd be a bad business decision to get rid of it since it's so popular.""  So, not because it's great, but because they're making money off it.  Haha.  And then he said ""it has too much frosting for me personally""     I LOVE that he said that, it's nice to get honesty out of someone who works in the restaurant industry.  It's very rare, trust me.. Oh and another funny note is that they offer no entertainment for kids.  We once asked for a piece of paper for our daughter to draw on and they just gave me a stub of receipt paper.  I thought that was funny and I actually like the idea of shunning children and making it not kid friendly, haha"

It makes or breaks everything. For that reason, I'll wait 2 hours for a hella bomb server that I know and have worked with. In case you're not so patient (haha), you can grab seats at the bar. The bartenders are hella cool, chances are you'll see Sam or Jeff or this other pinay hottie whose name escapes me right now lol.  You also grab the high top tables beside the bar area. Those are totally up for grabs. A complete free-for-all so during busy nights, you can just hover around there and wait for a free table. Skip the entire line that way. ;) But yea man, like the Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to go, definitely one of the highest bang for buck places for sure. I DARE YOU NOT TO HAVE LEFT-OVERS lol. ALmost impossible.  Try: -Miso Salmon -Bang bang chicken & shrimp -Chicken Marsala -Da Vinci Pasta -Laua Salad Like your drinks?? dude: -ultimate margarita (prepare yourself) -georgia peach (great girly drink lol) -MOJITOS! (dang, love that mint. they make it hella bomb too) -Arnold Palmers, love that sugar rim on the glass.  Appetizers!!!! --- my fav part -AVOCADO EGG ROLLS (i swear by these) -SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES  I love those two appetizers TO DEATH.  If you don't like them... shoot..... I'll buy you a slice of cheesecake or something lol.  Cheesecake! Ahahaaa... (use to work in the bakery mwahaha) -GOdiva. 4 kinds of chocolate. dense as hell. more calories, sugar, carb than a big mac =D -Chocolate Tuxedo. it is THE coolest looking cheesecake. mix of dark and white chocolates, insanely cool decor on the plate, trust me -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - one of the bestsellers for a reason -REgular Cheesecake/ REg + strawberry - the classic -Turtle Pecan - my personal favorite, very rich rich, creamy =) -Vanilla Bean - a twist on the vanilla flavor with the richness that ice cream has never captured, you will be very pleasantly surprised THere's almost 50 slices and I've tried them all. They're all good.  If you got a big appetite and you're ambitious as hell.... try the dessert of the gods: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake. [you will die.] Craig's Carrot Cake is hella insane too.  AND of course,  your meal always comes with bread at the beginning.  FYI, that brown bread is not chocolate bread lol It's wheat baguette, hella bomb. =) You can ask for as much as you want! Hey, enjoy your meal =D If you're there on weekday nights/weekend nights and you want the best server in the house, ask to sit in Marcel's section. Tell him Warren sent ya. ;) He'll take care of you yo.  Just celebrated my 6 month anniversary with my girl and this guy made our dinner absolutely... indescrible. THE best dining experience I have ever ever had. He's the only man I've ever tipped 100% of the bill. He is a god among men."
Rei P.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,6,3.0,11/13/2012,"I loved Cheesecake Factory. The first time I came here I was in awe of all the food choices and just couldn't get enough of coming back. My sisters and I made this our go to restaurant. That is why I am incredibly sad to say that this is probably no longer the case. I understand that prices have to go up, and I don't mind that if the portion size stays the same. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory has raised their prices and made their portions a lot smaller than what I remember. My favorite dishes were the shepherds pie and the lemon herb roasted chicken, and I would alternate between getting these all the time. The shepherds pie used to be covered with potatoes completely so that I couldn't see the beef underneath, but it seems the potatoes on top just keep getting smaller and the price has risen $2-$3. The same goes with the lemon herb roasted chicken's price. The chicken pieces they gave used to be huge and the sauce was so flavorful, but the past few times I've ordered it, the chicken was small and the sauce too watery or none at all. I still love their cheesecakes though. Most of the time the servers are good enough, but when I went with my sister on Sunday it seemed that our waitresses(there were 2) forgot about us and another person actually noticed us just sitting there and offered to pack our food for us.  I'm really sad to say that I won't be coming here as often anymore, but it will help me save money."
Robert K.,"San Jose, CA",141,437,196,3.0,8/24/2009,"Yet another semi mediocre review for Cheesecake Factory. Unlike other businesses, this place survives not on repeat business but on the fact that they have an amazing location, great decor, are open late, are HUGE, and have a huge menu.   That being said I always find myself going here despite the fact that the food isn't really all that great.  Their 20 page menu has so much to choose from and I've had quite a few dishes there and it seems to get worse and worse.  It's just really a bad attempt at fusion and it mostly comes out Americanized, no matter what the dish, and it seems like it's all microwaved and thrown together.  Not good. The bar is nice though and yes the deserts are pretty good, too.   The new red velvet cheesecake is the best desert I've ever had, period.  It's 1550 or so calories too, FYI! I'd also like to point out that a manager told me that this particular cheesecake will be around for a while because ""it'd be a bad business decision to get rid of it since it's so popular.""  So, not because it's great, but because they're making money off it.  Haha.  And then he said ""it has too much frosting for me personally""     I LOVE that he said that, it's nice to get honesty out of someone who works in the restaurant industry.  It's very rare, trust me.. Oh and another funny note is that they offer no entertainment for kids.  We once asked for a piece of paper for our daughter to draw on and they just gave me a stub of receipt paper.  I thought that was funny and I actually like the idea of shunning children and making it not kid friendly, haha"
