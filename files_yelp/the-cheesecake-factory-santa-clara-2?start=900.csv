Shachi D.,"West San Jose, San Jose, United States",10,13,1,5.0,27/7/2014,Love the place but it's always crowded. End up going for take away. Good selection of cakes to choose from  USP is fresh cakes  Every slice is with the price  My favorite is tiramisu cheese cake
Bella R.,"Soledad, United States",137,10,1,2.0,12/5/2014,I found a tiny hair in my food I've never had that problem here they should make them wear hair nets.
Apit L.,"San Jose, United States",7,343,611,3.0,11/5/2014,"I could not give more than 3 stars. The service is as expected and nothing to brag about. I would have complimented about the cheesecake but I'm lactose tolerant so I can't really say anything better. But in actuality, with limiting non-cheesecakes options gives me the reason to not give more than 3 stars. Will we come back? Yeah but only for my chocolate cravings."
Ashley T.,"Hayward, United States",47,41,84,3.0,3/1/2015,"I ordered the four cheese pasta without the ricotta cheese and chicken. When my dish came out I was really disappointed because this was the usual dish that I would always get every time I come to cheesecake. But for some reason today my dish came out cold and the cheese was not even melted. I'll give them a plus for leaving out the ricotta. I tasted the pasta and it was still cold and there was chunks of cheese everywhere in the dish. So I sent it back for them to reheat my dish. When they brought back my dish it looked like they gave me a brand new plate of pasta. They didn't take out the ricotta and it looked like they only gave me half of my portion. Weird because I only took a bite of my dish before I sent it back. There was more cheese than pasta. When I tasted it, the pasta was still cold to warm. Ehh it was whatever to much. They best part of my dinner was the whole wheat bread because it tasted fresher than my pasta. The bread was hot to the point that the butter melted instantly."
Manjit Z.,"Lincoln, United States",205,271,7,3.0,13/2/2010,"A nice 45 minute wait, I guess that's expected for this Cheesecake Factory.  I'm probably one of the few people who hasn't had a cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.  I always get the ahi tempura rolls, I know it's an appetizer but it's enough for me.  This time I got a mango margarita, which wasn't strong, but the flavor of the mango margarita itself was great, compared to other restaurants I've had a mango margarita at.   The main reason why I don't get a cheesecake is because I almost always end my meal with a honey vanilla latte, that's my sweet fix and it always comes out perfect.  Just wish the wait wasn't so long, otherwise they'd get one more star."
Xyzagal A.,"Milpitas, United States",35,125,232,3.0,5/5/2012,"Ayayay, I've avoided this place for a long time. I like to go to mom n pop style places or dives, diners and such or food trucks and stalls but this is one of my bf's favorite restaurant so I came here. What we had: Chicken madiera- This was good, I liked it but the taste didn't really surprise me it just wasn't very unique, the madiera sauce somehow tasted a little bit like hoisin. It was good nevertheless so this is definitely a must try. Pina colada- it came out too icy and lacked flavor, i like the pina colada at elephant bar better and even that pina colada i had at dave and busters dulce de leche cheesecake- it was at least not too sweet cause some of the cheesecakes here are too sweet and it was good it's just that I know the difference with the taste of home made cheesecake than massively produced cheesecakes. The best cheesecake I've had was at broken record and the white christmass cheesecake dome at cheesecake etc in the philippines OMG that was amazing. Calamari- Good and the squid was fresh but our calamari was lukewarm as if it had been fried beforehand. The best calamari I've had is still in pier 39 in embarcadero. Moving on, my bf had the chicken bowtie pasta thing I forgot what it was called, it looked good and tasted alright. Here's what I think: 1.They have this strategy of making people wait, there were a lot of empty seats and I'm not very sure if it's because they have a special ritual before they seat you but my gut tells me it's a marketing strategy to make people think they are always packed and of course to make you hungry. 2.I actually feel sorry for the utensils here, they are basically mutilated, there are scratches here and there and you can see the dried up water on the spoons and fork. I think everything accounts to appetite, how you eat in your house is also your attitude when you eat out. I take food seriously and cleanliness too nothing just makes you wanna eat more than nice clean utensils. 3. There's definitely something about the portion sizes, I would expect to have big servings like most places like these offer but the are kinda lacking in that area. Conclusion: Would I come back? Yes, not soon but yes. This place is alright."
Danling Z.,"Sunnyvale, United States",6,9,6,5.0,24/6/2015,"I've been here at lease 5 times. Every time I came here was a good time. The food is good, service is great. Their menu is big. You always can find something to eat. My kids love to eat here."
Maoz ..,"Santa Clara, United States",70,58,101,5.0,20/10/2013,Wow. So delicious.i order chicken Romano. Plus egg roll  avocado.  And for desert   Cheese cake.   I love this place.  U need to wait little bit. To many people come here.
Lyn C.,"San Francisco, United States",116,1169,22,3.0,14/9/2009,"One day, I came here and found a long, black, curly hair woven in my 4 cheese pasta!  I know it wasn't mine because my hair is short, brown, and straight.  I may be over reacting, but I have come to the conclusion that there's a difference between finding a hair that fell in my food, and finding one that has been tangled up in my meal! I usually don't get the pasta, but I'm sure that's not whats supposed to be in it.   We immediately informed the waiter and the manager personally came out to apologize, comp my meal, and gave me a house salad on the house (although I wish she gave me cheesecake!).  I was impressed with the manager coming out to take care of everything herself.   Generally, I think Cheesecake is overrated, but after this incident I have mixed feelings about specifically eating at the one in vf.  I liked the professionalism and treatment I got when we reported the hair, but in a nice place like Cheesecake, there really shouldn't be one in the first place.   On a happier note, the food tastes good.  I like getting the miso salmon and replacing the rice with mashed potatoes.  By far, the BEST dessert is the RED VELVET cheesecake!  Red velvet + cheesecake= :D  It was GENIUS to combine the two.  Absolutely scrumptious."
Verik K.,"San Jose, United States",294,136,89,4.0,16/12/2013,"I expected this place to not be so great but slap me silly with a rag and toss me into the water, it was pretty good. I had the pasta and wow, the portions were huge. I felt like I needed to go to the gym just to feel better about going there. It is a good place to go for group dinners but in order to be seated, everyone has to be there which is a drag at times because some people will say they are coming but don't and we're just stuck waiting. Next time, I'll try one of their cheesecakes."
Angela W.,"San Jose, United States",0,3,4,5.0,20/6/2015,"My sister brought me and my cousins here because she is absolutely in love with this place, and I have to agree- I really enjoyed eating here! The food portions were very big and our server, Louis, was extremely nice and very helpful. My cousin ordered the Rib Eye Steak cooked medium rare and it was my favorite out of everything we ordered. We also took two Italian Tiramisu Cheesecakes to go, and they were very pretty and tasted amazing. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in the area!"
Josephine C.,"San Jose, United States",27,141,,4.0,20/8/2012,"I'm always here just because (1) good food and service, (2) location is convenient (closer than Oakridge Mall), and (3) Cheesecake Factory seems to be one of my favorite dining place. It can be slow depending the time of day you come. Usually, I'm here in the mid-afternoon for a late lunch or for happy hour or even for dinner at times. I LOVE their J.W. Pink Lemonade and their blended alcohol drinks (ie. Strawberry Daiquiri). And of course, oreo cheesecake is my favorite from them. Second is red velvet cheesecake and banana cream cheesecake is tied. You definitely can't forget about their cheesecakes. Haha. Favorites (with mushrooms because I'm a huge mushroom fan, so I tend to order all my pastas with added mushrooms or other veggies xD): - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - Louisiana Chicken Pasta - Pasta Da Vinci - Herb Crusted Salmon served with homemade garlic mashed potato - Fried Calamari I'm going to come back here for their wonderful pastas. Pastas are one of the few things I don't get sick of and that I crave a lot for. I recommend coming here, but as a warning...it can get a bit pricy =T Worth it, though. I highly suggest going for happy hour during the weekdays. Half off certain appetizers and drinks. They provide a small (variety) menu of appetizers and drinks that are only $5 each. It's not much to pick from, but the portions are definitely huge for $5. :D"
Jonathan A.,"Kihei, United States",10,2,,1.0,28/12/2013,"Don't come here with a large group, they will tell you 2 hours and make you wait more than 3. Absolutely horrible service, at least be honest."
diana r.,"San Jose, United States",176,301,10,4.0,11/4/2012,"Coming to the Cheesecake Factory is defiantly asking for trouble.  I mean, going to the Cheesecake Factory and not having cheese cake is like going to Paris and not going to the Eiffel Tower.   This place has everything, from healthy salads to not so healthy cheeseburgers and fries and the portions are pretty generous.  I have visited this location several times and thankfully this last time I went there was no wait, however be aware that on weekends this place is packed and the wait to be seated can easily be over an hour.  Its a little loud inside so not the best place to have a nice long conversation, but a great place to enjoy some good food and cheese cake. I think the highlight of this visit was my red velvet cheesecake.... OMG... to die for.  A friend and I split one (good idea).  Very yummy, I could defiantly taste the red velvet and the cheese cake.  Great combination."
Lauren W.,"Campbell, United States",5,26,,5.0,12/7/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! I spent years going to the ones in Southern California on business trips until the chain finally expanded to Nor Cal. I am a big fan of their buffalo blasts and avocado egg rolls. When I am on a no fried food/no simple carb fast, I order the Greek Salad and roasted chicken with fresh vegetables. I have never had a bad meal here, or at any of their locations for that matter. I go mid afternoon or later in the evening to avoid the crowd and wait or just pick up take out."
Jasmine P.,"San Jose, United States",6,16,11,1.0,27/4/2015,"Terrible experience, if I could give negative stars I would. I will honestly never come to this cheesecake factory again. We had a party of about 17 and we wanted to go out for a nice dinner so we thought cheesecake factory would be great. We were so wrong. First we tried to call in advance hours earlier to let them know when we would be there and they insisted that we could not make a reservation even though we had a huge party so we said fine we will just come in. A few of us arrived earlier than others to check in our party and they told us it would be about an hour wait so we waited and then they gave away our table because 80% of our party had not arrived yet, we said fine. What really got to us was when we waited another 30 minutes and when we asked how much longer we were informed that they gave away our table again! They didn't even check in with us to see if the rest of our party had arrived and at the point we were only waiting on two people so yes 80% of our party was there. When I complained to the manager (Marsha) she said oh well you'll have to wait another 45 min! I told her that she was unprofessional and this was rediculous. We called California Pizza Kitchen and they said they would be able to seat us right away. CPK was a wonderful experience unlike cheesecake factory who obviously could care less about how they treat their customers. So, when in doubt choose CPK!"
Denise N.,"San Jose, United States",84,29,68,4.0,23/5/2010,"I am not too crazy for their food selection, maybe I should come back for another try, service is good, but wow! Their cheesecakes are to die for!  I love their white chocolate caramel Macadamia nut, red velvet and their Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake! They are not to miss,"
Evelina C.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, United States",388,400,369,3.0,15/1/2012,"Portions are gigantic & the food here is super high in calorie. (not just the cheesecake.) The wait always takes forever and to be hones I don't think the food is all that amazing. I've tried many of the pasta dishes and they really aren't that great :( I've heard the burgers are good though. The setting is really nice and the waiters are very polite & friendly. Not a go to place for me. Not worth the money, and not worth getting fat off of."
Karla Emm N.,"San Jose, United States",117,42,28,5.0,16/11/2011,"Update! I came for my birthday and the waiter was SUCH AN ANGEL!!!!! He gave me exceptional service and at the end brought my fave slice of cheescake with ""Happy Birthday Princess Karla"" after he got everyone to sing for me.. Very sweet. I'm not a big fan of being sang to for my birthday so he was sneaky enough for me to let it slide ;) Now I don't know about you but that sure does make a gal like me uber happy! I mean if the crown fits... (: Just very thoughful waiter and of course, FOOD! DaVinci-Can't go wrong :)"
Fast D.,"Ventura, United States",39,18,1,1.0,15/12/2013,OK had to wait 45 min for 2 people(yes it was a little crowed but doable) to be seated after seated had to wait 30 min for a beer. while the people who were seated after us got there food an drink. we did get our appetizer an one drink but when you bring one drink your suppose to bring the other especially if it's a beer. just pour the bottle into a glass an presto!!!  so while waiting for the beer an trying to get our waiter we noticed dude was all over bs ing. got the manager an he comped our appetizer an mojito. finally got the beer but by then we said no thanks! an went to  maggiano's at Santana row an were seated an served ASAP!! an had excellent cheaper food with superbly excellent service from Danielle the waitress!!!
