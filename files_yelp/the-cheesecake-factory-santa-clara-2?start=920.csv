Serena H.,"Milpitas, United States",1,6,4,1.0,10/6/2015,"DON'T let them ruin your day!! The food is ok, but the customer services is poor. Very rude... Terrible dinning experience... Will never go there. If you have no choice but go there, poor you. BE Sure to double check your billing. You will always find something on you billing but you never ordered it."
Leanne P.,"Milpitas, United States",346,800,158,3.0,27/8/2011,"Service sucks, food sucks, but hey, who comes here for that crap anyway? Go here for cheesecake (and maybe some booze) and that is all.  Then you'll always leave happy!"
Stanley C.,"San Jose, United States",791,655,2686,5.0,3/9/2011,"CHEESECAKE FACTORY One of the staples of American dining at various shopping malls, Cheesecake Factory offers a huge menu of delicious eats, ranging from pasta to seafood to poultry/steak, salad, and of course... cheesecake. Their cheesecake is world-renowned and comes in many flavors that is sure to satisfy anyone and everyone. Some of my favorite dishes: (1) Pecan-Crusted Catfish: with Mashed Potatoes and sweet corn (2) Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette. (3) Pasta Carbonara: Spaghettini with Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. Available with Chicken.  Cheesecake: (1) Blueberry Cheesecake - lots of blueberry flavor, although a bit too sweet (2) Mango/Key Lime Cheesecake - smooth and silky The dishes are all quite large, so you certainly won't leave the restaurant hungry. The cheesecake slices are heaven so satisfy your sweet tooth! The serving staff is ultra friendly and even sing you a Happy Birthday song if it's your special day.  Drawback: no reservations are taken at Cheesecake Factory, so it's a hit or miss depending on when you come. If it's a large party, be prepared to wait a long long long time! Come for the food, atmosphere and cheesecake!!!"
Vanessa G.,"San Jose, United States",26,69,4,4.0,20/3/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. The food is delicious and I've never had a problem with the service.  However I am knocking off a star because the weekend before last I went to pick up a 7"" cheesecake to go. When I was ordering over the phone I was told only the strawberry and original were prepared. Any other flavor I would have to bake at home. My whole point in stopping by to pick up a cake was because I didn't have time to bake....it was annoying that I only had 2 options."
Erin H.,"Santa Cruz, United States",44,211,23,4.0,10/7/2011,"For some reason I always find myself at the cheesecake factory for various friends' birthday dinners. The last one was on saturday. I arrived late (oops) but the waitress was totally cool about it and offered me water and handed me a menu immediately.  I ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce expecting overcooked pasta with icky sauce (because thats usually what happens at chain places like this) but I was pleasantly surprised. The pasta was well cooked and the sauce had the right balance of salty and sweet. 4 stars for sure. For dessert I ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake and it was delicious.  The birthday girl got a free sunday on which the waitress had written ""Happy Birthday Megan."" Nice touch! A few servers then proceeded to embarrass the hell out of her by singing Happy Birthday loudly, but I thought it was sweet.  My experience at this cheesecake factory has always been good so I would definitely recommend it."
Delya S.,"Fremont, United States",210,251,22,3.0,17/1/2012,"My bestie was craving some cheesecake. Being as we met on her birthday, she chose (and would have) some Cheesecake Factory! We met with another pal on this last Sunday and it was pretty busy. The thirty minute wait wasn't terrible. The decor is nice: it's airy, dim, and marble-y. You could bring a date here without seeming as though you were being presumptuous, while still leaving the option for romance... on the table. ;o) When we were sat, Annie was breaking our server, Dan. Service was very efficient and personable. Annie felt like somebody who should sit down and join us girls. My Manhattan was tasty and was promptly served. My BFF seemed pretty darn happy with her Lemon Drop. She and I have a perfect arrangement where we share a miso glazed salmon with brown rice, which leaves almost enough room for a nibble of cheesecake. Our other friend was craving a small bite, but this is NOT the place to find, well anything, small... really. I think the richness of everything overwhelmed her. The cheesecake is just too darn sweet! And it has WAY too much whipped cream.  Anyway, CF is more like a 3.5 star place. Decor and service is higher. I quite like the salmon and I'll be back with my friend time and again, I'm sure. I'm just not confident that it deserves four stars. Food could be executed with a bit more subtlety and artistry for a higher rating. One does know they're at a chain, when at the Cheesecake Factory."
Kelly Y.,"San Jose, United States",52,203,776,3.0,18/8/2011,"Oy, what happenedddddd Cheesecake Factory???? WHAT HAPPENED?! Don't get me wrong, their cheesecake is still as fine as day but good god their food? I have never had such greasy and oily pasta (besides Red Lobster). You know how you apply lipstick or gloss after you eat? Yeah, didn't need to after that meal. My lips were greasier than the pigs from greased pig contests.  The service received was so-so. The waitress that night wasn't particularly helpful or attentive.  I don't know if I was expecting too much- I mean, it's called Cheesecake Factory and their cheesecakes are still quite delicious (oh man, their Red Velvet? SO GOOD! I'd be willing to run 3 days on a treadmill for that) but honestly, the wait sucks, the help is so-so, and their food is mediocre at best."
Alyssa R.,"Visalia, United States",28,61,33,5.0,2/3/2014,"We came on a Sunday during lunch and the wait was only 20min for a group of 4. I always love the food here, I usually get the Louisiana chicken pasta. The waitress was nice and may our visit enjoyable. I would definitely come back if I come to valley fair"
Janelle P.,"Cupertino, United States",25,9,,5.0,12/7/2013,Fried Mac and cheese balls are bomb. Calamari is good. And I love the crispy chicken costolleta. Pretty good service too.
Zerrilyn P.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",222,294,663,4.0,3/3/2012,"Went here last Sunday with my fam after mass...we wanted to go shopping at Valley Fair, but mom and bro were feeling hungry, so we decided to eat here...first time eating here in a looonnng time...menu still looked about the same, except now they have a ""skinnylicious"" menu...omg, i lmao when i saw the title of the menu...""skinnylicious""...really...?? you can either take the title into offense or not lol...to me, it just sounds ridiculous, but i did try out an item from there anyway...wasn't craving anything that was on the original menu... -i love their complementary bread--especially the dark oat bread--eating this alone filled me up a bit -for appetizers we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with nacho chips--i'm praying the nacho chips weren't fried in lard lol...this appetizer is already a meal in itself-- -didn't have rasberry iced tea, but the waiter suggested rasberry lemonade,which was pretty good... -i had the grilled turkey burger for under 590 calories...(590 calories still sounds like a sh*tload!)hahaha...bun was toasty, turkey patty was juicy...best turkey burger i've had yet...my kind of burger--included grilled onions, mushrooms, and garlic mayo...had a side of salad with vinegarette as well...i was so full from the bread and spinach dip, i barely ate a third my acutal meal and took the rest home. I didn't even give myself a chance to order cheesecake--i know right...who the hell comes to cheesecake factory and doesn't order a cheesecake...not even to-go...(raises hand)...feeling that i've just consumed over 1000 calories of food discouraged me to get cheesecake haha... But from my previous experiences here, I must say they have a great selection of cheesecake: -red velvet cheesecake--mmm mmm good...need i say more...probably my fave out of all cheesecakes -carrot cake-also good...but too sweet -toblerone cheesecake-again good, but i'm not all that into the chocolate crust  -Pineapple upside down cheesecake--two great desserts in one! hehe -portions are large, and it is a bit on the pricey side...but there's a good enough selection of food that everyone can enjoy"

Our server was great. He was friendly and also very funny. He managed to throw up the peace sign in the background of one of the photos i took there. Definitely something to remember him by, lol. I got a pasta here and really liked how big the portion was. Some people may think it's expensive, but you really get a lot for what you're paying. it's pretty worth it. We also got two slices of cheescake--one of them was the raspberry white chocolate one, and the other was strawberry. They were both good, but i preferred the raspberry white chocolate. Super yummy. Overall, i was very satisfied when i finished my dinner and will go back again."
Eli Y.,"Santa Clara, United States",1032,374,347,3.0,25/2/2011,"Let's put this simply: the food is worthless but the cheesecake tastes like the first time you locked eyes with your third grade crush.  This place has one of the biggest menus you have ever seen. You'd think that somewhere in this ""War and Peace"" of menus you'd be able to find something excellent. But no you won't be finding anything better than decent. I've tried too many things on this menu to list here because some of my friends seem to think that the food is worth anyones taste buds. Every time I get something new because it's never that good.  It's also about $4 more for plate than it should be. Mix the meh food and the new hole in your pocket and it equals a bad time.  Furthermore they don't take reservations and often are incredibly full. The wait is usually forever.  BUT the cheesecake! Yeah it's really good! Much like with the food I've tried oh so many flavors. But this time I have to say there is the opposite result. Everything is good. The cheesecake is just so rich and the crust so perfect. It's not even worth describing. You just have to try it to understand.  Once again it's pretty pricey but I think it's worth it. After all, you shouldn't eat a slice of this very often because with great taste comes great amounts of calories. But hey you should be able to splurge from time to time.  So do yourself a favor. Indulge your childish fantasies for once and break your parents cardinal rule: skip dinner and go straight for dessert."

Do not come during dinner though. The wait is not worth it and that's when the service lacks. You have been warned. I enjoy their Louisiana chicken pasta, their fried artichoke hearts, warm crab and artichoke dip, firecracker salmon, their salmon plates, and their bread. Their strawberry lemonade is also really good. Red velvet cheesecake. Delicious, but eat sparingly. All their entrees and appetizers are very high in fat and calories.

Christopher T.,"San Jose, United States",269,190,16,4.0,23/3/2011,"Reviewing chain restaurants is kinda lame but I've never left Chizzle-Fac remotely hungry at all which isn't that much to ask for these days in America right? So they have a meal for anybody and everybody here. You can get foods shaped like a burrito, a salad, burgers, steak, blah blah blah. Basically if you're hungry for something, have 20 bucks, you can go eat a baller meal here. I'm eating my mom's leftover Chinese chicken salad right now from here so why not review it. Still tastes good like 4 hours later! My favorite things to eat here are the buffalo blaster appetizers, calamari rings, and the tons of fun burger. Last but not least the Pasta Da Vinci has got to be the best pasta dish I've ever had in my life. Looking at the calorie count it's not hard to imagine why XD Surprisingly I've never had the cheesecake here."
Jenny M.,"Philadelphia, United States",168,440,11,4.0,19/12/2011,"The only downside to this place is that there is always a horribly long wait if you come on a weekend or popular dinner time. Expect to wait 30 min - 1 hour for a table! That being said, good thing this place has such an amazing location - just walk into Westfield and browse around and come back 15 minutes before your expected time :)  On the upside, the food is always amazing (although I've always heard that Cheesecake Factory has some of the most unhealthy dishes because of the portions...). I love/hate how they have so much selection - there's almost too much to choose from! I really like the pastas.  Cheesecake here is also delicious, but I'm not sure if it's worth $7 per slice... I've tried the apple pie (or strudel? forgot), tiramisu, and white chocolate macadamia nut. The last one was my favorite :)  Great place for dates or group dinners. Because it's located so close to home, I'd definitely come back."
Race R.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,2,,1.0,26/11/2014,It is the was place to eat.  I order the chicken enchilada they put spaghettii sauce on the enchilada ... GROSS... and they waiter say is their special sause ..
Rob R.,"Santa Clara, United States",116,52,13,5.0,20/4/2012,"I rarely give 5 stars but me and the pregnant wifey had zero complaints and great lunch.  Diane steak & shrimp scampi outstanding!  Sauces were great for both.  Obviously strawberry cheesecake & key lime cheesecake was really good also.  Waiter was excellent with service & very knowledgable (Fernando) ""I'll be back"""
Francis B.,"San Jose, United States",164,4,2,5.0,28/4/2011,"I just went here the other day with a friend because I owed her a birthday gift, so I take her here. We always passed by I'd just start craving their food. Honestly I've only had their burgers and the Miso Salmon, but that's all the I need when I come here.  First of all, the host walked my friend and I to our table which was in a nice corner of the restaurant. It was a Friday afternoon so there wasn't that much people inside. Anyways, the restaurant has this nice atmosphere; not too bright and not too dark and the music wasn't loud and in the way. It was perfect background music to my friend and I's conversations.  After much consideration, we ordered our food. I think my friend thought I was rushing her, but that wasn't the case. Just interested in what she would decide on eating. So I got the Miso Salmon of course and my friend got the Pasta Da Vinci. While we waited we were given complimentary bread and we just talked until our food arrived which didn't seem to long.  The Miso Salmon is so good. I always loved the presentation with a single slab of salmon over rice covered in the sweet miso sauce. Sweet, but that salty fish taste is a great compliment to the overall dish. The salmon was easy take into with small bites and by the end I was as satisfied with the taste from the beginning to the last bite. The proportion was perfect, because it didn't leave me full and bloated, but full enough that I left satisfied.  The Pasta Da Vinci was pretty good as well. I had a small bite, but not enough to really divulge myself in its taste. Cheesecake factory is always a great place to go with a friend, or even a large group, or on dates. Every time I come I am always left satisfied from the food and the friendly service. I didn't mind paying for my friend because eating there is worth every penny."

Francis B.,"San Jose, CA",164,4,2,5.0,4/28/2011,"I just went here the other day with a friend because I owed her a birthday gift, so I take her here. We always passed by I'd just start craving their food. Honestly I've only had their burgers and the Miso Salmon, but that's all the I need when I come here.  First of all, the host walked my friend and I to our table which was in a nice corner of the restaurant. It was a Friday afternoon so there wasn't that much people inside. Anyways, the restaurant has this nice atmosphere; not too bright and not too dark and the music wasn't loud and in the way. It was perfect background music to my friend and I's conversations.  After much consideration, we ordered our food. I think my friend thought I was rushing her, but that wasn't the case. Just interested in what she would decide on eating. So I got the Miso Salmon of course and my friend got the Pasta Da Vinci. While we waited we were given complimentary bread and we just talked until our food arrived which didn't seem to long.  The Miso Salmon is so good. I always loved the presentation with a single slab of salmon over rice covered in the sweet miso sauce. Sweet, but that salty fish taste is a great compliment to the overall dish. The salmon was easy take into with small bites and by the end I was as satisfied with the taste from the beginning to the last bite. The proportion was perfect, because it didn't leave me full and bloated, but full enough that I left satisfied.  The Pasta Da Vinci was pretty good as well. I had a small bite, but not enough to really divulge myself in its taste. Cheesecake factory is always a great place to go with a friend, or even a large group, or on dates. Every time I come I am always left satisfied from the food and the friendly service. I didn't mind paying for my friend because eating there is worth every penny."
