Tom L.,"Santa Clara, United States",410,480,171,2.0,27/2/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is the ""Rain Man"" of restaurants. In the movie, Raymond struggled at everyday tasks yet absolutely excelled at math. Likewise, The Cheesecake Factory struggles to make edible dinner and lunch items, yet somehow manages to make delicious cheesecakes.  I don't understand why this place is so popular. They have a huge menu that covers a wide variety of different cuisines and all of it is terrible. Why wait an hour for a table and then be subjected to gross overpriced food? Thankfully you don't have to have dinner here to enjoy the cheesecake. You can walk right up to the counter and order either a slice or full cake from their array of flavors. The Oreo and cookie dough are my two favorites, but all of them are delicious.  The speakers here should seriously keep playing ""10 minutes to Wapner"" and ""I'm an excellent driver"" ... it's only fitting."
Kevin Q.,"San Jose, United States",364,72,39,4.0,1/3/2012,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a multiple of times. Every visit was pretty decent. There is nothing bad about this place, but also nothing super amazing, except the cheesecakes of course! On the weekends this place is usually packed, but any other day it's pretty empty. The service here is decent, the atmosphere is great, and the food, well it can be a hit or miss sometimes. First I would just like to make a comment on the cost of the food, yes it is pretty pricey if you think about it. 16-20 dollars for pasta? But then again the portions are huge! The portions are slightly larger then BJ's if you have ever been there. A entree of pasta could easily feed two people(depending on the person you share with of course). Also the pasta here isn't too bad. At times the pasta can be full of flavor and at other times it could be bland. The dishes I had with my group was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, and Steak Diane. To start off the meal of course we had fried calamari and artichoke dip. Let's just say, I had better fried calamari at many other places. The calamari here was a bit bland and sometimes a bit too soggy. The artichoke dip here is very decent. In my opinion it doesn't match up with Red Robins or Chili's artichoke dip as they have better chips and more flavor in the dip itself. The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta on the other hand was pretty good. It had a small kick to it with a lot of flavors, and also the portion was huge. My friend couldn't finish it, so we all had to help him finish. On the side note though, I had this entree multiple times, and it could be pretty bland sometimes with no taste, besides the taste of pepper. The Pasta Da Vinci on the other hand was amazing. It was my first time getting it. The sauce had a unique flavor of onions and mushrooms. The only way I can describe it is like eating pasta with the In N Out thousand island sauce. I know it doesn't sound appealing but it was very delicious. It wasn'"
Sonny W.,"Fremont, United States",19,375,189,3.0,28/2/2012,"Very packed always so wait can be long, but great for kids and crowds, as there's lots of people in those categories.  As usual the portions are big...even the lunch version of the pasta are take away (of course, if you are watching your waistline, you probably want the ""skinnylicious"" menu, which may still be heavy?). As usual, they are delight with kids...the adults get a bread basket (I just LOVE the dark oat-crusted bread).  The kids get their own plate with sliced bananas and bread too.  Also, plastic cups with lids and straws.  Kids menu too. After the chowdown, head over (or back) to the mall to walk off the full stomachs."
ken H.,"Fremont, United States",0,33,,5.0,23/10/2014,"Premium location, good food, ok pricing. I had the Salmon with presto sauce from the lunch menu. It was surprising good for about $16.  We had Calamari for Appetizer and it was good too. Reasonable serving size.  We had no room for cheese cake afterward."
Dustin B.,"Milpitas, United States",52,94,56,1.0,23/2/2014,"Customer service sucks. How long does it take to make dressing? 30 mins...? Really, must be the best dressing ever."
May L.,"San Jose, United States",40,24,7,5.0,16/8/2012,"It is my favor spot of dinning with my kids! Friendly service and fresh food.  There was once my mom found something wrong with a pasta plate that she ordered, and she got a brand new one and free of charge! Their kids plate cheese pizza is my daughter's all time favor! And the price for kid's menu is good. I would rather come here for kid's meal than go to McDonald's.  Also their cheese cake...so yum that I have to order a piece whenever I go."
J. H.,"San Jose, United States",3,31,13,2.0,12/3/2014,"First ocf all you can't make reservation after 5:30!!! WHY??!!! i have no idea especially if its a large party. We waited 1 hr and 20min.  Eveytime we asked how much longer they kept saying 5 min 5 min!!! fianly after getting quite fed up the finaly sitted up. We saw plenty of tables avail but i have no idea why they would sit us. The food was good. We had the fish tacos, kids meals, hambugers and of course cheesecake. The slices are pretty big so i would suggest sharing for sure. We tried the red velvet and its good but the orginal is much better."
Mike T.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,2,,1.0,22/5/2015,"Told there was a 40 min wait. After 50 min, checked in and they said 15 more min. After an hour and 20 min or double the time they said it would take, we were seated."
K T.,"San Francisco, United States",4,62,27,3.0,15/2/2015,I have been to a few cheesecake factory locations. The food does not live up to the hype.
Crystal V.,"San Jose, United States",410,291,192,4.0,9/10/2011,"You must be like a hawk in the bar/cocktail area because everyone wants a table and its self seating. (There are some intense mamas out there!) I've been lucky enough to run into a server who would help me swoop on a table by telling me that a table is about to leave. THAT is awesome service! My friend and I came here before studying (but obviously that didn't work out) and we ordered the exact same thing. They have two of my favorite dishes as a combo so making up my mind was easy easy! It was a steak diane paired with their chicken masala dish. Match made in heaven! We ordered a few cocktails but they were incredibly weak. I wasn't looking to get plastered or anything but a little kick would have been nice. They honestly tasted like virgin blended drinks. mehs. I'll pass next time. I always save room for cheesecake. Its my favorite here! Vanilla bean, red velvet, and upside down pineapple are my go-to favorites! I will definitely be back. (possibly tonight!)"
Soul G.,"Tacoma, United States",7,5,,4.0,24/4/2012,"Alright, we all know that the factory makes it hard to meet your macros and calories due to its ""richness."" Luckily they now have published nutritional information. I wish the information they gave had actual fat content (not just saturated fat) and I wish they included amount of protein for each item. We went on a Saturday night at around 8. we were expecting to wait and did for about 30mins maybe longer. We ordered as soon as we sat down. The GF got a spicy jambalaya dish and I got the factory burger with a salad. I also saved room for a piece of low-carb cheesecake which was pretty satisfying. I barely ate anything the whole day to save up for this meal. It was worth it.  ?"
Nichele R.,"Union City, United States",39,138,72,3.0,12/8/2013,"They claim they cook their noodles ""al dente"" now and you have to request that they cook them completely. This isn't Italy nor is this an Italian restaurant. Wtf? I don't want some half cooked meal! Cook it, dammit!"
Grace Y.,"San Jose, United States",1851,889,188,2.0,28/11/2008,"I hated this place and I said I'd never go back, but I got a gift card here and I ate here and it wasn't as bad as I remembered it. So when a friend wanted to come eat here after a grueling day of shopping, I said sure, why not? The food is still so-so and overpriced, and the service is still rather shoddy. At least I was expecting it this time!  I still need to eat some cheesecake when I'm here. I've only had it a few times and I don't remember what it's like anymore. Boo, hiss."
Katlin L.,"San Francisco, United States",215,172,,4.0,3/3/2011,"This place has a huge menu, but I find myself always ordering the same few things. I usually get the Farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic in a light cream sauce, delicious! This time I got a blackened chicken sandwich..it was pretty good..the pasta is a bit better though ;] I ordered a mojito the last time I was here as well, it was good..but it was like 11 dollars. Things can be pretty pricey and they don't take reservations. So the wait time can be pretty bad on prime nights. It gets 4 stars from me because the food is good and the drink was good, even though it was incredibly over priced. On that note, go for happy hour from 4-6 M-F, drinks and apps are half price! Definitely worth trying, their cheesecake menu is to die for, I haven't tried one I didn't like, Key lime is my fav though!"
Rob F.,"Irvine, United States",12,46,48,5.0,9/2/2014,"Great place, very busy but, this is one place staff keeps cool and service is consistent. At the bar you got real cool bartenders who are down for customizable drinks. Servers are super kind and take the time for you. Food is on par and super filling. Huge portions, take it easy on the bread at the beginning haha. And the To-go counter always has orders on point, checks your orders with you and is staffed for the busy times. Parking lightly sucks because it's at the mall and near the bank/ grocery store but, planning ahead for that makes for an awesome experience !"
Matthew H.,"Menlo Park, United States",77,442,84,3.0,1/11/2013,"On par with most other Cheesecake Factories. I've now visited this location a couple of times and not come away disappointed. If you are at a loss looking at their massive menu, you will not likely go wrong when choosing the Chicken Madeira. This is one of their signature dishes, comes in a gigantic portion and has never left me wanting for more."
Niki L.,"Lewiston, United States",1,29,1,1.0,19/4/2013,"Just went to this Cheesecake Factory for about the third time and it is my last.  I was in the company of 15 other people and the occasion was a birthday party.  We called ahead and they would not accept a reservation so we headed over there knowing ahead of time that we probably would not be seated right away.  That being said, what unfolded was about the worst case of customer service I have experienced in a long time.  At first the hostess told us it would be a 5 to 10 minute wait.  Then after about 20 minutes one of us asked how much longer and then we were told it would be another 45 minutes!  At that point the person who arranged the party said we would be willing to just take tables of 4 at a time and to not worry about trying to seat us all together.  The asst mgr insisted that that was not necessary and basically refused to do that.  After we kept noticing a lot of other people getting tables of four one right after the other we got very irritated and insisted that we be seated in some way.  Finally after a full one hour and 5 minutes we were seated.  They set up one table for us all, but they only brought a couple of menus, and almost immediately came around to take our orders.  When told we didn't even have menus, the waitress seemed very befuddled.  It was just chaos.  They brought us baskets of bread and butter.  After taking our orders they brought out one of the orders, then it was at least 10 minutes before another dish was brought out, then about five minutes after that they brought another one.  When everyone finally had their orders, most of us didn't have any silverware, we had to use the napkins that were in the bottom of the bread baskets.  The food was only so-so.   Never again!"
Michael F.,"Los Angeles, United States",1715,566,100,3.0,8/11/2010,"I try to to avoid the Cheesecake factory because I always seem to find them having an extraordinarily long wait for food that I would consider slightly above average.  This specific Cheesecake factory actually had the shortest wait I have ever encountered, which was about 20 minutes. The service was OK.  The employees ODed on the schmoozing, and were not all that great at the details. The food was just like every other Cheesecake factory to me; overrated with unfathomably high calorie counts (if something has that many calories it better taste damn good!).  This last week when I went here I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It was pretty good, and came with some tasty mash potatoes and asparagus that I didn't eat.  However, they have a pretty similar dish at BJ's that I think tastes much better and is much cheaper as well.   To finish off my meal, I got a slice of strawberry cheesecake.  This was the forth dessert item I have tried from the Cheesecake factory over the last two weeks, and I was not impressed by any of them.  I honestly believe that the frozen Cheesecake factory cakes that you can buy at your local supermarket taste better than the ones at the actual restaurant.  Strange, I know.  I just think their desserts are overrated. If I were to rename the Cheesecake Factory, I would call it ""Overrated with an Atrociously Long Wait"".  I would also rename the ""Weight Management Chicken"" as it is an extremely unflattering name for a menu item."
Joe N.,"Sunnyvale, United States",40,160,,3.0,13/5/2011,"4 stars for the cheesecake and 2 stars for the food comes out to 3 stars for The Cheesecake Factory.   It's a decent back up for when the restaurants at Santana Row are packed and you don't want to wait over an hour to get a table.  I've come here a few times and tried a variety of their dishes, but none of them were really that great.  But, I continue to go her mainly for convenience and the cheesecake."
Connie L.,"Stanford, United States",520,107,76,4.0,20/1/2012,"It's not my first time being here, which is probably why my rating is this high. I ordered the Chicken Piccata, which turned out to be strangely sour, pungent, and unpleasant. Servings are humongous, which I guess is good for your money, but it makes me extremely stuffed, not to mention the obligatory dessert (it's the cheesecake factory after all). However, I'm giving mad props to the appetizers. The Frozen Ice Peach Smoothie is delicious beyond compare, the Thai chicken wraps are absolute heaven, the bread is great. Try the chicken chipotle pasta if you can.  The staff are very attentive and polite, making for a pleasant experience, but the lighting was a bit dark and made me strain my eyes. However, if you're looking for a good hearty night out with your friends, it's a good place to go."
