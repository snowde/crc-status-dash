Sherry M.,"Campbell, United States",0,4,,4.0,10/4/2014,Love love love this place!! I like to try something new everytime I'm there (which is about once a week)!! 4 stars because sometimes the service is a little slow:)
Blue B.,"Palo Alto, United States",3,50,56,5.0,22/12/2012,"The most clean, classy, and wonderful bar/restaurant I've ever seen! The architecture is splendid, and the lighting definitely sets a mood. Their food is clean guaranteed! I personally love their pasta, and their red velvet cheesecake. Their way of keeping track of their costumes is unique and reliable. Another detail, is at their restrooms look similar to what a fancy hotel's master bedroom restroom, but larger! The design of their mirrors and ceiling of the whole entire restaurant is so beautiful. Although their food was a little pricy, I think it was a memorable experience to eat here, and I will most certainly come again!"
Christa M.,"Fremont, United States",114,74,,2.0,10/1/2011,"If you don't want to get a sunburn then I recommend not coming in high afternoon on a sunny day. The front windows have no drapes or shade so when your waiting 30+ minutes you just might burn from the sun beaming in on you. I wondered why everyone was hiding in the shade outside (?).  Also, if you don't like your table neighbors hearing your conversation then I recommend asking for a booth right away. We sat literally 6inches apart from another table I was so uncomfortable! When my waitress took her lunch break, the waiter who filled in her spot rarely checked up on us and seemed stressed. When he was taking our plates away he dropped the plate of butter which hit the back top of my head first then butter all around me. He did feel really bad but never insisted on getting a manager. My food came out dry and chewy on top of everything else. All together, not a good experience. I would go to stoneridge cheesecake over this cheesecake anyday!"
Mary L.,"Milpitas, United States",198,40,3,4.0,5/1/2012,"Food is great. The portions are kind of large so you can probably share one dish between two people, especially for the pasta. I've been there many times and service was great, but once I had a really rude server.  My friends and I tried to catch his attention by giving him eye contact and raising our hands to ask for some dressing and to order some dessert. He saw us but ignored us and continued to assist his other tables and next to us. As my friend kindly called him over by saying ""excuse me,"" he yelled at her and told her she was being rude when he was coming over to the table next to us. We were done with our food for about ten minutes and then he asked us if we wanted the bill. We decided to pay for the bill and go elsewhere for dessert.  We didn't do anything to anger him at all and we still had terrible service. I understand bad days, but it's not excuse to take it out on your costumers."
Stephen R.,"San Jose, United States",136,252,188,2.0,19/4/2013,"although i frequent this place for Cheescake, im also taking into consideration the last two times i've been here and actually got a table which took place over the LAST TWO YEARS. so remember, these experiences are not recent. The last time i went was just for drinks and desserts and the waitress rudely rushed us to finish and hurry up. i was full of drinks and cheesecake though so i didn't mind as much as i should have. The time before that was for my gf's and my anniversary. we were looking forward to a great meal, drinks, and dessert. well we probably waited for an hour for our food from the time we were seated. and right before it was dropped off the waitress (who pretty much ignored us that entire time) said the manager or asst manager was bringing it by. a sigh of relief from us as we were expecting to get some free dessert or drinks for the inconvienance. before we knew it some lady just dropped (almost literally dropped) the plates infront of us and walked away. DIDNT SAY ONE SINGLE WORD TO US. we were shocked by this! i probably left like a $2 tip that night and havent returned for dinner, nor do i intend to. i seriously hope that wasnt the manager, because thats an awful sorry place if the manager (or asst manager) handles situations like that. So to sum up, GREAT CHEESECAKE that i keep coming back for, and i'll never come for dinner here again."
Omar G.,"Newark, United States",3,11,1,3.0,19/8/2012,I have been wanting to try this place for a long time my family and I went there on a Sunday afternoon. We waiting for about 30 minutes which isn't too bad. I ordered the California Cheese Steak sandwich. This was my biggest complaint. It was good but it was seriously lacking meat. It was mostly bread. I guess I am just used to getting cheese steak sandwiches loaded with meat.  Another complaint was that we didn't get out complimentary bread until our food was ready to be served. I don't know if I will be back there again.
Jeanette L.,"Fremont, United States",138,36,14,4.0,17/11/2013,"Came here with a party of 4 to celebrate a friends birthday, there was a 40-45 minute wait for a table. Drinks were great, I had a peach blended drink very good, I had a hamburger, a friend ordered gumbo that was delicious, another order chicken fettuccine again very good, lastly someone ordered the Evelyn pasta, not so good very lack luster but everything else was delicious. We all shared a slice of snickers cheesecake again very good. Staff is very friendly and work hard, I will be back again."
Krystal N.,"Irvine, United States",92,571,5,2.0,14/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is probably my least favorite of all the popular chain restaurants. I feel that for the money I'm paying...I should be getting better food! I swear I'm not cheap either...I don't mind paying a good amount of money on food as long as it is actually good. Nothing at Cheesecake Factory is memorable and worth ordering twice. A few nights ago, a friend and I came in just to grab a glass for wine. Wow, my wine was obviously in the fridge for a while because it tasted like shit and I've had that particular wine before but ewww, no quality control here!?!?  The alfredo we shared was watery and disgusting. Two people couldn't even finish one plate. Honestly, there are so many better chain restaurants if that is what you're in the mood for. I would rather go to CPK which is also located within the mall vicinity any day!"
Michael S.,"San Jose, United States",350,107,2,5.0,29/4/2012,"I have never had a bad meal at cheesecake.  The menu is large and it's had to pick something sometimes, but there are no bad choices. My favorite is only available during Sunday Brunch.  Their Monte Cristo Sandwich is the best."
Carolina G.,"Monterey, United States",174,108,44,4.0,17/8/2011,Yumzoooo! I've eaten here several times and always have loved the food. The only downside is the wait...
Brad D.,"Oakdale, United States",0,30,16,5.0,14/6/2012,I love to have dinner here when I visit the mall. Wait is usually long but I don't mind.
Louie L.,"San Francisco, United States",0,23,1,4.0,3/9/2012,This place doesn't disappoint..usually. Their food is consistent and the waiters are well trained. The service is professional even though they are a chain restaurant.  Minus 1 star because I had unbearable stomach cramps after eating their spicy crunchy beef one time. I came back with a friend a few weeks later to order the same dish and much to my surprise... they didn't sell it anymore.  I'd definitely come back though. Most of their food is good and service is good too
Adrienne L.,"Lincoln City, United States",15,66,28,3.0,9/12/2013,"Food is ok, plates are pretty large.  I'd rather pay less for a normal sized portion of food. You can always take home the left overs, but let's face it, some food is gross left over. Their menu is enormous and because of that I'm sure the food is mostly frozen.There is never any parking here since it is at the mall.  If you are getting it to go, at least there is to go parking.  It is loud and seems like the staff is just going through the motions here.  I'll stick to somehwere smaller and calm."
Linh D.,"Union City, United States",83,270,591,3.0,19/5/2011,"Cheesecakes is always good here, and possibily the bar for happy hour if youre working in the area. But then I came here for dinner. So many choices to pick, and since I didnt know which to choose in between the two choices, I combined them both for a little of both. Which was good. They had a combination meal for their most ordered and signature dishes that you can combine together or combine anything within other meals in that same section if you dont like the set combination. Chicken madera is always good, cant go wrong with that, but the salmon was a bit taste-less.... Appetizer, we had the calamari and the cheese squares, definitely doesnt taste like mozzella sticks just because it was gooey enough..for the calamari it just taste all powder...I didnt want to say something bad about our waiter, he is a nice guy, but how can you serve calamari without lemons???  Besides the entree, we topped it off with the tirasmisu cheesecake, good, yet it tasted like it was lack of something that I dont know what...but yet still good."
Linda L.,"San Jose, United States",75,36,1,2.0,14/1/2012,"When I was younger and more naive, I thought this place was the bomb!  What not to like, portions were huge for the price you paid.   Each time I come back here I remember why I said to myself to not come back. The first time, our server asked to keep our change.  Our bill was like $30 and we paid with a $100 bill- and when I said no, she gave me this pissed off face.  First off don't ask me for a $60 tip if you didn't even serve me and was a b* the whole time serving me. The last time we went, it wasn't that pack.  I understand that servers get busy, but for like 40 minutes was ridiculous.  The server dropped off our drinks and only gave us 1 straw for like 3  drinks and left in the quickness, we didn't see him, so decided maybe the server there can give us a few.  So we asked him, and he was like ""umm, you have to wait for your server"" WTH!  So we asked the manager if the servers were supposed to help each other and he was like ""yes""   Bad service!  The food is okay if you don't  mind the bad service."
Joel V.,"San Jose, United States",581,870,105,3.0,25/7/2009,"I guess I am one of the few that finds the Cheesecake Factory totally overrated.  The decor is beautiful, the servings are gargantuan...but I just think the food is a little more on the bland side.  The menu is a phone book with any meal you can imagine - they even sell ads in it!  In my opinion, one of their downfalls - too many items, if they specialized in maybe 1/3 of those dishes - I guaranty the quality would increase.  The cheesecake is unbelievable - but very expensive. Definitely good stuff, but worth an hour wait at all times??  I say no."
Mikey T.,"Anaheim, United States",211,49,4,2.0,6/1/2012,"Last year, after finding out how unhealthy it is, I vowed never to eat at another Cheesecake Factory again. Yesterday, I broke that vow. Okay, seriously: I'm not the most health-conscious person, and a couple times a week I'll find myself eating out and indulging in a fat burger or some lobster or something, but Cheesecake Factory is downright deadly. I decided to look up the nutrition facts of their menu one day - BIG mistake. A good 2/3rds of the menu contains an ungodly amount of calories and saturated fat, more than any person should eat in one sitting. That said, I was with a friend and we were both extremely fatigued from a long day of shopping and walking, and we also both had CF gift cards, so we decided to settle. Our food, however, did not. Even as I'm sitting here on my bed, typing away on my laptop, a good 11 hours after eating, I still feel it sitting there in my stomach, slowly clogging my arteries. I feel fat just typing this review. And it's not only the healthiness (or lack thereof) of the food that left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), it's also...well, the bad taste. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci; sounds refined, right? Not exactly. The pasta was undercooked, I only received a few skimpy pieces of dry chicken, and the entire dish was lathered with more sauce than it needed. It felt like I was eating a slightly-upscale version of a microwave dinner.  I will say this: the brown bread that they have is absolutely DELICIOUS. And it's not bad for your health, either...well, because it's just bread. As far as this particular location goes, there's ample seating (boothes, tables, high-chairs and a bar area) and the staff is courteous and highly attentive, checking in with us to make sure that we had everything that we needed. This was a pleasant surprise for me; being a young adult, I find that many times, servers do not pay as much attention to me as they do to older customers. Although I certainly don't need any extra attention, its always a nice gesture to receive some. Hey - just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't know how to give a tip when I feel that it is deserved (and I did tip, generously, in this case).  All ranting aside, if it weren't for the outstanding customer service, that scrumptious brown bread, and the good company that I was with, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this night as much as I did."
Brian C.,"San Jose, United States",0,30,,4.0,11/4/2015,"the food is always decent at The Cheesecake Factory, the wait was 1+ hour on a Sat. afternoon at this Stevens Creek blvd location. service wise this location and the one in Palo Alto are both good in my experience(threw in an extra star for the service). the one in SF i'm not a fan of."
Diana R.,"San Jose, United States",65,43,,3.0,14/3/2015,"My friend and I ate here last friday. We of course expected a little bit of a wait time but not 50 mins. I had called earlier ( a few hrs) to see if they took reservations and they don't and they said the wait time shouldn't be more than 25mins. So we toughed it out as parking was hard to find at this location. We were seated and when I sat on the side with the chair, it was slipping all over the place. My friend had the booth side. We ordered strawberry lemonade, calamari, veggie pasta, orange chicken and the banana cheesecake. Food, drinks and dessert were good. What was shockingly sad was the state of the women's bathroom. It was messy, a little smelly, all stalls were out of TP and almost out of paper towels. I would suggest that management has someone go in before each service (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and clean/stock everything. And during mid service check to see that things are good."
Wei Y.,"Cupertino, United States",240,4,1,3.0,6/2/2011,"This was my first time at a The Cheesecake Factory. Although the food was really good (I had the Steak Diane, which was fantastic), the wait times were ridiculous. I went with a large group of around 14 friends for dinner at around 6:30 pm on a Friday night and we had to wait over an hour to get a table. They don't take reservations! Then we had to wait some more for our waiter to take our orders. After ordering, we waited about 40 minutes before our food finally came. Okay, maaaaybe the times are exaggerated a bit. But just a bit. It's a well-known fact that time slows down when you're hungry. I was really hungry. And waiting to put steak in my mouth felt like what was an eternity."
