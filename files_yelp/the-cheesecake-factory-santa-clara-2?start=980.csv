Kristine L.,"Silicon Valley, United States",279,373,75,4.0,13/7/2011,"They serve a lot of different kinds of food here; pastas, sandwiches, seafood, steak, chicken, vegetarian, burgers, Mexican..and almost everything else you can think of. Obviously not everything is authentic or amazing, but the portions are huge and the food itself is better than average IMO. My favorite is the Hibachi steak and the Miso Salmon. The cheesecakes are really good, the best out of anything they offer..and that should be no surprise. Lovely place for a casual dinner."
Ann P.,"Santa Clara, United States",3,6,,1.0,6/4/2015,"The best thing about the place is that they will do up to four separate checks for large parties. That being said, my pasta lunch way too salty, so much so that it was all I could taste.The drinks are overpriced (beers $8.50) and cocktails (margarita with patron $13) were small. They have a large variety of cheesecake, but the waiter failed to ask half the table for their order.  At first we thought they were coming back to take the rest of the orders, but brought the doggy bags, and the few orders of cheesecakes to go along with the bills instead. To be fair, it was a holiday and they were busy.  Maybe the cheesecake is good, but Is unlikely I'll go back."
Nick W.,"San Jose, United States",304,148,40,4.0,30/8/2011,"Me an my long time coworker/friend have decided that cheesecake factory has some of the best burgers around, and we are trying to go through them all for comparison's sake.  So far we've done the Kobe, the Monterey, and the Farm House. Stupid good...  The Kobe so far is winning in the lead, although I suggest cheddar cheese and if you can convince them to do it, get it served on their sourdough baget for some custom goodness. The Farm House comes second with its over easy egg on the top, and also pork brisket over the beef... Best combo aware for sure. Messy as all hell but you wont be sorry Third is the monterey burger. The sauce is delicious but over all the burger is a bit plain.  To be updated as go along, onward through the fog! You're welcome.."
Flor D.,"Mountain View, United States",785,1001,487,3.0,2/9/2010,The only 2 reasons to eat at the Cheesecake Factory are: a hot Asian server named Kim a gift card for $25 dollars. Everything else...MEH.
Bob G.,"Orange, United States",1,3,,1.0,26/11/2012,"Crappy service today on a Sunday afternoon when it's not that busy. The waitress acted as though she didn't even want to be there. Not to mention that she came by the table twice without even getting food for us. If you're gonna check on how we're doing, maybe the fact that we placed orders an hour ago with no food on the table might be a better indication of how things are going rather than asking our annoyed faces if we're ready to punch someone yet! They messed up one of our orders which we specifically asked to be made vegetarian. I have been to many of a Cheesecake factory across the country and this clearly was the worst experience I had. Definitely not coming to this cheesecake factory again!!"
Ninet M.,"Walnut Creek, United States",61,117,119,5.0,11/12/2013,"We always go to this place and we get good service, but Mohammad is just awesome. He has a very friendly personality, is professional and pays attention to all his guests. I went there with my husband on his birthday 12/09/13 and we had a blast."
M C.,"San Jose, United States",0,15,,1.0,22/8/2014,"I was enjoying my birthday meal until I saw a cockroach walking on the table.  It went from the top corner of the table to underneath the table really close to me.  Then, I saw dirty papers and a cloth napkin on the floor next to my foot. There were very young kids on both sides of our booth who kept looking over their booths at us and making noises.  They had food all over their mouths and hands and I was afraid that they were going to fling some food at me.  For over $116 for 5 of us for 2 appetizers, 4 entrees (we split 1), 1 cheesecake, and 2 sodas, I rather go to a nicer and cleaner restaurant with better food and not a long wait to be seated (we waited 35 minutes on a Wednesday night)."
Kyle C.,"Miami, United States",22,22,5,5.0,11/1/2014,Just had a fantastic ribeye steak! The service was fast and attentive. There was not wait for lunch and the server was fantastic I'm definitely coming back.
Charlene C.,"San Jose, United States",304,667,229,4.0,7/8/2011,"3.5 After coming to cheesecake factory last night in Palo Alto, I made a revisit with the hubby at the Cheesecake factory across from Santana Row. We had to wait 15 minutes for seating. The problem is they need to offer more seating for people that are waiting for a table. Inadequate seating is a no no. They sat us near the bar area and we ordered the following Avocado Egg Rolls - Delicious just like last night Popcorn Shrimp - tender, crispy  Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes for hubby caramel chicken for myself with rice Desserts: Limoncello Torte with whipped cream Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake with whip for hubby Drinks: Arnold Palmers for the both of us. They did not deliver any bread to our table, so minus one half star. Nor did they ask if we wanted bread..... I did not like my caramel chicken at this Cheesecake Factory. The chicken was overly fried and too crispy for a rich dish such as this. I felt like it was tough chicken mcnuggets floating in a sauce. I took 1 star off for this dish. So hence the 3.5 stars. The server Jason was very nice and accommodating, so for $82.00 plus a 16.00 tip, I felt like the service was good, the food was semi good, except for my caramel chicken which was a fail."
Jennifer R.,"San Jose, United States",10,23,10,4.0,3/1/2014,"Great food, if you are gluten free they have a lot of good options.  I like the mushroom burger without mushrooms on the gluten free roll."
Darrell W.,"San Jose, United States",0,65,1,2.0,23/2/2014,"Another chain. Was doing birthday shopping at the Valley Fair Mall and needed to have a lunch break. Instead of going to the food court, I wanted to have a seat and relax a bit with my meal before getting back to it. I was seated and didn't get any more attention for about 20 mins. After my order was taken my food came out another 45 mins later and was luke warm. I don't like to complain so I ate it without a word. Although service was slow, she was very friendly hence the 2 stars instead of one."
Brooklynn M.,"Capitola, United States",111,18,5,4.0,5/1/2015,"Me and my by went here last night, super crowded but only waited around 30 mins. We shared the Louisiana pasta and it was so good! Just the right amount of heat and plenty to share between me and my boyfriend. Also split the Oreo cheesecake which was good but way too intense."
Gabby H.,"Ashland, United States",881,79,,4.0,19/12/2011,"I can usually do with or without The cheesecake Factory - the menu is vast and over-bearing and then, because the food is not all that, all I can think about throughout my meal is making sure I have enough room in my tummy for dessert. not the case with this location. it's the best, hands down.  I got the peppered shrimp, there was a lot of them and they were delicious! the black beans were cooked well, the rice was delectable and mmm plantains! cooked to perfection! husband got some type of broiled pork chop it was SO good (I tasted it, of course) and it came with a heaping side of scrumptious mashed potatoes. mm mm good! and of course, dessert :-) tuxedo/chocolate mouse 10x better than it is at the Olive Garden.  only complaint, you have to park helllllllla far away but, ya gotta walk that dessert off anyway right? ^_^ we will certainly be coming back to this restaurant,again, soon!"
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, United States",17,950,366,4.0,29/9/2011,Happy hour 4-6 for food and beverages Love the potstickers Small plates: the endive & beet salads are tasty Save room for dessert Great food service by Roberto
Maria W.,"Grover Beach, United States",5,10,4,4.0,27/8/2014,Fernando treated us like family. Excellent service!! He had the kitchen put together a sandwich that wasn't on the menu. I will ask for him the next time we come in.
Kat K.,"San Jose, United States",105,90,52,3.0,19/1/2011,"I come here all the time for a late dinner. My favorite is the garlic noodles, which has mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, & asparagus in it. Mmm. & I love the brown wheat bread they serve. Don't forget to try the cheesecake! White chocolate red velvet is THE BEST red velvet I've ever had. It's super moist & delicious! Droolworthy."
Veronica K.,"San Jose, United States",6,3,,3.0,16/3/2012,"Me and hubby went there for a late Friday night dinner. Waited for almost 35 mins. One of the free bread, the brown one with oat on top, was really good. We asked for a second helping :p We ordered little cajun chicken and factory style omelet with ham, mushroom, swiss, and avocado. Both of us didn't really satisfied with our meal. The omelet was tasteless. The cajun chicken was also really plain. The fries and vegetables side for my chicken was surprisingly good tho... The food portion was huge.  The service was really good. Both of our servers were nice and polite. When I got home, I was surprised to find the brown bread that i like wrapped in foil along with our meal. This shows how attentive our server is! thumbs up for the service! Overall, I decided to give 3 stars. The service is good, but the food is not spectacular. I don't think we will be back for a dinner / lunch. I would only go back for their ultimate red velvet cheesecake."
Renee R.,"San Jose, United States",98,26,2,2.0,21/10/2011,"The food here is good, not bad but nothing to amazing. The have a wide selection so that is also awesome.  The cheesecake is the same--good, but not a amazing. Likewise, they have a wide selection of cheesecake.  However, the service here is horrible.  I pre-ordered a cheesecake and I selected a pickup time that was not busy (a Tuesday around 11AM). Moreover, I ordered a very basic cheesecake (just strawberry topping). Although, I arrived on time my cheesecake was not ready.  Not only was is not ready--it took them 45minutes to prepare it. The cheesecake portion was done but the strawberry's were not put on. I was told this was done to ensure the cake tasted fresh--fair enough. However you would think that they would have the strawberries cut so that they could be put on quickly. No, sadly that was not the case. Therefore, I had to watch my server cut about 2 dozen strawberries dip them in syrup (which he had to replenish because they also ran out of this) and then put them on one by one. This took 45 minutes.  If one pre-orders a cake I expect arrangements to be made so that last minute assembly (which is understandable) be taken care of ahead of time so that customers are not waiting. Furthermore, there were no bags big enough to hold my cake box, even though I bought a standard size. Although, this is a minor detail--I think it is a 'nicety' most customers should expect.  Likewise, I've also been here for dinner. For some absurd reason they don't take reservations. I think that is completely unfair when customers can expect to wait for three hours and when your food is simply mediocre.  Moreover, the area around the mall has plenty of good places to eat--places that have better food and service.  Thus, I will not be coming back."
Shannon H.,"Cupertino, United States",274,15,2,5.0,13/10/2013,"Servers are really nice and quick. They were always coming by to see if we need anything. The food was delicious and the cheese cake was absolutely amazing :) the only really complaint I have about this place is, it always takes 10-25 minutes to get a table since its always busy. But other than that I love it"
Charles A.,"Milpitas, United States",50,233,19,3.0,21/7/2011,They have pretty decent food. The wifey and I usually get the chicken marsala and red velvet cheesecake for dessert (sooo BOMB!). All of the other desserts are too rich for my blood... Service is always good.
