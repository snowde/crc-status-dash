Jane A.,"San Diego, CA",558,1670,2538,3.0,12/28/2017,"SUNDATE FOR CHEESECAKE Santa Monica doesn't offer a lot of dessert options. Weird, right?! We walked down multiple streets, around the waterfront, searching for something sweet that we had settled for cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory. HA! Of all places. The venue was a little fancier than the average CF I've seen, we were seated on the outside patio terrance to bask in the afternoon sun on a December late afternoon (SoCal is awesome for this).  CELEBRATION CHEESECAKE - it looks sweet, sounds sweet, but after first bite it wasn't death by sweet. Loved how it had layers and texture; mix of cake and cheesecake layers! Loved the cheesecake but the frosting top was death by sweet and I had to chuck it off to enjoy the remainder. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
Y A.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,38,15,4.0,12/9/2017,We had great time there. We had crispy shrimp and small salad for starter. The shrimp was crispy but a bit oily. We had a steak with mushroom sauce and mashed potato and it was really good. We had also a hazelnut cheesecake and it was a blast! At the end we waited for 30 minutes for our check to be provided just because apparently it was lost or mistaken!
D B.,"Oceanside, CA",2,110,7,5.0,12/9/2017,"My wife and I ate here last weekend while visiting the area.  We sat in open seating because they were very busy since it was a Saturday night. Our food was hot and fresh.  We had good service and enjoyed our time there. Our food arrived in a timely manner.  Next time we are in the area, we will return."
Karen C.,"Santa Monica, CA",168,286,809,1.0,12/8/2017,"Ahhh, I am so sad at how disappointing the food was here because I usually love Cheesecake Factory (other locations I've been to). The menu may be the same, but the way the food was prepared was awful. Dry chicken, not even sauce / taste. I thought this location would have great quality since it's such a popular downtown busy area in santa Monica, but I can see why this location's reviews are so low :( maybe their 1) chefs or 2) ingredient quality will get better in the future.."
Koi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,518,1171,5.0,10/17/2017,Great location!  This ones actually really nice! I love the outdoor seating  -the chicken biscuits were pretty yummy! Super hearty and a good for the soul  -honey fried chicken was super crispy and very sweet but it had a good taste to it  -lettuce wraps were pretty bomb! I loved it when they use to let you make it yourself
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,1/3/2018,Ashley a was just awesome after a stressful day I know the managers look at these Yelp reviews and I just want you to know I'm still coming back always
Eriny R.,"Los Angeles, CA",335,146,292,1.0,8/21/2017,"Update: from 3 stars to 1 star  came to visit this place again yesterday Sunday the 20th. I hate to say it but this time the bathroom was full of pee. I could even have my daughter who couldn't hold herself go there. We walked all the way to the food court to use their restrooms. This makes me really sad for sure.  We visited cheesecake on Sunday afternoon for brunch and to celebrate my father in laws birthday. It was early when we showed up so there was practically no wait. I did tell the host that we wanted to sit inside so she handed me a buzzer until an indoor server showed it. I gave the buzzer to my daughter who was super excited about it. The moment it started buzzing, she screamed out of excitement as this was probably the first buzzer she has ever held. We came inside right away and waited for someone to show us to our table. We waited about 10 minutes which was weird since the restaurant was empty :/.  They gave us a table that was roomy for 8 people so we were happy about that. I ordered the corn dogs and the fruit plate for my little ones. They placed the order right away and brought it out. The kids were super excited about it. Two bites into the first corn dog and they didn't want to take another bite. The fruit plate looked old and wasn't fresh.  We all placed our order and were waiting a good 30-40 minutes before the food came out. We ate all the bread on the table and got two rounds of refills on our water before the food came out. The server was really funny and kept making jokes until the food came out. I believe they may have been short handed on the kitchen staff.  I got the shrimp tacos off the skinny menu. They were very delicious but were lacking a little in overall flavor. I did ask for a side of pico to turn up the flavor a little. The beef medallions were also very flavorful. The cheesecake was delicious. I mean I would assume it had to be for the restaurant to live up to its name. Haha Now my biggest issue besides the wait for food was the restroom. I had to take my daughter in and it was filthy. I was afraid to even let her sit on the toilet.  Overall my visit was average and really not worth the big price tag that came along with it."
Makoto C.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,27,10,4.0,11/9/2017,"This is a note for people who are vegan.  You can order the vegan Cobb salad or ""Evelyn's favorite pasta"".  Just be sure to ask that the pasta be tossed in olive oil instead of butter.  Also say no parmesan cheese. The pasta was really good, with a nice mix of veggies which weren't over cooked.  The pasta was semi al dente which was cooked perfectly."
Robert V.,"Los Angeles, CA",3138,400,225,1.0,10/12/2017,"This is one of those chain restaurants that operate on volume rather than quality.  Considering this mall location with the exception of one has had every restaurant turn over due to the high cost of rent....together with the terrible service and sloppy food this will end up with what Eater LA says ""El Dunzo!"" Came here for lunch with four people and ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and specifically asked for no tomatoes.  The food comes out and had chopped tomatoes all over the salad.  I sent it back and 15 minutes later (after everyone was done with lunch) my salad arrives.  Wouldn't you think the kitchen would expedite this order as it wasn't a heavy lunch crowd. The salad arrives and the lettuce was DIRTY, the 'crispy onion rings' were not cooked, and the salad was just disgusting.   Forget this location, as I had better food at a hot dog cart.... ONE STAR for disappointing food!"
Ronald W.,"Anaheim, CA",241,67,65,5.0,11/23/2017,My go to place whenever I am at Santa Monica Place. My girlfriend love this restaurant compare to the rest of the Cheesecake Factory chain because of the outdoor seating there is heated. Well we always order two dishes each time dining here. The two dishes we always get is Pasta Da Vinci and Miso Salmon. Both are our favorite dish and we never get sick of it. We ended the night with an Oreo dream cheesecake.
Sonya S.,"Inglewood, CA",256,743,937,4.0,12/10/2017,"Well this is the first Cheesecake Factory I did not see crowded. We got seated really fast and we sat out door which was very nice because Christmas music was playing downstairs. The food was delicious but it wasn't a typical Cheesecake Factory where they give you a lot of food and you always have food left over. They gave you just the. right amount, that means you ate it all and nothing left over. The service is very well and the waitress recommended a good pinot noir"
Rebecca W.,"Los Angeles, CA",738,320,746,2.0,7/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was so sad. I think they completely forgot about us after they seated us. People who came in afterwards got their bread and we didn't. And everyone knows that Cheesecake Factory bread is NO FREAKING JOKE. When we flagged down a waiter to ask for the bread, you know what they said? Are you ready for this? They said THEY RAN OUT OF BREAD. .... ...... ............... ... ... What? How do you run out of bread? That's like Papa John's Pizza saying they ran out of cheese. What gives!??!!? Anyways, they said more bread was being baked and that we should just wait. Um, okay. So we waited. Anyways, when the bread finally arrived, we had been seated for a good ol' 25 minutes already, and they gave us one measley portion of each. Lol. Ok. I swear they used to give like 4 slices per table. We ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, the Combination of Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon w/ Mashed Potatoes, the Tira Misu, and the S'mores Cheesecake. Surprisingly our food came quicker than I expected. I was also decently impressed with how soft and tender the salmon was. It literally fell apart at the touch of my fork - that's how tenderly cooked it was! The steak was quite good too! V enjoyable. Anyways, food is food and Cheesecake Factory's is pretty standard. But the negligence of the staff here. oh MY. What's sad is that this restaurant chain is such a big corporation that it doesn't even matter to them if they improve their staff service / ignore me and other fellow yelper's complaints about their service, because people will continue going to Cheesecake Factory anyways. Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 (98/100)"
Matt H.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,151,381,3.0,6/28/2017,"I actually did not have a service nightmare during my experience thankfully! Flavia (?) was attentive to our needs, and brought food out promptly. We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table during sunday dinner hours My issue continues to be about the food. The cheesecake factory menu in general reflects identity crisis. How can you expect to serve good food if you try to serve a gazillion different cuisines?  Ordered the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp - while the batter was nicely fried and the inside was tender, the sauce was off, and too sweet for me.  The chicken and biscuits were ok, but the biscuits were not fluffy enough, and the mashed potatoes were bland The eggroll sampler is nice to share - you get 4 different rolls with 4 different sauces. The firecracker salmon roll was definitely overcooked. I think I will only come back for cheesecake..."
Luis H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",411,416,1611,4.0,3/14/2017,"Wow our server was incredible! Shout out to Piffany (Piff), she made our night! Cheesecake Factory, this server needs to become a trainer/supervisor/lead because she has the service goods! She explained menu plates beyond detailed enough to make us happy with our choices! She was fast, not once did I see her stop walking quickly. She had lots of tables but still managed to give time to every time. She is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. If it wasn't for there it would be 2 STARS! Food Spicy chicken Chipotle pasta Very dry, not as creamy and little amount of chipotle sauce as I have tasted it at the grove or other locations. Cajun jambalaya pasta Hardly any flavor, noodles were plain. Shrimp were decent. Fried calamari SMALL Portion compared to other locations. (Pictures as reference) NEGATIVES: -Food is poorly executed -Restroom is has overflowing wastebasket and NO TOILET PAPER. I used the toilet seat covers, I even texted my guest to tell the male staffs to bring toilet paper but I used the covers instead. -There is a 10-15 minute wait for a table when the restaurant is huge!?! They still make you wait even after the buzzer rings. -I would not come back, thank you for the experience the service of the year though Piff!"
Jaime G.,"Bothell, WA",5,88,127,3.0,10/8/2017,"Ate here twice, once for happy hour and the other for lunch.  Pros  Clean  Friendly staff  Good menu choices  TV in bar playing sports  Located in the mall  90 mins free parking in parking garage attached  Food  Cons  Busy  Slow service"
Diana H.,"Santa Monica, CA",26,44,1,1.0,12/18/2017,"Horrible experience...I was there on a Sunday but there were plenty of tables. My waiter was pleasant & I ordered a diet coke & a water while I looked at the menu. He brought a glass of warm tab water...no ice or lemon or straw! He forgot the diet coke. I ordered a very lousy burger...it took 10 minutes to get my drink order....awful ....the ""hostess"" was creepy..."
Stephanie V.,"Phoenix, AZ",80,158,441,1.0,10/26/2017,"Horrible!  1) Ran out of ice to serve water (at least that's the excuse that we were given when we had to ask 3 different staff members to serve us water after we had gotten seated and were waiting forever!)  2) Waitress BLUNTLY let me know that she can only divide our bill into 3 checks for our party of 11 3) Food was subpar - bland  4) Pricing was ridick $100 for 4 people  5) Value proposition- none delivered: crappy service, rude wait staff, bland food 1 GREAT THING: LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION (they will probably be out of business soon because of not being able to pay high rent, see #5 above) DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY OR PRECIOUS TIME TO COME HERE! REMEMBER, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! PS I see that their social media person only replies to positive Yelp reviews...THINGS THAT MAKE YA GO HMMMMMM??????"
Oleg B.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,7,2,1.0,10/26/2017,"Food was good, but service..... oh, slow, super slow!!!  We asked about refill and extra cheese, we finished our food and they didn't even remember about that!  FOOD GOOD, service BAD!!!!  Think twice before..."
ChiChi Jojy K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,37,11,1.0,12/21/2017,"Cheesecake factory ruined my birthday dinner. They lack professionalism and customer service. Our waiter, Gerard, was either inattentive or inexperienced as a server. We ordered appetizers and requested plates to share. Our plates came 20 minutes after the appetizers, and when they arrived, they were dirty and had finger smudges all over them. We let the manager know and he brought over ""different"" plates, which I'm pretty sure were the same ones we sent back. The food was mediocre. The servers need a crash course in food service. From our table we had a view of the cheesecake counter/area. I witnessed a server (African American male with thick red glasses) plate a slice of cheesecake and lick icing off his fingers. Then he proceeded to carry it out to a customer. Gross! If that's what they do in public, I'd hate to see what they do in the kitchen. The servers all hang around the cheesecake counter and socialize, while you're waiting 10-15 mins. for a refill, utensils, food, etc. And by the end of the night, the servers walk around the dining area (people are still eating) with slippers on, pants sagging, and their shirts untucked... I've never seen this before, ever. As a customer, it just leaves a bad impression.  I let the manager know about my experience and he just brushed me off. I will be calling corporate and filing a formal complaint."
David S.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",14,15,13,5.0,12/22/2017,I always order the chocolate cheese cake at the end of the meal to close it with full satisfaction of a cheesecake factory. Miso salmon is good.
Elsa J.,"Hawthorne, CA",13,3,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Wow where do I start, food was cold and the service was the worst service I have ever received my whole life. We were seated and waited ten minutes for our server to bring us water and bread, when she came in with the plate holding the waters and bread she told me to grab the waters and bread from her umm ok. A little weird but still let it passed, then we waited another five or ten minutes for her to come and take our orders. When she came up to us she didn't even welcome us our introduce herself as our server. As time passed we had to ask for water every time we ran out or else she wouldn't even stop, empty plates were left on the table while we struggled to eat with the limited space. At the end when she ""picked"" up our plates we literally had to hand them over to her over the counter including our check because she was too lazy to go around and pick up our plates. Needless to say I have never ever experienced this type of service not even from a fast food chain. Avoid this place like the plague it's not worth your time and money."
Emilie C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,15,7,5.0,9/19/2017,"As usual, the Cheesecake Factory was an absolute delight. I had been expecting the service to be a bit slow considering it was a Sunday evening and very crowded, but the service was great! The food was perfect. I ordered the Americana burger, which I've had quite a few times, and it was delicious. The meat was medium rare, just as I asked for, and the burger itself was deliciousness. The fries were amazing, too. My boyfriend couldn't stop picking them off my plate because of how good they were--we were both a bit (pleasantly) surprised. He ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which he loved. I tried a little and it was very well made. The service the whole meal was fast and our waitress was always one step ahead. She refilled our drinks as soon as they were half empty, and was attentive to our every need, frequently checking on us. I'll have to say this experience was a great one, worthy of 5 stars. And this isn't the first time it's been this good. I've been to quite a few different Cheesecake Factory locations and this one always seems to be the best. The food and service always stand out, in a good way."
Edit A.,"Pullman, WA",0,6,,5.0,12/20/2017,"The service, the food, the place was excellent. Everything was delicious, and didn't take lots of time. The waiter was very attentive, and was checking on us a lot, but not to the point to drive us crazy. I ate Chicken Stuffed Tortillas and it was amazing. The portion was really big, but the food was delicious and light. It was not heavy or greasy, and the mood there was amazing too."
Nadav Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",572,136,292,4.0,10/3/2017,"Fair price.  Great service.  No free parking.  Great for groups.  Great for couples.   Fresh food.  Healthy options.   I love Cheesecake Factory.  I think it's great that they have so many options on their menu.  Because I'm doing a low carb diet I like to get the grilled salmon plate there.  It's delicious.  I also ask for slices of lemons on the side so it's even more yummy.  I also get salads there sometimes.   The salads are huge, fillings, and healthy.  And of course, you can't go there with out at least trying one of the cakes.  I personally don't like the complicated looking cheese cakes, such as the Oreo cheese cake.  It's way too sweet for me.  But the standard cheese cake or the strawberry shortcake are delicious!!!! I will be eating there many more times."
Carlos S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"First of all, I hate give The Cheesecake Factory a one star, just because their food is truly good. I've been dining with them for years in San Francisco.         On Sunday, June 25th, we were visiting their Santa Monica location. They had a 20 minute wait which is their usual time for a table of 4 plus a kid. We got sat in 15, but waited 10 for our waiter to say Hi. Our waiter eventually came and took our drinks down. We order our drinks plus a kid's water. He seemed rushed so he asked if we were ready to order right away, which we said yes. He then told us, ""wait, never mind, I'm not ready."" He spend 2 minutes at our table looking for a pen in his apron, then finally took our order. We ordered a calamari to start and their bread which are both delicious. Our waiter brought our drinks and calamari but forgot about our kids water and bread and took down our entrees. Our Stella came with a dirty glass and which we told our waiter, he told us he would bring a new one in two minutes. Which was okay, since he seemed busy, so we just patiently waited.         When another staff dropped of our food, our waiter quickly came to check everything was okay and took our calamari before it was even half done. We all work in the restaurant business and we know how busy it can get, but pulling food before asking if the guest are done is just rude. We asked to speak with management at this point, the manager promised us a new Stella plus another calamari on the house. We got the other calamari dropped of by yet another staff member but still no Stella. We asked them about our kids water which they quickly brought. The waiter passed by about 10 minutes after, not to ask how we were doing, but to sarcastically apologize about taking our appetizers, we just ignored the comment.       The waiter brought our bill crumbled up in his hand, while shrugging and apologizing for not having any books. I get that, but come on! A crumbled up bill. We told the waiter we never received our second Stella and the first one was never drank so we wanted it taken off. He said it couldn't be done so we asked if the manager could stop by. After waiting for 5 minutes, we see our waiter and the manager walk by us laughing as if we never asked to speak with him. Maybe our waiter didn't tell him. Lucky we flagged down another manager. We told them we were really upset at the whole experience and both the manager and waiter were immature. She said she was very sorry, but would try handle the situation.         We finally payed and were about to leave our table when the waiter brings us a new Stella, which we refuse and he followed back by rolling his eyes. At this point we just wanted to leave and never come back.  Not only did our waiter not care about us, but neither did Carlos, A Manager. This place definitely needs better customer service, and that has to be taught from the top."
Rachelle R.,"Sacramento, CA",136,16,25,3.0,8/16/2017,"Service: I was very happy with the service at this Cheesecake Factory, despite all the negative reviews about slow service. The hostess greeted us as we walked in and we were seated immediately. Afterwards, the waitress ensured that we had a great experience, by checking in on us periodically and attending to us with a friendly smile. I was also pleasantly surprised at how fast our food came out considering there were a lot of people in the restaurant. Food: I ordered the thai coconut lime chicken, expecting a dish similar to thai curry as the name and description suggests, but to my dismay the dish was completely different. The chicken and vegetables were coated in an oily pesto like sauce. I didn't taste any trace of the coconut milk or lime which was very disappointing. All in all the flavor in the dish was mediocre, and I wouldn't recommend ordering this. Overall, I would come back to this specific Cheesecake factory but wouldn't recommend the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken."
Justin L.,"San Francisco, CA",506,163,610,2.0,12/10/2016,"I didn't believe it was 2.5 stars till I went with a group of friends. When I entered the restaurant, it felt like every other cheesecake factory but no wait line. How is that possible? Lol  When we met our waiter, I can tell she was taking care of us but in a rude manner. The tone of her voice and the things she says to you is a bit aggressive. The food comes out and they mess up on my gf's order. That happens but again with the way she talked to us. I think this Cheesecake Factory also cuts down on portion because my Cajun Jambalaya Pasta looked appetizing but a lot smaller than I thought. I probably wouldn't come back."
Jayde W.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2018,"The food was delicious but the service sucked. We wanted a seat outside to see the view, and our hostess was nice but she tried to stick us in a crappy spot probably because she thought we wouldn't know better to say anything. But we did and we eventually got a nice spot. Our waiter did not bring us bread or straws when we saw every other table have both. And then our waiter assigned us a new waiter named Alex, and he stole our change and literally avoided us for the rest of our stay. It wasn't much money but he still did not bring it back and he avoided eye contact, coming to our table, and even ran outside when we went back inside the actual restaurant to leave. Food was good but service sucked"
Angel G.,"Bell, CA",1,18,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Horrible service. We first showed up with a party of 12. The host advised that should be around a 40 min wait, since they did not allow for us to make reservations. It literally took about an hour and a half to be seated, we did not have an option to get up and leave, or else we would have. We sat, took another 30 min before we can order our food, another 30 min to get the food. Our waitress was okay, but only came around the table once for refills. Although we still left a tip.  Please save your time and money and go elsewhere. There is another cheesecake down the street in Marina Del Rey. Im a fan of cheesecake factory, but this place is trash. I understand they have large amounts of people wanting to eat here, but the Anaheim location had tons of more people and did a way better job in organizing and being more friendly."
Christina C.,"Glendale, CA",214,191,662,3.0,11/23/2016,Was second time and don't think it's one of the good places there. Well food is overpriced however service started really good but ended with 15 minutes waiting check and out waiter forgot about us. Maybe because order was not so huge compare to close table which order 5-6 meals for 2 kids and one adult. We shared one BBQ chicken pizza this time and 2 camomile lemon tea so in general we payed 27$ so which I think is a lot for small sized pizza with big thick crust. Btw last time we took fish tacos and they didn't said it comes spicy cuz I'm not allowed to eat spicy even a lit. But if u hungry it's better than food court opposite but be ready to pay 20-25$ per person just for little dinner. (Drink +1 meal) When we arrived at home after 1.5h driving were already hungry.
Christopher T.,"Culver City, CA",63,38,17,1.0,9/1/2017,"I don't even have the energy to write out why this place sucks balls... all I'm going to say is, if you value being trawlers with respect and getting at least half way decent service then don't ever, EVER come here. SERIOUSLY.  If you don't mind being ignored, feeling invisible and waiting till the next solar eclipse for someone to finally acknowledge you and wait on you (even when it's not busy) then please by all means give them your money.  You've been warned!"
James G.,"Apple Valley, CA",15,10,,2.0,9/2/2017,"I have been to a few different cheese cake factory's, and this one is the first time it's ok.  My daughter requested a grilled cheese. She didn't want something big. The waiter said we can't order off the kids menus, asked him why not and didn't have an answer except that we can't order off the kids menu. So daughter ordered chicken with the other girls. 5 minutes later, they ran out of the chicken the girls had ordered. That was that cause that was the only gluten free item they wanted. My biggest complaint, if I want a kids menu grilled cheese, then as the customer, you get me one. The cheese cake factory in LA is not a friendly one."
Yusuf D.,"London, United Kingdom",34,2,,1.0,12/3/2017,Worst cheesecake factory i ever go. The host on the balcony is very grumsy and unhelpful to everything waiter  and the rest of the crew is also unhappy. I will not coming here anytime unless the crew change.
Varuni F.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,12,,1.0,12/7/2017,"I ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta on the lunch menu. The shrimp was not cooked. They offered me other options, but once you've been served uncooked seafood or meat, the whole experience leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The manager was very apologetic and offered me cake, but I politely declined. The cooks should really be more responsible about plating uncooked seafood."
Linda E.,"Inglewood, CA",0,8,18,3.0,6/18/2017,"Love their skinnylicous menu!! But horrible service, The waitresses took so long to get our order and and looked confused at times. We got The salmon plate and the steak medallion. The salmon plate in the skinnylicous menu was good but without the creamy white sauce. The steak medallion plate was by far delicious but very small portion compared to their other typical plates. Food was good but service was not."
Samantha R.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,12,4,4.0,6/23/2017,"I have to say this first: The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant.  This location is beautiful. You can see the ocean from the outside seating. The inside is gigantic as well with a nice bar area.  Dinning in: On a weekday it will be normal wait time. Food is absolutely delicious. Their menu is a book - and if you think i'm exaggerating you obviously haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory. They have a great happy hour too. Amazing drinks and every combination of food, why wouldn't you be happy? On a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 minutes and it will be PACKED. Good luck finding a seat at the bar. Still worth it though, ha ha! Dinning out: The only reason I gave this place 4 stars. I work in the Promenade, so I really come here 4-5 times a week for my lunch. I order takeout because I don't have enough time to eat in. I also want to say this: It is NOT the workers fault. They are very fast and generous when it comes to dealing with the lines. I have no idea why their management would put ONE person in the takeout AND bakery section. This place gets PACKED and one worker will be dealing with cheesecake orders, to-go orders, orders for online apps, phone orders, and running back occasionally getting food. Way too much for one worker, you're a chain put 2 workers at least. Would be 5 stars if I could rely on it for takeout.  Food: 5 stars  Workers: 5 stars"
Ericka B.,"View Park/Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2,12,3,4.0,4/10/2017,"I came here in a group setting, ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. Beautiful presentation matched the nice outdoor seating we had. But the jambalaya pasta lacked flavor. More pasta than sauce/juice to suffice... so of course I added pepper even salt (I never add salt) mmmh and hot sauce. Looked nice though, next time I'll ask for additional sauce. Maybe if more of the paprika was actually in my plate.. perhaps.. Btw, the 4 stars is for the ambience and retry food. Taste was a 3 after my additions. Service, well let's just say I don't remember good nor bad service. I'd give a 3.5 if possible.. but I guess I'll round up for good favor."
M.M 2.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,7,1.0,7/8/2017,"Awful service, it is unbelievable, I used to love Cheesecake Factory, definitely not the one on Santa Monica . Food has changed too. I really miss the Cheesecake Factory on San Vicente.  Dirty mugs and hair in the Cheesecake. Unbelievable"
Amar B.,"Antwerp, Belgium",0,4,2,3.0,10/23/2017,Friendly waiters but the time it takes to get your order was a bit to long for a cheesecake factory.
Michelle M.,"Torrey Hills, San Diego, CA",404,2,,4.0,12/14/2017,The avocado egg rolls here are great. Highly recommend those and the rest of the food was good too.
