Ana Carolina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,17,1,1.0,7/27/2016,"Everything was sooo wrong!  Worst experience ever.  I order my plate without any seasoning since I'm allergic and they brought it wrong. Then they decided to inform that they could not do it without seasoning since its pre-made.  At this point all my friend started to enjoy their meal and they offered to bring me another plate. When I thought they were bringing my meal the waiter just came to inform that my plate was on the fast queue and he wanted to confirm my order. What???? I thought it was done already! At this point my friends were eating desert and I was starving!!!! The waiter brought the check even before my plate arrived in a clear suggestion for us to leave!   To sum up, I had bread and butter for dinner and I asked my salmon to go since everyone has already eaten by the time it came."
Cathleen C.,"Lancaster, CA",46,11,,5.0,3/25/2017,Beautiful. Our waiter Pephanie was amazing. Even though ive been to cheesecake factory a million times i still asked for her opinion and u took her recommendation and it was delicious she knew her menu and approched us with kindness even when we saw her busy. She was sociable and didnt just treat us as regular guest. We felt very welcome. She is just wonderful.
Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,156,,4.0,8/22/2016,"An average of 2 1/2 stars is way too low. My review would probably be 3 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up. I came in here for lunch today and had a fine experience. There was no wait for a table (it was about 1:15 on a Monday afternoon), and the only reason service was a bit slow at the start was because the server in that area was tending to several large groups. I can absolutely forgive that since that's out of anyone's control. I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and thought it was tasty. It wasn't cheap, but it's certainly a better-made sandwich than you'd get at a chain sub shop. The fries that came with it were fine, although I did have to ask for ketchup. All told, I was in and out in about 45 minutes, which goes in stark contrast to many reviews I'm reading now. It's almost as if I went to a completely different restaurant!"
Karen W.,"Oakville, Canada",0,35,17,4.0,3/21/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good no matter where you go. The food tastes amazing and the menu is huge. The wings are fantastic. We also got the crab and artichoke dip and it was so good but they give you only 6 small pieces of bread of go along with it which is definitely not enough unless you are scooping up 2 tablespoons of dip per bite which is too much in my opinion. We also got the crispy fish tacos - AMAZING, the carbonara - pretty good and the burrito which is just average. Service was a little slow but the place was packed so I understand. Either way, a great dinner and no room for the famous dessert unfortunately."
Brittani M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",627,8,3,5.0,3/22/2017,Went to Santa Monica for a mini vaca trip for a few days  . Best food and service I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory !
Mai T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,64,1,1.0,1/27/2017,"Worst cheesecake experience ever. Food was OK. Took my waitress 15 min before she took our order,45 min for food to come out, and she never came by once during the 1 hour we had our food. Wtf"
lanay m.,"Pasadena, CA",2,20,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Waited 20 minutes and our server never came. Meghan and Andrew who were promptly serving other tables near us kept saying they weren't our server (after I waived them over and asked). They also kept saying that the other person was our server... 30 minutes later a manager came and said ""hey I'm sorry I'll make sure you get some bread and your server is Andrew"". It took 10 minutes to get bread from Megan who was not our server...  45 minutes later my moms food never came. We asked for the check and another manager came out and offered my mother a slice of cheesecake to apologize...  Our entire experienced which I didn't even capture was shitty and all my mom was offered was a slice of cheesecake. I guess. This location sucks and my food was gross."
欣,"Los Angeles, CA",139,2,9,4.0,9/17/2016,First time here and I think it is pretty good.No waiting for four people table. I ordered the salmon dish under 590 cal. It was healthy and I like it.
Virginia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,313,340,1.0,7/21/2016,"How many hostesses does it take to sit a party of 4? Six to be exact. After waiting for 10 minutes, we were finally called to be seated. Get paraded back and forth throughout the restaurant, passing several empty tables along the way. We eventually end up awkwardly waiting on the terrace for a few minutes while they ""clear"" a table for us (shouldn't this have been done before we were called?) Then get escorted back up to the inside waiting area and to wait for an additional five minutes. If it was up to me, I would've left since there is plenty of other places to dine in the area. However, my party was very patient. The whole back and forth, hostesses looking confused was just weird and uncomfortable. We finally got seated and asked for a manager who appeared about ten minutes later, rolling her eyes as she walked over. At least she comped our appetizers. The bad reviews make sense now."
The R.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,33,8,1.0,11/25/2015,Update- 7/22 had a terrible experience and no reply from website feedback form. Will never return. The waiter was nice. Food was not up to standards. They cut my grilled cheese sandwich in to 8 strips. Then gave me one quarter the normal amount of fries in a little tin cup. Big let down. Edit: I got a few comments saying it was the kids grilled cheese. I did not order the kids grilled cheese and was not charged for a kids grilled cheese. I was charged full price. I got a message from the cook saying it looked like I had gotten a kids grilled cheese and next time he would make it right. I still don't like the fact  that 2 years or so ago they started putting french fries in a cup and serving you half as many on all the meals. I'm hoping that next time I'm able to get my fries on a plate and get a proper amount.
Emma B.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,16,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Update: tried it again after my last experience almost 6 months ago.  No improvement,  in fact it's got worse. Customer service does not exist in this restaurant. Management give some generic ""Oh no [insert name], hope this is an isolated event, give us another try""....clearly these are not isolated events, and without improvement people will still be disappointed."
El B.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,6,,3.0,5/29/2017,I went there the other night and I felt the rush to get out.  The waiter was very impaciente and it seems that she was rushing to get us out. I had a salmon and didn't even have the time to order a chess ale because she was rushing to leave the place. I felt awkward
Danielle K.,"Santa Monica, CA",925,250,662,3.0,12/6/2015,"Had an average experience. Was seating right away and had the waiter come to take our drinks. We placed our orders while asking he waitress for recommendations. She had told me that the chicken madeira was the same thing as the chicken marsala just without pasta. I ordered it as thats exactly what I wanted. However when it came out I noticed the chicken madeira has cheese all over it (not great for someone who doesnt eat dairy) so I had to ask for it to be remade. The waitress did apologize for not mentioning that however the dinner experience was ruined as I had to wait another 15 minutes for it to be made while my boyfriend's food got cold because he didnt want to eat without me. 3 stars simply for the food quality, would have been more if it wasnt for the mixup."
William T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",39,13,,5.0,12/7/2016,"Cheesecake Factory, that's what's up  They got me in quick, no holdup Got the Mac N Cheeseburger, with some pop Tasted so good, it made my world stop  Next was the filet mignon, this meat was premium So juicy and tender and cooked to medium, Seasoned just right, no need for more sodium  Flavors so amazing, it caused a pandemonium.  Finally came dessert, cheesecake made to perfection I'll definitely come back, no objection.  Word."
Elodie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,3,,1.0,5/22/2017,Terrible experience! I waited 30 min to get a salad to go without dressing and looked like everything was just thrown in the box.
Lynette J.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,37,4,5.0,2/20/2017,"Ate lunch here today, the orange chicken and cucumber mojito was amazing. We sat in the bar area and the waitress who took our order was just as amazing as the food. Will definitely be back."
Josh O.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,75,23,4.0,2/8/2017,I've had a good experience every time I've come here. Service and food are exactly how I experience the other locations.. glad they opened this restaurant and happy to eat here! The ONLY slacking part I think is the bread... why aren't they always stocked on what makes them so famous?
Chris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,131,6,1.0,3/30/2017,"don't expect to order on the phone for pick up because NOBODY will answer. I've been waiting for more than 10 min on the phone, called back again twice but the rep simply says ""busy"" and transfers the call which will never be answered."
Christine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/15/2017,Service was terrible! 20 minutes for our beverages and 30 minutes to have the server come back to take our order.  Seriously? Food was moderate too!
Erika V.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",40,3,,1.0,5/12/2017,This restaurant is the dirtiest restaurant I've ever been to. The food was sloppy and I was just blown away from the unprofessionalism and how long I had to wait for my drinks. In fact I got my food before my drinks came. I don't like to make a stink but it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Don't go here. It's dirty! Gross and totally ran by unprofessional people. Unbelieveable!
