Felipe G.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,37,3,2.0,4/22/2017,"Theres The Cheesecake factory, and then there are Cheesecake Factorys. Ive tried this spot in Santa Monica a few times and everytime I do,I regret giving it a chance.. every single time.  Waited about an hr between our server finding some time on his chaotic run ( cant blame him) and receiving our simple chicken rings and fries plate.. 1 hour! Clearly a screw up, at least the manager came and apologized.. but our night out with the now impatient kiddos had gone down the tube.  In all honesty, for the money spent, not really worth it.. Id probably make the effort out to Marina del Rey location"
Angelique B.,"Irvine, CA",140,7,6,1.0,9/5/2017,I love cheesecake but this one totally turned me off ..... I had hair in 2 food items ! And on top of that our server was rude .
Angela P.,"Asheboro, NC",274,115,99,5.0,6/6/2017,"This is basically a generic Cheesecake Factory. They were acomidating and made y2k food without mushrooms (I'm allergic) and got it right the first time, which I am always happy about. The food was great, the cheesecake was good and our waitress was very nice. No issues and no long waits for anything"
M S.,"Smyrna, GA",0,17,33,3.0,6/2/2017,"Drinks cool, customer service not so much. Waitress was no help at all, with pissed poor attitude."
Raffi S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",3,11,,5.0,10/1/2017,"Our server, Bianca, provided the best service for us on Friday at lunch time. She took my wife's vegan order so well, that my wife was elated when she took a taste of it. My wife is an extremely picky eater, but this vegan sandwich was exceptional. She told Bianca, that it was the best vegan sandwich that she ever had. My wife is also an excellent cook, so she can tell the difference between good and bad food. Great place to eat and we are going back definitely."
Michelle T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",5,21,2,2.0,8/6/2017,"I ordered the fish n chips and it was really bland. I couldn't finish the whole thing even though I shared it with my brother. My mom enjoyed her pasta, but the thing that bothered me was that the people who came in and seated 10 minutes after us were served their food way before ours."
Gym R.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Good food. Horrible service. Rude, disorganized and snoby staff. Orsered a cheesecake witjout cream, came with cream. Asked for it to be removed due to me bei g lactose intolerant.  Tbey decided to give me a crash course on what a cheese cake is. Sad"
Roland L.,"Los Angeles, CA",872,158,371,4.0,1/27/2016,I don't understand all these low ratings.  Came here several times for lunch and it's been a great experience.  Ordered steak medallions lunch special but asked for angel hair pasta and sauce on the side. The food came out just the way I ordered it and it tasted great  Got an ice tea and free warm yummy bread.  Staff was great and when I asked for anything like lemon slices. I got them.  I definitely plan to come back and to bring my friends.  Location clean.  Staff super friendly Food was great
Don W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",223,236,1279,1.0,1/10/2016,"I came for Sunday brunch with a group of 6.  I was actually surprised there was no wait, because at any other CF I've been to on a Sunday at brunch time, there's at least an hour wait. We entered on the side with the elevator, and sat on the patio near that entrance. If you sit on the permitted by the glass wall, you get a great view of the 3rd Street Promenade.  Our group was too large for those tables, so we sat In a booth on the opposite wall. The patio is covered, which is great, so you still get the feeling of sitting outside, without sitting under the sun. They also have heaters above the table in case it gets cold.  I didn't realize how HUGE this restaurant was until I had to use the restroom. This is probably the biggest CF I've seen, in terms of the number of tables.  Our server greeted us quickly after we were seated, and the beverages and bread followed quickly.  However, waiting for the meal to arrive took an unusually long time, especially for CF, where the service is usually speedy. Most locations have the speed-of-service down to a science. Not so much with this place. However, after I saw the size of the restaurant, it's clear to me that the kitchen is just too small to handle the volume of tables -- and the restaurant was half empty when I was there.  When it did arrive, everything looked fine. I ordered the California Omolette. You can see by the photo I attached that the plate looked fine...until I tried to eat the toast.  The bottom of the toast was nearly burned BLACK! And the cook obviously tried to hide it by serving the toast black-side-down.  How is this place going to survive if their cooks can't even make toast correctly? I gave my review 3 stars because our waitress gave great service, and I didn't have to wait for a table.  But the reason I come to CF is for the food, and for this experience, the food came out late and not well prepared.  This was by far the worst CF meal I've ever been served.  Note to management: please get your act together at this location.  Most of the traffic on 3rd Street is tourists, and when they see a Yelp average of less than 3 stars, they're not going to dine here. UPDATE - January 9, 2016 I've reduced my rating from 3 stars to 1 star for the following reasons... I returned to the restaurant with 3 family members for dinner, and we sat at a table in the bar. Our waitress was great, very attentive.  When we ordered, two of us customized our orders. Nothing that difficult, just replacing cheese with avocado on a salad.  The first time the salads came, we realized there was cheese and no avacado. We each took a few bites of the salmon that was on the salad before we realized this.  Our assigned waitress had gone on break, so we told our sub-waitress and she took them back.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the salads. This time with no cheese or avacado. Also, they put the same half-eaten salmon back on the salads. So we asked for the manager, hoping that he could remedy the situation.  When he came to our table, he apologized for the mistake.  He returned about 10 minutes later with our two salads, again with half-eaten salmon on them. We pointed out to him some pretty obvious things that he should have spotted as the restaurant manager. First, he was serving new salads with cold, half-eaten salmon on them. Second, how would he have known who gets which half-eaten salmon?   He apologized again, and took the salads back for a third time. At this point, the other two people at the table were almost done with their meals, so the manager said he would like to buy them each a cheesecake, so we are not eating alone by time the salads comes back out for the 4th time. He also said that he would not charge us for the salads. He returned about 5 minutes later with the salads, but no salmon. He said the new salmon was still cooking, but he didn't want us to be waiting for our meals any longer.  About 5 minutes after that, he brought the salmon.  When the check came, the two desserts were listed as free, but they were still charging us for the salads.  So we had to ask for the manage AGAIN to fix that error. This meal turned out to be way more frustrating and stressful than enjoyable.  This restaurant has a long way to go to reach the level of high quality food and customer service that the Cheescake Factory has spent decades to build at their other locations."
Sandra C.,"Torrance, CA",84,32,80,5.0,5/21/2017,Paulina was the greatest server when I visited Thursday   night. She was very attentive and refilled our drinks whenever necessary. The food was good but the service is the reason why I'd go back! Her personality was so warming that I felt like I was at home. She is the reason why I'd go back and service like that is dime and a dozen.
Julia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,67,142,5.0,6/1/2017,"We came here for the first time to eat one of their famous cheesecakes. They have a large selection and it`s very hard to decide since all of their cakes seem to be so delicious. We chose the ""mango key lime cheesecake"" and the ""lemon raspberry cream cheesecake"" and both of them tasted sooooo good. The waitress was friendly too and introduced us to our new waiter when her shift seem to end. The location at the patio was very nice and cozy."
Annette G.,"Carpinteria, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/17/2017,"I would like to state I have been a waitress for over 5 years. We sat near the bar on the tables with the high chairs. If facing the bar we were the table second from left to right. Directly behind the host. Last night 07/17 my boyfriend, cousin and her boyfriend went out to eat our favorite place The Cheesecake Factory. We have been to the Topanga and Thousand Oaks locations great service every time. However, our waiter (male, light skin, spoke Spanish, not positive on his ethnicity) gave us THE WORST SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!' You ask why? Hmmm well we immediately got seated out our table, not greeted, table was completely empty. No napkins or utensils. Okay, of course as a waitress I understood they were busy no problem. 25 minutes later STILL no idea who our waiter is at the time because we have yet to get a simple ""hi so sorry, I'll be right with you or even greeted us."" I waited 5 more minutes now sitting on 30 mins. Finally went up to the host and asked who our waiter may be to let him know we're ready for him or her. She apologizes and says I'll go find him so sorry for the wait.  Again, no problem maybe there was a misunderstanding. Finally, our waiter comes up to us and apologizes and asks what we would like to order.  First I said can we please 4 waters all around AND may I get fettuccini pasta no chicken, later my cousin, boyfriend, and her boyfriend ordered after me. We also ordered drinks.  Another 20 mins and we ask the waiter when we will be getting our drinks? He said oh that's right LET ME GO GET THEM. Honestly, our patience was starting to run out with this guy.  Everyone got their pasta EXCEPT ME! I asked the our waiter how much more time until I receive mine. HE TELLS ME I NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING. EVERYONE AT THE TABLE HEARD ME WORD BY WORD ASKING THE WAITER FOR MY PASTA.  He later orders me my pasta and apologizes ok, a bit upset at this point because once again the service just getting worse and worse. The pervious busser who originally brought out the food for my boyfriend, cousin, etc finally came with my food. Great, awesome at this point I was relieved to finally get food in me. We noticed our waiter coming with another plate of fettuccini Alfredo and quickly turn around noticing I already had my food. Aka I did order my food it just came late okay that's fine. THIS WAITER NEVER ASKED US HOW OUR FOOD WAS, OUR DRINKS WERE EMPTY BEFORE WE GOT OUR FOOD AND DIDN'T ASK FOR A MORE, AGAIN WE DID NOT HAVE ANY PLATES, BREAD, NOR UTENSILS.  I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOU THE BEST PART..... MY COUSINS BOYFRIEND PAID FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL AND HE SAID TOLD US, guys I'm sorry I'm not going to give this guy a tip the service was trash no excuses. I will admit we did leave a tip $1.75. We start to leave the restaurante and my cousin and boyfriend are left a little behind so they could quickly finished the two drinks they ordered. THE WAITER RUDELY COMES US TO THEM WITH THE TIP BACK AND PUTS IT IN THEIR FACE AND SAYS ""YOU FORGOT YOUR CHANGE."" THEY RESPONDED WITH KEPT IT AND WALKED AWAY.  FEW SECONDS LATER, THE WAITER COMES BACK AND FLICKS US OFF. HONESTLY, AGAIN I'VE BEEN A WAITRESS FOR OVER 5 YEARS. YOU GAVE US TERRIBLE SERIVE THE WORST WE HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR LIVES AND NO APOLOGY FOR YOU LACK OF SERVICE AND YOUR COME BACK TO US IS FLICKING US OFF IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT AND CUSTOMERS. NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. I'm blaming it on the company I solemnly blame it on the waiter.  After leaving the restaurant I immediately called the store and asked to speak specifically with the manager and let him know about what happened. He apologized and I said thank you however, it was not his fault but his waiter/ co-worker. I will be contacting headquarters and complaining about this situation."
AJ M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,10,12,5.0,9/28/2017,"I really like this place, specially the balcony sitting area that has nice views to the promenade.  Food as always really good. I always get the Santa Fee salat and the lemon chello cake for desert. Delicious. Definitely coming back."
John W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,8/28/2017,"Horrible service. Rude front desk staff. Dirty beverage glasses. Had to request parmesan cheese for our pasta orders. On Sunday, August 27, my wife and I arrived with our son and three of his friends for lunch to celebrate his birthday. We checked in at the front desk and were given a pager to alert us when our table was ready. Then, we waited outside with other customers. And waited. And waited. After 30 minutes passed, I went inside to check on our table. Brittany the front desk greeter said the system was down so the pagers don't work. She claimed to have called us for our table but we weren't there so she gave our table to someone else. Her solution? Put us back on the list to wait another fifteen minutes. She lied. She did not call us when out table was ready. Other customers outside had been called for their tables - we were not. Brittany's did not accept responsibility for the oversight, and instead lied. When I objected, she screamed ""You can't talk to me that way! Do you want the manager?"" What I wanted was a table. At that moment in time, a an employee, she was the Cheesecake Factory. Rather than accept blame and be accountable and correct the mistake, she became confrontational. Was I upset? Yes. I had a right to be. It was her mistake. Rather than try to solve it, she became rude. My advice, if you want to eat at a Cheesecake Factory - avoid the Santa Monica location."
Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,3.0,8/10/2017,One the biggest CFs I have ever seen. I came in for half-priced cheesecakes so it was crowded. Our table was wet and the silverware was laying in the water. Gross. Service was lagging and I am going to blame the crowd for that. My food was okay and my cheesecake was great. My waitress seemed like she was trying her best so I am willing to give this location another chance.
Carolyn B.,"Simi Valley, CA",30,31,3,5.0,7/25/2017,"All I can say is: Laura! She was fantastic, my family and I came here for a birthday, she was extremely attentive and helpful. Made sure we always had what we needed, and made this party of six very happy!"
Tina C.,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",10,6,3,5.0,11/30/2017,"By far the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to because of the location, beautiful roof top seatings with heaters (very handy at night). The service is great. Delicious food and it is a large portion so consider sharing."
Junior S.,"Culver City, CA",84,81,98,5.0,4/25/2017,"I Like This Location, It's Busy With A Beautiful View & Service Is Good. The Food Is Tastey & If There's A Problem They Have No Problem Fixing The Issue!"
Jonathan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",269,45,99,4.0,3/9/2017,"It was my first time eating at the Cheesecake Factory and I was super excited for the cheesecake! Well... I did get what I came for. Their Fresh Strawberry cheesecake was delicious and filling! If I only ordered their cheesecake alone, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the actual food wasn't too exciting. I had the truffle-honey chicken. The chicken tasted like Chinese orange chicken. The asparagus and mashed potato was just average. The price was a bit too much for this average qualitied food. In the future, I would definitely come back to this retaurant ONLY for dessert, but would skip out on the overpriced food."
Augusto S.,"Urbana, IL",95,18,34,5.0,3/25/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is always an easy choice when choosing were to eat. This time I wanted to try something different and was surprised by the waiters' willingness to recommend dished based on your taste. The service was fast and efficient and the staff was kind. I could not ask for more.
