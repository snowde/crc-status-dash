Sean M.,"Contra Costa, CA",44,21,14,2.0,7/2/2016,"Two stinkin' stars... and I'm feeling generous right now. My girlfriend and I visited this location in May 2016 while on vacation. Yeah, I really don't know why I went here during vacation. Anyways, it was a weekday lunch hour and not busy. Generally, the place looked neat and clean. The workers - not so much. Uniform and appearance do not always reflect service, but I felt like that was the case during my visit. Cheesecake Factory, Santa Monica - please (enforce) some kind of hygiene / appearance policies on your workers. Long fingernails, an unkempt appearance and a sloppy uniform are just not acceptable. After ordering our food, we were served essentially room temperature water. As if that was not enough, my plastic cup obviously had some leftover food particle. I almost always use a straw when drinking from restaurant cups - and this visit was not going to be an exception. A second request for straws had to be made, but it eventually arrived. I forgot what we ordered, but I remembered I did finish my plate (they're fortunate I was hungry, or I might've been more critical of their food). I believe my girlfriend finished her plate too. My biggest gripe during our visit had to be our utensils (see photos with knives and napkin). I cleaned my knife by dampening my napkin with a little water and vigorously rubbing the knife. The knife on the right is the one I cleaned, and the knife on the left is the one I was about to clean (my girlfriend's). The napkin shows the dirt that was removed. I believe this location attracts more tourists than locals and constantly has different customers. Hence, this establishment's inability (or unwillingness) to improve their service; they don't really ""lose"" business as a result of their poor service. Yes, poor service (see that 2-star review?). Lastly, I wish I checked Yelp before I visited their location. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere!"
Jared Y.,"Santa Clarita, CA",140,15,,1.0,8/22/2017,Stopped at this location for the first time to grab dinner with my wife after work. Arrived at 8:15 and promptly seated in a beautiful view seat. That's where the beauty of this place ended. Ordered drinks and an appetizer immediately. Appetizer arrived within 5 minutes. Drinks never arrived. I finally walked up to the bar and retrieved 2 glasses and fillet them with water myself. Waitress finally came after 25min and asked why we had a picture of water. I told her why and she had the audacity to tell me they use different cups for water. Duh. There's more to this waste but long story short we got up and walked out. I should have looked at the Yelp rating. There's no reason that location should be rated so low. Time to replace the management at this failed establishment.
Abigail R.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,4.0,5/31/2017,So my boyfriend and I came in for a quick bite and to watch the Penguins Stanley Cup finals although it took our entire meal to get the game on everything else was fine. We were taken care of a guy named Minor(spelled wrong) and a lovely lady named Lauren. They took great care of us. We were in the bar area and from being in the industry I know that part is always busy. Our food came out fine... the chicken wings looked weird inside so we asked and turns out it was the vein which I completely agree with I just wanted to make sure. They both were very tentative about our needs and made sure we were take care of so on their part they're both amazon servers and the kitchen did great. That's all I want (I am also a corporate trainer in a large east coast chain)  I wish you the best
Leighton P.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,60,17,4.0,4/24/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake factory a few times now. Although its really busy and the wait is always long, the service is generally anyways good. I mostly come here for the amazing cheesecake. Its really heavy so I recommend splitting one with a friend and definitely have a glass of water with it. Great for dessert and a nice dinner."
Waverly N.,"Santa Monica, CA",259,6,12,1.0,7/6/2016,"Just had to sit and listen to employees gossip for about 50 minutes next to my table. Right next to me!  I understand that you are excited to see ex employees or friends but I shouldn't have listen to your chatter for 50 minutes. And when I complain to a manager about his employees socializing, he discounts their 95 dollar tab. I'm the one who should be discounted. Ridiculous! Definitely contacting corporate! Be professional, this is Santa Monica. I should not have your butt in my face."
Sudhir K.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,16,9,4.0,9/9/2017,"Love the decor, service, ambience and especially the food. Tried the fettuccini alfredo and mac and cheese glamglow burger and absolutely loved it! Couldn't eat a desert this time. The service is prompt and quick. Definitely recommend!"
Vicki Y.,"Hayward, CA",0,24,,3.0,2/24/2017,"Around the neighborhood.  Food is ok but the waiter didn't pay attention to us for what we need.  We had party of 4.  No napkins on the table at first.   When we asked, he provided small paper napkins like for drinks.   When we emphasis that we never have clothes napkins, he brings 3 napkins in but still missed 1..... When he asked the water,  it didn't come until we asked for 2nd time......"
Linda C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",793,255,830,2.0,1/31/2016,"Review is based off service and food, not dessert! Tip: call in for reservations if you're planning to get dinner here on a weekend! I didn't mind the wait to be seated since I didn't make a reservation. When my friend and I were seated, the waitress took our drink orders and came back to take our food order. The appetizers came out fairly quick, but we waited about an hour for our actual food to get there. I asked the waitress about 30 minutes after our appetizers if our food was coming out and she told us that it would be out shortly because she wanted us to enjoy our appetizers. I thought I was just being impatient, but another 30-40 minutes later our pastas finally came out and by then I wasn't even in the mood to eat. The stuffed mushrooms were okay, but they were a little cold by the time they got to our table. I do recommend the fried calamari, though. I ordered the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic (Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce). The roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce was delicious, but it was a little too watery for my taste. Overall, the food was okay compared to other Cheesecake Factories I've been to. Probably won't be coming back to this location."
Mahnaz B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",846,110,37,5.0,8/21/2017,"My favorite location... they don't make me wait too long, even if they do, it's worth it because the food is amazing. Highly recommend their Mac & Cheese Bites!!!"
Steve K.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.   The service is horrible.. I mean horrible. All you have to do is follow the other 10 million cheesecake factories and you should be okay,but apparently that's also hard to do.  This place is ridiculous.  Maybe the last time I will ever go to a Cheesecake Factory."
Ann L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,5.0,2/11/2017,"I'm so happy that we get delivery through Door Dash!  We love the food and desserts here and it even arrives hot!! Try the Romano Crusted Herb Chicken and pasta, you won't be disappointed!  Even if you're a teen-ager!"
Julisa P.,"Bakersfield, CA",39,4,1,5.0,9/7/2017,Amazing staff everyone was so kind and helpful BIG shout to Antoinette such a sweet and welcoming server. Looking forward to visiting again soon.
Russell C.,"Downtown, Santa Monica, CA",50,5,,1.0,6/3/2017,Bad service. Both forks had dried food on it. The chicken was not a good cut. There is a reason why this restaurant has a bad rating. Other cheese cake factory's ive been to are good. Choose a different place to eat in the area if you have the option.
Brenda B.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,36,27,5.0,12/19/2016,"We were hesitant to have lunch at this location due to the bad reviews, but we didn't feel like looking around for something else.  I told my husband, ""how bad can it be?"" I'm glad the bad reviews didn't discourage is from stopping by.  We had a really pleasant lunch.  We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table and service was prompt and our waitress, Andrea, was friendly.  Our food arrived at our table in a decent amount of time and everything was great.  Our experience was the same as in any of the other locations.  We had a great meal and great service."
Chey P.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,183,98,2.0,7/12/2017,"So far not good guys---didn't get any service at all not even water and bread.  4 servers were free and chatting, Ive made eye contact and nothing.  Tsk tsk.  done with this location."
Kathrina W.,"San Antonio, TX",23,11,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Worst cheesecake dining experience we've ever had; food great, everything else on par with McDonald's. Overkill on wait, empty tables everywhere (tells me the didn't staff right). Once beeped to go to the counter, had to wait again for another five min while they cleaned the table we'd be sitting at... Then sat down only to wait another ten min for drink order, another 7 for drinks to show up and 30 for our app. We left after that, decided not to eat, ran out of time!"
Regina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",195,39,67,4.0,1/16/2017,"This is an awesome location for The Cheesecake Factory. The wait is NDB because there's a ton of window shopping you can do during that time, if you're into that. We walked around, but sadly for me and to my wallets relief, I didn't buy anything. We timed it perfectly, because when we came back up, it was our turn to be seated!  I love the set-up because there are so many cute little booths all over. If you get a window seat, you may be able to nom and people watch. It's the BEST! I don't like to be too adventures with this menu. I go with my oldies but goodies. Avocado egg rolls for apps (the sauce is yum!) and chicken madeira for the main dish. Never disappoints. The only thing that really sucked and almost made me give them 3 stars is the service. Sooo slow. SO nice! But sooo slow. Good thing they're consistent with my usuals."
Tamara K.,"Glendale, CA",153,85,17,4.0,5/16/2016,"I was shocked to see all the negative reviews for this location.  Dined here yesterday for lunch and it was like any other Cheesecake Factory. There was a 20-minute wait for outside seating, but we actually waited only for about 10-minutes (yay!). Our waiter was super friendly and nice. I have dined at The Cheesecake Factory many times, so I knew already what I wanted. I ordered the lunch portion Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta and my husband had breakfast/brunch (yes, they serve breakfast until 2:00pm).  The food was fine and the waiter was great."
Nikol N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/24/2017,"If it wasn't for the great service that I got from the waiter, I would be much more pissed. We ordered two different burgers off the menu. Both had beef that was overdone. It was burnt. There was fat dripping out of the burger. There was no bacon from which fat would be dripping from. The fat was coming out of the beef. The gluten free bun was completely soggy and after two bites turned into a mush. The waiter apologized, but it is obviously not his fault that the kitchen was not up to standards. There were tables next to us that were also having issues with their meals and unfortunately for the waiter we had, it was also his table. I haven't been to this location in about a year and this has been one of worst meals that I've had at this chain."
Steve F.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,177,4,1.0,1/4/2017,"Does my table come with a waiter? What happened to that guy, he disappears twice"
