Ye-ji J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,5.0,8/23/2017,"Junior is the best I went with a friend and she loved him as well saying that he's funny. The servers are extremely busy carrying heavy trays of food and taking orders but he went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and our order was received accurately, our food came out so quickly  & he made sure our needs were met without us having to ask for anything."
Edgar P.,"La Palma, CA",295,238,40,3.0,12/29/2016,"Great décor and great location.  Service wasn't very attentive, and the food was what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory (neither here nor there).  Big plus at the bar... they now have some good Scotch and Bourbon offerings (Booker's, Oban, etc) so I was able to settle into a nice drink."
Michael C.,"Santa Monica, CA",201,256,36,2.0,1/6/2017,"Fantastic location and space, but something is seriously off with the food and drinks at this Cheesecake Factory. I've eaten at several other locations across SoCal, and Santa Monica manages to consistently ruin classic items. Here's what's wrong with the happy hour here.  Fried chicken sliders: These are usually fantastic and really help scratch that Chick-Fil-A itch. Here, the chicken is overcooked. Hamburger sliders: Again, usually excellent but dry and overcooked.  Crab and artichoke dip: The dip is fantastic, but the crostinis are...you guessed it, dry and overcooked.  I could keep going, but you can pretty much apply this to most items on the menu. The food is still plenty edible, but this Cheesecake Factory needs to step up its quality control."
McKenna L.,"Westerville, OH",1,16,,1.0,9/30/2017,"The service here was absolutely ridiculously horrible. My roommates and I waited an unbelievably long time to be acknowledged by anyone. Our server was sweet but ungodly slow. I think we were served by like 5 different people because our server couldn't handle the table on her own (possibly a result of understanding which I don't blame the server for-- she was really sweet despite being slow). My appetizer came out cold and they did bring me a fresh one.. after my meal came out, but it was nice to have something to snack on while I waited for them to bring the correct toppings for my sandwich.  The manager was by far the worst part of our experience. She literally argued with my roommate when my roommate brought to her attention that her sandwich was missing most of the promised ingredients. The manager did comp the meal but not before LITERALLY ARGUING that the sandwich had the correct items when it visibly didn't. Who does that?? She was like ""oh you asked for no tomatoes, that's why it doesn't have tomatoes."" But like.. that didn't happen? Horrible service. If you wanna spend hours here eating the wrong order and wondering what day it is bc you've been there for so long, by all means go to Santa Monica cheesecake factory lol"
Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",161,11,9,1.0,7/16/2017,"This place looks great but the service is terrible. The servers aren't very friendly and they take forever to bring your drinks bring you your bread. They are slow to put in your order for the food and it can take up to 20+ minutes just to get the food that you ordered, even when it's a salad or a sandwich and soup. They are often out of the ingredients that you need for example when I went for lunch today they were not serving anything with turkey and did not offer to substitute the turkey for anything else so we had to order completely different items off of the menu. The last two times I ordered soup came out and was not appetizing. The servers really check in to see how the food is doing. This place needs some help!"
Felisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,38,11,1.0,10/30/2017,Came here for my 16th anniversary dinner and Unfortunately I had to bring my kids with me ... so we get there and they sat us down overlooking the promenade which was a beautiful view but then.. they took forever to bring our drinks took even longer to bring my martini the waiter said the bar was busy even though it's Monday the waiter took our order and we waited at least 30 min for our food but the forgot my son we had to wait another 15 minutes to get a waiters attention in order for them to bring it out which took an additional 10-15 minutes which by then my food was cold the waiter never came around for refills and when my husband asked for the dessert menu he let them know it was our anniversary and if they could do something extra to my cheesecake they gladly obliged .. I didn't realize that meant I was going to get my dessert last AND the waiter was going to forget the lighter to light up my sad little candle and I would still have to wait in order to enjoy my slice will definitely reconsider coming here again for anything special
Cynthia S.,"Carson, CA",35,17,32,4.0,3/11/2017,"The wait time was acceptable, it was a busy Saturday.  Our server was polite, service with a smile.  We had chicken pop stickers, I had a Greek salad which was excellent, and a sampler of egg rolls which was also Good.  I had the avocado egg roll which was different but good.  I might make them at home!"
Shunran Z.,"University, Las Vegas, NV",9,4,1,1.0,5/16/2017,"We wee party of 5 had been there sit on the table for 10 minutes and nobody serve us. So we decide to leave, On my way walk out, I was try to telling the host saying nobody serve us for 10 minutes and the host just ok and bye. Such a bad service for me since I'm from Vegas."
Utku K.,"Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA",20,1,1,1.0,6/14/2017,"Okay so this restaurant is the worst service was horrible. The waitress named Pamela was looking super angry and crazy. She brought me burger without french fries and Ive never eat a burger without ff in my life. When I asked about ff to her, she was mad and told me that I will bring keep calm. I was already calm. This restaurant is bad at all!!!"
Bonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,516,615,3.0,8/28/2016,"Having so many restaurants to choose in the area, Cheesecake, is often not at the top of our lists, but it's a great place for large groups. The menu is still as large as ever, but I was pleasantly surprised by the lettuce wraps (which was enough for a meal), and the salmon lunch special. I didn't feel like I left feeling like a whale!"
Wesley T.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,7,,5.0,2/3/2017,"Pretty sweet location in a cool outdoor mall. Perfect to enjoy the sunny LA weather. Went in the late afternoon and was able to grab a seat for 2. The service was great, as our waiter was very friendly and attentive. We had drinks and the factory nachos. The drinks and food both took a little long but the nachos were legitimately the best I've ever had. The chips were seasoned well enough to be eaten alone and were strong enough to not break despite the heaps of cheese, guac, salsa and sour cream. Some chips felt legitimately heavy in my hand from all the toppings. Finished the meal off with a strawberry cheesecake and it was delicious as they always are. The cheesecake came out almost instantaneously, evening out the wait for the other items. Took a while but was well worth it so I'll give it 5 stars. Need to see if the nachos are of the same quality at other locations."
Zuley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,4,,5.0,8/23/2017,"I Stopped in for a Slice of Cheesecake & ended up making the decision to just dine in. I went in with my sister & we got the Louisiana chicken Pasta as well as the salad our Server *Jr* recommended the Kale & Quinioa salad with Chicken & Avocado, it was so good! Our experience was just so good from start to finish, we also got the Strawberry cheesecake.  Our Server was amazing, the service was really good & the food was so tastey... I will be back to this location because he made our forst visit so good"
Rachel G.,"Inglewood, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory yesterday (Tuesday 08/20/17) and I had an amazing time. My boyfriend and I got to sit in one of the beautiful outside booths. The weather was amazing as well as our service. Adrian, our server, was quick and always there when we needed him. I am only writing this review because he was so great. The food was also crazy delicious, as usual. The fried mozzarella and spicy chicken sandwich are to die for. My boyfriend went crazy for the Steak Diane. It's also crazy filling, we could barely finish our plates. We really did have an amazing time thanks to Adrian and the chefs. Thank you! :)"
CJ C.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,9,20,1.0,7/3/2017,2 hours later and I'm still waiting for my food  the wait for everything is ridiculous! Hire more people.
Tee G.,"Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/5/2017,I have been sitting down now for 20 minutes and still have not gotten any bread. I have asked four different waiters ... I don't think I should even have to ask for it. should be known when a customer is seated to have bread for them .
Cindy F.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,18,,2.0,8/12/2017,My son and I went to this location last week during our summer vacation. We asked for the rooftop because we like the scenery. This is the second year ina row we have come here and the same thing happened. We got seated and no one came by for over 20 minutes. Finally I got up and asked where our waitress is. Again 20 more minutes. We only wanted Cheesecake which was good. Worst service ever. Second year in a row. Over an hour to order 2 slices of Cheesecake? Not worth it.
Rebecca B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,10,1,4.0,1/9/2017,"I was skeptical to go here since the reviews were so bad but I had a great time.  Our waitress was so nice and made sure everything was perfect. Our food was delicious. The only negative part was the host in the front was rude, she wasn't very welcoming but we still enjoyed ourselves."
Tia P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/3/2017,"$78.00 tip charge onto my card  for a $21.00 check? Lol Really? I had a few issues in the past with either my food or service at other locations but this tops it. I had to go through a hassle trying to clear that up. Thanks!  (But no thanks) plus the food this time around was mediocre so with that being said I wish I can give ""0"" stars."
Regina S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/18/2017,Came for a lunch service. Server barely gave us any recognition. The bread was incredibly stale. Food took forever. Server completely ignored me twice. Do yourself a favor and do not come here.
A S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,66,13,4.0,7/16/2017,"Long wait as usual but went to the bar and found seats quick. Service was great food came out fast, drinks were on point !!  Came to celebrate a birthday it was a great choice"
