Charles H.,"Lawndale, CA",13,4,,1.0,12/2/2016,Very rude slow service  Place was empty yet they made us wait To be seated. Waitress came and left without taking order. Place seems to feel customer is a burden  Cannot see how this place stays in business. Utensils dirty  Makes dinning a bad experience
Mason S.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,3,1,5.0,8/14/2017,"Best experience for ever , I try different places but this location was wonderful nice stuff and great food"
Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,3.0,6/18/2016,"This eatery is located in the heart of Santa Monica and blocks from the beach. This location is surrounded by shopping stores and offers an excellent view of Santa Monica. Upon locating this location, from the street level, one has to take an elevator to get to the actual restaurant. Once arriving to the hostess stand, I remained standing waiting to be greeted for about two minutes before any acknowledgement. It felt awkward to be in a full eating establishment and no one there to greet you at the hostess stand. After being seated, about six minutes later, a male came by the table and dropped off silverware. He actually placed it onto the table with no napkin or paper to protect silverware from substances on the table. That was upsetting to see and disgusting. Request was made later for new silverware. Consideration of germs please!  The server arrived and food was ordered. The server seemed like she wasn't excited to be working. No facial expression of excitement.  The food arrived promptly after placing the order. However, there were no drinks with the food or straw therefore, had to wait for drinks and straw to arrive before being able to eat. Personal preference, but staff for the most part seemed rushed and unhappy.  The sandwich ordered was a southwestern as requested. Tasted fresh and the presentation was quality looking. The sandwich was filling. Another person at the table ordered a chicken plate. The chicken was tasty and presentation looked appealing.  Unfortunately, on this visit, the little things mattered though. Having to wait for the check for 15 minutes after eating was also not appreciated. Training could be considered to benefit sales and constant quality level of service to guests. At this point, there is no reason to rethink of visiting this location. Improvement on their level of service should improve."
Joey W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Most unusual and memorable restaurant experience I have had. Not in a good way. The customary process of sit, order, eat and pay was a challenge here. We went to the bathroom between dinner and dessert and when we came back the dinner dishes were cleared. A moment later, a hostess tried to seat a party at the table. We told her we were waiting for our dessert, and - by the way - had not paid our check. Over the ensuing minutes, a series of increasingly responsible restaurant staff came over and confronted us, accusing us of various and sundry misdeeds, including ""self-seating"" and demanding that we leave the restaurant. A young woman did an exceptional impersonation of Columbo, demanding that we describe our waiter in detail and explain - if we had eaten - where the dishes and our drinks were (""We don't clear the drinks after dinner""). Finally the manager came over and started the same routine, I responded as before. At this point I didn't even care about the desserts, but kept reminding them that I had not paid a check. Finally, they located the waiter and the manager came back to explain that there had been a series of mishaps: table number was in the computer wrong, then the bussers thought we left when we went to the bathroom, then the desserts fell over before they could be served. I don't think he really apologized for those mistakes, and hey, things happen. But he definitely did not apologize for several members of the restaurant staff accusing us of all manner of misdeeds and crimes and trying to kick us out of the restaurant. He ""graciously"" took one of the desserts off the check. For having been embarrassed, interrogated and accused (because of their series of mistakes), I got $8 off. And since this is an entirely honest review, I conclude by saying that the carrot cake was awesome.  Don't go here. If the front of the house is in this much disarray, the kitchen must be as frightening as the attitudes of the staff."
Shiran W.,"Culver City, CA",24,41,34,1.0,10/5/2016,I don't think I've ever given a business one star before. If there was a way to give them zero star I would. Now you have to first understand the full situation. I was so pregnant about to pop (tired was an understatement) a friend came in town that I haven't seen in years so I decided to meet her at the food court for our kiddos to play. I wanted to eat healthy and there was no line at the Cheesecake Factory so ignoring the bad review I went in. I mean how bad can take out be? WRONG! The lady at the bakery was friendly and nice. My husband wanted something different it was basically buffalo chicken strips with the sauce on the side. I wanted the standard Miso salmon. Mine turned out just right they got him the wrong thing after already missing my friend for 15min waiting I had to go back and tell them it was off. Honest mistake. I waited maybe 10-15 just for the manager and he reentered my order this time correctly. Me being pregnant I had to stand (no more room to sit) another 15min waiting. Slightly annoying no big deal. Except when I got the order it was wrong again!!! I didn't realize it until I got to the food court. Back I go to let them know. I ask for the manager right off who didn't show up!!!!!! I waited and waited standing again The lady who was nice that helped me finally after 15-20 minutes ran back to the kitchen to start a new one acknowledging the kitchen screwed up. Now this is 45min missing out of my quality time with my friend while standing there 9 months pregnant where the manager did not show up to speak to me until I asked for him 3 times!!!!  I finally got the correct order 1 1/2 hours after placing the initial order. By then hubby famished already ate poor daughters pizza from the food court. I voiced my frustration with the manager when he finally came over. He said he will send me a gift card as an apology and got my address promising to mail it immediately. It never showed up. A week later I called for the principle to complain spoke the main store manager said she would look into it and give me a call back for sure. No surprise never heard from them again.
Nestor C.,"Palmdale, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,"I'm not one for leaving a negative review somewhere, usually I just let it go and don't go back if it was really that bad. But man this cheesecake factory location is absolutely terrible! The food is fine, I have no complaints about that but the customer service is honestly the worst. Ive come here a few times and everytime it's the same thing. We get seated but don't get serviced for almost an hour (no exaggeration, quite literally timed it this time). This time was even worse! About 45 minutes after being seated and didn't even get asked for the simple things like if we would like some water while we think of what to order. Throughout the whole time we were trying to get a waiters attention to politely ask them to have someone take our order, at this point we've been waiting long enough to decide what we want to eat but every waiter that passed us by would look over to our table but wouldnt ask if weve been serviced yet or not. Definitely not coming back to this location and making sure everyone I know never comes to this location. I would've liked to talk to a manager on duty instead of writing this terrible review but like I said, couldn't even get someones attention."
Steve S.,"Calabasas, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/7/2017,Not one of the better Cheesecake locations.  I enjoy Cheesecake factory and have dined at many locations usually ordering from a few select items that I like.  The same items ordered here were sub par and the service is slower as well. I recently moved to Santa Monica and I thought this location would be a go to once a week but unfortunately it has disappointed  me too many times.
David C.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,8,9,1.0,5/8/2017,"So today I went to the Santa Monica cheesecake. I have been here before a handful of times. And the service has always been good. Today though was a different story. After watching a movie at arclight with a friend, we decided to pass by and have something to eat. We were promptly seated at 3pm. But, by 3:21 we had not been acknowledged by any one beside the hostess. We informed the hostess in the front and said she would get somebody to help us. Nobody came once again. It wasn't that busy and we even saw some waiters standing around and talking. At that moment we decided to leave and decided to to go to Sonoma wine which is right next door. I love coming to the cheesecake factories in the marina and the grocery. But, santa Monica is off my list now. Very disappointed since it's in my neighborhood."
Krys K.,"Culver City, CA",0,7,2,1.0,11/23/2016,"Should have read the reviews before having dinner here! We got seated quickly but that were it ended. Food came out before drinks! Food came out before bread! Cheesecake rule 101  Bread and butter 1st or at least second to drinks Manager (Keith) came over and said sorry and that was it. Take your $ to another nearby Resturant, you'll thank me later"
Teresita B.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,10,1,2.0,8/9/2017,"This was probably my worst time at Cheesecake Factory. The service was a disaster. When we sat down, part of the table was wet. Then when they brought the tea and the coffee they didn't bring the sugar. They brought ir like 15 minutes later because we ask for it. The tea cups were dirty and we had to ask the waiter to change them. The only good thing is the cheesecake but the rest a deception."
Maria Teresa R.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,5,2.0,8/7/2017,"DO NOT RECOMMEND  -Rude Service  -Rude Hostess They say customer service is key to the success of any client based establishment & first impressions or customer greetings go a long away. Went on a dinner date with the hubby early Sunday evening called ahead & was told 10-15 minute wait for a table for two. Got a pager & waited & waited & waited several minutes passed & we noticed someone had left their pager behind on the lobby seat & it was going off so we decided to turn it in & be honest about it that though it wasn't ours we wished to turn it in & since we were waiting for a table & whom ever had left that pager behind wasn't going to use the seats could we take their place?? Blonde hostess double checked with another dark haired girl behind the hostess counter to see if it was ok & 2nd girl said NO, mumbled something under her breathe & gave us her back umm O.K. we figured there wasn't much time left to wait on our pager anyways & gave them the benefit of the doubt perhaps it was a table seating larger group whom the pager we turned in belonged to. We waited & waited & waited saw other groups being called, we were so hungry by this point & noticed a couple whom had arrived long time after us called to be seated I couldn't believe this?! I spoke to the blonde hostess again asked for an explanation why was there a hold up on our pager when we already had been waiting 20minutes if not more after double checking our phones on the time & other couples were being called who'd arrived later. She tried double checking our pager to see what happened & apologized for the process, she asked the same Rude dark haired girl with the receding hair line, blue eyes, & brown matte lipstick from last time behind the hostess counter who seemed to be in charge of monitoring the pagers on the computer screen, I asked to know what happened, the dark haired girl just muttered you'll be seated O.K. that didn't answer my question obviously something is either screwed with their system or pagers are falling off the grid, I persisted can you tell me what happened I don't understand earlier we were nice to return a forgotten pager & honest to admit it wasn't ours but request the table paged because we'd already been waiting little over 10 minutes which had been granted was the wait time anyways for us & was blatantly without regard denied & now your dismissing our request for an explanation?! again she replied you'll be seated pursed her lips & gave us her back wOw. I was stunned this was the most disrespectful disregard to clientele satisfaction I've ever experienced, no apology, no B.S. excuse at the least for having dropped the ball & not having called us, no restaurant courtesy compliments for the faux pas plus blatantly rude behavior from the dark haired miserable hostess with receding hairline. Computer error can be easily dismissed, rude miserable attitude towards dining customers??? I don't think so. It's sad that that girl is one of the first things you meet because otherwise the rest of the staff, ambiance, hostesses, servers are totally on pointe on trying to make your dining experience elegant & tasteful, but that dark haired hostess just totally brought the experience to shoot down the drain from the start. (2 stars out of consideration for our wonderful waitress & the blonde hair hostess, she was super nice otherwise this would be 1 star review)."
Heyz E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,30,3.0,8/7/2017,"Having lunch with my family. The place is huge, great ambiance but the service is slow. It takes awhile for the food to arrive. Hope they will improve their service."
Annie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,46,17,1.0,9/2/2017,"I just waited 2 hours to be seated as I was told my wait was going to be 40 minutes. I walked in and approached Monica and asked if I was ever buzzed. She responds by telling me 'No I don't think so, but how many I can seat you now."" No apology, nothing. I look at her and respond ""that's all you have to say?"" She looks at me with a sarcastic face, shrugs her shoulders, brings her hands up & says ""I'm sorry?"" I look at her so shocked and walk out; to only look back and see her laughing which made me furious so I walk in and ask for a manager and again her laughing says ""no problem"" and rings her manager. The manager was super nice  and said she would take care of Monica, don't know how much of that was true but nonetheless she wasn't rude as Monica being just a hostess was under the impression she was manager with the way she was carrying herself. So disgusting, my god."
Amy H.,"Renton, WA",35,53,40,2.0,3/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I were visiting from Washington State, so it was our first time at the Cheesecake Factory in California.  The waiting was fairly short, about five minutes when the restaurant was barely full (6 pm). Waiter took a while to greet us, but we had our menus so we were browsing. We ordered and received our waters. The food arrived fairly quick as well and tasted delicious.  But, the reason for my low review was the service I received from the waiter. We did not receive a napkin until we asked because no one had come by. We got a napkin when we were about 3/4 done with our food. We also did no receive any bread for appetizer. I thought it was just a Washington State tradition so we did not request it. As we were walking out of the restaurant I noticed that only our section of the restaurant with the specific waiter did not receive bread. Service should be the same throughout the restaurant and I feel like receiving napkin and break should be the basis of it.  Also, waiter gave us our check before we were finished with our food and we felt extremely rushed and unwelcomed in the restaurant."
Isela M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,14,5.0,7/27/2017,"We had a great experience, the patio area was very comfortable with the heaters, our server was friendly and attentive, food delicious! Very pleased with this location."
Kawika P.,"Kalaoa, HI",19,58,109,5.0,11/25/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Bistro Shrimp Pasta! Read bad reviews about this location so we were hesitant but decided to go. We had a party of 11 during busy dinner time on Black Friday .  There was a 40 minute wait, we agreed. Seated on time, service was excellent. Our waitress ""Jacqueline M"" was very efficient. Bread on our tables immediately, drink orders done, food was quick and delicious as always. Mahalo for the great experience. This was a first CF experience for a few in our party. Everyone left with smiling faces and full stomachs."
Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,29,32,5.0,10/15/2016,"Tonight we went to the new cheese cake factory in Santa Monica, it was awesome first let me say the Manager Kati Ana was incredible she was so warm and welcoming, checked in on us always was on top of everything! We sat in the back patio that has a great view and seats , the food came our hot and yummy , and my lemon drop martini was the bomb . Best part always is dessert the pumpkin  cheesecake is what my kids wait for so yummy ! We will be back !!"
DEBORAH K.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,17,,4.0,10/24/2017,"Top of the line classic burger!  The greens were good too.  We almost left because of the noise level, but it was worth staying for the food,"
Steve B.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",8,45,1,1.0,9/6/2016,"I know, I know a chain restaurant in a mall....gasp! Still, I like me some factory sometimes.  Everyone knows the food at Cheesecake Factory. (I happen to like it, for the price.) So, my review, however halting, is about this particular location. I have no pride/shame for likin the 'cake. Don't hate. This review is based on brunch at 11:30 on a Sunday. Service: let me get this out of the way, the hostess was great. And then there's this....I'm doing what I dislike so much on yelp, accurately assessing the service when it's dreck. Needless to say, not awesomeness. Had to ask 3 times for our server for basic drinks..3 times. Food items were all about 30 mins late. The worse it got, the more scarce our server was.  Ambiance: great for the mall; we were outside on patio. Food: ordered a couple staples for apps aka spinach dip and Southwest egg rolls. Both were as expected. Entrees: brioche breakfast sammy and chilaquiles, and what appeared to be 2 kids meals. Everything was wrong and cold when it arrived. We even had to ask multiple servers for syrup for the kids French toast . Oh, and they just decided to ignore some components of the order.  Begs the question, why not complain? I don't want to deal with the crap of correcting a crap experience on a nice Sunday morning. Plus, I didn't want to ruin the day for a clearly bad staff and manager. Paying it forward, as they say. If you're in Santa Monica, do not go near here. The one in the Marina is better if you insist. There are better places in Santa Monica."
Tracy F.,"Chattanooga, TN",71,35,261,1.0,3/12/2016,"This was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. We just went in for drinks. We made it clear when our server took our order we were here for drinks only. We chose to sit outside. The weather was a little chilly, so they had outdoor heaters on. It was miserably hot because of the heaters. We ordered our drinks, my usual strawberry martini!  My husband ordered for us while I ran to the restroom. It took 15 minutes to get the drinks. This drink is always the same no matter what Cheesecake Factory you visit. Not this one. I noticed the pink wasn't quite the right shade. It was too light pink. The strawberry on the side was hard and bitter. I guess the ones used to make the drink were the same. I drank it. I mean who wants to throw a drink away. That's  alcohol abuse. But it wasn't good.   Our server never checked on us after the drinks arrived. It took 20 minutes after we finished our drinks to get our check. The bill was near $30. It wasn't worth the price or the time. And we weren't even offered the bread service.  I would probably give it another try because the Cheesecake Factory's strawberry martini has never disappointed me until this one. It was the service that was the true let down. The patio wasn't even busy. There we only 4 other tables being serviced."
