Salomé A.,"Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, CA",12,54,48,5.0,3/20/2017,Cheesecake Factory is always a good idea. I have never been disappointing there !
Jeff g.,"Santa Monica, CA",116,17,2,1.0,9/2/2016,Been a few years since we were there and won't be going back. The food was mediocre at best and the service was sub par to lousy.   I rather not go in to all the details but this place has gone downhill. I wonder if David Overton has got  too big to handle the quality he once demanded.  Next day update: Just got home to grab my leftover slice and the server was so bad that she just threw it in upside down. So sad.
Carla W.,"Bakersfield, CA",132,124,103,5.0,10/30/2016,"This restaurant is ridiculously long & big. Despite that, we had a great visit. I always order the same thing at TCF, chicken/shrimp jambalaya with a extra sauce on the side. We ordered a new-to-us item. Avocado, portabella mushroom and zucchini fries. YUM! I highly recommend it. I also order the same dessert every visit: Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Great service was provided by Haley on the bridge patio."
Brunson S.,"New York, NY",0,3,,5.0,10/20/2017,Iris is the best manager ever! She brings French flair to this factory! She taught me how to say hello and who let the dogs out in French!
Kimmy H.,"Culver City, CA",402,207,2461,5.0,3/11/2016,"We really like this location specifically because of the ambience; it's so spacious (we love the intimate booth seating throughout) and the nice patio w/views of the promenade.  Unfortunately, happy hour is only in the bar area, it was such a beautiful day we set out on the patio. Nonetheless we enjoy cheesecakes food... Tasty and consistent. What cool place to nosh, a couple drinks and be merry.... Of course after shopping til you drop... Enjoy!"
Karen L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",312,677,87,3.0,12/24/2016,This Cheesecake Factory is located in the 3rd Street Promenade so expect lots of tourists. The food is consistently okay. We had club sandwiches yesterday and they were just so boring! The sandwich was very dry and hardly had any turkey or bacon. We like CF but will go to our neighborhood location.
Eurycria A.,"Manila, Philippines",64,41,60,5.0,11/20/2016,They made my 20th birthday over here a very special one! Great ambiance and we were sat right at the terrace where we can see the 3rd street promenade and it was just marvelous how we can people watch and eat! Amazing food amazing customer service and overall a 5 star deal! A definite dinner reservation will be on the way soon!
Briana W.,"Spring Valley, CA",550,2,,1.0,4/18/2017,"I left here and never want to return. I sat at the bar and Sal was my bartender and he was terrible. Everything I asked him was a slow struggle for him there was no sense of urgency nor did I feel like he wanted to serve/bartend which is crazy because You never know who is going to tip you well or if your dealing with a shopper. Tuesday at 3:45 super slow I was the only person at the bar and he made me feel like he didn't want to be there nor did he make me feel like I wanted to be there, being promoted to the bar is a privilege not everyone gets that opportunity. I have never felt unwanted at a restaurant that I am paying and tipping well at. One hundred percent zero stars if I could."
Simeko C.,"El Cajon, CA",12,62,83,3.0,4/20/2017,"The cheesecake factory is always good because there's something on the menu for everyone. However, when planning to go to the cheesecake factory make sure that you were prepared to wait because there's always a long line for the most part. From time to time, I still find myself dining and enjoying the cheesecake factory."
Maryanne E.,"Upland, CA",18,23,40,5.0,11/4/2016,Ryan S was the best! Loved the Cheesecake Factory ... It's so big and so pretty. We came for awesome dessert and we were pleased as we knew we would be. Thank
Amber W.,"Tauranga, New Zealand",3,13,2,3.0,6/13/2017,"Good food, good server. We got a nice spot  outside in the sun and it suited that day. Wouldn't rush back purely because it's not really somewhere I'd frequent and the greeter was a bit rude.  I find The Cheesecake Factory same same but different location and all a bit ho-hum."
Howe T.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,1,1,1.0,3/23/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but I have been at the Santa Monica location 3 time, twice I have been disappointed both times. The Service is horrible, the food quality and quantity is the worst. My advice is go to another location, you will save yourself the headache!!!!"
Reuben S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,28,4,2.0,8/20/2016,"Bad service, and too expensive. Had to ask for bread after meal arrived, was never offered to us. Coffee arrived without sugar, had to wait and catch a waiter to ask for some. Desert arrived without fork or spoons, had to reuse my coffee spoon."
Alina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,63,,3.0,7/15/2017,"I am very picky when it comes to food and pasta but salute to the chefs whoever make my spag meatballs or pasta napoletana their the best pasta ever .ambiance is good but sometimes hostess are not attentive except for d curly tanned host she's f only one who works w class d rest I'm sorry ..number 2 this place could be better except for d Manager Adriana .shes not a good Manager at all.from communicating w d guest she was never part of d solution .A manager should be polite and emphasizing to a customer .all I'm saying is Santa Monica is a decent place so I wish they will upgrade their game but never d less my server David not sure of his last name he have that brown eyes curly hair he is very calm attentive and passionate w the guests pls promote him , he is very neat and nice"
Jessica T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,33,3,5.0,6/17/2017,"Our service was excellent. It was a busy Friday night and the staff handled the crowd really well. Food tasted great. We were full, so we took Cheesecake to-go. Probably eating it for breakfast!   Ha!"
Curtis B.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,101,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"The worst.  Let me repeat the worst.  I honestly live right  across the street.  Like right across the street.  Like right across the street.  They are terrible and terribly managed.  I try to give them a magic Johnson fast break layup order for pickup for 9 people.  They won't even take my order because they bakery is to busy.  I ordered four weeks ago for my wife and son, same idiotic respond.  Like grow up as a company. Maybe hire people who work. Btw I was forced to eat there four months ago too, it's 2017 get wireless."
Michele B.,"Plano, TX",30,27,10,1.0,3/4/2017,If I could leave a review with a negative star I would.... the food was fabulous the first waiter was phenomenal but then she switched with another waiter and we got our check paid and were waiting for the elevator to leave and I'll be Damed if the waiter didn't come chase me and ACCUSE ME OF STEALING HIS PEN.... to the point that I opened my purse to show him the inside.... seriously dude!!! Another less than stellar visit to the Cheesecake Factory!!! When will I learn?
Monica T.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,32,37,4.0,5/21/2017,Hanging around the Santa Monica Promenade and my family and I decided to eat here. 30+ minute wait after 8:30pm on a Sunday night. The wait was extremely long for us to get our food but the customer service Molly R provided us was worth the wait. We bugged her so much and she kept a great attitude. That made our evening better so we gave her a generous tip. Thanks!
Jing F.,"Mountain View, CA",867,426,1192,1.0,7/9/2016,I normally don't review before I get my food but this is terrible. ..the service totally sucks...the group next to us who came in 15 mins later got their orders and almost done with their food :(...not sure what's happening but I'm ready to eat them with my words..shhsh..I'm usually a cool chic and normally don't complain but this is unacceptable. ..uggh..don't go here
Romayo S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/2/2016,"Utter disappointment.  We went to the new cheesecake location at Santa Monica place a few days ago for a weekday lunch  We ordered the Luau salad, chicken scampi pasta, sweet corn tamales and a BBQ chicken pizza. This is our go to order, we have ordered this many times before at other cheesecake locations.  1. The waitress, Rochelle? Michelle? Rachel?, was so soft spoken we couldn't even hear her name. When we ordered the pasta dish, she asked us to specifically point out the name because it seemed as if we were describing a dish, not ordering one. Aren't the staff supposed to memorize the menu?  2. We got the bread, which was warm and tasty like other locations. Then the food came out, after a seemingly longer than usual wait and the waitress took away the rest of our bread. WTF.  3. The food was not that hot, if anything lukewarm. The salad was anemic. See side by side pic for the luau salad we had at the Newport Beach location in November vs the one we had in Santa Monica. Where is the salad part? Seriously it was all wonton skin. And no, it's not the lunch version because there is no lunch version on the menu.  4. The pasta. We cut into the chicken and it was raw. Not pink verging on cooked, but RAW. So we flagged the waitress and she had them fire a new one. In the meantime we finished the rest of our food, another waitress tried taking our plates, even though we were still waiting for the pasta. Finally what it seemed like the manager in red came over with a new pasta, asking us to see if the pasta is to our liking. It's not that we were picky about the taste, we were bothered by the fact that it was raw and risks bearing disease. Anyway yes, the chicken was finally cooked. But now there was an issue with the taste of the pasta. The sauce was not cooked all the way through, just tasted like cream and raw garlic. At least with the first pasta, the sauce was an actual scampi. Midway through this pasta, another waiter brought out another chicken scampi dish, even though we already got one.  5. We were so sick of this place that we didn't even order a cheesecake. We thought we would at least get comped the pasta dish because we had to wait again for another one that was subpar to begin with. But nope. We were ""comped"" for the second pasta dish that was brought out by mistake.  All in all, throughly disappointing. Terrible representation of the brand, and of the locale. Luckily tourists will surely let it thrive. Next time you are at the promenade go to any other place to eat, seriously."
