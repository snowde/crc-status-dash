Tara M.,"Emeryville, CA",301,1,1,1.0,7/20/2016,Received my Long Island Iced Tea with a fly resting at the bottom. To say I was disgusted would be an understatement. I will not be coming back.
Nicole K.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",0,9,2,1.0,7/11/2017,Worst service ever. Seriously the hostess Kenya had the worst attitude. We have been waiting for thirty minutes and hey called us up to take our table and then left us at the hostess stand for thirty minutes while she sat everyone in front of us. I would never come back here again. I'm sure they don't care about us or how we felt it was obvious but I suggest never coming here. Go to Johnny Rockets. It'll be a better experience.
Tatiana N.,"Santa Monica, CA",204,202,405,5.0,12/5/2015,"I'm puzzled as to why the reviews are so bad. As an SM local I was happy to see this beautiful new Cheesecake in the city. I was mostly taken aback by its grandeur -- very nice date place, and its huge. Adrian (I think) was our waiter and he was kind. Its tough though, because big location = lots of servers running with their heads cut off because = lots of mouth to feed = you'll have to wait sometimes. But eating is not just about food, right? If you're in good company, its really also the conversation. (Ie = if you are starving, likely do not come here, lol, although wait wasnt horrible). They didn't have my fav sourdough bread at first but Adrian ended up getting it for us. All of our food was great and kept up the Cheesecake standards."
Zach F.,"Moorpark, CA",1,6,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"My girlfriend and I went there for brunch. Absolutely horrible service and the food was even worse. My girlfriends food came out 15 minutes before mine and the manager noticed and offered a free piece of cheesecake. WE ARE EATING BREAKFAST. Who wants cheese cake after eating eggs? The bill was $53 for two people, we will never be back. If I were you I would go across the street to eat at a place called Cafe Crepe. Way better service and food."
Peter P.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,5,4,4.0,7/17/2016,"As soon as my cousins and I walked in the hostess was not that welcome and told us which was a 20 minute wait which we decided to wait for. However our waiter(not sure of name) was absolutely professional. He checked up on us very often and gave us great recommendations. I ordered the four cheese pasta which was very delicious. After, being stuffed we decided to get cheesecake because that is what they are know for. We got the red velvet and salted caramel cheesecakes and Oh My God it was the best cheesecake I have ever had. It was the type of food where your in a commercial to act like how good the food was but in this case we were not acting. Overall I would recommend people to this place if you have 2 hours to eat and are looking for an amazing cheesecake."
Belinda C.,"Homestead, FL",6,7,,3.0,4/13/2017,"I usually eat in Cheesecake Factory and today we came to Santa Monica and decided to eat here, the waiter has a really nasty actitud and like if we never ate here ; he told us that the bread that the restaurant serve while you wait for food, was given up to request."
Marissa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,15,46,3.0,11/16/2015,Their cheesecakes are the best ! Got the banana one which I love !  Food is alright buy always comes in pretty big portions .
Elizabeth S.,"Tarzana, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/4/2017,Worst service: the waitress was rude and when we asked her something nicely because the kids were super hungry after 40 minutes she smiled and as she walked away said that we don't have to give her attitude. We were so patient with her but then we asked the manager that she won't service our table. We were shocked that they did nothing to remedy our experience! First time in our life We left $0 for tip.
Elaine C.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,18,9,3.0,6/5/2016,"Always YUMMY with AWFUL customer service......ALWAYS. Ordered for appetizers: *Crab Wontons - 5/5 *Calamari - 5/5 Main course: *Steak Diane...shrunk?!?! Steak used to be larger. Ordered it well done but was served medium! Salmon also bland this time around. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were perfect. Overall 3/5 *Three shrimp soft taco combo. Was sadly dry. Rice was tasty! The tacos looked like they had a generous amount of shrimp but really it was all an illusion because they were sitting on mostly lettuce, it was ridiculous! Wasn't given salsa, had to ask. The salsa was super salty though. 3/5 Desert: * White chocolate macadamia ....divine...5/5 Waiter service - 5/5. He was nice and attentive. Took almost 30 mins to get out our main course because no one covered him when he went on his break. But, still he tried his best. Hostess - 0/5!!!!!!! ALWAYS!!!!! Attn Management: We come here often ( at least several times a month) and it's always the same old story.... Great food, unfriendly hostess. Our hostess was very rude and unaccommodating, she lacked good customer service, the majority of them do. It's always the people leading you to your seat who seem to have the biggest issues in their life. ALWAYS! If you're not happy, please go somewhere else and stop trying to project you're misery unto others! Seriously, you need better management and supervisors to keep your subpar employees in line. How your customers are treated is unacceptable, read the other comments. Something needs to change. Also, the restrooms are always dirty."
Theodore C.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,129,1171,4.0,1/8/2016,It's a cool place. Its new and the happy hour menu is the best in the city. The service if good but they need work on The art of turning over tables.....
M O.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,40,2,1.0,6/2/2016,"Terrible customer service -- will never return: I went to this Cheesecake Factory location in Santa Monica Place on a quiet weekday around 4:30pm because I wanted to check it out, and happened to be in a pasta + cheesecake mood. From the get-go, the ""greeter"" gave me an attitude. The place was not even half full, but the greeter wanted to place (hide) me at the edge of the bar, when I was looking for something more comfortable, like a 2-person booth. She pursed her lips, and told me that it would not be possible for a quite a while -- even though there was plenty of available tables/booths. I may not be young and hip, but I dress trendy and elegantly, and she had no grounds treating me the way she did.   I really didn't appreciate her attitude, so I left, and went to enjoy my pasta + cheesecake in a neighborhood bistro that understands customer service, and the benefits of caring for local/return customers. This unfortunate experience reminded me why we usually avoid Downtown Santa Monica, even though we live locally. Places like this Cheesecake Factory cater essentially for tourists vs. locals, and don't care about ongoing business."
Lisa D.,"Monterey Park, CA",237,90,281,4.0,8/29/2016,"They always have long lines around dinner time.  We sat outside, and it was really nice.  I would recommend their loaded tater tots!  They are really good and crispy.  I tried the avocado egg rolls for the first time here.  It was pretty good, but I wouldn't say I would actually get it again.  But it's definitely something new to try."
Sara P.,"Santa Monica, CA",27,27,6,2.0,11/21/2015,"I realize this location is new, so I will happily change my review if I happen to go again and have a better experience. But seeing as this is the second time I've gone since they opened, I decided to write a review this time.  The Restsurant was very busy, as it was a Saturday afternoon, so I'll give them an extra star for that. But seeing as every person on our table of 8 had something wrong with their order, the kitchen needs to get themselves together.  I ordered a burger, pretty simple, I figured it was a safe bet. This burger didn't come with lettuce, so I asked if they could put some on, no problem! (By the way, our server was very nice, my problem was with the kitchen.) So, the burger comes with the choice of a wheat bun, which I chose, but when I got it, 1) no lettuce, and 2) it was on a roll, like they give you in the basket when you sit down. I ignored the roll part but did ask for some lettuce. When I got it, I realized there was only tomatoes and cheese on one half of the ""roll"" I wouldn't call it a burger. And the other side just had meat, lettuce and a bun.  My brother in laws sandwich was missing the sauce, my father in laws salad didn't come with dressing, and my mother in laws didn't have the right one. The only meals that came out fine were the kids meal 1/2 pizzas, however it was one pizza that they made together (makes sense), but they didn't put it on 2 separate plates for the 2 separate kids.  Overall we were there for almost 2 hours.  Our family was in town visiting and had never been to Cheesecake Factory.  We had convinced them to come because we've had excellent experiences at the one in Marina Del Rey, but they left very disappointed. As did we.  We live a few blocks away, so I'm sure in time we will try this location again at some point. Hopefully they can get their act together."
Andrew P.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,3,,1.0,5/26/2017,"worst experience ever. never left review on yelp despite being almost 10 year user. the service here is dismal. unless they revamp the whole place with new management, stay away. it's a shame that cheesecake factory is run like this"
Emily M.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,11,,2.0,5/24/2017,"We came in for our anniversary dinner. Our server seemed very disinterested, and we had to flag him down for everything. It took a really long time each time for him to come to our table.  It took a REALLY long time for food to come, the kids were languishing from hunger. When I finally flagged our server down, he thought we wanted the appetizers to come with our food. Why would we want that?! After a horribly long time the food finally came. It was fine, fairly standard stuff, tasty but not extraordinary. It took a really long time for our server to refill our drinks. We wanted to take some stuff home and he brought us boxes (but I noticed that he packed other people's leftovers - not sure why there was a double standard). We ordered some banana cream pie but they brought us a lemon. When I told our server he was dubious (dude, I know what lemon tastes like) but took it back and brought us the right one. The service sucks. We like coming to Santa Monica to walk around, but at this point we'll just go to a Cheesecake Factory closer to us. AVOID IF YOU CAN."
Steven L.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,16,,2.0,2/8/2017,"Love the location of this restaurant, but that's about it. I've waited two months to give this review. I messaged them on their website with my complaints and never received any kind of message back. The service the last few times has been really bad.  In December I went with friends and one of my friends had to wait 20 minutes to get her salad dressing. Another friend also had to wait 20 minutes to get their fries. 4 of the 5 orders were incorrect. Just an overall disappointment. Especially since they never got back to me via email or telephone."
Edison L.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,1.0,2/23/2017,"For first time we went here. after 55 minutes they give us very bad place to sit. food came after 30 minutes but food was uncooked!!! we asked for straws, she bring only one PC! food was very bad i wish i can give NO star not even one star."
Katie S.,"Valencia, CA",0,25,7,5.0,3/11/2016,"Great service, great food, squeaky clean bathrooms = 5 stars from me. My cousin and I ordered the Lemon Garlic Shrimp Pasta and it's amazing as always! My dad ordered a salad; he asked for the salad dressing on the side and came out like so. So thank you for doing that! Many restaurants fail to complete this simple favor.  We ate on the patio and the ambience is really nice! Scenery of the promenade was very relaxing and it was sunny and people having good conversation and music was nice too. Just happy vibes everywhere. I will definitely be back! Perfect for a date. :))"
Louella D.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,65,751,1.0,5/12/2016,"WORST experience ever! I love going to this CF, my boyfriend and I were actuality excited to check out this new location. It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon,  our day was going great and we were looking forward to having a good lunch. When we walked in things were going good, we got seated really quickly, but that all changed as soon as we got seated. Our server came introduced herself and asked if we wanted anything to drink. Things that went wrong: 1. Dirty silverware  2. Our server magically disappeared 3. It took 45mins to order 4. It took almost 30mins to bring out our food Yeah this was the unfortunately the first and our last time at this location"
Tara K.,"Ventura, CA",1,21,32,1.0,5/22/2017,"Horrible! Three of us went to dinner , got some drinks and appetizers. Everything was fine . It's s prime location and the roof top view was unbeatable. However , that's the only positive thing about our experience . We ordered our food and the wait was over an hour. A manager came by to apologize. No big deal . Finally the food arrives for two of us. My food however did not arrive for another half an hour. When it did finally arrive brought by Katya , it was a well done New York steak  , I ordered a medium rare rib eye. Katya tried to argue that the New York was basically the same as a rib eye , not to mind the $10 price difference . Umm no , I want what I ordered and a New York is for sure not a Rib Eye. So I had to wait again for another 15 minutes while she brought another steak , a rib eye , medium well. They tried to tell me that the steak was rare because the red lights from the outside patio was making it look red. I used the light on my phone to show everyone it was mot pink at all . Either way a steak no matter how done or rare should not be tuff and flavorless like this steak was . Even the waiter agreed with me about the steak and couldn't believe Katya spoke to me the way she did. Especially for being a manager. The way she spoke to was condescending and rude and basically made me feel like I was crazy. I am in the service industry and I know how annoying costumers can be , and I was totally not being unreasonable . I just wanted a nice rib eye steak medium rare. Instead I got a free piece of cheesecake but no dinner and I had to send my meal back twice and waited over an hour and a half. I will never go back here. I hope corporate takes a look at the yelp reviews and 2.5 stars for this place and hires some professionals to come in and take over the management . They really have an issue with training . Katya is offensive and should not be dealing with customers at all . She lacks the knowledge of what a steak is and lacks the ability to handle issues with customers in a professional manner."
