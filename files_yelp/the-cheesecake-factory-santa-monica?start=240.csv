Conner E.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/8/2017,"This place.... just no. This review is strictly for picking up food for takeout. I work close by and like to go here and pick up a salad for lunch. Every time I call to order my food i am on hold for at least 5-7 minutes. I have had to hang up and call back multiple times. When you finally get an order placed, the time it takes to prepare your food is pretty average. But when you go to pick up your food, if it is slow, no one is at the food pick up counter.  You have to go to the other hostess stand and ask them to call someone. When they do, it is never quick. I have waiting up to 10 minutes before between the time they called someone to come over and when someone actually arrived. And the restaurant wasn't even busy! The food is good and when you finally get some service the employees are very polite, but the customer service speed is so bad that it is not even worth the hassle of trying to place an order."
Lauren M.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,14,10,3.0,3/12/2017,"I came here on a Sunday night and I could say it was very crowded here! I came with 3 of my friends, so we had around a 40ish minute wait (which is understandable, due to the crowdedness). We got seated outside with a nice view, but it was super cold. Good thing there was the outdoor heaters. We were quick to order, and this is where it somewhat goes downhill. We waited around 45 minutes for our food. My food was alright: there was some random pasta in my food. My dish contains penne pasta, but there were like two bow-tie pasta and random spaghetti string pasta. My two other friends had the same situation like me. We were a bit suspicious about it, but it was okay."
Jason D.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,33,74,1.0,5/1/2016,I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory franchise and have eating at several location.  However on this occasion at the Santa Monica location guest service is lacking.    We were handed dirty silverware to eat with and after being sat down at our table it took over 30-40min just to put in an order with a waiter that was waiting on another table next to use.    Then after an hour from the time we checked in (On Yelp) and we still didn't have receive our food i had to track someone down to speak with a manager.   I see why this place only has 2 1/2 stars.  It not what anyone would expect from the Cheesecake Factory chain.  This location need a lot more training in customer service.
Evelyn H.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,3,,5.0,1/30/2017,I want to thank our server Manuel in Cheesecake Factory Santa Monica. We had Salmon with rosted herb and mash potato plus pasta with vegetables
Nicole V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",69,30,6,1.0,6/14/2016,"Such a bad experience. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon to enjoy a meal with my mom and niece.  We were so excited because we love the restaurant in general. But our presence was not welcomed. We had a ""waiter"" named Connor who seemed to bring his baggage to work. He was very distant and hardly interacting with us. Literally took our order, brought the water, and came back with our bill. When we asked him for my nieces apple juice that came with the meal that she did not receive he got angry and defensive stating that we didn't tell him we wanted it. What happened to ""sorry about that mam, I'll bring out the juice right now"" instead he stood around for a minute chatting to another waiter. Im a manager in customer service and I would be upset to see my employees talking this way to customers. We received ""more help"" from other waiters walking by vs Connor. When we let the food runner know we were splitting our plate he said ""ok"" and walked away. No extra plate?  If you want a nice dining experience do not go here. 30 bucks I could have spent to make a meal at home and be treated with respect. We didn't even stay for dessert. We took our service elsewhere. I'm unsure if this restaurant is for trainees but it seemed like everyone was just hanging out at the registers vs engaging with their customers.  This place needs Gordon Ramsey from kitchen nightmares."
Jeroen D.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,121,6,1.0,5/7/2016,"The steak cheese sandwich had no taste whatsoever. That's an achievement! How is it possible to get to a completely neutral bland taste if you have so many ingredients?  Secondly, why is the music so loud? If I want to hear music, I'll put on my headphones. No need to ruin the experience with Adele whining through the speakers at 300% volume (she annoys the hell out of me at 3% already)."
Liz A.,"Santa Monica, CA",425,129,29,5.0,2/5/2017,"Ok so I was reluctant to come to a chain restaurant but it's my first time here and I am blown away by the delicious brown bread, the YUMMY asian pear martini, the sweet corn tamale cakes (SO GOOD), then I ordered the combo plate with salmon and shrimp that came with mashed potatoes and I substituted broccoli for the asparagus. Everything was AMAZE BALLS!! Sorry forgot to take a pic!!"
Donya A.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,19,,2.0,5/29/2017,"Came here for a dinner with some close friends. The wait to get seated was so long and the service was really slow! It was the only place open after 9 or 10 pm, so definitely a last resort! The food was not bad, but not worth the time that we waited to get seated."
Dan A.,"Calabasas, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2017,By far the worst cheesake factory ever. All the food that was ordered was cold. It took more than an hour to get the food. Did not reorder the food as I could not wait another hour to recieve the food.  After finally recieving the food and leaving the very unpolite hostees is standing by the elevator saying it's closed when it wasn't even 8pm. Decide to take the stairs and they are absolutely disgusting. Cigarette buts and other trash all over the staircase. For sure will not come to this cheesecake factory again and absolutely do not recommend it. If I could I would rate this cheesecake factory 0 stars
Kiana M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",7,3,,1.0,2/19/2017,"The service was horrible and they said we would be seated in 15 minutes but we ended up waiting for one hour. They told us someone took our seats so we waited extra minutes for no reason. Bottom line, they are disorganized and un-professional. Would not recommend coming to the Cheesecake Factory in Santa Monica."
Alexis R.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,8,2,5.0,10/27/2015,"Opening day!  Place looks like every other location, nice sized and same decor. Perfect for the Santa Monica Place. Definitely what it's been missing since every other establishment has closed down.  Sat at the bar and was instantly greeted by Andrea. I had my usual, BBQ Chicken salad, and glass of Pino Grigio (happy hour can never steer you wrong!)  Awesome and quick service. Food tasted as it should. Andrea was a pleasure to talk to. I had a perfect spot right in front of the TV to watch NBA opening day games, so I can't complain.  You would never know this was their first day to the public. Will definitely be back again."
Calvin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,13,,4.0,7/18/2016,"I didn't have the experience that everyone else seems to be having with the terrible customer service. Although the worker at the welcome desk did not seem friendly or nice. Our waitress was really good. We went around 9:40pm, seated at 10pm. But another reviewer was right, no1 usually comes to a restaurant with avg reviews of less than 3 stars Food- It is good but nothing over the top since this is the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake and chicken and shrimp gumbo. Everyone liked their food except 1 friend ordered a pasta dish that was really bland. Don't remember the name of it.  Price- decent restaurant price. Cheesecakes are expensive but it's like a 1 time order so whatever. I spent 34$ with tax and tip for those ^^^^^ Customer service- our waitress Chelsea was really nice and attentive and kept refilling our bread and water, got the orders right and was fast. Best part of meal Venue- the place looks super nice and upscale. Bathrooms would look the same if they cleaned them often but there was stuff like gum in the sink, full trash can, etc. The utensils seemed old and somewhat not clean but idk if that's the texture of the metal or calcified food... Crowd- it does get crowded and everyone looks well dressed unlike us who just had a roadtrip for 14 hours. Oops"
Parker G.,"Los Angeles, CA",312,121,119,4.0,12/6/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is such a fun and inviting atmosphere!  I love coming here for dates, it has the feel of an upscale restaurant without the accompanying rigidness and uptight feel.  I don't understand the complaints that I see on here, I've never experienced anything but excellent service and food from this location.  Inside, the aura is dim and romantic, while the seating outside has lovely views of the promenade and his very well heated.  The servers here have all always been very accommodating and sweet, I love so many of them!  They helped my boyfriend surprise me on my birthday with some free cake.  The menu is HUGE, and has a vast array of options, all of which are delicious!  Loses a star only because many of the items on the menu seem rather overpriced.  This isn't a gourmet restaurant.  They're nice, but I wish they wouldn't act like they're so fancy.  Still, I love the atmosphere and the food here!  And the staff are always so friendly and sweet.  An excellent choice for dinner by the promenade."
Amit C.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",51,62,42,1.0,10/21/2016,"I have family here from israel and decided to choose this location and drive about 45 minutes from the valley. We arrived approx at 745 pm and were told to wait about 15, minutes or so, after seating down at 8pm we were approached by a server who introduced himself but failed to take any drinks orders, he said he will be back.  About 10 to 15 minutes later the server came and took our drink order and food order. we then waited 15 minutes to get the drinks which is unacceptable. The drinks came at 830 and as he placed them on the table he spilled the skinny margarita on me, the guy felt so bad I told him not to worry and dried myself off, at this point I'm a little upset it took 30 min to get drinks and no appetizers. Roughly 10'to 15 min later we received my drink and had to wait a few more min for appetizers which was unacceptable. I then asked about the food and received it around 850 approx , the steak and burger were asked to be medium rare but both came well done, when I asked the manager how they look he said well done and took them to be replaced. Meanwhile we had to wait till about 915 to get the food at that point I was starving and even thought the steak now came cold I just ate it. Also forgot to mention had to send my drink back 2 or three times as it was made incorrectly, also we asked for napkins and Parmesan cheese about 3 times. When we got the bill the manager refused to take the steak off because he said I ate it.. I told him it was cold and he started trying to negotiate with me, this was so embarrassing, he then said he will give me 50 percent off which was unacceptable, when I refused he said ok I'll take the steak off but add the 50 percent back, this isn't let's make a deal!! You guys clearly messed up spilled an alcoholic drink on me and now want me to pay?? I left 45$ on the table and walked out with my family.  Note the manager twice said we are a new store we only been here for a year.. I'm sorry but that's not acceptable, I was so nice about the drink spilling on me didn't make a big deal at all about it but the fact that I was treated that way was very Embarrassing especially around my family who is visiting here from israel."
Annoe A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,24,14,5.0,8/15/2016,Omg it's a cheesecake's paradise. For cheesecakes lovers. It's so delicious cake here and pasta. Nice roof top view patio.
Christie M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",3,12,7,2.0,5/22/2016,"I wish I could give Cheesecake a better review. This was a takeout order. I liked the salmon kale salad my husband got. But the chicken lettuce cups I ordered arrived without chicken....Um...really? Isn't that a main ingredient? So I called to ask for a reimbursement,  and was told that they'd get back to me....Monica did not apologize for the mess up. She simply told me there was nothing she could do and that someone would cell me when they weren't busy...SAD"
Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4213,331,209,4.0,3/23/2016,The food selection and the food is excellent. It takes a while to get seated because the restaurant is so busy and it took 10 minutes after we were seated for the waiter to get to us. Great location and place to eat if you are not in a hurry.
Maria Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,12,4,3.0,7/19/2016,"I visited this place only once and it was not very good experience. We reserved table outside, but it turned out to be under scorching sun. All this fuss with tables took about 20 min and finally they found a place for us inside.  About meal - everything was OK. We ordered chicken with mushed potatoes, some rice, vegetables and something else. The portions were quite large Oh, and I almost forgot to tell about the dirty utensils. The restaurant should carefully monitor the cleanliness of tableware. So, I put 3 stars only because of delicious food and a good waitress. Actually they deserve 2"
Darian H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,5,1.0,12/20/2016,"We sat. Waited. Ordered was very specific about what we wanted. Waiter brought the wrong drink. Appetizer came out but without the ranch. Asked for it again, nothing. I had to get up and walk into the kitchen area to ask someone to give me a side of ranch. Waiter saw me asked if something was wrong I told her my appetizer is getting cold because I didn't get my dipping sauce as requested. She go get it and the correct drink and her excuse was that the ranch was in the back. We have been here for over an hour and still didn't get our food. Food came, BUT my husband's food didn't. The manager came and stated his food was burnt and will need to make another plate. We will not be paying for his meal. Please don't come here. We definitely will not be returning."
Ingrid G.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/30/2016,"This place is huge, that's probably why there are no lines, it can accommodate everyone. We wear six people in a party. Each ordered different dish. I would recommend ordering appetizers, because main dish seems like it takes a little bit longer to come to the table. We didn't experience any problems with waitresses or hostess. When we got the food... OMG, it was delicious and tasted really fresh. The portions were huge.  I am going there tomorrow and  bringing all my family, because I know I will have a fantastic dinner."
