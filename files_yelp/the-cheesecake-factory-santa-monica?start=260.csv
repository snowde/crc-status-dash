Jerry K.,"Alameda, CA",187,20,14,5.0,10/7/2016,"I've been a customer of this company for sometime now over the years. Not a frequent visitor, but occasionally, nothing outstanding or terrible. This occasion however, actually stood out and wanted to take the time to give credit where it's due. While waiting for our food, which I didn't even think was long, the manager came out just to apologize for the wait time. I simply replied it was no problem at all. That simple acknowledgement made me take time to give Cheesecake Factory a 5 stars. Sometimes, it's the simple things. Waiter was fantastic as well!"
Chase G.,"Castro Valley, CA",34,2,,5.0,12/24/2016,"I can't believe people are giving this restaurant less than 4 stars! This is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in Southern California. There's rooftop sitting, the food is phenomenal, and the atmosphere is amazingly lively! The location is great, because it's close to the Santa Monica Pier & main strip, so there's plenty to do before and/or after you eat. The air is filled with laughter, chatter, and friendly yelling! I love it! Not only that, but the food is amazing & very reasonably priced! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Cheescake Factory if you're in the area. I had one of their Smokehouse BBQ Burgers with bacon...absolutely amazing....just amazing.....I would give more than 5 stars if I could."
Carmen M.,"Manhattan, NY",111,128,354,1.0,3/19/2016,"O. M. G. Service was great but seriously... That menu is a disaster. Anyone who knows about food knows it's a operational nightmare to keep a kitchen stocked with all the menu items meaning you're destined for something frozen, reheated or soggy. And that's what we got.  Ordering everything on the menu - some were ok some bad. I had the shrimp pasta with soggy sour tomato with it.  Mojitos were good. Come for the mojitos - then Leave."
Johnny X.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/12/2016,"Came last night since only a few restaurants were open at 9pm. 1. Waited for service - 15min (no one came, few customers, but she was ""very busy"") 2. Ordered hot tea - no pot (should have), just a cup  3. ""Signature"" bread - upon request 4. To go box - did it ourselves where other cheesecake factories always do this for ""you""(again, she was ""very busy"") 5. Attitude - average (not in a good way) Conclusion:  Worst experience ever. This cheesecake factory seems not here for business and no training for at least, ""our waitress."" I will go to the food court or any other restaurant around next time. Absolutely will NOT come again."
Jennifer F.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,15,,2.0,2/5/2017,"I really want to like this place; after all, I had waited 3 years for it to open after the Wilshire and Barrington location closed.  But overall, dining here is disappointing.   The waitresses are friendly and they try to be helpful, but the quality of the food is not what it is in other locations.  Tonight, my pizza was burned.   And after I gave my 3 eslice of joy coupons to the waitress for free cheesecake, she came back to say that she had given them back to me and wanted 3 more.  But I came in with 8 coupons and I only had 5 left, so I said she must have them after all.  She found them after all. The french fries were too salty.  They said they had pancakes but didn't, so my other child ate the burned pizza instead.  My Cobb salad was good.  But after we left, I found myself wondering why anyone would pay $75 for the meal that we had.  Luckily the cheesecake was free, but still.............Given the wait time and the disappointing food quality, I'll wait a while before I come back. The good thing is that I was able to pay and swipe my parking ticket before the 90 minutes was up so I didn't have to pay $1.25 for the parking. When they opened originally, they had made some errors on my order and promised to mail me a $25 gift card.  They never did.  I guessed that they were busy, just opening up in this new location, so I didn't pursue the matter. I just wish they were better.  My mother didn't want to come back when I offered to take her to The Cheesecake Factory on her last visit here."
Robert W.,"Santa Monica, CA",361,25,17,3.0,4/14/2016,Got the chicken tacos they were tasty - no wait but we were here on an off lunch time.  My friend got spicy chicken sandwhich and said it was tasty -- we are both full now!
Michael M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",80,108,63,1.0,4/8/2017,"Worst run cheesecake in the world literally.  First they lie to you about the wait tell you 15 to 20 ..its more like 30 to 49 then they make you wait like you're at your doctors office for the hostess to seat you ... honestly your food will never get there your server won't make eye contact with anyone because she's over run the amazing 1 basket if bread may arrive during your stay .. just before you lose it ... I've been going to this restaurant since I was a teen in marina del ray in the 90 s ..THIS PLACE SUCKS. I travel from LA to N.Y. to Miami regularly and will never come here and may start avoiding them elsewhere after this. Finally got our food .. fries stale .. meat dry, they sent out an app that looked ridiculous .the food runner was even laughing like at heck am I giving you... sad sad sad .. oh and if this is manager reading this ... you should be ashamed of yourself ..or hire help"
Marcin M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,17,2,1.0,11/28/2016,It hurts to put such a bad rating because I love cheese cake factory. First they said the wait was 10-15 minutes for inside. When we approached the bar the waitress said you can sit here and get service right away. It took 10 min to get silverwear then another 10 min for her to give us the menu and then another 5 minutes to get waters. It was really bad service from the beginning. We ordered a appetizer and 20 minutes went by and i knew something was wrong. When I asked the waitress she admitted she forgot to put in the order . The food was amazing as always but this experience was awful.
Jon P.,"Manhattan, NY",188,100,52,4.0,4/3/2016,"Great location at the end of the 3rd street promenade. I gotta say I'm really happy with having the addition of the Cheesecake Factory on this side of town because of their delicious food and affordable prices right by the beach. Before you over indulge on that amazing brown bread and ranch dressing (if you haven't tried this, try it. You'll thank me later), try the BBQ ranch chicken salad or the chipotle chicken pasta. The salad is crisp and fresh and comes with homemade onion rings on top. The pasta is creamy with a smokey flavor and crunchy tortilla strips mixed in. To be honest, you can't go wrong with anything here! I also love the miso salmon and avocado egg rolls. Can't wait to come back to this location!"
William R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/10/2016,If you want to waste money on terrible service then this is your place. Stay away. Don't come here. Is this long enough Yelp?
Briana S.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/12/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE. I came with my parents for my mother's birthday. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated. Our buzzer went off for our table, and we asked our waiter to take our drinks to our table. Our new server named LINDSEY, came up to our table and we asked if she could send our drinks to our table, and I swear her response was like we asked her what the cure for cancer was. She told us to give her a few minutes to ""figure out the situation""... so we waited... and waited... THIRTY MINUTES PASS BY and still no drinks. Like how hard is it to get us our drinks?! She didn't even check In with us to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else, yet she was happily serving other tables next to us. But it gets better. One of the food runners delivered our drinks and accidentally placed the beer in front of me instead of my dad, and me and my mom were busy taking pictures to notice. LINDSEY comes up and scolds myself and my parents for allowing ""kids"" to take sips of ""adult"" beverages and told me that I could get her in trouble with her manager. After I told her that I didn't even TOUCH that beer, she still insisted on giving me and my family an earful about ""kids"" and these ""adult beverages"". LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IM TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD MYSELF. Who the hell she was calling a ""kid"" I have NO IDEA. Absolutely insulted and angered by our rude waitress, she avoids our table altogether. We order cheesecake, yet she can't even give our table some bread? When we asked her for bread, she acted like I had no business asking her ass for bread. We have NEVER had such horrible service from Cheesecake Factory, and the fact that they allow their workers to be absolutely disrespectful is shameful on their part. Whoever the manager is, you should be ashamed of yourself for hiring such an atrocity as a waitress. We will NEVER be wasting our money at this place again."
Adriana A.,"Redlands, CA",0,3,1,5.0,4/12/2016,"Why 5 stars? Love love love the location. It is upstairs like why hate? You can oversee the view of the promenade. I have been here like 5 times. I even went here on my birthday and I love it! I sat outside right on the view side. It was gorgeous outside. The wait is long but its not like there is nothing to do. There are shopping areas outside that you can walk around in. I was greeted promptly and the hostess even accommodated my seating suggestion. I HAVE to sit outside next to the window/wall. They have nice heaters so I wasn't freezing my butt off. Bring a jacket when you're going to this location. Being next to the beach is extra cold. The ambiance is very chill. Some are having loud conversations and some are having quite intimate conversations. I hate awkward places where everyone is whispering. I want to enjoy my food without the awkwardness. Food took a while but it was because it is a Saturday night out at SM. We had bread at all times and the waiter checked up frequently so we would not run out of bread. I ordered the Kobe burger. OH MY DELICIOUS! It is about $14 and comes with a side. The burger is juicy, and it melted in my mouth. The bun was a plus to it as well. Soft and chewy.  Overall, I don't see the problem with this location or cheesecake. I really like it. My favorite location by far!"
Frederic P.,"Paris, France",7,34,1,1.0,2/11/2017,"Tourist trap. No service. Waited 45 minutes,  the waiter said it will be maximum 30. We waited 25 min with baby crying to get the high chair. Bad service.  0 star. Won't return"
Jackie O.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,20,91,1.0,3/15/2016,"So i have been to cheese cake factory before but unfortunately this location didnt have good service. Our server took awhile to take care of us. We had to ask three times for our water and beverages. By the time our appetizers came out the server still took their time to take our meal order. The ambiance is really nice i like how its on the rooftop and u can see over the promenade. The food was ok, took awhile to come  which was also disappointing. If im craving cheesecake i know now not to go to this location!"
Andishé F.,"Reseda, CA",145,89,45,4.0,5/5/2016,"You know when a establishment has low reviews, there really is a reason for it.  Came here around 9 pm and got the veggie burger with no bun and mayo  Several times before I noticed that my burger had mayo in it, the server came and asked how we are..  By the time I realized it was super late and my friend had finished her food and the sever didn't come. Finally the server comes BUT he comes to present the desert menu lol. Until I told him about the situation  Then the manager came n took it off the bill which was nice"
Trent N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,168,613,4.0,12/20/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a solid chain restaurant when you want giant food portions. I've been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country and all of them are the same. The chocolate bread that they serve you here is the best bread of any restaurant. My favorite item has always been fetuccini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes, but they have taken it off the menu!! This night I tried Chicken Chipptle Pasta which was delicious and it was actually a tiny bit spicy. I don't know why it's almost imppssible to find spicy food in America? I also tried the grilled coulotte steak. What a mistake, don't order a steak at a pasta place. Service was fine as always and the wait goes fast as they have so many tables."
Grace G.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"My friend and I went here a week ago and received the worst service ever. Our waitress kept telling us how busy she was but when we would ask her for something she would go talk to her coworkers or wait on her other tables and then pass us and completely ignore us. I was so appalled by the service we just got up and left. Right after I called to speak to the manager and he said he would talk to her and get back to me and he never did. I doubt he ever talked to her. Never going there again. It was my second day in California, my first time in Santa Monica and it ruined my entire experience."
Brian M.,"Los Angeles, CA",298,40,83,4.0,5/1/2016,"The food is really filling here, although it is quite expensive but it is a Cheesecake Factory so one can't complain. Getting seats might but difficult especially if you come with a bigger party but reservations should help out. The floors were slippery the day I went and I don't know if it's a common thing or someone spilled something so just be careful, sometimes people come in heels and you wouldn't want to slip! Service is quick and there are two main exits, though the elevator is usually congested. The lighting in this location is very dim if you want that to set the mood; however, it's pretty bad to take pictures in."
Tiffany Bernard ..,"Pasadena, CA",75,25,323,2.0,2/16/2016,"First off, I've never been to a cheese cake factory with such bad service. This is the first one to make me have to write a review. Kylie was our server and from the minute we got drinks she was so rude. We asked for room temperature water and her immediate response was ""I can give you water with no ice"" smart ass remark, obviously that is room temperature. Second she didn't bring out any bread... We all know that's what cheesecake factory's do. I had to ask Don't we get some bread with our order. All she had to say was I can bring some out? A runner had brought out our food, she seen we had our food when bringing the bread. Not once did she ask if we needed anything grated cheese crushed pepper? I had to again ask for some... She just walked around bring items without talking.  If you don't want to service people work behind a cubicle, and don't talk to anyone.  I had to ask a hostess for her name but found it on the ticket when we got our bill.  NEVER had I have to go through experience like this. Either get retrained or smile to your customers."
Lori R.,"Malibu, CA",245,47,65,5.0,4/5/2016,"Typical Cheesecake Factory cuisine but lovely atmosphere. In downtown Santa Monica, on top of a building with a lovely view of the promenade."
