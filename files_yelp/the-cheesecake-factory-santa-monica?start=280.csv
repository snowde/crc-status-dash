Femi B.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,92,1,3.0,7/28/2016,THE FLOORS ARE SUPER SLIPPERY!!! I saw a young girl slip and fall bad a few months ago. I had a hard time walking in the restaurant. I was wearing New balance shoes with gummy soles.  Cheesecake Factory should do a better job to make sure the floor are safe for patrons.
Alice C.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,124,171,2.0,10/30/2015,"Don't really go to large chains, with all the great local places in SM. But figured we'd give it a try since they have some nice salads. We sat down today at 7 pm. Our server J comes by soon after, and asks us for drink orders. We order around 7:25 as that is the first opportunity to do so after we had put in our drink order.  Time goes by...I ask one person (who I thought was a manager) after another about what's going on. Each person say they will get a manager, but no one comes. Then the final straw was another couple of people sitting at an adjacent table, who had sat down AFTER we had ordered, gets their food at 8 pm. We still had not gotten our appetizer. J keeps trying to tell us that various foods take longer. Apparently I look like I'm an idiot since he feels that I will believe that 2 dishes of hot food will take longer to make than 2 salads. (The people looking like managers were trainers who were supposed to help the staff keep on target with their tables, but clearly this was a fail.) The only reason I did not give my review 1 star is because of the manager Rebecca. She was soo sweet, and acted like a true manager, taking responsibility for what was poor service, and making it right by us tonight. I will amend if we ever try going there again. I will just ask for someone besides J."
Noushin T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",11,3,,1.0,9/16/2017,"About two weeks ago we decided to come to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my son's birthday. While it was supposed to be a joyous occasion, our meal came to an early end. After our food arrived, everything seemed OK until I bit into my sandwich only to find a shard of glass between the inside. I was lucky enough to taste the piece of glass before anything worse happened. This really ruined what was supposed to be quality family time and I decided not to continue eating or request another sandwich. I was so traumatized by what happened I lost my appetite and ended up just leaving the restaurant after our night was ruined. And while the manager offered to not charge us for the sandwich or our appetizers,I don't feel they were as apologetic as they should've been considering severity of the situation. This could've been a situation that could've turned out much worse and really should be brought to the attention of the managers and anyone who decides to go here."
Sarah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,4.0,6/10/2017,"I'm giving it four stars because the food was exactly what you expect from the cheesecake factory, over priced diner food. Minus our bread coming out raw both salads were good. The service I would give a five star. Our server Arthur/Junior was great! Very attentive. He made great drink recommendations, particularly the strawberry martini. If I come back I would definitely ask to sit in his section!!"
David M.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,25,36,4.0,5/21/2016,"Overall experience was great. Had to wait like 20 minutes to be seated and then 15 to get my order taken. Our servers name was Yolanda. She came by took our order and that was that. Another server came by and asks how we were doing and asked if everything was ok his name is Ryan, and I called him ""Ryan to the rescue"" he seemed to always be there when we needed something. The food was absolute amazing I had the Chicken Marseille and my girl had the Chicken Tostallo ( I might be mispelling the name). We sat in the patio area overlooking the mall, the atmosphere was great, an overall great ambience. I definitely recommend."
Shadan E.,"CA, CA",44,14,1,1.0,6/27/2016,"This place is nothing like a cheesecake factory. After waiting 1hour we sat is a tight place, and we were offered only 1 basket of stale bread. When we complained to our server he was too nice to just through the wheat and bring back the same two pieces of sour dough instead of changing it with fresh bread. The Nacho was sloppy and cold. All the food was just heated and was not freshly cooked. I asked for the management to hear the excuse for the bad food and service but no one bothered to come and talk to us.  I should say, this place is an embarrassment for cheesecake factory corporate. They should fix it or close it before more people have this impression about cheesecake factory restaurants."
Teepu K.,"Colton, CA",121,12,,5.0,3/3/2016,"While Cheesecake Factory doesn't have the best food in the world, for a big restaurant chain it excels at offering a variety of foods that are pretty decent. I enjoy coming here with friends on occasion and the desserts are always tasty to boot! All that aside, service is the ultimate defining feature of a restaurant, and this place excelled at that. Molly was the Hostess and was very patient with me despite a bit of a wait. She was clearly doing everything within her power to make sure I get my table and I really appreciated that type of care and attention.  I was then sat at the terrace overlooking the third street promenade with Anthony as my server. He was also very attentive and easy-going. I tend to be a bit annoying at restaurants because I ask for a lot of water, but he made sure I was always cared for, and that speaks volumes of the service. The food was standard but the service was exemplary. I'd definitely come back here given the opportunity. Way to go!"
Abdurhman A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,3,1,5.0,2/12/2016,"It was really a pleasurable and delicious experience. We have been hosted by revered, vibrant, and kind girl named Laura Ann. She was very helpful and energetic as she always precedes our requests with amazing suggestion and  met our full satisfaction. Many warm thanks Laura. With love, Abdurhman"
Sweet Angel ..,"Orange County, CA",0,76,32,1.0,1/8/2016,No winder the rate is soooo low ! Im not sure why they are not making sure that the managers doing the right job! I was amazed with this locations manager ! Me and not my family will go here again! Never ! Great waiters ! Snd they had to apologize few times for the horrible manager attitude ! Disappointing for such a wonderful company !  We had to take the burned pepperoni!  The manager she said : PLEASE EAT THIS SO YOU ARE BUSY AND I'll make another one ! How long? She said 5 mins ! I start timing her. After 12 minutes she cane back and shocked that i timed her ! Very rude responses BUT WITH LOWER TONE OF VOICE ! I manage 15 banks and i know what type of manager she was ! I dont think she ever has been in training !
Jijy S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",53,13,4,1.0,1/26/2016,"I used to be a server and the service we got here tonight was horrible. Laura Ann T was our server and she was rude, bossy and snippy. Treated me and family like nobody.  My steak Diane had mushrooms but onions. Which I asked for extra onions but no mushrooms. Parmesan crusted chicken was so soggy and cold. Only thing that tasted good were the avocado egg rolls and pasta carbonara.  No Steak knife, extra butter, drink refills, togo boxes and the check! At last this gettho server comes back asking ""whats up"" ? Only whats up? Really? Who does that when we need all that attention? What can i get for you ? How can i be a help? Do you never use these questions?  And most importantly we didn't come here to be bossed and told that she had whole a lot of things lined up to do before getting back to us with that nasty attitude!! Instead Should've told us politely that she will be back with what we needed! I would have done so if i were serving.  If Laura Ann couldn't handle that few tables and the pressure then next time she better stay in a smaller section! What a ruin of a great night"
Victor V.,"Charleston, SC",0,5,,1.0,8/9/2016,"This is one to miss... Went at 5pm to upstairs patio for some drinks with friends Eight tables open four sets of guests waiting. After 15 minutes I interrupted the male and female Host's conversation to ask "" why so long with so many tables open?"" He very matter of factly told me "" I don't get tipped so I don't buss tables! Really??? Unacceptable! I talked to the manager but seemed staff was running the show..."
Josh P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,7,2.0,8/7/2016,"I eat Cheesecake atleast once a week but i got to tell you the service and the service not good at all compare to other Cheesecake locations. The food is pretty much the same. But my waitter only took my order and we never saw him again, Anything we wanted we had to ask any random waitter walked by. We never got refills on any drink. And at the end I spoke to Danny the Manager and all he had to say is i am sorry and its only been a few weeks that he is working in this location and he is trying to fix it. But not once did he say can i do anything for you or let me get a slice of Cheesecake. I asked him where did my waitter go he said maybe on his break. So the whole time he left our table was with no waitter,  we never saw our waitter anymore but we dod see him walking around so we knew he was there."
Christopher Edward H.,"Los Angeles, CA",351,74,3,4.0,10/3/2016,"Tried out this place last night with my Brit friends that are in town. We didn't arrive until 10:55pm...5 minutes before closing. Yeah, we were those people. And I did feel bad! But the staff were lovely and let us sit at the bar, order drinks and appetizers. Great setup inside and the staff are really friendly and attentive. I'd definitely come back. 4 stars because we could only order appetizers for food."
Chel B.,"Torrance, CA",1,93,74,4.0,4/14/2016,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory- and while I know it's a hotspot for celebratory dinners- it is a really good 'casual' lunch spot. I do love how they give you a bread basket, especially since I was starved and couldn't wait for my food! I ended up ordering the veggie burger (from the regular menu) they have one on the skinny menu but for $1 more you get fontina cheese and a bigger patty...yes please. The party is made from mushrooms and quinoa and isn't a traditional garden burger which I appreciated. It was flavorful and had great texture and was very satisfying. I got it with a side salad and that was ehhhh, probably should have gotten fries. Overall, I would come back for the veggie burger :)."
Be R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,11,3.0,7/7/2016,"Shawn was a great server except for their lady manager who does not smile the more worst thing she did whenI complain that a lit of people complaining how dirty their restroom is , no toilet paper she replied in a poker face , seems irritated someone told me that already not even saying thank you. She should be accommodating to all her customers. I  and my family love cheesecake but my first time to encounter a manager as grumpy as she is."
Mark L.,"West Hollywood, CA",274,423,57,3.0,3/11/2016,This Cheesecake Factory has seemed a bit off both times I've gone. I eat at this chain frequently when travelling and they are always consistent. The food at this location seems to not be prepared as well. Service was slow and not very friendly both times Ive been. Hopefully things improve soon!
Rouben D.,"Los Angeles, CA",222,11,9,1.0,8/4/2016,I have loved cheesecake factor since I was a kid. I was in Santa Monica and decided to eat there. What a big mistake. Food was bad I got sick and throw up. The pasta was under cooked. Service was the worst I have ever seen anywhere.  I guess I should have believed the guy that stood outside with a sign saying worst cheesecake ever.  I hope Cheesecake Factory does something to this location fire management and hire someone tat cares. Shame.
William H.,"Santa Monica, CA",390,527,393,1.0,1/13/2016,"One star because large chains should be banned from lovely Santa Monica, but I gave it a shot nonetheless! It was no surprise that it currently has a 2 1/2 stars on Yelp, which is generous. The food is average at best. When I asked the server about the turkey burger, the response was, ""I hate burgers""!  Not what I would expect from the staff. However, I ordered it anyway and it was pretty good. The space is large and lovely, but service was lousy and the food was mediocre. The 'bacon tater tots'were a misnomer since they were effectively deep fried mash potatoes and didn't taste anything like a tater tot. I will be avoiding this place at all costs."
Eva B.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,37,49,2.0,3/20/2017,"I've had better service. I came to this establishment on a Saturday and I expected a crowd, which was there and a long wait time which I didn't get. One of the managers say us out on the patio it was fairly breezy so the heat lamp were going. About 5 mins later they went out for reason unknown. I informed the woman who sat us and she said sheep get right on it. Which she did and it when out again. But this time we've been sitting at our table for 15 minutes. Where our waiter? A few minutes after the thought crossed my mind he slowly comes over and takes our order. As he's waking away I had to call him back to bring out bread. To make a longer story short. I had to get another waiter to service our table be cause our waiter had abandon our table the table next to us. My gob daughter asked my we didn't get a tip. To answer that question because he didn't deserve any thing extra because he did give great service."
Kelly C.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,28,96,2.0,6/26/2016,"All of our food was so salty. The only thing we enjoyed were our beer, wine and the bread. All of our pastas, fried calamari and kids pizza they were all so salty. Love the cheesecake at the Grove. Never coming here again."
