Elida L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,6,4,1.0,4/23/2017,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE!! this is by FAR the WORST Cheesecake Factory!!! The one in Manhattan beach is the best. EVERY time me and my family come here they mess up SOMETHING!! The manager finally accommodated us but next time I will box my own food!! THE WAITRESS threw half my meal away!!! Never again!! Save your money! go to a better Cheesecake Factory!!!! Terrible!
Jnine N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",9,137,,4.0,3/20/2017,the cheese cake was delicious.  They were out of my favorite roasted artichoke and the wait was very long... Probably better to visit the locations in Bev. Hills.
Michelle C.,"Hawthorne, CA",133,10,1,5.0,2/12/2016,"I was skeptical about coming to this Cheesecake Factory because of the negative reviews , however because I've never been to this location before I decided to check it out for myself and I'm glad I did.  First we only had to wait 15 minutes which was amazing for a Friday . Upon being seated our waitress immediately came and got our drink order. Once the food came everything was delicious . Our server Corinne checked in on us regularly to make sure everything was okay . Overall great customer service from the moment we walked in. Everyone else around me seems pretty happy too so I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about .  Service was so good that it inspired me To write my first Yelp review ."
Optimus U.,"Santa Monica, CA",9,121,25,5.0,11/20/2015,"Changing my review. I come to cheesecake quite a bit. The kids do love it. We had some issues last time we were here. But looking at all these other reviews giving one star is extreme.  Many said the food was good, the atmosphere was good. So they need to work on the service a bit. But Cheesecake Factory is better than 2.5 stars. Come on people.  I guarantee most will be back. Give them some time to line things out.  I remember when the new one opened at topanga plaza it was the same thing.  Back again tonight and it has gotten better. Not 5* Better but better. I'm giving the 5* to counter balance some of the reviews that were excessive one stars.  There are still many good things about this Cheesecake Factory. Let them work on it and give them another shot in a month.  It will get better. Just like the one at topanga plaza.  Food is good, ambiance is good, cheesecake is good.  Besides, James has been busting his butt to please us and props to James.  The fact is last time I was here I was pissed and over reacted and shouldn't have written the review without settling down.  This is my 3rd visit and they have improved 200% from last time. So they are on the right track.  Cut them some slack. It's a big place and takes allot of staff. Patience is a virtue."
Jason K.,"Santa Monica, CA",968,49,32,3.0,1/16/2016,"They are new, and the staff isn't well trained enough, or the waiters have too many tables.  The wife flagged down the manager to take our order.  The food is good.  We both got the salmon.  Mine was bigger and the correct temperature, while her was the smaller one on the skinny menu and a little overlooked.  I gave her mine.   I'm sure they'll get better help, or the waiters will get better over time.  Also the estimate on the wait on a Saturday night was accurate, and we waited less than 20 minutes.  Totally acceptable.  We will be back."
Fariha A.,"Chino Hills, CA",70,95,62,4.0,2/16/2016,"I really enjoyed this Cheesecake Factory. It's definitely unlike any I've been to, and we decided to dine outside with a rooftop view of the Promenade.  For a Sunday evening it was not too busy, surprisingly. The food was highly enjoyable and service was prompt. I gave it four stars because the hostess was snobby and rude (I don't know her name but she's African American- a fair warning to not get turned off by the place if she's having another bad day). If it wasn't for her, I'd have nothing bad to say about my experience here!"
Tanit K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,2,1.0,11/7/2016,Run to the food court or True Food Kitchen! Two top. Monday afternoon. Easy right? Not for the team working that day. What a great location but wished it lived up to the other locations service. The waiter never came back for any refills or check on the status our order.  Sadly there are plenty of tourist that get this kinda service. FYI on this location you have to ask for the bread basket. Paid for my drink and app and as a local I'll just admire from a distance or drive to the valley.
April D.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,89,68,3.0,7/10/2016,I had the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich! A little dry and not enough sauce! Sweet potato fries always on point! The service wasn't great for mid day lunch!
Iris Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",21,36,4,1.0,11/10/2015,"I'm writing this as I sit at the BAR because despite the fact there are four people working back there, service is poor at best. We waited forever to get acknowledged and then never had our waters refilled. Not even once. This is at the bar. Where you are directly in front of the wait staff. Are they blind? It can't be that they're understaffed. There's a million wait staff walking around to the point it's hard to walk through Cheesecake Factory without having to dodge through them like its the Super Bowl. Oh no, they don't move of your way. You make room for them.  Maybe because they just opened but from the reviews below, they've got a long way to go.  Also, thanks bartender when I told you I WASNT finished with my burger, you looked me right in the eye and took it away."
Aytac S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/28/2016,"Worst cheesecake factory i have ever been, serving is so slowly. Also, if u want to order something, nobody come to u. Waiters are terrible"
Holly O.,"PACIFIC PLSDS, CA",42,61,,2.0,2/19/2017,"I don't know if it was just this location but the service was just awful. It was a Saturday night so it was pretty busy and they gave us a buzzer to buzz since it was a 30 minute wait. So after about 25 minutes they buzz us and I gave my buzzer to a hostess at the front desk and she said wait in the lobby and a hostess would be with us. After approximately ~10 minutes and all these people getting seated that came in after us I went up to a man at the front desk and asked what was happening and he said they forgot to print out our names to put in this business card holder for the hostesses to call from. Finally the guy prints our names and apologizes and a hostess came to seat us but then the table that she took us to was already taken. So then she goes to find her manager that takes another ~10 minutes and we just saw an open table and sat ourselves and the manager said that was fine. The table was a little greasy and the silverware didn't look 100% clean and it was already 9pm. Then the waiter comes and takes our orders and took about ~10-15 minutes to just get the drinks. Then it took about an hour for the food to come out! They came by and said one of the sections of the kitchen was impacted and it was going to take a few more minutes but it was more like 30 minutes. The 2 tables that sat on either side of us got their after us and got their food and check before we even got our food. The food was fine, nothing special but not terrible. Then the manager came out and apologized and granted us a free dessert for all the troubles. We didn't get out till 11pm..... a 1 hour dinner turned into 2 hours. Nevertheless, I won't be back to Cheesecake Factory, or at least this location."
Christian A.,"Willowbrook, CA",4,38,29,1.0,11/2/2015,I was so excited to see the new place at santa monica. Went to the bar looks likes all the the cheescakes nothing much has change there. Bartenders were great food was good to. They were out of tex mex eggrolls:(.         The only thing that did bother me was when they told us we had to leave. There was more guest inside the place as well so why can they stay and I had to leave. Felt very uncomfortable as they were rushing me down the elevator to leave. As a manager you have to know how to talk to guest in different situations. And theese two guys we're not professional at all.1 star for management he ruined for everyone.
Jamilett A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,15,5.0,2/25/2016,"People need to take it easy on this place; it's a new restaurant with new employees that are doing their best. I went in today & had pretty good service. I not only had one server attend to me, but two! So there you go, the servers want to make sure that your being helped. My food came out quick & right. The salad was delicious ! I got the lunch portion which was still a big portion. I'll be coming back here again hopefully with the same staff I saw today :)"
Galina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,2,4.0,11/8/2016,Nice place with a great view. The same delicious pasta in Italian restaurants. Only have a little wait here for until a table becomes free.
Natalie W.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/8/2016,"I must say I was very disappointed in the service I received  today.  usually it is very good  service, but today the service  & the food  was TERRIBLE.  The Waitress  served us Cold Food & the Manager tried to back her up, by saying it was supposed to be served like that. Then on top of that, The Manager wanted  my Cousin and Myself to pay for our drinks that we had. OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Johnni N.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,165,41,4.0,1/7/2016,"Excellent location and service! Super crowded night, but only had to wait 5 minutes for a table for two (with my wife). A pager was given to waiting patrons that buzzed when the table was ready. Location was excellent. Amazing views when having dinner. Service was great. Refills and anything we asked for was delivered promptly. I would definitely come back again!"
Armandina G.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",8,6,,1.0,10/8/2016,Very disappointed! Came for my birthday dinner and waited 2 hours to be seated they seated our party separately and service was horrible! Never again!
Michael H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",806,133,127,3.0,5/7/2016,The good always consistent. Our waitress was great. Horribly long wait to get seated. If you want to get served quickly seat by the bar area. Otherwise be prepared to wait an hour.
Kayla M.,"Los Angeles, CA",943,16,,5.0,8/23/2016,"Had outstanding service tonight by a woman named Laura Ann (two braided buns on her head in case I remembered the name inaccurately). Happy, friendly, and fast! I noticed her check in on me multiple times while other parties were sitting around trying to flag their servers down. Overheard the table near me compliment our waitress as well. Never encounter waitresses like this anywhere.. had to write a her a review! :)"
Myown W.,"Richmond, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/5/2017,"Food was okay, not good enough to be treated badly. Bad customer service from Sonya she was abrupt and not very kind at the end. If that's how you guys run your business being rude to customers than u guys have succeeded."
