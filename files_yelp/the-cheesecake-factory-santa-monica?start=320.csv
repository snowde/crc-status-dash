Sevana G.,"Tujunga, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"The food was of course great, however, not only did we have to wait a VERY long time to have our order taken, they used the fact that we forgot to get our receipt to double charge us. Will definitely not return. Very unprofessional and sketchy."
Paige F.,"Vallejo, CA",118,6,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Horrible service. Really disappointed because I love the Cheesecake Factory. People next to us came after us got their food first and left before we got our bill. We continued to sit and wait, waiting to pay with no one saying anything to us. I wouldn't come here again. To top it off our waiter disappeared. Waited over 30 minutes after giving the waiter my card for him to return. Terrible service. Really disappointed."
Demetra A.,"New York, NY",1,38,,4.0,7/18/2016,"Unfortunately I don't recall our servers name from tonight but she had a slight accent that we couldn't place. Anyway, she was wonderful, so courteous and professional. We had 4 appetizers and 4 main meals with our two daughters.  The food was very solid, especially the apps. But our server really made us feel welcome. Thank you!"
Mohammad A.,"Pomona, CA",1,9,,4.0,2/15/2017,"Last week end , I went to this place with my friends, and we enjoy our time there. the food is delicious and the service was good. the prices a little bit expensive. you have to wait on the line before you go and set on the table . I don't know about the other period of time but at the week end maybe you have to wait."
Dustin S.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",12,5,,1.0,1/18/2016,"To start off I rarely take the time to review anything positive or negative. However my experience at Cheesecake Factory was awful. I'm not a fan of most chains as I try and eat at smaller scale establishments. Before you say he's another snob that only expects the best experience at only the coolest joints, I'm a huge fan all kinds of out of dinner and comfort food as much at the sushi I eat on a regular basis. I'm rambling ... I went into the new CF after watching The Reverent (great gritty film) with my fiancé. She asked if I would want to go to CF (she knows I'm not a fan) jokingly. And I actually said, ""sure!"" To her surprise. The hostess promptly sat us in the bar table area. My fiancé went to the restroom and I returned a call while waiting at our table for her to get back so we could order.  She came back sat down as I continued my phone conversation for anther 3-4 minutes My fiancé and I chat some more after the call and we hadn't been asked out drink order or had approached us yet. We looked around to make eye contact with a server since we didn't know which was ours. We saw a table next to us that had 4 waiters around it with one waiter rubbing the shoulders of someone at the table. I assumed it was someone that worked there and everyone was stopping by to say hi. My fiancé and I both tried to make eye contact and my fiancé even tried to get their attention by saying ""excuse me"" with one of these servers standing next to us. And when we did they avoided our gaze and probably didn't hear her since it was loud, they walked away for us.   At this point we realized it had been a while since we sat down with no on approaching us.  I looked at my phone to see how long it had been since my phone call and realized we had been sitting at the table for 18-20 minutes and no one approached, dropped off water...  NOTHING.   We told the manager Ernesto on our way out. I'll say he tried to make it right by offering us a new seat, but we weren't willing to stay any longer. I was resistant before I went in and now the nail is in the coffin.  Systemic poor service along with a menu that fosters obesity....never again!"
J D.,"Inglewood, CA",0,3,3,3.0,10/15/2016,"So I was there today around 12:00 pm, party of four got a table right away on the patio deck. But we wanted a different table and the hostess said that there was no waitress. About three minutes seating the same hostess took other people to the section we initially requested.  We sat there waiting patiently for service for almost 25 minutes until one waitress finally came. She was nice and told us that the schedule was a mess and she will help us anyway This is why I'm giving this place three stars. But if you are hungry and expect quick service maybe you should have a snack first. #disappointed"
Damian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1675,18,8,5.0,5/18/2016,Highly recommend this place?l! Had BARBARA as our server she was so amazing! Great service! Great smile! Ask to sit in her section!
Jenny K.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,49,18,1.0,12/12/2015,"The food was okay and the server was good. However, the hostesses were totally incompetent.  The line was out the door and all 3 hostesses were staring at the screen. None of the hostesses were taking down guest names or greeting any guests. Then they misquoted the seating time. However, the worst of it was that they didn't even ask if it was okay with us to sit on the patio. Had it been a warmer day I wouldn't have minded, but it was FREEZING cold and extremely windy. They didn't even ask ""are you okay with whatever is available first."" They pretty much gave us zero warning that we would be sitting outside.  As we were being seated at our table I complained to the hostess that it was too cold to sit outside and she was very dismissive. I don't even understand why they were seating any guests outside when it was so cold, especially when I passed by at least 15 open tables inside.  This pretty much ruined the entire experience because it was so cold and windy that my food got cold. They really need to re-train the hostesses."
Steve D.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",19,11,11,2.0,10/31/2015,"Great cheesecake, but the waiter forgot my latte after asking for it twice. Opening week jitters I guess. Great patio, lovely décor."
Elvira E.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,13,1,1.0,7/14/2016,Worse service ever! Waited 27 minutes for a waiter. Will never be going here again. Have gotten better service at McDonald's. Waste of my time and money.
James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,96,76,2.0,2/29/2016,"I understand this restaurant is new but being such a large chain restaurant I thought they'd have it more together. The hostess told my party a 15 minute wait, which I thought was great for a Sunday night. We waited 35 minutes and then decided to check with her on the status. She informed us that she made a mistake and did not program the beeper. I thought okay mistakes happen and it's a new place. We were seated in a large booth right away which was great. We then waited for over 15 minutes. My wife finally got up to go and find a Manager to alert him of the lack of communication taking place. He came over apologized and offered to buy is an appetizer which was nice. After he took our drink and food order our server finally arrived. She seemed flustered and immediately started to apologize. I felt bad but my immediate thought was why didn't the Manager communicate to the server that he took out order. Our food came out timely with 4 people bringing our food including the Manager. Unfortunately, one of the serve handed me my plate of food which was extremely hot. I dropped it on the table before I got burned. The Manager didn't see but walked up as soon as all of the food was put on the table. He asked how everything was so I made him aware of what just took place. He apologized and offered to bring me an ice bag.  I refused but asked him to coach the server so this doesn't happen again. The key is that their communication is very poor amongst their staff as well as their training. Hopefully they'll improve but I just can't believe how unprepared they were. I will not be back.  Food is typical Cheesecake Factory quality. Huge portions and nothing great by any means. The ambiance in the restaurant as well as the patio are really nice and the only highlight."
Alex Y.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",58,9,1,1.0,5/26/2016,"First, I want to say how much I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory and that this will NOT stop me from going to other locations. On Tuesday it was my birthday and I went to this location with my boyfriend for dinner. It was nice to that we were seated within ten minutes, but from there on, it was alllllll downhill! Our waitress was the most inconsiderate server I have ever had. We asked for recommendations on new items and she pulled things out of no where and knew nothing about the appetizers. She said that Buffalo Blasts are just boneless wings, and they came as fried wonton wrappers! Someone needs to do their homework.  Then she rushed us to order and got upset that during our wait to be seated, we ordered drinks from the bar, meaning her tip would be smaller. Well, acting like this doesn't get you a bigger tip either.  When our food arrived, the Chicken Piccata (sp?) was extremely salty, cold, and the pasta was undercooked! When we told her, she rudely replied, ""So what? You want them to make you a new one?"" as she took our plate and went to the kitchen. Everything just got worse as the night went on, not to mention the unenthusiastic birthday they sang to me while giving me a small cup of hot fudge, with no spoon to eat it with!! Overall, this place was terrible! I am soooooo disappointed because I have NEVER had an experience like this at anyyy other location! The restaurant is beautiful, but unless you want cold, under cooked food, find another location to go to!"
Mary R.,"Hawthorne, CA",23,43,42,2.0,5/11/2016,"Dear Mr Factory,   The hostess you have that was working today 3-4pm was a complete waste of money to you! After waiting 6 minutes at the host podium I decided to call the actual restaurant to see if maybe that would help us in getting a seat. The hostest was not friendly or apologetic in any way. I'm mean hunny, you have one damn job, to seat the guests. After we got a table we saw her continuously disappearing while the wait to be seated area filled up over and over. She is a TERRIBLE person to have for that position! Maybe she needs to be in the back chopping lettuce or something but hosting ain't her strong area! Yall gotta do better better because I'm sure in her interview she mentioned how much she loves people, she needs to go. I don't know her name but I'm sure anyone that has been here while she was there knows who I'm talking about.... short, heavy set lady that likes to twirl her hair and do not work, this about you boo!"
Lauren J.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/21/2016,"First time at this location in Santa Monica, and I really enjoyed it. The waiter and customer service was great. The food was reasonably priced and had a nice atmosphere. Their pasta and cheesecake are extremely delicious. I would recommend their chicken piccata and chocolate fudge cheesecake. I enjoyed my experience at Cheesecake Factory, and would recommend to eat here to anyone who wants delicious food and wonderful service."
Norma R.,"Santa Monica, CA",136,35,83,5.0,1/3/2016,Cheesecake Factory you deserve these 5 starts thank you for your great services and keep up the good work..over all great service..what people are complaining about is just ridiculous..thank you for making our night great
Aileen E.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,49,94,2.0,1/5/2017,"Ok, let me get right to the point.  Service was awful.  But I'm giving them 2 stars because I should have known better than to dine here in the first place.  We sat for about 30 minutes after ordering with nothing but bread. And you guessed it, that was the end of the low carb diet!  When the order came it was not prepared as described in the menu. We had to wait about 10 more minutes before the waitress came back to the table.  When i described the issue all she said was ""Awww..."". She didn't offer to fix it, bring something else or take it off of our bill.   We told someone else about the issue and that person just smiled, acted all cheery and said ""No way, oh I'm sorry."" Then she went and got our bill and put it on the table.  That must be some training technique, listen but do nothing.  Needless to say, I won't be returning."
Maria K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",311,465,38,4.0,11/17/2015,"One of my favorite locations.  Sure its new, but the environment they've created both indoors and outdoors is not only welcoming, but aesthetically pleasing.  The food we ordered was tasty and items that we would definitely recommend.  The crab cakes are a must.  The pasta carbonara was filling and delicious and the lemon herb roasted chicken with the mashed potatoes was well seasoned and flavorful."
Kristen Q.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",211,700,1391,2.0,12/1/2015,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, you need some work as we all can certainly tell you are a BRAND NEW location and you just don't have it together like other Cheesecake Factories do in Pasadena and in Redondo Beach. Our waiter was pleasant but unfortunately he did have body odor which probably bothered only me since I'm sensitive about this. Every time he'd pass by, I'd get a strong whiff. BO is understandable after a long whole day of work but really if it's only 12-noon and the restaurant opened at 10 or 11am, really? Is it necessary to expose us all to that? Can you please use some anti-perspirant? In any other industry, maybe it's accepted if you're an athlete but if you're working in customer service, have some customer service smells to go with it. So all was alright until we started receiving our orders....the bf ordered a chicken sandwich and they brought him the wrong sandwich. And yanno, sometimes that happens! However, what really irked me is that our waitor insisted that his sandwich was the right sandwich and since the bf has been eating at Cheesecake Factory for years upon years on end, he knew it was not the right sandwich. So, they brought it back into the kitchen. But what sucked is that everyone else's food had already been brought out and now he has nothing to nibble on. Ok, I fib, he has a tiiiny salad. But the waitor essentially forgot the dressing? What gives?  So now about 10-15 minutes later the waitor brings out his sandwich and it is TINY!. We're all looking at it like, ""Where's the rest of the sandwich?"" So the bf asks, the waitor looks at it, and then he *insists* it's the normal size sandwich as the bf did NOT order from the lunch menu and ordered the regular portion. Finally after about 2-minutes of back and forth, the manager walks by and affirms that it is INDEED not only the lunch portion but the SKINNY portion size. So now they've messed up the order twice and everyone else is pretty much ¾ or almost finished with their meal. To top off the cake, even though I had specifically ordered the lunch portion and everyone in our party had heard including the person sitting right next to where our waitor was standing, the waitor gave me the dinner size portion and charged me for his mistake. Aiyah, a little too many mistakes, Mr. Waitor--I'm sure in a couple months you'll be a great waitor if you can just stop arguing with the customer when you make a mistake. That kind of just, stinks. Pros: Food is still great! There is absolutely no wait on weekends for lunch. Wowzers."
Melanie N.,"Malibu, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/15/2017,Me and my boyfriend thought this cheesecake would be good like all the other ones in the valley. Wow we were so wrong! Service was horrible and very rude waitress. Food sucked so bad that we have stomach aches hours after still. Stay away from this cheesecake if possible. Something was very wrong about the food too!
Elizabeth B.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,12,2,5.0,9/5/2016,Went here last night with my boyfriend for some appetizers and drinks and we sat in the bar. They were really busy and Katie served us. She was really amazing despite the countless people asking when we would be done so they could reserve our spot in the bar. Although they were really busy we got our food in a timely manner and Katie was really attentive to us. Thanks to Katie we will be back again and again!! :)
