Nathan A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",127,1,1,5.0,7/26/2016,"The customer service here is phenomenal. Our server Tyson was super cool and made sure we were taken care of constantly. Part of our order was delayed coming out of the kitchen but even though he didn't have control over the food, he was apologetic and made sure we were happy. I definitely recommend this Cheesecake Factory and you should ask for Tyson."
Monti M.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",0,16,12,1.0,1/9/2017,"Was in town for a couple days and decided to visit this location of The Cheesecake Factory. I always get fantastic service at other locations but from the beginning the service was a flop. We waited to get a hello and our drink order for over 10 minutes then was passed off onto someone else, who brought our drinks. I ordered hot tea and all I got was the hot water and when I asked for a selection of teas, I got a very rude response like I was crazy. Then the waitress asked for our order and if someone brought us bread. We had no bread and what she brought was cold/stale. My daughters order was being split with her friend and when it came out, no second plate was brought. When she came to check on us, she saw they were eating out of the same bowl and asked if someone was bringing another plate. At that point, they were basically done. I was not asked if I wanted a refill on my hot tea and felt like this experience was a game changer on my view of your restaurant. I guess I should have read the other Yelp reviews to see this location has service issues. Too bad as the food was good once it arrived."
Izzy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2017,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory, and have been to many locations in different states. This has by far been the worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory. The food took 50 minutes to come. The manager came by to tell us that there was a computer glitch and it would still be another 10 minutes. When the food came finally, there was no chicken in our buffalo blasts. It was all the fried outside with nothing inside. Then with the entrees they used the wrong rice in one dish. Totally disappointed. Also- our waitress completely disappeared on us. Will not be returning to this location again"
Ain B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,27,5.0,12/9/2015,"This place is always crowded. The service was nice and friendly, but slow. I ordered farfalle pasta, very delicious. I recommend it. They always serve bread with butter. Overall, everything is good."
Ani B.,"Glendale, CA",2,10,2,1.0,4/14/2016,"Alycia our waitress, was beyond horrible. I don't understand this girls worth ethic. My friend and I were having a beach/shopping day and decided to grab lunch here. We get seated. Our waitress alycia comes and is very uneducated of the menu. I asked her if they had a specific cheese and she said I don't know I'd have to check on that.  Later when it's time to order we place our orders. The bread hasn't been brought out yet. But every other table around us got theirs. So we asked her kindly why we're having a delay. She said it's still in the oven it'll be a couple more minutes.  A couple more minutes turned into 30 min after we got our food she brings the bread and asks if we still want it. Umm no how about you drop that attitude of yours and take it back. Oh the cherry on top was when our waitress randomly avoids us and when we asked the other waitress she rudely said ""ask your waitress"" well then. Someone doesn't like their job. Absolutely worst cheesecake I have ever been to."
Karla R.,"Sylmar, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/8/2017,Horrible experience! If you sit inside it is extremely busy. After being sat the waiter took our drinks which after 20 minutes of waiting we decided to walk out. Not worth the long wait for a table.
Niloofar T.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",0,3,1,2.0,2/24/2017,"The view and the location are awsome as well as foods. However costumer service was awfull! We entered with the elevator to the patio. The servant was sitting there and playing with her phone. I asked her is there any host to guid us where we should sit and she just answered me I'm not in the clock. We stand in front of empty desk for couple minutes, then I asked her again "" do we have to wait here or can we go and sit?"". She raised her voice and told me ""lady I said I'm not on the clock!!"". We ignored her and enter the patio and sat in a table. Another rude servant came to us and told us here is not a wherever you want to sit resturan and you have to go all away at the other side of restaurant. I didn't realize the restaurant is that huge since we need to walk all away to the other side and of course nobody guid us from the beginning. Anyway, they asked us where you want to sit and we choose the table that we were sitting at the beginning. Lol :)) we sat and again wait for the long time cause there were no available servant to give service to us. Finally rude girl from the beginning came to us for the order!!! And again she give service with very rude manner, I kinda scared of her and don't even asked her to bring me hot sauce cause I thought she would shout at me again!"
Caroline J.,"Santa Monica, CA",16,2,1,5.0,1/5/2016,Seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had. I ordered the salty caramel cheesecake and it really was to die for. Even my boyfriend who normally isn't a very big fan of caramel loved it! In other words - A must try!
Alexandria L.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,35,32,1.0,3/26/2016,"The WORST Cheesecake Factory experience EVER. Our waitress (if you even want to call her that) DAKOTA, ruined our evening. Not only was she rude and sarcastic, but down right disrespectful. Our questions were answered with smart remarks and she even over charged us. She didn't check on us after the check was placed at our table....yet she continued to ignore our many gestures to get her attention. When all else failed we spoke with another waitress to try and have the corrections made. She notified Dakota and instead of coming to our table, she waved us off. LITERALLY. She made the ""shooing"" motion and said ""one second""....from across the restaurant. I'm not sure if she thought we were blind or hard of hearing, but we definitely saw and heard their interaction. The new waitress came over to our table and apologized. She let us know that she spoke with Dakota and she would be over shortly. While we waited we watched her laughing and talking with her coworkers before slowly walking towards our table. As we politely expressed our frustrations over the mistake on the check, she interrupted my mother numerous times and then walked off. Needless to say, we will never visit this location again.  DISCLAIMER: I am a Nordstrom employee and know the value of outstanding customer service. We didn't ask for any compensation and even still left a tip, despite Dakota's actions."
Bonnie E.,"Santa Monica, CA",225,70,5,5.0,6/11/2016,Just a review for the Oreo Cheesecake. OMG. Best thing ever. Life is uncertain; eat dessert first.
Mr j.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,158,371,4.0,9/17/2016,"oh my how the wait can be so great.  during rush hour lunch or dinner, expect the que to be around 30-60 minutes.  the good thing is, there is a high turn over of tables.  best part of the food is that there is a choice or selection for everyone!"
Kristina A.,"Hemet, CA",0,5,1,5.0,7/3/2016,"The service was fast and polite. I ordered the goat cheese and beet salad which is a refreshing light dish. As for a drink, I ordered a blueberry mojito. The food and drink were delicious. Overall I was pleased with my visit."
Jackie C.,"Mesa, AZ",57,17,53,2.0,1/30/2016,"Food was great! My boyfriend and I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta (spicy) my pasta was cooked to perfection, asparagus still had some crunch and my bf ordered Parmesan herb breaded crumb chicken. Chicken was very bland/ plain, mashed potatoes were great! I did call to make reservations before, but they told me that they do not take reservations, when we came in and asked for a table with two seats we waited for about a good 30 to 40 minutes although while we waited there was an open bar available and that is where I ordered my piña colada drink was great as my waitress was ok but next time I would rather order it and eat at home ."
Stephanie G.,"Lomita, CA",164,7,,1.0,4/10/2016,"I constantly frequent this location since it's convenient on my lunch however every time I come I receive horrible service. They either forget what I order, take forever to service. Sometimes they don't even acknowledge me until I've been sitting for over 15 mins. For example today I ordered a drink, took over 10 mins and when I asked them they were barely going to make it but I was half way done with my meal so I ended up cancelling. I asked for no white bread, what did I receive, white bread. I've had to ask for water refills, utensils, napkins, you name it I've most likely asked for it. If this continues I will stop coming to this location"
Jason C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,26,,5.0,10/27/2016,I'm giving this a 5 stars just because of the waitress named Ashley A. When we were sitting at our table adjacent to us a table with two little kids came in. They were banging on the table with silverware being really loud. Ashley was really calm and polite and professional. She said she would see what she could do to calm them. Within 5 or so minutes the kids were calm. They were just two young kids being kids but she was calm through the whole thing. She said if wanted to move we could  she could move us. We said no we were fine. Ashley wrote me a little note on the bill that said P. S. sorry about the day care I thought that was kind of funny. I wrote Ashley a little note thanking her and how professional she was. Ashley went above and beyond and hope she gets recognized. Thank you again Ashley for making our experience so much better. You're the reason why I give this place a 5 stars
Michele B.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,108,143,3.0,1/19/2016,"Ambience is the best of it, both outside patio with 3rd st promenade view and/or inside are both very cozy and pleasant. Customer service is just non-sense and rude starting from the host at the door. The food is not a regular cheesecake factory delicious meals, it's blah, and Cold. The drinks are ok, cocktails are more like juices than alcohol, which does not happen at the Cheesecake Factory from Sherman oaks or Redondo Beach. I think the patio should have a movable celling cover for the rain because I had to run with my food and drink when it started raining out of a sudden (imagine the scene). I feel like I am being generous with my 3 stars, this place is more likely 2 stars, but I really enjoy the ambience."
Shari P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,66,2,3.0,8/12/2016,"I have always like TCF with their extensive menu options. They were a bit late to the healthy food table but nobody's perfect. Last weekend we saw an afternoon flick and went to grab a bit to eat at Cheesecake thereafter. I was craving a burger and fries and that was when I discovered that on this huge menu, you can either be vegetarian or gluten-free but you cannot be both! They offer gluten-free burgers on every other option - beef, chicken, turkey patties, but no vegetarian. I don't know if you've improved your veggie patty but while you're making it gluten-free, you could definitely improve upon it - add more protein, that's what us vegetarians are often missing in veg items - and look into QUORN products, a non-soy mycoprotein source that is gluten-free! So I had a alcoholic liquid dinner of wine to help me cope with the disappointment that a restaurant with a menu the size of a book couldn't accommodate me. Come on guys, this is California, get with healthier options - if I can get a gluten-free animal based burger shouldn't I be able to get a gluten-free vegetarian option as well?? Everyone else loved their meals so I made this review a three-star."
Cassidy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1025,98,382,3.0,1/17/2016,The pasta here was really good but the wait was too long and the dishes are a little expensive. We didnt get our food for at least an hour.
Naomi R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,22,4,1.0,11/14/2016,"Came to cheesecake on a Monday night. No server came to greet me for 20 minutes so I walked up to the host and requested for a server. A server told me that my server is busy inside and would get my drinks started, I ordered a cocktail and waited another 15 minutes for it to come out. This guy came to drop off my drink and didn't say hello or anything just stood there with his notepad in his hand so I asked him if he was my server and he said yes that he will be taking over for the other server. He was rude and didn't seem interested in coming to the table and checking in on us. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and my boyfriend ordered a strawberry cheesecake and we waited 20 minutes for it to come out. I understand the servers have other tables and are busy but being a server myself, I appreciate when servers check in on me and ask how things are going. Overall not impressed with the service here."
Raquel D.,"Orange, CA",152,4,,5.0,8/27/2016,"Came here for my sister's 21st birthday dinner and we loved it! Our server, Laura Ann, was absolutely amazing and attentive. She was training another server who was very good as well! We were originally quoted a 45 min wait but only ended up waiting about 20 mins. Food was great and on time, however it was the amazing service that really pushed the dining experience to 5 stars! Laura Ann was so attentive, sweet, positive, and fun. We totally loved her!!!"
