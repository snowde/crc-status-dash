Darlene J.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,167,64,2.0,12/31/2015,"We (co workers)  were invited to attend the Training Service prior to Opening Day. So, we were prepared for possible slow service , there to be kinks & lunch may be a little long. We were greeted by a Happy & friendly hostess & seated quickly. The trainee server was shadowed by an experienced server. Service was Very Slow & Orders were wrong..but, the meal was free anyway & we were apologized and given Cheesecake & more appetizers! Yay! Soooo, today after being open for at least 2 months we thought the Kinks were out. We had reservation for 1145 we were seated immediately..so far Great. We all knew what we wanted & placed our orders (just in case it was still Kinky!) After receiving our drinks & bread...45 MINUTES UNTIL WE RECEIVED OUR LUNCH! I had to ask a passing busboy to find our server!  Well, food arrived, salmon salad, chicken wraps, Cobb salad & avocado/chorizo omelette  (me). Everyone enjoyed their food, except my potatoes were overcooked.  Our Server hadn't even apologized for the late service or the potatoes.  I Love Cheesecake Factory...but, I think I will wait awhile before trying Santa Monica location."
Dee R.,"Bellflower, CA",27,70,68,5.0,5/8/2016,"From all the rest of the Cheesecake Factory locations I have visited, this one has been my favorite!!! Less than 10 minutes wait, service was excellent. Food was delicious and the Mai tai was exactly what I wanted. Took a slice of Red velvet cheesecake home :)"
jisun y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/30/2016,"Warning - do not go to bathroom here before eating guys.  It's really filthy and it will take away your appetite and some of you might throw up.  I understand it's busy on weekends but can you make it a little cleaner? I'm sure there's no system how to maintain the bathroom here. And regarding service,  our server was not sharp at all. We asked for bread and every time,  she acted like she heard it for the first time and we could have bread after asking her 4 times. Refill & drink order came in so late as well. I ordered chicken piccata and it was so bland, no taste at all. My husband & sister tasted it and said the same thing.  Considering we waited for 40 minutes, everything should taste good but sadly it wasn't.   I've been to other locations and this cheesecake factory is the worst."
Oscar G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Not surprised to see this Cheescake Factory has minimum stars. My friends and I decided to eat here for dinner for a friend who's leaving LA. As usual Cheescake Factory; waiting in line. When we were seated our waiter came and almost sounded too stern and stubborn, he didn't have a name tag so unfortunately I can't point him out, you know who you are. Anyways, I asked for a simple cup of Coffee and he rushed in and said ""so what kind of latte would you like?"" I said COFFEE, not Latte. Whatever I just got a latte not to fuss anymore. It also took a half hour for my friends to get their simple request of water. I ordered a shepherds pie since I wanted to try something new. It arrived well done but as I was halfway through eating I noticed a few pieces of my ground beef were raw, RAW. Cooked well on the outside but raw pink on the inside, what the hell? I questioned the waiter about it and he insisted that the meat comes like that, ""medium-rare"" he said, it did not. Another waiter came by since we STILL didn't get our waters, she looked very distressed and thought we said ""Eggnogs"" um what? Is your staff okay? I left Unsatisfied knowing my appetite was ruined. The waiter asked me if I wanted my plate fixed but at this point I didn't care anymore and told him it's fine. Threw away my raw leftovers and currently sick after eating unsuspecting raw meat as I'm typing this. Lesson learned, For the record my entire night was ruined because of this one mishap, Atleast ask me whether I like my meat RAW or well done. Disgusted. Not coming here again."
Joel P.,"Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",4,13,6,1.0,11/30/2015,"Wanted to try this place out since it was nice , first the host was not very happy at all . I asked how long the wait was and she said there no wait . We wait 15 mins to sit down . When we were seated he waited another 10 mins before a waiter came to help us . The waiter was okay nothing to special . The food in the other hand was just average . First and last time I will be dining here at all . Overall service was bad"
Francesca B.,"Surprise, AZ",54,71,133,3.0,5/1/2016,The Cheesecake Factory was alright. My older sister and I went here to celebrate our birthdays since they are two days apart. The salted caramel cheesecake was delicious and so was the other food we ordered but it took forever for the service. We ordered our beer and got it awhile after we ordered and then we waited forever to get another. They were too busy for their own good. The server was super nice but they were too busy.
Shouq S.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,1,1.0,9/16/2016,"Worst service ever. We were party of 7, and we didn't have to wait to get seated. The food arrived almost after an hour of ordering, and they brought everything together: appetizers + main course. Three of the orders where cold, imagine eating cold pasta!!!!! We didn't ask them to change because we were late and we had to leave. Won't visit again."
Milt R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,5,6,2.0,1/1/2016,"I have no idea if it they were understaff or need it extra buss boys, tables weren't flip in a quickly manner and groups of people were standing around waiting for their table after waiting for about an hour to be seated.!!  Waiting for Jenn or Veronica to come and see us.."
Chris W.,"Chicago, IL",7,36,9,1.0,12/18/2015,"I hate to give only one star but this has been the worst Cheesecake Factory that I have been to. There was a total of 3 of us in our party. The waiter was a really nice person but don't think he had the best training to be out on his own. Had to ask 3 times to get water, and another her 3 times to get some lemon and when he finally did bring it he brought it on a napkin wrapped up. I believe in a restaurant like this I should have received it on a small plate. The cleanliness of the dishes was really bad as well. Both forks and spoon I had was really dirty. You were able to see the crusty stuff on there from before. Finally after getting clean utensils the plate the food came on was dirty.  I don't think I will ever return to this location again."
Phil P.,"Pasadena, CA",130,5,,5.0,5/9/2016,"Came in for mothers' day. Service was quick and friendly (our waiter, Emil, was super nice). Food was good too. Great place to take the family."
Tuul G.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,15,,5.0,4/11/2016,"The vibe is beautiful, wonderful, impressive. Had a food in the outside of the restaurant, quiet, clean and neat! The pizza and beer delicious and worth with the price! Definitely come back again :)"
Lexi R.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,15,2,1.0,8/21/2016,"The managers need to FIRE EVERYONE or better yet, the managers should just quit and Corporate should rehire everyone from the top down.  I'm so over their countless apologies.  I came in with a coworker on our lunch break and we stood at the front like idiots while there was no hostess to greet us or seat us.  Eventually I walked around looking for someone and found the hostesses ""hanging out"" and chit chatting with each other.  Seriously?  Is this what you're paid for?  We were finally seated when I spoke up.  I told them we were employees of the mall and we were on our lunch break, so what do they do?  They sit us in a section with TWO LARGE parties being waited on by ONE SERVER.  Seriously?  How dense are you?  It took the server 15 MINUTES to even come to our table to take our drink orders.  We told him we were on our lunch so we'd like to order everything now, and if it's possible to get our check right away so we wouldn't have to wait.  He gave us so much attitude for this request.  Are you effing kidding me?  Don't you think if you were waiting on employees of a mall that you work at, you might be a little nicer.  We work with a lot of people, and word travels fast.  After 30 MINUTES of waiting for two sandwiches we asked a passing server if he could check on our orders since clearly our server couldn't give two shits about us.  Guess what?  Our sandwiches came out COLD.  Who knows how long they had been sitting there while our server tended to the parties refilling their waters.  We were so annoyed at that point and needing to leave to get back to work, we flagged down another server to get our check, which took another 15 MINUTES.  Seriously, WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE THAT WORKS HERE?  Is incompetency a requirement?  There were high hopes when this Cheesecake Factory opened.  Unfortunately it's just been a HUGE LETDOWN."
Antoine K.,"San Fernando, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/26/2016,"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. As you can see I seldom review places I go to but this place really deserves the bad review. My friends brought me here for my 21st birthday. First of all our waiter James did not say hi, he did not ask us how we are doing, he simply tossed our bread in front of us and asked ""you want anything to drink."" I know this is a large chain and all but I have gotten MUCH better service at much cheaper places. I order a filet mignon and it was great. Then after waiting 20 minutes for the check (not an exaggeration it was 20 minutes) another guy comes up ""hey guys your waiter James had to go on an emergency break Ill be taking over, did you guys get your 4 strawberry cheesecakes yet?"" And thus the surprise was ruined. My friend had gone to the ""bathroom"" to order the table surprise birthday cakes and this guy ruined it. We canceled them immediately. Not his fault, why couldn't James have said ""oh hey they have a surprise"" instead he kept up the consistently crap service he provided in the first place and all was ruined. Not a single factor of the whole night was redeeming. Once we talked to the manager he was very apologetic and said ""dont worry your cheesecakes will be free."" We were absolutely astounded WE DIDN'T GET THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR STAFF. So instead he payed for my steak which again, was nice, but I would have much rather paid for the food and have received nice service rather than get a free meal. And a side note the manager we talked to was a visiting manager and he was great, very apologetic and sharp. Once the actual manager of the place came over and heard the story and I had told him that Im going to give this place a bad review and not come back his response was simply ""ok cool"" and he walked away. All in all if you dont care about the service go ahead, no complaints about the food. If you dont want to be treated like dirt stay away!"
Sarah L.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,72,1,3.0,4/20/2016,"Food never disappoints (in my mind)..... I guess my main complaint is that this place is so big and loud that it's hard to have a conversation and you feel a little overwhelmed.  Come to think of it, we went to another Cheesecake in the valley a few months ago and it was the same thing..... far too crowded and loud, but the food and the cheesecake are delicious."
L W.,"Coto de Caza, CA",1,11,28,4.0,10/28/2015,"I've always liked Cheesecake Factory. I hope the new location at Santa Monica Place can be as good as or even better than other locations. ---------update--------- Today is Oct 27, the first day this new location open to public. Visited there today for dinner. I've never seen so many waiters and waitresses in a restaurant, of course I know they are being trained . We walked inside and were led to our seats. After a while our server came and ask us what to drink. After the drinks came we waited for more than fifteen minutes for the breads to come. Too bad our server forgot to bring the breads, which are my favorite food at CF. I asked one of the servers to bring us the breads and finally they were on the table. Foods are very delicious as usual. One more thing I need to point out: it was 70 degrees outside. Why did you turn on the heaters??!! I asked them to turn it off, and 30 minutes passed by it was turned on again. One of the managers came ask if it was too hot. All the customers said YES. Maybe in the near future it'll all get better.  Love, L To be continued."
Andrew J.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,25,1,1.0,12/8/2015,"It pains to me to have to write this review.  After coming to TCF opening week and having a great experience..... the experiences since has been BEYOND TERRIBLE. If there is a problem or a bad experience at a restaurant that I frequent a lot - I will never write just on bad review. But this location is NEEDS to get their act together. The past 3 times I have come the restaurant is an unorganized mess. We waited on Sunday for 20 min before someone even came (after flagging them down) to be greeted. We then in the next 10 minutes had 3 different staff members come up to our table to either bring us bread, water or greet again! It then took our last and final server 10 more minutes to bring out 4 waters. We were there for 45 minutes without even ordering food yet. At this point- we left. And sadly won't be returning."
Monique L.,"Fremont, CA",95,10,6,1.0,11/21/2015,"Although this place is new, I should've got at least decent service. The only reason why I'm giving a star is because we got seated right away. Other than that, this cheesecake experience was the worst. Service was horrible and you could easily tell that the staffing is new.  1) While my boyfriend and I were eating, a server wasn't paying attention and he was leaning on my boyfriend.. He quickly apologized, made an ""oh shit"" face, and walked away. 2) Our server didn't come back to see if we were ok. Didn't refill our water.  3) We were waiting so long for her to come back so we could ask for the check, so we asked another server. So that server gave us our check and we paid. Then the original server comes back and gives us our check again.. No communication amongst the staff whatsoever.  4) Last but not least, servers were very rude with no smiles on their face and not greeted properly. When we were handed our check, they just quickly threw it on our table with no words.  Hopefully we could come back here when the staff is better trained because they need a lot of work."
Esther A.,"Fayetteville, NY",0,7,10,4.0,7/17/2016,"Very pleasant experience. Waiter was very nice and helpful with the menu. I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo and it was delicious. After eating my meal I had a red velvet cheesecake that was also very good. View is very pretty, sat outside."
Alexandra F.,"Prague, Czech Republic",1,2,,5.0,5/14/2016,"We had the best of times here, the food was very fresh and tasted amazing and our waitress was very attentive and kind."
Ashley M.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",585,200,29,1.0,2/8/2016,The service here really needs to be stepped up! The waiters are slow & incompetent and a few of the managers are straight up RUDE!
