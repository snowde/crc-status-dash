Valerie R.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,18,10,1.0,3/25/2017,"If there were no star I would give them that. My family and I went in to have dinner last night. We ordered our drinks with our server Anthony, my husband ordered a Cadillac with patron along with a cup of water, I ordered a water and my two kids a lemonade cause their soft drink dispensary was out of service. The margarita was delivered without grand marnier.. we looked at each other and thought why would they not add grand marnier. But of course our waiter did not deliver any food or drinks, I also ordered my food with no mushrooms, and did I mention I still have not received my water by this time. Our order finally gets there, my plate had a ton of mushrooms, we still never received bread, my husband had no water, and by the time the waiter finally came by to see how things were going, I had a side plate filled with mushrooms, cause I poked everything out, and all he can say was he's sorry for all the mistakes but wasn't really sincere about it. He came by maybe once the whole time we were there. Worst service ever!! Never coming to Cheesecake Factory again!! I felt like we were a bother, cause the attentiveness was not there, and neither was customer satisfaction!! Drinks were wrong, food was wrong, no water, no bread, soft drink out of order!!"
Michelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,158,157,4.0,10/30/2015,"Came here on a second day after their grand opening!  The food and decor is very similar to other locations, but the best part is their patio area! The patio is so spacious and dimly lit, and you get a great view of the Third Street Promenade. The heating lamps warmed me up and it was just a perfect Santa Monica evening!  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Maybe they're just helping out from other locations this week but had great service."
Dilan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,5.0,1/8/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant and their cheesecake's are delicious. The variety of choices is amazing. I have been there twice so far and the waiters are really polite.
Tiffany J.,"Okatie, SC",4,5,3,5.0,4/22/2016,Our waitress Allie was so helpful and informative. The atmosphere was so fun and we got to sit outside with a perfect view of the sunset. The food was delish and filling. Make sure you save room for cheesecake though!
Brenda C.,"Culver City, CA",0,4,3,1.0,4/13/2016,Service is extremely slow!  Rather make the drive to a different Cheesecake Factory than eat here.
Madeline L.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,4,16,1.0,1/24/2016,"Very disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory location...  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi which was served on a plate whose edges had not been wiped clean prior to sending it out of the kitchen. I turned a blind eye to that in hopes that the quality of my food would make up for this. Being very hungry, I was eager to dig in. Unfortunately, part of my pasta was undercooked. The first time it was sent back, my waitress offered me some soup or salad while waiting for the kitchen to process a fresh batch of pasta. I asked for the soup, but that soup was never served to me. My food was served within a few minutes and to my surprise, the pasta had been more undercooked than it was the first time around. I immediately asked for the manager. He wanted to reimburse me for it so he offered some cheesecake. The bill was then put to our table and I was still charged for the Shrimp Scampi which I barely consumed. Again, I asked for the manager who did not hesitate to remove the Shrimp Scampi from the bill.  I expected more from this huge and beautiful location. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my food had to be sent back to the kitchen twice because it was undercooked. The highlight for the evening was the front desk staff who was very courteous and also the fact that I did not have to wait for a table. Overall, it was not an enjoyable dinner. I really hope they do something to improve their service and coordination."
Gerry F.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,5,1,2.0,11/5/2015,"I was so happy this location opened , close by my kids school. Usually go to the Marina Del Rey location and will be returning there. Unfortunately for me and my son we visited this location only to find out the kitchen is extremely slow Alexandra our waitress was apologetic my food came out a whole 10-15 minutes before my sons chicken strips ( nothing fancy) than waited another 5 minutes for his French fries! Very poor experience for having so many employees almost ran into them twice on the way to the rest room ! Smh hope you fix the kitchen issues soon."
Jacob F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",82,15,1,3.0,5/7/2016,We ordered a large Caesar salad. It tasted like seamen. On top of that it wasn't even a large. They just spread it thin across a giant plate. Music and view was good however.
Catherine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/8/2016,"Dining at this Cheesecake Factory was probably one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. A group of 8 of us went to dinner to celebrate a friends 30th birthday. To start we were told the wait time to be seated was half an hour, not too bad, but 45-50 minutes after we got there we still had not been seated. I went up to see what the deal was and was told they were ""clearing"" off the table and it would be 5 minutes, 15 minutes later and two check ins, we had still not been seated and  we were told it was going to be 5 more minutes. We could see a number of empty tables and it wasn't until the birthday girl went up to say we were leaving that they sat us. Now to the actually dining and wait service. Once we actually got a table we were sitting for about 15 minutes before our waiter even came by to introduce him self and take drink orders. We had to ask for bread, which didn't show up on the table until another 10 minutes, and we had to ask for refills on our drinks. About 30 minutes in we finally were able to place our food orders and who knows how long it took to get the food but it seemed like an eternity. The order was mostly correct but they forgot the birthday girls food. The waiter never really made a appearance during our visit and we had to flag someone down to tell them we were missing items from our order. The manager at this point got involved and apologized, saying he was getting the samosas fresh and that he would ""comp"" the samosas. Good thing the company was nice or we would have all been really cranky. When it came time to pay the check we had to find the manager to get the bill, which came back to us incorrectly, it took them 15 minutes just to process the payments and make corrections. The manager had come by again noticing that we were all agitated with being ignored and offered up cheese cake. The birthday girl ordered and we proceed to wait another 10 minutes to find out that he was going to give a single piece of cheese cake to the group of 8. At this point we had already been at the restaurant for 3 hours and didn't want to wait any longer so we left without the piece of cheese cake.  Given all of the places near by you're better off going somewhere else."
J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,2,5.0,10/6/2016,so I want to give an update and this is for the actual Cheesecake Factory Company. I have been contacted by Ms July from the Corporate office and I did appreciate her concern for my daughter. She was extremely nice and sent us a gift card and a teddy bear for my daughter. I do appreciate good Customer Service and the corporate office definitely showed us they care. I hope the Santa Monica location will get to the same level of the other ones because we really love their food. Thank you.
Leisa C.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",41,54,15,2.0,3/13/2016,"Wow the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been too, and I am a big fan normally. Glasses were dirty. Silverware was dirty.  The service was so slow."
Lilly S.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",57,173,23,4.0,12/29/2015,"I'm kind of surprised why this location got such bad reviews honestly. My boyfriend and I came in, left our names and told us there was a 40 minute wait time. So we walked around the mall and got a notification form them saying our table was ready. We were sat immediately and our server came within a minute of us being seated.  The atmosphere is good, not too loud, and usual Cheesecake Factory decorations. We ordered our drinks and food and bread, of course. Our server let us know that bread is still being made and will be another 5-10 minutes and asked if we would like soup. She offered us complimentary soup since we had to wait for the bread, and it was really good soup!  Our food came, I got tomato basil pasta, and it looked less then usual at other cheese cakes factories. I told the server who called the manager, the manager was very nice, took my pasta and made fresh batch to add onto my pasta.  We got really good service, good food. Maybe we got lucky, but I was very happy with the service!  I wish I remember our servers name, but either way she was awesome. We will definitely come back to this location as it is much closer to my house then Marina Del Rey location."
Amy g.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,45,2,1.0,10/24/2016,"Really horrible service and food is just blah! I mean I'm not expecting five star dining here, but this place is a joke. This location is right by my office, so have been here two times with coworkers to eat in and once for take out. Both in eat experiences were bad - took forever to get tables (even though we had reservations), service, drinks and food. Ordered pickup today and despite approximately 10 people at the hostess stand, my friend had to ask two times for someone to get our order. Once we got hte order 10 min later, it was wrong. Another 10 min and we were off! Chinese chicken salad was so boring. Was basically iceberg lettuce and a small piece of chicken. Half the ingredients listed in the menu were missing. Such a disappointment! Booooo!"
Lovelee W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,3.0,12/6/2016,"I loved cheesecake factory.....until about...2 wks ago...our waiter ""Ty"" came to our table...asked us what we wanted to start with ..we asked for water...and it took twenty mins to get water in dirty filthy greasy glasses....i mean who wants to drink that? Then....I politely asked for some more water in a glass not a greasy plastic cup....second round of waters had floaters in it.....I at this point was grossed out.....looked around and no other patrons had dirty glasses or silverware....it wasn't cheesecake factory it was the idiot waiter....make sure u dont get him as a waiter...he is slow and all over the place...they had to come out and ask everyone who's food was whose...uuugh....check Ur water people before u drink it....and check Ur waiter ...make sure it's anyone but him....and he had a bit of tude....I hope I'm wrong about him....I'm not being mean but this happened at the best place ....makes me think twice about going...."
Wendy C.,"Hawthorne, CA",7,11,7,5.0,2/14/2016,First Time Going To The Cheesecake Factory And Of Course On Valentine's Day The Wait Was An Hour Long But So Worth It The Food Was Delicious. And Our Serve Michael Was Awesome Explaining The Menu Options For Us. Would Totally Be Coming Back
N E.,"Fresno, CA",8,40,17,1.0,2/11/2016,"I have never experienced service this bad. Waitress was horrible... Food was ok, didn't have desert"
Katie D.,"Santa Monica, CA",36,129,10,5.0,2/16/2016,"Looking at this now, it has a 2.5 stars rating.  Ouch!  I didn't read the other reviews but I had a great experience.  I've been to other Cheesecake Factorys but hadn't been to this one yet since it's newer.  We had to wait thirty minutes but that was kind of expected.  It was busy so it took another 10-15 minutes for the server to get to us, but once we ordered food and drinks, it came out quickly enough.  The food was regular Cheesecake Factory food but I had the best cheesecake I've had there - the tuxedo cheesecake.  I always ""struggle"" with the cheesecake menu, poring over the many choices and hoping to avoid the dreaded fomo for a different one.  But the tuxedo was sooo good!  The waitress was sweet and came back to check up frequently."
Anna D.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",37,99,499,1.0,4/25/2016,"Our waiter Conor was great even though the place was busy! The food, however, was not that good. I had the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, and it wasn't as good as I've had it at other locations. The brown rice was undercooked and crunchy. The sauce was too sweet and not slightly spicy like it's supposed to be. The portions seem to be smaller at least at this location. My plate had only 2 shrimp so I felt like it's misleading to call a dish chicken and shrimp when there's barely any shrimp and barely any chicken. For 4 people, we spent $100 plus tip, and just didn't feel we got what we paid for. They don't even do anything special for birthdays anymore except clap.    Very disappointing for a birthday dinner. Nothing special about the food either. The rest of us had burgers and pasta carbonara. They forgot to bring the fries with the burgers until we had to ask for it. It makes no sense for them not to leave condiments like ketchup, mustard, and sugar at the table so the waiters don't have to keep going back and forth. We were all dissatisfied with the food so we tried to fill up on the bread instead because we hadn't eaten all day. At least, the bread was ok. We won't be coming back here. The management and cooks need to be swapped out."
Jessica H.,"Covina, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Definitely rate this place with a ZERO - this location is a joke along with the people working there. Highly recommend going else where. Never been to a Cheesecake Factory that had such horrible ""customer service"". Came here on a Sunday night with my family and I - where they informed us the wait will be approximately 30 mins, OK that's fine. However, when our buzzer was notifying us that our table was ready the bus boy was walking us to our table to find out our table was given to some other party. Bus boy walked us out to the outside patio and informed us it will be a couple of minutes until our table will be ready. 25 mins just passed before we knew it we were waiting 55 mins overall!? So this short, Hispanic, long blonde haired hostess with some very heavy lipstick thinking she works at MAC cosmetics was walking us to our table with a stanky face along with a pathetic attitude. I'm not too sure if she was having a bad day or she just hates her job - either way a restaurant shouldn't have employees like her working for them because it reflects on the company in a very negative way. We are paying customers but to be treated like that it's absurd! WILL TAKE THIS MATTER UP FURTHER TO CORPORATE - BYE FELICIA!"
Amer Hussien Y.,"Anaheim, CA",51,2,1,5.0,3/17/2016,Evrything was good expect th service katllena was awsome amazing customer service with un fake smile and the place was v.good
