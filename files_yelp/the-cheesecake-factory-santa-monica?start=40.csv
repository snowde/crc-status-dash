Jamila V.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,166,319,4.0,3/21/2017,"I came here for a work lunch with a group of five other women. I'm not a huge CF fan simply bc there's always a wait at the locations I go to and the menu is overwhelming.  Thankfully there wasn't a wait since it was Monday at 12:30 but the menu was still overwhelming lol.  The buffalo blasts are a go-to for me and once again they didn't disappoint. The only part I hate is that there's so much ""crust"" and very little chicken.  Everyone at my table asked for some type of substitution and the waitress accommodated everyone which I thought was pretty freaking awesome. But then again it is Santa Monica aka land of ""I don't do [insert whatever food trend here]"". It did tale a little while for all the food to come out but everyone was satisfied with their meal with not one complaint. So bravo CF for a solid experience."
H H.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,14,,1.0,8/14/2017,"I had dinner here Saturday evening and inadvertently left my credit card behind and this is when the nightmare ensues.  I called in at 10:30pm the following night to make arrangements to come by and pick up my card and I'm not exaggerating when I say, the phone rang 20 times before someone answered.  I knew that they were still opened because I had googled their hours and they were not closed for another 30 minutes.  I proceeded to inform the hostess that I left my credit card behind and gave her the necessary information for her to locate my card.  She then put me on hold and again I'm not exaggerating, for 15 minutes!  I decided that she must have forgotten about me and called back in. The second time, I let the hostess know that I had called earlier and someone left me on terminal hold.  She then told me she would need to put me on hold yet again.  I had a feeling I would get better results if I drive there and sure enough in the 11 minutes that I was on hold, I was able to drive to the mall, find parking and walk to restaurant.  In fact, when I got to the restaurant I told them that the person that they have on hold was actually me and showed them my cell phone which showed I had been on hold for over 11 minutes. I again informed the hostess that I left my credit card and asked to have the names of the managers who were working that night:  Mariana Lopez, Carlos Williams, Arianna Toledo and Wayne Maflin were the managers on duty that evening.  Yup, 4 managers and they still cannot get their act together.  Needless to say by this time, I've lost my patience.  Not one manager came out to address me but 10 minutes later, the hostess came out with my credit card.  I did not leave the restaurant until after the place was closing down.  Hence my Yelp review.   It is my personal belief that they were again understaffed that night as they had been the night before when I was dining there.  If they weren't, it wouldn't have taken 20 rings for someone to pick up the phone.  I would not have been placed on terminal hold twice for a combined total of 25 minutes and it wouldn't have taken them another 10 minutes to get me my credit card.   I have left my credit cards behind at other restaurants and none of them have been this horrific of an ordeal.  I call to tell them I'm coming to pick up my card, by the time I get there it's waiting for me and I'm in and out in less than 3 minutes.   Yes, it's my fault for leaving my card behind but I'm sure I'm not the first nor will I be the last to leave my card behind.  They seriously need to get their act together because this understaffing is going to severely affect their customer service, their Yelp reviews not to mention their repeated business.   Maybe the problem here is they don't care all that much about the regulars or the repeated business because they can survive on walk-in business from tourists?!?  Well if their reviews are low enough, they will lose some of that business as well.  I intend to post this review on TripAdvisor.  Hopefully someone in their corporate office will read this and care enough to make a difference in customer service.  It all starts at the top...if management sucks, if the restaurant is repeatedly understaffed, the service will suffer."
Cindy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,168,291,4.0,10/19/2016,"Cool spot ;) and yes the plates are big and good for sharing - recommend the mac and cheese balls 100%! Not sure why people all love the bread so much, they are not bad but not amazing! We were so full but felt the need to try the Cheesecake when you're at Cheesecake Factory so we went for the lime cheesecake (and added ice cream- yes they come with 2 scoops haha) (and the hot fudge too! It was phenomenal I must say- it's more dark chocolate that blended in so well with the whole dessert!)"
Samrana B.,"Los Angeles, CA",223,54,33,3.0,11/17/2017,"I can't believe the experience i just had. I'm usually so happy with this franchise especially because they have gluten free options. However, my server was not the best. I understand things are busy on a Saturday night but to constantly screw up is beyond me. I ordered a GF Americana Burger with a side of caesar salad, lemons for my water and a glass of Michelle Sparking wine. I had to ask for lemons 3 times the 4th time I got it from a different server who I pulled over. Finally the meal comes out and I asked for my wine again. Meal came out and the bun looked to good to be true and he brought me fries instead of the salad I requested. I saw a different server who appeared to be more higher up and told her that this isn't gluten free bun I am highly allergic. She apologized and grabbed the plate to go replace it. At this point I was over the experience and I'll just leave at that."
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,4.0,8/25/2016,"Forgot that they had Cheesecake Factory here & so we were quite excited to try a new location out. This space is actually quite big for being where it is. It's pretty too. Our servers name was Tyler & MAAAAAN did he look like Conor McGregor! I even asked him if he's gotten told that & he said quite often! I've included a picture in case ya'll are wondering lol. He was so nice & was such a good sport for my picture! Asked for the multi grain bread only & plenty of butter. I honestly could come here just for that. But I didn't, I ordered the Cajun chicken Littles! They're my favorite things to get at Cheesecake Factory (aside from the bread & cheesecake)  Every time came out pretty fast & was delicious! I'm sad to see other yelpers had such bad experiences though."
Vanessa Donna M.,"Burbank, CA",360,173,382,4.0,1/27/2017,"Just want to thank our server Alexander for his excellent customer service, his recommendations and attentiveness last night. As always the Chicken Costoletta was delicious and the Chicken Bellagio with fresh baby arugula and grated parmesan cheese was full of flavor."
Aaron B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",532,215,232,4.0,9/21/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory like most of the world at some point. However this is the first time I've eaten here with the intent to eat healthy...it seemed like a daunting task but I think I may have succeeded. After doing research and looking up calorie counts, ingredients, reviews, etc. I opted for the Tuscan Chicken dish on the Skinnylicious menu. I ordered this for take-out and was pleased by the simplicity and ease of the process. I arrived 15 minutes after ordering by phone and my meal was ready and payment was painless. I then ate about 10 minutes after that back at my office. The food honestly surprised me. For just under $20 I got a pretty substantial dish of chicken breasts, artichokes, a ton of tomatoes, and asparagus (I substituted the farro for more veggies). The flavor was great, albeit just a little salty. There was some more oil than hoped for too which made me doubt the ""under 590 calories"" claim of the menu, however.  That said, if I'm looking to experience some new flavors with a $20 budget and want to be pretty satisfied as far as portion-size goes, Cheesecake Factory isn't a bad option! If you're looking to eat healthy here just make sure to avoid the carb side options (potatoes, rices, etc.) and load up on veggies. I'll try more of the menu over time perhaps but as shot in the dark I'm pleased!"
Patrick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,35,35,4.0,11/20/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location was not on point with their food today. The service was phenomenal and very professional. The ambience with the low lighting and outside heating made for a romantic and comfortable evening. We ordered the buffalo wings, firecracker salmon, and factory chopped salad. The chopped salad was a little overdosed with dressing to the point where it overpowered all the other ingredients. The buffalo wings barely had any glaze and was borderline burnt versus being crispy. The firecracker salmon was the only dish that was on point and was amazing. It was a perfect dish with perfect presentation. Overall, nothing was disgusting but just fell a bit short to the usual level I experience as a frequent customer to this chain. I still highly recommend this place and believe that tonight's experience was a fluke. You must try the firecracker salmon!"
Teresa N.,"Granada Hills, CA",25,6,1,5.0,8/20/2017,"I had my birthday dinner here and I had a great experience. Party of 10 with kids and a baby. I was nervous about the customer service from reading the reviews, but I had a very attentive waiter who made sure our needs were met and was almost always in view in case we needed something. Thanks! I think so long as you're not in a rush, you're enjoying the meal conversation, and you're polite to your wait staff, then you'll hopefully have a good experience here!"
Zinaida R.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",2,6,10,5.0,2/28/2017,The beast - banana cheesecake all people should try)) And really cool view from this place)
Siamrath B.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,390,1002,5.0,8/8/2016,"Oh my, reading other people's reviews and I feel bad they all seem to have had such an awful time.  Myself and my family on the other hand was okay with how everything came out and was impressed by a few things.  I forgot the name of our waiter but he wasn't that bad. With the occasional leaving our table unattended for a slight prolonged amount of time, the service was great.  It's weird to hear my mom praise anything that is western food but right off the bat she really enjoyed the whole wheat-oat bread. One thing I have learned is to always trust my mom's palate. Like mother like son, the bread truly was good. Is it weird that the first thing they put down for starters would foreshadow the rest of our meal? My aunt was feeling for some orange juice so she got that while my little brother got Diet Coke and the rest of us got water. Water service was great, other than the Diet Coke our water was always filled in a timely fashion. As appetizers we ordered the baked mac and cheese and wings. The wings looked dry when you look at them, but they were alright. I was impressed with the baked mac and cheese balls, that came with a nice serving of marinara sauce. It was delicious. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya just because I ordered it before. I forgot what my little brother ordered but we ordered miso salmon, herb crusted salmon, and then charbroiled steak.  The miso salmon is the only one I do not recommend. Although the salmon was cooked really well, the amount of sugar in the dish was just so unappetizing to me. My dad who loves sugar even thought it was too sweet. The rest of the dish was good. Oh I also ran into two of my high school friends which was neat.  Overall great place to eat. I had a great time. We ended it with a nice serving of cheese cake with a little ice cream on the side."
Lauren M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",315,10,1,2.0,11/22/2017,Don't order to go because you will wait FOREVER. I used to always order on Postmates Until they got my order wrong and refuse to make me a new pasta aft r DRIVING to the location. Employees are snooty and rude and you have to search and search ffor your host. Beautiful views but horrid service
Kaleo C.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,24,15,3.0,5/21/2017,"The menu is extensive but it always takes forever for everything. At this very moment, we've been here for 20 min, and we haven't gotten bread or our drinks and we see our server through the glass talking to another server laughing. Maybe they are talking about our order (I'm trying to be optimistic).  Luckily, another server saw us concerned and delivered our items. Jose, their new server, was amazing and was very attentive.  The atmosphere is pretty if you sit outside. There are heaters and booths available.  Have fun!!"
Sabina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,5,,1.0,12/28/2017,"I usually never think Cheesecake Factory is overpriced because of the large portions and decent food. But this location is pretty bad, I took my parents a while back and to start out the hosts are extremely rude, service is ok but not even close to good enough for the prices they charge. They need WAY better management. I'm going to keep going to the Marina Del Rey location instead."
Brianetta N.,"Washington, DC",280,20,11,4.0,7/16/2017,The design of the restaurant is very nice! I guess you can say they have an outdoor rooftop patio along with indoor seating!  Service here is nice and the food is even better! 5 stars for the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Chicken Marsala
Jaron L.,"Lahaina, HI",61,3,,2.0,11/2/2017,"The food is fine, like any other Cheesecake Factory. However, the wait you'll experience is day/evening killing. The food always takes over an hour to get to your table, even if your one of a few people in the restaurant. There are much better, less time consuming places to eat on the promenade, don't waste your night here."
Victoria T.,"Goleta, CA",0,12,5,2.0,7/9/2017,"I enjoy Cheesecake Factory, but I think this location is subpar. I have visited this location twice, once back in February and once today. In February, my friend, husband, and I visited on a busy night. The wait to sit actually wasn't too bad, but it was a nightmare after that. Our waiter disappeared, we waited for our food for over an hour, several managers came to apologize for the wait. Also had to wait another half hour for the check. We were never comped and it was a bad experience. Food was just okay. 1 star for that experience.  I thought I would never come back to this location, but I was in the mood for Cheesecake Factory for my birthday today and this was the closest location. Parking is also cheap here too. We went before the lunch rush. We were seated quickly. I ordered my favorite dish (Chicken Di Pana) but this location either doesn't carry it or the franchise decided to stop serving it. That was disappointing, but I found something else on the menu. Took a while for the drinks. We got our appetizer before the bread. Then waited for a while. Manager apologized for the wait again. I don't understand why there was a wait because we were there before the restaurant was busy. Food was good, but then had to wait twenty minutes after our meal to get to go boxes and pay the bill. Better service than the previous time, but still 3 stars for this experience. Cheesecake Factory has large portions and pretty good food, but the service at this location is subpar and you will end up waiting a long time."
Julianna C.,"Newark, DE",1,61,32,5.0,8/28/2017,Only stopped in for cheese cake and a drink. We sat at the bar. It was around 3 pm on a Saturday and there was a huge wait outside. The bar tenders were friendly and quick. Cheese cake of course was delicious. I would highly recommend going but I'm not sure it's worth the wait since there are so many other great restaurants nearby.
Jordyn L.,"Westlake Village, CA",75,232,43,1.0,11/23/2016,"Got sat by a clearly unhappy and very rude hostess (blue eyeshadow is pretty unprofessional to wear at a restaurant as well).  We sat at our table for about 10 minutes with multiple waiters, bussers and hosts passing by. We were not greeted, given waters, or even acknowledged at all. MIND YOU, this is 4:00 pm, a very slow time for restaurants. I finally pulled the hostess aside (since we were sat about 15 feet from her podium) and asked if anyone planned on helping us. She said she would ask, but then just scurried over to the computer. Finally after about 15 minutes a waitress came over. We were able to put in our entire order in, but we still didn't receive our drinks until about five minutes later. I'm usually a pretty big fan of Cheesecake Factory, but the employees here really miss the mark on customer service."
Darlene H.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,12,5,5.0,2/15/2017,"So far so good, got a seat outside. The view was nice and very romantic for me and my hubby. Our server has been sweet and very attentive. I give it four stars, because our food hasn't come out yet. BTW, This has to be the nicest cheese cake I've been to. So disappointed in my Louisiana chicken pasta. Noodles were under cooked, dry and too salty. My sweet waitress brought me more sauce, which helped.  My hubby got the Jambalaya Pasta, he said it was delicious. So I'm going to put 5 stars."
