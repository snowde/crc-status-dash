Persila N.,"Irvine, CA",670,396,594,4.0,11/23/2015,"This location just opened in the Santa Monica Mall on the top floor.  It actually has a very nice space and classiness to it.  On a Saturday night we had a wait of an hour for a party of 8.  However, this is pretty standard for any Cheesecake Factory location regardless of when they opened.  I guess I can't really complain about that one but I was mildly irritated.  I do have to say that as soon as we were seated though, they already had bread and butter on the table waiting for us.  That was a very nice touch and at least helped ease our hunger until our meals arrived.  Our server provided great service.  He brought out waters immediately, and was patient with us with the ordering process.  He came to check on us several times and was very friendly.  There are many good items here.  I recommend the chicken madeira, chicken piccata, chicken marsala, the chicken salad sandwich, the bbq chicken pizza, most of the salads, bistro shrimp pasta, tex mex egg rolls, avocado egg rolls, the factory burrito grande, salmon, skinnylicious shrimp and angel hair pasta, and more.  The new Skinnylicious menu they have actually has a good variety of items for those that are trying to be health-conscious.  I think this restaurant is a great addition to the Santa Monica mall-especially given the fact that none of the other restaurants at the top floor have fared very well here minus Sonoma wine Garden and Pizza Antica.  I can't imagine that Cheesecake Factory will have a problem bringing in business.  I recommend ending the meal with a classic strawberry cheesecake."
Francine B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,73,,3.0,2/4/2016,"Do not expect any kind of decent service here. So many things happened I don't even know where to start. The wrong things coming early, drinks coming late, people forgetting we were there, it was simply chaos. It's like there's no staff training whatsoever. And when you ask for help from anyone else but your server, they either totally ignore you or say they'll get something and they don't. I'm giving it three stars instead of two because the food was still quite good, and the location is superb. I'm a little bummed that the restaurants that used to be in the space were gone, but I think if she's Cheesecake can get its service together, this will do quite well"
Paria S.,"Austin, TX",510,5,,4.0,3/15/2016,Food is great. Louisiana chicken pasta is my favorite. Staff is friendly. Location is great and convenient
Dan D.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/30/2016,"The worst service in Santa Monica. Food was cold. The Manager is the most arrogant person in the restaurant and couldn't cate about the customers. I would suggest look for any other options.  Managers response as to why service was so bad ""well its Saturday and its always like this"""
Cat M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,90,,1.0,4/13/2016,"I was surprised how poorly this Cheesecake Factory is managed. Even when no one is in the restaurant, they make you wait a long time. We waited so long and the restaurant was empty! The manager made us feel that we were inconveniencing her..like her time to help me was so precious!  Forget it! With so many terrific eating options in Santa Monica, why would I want to wait for The Cheesecake Factory?!  My time is precious too Cheesecake Factory! Poor management and customer service! Doesn't the headquarters care about all of these poor reviews and their customers?  Maybe not?!"
Frank T.,"Santa Monica, CA",11,37,74,5.0,8/29/2016,"We went for a dinner Saturday night.  The little one doesn't share my taste but doesn't know what to order so I had to take a stab and order something I thought he may like.   He didn't like it very much (it really wasn't very good, I cannot remember the name) but the waitress (Christina!!) checked on us and I mentioned to her that the little one is not thrilled with his dinner and she happily changed it for us at no charge.  The picky one loved his pasta and meatball and all was well.  We really appreciate the good service and we will go back again."
Taylor L.,"West Hills, CA",39,4,,1.0,9/23/2016,Terrible service. Tried to get a cake for my buddies birthday. Took way too long and our waiter left on break without our notice. New waiter comes back and ruins the surprise asking us if we ordered the cake. Terrible experience.
Nikki H.,"Valencia, CA",0,26,10,1.0,7/21/2016,"We decided to go to dinner at this location for my moms birthday celebration last night. We, as a family, go to a Cheesecake factory location a few times a month and have always had a great experience. This was our first time at the Santa Monica Location. We were extremely disappointed and frustrated with our experience from start to finish. We were greeted by the hostess, who was rude and had no personality, she looked miserable and we felt quite unwelcome. When we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes until a server even acknowledged our table. While waiting we noticed that the silverware was dirty and a couple of our bread and butter plates on our table were dirty as well. When she finally greeted us, she threw the beverage napkins on the table and took our drink order. The drinks finally arrived after 10 minutes, one of the water glasses had dried spinach on it, after we pointed it out, she took it away and said she would bring another. I asked if she had any straws on her, she said no I don't and walked away. I wasn't sure if I was going to get a straw with that response. Five minutes later, she arrives again with a new glass of water, with no spinach and a few straws. She took our order and then the waiting began. It took almost 30 minutes for our food. Our food slowly staggered to the table, approximately 5-10 minutes in between each drop and there was 7 of us at the table. As each meal arrived we noticed that there were some issues. We noticed that my mom's pizza was cold, my husbands turkey burger had onions all over it and no mushrooms and a different bun than what he usually has with it. My brothers skinny turkey burger arrived a little after my husbands with a different bun than my husbands and had mushrooms and he was missing his side of double vegetables. My brothers wife's Kobe burger arrived over cooked. She ordered it medium, it was definitely well done and it had a sesame bun. She said she always orders that burger and it has never come with a sesame seed bun. The manager, his name is Keith, happened to be walking by, so I raised my hand nicely and gestured in our direction to come over. I wanted to tell him what has happened. First thing he says to me is, ""its rude to point"", then laughs. Not a good first impression. We all did not find this funny as we were quite frustrated at this point. We told him what happened and he said, ""well did you tell your server?"" (why did that matter?) I said ""no, I saw you walking by and decided to go to the source, as we have quite a few issues."" . He said ""ok what do you need?"" We began to go through the list of issues. He said ""ok I will get a new Kobe burger in five minutes cooked medium, a side of double vegetables, a new bun for your husband"" (turns out my husbands hamburger bun was gluten free. He had ordered the french fries gluten free so we can share, but he can have gluten, so the bun was not necessary)... ""anything else?"" We told him that we needed more ketchup and my mom's pizza was cold. He asked if she wanted another, she said no, he said ""okay we'll take care of that pizza for you on the bill. Ill be back with everything in 5 minutes."" I noticed him walking around and not in the kitchen, where he should be, getting these issues fixed for our table.  After 15 minutes we inquired about the re-fires on the fly from our server, she ended up coming out of the kitchen with the new bun for my husband as his turkey burger was freezing cold at this point, we didn't bother saying anything.  Over 30 minutes go by since the Kobe burger was taken back, we stopped the manager again to ask about the Kobe burger and veggies, he said ""you still didn't get it"" and walks away. After going to the kitchen, a few minutes later, here comes my brothers wife's Kobe burger, still overcooked and still on a sesame seed bun. My brother waited for his wife to eat, so he was now eating a freezing cold skinny turkey burger 30 minutes later, with still no vegetables in site. About 45 minutes later after our food first dropped comes out a tiny side of vegetables. What a disappointing dinner that was. Everyone ate at separate times and did not enjoy their food. We have been sitting for almost two hours at this point we wanted the check and to just leave.  The manager gets our table a free cheesecake, big deal. Took 30 minutes to arrive. We were there for about 3 hours. NIGHTMARE!!!  Horrible service, management is just awful! Ended up paying over $100 at the end of the day for a miserable dinner and bad service....we just wanted the nightmare to end! We remained quite calm through all of this, it honestly felt like a joke, what can you do but laugh....and then yelp about it. Me and my husband are servers, have been serving for over 15 years, we get that sh*! happens! But its all in how you handle it and how you finished. Horribly handled, finished even worse! Stay away, even the servers know that this place is messed up! Got to The Misfits right down the street!"
Philly H.,"Pasadena, CA",16,11,2,5.0,5/8/2016,I took my wife and family for Mother's Day I was reading some negative reviews but gave it a chance. I must say..Emil was the best waiter you could ever want. Meals were hot ..served quick and his attention to detail was awesome.  Great ambiance and will be back! One block from the pier made it a complete day! Nice job CF!
Lauren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/29/2016,"Great location! Beautiful restaurant! Wonderful staff :)  It can get very busy, being such a huge restaurant. But I was very happy with the way my family was taken care of. We had a party of 7 and it only took about 30 minutes on a Saturday for us to be sat. Ashley was our waitress and she was there to greet us with a smile and take our drink order almost instantly. The delicious bread followed right away and all our food came out rather quickly and all of it was delicious! Ashley checked in on us regularly and took very good care of us. We were celebrating a birthday and a group sang and we all shared the salted caramel cheesecake! It was to die for! Not sure about all the negative reviews, but we will definitely be coming back!"
Sweet H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,47,1,1.0,11/19/2016,The customer service at this restaurant is the absolute worst. They never have a measure available and the manager that is available always needs to ask the general manager want to do do you land wasting a lot of time. Very poor service and the food is always cold. They really need to get more general managers and take care of the customers is that it depending on location.
Zehna G.,"Torrey Hills, San Diego, CA",226,10,1,1.0,11/4/2016,"Okay food (once done right) but the service and time to get the food was EXTREMELY slow. We ordered a burger and pasta and it took us about an hour and a half to get our food. Upon being served, the pasta dish was completely cold. The manager apologized but after finally getting and finishing the food, it took another 30 minutes to get the waitress to give us our check, even after asking twice. I can say with one hundred percent certainty we will not be returning here for lunch."
Paris C. K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,13,1,4.0,3/27/2016,The food is amazing. But more unhealthy than anything ever in history. I mean I could go to inn out and go crazy and it'll be about he same thing. Still a winner though.
Steve H.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,53,1,1.0,11/6/2015,Slow service. Lots of people running around. Long wait for any service. Waiter needs to come back more frequently. 35 minutes just to get bread and our drinks. Order for food took also some more time. People running all over the place. I dont get it.
Lauren M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,6,3.0,9/14/2016,The water was warm. Asked for water 3 times. I had a question about a plate and told me it wasnt good and very greasy i ended up having it and it wasnt terrible i had the veggie melt. I normally get the sweet cake tamale. Those are amazing and i always get that plate but it wasnt avaliable. The server was just a bit slow and no enthusiasm..
Dana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,12,21,1.0,1/1/2016,"Waited an hour for a table! Then the buzzer goes off so we proceed to the counter where Veronica or Jen(managers on duty) were very rude to my party! Tell us to wait over there as if I was an ingrate. Then when eventually are taken to the table it's NOT CLEAN!!!! We are asked to stand by the table and no one ever comes to clean it! So we stand there. Then I was fuming by then so I go back to the counter on the mall side. Tell them what happened and Jen or Veronica tell Maria(the hostess) to handle it!!! Maria had no idea how to handle this so my son sits at the first of many tables that were open. They clean it ok I guess. Then another party is going to be seated at the same table, talk about awkward. So we sit then nobody comes to take our order so we have to ask for service....so tired and hungry by now!!! There's more but I'm eating my nachos now....ugh"
Donna C.,"Santa Monica, CA",62,2,5,1.0,1/9/2016,"We came by around 2:30 PM on a Sunday and the restaurant wasn't busy. We wanted to order take out since we had our baby with us. We ordered a burger, a lunch special pasta, and a red velvet cheesecake. We were told it would be about 20 minutes. After 25 minutes pass by my husband goes up to the desk to ask if the food was ready. They said they were waiting for the pasta to be ready.  45 minutes later we FINALLY get our food. Keep in mind...the place was practically empty. No one apologized to us...in fact the lady behind the counter seemed irritated that we asked how much longer we had to wait after 30 minutes.  We decided today to give this place another try because we figured they just opened and they were still working out some kinks. NOPE!! Once again we ordered take out. This time a salad and the Jamaican Shrimp. The wait wasn't as long as last time (about 20 minutes). When we got home we realized THEY FORGOT THE DRESSING to our salad AND the bread. WTF! Get it together! Management really needs to get their staff in order."
Mo M.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,16,1,2.0,7/30/2016,The worst Cheesecake Factory we ever ate. We frequent Cheesecake Factories often.  There was a guy outside holding a sign saying this is the worst Cheesecake Factory in the US.  I thought how could this be.  We ate there and he was correct.  My daughter puked her food.  The waitress did not even acknowledge that.
Fox L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",29,4,3,3.0,11/9/2016,"my first time ever at the cheesecake factory. they have quite a large menu and looks like you can find just about anything you may be craving, but the service staff here is very slow. it took about 10 minutes after we sat down to be greeted and take ny drink order. the staff seems very nice, but not very patient."
Jennifer F.,"Santa Monica, CA",76,75,7,2.0,1/29/2016,"Kinda meh.  Came here for lunch and everything was slow...took like 10-15 for a server to come and take our order.  Then bread came out...then waters...finally after 20 minutes our high chair came (they were ""looking for one""..restaurant was nearly empty when we got there!).  Any parent of a toddler knows 20 minutes without anyway to restrain your child at a restaurant feels like an hour!  Food was ok but honestly the service you get in marina del Rey is so much better."
