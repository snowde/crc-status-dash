Ryan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,5,3,1.0,11/17/2015,"I  really wish I could've given at least 4 stars. I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to many of them. Never have I ever been anywhere with such poor service. I timed it - from the time I was seated to the time we were acknowledged by our waiter was 16 minutes. Take in mind it was 9:30 - not busy at all.  Also we were seated at a half booth and we kindly asked the hostess that was seating us if we could get a booth. She said ""that might be difficult as we will have to walk back up to the front to see where we can seat you"" totally unacceptable.  Not only did my menu have food and grease in it but so did my friends.  Food is consistent however service is the worst I have ever seen. I always see the manager going back and forth not quite sure what he's doing?  The solution to this problem is hire senior wait staff and waiters that care and don't congregate in one area and hang out.  The manager doesn't seem to care how poorly run this location is however I'm sure the owners would."
T. O.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2016,"I have never had worse service at a restaurant. Walked in and was told a 20 min wait for the patio, I pointed out an empty table and she said there was a wait. I said cool. 30 mins later we are sat at the same empty table.  We order our food and a hour goes by and the manager comes out and says they burnt my food and had to start over. Meanwhile people with dogs are being sat all around us after the hostess told two people earlier that only service dogs were allowed...these dogs were not service dogs in fact they barked their heads off through our whole meal.  When our food finally came it was mediocre and not cheesecake quality. The salad was wilted and the food that was ""burnt and all new"" had half of the burnt pieces in it and was way too salty. Meanwhile, another tables had half their main courses delayed by 20mins while the other half got their food.  The table next to us ordered chicken wings and they were raw and bloody...unfortunately the guy was half way through his meal when they discovered the raw pieces. When the bill came 2 hours after we sat down, they didn't remove or discount anything for the horribly slow service and disgusting food. I will never eat there again. I hope other locations haven't gone down hill."
Santa M.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,115,7,5.0,1/10/2016,"Writing a review because we actually had a nice time here, with excellent service. Yes, it's a Cheesecake Factory, so there are no surprises. Food was well prepared. Service was attentive. Atmosphere as expected. A good standby at the mall."
Greg K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/25/2016,"Is there any possible way I could rate this place lower than one star? Worst location I've been to. Always the best cheese cake & food but HORRIBLE service. We didn't get straws, they forgot my drink & they gave me the wrong size portion of food."

Laura V.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,28,4,3.0,3/15/2016,Good was okay. I had the Mac and cheese burger. Service was very slow. Great seats and view ! All my friends rated their food 3
Brian A.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,7,,5.0,12/29/2015,"Considering how much setting there is and how small the kitchen staff is, Cheesecake Factory brought an above par time and quality of food. I will definitely be back for more later!"
Yen X.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,67,,1.0,7/25/2016,"I am shock this location was so bad. I have been to the one in Santa Anita Fashion mall and I thought that was bad enough.  Well, over the weekend (Sat) we went for a late lunch. Me and my kids along with my ex. We were ask either sit inside or outside. Inside as a longer wait. Well, they called us and walked us all the way to the back and outside. We told the server we asked to sit inside and she confirmed and apologize because the front desk messed up. Said we can wait and talk to the manager for an inside seating. It was such a mess and we were blocking the way so we said ok to sitting outside. It was hot but there were a fan above us and covers so it was not bad. Our server was quick....so quick she took the order, drop our drinks and no straw for me and never came back until we had to flag her down. Our appetizer of calamari cam quick. soft, great batter but super salty....did they forgot to clean off all the salt? I still enjoy it until the server came and just grabbed some that we were still eating and left. Our food came in good time.....just I did not get any dressing for my salad. I asked for some and the girl look at me like ""you want dressing with your salad?"" look.....I said yes, I like some Ranch. Got that pretty quick and I spent quite a bit of time picking out he rotten pieces out of the salad....they were from a bag and the cook did not even bother to check how bad there were...dont worry I was able to get about 10-15% of edible ones. My ex got the Mahi (tuna) salad and it was so bad he had like 20% total eaten and this guy eats alot. We were done pretty quick, not because we were full, but the food was so bad. However our server gone missing for about 20mins and came running back saying there was some emergency......we got our check, paid and left. It was overall bad...from service to food, to how expensive it was....Try any other food place around but stay away from this one...if you go here for the sweet..that is different..I do think their cakes are quite good."
Chris H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/6/2016,WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I have ever experienced. We waited 50 Minutes for a table and we were placed outside on the patio despite our request to eat inside.  The bread that was served would have been enjoyed more by my DOG. My Cajun Jumbalaya pasta was crunchy and chewy and the vegetables were still raw. My bill for this nonsense was $62.50.  I paid $80 cash and the waitress FORGOT MY CHANGE!!!  I WILL NEVER RETURN!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HORRIBLE FOOD I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! The manager was NO HELP AT ALL!!!! I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Enrique R.,"Whittier, CA",7,2,1,1.0,3/19/2016,Had a real shit waiters. Toke a long time for her to come to get the drink order. She had this look like she did not want to be waiting on us because I was with my wife and kids. Or maybe because we were Mexican. Who knows but it was bad service. Never come back to this location.
BF S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,119,43,4.0,11/11/2015,"would give five stars if it weren't for a couple things. the music was so incredibly loud it hurt my ears and worse our waiter couldn't hear us and vice versa. we shouted our order and when we got our salad to share we asked for plates and spoons. the runner who brought it looked at us like we were nuts or maybe he couldn't hear what we asked for I'm not sure. The Caesar salad was garlicky and delicious, the fried Mac n Cheese balls were great. The entrees were standard not bad just not overwhelming."
Hassan A.,"Edmond, OK",0,7,1,2.0,7/12/2016,"I love this restaurant and i have always eats  there, but this one was not good. The wait time was too long even though there was empty tables. The waitress I'm not gonna say her name but her attitude was so bad with us also, we ordered our food well done and it came out rare in the middle and done in the sides, and i hate my self now cause of going there."
Jamiesha M.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,1,1.0,1/9/2016,"The service is ok and the food quality is not up to standard I have visited this location various times and tried to give them and opportunity to redeem themselves, however my visit today will be my last. My food was cold and my order was incomplete missing the tempura asparagus that came with my meal. So my plate was sent back to the kitchen where the plate was warmed but my food was still the same temperature and still incomplete when it was brought back to me.  Nonetheless I was very disappointed with my experience at the Santa Monica location I hope they make the necessary improvements because this location is most convenient for me but due to their service I can not support them at this time."
Ricky G.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,9,2.0,12/12/2015,This would probably be acceptable food if I went to Norms and paid half as much money. Underwhelming at best.
Briana A.,"Aptos, CA",0,11,,5.0,6/27/2016,I was here just last week and enjoyed a delicious pineapple mojito w the egg plater sampler. Delicious recommendation from our lovely waitress. We actually had two waitresses because she stepped out for a break and our second waitress was a doll as well. Very satisfied w my experience and I can't wait to come back down and have another mojito
Sabrina K.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",21,48,31,1.0,2/3/2016,"I'm not one to ever complain about cheese cake factory because I've always had such marvelous service. This is the first time I've had such horrible experience.  First off, they have such a large variety of food choices to pick off of. Great food great atmosphere. Yeah... NOT THIS LOCATION!  We were a group of 6 and we were seated within 15 mins. Let me tell you... We were not acknowledged for at least 20 mins. Not even offered water while we wait for our server. After 20 mins, finally this rude server decides to take our drink order and didn't even introduce herself or point out the fact we've been waiting server-less for that long to apologize and help the situation.  Anywho, as were waiting for our drinks, we all noticed our utensils were absolutely disgusting. Probably never even washed. There was food stuck in between my fork and they smelled oily and the sanitation was plain out gross. I asked the server for plastic utensils and she rudely and quickly collected the dirty ones and gave us attitude to top it off. HAHA. Not only that pissed us off but she even was pointing and talking about us amongst other servers. I just couldn't believe it."
Kaoutar T.,"Casablanca, Spain",0,4,,5.0,1/3/2016,Amazing service.  Amazing food. They made a mistake adding bacon to my club sandwich but changed it in one second and brought me a whole new fresh one. Best customer service i have ever experienced.  Our waiter Daniel was very very nice.  Happy customer.
Tiffany O.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/9/2016,"Usually Cheesecake Factory Restaurants are consistently good, but this location has excessive wait times, a lackadaisical staff that acts like they will never see you again (I guess that's because of all of the tourists but locals go to the mall too), and a kitchen that doesn't change out the oil in the fryers and can't guarantee cross contamination. How hard is it to use a clean pan? This local won't be returning. I guess I will have to get my cheesecake fix somewhere else."
Robin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,2/22/2016,"If zero stars was an option, I would mark this review as that. I've been going to Cheesecake Factory my whole life. It's always been a great experience as you always know what to expect. It was my first time visiting the new Santa Monica location and I will guarantee that I will not return. I went in on my lunch break and it seemed a bit quiet. No wait, was seated as soon as I walked in. I waited about 10 minutes for my server to arrive to greet me. I placed my order for my meal and for a glass of water. I was brought a basket of very dry bread (I usually love their brown pumpernickel bread), but still no drink. It took him an additional 20 minutes to deliver my water.  I was then brought my entree immediately after my water which was extremely underwhelming. As the entree was placed on the table, the person who brought my food noticed that my table was wobbly. They notified my server who came by and let me know that he was going to fix it. He brought over some napkins to place under the table, without even asking me if he could crawl under the table while I was eating. He would rock the table to the point where my water almost spilled on me multiple times, no warning at all. Was this actually happening? I ordered a veggie burger wrapped in lettuce. The veggie burger seemed undercooked and completely soft. It was impossible to hold it to eat, and almost impossible to eat with a fork as it kept falling apart. It also came with a tomato that looked like it was chewed and spit out, and red onions that were cut extremely thick - not sure who would ever eat them that way. Also the actual veggie burger tasted like it was put on a grill that had never been cleaned - had a funky taste. Very disappointed."
