Stephanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,6,3,1.0,2/12/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory  but the hostess are really rude!!! They always take forever to get a reserve to my table. My food is sometimes so salty or they get my order wrong.
Brittany G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",5,38,37,1.0,1/29/2016,"I have been to a few cheesecake factory's and I have always had a good time. The food is decent and the prices are decent. I went to this location for the first time and the service was not that great. Everyone got their meals except for my fiance who just ordered the chili. His ended up taking 20 minutes more so he was sitting there while everyone else was eating their pastas. Also the bar is horrible. I ordered a long island, but basically paid $12 for a lemonade with too much sugar in it. That is what it tasted like at least which makes no sense to me. I definitely wont be coming back to this location."
Paul F.,"Rescue, CA",1,53,46,3.0,2/14/2016,"Always enjoy the menu at Cheesecake Factory.  It's pretty expansive.  We had a 12 person group so it took awhile to get our food. Mine was obviously sitting out under the lamps for a long time.   I had the jambalaya which was not as spicy as I like.  It was a bit dry due to sitting around.  Egg roll appetizer was very good.  I would definitely recommend it.  Had the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was delicious.  As long as you have 3 hours to hang out, go for it.  This location was a very busy one so plan ahead.  Very nice outdoor patio dining area was comfortable."
Rachel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/29/2016,"Like some of the other reviewers I don't understand the horrible ratings. We went on a Saturday morning, there was no wait for inside, perhaps people had read Yelp! The wait staff was fine, we didn't have to ask for bread and the food was standard Cheesecake Factory food, which is a good thing if you like Cheesecake Factory food. I had the Thai Glazed Salmon which tasted exactly the same as the Thai Glazed Salmon I ordered at the Cheesecake factory in Pasadena. Looked the same too. I hope this location makes it, we love to shop and finish up with a treat and the kids menu pleases my kids."
Alma T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,45,5,4.0,1/18/2016,"Really enjoy the new location, the patio view in the back of the restaurant is just lovely! I'm use to waiting over an hour to dine here so was surprised to be seated within 10 minutes. Had a great waitress, very attentive. Food and drinks were good. Definitely will come back again."
Ashley C.,"West Covina, CA",50,136,166,4.0,1/15/2016,I was here yesterday i had the black pepper shrimp - But chicken only. It was really good. They have done a great job incorporating CF into the mall it reminds you of century city mall now
Asle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,64,17,4.0,1/30/2016,"We got fried shrimp platter and thai-glazed salmon, and both were very good...portions were good, too... Wait time was about 20 minutes... Good service... Reasonable prices..."
Jake T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,2,5.0,11/13/2015,"My first experience here was okay, rude waiter and slow service, but this second visit changed me. I am gluten free dairy free, so eating out is a challenge. The waitress had me talk to the manager, which gave me some GF DF options. I saw a dish I loved that had gluten, but he made it work. He replaced a wheat bun with gluten free bread and made the breaded chicken just grilled. He made it double the size also, and took it off the bill for time inconvenience. I also ordered a salmon special that had mashed potatoes and a dairy sauce, which was put on the side and replaced my fries. Overall, this was the best Cheesecake Factory experience ever, and I really appreciate the generosity. I also want to thank the cheesecake staff. Thanks guys, really appreciate it!"
Joseph C.,"Irvine, CA",1,7,3,4.0,1/17/2016,"This is the largest Cheesecake Factory I have visited. Very nice and the view on the patio was pleasantly unexpected. Food is always good here. The menu is huge, it like reading a book. If you find yourself visiting 3rd street and the pier, you won't regret stopping here."
Sondee O.,"Vista, CA",150,18,,2.0,1/12/2016,"I usually like the Cheesecake Factory. The service was slow and not very good. It took forever to get a waiter, then drinks were a long time and food. Then the check was impossible to get and we had an appt. to get to. I won't go back to this restaurant."
Kayla K.,"University, Minneapolis, MN",2,4,2,1.0,12/28/2015,"Literally the WORST experience I have ever had at a cheesecake restaurant. The waiters were rude, the bar manager was extremely rude and talked backed to me. There was meat in my vegetarian dish and everything was so unprofessional. I work everyday in this area and will NOT be coming back ever again."
Joyous A.,"Culver City, CA",1,12,1,1.0,7/6/2016,"RUDE!  (This review is not about the food, but the service/management).  I called to get info on hosting a party there and was put on hold to wait for the ""manager.""  After a few minutes of holding, the phone was picked up by a curt female shouting ""YES?!"" in a very angry tone.  I could barely get my question out about having a large group of people come and she slams down the phone.  Who does that?!  If the answer was no, it doesn't take more than 15 seconds to say they don't deal with things like that.  If I wanted unwarranted disgusted attitude, I would just call my angry chinese mom, not the cheesecake factory!  I'm just going to conclude that this place is managed by a terrible person and never go there.  Ever."
Kandace N.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",308,52,19,4.0,11/28/2015,"It was my first time being at this brand new restaurant and it was very nice compared to the other cheesecake factory's that I have gone too. It is in a great area and the restaurant is very big. The food was great as usual but the service was not the best. They were very busy but our waiter was confused and took a very long time to bring the things that we needed. However, overall I had a good experience here."
Mayuri C.,"Irvine, CA",43,6,23,5.0,12/6/2015,"Great service , amazing food, we got seated at our preferred seat, the staff was very patient and cordial. Keep up the good work folks!!"
Ann B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,5,3.0,7/1/2016,Very confusing experience during happy hour. The hostess told me that happy hour was at the bar and the tables surrounding the bar. There are  tables/booths in the bar area that face the bar. There were a lot of these empty tables so I sat there and waited for my teenage son to join me. The hostess promptly runs over and rudely says that this isn't part of the bar and there is no self seating. I asked her if she wanted me to move she said no I could stay there since the restaurant is not full. 10 minutes before happy hour is over the waiter brings over the happy hour menu and says that happy hour was going to be over in 10 minutes if i wanted to order that I should do it now. What?? Just at that moment a table of three women at the next table and also wanted to order from the happy hour menu. It seems that this area can either be switched over to non-happy hour if the restaurant is busy. Come on  cheesecake factory - don't be stingy just make this area part of the bar (it clearly looks like it's part of the bar) and just deal with it till 6 o'clock when happy hour is over. They could  build a lot of goodwill towards their restaurant instead leaving their customers with a bad taste in their mouth.
Vanessa J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/17/2015,"Love!!! This Cheesecake Factory location, food and staff! This location is perfect for getting your belly full and working off those carbs with some AMAZING retail therapy"
Maria S.,"Rialto, CA",27,7,,1.0,11/23/2015,Don't even know where to start.. We first arrived and we are about to be seated when the host noticed the table was dirty made us stand on the side while he cleaned the table we notice the table across  was opened I asked him to sit us there and he refused. Finally got the table cleaned after 5-10 mins of waiting .. Asked him to bring a diffrent chair and we'll he never came back.. Our food was taken by the waiter which was the only one that had it together her name is Charom. Our food finally came out was not warm at all my daughters food was wrong..we called the first manager Joe..he seem to help us out .. Our waiter went on break we waited for the checks to be picked up and covering waiter Dakota came to pick them up she left took 15 min to come back with our change in the mean while Charom had came back from break Dakota was nowhere to be found finally she came back with our change. She approached me and said sorry for taking 5 min I said no you took longer this is when she started arguing with me while in the presence of the manager she turned around and called me a bitch. Really the waiter was so out of line.. You can bet corporate is getting a call..bad service all the way around!!never coming back here. READ MOST OF THE COMMENTS THEY ALL SAY THE SERVICE IS BAD..
David P.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,37,4.0,7/17/2016,"The server I had, had good service. He made sure to check up on constantly and constantly took care of us. I ordered chopped salad with chicken. It contained bacon, tomatoes and some other good things in it. The food tasted good. The one thing I did not like about this place was the amount of customers and the wait. We waited 20 min for our table and was at the restaurant for nearly 2 hours. Other than that, the place was good"
Shane S.,"Santa Monica, CA",10,15,4,5.0,12/19/2015,"Girlfriend and I went in Saturday around noon. The hostess did great we were seated as soon as we walked in. Drink orders were taken and filled with in 5 mins of being seated. Krystin our server on the front patio was kind and very helpful. We were brought drinks and appetizers by other waiting staff cups and dishes were removed by busers, EVERYONE was awesome. The fried mac and cheese, veggie burger, and club sandwich was fantastic. She informed us the kitchen was slightly backed up. From my point of view everything was brought out in a timely manner. Krsyten was also popping back to check on us she was awesome!"
Katya S.,"Croydon, United Kingdom",0,3,,1.0,7/7/2016,"Great food, terrible customer service. I went there with a friend yesterday and we sat outside and ordered a slice of cheesecake each. We waited for 25 minutes and it never came. Bearing in mind the cheesecakes are already made and all they need to do is put a slice on a plate and bring it to you, we were astonished at how long we were made to wait. We asked (who I assume was) the manager if it would take much longer, and she just kept saying 'your server will be with you soon'. Since we had somewhere to be and almost half an hour had passed, we got up and were about to make our way inside (where the counter with the cheesecakes is) when the manager told us to sit back down and 'your server will be right with you'. Our server was not right with us. So when the manager turned her back we had to sneak inside without her seeing. Once inside we told a different server about our issue. She looked like she was sucking on a lemon but did take us to the cheesecake counter. We asked for our cheesecakes, got them in a to go box and left. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you REALLY like the food, which is good. The customer service and ridiculous wait times sadly aren't worth it."
