Crystal J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/7/2016,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory I mean, who dosent? I had a horrific experience at this one. My boyfriend and I were headed to a late night movie and decided to get something to eat. Unfortunately, our favorite restaurant in the world ( Wokcano ) was closed at this hour so we opted for the cheesecake factory which we definitely love as well. When we arrived the hostess sat us at very uncomfortable awkward seats when the entire restaurant was almost empty and we could have been seated elsewhere. Once our server finally showed up she reeked of cigarette smoke and gave us a very bland greeting. She took our drink orders my boyfriend asked for water and I got a Coke as I always do. The Coke tasted extremely sweet like a Diet Coke and was also flat. When it came time to order she wasn't very informative on menu options. I ended up ordering orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered a make your own chicken sandwich with fries. When the waitress came back with our orders,  she did not come up to our table to deliver the food she delivered it from over a small wall we were sitting next to you which I thought was very odd. Was she just lazy? She didn't bring the sauces we asked for on the side and our fries were completely cold and stale. Being in a rush for at the movies we just ate them anyways. Another server had to bring our check because our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I are amazing tippers when the service is worth it. However for this woman we simply left her a note in her server book saying "" Maybe you should be a little nicer then you'll get tipped. Your attitude was like the food. Cold and stale "". I really expected more from this visit. And just to mention I have worked in fine dining for a very long time so I have a very keen eye for what good customer service is supposed to be. This service would have been obviously bad to anyone."
Sapna G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,12,3,2.0,11/6/2015,"The service isn't so great. Wait staff is not very efficient. I ordered the Pasta Di Vinci 2 days ago and it was completely undercooked. I was on an hour lunch break, and by the time the food came out and I was  able to figure it out, There wasn't enough time to order something else or send it back. I was pretty disappointed. As convenient as the location is for me, I don't think I'll be going there for a while."
Dwight M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/22/2015,"Beautiful new restaurant open only for two weeks. Usual extensive menu with lots of good choices. However, not yet organized. Simple meals for party of six. Main courses not served at same time.  Last person served after the rest of us were half way through our meal. We tried to order their famous cheese cake, but most of them were not available because they were frozen. Service generally very slow taking two hours to finally get everything served. Not ready for prime time, but I suspect they will eventually get their act together."
Adnan k.,"South El Monte, CA",1,39,1,1.0,12/13/2015,Very poor service. The manager on duty on the evening had no idea of how to handle the rush of the customers and it was a Chaos that I have never observed. The customer service is very poor and I have visited many Cheesecake restaurants but this is the worst managed. I ended up eating next door at the Pizza restaurant with my family and the waiter there told me I am not the first to experience this rude behavior and mismanagement.
Alicia V.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,25,1,3.0,11/8/2015,"I guess they are still ironing out the kinks. Our order took a long time to arrive and when it did,  one of our party didn't get his food--took another half hour for his food to arrive! They did comp his meal and the food was excellent. The big disappoint was that my cheesecake was not good. No excuse for that when your restaurant is named Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecake had a hard crust on top like it had been sitting uncovered too long and did not have a dense consistency--too fluffy. I like a good cheesecake. I will go back though, hopefully they get better with practice!"
Jean R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/30/2015,"My daughter was visiting and we were looking forward to going to the new Cheesecake Factory here in Santa Monica. It was a Sunday afternoon glad to have gotten seated pretty quickly. We got seated then waited for seven minutes before our server acknowledged us, no asking if we wanted water, something to drink, etc...it wasn't like he was busy either. Also, a lady in a purple shirt walked by...possibly the manager bc she asked another table about their food. Anyway, our waiter Ross finally introduced himself, yep we were ready to order. We had to ask for ice tea refills, no ice... Food was great. I will probably give them one more try. If service doesn't impove we will definitely be looking for other choices!"
Lisa K.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/30/2015,"I was thrilled when I heard that the Cheesecake Factory was coming back to the westside!  I've been there twice now.  The first time, at least everyone was pleasant.  The service was just a mess.  We had four waiters attempting to serve us food that wasn't ours.  It was so long before we got OUR food that we were tempted to take someone else's just to start eating already.    The food was subpar but it was only the second week. The following week, we went on a Saturday night.  It was very crowded and we were told it would be a 30 to 40 min. wait.  Then I asked about a table on a patio facing the mall.  I was told that would be a 20 minute wait.  So I switched to that.  25 minutes later, I was told we had 13 minutes to go.  The hostess was mad at me because I pointed out a mistake she had made earlier.  I figured that was punishment.  Meanwhile, two tables sat empty on the patio for at least 20 more minutes and then she sat someone there that came way after us.  That was it.  I got a manager's attention who said he'd take care of.  I guess if you call waiting another 10 minutes taking care of us he did.  The rest of the service was fine though.  But that hostess had a real chip on her shoulder.  I hope they clean house soon to make it a more pleasant experience for their customers."
Minnie I.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/16/2016,"The worst cheesecake experience ever! I created an account just to write this review! The service here is horrible and the staff is so overworked they come across as rude and unfriendly! We got the worst table in the whole place and when asked if we can switch to another table (which was available and stayed available for awhile) they said it's not possible. We came here months ago and thought the service was bad then because it's a new location. But the not only they did not improve, they got worse. They get the orders wrong twice!!"
D W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,,1.0,4/11/2016,"The service at this Cheesecake Factor is AWFUL! The manager, Sara Mayorga was unpleasant and unhelpful when we visited over the weekend. First of all, we arrived in the morning and the restaurant was EMPTY.  Then we were told that we needed to wait 5-10 minutes for a table...not so. Thirty minutes later they wanted to stick us in the bar with babies!  The manager said that she didn't have any servers available but yet we saw 3 employees standing behind the bar chatting/socializing.  We informed the hostess we wanted a table outside if possible but then settled for inside the restaurant...but heck...inside the bar?! Then Sara gave me attitude and said ""there's no one drinking in the bar"".  Not true! There were a couple of guys drinking it up but that's not the point!  We didn't want to be in the bar, we wanted to be outside and then settled for inside the restaurant but we drew the line at the bar.  Sara wanted to stick us wherever she thought was best for her since she said ""I don't have a server available"".  Well...why didn't the restaurant staff properly??  Or ask a server to cover a table in the restaurant? Why should a customer have to be stuck in a corner near a big huge pole in the bar with babies because the manager failed to staff properly?  Rather than being pleasant about the whole incident, Sara proceeded to talk about me with her employee right there when I was around.  Sara is very unprofessional and there's a reason why this location is so poorly rated.  We will NOT be back. We ended up going to the CURIOUS PALATE on the same level to eat..we were VERY pleased.  The Curious Palate food is fresh, the owner was appreciative and came out to talk to every customer. That's great service!  Cheesecake Factory Regional VP - you need to check on this location as clearly you are NOT monitoring the Santa Monica location accurately.  We will not return."
Tina R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",31,6,,2.0,6/4/2016,"very unsatified at this location. The hostess was nice and the waitress was ok but it's the meal that I paid for. First off they have an A rating and I'm not sure why. I had to return sets of silverware that had food left on them three times. After the third time it was clear I wasn't getting clean silverware so I took my napkin and dipped it in the water to clean my silverware the best I could and rubbed the heck out of it to make sure it was clean, at least cleaner than what they gave me. Then I ordered the soup and salad which came with sourdough bread and butter on the side. I had to wait longer for my meal as they said they were making a new batch of soup. Great, fresh soup! But not so much. They brought my soup with a new spoon that also had leftover food on it which I had to clean AGAIN!!! Then my soup was lukewarm, what happened to fresh batch of soup? Lastly, I asked where my sourdough bread and butter was and the waitress said it never came with bread and butter, on Y the free bread that's served before the meals. I checked the menu and it states, soup, salad, sourdough bread, and butter. Lastly, the soup sucked and my stomach hurt for a good two hours after. Not loving the Santa Monica location at all. So sad but I will not be returning my family or friends here. If you go, bring your own eating utensils."
C C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/5/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the server we had was absolutely horrible.  I had family visiting in from out of town and this was the first stop we made.  I can't for the life of me remember the servers name but he was rude, never checked up on our table and only came to the table when he saw us asking the food runner a question.  I don't understand why such unhappy miserable acting people want to work where customer service is highly important!  Food was great!"
Gaby M.,"Culver City, CA",6,34,5,1.0,4/18/2016,"The worst Cheesecake restaurant in my life. I didn't even get to taste there food or ( popular cheesecake) Me and my brothers arrived there we wanted to sit on the outside patio. The host said 20 mins. Which was okay. Waitress is standing next to the host just standing there looking stupid. Waiter called us and took us to the patio where she expected us to sit in a hot ass table with out no umbrella over us. I asked nicely can you get us one she said no. I said well we don't want to sit here. The waiter takes us to the host and tells her we don't want to sit there. The host mumbles ""Wow picky, why would they want to sit there.""I'm like who the hell wants to eat food on a hot day without no shade no umbrella. The host said 25 more minutes while they sat other people down since we picky. I said we don't care to much about the food, especially if your melting under the sun. I won't be going back. Fire those lazy girls, they are just standing there trying to get attention from men. Horrible service! They do need to get new servers and new management.. Disappointed"
Anna M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/20/2016,"I ordered food to go over the phone, and showed up in 15 minutes, when they said it would be ready. I checked in with the girl working the bakery, and she told me she would check. I sat there for 20 more minutes until one of the guys working finally asked me if I was waiting for something. It had been ready the whole time, he was just sitting there trying to keep it warm because nobody bothered to tell me. The group behind the counter were too busy talking and laughing amongst themselves. The guy was nice, he almost redeemed the situation, but my food was all cold by the time I got home."
Stacey W.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,59,157,5.0,11/29/2015,"We walked away from Barney's, our party of 5 plus our little 1 month old because they couldn't accommodate us with our infant stroller in tow. We were very sad as that was our plan for lunch. On to plan B alla Cheesecake Factory. We were delighted that the hostess had immediate availability for a round booth for 5 and plenty of room for our stroller. The waiter, Adrian, showed no concern to deliver prompt and friendly service aside our bulky baby stroller and even took time to acknowledge our little one and converse a little about his own experiences in parenthood. We knew, at this point, that it was destined our party of 5 1/2 enjoy the amazing service and food...WOW!! Cheesecake Factory outdid themselves today! Adrian not only sold me on the best choice I made today, the daily salmon special which was out of this world fantastic, but recommended a great local brew on tap for this new mom who's had 9 months of waiting and anticipation for a damn good beer!! Thank you, Adrian, for incredible service and thank you CF for welcoming this group of hungry friends with a newborn in tow!"
McKenzie P.,"Whiting, IN",106,14,8,2.0,1/27/2016,"Just walked left and I'm actually very unhappy with my experience. I came with two girlfriends and sat at a table in the bar. We sat a little bit waiting for some attention, and finally got acknowledged by another server. Our waitress was very nice but I have a few complaints. I ordered the salmon on the ""healthier"" menu to go and she rang in the wrong one even though I pointed at the right one on the menu. It was also more expensive than the one I wanted to order. Next, she was refilling our waters and there was a clear sauce container in my friends glass. I work in a restaurant and normally this would be considered a ""foreign object"", and I would have at LEAST mentioned this incident to my manager. Mainly, to ensure there was no concern or complaint to deal with. She did neither. She just said, ""really?"", when I'm almost positive she saw the ramekin herself. The desserts and drinks we ordered were great, hence the 2 stars."
catherine b.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,1.0,1/14/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants!! But not in santa monica, a few of my co-works said not to go there, orders aren't right service is slow.. Had to find out for myself, called in an pick up order they said 15-20 mins, well i got there 30 mins later and the order was written on a piece of paper and hadn't even been placed in system!! Late for work already waiting they wanted me to wait another 15 mins!!! Will never go here again what a waste of time, maybe they will get it together in a year!!!"
bob w.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,36,,1.0,1/19/2016,"Ordered three consecutive drinks that they could not make due to lack of ingredients (sazerac, 7-7, and caiprinriha).    Wasted 15 minutes on this and waiter didn't comp my FOURTH bar order which was finally successful."
Bon J.,"PACIFIC PALISADES, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/23/2016,The host said I would be seated in 30-40 minutes. I have been waiting for about 40-45 minutes and I went to go check to see how much longer. They said probably about 15 minutes. Talk about liars
Terri W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,24,,1.0,1/2/2016,"We were a walk in at about 120pm and were seated promptly. Our server, Jason, was friendly and helpful. We ordered guac/chips to share which took about 25mins to arrive. Our entrees took even longer. After about 40mins, I asked for the entrees to go because at this point we had run out of time. It took another 10mins to box the food. When we got home, the soup lid had not been put on correctly, so spilled everywhere. We were missing items such as bread rolls that were supposed to come with the soup. Neither salad had dressing with it and were missing items (a garden salad, was just lettuce with a quarter of a tomato). It was a complete waste of money. I expected better of CF. We will not be back."
M S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/21/2016,Awful. Said 20 minute wait and it was. We were given a buzzer to alert us.   But then you get in a line to be seated which is another 10 minutes. They don't have enough staff to seat you. Upon Entering half the tables were empty. Why not sit people in them? Obviously understaffed.  We ordered an appetizer. It never came. We ordered food and it took 45 minutes to come and it came out in three trips.  We were only a table of three.  Our waiter said its like this every day and he doesn't know why they can't get it together. Even he was embarrassed.
