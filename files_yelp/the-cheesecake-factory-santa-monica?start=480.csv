Janella G.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/2/2015,Hostesses had bad attitudes. Nowhere near the exceptional service at most cheesecake factories. Decided to leave instead of stay for dinner because of this. Was really looking forward to this opening within walking distance. Looks like I will continue to drive to Marina del Rey when I want some cheesecake factory.
Camille O.,"Porter Ranch, CA",57,30,,1.0,12/11/2015,Im sorry but service SUCKS! The waiter was obnoxious. Im sorry ill drive an extra mile just to go to the one in Marina Del rey .. Go fix yourself
Jina K.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2016,This was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever!  I love Cheesecake Factories but this one was bad.  I would stay away from this one if you don't want to ruin your day.
Olivia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,31,57,1.0,1/30/2016,"I went here last night for my birthday. I'm vegan, ordered the vegan Cobb salad. Big hunk of ham in it. I could vomit, a DEAD THING in my food."
Evgenia C.,"San Diego, CA",184,63,47,1.0,12/26/2015,"This is extremely disappointing. We got here on a Saturday it's normal to have a half an hour wait for Cheesecake Factory, excited to be sited and have food. I was pushed by one of the hostesses with no sorry whatsoever. We had to Ask to have our plates changes because they were dirty !!!! We had to wait over 5 mins to be served with bread and water. Although our waitress was sweet, the food was ok. The Alfredo pasta ordered came cold and tasteless although creamy. The salad didn't seem to be fresh at all. Overall it is definitely the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to( and I've been to quite a few and usually love them). If you really really want to go, you should try the marina del Rey location!!! Does not deserve the money at all.... Shame and the chef needs to be changed as well as most of the staff should get trained. They also seem to be understaffed for the holiday season. Good luck !"
Will E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,2.0,11/10/2015,"If they don't speed up their service....They won't last long in Santa Monica... I have never seen anything like this.... My lunch hour took 2 hours... And after I ordered my food the waiter comes back and says... We are out of the Club Sandwich today.. What? It's noon... How did that happen? Oh... Maybe because it took 20+ minutes to even be acknowledge by the waiter. I understand they just opened but people aren't going to put up with this.. Overall, the food was good as usual.. It's the service that is TRULY a problem.."
Missa K.,"Arcadia, CA",60,20,5,2.0,1/8/2016,"I'm here with a friend on a Thursday early evening, simply to have two pieces of cheesecake and that is it. Upon entering the restaurant a lot of waiters were just standing around the hostess desk looking like they were waiting for instruction. Our hostess took us  to overpopulated section of the restaurant that was not very busy looking, a lot of the customers only have water and nothing else. Upon being seated it took 10 minutes for me to flag down a waitress asking to be waited on. The waitress I flagged down told me she's not in charge of my table so she would need to find the waitress that was. Another five minutes later a different waiter came by our table asking if we had yet been served yet to which I replied no and he said that he was from a different section and that he apologized for the delay. And upon taking our order our actual waitress came by and and took over taking the order after the initial waiter had already written our order down showing me that the whole thing was very unorganized. It took another 3 minutes to get our waters to our table, and another 10 minutes to have our cheese cake slices delivered. Also I need to mention that when I looked over to the kitchen I saw a lot of wait staff just messing around doing nothing. I don't think that I am an impatient woman however I feel like the wait staff at this establishment needs a readjustment"
Marissa C.,"Modesto, CA",13,9,,2.0,7/17/2016,"Came to this location last night with a not so great experience. We ended up waiting more than double our estimated wait time for a table which is understandable because it happens. What was not so acceptable was the fact that we ordered our food about 15 minutes before the next table, and not only did it take over 40 minutes to get our food (not to mention we didn't even get bread to hold us over in the meantime) but the table next to us was already finished eating their meals by the time we got ours. What??! My food was fine but my boyfriends burger was way undercooked than what he had asked for to the point where he couldn't even eat it making it a complete waste of money. We didn't bother sending it back since we had already waited so long and were just ready to leave. The manager did come over to apologize and offered to give us both cheesecakes on the house, which they ended up forgetting about. Again, after being at the restaurant for almost 3 hours by now, we decided to not wait another 30 minutes for the cheesecake and just paid our bill and left. Pretty disappointed because we always look forward to eating at The Cheesecake Factory but this was a pretty unpleasant experience. Although our waiter and waitress were very nice, and I appreciate the apology, I don't think we will come back to this location again."
Jennie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",178,3,,1.0,8/18/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location is just not getting it right. I have gone several times in hopes that the service gets better but I'm continuously disappointed. Service is super slow even when it's not busy and the servers just aren't friendly and seem like they hate their job. Went today with a friend around 2, and the experience was enough to convince me never to return to that location again. First of all, it took a long time to even get the free bread Cheesecake Factory provides for all its guests as well, we had to ask for it after about 20 minutes. My friend ordered a classic burger and told me that it didn't taste or appear any different than a burger from Carl's Jr. or Burger King. Quality of food definitely seems to have decreased significantly over the years. Server never came to refill our empty water cups nor did she ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu, which we did. Took about forty minutes to get the food as well. Overall just not an experience worth the time or the price. Otherwise I'm still a fan of Cheesecake Factory, just not this Santa Monica location. :("
Jian L.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,1,1,1.0,12/28/2015,"I should have trusted the reviews and avoided this place. The food was sooo bad. Pasta was overly oily, pizza tasted just like BBQ sauce and the BBQ chicken salad was  the worst I ever had. Service was poor too. I had to keep asking our waiter for something because he kept forgetting to bring them to us. When we said thank you to him, he never bothered to respond - among other things. Bathroom was filthy too. In short, worst cheesecake factory i've ever been to. Will never go again."
Daniel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Today I experienced the worst service from any dine in restaurant with my family  ,  i got buzzed in to be seated and when we came in to be seated one of the hostesses gave my family and I the worst attitude I've experienced by a hostess, I hope the hostesses get fired and replaced, next our waitress was taking us tine seated and apparently the table she was going to seat us at was already going to be occupied by another party so our waitress left us standing there and told the other hostess you deal with them then, there we were standing for anther 5 minutes until i sat myself at an empty table. The floor managers veronica and jenn need to get it together or let someone else with management abilities be the floor manager because they clearly don't know how to do their job. GET IT TOGETHER CHEESECAKE FACTORY."
Sahar G.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,36,2,1.0,12/15/2015,This is my first time here and it was the worse experience I've ever had. They sat me down at a table and after 20 minutes of just sitting there I asked someone to take my order and they told me it would be a few minutes and still no one came. I sat down for 35 minutes before someone came to my table. Horrible customer service and horrible food. Will never return again
Debra B.,"Venice, CA",1,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"I guess when you come to TCF you should know what you're getting yourself into. And yes, the food is what you expect. But the service -- from start to finish -- was beyond explanation. From the 80 minute wait (we were told 40), to the repeated asks for a place setting and water, to the staggered arrivals of our food (10 minutes between), to a complete missing order -- the dinner was an unmitigated disaster. It's clearly a mismanaged restaurant. It's big. It's loud. But it doesn't have to be this unpleasant."
Kristal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/11/2016,"Normally every time I go to CheeseCake Factory I always have a great experience, which is why on this extra special day, my Mother in Laws 60th birthday we selected this resturant to celebrate. However the experience was completely ruined by terrible customer service. I am extremely upset and frustrated. Service was great to begin with until I tried to surprise my Mother in Law by getting my server Questa's attention to advise her that we were celebrating a Birthday. I literally had to track her down because I did not want my Mother in Law to know, I wanted it to be a surprise. Once I spotted my server I politely said ""excuse me"", but at that same moment the host interjected and began speaking to her, completely ignored me as I stood there for 5 minutes trying multiple times grab either of their attentions. Once they were done chatting my server walked away. The host then asks me if I needed something and I told her I was trying to get my servers attention. She then asks me if she could help, I informed her today is my Mother in Laws birthday and I was hoping we could surprise her with a birthday dessert. The host said of course and took down her name and advised she would let our server know. Ten minutes pass and we receive the check and we pay for our meals still hopeful that my Mother in Law would be surprised. Ten more minutes pass and we accept the surprise is not going to happen. My mother in law actually thought we FORGOT! As we were leaving I approach my server and ask her why the surprise dessert never came and she advised that she was never informed of my request by the host. She unceremoniously told me that ""sure she could grab something and charge us for it"", I told her no thanks and we left. I was extremely upset and frustrated by the lack of communication, the lack of professionalism when I tried to grab my servers attention and the complete disregard for sympathy I was given when I told my server the situation. It's situations like this that can ruin a customer experience and a 60th Birthday."
Elaina And Nai D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,5,,1.0,11/23/2015,First of all we get there and the hostess was nice said it will be about 30 min wait so that was ok. The thing she gives us buzzes saying our table is ready we go up there and then the male host says to give him a min and stand to the side we wait 5 more mins for him to take us to the table. We get to the table and it is still DIRTY! There were still dirty dishes on the table. He asks us to stand to the side while he cleans it up. (Are you kidding me?) we see an open booth for 4 and we ask if we can just sit there and he said no. Ok? Because it makes sense to have us wait more for you to clean the table that should have been cleaned before you tried to seat us but alright. We order our food and it comes out appetizers are good and then we receive the main course and my aunt asked for extra pasta sauce and my cousins order is just completely wrong to begin with. She asked for the hibachi steak medium rare and got the steak Diane well done. They came back with her correct plate but the steak was also well done. And 15 mins past my aunt has not received her extra pasta sauce. And one of the managers came and helped us correct the meals and it was ok. Then our waitress who by the way was incredibly sweet was telling us she was going on her 10 min break and that Dakota would take our checks once we are done and she did. Our original waitress comes back from her break and Dakota still hasn't brought us back our change. We let it be known that she took 15 mins to give us our change and she talks back to my aunt and then turns around and calls her a b*tch. Really? How unprofessional. And a manager was standing right there and he didn't say anything. I couldn't believe this place. I'm visiting my fam because I'm out of town and my first night here and they legitimately ruined it.
M N.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/28/2016,"I have two young children and a hectic life, so it takes A LOT for me to take the time to write a bad review.  But I had a such a bad experience on so many levels that I had to.  The first time I came to the restaurant with our friends and their kids I asked if they happen to have coloring sheets or at least a piece of paper to occupy our kids, since almost every family restaurant I've been to has them.  Nothing was available--not even a piece of paper, so the waiter ripped a piece of his notepad to give me.  The second time I went to the Cheesecake Factory I had my phone charged ready to give to my kids.  Unfortunately, not only does TCF not offer WiFi like most restaurants do, but it's actually blocked, so absolutely no internet was available.  That wouldn't have been an issue, except that it took close to 10 minutes to get a server to come to our table, another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then at least another 45 minutes to an hour to get our food.  Halfway thru the wait, our kids (and ourselves) were out of patience and it became very stressful, because there was no Wifi to distract our hungry kids.  The drink order was incorrect.  We ordered an appetizer that never came.  The meal was incorrect in that one of the dishes didn't have the side-dish it was supposed to come with.  We asked for the bill right away since we were worried it would take another hour to get.  The bill was...you guessed it...incorrect.  They charged us for drinks for the kids even though drinks were included on the kids' meal.  When we got the bill we also pointed out to them that our side dish and appetizer never came.  When they brought the new bill 20 minutes later, they also then brought us that appetizer AND charged us for it.  We never did get the side dish.  At that point we had already finished our meal and didn't want the appetizer.  But we paid the bill, didn't even bother disputing that appetizer, because all we wanted after 2 plus hours there was to get the heck out!!!  Just looked at some of the other reviews and definitely agree about the bad customer service and unwelcoming feel.  From the greeters to the wait staff, to the fact that a huge successful family restaurant does nothing to make families feel accomodated, it just feels like you're bothering them by being there.  All in all, I've had a long history of dining at the Cheesecake Factory, but after this, I think I'm done with the place!"
Amanda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/26/2015,"Tonight my boyfriend and i visited this new location for our first date night in a very long time. The place is gorgeous inside and out we checked out the terrace before being sat inside. The hosts were happy and welcoming talking to us on or way to the table. Our server (Lauren) Greeted us with a huge smile and had drinks and bread out before i even looked up from my menu which was very fast. The menu is huge and i think she could tell i was overwhelmed, she asked if she could assist in any menu questions or suggestions, i gave her my options and she helped me decide that with my love for spice and pasta to get the chipoltle pasta with chicken. It was amazing i found my new favorite dish for the next time i come visit. As well as our delicious desert the oreo cheesecake was to die for. Our date night was amazing Cant wait to come back and visit Lauren and this beautiful location. Thanks again lauren!"
Priscilla M.,"Rosemead, CA",20,46,27,1.0,11/23/2015,"Wow.. what a horrible night. I was having a good day until the workers here just made it go to crap. Went in thinking I was gonna have a great dinner with my family. Well I thought wrong. Had to wait maybe 20mins when they said it'd be 30mins... got called early and the table wasn't even ready for us to be seated. Waited another 10.. OK. Anyway I looked that over and then our original server was so nice. Well we placed our orders and all and I got the wrong order. I ordered a Hibachi steak with no wasabi. They brought me a steak diane instead..... well done. I like my meat medium rare and it wasn't correct. They brought out my original plate but it was, again, overcooked and cold as hell!! I usually don't complain but I haven't had steak for a long time and I really wanted a nice steak dinner, cooked right. My mom had some pasta and she wanted extra sauce and she waited 20mins for aside of sauce..... we called a manager over to get it resolved and I really appreciated Joe, the manager, for correcting it and personally serving us. He brought back my steak and it was cooked right and it was the right plate... but it was cold too... it's okay I overlooked that as well.... anyway we got through dinner and decided to order dessert. Got our 1st dessert but we waited another 15 mins for a separate one we ordered at the same time! Ok... we overlooked that as well. We let it be.. now... we asked for the check and our server again was great. She let us know she was going to take a 10min break and that DAKOTA would pick up our check and take care of us... DAKOTA came over to pick up the check and we said we needed the change back. Took her 20mins to get us our change. Our original server had been back from break already and asked us if everything was ok and what we were waiting for and we let her know and she went to go look for DAKOTA. Another 10mins... DAKOTA came back from getting change and told my mom she only took 5mins.. at this point we had Joe back at the table since we wanted to leave already to enjoy the rest of the night/beach since we live 2hrs. away... and DAKOTA thought it was a good idea to sass back at MY MOM and started an argument with her!! NO WAY I WOULD LET SOMEONE TALK TO MY MOTHER IN ANY SUCH WAY!!!!!!!! DAKOTA had to be told to not do anything and was walked off by our original server. I was look for DAKOTA so I can speak to her and her manager. I went and followed her around and see maybe I could get her attention. Then I finally got her to see me and in asked her what her name was (I didn't know her name until after) SHE LAUGHED IN MY FACE AND WALKED AWAY WITH A SNOBBY ASS ATTITUDE. OH AND DID I MENTION DAKOTA WAS TALKING TO ANOTHER EMPLOYEE AND CALLED MY MOM A BITCH? YEAH. SO THAT'S WHY I FOLLOWED HER AROUND SO I CAN GET THE MANAGER AND TELL HER. So I got another employees attention and asked her for (Dakota's) her name. At first she said she didn't know and then gave me DAKOTA'S name. I got ANOTHER manager by the name Sara. Told her what happened and she walked to our table and tried to make everything right. No way, after all that mess we wanted NOTHING to do with this location again. I never had had such bad service in my entire life. And I'm a chef btw and I have great customer service skills. I've never encounter such an ugly environment and such bad service.. the managers were nice and said they needed to get rid of TRASH LIKE DAKOTA. She made that very clear. So I hope no one goes through such horrid service like I did and I made that clear to the manager. All in all, a wonderful night wasted we didn't even get to go to the stores in the promenade cause everything was closed by the time we left.. literally wasted 2 1/2 hours and money. Never again will this place get my money or service. So DAKOTA if you see this review or anyone that works here in that manner... GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS FIND ANOTHER JOB WHERE YOU STAY ISOLATED FROM THE PUBLIC CAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SERVE OR ACT AROUND PEOPLE. I will be calling corporate tomorrow afternoon to make sure something gets down about this place or their employees. Never again, stay away..."
Golnaz R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/6/2015,worst service ever staff is not trained well at all they don't even know what they have on their menu messed up our drink order 3 times my steak was way overdone the manager was ridiculous we had to call him over after thy messed up our food order after waiting I'm not exaggerating an hour for our food he told us he would take care of the steak and brought it back tasting even worse he didn't even give us a discount off our check DO NOT GO HERE YOU WILL HATE IT!!!!!!!
