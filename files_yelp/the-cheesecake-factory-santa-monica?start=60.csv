Robin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,16,9,3.0,7/1/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory and it's unfortunate that I even had this experience tonight. I totally understand that it's a Friday night and it gets busy so I usually cut them slack. But tonight was bad. First we order spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer that our waiter forgot. Then he didn't even bring us bread. What got me was he gave bread to the people right next to us. I didn't understand that at all. It took him forever to get me my drink and for a while I thought he would forget that too, but it came eventually. My food took a long time to come out but I expected that since it was so busy. If it weren't for the fact that I was hungry my boyfriend was ready to just pay for my drink and we were going to leave. Like I said I love cheesecake. When we eventually got our food it was great. I just wish our waiter would have at least made some sort of an effort."
Jennifer D.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,32,4,2.0,5/31/2017,"Worst service @ SM Place: Employees are totally clueless, like never been a waiter/waitress before and never trained to try now; This was the case on EVERY visit so far since they opened. We keep trying to meet friends there or go before a movie, but its just been a miserable experience each time at THIS location.  CCF in general has Usually consistently good food for decades, we've been to BH, MDR, and Brentwood locations MANY times (+Take out too) over the years, but some new changes to the menu we discovered last year at the SM place location that made us doubt their future (and the frequency and purpose of our continued patronage) like they replaced the beautiful and delicious Luau salad with a really sad substitute, and added a weird ""pizza"" that tasted like soggy cardboard.  Hoping the other standby's stay great. But who knows at this point.  Definitely not very likely to try THIS particular location ever again. Unless we are desperate and somehow get stuck being forced to go. But even then, we wont be happy about it. Its truly been awful here. Its nothing like the classic (awesome) CCF's we have known at all*.  *Totally disappointing version of CCF."
Maya L.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,10,3,1.0,10/4/2017,"Horrible. I would NEVER EVER come here again. Service sucks, waiters don't want to be there and management acts like we are asking to do the something that is such an inconvenience for them when I  return an item they got wrong/did not taste good. They didn't even offer to fix the fettuccini Alfredo. He just took the plate and said ""Ok"". Neither did he offer a replacement or a percentage off of the shitty food. Don't go to this excuse of a restaurant !!!"
Carisha I.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! The wait was ridiculous and there were so many empty tables. Our buzzer went off after 30 minuets just so the lady at the front could tell us ""o no it's just dying that's why it vibrated"". When we were finally seated our server Jose finally decided to greet us after 10 minutes ,not friendly at all we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food I asked for the manager a total of 3 times, finally she showed up and was absolutely 0 help. The food was ok but definitely will never return to this location again. DO BETTER!!!"
Carla M.,"Long Beach, CA",43,45,,1.0,6/23/2017,"Regardless of the overall rating - which should have been our clue - we had a really poor swrvice experience last night.  Here in Santa Monica for the weekend celebrating our anniversary.   We ordered, the food came really slow - like 40 mins... and then was wrong.  Waitress apologized, said it was her fault and she would put in the order again and rush it, like 10 mins.  It took 25 more minutes, and it was just a burger,  no fries this time.  I was done eating, waited for my husband to eat his and he felt rushed... then we got bill and she charged us for the burfet that took 1hr 10 mins to get! Topper, when we got wrong food, waitress was more upset she had to throw away burger than us... and no manager ever showed to apologize.    Sadly, our seats would be filled in 20 mins or so by another couple, so do theyreally care?"
West C.,"Newport Coast, CA",2,63,2,1.0,7/17/2017,Our food took so long to come out we had to take it to go.  The drinks we ordered were disgusting because the bar tender was to busy to make them correctly.  The food was in fact awful.  The fried cheese was not cooked all the way. The calimari smelled like fish and gave us food poisoning.  They were on a 40 minute wait. I couldn't find a manager anywhere. Wasted a night out and about $100 Disappointed
Noesh H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",18,115,203,5.0,12/4/2016,"Great service when we had arrived. No wait time, good sized booth and excellent food. Location is a little tricky with parking and all but it's in the main complex, (top floor). Pretty good in comparison to other locations! One of the classics, with affordability."
Maurice I.,"Zürich, Switzerland",2,31,1,1.0,10/8/2017,I like the the Cheesecake Factory very much. But this location is horrible. Service is very unfriendly. The food is raw. That was the last time at the Cheescake Factory at Santa Monica!!!
Richard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,12,1.0,5/29/2017,"Wow what happened to the restaurant,  we sat down and waited for 20 minutes nobody came to take our order,  since we waited I noticed that all silverware and plates were extremely greasy and dirty.  Finally a server showed up and I pointed out dirty dishes he apologized and called over the manager.  The manager also apologized and placed  clean silverware on table,  not a napkin or a clean plate but on a dirty table!  Definitely it's the last time we ever go to cheesecake factory."
May C.,"Monterey Park, CA",5,61,101,4.0,7/7/2017,"Don't know why this Cheesecake Factory has 3 1/2 stars. It seems a bit low to me. I come here about every 3 months or so. I always received good service and good food. There's usually not a long wait but then again I get the early birds special around 5:30pm or so. I don't really get anything else besides the Louisiana chicken pasta and fries. I think Cheesecake Factory has one of the best fries. Today, the chicken pasta looks different. Different is good. It came with fried chicken cutlet stacked mile high. In the past, I think it only comes with 2 pieces of chicken steak instead of 5. It looked pretty and impressive. I loved my experience here today. Cheesecake Factory is consistent everytime. Never had a bad meal and hope never will."
Suhani A.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,103,115,2.0,5/10/2017,"Very good view, very very BELOW average food and service. I would pick any other Cheesecake Factory over this one and so should you lol"
Stacey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/24/2017,"BEWARE OF BAD SERVICE.  Cheesecake typically delivers a wide variety of decent food and service, except at this Santa Monica location.  This is the 2nd time I've had horrible service at this particular location. Both times one person in our party did not receive a portion of their meal. This specific visit was the most offensive since it was the actual meal.  Wait staff is nice and friendly but very extremely inexperienced.  The manager is equally inexperienced in managing such situations as they offered a casual apology but nothing beyond that. I frequent many restaurants and the manager sets the tone and standard for level of service. I've even been to restaurants where my meal was accidentally delivered to another guest and the manager profusely apologized and not only removed said item from the bill but also gave me a giftcard to use at my next visit (I'll be visiting Snooze in La Jolla without a doubt). The manager today and my previous visit only offered a lackluster, half heartfelt apology.   The best part of my visit was when I told the server to wrap up the salad only to have him say but I asked them to rush it. Sorry pal, I waited for over 45 minutes for my salad to never arrive. They are lucky I left a half decent tip."
Melissa R.,"Honolulu, HI",74,53,16,1.0,5/22/2017,"If you have celiac, crohns, or a gluten intolerance DO NOT GO HERE! The staff do NOT know the difference between dairy free and gluten free. They kept saying my ""gluten free"" pasta was gluten free because it didn't have cheese on it. They kept insisting the pasta was gluten free when it wasn't. I checked the brand that supplies them with gluten free pasta and they don't even make the type that was served to me. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
Ayes S.,"Pasig, Philippines",0,2,,4.0,11/7/2017,"We had the ribe eye and carbonara while my kids had pizza, cheese sandwich and mac and cheese. Generous portions! The steak was a bit dry but the carbonara was creamy and rich! The strawberry cheesecake was too yummy and just the tight amount of sweetness! Will definitely be back on out next visit!"
Adam G.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",12,142,4,4.0,5/21/2017,"Somewhere in the 3-4 star range is probably the right rating, but I'll lean towards he generous side with 4.  The place is huge! The ambiance is nice. The food is good but the service is mediocre.  We came for brunch and had the Chilaquiles, pancakes, chicken & waffles Benedict, and a breakfast sandwich. Everything we delicious and the pancakes may have been some of the best we've ever had.  The only reason to rate this place lower is because the service is greatly lacking, particularly for a chain that should have the formula down. That aside, the food is great, so we'll be back... hopefully we'll experience better service next time."
Melinda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",418,84,238,1.0,12/12/2016,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service is beyond slow and the food is mediocre.  First, the waitress and waiters seem very unhappy to be here. They often ignored us, spoke only to each other, and moved extremely slowly. When our waitress took our order, she did not write anything down. Therefore, it was not surprising when our orders came out all wrong. My friend ordered pasta with no onions --- it came with onions. My other friend ordered the salmon and it was cold by the time it arrived at the table. I ordered an omelette with spinach, tomato, ham and avocado. There was no avocado and mushrooms instead of tomato. 3/4 of the orders came out wrong.  When I asked them to fix this, they took twice the amount of time to bring me my omelette back --- and it still had mushrooms in it with one piece of avocado. I gave up and just ate this. The potatoes that came with the omelette took another 20 minutes to get here, which by this time, we were completely done and waiting for the check. In fact, the check arrived before my food even got here. The waitress seemed very grumpy to have to fix these mistakes.  Definitely avoid going here if you can. Unless you want terrible service and poor food, I recommend going to all the other restaurants third street promenade has to offer. It will taste much better and probably will be cheaper."
Ana C.,"Bakersfield, CA",75,7,7,5.0,7/16/2017,"First time ever going to the Cheesecake Factory! The service was good and the food was delicious and we can't leave the cheesecake factory without getting cheesecake, which was delicious also. I would love to go back soon."
Joanne H.,"Santa Monica, CA",207,206,106,3.0,12/6/2016,"The location is good and the restaurant is huge. I also like that they have an elevator that goes from the ground floor next to Nike directly into the 3rd floor restaurant! You can check in from where you get off the elevator, you don't have to go to the front lobby to check in, so you could potentially bypass a line for checking in!  The restaurant is standard for a cheesecake factory, but there's also an outdoor area which is nice. They have ample heating so it's not cold, even when it's 50 degrees outside at night!  As far as the food goes, it was ok. It's what I would expect from a cheesecake factory, so the food is pretty good, but nothing special or particularly interesting. The portions are giant, which is weird for Santa Monica, so expect to have leftovers!"
A B.,"Newhall, CA",0,12,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"New Manegemant , that's what this location needs, As a cheesecake loyal costumer ( 4 times only this week) . Came here with  family, 25 minutes after ordering the food the waiter came to tell us that they out of what we ordered . The New Yorke steak,When I asked for the manager why he didn't inform us when we order he just said that he didn't know, Instead of offering discount on the outer steaks they have  that we  "" had "" to order. Our waiter Mik'a was very nice and efficient and I'm sure it wasn't is fault.  Needs better management!!"
Holly A.,"Santa Monica, CA",59,26,56,3.0,1/21/2017,Our waitress was super nice! Food was good - same as every Cheesecake Factory. Bread came out nice and warm. *** 1/21/2017  Incredibly slow service tonight. For no reason that I can see.
