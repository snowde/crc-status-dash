Jim A.,"Burbank, CA",2,10,,1.0,10/1/2017,"I usually love The Cheesecake Factory. This location however has the absolute worst service. From forgetting to seat us after our buzzer went off. Left us standing at the front for 15 min. To seating us. We sat for another 10-15 min before the server finally brought us our drinks. (He had visited the table 4 times after he took the drink order without bringing them. Then we waited almost a half hour to get our food. Asked for napkins and was forgotten. I get it's not an easy gig but when you drop $100 for dinner, you expect better service"
Gianna N.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",0,18,30,1.0,8/7/2017,"Not a fan of this branch, service is slow and even left the menus after food was served. Seems like they forget you once seated. Hope they up there service like the other branches in the valley. Food is the same tasting. Just to tap my drink took too long. Not good, instead of enjoying the experience, were like hunting for our food."
Paula C.,"Pomona, CA",350,52,9,5.0,4/5/2017,"Honestly, I'm surprised that such a large scale restaurant can even function at all. I came here two days in a row (Yes, I am now obese). I was first served by Sean as well as another server who was female. The next night, I was served by Sean again! He was super supppper courteous and attended to our every need before being called by us.  Granted, I came on a Friday and Saturday night, so the food took a little bit before coming to us. I also happened to witness a disappointed customer demanding attention my first night here with my mans and she was dealt with quickly through a server, then by the manager. It's a nice restaurant with a beautiful setting and environment (beach, helloooooo). I'd definitely visit again! Sean's a legit waiter fams."
Laura C.,"Lynwood, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/4/2017,"I have been at this Cheesecake Factory before and our experience was better than today. They took a little over 30 minutes to bring our food. My plate was the spicy cashew chicken it was so salty I could not eat. My husbands Americana hamburger had a ""special ingredient in it"" as the manager called it a ""HAIR"" he did apologize also for my plate he said oh maybe the chef ""added some salt""and he removed it from our check but it sure took our appetite away! We are Never coming back!"
K K.,"San Jose, CA",7,106,20,4.0,10/8/2017,"We had a great waitress and I regret that I did not get her name. I will say the service tends to be a bit slow but I feel it was excellent service, and since we were not in a rush and my cousins were in town, we simply enjoyed the slow service. This cheesecake factory is absolutely a very busy place and our food was great. I'm definitely not digging the way they do the better now though. It used to come in small little packets and now it comes in a big fat slab. We always enjoy the lemon herb roasted chicken with extra carrots instead of potatoes, this particular time we also had the macaroni and cheese balls which are pretty good.  This night we ate out on the patio and it was really nice change from eating inside."
Irene L.,"Santa Monica, CA",199,21,5,5.0,9/25/2017,This place is huge and awesome place to socialize! The server is so awesome and cool! Name is Tyson!  Great place for big gatherings.
Ron A.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",1,24,29,2.0,6/21/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Just not this one. It seems that at this location the only thing they can get right is the cheesecake. Everything else like SERVICE is non existent. I waited 10 minutes for my server to show up. Once my cheesecake and coffee was served, service ended there. No coffee refill no nothing. I eventually had to flag my waitress down just to get my check."
Ericka B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,20,,1.0,11/13/2017,It was the first time I came to this location. I normally go to the Santa Clarita location and I always enjoyed the food. I had a totally different experience at this location. We waited almost an hour for our food to come out and when we finally got our food it was nasty and wrong. My boyfriends meal had hard noodles and hard chicken. He sent his meal back and waited almost 30 minutes for his new order to show up. My meal was ordered wrong I asked for no onions and my meal came with onions. My meal also had no flavor and the noodles were dry. My daughter had ordered fettuccine from the kids menu and we were charged an adult meal. I told the waiter that her meal was supposed to be a kids meal and that the food was wrong and it didn't taste good. He didn't apologize or anything. He didn't offer to take it back or make the correction on my bill for my daughters meal. This was the worst experience ever. The service was bad and so was the food. I will never come to this location again!
Sheri R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",15,45,12,1.0,7/1/2017,"This review is for the manager - we are sitting at the bar watching this girl who by the way is AMAZING yet the ""boss"" is giving her shit. YOU sir made our dinner experience on 7/1/2017  very uncomfortable. Get off her ass already!!"
Ola M.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,9,1,5.0,10/18/2017,"The food was incredibly delicious (we took chicken Madeira) and the plates were really big. One plate will be more than enough for two. The cheesecake was delicious as always. The service was good too. I don't know why they have a low rating on yelp, I think they deserve more."
Lo J.,"Richmond, VA",23,17,5,2.0,8/29/2017,"The Good: The Alfredo was out of this world!  My daughter and my wife thought so as well.  My salmon was very flavorful, but a little too wet for my liking.  Someone else probably would've loved it, but I prefer my salmon to be a little more firm. The rest of the meal was ok...nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about either.  I would not have left a review at all if it wasn't for the service. The Bad: Service.  OMG!  I initially thought our server simply didn't have a clue.  We had a party of 4, my wife was still deciding what she wanted to order when the server approached.  My wife asked the server to get everyone elses order in our party first so that she could decide between 2 meals she was contemplating, and the server responded that she would come back to the table when everyone was ready to order.  WTF?!?!  We're not easily angered, but found the waitress' response odd to say the least.  The rest meal was peppered with stand offish comments, unpleasant attitude, long waits(drink refills and bread), and overall just bad service.  As I mentioned before, I assumed the waitress simply didn't have a clue, however after we paid (including an undeserved tip) and left, my wife admitted to me that she overheard and witnessed server giving very good service to a table adjacent to ours.   I wont speculate as to why we received such poor service when a table next to ours received the exact opposite from the same server.  But I have absolutely no desire to return.  This is a management issue.  As a business owner, I am completely aware when one of my employees is providing subpar customer service.  You guys really need to step your game up."
Ashlen A.,"Malibu, CA",55,78,58,1.0,3/25/2017,Disgusted by the way my food was given to me for take out. I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory with such poor service. Unbelievable!! I attached a photo.
Sandy M.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",0,5,1,2.0,7/30/2017,"They have 5 people at the counter to help. We were told 15 minutes and I said really wait is the true wait time??? She assured me wait for two was only 15 minutes. Without expressing my true feelings here, the wait so 47 minutes. I went up to the counter twice and we were told we were next. I pointed out the empty table for two and finally got seated. Star rating is seating service not food."
Anabel E.,"Long Beach, CA",21,24,31,5.0,10/7/2016,"We found Nemo! He was a fun and enthusiastic and everything came out on time and delicious! I do not really understand why the stars are so low. Every cheesecake factory we have gone too has superb customer service.  If you expect fast service good luck this cheesecake is near 3rd street promenade so expect delays. But the customers, food and service are great. So if you are gonna give poor stars due to timing I would probably chose a less popular cheesecake! On a positive note, the gumbo was delish! The wraps were good! And try the bread with balsamic dressing is amazing I highly recommend it and once you have tried it let me know!!! Bomb!"
Shannon T.,"Westminster, CA",0,22,4,1.0,9/14/2017,Get your act together. Your customer service sucks. In the middle of the day in the middle of the week a girl can't get any service sitting in the bar area with hardly anyone else there.
Laura O.,"Florence, OR",2,9,2,2.0,7/16/2017,"First, kudos to the waiter who didn't shy away or blink twice at me while nursing my infant openly in his section. He took our order and was helpful with getting our drinks to us quickly. Other than that, this Cheesecake Factory visit was disappointing. First he said they were out of the wheat bread, which is really everyone's favorite. Eventually he brought some out, but oddly it didn't taste fresh baked or warm or anything. Next I ordered the reason I come to Cheesecake Factory the few times a year I'm in a city that has one, the Chicken Bellagio. When the food came out, he apologized because they were out of Arugula, which is like an important part of what makes the dish. I wish he had told me WHILE placing the order, so I could order something else. I didn't have the choice to return it as my toddler and I were hungry and nap time was approaching. (They were out of arugula before the lunch hour, which seems like bad planning?) The waiter didn't offer to discount the meal, and I was also charged for the half lemonade/half water my toddler drank, which seems silly for a family restaurant to charge so much for something that costs them virtually nothing. I could have saved a few dollars just letting her share my lemonade, but seems like limiting the spill factor with a smaller cup with top was for their benefit. Dissatisfied with this visit, which is disappointing because I rarely get a chance to travel to a big enough city to have a Cheesecake Factory."
Kirsten E.,"Brisbane, CA",6,24,2,3.0,10/14/2017,Gluttony at its best...you will never be disappointed. Order what sounds good and it is! Very large portions. I'd recommend splitting the meatloaf then you'll have room for dessert. Always a busy place so don't expect lingering service.
Vincent M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,3,1.0,9/12/2017,"Very disappointed  with the food and service. First the hostess seats us at a table and when the waiter comes over he said we would have to move to the bar area for happy hour. We move and sat down. Second waitress comes over and said we would need to talk to the hostess about moving to this table because it was not set up for happy hour. Go to the hostess and she could tell by now I was starting to boil over. She took us right back the same table and we started all over again. We order the Nachos, a Greek salad, Macaroni balls, and some Tex Mex rolls. OMG!! the nachos were disgusting with that cheap wax cheese that can last a nuclear war. The salad was nothing special and the macaroni balls were below average. I would not recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone."
David H.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/13/2017,"The portions seemed to have been reduced on the Santa Fe Salad and the Cobb Salad. They were too small compared to other times that I have seen at other locations. It seems that the quantity is not consistent at all locations. The Cobb Salad was not chopped and I found hair in the Santa Fe Salad. Also, it was my wife's birthday and she got a small cup of ice cream with whipped cream, in the past you got a cheesecake."
Steve L.,"Santa Monica, CA",143,1190,17,2.0,8/19/2016,"Why in the world does this place have such a wait?  There are plenty of other options for places to eat in the area, do yourself a favor and skip this one.  A lot of staff walking around, but the one whose helping you never seems to be around.  We ordered a couple of kids plates, and only received one.  When we asked about the second one, they said the fish was dropped and they would make another one right away.  All the rest of our food came out, but still no sign of the second plate.  Suddenly the story was that the ordering system must not have worked correctly, and the kitchen must not have gotten the order in correctly.  What?  Really?  Are you actually figuring out what happened, or just making up excuses.  In the meantime, our friend's son is starving, nibbling off of everyone's plate.  By the time his food came, he wasn't even hungry.   Yes the noise of the restaurant helps to drown out your noisy ids noise, but it's far from a relaxing meal here.  Go somewhere else..."
