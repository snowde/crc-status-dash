Brittany D.,"Bradenton, FL",72,76,129,4.0,8/5/2017,"When my family wants to celebrate a birthday or promotion, this is our go to spot.  Their menu has something for everyone, a little bit of everything. Their Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite. It never has let me down. The portions are huge so there is more than enough to take home. They have smaller plates, too so families and groups can share.  The cheesecake is obviously amazing. They have a new kind out that I can't wait to try with Funfetti.  The wait can be long and the service can be slow. But it is in a wildly popular mall so dinner gets a little crazy. The atmosphere is very classy. I don't know how all the pieces and images work but they do.  Their bar is a little lack luster. :(  I feel like it is mainly drinks you see everywhere. They don't seem to have really creative cocktails like I have seen other places have. Maybe because it's a huge chain? Not sure.  But not matter how boring the bar or how much time it takes to get our food, this is still one of my favorites."
Lola T.,"Sarasota, FL",22,577,174,1.0,12/31/2017,"Carry out at this location is terrible!  When placing order at the counter they always forget about you. Today they said 15 minutes I went up after 20 and she said oh let me check, of course it was ready. Then she said they don't have any bread but I could wait another 15 minutes if I want it. As if I want my food to be even colder waiting for bread. And again no silverware even after asking for it. Point of the story is that they are never proactive."
Mark B.,"Venice, FL",57,64,58,5.0,1/9/2018,"Not sure why this place isnt getting consistenty good reviews.  It seems like most of the bad ones address the customer service and wait times.  I have visited this location a half dozen times and my food was always spot on and the service was fine.  If you come during a busy time and expect to rocket through the meal than you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  Why stress just come, relax, and enjoy."
Katie Y.,"Evanston, IL",32,78,7,4.0,1/6/2018,Came here for lunch while I was in town and was really happy with my experience. Service was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was festive. I love the fact that they have a whole menu for those of us who want to watch what we're eating. The skinny shrimp tacos with siracha sauce were deliciously spicy.
Al H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",19,46,8,4.0,12/4/2017,"Visiting from California , this Cheesecake Factory is wonderful . I will start by the outstanding location . Located in an amazing shopping area, this restaurant has a lot to offer. We had the vegan Cobb salad and we loved it. We started with the avocado egg rolls, definitely a must have. The service was great , our server was nice and answered all our questions . The hostess on the other hand needs was not too nice. I felt that she and her colleagues did not welcome people the proper way. Yet it was busy and they were swamped, but still not an excuse. The server was completely the opposite and she was amazing. She compensated for the hostess's lack of friendliness. Overall , definitely coming back , great place , good food , great location ."
Skye A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",184,178,1715,4.0,5/30/2017,"You've gotta love Cheesecake Factory! I mean the menu is so extensive anyone can find something. I took my family to dinner here while I was in town visiting. It had been a while since I was at a CCF, but like always the food is so good. This is the newer location at the  Mall at UTC. There is valet parking if you feel you need it. We sat outside on the patio where there are a lot of fans to help cool you down, and in the center was a very zen fountain. It was quite calming. I noticed while looking over the menu the amount of calories had been added which obviously for dieting and health conscious decisions I understand, but it was a bit overwhelming trying to pick something once I saw the high amount of calories in pretty much everything.  I got my favorite appetizer the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes to share with everyone. It was just as good as I remember, and the girls loved it too. My mom had never had them before. For my meal, I got one of my favorites which is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and I switched out the white rice for the wasabi mashed potatoes. This dish and the flavors are so tasty. The peanut sauce and the shreds of coconut just make such a savory combination. My sister got the Shrimp Scampi, and my mom had the Americana Cheeseburger. Everyone enjoyed their food, and my sister and I had leftovers to snack on later. Our waitress was awesome and very attentive. We had a great visit!"
Eva R.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,33,3,4.0,12/28/2017,"Good & prompt service from our server Brett.  Family enjoyed zucchini appetizer, chicken costoletta, T-Bone platter (medium well, & 4 cheese pasta dish.  All seasoned & cooked perfectly."
Bethany B.,"Cumming, GA",95,35,51,5.0,11/26/2017,"Best lettuce wraps ever. Three amazing sauces, fresh veggies, and grilled chicken making an amazing combo in your mouth."
Travis H.,"Sarasota, FL",50,114,354,3.0,4/22/2017,"Oh Cheesecake Factory. You truly are consistent, but in this case, that's not exactly a good thing. Honolulu's Cheesecake Factory is their busiest location worldwide, and my wife and I were there weekly. We've been to this location several times now, and I really question why we keep going back. I imagine it's convenience with the location, but I really don't know.  The food is severely overpriced. I can go to dozens of other places in Sarasota and have better food at a cheaper price point. Again, the food isn't bad, but it's not worthy of the hefty price tag. The service is so hit and miss that you honestly can have outstanding service one visit and then have absolute garbage service the next. Our most recent dinner here was again disappointing. My order came out incorrect after a very long wait, and then it was blamed on the cooks. Given that the waiter didn't write our order down, I highly doubt they don't know the difference between white and brown rice and mushrooms vs no mushrooms.  With that being said, I'll likely still come here on occasion. I know what I'm getting, and some dishes are actually quite good if you can get past the $20-25 prices per plate. I know Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain, but I wish they'd be a bit more personable and bring something new to the table."
Lori V.,"Chicago, IL",16,16,1,1.0,11/13/2017,We will not be coming back here!The tables were dirty and they dropped a glass on the floor that exploded on everyone and I pulled glass out of my lap. we still have glass on our table no I'm sorry or anything they put our check on the back of my chair.
Natalie N.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",6,122,161,3.0,11/27/2017,"Boyfriend ordered a Santa Fe salad and came to table with no chicken in it. Waved down a hostess who got what seemed to be the manager and they got it right away, citing a new person in the kitchen. Upon receiving the check, there was no discount. No free drink or cheesecake........"
M R.,"Sarasota, FL",12,302,361,2.0,10/15/2017,"Terribly terribly terribly overpriced Somewhat mediocre food.  I really thought the prices would be better for the type of food they serve.  The black beans are seriously right out of a can and everything tastes kind of lame.  Oh, and you wait and wait for the food to come out."
Bobby S.,"Orlando, FL",416,93,116,4.0,7/6/2016,"Had a pleasant time here with my boyfriend. Was seated immediately for lunch, around 3:45ish?, was asked if we'd ever been before or wanted/needed anything explained. Ended up with a Kobe burger and Mushroom burger, both medium. Both were solid choices, but my $1 up charge sweet potato fries were kind of a disappointment."
Yelp R.,"Sarasota, FL",2,56,17,2.0,1/2/2017,"I went to The Cheese Cake Factory with my mother and my fiancée.  We were seated promptly on a mid-week off season night. The restaurant was fairly busy. Our waitress came around and took our drink order. We ordered a Diet Coke and two glasses of  Sauvignon blanc.  A few minutes later our waitress returned with the soda and the two glasses of wine. Then she took our order. About five minutes later our waitress came back to the table picked up the two, now half full glasses of wine, and said ""I'm sorry I gave you the wrong wine. I have to take these"" then continued to say ""The proper wine would be out soon"".  We replied by telling her that we were enjoying that wine and would like to continue drinking it. We asked her to put the glasses back down. She told us she had already placed the new order and that she needed to take these from us and then left.  Ten minutes later, our replacement wine had not arrived. The waitress came to ask if I wanted a refill on the Diet Coke. We asked about the wine and she said that they printer was not working at the bar and they couldn't fulfill the order at the moment.  We told the waitress that we were unhappy with the experience, that never over the course of our lives has someone literally taken drinks from us while we were drinking them and enjoying them. She said ""do you want a refill on the Diet Coke or not and then walked away"".  Unsatisfied and still without drinks we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation to him in detail. He apologized said that the waitress was new and told us he would have a talk with her.  We informed the manager that the proper way to handle this situation would have been to have the waitress start by saying ""excuse me I have just realized that we severed you a Chardonnay and not a sauvignon blanc then ask us if we would like to exchange them rather then just grabbing our glasses."" Had we been presented with that option we would have said the drinks were fine and continued with our meal.  The other option was to leave us with the Chardonnay (for free since they took our drinks and poured them down the drain anyway) and then just bring us the proper drinks.  The manager apologized again but ultimately did nothing for us. No discount, no free wine, no dessert, nothing.  Ultimately, this odd experience ruined the dinner and we won't be back."
Amy D.,"Bradenton, FL",2,52,52,2.0,1/29/2017,Last night The food was good but definitely need to re-think the way they set the table . It's not the first time this happens to us . When they clean your table and put clean utensils right on the table where they just used a dirty rag to wipe off . Gross ! After looking at our silverware . We notice nasty  dirty grimes on our silverware lettuce was stuck on n the forks and cheese chunk and it's dark in there but we can still see it .for a party of 6 waiting over an hour and a half for a table you can at least clean it better. We told our server . She took the silverware but no apology.
Raj S.,"Sarasota, FL",0,3,5,5.0,10/31/2016,"Who we went there for our Diwali festival party it's awesome we love the service and food the waiter came from Sarasota area we forget her name  She is one of the best waitress I ever see,she Sujest a beer its name blue moon , it's fentastic thank you for giving a nice event"
Caroline H.,"Allen, TX",2,43,,5.0,8/16/2017,Went last night when my daughter and her College Room Mate came home before the Fall Term startes.  We had a Great Waiter and I had the best meal ever!  Tuscan  Chicken!
Paulo P.,"Sarasota, FL",0,57,52,1.0,3/13/2017,"The appetizer was really bad I order the the factory nachos was  burnt and oily, we order couple drinks and they came separately, I order fettuccine Alfredo and was tasteless, server was horrible never show up, this place they should be shame to be called The Cheesecake Factory"
Jason A.,"Sarasota, FL",19,17,44,5.0,7/28/2017,Huge awesome plates of food at a great value. The staff is great and the establishment is nice and squeaky clean. Om nom nom nom.
Jessica B.,"Bradenton, FL",16,50,106,3.0,8/4/2017,Fun and food drinks .. And good atmospher .. Food is good a little price but not bad really. ..staff always friendly and help full. It's in a awesome location.. Worth stopping in for a drink and shopping in the mall
Matt P.,"Tallahassee, FL",6,43,58,5.0,12/26/2016,This review is just for the cheesecake as I have not yet eaten a dinner at this establishment. We have picked up many different types of cheesecakes and on many occasions from this location and they never disappoint!  There is a large selection of cheesecakes to choose from that will keep us coming back for years ( :
Chachi B.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",74,246,906,5.0,3/18/2016,"Stopped before shopping. At 4pm. Very Busy hour, not at the Restaurants.  But, the Mall is very busy. I promptly realized, that parking was rather challenging. And, to top things off. It was a Hot, Humid Day. No Luck with Getting a parking space anywhere even close to the entrance. FYI: By the Malls Main Entrance. They Have Valet Parking. It's 5$ A GREAT VALUE. When, I spend that At Starbucks. And The Cheesecake Factory is by the Valet Parking. YAYYY:-) Between 4 & 6pm they have a Happy Hour. Very Good Selection of Drinks and Starters. Their prices are Very Good. Adult Size Drinks(not Kiddie Cup Size) and, They Make An Amazing Mojito. Lots of Fresh Mint in it.(Mottled) Mint. Secret to a good Mojito. Crushed leaves w A Pestle & Mortar.  If you are not familiar w this. Please, Google it. Seriously, you will be amazed. Crushing the leaves. Releases the essence or Oil of the Mint. BAM:-! What a difference. I sat in the Bar Are. The Bar Area is So Relaxing. Beautiful Architecture. And I've been to a few CFactory Restaurants. Bryan, took care of me. He was marvelous. Very friendly, patient, knew the preparation of their food. Made good suggestions. The Farmers Salad was a Winner. I added Grilled Chicken. The portion was large enough for me to take home. I gen eat very small portions. So I save room for other things:-)) Overall, an Excellent Experience. Will be back here."
Lawrence C.,"San Diego, CA",285,1104,5328,4.0,4/29/2015,"A solidly positive restaurant experience.  It all starts with Taylor (see photo with her manager Jonniene) at the hostess stand.  She was cheerful, and honest and accurate in advising the wait time for lunch to be 10 minutes.  It was, and we were given a table of choice, on the outside patio. Tracey, our server, was also most positive and attentive.  Our food was mixed.  My asian chicken salad, $13.95, had plenty of varied lettuces yet could have used a little more chicken.  Also, the dressing needs to be enhanced as it wasn't as sweet and savory as it should have been.  My friend exclaimed that his Turkey burger was excellent (see photos). All in all, I'd return for an excellent value dining experience."
Shalaya C.,"Leeds Gate/Colonial Village, Savannah, GA",101,2,,5.0,7/16/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here around 10:15 P.M. And thought that our food would be rushed and thought we would receive bad service because it was so late, but boy we were wrong! The food was beyond delicious, better thank any other Cheesecake Factory we have been to, and the portions we received were worth the amount we paid. Service was wonderful and I will definitely be visiting this location again!"
Michelle G.,"East Northport, NY",1,48,40,3.0,3/29/2016,"Great location, beautiful decorated and full of flair. Food was fair, my fish tacos were a Tasty but rice was Dry and cold and the beans were very tasty but not hot at all.  Server was knowledgable and very attentive.  It's good for lunch at the mall but defiantly not worth a trip just for the food"
Ed C.,"Bradenton, FL",0,16,16,1.0,8/4/2016,"Awful food , very skimpy portions !! We ordered the roast beef sandwich, don't bother!! Wife got chicken sandwich with guacamole , better at McDonald's !! Cheesecake was good, half off but portion looked half size  not worth the wait . Overrated in my opinion"
Angela S.,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",1,61,,5.0,6/12/2017,"Love love love the Cheesecake Factory! I've eaten at this one a dozen times and others where we lived. Always good food and good service! Can't say enough about this place except that you'll need a doggie bag--great big portions and so delicious you won't want to leave any behind. The huge selection of cheesecakes will be your hardest decision of the day! A bit pricey, especially if you have a large family, but worth every penny!"
Katherine W.,"Palmetto, FL",0,29,11,4.0,6/2/2017,"You can always count on the Cheesecake Factory! A huge menu but always have fresh new seasonal items as well. A Riesling chicken was a hit with my husband tonight for sure. Bread is so delicious and love their willingness to refill too! Shepard's Pie is always a go to!  Our service tonight was outstanding. They were very busy, but completely attentive like we were there only customers, thank you. Mall restaurant with resort service!  Our compliments to the manager and his staff!"
Nicholas M.,"Chicago, IL",274,8,,5.0,5/24/2017,"After a long day of walking around the mall my group had burned off a lot of calories. What better way to refuel than a 1600+ calorie entrée and a 1500+ cheesecake. If you are going to splurge on a meal and have a cheat day, come to The Cheesecake Factory and get PHAT. Loved the meal, loved sitting outside with friends, great experience!"
Hnick M.,"Bradenton, FL",1,32,,2.0,1/2/2017,"Two stars? Not for the food but for the management policy. We have eaten here many times and had decent food and service. Certainly nothing to complain about. Usually we order two entrees and they are always huge. We have enough for lunch the next day and sometimes the day after. So, we thought we'd try something different -- let's split and entree. We ordered a beer and a wine (not the cheapest place for those, BTW) and a side salad. The entree arrived and it was barely large enough for one person. Aha, we said! This is how they discourage a couple from splitting an entree. We guess policies like this are what allows the restaurant GM to drive a company BMW.  Not sure we'll ever go back -- we hate getting cheated!"
Kathie A.,"Bozeman, MT",7,2,,2.0,7/4/2016,"Worst service I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  1. Arrived at shift change, new waitress not aware.  2. With a small child, children's menu never brought and surprised we'd want one. 3. 6 of us plus child and each order was brought out separately with the child's food brought last.  4. Under cooked food, asked to be re-done, brought out when everyone was almost done eating.  5. And worst of all, the waitress was COMPLETELY unaware and oblivious. Either her first day of work or needs to be her last. (Amy, don't make a career of waiting tables)."
L S.,"Coventry, RI",0,111,31,3.0,6/23/2016,"Sarasota location review only Good lunch. Busy place, outside seating,, located right in front of valet parking at mall. I had a great mojito, unfortunately it was $12!  Seriously?  Appetizer  Pizza -date, bacon  and Gorgonzola was a good  concept just needed more flavor maybe a date purée base Fish tacos for me, hubs had a cheeseburger, mom had soup, sandwich ,salad combo  was all ok,  the menu is wayyyy too big   Overall, good lunch, overpriced drinks"
Lexie F.,"Bradenton, FL",87,36,25,4.0,1/29/2017,"Had dinner here tonight with a friend. I had the crispy shrimp sandwich and the strawberry shortcake and both items were very good. My friend had the bacon burger and the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake and he could not rave more about both items. Overall a good experience, was busy but the wait was not incredibly long."
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",847,2344,2388,3.0,8/18/2015,"I was pleased that we didn't have much of a wait. 15 minutes on a Friday evening is almost unheard of. However... once we were seated, things seemed to fall apart. Both myself and my guest ordered our meat Med Rare. What we ended up getting was Well Done. How does someone screw that up? I also ordered mine with No bun and no onions, and of course both were present on the plate. My friend had hers remade, but I went ahead and ate mine, taking off the things I didn't want. Frankly, I just didn't want to wait again. It was getting later and more busy..  The grilled Artichoke however, was to die for. I suggest that to anyone!"
Robbie F.,"Sarasota, FL",87,33,13,3.0,10/30/2016,It's a Cheesecake Factory. Portions are on the smaller side compared to actual Cheesecake Factory like the one in Tampa. Booth we were in was a bit small and I'm not very big. Food itself is good. Maybe I'm being too harsh but this one is connected to a The Mall at UTC. Only really should go there for the Cheesecake.
Trish W.,"Parrish, FL",0,26,2,5.0,1/16/2017,"I would give this more stars if there were more. The best food, atmosphere and cheesecake I have ever had. The portions are large and the waitstaff is excellent. I would recomend splitting a meal since the portions are so large. I will definitely be back! As a matter of fact I can't wait."
Hugo P.,"Bee Ridge, FL",2,2,,1.0,1/27/2016,Called to make a reservation and the young lady told me that they do not take reservations for the evening???? Even though web page says they do...Not cool!
David R.,"Loganville, GA",3,31,,1.0,7/9/2016,"We were there this afternoon around 3:30PM. We waited in line for about 5 minutes at the hostess station. One of the hostesses gave us an electronic notifier and told us the wait time was 10 minutes. We stayed in the entrance area and when the waiting seats came open, we sat. After around 20 minutes, the buzzer went off and we walked the 4 steps over to the hostess station where the girl took our buzzer and had us stand to the left of the station with a few other parties that had been waiting. We stood there in that line for another 15 minutes and watched a few other parties get seated that were clearly there after we were. The couple in front of us started complaining because they noticed the same thing happening to them too. After two confused seating hostesses chatted back and forth we were all told that they were no longer seating inside and if we wanted to wait, we would have to sit outside.  We just plain left. (So did two other parties as well!) No managers were around, the hostess staff in this restaurant could care less, are cold, unfriendly and just plain unprofessional! The waiters all look unhappy, stressed and were not friendly or polite either. Most just shoved their way around and through people like we were just some insignificant obstacles in their paths. I have never been to one of these restaurants before, and quite frankly, I won't bother to try again! If this is the kind of example they preset in an upscale mall... forget it. I can spend $5 at Burger King, get two Whopper meals and have them give me the wrong drink, at least that will only take 3 minutes and I'll still be fed. Sheesh! Piss pore service from a bunch of disgruntled employees that could care less about customers is not a way to run a business... well, not one that will succeed here anyway. We went around the corner to the Yo Sushi place in the mall. We probably spent more money, but we had exceptional service, a good time and I will certainly go back there! And one of my lady friends even got green tea cheesecake that she liked very much!  So, don't waste your time or money at this establishment, save yourself the aggregation and find someplace BETTER. (And the 1 star rating was because Yelp won't let me post this with no stars!!!)"
Paxton S.,"Sykesville, PA",52,28,11,4.0,1/21/2016,"This was my first time to a Cheesecake Factory, and it was worth the wait. I've heard nothing but good things about the franchise as a whole, and this location did not disappoint.  The food, service, environment, atmosphere and attitude of our waitress (I think her name was Ashley) were all top notch. The only thing that keeps me from making this a 5-star rating is that there was nothing that blew me away. It was just a nice part of a nice mall. Not that I expected our food to be delivered by trapeze or anything. It just felt that somehow, maybe something here or there could have been better."
HR M.,"Lithia, FL",0,83,29,1.0,12/20/2015,"Nothing great here. Cheesecake Factory in general has gone down hill in the last few years. Portions are smaller and a lot of changes in the recipes of items on the menu. Meaning it has the same name but is not what it was anymore.  This experience not so good today. My son ordered simple bow tie pasta. When it came it was so salty, he could not eat it. After sending back, we were informed that a replacement would be the same as that is the new recipe. Meaning, Cheesecake Factory is incapable of boiling water and cooking pasta without overloading it with salt??? I tried the California Avocado Salad. I won't get it again. It should be called Cilantro Salad and some other stuff (but mostly cilantro). My wife ordered the Kale Quinoa salad which she has had a few times before. Oddly, there were parts of the Cilantro Salad in hers.  We'll probably stay away from this location in the future. There are other better options and this is sure not worth the usual long wait at Cheesecake Factory."
