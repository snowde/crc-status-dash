Sophia R.,"Bradenton, FL",0,52,3,5.0,3/7/2016,"Always awesome experience. Small plates, appetizers or full menu items. Variety of fresh salads and much much more.  Clean and bright ambience and friendly service. Then THE cheesecake choices endless and fat free too."
LA A.,"Miami, FL",1,68,,1.0,2/18/2017,1 hour wait turns into a 2 and a half with only average food that's overpriced and along with unfriendly staff that don't tend to their customers
Lisa J.,"Parrish, FL",1,10,1,4.0,11/1/2016,I just love the Cheesecake Factory. They are consistent from restaurant to another on the quality of there food and their service. The only complaint I would have about the UTC mall location is that the music is way to loud.
Ed W.,"Gainesville, FL",221,815,1256,2.0,1/11/2016,"Really really slow service. The loaded tator tots were rather bland as was the skinny mojito. This is the last time we eat at one of these places. The last three times have been disappointing. Not just here, but in other locations as well."
Carla R.,"Sarasota, FL",0,1,,2.0,5/12/2017,"I have never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory, however, last night was pretty bad. We were sat at 9:10pm and we ordered 2 appetizers and an entrée. After waiting 25 minutes, we received one of the appetizers and then received the other about 10 minutes later. By the time our entrée arrived, we were ready to go. There is no reason to wait 40 minutes for stuffed mushrooms. Our waitress was kind enough to comp the entrée since I no longer wanted it. Hopefully the kitchen will get their act together."
Kim P.,"Sarasota, FL",151,112,203,5.0,5/16/2015,I had the thai lettuce wraps which were awesome! I would definitely come back just for this dish. There is always a wait but worth it. Heard there's a 4 hour wait on Friday nights. The service was good.
Lyssa M.,"Bradenton, FL",36,32,,1.0,5/28/2016,"The 2 stars are for our service only. My friends and I have been in there to meet up 3 or 4 times now and for some reason we just can't seem to get treated well.  One of my friends was just getting off her job bartending and she was hungry she wanted to go to CF so myself and my other friend headed that way and she was going to follow, granted this is about 10:45pm and they close at 11:30.  We were just having a drink and apps and of course cheesecake! Our servers name was David and that's about all we got out of him....my one friend who was with me tried to engage him in conversation which  somehow annoyed him because he very openly said in front of us to his manager he didn't want to wait on us...by this time our other friend showed up and she wants to order but now we have no server and time is flying by...we ask to speak to a manager.  The manager comes over and gets us a very nice young lady who was actually ending her night but picked us up as a favor to her boss and apparently DAVID.   When we told the manager what had happened he said ""we aren't going to talk about that""  he basically dismissed this employees rude behavior towards myself and my friends. When we left it was all we talked about, it was absolutely confusing and made us all feel really uncomfortable. The worst part was that my bartender friend didn't even get to eat except for soup.. When we called the next day we spoke with Brian the day manager, who I relayed the whole incident to.  Brian assured us that this is not normal behavior he asked if the manager did anything to compensate, which is a  no.  It was a hundred dollars to have a miserable time. Not to mention that the manager kept trying to put his arm around my friends which was highly offensive and I cannot believe that is acceptable behavior. In closing the food is okay, they don't have anything that you can't find anywhere else, except maybe HUGE pieces of cheesecake. Food is not so good that It's worth being treated poorly."
Laura E.,"Bradenton, FL",0,3,,1.0,4/14/2017,"The new management here, since Feb 2017 at least, is terrible. Service has gotten very bad and no one is the slightest bit apologetic about it. Cheesecake Factory has always had long waits, but in the past I feel the service was top-notch. Unfortunately, it's all gone down hill. Food was sloppily prepared and delivered to our table 1 hour after sitting down. Manager basically said, ""What do you expect me to do about it?"""
Carol U.,"Bradenton, FL",0,62,,2.0,5/29/2016,"Good service in the bar area, large servings but overall over priced regular food. Meatloaf and potatoes very salty, Luna salad fresh ingredients but chicken was bland."
Billy B.,"Powell, OH",6,64,6,4.0,8/22/2016,Great!  I had the smokehouse burger. Can't go wrong. Cookie dough cheesecake is amazing. Had to eat outside due to wait time. Wish they took reservations.
Kathy H.,"Sarasota, FL",4,25,1,3.0,5/12/2016,"Average chain food.  My husband had wings, which he enjoyed, but the blue cheese was like water.  Come on now... how much could they be saving by watering down salad dressing??"
Kay C.,"Fort Myers, FL",56,157,107,5.0,1/8/2016,"How can you go wrong with Cheesecake Factory!! If you have not been, just go and enjoy! Was there for New Years Eve dinner and I have nothing bad to say. No wait that nigh which in unusual because they are always packed, great serves, great food (large portions) and outside seating was nice."
Tyler K.,"Bradenton, FL",118,10,,3.0,11/25/2016,"Ugh. Do you just have one of those days where nothing seems to go your way? One of those days where is just seems to really drag? Well that was today for me. I got home and my girlfriend suggested we get cheesecake (which sounded PERFECT!). I called their ToGo line and ordered my girlfriend strawberry cheesecake. I, myself am a carrot cake cheese cake kinda guy, so I ordered that. After getting to the restaurant about 10 minutes after I hung up the phone the cashier proceeded to talk with someone else in the bakery about ""change for a 20"" or whatever. While seeing me the whole time! Whatever, not a huge deal. I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I can understand how things like that happen. I get home to then open the bag and noticed they put regular carrot cake in the bag. UGH!!! That's not ok!! This isn't the first time it's happened. I called the restaurant and talked with Ariel about the situation. She was genuinely apologetic but it just doesn't make it better. I really wish you guys would have gotten it right the first time or at least read the order back to me :/"
Dylan R.,"Sarasota, FL",0,15,2,3.0,10/9/2015,"Came in earlier today for the first time for dinner. Everything was okay, no real complaints just can't say there was very much that really wowed me.  Was surprised that I didn't have to wait very long for table, suppose I came in at a good time because right after my girlfriend and I took our seats the place started packing up. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was good but not great. About what I expected it would be from a place like this. Better than  It could of been but not the real thing. Honestly probably should of ordered something else but I was really craving a Cuban lately. The fries that came with it were very bland and not very good, the same you would expect from an Applebee's. My girlfriend ordered the Mac and cheese burger and that was probably the best thing we ordered. Although I wasn't much of a fan of the Mac and Cheese part, the burger itself was fantastic. The meat was cooked perfect and it was very tasty. It was one of the few things that surprised me.  The server was also very nice and checked in regularly making sure we were happy. I feel bad for only giving three stars, if I could give another half star I would but I don't feel like this trip deserved four stars. I'll probably come in again sometime and try something else. I can see it earning a better rating from me than the Cuban just really threw me off"
Alex P.,"Sarasota, FL",6,46,4,4.0,7/30/2015,"Had a pretty good experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. If you're going for dinner, try to go early if possible - or make a reservation. I was previously advised that they take reservations Monday through Thursday, but on the weekends they have no reservation system in place. This location is extremely busy - when we arrived for dinner at 4:00 PM on a Sunday, the wait was up to 30 minutes and by the time our table was ready around 4:30, the wait was up to 45 minutes. I've also heard of the wait time easily reaching up to 90 minutes on Friday / Saturday nights.  Anyway, the dinner experience overall was quite nice! The atmosphere can get a little loud due to the restaurant being so crowded, but overall it's a pretty nicely decorated Cheesecake Factory. The menu can be a little overwhelming at times considering there are over 100 different items to choose from, but I've never ordered something I didn't end up liking. My favorite is the Chicken Di Pana - breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli in a creamy white wine sauce - very delicious! My Dad ordered the spaghetti with meatballs - which he said was very good. After dinner, I ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake which was so delicious as it seemed to have a perfect balance of rich and sweet while being slightly tart. Another thing to be aware of are the portion sizes. Most of the menu items come out in portions large enough for two. Perfect for eating a normal portion there and taking the rest home for a great lunch the next day. They also have a ""Skinny Menu"" which is great for lighter and low calorie options. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory was pretty good - and proven to be comparable with any other location. Service was alright, friendly, but not very attentive - once again, due to so many tables being constantly turned. I will recommend, but be aware of the long wait times!"
Patti K.,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",251,211,250,3.0,2/26/2015,"Service is hit or miss. We've had a couple waitresses who just don't care and then we have had some FABULOUS waitresses (Ariel has been the best so far).  The food is mostly good, clean restaurant. I do not like the table seating, or sitting right next to strangers so we always ask for a booth.  Expensive for the slow service in the kitchen."
Victoria M.,"Tampa, FL",2,29,38,2.0,11/13/2016,"The food is good and they have a great menu that is lower calorie as well. I love the salad choices and the spring tools were delicious. That being said we couldn't stay for dessert because we opted to sit outside and my sisters were both subjected to bright sun on their back and arm/shoulder for the other sister. It was so bad that my second sister had a sunburn. I wouldn't complain, but the waitress never bothered to put a screen down that the restaurant apparently has for just this problem ( we didn't know it was there and when we mentioned the sun the waitress just smiled, said yeah it's hot out here and walked away). Magically this screen came down as we were paying the bill because my sisters were both too miserable to even think about dessert. Disappointing. Shame on our server and on management. Ps- we never had drink refills during our entire meal, even after asking because the ladies were sweating."
Helen L.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",68,178,199,4.0,2/7/2015,My boyfriend came here on a Saturday night around 8:30pm knowing it would be busy. We were told it would be an 80 minute wait. We walked around the UTC Mall till 9 but decided it would just be quicker to get take out instead of dining there. Our order was ready in 20 minutes and tasted the same as if we were eating there. I got the Chicken Di Pana and he got the Shepherd's Pie. Both were really good.
Diana K.,"Sun City Center, FL",69,87,166,5.0,2/26/2016,Very delicious food. Best service ever. Carrie our server was awesome. We were seated very quickly when we got to the restaurant. The restaurant is located right in the middle of the mall and convenient to walk to. I will definitely come back to Cheesecake Factory again.
Gretel M.,"Greensboro, NC",26,47,136,5.0,1/4/2016,"Brought family including two grandparents in their 90s and the manager was extremely sweet. Patient even came over to chat a them about their visit. Very impressed. Our waitor was polite prompt and very knowledgable on vegetarian items. Overall, great service."
