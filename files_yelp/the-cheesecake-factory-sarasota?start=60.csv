Ronnie D.,"Bradenton, FL",106,16,2,5.0,4/28/2016,"LOVE their veggie burger!  Can't say enough about their cheesecakes- sometimes have a long wait, but it's worth it!  Very nice setting, and even their bathrooms are trendy!"
Rob B.,"Kaneohe, HI",227,1086,877,4.0,1/9/2015,"Always dependable and always well staffed, this new CC outlet is right up to speed in no time. Outside seating is delightful despite the view of asphalt and cars. The white umbrellas of Brio might be a better idea than the black all covering awning."
Felicia Q.,"Ridley Park, PA",7,21,2,1.0,12/3/2015,I should have known that food from a factory would taste like food from a factory. Crappy chicken on sticks and frozen/stale cheesecake. What was I thinking? Just because people wait in line doesn't mean it's good.
Jennifer K.,"Bradenton, FL",84,189,183,5.0,10/27/2014,"So many choices!! Must have cheesecake when u come here even if you have to take it To Go.  Cheesecake favs: fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes, orange chicken, key lime cheesecake."
S A.,"Sarasota, FL",7,28,7,2.0,7/24/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory normally but this location's service is awful.. Been here three times.. The first time my pizza was raw and cold sent it back..2nd time my mother in laws food never came out..and we just went tonight and my appetizer never came out, I brought it up while my meal came out and the waiter said sorry and put it in after the fact. I said I didn't really wanted it but he insisted and then keep it on the bill. I'm not picky but if I'm paying a lot of money for a meal I expect the service to be decent.   Won't be back to this location."
Raul M.,"Palmetto, FL",0,33,2,5.0,10/7/2016,Food was awesome and service was great.  Hibachi steak rocked and salad was very good.
Svitlana M.,"Sarasota, FL",16,57,3,4.0,9/13/2015,"Love this place for theirs zucchini fries and fried calamaries. Calamaries taste the best with white garlic sauce that they serve zucchini with, ask for it. Also like their variety of meals: you will be lost choosing the one because there are so many yummy choices."
R A.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,3,9,5.0,2/22/2016,My wife and I went in there on our wedding day after the ceremony had nice coffee and a wonderful dessert and they treated us wonderfully we would certainly go back especially thanks to vito  the manager and Tim are server
Emily M.,"Sarasota, FL",1,6,1,1.0,6/1/2016,"HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!! Been here many times to see if it gets better, DID NOT HAPPEN. I do not know who has the time to wait for garbage food. You go there wait an hour or more just to get horrible food and service. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL!!"
Crystal L.,"Sarasota, FL",0,2,1,1.0,5/2/2016,"Ive had a few bad experiences here. We ordered the orange chicken with white rice. the rice was burnt, crunchy, just completely overcooked. I ordered the scampi and salmon plate and thought that the scampi came with linguinie or some form of pasta, i asked and the waitress said it doesnt but she could bring me a side of the pasta. I got exactly that. A tiny appetizer sized bowl of pasta, soggy and overcooked (like everything!) And by the time i got it the i had already finished the rest of my plate. The manager came over and offered to get me pasta with the sauce on it. He came back with the same pasta and handed me the plate and it actually burned my hand due to the fact that it was put in the microwave for who knows how long. Didnt apologize just said ""is something wrong"". Another time more recently we ordered our drinks, sparking water with lemon and ice and a water. Waitress asked if we wanted bread we said yes. Probably 10 minutes pass and she comes with the wrong drinks, and doesnt bring any bread but instead of fixing it she  immedietly goes to another table and before even taking their drink order sets the bread down (you know the bread that we asked for and that was on the tray with our drinks) for them without asking if they wanted any. Not setting foot in there again."
Ned E.,"Bradenton, FL",0,21,,5.0,2/2/2016,"Super expensive, but when you take a bite of a slice of cheesecake you wouldn't mind paying double for it. Cheesecake is an absolute delicacy."
Samie M.,"North Port, FL",66,19,6,2.0,7/29/2015,First time I ever had a totally disappointing experience. Two of the favorite things on the menu that I heat are tired and the skinny artichoke semicolon neither one of them lived up to the expectations and previously hoarder exceptional value. I will say that the server was awesome unfortunately the food totally disappointed.
Fuzzy B.,"Seattle, WA",1,51,,5.0,8/15/2015,"Cheesecake Factory always gets 5 stars from my wife.  It is her happy place.  She got the miso salmon and it was really good.  I had the seared tuna salad, which actually didn't have enough salad - but plenty of tuna."
John H.,"Wellington, FL",0,22,,3.0,6/19/2016,Always order Steak Diane and it is delicious..... Was extremely salty.  We had both ordered and could not finish our meals.  Hope this will be corrected in the future.
Cristina T.,"Sarasota, FL",58,78,29,4.0,7/6/2015,I had a good experience here. We waited fifteen minutes for a table which isn't so bad for Sunday afternoon. The service was friendly and attentive. I had the pizza lunch special. A small portofino pizza and a side salad. The pizza was delicious! If you like a little spice I would suggest this pizza. The Calabrese peppers added a nice kick to the pizza. I really enjoyed my meal. My boyfriend had the avocado chicken club and  it was huge but he licked the plate clean. Both of our meals were delicious. Will be returning.
Joyce C.,"Cleverdale, NY",9,93,3,2.0,1/17/2015,"Went there this evening about 10:00 for cappuccino and a dessert.  No wait, a good thing.  My husband's cappuccino came out almost warm, my latte hot.  But I ordered a cappuccino.  Server brought over a cappuccino after realizing the mistake, it too was almost warm.  I kept the latte.  My husband's cappuccino was replaced with a hot one.  Apple crisp huge, enough for 2 and more, but a little too sweet.  Ate it, so couldn't have been too bad... Watching the servers, and the young women behind the dessert counter is something you should see at Five Guys.  Very unprofessional giggly dancing to the music girls doing the desserts.  One tipped over a dessert to go, yes in a plastic box, but made no attempt to make sure it still looked right.  Five ""girls"" behind the counter, it is what it is... We have a Cheesecake Factory in Albany, the difference is night and day.  The staff a little older and you feel like you are at a nice restaurant.  Have been at Cheesecake Factories in Baltimore, Orlando and Long Island, always professional...need to class up the place...."
Macy M.,"Bradenton, FL",0,2,1,2.0,7/20/2015,"When we were first seated near the kitchen, I noticed flies on the glass dividing wall which was pretty gross. Our waiter was mediocre at best and honestly I've had way better service at Applebee's than I have had today. We were never offered bread and I saw tables surrounding us with attentive servers and it honestly made me pretty offended that our server didn't provide us good service. The food was okay, definitely not up to par with my expectations."
Nathan N.,"Charleston, SC",75,5,,5.0,7/20/2015,Never had a bad meal at this place. Wait staff are always on point. Cheesecake is so fattening you could die if you eat too much. Pasta daVinci is amazing!
Courtney H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",7,40,118,2.0,2/1/2015,Horrible service ok food.  We had a gift card for here and decided to eat lunch on a Sunday. The wait was 45min which isn't bad but the service and attentiveness of the waitress was subpar. The food wasn't bad at all just not a great experience. It's loud and basically a madhouse! We ate outside and honestly that is the only semi quiet place to dine. Be ready for good food but stressful experience. Now where's my waitress? I need a refill.
Darryl D.,"Sarasota, FL",4,9,9,5.0,12/2/2014,Only ten minutes to wait!!!  Server was great food fantastic had a great late afternoon lunch with 2 friends
