Michael S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",5,41,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Too loud, too slow, food just so so. Went for lunch and was told it would be a 15 minute wait. It turned out to be a 45 minute wait. Then another 15 minutes to get water and bread. Then another 45 minutes to get our entrée. Food is mediocre, served in large portions. Totally not worth the time."
Larry C.,"Bradenton, FL",0,16,,1.0,8/2/2016,"One of the worst experiences at a restaurant. We order food to go (pickup) since the wait here to eat in is usually 20-25 minutes . My wife ordered , I arrived on time , fought thru the crown at the door to get to the pastry counter where our order was ready and waiting , I approached the counter only to get snapped at to go to the end of the line .Well the line was for cheesecake orders and extended well into the restaurant and I was told it's only a 20-25 minute wait, 20 -25 minute wait to avoid the wait and order to go with our food in site and getting cold .I walked out ,called my wife, who then called the manager .Have him go back to the counter , tell them his food is right there and it is to go . I did and was immediately told again to go to the back of the line it's only a 20 - 25 minute wait , UNBELIEVABLE. I walked out with no food never to return. This place is too busy and they don't need me or you as customers .Well ,at least for now ,. With horrible service like this the management will certainly eliminate the wait line."
C K.,"Sarasota, FL",0,233,7,3.0,12/28/2014,"If you like the Cheesecake Factory, then 5 stars. Not really my thing. Too noisy and the food is not significantly better than other places."
Brett R.,"Bradenton, FL",18,9,1,4.0,7/4/2015,"Great food, great service, great cheesecake. Low cal meals are good for the waistline and the atmosphere was great!"
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/29/2014,"Wow I heard that this Cheesecake Factory just opened last week this Cheesecake Factory it is so fancy,modern and clean.The staff is really friendly and food is still awesome like all the other ones around.This is a great location for a Cheesecake Factory.Its located in the Sarasota University Town Center Mall I will come back to this location if I'm on vacation or if I'm working in Sarasota for the day"
Alicia R.,"Sarasota, FL",149,4,,2.0,11/11/2014,"While I have been to other Cheesecake Factories elsewhere, I was not impressed by the newest addition to Sarasota. The restaurant was much smaller than others, making it near impossible to stand where we were told to wait for a hostess to seat us, without being run over by a server. The food was ridiculously priced, as with most locations, however, this location's quality was definitely not worth the money.  While I know it's a new location, it's got a long way to go before it meets the standards of others."
Bonnie S.,"Riverview, FL",0,12,,1.0,9/22/2015,"Ok every time that I order something from Cheesecake factory In UTC Sarasota my order is never right. Very very disappointed. I have ordered several times to  go. I had a Burger that I asked to be cooked Med/well and it was very rare in the middle. ..not good. The second time.. items that were supposed to be in the salad were not (I have had this salad at another CCF and it was fine). The third time I had ordered the Club Sandwich with extra mayo again to go.....well ,there was NO extra mayo. There was hardly any mayo on it at all.....I muat say it was VERY dry. PLUS... it looked like they used the very end of whatever bread they had. NO ketchup for fries.  My last order ....ordered the same salad because it's my favorite...missing the Avacado. I must say that someone is not making sure that to go orders are what they should be before they are sent out to the customer. The last order ....was my last to go order with the UTC Cheesecake Factory. ..very disappointed.  Please check your to go orders!!"
Rhiannon M.,"Punta Gorda, FL",1,17,22,4.0,4/12/2015,"The food was as good as always, our waitress was nice. We sat outside in april, it was pretty hot and there were flies every where.  We ordered our kids food when we sat down, and the order got lost. They fixed it quickly. It is a busy restaurant,  it was about what I expected."
J M.,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",0,9,,1.0,8/11/2015,Called to make reservation and was told they do not take them in Sarasota although website says they do. Girl answering the phone not helpful and rather rude. Probably the food not worth the aggravation of rude help.
Teresa H.,"Tallahassee, FL",53,8,,3.0,2/16/2015,"I am sure that this cheesecake factory is just as amazing as all the other ones, but it is SO small and when we tried to get in for lunch at 11:30 there was a 30 minute wait."
Randy K.,"Bradenton, FL",0,279,1,4.0,11/16/2014,"The menu is enormous, as are the portions.  Our delicious Chicken Marsala was more than enough to share, with 3 chicken cutlets and very tasty sauce.  The cheesecake selection is plentiful, all very good.  We've had other dishes from the menu at other Cheesecake Factories and have never been disappointed.  Our server, Rob, was friendly and humorous.  The front desk hostess, however, was incompetent and overwhelmed.  Their no-reservations, no-call-ahead policy is tough to deal with, as the restaurant is very crowded at dinner time.  It's very noisy as well.  Rob asked to have the pounding music turned down.  It helped a little, but management wouldn't turn it off.  Go here at lunch or off times for a better experience."
Barbara M.,"Sarasota, FL",2,5,,2.0,6/27/2015,"mom and I wanted for AWHILE to go here. all I can say it thank goodness for gift cards!   we both got the soup and salad lunch plate. you DO NOT get a choice of dressing, it's their house dressing, and the soup tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile and all they did was heat it up.  we will not be returning"
