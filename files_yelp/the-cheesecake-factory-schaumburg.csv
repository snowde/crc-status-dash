Felice C.,"Morton Grove, IL",363,157,499,4.0,12/9/2017,"It's always a good time at the Cheesecake Factory. They have good service and their food is always delicious and consistent. This is one of the places where you get one thing that's your favorite, and you never stray from it--despite their huge menu.  I always get the Chicken Bellagio--which come with basil spaghetti, chicken, arugula, and prosciutto. And for dessert, I always get the tiramisu cheesecake. Definitely solid options and never disappoint me."
Angel S.,"Lake Forest, IL",0,23,10,1.0,1/1/2018,"New Years, I understand, it's a Holiday but for me to get my meal and my husbands took an hour. Yes, one hour.  Our server we thought was our helper was then transferred to our ""original server"" whom was on break at that time, our server never came to ask us how our food was.  Meal: Sausage and Shrimp Pasta It was extremely hot to the touch where the noodle sauce looked dry as if it was under a heat lamp for a long time and the portion was INCREDIBLY SMALL. I tried to ""fluff"" it up with a fork with no prevail.  My husband got the ""lunch"" portion as I got the glutinous dinner portion and it was the exact same size or less then his. I wanted to humanely and kindly complain about the portion size since my meal was approximately $20 with crust sauce but the server never refilled our drinks or asked how our meal was.  First bad experience at Cheesecake Factory."
Ann Y.,"Arlington Heights, IL",177,351,13,1.0,12/13/2017,"I am not sure what is going on with service tonight, but I am quite frustrated with both here and Coopers Hawk.  I decided to stop by and get cheesecake for myself and my husband, I arrive and it is not busy. I look at the cheesecake and step to the side to order. Meanwhile not a single person on the staff acknowledged me. I wait and wait and wait and finally someone said can I help you. I gave my order to which they said I needed to go the other side to order and wait even more. Finally I ordered and was told to wait at the other side. I wait and wait and wait. Finally I am told my order was waiting on the other side. I expressed my frustration to which they shrugged. I ask for a manager who not only talked down to me cause I was looking at my phone (to see how long It was taking) and was very demeaning in his voice to apologize. I don't get what has happened to service, but one thing I learned is that I am done with chains."
Karen K.,"Carol Stream, IL",63,115,255,4.0,11/28/2017,"On Black Friday, at the Woodfield Mall, my sister and I were all shopped-out and famished!  Thankfully The Cheesecake Factory is at the mall, and have a huge menu which would more than suit our nom-needs! I ordered the Tex-Mex eggrolls as a ""light"" meal.  They were super greasy (there was so much oil in the bottom of the bowl, that I could cook a whole dinner in it!), but also super delicious! My sister is ""eating clean,"" for 6 months, in order to heal her gut, and so she ordered a veggie omelet, no cheese, with a side of potatoes (per request, not cooked in butter).  The omelet was dry only because she couldn't order any cheese.  It wasn't TCF's fault.  But she did say the veggies were tasty!  The potatoes also had a unique seasoning to them and she raved about them.   Of course, I couldn't leave a Cheesecake Factory without getting a slice (and regretfully eating it in front of my poor sister...).  The salted caramel slice was pretty good, but I actually like my homemade samoa cheesecake better (which I still had a half of left at home from Thanksgiving!). I will be back for a different slice next time!"
Angelika S.,"Chicago, IL",52,52,71,5.0,12/20/2017,"I was there like 20 times, each time I enjoyed it. Catfish dinner is amazing after 3 hours on mall. Fish tacos  are worth to try. Cheesecakes obviously are must try, my favorite one is the original one because it's not too sweet. Service fast and well organized. This is not the place you want to make trip for, but definitely the best option on woodfield mall."
Ruchi S.,"Champaign, IL",31,154,402,4.0,9/3/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory a lot of times and have always enjoyed my meal.  I loved my booth at this location, it felt so romantic. I ordered crab bites, fried mac and cheese, angel hair pasta with shrimps and tomato & mozzarella flat bread. I loved the fried mac and cheese with marinara. The garlicky sauce was so good. Crab bites were little under seasoned but still tasted good. Pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was yum but shrimps were little overcoooked :(. Flatbread tasted good and did not need any sauce. Overall, a great experience as usual."
Megha V.,"Homer Glen, IL",104,12,22,5.0,12/19/2017,"This place never disappoints me! Servers are super friendly! We always get our food on time! Hot n' Fresh! Love the dim ambience of this location. You can't go home without having a slice of cheesecake! Make sure to share it though, you won't be able to finish it! Godiva cheesecake and tiramisu cheesecake is to die for! Their lunch special portions are more than enough! And a decent price ofcourse! Thank you for an amazing service"
Erica M.,"Bloomington, IL",78,168,190,5.0,11/19/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and Saturday's trip was no exception. We arrived around noon on Saturday. I thought we would have to wait as the restaurant seemed super busy but we were seated right away.  Our waiter was very friendly and he stopped by often to the check on us. To eat, I had the chicken taquitos and my husband had the orange chicken. Both plates were excellent. We split the Strawberry cheesecake for dessert. I typically have more of a chocolate flavored cheesecake and I was so pleasantly surprised to have the strawberry as my favorite.  It was so simple but delicious.  I will order it again when I come back."
Jason P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",666,726,208,4.0,8/22/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is the kind of place you go to once or twice a year.  I say that because any more than that and you get sick of it pretty quick. At one time I was going more often, but then stopped for years because I got sick of it.  The menu is huge, so yes you do have a lot to pick from.  You could probably go there once a week for a year and get something different each time. It is a big chain restaurant, so going often it feels very generic.  I'm giving 4 stars because it is a fun place with good food, but it's not the best place around."
Amanda D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",25,187,3,4.0,9/4/2017,"Came here with the family tonight been here many many many times just not over the past 5 years to be honest.  BUT it is still just as great!  The menu is huge and you really can't not find something to appease you. The buffalo blasts are great ! avocado egg rolls, fried mozzarella, pot stickers, the chicken dishes, the bbq ranch chicken salad, the pastas, the bread , and the ranch!  I mean i can keep going here lol.  Is it pricey yes,  do you get more for your buck,  no but do you get a lot of food for your buck,  yes.  Drinks are great again pricey but very good and desserts are delicious.  Need to start coming here again more!   Only downfall slower service."
Anastazia V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",73,344,698,3.0,8/10/2017,"Average Cheesecake Factory - this isn't my choice of restaurant to dine at, but we came here for a business dinner as a party of 3.  Service was fine - we were seated at a booth and helped rather quickly.  Good thing about Cheesecake Factory is they have such a large menu there is literally something for everyone.  I ordered a lettuce wrapped burger with fries.  It was pretty good.  We also ordered a grilled cheese sandwich w/ sweet potato fries and pasta w/ sausage.  Everyone seemed to be satisfied with their dinner and walked away happy.  Decent experience and not a bad option in the Woodfield mall area to please everyone's palate."
Alyssa P.,"Toronto, Canada",84,131,128,4.0,7/19/2017,"I finally dined here with my family while they were visiting to see what the cheesecake factory has to offer, besides cheesecake. So upon being seated I was blown away with how many things they offer on their menu.   First of all our server was amazing, I wish I could have remembered her name. She provided great service and some laughs. We all really liked the honey wheat table bread. Warm and fresh with a great flavour. I tried their Nashville hot chicken nuggets which aren't a regular menu offering. We all really enjoyed these, great sauce and flavour. I got the Fresh Country Salad from their skinnylicious menu and would get it again. The rest of my family all got sandwiches with a salad. They all enjoyed the Cuban, the Pit Beef Dip, and the Southwest Chicken. Their caesar salad was pretty good too! They love their cheesecake so we took a few to go.  Now that I have popped my cheesecake factory cherry, I will probably come back again!"
Sherri H.,"Bolingbrook, IL",97,105,125,4.0,8/5/2017,Cheesecake Factory is my second favorite place for dessert & coffee after a dinner date! The staff is always welcoming and the food is good quality! I only wish I could enjoy one visit here without a wait! Otherwise definitely two thumbs up!
Hiral P.,"Schaumburg, IL",4,29,4,5.0,12/23/2017,"Good environment.  Fresh Mexican tacos with chicken  are pretty good. Always enjoy the cheesecake, bloody marrys, mojitos !!:) happy hours are great. Good staff and hostesses."
Rachel W.,"Elgin, IL",112,181,52,3.0,7/26/2017,"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants because I would rather eat some place more local ish. My husband and I picked to have lunch here with his grandparents because they are picky. Cheesecake Factory offers a huge option for everyone. We were seated in a booth for 6 even though there were 4 of us. This was nice because we could spread out.  Our server came and got our drink order. I appreciate that he could tell we were chatting quite a bit and was very polite about it. He took our orders. I ordered a salad that I wanted out before my food. The salad was good, I always get it when I come here, but no one ever cleared the plate. Even when the main food came no one took the salad plate. After a while 2 of the 4 plates were brought out. It was over 5 minutes before mine and my husbands grandma's food came out. The manager (I assume) stopped by after about 3-5 minutes when we asked where the other 2 meals were he said that the chef couldn't send out the missing omelette because it didn't look good enough to be sent out....AKA it wasn't done right. We appreciated that but at the same time we could have been notified sooner and also there was no reason why my shrimp tacos were brought out late.  Other than that little hiccup it was just like any other Cheesecake Factory visit. Good, but nothing to write home about."
Rona H.,"Chicago, IL",130,212,15,5.0,10/16/2017,"It's Friday night around 10 PM, and my friend and I had just gotten out of a comedy show.  My friend and I were too wimpy to attend the late night show, but we're too-over-the-age-of-18 to call it a night at 10 PM at night...   Let's head to the Cheesecake Factory to eat some more just so we don't feel like complete losers!  Voila!  Problem solved. Despite being just two people, they gave us a whole booth. And the waitress did not shame us or give us the evil eye for sharing one slice of cheesecake. Cheers to the Cheesecake Factory for hosting us nerds on a Friday night!  And we still got home before midnight! :p"
Arvin H.,"Addison, IL",199,68,377,3.0,12/29/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a very popular destination for many people.  I get why that is.  It's consist and the food is good, and they have amazing cheesecake.  To me though it's a glorified chain restaurant.   Don't get me wrong, I like the Cheesecake Factory as much the next guy, but the truth of the matter is from my numerous visits.  The food is good, but the menu is a little sporadic and they try to do too much.  They have everything on their menu, and I think that's what make them a good restaurant and nothing above that.  I like that they provide variety, but it's hard to perfect one thing when you have another hundred things that need to be focused on to if you catch where I'm going this this.   There are things though that I do recommend.  The cheesecake is obvious.  The traditional cheesecake with strawberries is my go to.  You can't beat the classic, but if you need a change in pace.  I also enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake.   Other than the cheesecake the only memorable dish I had was the fried mac and cheese balls.  Yea... that's right the fried mac and cheese balls.  Of course everything deep fried can make anything better, that definitely holds true here.  The execution of this dish is what makes it.  The thicker batter allows for a great crunch to hold up to the creaminess of the mac cheese inside, and to have the mac and cheese balls on a bed of a sweet tomato sauce, really completes this appetizer.  It's surprisingly well balanced and just honest to goodness happy fat kid food. Cheesecake Factory has great cheesecake and has an expansive menu, however for the price and food experience, the are a lot of other options that can surpass the Cheesecake Cake.  But if you want consistency, comfortability (in regards to flavor and food), and lot of (safe) options, I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory."
Melissa B.,"Bartlett, IL",12,257,,2.0,12/2/2017,"Don't make the mistake we did of ordering the ""marinara"" sauce for your kid's pasta.  It was nasty, tasted like ketchup.  Even my 7 year old barely touched it and said he didn't like it.  And this kid eats everything.  Letdown."
Rachel W.,"Oxford, MI",0,14,,5.0,10/14/2017,"Seriously loved the food and the service.  I personally got the Evelyn's pasta and a Long Island Iced Tea. Ate it ALL!! Drink great too. ! Then splurged to get dessert, but i got the Apple Crumble... Omgoodness... I cannot describe properly how good this was. Could easily be split through, but i did my best to not. Haha.  Highly recommend."
Reggy H.,"San Jose, CA",24,213,55,5.0,6/13/2017,"Came here on biz and wanted something light, so I ordered the ahi tuna.  It came out super fast and it was on point!  The sauce was amazing and the tuna had the perfect amount of spice.  The bed of brown rice wasn't crunchy like you'd expect and tasted delicious. Since I'm about to go on a diet, I had to order some cheesecake.  I tried the peanut butter, snickers and chocolate and OMG!!!!!  I'm done!  Great food and excellent service!  I will definitely be beck again!"
Lisa M.,"Indianapolis, IN",121,103,178,4.0,5/22/2017,"I used to love getting their cheese pizza! This time I tried the tomato basil pasta- delicious!! The chicken was very tender and not dry. The pasta was amazing as well. Loved the flavors together. I also liked the free bread :) my sister had the pasta dish with mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, chicken, and GF pasta and loved it as well. Very good portion sizes. And of course the cheesecake is always good!"
Cara M.,"Chicago, IL",53,57,83,5.0,5/16/2017,"The service was excellent, as usual. I ordered the veggie burger, which was really good. The first great thing about it was that it was SO filling. I can usually eat a good amount, but almost couldn't finish the sandwich and couldn't eat more than 5 fries afterwards. The flavor tasted a little garlic-y, in a good way. The texture was mostly of brown rice, so it didn't stick together so well. The cheese on top was perfect, it kind of help the burger together and made it deliciously cheesy. All in all, I really liked it."
Lauren O.,"Mokena, IL",34,7,,2.0,12/8/2017,"Food is great. Service is absolutely terrible. No matter what, every time I come here I'm waiting for what feels like hours for a server to greet my table. Then they don't offer me the bread, and I have to ask a host walking by to grab me some. I can't even enjoy going here because the service ruins the experience."
Euniishh L.,"Skokie, IL",274,73,67,4.0,8/28/2016,"It's crazy how busy this place is on a Saturday. Waited for around 20 minutes before my friends and I were seated, but that was fine because we weren't in any rush.  We ordered the avocado roll and the spinach dip for our appetizers and the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The pasta was amazing! I've never had it before and I couldn't believe I'm finding out about this pasta now! I've been here many times in the past, but never ordered this before. If you don't like tomato sauce then you should try this out. The sauce was very creamy and went well with the spaghetti and shrimp. The spinach dip was a miss for me. I usually love it, but this one was too dry and we barely finished half. The avocado rolls was pretty good. It was very rich and filling.  The customer service was good. Our waitress kept asking us if we needed anything and refilled our waters. I think we sat there for almost 3 hours and she never rushed us to leave."
Ms. D.,"Chicago, IL",1,27,9,1.0,12/24/2017,"Nothing has changed. This is my first time at this location. The food is bland and disappointing. I had the potato soup. It was OK. I've had BETTER. The chicken madeira was bland and EXPENSIVE. The mashed potatoes were not good. They charge a lot but the food isn't good. The only thing they do right is the desserts, PERIOD. My main purpose for this review is to address what I believe is a serious issue. For some reason this is the only restaurant chain that places the flatware directly on the surface of the  table instead of wrapping it up in the napkin. How can this be SANITARY? I find it disturbing. I don't care if the table has been wiped. What's in that water, where has that rag been??? I'm done. Desserts only."
Chet M.,"Chicago, IL",38,637,3,4.0,2/13/2017,"I went with a group of coworkers cause it was the crowd pleaser for non adventurous eaters... Anyway, the Mojitos were pretty good and steak dinner whatent bad for $27. Service was pretty good for our group of 20+ wild IT guy types.  The dining room décor has got to go. Major remodel and rebranding needed!"
Kenn W.,"Arlington Heights, IL",18,24,50,4.0,7/1/2017,"It's The Cheesecake Factory which means that you know what you're in for. The food isn't going to be mind blowingly good but it isn't going to be bad either. It's a safe chain restaurant where you're going to get decent food at a reasonable price point. Had the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger (medium rare) and the Pasta with Shrimps & Sausages which were both fine. The sauce that accompanied the pasta was a particular stand out although they were a bit stingy with the amount of shrimps given. Next time around, we've gotta order less so that we have space for their famous cakes!"
MaryJane A.,"Lake County, IL",141,95,14,5.0,2/15/2017,"What's not to love at the cheesecake factory? The food is fabulous, the wait for a table as long. You know it's going to be good!  If you're in a hurry, grab a table in the bar area.  Everyone is waiting for a table in the dining room area. There is no way usually in the bar."
D K.,"Woodridge, IL",0,25,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Wow, just sat at a table in the bar for almost 15 minutes (next to the hostess station) and no one served us.  9:30 on Saturday night and the place is emptying out so they weren't busy. I walk 5 steps the the hostess (who is oblivious to the customers, she talking to the other employees) and ask who is taking care of the bar?  She looks surprised a d said she will get someone. I dont see this ending well.  They were more interested in cleaning than waiting on customers."
C B.,"Chicago, IL",0,34,22,4.0,11/8/2017,I felt like steak & veggies and found what I needed. It was 19.95 for steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I'm following a low carb / keto diet so I substituted the mashed potatoes with spinach. It was excellent! I resisted the temptation to eat some of the bread but used half the butter to up my fat content with the steak and vegetables. If we hadn't had to wait over 40min for our food I would have given 5*.
Mike O.,"Aurora, IL",16,101,15,5.0,1/14/2017,"I have been to many cheesecake factory locations around the U.S.  What I like is consistency in the ""go to"" dishes.  My fav is the Chicken Madeira.  This was prepared perfectly: tender chicken topped with a covering amount of mozzarella, asparagus spears, white mushrooms and Madeira wine.  Best I've had at any CF.  I explained to our server Shannon that our joining party was running behind, and he explained that he was leaving for the day and that he would introduce us to our new server.  I later saw Shannon at the gas station and thanked him for his service."
Carm C.,"Chicago, IL",59,81,13,4.0,2/5/2017,This place is usually one of my stops whenever I'm at Woodfield mall. Sometimes it is a bit too crowded for me but it's a risk we all take depending on the time. The service is always on point and the food is good to great.
Matt R.,"Roselle, IL",1,11,11,5.0,8/25/2017,"After checking out their menu, I had to give the cheesecake here a try so I ordered 2 slices for carryout. It's pricey at $8 per slice, but so worth it! They had my cheesecakes ready within 5 minutes and it was a smooth pickup. I went with the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple and Oreo Dream Extreme. The peanut butter one with the Butterfingers pieces stole the show, but they were both excellent. Huge pieces of Oreo and Butterfinger embedded inside the cheesecake layer. Ridiculously good crumble toppings. I will go here again for sure, but it's probably best to split 1 piece between 2 people because it is a lot of sugar."
Liliana M.,"Houston, TX",105,20,9,4.0,7/27/2017,"Very impressive restaurant! My boyfriend and I walked in on a busy Saturday afternoon and within 10 minutes we were seated. So what I absolutely loved about this place was that they have two entire menus. One of the menus is called the ""Skinnylicious Menu"" and it is a menu with appetizers, salads, pastas, fish, meat, entrees, etc that range from  100 to 800 calories. If you are someone who likes to eat healthy or are on a diet and are trying to limit your calorie intake then I would suggest this place!  I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu a turkey and avocado sandwich with a salad as my side. The sandwich was well toasted and they filled it up with a ton of turkey and avocado. Now the only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because even though the sandwich was good it was not anything that tasted different or better from what I could have made at home. My boyfriend did not order from the Skinnylicious menu, but the regular menu (which also displays how many calories every single dish has!). He ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and it was pretty much 4 medium pieces of tuna on top of some white rice! The tuna was very tasty and fresh! Loved this dish! This dish is a 5 for sure!"
Sara B.,"Hanover Park, IL",1,21,40,4.0,7/25/2017,One of my favorite restaurants in Schaumburg for sure. Such a great selection of food and diverse menu. Everything I've had so far from here is delicious!!! Especially the freshly baked cheesecakes!
Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",223,622,713,2.0,10/15/2016,"I had not been to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodfield Mall for many years. My daughter was visiting and we have very different tastes for food sometimes. This place has a large and diverse menu, so we decided to go. At 6pm on a Wednesday night it was crowded, but we were seated pretty quickly. The service was good. The food was okay - not particularly memorable. I had a burger, which was ordered medium-rare but served well-done. The meat was good, though. The fries, however, were terrible. They tasted like the oil had not been changed recently. I am really not a big eater but I generally finish what I was served. This time, I left the fries after eating only a few. I struggled with how to rate my experience. I like going to Cheesecake Factories that I have been to in other cities. I have good experiences there. This particular one I have had run-ins with before when I did complain about the food. One time, the general manager even stepped in saying I was being unreasonable - I have a food allergy and when they disregarded that and served the meal wrong, he belittled it, refused to replace it and charged us anyway. In fairness, that was a long time ago. But, that is why I had not been back. I guess that's it for me going to this location ever again."
Jenny K.,"Hanover Park, IL",40,194,748,4.0,3/25/2017,"I'm still unsure why this place isn't rated higher. It's the Cheesecake Factory! A classic restaurant that I went to growing up. The food has always been wonderful, and the cheesecakes are divine. My husband and I went last night, and we had a short 20min wait for a table, which isn't bad. We ordered the Vietnamese Summer Rolls as an appetizer. The rolls were delicious, and my favorite sauce was the peanut. My husband loved the spicy chili sauce. The vegetables were fresh and tasty, my only complaint was the skin they used to wrap the roll was overly sticky and thin, so everything kept falling out. For the entree, I ordered the Miso Salmon with Brown Rice. The fish was cooked nicely and the flavors were good. I wish there were more snow peas, but I just ordered a side of asparagus to get my veggie fix. My husband ordered a Shrimp Scampi, and he liked it more than than the Shrimp with Angel Hair that he used  to get. He said the Scampi had stronger flavors. Just a note the Scampi is breaded and lightly fried, so if you don't want fried shrimp get the Shrimp with Angel Hair. There was so much food we didn't even get a chance to order cheesecake. Maybe next time! By the way, I also got a Frozen Iced Mango, and it was awesome. You can really taste the mango purée. I used to order this 15 years ago, and they used a Collins glass, but now it's in a tumbler. Definitely more bang for your buck!!"
Carl G.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,6,,4.0,10/10/2017,"Excellent decor. Service great & food very good with many options. Tuxedo cheesecake awesome!  A little expensive especially if you get drinks, appetizer, meal & cheesecake. Stuffed chicken tortillas were so yummy. Rice might not be liked by all as it had maybe cilantro & lime in it."
Richard R.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",8,36,7,2.0,6/24/2017,"This place is a perfect example of why I can't stand chain restaurants it's almost like they don't care about service or the food quality because people are going to come here regardless just because of the name. So they don't take reservations which I get because people flock here like cattle so need for them to bother with them.  When we finally did get seated and 30 minutes later got to order our drinks and an appetizer, seemed like a little much, I mean I get that you're busy but 30 minutes?  Really? The crab artichoke appetizer we got was a big plate of mayo, couldn't even taste the crab or artichoke. Fast forward 45 minutes we got another round of drinks and finally got to place our entree order...again I mean come on the service is laughable at this point. So the turkey burger I ordered was like a little frown dried out hockey puck and was all around terrible, the good news was the the other four people in my party seemed ok with their food so I guess that works. We took five slices of cheesecake home and I will say, they were delicious, the names fits for sure they know their way around cheesecake. If you ask me, this place sucks, go eat somewhere else and come here to pick up a piece of cheesecake to take home for dessert. I will never be back."
Gina V.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,2,,3.0,12/30/2017,"Our visit started with our server, he was very inhospitable and acted like he did not want to serve us. This was not our first trip to restaurant which offers a vast variety of food but service was horrible! First the server tells us there is no bread then in same sentence we'll let me go look. Then was visibly upset that we did not order drinks from the bar. This was when I realized he was only interested in padding the bill to receive a bigger tip. By this time we just wanted to order food eat and get out of there. I did not mention that this was my birthday dinner. We ordered food waiter never checked on us until we were clearly finished and we asked for to go boxes which waiter said you wanna box them yourself in which I very adamantly responded yes due to I was afraid he would spit in our food while boxing it up. We were never disrespectful to waiter, I strongly do not believe in treating people wrong but I am a VERY generous tipper I always leave at least 20% this night NO this waiter got a 1% tip which I honestly believe was too much. Unfortunately we will not be returning to this restaurant for a long time. It upsets me because the food is really good. The 3 star rating would have been 5 except for poor service."
