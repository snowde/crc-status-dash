Sarah N.,"Chicago, IL",343,348,315,3.0,3/21/2012,"We decided to have lunch with my boyfriend's family here today.  I'm never really a fan of Cheesecake Factory, I feel it's overpriced food that can be cooked by a mediocre person.  Being that it was an invitation to spend quality time with family, it wasn't hard to say, ""YES"".   The hosts were very friendly as we entered the restaurant, pleasant smiles and courteous greetings.  It's always nice to know that the staff is welcoming.  The restaurant was full so that was a good sign that people actually like coming here especially since there are a lot of other restaurants in the area. After being seated, the first thing that came out of my boyfriend's Aunt's mouth was, ""Ooooh, there is something on my spoon.  I guess I won't be using that.""  My boyfriend and I started inspecting our spoons and he found something green stuck on it, like a dried up green pasta that wasn't washed off.  It made me wonder what their kitchen looked like.  Was it clean?  Is the food cooked in sanitary pots and pans?  What else was dirty?  I would have overlooked that thought if it was just one, but two spoons was one too many.  Luckily, after pointing this out to our server, he immediately took it off our hands and replaced them.  He apologized sincerely. Everyone ordered something different.  I just remember what my boyfriend and I ordered.  He ordered the Chicken Fettuccine and I ordered the Jambalaya Pasta.  He said it had too much salt on it.  We suggested he let the server know but one thing about my boyfriend, he doesn't like to complain.  As for mine, it was very tasty and full of flavor.  The chicken was tender and juicy, the pasta had a good spice to it where I could still taste other seasonings than just a burning tongue, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  If I had to nitpick at something, it would have to be how the shrimp didn't taste fresh; it was almost tough and chewy.  Also, the dirty spoons were still swirling in my thoughts and wondered if my plate was clean before they placed the food on it.   At the end of the meal, the waiter took our plates and packed it for us except for my boyfriend's mom's salad.  He forgot she wanted it packed and tossed it away.  To save his mistake, he had the kitchen staff make another for her and packed that in a container and apologized.  What makes a great restaurant isn't just the food but that and the service of the staff.  The server gave us his input on what he liked on the menu and his opinions on the food.  When a server can give you a feedback on the food and explain what is in a dish, it means he/she has tasted it and knows his/her restaurant.  I believe it's important because not everyone knows what they want to order. Our overall experience was good.  But, I probably won't go back for another year."
Stan P.,"Mesa, AZ",3,23,,4.0,11/13/2015,"Host was slightly rude, server waited 10 mins and 24 secs to great us and the bathroom is nasty.  This is our first time here..wtf were we thinking.  I thought this place was alot better than this."
Kavita S.,"Chicago, IL",114,96,130,2.0,7/6/2015,"Went here over the weekend and had a mediocre experience. Their limitless menu is their strength, but it's more of a weakness. Overpriced, low quality, mass-produced fare is how I would describe the menu. Service was okay. The spicy cashew chicken with rice is awful; do not get it. The chicken marsala with mushrooms and bow tie pasta is average. The chicken quesadillas were good, but there's really no way to screw up quesadillas! The sweet corn tamale cakes were delicious. The Cheesecake Factory shouldn't be your first pick if you're looking for a decent meal before/during/after shopping."
S G.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,5.0,3/13/2016,"Shout out to the waitress my fiance and I had, Zoey, who was an absolute gem despite the busy Sunday night. My burger was late coming out and management took it off the check, but Zoey was amazing. So sweet and never looked frazzled despite me watching her run around like a mad woman. Delicious food, great service. Kudos to Zoey who should get a dang raise for being so great!"
s p.,"Bartlett, IL",0,26,,4.0,5/21/2016,"Always a great place if even just for cheesecake. Last visit, the burger was raw in the middle after ordering medium well. The Vietnamese spring rolls used to be great when they came as three whole spring rolls and what I looked forward to but aren't delicious anymore and are cut into many slices. I forgive this because there are so many items to order from and they are good about taking back unacceptable items which I have only down once with the raw burger. Service is usually okay and sometimes really good."
Weston P.,"Sanger, CA",406,192,103,4.0,2/25/2014,I like Cheesecake Factory for the Asian Lettuce Wrap Tacos.  They have a ton of flavor and are very low calorie coming in at 65 calories per taco. As expected all of the ingredients were very fresh. I'm very picky about my lettuce and it was very fresh. Service was excellent I had Lauren Z. as my waitress she deserves 5 stars. It's very difficult to find good service and she did a great job.
Christina S.,"Wayne, IL",0,18,1,5.0,9/20/2015,The food here is always outstanding but it's the service that makes us come back time and time agin. Ask for Shannon for the ultimate Cheesecake experience. This server really knows the menu and makes wonderful recommendations. His tip on the lemon-raspberry cheesecake was brilliant. Having Shannon as our server was a religious experience and quite possibly changed our lives. His level of service exceeds what you would receive at Tru or Spiaggia.
Mitanette C.,"Chicago, IL",4,20,18,5.0,10/15/2014,Excellent Customer Service and great food! I am leaving a very satisfied customer. Kudos to the manager Kenny for handling a minor situation in a very professional manor.  Nicolette was my waitress and she was awesome. I would recommend!
Hanna G.,"Rockford, IL",9,9,15,3.0,8/21/2014,"Waiter was not very attentive, granted the restaurant was dead. But still, you'd think he'd have more time to check  in with us? Good is always good, I usually get the avocado egg rolls for an app, but today a friend and I got the artichoke crab dip, and it was great too. I wasn't toooooo pleased with the chipotle chicken pasta that I was reccommended, I should have stuck to my guns and got the Cajun jumbalya pasta- that stuff is the best! As for cheese cake, they have 3000000 selections (okay not that many, but still a lot) and my fave by far is the while chocolate macadamia! It's not too overwhelmingly sweet and over all is great. If I were rating on food tonight, I'll give it 3 stars, because of my dinner choice, but in previous visits, a 4 or 5 has usually happened. I'll update when I come back next."
Doug P.,"Algonquin, IL",24,54,102,5.0,8/1/2015,Had the rib eye steak. Rare.  12oz.  It was  priced better than. Outback. And cook to perfection   Outback should send thief chefs. Here to learn a few things.  Desert was raspberry truffle  cheese cake..
Sam M.,"Palatine, IL",4,104,77,4.0,4/15/2016,Who would have thought the appetizer of avocado fries would be so good! We have to stuff mushrooms as well and they were average at best. Overall the food was pretty good. We had the pasta and pizza and I would probably write it up 4 out of 5. Now as far as the service goes over all the service was very good. However the waiter took about 30 minutes to bring us our bread. We kind of had to point out to him to let him know we need it serviced. But as soon as we didn't point it out he did whatever he could to make us happy. Will definitely give them another shot
Jason M.,"Rosemont, IL",53,16,,4.0,9/14/2015,The go to place for any date! LONG WAITS!!! Beware!! But great food. Always got and fresh. Nice wait staff and nice decor. Would recommend highly
Joanna A.,"Bartlett, IL",19,71,9,3.0,11/22/2013,"Positives: 1) $5 appetizer happy hour 4-6 pm weekdays . You must dine in bar area 2) polite server 3) good made to order guacamole, sweet corn cakes, and mac and cheese ball appetizer. Tropical Breeze tea also good Negatives: Was traveling with a person in a wheelchair. The restaurant had no one waiting ahead of us, yet the host stood there looking at me behind that damn wood host stand they have instead of being a gentleman and helping with the door.  On my previous review I wrote about this. I was contacted by a manager who  told me, they asked host staff to be more aware and they will open doors for strollers, wheelchairs etc.. Well the host that day missed the memo. We asked to be seated near the bar area (it was empty) so we could enjoy the happy hour prices, he said he would seat us in the restaurant and we would get it. The server disagreed but asked the manager to honor the request, which he did.  Bathroom needs attention. It was slow and the restroom was filthy."
Roseanne S.,"Villa Park, IL",97,325,75,4.0,2/8/2012,"Cheesecake factory: you are a diet's worst nightmare. Not that I'm on any kind of diet, but I'm just saying. HUGE FREAKING PORTIONS. I've come here for dinner a couple times, and each time I've had to take food home. I love when they ask if I've saved room for dessert. No, sorry. I don't have a five gallon stomach to hold in all the food you are putting in front of me. This review sounds bad, but it's not. I just have to note the portions first. Aside from the amount of food you get, the food itself is actually pretty good. My boyfriend and I came here and we wisely split our dinner. We ordered an herb chicken breast with mashed potatoes. The plate was so big and there was a lot of food, but we shared and it was enough for both of us. This is the way to go. You save money, and you can finish what is in front of you without taking home food you're never going to touch. Then we had cheesecake. Excuse the acronym, but OMFG. I had the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake (possibly called the Reeces cheesecake) and I totally had a foodgasm. It made me so blissfully happy. I've also had breakfast here and it's really good.The potatoes are nicely done and you get huge pieces of toast (of course) but they use dark wheat toast with grains and everything. This place is a wee bit pricey, but that's because of the portions. Like I said, share with someone, and you'll be a happy camper."
J H.,"Aurora, IL",3,52,75,1.0,7/4/2015,"Bar area is available on first-come basis so chose that over waiting for a table. We saw an empty table and waited for someone to clean it off. Finally, I flagged someone down - turns out it was the waiter. He did clean it off and about 5 min later - the busser wandered into the area.  Server was nice but clearly overwhelmed a he tried to serve 10 tables. This resulted in LONG waits for drinks. And, since we were in the bar area we could see our drinks but we couldn't get our drinks - just got to watch the ice melt as the drinks got watered down. Food was ""ok"" - it wasn't anything I'd run back for. We ordered the lettuce wraps and, frankly, I have had better. Seemed like we had way more wrap ( lettuce) than filling to put in wrap. And once finished, we had the appetizer plate on the table for the entire meal because the busser was not interested in bussing tables and, apparently, the food runners don't take empty plates away.  I ordered a blue cheese flatbread as meal. Topping was ok but flatbread was burnt. Daughter had the kids Mac and cheese - it was kind of dry - not creamy like Mac and cheese should be. Husband had a sandwich which was ok. I think our server tried his best but he had way too many tables so he could not effectively provide great customer service. The busser really didn't proactively look for things to do - he had to be specifically asked to take care of stuff. Other staff members would walk by but didn't help out. In the end, I think there was a lack of teamwork or cohesion in the staff - resulting in a less than satisfactory experience. I did let management know of the situation and they said they would act on it. I hope this is true but, honestly, I won't be back to find out."
Tria M.,"Arlington Heights, IL",1,45,4,2.0,6/28/2015,"Good service, seated quickly on a Saturday night, mediocre food. Expensive for the quality (although quantity is more than ample). Another 'chaining' down of the American palate, and therefore almost always packed. Dulce cheesecake was okay, nothing special, tasted mass-produced. Popular with young couples and families with small children who would like a 'special night' out. Cuisine more akin to cruise line food, lots of selection, limited taste."
Christina S.,"Mt Prospect, IL",31,70,14,4.0,3/19/2015,Food was delicious had this burrito it was huge and the beans and rice nice and fresh the waitress was super nice and my sister had this lettuce wrap that was delicious also. We had drinks they were also delicious the cheesecake was so huge we decided to split one we tried the lemon meringue cheesecake it was delicious
Lindsay B.,"Elgin, IL",86,508,23,4.0,4/1/2015,"My friend and I had a very pleasant experience at The Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday afternoon. We arrived and there was no wait, but the restaurant was very busy and bustling despite the fact that we were past the lunch rush and it was a Tuesday. Our waitress was very friendly and very attentive. I love when my drink is always refilled and she did not disappoint. My friend at one of the lunch specials (sandwich, salad, and soup) which was so much food, and I went with the Avocado Eggrolls that so many people recommended. They were delicious, but a little heavy on the cilantro for my taste (but I'm not a huge cilantro fan). Then we each had a slice of cheesecake- she had some sort of chocolate madness that I would not have been able to eat (wow- so much chocolate), and I tried a new one for me- Key Lime Cheesecake. It was the perfect cheesecake texture and taste- and I loved every bite! I had several eggrolls and half a slice of cheesecake to take home as their portions are abnormally large. I thought the service was good, the restaurant/bathroom clean, and the price right for the amount of food I got. I would definitely come back to this location in the future!"
Paula W.,"Chicago, IL",2,38,4,3.0,6/10/2014,"Visited this location for date night with husband. It was crowded but we only waited about 5 minutes, the table we got was HORRIBLE. It was near the area where the wait staff pulls up the checks, waiters were talking to each other and leaning over the divider about 2 feet from where we were eating it was a 2 person table. Our waiter David C came gave us soup of the day told us about fresh fish and took our drink orders. The waiter was average he bought drinks, bread, food, checked on us once and bought the check, you know typical waiter stuff nothing out of the ordinary.  Our food was ok it was average I had the chicken chipotle pasta and hubby had the Jamaican jerk chicken and shrimp.  I would stop by if in the area and all the other mall restaurants were full but I wouldn't make a special trip to go here, there are much better restaurants in the city."
D J.,"Arlington Heights, IL",1,95,,3.0,7/18/2015,"Been here a lot.  Twice, the wait was 45 min.  Burgers and cake are good. So is service.  Always packed, loud, lighting's too dark."
