Jack H.,"Mount Prospect, IL",15,10,,3.0,1/2/2017,We ate lunch at the CCF and the food was good. The restaurant was very crowded and loud. Having a conversation was difficult. We were now allowed to use our coupons for free cheesecake. The manager said I was missing the email with barcode. Even thou the printout I showed her said we were entitled to it. After 10 minutes we just gave up. Never knew two pieces of cheesecake was more valuable then the honest words spoken from two old retired people visiting from Florida.
A G.,"Oswego, IL",3,26,5,3.0,2/23/2016,"I came here on a Sunday. I ordered the Pork Chilaquiles and they were definitely not what I expected. Instead of getting the traditional Chilaquiles made up of tortilla chips, tomato salsa, sour cream, meat and tons of cheese; I got a pile of scrambled eggs mixed in with shredded pork, gristle, 5 tortilla chips on top, sour cream and a bit of guac.  It wasn't very good but it wasn't bad enough for me to send it back to the kitchen I guess...  The server was very nice and attentive."
Sarah V.,"Chicago, IL",430,98,202,3.0,3/11/2014,"I truly wonder how their hiring process works.  How is the service consistently poor?   I would like some bread at my table within ten minutes of being seated.  I'm making prolonged eye contact hoping that you realize I am missing a plate and silverware, not because I find your eye make up intriguing. You have one soup of the day, please know what that that is when you start your shift.  Perhaps I'm just holding too high of a standard but it gets frustrating. As far as the menu goes, there are too many options for every category except soup. The chicken tortilla soup is amazing but they have it once a week, the fried mac n' cheese is pretty good, so are the pastas and even the sandwiches. Nothing is really out of this world good, but it's a nice place. The cheesecake is delicious and they have a flavor for everyone.  If you have people visiting from out of town its a good option in the suburbs.  Otherwise, head to a place in the city that has both a good atmosphere and non-generic food."
Daniel P.,"Mooresville, NC",25,256,326,3.0,8/3/2015,"I have never been so disappointed in my life! I see a sign 'Cheesecake Factory' and walk in expecting to see Betty Grable-esque ladies showing a little leg and what I get instead is a pleasant dining experience... somebody fetch me a fainting couch, please. started with a fair margarita while my sister-in-law opted for an odd but not unappealingly cucumbery cucumber lemonade thing. nice basket o' bread though. can't hardly find good bread in Iowa. Sandra was quite pleased with her chicky-avacado salad while I struggled with the fish tacos. The main difficulty was ordering since I really wanted two each fried and grilled but had to get a complete set. The waiter seemed as puzzled as I about this and apologized for the inconvenience. (it seems the corporate shills' ordering system is not capable of through-putting fish-bits in quantities less than four) Anyway, the grilled fish tacos were absolutely delicious, one lime halved to spritz them. hearty thick black beans and crazy green rice (cilantro lime?) sets up nicely for flavor/texture contrast. finished with delightful regular cheesecake, while sandra had the lemoncello-layer cake thing. ladies at the next table were trying to gawk politely at the immensity of it all but we kinda noticed the saucer-eyed looks of desire. So I entertained them with my Uncle Donald's headstone adventure while waiting for our server to comeback with a big box o' black breads for me to take back home (they almost made it too)"
Rocky B.,"San Diego, CA",86,194,762,4.0,2/21/2014,The food here is amazing but the waiting for it can suck. But I still am a fan of cheesecake in general. Here are a couple if my favorites. Mainly a fan of the pasta and seafood section and the avocado eggrolls are killer appertizers.

Erica L.,"Kissimmee, FL",86,1,,5.0,1/3/2017,We went to this location for the first time today to celebrate my birthday. Our server was Shannon. He was great. He was very attentive and even made my son a Shirley Temple. We didn't share with him we were celebrating my birthday but he must have over heard and brought out a complementary ice cream scoop with a candle and all. The food was good and the cheesecake was amazing. We will definitely be heading back to this location in the future.
Ram E.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,1.0,7/4/2017,"Horrible staff! Horrible service. They did not care to serve me as a customer. This location was not willing to serve items on the menu when the front guy said we could order it. The waitress wasn't even accommodating. I bet if I was a different person they would have made certain rationales to us getting what is on their menu. Staff not courteous, friendly, and showed no hospitality. It is amazing how these locations can do what they want and people continue to feed their execs pockets. I was from 900 miles away and had one of the worst experience. The staff needs ongoing training to facilitate such situations."
Leila A.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,7,,1.0,6/30/2017,The food here is really good. I just can't stand the lady by the cheese cakes . Her name is Claudia and she is extremely rude and unprofessional. I've never experienced such horrible customer service and a rude employee. She was rushing me and yelling back at me when she couldn't understand . I called back to speak to a manager and he says well that's not how she usually is. I don't care if that's how he is or isn't . She was rude to me and I will not take that kind of attitude.
Robert L.,"Ingleside, IL",2,175,7,3.0,11/21/2016,"The place looks really nice, but the food is just ""Ok"", I almost feel like they try to offer too many types of food and don't concentrate on making any of them unique. The Cheesecake is, obviously, the exception and is very good."
Susan T.,"Upland, IN",0,4,,5.0,12/16/2016,"We Love the Cheesecake Factory! Portions are huge, so my husband and I usually split. We love that brown bread that accompanies the meal. The new Nutella cheesecake is amazing!!! I eat here for lunch sometimes. There are some great lunch deals. The light menu is nice for late night trips. The Asian lettuce wraps are a must."
David S.,"Lockport, IL",41,11,5,5.0,12/14/2016,Today I take a moment to write this review has a tank you to the restaurant for the great service provided last night and not only that also the courtesy and the delicious meal provided. I'll recommend this restaurant in the future to friends and family.
Jon D.,"Hurlburt Field, FL",4,30,20,5.0,9/4/2015,"Food - 10/10 Service - (started at) 5/10 until shift change then our waiter Shannon, my man! Made it a 10/10 awesome job bud!! Cleanliness - 10/10 Only complaint was the amount of uncontrolled children. Not the fault of the establishment! All on the parents"
Joshua N.,"Poplar Grove, IL",45,101,79,2.0,3/14/2016,I've never really like this place but my wife loves it. Well... After our last visit even she left wondering if she'd go back. There was a wait to get a table so we sat at the bar(our first mistake) I order a Bloody Mary and it was awful. Our bartender was as unfriendly of a person that I've ever met. She probably said 10 words to us the entire time we were there. We both ordered things we had never tried (our 2nd mistake) both of our meals were not good at all. We got to leave because we paid with cash and left it on the bar. Otherwise who knows when the bartender would have gotten back to us. I don't plan to ever return here again.
Kim D.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",3,2,,1.0,11/14/2016,I order the same dish every time I come here. The lemon herb roasted chicken. It's always fantastic. I order my favorite dish yesterday. My potatoes and carrots was cold. The chicken was over cooked and it was garlic herb chicken not lemon roasted chicken. I was very disappointed. The server Ryan was great. He's the reason I try this place again.
Kayla R.,"Crystal Lake, IL",4,83,,4.0,9/10/2016,"I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory ever, so my sister decided on this place for her birthday dinner. First impression: it smells like garlic and fancy cheese. Not good for people with sensitive noses. The wait for our food was about half an hour, but that's pretty average considering this is a nicer restaurant. Our server was absolutely outstanding. Didn't catch her name, but she answered all our questions, smiled almost nonstop, and helped us decide on dessert. I ordered a Cuban sandwich (also a first for me) and it was really good! The only negative thing I have to say about that though is the bread was literally painful to bite into because it was toasted, thick, and super crunchy. I wouldn't hesitate to order the Cuban again if the bread was softer. And omg those fries!!! Golden, delicious, fresh, and perfect with the ketchup they provided. I ordered the Black Out cake for dessert and took it home. Now that I've dug into it as a midnight snack, omg... Chocolate lover's heaven. It does contain nuts on the outer part though so beware if you have a nut allergy. The entire visit for 4 people: 4 waters, 1 Coke, 1 lemonade, 4 entrees, and 4 slices of cheesecake/regular cake = $100+ tab. Overall, I was really impressed. Top notch service, absolutely tasty food, incredible dessert selection, beautiful interior design... I'm sold."
Jennifer M.,"Schaumburg, IL",140,349,289,4.0,12/27/2014,"Going out to dinner on Christmas Eve is my family's tradition. After three consecutive years of bad experiences at Claim Jumper on Rt 59, we can't seem to settle on one place. We've been on the lookout but   we continue to change locations year after year. That's not necessarily a bad thing because we get to try new or less frequented restaurants as a family, annually. The kids are still young (one of them still believes in Santa) so choosing a restaurant that accomodates kids' taste in food without compromising the quality of service and ambiance that fits my sister and her husband's budget can be challenging. Fortunately, the perimeter that covers our area for good eats is the Northwest Suburbs. It's a huge territory with a cornicopia of restaurants. It continues to develop and grow to rival with Chicago's best. When we finally settled on The Cheesecake Factory, I was relieved and actually happy with the choice we made. My usual complaint that the menu has too much variety of dishes, accomodated all eight of us to find something satisfying: Angel hair pasta plates, red meat with a side, a turkey burger with a side,  seafood with a side and 2 baskets of warm loaves of white and brown bread served with room temperature butter. Some of us started with an adult beverage, I had a Coke straight up with ice. The kids had iced water.  After finishing our entrees, no one says they don't have room for dessert to share. I mean, the name of this restaurant is a dessert. Who disagrees with me that it would make sense to eat at a place famous for their dessert and skip ordering one? The way they have the cheesecakes displayed, just off to the side of the hostess' stand and set up like a retail shop with its own staff and cashiers, it's easy to just stop in, place an order for a slice and go! By the way, thank you for listening to my first review. Of course I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake and I do have something to say:  upgrading the 3 measely strawberries to 3 ginormous ones was a fabulous idea. I'm glad I, I mean you, thought about it first!"
Abbio A.,"Chicago, IL",17,23,41,1.0,12/7/2015,"My family and I came in one afternoon as a party of 6. It was the early afternoon so the restaurant was relatively empty. The host took us to a table all the way in the back. My sisters and I just looked at each other bc we all thought it was weird that he passed so many empty tables to sit us all the way at the last table in the rear of the restaurant.  A waitress came and greeted us, and brought a round of waters back. 10mins go by and she hasn't returned yet. We see her coming back our way and we get her attention, we ask if we can order our appetizers now and she says ""I'm not your waiter"" we say ............""ok well can you get the person who'll be our waiter??? We've been waiting for like 15mins and no one has came to our table."" She says it was a change in shifts so she'll go get our new waiter. 15mins later our new waitress is at our table.  Now we're just ready to eat so we order our entrées. My sister has her son with us so she asks if his food can be brought out as soon as it's done. I order a falafel salad. She orders a fried chicken sandwich and everyone else has some sort of pasta. My nephew's food arrives 20mins later along with his mothers food. 10mins later a pasta plate comes out. 15mins later my mom & little sisters dish comes out. Everyone has their food except Me and all I had was a salad.  The waitress asks ""oh did your salad come out?"" ....... Well of course it didn't I don't have it, I do t even have a plate in front of me. It's now been about 50mins and she finally comes back with my salad, which I'm sure was just sitting back there waiting to get picked up. I took one bite of the falafel and it was not even crispy. I asked for it to be sent back and for management.  The manger comes to our table and is actually the same person who sat us all the way in the back and gives me attitude. I told him about the long wait and how we've been there for like 2hrs and everyone's food coming out one at a time and me receiving a salad an hour later that should've  taken no time to come out. He says ""well I took it off the bill so you don't have to pay for it-it's off the bill"""
Liz B.,"Palatine, IL",28,41,103,5.0,5/3/2016,"High quality all around. It's always busy and they don't take reservations, which is a good sign but a downside for the hungry. The menu is huge and there is something for everyone. Everything here is tasty. I got the steak Diane, my friend got a burger, and my spouse got some type of garlic bread with ricotta, pesto, and basil on top. The Thai lettuce wraps and phenomenal. The free bread is crusty and warm. Best of all, the cheesecake! It's pricey for everyone to get their own, but each slice is big and filling. I've never had a bad one there. The servers tend to be on the attentive side. The biggest downsides are the slowness of seating during peak hours and the price. The food is always delicious. Love this place!"
Jeannette B.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/1/2016,"I ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad with Chicken. The chicken lacked flavor, was fatty, gristle, and there were barely any pieces. When I brought it up to my waiter (Amy W), she apologized but pretty much laughed it off and then commented, with a rude attitude, ""next time tell me so I can get you a better piece of chicken"". I would've appreciated it if she actually had a caring attitude, exhibited a concern, or had taken the price of the chicken off the bill. She didn't care, which makes the company look bad when it comes to customer service. I wasn't looking for anything free or complementary. Her attitude is what upset me and made me write this review. ""Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake, you know I love to go there"" -Drake"
Sisi M.,"Bothell, WA",59,47,60,4.0,3/20/2016,I love the food here and The atmosphere is wonderful and they gave us a 30 minute wait time but got us in 20. Like a BOSS!
