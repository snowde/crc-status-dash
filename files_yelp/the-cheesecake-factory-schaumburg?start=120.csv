Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392,3.0,11/21/2014,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite a long time.  I'm not particularly sure why, though I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake (unless it's ALL chocolate) but I realize cheesecake is only one part of their menu, which as we all know, is rather extensive.  I don't DISLIKE it, but after I stopped eating meat 6 and a half years ago, I was unable to eat what I usually would order which was the delicious ""crusted chicken romano"" or something like that. I found myself out in Schaumburg for some reason last weekend and when lunchtime approached, somehow this was the selected venue.  I must have been in an especially agreeable mood.  While it appeared to be freakishly crowded in there, the wait for two was only 10 minutes, but I think we waited 15 or 20, still no big deal.     I think the last time I was at one of these places (the one in Oak Brook maybe?) I ordered one of those flatbreads and it was good, but I don't find flatbreads to be too terribly exciting.  This time, I went for the veggie burger.  I've had many a veggie burger in my day, some good, some bad, some downright awful.  It's always a gamble for me.  This one, as described in the menu, sounded rather intriguing.  This is what it said:  A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Couscous, Mushrooms, Black Beans & Onion. Served on a Toasted Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Pickles & Mayo. Served with a Green Salad.  I ordered it without mayo (because I think it's disgusting) and got it with fontina cheese.   And whatever that brown bread is they serve, it's delicious, I love it, and I eat too much of it.  But if there's any treat in eating there, it's that.   Our waiter kept apologizing to us for the wait.  It didn't feel like things were taking a long time, but I think we were there for about two hours.  I didn't care, but I asked for ketchup to douse my burger in and never got it so I ended up consuming it without.  It was still delicious, but would've been even better with ketchup. We got cheesecake to go (so full).  Hershey's chocolate for me, pumpkin for the other one.   I'm slightly more frugal now, so I always wince a little when the check comes because it's always more than I think it should be - and we didn't order appetizers or drinks.   The only somewhat annoying thing that happened was that there were sooooooooooo many screaming babies and children there at the same time we were.  So I was hearing surround sound of crying pretty much the entire time.  The kid at the table behind us kept throwing things which of course ended up right at our table.  Was it bitchy of me to not pick anything up for the parents?  Well, I didn't.  It wouldn't have been sanitary."
Dominique J.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,1,2.0,6/22/2016,"The tacos was terrible. I got the fish tacos and it was not seasoned, my food was cold, and there was more dressings on the taco than actual meat. My friend got the Baja chicken tacos, again no flavor. Hers was at least warm. I don't think I will visit there again"
Knuckles P.,"McHenry, IL",3,34,35,4.0,9/17/2016,"It was ok, heard so much about this place through the years finally decided to try it. The food was good & they gave you a lot of it. I had a caramel cheesecake that was great. I was happy there was an entrance from parking lot, that I didn't have to go thru mall."
Salman A.,"Bartlett, IL",0,9,,1.0,5/4/2017,"Worst service ever at a Cheesecake Factory and we go at other locations frequently. Food came out and one of the pasta dishes was too salty, asked the server and was told that's how the pasta is even though only one pasta dish was salty. Wanted to order another dish and she said they are all salty. The water would need to be changed that would take too long!"
Michal S.,"Wood Dale, IL",2,29,1,1.0,12/18/2015,"So me and my gf went couple days ago for lunch while we were at the mall, everything was ok since we didn't have to wait but then from the point from when we sat down it all went down hill. First while we were seated the table wasn't cleaned and the spoons and fork were dirty and we were suppose to eat with those? Then our waiter finally came by and I told him can he exchange it and he's like sure no problem. When he came back we ordered Pepsi or Cola what ever they had but without ice. The waiter comes back gives our drinks and while me and my gf took a sip I was like this ain't no cola but a mix of cola and MINERAL water and I noticed the different light color of the drink. It's prolly because we asked with no ice so that meant that would give the cola extra couple oz so they added water instead."
Monica K.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,16,,1.0,3/22/2017,"I have gone to this restaurant for years and this time I realized that the food here is really not that good. I ordered the Cobb salad and the bacon was burnt and the lettuce and toppings did not seem that fresh. My husband ordered the BBQ chicken salad. I tried an onion ring off the top and it tasted like it was fried in old oil because it tasted strangely stale. My daughter got the spaghetti and meatballs and I did not try hers but the sauce looked like canned tomato sauce. For the price, this place is just not worth it."
Tania B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,5.0,3/3/2016,"We came here around 3pm on a Thursday for late lunch and it's quite empty (lucky us!). Since this is located in the mall, it can get really busy. We ordered the lunch portions (available until 5pm) and the serving is still huge!  I'd recommend ordering these so there's more room for dessert. :)  Try their chocolate mousse aside from your usual cheesecake. Service was great."
Nelson M.,"Champaign, IL",246,817,1524,4.0,1/17/2014,"Restaurant Review Classic american food with average price. The food at Cheesecake factory is not going to rock your world, but they have such a wide selection that you can find a dish for pretty much anyone. This makes for a great location when you are going out with a bunch of friends to eat. The portions are ample in size and you never leave feeling hungry. The cheesecake is nice, I can't say that it is better than Eli Cheesecake, but they have quite a large selection and the perfect way to end your meal. Servers are usually good and attentive and I have never had any issues at this location. Pro- large american food menu, good customer service, cheesecake! Con- although the cheesecake is great, for the slice of 2 you can buy an entire cheesecake at Eli cheesecake world....

Jim N.,"Gwinn, MI",0,28,1,3.0,3/5/2017,"The service was adequate and the food overpriced. Our server was not friendly and cool, not interested in making any suggestions or providing any useful information regarding menu items.  I wouldn't return."
Nifer K.,"Marengo, IL",1,26,3,2.0,3/25/2016,"Been there many times before.  Always had a good experience this time we went to celebrate my son's 9th Birthday.  After a wait to get a table we ordered drinks which to much longer then normal. We did order nachos for an appetizer and it was good. But for some reason we had almost 30 minutes between the nachos and our meal. The waitress never refilled drinks or checked on us.  We finished our meal and decided to just get our cake to go. And then when we get home, that is what the carrot cake looked like. We will not be visiting the Cheese Cake Factory again. 5 of us and our total was $200.00 I guess I would expect a little better for that kind of money."
Tina E.,"North Aurora, IL",13,222,223,5.0,7/16/2016,Marisol at the bakery counter is the best. She never misses a thing and my order is perfect everytime!!
Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,3.0,11/28/2013,"I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in several years but on a recent trip I finally went to one. My favorite has always been the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta so I just had to order it. I was so looking forward to it, it's one of my absolute favorite pasta dishes. Sadly, either they have changed the recipe at all locations or perhaps this location cooks it differently. The portion was smaller than I remember it and the cajun spices had more of a heat flavor than cajun flavor. I'd be perfectly happy with Tony Cachere's spice mix than what they use now. The service was good but very slow. Towards the end we just wanted to get out and pay but had to wait 10 minutes to get a container for the leftovers. It wasn't bad but I have had much more enjoyable experiences at other restaurants and other Cheesecake Factory locations than I had at this one."
Tamara J.,"Evanston, IL",77,116,397,3.0,8/23/2015,"Usually I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Skokie, but stopped by the Schaumburg restaurant today since I was in the area. There was a lot of energy and it was extra crowded. Unfortunately, they must have been short on staff and the bathroom was super unkept. I think it always reflects poorly on any restaurant when the bathroom is a mess! I was just stopping in to pickup cheesecake to go...and of course, it was fabulous as always. I will say that it seems that the pieces are smaller these days, but more expensive! I guess that's how it goes...just glad the quality is still good."
Kristine R.,"Chicago, IL",500,86,74,4.0,12/5/2014,"This location is located at Woodfied Mall. I prefer to not go here just because this mall is always so packed with people but we went here about 2 hours before they closed one night and it was pretty dead. It was also a Thursday night, so I'm sure that made a difference. If you want to go to a Cheesecake Factory though and not want to pay for parking like the one in Streeterville, this is definitely the place to go!  I always get the fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli and portobello mushrooms and I'm always satisfied about halfway through the entree because it's such a huge portion. Their calamari is amazing. My husband orders something different everytime we go here from burgers to steak and he is always satisfied by the end of the meal. Their cheesecake here, just like any other Cheesecake Factory is to die for!"
Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4343,2412,14756,2.0,10/28/2012,"Don't go for lunch! We waited 35 minutes for our food, grrrr. Service is so incredibly slow, it's impossible to get in and out during a lunch hour on business days. Although I like the addition of the Skinny menu, I don't like that they have raised prices plus they got rid of the Portabella Burger which was my favorite thing on the menu. The food is just meh, overpriced and honestly for the same price (or less!) you can have amazing food at Lincoln Whiskey Kitchen. The servers are just in a routine and not very happy to be there nor do they a passion for the food at Cheesecake Factory. Honestly, I won't be going back to The Cheesecake Factory...it just is no longer worth the trip for medicore food at high prices and slow, subpar service."
A G.,"Chicago, IL",3,46,,2.0,5/7/2016,"Came in here on Thursday and we had John as our waiter.  Every time I come to Cheesecake factory I've had great service.  This is the first time that I experienced bad service.  He did not refill our waters once.  When we were looking for him he would be chatting away at another table.  Our food took FOREVER to come out.  My salmon and mashed potatoes were definitely sitting under the lamp, as well as my fiancé's food. Then 5 minutes later he brought my stepdads food which looked like it just got done cooking, which also was not right since we had to wait for his food so we could start eating. Not sure if I will be returning to this location."
Candi P.,"Elgin, IL",77,102,69,3.0,11/23/2014,"Had lunch on a Sunday afternoon about 2:30 and or quoted wait time for a 4-top was 10 min. We were seated in less than 5, which was nice. I've been here twice now but can't say that the food or service is anything I'd return often for, but the selection is vast and I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I just haven't found my dish yet.  I tried the avocado eggroll appetizer after seeing it pop up in many reviews. It tasted like guacamole stuffed inside a thick eggroll wrapper, not bad but not great. Tip: go easy with the dipping sauce! It is overwhelmingly sweet. I ordered the chicken stuffed tortillas, an enchilada type dish made with melted cheese and tomatillo sauce over four corn tortillas stuffed with (not very)spicy chicken. Also just mediocre. The pasta dishes seem to be consistently good. My friend ordered miso salmon which is served over rice. The salmon was good but the bed of rice it was served over was horribly undercooked. It says it comes with snow peas but it looked like the few snow peas that came with the dish was just for garnish.  I hope to update this review after I've tried more of their desserts, though! Can't really judge the Cheesecake Factory on just their entrees when I really haven't had a lot of their cheesecakes! To be continued..."
Nick M.,"Schaumburg, IL",135,117,497,3.0,7/20/2014,"Their food, from what I've had, is delicious.   Their carbonara pasta with chicken is awesome.  They give a very generous portion too.  The other item I've ordered is the shrimp sandwich.  It was good but I kept wondering where the shrimp was.  For a shrimp sandwich it lacked its main ingediant and left a lot to desire and their prices are not cheap! I have never had bad service here.  I have come for lunch around 12 and dinner around 5pm.  This was during the week so the mall wasn't as crowded. Their cheesecake is a main standout.  Many different flavors for all tastebuds.  I'll be back again, but i'll stick to the weekdays as it seems to be crowded on the weekends.   One thing that I like and I don't depending on how hungry I am is that their menu is almost 20 pages.  It is like reading a book so if you haven't been here before try looking at their menu online so your table doesn't spend 20 minutes trying to pick their meal."
Liz G.,"Hinsdale, IL",35,48,73,5.0,8/13/2015,"This location is great! The service and food was delicious! I ordered off of the skinnylicious menu because their normal menu has HUGE portions. I tried the grilled steak medallions for the first time, and I was phenomenal. I will be ordering that, again! I finished dinner with some hot mint tea and it was delightful"
Melissa H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",151,65,119,3.0,7/11/2015,"Went here on the 3rd of July (Friday) at 6 PM expecting a LONG wait and to our surprise we were seated right away......AWESOME! We sat in a booth with a great view of Woodfield Mall.  My husband was sad to find out from our server they no longer serve the wasabi crusted tuna. My husband loved that entree and was sad to see it go. Bring it back please?!  Instead he opted for the cod tacos served with rice and beans. He thought it was good, but not anything he would go rushing back here for. My standard order that I always get here the Chicken and Biscuits had a strong onion flavor to it. I don't mind onions, but it was a tad bit too much.  For dessert we ordered the banana cream cheesecake served with fresh banana slices and whipped cream. DELICIOUS!!!  Next time we're in the mood for Cheesecake Factory we're going to stick to the location closer to home in Lincolnshire."
