Sarah H.,"Pingree Grove, IL",66,363,27,3.0,2/11/2013,"I've dined here a few times, and I've yet to really be blown away. While the service has been decent, and the food has been decent -- I never leave there aching to go back. The cheesecake IS pretty darn good, but $7-$8 for one slice isn't something I'm going to do often. And it'd probably be the only reason for me to actually choose Cheesecake Factory over another eating establishment. This last visit, I was there with a friend and we ordered from their Sunday brunch menu (we were there at 11am). I got the Bruleed French Toast which was just ..... weird. I didn't care for it at all and left most of it on my plate. Thank goodness I ordered bacon ($3 additional) with it, or I would have been starving. It was just not for my palate. The inside of the french toast was still ""wet"" and ""gooey"", where it made me think it wasn't cooked all the way thru. I don't think that was the case -- it's just how they make it. I'll stick with regular good old fashioned french toast --- if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!! Sometimes I think places go too far with trying to put their own spin or ""froo-frooing"" something up when they really don't have to. It also took a long time for our meals to come up. For french toast (and my friend had eggs, pancakes, bacon, hashbrowns and toast) and other breakfast items, we did sit there, but since I was also visiting with my friend, it wasn't a HUGE deal. However, they DID recognize this, and apologized. We had a manager stop by the table to also apologize and offered us comp dessert. YES, please!!!! (Like I said, the cheesecake is probably the only reason to really go as I've yet to find a dish that I just MUST go there for) It was nice that they recognized their fault, and even though we didn't complain, they stepped up and nipped it right away. Still, after tip, I still forked over $21 for french toast I didn't eat, a glass of lemonade and a complimentary slice of cheesecake."
Diane W.,"Chicago, IL",0,51,,1.0,12/28/2016,"I stopped by there not too long ago and bought a slice of cheesecake from the front and the person getting it for me / cashier pulled it from the back frig behind the register instead of from the showcase like the rest of the people. whats up with that?? what was her problem? Lousy. they might need a security camera to cover that area  to catch that kind of poor treatment again and double check the type of people they have hired there, especially behind the cheesecake showcase. they get 1 star for this experience...."
Cathy A.,"Chicago, IL",0,20,6,1.0,1/8/2016,"My husband,  myself,  and a few friends decided to go here for dinner on a Saturday night.  I understand that weekends are busy but their wait times are ridiculous.  When we walked in,  I waited in line just to have my name put in on the waiting list.  When I walked up to the hostess,  she did not greet me so I had to say hello to her first. I informed her we were a party of five and she tapped the guy behind her and repeated what I said.  Then she turns back to me and with an attitude says that the wait is two and a half hours.  I asked her if they over estimate like other restaurants sometimes do.  She looked at me like I was stupid and didn't respond with actual words.  I told her thank you and that we would find different place.  She simply shrugged and moved on to the next person.   I will never visit this location again if thats the kind of customer service they have."
Christine L.,"Skokie, IL",120,397,820,3.0,9/29/2014,"This place always seems packed, and somehow we end up here during their busier times.  Our 15 to 20 minute estimated wait time turned into 30. The place itself is fairly dimly lit, with your typical Cheesecake Factory decor.  Mirrors make the place seem more spacious, and there are a number of TVs in the bar area.  When it is busy it gets pretty noisy. Our typical appetizer when we go with friends is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (three tamale cakes in one appetizer), which is really good.  This last time I was here I also ordered the Meat Loaf, not what I would typically order at Cheesecake, but I hadn't had it in a while and was craving something comforting.  And what isn't more comforting than meat loaf and mashed potatoes? The meat loaf came on what seemed like a platter, which is consistent with Cheesecake Factory's large portions.  It included a large scoop of mashed potatoes, four slabs of meat loaf, and a corn succotash.  Definitely enough for two meals (unless you are really hungry).  While cheesecake tends to be a little pricey, they do make up with it with their portion sizes. For dessert I ordered the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake which, for someone like me who can't decide what to order most of the time, fits the bill perfectly: ""Layers of moist chocolate cake, chewy brownie, toasted coconut-pecan frosting and creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake"".  With cake, brownie, and cheesecake all in one, I get a little bit of everything. Overall food is decent, service is good, and prices are okay for the portion.  It's a solid Cheesecake Factory Restaurant, which means solid wait times as well."
Erika M.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",217,338,591,3.0,8/30/2014,"Apparently on weekends they do not take reservations. So our party of six had to wait forty-five minutes to be seated. The wait was not that horrible and we were actually seated within half an hour. The service was quick and dinner went well. We did have to ask for more bread and water refills because the waitress did not check on us at all during our entire meal, kind of annoying. Otherwise, no complaints."
Sonya M.,"Glenview, IL",10,98,30,5.0,3/4/2016,"I came here today with my friend for lunch. Domingo was our server and he was super friendly and knowledgeable. We had the fried zucchini which was delicious, spinach and artichoke dip. As well as the 2 lunch specials, Pizzas and a salad. The food came out fast and was delicious, we had great service! We'll be definitely be coming back again!"
Big Cool D.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,,2.0,1/15/2017,"Hour wait to get in.  About 20 min to get water or cocktail.   Screwed up my wifes order AND her dessert.   OK, the Hibachi Steak was pretty good.  For better service go to Old Orchard location.  Cocktails ard $15 each!"
Layda C.,"Chicago, IL",4,92,20,5.0,5/26/2015,"Visited this busy restaurant on a Saturday night - 30min wait at about 730pm, but they also offered almost immediate seating and full menu at the bar. Turned out to be a terrific experience - quick,!attentive server (Andrew) made menu suggestions that were spot on.  We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the steak and sides. Chicken appetizer was fresh, with a nice side sauce - will order both again.  In spite of how busy the restaurant was, we were able to take our time and converse, Andrew did not rush us, just checked in just when we were ready for dessert.  Godiva chocolate cheesecake - ah! Heaven on a plate!"
Stephen W.,"Vandalia, OH",16,52,64,5.0,5/3/2016,Had really good service at this cheesecake Factory location. We were seated quickly on Saturday evening. Our server was really good at her job. She was quick and got everything right. The food was very good.
A H.,"Halifax, Canada",59,189,707,4.0,8/2/2015,"We stopped in here for lunch before we headed to the airport to flight back to Canada. We don't have a Cheesecake Factory back home so I had to stop in before I left. I tried the grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich, it was massive! I really struggled to finish it but I figured I needed a big meal for the flight home. It was really good but it comes like a grilled cheese so the bread was greasy which I didn't care for... I'd rather just toasted bread. Thank god I didn't get fries, I just had a side Caesar which was good as always. I got the vanilla bean cheesecake to go and holy moly it is rich and sweet. It was good to try the first time but can't say I'll get that flavour again, too sweet for me. The service from our waiter was great he was very sweet and attentive! Good job :)."
Jenni F.,"Chicago, IL",32,48,15,4.0,8/13/2014,Oh. My. Goodness. This place is pretty delicious. Went here yesterday for my birthday lunch with my mom. Based on yelp reviews we tried the avocado eggrolls. They were good. They were not quite what I thought they would be based on the reviews. but they were still good enough. A bit mushy. I wish they had something crunchy in them.  I had the chicken and biscuits as my main dish. This was really great. Everything I want in a dish. The mashed potatoes make the dish and they were some of the best I've had.  My mom tried the Mac and cheese burger. It has a deep fried Mac ball on top of it. She gave me a piece of the ball to try. that was amazing. the burger itself seemed a little underwhelming but she did say it was good. Fries were solid too.  Well we had to get desert. I tried the red velvet cheesecake. Oh man. That was the highlight of my meal. Such a good taste and texture. I tend to be a peanut butter girl but this was a pleasant deviation. My mom had the chocolate truffle cake. The piece I tried was also delicious. Overall great meal!  The restaurant itself is huge. The tables are kind of close together. The wait staff was fine. A little expensive but for a special occasion reasonable!
Jay S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",52,207,34,5.0,6/2/2015,I know I have reviewed this location before but it is really nice to have somewhere to go that never really changes much.  This location has the best service of any of the Cheesecake Factory's that I have been too and their staff gets better if that is possible.  This visit we sat at the bar and had appetizers.  Took us awhile to order since we were laughing with the bartender so hard.  Their Reuben Rolls are so good and we cannot wait to have them again.   The wait staff here could open a school of how to provide service for your customers.  It has never been other than perfect here.  Can't wait to get back.
Edward W.,"Chicago, IL",119,684,410,4.0,1/2/2014,Located in the mall it's a great place to dine while on a shopping trip.  Truly the largest menu on the planet!  I personally love the chicken marsala and strawberry lemonade.   Service was very good but I knocked off a star because the kitchen was very slow.  Took forever for our food to come to the table. Otherwise food was great and the location is very convenient while on a shopping trip.
Megan M.,"Arlington Heights, IL",588,153,297,5.0,12/7/2014,"Cheesecake Factory, Friday night at 6pm- we're crazy right? Wrong.  Seated immediately, greeted upon being seated and welcomed by our waiter, George.  He put up with our tables incredible gift of gab, as we thumbed through the dictionary of deliciousness (menu).  The bread and butter they serve (complimentary) hold a very special place in my heart- especially the honey wheat. And the warm and colorful ambiance is the perfect backdrop to great conversation and food. It wasn't my first time here, it probably was close to the 200th time that I've dined here. It was, however, the first time I've ever ordered a glass of wine. The Pino noir was decadent and only $10.50 for a glass. We shared the corn tamale cakes- which never cease to amaze. The sweet and warm coupled with the cool creaminess of the sour cream and avocado.... Infringes upon perfection. I ordered the jerked pepper shrimp dish, which was super rich, very flavorful and the plantains on the side rounded out the dinner, quite nicely. My friend ordered the chicken Bellagio- which was a generous serving of tender chicken over pasta, with Parmesan cheese and arugula salad on top. Fresh and delicious. Seeing as how we stuffed ourselves on the bread, tamale cakes and giant dinner portions, we didn't have room for dessert. So we reached down to our inner fat kids and ordered three slices to go. Pineapple upside down cheesecake.  Taking two phenomenal deserts and scientifically combining them to create an unbelievable treat sensation... How is this the first time I'm trying it?! I didn't share. In fact- I want another.  From beginning to end, the entire meal was spot on. Way to always be a high scoring restaurant, and a favorite. But seriously, if you go- pick up an extra slice of the pineapple upside down cheesecake for me."
Catherine P.,"Merrillville, IN",437,492,2281,4.0,11/3/2011,"I'm happy to announce that I am writing an update for TCF.  I know going in that service is hit or miss and something typically is always messed up on our order, but we KEEP COMING BACK!! It's like our very own form of Woodfield crack. Once you go, you'll know what I'm talking about.... Typically, there is a wait. Anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes. Because it's awesome!! Be patient, people. It'll be worth the wait. We have tried to make reservations for large groups that we have gone with to celebrate birthdays and such, however, they do not accept reservations. Kinda stinks because I think they loose business this way. I know I won't go with a group of 10+ people to celebrate my birthday because I don't want to do that to my friends. Their bar is always packed on a Friday or Saturday night, so there really isn't much to do while you wait besides crowd up their lobby, hold up the walls, and shoot the s$%^. Thankfully, they have some booths to sit while you wait if you are lucky enough to grab a seat.  Don't let the small bar/dining area in the front of the restaurant fool you, there is a TON of seating near the kitchen area and in the back of the restaurant.  I don't really think I have ever had anything here that I didn't like (whether or not it required remaking is another story). They use higher quality ingredients considering it's a ""chain"" restaurant. You get what you pay for @Cheesecake.  Most recently, we went in with a gift card I had to use up. A little middle-of-the-week date night with my guy. He dropped me at the door, so I could run in right away and get us a table (common pratice for us when we come to TCF) and hot dog diggity, there was no wait!! Thank you mid-week-ers eating at home tonight, you allowed us to get a table right away. I actually made THEM wait to seat US because I wanted to wait for my fiance to be seated together. Kinda nice for a change. ;) We were greeted by our server, Beth, with bread and butter. God bless her, she must know us. We each ordered our sodas, mine- dt. coke with a water back and Steve's- sprite. Sadly, the syrup must have been out because he said it tasted awful. He switched it up to a Dr. Pepper. Happy as a clam. We started with a ""small plate""; the chicken croquettes. Didn't know what they were going to be but for $5, I was willing to try them out. They were these little fried 'nuggets' almost, with very nice white meat chicken breast pieces inside along with a very creamy cheese.  Don't quite know what kind of cheese it was but it was good! It was nice to try something new. We'll for sure get them again for an app. They were yummy.  I am so boring. I ordered the Chicken Costoletta. My go-to fave! Three pounded out crispy chicken breasts served with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears served over a bed of creamy lemon-y sauce. Love it!!  My fiance was adventurous this time around and opted for the Southeast Asian Caramel Chicken which is crispy battered chunks of chicken in a spicy Vietnamese sauce with green beans, carrot strips and other veggies. He opted for the brown rice which he mentioned after dinner was so bland. Poor guy, he didn't even think to add butter or salt until after he was done eating. Dork!....but I love him. I also noticed that he was picking out mushrooms and putting them on his bread plate throughout his meal. I recall you ordering it without mushrooms, babe? Yeah, I did but I can just pick them out. He's so easy going. Those mushrooms would not have been sitting in front of me very long, ick!! We are not fans but it didn't bother him that much. Just me, the pile of slimy mushrooms were staring me in the face. Gross!!! I'm such a baby. We skipped dessert because, now I know I'm crazy, we are not fans of cheesecake, just fans of The Cheesecake Factory."
Rob H.,"Glendale Heights, IL",9,86,4,5.0,8/12/2015,"I've never been disappointed at the Cheesecake Factory! I love cheesecake  & I know when I done, I'm going to have a good meal followed up by an excellent slice of cheesecake!  Tonight not only was the food good but the service was amazing! Amela did an awesome job tonight! Good food and very excellent service is a winning combination for a memorable evening!!"
Aj F.,"Chicago, IL",0,65,17,4.0,8/29/2016,"great customer service, we had a great waitress. chicken madeira was a wonderful meal, too full to even order dessert though the cheesecakes all looked wonderful in the case. definitely will visit again."
Shima C.,"Arlington Heights, IL",125,26,86,4.0,1/1/2015,"Love this place!  The gigantic plates of yummy food never disappoint.  Only thing I did not like was when we were told the wait would be 15 minutes initially , and waited 25min , asked the hostess what's up, kept telling us our table was getting cleaned up, asked again after 20 more minutes, told us same thing.  Some gentleman next to us  told us he was in the same situation. They need to make an effort to be more accurate and honest from the gecko por favor."
Kalyn M.,"Chula Vista, CA",45,10,9,5.0,2/20/2015,"After a couple people had told me the only good thing about this place was the cheesecake, I had avoided it for a long time. On a whim last night, I suggested my family and I go here to try it out.  We were almost immediately seated, which was nice considering Woodfield is typically busy, even on week nights. I didn't realize how huge the restaurant was from the outside- holy crap! It's quite dim, which I love, and is fancier than I thought it would be.  I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was fabulous. It's as if he knew exactly how many times to come to the table, the perfect amount of wait time before refilling drinks, etc. The best service I have ever had at a restaurant!  Now onto the food...ugh. Amazing. At first I was a little skeptical due to how huge the menu is and how many different cuisines they offer (Italian, Asian, Mexican, American, etc). I've noticed that when a restaurant has too large of a menu, the food isn't always great. I ordered the avocado egg rolls to start, even though my family thought it was an odd appetizer. We were all surprised at not only how quickly the appetizer came, but how DELICIOUS the egg rolls were. The sauce is to-die-for. The ""black"" bread was great as well and the butter was warm. Seems stupid, but I hate when butter is cold and won't spread on your bread!  I am a veggie burger junkie, and in my opinion, they're very easy to mess up. They're either flavorless and falling apart all over the place or perfect. Let me say, this one was perfect! It did fall apart a bit, but it didn't bother me at all because it was full of flavor. The dipping sauce that comes with it is fantastic too. I got sweet potato fries for the side, which I'm also obsessed with, and they were amazing! Simple, but they complemented the burger very nicely. The proportions are also huge, seems to be a theme here! I think the cheesecake speaks for itself, but my favorites are the Oreo and lemon meringue.  All in all, I plan on going back for my birthday in April. There are so many things I want to try, but the veggie burger was so good that I may just have to stick with that! Highly recommend."
Jen R.,"Hampshire, IL",55,217,306,3.0,9/16/2013,"If I were only rating the cheescake, it would be 5 stars, no question!!! 3 stars for the food (its mediocre & overpriced) 2 stars for the length of the wait 2 stars for the service It's always busy. I've eaten here several times & I'm never overly impressed with the food or service. The pizza is decent. I generally skip the wait, the lack of service, and restaurant experience, and just walk straight to the dessert line, order the most incredible, melt I'm your mouth, make your taste-buds dance, creamy cheesecake. My mouth is now watering. The dulce de leche, banana cream, and vanilla bean, pecan turtle, and red velvet are delish. Skip the Reese's peanut butter one, its much too rich, and not all cheesecakes are created equal. The chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake is my personal fave. It is pretty much the most incredible temptation on the planet & if eating it were sin, I'd repent the rest of my life for a single bite."
