Karen B.,"Geneva, IL",32,39,7,1.0,4/12/2016,I really don't know why this place gets good reviews anymore. Its over priced bad tasting food...and almost $8 for a SLICE of cheesecake!! Honestly I use to like CF but after today's lunch visit. No thanks!! I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. Fries weren't warm at all (although the plate was very hot...must have sat under the warming light too long) and no flavor at all. The sandwich was so greasy it was stomach churning. Our server had zero personality. Ill never ever go back. Eli's cheesecake is better anyway.
Greg H.,"Hendersonville, TN",6,27,5,1.0,11/8/2014,Food is average at best. Forty plus minute wait isn't worth the food in my opinion. Yes I'll admit I'm a little ticked they don't have the over the top meatloaf sandwich anymore. It has been years since I've been to a CCF.. Our server sucked. Brings kids food out before our drinks so they have nothing to eat 45 mins after our food came out. Desert time we get the kids ice cream and asked twice for spoons... Never got them.
Jay S.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",2,21,,5.0,3/21/2016,"I am probably blinded by loyalty. But I have been a huge fan of the Orange Chicken for years now. Almost always great service and usually excellent food as well. I rarely get cheesecake here, but it's pretty good as well."
Melissa Z.,"Antioch, IL",3,14,7,4.0,2/19/2016,"Manager Ben is absolutely fantastic and completely accommodating. After an unexpectedly long wait, he made sure that we were well taken care of the entire night. It was a friend's birthday and he was sure to make the celebration extra special with the correct spelling of her name. Thank you Ben for being so wonderful!!"
Erinn P.,"Palatine, IL",122,7,1,2.0,3/12/2017,"So my family and I came here to celebrate  my sister getting married. When we first came in the  staff told us it would be an hr wait, since we had no other place in mind we decided to wait the hr. Little did we know that would turn into 1hr and 45 min of waiting not just an hr. That was just the start of this night. Don't get me wrong I understand the places in the mall get busy but this was just a crazy amount of time waisted. We  finally get a seat, at this point we are STARVING there are five of us waiting to chow. We were offered bread at our table and only got ONE basket for five people... after waiting 1hr and 45 min .... that was not enough for all 5 of us. We start looking at our meal options and my cousins opens her menu to a huge slab of butter smashed inbetween her menu, kinda gross not gonna lie. I decided I'd go ask for a new one and hit the bathrooms on my way. Not only was there a line in the bathroom ( understandable) but there was NO TOLIET paper in any of the bathroom stalls but ONE! I then went back up front to let someone know that the bathrooms are empty of toilet paper ( and to be honest they were a mess). After getting back to the table I was asked what I wanted to eat and I also asked for an ice tea that took about 25 min to even arrive after I was told by my waiter he forgot. Well that's not the only thing he forgot ... my meal didn't come out with everyone els food cuz they forgot... or maybe sent it to the wrong table because i saw someone else's food wondering around that night as well. I was pretty upset at this point that even the free crappy side salad didn't help. Best part of the night was that NONE of my food was free even tho it was late and someone els got my food  and I had to then wait even longer to eat after waiting so long to sit down. We all ordered desert and the part that blows my mind after all this crap is that our waiter forgot to add a peace of cheese cake to our tab came over AND GAVE my mom a new bill... no offense but that's super shitty after all the crap we went through that night.... shitty company for not givin me either my cheese cake or meal for free ... I'm super disappointed and the food was only ok. Pretty sure cheesecake factor will not be seeing me again unless this issue gets resolved."
Brian F.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",337,183,285,4.0,2/5/2015,"For your reading pleasure... another popular chain restaurant review! You've been to the Cheesecake Factory, haven't you? It's great! The only downside to this place is that the menu is so diverse, it will take you 30 minutes to decide! My go-to dish is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Just the right amount of sweet and loaded with plenty of chicken and shrimp. As an appetizer, the Buffalo Blasts are a must. The ambience is dark and loud, the service is top notch, food is delicious with large portions, and the wait times can get heavy because of the mall traffic. If you haven't been here, definitely stop in. If you have been here, you should agree, it's one of the better Cheesecakes in the Chicago area."
Crystal R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",67,21,6,3.0,4/13/2016,"I was actually quite disappointed..  I've been to other factories and I love it,  but today wasn't the case..  Bland food and a very apathetic staff..  Maybe next time"
Raja B.,"Bothell, WA",1,21,481,5.0,7/19/2015,"Huge menu. Check it out online at home , decide and then order when u dine in. Yummy pricey food. Usually large portion sizes."
Foodie S.,"Wheeling, IL",10,66,63,4.0,12/29/2014,Disclaimer : I don't really like Cheese cakes !! I go here just for their Chicken Samosas.. Oh my god ! They are heavenly.. I was amazed at how they made my Indian taste buds happy :D Love love love them :)
Lin C.,"Romeoville, IL",186,247,881,1.0,1/26/2015,"The food was pretty standard across all Cheesecake Factory. This review is based on 1 cheesecake and the service behind it. I was disappointed with the apple strudel cheesecake. It's safe to say, there was only 2 bites of cheesecake and the remainder of the slice was all strudel. When I filed a complaint with my server, she just said it was on the description of the menu and that the slice delivered exactly what was on the description. No apologies, no let me get you something else, no let me take this off your bill."
Kinnaree P.,"Bartlett, IL",20,1,,1.0,10/2/2016,We went to cheesecake factory for a dessert. The service  was garbage. We sat on the table for 20 minutes and nobody attended us. So went to the cashier Marissa and explained her our situation. She did not take any steps and we again waited for 15 minutes and finally ordered. We had to take our own plate to the table. There was a waiter kind enough to offer us the forks. So our total wait time at THE CHEESE CAKE FACTORY was 35 minutes for a cheesecake. A very bad experience. Did not expect this from cheesecake factory
Chelsea D.,"Chicago, IL",142,23,22,3.0,2/22/2015,"They don't take reservations but they weren't too busy on the Friday night my boyfriend and I decided to go. We were seated about 5 minutes after arriving and our waitress came at a decent time to welcome us and take our drink orders. She came back with our waters and bread about 10 minutes later (they aren't really known for great service), but we were ready to order at that point. I ordered the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, which was delish. My boyfriend got a double cheese burger with bacon and fries. He was also pleased.  Our friend also joined us last minute after we got our entrées. The problem with this was our waitress was no where to be found. Our friend was ready to order and we had to ask a nearby bus boy to find her. She came back 10 minutes later to take our friend's order (but didn't ask how our food was until my friend also got her entrée).  We proceeded to order cheesecake because we were at The Cheesecake Factory.. We got the Godiva chocolate one which is flourless but still has chocolate mousse. I would just recommend the regular chocolate mousse cheesecake if you are a fellow chocolate lover."
Melanie T.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,8,3,5.0,5/17/2015,Food is always good here.  We've been here several times and tried different items in their menu.  Everything is excellent!  Leave room for dessert.
Jaryd C.,"Palatine, IL",26,56,50,5.0,8/26/2014,"Come here all the time! We got the avavoado roll appetizer, they were amazing, my girlfriend had a salad she loved, and I got the Mac and cheese burger, I was not a dan after two bites the manager came over saw I was dissatisfied and instantly rectified the situation! She was awesome, I can't get over how great of service she provided!"
Margaret A.,"Chicago, IL",16,150,1,2.0,8/26/2016,Service was very slow. Had other things to do rather than sit and wait forever for our food.
Meg N.,"Beloit, WI",16,122,65,5.0,2/4/2015,Always an excellent experience at this location. Attentive servers and above par food. I love their brown bread starters and always end up getting that orange chicken as my meal. And who can actually come here and not get a piece of cheesecake?
Sweta P.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,2,,4.0,9/23/2016,"Large restaurant with decent decor. Service is pretty fast for such a busy place. Very big ,eal selection but thats why you meed to know what to order, hard to choose and dont make a mistake. Prices are average. In general love this place and always like to stop by once visiting the mall. Recommend"
Umaid S.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",5,10,,1.0,10/4/2015,"I totally agree with Jon D , the food was great as usual. Came for the Sunday brunch but the service was just bad , right from the beginning , actually I would go so far as to say it was rude. Very unwelcoming I've been going there for years but I'll never be back there."
Nikki L.,"Chicago, IL",343,298,77,5.0,12/27/2015,"We had the chicken eggrolls,  baked potato soup and my hubs had the California omelet.  Everything was good,  service was excellent and the bread basket was legit."
Jenny V.,"Chicago, IL",216,412,30,4.0,1/13/2013,"Big extensive menu! i've only had a sandwich from here and some appetizers. My friends got the fish tacos and chicken tacos which looked yummy! I also got the margherita flat bread which was nothing special. I love their cheesecake, if you go here and DON'T get cheesecake, you're crazy. unless you're allergic or something, then okay fine. on a friday or saturday night, make sure you make reservations."
