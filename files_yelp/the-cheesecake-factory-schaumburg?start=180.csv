Michelle S.,"South Barrington, IL",1,2,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Normally I love eating here, and the service is good. Without saying, the food is also good. This review is for takeout- called, got transferred to bakery for them to take my order, and then spent 15 uninterrupted minutes on hold.  I finally gave up on being able to order and hung up.  It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to nachos etc., but that was ridiculous, even for a Friday."
Scott N.,"Mundelein, IL",0,20,,3.0,2/1/2016,"Standard Cheesecake Factory with an insanely big menu. Actual meal was good. Would be a 4 star if not for our server with desert.  My mom can't have nuts so she asked if a certain type of cheesecake did. He said yes, but instead of offering something else, said she could just cut off the spine/bottom of it. Finally makes a recommendation that he said had no nuts; guess what it did. Instead of just immediately trying to correct, he continues to pick through it to say there aren't a ton of them."
Tyler J.,"San Clemente, CA",0,2,1,2.0,2/21/2016,More like the cheese(fake) factory.... Honestly the best item on the menu will consist of a fried ball of cheese (probably not american cheese... Tastes like stuff from another country) for the low low price of $10. Now give me a break. Americas greatest past time gone bad:-/
Avinash K.,"Elgin, IL",248,514,112,4.0,5/28/2014,"Been here about three times, have a lot of variety. Food is good and service is Ok to pretty good, usually its been pretty good but the last time I went, she was just hurrying us up. Their bread basket is pretty good - wheat bread is YUMM. So, we ordered a pear and blue cheese flatbreadd (serves 2) as an appetizer, it was really good. Then, pasta is pretty good too and huge quantity. Cheesecakes - oreo was awesome, kahlua was really good (for coffee lovers) and godiva was pure chocolate (chocolate lovers). Carrot cake was kickass too. (This was over 3 visits)."
Susan H.,"Huntley, IL",1,24,1,2.0,9/13/2014,"At lunch today sauce was spilled on shirt & both legs of my partner's jeans. It took 5-10min to get a wet rag, with barely a sorry. We had to return to Huntley before venturing out again to change clothes. Wouldn't recommend."
Jen J.,"Chicago, IL",1153,398,1723,3.0,2/4/2013,"I've tried their chicken marsala, several of their pasta dishes, shepherd's pie, steak, Thai lettuce wraps, Asian caramel chicken, raspberry cheesecake, etc, but my favorite items would be their mac & cheese burger ($12) and avocado egg rolls ($10.95). I had rated it 4 stars, but I'm downgrading it because of some blah experiences in the past year. Ordered my burger medium rare, but it came out well-done. Lemon-herb roasted chicken ($17.95) was meh, not juicy, overpriced for the portion. Thai lettuce wraps ($13.50) had so little chicken. Service has been average. Really off-putting hostess during a double date. Added to the fact that they don't take reservations and that we were quoted a wait of 2 hrs for a party of 4 before, my enthusiasm for this franchise & location has waned."
Susan P.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,,3.0,2/13/2016,"Hostess was incredibly rude and waiting 'in line' to be seated was obnoxious.  When finally seated, waitress was excellent and food was great.  Have son with multiple food allergies and they were very accommodating."
Marta H.,"Downers Grove, IL",98,43,53,5.0,5/5/2015,"Everything was excellent, I ordered factory skinny salad and my bf ordered orange chicken. My salad was really good and the portions are huge! I was full by the time I got half way through my salad. My bf orange chicken was amazing, the chicken was soft and the sauce just added that extra kick to the taste buds! I will definitely be back, this was a very pleasant experience and I would like to also add that our server Zheni was great!  She made sure we were ok and she was very personable!"
Angela C.,"Cincinnati, OH",87,154,106,4.0,8/6/2013,"Went here a while back and loved it. I got a ginormous salad, my wife got a nice piece of steak and we both got some cheesecake. The service was okay... not spectacular. They kinda smush people in together here. I was uncomfortably close to the people sitting next to us. Rather weird.  Only bad part was that we went shopping afterwards and had taken our cheesecake to go, so it sat in the car for like 3 hours. By the time my wife ate hers, it must have started going bad because she had a horribly achy stomach the whole rest of the night. Not so awesome."
Raul T.,"Carol Stream, IL",47,1,,1.0,1/17/2016,Came in today for lunch  with my wife and daughter 1 1/2 hour waiting time after that we had to wait another line about 15 to get seating we ordered a soup of the day and a cesar salad to start of with the salad was old yellow and really nasty it was my first time at this location the food was not good and tasty how I would imagine it too be I would not be coming back again !!!!!!
Irena G.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",0,3,,5.0,2/6/2016,"My favorite restaurant! The chicken madeira is amazing!The bread....mm I don't know its home made,but is soo delicious :)))"
Jessica P.,"Chicago, IL",161,278,2234,3.0,8/30/2012,"there has always been at least a 30 minute wait every time I go here.. it's sad that they don't take reservations!..but you can stall time by just walking around or hanging out at the bar area.. Food: -SkinnyLicious Factory Chopped Salad (let me rename it to blue cheese salad..): contains chopped romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, tomato, avocado, corn, bacon, blue cheese and apple with skinnylicious vinaigrette...the last time I tried the salad.. it was wayyyyyyy too cheesy.. and not a good cheesy.. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese and the whole salad tasted like blue cheese as if they put in blue cheese sauce ...i think there was more blue cheese in the salad than there was lettuce... *is SkinnyLicious really a diet salad?...I'm not qutie sure on that.. the portions are smaller than a normal salad (but they still give you a lot!!), but I think that's about it.. the taste is probably the same as a normal size salad... -Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes: tamale cakes topped with sour cream, avocado, and salsa verde.. i love this appetizer!! it's delicious!!!! I dare you to try it! -Pasta Carbonara: tastes good - my friends and their friends and their friends friends all love this dish, but very oily and heavy?....like the rest of their pastas.. -Cheesecake: if you have a sweet tooth and you're craving cheesecake, you've come to the right place! .. cheesecakes are delicious and very sweet!! oo and pricey too for just 1 piece.. but you can definitely share a piece with others because it's REALLY SWEET!.. **there's almost always going to be leftovers because they give you big portions. I've tried their other food items, but it's been too long...sorry! i'll have to update this at a later time.. Atmosphere: a place for everyone whether it's family, friends, or significant others, but if you don't like dim lit places, this is not the place for you... it's very dark in here!! maybe romantic, but sometimes loud cuz it is crowded.. Service: good, but it also depends on who your waitress/waiter is... Price: reasonable.."
Veena S.,"Aurora, IL",6,11,,1.0,1/30/2016,"I and my hus went on a Saturday evening.  The waiting time was half an hour +. Environment was not very welcome, the seating arrangements was bad. It was a very tiny table to accommodate two dinner plates +drinks. It took me 15min to read the complete menu, it's like a novel. My hus ordered teriyaki chicken and he got a burned chicken breast. I went with very spicy cashew chicken and it tasted sweet and tangy."
Gemma B.,"Fitchburg, WI",48,63,23,2.0,6/14/2014,"We go for exactly one reason. I'm obsessed with their sweet corn tamale cakes. It's pretty much the perfect food and it's the one thing they do right. The service is terrible every single time we go. It's gotten to the point where we literally just expect the service to be slow and god awful.  We've both had other things on the menu but they're always just slightly not right.  Honestly the place isn't worth the hype. As soon as I figure out how to make the corn cakes on my own, I'll not be returning."
Trina K.,"Chicagoland, IL",99,920,2433,3.0,6/23/2012,"Not crazy about their food but enjoy their cheesecake. My favorite is the Dulce de Leche. It's delicious!!  Jack of everything, master of nothing. The food menu is extensive but it's part of the reason they don't specialize in any food item. Their marketing advantage is variety. The food is Judy okay but everyone can find something they prefer."
Tharanisa T.,"Bradford, PA",35,12,5,4.0,11/7/2014,Love it! Had a Louisiana chicken pasta which was off the chain! Filling with a Greek salad. Had to try the peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake that was quite impressive.
Jennifer S.,"Bartlett, IL",361,677,2317,4.0,5/12/2012,"We visit The Cheesecake Factory about four times a year. I used to visit more, but I'm always annoyed at some point during my visit for one of many reasons that I usually have to wait a few months before my next visit. Why the four stars then?  Well, the food is delicious!  Overpriced?  Yes, but delicious!  And if the visit causes enough aggravation, a manager will get involved and usually find a way to try and apologize...usually thru more of the yummy food!   Most recently, my sister and a girlfriend of ours stopped in for a Monday (?) night dinner. No wait. This was a first!  That was a nice start. We were seated by the large birthday party in the back, so it was loud. Well, it's always loud here. In case you haven't caught on yet...you go for the food and not the conversation time with your loved ones.  Butter. It's a precious commodity at The Cheesecake Factory. Seriously, I think it is part of the official TCF training. You do not, under any circumstances, give more than three little foil wrapped butters to any one table at any given time!  They'll give you warm bread 'til the cows come home however.  I have yet to try something here that I didn't like. From the Kobe burger to the shrimp club sandwich to the Cajun chicken littles to the thai chicken pasta. It's all good. Really good. The cheesecake ain't too shabby either. Expensive though. $7 ish for a slice. It's so rich that you can easily share it. Oh, and every slice arrives with fresh whipped cream. If that's not your thing, just ask them to skip the whipped cream.  My suggestion?  Go in with the knowledge of my review behind you and you won't be disappointed. Go ahead...text each other at the table to 'talk', eat your bread...and keep asking for butter, pack up half your meal right away because it's a huge serving and eat dessert. Because you can. And because you now know that you are only going here for the food."
Kelly R.,"Roselle, IL",0,6,,5.0,11/22/2014,"Food was delicious! The Skinnylicious options are extensive and tasty. Service was great and management was wonderful.  Doug, our server, and Ben, the manager, went  above and beyond to make our evening wonderful. My husband and I will definitely return. Thank you!"
Edward P.,"Bartlett, IL",1,35,26,3.0,9/9/2015,Adam's peanut butter cheesecake was delicious. Service was not great. Host was not paying attention. Menu has too many items. Burgers ok!
Calvin R.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,24,1,2.0,11/15/2015,"Simply had a slice of the white chocolate macadamia to take away. Oh my it was super sweet, and not in a good way! Way too much sugar and then they pile extremely sweet cream on top and add another dollop of it on the side! I love cheesecake and I like sweet stuff but this is too much. Won't allow my child to have any of it ever."
