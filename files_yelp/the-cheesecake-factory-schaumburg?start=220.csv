Danielle e.,"Yorkville, IL",0,8,,5.0,8/22/2015,Service was outstanding during a Saturday dinner rush we waited 2 minutes. Our waiters name was Fransisco. He was very attentive brought us refills right away and followed up with us several times I ensure we didn't need anything! The food was amazing for an appetizer we ordered the buffalo blasts they were so good next time it will be my meal! I had the chicken Madeira an it's was perfectly cooked and savory in flavor I requested loaded mashed potatoes as opposed to regular and they brought a separate dish with a mountain of mashed potatoes with melted cheese tons of bacon and chives! Yum my bf had the filet mignon again perfectly cooked! We will definitely be back!
Marc V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/20/2015,"Consistently good quality. On a business trip 2,000 miles form home and the quality of food and service was as expected. Really good! The salad o got was fantastic. Server was very pleasant. Best food I've had on this city on this trip."
Kate S.,"Schaumburg, IL",6,16,,3.0,11/27/2013,"Let me start by saying looking for the restaurant was like searching for the Ark of the Covenant, except for the whole ""finding it after all"" part. Maybe not exactly like the Ark...basically it's tricky to find. So if anyone else has trouble, it's next to the upper level entrance of Macy's in Woodfield Mall. Not the Streets of Woodfield, but Woodfield Mall itself. I can't fault The Cheesecake Factory for my geographic ineptitude. We called ahead to try and make a reservation for our group of 7, but they don't take reservations during their holiday season. When this actually starts and ends, I don't know. But we were still able to get a table. I asked my server right away about my allergies and what was safe for me (nuts and shellfish, for what it's worth). She was very knowledgeable, and told me the process in the kitchen for patrons with allergies, which I really appreciated. I felt taken care of. It's worth noting that the cheesecake itself isn't prepared in house, and has the standard ""may contain traces of"" warning associated with it. The table ordered a round of cocktails, and all were pretty great. I got the Asian Pear Martini, which contains sake, ""pear""  and ""passion fruit"" (who knows what that actually means, syrup or otherwise), vanilla vodka, and sake. The technical term for this is ""stupid delicious."" But everything we ordered was good - we did the ""pass to the left, try everything"" system. Other drinks included the signature margarita, a strawberry daiquiri, and a red sangria. After some liquid courage, I tackled the menu. It's 20 pages. This isn't an exaggeration - the menu is literally 20 pages long, containing all drinks and c-cakes. But holy selection. I finally settled on the pasta carbonara, which is spaghettini with smoked bacon, green peas, and a garlic-parmesan cream sauce. It was pretty great. Warm, creamy, bacony - it hit the spot on the coldest night ever on the face of this planet. Nothing to write home about, but it was tasty. As far as the cheesecakes, I ordered the tiramisu for myself and the banana cream for my boyfriend because I express feelings through food. The tiramisu was okay. It tasted like a normal, slightly bland cheesecake, without any of the amazing dark flavors of tiramisu. No espresso and a slight dusting of cocoa do not a tiramisu make. Overall it was tasty, but I don't see myself clamoring to go back, especially for the price. But it's fun for a casual night out with some ladyfriends to catch up before you break out the boxed wine. The service was the best part - the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and gave great suggestions. I wish I caught our server's name so I could give her her proper ups. And I learned that it's THE Cheesecake Factory, and you can't skip it, thereby making The Cheesecake Factory is the The Ohio State University of restaurants."
Mari W.,"Marengo, IL",0,22,4,2.0,3/30/2016,"So I visited this place last night for my father in laws birthday. The meal was awesome, Chinese chicken salad, bacon burger, and chicken Madeira, nachos, and of course cheesecake. I have no issue with the food. Cheesecake factory fix your woodfield  staff! I have never met such a rude waitress in my life. She was talking to her friends the whole time!! The buss staff had to do her job. This was my second time here and my father in laws first, because of her I don't think we will be back."
L B.,"Roselle, IL",0,9,,1.0,3/13/2016,"This was the 2nd visit in a month.  Used to love this place but lack of service, 7 peoples meals came out about 15 minutes apart both times we visited.  Food was sub-par for 2nd time also"
Gwen O.,"Nicholasville, KY",9,49,148,5.0,3/12/2014,This place was very very good. I will definitely the finding another one of these restaurants close to my hometown. The prices were very reasonable and the food was amazing. I got pear with blue cheese flatbread and chicken wonton with the best dipping sauce ever! I highly recommend this place! Atmosphere was warm and cozy and OMG the desserts were to die for!!!!! There were a million different cheesecakes to choose from however we chose to try the chocolate cake and that was great!
First L.,"Elgin, IL",0,1,,1.0,4/15/2016,The pizza I ordered was so dry!!! Shittiest service ever! The waiter was so rude and took forever to bring the food out. Food was also cold when arrived. Not going back for sure.
Katherine P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",1,6,,4.0,6/12/2014,"I came here for my graduation dinner with 10 other family members. The waitress was so kind and patient with all my rude siblings!  She never took no for an answer. I ordered the regular cheese pizza, and I thought it was good. I mean, all pizza is greasy right? I expected it, no big deal. My dad got the salmon and he said it was great. Overall, everyone was happy with their food. I also got a complimentary cheesecake with a candle on top. Absolutely nothing to complain about their cheesecake, simply tasty.  I will be coming back here for special occasions with a pleasure."
Ramone B.,"Crest Hill, IL",206,330,470,2.0,7/29/2013,"I'm really not too sure what everyone's obsession with this place is? The cheesecake is good, but I had a jambalaya pasta that was severely UNDERWHELMING!!! I was expecting a nice kick, and it was bland as all get out. It was  almost $20 bucks for that dish. Imma need The Cheesecake Factory to #DoBetter       I went for the Dulce de Leche cheesecake. Gurl I could've went back in time and slap  the S*** outta Harriet Tubman it was soooo good lol!! I will definitely stop if I'm in the vicinity of a Cheesecake Factory for a slice of cheesecake, but I'd NEVER EVER in this lifetime  say ""Hmm let's go to the Cheesecake Factory for a meal."" That's just the way it is.... Until next time y'all......."
Stephen O.,"Memphis, TN",119,58,7,4.0,9/26/2013,"The secret to eating at the Cheesecake Factory is NEVER THINK ABOUT CALORIE COUNTS when eating there. Seriously. As long as you don't 'go there', you will have a superlative experience. We only waited about fifteen minutes and got our table. If you have not been to The Cheesecake Factory, let me illuminate you: you do not get a menu, you get a comprehensive breakdown of a variety of food cultures and genres. It is like War and Peace: The Menu. What I have discovered over the years is that the food is pretty amazing no matter what you get (astonishingly). Our server was somewhat *less* than amazing (pretty terrible actually) but since we had a few dozen pages of menu to read it wasn't so bad. We started out with the Tex Mex Eggrolls. You need these in your life. Spicy chicken, corn, black beans, cheese, with an avacado cream sauce and salsa?  Come ON. Next, I went for a Greek Salad  Unsurprisingly, I got extra dressing. I cannot recommend this greek salad enough. It is probably the best I have had, edging out Mellow Mushroom by a tiny bit. I have to admit I overdid it on the dressing at this place. My friends were both laughing about my greek ""soup"" when my salad was about half gone. That stuff was delicious though! For the record, I did not drink it hahaha. For an entree, my buddy and I both got the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. It was basically corn tortillas containing spicy chicken and covered with melted cheese and cilantro and just ridiculously awesome. The corn cakes that came with it were almost as good as the tortillas themselves. I want to describe them further but... I cannot... it was just so good. I could not finish it but I wanted to! My roommate got the Baja Chicken Tacos which looked delicious and certainly less gut busting than our dinner. He said they were excellent. For dessert we of course got cheesecake, but I do not think any pictures exist (due to our inhalation of said cheesecake). I do not remember what I had, but it was amazing. We had our last adventure of the day trying to get a server to bring us our check. We were there pretty late and the place was shutting down, I think it probably took 20 minutes or more just to get a check, then 15 more to get it back and leave. If not for that service, this would have been a five star review.  Yes I know the Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but every time I go they knock the food out of the park."
Amy S.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,20,1,4.0,6/6/2015,"Delicious corn tamale appetizer, get them every time!        Extensive menu, fair prices, excellent cheesecake and options of cheesecake and our server was super nice!   Pork chop amazing, fish tacos a bit bland! Excellent kids meal options!"
Kati L.,"Downers Grove, IL",219,14,22,5.0,12/2/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory has gotten some great things right. First, though they're always crowded (what Cheesecake Factory isn't?) they do a great job setting expectations around wait-time, and then they beat that time.  Every time.  But that's really just putting years of research around perceived wait time to good use.  What made this visit different enough to warrant a review is Misty.   My mother has celiac disease, which has opened up a whole new perspective on service in restaurants.  Since ""gluten-free"" is the diet du jour, it's pretty easy to find GF items called out at most major restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory is no exception, and has GF versions of many of their most popular dishes. Misty, who was our server for the first half of the meal, took things a step further.  She assured us that she not only placed the GF order, but also that she'd checked in to make certain my mother would be served the right version of her meal.  When she brought bread to the table, she brought my mother a basket of chips and salsa.  That was huge.  My mom's used to sitting patiently while the rest of us knock out a bread basket, and having chips brought with the bread had a big impact.  It showed that Misty understood what gluten free is all about, and how it feels to have a dietary restriction that conflicts with standard restaurant protocol.   This was a big win, and such a small gesture that made my mother feel like part of the table.  Kudos to Misty for taking care of the people, rather than just delivering our orders."
David L.,"Elgin, IL",44,14,9,2.0,2/23/2015,"Came for lunch. First having to wait 37 minutes for our food to come out, lunch special salmon and chicken Alfredo, was a little bad. But the overwhelming amount of salt on both these dishes took the cake. The tea was good and the waiter was a good guy."
Alyssa K.,"Lindenhurst, IL",84,294,67,4.0,1/13/2014,"I've never tried the Cheesecake Factory before so I thought it would be fun to go on a date night here on a Friday night before Christmas.  We headed out for a late dinner and arrived around 8:30.  Well the mall was packed still and plenty of people were waiting for tables. They gave us a buzzer and told us it would be 20 minutes so we went out into the hall to wait where it was much less crowded.  The wait was just as expected and not too bad.  We had a table in the back and our server came right over once we were seated. The bread we were served was delicious.  I really enjoyed the whole wheat one.  Since we had waited 20 minutes to be seated, we both had the chance to look over the menu so we already knew what we wanted to order. We both ordered a drink also and I think our server might have gotten a bit distracted because there was a little delay in getting those.  Our food came out fairly quickly and my oh my the servings were large.  We had already agreed ahead of time that we were most definitely getting cheesecake, but that didn't stop my boyfriend from putting down his entire meal.  He still ate the cheesecake too.  I still wonder how he stays so skinny.  The cheesecake was delicious and my leftovers were great the next day as well."
Kate B.,"Iron Mountain, MI",37,85,187,3.0,2/1/2015,"Food was delicious, but service was very slow. ....Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake!?!? HURT ME MOMMIE."
Donna R.,"Bartlett, IL",84,316,45,3.0,9/23/2013,"Its kind of funny... usually my husband and I see eye-to-eye on restaurants... but cheesecake, oh man does he hate it.  For some odd reason, everything he orders here is terrible and I will agree (I mean one time his ""burger"" looked pitiful -- cheese was not melted, bun looked like it belonged to an Italian beef, dry patty, and it had no flavor whatsoever), but what I usually order is really good.  So hence, the 3 stars. Anywho... been here a couple of times since my last review and felt that it deserved an update.  It has either been a happy hour event... lunch or dinner with some GFs... the hubby will NOT come back here unless the meal will be free, so I guess that isn't happening anytime soon.  I love their Asian salad during lunch... its a pretty big portion and its delicious, plus the complimentary bread is pretty darn good.  I am also obsessed with the Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls.  I mean, you really can't go wrong with those 4 words, but they make it even better by having them sit in a bead of marinara.   Last time I was here I got the Garlic Noodles, which consisted of, you guessed it, garlic noodles, asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms.  The portion was HUGE, lasted me three meals... but they definitely skimped on the veggies and this was a $13 dish.  My friends Romano Chicken looked to-die-for and, again, the portion was huge... but she was sick throughout the night.  Granted, we had drinks, appetizer, dinner, and cheesecake, so it could have been too much rich food.  And the cheesecake.... OMG heaven.  We had the Smores' one and we were just both blown away.  I wish I was eating it right now. It is a VERY expensive place, which sometimes drives me nuts cause its a chain in a freaking mall, but you definitely get what you pay for (here and there at least).  If you don't want to spend a ton, share a meal, there will be PLENTY of food for two people."
Shannon R.,"Huntley, IL",38,83,34,2.0,3/28/2015,"Just came for desserts.  Wait was 50 minutes, which isn't horrible but don't tell us 30 wait time. Hot chocolate came out like warm (borderline cold),  asked to get it warmed up and didn't get replacement until we were finished eating and ready for check.  Disappointing service."
Joe P.,"Milwaukee, WI",96,560,94,3.0,5/13/2013,"Descriptive phrase: the portions, oh goodness the portions! Are Cheesecake Factories ever not in a mall area? No matter. This CF is giant just like the mall it calls home. We waited for around 20 minutes for a large party on a busy Sunday, so not that bad. I didn't quite grasp the meaning behind the Egyptian decor (why isn't it a factory that makes cheesecake?), but it was at least pretty. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. Our food came out quickly. I had the Monterey Cheeseburger ($11.95) with sweet potato fries (+$1). Giant burger with avocado, jack cheese, arugula, red onion, and honey mustard mayo. Very good, and cooked to my liking. The sweet potato fries required an extra wait and were unremarkable. Others got the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad ($14.50), which was absolutely massive. It looked like there was literally a whole head of lettuce in that bowl. The original margarita I had was meh. No life in it, pretty watery. I tried the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and found it, like all their cheesecakes seem to be, decadent but much, much too rich. Overall, a fine experience of decent food, huge portions, and just okay pricing. Exactly what I expected from the Cheesecake Factory. Now excuse me while I go into a food-coma."
Rachel D.,"Elgin, IL",10,108,29,4.0,2/1/2014,"I had been eating at The Cheesecake Factory for years at home in Illinois. That being said I had stopped going once I stopped working and needed to eat gluten & dairy free for health reasons. Also living in Elgin going to Schaumburg is not like dining at a local restaurant. In November 2013 my half-brother gave me to two $25 Gift Cards for my Hanukkah Gift. I decided in January to treat my best friend to lunch here for her belated holiday gift and to celebrate my January B-day early because I would be out of town. I checked the online menu and was very impressed with the large Gluten free Menu. I ordered the Gluten Free Fusli pasta with the marinara sauce and it was cooked perfectly and tasted great which is not always the case with Gluten Free pasta, the portion was HUGE and enough for me to take home and have 2 more meals. The only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars and not 5 is because there is no where close to park to the restaurant entrance and Woodfield is always crowded, even in the dead of winter and snowing and extreme cold. I would prefer them to have parking right in front of the restaurant like they do in other malls, as I need handicapped parking."
Ashley F.,"Streamwood, IL",19,43,20,1.0,2/17/2014,"I've been to this restaurant a few times and really enjoyed the food and service. I suggested it to a couple of friends coming out from the city, but now I'm sorry I did. I tried to make reservations the day before, but when I stopped in, I was told they don't take reservations on weekend.  I arrived at 1:30 and was told there was a 40 minute wait. The place was a zoo! Worse than the parking lot, which took over 20 minutes to find a spot. Even after out pager was buzzed, we stood around like it was some kind of cattle call.  We finally were seated and waters were put in front of us, but no one introduced themselves as our server for almost an hour! When we finally flagged someone over, the waitor said ""Oh, I just didn't want to interrupt you guys talking."" No, let's be honest- you forgot about us and don't want to admit it. But thanks for lying to our faces instead of living up to your mistake.  We quickly put in an app order. Not once were we asked if we'd like anything else to drink, so we just sipped our water the whole time were were there. The app came pretty quickly, but then our food order wasn't taken until about a half hour after our app was finished.  I wanted to order a chicken salad sandwhich off the skinnylicious menu. I asked to sub the salad for the sweet potato fries. I was told it's the exact same sandwich on the regular menu. I was thinking they used light mayo, etc. Apparently the only thing ""skinny"" about this menu is the side is chosen for you- you get a green salad.  After another long wait, my friends' food was brought out and not mine. They politely waited for mine to come out while theirs got cold. My sandwich came- light my ass! It was SMOTHERED in mayo and the bread had butter oozing out of it. It was disgustng. I couldn't even eat it after all that wait. To top it off, my fries came out when my friends had already finished their meals.  I can't believe I paid over $20 for a disgusting ""meal"" and 2 eggrolls. IF I EVER decide to go back, I will be going to the one downtown or in Oak Brook."
