Valentin S.,"Antioch, IL",6,3,,1.0,3/13/2015,"Worst experience of my life,  I can't even give them one star. This happened on Valentines Day after waiting for a while we are seated we get the water and complimentary bread,  we order and we wait 1 hr for our food,  not even one time the waiter to ask us anything.  He was taking care the tables around us,  but not us. . Finally we get our food,  my wife chicken is burned my burrito sat under the wormer for a while. Even the manager was shocked at the food. I'll not go back to the Woodfield Cheesecake again."
Ashley B.,"Urbana, IL",475,597,743,4.0,10/21/2011,"What can I say, it's a cheesecake factory. They're all pretty solid and they all have massive menus. I'll take it."
Morgan O.,"Chicago, IL",3,12,,2.0,2/28/2015,THIS PLACE IS SOO BUSY OMG. Don't go to this place when you are hungry because it'll be a long wait before you get your food. We ordered a small appetizer and it never came (luckily we weren't charged for this) we had a decent waiter but his shift ended and we had some totally clueless girl. Also I asked for lemon water and I had to steal a lemon from my dad's ice tea since they never got me any lemons for my water. Also there was a very annoying LOUD screaming baby that wouldn't be quiet. This place is so crowded all the time! Very frustrating. We had to park about a mile away too because of all the crowds. Won't be back anytime soon!!
Michael K.,"Mount Prospect, IL",113,15,1,3.0,1/13/2013,"I stayed away from this place because I always heard it was over priced but decided to try it out after I received a gift card for the holidays. The service was great, the food was okay. The Mac and cheese ball appetizers were delicious but don't expect them to satisfy your party's appetite... 4 for $11! Delicious, but not worth the price. I had the fish tacos for my main entre. Not very flavorful, I'd recommend staying away from them. The Reese's cup cheese cake was delicious! Service: 5/5 Food: 3/5"
Michelle P.,"Yorkville, IL",0,2,1,1.0,9/19/2015,"Just came to cheesecake factory in Schaumburg Il, waited 40 minutes to place my order sat down and was told they didn't have any Turkey Burgers how annoying is that this is the Cheesecake Factory where are your expectations.  We spoke to the manager and she didn't seem to even care why bother coming to this place once again the service is terrible and yet I continue to go shame on me. Just a heads up don't go if you want the turkey burger omg get it together why don't you."
Courtney W.,"Brandon, FL",1213,580,84,4.0,12/3/2012,"I'm going to give this place four stars, don't shoot me or take my foodie card. When this location opened up in Woodfield when I was just a kid I was enamored. I always went with my parents and waited upwards of an hour. The bonus is that you get a pager and can walk to some of the stores in the mall why you wait, why not? The service can be slow but the portions make up for it. I love getting 2-3 meals for the price of one. I'm also a sucker for sweet tea or really iced tea of any kind. I can't help myself. Sometimes, I'll come here just for dessert but make sure to split a slice or take half home for later, I don't recommend eating a slice in one sitting."
Rishi S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,8,7,4.0,1/14/2014,Amazing but expensive. Try the turtle pecan cake thats my fav.
Reynauld A.,"Bolingbrook, IL",44,11,8,5.0,10/19/2013,First time here on sweetest day and didn't know I was missing such a good thing.  Thanks Leslie and Andrew for making sweetest day a blast.
Hsia F.,"Washington, DC",239,190,43,4.0,1/15/2013,"Although I was expecting a stand alone restaurant like the one in Oak Brook, once I found it - I was like duh! Its located in the mall in the upper level, so park near the Macy's! I drove around about 15 minutes looking for this joint. The restaurant is a good size, my girls and I enjoyed brunch here on Sunday. The pancakes are HUGE and very good. The pricing is comprable to the others and the menu seemed bigger....but it may not be, not too sure. They now have a ""Skinny"" menu.....I looked it over, didn't order anything from it, no pancakes :( lol. We were seated immediately and the server wasn't that great but got the job done."
Amanda L.,"Arlington Heights, IL",73,126,105,5.0,7/7/2013,"How can you not love The Cheesecake Factory? Especially now that they have a lighter options menu, this is back to being one of my favorite restaurants. And don't let the ""smaller portions, lower calories"" fool you - these are the same generous CF portions you've come to know and love (and sometimes fear). You can even get some of your favorites, just in more reasonable sizes, or with small changes (the chopped salad, for example, has a different, and equally delicious dressing).  And of course...dessert. I've had more cheesecake from CF than I care to admit, but they have all been great (even the sugar free options). I will say that all slices are generous and big enough to share for sure, but if you just can't agree on a flavor with your dining companion, it's not such a tragedy to take home some sweet leftovers! Service is always great here, the atmosphere is nice (active but not too loud)  There is almost always a wait, especially during peak meal hours and Sunday mornings. Sometimes you can find seating in the bar area without a wait, and they serve a full menu. Also - I know they used to do this, not sure if they still do, but they used to have a wonderful happy hour (from 4-6 on weeknights), where you could get smaller versions of the appetizers for a few bucks a piece. My friends and I would meet up and each order two or three things for the same price as an entree. Haven't done this in awhile, but we really enjoyed it when we had time."
Ann C.,"Algonquin, IL",45,141,,4.0,7/28/2012,"I should have probably posted this review a long time ago, but seeing someone else review Cheesecake Factory reminded me of my experience. Years ago, my hubby and I took our son here for dinner. Our son was little... around a year and a half. We arrived at dinner time... HIS DINNER TIME... and he was hungry. He was being a little fuss-ball and our waiter noticed. A few minutes after we were seated, he brought out a plate with cut up bananas, crackers and little pieces of cheese for our son. I thought that was the nicest thing. This waiter was young and probably didn't have kids but knew exactly what would make our little guy stop fussing. The adult food was awesome too!"
Vin M.,"Lyons, IL",3,24,2,4.0,8/29/2013,"Very good food quality, good service, great atomsphere. This place delivers where it counts and the prices are reasonable for what you recieve.  Everytime we go it always ends up being a good choice."
Jay G.,"Highland, IN",2,14,18,5.0,12/13/2013,"Bread, yum. It has some oats on it so I can pretend it is good for me.  I always get the sweet corn cakes they are great, I haven't found anything like them. They have a huge menu but I unusually get the Bellagio chicken and Save half for home.  Then you can always try a cheese cake or chocolate cake for me. I just take it home though and sit down later with a big glass of milk. Wake up and exercise for 3 days."
Kevin S.,"Winfield, IL",44,178,127,3.0,10/9/2014,"A large menu with plenty to choose from. Me and my girlfriend like to come here but there are a few issues.  The prices, wait time and noise is excessive. I don't like cheesecake but my girlfriend loves it. She's cray cray. I do however their Oreo milkshakes !!"
Nic H.,"Oak Brook, IL",0,2,,1.0,6/20/2014,"I should start by saying that I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory, and have extensive experience in the food industry. After eating here recently and getting severely ill from the food, I'm not only disappointed in the restaurant, but also in the way the manager handled the incident. My advice is first- stay away from the seafood entrees. The Bistro Shrimp pasta made me the sickest I've ever been in my life- and resulted in a 4-day stomach virus. When I called the manager to report this, his tone was accusatory and all he offered was a ""small gift certificate"" and a follow-up phone call -- both of which were never received. Considering my bill came to $80- that ""small gift certificate"" won't cover the hours lost from work, misery I endured for four days or repair my views on this chain.  SKIP IT unless you want to lose 5 lbs from being sick!!"
Cristie F.,"Roselle, IL",415,376,300,3.0,4/19/2012,"I guess I just don't understand the draw to the Cheesecake Factory. I think it's just okay. But I hear tons of people raving about it. Here's my justification as to why... 1. It's ridiculously over priced. 2. There's always a wait at this location. Always. 3. The service is never more than, meh. 4. The food is never more than, meh. 5. Their menu is more overwhelming than an accounting textbook.  With that being said, it is what it is. I will admit, their addition of the small plates and SkinnyLicious menu items makes dining there a bit less gluttonous. The food is decent, especially the salads and the small plates. I stick to those. But, the shining star of Cheesecake Factory is, in fact, their cheesecake. I, for one, love their Vanilla Bean, Key Lime, or Pumpkin cheesecakes. They're extremely flavorful and always creamy and decadent. The portions are huge, and being diabetic, I usually have enough cheesecake for a week. And I do love the fact they have a low carb cheesecake. It makes me and my pancreas quite happy.  All in all, I'll make a cameo in CF every once in a blue moon, but for the price and the quality of dishes, coupled with an hour and a half wait,  I'd rather go elsewhere."
Hina Q.,"Mississauga, Canada",74,445,63,4.0,8/15/2012,"We had family visiting from out of town, so we decided to show them woodfield mall and get in some shopping at the same time. After we were done shopping, we had planned to bring them to cheesecake factory. My husband and I have been to the restaurant before but first time to this location. For everyone else it was their first time at Cheesecake Factory. Everyone enjoyed their meal and had was suprised at the large portions they offer. The waitress in particular was extremely patient with us given a large group, and although they did not get my husbands drink correct, bloddy mary, she tried twice and then offered to remove it from the bill. Acknowledging the exceptional service!  We have been to many restaurants where if the specialty drinks are not made correct, even if we do not drink it they still charge the amount. At times we have paid for drinks we didnt even get to enjoy or have.  Location is fairly big and spread out so it does not appear cramped. However there can be a long wait, we waited about 1 1/2 hour so plan accordingly.  If one person from your group waits at the restaurant, the others can still walk around or shop!"
Kristi H.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,3,,2.0,1/3/2016,"I so wanted to love my Cheesecake Factory experience tonight but, unfortunately, that was not the case.  After reading the reviews, I had resigned myself to the idea of a long wait; however, we were seated quickly. We arrived at 430 on a Sunday to a packed lobby. But we put our name in and were seated within 15 minutes. So fantastic, right? Wrong. We were seated in a booth directly across from the kitchen entrance. You know the one, every restaurant has one. It's almost an afterthought booth, as if the builder looked at the blueprint, saw an empty space, and decided to stick something there to fill it up. Gah. So noisy with dishes being thrown around that I couldn't hear the conversation of my table mates, and the constant line of servers walking past like soldiers marching in formation was actually stirring up a breeze. By the time the smirking server arrived at our table and proceeded to describe the daily special of salmon something or other and pronounced the word salmon with an audible ""L"", I was ready to move. The hostess came over, found us a fantastic spot far away from the kitchen, and helped us move our drinks and menus. Hooray! But then... We placed our order. Knowing it might be a while on this busy Sunday, we ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer with no cilantro. Then each of us ordered an entree. The tamale cakes came out covered with cilantro. The server took them back to the kitchen to have them remade. By the time they came back out to the table, we already had our entrees. And no appetizer plates. No biggie, we all ate the appetizer from the serving dish. And, truth be told, the appetizer was the best part of the meal. It would have tasted even better if the dish had been comp'd for our trouble, but it wasn't.  The entrees: kid's pizza, steak Diane, falafel salad, and an order of pot stickers were all just meh. The one alcoholic drink I ordered was rather weak and I was never offered a second. Which I wasn't sure if I should be mad or glad about once I saw the $10.25 price tag for what was essentially a vodka lemonade. The others had soft drinks that were never refilled. And the list goes on... So, overall, a 2 star experience for short wait time and food that was edible. The kitchen mistakes, meal timing, inattentive wait staff, and food quality for value makes up for the other three missed stars. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, I would have to say that I'll skip a return trip. Oh, and don't bother ordering the key lime cheesecake.  This did not even remotely resemble cheesecake. It was a tall serving of soft key lime pie. Like key lime pudding. Mush. Not good when you are expecting a piece of key lime flavored cheesecake. I would think, out of the whole meal, that The Cheesecake Factory would get the cheesecake right. Sigh. A perfect disappointing end to a disappointing night...."
Megan S.,"Chicago, IL",38,278,47,3.0,2/1/2013,I really wish they would make a gf cheesecake.
Carrie H.,"Joliet, IL",6,17,11,2.0,10/20/2014,"I normally would give an excellent review of this restaurant but this fluke visit was a disaster. First off our waitress greeted us with her name as soon as we were seated and then disappeared. She didn't ask if we wanted drinks or anything. She came back 15 minutes later and we ordered salads. She forgot our dressing until 20 minutes into the salad. When she came with the dressing and noticing I had already been eating the salad she quickly dodged to the bar area to hide it. After I paid with my card , I noticed my card was charged twice with 2 different amounts. I waited too see if the mistake would drop off my account.  It didn't. So ,I called and was told it was taken care of. It's now been 10 days and nothing.  Very disappointing!"
