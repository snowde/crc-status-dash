Michelle F.,"Chicago, IL",51,220,29,4.0,3/17/2012,"Who gets drunk at The Cheesecake Factory? I do. That's who. I always enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory whenever I'm at Woodfield; it's just a good time. I was recently there for a lunch date with my BFF. There was a long wait, of course, but since there were only two of us, it was only about a half hour. We ordered a couple drinks, hence the getting ""drunk at The Cheesecake Factory"" part. I ordered J.W.'s Pink Lemonade, which came with Skyy citrus vodka, raspberry liqueur and lemonade. It was delicious! It was sweet and sour and refreshing. Highly recommend.  For an entree, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club, which had chicken breast, avocado, bacon, tomato, melted Swiss and herb mayonnaise. Really tasty! I would definitely order it again. It also came with plenty of fries served in this cute, metal container. Then of course, we had to order cheesecake. I got the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which of course was amazing. Once you get seated, the service is always really good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, despite the restaurant being super-busy. We didn't feel rushed and hung out there sipping cocktails for quite a few hours.  Overall, I enjoy eating lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, there's a long wait, but, to me, it's the best place to eat inside the mall."
Josh M.,"Downers Grove, IL",89,110,73,4.0,3/11/2012,Holy shit there is something wrong with a restaurant that needs to put advertisements in their menu binders. Yah its a binder. There is no lack of choices and fortunately most of them are good. With a happy hour that offers half price apps its hard not to just make a meal out of them. I have tried some of the burgers and pastas but there are a couple of apps or what they call small plates that have me wanting to return. There are the buffalo blasts that are essentially buffalo chicken inside a wonton wrapper and fried. Can't go wrong with that. Another standout are the sweet corn tamale cakes. A little crispy and perfectly creamy in the center. I would order tamales more often if they were like this and not the usual dried up bricks. The most unlikely item that blew me away was the Vietnamese tacos. Soft pork buns with an addictive soy marinade and a ton of pickled veggies to cut through the richness. I would have never expected them at a Cheesecake but im not complaining. Id skip the onion rings and the spinach artichoke dip they are kinda crappy. Get your fix at TGI's if you must. Cheesecake can be pretty expensive so take advantage of the happy hour you will thank me for it and get some extra tacos for lunch the next day they reheat perfectly somehow.
Meghan C.,"Arlington Heights, IL",93,37,,3.0,7/30/2012,"The review I posted previously may have been a duplicate...oh wait, that's just because my experience was just as bad as the last one. We came here because it is the 100th birthday for Cheesecake and all of their cheesecake was 50% off. Sweet Deal...pun intended. This time around I had the Fish tacos. I was feeling adventurous, because I've never had fish tacos and I'm not all that big on fish. But it was Cod, which I do like, so it was ok...and I mean just ok. McDonalds puts out a better piece of fish.  I did like the avocado and cilantro with tomatoes...I wish there were some pico do gallo or something. Anything to give it some more flavor.  We were kind of in a hurry and left in a rush and ordered cheesecake on our way out. We settled on Dulce something? it was a pretty plain caramel cheesecake. I liked it, but it's not my fav.  I have learned that the cheesecake factory is only a place you should go to get cheesecake...nothing else."
Britt C.,"Glendale Heights, IL",312,352,131,4.0,6/5/2012,"I pretty much eat appetizers and cheesecake here. Love their nachos, it's not a huge mound which is kind of sad, but they are really good. Each nacho is covered with cheese and all of the toppings, each one gets it's own jalapeno.  Avocado egg rolls. Pretty bomb. Perfect for a light snack. A little spicy, but if you like avocado I would think you'll like these.  Now for cheesecake, I used to ALWAYS order the Godiva cheesecake. It's super rich, but there are layers of different types of chocolate and it's just amazing. I think this is my ""classy"" option.  More recently I've tried Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple which not only has Reese's but it also has Butterfingers! Although this may not be as sophisticated as the Godiva, it's pretty stellar."
Phil S.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",133,250,109,3.0,2/29/2012,"I come to Cheesecake maybe twice a year when we're sick of everything else and we can't decide or disagree on what to eat.  The menu is literally a book and they cover most fatty food groups with an above average elegant touch consistently.   I've tried most of their pastas, sandwiches, specialties and appetizers over the years and have yet to be disappointed.  You may find this weird but I'm not much for sweets so I have only tried their cheesecake a grand total of once and that was dessert someone else had ordered.  They have plenty of seating at every location I've been to and the wait is short even at the busiest times which makes it an even easier decision to make when trying to figure out what to eat. Service at this location is hit or miss but I will say that the last time we went we had the most courteous and reserved waitress I've ever had. I wish I remembered her name.  She guessed what we wanted perfectly before we even ask over and over and delivered with a smile.  She wasn't all jabbery like some are in an attempt to get a big tip.  When I'm trying to eat I really don't care for all the jibber jabber waitstaff can sometimes spew with such practiced fakeness.  All I require is that you're there when I need you and you make an honest attempt to accommodate my requests. She did exactly that and with a genuine smile and I find it harder and harder to find this type of server these days. Hats off to you, lady."
Erick P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",41,210,5,4.0,5/10/2012,"I love the atmosphere here and how everything was dim lit, nice and cozy. The interior is really nice and I feel like I am in vegas for some reason. The food was great and the service was great!!! The only thing I didn't like was how close the tables were put together. You are literally like 6 inches away from the table next to you. Other than that, its all good!!!!"
Jay D.,"Schaumburg, IL",2,6,,3.0,12/14/2014,"Took my dad here for his birthday dinner on a Sunday night. Was seated immediately but day at a half booth, half table that was way too close to our neighbors. We heard everything they said and that heard everything we said. Was a little disappointed and wish I had asked to door somewhere else.. The servers wear all white and they looked a little dirty and sloppy to be honest. In a classy place like that I would expect the servers to look very clean and sharp.  I ordered the habachi steak and it was very good! It was served with mashed potatoes and two deep fried asparagus which were only there for garnish it seemed. I would've preferred a bigger serving of vegetable and not deep fried. My dad got some Jamaican jerk dish with shrimp and chicken. There was not enough meat at all and it wasn't all that great. We both got a slice of cheesecake. They do not offer a complimentary birthday dessert. My dad got a peanut butter, chocolate slice that was way to sweet for him and I believe it only had one tiny layer that was actually cheesecake. Mine was some coconut, chocolate cheesecake that was pretty good. Paid $80 including tip. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon."
Kyle H.,"Milwaukee, WI",897,1458,2714,4.0,11/22/2009,"While working in the John Hancock Tower for 14 months I never once visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Lower Level. Not once. I chalked it up to a chain that catered to the tourists stupid-enough to stop there. Then when I was out in Vegas a few years ago, I was the stupid tourist that stopped there, and loved it! Since I didn't have the ability to take leftovers home then, I ordered the 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich special. Perfect for a quick, non-filling lunch.  This Cheesecake Factory is attached to Woodfield Mall. Waits during peak eating and Holiday shopping times could be brutal, so stagger your lunches, people! Our wait at 1:30pm was less than 15 minutes. The chicken enchiladas were very good for a chain. The black beans were too ""smoky"", but the cilantro rice was unique and out of this world. Wash it all down with a Raspberry Lemonade or one of their Signature alcohol drinks.  Our server seemed busy, but she always checked in with us just at the right time! Be a tourist in Schaumburg!"
Sam M.,"Warrenville, IL",32,139,185,1.0,1/3/2015,"After waiting the 30 minutes to get a table, they sat us to an extremely tiny table packed in the middle of the large parties. We ask for a booth, she says sure, 5 minutes. 20 minutes later I sent my husband to ask if they forgot about us and they suddenly have a booth available (one of the 3 empty ones we passed the first time around)! We sat, and sat, and nothing. No waiter, nothing. Finally, about an hour and a half into this entire ordeal, we left. Sad, cuz I was really looking forward to their key lime. Bad, Cheesecake Factory, very disappointing."
Tara M.,"Palatine, IL",1,79,,3.0,8/16/2014,"It's a chain.  Everything standardized.  Last time I got some fried asparagus and it was perfectly cooked.  Other than that, the wait is too long, it's a trip to the (overcrowded) mall (yuck) and the food is usually just okay. The cost is a little high too. Except that asparagus was great.  We only go here when out of town guests show up because they seem to really like it.  I wouldn't brave the crowds just to go here unless I was trying to impress someone (with the name of the restaurant)."
K N.,"Chicago, IL",0,54,5,3.0,10/6/2014,Had lunch here to celebrate a birthday with my daughters.  Of course - we have to order cheesecake for dessert!    I was dumbfounded at the size served.  There is l/2 of what they used to serve but have no problem charging $7.95 for ONE piece??   That is outrageous..........  I have no clue what happened to their portions.   This was a huge disappointment!   (Ordered the Luau Salad??  Mangos were chopped up like ONIONS..  Diced so small you couldn't see them.)
Lorna S.,"Cook, IL",115,216,4,3.0,1/3/2012,"Huge selection of food and desserts; some say a little too huge. Some say it's sometimes difficult to decide what you're going to have because of all the choices. I, however, do not complain about too many choice's on people! Anyway, everything I've ever had at The Cheesecake Factory has been very good, and I have no complaints. I like that you can order 1/2 orders of food. This saves me from having to waste left overs in my fridge; I almost never eat left overs. The reason I didn't give this place more than 3 stars, is because their drinks are not strong enough. Everything tastes watered down, unless, of course, it's a straight shot of alcohol. To sum up...food good, drinks bad. That is all..."
Joe D.,"Wheaton, IL",0,6,,1.0,8/17/2014,"A group of four of us has just spent the day at the horse racing track. We were deciding what to have for dinner and we decided on Cheesecake Factory. Now it's a Saturday and as expected there was a wait so we walked around the mall to kill some time. An hour later we get sat. As you can imagine we were all fairly hungry and looking forward to a hearty dinner. Our server greets our table(Kim) and she seems less than excited to be working. We ordered drinks and two appetizers right away. She does inform us that the kitchen is backed up and food was coming out slowly.  Fifteen minutes later one of our two appetizers hits the table. Kim thought it was better to have one than none which was strange but we dealt with it. We place out entree order and continue to eat our now delivered second appetizer.  This is where the wheels begin to fall off. Our entrees begin to get delivered but not all at once. Two entrees show up and that's it. Three minutes later a third shows up. Finally our server comes over and apologizes that the fourth entree still isn't delivered. She explains that it will be up shortly. Two different people have stopped by and finally fifteen minutes later the fourth entree is delivered. At this point in extremely aggregated, our server sees this and sends over the manager Jesse.  Jesse comes by and does that annoying table knee and asks ""what going on folks? Sorry about the delay in your food.""  I explain that we intended to eat together. As to not be rude the entire table had waited for the last entree before we began to eat. As you can imagine the other entrees had become cold. Jesse decided that the most important thing to do was offer free cheesecake. I explain to Jesse that we haven't eaten yet and cheesecake was the last thing on our minds. I understand that the restaurant was busy but the manner in which the food was delivered was unacceptable. He agreed and promptly exited.  For whatever reason Kim(server) had become very standoffish.  She doesn't check back for quite awhile and when she does she offers cheesecake again.  We politely decline and ask for our check. We pay our check, and keep in mind, there was no compensation whatsoever.  As we are walking out I stop at the host stand and ask for the general managers information. The host feverishly looks for a business card. As we are patiently waiting, another manager(Kim) asks if she can do anything for us. I explain that we were just waiting for a business card for the GM because our experience was awful.  She looks surprised apologizes and immediately walks away.  Never again will I dine at Cheesecake Factory in Schaumburg and can't imagine that Cheesecake Factory will be top of mind on places to dine in the future."
Elisabeth A.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2013,"I have always loved going here and have always ordered the Chinese chicken salad which is one of my favorites (besides the Thai lettuce wraps). Tonight we waited a short twenty - thirty minutes for a table. My boyfriend and I were both hungry and debated whether we should continue to wait or not.... I have worked the industry for quite some years and have seen some pretty crazy things that customers find in their food. Never, I repeat NEVER have I ever found the cut off ""finger condom"" in my salad -- for those of you who don't know what that is it's when you cut your finger and have to wrap it to protect it from contamination --- yup, this was found in my salad underneath all the rice noodles piled high. The worst part is I found it after taking a bite of salad!!!  I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory -- I know mistakes happen but this one crossed the line for me. There have been other times where there were pieces of the deep fryer basket in my salad and I let it slide but this... This definitely ended it for me.  We should have just stuck with our gut and gone somewhere else instead."
D W.,"Montgomery, IL",0,70,,1.0,3/23/2014,"First timer with a gift card. I don't know what the food tastes like because they lost my order. Noticed something was wrong when tables on either side were served before us. I guess the waiter didn't, even though he seated us 20 mintes before. When some food actually arrived,  my son found hair, not a hair, in his pasta. Cold food on arrival for other 2. Other time consuming fun was had by all. I should just be happy we got out. So nice of the manager to comp my disappearing burger and the hairy pasta. Wow thanks. Suggestion: when you screw up 2 burgers, pasta, a club sandwich and 4 cokes, comp the whole meal. Admit you blew it and invite us to come another day and try again, especaially when the customer tells you it was the first time at your resturant. Great waste of a gift card."
Don Z.,"Bartlett, IL",63,169,50,3.0,8/22/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Woodfield Mall.  It is right at one of the main entrances.  Of course it shares the huge mall parking lot.  This often translates into having to park pretty far away because you are competing with the patrons of the entire mall for a spot. Also because of its location and it name brand recognition, it seems like this place is always busy.  I only come here for lunch, so I try to arrive before noon.  Never come on a Friday.  Everyone loves to go out for lunch on Fridays and you will be waiting forever! Once you get inside, the place is pretty large for a mall restaurant.  There is a hostess station just inside the door where they will take your name or prepare to seat you immediately depending on how busy it is.  There is a fair amount of room to wait.  There is also a bar to the left of the hostess station, but I have never sat there.  To the right is a display case of the cheesecakes to help you visualize the large variety that is available. When it is time to be seated you will be led towards the back of the restaurant.  The lighting is very dim... almost too dim.  Maybe I am not ready for that level of mood lighting when I am eating lunch with coworkers. The menu is huge with a ton of salad, pasta, and sandwich choices.  I have never ordered any of them.  Every time I go to Cheescake Factory I order the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes.  This item is on the appetizer section, but it is a hearty meal for one person.  They are a delicious mix of fried, seasoned corn meal, topped with avocado, sour cream, tomatoes, and a slightly spicy sauce.  They are a nice choice for vegetarians if that is a concern for you. Pro tip:  Do not let the server take your menu after ordering your lunch.  I always keep one so that I can ponder the cheesecake list.  If you don't heed my warning, you will be waiting a long time to get the menu back and then even longer for them the bring the cheesecake.  Sometimes I even order the cheesecake at the same time as my tamale cakes. This leads me to my review of the service.  Everyone generally seems friendly, but something is off.  I don't know if they are understaffed, or if the management has created barriers to efficiency that I don't understand.  I have been to this place on numerous occasions and the service always seems slow.  Early in the meal they are almost overbearing with the questions and the ""are you ready to order?"", especially when I go with someone that does not already know what they want like I do.  But after that you are lucky to ever see your server again. Getting back to food... the cheesecake is delicious.  I really like the key lime and the lemon raspberry.  I do have a few gripes.  It may be my imagination, but I believe the size of the slices got smaller over the years.  This wouldn't be all that bad (especially for my waistline), but the prices are steep with a slice going for $6 or $7.  I also wish they would use real whipped cream.  I like a cream counterpoint to the dense cheesecake, but the stuff they use is just as dense and based on the way it maintains its consistency, I suspect it is oil based.  Of course the durability is probably the reason they use it. Overall, I like eating lunch at The Cheesecake factory occasionally.  I don't love it, but I will be back.  I just wish they could fix the little things and I could rise above my middle of the road feelings."
Mari R.,"Arlington, TX",1,8,27,5.0,10/21/2012,I mean it is Cheesecake Factory...... Every time I come I always have a very nice time.
Erica L.,"Elgin, IL",1,8,1,3.0,11/23/2011,"Came here last Friday night for a friends 22nd birthday. The host told us it'd be a 20 minute wait. We waited almost 30, oh well. When we sat down, I ordered a frozen margarita, the birthday girl ordered a Mai tai, and our friend ordered a mojito. Why am I being so specific about the drinks? Well, they just weren't that great. Watered down. The mojito literally tasted like mint water. No bueno. The food was decent-I always get the chicken marsala with mushrooms. The chicken was a tad dry, but the marsala sauce...Delish. Ditto for the strawberry cheesecake. I don't know why people complain about the prices because the portions are so darn big. The only odd thing was our waitress...she was very nice and attentive, but she disappeared and another waiter came and told us she ""stepped out of the office"" and he would be takin care of us. Not sure what that means, but it took him a while to take our payment. I give him props though for jumping in when needed. Of course I'll come again, but maybe I'll get a draft beer instead of any mixed bar drink. Yay."
Michelle D.,"Troy, MI",54,48,62,4.0,12/30/2011,"Good ol' Cheesecake Factory. Been here tons of times...on dates, with family & friends, for brunch, lunch, dinner. For the Sunday brunch we usually get the Monte Cristo sandwich or French Toast Napoleon. Both are delish and the portion sizes are ginormous (this goes for everything on the menu - ideal for splitting). For lunch or dinner, I usually get a pasta or a chicken dish...pretty hard to get a bad tasting one. The Chicken Madeira & Marsala are amazing, as well as the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (just remembering what I've had recently). I've never tried the burgers, but I've heard that all of them are pretty good EXCEPT the factory burger (according to my husband, who is the complete opposite of picky). I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but supposedly their cheesecake is out of this world. And super rich. However, I do know that their hot chocolate is AMAZING. To sum it up, they basically  have a huge menu and pretty much everything is super delicious. Oh and their soups are yummy, their hot white/wheat breads are great starters, and they have an alright happy hour appetizer selection. Waiters are always nice and attentive and there is usually a wait, so I would make reservations. If you ignore the fact that their food is extremely high calorie, you'll like eating here. Plus they introduced a new ""SkinnyLicious"" menu...haven't tried anything on it though because we usually split."
Christopher S.,"Chicago, IL",492,55,1,3.0,9/15/2011,"I've never been a huge fan of this place. I grew up going to the one downtown...And I never felt like anything i got was particularly amazing....and venturing to the one out here in the burbs didn't change my attitude at all.  The architecture is amazing, the service is weak and the food is and has always been very hit or miss.  Some days it sucks, some days it's ""good"".. never spectacular (and it should be for what it costs).  I only go here if other people want to go... it doesn't help that I don't like cheese cake.... due to this I wound up getting their cake for desert and that in itself is all bark and no bite....by that I mean it looks delicious but tastes bland.  Again, I don't like cheese cake, so take my review with a grain of salt."
