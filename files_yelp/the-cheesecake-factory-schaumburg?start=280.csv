Melissa Z.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,1.0,1/21/2014,"If I could give this place no stars I would.  The service was crap,  I had to ask the waiter 3 times for water and twice for bread.  The food was mediocre, no extrodinary flavors, nothing exciting.  Then 24 hours later all four people in my party became sick.  We all live in separate households so it had to have been the food here that made us all sick in the exact same way.  Hours upon hours of vomiting and diarrhea is horrible and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  The only reason I ever go to this place is because it's a friend's birthday and she wants to go, needless to say we will NEVER be going here again."
Kensey W.,"Detroit, MI",95,482,19,2.0,11/5/2011,"so disappointing! i don't know what i was expecting but i had never been to a cheesecake factory before and it just looks so fun! well it wasn't. the menu was totally misleading! they had a farmhouse burger that was advertised as ""topped with pork belly."" when it came out, it was just bacon! okay okay, i know bacon is a subset of pork belly, but when pork belly is on the menu, i expect a thick slab of fatty meat that squirts a little when i bite into it and is a little squishy and coats my tongue in grease. none of this happened obviously. you suck, cheesecake factory! but the burger's credit, the egg on top was nice and runny, the burger was actually cooked medium, and the fries were pretty good. service was good too and i was just happy they were open late (until 12:30) because my friend and i got rejected from red robin, where they close at ten but would never mislead me. i am now forever boycotting cheesecake factory, but i think that will be easy to do."
Garrett A.,"Chicago, IL",10,69,,3.0,6/20/2011,"Ah, Cheesecake Factory.  The first three bites of their food is always really, really good.  But then after the eighth bite, you really start to hate yourself.  But you keep eating because there's so much of it, you know?  And somehow, an hour later, you find yourself waddling out with a doggy bag and a desperate need for pants that fit.  It's like a grown-up version of McDonald's.   I just looked it up -- my shrimp bistro pasta was a whopping 2,200 calories.  Thank God I shared it with my gf, she could use a few of those."
Nichole C.,"Itasca, IL",239,452,14,4.0,5/5/2013,"This place is completely overwhelming.  Seriously...parking, the size of the restaurant, the 65 page menu, the cheesecake options, the blinding dimness, the crowds, the service...just everything. The Cheesecake Factory is a great chain restaurant...I mean, they are obviously doing something right to have it always be on an hour wait (or more!).  It's just TOO MUCH.  The place is crazy all the time.  The food portions are gargantuan.  I can keep going but honestly?  Just know this is a place you should only venture out to and brave the crowds for if someone else requires it.  Otherwise, you have about a million different options to go to for similar items.  Yes, CF has their own things that no one else has...but they also have some things that everyone else has.  And the bonus of going to the other places is that you don't have so many options...I have a hard enough time choosing between six different burgers on a menu, but when you throw every ethnic cuisine at me on one menu?  I can't do it.  After (too) much deliberation, I ended up getting a really delicious wasabi crusted ahi tuna dish, but I also wanted a Mexican dish, a Thai dish, a Chinese dish, an American dish...like I said, it's just too much.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a great place for a group, but for a couple?  I'd skip it."
K T Y.,"Chicago, IL",0,101,1,4.0,1/18/2014,Reviewing this restaurant is like reviewing mcdonalds. Everyone by now has eaten here. Probably multiple times. I wanted to add that when my wife and I were there with our 1 year old for brunch the server did something awesomely unexpected. She brought my son a plate of bread and sliced bananas. This was perfect since he doesn't have the patience tk wait for his food. Nice touch and I was quite grateful.
Jo R.,"Westmont, IL",21,144,181,4.0,5/14/2013,"On numerous occasions, I have wanted to dine at this restaurant. I rarely do. Why? The Cheesecake Factory, regardless of location, is always packed. And I am trying to avoid spending my waning youth groveling for a table. Truly, I have sprouted gray hair waiting to be seated at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Well, this day was different and we decided to wait. My mother wanted to visit the Cheesecake Factory for her day, Mother's Day. We tried to make reservations but the restaurant does not accept them. So, we prepared to wait at least two hours to gain entrance. Upon arriving, we were told it would be a 90 minute wait. It turned out to be slightly less, about 70 minutes.  We were seated around 5:00 p.m. and ordered drinks immediately. I ordered the red raspberry martini which was good. It was not the best martini I have ever had, but I could tell it contained alcohol. The raspberry taste was strong and it came with lots of foam on top, which I like. Two types of warm bread were also served as we had our cocktails.  For my entree, I chose the chicken salad sandwich with the green salad. It came almost laser fast; I was truly amazed. The sandwich weighed about 50 pounds and may have contained a whole chicken family. It was a mayonnaise-based chicken salad with chicken chunks, roasted almonds, lettuce, and tomato. I liked it, but I think I would have preferred a less chunky texture. The best part of the sandwich was the grilled brioche bread. That made it special. The green salad was a nice option. I chose it instead of the French fries. There are many other items on the menu to choose from; it is quite overwhelming.  If you hope to try the cheesecake, I recommend ordering it first or to-go. I cannot imagine having room in my stomach for it after the meal. However, if your stomach is a bottomless pit, or you train for eating contests, perhaps you can handle it."
Melanie G.,"Glendale Heights, IL",0,3,,1.0,7/27/2015,"Went here for lunch today.  After waiting over 5 minutes to get a waitress for drinks, I ordered a salad and my husband ordered a sandwich.  After waiting 15 minutes I asked the waitress where our food was, she relied that things were going ""smoothly"" and it should be out in a few minutes.  After another 5 minutes she admitted something was wrong with the order and that the manager would be over to explain.  After 5 minutes the manager came over to say our food would be up in a few minutes, sorry for the wait.  No explanation.  I told her not to bother and left.  I wont be going back."
Jeka M.,"Chicago, IL",354,341,226,4.0,3/14/2010,"What can I say? Yes, you get copious amounts of whatever it is you order, and the menu is the size of a book because they cover just about any food style you could want. What's more, I've yet to find something they don't cook well there. The cheesecake is divine, though obviously mass-produced, as is the overly sweet whipped cream. It's usually super-crowded and the bar area is too small to have much of a chance to sit down and wait in. The service is quick, but to the point of being a little impersonal and actually making you feel a bit like they're just trying to flip the table. There's not much more to say... there are some down points, but the food is so varied, delicious, and abundant that... yay, I'm a fan?"
Jeremy L.,"Streamwood, IL",54,53,58,4.0,3/6/2012,I have been coming to this resto as far as I can remember! I love the food and service they are always attentive and friendly. Each time i come here I always try a different cheesecake!  Of course one of my favorite dish is the Bang Bang Spicy chicken! I hope that they will not take this off the menu!.
Thomas P.,"Libertyville, IL",225,16,,1.0,6/10/2014,"Food was okay, service was terrible. It took forever for refills and to obtain the check, no one was very helpful or respectful and I definitely won't be returning to this location after this experience. I've heard much better things than I've experienced."
Todd G.,"Elgin, IL",0,11,,2.0,7/18/2014,Service is slow and pretty bad. Food is good and portions are big. Love the shrimp bistro pasta and the crab cakes.
Josh D.,"Holland, MI",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2014,Only come for the dessert. The service was terrible. Waited forever to get drinks and our order in. Never asked how are food was.
Katy B.,"Milwaukee, WI",42,126,,1.0,4/15/2013,"This place is a joke, and a bad one. Who waits 2+ hours for mall food? Not this gal. Experience numero uno: last summer, stopped by to have lunch and was informed of a 2 hour wait for a table for two. No thanks. Some food is worth a 2 hour wait, and I am absolutely positive that that food does not come from The Cheesecake Factory. Second experience, this weekend: a group of 18, including folks visiting from out of town. The organizer called months in advance to make reservations and was informed reservations are not accepted. She was informed that our group of 18 should show up at 4 for a 6pm seating. While that would turn most away, we showed up dutifully at 4, and were told that they would not take our name so early, and that we should come back at 5. At 5, our group was told that there would be a 2-3 hour wait. Huh, what?  Upon calling the manager, a member of our group was told that it was ""not possible"" that we had been turned away at 4. Sarah (said manager) must have the ultimate faith in her employees, and perhaps she meant that it was not probable. This statement would still have been inappropriately condescending towards a potential customer, but may have still retained the possibility of being correct. Either way, it was not correct. We were there at 4, and we were turned away. So basically, to top off the in-restaurant seating debacle, the manager was not only of no help, she was unnecessarily rude. Customer service appears to be bottom of this chain's priority list. Guess what? Our group had an awesome night at Westwood Tavern. It is nearby, the food was delicious, and the drinks were great, too. Their servers and manager bent over backward to accommodate our group, and we had a fantastic night and great service. Quite a contrast from The Cheesecake Factory."
Danielle S.,"Schaumburg, IL",13,1305,73,4.0,8/26/2011,"I do love me some Cheesecake Factory. Their cheesecake is unbelievable. I also like their lemoncello cake - if you don't like cheesecake try this! Since it is in the Mall it can get very crowded and there are long waits. Service can also be slow. But, their food is worth the wait! They have a huge menu with huge portions, so you get your money's worth. They make some great drinks at the bar as well."
Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125,2.0,11/23/2011,"I came here in the evening around closing time just to get some desserts with some friends. I'm not a big fan of the place but thought we'd give it a try. The lighting is always really dark which I'm not a fan of (it puts me to sleep). The prices of their food are higher than most other places so I don't think it's a great value. They do have a large cocktail and beverage menu, but many of them don't have prices on them which is annoying. Their cheesecakes are overpriced (they taste a step above store bought cheesecakes) but I bet you can find specialized bakeries in the area that can do it for similar quality or better quality and less of a price. The food is average (stuff that I can make at home). HOOOWever, the service is good. They do come around and check on you a lot so I will give them a star for that. The place is always pretty packed and they are very caring of you when you are there. But other than the service, there's not much to look forward to."
Michele K.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,12,,4.0,10/15/2013,"Love this place! Food is delicious, always fresh and served hot! Our favorite is the Crusted Chicken Romano, but its enough to share (so theres room for, of course, Cheesecake!!) My husband is also a fan of the  Meatloaf, and tries valiantly each time to finish, so far, no can do. My son likes the breakfast for dinner concept, with omelette,.potatoes, etc.,.and my daughter,.who would eat pasta for breakfast,.loves the bowtie pasta with alfredo and grilled chicken. I've heard there are over 200 items on the menu, but have yet to count them, I'll take their word for it!. I would like them to do call ahead seating, cuz the wait is the worst part. I understand they are about to add more seating, so that's a plus. If you haven't been there yet, what are you waiting for?"
Ling L.,"Arlington Heights, IL",110,258,254,4.0,6/27/2011,"With its assortment of cheesecake, which would you plop down a whopping $6 for? Let's put it this way: you'll never, ever be crossed off my list if you bring by a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake -- slice or 10-inch. Friend for life if it's the 10""."
Nicholas P.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",17,35,7,4.0,5/20/2014,"They are often full, so expect a wait. The service is fair. Some servers ATF better than others. The food is good, but I'm not a fan of the cheese cake. I prefer Eli's any day. It's worth a visit for the food. Try the burrito grande or ahi tuna."
Vishal S.,"Alpharetta, GA",36,33,,1.0,3/1/2014,"If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory, then you can come here, otherwise don't bother."
Lindsay K.,"Streamwood, IL",66,22,2,5.0,9/14/2013,I love this restaurant! Amazing food and the staff is always courteous. Great waiters and great atmosphere. Tamale Cakes are the best!
