Tony G.,"Battle Creek, MI",57,45,119,2.0,7/11/2013,"Went there for dinner last night, after the two hour wait I must say that I was disappointed.  I expected to wait.... It's the Cheesecake Factory after all.  But after all the hype, the food was just so so.  Service was good, our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  We ordered an appetizer , which was pretty good, but then my wife and I got our pasta dish and not very impressed.  The pasta was undercooked and the sauce was runny with not much flavor.  The cheesecake which is no surprise was very tasty.  But after a two hour wait and a $116.00 bill for a very moderate order, I expected more I guess."
Cornelius J.,"Chicago, IL",39,33,8,1.0,9/7/2011,"On labor day, a little after the lunch hour, I took my wife on a date here.  We have been here several times and the food has always been great. There were a lot of people in the restaurant, so we waited until about 1PM ish to have lunch. We got seated right away near the bar; however, we almost sat there for five minutes before I had to ask for our waiter.  We ordered an appetizer and waiting almost 20 minutes for that. Then, our food was brought out. I usually get the same thing, but this time it was horrible. The food tasted like it had been under a warmer for quite sometime.  The rice was dried out and the baja tacos didn't taste good. The location in Skokie and downtown does a much much better job. We left I will attend another location and never come back to this one."
Rita B.,"Schaumburg, IL",22,150,31,4.0,2/17/2012,"Didn't have a taste for anything but was very hungry. Date night with hubby ended up at Cheesecake Factory. What an awesome choice. I cannot tell you how much I like this place.  Sometimes it's hit or miss. Tonight was a total HIT. Our server, Laura, was so sweet and attentive. She made sure our drinks were always topped off.  Tried the Bang-Bang Spicy Chicken and Shrimp dish. I was worried that it would be too spicy but honestly, it had no kick to it. That was perfect because I didn't want too much heat but the dish just sounded good.  Hubby had the New Orleans Shrimp and something dish. Again, that too was good.  Tons of leftovers since these portions are the size of a tiny baby. Ordered cheesecake to go because not one more bite food could be consumed tonight.  Looking at our dishes, it hardly looks like we even made a dent in them.  Good food, great cheesecakes, awesome service. Only problem was the heat was on blast. Even after several customers complained management could not control the temperature. Needless to say, we had to high tail it out of there. There is only so much heat a person can handle."
Haley G.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,6,1,4.0,6/6/2015,"Decided to go here for lunch yesterday and I was extremely satisfied with the food. It was amazing, as always.  The ONLY reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because of our waitress, Tiffany. We sat in the bar and there were not a lot of people in there so it was a nice area. She comes to the table with a very rude ""what can I get you guys to drink?"" The tone in her voice was enough for me to be able to tell she did not want to serve us/be there. Didn't even tell us her name. She comes back almost 10 mins later with our drinks. We order our appetizer, she asks us if we're ready to order our entrees and we ask for a little more time. She sighs as she basically runs away after that, then doesn't come back for probably another 15 mins. She basically had an attitude the whole time we were there. I'm a server and this is not the way to take care of a table, especially when your trying to get a tip. I would think Cheesecake Factory would have higher standards for their servers. The only reason I even got her name was because it was on the receipt.  On to the food, we got the tex mex eggrolls as our appetizer and they were delicious, especially the avocado sauce that comes on the side. I got the pasta carbonara which was the best pasta I think I've ever had honestly. And my friend got the chicken madeira which was also very good. Then we got the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake and the carrot cake cheesecake and they were both amazing.  Of course I will come back, hopefully I will get a server who actually cares about their job or at least their tip so I can feel welcomed there because it really does help the experience."
Kris L.,"Elmhurst, IL",8,185,47,3.0,2/8/2012,"Menu and portions are HUGE, food and service are average, cheesecakes are excellent.  My friend and I actually started with a bowl of their ""cream of chicken soup"".  Both of us were expecting the Greek version but received a chowder instead and were disappointed.  It's an ok place to stop for lunch while shopping at Woodfield but other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."
Jun K.,"Roselle, IL",40,111,62,4.0,4/8/2013,"Who goes to the Cheesecake Factory and doesn't order Cheesecake? This guy.  Honestly, I think I've been here over a dozen times and maybe ordered some once.  Only because the servings here are enough to keep you full that desert just doesn't seem like an option. Food here is always pretty good, as well as the service.  We went yesterday with a group of six and were sat in a round booth at the front where maybe at most, five people could've sat comfortably.  Since u front, it was a little noisy but that didn't really matter since we weren't the quietest group. Sunday brunch, just sat in time to still have the option to order from it.  Bruleed (i suck at using the accented letters) French Toast.  Two large pieces of soft, fluffy bread with  powdered sugar and two strawberry halves.  Presentation-9 Taste-8 Value-8.  Still, good french toast!  On to the jambalaya! Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya, I must order this 90% of the time I go there, this and the Beef Ribs which they unfortunately removed from the menu.  Can't go wrong with this meaty pasta dish.  Also had a strawberry lemonade which was delicious and refillable, but for $4.50 maybe i'll stick to water and take desert to go.  Place is always busy during peak times, especially on the weekends.  I'm not too sure they take reservations since we never try but it may be a first come first serve basis.  Hence the waiting area always being packed.  Anyways, 100% sure I'll be back. Ah, one thing that does suck is that these restaurants are in shopping malls which makes parking a B!  Just drop off people and go find a spot, hopefully by the time you get inside, you'll have a table ready."
Moeed K.,"Chicago, IL",27,66,28,3.0,6/15/2013,"This place was alright.  They didn't go out of the way to exceed expectations, so it was just a normal restaurant visit.  The wait times are usually pretty long, since woodfield doesn't have a food court, everyone flocks to the restaurants.  Anyhow, the food was not bad, and the service was prompt.  In terms of cleanliness, the silverware was crusted with leftovers from the prior customer for both my wife and I.  I probably will never go back here, unless I am grabbing a cheesecake to go.  If you don't know already, the cheesecakes at ""The CHEESECAKE Factory"" are not the best, but good."
Emily T.,"Saint Louis, MO",36,233,7,4.0,8/23/2013,"Standard issue Cheesecake Factory. After a short wait, we were seated on the ""mall side"" where you can look out the window into the interior of Woodfield Mall. My dining companions and I all partook of the salad menu, and I had the French Country Salad (noted as an ""appetizer salad,"" which I think means that the portion may actually be reasonable for one sitting). The salad was surprisingly huge, with lots of well-chopped greens in a yummy vinaigrette as well as just enough candied pecans, beets, goat cheese, and asparagus. All in all, very tasty! Friendly service, a pleasant interior design, and the brown bread up front is always a nice treat. The Cheesecake Factory chain could do with some serious menu downsizing and portion downsizing, but other than that, we're typically pleased by food quality. This location did not disappoint."
Tracy L.,"Carol Stream, IL",585,107,86,2.0,5/29/2011,"I love my cheesecake factories...but this is by far the worst I've been too. Pick a different location. For real.  We waited over an hour for our food. The bf didn't get any silverware even though he asked for it...and his silverware came like 10 minutes after his dinner arrived. WOW. I ordered a dish, they messed it up because they burnt my food, and served it to me that way. Uh-no. I kindly asked them to take it back, expecting them to at least offer something in return like a gift card or dessert? They asked me if I wanted to make another order...I told them I wasn't willing to wait another hour for my food. The manager even came by the table, but didn't improve the situation at all. POOR SERVICE. The only thing saving my rating from being 1 star is that I truly do love going to cheesecake factory But that really sucked."
Joe P.,"Tampa, FL",103,245,216,4.0,7/26/2013,"Service was great, food was pretty good.  I had the fish tacos and they were pretty tasty, but I would have preferred them to be more spicy!  We had to wait for about 30 minutes on a Friday which wasn't too bad.  We will definitely be back!"
Tony B.,"Chicago, IL",3,42,15,2.0,1/12/2014,"Always so so. The good thing about this place is the atmosphere. The food is average, always. More flavor in a Big Mac..."
Alex P.,"Roscoe, IL",2,7,,1.0,8/17/2014,"My girlfriend and I decided to stop here for a nice dinner, but were we wrong.  To start we waited about 15 minutes after being seated with no server in sight. After we stop a busboy to ask who our server is he proceeds to take our order (which was extremely nice of him). He brings us our drinks and a waitress approaches us and let's is know she isn't out waitress but she will find our correct server. The food arrives, even though we have no idea who our server is at this point. A manager approaches us and wants to know if there is a problem we voice our concern and he acknowledges it and finds our waiter. Once we are finished eating our waiter comes over with the check and tells us ""it's a big place my bad"". I proceed and let him know he will not be receiving any sort of tip considering he really didn't do anything and I would be tipping the bus boy. Needless to say we will never be returning to this establishment."
Jennifer C.,"Maple Grove, MN",208,483,44,2.0,5/2/2011,"Not as good as most Cheesecake Factories.  Although this is the closest one to where I live it is my least favorite.  Last time we went in we went in for the happy hour food specials.  We got the chicken sliders (which weren't nearly as good as usual and the buns were totally squished), the fried macaroni and cheese (which was actually quite good), and the onion rings which were a disaster.  The onion rings arrived looking anorexic (not their normal golden brown) and the onion on the inside was raw.  We sent them back and were not charged. Additionally, our waiter was very hard to track down when we had a problem with the onion rings and needed drink refills.  I may go back in awhile because its so convenient, but I will definitely not be in any hurry."
Nicole L.,"Glendale Heights, IL",29,616,566,4.0,11/13/2011,"Plenty to choose from which is particularly great for groups. I had the chicken marcel blanc which was very good. And the cheesecake, no matter the flavor, is awesome. Visited: October 31, 2011"
Mike A.,"Itasca, IL",3,18,15,5.0,1/31/2014,"What can I saw about the cheesecake Factory .... that I know it's a chain but it is ahhh-maazing!!! For my 19th birthday I went here with a couple of girlfriends and I was so impressed the restaurant was jam-packed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated ( they don't allow reservations). I ordered the Chinese dragon or something like that it was perfectly seasoned.... but the portions were so huge! I was the only one to be able to finish all my food, the rest of the girls had to take it home. After words we of course got cheesecake and I got a complimentary slice for my birthday, of course. The only bad part the cheesecake was really hard but if you let it sit in the fridge to thaw out it is GOLDEN! I love this place and I hope I can come back some time soon."
Kathy K.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,19,12,1.0,1/4/2014,The service was not bad but the raspberry lemon cheesecake was horrible!!! My dad ordered tiramisu and he got sick! I tried the same cake in old orchard mall Illinois at it was soo much better! Don't even try to go to the Cheesecake Factory by woodfield mall. That's just a waste of money!!!
Amanda S.,"Saint Charles, IL",124,331,107,4.0,9/19/2012,"Every time I go to Cheesecake Factory, I get the same thing...miso salmon (sub brown rice)..and it's delicious and enough for two meals.  Always cooked to perfection and perfectly presented, I really have no complaints.  Last time I was super starving and ordered the Greek salad off the small plates menu to start off, and the salad was HUGE for being a ""small"" portion.  The salad was piled high with feta, tomatoes, cucumbers etc...I loved every morsel of it.   Another great thing ab CCF is that they bring you this delicious brown bread (and white, but who cares about that), that is so tasty, soft and warm.  I definitely look forward to that every time. One downside to this restaurant is that it's in Woodfield.  Unlike the Oak Brook location where it's a separate building, this is attached to the mall, which makes parking suck!  We had to park pretty far which is fine when the weather is nice...or you're not stuffed to the brim with their delectable menu items.  It's a solid place where there really does seem to be something for everyone, portions are huge, and the staff is attentive and reasonably knowledgeable considering the huge scope of their menu!  They also have a large drink menu that includes spiked milkshakes and tropical selections as well."
Arlene G.,"Oak Park, IL",93,905,,5.0,7/17/2013,ive been here several times so i cant believe ive never written a review 4 this place! amazing food in huge portions so u cant beat dat! there wer 7people in our party & we all loved the different entrees we ordered. service was pretty good 2! i never get disappointed from eatin here so will keep coming back!
Christine U.,"Bloomingdale, IL",17,29,7,4.0,11/23/2013,"Be prepared to wait, but it's all worth it! I ordered the lunch size BBQ chicken ranch salad! It was huge! Even for a lunch portion. For dessert got the pumpkin cheesecake... Delicious!!!"
Jared B.,"South Bend, IN",2,16,1,5.0,4/10/2011,"All of the food is great! For their new appetizer of shrimp just got a lot better! The cheese cake is good, the food is good, and the waiter is nice. All of it is great! Good for parties and good for b-days are most likely better for the food. For waits are just an hour which is good your in a mall get to chat a little before the buzzer goes off. For the money is just $100 dollers if you want more people will be more money 2x. If you like beer and wine or parties and b-days then this is just right to go in this place!"
