Andy M.,"Chicago, IL",3,44,71,5.0,9/2/2013,"Never have had a bad experience at this place. Food has always been on target and service is pretty solid given this location is always busy. Wait time was quoted correctly and our server, Charlene, was immensely helpful and attentive throughout the meal. Avocado eggrolls is always a must-have app! It's loaded with avocados, not overly fried, and paired with the most amazing tamarind cashew dipping sauce. I need to learn the recipe! Crusted chicken Romano, almost exactly like chicken parmigiana. Could've used a bit more sauce, but all the flavor was still there. Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and cheesy as always, a family favorite my mom always orders to cheat on her diet with. Finished it off by ordering the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamian Cheesecake and the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake. Both were amazing, as to be expected from THE Cheesecake Factory. Atmosphere is relaxing yet classy, love the intimate orange glow the decor seems to give off, and spacious four-seater booths. Love this chain!"
Mark F.,"Gurnee, IL",177,328,16,2.0,9/7/2010,"The only positive to any Cheesecake factory are portion sizes. One meal could feed 2, maybe 3. Club sandwich? Sure, we make it out of an entire loaf of bread. Everything's overpriced.  The menu is 8,432 pages long. I don't see the appeal.  The last adventure here provided some of the worst service I've ever encountered.  Our server came back with all but 1 order being incorrect and showed little care other than looking at us blankly and saying, ""oh. oooh yeah,"" to inflect that he forgot to ring it up the way we asked. Everything took forever.  Like other mystifying chain restaurants, this place is always packed and I'll never understand why. Aside from the cheesecake (meh) there isn't much you come back for. ""Remember that one thing I had? I think it was on page 34 subsection 4c.""  Schaumburg is chalked full of delicious places to eat. And if you must go chain, maybe stop here for dessert but even that's a big maybe."
K N.,"Saint Charles, IL",10,26,,4.0,3/12/2011,"I find it funny that the majority of bad reviews come from people that don't have time to wait for their server at a restaurant that is KNOWN for BEING BUSY. I would think anyone going here as an option for a quick lunch break or fast dinner is being absurd. CF is always busy. I've never been to one when it's not busy. I've been to the Woodfield one several times over the past 5 years, and yes, it is pricy, but no more pricy than any other CF. Oakbrook is the same. Always busy and always pricy. I happen to think that their food is great! Maybe it depends on what you order. I like the fish tacos and their Lentil soup is great. Their desserts are really good too. I read one review that said their strawberry shortcake was more of a punishment than a dessert. I have had their strawberry shortcake at this specific CF and I loved it.  Why the 4 stars? I don't like that everything is so overpriced. A dessert should not exceed $6. That's a little ridiculous. That's almost a gallon and a half of gas right now. Thank you very much."
Sinjun1717 M.,"Fort Collins, CO",8,64,3,2.0,11/4/2013,"First off I used to LOVE this place but it has gone down hill! In the past i would go out of my way or try and talk everyone into going to the Cheesecake factory just to enjoy their orange chicken. Now I would rather save my money and go to panda express or make it at home because this stuff taste like they just pulled it out of a microwave. you used to get a bowl of rice and this super yummy orange glazed chicken that had a crunch to it, now you get soggy chicken with little to no sauce and a scoop of rice. I was so disgusted i didn't even have the heart to order cheesecake and apologized to my family for bringing them their."
Mar R.,"Des Plaines, IL",14,7,,3.0,12/15/2013,Big portion of food and food is good but service is not the greatest we were told the wait is 10 min and we had to wait 30+ min .. Another 10 min to be seated .. They sat us in a table near the bar and by the door when we asked to switch the told us we have to wait another 10 min.. The table next to us got bread before we did.. We asked the waiter for bread he said someone stole his bread basket lol!!
Mike O.,"Austin, TX",5,33,,1.0,11/26/2014,Really disappointed! Used to love cheesecake factory and would always get the classic burger but the last few times I've tried them I've sent them back because they leave it sitting in the window long enough to get the lettuce and tomato hot. Why pay premium prices for fast food quality? Sorry cheesecake factory I've given you enough opportunities to get it together.
Emily M.,"Bonfield, IL",20,10,,2.0,3/3/2014,"Horrible food I mean you are called the Cheesecake Factory the least you can do is know how to make a good cheesecake. The staff is far from friendly we get it you don't like your job, just don't take it out on us.  The only way I will go back their is if I'm dragged by my hair kicking and screaming"
Brent W.,"Chicago, IL",96,953,834,3.0,1/11/2011,"Client chosen lunch destination last week and I guess we know the drill when it comes to CF;  endless choices, gigantic portions and a few safe bets.  I went with the Thai Noodle Salad and it was pretty tasty with a ton of ingredients thrown in the mix making for a nice balance of sweet/acidity/spicy...the spicy citrus-peanut dressing had a solid kick to it and rounded the dish out well.   It's actually listed under the appetizer salad but I still ended up taking some home, proving once again, that the CF is all about ott portion size."
Mimi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,224,17,2.0,6/12/2010,"Dammit, I keep going here because it's just so convenient but I really don't ever like the food here. I think the best thing I've had here was the miso salmon but just about everything else was blah and over-priced. The service is always good though it can get crowded on weekends.  Oh and the strawberry shortcake seemed like a punishment, not a dessert."
Travis O.,"Riverside, IL",48,8,2,1.0,7/31/2013,"Had the Navajo sandwich it wasn't very good. The chicken was over cooked. The fries were worse. Told the waiter, he told me he would bring my check."
Christopher V.,"Villa Park, IL",295,2,14,3.0,7/23/2013,"Pretty standard fare, large portions.  The Miso Salmon and the spicy Jambalaya pasta are winners.  Also they do have lunch portions which are more reasonable in size."
Hoang L.,"Chicago, IL",158,259,116,4.0,12/3/2010,"When I think of Cheesecake Factory, I think of a high class Denny's or iHop. They have almost anything you can think of. Service is attentive. The booths are really nice and private. Portions are huge. I'd come back again if I shopped at Woodfield. However, it's not good enough for me to make a trip to the burbs."
Annalise P.,"Schaumburg, IL",9,5,,5.0,9/23/2013,"I absolutely love it here and the server we had was excellent! His name is Euricka! Ask for him, you'll be happy you did. He knows his stuff and is super friendly!!! I won't ask for another server now that over had him!"
Megan T.,"Barrington, IL",72,262,152,2.0,5/15/2010,"This  is a below average restaurant.  I just cannot see what all they hype is.  Its a chain restaurant completley commercialized rushing you to order and turn the table.  If you sit at a banquet (half booth half chair table)  you are cramed next to a zillion other tables.  Getting out to go to the bathroom....  forget it.  The servers even have a hard time putting drinks and food down at the tables.  We orderd two drinks one pom. margarita and one blue moon, we also ordered the crispy fried cheese and the crab and cream cheese app  similar to crab rangoon.  The fried cheese came and there was no cheese just fried outside on half of the order.  We showed the waitress and she corrected, but the crab rangoon similar appitizer was not very good.  We then just decided to get a slice of cheesecake and be on our way.   I have been here on several occasions and at different times of the day and am never impressed.  For two drinks, a appitizer and a small tapas size appitizer and one slice of cheesecake the bill came to $42.00.  I am just not impressed.  The food is nothing to write home about and even though they have a ton of different flavors to pick of cheescake, my husband and I both thought the cheesecake we bought from Sam's Club the previous weekend was better than what we had here.  If you are at Woodfield and are looking for a good restaurant try Stir Crazy,  the food is much better."
Emily E.,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,14,,4.0,12/1/2013,Cheesecake Factory is always a great choice for lunch. Especially the pizza and salad lunch special. I was a little disappointed in that the house salad has less veggies than last time. Other than that it was good as usual.
Carm B.,"Chicago, IL",38,334,41,4.0,7/28/2012,"I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory and I have eaten at this location a few times.  The food is always very good and just like everyone says, very large portions. I like to get a few different appetizers or small plates to share.  My favorites are Tex Mex Eggrolls, Spring Rolls, and the Chicken Chopped Salad.  I also had the Clam Chowder on the last visit and it was fantastic.  I have honestly not eaten anything at TCF that I did not like.  The service is always very good.  The restaurant is so large and so busy so don't expect a quiet, slow paced meal and do expect a wait for a table.  It is a very popular place.  Of course the cheesecake is good, not the best I've ever had but definitely good.  My favorite is the pumpkin, but it is seasonal (I don't know why, because it is so popular).  I would recommend if you are in the area."
Nichole W.,"Arlington Heights, IL",14,85,28,3.0,3/4/2013,"The food was just ok, nothing too special. I would recommend the Vietnamese Tacos for a small plate option. It had great heat and flavor. Our service was not too bad. We waited over 10 minutes for the check and that's why it gets the 3 star rating."
Tamika R.,"Chicago, IL",162,5,,5.0,11/4/2012,I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. If the line is long stand by the bar area and you can snag a seat earlier. Ask about the specials that aren't on the menu. I had the Catfish crusted pecan meal. It was so good. I recommend this dish if you want to eat something light. it comes with mash potatoes and veggie medley. you can substitute if you like also. The waiter Damengo was great and attentive.
Christian M.,"Des Plaines, IL",130,165,422,2.0,8/6/2012,"Loud, dark and OK food. Not a fan, I have had better experiences. If you have to eat here, then I would suggest the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish. Otherwise avoid this overpriced and ""meh"" quality restaurant."
Amanda C.,"Peoria, IL",37,11,,4.0,10/24/2010,"While it is not my favorite place to eat ever, the hubby and I usually make a stop here when we visit Woodfield for the rare weekend Walmart lets their assistant managers have off. He sold his soul to Walmart before he could sell it to chain restaurants, so we're impartial to that aspect of it. Bottom line, the menu is huge, but I don't see that as a downside. I usually come close to finishing the grilled chicken tostada salad (which I make diet-friendly by not getting the tostadas, avocado cream, sour cream and subbing the low cal mustard vinaigrette for the regular vinaigrette) after a long day of shopping. I didn't think $13.95 was a terrible price for a salad piled high with fresh greens, fantastic chicken, corn, and black beans. My better half tries something different every time, and he got the blackened Jamaican chicken and shrimp last night. He was thoroughly pleased with his meal, so I'm not sure where the bad rap comes from. We had fantastic service, and the tab was reasonable given the copious amounts of booze we had with our meal. We came back to the takeout counter later to get a piece of cheesecake to share back at the hotel room, and all was well with the world. We got the seasonal Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake with chocolate fudge cake, and it was so-so. The peanut butter cup fudge ripple will forever remain my favorite. Take it for what it is, and don't expect it to be the most spectacular meal ever."
