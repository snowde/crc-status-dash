Alison G.,"Chicago, IL",131,138,440,4.0,1/16/2011,"There's not many choice for dessert in Chicago, so after all I became a fan of Cheesecake Factory too OMG@). My favorites are Tiramisu and Banana Cheesecake. Not the best cakes I've had in my life but so far I think CF has done a great job. It's already a habit to make a to go order or sit with friend enjoying a cake every other week. Besides that they do serve a large lunch and dinner menu with a list of great food. i always order pasta for myself. It's a bit noisy people there seems having tons of fun all the time, but despite the noises it is also a nice place for gathering with friends. They do have a full bar to serve alcohol drinks and there are LCD TV hanging on the ceiling if you want a place for sports and beers."
Jeanette M.,"Bensenville, IL",123,18,1,5.0,7/24/2012,"Ummm...where do I start, LOVE IT!!! Has great appetizers and an all around large variety of items for everyone. My fave are the Thai Lettuce Wraps and the Avocado Eggrolls, for the main course I normally go with the Baja Chicken Tacos. But everything is just so darn good, it would take over a year just to fully eat everything on the menu. I was however disappointed  during a visit they ran out of another fave of mine, the pumpkin cheesecake...I was craving it so bad and they no longer had any (seasonal item)."
Kammie G.,"Chicago, IL",76,144,25,3.0,12/27/2010,"The restaurant is locate in Woodfield mall, so the location is nice. We went there yesterday, so there was a wait of 45 min for our party of 8. We decided to walk around the mall until the time came.  We got a large booth in the corner. Our waiter was annoying. He talked down to us, I felt like he was treating me like I'm retarded. He kept trying to make weird funny remarks that were really just strange.  It was my first time eating in this restaurant. I've been here before but it was a long time ago so I don't remember it, plus I've never had the cheesecake from here so I was excited to try it.  The food: Stuffed mushrooms- really good! Six little mushrooms an definitely worth it for the small price of almost $5.  White pizza - could be bigger since it was $12. It tasted kind of bland.  Cheesecakes: White chocolate macademia nut- that's the one I got. Thought it was good at first but when I was almost done I realized how overly sweet it was. It was just okay.  Oreo cheesecake- not a fan. I don't like Oreo either though so that might be why.  White raspberry truffle - too sweet. Tasted good but just a bit too sweet.  Tiramisu cheesecake - wish I got that one! Super good!"
Mary S.,"Mt Prospect, IL",0,2,,4.0,6/21/2012,Being new to the area while shopping I came across this restaurant and decided to try it out. Went during lunch on a sat so we had to wait about 20 minutes - no big deal.  When sat we ordered 2 of their Strawberry Martinis - TO DIE FOR! Had the chicken salad sandwich - it was very good - portions are a tad large so brought the rest home - staff very nice and knowledgable - enjoyed everything - no complaints - will definitely return. Oh and of course try their cheesecake -i had their Red Velvet - Sinfully Delicious :)
Jamie J.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",0,24,,3.0,5/29/2012,First visit .  Found food good.  Mac&Cheese has different flavor and mac too el dente. Just be careful with doggie bag.  Checked mine next day and no potato or veggie just the left over chicken.  Not a happy camper since I paid for the whole meal.
Reyna M.,"Des Plaines, IL",9,79,23,1.0,7/15/2012,"Terrible, just ordered the Thai  lettuce wraps & the chicken was hanging off  the plate touching the waiters sleeve. When I touched the chicken it was cold and looked like it was chewed up by a previous customer.. Totally disgusting.. I also advised the waitstaff that I had a fork and  something slippery under my table & they never bothered cleaning it up.. I'll stick to the Old Orchard location"
Janaynay N.,"Glendale Heights, IL",82,40,49,2.0,4/21/2010,"FOOD IS ALWAYS GREAT. SERVICE SUCK MUCHO. I went to this cheesecake factory for my Bday and the whole staff including the duchebag manager gave bad service. First, I tried to reserve a table for at least 20 ppl on my bday a day ahead of time. The manager said okay. The next day when I showed up an hr early like the manager said...he said that I had to wait for an hr til they have a table ready. I did not really mind this. So we waited and went around the mall. The dumb waitress did not mention when we were going around the mall that the vibrator thing (the one that tells you that your food is ready or table is ready) can only go so far.  Anyways, once our table was ready, the manager and staff seated us. After only a few minutes of being seated, the manager comes up to us and tells me that ""if 80% of your party does not show up within  a few minutes, then I have to give up these seats to other people"". THIS PISSED ME OFF! WTeff? where was that in their policy!?!! First of all, if that duchebag can count, we were pretty much 80% of the party. A few people arrived kind of late and the manager wanted to kick us out bc he did not think 80% of the party was present. So since the people that did not arrive yet, we had to give up some of their seats to make this duchebag happy. But i pretty much argued with him that most of the party was here and that you don't tell a party about this stupid policy... He could of lost customers but he pretty much just kept his mouth shut about kicking us out. yeahhh. what now.  Food- we had to wait at least an hr for all of our food to be READY! OMGAH i was birthday girl and they got my ORDER WRONG!!! more bad service... ON TOP OF IT ALL...THEY SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE WRONG PERSON.  WOW. GOOD JOB CHEESECAKE FACTORY. FAIL AT SERVICE. THEY NEED A NEW MANAGER AND SMART WAITERS (INSTEAD OF THE ONES THAT HAVE THE LOOKS AND NOT HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO WAITER)"
Frances J.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",14,6,3,4.0,5/10/2012,My husband and I love this place!! The food is awesome. It's a little pricey but you definitely get your money's worth. All of the meals are large enough to split between 2 people. The service is always great too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because there is always a 45 minute wait (at least) when we go.... Understandable for such a popular restaurant though. We will continue to go here! Great place to take people who are visiting from out of town! I also love that it is attached to Woodfield Mall!
Jennifer C.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,4,2,4.0,2/10/2012,"The reason for four stars is the amount of care and understanding the manager showed us. Also, the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes: PHENOMENAL!!! :D They were so delicious I wished I had ordered two! (but of course, I was anticipating the gigantic dinner portions Cheesecake Factory is known for.) My family and I went in for dinner: Dad chose the ""Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta"", Mom chose ""Evelyn's Pasta"", and I...well I wanted some all-american style meatloaf. So I went with the ""Famous Factory Meatloaf"" My only complaint is that they had not described the meatloaf's flavor or use of spices in that dish at all--therefore, I was expecting a completely different taste from it. When I took the first bite of the meatloaf there was a very very very strong taste/smell of some type of herb. I wasn't prepared for this kind of twist in flavoring of the traditional meatloaf. On the menu, all it said was ""FAMOUS FACTORY MEATLOAF: served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn succotash"". Absolutely no mention of the strong use of that one herb I don't even want to know the name of. Since I didn't want to spend my dinner eating mashed potatoes and corn, I alerted the waiter (Ryan R.) who immediately offered to switch entrees. He could definitely tell I was not satisfied, and took my alternative order for the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken. A couple minutes later, the manager (didn't introduce his name) came to our table with a complimentary house salad with strawberry vinaigrette. He apologized for the inconvenience and informed us that he placed my order at the topmost priority and will be served as quickly as possible. The food was decent, not out-of-this-world incredible, but because of the service I received, I will be coming back. Good service is indispensable. Thank you, Ryan R. and management!"
Kasia S.,"Roselle, IL",0,13,2,1.0,7/6/2012,"We were told we will be sited in 10 minutes, well more like 20... We waited a long time for our orders, when they finally came, my husband's turkey burger was burned and my fish tacos were tasteless:( We did not even try any of the cheesecakes after the dinner experience. It was our first and last time there. Horrible food, bleh:("
John W.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,5.0,12/6/2011,"The Cheese Cake Factory has won the Stealth Chef Restaurant of the Year Recommendation. I highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory to anyone who has not dined there. They have met or exceeded my expectations for menu selection, ambiance, service, food and beverage quality, sanitation, seating comfort, lighting, sound and overall dining experience."
David G.,"Chicago, IL",200,261,,3.0,10/5/2009,"The menu is huge and diverse, but I never thought the food was that great. The last time I was here I ordered pasta with basil and tomato and it was undercooked and it was too oily. But why even care about the food when the place is called The *Cheesecake* Factory?  I love cheesecake, and The Cheesecake Factory has at least thirty different types (I didn't even count). For some reason I always manage to come here in the fall, and I get the pumpkin cheesecake. It wasn't in season for another 24 hours (I guess pumpkin season starts October 1st) so I ended up getting the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake. It was so good I polished off the entire plate with little help. I love the fresh whipped cream they top it with. I've only sampled 3 or 4 of the different types of cheesecake and all were pretty good. One mark against this place is the service. It's always slow, and the last time they messed up the order. There were five of us, and the food came in 3 different waves, so at some points we just kind of awkwardly watched each other eat.  They only way I will go back for actual food is if I was invited, but I will always come back for dessert."
Raj V.,"Schaumburg, IL",20,52,296,4.0,5/15/2012,my fav restaurant. cheesecake and pizza are the best options. cant stop eating the brown bread with butter. soft and yummy
Melissa M.,"Chicago, IL",181,336,161,4.0,2/1/2010,Very nice place with a huge menu selection!  Our server was great and so was the food.  I was able to substitute my veggies for some pasta which was fantastic.  The portions are huge so bring an appetite. This location is inside Woodfield Mall right next to JC Penney.
Shannon S.,"Palatine, IL",50,69,1,2.0,8/29/2010,"How does a 25-minute lunch turn into an hour and fifteen? The Cheesecake Factory is the black hole of lunch time. My wife and I were seated quickly and the service just took forever. Here's what we ordered: Salmon Lunch Special Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos Chocolate Cake Cheesecake to go. Water Here's where it all went wrong. Our server didn't greeted us 10 minutes later. She took our drink orders, water, and came back 5 minutes later. Our food came out 15 minutes later. The Fish tacos came with a side of spanish rice that smelled spoiled. We sent it back. 15 minutes later it came back. We asked for the check and requested to see a manager 10 minutes later he stopped by. We checked out 10 minutes later with our to go order of cheescake 10 minutes later. Is it me or do the words ... minutes later frequent itself throughout this review. My wife and I have resolved to not frequent The Cheesecake Factory anymore. We are really going to have to avoid this place at all costs. Seriously, our time was sucked away by the service here....Never again."
Greg L.,"Tinley Park, IL",43,155,,4.0,9/23/2009,"Being a Cheesecake newbie (been only once last year) I was not sure what to expect.  But since ""the girls"" wanted to go, and being the easygoing guy I am, away we went. It was terrific.  The appetizers were terrific----try the Ahi tuna appetizer and the Spring Rolls.  Better than most Thai restaurants we have been to.   Although I really tried to get something different, I had this mammoth hunger for a burger and holy smack---it was one of the best I have had in years.  Been thinking about it since it was that good.   The girls had Orange Chicken and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  The OC was outstanding and the BBCS was very good but if you like it spicy, you will need to bring your own as they have no Asian hot sauce and although I slathered the burger in Tabasco, that flavor just doesn't do it when you need some Asian garlic red pepper sauce.  Also, apparently the chef ate most of the shrimp (kidding) but there were maybe a few at best.  Nearly all chicken. All in all, the food was better than great.  We picked up the cheesecake to go to eat at home during the Bears game and it was good, but too sweet and too heavy.  Yeah--I know---it is cheesecake.  But Eli's that we try is not that heavy and neither is the cheesecake I make now and then at home.  Theirs seemed really heavy like cement although flavorful on the initial bites. One last thing----they sell their sauces and dressings to go---but you should use them in 3-5 days and they must be refrigerated as they are made fresh with no preservatives.  Highly recommend their Ranch salad dressing and their Asian Peanut sauce and Spicy Cilantro sauce.  Wow---they are great! Our take---go for the food, and skip the dessert.  The food is terrific!"
M S.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,153,2,4.0,3/19/2012,"This was my first time at Cheesecake Factory and I must say I was VERY impressed! The food was so delicious, and the selection is the best you'll find. I got the cashew chicken and it was unbelievably good. The chicken was not deep fried like you find in most cashew chicken dishes, which was a huge healthy plus for me. It tasted much better and the sauce was carmalized to the pieces of chicken... so yummy. :) I took one star off because of the wait. It was just the two of us and we had to wait 30 mins. Seriously?  I can't believe they don't at least take reservations!"
Joey L.,"Winfield, IL",0,15,,4.0,4/23/2013,Came in for my friends birthday with my girlfriend and his girlfriend. We waited only a few mins for the table. Are waiter was nice and informative with the specials. Apps took a little long to come out. I had a piña colada and it was just alright.  My girlfriend like that they had a under 550 calories menu.  And the Dessert was the best part of the whole dinner
M B.,"Atlanta, GA",35,47,1,4.0,1/24/2013,Nice location and great size. Quality on par with others of the chain. Good service.
Joseph E.,"Roselle, IL",4,37,,4.0,5/25/2013,"I don't come here for the food, it's not why you come to the cheese cake factory, You come here for the Atmosphere and the cheesecake. The art on the walls as always make you feel really comfortable, the service is ok, nothing to go crazy about, the beer selections have improved, they actually had Zombie dust, Can't find it any where. but the Cheesecake OOOHHH the cheese cake is amazing. again I would give the it 5 stars if the food was something to go on about, But the Cheesecake is the best I've had, just a place I can rely on when it's time for a date night or a night to relax"
