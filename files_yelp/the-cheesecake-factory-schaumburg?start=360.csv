Shawn K.,"Carpentersville, IL",0,8,,3.0,8/11/2015,"The food is amazing, however the wait staff needs work.  We arrived and were seated.  After waiting 20 minutes, and watching others get seated and served, I finally asked the hostess if we had a waiter.  A few more minutes later, our waiter arrives and says he did not know they were seating people in our section.  (After we watched him wait on other tables around us)  Okay, so he missed us.  Lets start over.  We ordered drinks, which were one bottle of wine and two sodas.  Ten minutes later he comes back with the sodas, and then asks if we wanted one bottle of wine of two.  (????)  Then he asks which wine again and says he doesn't know anything about wine. (now I'm thinking we are in the twilight zone..)  30 minutes, we still have no drinks, no bread, no water.. and others around us have sat down, got drinks, and got their meals!!  Then a waitress comes over and says she is taking over our table!!  She goes and gets the wine and 40 minutes after we sat down, we had something to drink!!  She did well, and food was great.  But yikes!!!!   Food 5 stars, first waiter 0 stars, waitress 4 stars."
Suzi B.,"Plainfield, IL",1,1,,5.0,8/4/2013,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory countless times and am a big fan. Lunch, dinner, drinks and of course cheesecake are always great. I decided to write a review after having dinner there last night because I had such a great server - Ilene. I ordered something I don't normally eat and when it came out Ilene saw immediately that I didn't want it and offered to get me something else. I felt really bad, but she insisted it wasn't a problem and quickly got my new order to me.  Very accommodating! My favorites here are Peach Bellini, Avocado Egg Rolls, Lettuce Wraps, Pot Stickers, BBQ Chicken Salad, Chicken Madeira and Oreo Cheesecake.  Only a 30 minute wait on a Saturday so not bad!"
J O.,"Chicago, IL",27,37,5,3.0,3/10/2013,"Met up with girlfriends for lunch at noon on a Sunday. Place was crowded, but 15 minute wait was OK. Took waiter quite awhile to take our orders. My friend asked a question about something - he said he'd go find out. Seemed like a young, newer waiter. Food took a long time. One of my friends order came out incorrectly and she didn't have time to wait although they insisted it would be out very fast. Dirty plates sat on table for awhile. Wait staff walked by. We probably won't be back for quite some time. We would've ordered cheesecake to go, but we were turned off by the customer service, order being incorrect and long wait. With so many restaurant options in the area - we'll probably go elsewhere next time. Also, not a fan of trying to find parking in the lot."
Bradley C.,"Woodstock, GA",14,384,2,2.0,11/27/2011,"overpriced chain fare, service is attentive but disorganized....food is ok.  this to me is like the capital grille for twenysomethings. also, too large of a menu...breeds mediocrity."
Michael G.,"Huntley, IL",2,42,5,5.0,6/24/2014,"My go to dish here is orange chicken, ask them to put extra sauce on it otherwise it may be a bit dry."
Stephanie P.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,4,,4.0,2/19/2013,"I love this place. The only problem is it takes a really long time to get a table every time I go there, probably because it was in peak time but also because it is located in the mall. Food is superb, service is nice, and I love the atmosphere."
Jennifer M.,"Dallas, TX",69,34,15,4.0,10/31/2011,"I'm a fairly seasoned Cheesecake Factory patron, having dined at locations in half a dozen cities. I find very good consistency in the food, and this location was no exception. What really caught me off guard (in a good way), was the more intimate setting at this particular location. This location is in the Woodfield Mall shopping center's main building, which is probably the reason for the unusually longer and thinner design as compared to other locations. One of the features I usually don't like about the Cheesecake Factory is the high noise level. The arrangement of this location mitigates that annoyance by quite a bit. While it's not silent during busy hours, it's quieter than the wide-open locations. For those who have not been to a Cheesecake Factory, my food-related comments fit every location I've visited. The variety of dishes is expansive. Yes, it's a pain to wade through the advertisements in the menu, but I won't complain, knowing that it probably keeps prices down.  I've tried many dishes, and everything is always fresh and flavorful. The portions are huge, so those with smaller appetites should prepare to bring leftovers home. We always ask for our cheesecake desserts in a to-go box. The bread they bring around is great. We snap up the slightly sweet darker bread in as soon as it hits the table. For flavored iced tea lovers, their signature fruit iced tea is fantastic. I was once told it's a mix of mango and passion fruit flavors. Just beware that it goes through you very fast. The cheesecake itself is always tasty. The richer cheesecake flavors usually take me at least three sitting to finish, which means I enjoy it that much more often. The service on my two visits to this particular location has been prompt and friendly, something I've come to expect with The Cheesecake Factory. The prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food we receive. I haven't been to this location during peak dinner hours, but there was no wait for our two lunch visits. Final verdict?  I would go back to this location, in fact I already have once."
Eddie V.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",2,5,2,5.0,12/10/2013,Very beautiful restaurant inside and out. The new edition benefits employees and and guests. The service is top of the chart better than other restaurant s. The cheesecake factory is perfect for almost any occasion whether its  for a delicious brunch or a late night date. Being next to the woodfield mall makes the restaurant perfect and gaurenteed quality food and experience.
Albert K.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,188,55,3.0,11/30/2009,"Where Happiness and Diabetes collide, a Cheesecake Factory was born. In general, I usually end up getting Fish Tacos or chicken salad so I don't feel so horrible about shoving a 5gal fish tank's worth of food into my piehole.  My fish tacos and salads are always fresh and delicious.  My partner in crime during Cheesecake binges is a good girl and asks for a takeout container before starting her meal.  I don't have the willpower.   This was the first time I had the carrot cake here.  It was delicious, but now that I know it has 1000 calories and 62g of fat, I feel a quadruple bypass coming on.  Still, it was worth it. Nothing really special about this location compared to the others, but the service is quite good compared to the tourist trap of a location on Michigan Ave.  Our server, Caitlin L, was always nearby and made sure my water glass was never empty, which is quite the feat, b/c I'm a fast drinker. Watch out though, this place seems to have greasy/slippery floors every time I come here.  Maybe it's just the fat that I can't digest, soaking into my shoes?  Again, still worth it."
Marc G.,"Elgin, IL",4,24,8,2.0,10/5/2011,"Food was good. Cheesecake was even better. BUT I could have lived without the cockroach running along the wall of our booth. I whispered to our server to mention it to the manager. Later, when she said nothing about it and the manager never stopped at our booth, I asked the server if she had mentioned it. She had. The manager told her the exterminator was due in. We received not even an I'm sorry. I didn't ask for discounts, freebies, or anything. But an acknowledgement from the manager would have been nice under those circumstances."
Kelly D.,"Chicago, IL",39,5,,4.0,10/16/2011,"Last night was my second time eating at the Schaumburg location. It was busy, as expected on a Saturday night. We were lucky enought to get a seat at a table in the bar, so we waited about 10 mintes, rather than the 30 that was quoted. I decided that this place NEEDS a cocktail server to wait on all of us chumps waiting around to get a table. Everyone at the bar was sitting down eating dinner, so it was impossible to grab a drink while waiting.  Our server, Nicole was great. Friendly, fast, and didn't screw anything up. What more could you ask for?  We ordered: Mai tai, Pear martini, dirty martini, rasberry martini, tuna sashimi (had tendons) fried artichole pieces (awesome), arugula salad, miso salmon, pan seared salmon, fish tacos, raspberry chocolate, godiva chocolate (richer than bill gates) and oreo cheesecake (sooo gooood). Excellent meal. The quantity and quality of food you get for the price is very fair."
Marcia T.,"Chicago, IL",34,116,,5.0,7/4/2011,Second time coming here...and I have no complaints at all...both times I've had great fast service...and is so yummy...the red velvet cheese cake was delicious...so was the chocolate mousse one...I had the lemon herb chicken and I love it...can't wait to come again =)
Rita A.,"Gilbert, AZ",7,79,6,2.0,8/14/2013,"Went here in June with my husband after shopping for an appiteaser and a drink, what a mistake! First we were ignored by the Host as she discussed her hair color with another girl, then after being seated at a table with no table/silver wear our waiter was too busy to be concerned. It took 20 minutes for him to ask us what we wanted to drink, we place our order at that time and asked for silver wear and napkins. We never received napkins or silver wear, my husband took them from an empty unattended table. Another 20 mins and some other server brings out our appetizer and fresh bread that should have been given to us on arrival. We were starving and plowed into any offerings we were given at the time. Ten more minutes after our second request, we received our drinks. The only reason this place gets a second star is because the appetizer (buffalo chicken stuffed somethings) were very good, hot and fresh- could use more chicken inside! ; maybe it was because I would have eaten anything at this time. I am not really a fan to be honest not if I have to deal with less than par service from a Mall restaurant!"
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2453,3000,4.0,5/4/2009,"Thinking we could grab a quick bite before a late comedy show we stopped in. Seriously, silly thinking. Cheesecake is never quick. We ordered and mentioned we were hitting a show, so if they could rush as best possible and close out the check as the food came out. We cut it close but were able to dine and drink in under an hour. It was late and the mall closes at 9pm, worried we would have to walk outside around the mall back to the Improv we inquired with staff, they were unsure as what to do. Luckily, a restaurant door which shares an entrance with the mall entrance was left unlocked so we were able to trek over to the wing where the ""Chicago"" Improv resides.  It was a late Friday night and it was busy, to avoid waiting we sat in the bar. They had the A/C on full blast, wondered if this was a tactic to keep people from sitting long periods in the bar area? Food was good as usual, had a BBQ pulled swine (pork) sandwich which was bangin' and a cocktail which had to be redone once, since it didn't taste right. Too much filler and not enough alcohol, the lightest pour ever. The second time, a charm. Seemed like the waiter was hitting on the one lady in our party which was fine, but he kept asking if we would buy dessert and take it along. My thing is, if we tell you in advance we're hitting a show, that's it. I think most people know that you can't bring food from another place into a movie or comedy club. Being that this location is at a mall it would be good if the bar area was bigger, the outside tables of the bar are considered belonging to reserved seating. Those seats at the bar and the four high top tables are not enough. Most times if it's a single at a table of four seats, people in this area do not like to share tables. Even if it is just to wait with a drink."
Maitri J.,"Schaumburg, IL",17,26,,3.0,3/27/2014,Food choice is overwhelming! Cheesecakes are good. Salads are not great lettuce is wilted
lee w.,"Chicago, IL",1,43,,2.0,3/23/2014,disappointing. This place used to be very good and gets a little worse every year. They still manage to fill all the seats though because most people are probably like me and think that it's still very good but its not anymore. I won't be going back unless somebody gets me a gift card that I have to use.
JJ P.,"Champaign, IL",49,85,,2.0,7/28/2011,"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner.  For the price we paid, I've had far better meals elsewhere.  Our spinach and cheese dip appetizer was swimming in grease.  The potatoes on her Shepherd's Pie were mostly uncooked.  My Cuban Sandwich was pretty much a ham sandwich with mustard and pickles.  The place was very loud, though I will say that our server was great.  He was upbeat and when I pointed out the potatoes, he comped us a slice of cheesecake to take home.  Still, if I am going to pay $60 for a meal for two, I expect the food to be excellent, not nasty, undercooked, or something I could have made myself."
Melissa R.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,8,1,4.0,5/29/2014,Food is good.....had the avacado egg rolls......LOVE them ! Also the chipolte chicken pasta is awesome.
Dan F.,"Chicago, IL",16,27,6,5.0,2/13/2012,"What is there to say about Cheesecake Factory--probably the most consistent chain restaurant in the country--always great food, super service and great quality and quantity of food.  We shared appetizers last night--Luau Salad and spinach and cheese dip--we were both stuffed.  Took our White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake to go--it was a delicous topper at home last night.  Really do my best to stay away from national chains, but you won't see me doing that with Cheesecake Factory--it is truly a great place no matter where you are at."
Melanie V.,"Chicago, IL",634,870,247,5.0,12/29/2008,"I always manage to lose my phone.  Ask my friends - I'm always fishing around in my huge purse, trying to locate the stupid thing.  Why I just don't put the phone in purse pocket...who knows.   Anyway, this time, I was digging around my purse when I realized that I actually couldn't find it.  Like, for real this time.  So, I push my way through the crowds at Cheesecake and rush back to the bar where we had been sitting.  I frantically ask the couple sitting there if they had seen a phone on the counter.  Thankfully, they tell me they had just turned it into the bartender.  I thanked them repeatedly because 1) I'm honestly addicted to my phone and 2) I'm too broke to deal with replacing a phone.  What a nice couple!  That's part of the holiday spirit, for sure.  ;)  Anyway, the phone was back in my possession in less than 10 minutes.  Awesome!"
