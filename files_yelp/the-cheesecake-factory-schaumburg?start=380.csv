Edward C.,"Chicago, IL",14,17,6,3.0,8/31/2009,"Good food at a reasonably price.  The portions are pretty big.  The service varies, but usually it's adequate.   I go there periodically since it's always around and relatively agreeable food with all my friends.   It's pricier than the other chains, but definitely better.   The ads in the menu is a little tacky, makes it seem a little trashier, but it's all good still  :) I've only been to... 5-6 different CFs,  but this one seems reasonably big, and parking is always available, as it's in the mall."
Meredith F.,"Bayonne, NJ",142,11,,3.0,2/18/2009,"I used to be a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory ... but that was when it was more of a novelty, before they seemed to pop up all over the place in typical chain fashion.  The food is quite good no matter what you order. This time I tried something new (rather than sticking with the Pasta Da Vinci or the Chinese Chicken Salad). I had the Spicy Crispy Beef --- which btw definitely lives up to the spicy title.  Service was good, but nothing special. Portions are HUGE so be prepared to either feel the effects of overeating later that day or to take home an extra meal.  If you're looking for something a step above your average chain, this is it, but if you're looking for something original check out something a little less mass produced.  But make sure to save a little room after the main course for either cheesecake, or my favorite the strawberry shortcake!"
Jef B.,"Sacramento, CA",147,422,42,5.0,10/14/2009,"Probably my favorite place to eat when in the Woodfield area, though California Pizza Kitchen comes up a close second. We were there as a party of  three last weekend. Service was great and fast; we were seated within 10 minutes around 5 o'clock. Salads and soups were huge. Entrees - very good, very plentiful. Of course we had to have the cheesecake dessert afterward; despite our already plentifully overstuffed situation. The margaritas were tiny but well made - thumbs down on the margaritas. I need plentiful booze to match the food portions."
Jay K.,"Oshawa, Canada",0,50,26,4.0,3/26/2010,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Mainly in Florida and Las Vegas. All have proven to be excellent experiences. If not fine dining, they are at least consistant in quality. The value for money is good and the fresh baked sour dough bread is great. You'll never be disappointed with a visit here."
Charles J.,"Lockport, IL",20,90,24,5.0,3/10/2012,"I've been to several locations over the years and its usually busy but always above average food and no exceptions here, great service and meal better than what I can make. Hence why I don't have a my own joint and come here. Not cheap but as my daddy says, ""cheap stuff ain't good and good stuff ain't cheap."
Craig R.,"Charlotte, NC",57,389,10,4.0,9/21/2009,"This place serves gigantic portions!  I went with my g/f for the cheesecake and discovered the food is pretty good here.  Prices are not outrageous, service is fast and the desserts are yummy!   if you are in the mall and want a bite ...check it out!"
Nicole R.,"Schaumburg, IL",79,198,34,4.0,3/2/2011,"Every time I go here there is always a wait... Not a big deal it is woodfield mall. The food is always good, haven't had one bad thing. Love the Red Velvet Cheesecake! :) But it's kinda pricey for a slice. Last time I was there, the waitress was nice but seemed like she was on crack and it took her forever (like 30 mins) to get our check and my cheesecake to go. Only go to Cheesecake when we can't figure out where to go to eat because they have a huge menu."
Jr S.,"Downers Grove, IL",0,26,,5.0,3/24/2014,Great food. Very ample portions. Management is great here. Really good staff and good service in my experience. Highly recommend.
Christopher H.,"DeKalb, IL",0,8,3,5.0,3/10/2014,"Fantastic food.  Big servings.  Solid staff.  Can be crowded usually, but it's worth the wait.  Of course, the cheesecake is great."
Doug M.,"Algonquin, IL",25,257,72,3.0,7/29/2009,"We went here after driving around trying to find a place we haven't been before. We had heard some good things about it.  I'd say it's a nice place with good food.  Most of the prices for the entree's are fair because the portions are large, however, $12 for a BLT club is excessive. I had the Farfelle chicken which was great ($15).  The fried zucchini appetizer was good too and only $3.95.   The menu was quite extensive and offered a lot to choose from, and like  30 cheesecake varieties.  Atmosphere: loud, sometimes hard to converse. On the plus side, the booths have high backs on them. It was very busy for a Tuesday evening and as a result the service suffered a bit, but the server was pleasant and well versed with the menu."
Mae S.,"Chicago, IL",15,19,4,4.0,11/21/2010,"Great customer service! Love the shrimp fettuccine dish, but where's appetizer sampler???"
Doug A.,"Barrington, IL",70,63,44,4.0,3/24/2009,"I usually fly solo up to this Cheesecake factory because it's right by my work and if I went with people I couldn't sit at the bar.  Yes it's crowded all the time.  As I wait for traffic to die down, I sit and nurse a Stoli Martini and nibble on the Ahi Tempura rolls.   The service is good because the bartender is only responsible for about 12 seats and there are usually two of them.  The drinks could be better.  They really shake the hell out of my drink so I get little chunks of ice in it.  If your gonna make a martini make it right.  The Ahi Tempura rolls are da bomb.  So good.  Decent price.   And if you sit at the bar they have two windows that look out into the mall so you can people watch if that is your thing.  I enjoy it.  Of course if you look way across from the window you can look at the people at Applebees.  Which is a show all in itself."
Elizabeth T.,"Schaumburg, IL",45,325,81,2.0,8/26/2009,"Food -- good portions for the price. Our server -- very nice, very accomodating, knew the menu, had good food recommendations Hostess -- HORRIBLE! We stopped by today, asked how long the Table for 2 wait was. We were told 5 minutes. We waited for 20 mins . No table still. Saw 2 people who just came in. They were given a table right away. We went to the hostess table. We asked why a 2 people ahead of us were given a table right away. They said ""Oh, we were calling your name but didn't hear from you."" We were seated on the waiting section in front of the hostess table. Never heard our name. Waited 2 more minutes and were given a table IN THE BAR. Hostess apologized for missing us and we DO appreciate the apology.  However...with this restaurant being here, management should train their host staff better."
Liz B.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",68,172,20,4.0,6/20/2011,"A good place to go if you're starving after a power shopping trip or just starving in general. The portions are enormous, even the lunch choices are huge. Service is great as well. I really don't think you can go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory."
Ana E.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,38,11,2.0,3/16/2012,I thought since it was in a good location it was going to be good but it wasn't . The service sucked and the food was late and not that good. Its fine if you go there just don't order the filet mignon way over priced and not tasty at all.
Al G.,"Aurora, IL",6,12,1,3.0,3/10/2012,This visit was for my Mom's birthday.  The menu is eclectic as always and the food and service was consistent and to expectation.  This visit was to the Factory at the Woodfield mall which has a strange arrangement that is long and narrow.  The Oakbrook location has a much better dinning room as the restaurant is located in a stand alone building.  For a real treat vist the location at the base of the Hancock building and eat outside and take the opportunity to look up!  Just outstanding while sucking down a piece of the Factory's signature cheese cakes.
Stefan K.,"Chicago, IL",12,36,4,4.0,7/22/2011,"By now everyone knows that The Cheesecake Factory is known for their ample portions of delicious food.  While their menu is sometimes overwhelming, I have never found any of their dishes to not meet expectations.  The servers are attentive and make sure that if you modify your order, you get it exactly how you order.  Granted I've never had any of the cheesecake, but everything else is aces!"
Joe B.,"Chicago, IL",25,121,24,4.0,7/22/2011,This place is great... the service is quick and they are there for you everytime. The food is very well made and delicious and of course the red velvet cheesecake was incredible. I went there over the 4th fo July weekend and it was excellent as always.
Natalie E.,"Palatine, IL",8,9,,1.0,1/21/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake factory tonight.  Spent $60 and had a nasty black hair deep fried and connecting two calamari.  Brought it to the waitresses attention.  Did nothing but take the plate back.  Once we had finished eating the other food we ordered, she brought out a fresh plate....because we wanted it then?  No apologies, no comp, not a thing was done!  I will NEVER go back to the Cheesecake Factory again because of this.  When I'm paying that much money to eat someplace, I expect comparable service.   Very disappointed and frustrated."
Gail C.,"Des Plaines, IL",39,176,,3.0,5/18/2009,"(Yikes did I just give cheesecake only 3 stars?) Yep, that's what this deserved this time.  I have been here any number of times with great results.  This time, meh.... Our waiter? rude, slow and rude food:  before dinner bread excellent, portions gigantic and good cheesecake:  excellent The person I came with had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so I really built it up.  I was actually embarrased by the experience. The best thing:  2 raspberry martini's (thank you for not messing these up)"
