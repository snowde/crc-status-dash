Melissa Z.,"Normal, IL",46,54,103,5.0,9/17/2017,"Like all locations, this one is incredible too. The food choices don't leave anyone left without options. The largest menu of any restaurant I've ever seen. There is truly something for absolutely everyone. The servers are well trained, know the menu, and are very friendly. The food is amazing. The cheesecake is of course, to die for. The lemon berry  cream cheese choice melts in your mouth. A combination of strawberry shortcake and cheesecake. You can't go wrong. The store is very clean, very nice, very organized."
Bry M.,"Palatine, IL",8,7,,4.0,10/15/2017,"You can't go wrong with the grilled salmon or the ribeye steak!!! I think alcohol is overpriced however. I recommend Alex S. She actually checks on you in between order and when it's time to pay your bill! No kidding! Most servers there take your order and are never to be seen again until you pay. Busy weekends, try to make it by 7."
Mark V.,"Elmhurst, IL",126,11,20,4.0,7/14/2017,Amazing food. The prices are high but the quantity is very large and one meal can serve as two meals even for a guy like me. The Mac and cheese balls were $12 which is a little expensive for the quantity that you receive but by far the best form of Mac and cheese I have tried. The Kobe burger was delicious but nothing that was jaw dropping but it is the quality that you pay for. The only aspect that could have improved was the customer service. I could tell the server was a little overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had that she didn't seem to pleased when we would have a request.
Lukas S.,"Bartlett, IL",12,207,7,5.0,4/24/2017,"We came for lunch on a Sunday and were told there'd be a 10 minute wait; however, we barely got through drooling over all the cheesecakes and were seated! So, not a bad wait at all! Our waitress was Lauren B. and she was super sweet and gave excellent service. I've been craving enchiladas for a couple weeks but feel guilty ordering them...well, they had ""skinnilicious"" chicken enchiladas! So, I got my craving fix and didn't feel guilty. They were excellent and did not feel ""skinny."" I like that they have all the calories on the menu so that if you are trying to eat healthy you can have that information! But I also like that they have the ""skinny"" menu in addition to the regular menu. Great selection but overwhelming menu! And the cheesecake is so tempting! We had a great experience and the booths are a nice size!"
Gary D.,"Bensenville, IL",0,37,1,1.0,11/18/2017,"Over-salted garbage, I have a small beer gut and I looked anorexic compared to most of their customers.   They make up for the low quality ingredients by serving obesity portions."
Juliana G.,"North Chicago, IL",1,43,23,2.0,9/10/2017,"Ordered shrimp scampi with pasta but the shrimp were breaded. I told the waitress about the mistake, she asked me to put them in a plate and took them away about 5-10 minutes later the manager came back with 5 grilled shrimp that weren't seasoned. He then stated 2 more shrimps will be coming out shortly. By the time I received my unflavored shrimp my pasta was cold. The waitress just ignored the issue vice at least apologizing about the mix up. I understand that mistakes are made but it's how they reacted or didn't react about the problem and instead ignored it that seemed unprofessional in a place where customer service is key."
Vivian S.,"Roselle, IL",94,19,14,5.0,9/3/2017,"Every time I've come here I've never had a bad experience. This place is truly cash money for being a chain restaurant!!! Parking here can be done only through the Woodfield Mall parking lot which can either really suck or it can not suck as much if you can get good parking. I do love that the restaurant has allocated parking spots for patrons who order takeout which is also awesome! I do recommend that they offer some sort of valet parking option but I guess that option isn't as easy at this location (Oakbrook location has valet).  The inside of this restaurant is beautiful like all the other Cheesecake Factory locations. This location,to me, is just a little smaller though. On a busy night it's hard to find a place to sit down while waiting for a table but they do have a coat closet which is cool . I usually call ahead of time to hold a table if I have a large party.  Okay all the waitstaff here are very good at what they do! This place is usually busy and these fellas still get everything about your order correct! Drinks are brought out fast and the food also arrives pretty quickly. I like that they always check in on the tables frequently but not too much ya know? The bust boys turn over tables quickly too! Overall, you can expect a cash money experience here!  The menu here is huge! The drink selection too is fantastic! I usually stick to a water with lemon  and the lemons are cut like a wedge which I love because other restaurants usually just give you a sad little slice:( the strawberry lemonade is pretty dank here though so give that a try! All of the portions from the appetizers to the main dishes are very big! I love the avocado rolls here with that delicious cilantro dipping sauce... the dynamite shrimp is also great! If you're watching calories, then look no further because they also got a skinny menu (the shrimp  scampi is phenomenal). When I'm feeling extra, I usually opt in for the steak Diane/ salmon combo with asparagus and mashed potatoes with no mushrooms  (ew). This is frick'n awesome dish!!  The salmon melts in your mouth with herbal flavor and the light sauce leaves your palette satisfied! The steak is cooked to perfection all the time and is already cut up! This place also does brunch on Sunday but I haven't tried it yet. I will update this review once I've tried the brunch. Now for the real reason why everyone comes to the Factory of Cheesecake: the cheesecake! My husband usually just orders a whole 8 inch (I think) cake to take home and order it once you get there because it takes 2 hours to thaw out. The banana cream cheesecake is amazing and a personal favorite!"
Ash W.,"Orlando, FL",68,45,204,4.0,3/25/2017,Consistently delicious food and service. Sunday brunch is my favorite - I'm obsessed with the Monte Cristo.  I always have to get a slice of the red velvet cheesecake to take home for later.
Angell N.,"Carpentersville, IL",39,8,7,5.0,9/25/2017,"So yes it's the best place for cheesecake of course and usually that's exactly what I go there for. Stop in grab one of my favorite kinds and run out but decided to have dinner there and glad I did. They were extremely busy for a Thursday night but we got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately. She was very knowledgeable about the menu which helped cause its extensive and I have a hard time deciding to begin with The calamari appetizer was good but the star of appetizers has to be the Thai chicken lettuce wraps! They come with 3 different sauces, the chicken was cooked perfectly and they actually use the correct lettuce for wraps unlike some other restaurants which shall remain nameless. The rest of the food was good as well. Usually I'd be ready for my cheesecake at the end of it all but I decided to try something different and went for their chocolate truffle layer cake.....AMAZING!!!!!!! Sure it took me 2 days to eat it cause the piece was monster sized but um yea do try it!!!! I'll be stopping in for just that now"
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,4.0,7/11/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the same everywhere. I come to one at least once a month. It's my boyfriends favorite place [I know, from ALL the places in Chicago].  Service was good, food was good. We didn't have room for desert as usual.  I would pretty much recommend this as a place for a first date since the menu is huge and theres no way he/she won't find something to chew on no matter how picky.  Definitely try the Mai Tai and the Peach Daquiri if you have a chance (and if youre 21+ of course). Feels like those two drinks have always paired well with everything I order (pasta, tuna, or salad)."
Agatha V.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,18,6,3.0,5/17/2017,"We were here on Mother's Day, so understandably the place was packed. After we seated in 35 minutes, our service was pretty fast and efficient thanks to our server. Again because of holiday, the food took longer to come, so no big deal. Our party enjoyed our food except my friend whose meatloaf tasted worse than frozen foods of Walmart. The taste was so bland and hardly edible that she entirely passed that one. On a plus note, our server didn't charged us that blandnoaf, seeing that my friend didn't enjoyed it. Overall, it was nice Cheesecake Factory experience as usual, but nothing particularly awesome or exciting."
Suzanne L.,"Chicago, IL",21,35,8,5.0,6/19/2017,Group of 5 of us girls had an excellent experience today! We came during the busy lunch rush and our server was attentive the whole time and super friendly.  All our dishes came out perfect and the cheesecake was even better. What was even nicer was they accommodated our group with great seating. I have a toddler and a newborn....and a large 2 seat stroller. We were seated comfortably at a corner table with room to park the stroller next to us without being in the way.  Can't wait to come back!
Bill N.,"Crown Point, IN",54,274,89,3.0,1/27/2017,It is The Cheese Cake Factory...Consistent with chain restaurants..  This visit produced a long hair in the Mac & Cheese Balls. Very appreciative of how it was handled but due care and attention to detail needs to be applied.
Veronica R.,"Chicago, IL",55,22,,3.0,3/17/2017,"Well it is very sad that this amazing restaurant has taken a turn. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is many because every time I do order the lettuce wraps (my favorite thing off the menu) I request it to come warm yet it always comes cold and un appetizing. I mentioned this to the waiter who by no means was helpful (they are so very busy) that its more like a ""sorry"" no replacement or taken of the bill. Meanwhile the lettuce wraps get thrown away and its a waste of money.  I wish we can get a repeat the right way but after 7 recent fails I think it's going to be a no deal :!"
Mario P.,"Skokie, IL",2,10,3,5.0,7/11/2017,Today was my first time eating at The Cheesecake Factory. I went out for lunch with my co-workers and I ordered the Mac & Cheese Burger. It blew my freaking mind! It is definitley worth trying. The atmosphere was very nice and our waitress was very knowledgeable and super friendly. We had a great experience.
Jawad M.,"Des Plaines, IL",47,60,73,3.0,1/9/2017,Went there for dessert. The waitress came we asked her to come back to allow us time to decide what we want. She never came back.  Tried the carrot cheese cake it was really good!  The mango cheese cake is ok. If you like tangy than it might be good.  $6.95 - $7.95 for a slice of cheese cake. Everything in there better be organic! lol I think that's expensive.
Sandra Y.,"Chicago, IL",292,146,349,1.0,11/17/2016,"Went here for dessert the other day with 3 other people and I feel like the server didn't like us too much because we were just ordering desserts. We felt very ignored for most of the night. Overall service was very very slow. First, she messed up our order and brought us the wrong cheesecake. I give it to her for remembering 3 out of the 4 that we ordered. It might've helped if she wrote it down. It took forever to get 4 slices of cheesecake. Seriously should not take like half an hr for that... Then, we couldn't even tell her about her mistake because she never came to our table. It was impossible to get her attention. It was not that busy when we were there either. So finally, we get her attention and she takes it away (brand new, we didn't touch it). We got the correct order like 15 minutes later... and it was nasty. It was too sweet and none of us liked it, but we didn't want to send it back. Idk why people I'm with don't like sending food back, but anyway! 4 slices for $40 is basically a rip off, but we still like to go here because sometimes it's good and we were really craving cheesecake.   I find that at this cheesecake factory, the service is always bad. Whether you spend $40 or $200... I get it that they're really busy sometimes, but you don't wanna feel like you're inconveniencing them by being there and that's how I've felt twice so far. And this is spaced out like a year apart. Idk I'll prob still go here when I crave cheesecake, but even those are a hit or miss. Some good, some not good at all. The same goes for the food. Maybe I'll just carry out my cheesecake next time or something."
Rishi R.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,4,4.0,4/8/2017,This is a very good place if you are going with a group as they have a variety of dishes. They serve complimentary bread and their Wheat bread is delicious. Spicy Chipotle Chicken is my favorite. I have been to Cheese Cake Factory at multiple locations and the taste of the food is consistent. Margaritas were good.
Phil P.,"Schaumburg, IL",52,170,,4.0,6/26/2016,"Been to this particular Cheesecake many times over the years...and my go-to has always been the Tostada Salad.  It is fkn huge and delicious! Kudos to their training program because the service here is great, too. I just wish they would take reservations."
Mary I.,"Bartlett, IL",0,8,,2.0,10/29/2017,"My family went to Cheesecake Factory for our Sunday Dinner. We were sat at a table right by the waitress stand. No privacy - waitress always looking down on us. Next we ordered 4 dinners and the first one - they didn't have - a ruben sandwich. Then after re-ordering they brought 3 dinners to the table - waited about 10 minutes for my dinner to come while everyone elses got cold. The tacos were sooooo tiny and they put all the ingredients on them that I asked not to have put on. Aggravating. When I went to restroom they were out of service - wont go into detail. But the best is when I spoke with the manager on my way out - blonde lady her only response was ""sorry about that."" Really - wont be back - I didn't ask for anything - already paid the bill - But what a lousy response. Obviously our business did not matter. Plenty of other places to go in Woodfield !!!!"
