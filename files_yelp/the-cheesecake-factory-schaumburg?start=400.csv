Apara W.,"Schaumburg, IL",211,244,1,5.0,10/24/2010,"Had a fabulous experience here today. You know when you are spending 75$ plus for a family dinner, the last thing you want is- obnoxious service. We had Jessica V as our server. She was so helpful and patient. Food portions are decent. Quick service. Good quality food. Best cheesecakes ever( of course!) I highly recommend asking for Jessica V especially if you are with kids."
Rhonda G.,"Chicago, IL",255,880,4,4.0,8/2/2008,"I'm not a huge fan of most large chain restaurants so this place took me by surprise. Went with another couple for a friends birthday and the wait wasn't bad at all for a Saturday night in the God forsaken Woodfield Mall. I like the colors used in the dining area because they have a nice warm inviting feel to them. The booths look nice BUT the seats aren't really cushioned so don't expect to bounce back up if you plop down (my mistake). The Service: Waiter was attentive, not really chatty but he had tons of other tables so no biggie. He kept the drinks coming and made appearances when necessary. Food: Our table had chicken nachos as an appetizer and they were excellent. I try to stay away from nachos at most places because they tend to screw them up or add a mountain of sour cream. These were just right For my meal I had a turkey burger with mushrooms and onions. This was the biggest turkey burger I have ever seen! I was eating for a half hour and hadn't put a dent in it. Others in my group ordered the Cuban sandwich, rigatoni, and some other pasta dish (farfalle?) and we all agreed that we were pretty darn happy. Cheesecake: So say what you want about the Cheesecake factory, the cheesecake is so good here! We had the banana cream cheesecake and it was banana heaven! Price: not too bad at all 2 people for $36 before tip If you're in the area and looking for a place to grab lunch, dinner or cheesecake then definitely go here. Would  I drive all the way from the city to eat here? probably not but if I'm in town I'll drop by."
Toney S.,"Country Club Hills, IL",0,11,1,5.0,8/18/2011,"While we have the cheesecake this was my and my wife's first time as dine in customers. Awesome! The service was perfect the food was delicious. We had the crab bite and avocado egg-rolls apps, so so good we couldn't stop raving. The Carmel chix entree succulent and flavorful. Coullete steak And asparagus topnotch. Laura our server was super helpful with all out questions, attentive and friendly without being over bearing. Her performance made the meal that much more enjoyable. And as always the dessert was to die for. Go, eat and enjoy. You can't go wrong choosing CF."
Little Miss L.,"Chicago, IL",22,42,,4.0,3/21/2011,"the hubs and i sit at the bar and watch the magic happen.... we learned really quick to NOT sit in the dining room (otherwise it ruins your anniversary and you end up going out for dinner later to rectify the situation)...anyhooooooo-- i love this place...you can have a different dish everytime you go...and it's pretty much always delish.  as far as being pricey...REALLY?  you get 2-3 meals outta the one so its actually a great deal cause the portions are insane.  we sit at the bar and watch sal and amanda work.  that sal is a machine.  he always remembers us when we come in, and has even surprised us with a free appetizer (firecracker shrimp--spicy, crunchy, tasty!)..and he makes a tasty martini!  i love that place....it's really bad, since we live 3 minutes away...  tee-hee"
Nilam P.,"San Jose, CA",62,76,21,5.0,4/23/2011,"Love the ambience and the low lighting in the evening. Very romantic! Our waitress was awesome and very attentive, even though it was packed on a Friday night. My drink and food were fantastic, and cant forget the yummy cheesecake!"
Arin B.,"Winfield, IL",152,38,,3.0,5/30/2011,Cheesecake Factory is a solid place to have dinner. I'd probably give 3 1/2 stars if I could. The menu is huge so you will always find something to eat and the cheesecake here is delicious. But come with an appetite because the portions are huge and make sure you bring $$ as well because it can get expensive!
Lisse C.,"Tucker, GA",1,63,5,3.0,7/13/2013,"This is one of about 5 cheesecake factories I have eaten at and still don't understand why this place is busy. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced.    My husband and I stopped in for dessert one night and sat in the bar area. The was a waitress taking care of a table next to us but since we were not in her section she did not even so much as say someone will be with you. She just completely ignored us as did everyone else that walked by for the next 7 minutes until our waitress came over. Due to how nice our waitress Sarah was the whole experience improved but no employee smiles there. Most of them look just pissed off and loathing every minute of being there.     While waiting for our coffee and chocolate tower truffle cake I watched the bartender making a drink and stick her hand (ungloved) in the glass to remove something. I'm not talking just a finger, THE WHOLE HAND! There was no ice in the glass yet which allowed ample space for all 5 digits, disgusting! Makes you wonder what goes in where you can't see when a employee does that right in plain sight.      Well the dessert and coffee arrived in a timely manner so we dug in. The cake was deliciously moist and rich. The coffee was good, tasted fresh even though it was late at night. Sarah checked back with us several times, she was very attentive.      I will say even though I don't care for their food they do a good job with dessert. If your name is The Cheesecake Factory then I would expect that anyway. With that being said there are enough other places that have good dessert and better service that I would likely not go back."
Tim K.,"Barrington, IL",0,14,,5.0,11/27/2013,"This place is always great.  The service, the food, and the stellar atmosphere always bring me back.  Before an Improv show or shopping with the family it brings us in every time."
Elizabeth W.,"Des Plaines, IL",276,332,179,2.0,5/16/2010,"I've been here enough times and had enough not-so-good experiences that I'm taking a break from coming here. To explain why, I'm going to make a list of things I consider unacceptable at a restaurant, and point out that this isn't a dive bar or a hole in the wall diner, where I might expect this sort of thing. 1) When a customer orders something with no cheese, it is not acceptable to scrape cheese off of the item and bring it the customer with strings of it dangling off the food. 2) When a customer leaves the plate untouched for ten minutes, it is not acceptable for a server to not notice that there's a problem. 3) It is not acceptable for this to happen on multiple occasions, as opposed to it being a one-time fluke. The manager did come and apologize, but by then we'd been there about half an hour and one of us had finished eating. We didn't want the item replaced, we wanted to leave so we wouldn't be late for our after-dinner plans. The item was removed from the bill, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that the food did not arrive as ordered and nobody was paying enough attention to notice and fix it while there was still time. This has happened here so many times that I don't get why there's always a long wait to be seated. Doesn't getting the wrong food all the time put people off? Then again, with so many fried items on the menu, maybe people are so busy shoveling grease into their faces that they don't notice what's on the plate. My other issue with this place is the noise. It is incredibly loud. At one point, no less than five babies were screaming in close proximity to us, and a toddler was throwing a tantrum. I'm going to come out of the service industry closet here and admit that I used to work as a service trainer for a company I whose name I will not mention, and part of my job (among many, many other things) was teaching hosts and hostesses to space high chairs throughout the dining room rather than clumping them together. This is both for fire safety (if they're all pushed out into the aisle at the same time, it can slow people trying to exit the building) and for the benefit of diners, because the babies in those high chairs can make a lot of noise. Obviously they don't train the hosts and hostesses to do this at Cheesecake Factory. What a difference it would make if they did. I wouldn't have been popping Tylenol all night like they were candy. The only reason Cheesecake Factory gets two stars instead of one (despite the long waits, loud dining room, heart attack menu, and lazy shortcuts like scraping cheese) is the artichoke. Oh my god, can they cook an artichoke. If I come back anytime soon, that artichoke will be why."
Mary S.,"Downers Grove, IL",1,7,,1.0,11/8/2008,"We used to meet here with family friends but got tired of the 1 1/2 HOUR waits ALL the time.   we started going up the the Lincolnshire Cheesecake Factory instead, which is MUCH MUCH better, and harly EVER has a wait!!  Just take 53 north and go there instead!  the drive to there is shorter than the wait to get a table here! Oh, and since it is in the MALL, parking of course is a HUGE pain!  Your lucky to find a spot in the front 1/2 of the parking lot!  usually you have to park in the VERY back of the lot!"
Truthy R.,"McHenry, IL",0,14,,4.0,11/5/2013,Fish & Chips true british style.  Shrimp scampi is breaded and not what I expected.  Everything was very tasty and finishrd off with a slice of the Tiramisu cheesecake.  Very busy for lunch.
George R.,"Bartlett, IL",163,176,247,3.0,10/27/2007,"Top 5 things to know before going to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodfield Mall: 1. The wait time for a table is usually long. The wait, the wait... oh the wait. (sigh) 2. A group of more than 4 people will probably wait longer. (heavy sigh) 3. Not a lot of room to stand around during your wait and the entryway gets jammed with waiting people. (oh, my lower back is starting to ache) 4. If you're going on a weekend or during shopping season, take off your coat, put down the shopping bags, and find a good wall to lean against because you will surely wait. (rubs eyes, leans head against the wall, and yawns) 5. Once you FINALLY get a table, the rest is smooth sailing with good food and good service. Now prepare to gain weight! (oh, we finally get to eat?!)"
Nick T.,"Palatine, IL",38,2,,2.0,5/15/2010,"Meh pretty much defines my experience. My wife and I went there because we had a $25 gift certificate, which by the way it did not go far. We decided that we did not want to spend too much and went with two drinks and two apps. We ordered the crispy fried cheese and the crab won tons. My wife ordered a pomegranate Margarita, and I ordered a blue moon. Ok so that's what we ordered and what we got was 6 pieces of fried crusts because the cheese had either melted out or just disappeared, a plate of won tons that have been over cooked and dry. The drinks by the way where good, nothing to really mess up. We did complain to our waitress, she was nice and she ran back and brought us out better cheese bytes, and that was that.  My wife and I skipped dinner and went straight for the dessert, we ordered the Coconut Cream Cheese cake, it was good. When we got the bill it was over $40, we felt a little disappointed. At some of our favorite places that would have been 1 app. 2 dinners and drinks.  Over all service was ok, food was not great and overpriced, cheesecake is good all this = meh."
Ivanka B.,"Stamford, CT",168,359,519,2.0,12/21/2010,"While I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is notorious for great service, quality dishes and that higher quality meal in a casual atmosphere. I made the huge mistake of suggesting to meet at Woodfield with co-workers the week before Christmas for lunch and thus had to suffer through an over 30 min wait (standing, which was no easy task since I have a stress fracture in my tibia) - oh well. This was the first time I was rather turned off by my food choice and the service. I understand that they're busy but the server hovered over us, and NOT in a good way. It was obvious he did not want us to sit there and talk shop but rather scarf down our meal and get the heck out.  I ordered something I have had before and really liked but unfortunately this time it completely missed the mark and made me nauseous - the ahi tempura roll appetizer. The tuna was super fishy and something just wasn't right, I barely ate 2 pieces. Normally, upon seeing this, a server would inquire as to the reason for non-consumption (in my experience) - not so much this time. Oh well - my own fault for coming anywhere near this mall and this restaurant during Christmas week. I still like you Cheesecake Factory but it's highly doubtful I will ever consume raw tuna within your establishment again!"
Demdem B.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,,3.0,9/21/2013,"I give the food 5 stars because it was AMAZING. I ordered the alfredo pasta with chicken and it was wonderful. Also, the bread they serve you is quite good and warm too!  Now, the service was HORRIBLE! As soon as my friend and I walked in, the hostesses greeted us with no smiles at all and looked unhappy to be there. Get this, as she walked us to our table, I asked if we can please have a booth and she totally just left us hanging in the middle of the restaurant and walked back to the front. After 5 minutes of standing there, she came back and sat us in the booth right next to the table. Why? I have no clue. So after sitting there for 10 minutes, the waitress FINALLY decided to come to our table. I could sense she was in a hurry and seemed like she wanted to take our orders quickly, lucky for her, we knew what we wanted. The food actually came out quickly and was great. She probably came to our table 4 or 5 times to ask if we wanted our food packed, uhm EXCUSE ME, we were clearly still eating, how rude! After the 4th or 5th time asking if we were done, she just came and put down our check when again, we were STILL EATING.  Don't get me wrong, the place is great and the food is amazing, but the service was terrible. Hopefully next time, I'll have a different waiter."
Angela U.,"Berwyn, IL",121,270,52,5.0,4/14/2008,"This is one chain restaurant that you are guaranteed the food will be the same quality, no matter which state you are in. Huge portions. Great for parties, but be ready to wait, they are in very high traffic areas of the tourist trade."
Nick S.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",34,322,10,2.0,11/1/2008,"I genuinely like the Cheesecake factory, but I don't like the Woodfield mall location.  You could tell they were just trying to fill the space and I seem to wait here longer than at any other location, which is annoying.   I live 5 minutes away and i would insist on driving to Oak Brook, instead."
Kristin C.,"Chicago, IL",355,538,11,2.0,3/5/2007,"As far as chain restaurants go, I am not a fan.  I have heard good things about the food here, or at any Cheesecake Factory for that matter.  My boyfriend took his sister here for her birthday because she likes it and it is also half way between where they live ( I was pumped to be invited because I am all about family hangouts.  AND I like free b-day meals, who doesn't?  Hehe). The line of people waiting was daunting on a Sunday - reminds me why I avoid the Suburbs like the plague.  Surprisingly, the bar was empty so I parked it there and enjoyed the friendly bartender and the no-Children scene.  I had three bloody mary's (oops).  They weren't bad but definitely not spicy enough for my taste.   For my meal I had the soup/sandwich/salad combo.  Nothing had flavor except for the soup that tasted like melted Velveeta.  My boyfriend's sister got a sandwich and specifically asked to remove the onions and peppers.  They didn't.  BUT our waitress was VERY understanding and helpful.  She came back with a free salad and a new sandwich in a flash.  For dessert we tried the Oreo mudslide cheesecake.  It wasn't too memorable (this is kind of disturbing at the Cheesecake Factory, no?).   Even though this place runs like a well-oiled machine, you won't find me back here anytime soon.  If you have to put up with a restaurants ""chainy-ness"" the food should be better than it is here."
Justin G.,"San Diego, CA",74,635,,4.0,11/9/2010,"Good place to eat, but make reservations on the weekend.  Cheesecake is really good, but better be at $7 per slice.  The menu is HUGE and has a lot of variety."
a w.,"Chicago, IL",22,1216,1279,5.0,11/20/2005,"Great location to go to for lunch or dinner. Its a spacious restaurant and there's plenty of seating. The food, of course, is wonderful and the dessert a must have. The service here is always fast and friendly."
