Jamie B.,"Chicago, IL",26,9,,3.0,3/11/2011,"I ate here last week with my husband.  The customer service was great so I feel really bad about leaving 3 stars, but I think the management needs to know.  After waiting 30 mins, which I didn't mind since I loooooove their food, we were finally seated.  I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times!  It's one of my favorite places to go!  I love their huge variety.  It was just this one time last Sunday.  I had their Chicken Alfredo and my husband had their Chicken Tacos.  Both were very bland.  They were so bad, I really really really wanted to send it back!  The only thing that stopped me was that awesome waiter and his excellent service.  I just couldn't give him a hard time.  I wish I knew his name, just to leave him a good review!  Why couldn't their dishes just taste as great as they always do!  What happened!"
Chrystina Z.,"Washington, DC",160,601,,3.0,7/25/2010,"I'm anti-chains (except for Walgreens) so I should not have eaten here, but when you're at Woodfield, no sense fighting it.  I must say, they make a good guacamole and cheesecake."
Katrina G.,"Elgin, IL",31,62,,3.0,9/12/2006,"The biggest con is definitely the wait.  It's usually ridiculous and forget about going during any kind of shopping season.    We go for lunch a lot, it's pretty decent at that time.   The salads are ginormous, but during lunch you can get a 1/2 order as with some of the pasta dishes as well.   The menu is huge, they've got a lot to pick from.   Oh, and did I mention the cheesecake.  Come on now, peanut butter cup cheesecake, just kill me now!   The slices are enough to share and there's always a seasonal special....I loved the pumpkin spice cheesecake featured last fall.  yum!"
Mike B.,"Naperville, IL",0,45,15,5.0,8/10/2010,"This place is fantastic. I've been coming here for years and have yet to try something I didn't like. How do they do that? From pasta to Chinese to steak, they have a huge menu with bigger portions. Save room and split an entree so you can eat the cheesecake!"
steve j.,"DeKalb, IL",2,40,,5.0,11/20/2012,This place never disappoints.  I love the chicken and shrimp gumbo.  The macadamia nut cheesecake is quickly becoming my favorite.  Can't get enough of it.
Varsha L.,"Chicago, IL",65,185,4,3.0,8/8/2007,I like the Southwest Salad(I think that's what it called?) and the Fries are really good! The Evelyn's Fav Pasta is good too.... I like the avocado egg rolls too but not sure if they still have it on the menu... It is pretty Chainy.... Huge portions....
jewelz O.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,3.0,9/7/2011,"The cheesecake has always been outstanding but I did not realize that food was so good.   Seven people, seven entres and appetizers equal  seven happy faces!"
Yvette C.,"Austin, TX",95,314,26,4.0,12/5/2008,There is always some kind of wait here since it's in the mall but well worth the wait. Great food with big portions at a reasonable price. Love their drinks but love the cheesecake even more. I can never finish it all but it's always good as a late night snack.
Eric M.,"Chicago, IL",11,389,4,4.0,8/18/2009,"Say what you will about a franchise, but good food + good service + good prices = good restaurant in my book. I've been to this chain many times before and this location doesn't upset. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio which is fabulous. I also couldn't leave without a slice of Banana Cheesecake. As many mention, the portions are bigger than Jon & Kate Plus Eight so be warned."
Jerry J.,"Arlington Heights, IL",9,3,,2.0,2/5/2011,"I went here with no expectations and an open mind. I had $100.00 in gift cards so price was not a consideration. I took my wife and 13 year old daughter. I had the Carne Asada steak, my wife had the farfale pasta with veggies, and my daughter had the shrimp scampi  We started out with the fresh made guacamole. First the guacamole was bland. No onion and very little flavor. The chips were good though. My Carne asada was OK nothing spectacular. My daughters shrimp scampi was flavorless and the pasta was dry 6 decent size shrimp were OK. My wife's pasta with a cream sauce was bland and needed to be doctored up with salt and pepper for flavor. The desserts were what people come here for. The red velvet cheesecake, the vanilla bean cheesecake and the Ice cream sundae were awesome! The food however lowered this rating. Service was excellent and the total bill for the day with 3 sodas was $106.00! I would only go there for dessert and eat your meal elsewhere."
Ken S.,"Gilberts, IL",0,11,1,1.0,2/27/2013,we had dinner there on 2/25. my wife and daughter got food poison. this is our first time got food poison from brand restaurant. pretty bad.
Allen L.,"Algonquin, IL",4,13,12,5.0,2/1/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Everytime I've gone the food has been amazing and service is great. The menu offers alot of variety for everyone and so far, each thing I've tried has been great. I enjoy the Bang Bang Shrimp Curry and Wild Mushroom Soup. Of course, the cheesecake here is one of the best...period. For the large portions you get, I think everything is reasonably priced. My servers have always been friendly and attentive despite the large volume of customers they receive each day. Overall, I think they run the place well and maintain consistent good tasting food. My only complaint is that there's always a wait to sit down, but that's the double-edge sword :)"

Mo k.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2012,"I have never been soo livid, after the experience I had at The Cheesecake Factory. For starters, it was my sons birthday, which in itself should be a joyous occassion. Being that I knew my party was going to be large, I figured I would call ahead to make a reservation. I spoke with Jesse, and was told that it was on a first come first basis. I thought that this was a bit peculiar, due to the size of my group, but I took her word for it. We arrived at 6:30, and we were told that since we had such a large party, that the wait would be an hour and a half. We waited for two hours, and still no table. After a while, I figured I would check on the status of the table, we were told that it would be ready shortly, as they had just finished up another party, and the aread was being prepped and cleaned. As if things couldn't get any worse, I then received the figurative smack in the face when I saw a group of 11 being seated after being there for less than 5 minutes. When I inquired how they got such V.I.P. treatment, the response was simple; ""because they had a reservation."" I'm not sure if I was speaking English when I called in at 1:30 in the afternoon to make a reservation; but apparently they pick and choose who they want to accomodate. I digressed though, so some minutes later, I went to check on the status yet again, now the hostess who was originally assisting us, had disapperead (how convenient). Another hostess came and got us, then we were escorted to the bar area, where a make-shift table was setup for us. Now, remember me stating that the whole purpose of us going, was for my CHILD'S birthday party. Why would they think it appropriate to place us in the bar with little children? Of course we were upset by having wasted soo much time, to be sat in some corner like peasants. In the midst of trying to figure out how such a mishap could occur, the manager comes out (at last some HELP...wrong!!!). The manager was actually worse than the people working for him, we were faced with an ultimatum: either we take the table or leave. To make matters worse, when I asked for his name, he told me ""You don't NEED to know my name, as a matter of fact leave right now!!"" Long story short we were essentially thrown out of Cheesecake Factory. I would like to thank all the staff that we came in contact with for ruining my son's birthday, maybe I'll be more patient and understanding the next time I come in, and wait for 3 hours or more to get sub-par service."
Valerie G.,"Des Plaines, IL",9,30,,4.0,1/24/2011,Food is delicious no matter what you order. There will usually be a wait time for you to be seated. Staff can be weird sometimes. They'll occasionally clean the walk ways which is kind of gross but it relieves me knowing they are clean!
Donna G.,"Schererville, IN",37,170,9,4.0,5/26/2007,"Between my co-worker and I, we spent $60 (with tip) on lunch here this week, but it was worth it. We started out with the calamari, and it came with this Delicious creamy garlic dipping sauce that I couldn't get enough of. He ordered he seafood salad, and I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad (thank God I did it was so fabulous). The tuna was seared with a wasabi flavored crust, but was rare on the inside and served aside a bed of spring greens tossed with a mild vinaigrette and avocado. Service was great, and we were lucky enough to sit in the bar, so no wait! I need more work excuses to come out here and expense lunch :)"
Melinda P.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",21,15,,2.0,3/25/2008,"My first time there and it was on a Saturday ""yikes!"" Hour and 1/2 wait!! I ordered ribs w/ fries (((YUCK))) The ribs were mostly fat & dry! The fries were dry and cold! I liked my husbands dish better. I would rather pick up a cheese cake than go through that again!!"
Peter F.,"Itasca, IL",2,92,,4.0,9/9/2006,"Another place like ""Wild Fire"" where the wait is exasperating enough to make a Monk pissed-off."
Stephen N.,"Roselle, IL",3,93,16,4.0,3/30/2008,"VERY good food.  You get what you pay for, but you pay more than you get, more often than not.  If you're going for a full-fledged dinner, be ready to shell out $20 per person.  Unless, you try to pull the salad and bread cheap-skating plan."
Sarah D.,"Matthews, NC",59,349,140,4.0,3/22/2006,See if you can get a seat by the front window overlooking the mall-great people watching seat! The Fire bacon shrimp sandwich is to die for and their salads are huge. There will be a wait if your party is more then 2 and maybe even then.
