Collette Y.,"Chicago, IL",0,33,1,5.0,1/22/2012,"I just came back from Cheesecake Factory and love it as usual. Servers are extremely attentive and eager to please. I don't eat cheesecake but here I'll make the exception because these cheesecakes ARE NO ORDINARY CHEESECAKES! Each one looks gourmet and beautiful and tastes just the same! You know how sometimes the looks of a dessert does not match the taste? Here, all are scrumptious!  I had a pulled pork sandwich which was the best I've ever had. The menu is so big anyone can find anything on it to suit them, whether large or small appetite or fat wallet or skinny wallet. Speaking of ""skinny"" , there is a special menu for those who want under 600 calories - check it out!  That will enable you to leave room for cheesecake! I always go around 11 AM. on a Sunday when there is no wait yet. In that way, I can decide whether I'll do breakfast, lunch or dinner at that moment. True, the prices are a bit steep, but you get what you pay for and I find the value worth it."

Joyce A.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",54,79,13,4.0,1/13/2008,"Yes, it is a chain- and no- there are no outside seats like the one on Michigan Avenue (I like to eat outside- weather permitting).  But there are some really neat little gems - and I ordered one the other day.  It was named the Luao chicken and it was served piled onto crispy wonton squares with a litlle bit of mango sauce which, for me, made the use of salad dressing unnecessary.  I really enjoyed this salad- not your ordinary chain chicken salad!  I made the mistake of ordering dessert- BIG mistake- you need several people to tackle the brownie - godiva chocolate ice cream plate- I really think that some restaurants on on the right track with offering mini versions of their desserts....although this is one really terrific dessert (definitely 5 stars), I doubt if I will order it again after a meal- unless I have several friends who want to help. I didn't care one way or the other about the decor- nothing special at all.  Janusz and I recieved excellant wait service- very friendly."
