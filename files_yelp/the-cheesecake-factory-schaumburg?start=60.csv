Kelly E.,"Streamwood, IL",37,26,17,3.0,5/17/2017,Really Cheesecake factory? Little baby pieces of fish in the tacos?! Smelled super fishy which is either old fish or cheap frozen fish. Cod really?! Yuck. If you want to charge $15 for fish tacos you might want to make it mahi mahi. Rice is a waste of time and beans had way too much salt and sugar.  Had a few bites wasn't even worth taking home as leftovers. At least the oat bread was good before lunch! Second visit in the last year and found that the food is just mediocre at best.
Eva V.,"Miami, FL",16,23,22,5.0,5/8/2016,"As always, outstanding service and food. The bacon bacon cheeseburger was OH MY GOD delicious (see photos) the dynamite shrimp appetizer was plentiful and delish! Thai lettuce wraps were fresh, crispy and seasoned to perfection (see photos) Our server was phenomenal. This location is all about customer service. Friendly, fast and accommodating. Salted Carmel cheesecake was outstanding. Hershey chocolate cheesecake was decadent and delicious. Awesome all around."
Howard L.,"Park Ridge, IL",54,1064,9128,4.0,6/28/2015,"We've always found Cheesecake Factory to be a reliable, quality chain with an extensive menu and an airy, vibrant, and upbeat dining environment.  This was our first visit here and this location was no exception.  They also had Lagunitas IPA on draft, so bonus points for that.  Our dinner party had the following and it was all good.  I also pre-checked on my saltiness concern for their  jambalaya pasta and server/chef had it prepared with no additional salt on the shrimp and chicken (it was perfect!): - Renee's chicken salad sandwich and soup - Jambalaya pasta - Chicken Bellagio - Fried catfish We also saved room for delectable slices of mango key lime and banana cream cheesecake.  Service as alluded to was good and attentive, and the place is actually and deceptively quite massive.  Reservations on the weekdays, but not weekends FYI."
Samir K.,"Chicago, IL",10,7,39,5.0,6/24/2016,It's usually crowded on weekends. Please make reservations ahead.  Good for Sunday brunch!!!
Sarah K.,"Des Plaines, IL",59,2,1,1.0,7/28/2017,"Awful service by our waitress Elizabeth. Not once did she stop by our table without being asked. No refills. Nothing. Which was very different from the treatment she was giving to the table next to ours . I tried to wave her over 5 TIMES and was ignored. She didn't even come around to collect our check at the end. Very very disappointed. It was my friends birthday and all the other tables were getting sung to except ours. I myself am a waitress as well, I have never in my life not left tip. However when she walked by me, ignoring all eye contact, when I was obviously holding out the bill for her to collect I got very upset and scratched out the tip and left the restaurant. Will not be returning unless I'm getting cheesecake to go"
Sabreena S.,"Chicago, IL",218,3,,2.0,7/28/2017,"I love the cheesecake factory but I got really sick eating their ""chicken littles"". They're supposed to be spiced but we're really bland"
Jim N.,"Northfield, OH",4,80,8,4.0,6/30/2017,I enjoy the superfood salads that are now offered especially the vegan cobb. I ordered some falafel as a side to go with my salad. All the ingredients are whole and wirh dressing on the side I can use it sparingly.  The service is always good even when sitting at the bar.  I normally go here for dinner once when I travel to rhe area.
Kara T.,"Carol Stream, IL",77,65,116,2.0,12/14/2016,"We were here a couple of Friday's ago after some Christmas shopping.  We came here because we had a gift card and decided to get dinner.  After our experience here, I would probably do drinks and cheesecake in the future. The menu is huge, and the food here is just OK. I remember everything tasting a lot better when I was little. I got a Mac and cheese burger and my husband got a buffalo chicken sandwich. They have a lot of chicken pasta dishes but most are between 15-20 dollars. The woodfield restaurant is pretty big, but they seat you right on top of the people around you and you basically feel like you're at ihop.  The bathrooms were really gross. They hadn't been attended to in a long tim and were out of products.  I would probably skip a meal here and only go if I had a gift card again."
T ..,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,10/13/2017,"We visited this location in Sept 2017.  I ordered the pork chop (which I've had at the Old Orchard location and it was delicious).  The pork chop was overcooked, dry and flavorless.  The mashed potato and broccoli were good.  My sister ordered the lettuce Mexican tacos.  Part way through her meal, she thought there may be cabbage on the tacos (she is allergic to cabbage - think food poisoning symptoms).  The menu did not show cabbage was in this meal.  She asked the waitress (Jessica) and she confirmed with the kitchen it was cabbage.  She apologized and asked if she wanted to order a different meal.    Jessica was nice, asked if my sister was ok and was apologetic.  Our meal was ruined, as we had to leave immediately; not to mention the illness to come for my sister.  We asked to speak to the manager. Enter Chad Grimes, store manager.  (Who, by the way, should secure a job that does not require him to interact with customers.)  He walks up to the table and asks - ""Are we the table with the tacos and is allergic to cabbage?"".  Without a response, he continues to state with ZERO sincerity or even the slightest inflection in his voice, ""I'm sorry.""  Obviously he was not sorry, but I would've expected him to pretend a bit more effectively.  A conversation recap - we expressed concern that cabbage was not listed in the menu nor would one expect cabbage on a Mexican taco.   We acknowledged that it's certainly not his fault, but perhaps this should be addressed with the appropriate person at the corporate level.   His responses with profound apathy - not all ingredients are listed, this has been discussed with corporate and there's nothing he can do.  Of course he would not charge us for the taco dish that made my sister ill.  We paid for my bland pork chop and left.  It's too bad that we'll never go to this restaurant again.  Had Chad been able to demonstrate that he cared at least a little bit and offered something of value to maintain the customer relationship - we may have given the place another try.  Poor Chad, stuck in a job that requires him to work with people."
Tom L.,"Chicago, IL",0,35,,4.0,10/12/2017,Just updating I appreciate management caring enough for their customers and  sending a gift card to cover the cheesecake.
Jen H.,"River Grove, IL",9,105,12,3.0,4/24/2017,"Wait for seating is always 20+ minutes, wait to order is 10+ minutes, and wait for food is 20+ minutes.. They have a lot of options everything has been good, they have a separate ""skinny"" menu, and small plate options. I do really like the cheesecake as a person who doesn't like regular cheesecake. My Hubby who loves regular cheesecake, does not like their cheesecake."
Patrick N.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",193,4,1,5.0,10/8/2017,"This is always a good choice if you're in the area. Theres a variety of food choices off the menu and the goto dish that I love is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta! And of course, you have to get their cheese cake. It's delicious and by the time you're done you want more!"
Maryam I.,"Orlando, FL",100,167,750,4.0,3/26/2015,"Service can be hit or miss, but tonight's service  was great! The food is consistently good. Tried the tuna carpaccio appetizer, followed by bang bang chicken and shrimp (I got shrimp only as I feel the chicken is too dry) and my parents had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. We ended the meal with a warm apple crisp a la mode. Yummm!"
Clara S.,"Chicago, IL",324,580,917,5.0,7/16/2015,"This is one of my favorite chains. Portions are always huge (who doesn't want more food?), service is always very friendly and professional, and the complimentary pumpernickel bread is on point!! I only ordered the red sangria when I was here today, but I've been here plenty of times and never really had a complaint. If you prefer less saucy dishes then the skinnylicious menu is great! Their menu is endless so you will not run out of options either. Be sure to get some cheesecake obviously too!  Will be back here soon- as always!"
Nathan B.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",0,46,,5.0,9/24/2017,Love this place. It is always busy on weekends. We tend to come here during the week. Obviously their cheese cake is awesome. We get the strawberry cheese cake all the time. Strawberries are fresh. The our just the right amount of whip cream on top. Portion size is perfect.
Nikki S.,"Chicago, IL",31,208,48,4.0,3/26/2016,"Really like this location. I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over the US and this is one my favorites. Our server was more than attentive and made our much needed date afternoon go smoothly.  I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp to start with. It was ok. The shrimp were cut into small strips and battered with some of the tails still on. It was hard to tell which ends had the tails.  I decided to try one of their loaded toast options. I went for the typical tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. The dish was a bruschetta on steroids and delicious to boot. We were too full to order cheesecake. I guess next time."
Eric M.,"Hanover Park, IL",30,19,9,3.0,7/29/2016,"Came in for cheese cake take out. Happened to be half price cheese cake day.  Waited over 50 minutes and still waiting for my cheese cake. Food is good, but I wish they plan the half price event better.  The wait is ridiculous"
John L.,"Glendale Heights, IL",9,58,2,2.0,4/10/2017,"Funny, the business manager responded to many reviews but not mine. I guess they know there's no excuse for misleading their customers when tabulating gratuity."
Branden B.,"Racine, WI",0,5,,5.0,9/25/2017,"Absolutely love cheesecake factory. The service is phenomenal, the food is exceptions. My favorite dish is the four cheese pasta with chicken. I always get the Raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake. I would highly recommend."
Marq C.,"Schaumburg, IL",599,328,686,4.0,4/4/2015,"4 stars for awesome taste and selection of cheesecakes, their 10,000 item menu (with diet conscious section), servers are attentive and friendly, and location! This Woodfield location is always busy and they don't let you wander inside the mall while you wait.   MUST HAVE: Hershey's cheesecake (combination of chocolate cake and cheesecake with chocolate icing and mini kisses to cover--- TO DIE FOR! Only if you like chocolate), tamale (appetizer), their pastas are very tasty too! My fave is Southwest Chicken Chipotle! Enjoy!"
