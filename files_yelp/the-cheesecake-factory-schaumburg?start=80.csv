Jennifer K.,"Franklin Park, IL",91,106,78,5.0,1/21/2017,My friends and I meet here once a month. Always wonderful service and the food is SO good. We have never had a bad meal there. And of course we never leave without some cheesecake :) but im writing this review bc my friends and I were overwhelmed by the workers and manager there.  My friend got very ill during dinner and I had to call 911. The paramedics came and took her to the hospital. My two friends and I were going to pay for her portion of the bill but our waitress informed us that the manager took care of her entire bill. We offered again to pay and they refused that it was already taken care of. We were in shock that they did that for her . The manager took our friends and my name and number down so they could report the incident but also they called her the next day to ask her how she was doing and sent her a gift card. AMAZING !!!! I cant even say how awesome that was of them bc they didnt have to do any of that but they did it bc they wanted to. I cant even put to words how kind hearted the employees are at the Cheesecake Factory . If i could give them 20 stars I would . And the simple act of kindness of calling her is absolutely amazing ps . Our friend recovered and is doing well
Shalonda A.,"Aurora, IL",1,5,,1.0,5/4/2017,"I use to LOVE this location. Recently the level of customer service has taken a downward spiral. Went here for my daughter B day. The waiter never acknowledged to say Happy Birthday. The silverware and table were dirty. Told the manager  about our experience and he said, ""I will tell them to change the dish water"" All I can say is WOW"
Angela R.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,27,,4.0,4/26/2017,"I cannot express how much I love this restaurant! The food is top quality and great sized portions. This restaurant is 99.9% of the time my go-to dinner place for my birthday. I have only had one bad experience here: this past birthday I came here at 9:30pm and the service was awful. Our waiters switched after us getting there and our second waitress was awful. She was inattentive, and hardly ever came by our table since we were seated all the way in the back. WE DIDNT GET TO LEAVE UNTIL MIDNIGHT! Because she took so long getting back to us with the bill, we thought she forgot about us! Any time we asked her for a refill or anything else we needed, she took 15+ minutes getting it back to us. It was ridiculous. Other than that experience, everything is great about this restaurant."
Marcus K.,"Schaumburg, IL",2,6,,1.0,3/30/2017,"Ordered Pasta with Italian Sausage, breaded chicken strips and fries during lunch.  My stomach hurts.  Why in the hell was everything so ridiculously greasy?  Please check yourselves before you make other people sick."
Deena H.,"Forest Park, IL",277,651,6363,3.0,8/4/2015,"Growing up this was a frequent spot for my crew and I to hit up on a Friday night. This location is always PACKED.  You will wait for at least half an hour. Go shop at macys while you wait. It's right next door. The parking is available but if it's busy, you will park very very far.  The restaurant is not as big as other cheesecake factories. The service is adequate and the food is the same as any other location.  The bathrooms are fairly clean. All in all an average experience in a very busy area. Be ready to wait. So good thing is, by the time you get your table, you will be hungry enough to lick your plate clean.  That is all."
Trent P.,"Chicago, IL",36,3,12,5.0,4/3/2017,Had a $60 to-go order. It was ready in 15 minutes and was delicious. They accidentally left off a piece of the order but corrected it swiftly and professionally.  I very much recommend this location.
Maribel M.,"Maywood, IL",0,10,,2.0,6/18/2017,"If you like very salty food, you'll love this place---verything in this place is very salty!  Sent my meal back twice and then changed it to something else, it didn't help. I asked if they could make he dish low salt and was told that they really couldn't as the sauces etc were pre-made.  Pre-made overly salted.  Rule of thumb, you can add salt at the table but you can never remove it!"
Ashley S.,"Elmhurst, IL",67,45,38,5.0,8/24/2016,"I am always happy when I leave this place. It's always clean, and has awesome service and food you can count on. The food is always tasty, warm and overly filling. It might be a tad expensive but the portions cover the price well. Most of the time I leave with a container to go. Friday's and weekends they are very busy I recommend coming early or you might have to wait. Holiday time is so crowded but that is to be expected. I recommend the Veggie Burger and the pasta dishes."
Jessica H.,"Wyoming, MI",10,13,,4.0,3/22/2017,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints -- the menu is HUGE and makes it difficult to choose, but also gives you plenty of options. If going at lunch time get the lunch portion and you'll still have leftovers for dinner!"
Samantha E.,"Chicago, IL",84,101,77,5.0,3/14/2017,This has to be one of the best Cheesecake Factory locations I've ever visited. The staff in the front was very professional and courteous and our server Megan was top notch. She attended to every detail and request we had. We even had a 14 month old baby with us and she unexpectedly brought us out a small plate of sliced bananas. It was such a great gesture. If we could have her on every visit we'd be so delighted!! Keep up the good work :)
K W.,"Villa Park, IL",30,5,,2.0,8/10/2017,"Very loud atmosphere .  Very rushed vibes by the waitress, not very nice, I would describe her as passive aggressive. Not impressed with the service over all. The only saving grace were the friends with me, the avocado egg rolls and cheesecake."
Rod C.,"Woodridge, IL",153,231,203,4.0,11/19/2015,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, you get a good meal, unlimited water and Diet Coke, cheesecake and coffee! I recommend my go to lunch order: Chicken Salad Sandwich with a Diet Coke, Crazy Carrot Cheesecake and a coffee!  Yes you will be raising your sugar intake but you didn't go to the CF to diet? This location is similar to all of the others, always busy and good service."
D. H.,"Memphis, TN",2,38,31,4.0,7/17/2016,"The food was delicious although it did not come out as I ordered. I enjoyed the experience. I order the teriyaki chicken with fries and had a strawberry lemonade to drink. The waiter seemed impatient, but other than that the dining was good as always."
Andrea H.,"Palatine, IL",150,87,69,4.0,11/6/2015,"Went here tonight for yet another lovely girls dinner with my friends. This is the second time we've chosen The Cheesecake Factory as our meeting spot and we were once again not disappointed. We had first gone to the one in Oakbrook but our experience here wasn't too much different.  I've been to this location a few times and there's always been a wait. This time it was about 55 min and they told us it would be 40. Now I totally understand that you can't force people to get up and leave but it was a long wait and it was already 7pm so we were hungry! I wish the bar area was bigger so we could have a drink or they had that new technology where they could text us that our table was ready so we didn't have to wait on the buzzer. (We couldn't shop while we waited because the range wasn't far enough) Anyway! Aside with my annoyance with the wait everything else was great! Our waiter Gareth, I believe was his name? Was awesome and he had a cool accent which my friend loved and he was very patient with my weird food requests which I'm sure are annoying so thank you! He also went on break during our dinner so we had a fill in waitress for our table and she was very nice as well so we got lucky! We had the Simosas to start and both my friends got the BLTs which were huge and I had the Mac and Cheese burger. My beef patty was a little more cooked than I wanted but still totally edible and not worth the fuss of sending it back. Their sweet potato fries are my favorite! Good dinner and very friendly service. The only reason they're getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm a brat and don't like waiting that long, we got there at 6:45 and didn't leave till 9:30, I wish they took reservations because we knew 3 days ahead of time we'd go there but otherwise everything was awesome. Get the cheesecake too obviously!!"
Dinah T.,"Mount Prospect, IL",228,305,4058,5.0,3/14/2016,"After all these years, the Cheesecake Factory is still one of my favorites chain restaurants.  Place still gets packed and waiting area looks like we're a bunch to sardines, especially the weekend. They still have a pager system, wish they had a cellphone text system so you can walk around the mall but you can estimate how long your wait will be so time it well. Once we got seated, we were treated by our server quickly very nice and attentive lady. She made sure our drinks were filled and our food is served in a timely manner. Even when the dessert was running behind she apologized to us but letting us know it's coming out soon. We were given sweet honey oat and sour loaf bread at the table.  Both were good too tempting to ask for more. Hubby got a beer and I got a drink cocktail, a pineapple Moscow mule. You can definitely taste the pineapple flavors with a half sliced fresh pineapple. It came with a very tall glass. I would get this again it's flavors are very tropical and sweet. For my dish, I ordered the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta very good this is my favorite dish on the menu. Plenty of pasta some are veggie pasta and others are plain topped with a spicy jambalaya sauce chopped onions and bell peppers with plum tomatoes with a couple of whole shrimp and chunks of chicken breast.  Hubby got his usual the shepherds pie dish. Well seasoned chunks of ground beef with a mixture of finely shredded Zucchini, carrot sticks and peas topped with the creamy mashed potatoes. Very hearty. Their portions here are plenty that you can take home unless you're very hungry then eat up my friend enjoy! Both dishes came to us piping hot, excellent! To end a great meal, we both shared a huge slice of dolche de leche cheesecake! It has a lighter texture than your typical cheesecake. It also came with two huge whip cream tops and with chopped nuts and toffee. Wow delish! Again,overall a great experience and the flavors and the amount of food is still the same as I remembered coming here last time. I will definitely come back again."
L.S. C.,"Barrington, IL",1,296,539,3.0,1/4/2017,"This is a great place for lunch and dinner.  We love the brown bread and the green tea ice tea.   The Chinese chicken salad (lunch) is huge.  Service is prompt and attentive.  The cheesecake is to die for.  One caveat,  you need to come when it opens.  There is a wait majority of the time."
Micki E.,"Downers Grove, IL",0,109,,2.0,2/4/2017,The place was jammed and it was nearly impossible to pick up our carry out. We got home and our slices of cheesecake were small slivers. Wow we always eat in the mall location and usually the food is good and the portions are big. Today it seemed like our pieces of cake were so small that there wasn't enough to share like we always do. Now the cheesecake is good but those 2 slices are about $17 so they really need to bring back the bigger portions. The dinners were good and we enjoyed our meal but the cheesecake slices really bummed us out. Maybe they could leave off all the extra whipped cream and toppings and save some money there.
Claudia M.,"Schaumburg, IL",79,5,,1.0,2/1/2017,"I have never walked out of a restaurant mid-service  before. Working in the fine dining industry, I've become very understanding when it comes to getting bad service. Sometimes, the server truly can't keep up and I can tell when that's the case. I get it.  However, the service we got here tonight was just unacceptable. We were seated in a crowded area in the bar side where it was incredibly noisy; we couldn't hear each other even at a shouting level. 5 minutes go by and our server comes over (doesn't even introduce himself) and takes our drink order. He comes back with drinks about 5 minutes later and walks away without saying a word. Another 5 minutes goes by and he brings bread (which was awful by the way. Hard, cold bread and frozen butter? Not a great mix. Not his fault though) and leaves before we can tell him we would like an appetizer. We sat there in silence for 20 minutes and there was still no sign of our server. Again, we still haven't been able to order ANYTHING besides our drinks after being here for 40 minutes now. We left a $5 bill for the drinks and left."
Gabriela C.,"Dallas, TX",39,39,,5.0,10/20/2016,Really nice Cheesecake Factory in a beautiful location. The Oreo cheesecake is absolutely delicious and highly recommended!
Sammi C.,"Chicago, IL",417,65,104,5.0,3/28/2016,JUST A REVIEW OF THE CHEESECAKE!! Delicious and decadent cheesecake that you won't be able to finish in one sitting. You won't find better cheesecake anywhere else. Their Oreo cheesecake and Godiva Cheesecake is absolutely to die for. I always come to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert with my friends.
