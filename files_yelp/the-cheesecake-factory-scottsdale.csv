Alicia G.,"Phoenix, AZ",1018,432,2186,5.0,1/5/2018,"I have had the opportunity to dine here a few times while I am in the area. I am impressed that each time the level of service I receive is superior.  The menu is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. The one thing I can say about this restaurant chain is they are consistent. The food I love to order taste the same whether I am in Las Vegas, Dallas, California or where ever I may be. I have faith my food will be just as good. I tend to dine off the Skinnylicous menu. Many options that taste great but only have less calories. Especially since that warm bread tends to make up for what I cut out. The last time I dined there was a few days ago with my friends daughter. I ordered the Asian Tacos off the Skinnylious menu. My friends daughter ordered the Kids Salmon with Mash Potatoes and Carrots. We were stuffed so no room for all the delicious desserts. The staff from the hostess, greeter, server, and wait staff were super friendly."
Andy F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,88,1,1.0,12/13/2017,"They have an extensive menu and the food is good.  The bad service, though, sinks this restaurant.   It's relegated to a carry-out option only. I've been to a number of locations around the country and they're usually good and finally decided to try this one in our back yard during a weekday to celebrate my birthday.  The service was very slow, despite being fairly empty.  The server couldn't care less that it was my birthday.  Didn't bring a cheesecake menu when asked and didn't bring a candle or anything.   We could hear and see other birthday celebrations at other tables.  This server just didn't seem to like us as she chatted up other tables with her life story while ignoring us sing 'Happy Birthday.'  We even asked afterwards about getting anything complimentary or a candle and got a nonsense answer about only with other desserts.  If not for a birthday, we wouldn't be there and certainly wouldn't order dessert.    It was really a let-down. I called the manager later, who was equally uninterested in making anything right.  She said she'd talk to the server about their policy and hoped we'd come in for future birthdays.   Absolutely NOT!  There are so many better options nearby."
Lauren D.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",1,83,12,4.0,11/29/2017,"Cheesecake has a pretty extensive menu which is what keeps it in my rotation of go-to chains. There is something for everyone on the menu, so it's great for larger groups. Mexican, Asian, American and Italian inspired dishes cover the pages.  I'm not one to watch my diet but they do have gluten free options and a ""skinnylicious"" menu that are not limited to one or two items. You get selection there too.  I've always had solid service here. When it's busy things may be a tad slower but they deliver and are attentive.  While I've had good salads, burgers and appetizers here, this time I opted for the shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Wow! Definitely my new favorite. You get to taste both of these entrees and a pile of mashed potatoes separates them. YUM! The cheesecakes are all pretty amazing. For a chocolate/PB fan, Adam's Peanut Butter Pie is the go to move. I deviated and got the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake this visit and while it was good, I'll definitely go back to Adam's next time. Again, there is something for everyone even on the dessert menu."
Jennifer F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,103,48,4.0,12/10/2017,"Stopped here for lunch while bike riding. Sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer is amazing. Delicious! I had the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and it was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. My hubby had the fried chicken sliders. Both great. We were too full for dessert. Service was amazing. Even though it's a chain, the food and service are impeccable."
Ritu D.,"Mississauga, Canada",23,107,245,4.0,10/25/2017,"Came for lunch after a long hike on the cholla trail of camelback mountain. We were so parched and our thirst was adequately satiated by their sweet and flavourful lemonades (free refills). Hubby and I shared the antioxidant salad and the half portion was perfect for me for lunch. Hubby and son shared the sliders (4 sliders per order) and the potstickers. That was just enough to satisfy them enough in order to share a piece of white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Everyone was happy with our food and drinks. The restaurant was not crowded as we arrived around 1:30 on a Wednesday. The restaurant and washrooms were clean and the server was friendly and attentive. We can always count on the Cheesecake Factory for a satisfying meal and I like that they offer healthy options. For gf, vegan dessert you can order a bowl of strawberries. The bill was $60.47 for the 3 of us pre tip."
Danette W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",108,181,301,5.0,12/12/2017,"You know sometimes its not always about the food but about the customer service.  I wanted to give Cheesecake Factory a huge shout out for an amazing dining experience on a Saturday evening.  I came in stressed that my party of seventeen wouldn't be able to get seating.  I was greeted by the manager who took it upon herself to find two potential tables for me and to let me know about how soon those tables would clear for my party.  Just as she said the table I had decided upon was cleared and ready when all of my friends arrived.  I don't remember the waitresses name unfortunately, but she was awesome.  We were greeted right as we were seated and given bread.  The menus were already at the table waiting for us.  Soon after she took our drink order and then dinner requests.  The food came out in a very timely manner and temperature of the food was perfect.  Once we were done with our dinner, the table was cleared and we were given dessert menus.  Something I need to highlight, our waitress made sure to tell us before we ordered dessert what items were no longer available.  Such forward thinking on her part and the restaurant.  All of our requested desserts came without delay.  When it was time for the checks (we were asked when we were seated if the checks would all be separate), all were received and given to all the right people.  This kind of service should be applauded.  Thanks Cheesecake factory and my amazing server for an awesome experience."
Charles D.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",83,320,295,4.0,7/29/2017,"Here it is date night with my better half. Arrived around 6 PM on a Thursday night and the place was busy. We were immediately seated which was nice. My wife ordered Ahi Tuna Salad and I ordered the Truffle-Honey Chicken. I forgot that the chicken comes boneless,shucks. I left the crispy chicken on the mashed potatoes too long and the bottom of the chicken had a soggy coating. Overall, it was a great meal and my wife enjoyed her salad. Of course, we'll be back."
Esti S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",88,230,24,3.0,7/6/2017,"I liked their food, recently moved from CA to AZ and love to celebrate my b-day. We both had a steak, my partner had Diane steak which was delicious and I had the Steak from the skinny menu. Both dishes were yummy. Here what I got very disappointed the cheesecake with the tiramisu was not what I used to have, hardly any tiramisu did not test like one in CA."
Joanna S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,4,5.0,1/1/2018,"My husband and I came here for lunch New Year's Day , Andrew went above and beyond, and even though we were picky he was patient and made recommendations. I wasn't sure if I would like the drink I picked but he assured me I made a good choice and he was right! Food was delicious!"
Amy Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",86,254,727,2.0,5/14/2017,"Came here for Mother's Day brunch with family of ten, obviously is not my choice ( someone in my family responsible for this). The food was blend and I noticed each of our food on the plates either yellow or white except the arugula and beet salad was the most colorful on the plates. The white chocolate cheese cake was OK, very high calories. Our waiter is so nice and helpful, so I'll give him 2 stars, but sorry dude the food wasn't my favorite at all."
Dee Jay R.,"Vancouver, Canada",7,18,28,4.0,12/23/2017,"Favorites : shrimp and chicken gumbo, steak Diane, chicken pot stickers, factory burger, ultimate red velvet cheesecake"
Patricia B.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,335,363,3.0,2/16/2017,"Chicken Little is actually a massive plate of chicken. Service was so-so, but for the second time in just a handful of visits we got the salad after the meal. No apology, no explanation, just very casual they bring the Caesar Salad when you are half done with your food. Well, at least we got it, on a recent visit to the Biltmore location I never got my side of veggies... no discount, full price, and I did not get my side... We may come back eventually but I think for now our money is better spent somewhere else."
A Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,14,,1.0,12/10/2017,"We've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times since living in Scottsdale and sadly will not be returning. Tonight we decided to eat here for my daughter's birthday and we all left extremely disappointed.  Our waitress started off not wanting to be at work and very short with her words. She then reminded us several times that she has been working all day and very tired.  For drinks, my husband and I ordered coffees only to have my husband's coffee come to the table full of grounds, not a little bit of grounds, but a lot! We asked for a different cup and simply never got one.  When my husband's starter salad came out he ate half of it only to find a very large dark hair in it. He stopped eating it and we told the waitress. The manager then came out and apologized and offered another salad. Which we turned down.  When our daughter's kids meal (spaghetti) came out it had a large black ""thing"" in it, which we noticed right away. So the waitress took the plate away and simply never came back with our daughter's food.  After an hour at the table, our daughters ended up eating my husband's food since the spaghetti plate was never returned.  The waitress apologized for all the troubles and said ""they"" would make it right. We were unsure what that meant so we didn't specifically ask how.  When we got the bill, ""they"" took off our daughter's spaghetti kids meal (but JUST the spaghetti as we still had to pay for her kids drink) and mind-you she never even got her meal back to actually eat. My husband left hungry and thirsty and the whole family upset about the experience.  We honestly are the type of people who would come back as mistakes do happened. But this time we felt no one really cared about all the mistakes. Especially our waitress, who acting like she was just simply ""too tired"".  No more birthday meals here that's for sure. :("
Max L.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",0,21,10,1.0,7/23/2017,"Firstly I must mention to you that my family and I, go out for eats at least twice a week. Cost is not an issue.  Today, my daughter, and I decided to go to Kierland Cheesecake Factory, as we wanted to eat traditional American cuisine.  We arrived 2:30pm. Restaurant was not busy at all. We were seated promptly at Table 71. It took over 15 minutes before we were greeted by our server. He was not friendly at all, and had an unpleasant looking on everyone he was a server to.  The service was absolutely disappointing, at best. In addition to our own server (Blaine), other staff that walked by could hardly notice us when we wanted something (drink refills, the bill, take home containers, etc. When Blaine FINALLY brought take home containers to our table, he threw"
Erica B.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,237,77,3.0,9/12/2017,"After a night of talking, listening to music and chillaxing with friends.  Around 11ish, about 11:15 to be exact, we got really hungry.  We all had the taste for pizza and wings.  We tried to order from the Streets of New York but they closed at 10 unfortunately.  So we decided to order take out from the Cheesecake Factory.  Can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.  It's been one of my favorite chain restaurants for yearsssssssssss.  I've never, ever ordered take out ever! It was 3 of us.  I ordered the tomato basil pasta.  My friend ordered a creamy pasta dish with bacon and peas.  My other friend ordered a black bean dish with shrimp and chicken.  I'll start with describing my dish.  BLAND!  My goodness it was bland!  I could taste every ingredient separately, the noodles, the basil, the tomato sauce and the garlic, but there was no season.  It lacked regular salt and pepper.  My friend's shrimp and black bean curry dish did NOT have any black beans in it what so ever.  The curry sauce also didn't taste like much.  This is one of the 2 dishes my friend frequently orders so he was for sure it didn't taste the same.  My other friend's dish was just as bland.  We're all almost for certain that the reason behind the bland food was the fact that there were near closing time.  This no excuse for sure and was highly disappointing.  Of course I'll try this Cheesecake Factory location again, maybe even take out, just not within an hour of them closing."
Dan H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,34,9,1.0,1/2/2018,"Come on guys. I ordered a salad to go...minus a couple ingredients and what do they do? Separate half the ingredients in one container, mix the ingredients I didn't want in with the salad in another container and....what was the point. And I tipped the take out cashier. Give me a break. The end of a longgg day, paid a premium for a salad that you can't even get right. Seriously?"
Letha D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,9,1.0,9/22/2017,"The cheesecake recipe has changed. The service was surly and slow. My sever barely spoke to me. I felt sad. The cake is foamy and not creamy anymore. A sad disappointment all around. The music outside was good. It was R&B. It's so nice of the corporate arm to respond to me. I still recall how the server served me under my arm behind me, as if to hide his face. He didn't check on me after that underhanded serve. I still feel sad about that decision to go there and try to have fun.  When the surly waiter discovered that all I wanted was a piece of cheesecake, he became pushy and then, dismissive.  You're known for cheesecake. You even made up your own recipe for cheesecake, if my mouth is a good food sleuth. I used to go to a cafe at the Ritz Carleton on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and just have dessert. Plenty of people go to a place for a dessert course. Your waiter was too poorly trained to be aware of that. He insulted me.   Thank you to The Cheesecake Factory for the nice apology."
German V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,25,14,4.0,12/4/2017,"This place is famous for its huge portions and, of course, cheesecakes. I used to love going there and eating a big bowl of the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya and then washing it down with a fat slice of cheesecake or Linda's Fudge cake. Nowadays, I choose to eat healthier and this place doesn't fit my needs anymore. Once in a blue moon I would stop in for a slice of cheesecake or Linda's, but even that became disappointing as it seemed their slices have gotten smaller yet their prices have gone up. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, but I think we're done."
Kirsten A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Beautiful place, absolutely horrible experience. After using the rest room I proceeded to wash my hands. The water was so extremely hot that it scolded my hands... I let a manager know and all they did was give me ice. So extremely thank fun that a child wasn't burned. Make sure you check the temperature of the water before you or your children wash your hands!!!"
Cindy C.,"Alexandria, VA",0,35,1,2.0,12/28/2017,Had the Renee's special for lunch and was in the bathroom the next couple of hours. Came at about 11:30 and already packed.
Russell Z.,"Fullerton, CA",1157,362,319,4.0,2/2/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory. With an extensive menu, what's there not to love? I went there on a  Monday, 01/30/2017, in the early evening. I started off the evening with a bourbon and honey drink which came out in a martini glass; apart from the style of the glass, I was a fan of the drink itself. For the entree, I had the chicken marsala and mushroom dish served over a bed of farfalle pasta. The flavors were all there, the smoothness of the butter and reduced alcohol with the broth all came together nicely. However, I was not a fan of the chicken texture itself. It seemed too... Soft. Almost as if the chicken wasn't entirely fresh, but not like it was spoiled or anything. Almost like the meat was cured or pounded or something, so it was softer in texture than would naturally occur. Maybe this is something that others enjoy, but I'm sort of not for it. One of the things that has always struck odd in my mind is how extensive the menu is. When a menu is as many pages as it is at Cheesecake Factory, and offers so much in variety, it makes you wonder how fresh the ingredients actually are. Is it all frozen? If so, does it justify the high price point? These are questions that Yelpers should ask themselves when they go places. Fundamentally, are you REALLY getting your money's worth? All in all, I had a good experience here. I may return, but the last time I set foot in a Cheesecake Factory before this was well before 2012. BTW, to the best of my knowledge, Cheesecake Factory does not accept Apple Pay or Android Pay. However, they have their own app called CakePay that you can download from the app store or the Google Play store. With the app you can do mobile payments at any Cheesecake Factory establishments to the best of my knowledge. Business owners, if I am incorrect in this assessment, let me know and I'll make the required adjustments on my review."
Cory S.,"Phoenix, AZ",689,93,134,4.0,1/5/2017,"Would it sound strange that I really like The Cheesecake Factory even though I really do not like cheesecake?  Well, the restaurant that I've frequented over the last few months has made that an easy decision for me!  In fact, it's another of my favorite happy hour locations in town.  It is only weekdays from 4-6 PM, but I've never had too long of a wait to get a space in the bar.  In fact, the only time I have waited was last night, when I had a group of six wanting to enjoy happy hour.  We got a pager and sat at the bar until the table was ready ten minutes later.   Between a visit a few weeks ago and last night, I have enjoyed the fried mac and cheese, the southern chicken sliders, and a salad for under $6 a full-size plate.  There were also many great drinks specials at the time.   While I've always been fortunate with parking at Kierland, one of the only challenges of The Cheesecake Factory is that they rarely take reservations.  I've lucked out the last two times though in the past, I have had to wait for a while for a table.  As long as you don't show up right between 6-7 PM on weekdays or during meal hours on weekends, you should be fine though.   I've always had fairly good service and delicious meals though unless it's happy hour, some meals may be a bit more on the pricey side.  But again...those fried mac and cheese balls.  Wow!"
Cristian O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",27,46,27,4.0,1/11/2017,"Parking here is a real challenge with or without valet service. Huge selection of food,  overwhelming if I may say so. I don't like the fact that the food is not consistent. Same food tastes different on different days.  Still good food and great dessert options"
Karen W.,"Tempe, AZ",858,2081,4108,4.0,5/9/2016,"I haven't eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in years. Usually if I want to eat out I'll go somewhere that's locally/independently owned but I had a gift card that had been sitting around gathering dust so I wanted to use it before I lost or misplaced it. I ordered from the to-go/dessert counter. The cashier was friendly and professional. He was very nice and offered a beverage (Water, iced tea, or soda) for me to sip on while I waited for my meal. He packaged my order very well and I was on my way in about 15 minutes. I had the lunch portion of herb crusted salmon and a carrot cake cheesecake. The lunch portion was huge. The salmon was tender, the asparagus was cooked al dente, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with some lumps of potato and some skin. My meal also came with a foil wrapped portion of bread with several pats of butter- nice! The cheesecake was your typical Cheesecake Factory quality. It was creamy, a good amount of sweetness, with a nice integration of carrot cake and cheesecake. I shudder to think of the amount of cardio I'll have to do to burn the amount of calories I just ate! My total for the lunch portion salmon and the cheesecake was slightly less than $25. Overall no surprises for the actual taste of the food, but service was top notch."
Swetha K.,"Syracuse, NY",29,75,246,4.0,12/12/2016,"Cheesecake Factory quality maintained! We ordered Fried Zucchini, Fried Mac n Cheese and a Mango Keylime Cheesecake. Hearty meal, good food and service. Will surely be making this a regular."
Annie W.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,64,2,3.0,10/8/2017,"I love the skinnylicius menu. Very tasty, reasonably priced, outdoor seating rocks. Very noisy inside and difficult parking. I've never had a food transportation specialist that is attentive to all and everything. They seem to be forgetful. I have to remind them of my request."
David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,4.0,7/1/2017,"I do not know what there is to not like. (Take that you high school English teachers!) Sometimes it takes a while to be seated. True all over the Valley these days. The servers are always friendly and check in frequently enough. The quantity of food is just stupid big. From burgers, to steaks, to Italian and Asian, the kitchen gets everything pretty much good enough. And the desserts. Wait for it... I simply cannot stand cheesecake. Hate it. Always have. So why Cheesecake Factory? Because the people I come here with love cheesecake. And, this place does it better than pretty much anywhere. For me, the chocolate cakes and brownie desserts do a fine job. The last brownie a'la mode I had, went home with me. Other than the ice cream which had to be eaten in the restaurant, the brownie last 3 more servings at home."
Gerry L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,15,1,5.0,10/7/2017,Always a great experience. By far The Cheesecake Factory is the best and has the most consistent quality for a chain. We were a party of 10 and the service was flawless.
Bryant N.,"Marion, ND",0,17,11,5.0,7/24/2017,"Great and fast service. My wife and I each got the fish taco, one got grilled and one got fried. Both were amazing! Each had their own taste, did not expect this. Grilled was slightly spicer. The beans were amazing and I hate beans! Rice was just cooked I personal would have liked it a little softer. If you like raspberry lemonade it is always a must at Cheesecake Factory"
Jack Y.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,69,100,3.0,5/25/2017,"Took my mom and aunt out for dinner. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. It was good. Not a cheesecake fan, wish they had chocolate cake. Dinner was ok, my sister did not get chicken parmesan, or they just don't make it like every one else. No sauce or cheese any where on her plate. Our waiter Habib was excellent! He did offer to take her plate back but we were hungry and she would have to watch us eat and then we would have to watch her eat. Mom ordered the orange chicken, had a taste it was good. I ordered the salmon, not bad. I would recommend the host be a little nicer, someone remind her she's a hostess not a model. Check out the photos."
Jeff W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",58,29,6,5.0,10/9/2017,"The ""go to"" for my family. Something for everyone and quality is solid every time. Eaten here a dozen or more times and have never been disappointed. Only minor drawback is it is a bit cold at times within the restaurant. If you are temp sensitive bring a light sweater or jacket."
Paige M.,"North Mountain Village, Phoenix, AZ",532,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,"My boyfriend and I were taken to our table and sat there for over 10 minutes before even being greeted by a single person. The server assigned to the section next to us ended up asking if we had been greeted yet and ended up getting our drinks for us. Our server still took another 2-3 minutes before making it to our table. She asked us if she could get us any water, I said yes and asked for no ice please. She acknowledged my request and said absolutely. My water came back with ice (not a big deal at all) but that is the ultimate server test to see if you're server is actually paying attention. I manage a very high paced restaurant myself and that would never fly with my servers. Not to mention it's not even busy in here. Most likely won't be coming back to say the least."
Jennifer A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,26,26,2.0,5/12/2017,"We went to the North Scottsdale location for my daughter's 18th birthday last night (5/11/2017).  We called to make a reservation for 15 people for 6:30pm when they opened at 11:00am, and were told they don't take reservations until 2:00pm.  I called back at 2:00pm and was told they only take reservations until 5:00pm.  I explained that we had 15 people coming for an 18th birthday dinner, so if they wouldn't take a reservation we may need to look elsewhere.  I was told that Thursday nights aren't busy, and if we showed up before 7:00pm we wouldn't have to wait more than a few minutes.  My daughter really wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory, otherwise I would have gone to a place that takes reservations.   Our large party showed up at about 6:20, and we were of course told it would be a while.  A party of 17 had just showed up right before we got there.  We had to wait in the crowded waiting area for an hour to be seated, and when we did it was very cramped.  Our servers did a great job considering there were so many of us, and the food was pretty good, but I think it's ridiculous to only take reservations during lunch/early happy hour time."
Thomas T.,"Phoenix, AZ",98,47,25,1.0,12/27/2016,"Most Cheesecake Factory's are just meh, they aren't really that good, but they'll do. However this specific location sucks! We made a reservation and arrived on time, only to be told we could not be seated because out server was late to work. Our server, when she arrived, got all of our orders wrong, both our drinks and meals....well shes human, and people have bad days, its totally understandable....I can get past that.  Now the food is what really made me say, ""fuck it, im never ever going back to any Cheesecake Factory again."" I decided to order the walnut chicken, and it was unbelievably salty! The cheesecake was also meh, and I really regret consuming these calories...IF Chessecake factory is your thing, go to a different location..."
Mdm D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,11,1,5.0,5/24/2017,The best Miso Salmon in town.  The service is excellent too.  If you're into sweets go for the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake :-)
Ray A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,17,,2.0,5/6/2017,We use to go there a lot but they started slipping. We tried it again today for brunch. I ordered a Skinnylicious Turkey Avocado Sandwich and it was bland and small. The salad was spinach leaves with a little dressing. Had to wait while they brewed us decalf. My wife ordered some slimy spring rolls and a salad which had too many Cucumbers. The bill with 20% tip was like $43 bucks!!!  Hate to give up on these guys because we use to have good meals there.
Elizabeth B.,"Goodyear, AZ",33,34,27,4.0,8/3/2017,"The service was a plus on this visit, along with the food.  We like the consistency.  This is a place my mother likes to eat at when she visits."
Natalia P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",38,83,947,1.0,11/14/2016,"So many choices these days and I feel disappointed for having picked Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner on a Sunday evening! What a mistake :( Requested to be seated in the patio outside since it was a beautiful day so we were taken all the way to the back right by the garbage and take out door!  Waitress gave us a very disappointing/poor service and the only reason I could think of would be that I didn't order a drink. I've noticed waiters attitude changes when you don't order something other than water!  The experience was very disappointing as I didn't feel like I could ask our waitress for anything without getting this spurious smile as if I'm an annoyance! This confuses me as I'm under the impression they work on TIPS!  They had the take out delivery guy pulling up right behind us every 10 minutes and the door opening and closing the entire experience, very annoying. If I ever decide to torture myself again and return to this place, I will be sure to ask for someone who enjoys their time at work and makes it a great experience for guests! I suggest customer service training for The waitress whose name rhymes with Bora"
Tiffany K.,"Sun City, AZ",128,12,37,5.0,3/2/2017,"Great service from the bar, Steak Diane is amazing, Old Fashion on point and the dessert OMG! Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake is to Die For. Worth every penny."
Rachel W.,"Elgin, IL",112,181,52,4.0,12/30/2016,Have an indecisive group of people with you? Have a group of people who want all different types of food? Cheesecake Factory has a large menu with different types of food. I came here for lunch with my mom during the holiday season. Luckily there was no wait (which never happens!) we were seated and waited on. Our server was great. The only negative is that it was really cold inside.
