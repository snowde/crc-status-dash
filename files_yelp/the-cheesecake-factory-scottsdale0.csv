H R.,"El Paso, TX",2,38,18,5.0,8/13/2014,I loved the rosemary chicken it was delicious...Anaheim Cheesecake Factory was delicious
Caitlin M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,5.0,11/14/2014,"I went here for my birthday and the service and food were great! I was upset because I walked away for a moment and when I came back my boxed up food had been thrown away. However I spoke with the manager and she was extremely nice and made me a whole new meal, and it seemed like she gave me more food than I had in the first place. Definitely going back to this restaurant again."
Tay M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",56,19,1,1.0,2/6/2016,"Walked into Cheesecake on a Friday night, 15 minute wait so that wasn't too bad. Once we were seated, the waiter took maybe 10 minutes to get us water, which wasn't a big deal considering it was relatively busy. Once it came time to order, I ordered what I usually love getting which is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.. When it came to our table, I took one bite and noticed that it wasn't quite right. The bun was toasted way too much, to the point where it was like biting into a burnt cracker. Also, there was maybe a pinch of buffalo sauce. Maybe. But I couldn't see it or taste it. So, naturally, I ask the waitress if they could take it back and make it again. She apologized and said she would be happy to have the cooks do that for me. What happens next was down right disgusting. She put my plate on top of someone else's dirty plate with half eaten rice and tomatoes on it, and brought my food back to the kitchen to be made again.. Or so I thought. They ended up just throwing another bun on it and sent my bitten-into sandwich back to me. One thing I learned from working in a restaurant, you never bring someone's food from the table, to the kitchen and back to the table again... You should always  prepare a new dish. After that I received no discount, no coupon, nothing but an apology for the burnt bun. Very grossed out and disappointed."
Julia I.,"Phoenix, AZ",47,38,19,5.0,6/18/2014,"I always love going to this place! The service is great. Even though it was pretty crowded, we were seated right away and our server was attentive and helpful. Had the meatloaf and it was really good and I had plenty of leftovers! And of course, I topped off the meal with a piece of cheesecake. I am always shocked at how huge their cheesecake menu is. I have never been disappointed with any of the cheesecake there."
Diego S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",128,364,13,4.0,3/6/2012,"It's Wednesday and that means one thing...poker night with the guys. But the last few weeks at this have been torturous, as you go home penniless, drunk, and now having to face your wife. And the worst part is how you'll probably lose again tonight. Well not tonight, Here's the plan. Stop off at the Cheesecake Factory before the game.  Order the four-cheese pasta, it's simply delightful. Have a couple beers to wash it down.  Now, sit back and let the magic happen. Of course you're going to lose at poker again tonight, but at least someone else is going to get tortured as your room-clearing farts decimate the place. Revenge is sweet, and Cheesecake can help you serve up a big steaming bowl."
Daniele L.,"Partanna, Italy",9,1,,1.0,8/10/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times before and have never received service so poor. Our server was Laura S. To start out we sat there without being prompted with any drinks for a good 6 minutes. Yes this seems petty but I work in a restaurant too and no customer sits there that long without drinks. She had managed to get to everyone else in her section before even coming back to ask us what drinks we wanted...which after we told her what we wanted she went back to talking for quite some time before we got them. To continue we asked for bread when we gave her our order for food and we didn't get it until after our appetizer arrived because it was in the oven....fine it was in the oven but she couldn't have came over while we were waiting for the bread/appetizer to come and tell us it was being made for us and it would be second? We had waved down another server while we were sitting there waiting and she ""went to go check on the bread"" but seems to me she just went and gossiped to Laura given that when Laura came back she was nothing but rude about where the bread was. Terrible tone of voice and everything. When food was ready she brought one plate out then like 5 minutes later the second plate and another minute or two later the last persons plate....normally you bring it all out at once.. After her rudeness about the bread she continued to have an attitude about God knows what and didn't even make eye contact or anything during any conversation...including ""have a nice day"" she just looked out the window.......great food as always but wow this service was absolutely terrible."
Briana O.,"Phoenix, AZ",77,82,3,5.0,6/14/2014,"One of my family's favorites! This location is usually pretty busy on the weekends, so be sure to get there a little early. Great service, large portions, & it's always fun to walk around Kierland before or after your meal."
EJ P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,54,2,2.0,8/8/2015,I  find it disappointing and disingenuous for a place with the reputation of the Cheesecake Factory to fudge wait times over the phone especially for families. I am still left to wonder how the 15 minute wait we were told on the phone turned into 1 hour in the 8 minutes it took for us to get there and check it. Expected much more from Cheesecake.
Robin S.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",48,44,14,3.0,12/8/2013,"Walked into cheese cake factory tonight, was immediately taken to our seats. Our server for the evening was Jon. His account of the menu as well as his excellent report with us, was just the beginning of a lovely meal. Our meals were fresh and served without waiting. A good time was had by all!"
Cj E.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,14,,3.0,6/12/2014,The food is always sooo good but the service is always bad! I have never had a start to finish good experience at the CF and I'm easy to please.
Travis T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/31/2014,"I have to say, this was by far my worst experience in a restaurant. My date and I both ordered the filet (I would think one of the most expensive meals on the menu). The steaks were delicious. The potatoes came ""garnished"" with onion rings. I was eating an onion ring and couldn't chew it. The ""onion"" was the skin of the onion. I had to pull it out of my mouth (in front of my date, on New Years eve)  I let our waiter know and showed him the skin. He just danced around it and barely acknowledged my complaint. He proceeded to take our leftovers and box them up, and brought back our check. I asked him if he could accommodate me at all. He said he would grab his manager KIM. A couple minutes later Kim came to our table and asked me how my steak was. I told her it was delicious and then proceeded to let her know what had happened. She said sorry and that she would let the cooks know, in a super condescending way. She said it was a ""garnish"" and was glad that everything else was ok and told me to have a Happy New Year. I was shocked that she didn't offer me even a desert or to accommodate me in any way. I had to make a little more fuss about it, embarrassing me again in front of my date. She then asked me if I wanted more onions rings. What??? Why would I want more of something that I just had a bad experience with and after I already had my leftovers boxed up. She finally says, I can give you the drinks (which totaled 8.50). Any time I have ever had an incident in a restaurant, I have always been fortunate to have someone actually care about a mistake. I completely understand mistakes happen, BUT, at least own up and take accountability when they do. KIM, the manager, did not want to own up at all.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this particular location at the Kierland Commons, to anyone. Kim and her waiter Alan should be ashamed of themselves for how they handled this situation. I will be contacting corporate about this as well. I'm sure they won't be happy to hear about how I was treated."
allen h.,"Phoenix, AZ",275,26,3,4.0,10/29/2011,We have been here over a dozen times and its usually pretty good.  We love their salads & pasta dishes!  Everything is humongous and I can eat!    We went there yesterday & we shared 2 items!  We had a large BBQ Chicken Salad (14.50) & a lunch portion Louisiana Chicken Pasta (10.95) My wife just started a diet so didn't want to eat much carbs(pasta) so I devoured most of that dish as well as half of the huge salad.  Maybe that's why I weigh like 5 pounds more today!  haha Another good salad is Santa Fe Salad..but we were hesitant to order it because the cook didn't make it awesome like we had it the 1st time! Other great dishes are Orange Chicken & Chicken Avocado club is good with their fries & must ask for their ranch!
Nick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",72,46,11,2.0,6/9/2012,"I usually am pleased by The Cheesecake Factory but this time I will say it was a horrible experience. First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful. The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland. Overall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory."
M L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,27,,1.0,12/24/2011,"I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factorys over the years, all over the west.  This one... never again. We went for lunch.  Terrible service and it's just way too expensive for what you get.  It took 3 tries to get me the lunch I ordered.  The first try was just wrong, the second try was closer but still wrong, finally the third try was right... she kept bringing someone else's burger.  And what a disappointment it was.  The burger could not have been more than a 1/3 lb with 2 pieces of thin bacon, cheese and 2 onion strings for $11.50.  It was a $7 or $8 burger at best. After the DOUBLE mistake, the waitress was flustered and pathetic.  And of course, offered nothing for the trouble.  At the very least a manager could have stopped by to apologize.   CF used to be know for their creativity, portion size, and great service.  Well things have definitely changed.  Now you get small to average sized portions and terrible service.  I guess that may be why you don't have to wait an hour for a table anymore.  Sad"
Susan S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,7,,2.0,8/4/2015,"My first trip to The Cheesecake Factory. I was there for lunch on 8/4/15, when I told my server Laura S that the hamburger that I ordered well-done was raw in the middle, I got a lecture that I should have told her earlier so that she could have fixed it. Great, but this is the first time I saw you since I got my food. When was I supposed to tell you? No offer to fix it at that point. I ate the outside of the burger and left the center. When she brought the ticket I got another lecture from her that next time I come in if there is anything wrong I need to let her know. I let her know that I would not be returning."
K J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,40,10,1.0,5/20/2015,"I always like the food in this place. I am literally typing this feedback while waiting for our food. Reason is I just find it unacceptable for a server to frown at the table she is serving, just because they maybe kinda confused her with some questions, and also when she turned around I just saw her say or whispered the F word to herself! Wow! We were seated at the patio and the lady server has white colored hair. The table she is serving is beside us. Just surprised about this."
Mya T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",105,352,14,2.0,4/4/2013,"Other than the cheesecake, which is 5 stars, I have been severely disappointed in the food lately.  We did 1 take out order recently and the food was soggy and slimy when we got home. The cheesecake was the only saving grace."
Kallie E.,"Cave Creek, AZ",10,8,1,4.0,9/4/2012,The cheesecake factory has typical prices for a chain but far better than typical quality food and service! Highlights: Best tex-mex egg rolls! All appetizers look so good Extensive menu that caters to any customer Good burgers Cheesecakes were wonderful...lemon raspberry is my favorite Timely service and very clean! I'm excited to back and try a pasta dish and more appetizers!
Anne W.,"Phoenix, AZ",648,230,6,5.0,12/27/2013,We had a really nice server. The Cashew Chicken is a HUGE dish- it lasted me for 3 meals.  I shared Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and it was AWESOME. I love Cheesecake Factory. They have a huge menu and their bread is awesome! Can't wait to go back.
Navid T.,"Manhattan, NY",200,180,62,4.0,1/2/2012,"People don't give this place enough credit. Sure its big and the menu is even bigger, filled with a lot of whatever food..but if you go for the right reasons, then its an amazing spot to go. Here are the only reason's to go to The Cheesecake Factory. 1) It's open relatively late, I think after midnight 2) Brown Bread with Butter--out of this world 3) Avacado Egg Rolls--mmmmm 4) Louisiana Chicken Pasta-A lot of food, nice tangy taste you could easily share this with two people. ask them to split #4 with your guest."
