Gaurav G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",57,69,22,3.0,3/26/2017,Been to this location a few times. The food as we all know is alright. Nothing to go all nuts about. So..where they always win my extra star is the service. They have nailed it down. The wait is less and the waiters are on the spot. And off course the cheesecake...I used to be a big fan of them here...then..one wise day....I saw the calories in them...and rest all is history
Jonathan J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,5,,4.0,4/26/2017,Solid quality food and good value--very friendly service.  A great option for a reasonably priced meal that will be good.
Bonnie S.,"Phoenix, AZ",203,194,220,2.0,6/8/2016,"Went there with my gal pals for a birthday bash.  Veronica (or was it Victoria??) was our server.    Very friendly, competent, and professional.   Since it was happy hour, we decided to try a few of their appetizers:   fried mac and cheese, pot stickers, buffalo blasts, sweet corn tamale cakes, egg roll sampler.   Huge quantities of each, to say the least.    If anything CF has going for it, it is the size of the servings and the menu selection.   I thought everything was over-fried and rather bland.   I mean, I love mac and cheese, but it was over-fried and hard.   The buffalo blasts were all batter, ughhh, could barely handle the tamale cake, couldn't say anything positive about the egg rolls, and the pot stickers were hard.   I am only giving it two stars instead of one because of the server and the cheesecake.   Our birthday gal did get a piece of cheesecake and we all had a few tastes of it.   Now, that was yummmmy!!   Would I go back?   Not if I can help it!"
Rick S.,"Canandaigua, NY",0,86,,4.0,9/3/2016,We loved this place in the heart of the biltmore area.  Very charming wait staff who were very attentive and responsive to our needs.  Food quality was excellent and we had their legendary cheese cake to top an amazing dinner off.
Erika L.,"Kenmare, ND",0,5,,5.0,10/17/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is and will probably always be one of my favorite restaurants. Especially since we don't have one close, it's a must when we travel. I wish I remember the specifics of what we had, I had some sort of Thai Salmon and my boyfriend had a shrimp and steak combo of some sort with mashed potatoes. We both loved everything. It was his first time visiting. Love the atmosphere, the staff, service, and food! Of course we both had to take cheesecake home. He had dulce de leche and I have pumpkin pecan, both fantastic."
Cameo W.,"Phoenix, AZ",816,206,147,4.0,8/25/2015,"This location of cheesecake factory was reasonably nice.  All the typical things that you would expect.  They have that crazy long menu, even at lunch.  I decided to try something from their low calorie menu today, getting the grilled chicken dish.  Overall, there wasn't anything bad about it, it just wasn't all that great.  No one in our party seemed all that excited about their food, again, nothing really wrong, just their standard faire. The service and management at this location were top notch though making it possible to still have a pretty good experience."
alo s.,"Fayetteville, NC",12,22,,1.0,2/15/2017,"I am so disappointed. I have enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory for years. Today however I ordered a simple steak sandwich via Door Dash and received a full out gristle sandwich with huge pieces of almost pure gristle. My cake and salad were pleasant, but I really did not feel like waiting an hour to be fed a garbage sandwich."
Lizabeth T.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,109,28,2.0,12/21/2015,"Im giving this 2.5 stars . Went Monday night dec. 21, sat at the bar. I ordered an appetizer while waiting for a friend. This was at 430pm. My friend arrived at 5 pm and my app still hadn't arrived. The bartender went to check and brought it back with her. She said no one had brought it out. It was lukewarm as it had been sitting there a while.I then ordered the happy hour burger with a side of onion rings, side of bbq sauce, mayo and ketchup. The burger came plain with no onion rings. The bartender never put the order in for the rings. I had to ask for the mayo and ketchup as well. They finally did get the rings out and didn't charge me for them. The bartender apologized and was very nice, the burger was very good as were the rings. But the lack of attention paid left me with a bad feeling. I had never been to a cheesecake factory before and won't likely be back."
Alyssa W.,"Phoenix, AZ",175,5,,1.0,6/5/2016,"I had rachael as my server and went here for dinner tonight and I order the Rennes Special, it was nothing like I expected had one bite and the server didn't even offer to take it off my bill or anything instead after I told her I didn't like it. I was very disappointed with my visit and my previous times being here With having very slow service...."
G R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,45,,3.0,2/23/2017,It's a Cheesecake Factory.  Consistent food; inconsistent service.  Twice this month I've had to argue over the use of the gift cards for a piece of free cheesecake.  Folks should really read their own cards.
Jose S.,"Surprise, AZ",50,5,3,1.0,5/25/2016,"Terrible experience, the food as always very good but the person in charge of sitting us made no effort in helping us get a table for 10. Even though there were tables available. We ended up sitting in separate booth. Maybe it was my fault for being passive but really left a bad experience. Very disappointed. The open tables were never used and they don't do reservations. If over 4 people,  I will never go there again  even on a Wednesday 5/25 for lunch."
Rebecca D.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,119,38,1.0,11/9/2016,"I typically love happy hour at the Cheesecake Factory and have had great experiences in Chandler and Biltmore. But the horrible surly service from our waitress ruined this location for us. Husband ordered a burger and clearly asked for it with just the cheese. It came out with sauce and onions and he politely informed the waitress. She did not hide how annoyed she was and pouted as she took it back to the kitchen. It came out a few minutes later, still with onions! He found her again and politely informed her there were still onions on the burger. She was so annoyed and tried to argue that there were no onions although he tasted them. I said he asked for his burger plain so could we please have a plain burger. Her response to me was, in a condescending rude tone, ""I heard you."" That is not how you treat customers. I have worked in customer service for 8 years and I have never said that to a customer. This waitress should be fired. The manager apologized and gave us a free drink but it did not make up for how awkward the dining experience was. We will not return to this location. It is a disgrace to the Kierland Commons area which is a nice area full of high end dining options. Wait staff should be on their A game."
Charles C.,"Williams, AZ",0,40,16,5.0,2/23/2017,"Atmosphere is awesome , we were seated right away , the menu is gigantic, so many different varieties, I got the Cuban sandwich and it was huge and the taste was wonderful, I also got a side of jalapeño cream cheese corn , the flavors are a great mix. Will definitely be back"
Kam W.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,30,6,3.0,11/9/2015,So last week I came in and ordered the only dish I order which is the herb crusted salmon. It was raw :) today I came in for another try after craving it all week and the  dish was cold. I am seriously so disappointed i got there at 11 am thinking the cooks were fresh on the shift and it would be hot but no it was not . I work 2 seconds away and come in 3 to 4 times a month for my favorite dish. I had my very sweet server bring me a box after a couple bites .please hire new cooks or the expediter needs to step it up.  Signed a seriously disappointed ex loyal customer.
Kaity S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,50,3,3.0,7/10/2016,"I love cheesecake factory, however don't get it to go... The serving sizes are much smaller and it seems like they skimp out more on the meats in your salad or pasta. Also for how expensive their cheesecake is, they give the tiniest pieces!"
L. R.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,25,3,5.0,5/26/2016,"Great location in Kierland. Shrimp pasta, carbonara spaghetti and herb crust salmon were just perfect. Our waitress was kind. Price is ok for this area. We'll be back"
Russell M.,"Cornville, AZ",126,281,46,4.0,8/12/2014,"I've eaten at a few CF locations including the original one in Marina del Rey, CA which was the first time I tried them.  I'm always impressed but a bit intimidated by the exhaustive small book sized menu they have.  The good news is the broad selection of cuisine they offer from Cajun, Mexican/southwest/Asian and more.  The bad news is it's a lot to absorb and select from. I've never had a terrible dish at any CF location but some are better than others.  They make a pretty wicked Cajun chicken over pasta which is just the right amount of spicy hot and delicious.  Like most of their entrees, it's large enough to split or share which I recommend you do if you even remotely think you may want to sample one of their famous cheesecakes for dessert. We went here last Friday so the soup of the day was clam chowder which I usually like.  Theirs was tasty but too watery, not creamy as I like it.  We were a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone else complain so I presume everything was to their liking. I took my own advice and saved room to share a slice of fresh blueberry cheesecake which was good but definitely not outstanding.  My wife is a dessert guru and extraordinary cheesecake is in her repertoire so I am not easily impressed even with what is supposed to be among the best.  It was good but not great. Finally, my biggest complaint about this place is the lighting.  Granted I am approaching 63 and my eyesight is waning but even the (younger) others had trouble reading the micro print on the menu.  I had to use my cell phone to see it which could be somewhat embarrassing for others.  It's just an inconvenience for me.  I've eaten in darker restaurants but they all have strategically placed overhead spotlights to help the vision compromised diner like me. The CF is pretty dependable and I don't see much difference among their locations.  After all, I suppose that is the whole point of a chain eatery - consistency and predictability regardless of which one you patronize.  Their restaurants are all nicely decorated with friendly servers and like I said, seemingly endless selections of food and drink.  A fun place to go for any event or just for a tasty and satisfying meal."
George W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",33,66,212,2.0,7/12/2015,"This review is strictly about the dessert and not any of the menu items. I see so many 5 stars and I guess if you would want average desserts that load up the sugar and chocolate sauces to mask the flavor then hey this is the 5 star place for you! Had their Godiva cheesecake and since I wanted something with WOW chocolate decided on the chocolate blackout cake.  Now, would one except a dark chocolate almost slightly bitter taste of real cocoa when ordering the Godiva Dark Chocolate?  Or instead how about just giving a really over sweetened chocolate cheese cake with no real homemade texture that may perchance resemble a taste similar to Hershey's ?   Chocolate Blackout Cake- increase the portion size to feed 3 people, decrease the quality of the ingredients and add again the sweet chocolate syrup with an almost artificial chocolate taste upon the cake that is like a box mix.  Voila...charge $9.00 for equivalent of Betty Crocker box cake! Don't mean to go hard on the CF, but most of their menu items on their appetizer side and small plates are fried (one or two healthy ones only), and again from what I see, if you want a ton of food for not a lot of money then sure its great.  I haven't tried their entrees yet, but am a bit hesitate to do so.  Just don't want to set myself up for disappointment. For the service side- seen the same service issues everyone else talks about.  For some reason these corporate chains either hire managers who don't know what they heck they are doing, or decide to offer a pay scale so low that no one takes the job seriously and could care less if they work there or not.  How about pay a few more dollars per hour and hire people who take their job seriously?  And find a real manager, which again might cost a few more dollars but could be worth it."
Edward G.,"Livonia, MI",0,15,,1.0,3/31/2016,"I ordered a Mexican tortilla salad with chicken. There were about four small bite sized pieces of chicken. When I told the waitress, so didn't do anything. If we had not been with acquaintances, I would have complained. Will definitely not return. Way too costly for the type of salad."
Megan R.,"Glendale, AZ",188,162,3,4.0,4/25/2016,"Always enjoy a good meal at The Cheesecake Factory. I've recently started seeing a personal trainer, so it was my goal to find something on the healthier side. I ordered the Lemon Garlic Shrimp off the Skinnylicious menu. It was the perfect portion of shrimp, pasta and asparagus and didn't taste skinny at all. It was delicious and paired perfectly with a glass of Chianti. Our server was also very attentive, but she did bring the check while I was still eating which was annoying."
