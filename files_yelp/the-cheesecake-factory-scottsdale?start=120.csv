Rachel H.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,85,12,3.0,5/4/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a safe bet for group settings. And you can't go wrong by ending the evening with cheesecake!  This is one of my go-to's when I have a group. The menu offers anything and everything (which can also be a pain in the butt for indecisive people), the portions are HUGE and they offer healthy options with their Skinnylicious menu. My go-to is either the cobb salad or the caesar salad.  And then good luck on only choosing one flavor of cheesecake. There is just about any flavor available. My favorites: Reese's Peanut Butter and Godiva Chocolate... mmm... Honorable mentions for Oreo and raspberry white chocolate.  Service is not super speedy, so be careful if you're on a time limit."
TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,5.0,1/14/2016,"C's birthday dessert. After we had eaten dinner at another location, C wanted to come here for his birthday dessert. We were sat immediately and our server was Victoria T. She was great. Attentive, on point, pleasant and not intrusive. Kudos. So the birthday boy C got the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake ($7.95). He loved it. Personally, I didn't think it had enough cream cheese flavor and was too sweet but that's just me. They wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on his plate so he felt special. K had the Lemon Meringue Cheese Cake ($7.95). She loved it. I didn't taste it but she said it had very nice lemony flavor and had really good texture. Grandma C had the Tiramisu Cheese Cake ($7.95). Her only comment was Yum. I had Carrot Cake ($7.95). OK, enough of the laughing. I'm not the biggest fan of commercial Cheesecake because it never has enough cream cheese in it. And since there was going to be 3 Cheesecakes on the table, why add a fourth. Plus, I love good Carrot Cake. For the most part, The Cheesecake Factory does a good job with all their desserts so I never feel like it's going to be a bad decision not to go with a Cheesecake. My Carrot cake was very good. A tad on the dry side but that's probably because once the cake is sliced, one side of the next piece is going to begin to dry out. The cake still has good flavor, was moist enough and there were noticeable pieces of Carrots within the cake. The frosting is also pretty good although for me it's a little too sweet and could use a little more cream cheese flavor. All in all, very good though. Great service, reasonable pricing, great desserts. 5 Stars."
Lan B.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,82,7,3.0,2/28/2016,Love love love this place. So many options so it's almost impossible to not please everybody. The pizza is wonderful here. Wood fired and you can just taste the greatness. I especially love coming here for Sunday brunch. I have never tasted anything as amazing as the Monte Cristo and the Lemon Ricotta pancakes. The pricing is very reasonable for the portion sizes and the quality. The waiters are all very delightful and very fast. The atmosphere is great itself as well. The restaurant is very clean and I don't think l have ever had an unpleasant experience. *Update*: went for drinks this morning ALL the silverware was dirty and the drinks are overpriced. Make sure the utensils are clean that your using if you choose to come. And next door brunch alcoholic beverages are a third of the cost.
O'Zandra F.,"Sulphur, LA",95,209,489,5.0,3/1/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I generally visit the Factory to get the chocolate dream extreme cheesecake! It's delicious after any course! This particular location is always pleasant to visit. Conveniently located. Nice to visit after a long day of shopping too! The bar staff is on point. I cannot speak for the other staff, as I haven't sat in the dining area. Pleasant ambience. The drinks are stiff and the cheesecake always arrives timely. Love this location."
Vianca C.,"Honolulu, HI",6,22,25,4.0,9/28/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect restaurant for any occasion and when you're craving good food. Their menu consists of a wide range of soups, salads, pastas, drink specials, seafood, and much more! I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked through the door and seated shortly after.  I had the Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer which was delicious! If you love macaroni and cheese as much I do, this appetizer will not disappoint you. The Fried Macaroni and Cheese is made of 4 macaroni and cheese balls fried on the outside and cheesy on the inside. The macaroni tastes great with the creamy marinara sauce that it is served with and also goes well with the complimentary bread.  Any visit to the Cheesecake Factory demands a slice of any of their specially made cheesecakes for dessert. My favorite has always been their red velvet cheesecake but I decided to try something different an go with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. My tastebuds were not disappointed when it arrived at our table as it had creamy cheesecake, chocolate chips, and warm chewy cookie dough bits baked in the middle. If you like chocolate and cookies, this cheesecake is definitely worth a try!! This location can get crowded around lunch and dinner time so try to arrive before noon for lunch and before 6pm for dinner."
Jenene K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",34,20,,5.0,4/19/2016,cheesecake here is divine. Went with a group of seven after a movie one night and the service was excellent. We did not wait long to be seated.  Love the original cheesecake. We ordered a whole one with coffee. Server Jeanette was amazing.
Katy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,1.0,2/12/2016,"My husband and I came here last night for an impromptu dinner date and because we had a gift card to use. My husband ordered the Shepard's Pie & I ordered the shrimp scampi/herb crusted salmon combo. The quality of food has gone down the drain. My husband got super sick from the Shepard's pie! My plate had way too much sauce and was extremely garlicky. It was basically drowned in sauce, my shrimp was soggy and the plating was a mess. I don't think we will be ordering any food from the restaurant but only cheesecake."
Andie S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,15,1,5.0,1/1/2015,"Two words: stuffed mushrooms.  My  boyfriend and I frequent The Cheesecake Factory and haven't had any bad incidents yet. Well, there was that one time when a creepy guy with those weird Google glasses sat next to us and kept looking over... But there has yet to be a problem with the food or staff. Get there early, though, because sometimes that yummy rye(?) bread is out by the end of the night! It is great. Seriously. Some of the best staff in town. A++"
Jocelle L.,"Dublin, OH",0,22,,5.0,10/1/2016,"Been going to Cheesecake Factory for years; not only at this location but others throughout AZ and CA.   The food is great and the selection is plentiful.  We always get the chicken marsala, pasta da vinci, Santa Fe salad, and fried zucchini.  Salads are good and the size can feed 2 or 3 people.  The new items on the menu are also very tasty."
Wendy Camille A.,"Winslow, AZ",8,45,,4.0,3/29/2016,"Ate here for the first time and loved it. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was divine. I had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory until now and I am thoroughly impressed. Bathrooms were neat and clean, seating was comfortable, atmosphere was nice. I will definitely be returning!"
Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1317,1460,7211,4.0,10/31/2013,"We only went for a slice of cheesecake but it was delicious as per usual for Cheesecake Factory! Claire was our waitress and she was phenomenal - I highly recommend requesting her if you go since we will be requesting her when we make return visits. We sat outside and they had the heaters going so it wasn't too cool to sit on the porch. I know the cheesecakes are pre-made and easy to serve, but it came out lightning fast and Claire was on top of refilling our drinks if we wanted it.   Overall: A Great dessert stop off with friendly service!"
Jody K.,"Phoenix, AZ",226,298,329,5.0,8/26/2013,"When you're with a bunch of people and are all hankering for different types of food, this is the place to go.  There are at least 20 pages worth of menu items ranging from Asian to American to Mexican to Italian.  The list goes on.  There's even a menu for the dieters called their Skinny Menu.  I am not a huge fan of corporate restaurants, but I'm not going to lie, this place never disappoints.  The items I usually order are:  Miso Salmon - delightful with salmon cooked to perfection laying over a bed of rice with this sweet and savory sauce drizzled on top.  I always ask for extra sauce on the side and they happily oblige.  I also order their chicken marsala with mushrooms - bow tie pasta with mushrooms, sliced chicken with a sweet and tasty marsala sauce.  I never can finish so I always have great leftovers the next day.   I always order their passion iced tea and their ""brown"" bread given at the beginning is always warm and soft.  Service there is almost always great - attentive servers and the food and drinks come out pretty quickly.   As for cheesecake, my favorite is their red velvet and their banana cream.  If I'm feeling really hungry still and have people willing to share, I love their strawberry shortcake.  It's too big to finish alone - you need at least 2 more friends to share it with."
Brad S.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,218,15,3.0,9/13/2013,"The food here is okay but I can't help think that this place is a master of none.  The draft beer is standard fare.  The service is okay.  The menu is large but the advertising just looks tacky to me. I ordered the gumbo which seemed to be more like jambalaya.  They don't even give you a spoon to eat it.    They have added a skinny menu which is nice to see and the women in my party liked the items.  Obviously they are moving away from the large portion thing.   The cheesecake, as always, is great with a large selection to choose from.  I just wished the server would stop bashing the smores choice.  We liked it."
Ryan C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",106,353,1254,4.0,6/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a dependable staple in our takeout rotation.  My favorite part about these guys is the consistency of the food.  Always made right, they never forget anything.  Our personal favorites include the Crusted Chicken Romano, The Jambalaya Pasta, and the Chicken Madeira.  Yes, they are known for their cheesecake but their Carrot Cake is pretty amazing too."
Chelsi E.,"Phoenix, AZ",47,8,,5.0,8/1/2015,"Me and my best friend go here all the time, awesome ambiance usually wherever we sit, always pretty decent service, and the food we love! We love the appetizers: Endive Salad, blue cheese & arugula Flat bread, Margarita Flatbread. For drinks I've had/love the Chocolate Martini, and Moscato! And the strawberry shortcake dessert is delish Never underestimate your local chain restaurant in Scottsdale(;"
Casey H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,3,5.0,3/7/2016,Ordered a variety of food here for an office birthday party. Everything was done just right and tasted AMAZING! You can taste the fresh & quality ingredients in the food here. I had the Orange chicken which was better than PF changs next door!! Great food & Great service!!
Arthur R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,72,,1.0,10/15/2014,When I'm in the dumps my wife picks me up a piece of cheesecake. The slices have gotten so small and prices so high... Won't be back.  They also did not respond to complaint on Twitter.  Bye bye Cheesecake Factory
Tony L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,27,,5.0,4/4/2016,Wow is all that I can say!!! The menu seems never ending. The waitress was amazing and my chicken was as tender and tasty as I have ever tasted. We had 6 people with us for dinner and no one left hungry!! Thank You
Robin W.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,25,,4.0,3/5/2016,"We love going tot he cheesecake factory, and this one is very good. The noise level is a bit high and the last 2 visit we left with higher hopes, but that's mostly because have have tried something new each time and the last two were misses. I love the Thai lettuce wraps, and the potstickers. The Chicken Parmesan left something to be desired. Their mixed drinks are wonderful and the service is great. We can't wait to go again."
David S.,"Cave Creek, AZ",63,143,207,4.0,12/24/2013,Open Christmas eve! They serve Patron Anejo ! And... They have low carb cheesecake!
