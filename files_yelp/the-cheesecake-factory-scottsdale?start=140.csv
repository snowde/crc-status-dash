GiJeuk J.,"Kirkland, WA",160,82,40,2.0,1/27/2016,"We came here to celebrate my brother's graduation. The food was subpar, but the cheesecake was good albeit overly sugary. The service was the wort out of all the places we ate on the trip. If I ever visit Phoenix again I will pass here. The good thing was the cheesecake and the decor and that's about it."
Cyndi D.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,16,,5.0,7/30/2015,"Best cheesecake! I had the Sea Salt Carmel cheesecake! Yum! From the time I walked in the door to the time I left; friendly hostess, nice and friendly server, counter people VERY friendly! Lots of suggestions on the best cheesecake to try!"
Morgan G.,"Phoenix, AZ",93,55,34,3.0,8/5/2014,"My husband and I have come here many times for lunch, and it is always a good treat. Services is shaky, sometimes great, sometimes horrible, but most of the time on the better end of things.  I get the Chinese Chicken Salad each time, since it is something I know I will like and it is a full meal (the lunch portion), and it always comes out great. More chicken sometimes than the others, but overall good.  My husband changes his mind up often, but gets the Sheila's Chicken Salad the majority of the time. Again, always consistent.  We never come here for dinner because of the price, but do for their tiny-bit-discounted lunch meals. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious, but $5 for a drink that isn't alcoholic?! That seems insane to me..especially because any of their to-go drinks are in the tiniest of cups...a kids size. Their other drinks are in between $3 and $5, so none of the drinks are cheap, which is why I just decide to swallow the cash and spend the $5 on delicious strawberry lemonade. Reason I gave only 3 stars is because the staff is never overly nice, place is clean most of the time, and food is always good. I just don't feel it deserves any more than 3 stars, but nothing really bad to say besides the overly prices food, but that's what you get for corporate food!"
Jennifer M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,7,,5.0,3/24/2015,"I love this place!Food is delicious and the cheese cake is so yummy! If it is your birthday, you should tell them. They will celebrate with you in your special birthday. I totally recommend it"
Dave N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",131,448,375,3.0,6/18/2013,"If you're here to eat cheesecake, that's totally fine. You're in the right place. When it comes to the restaurant, I'm not too fond of eating here. The menu here is diverse for sure, but the dishes themselves have always been good, not great. No matter what I order, I can recall a similar variant that tasted better and costs less. I think that's just the nature of this chain, but if you're dropping more cash I think you should get better food. The cost goes more towards the ambience than anything else. The free bread is not bad though. Yay free bread."
Betsy B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,175,,2.0,5/28/2014,"I never eat at this restaurant as I prefer small local places. I attended a birthday celebration recently. the menu is TOO much, too big, too many choices. Portions are huge, who can eat all that food, no wonder Americans are so fat. The food was Okay. I liked the barbecue chicken salad, however, if you can't make a good salad, then there are problems.  The problem was the server. She to came to the table four times to take the same drink order and was totally unaware she had been there many times before. It was obvious she was impaired in some manner. The evening was saved by the  manager whose name I did not get. He took over, got our drinks and then assigned us a new server."
Vanessa L.,"Phoenix, AZ",104,104,200,5.0,10/17/2014,Service was great! I loved how she kept refilling my water and having conversations with us. The food was great too!!
Niko A.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",0,12,,3.0,6/30/2015,This place is tacky as hell. Literally this is my hell. It's  the Indian Jones ride at Disneyland that serves dessert. Came in late on a Tuesday and the service was pretty good. The food is okay. Nothing spectacular but the cheesecakes are amazing. It's their namesake so I'm glad it is.
Tracy B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",93,8,7,2.0,3/30/2016,"Worst service ever.  I called in a curbside order was placed on hold for 6 min before I decided to hang up & try again this time I didn't let her put me on hold & explained I had already held long enough.  She promptly got someone to take my order, a lunch Sante Fe salad.  That's it nothing more.  I arrived 20 min later, they gave me a 15 min window, I felt that was ample time.  I get there & curbside parking is obviously not being observed, it never is.  So I call & say I'm just parked up front not in those spots, as they are taken.  I waited 10 min no one came out.  I found a place to park & went in.  The gentleman running out the door had my food & said he was the only one working and he was very sorry.  I am very sorry that I aw at least 3 others standing around.  There was gentleman right by the bakery, yet no one could help him get out of the weeds?  I'm sorry for him trying to do his best while his manager & co workers watched him literally run around to try & attend to his afternoon lunch orders.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!"
Steven C.,"Clovis, CA",1,13,,4.0,6/4/2015,"If you like The Cheesecake Factory then the one in Scottsdale, AZ won't disappoint.  Consistency in a chain is always good especially when you are traveling and not sure what you might get.  This location had very friendly hosts and servers.  The food was standard Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess even called the hotel shuttle for us, a very nice courtesy."
Brad W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",203,1514,1940,1.0,4/29/2015,"Not a smart crowd at the front desk of this factory. The older gray haired guy (manager?) seated us near the bar with menu's, but 15 minutes later, nobody had even said hello etc. Granted, we could have flagged down somebody, but that's not my job. You seat me and then you serve me, that's how it works. It's ok, I got my shots into Mr. grey hair guy as we moseyed on out the door and he had the nerve to ask where we were seated twice. Dude, you just seated us you idiot. Anyway, I still like the factory on occasion, but they had a bad day on this evening."
Mark M.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,15,4,1.0,8/23/2015,"Pit Beef Dip- Pass it up. The sandwich was presented on a small sesame seed bun, while the roast beef was medium it was also fatty and the Au Jus was tasteless and presented in a tea cup, The side salad was plentiful but the Balsamic was lacking in flavor. Save you money."
Marissa A.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,1,,1.0,5/18/2014,"Food poisoning last night!!!!! Skinnylicious steak medallions= DEATH.  Oh my goodness, started barfing at 5 this morning and still ill!!!! I will never set foot in another Cheesecake Factory again."
Desiree C.,"Phoenix, AZ",102,58,16,5.0,7/30/2015,"Love the hours of Cheesecake Factory! Good food open until 11! Not many places open that late. Never had a problem with anything I ordered. The tex mex egg rolls are the bomb. It should always be ordered! Cheesecake is to die for. I just tried the Adam's something cheesecake (forgot the name) it had peanut butter, caramel, chocolate in it. So yummy!"
Autumn T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,19,,4.0,6/10/2016,"One of my favorite places to go. Had the Parmesan herb crusted chicken, was delicious! Besides the food, the best service by Patricia D. Always a smile on her face, knew the right time to come to table, wasn't pesky. She made the dining experience that much better."
Anjan S.,"Loveland, OH",23,4,1,2.0,5/9/2015,The service is really bad. Been sitting here for almost 20 mins and nobody's bring food yet. This has been a regular thing.
Stephanie B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",61,81,23,5.0,7/2/2014,"I rated it 5 stars, but there is one problem- their menu is so big that I have trouble making decisions! Regardless, I have never been disappointed there. I always try something different. Usually their salads. Not only are they huge portion sizes but they are always delicious. Drink specials are great. I love their sangria. The ambiance is nice. It is a huge restaurant and the booths allow you space to not feel overcrowded. Moving on to the best part- the cheesecake!! It is a must when going here. So many different kinds to choose from. My favorite is the original. But I like the Pumpkin seasonal one as well. Love this place!"
Kerrie Z.,"Goodyear, AZ",105,11,1,5.0,9/23/2015,I love this location.  THey are always friendly and the food is well done. I love the Steak Diane and they will customize it with less pepper they way I like it.  THe mashed are so good.
Steve W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,8,,2.0,10/22/2015,"45 minute wait for our meal today at lunch. If it weren't for the lunch time rush I'd give them one star. Been to many CCFs across the country. We've been to this one awhile back. This time they ruined a perfectly wonderful outing with my wife due to the poor service. There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale, AZ to take a chance of this happening again."
Nancy H.,"Chesapeake, VA",20,30,266,4.0,4/29/2012,"One of the more dependable chain restaurants.  It feels like a treat without spending huge amounts for a tasty meal. I've always enjoyed their great food and good portion sizes.  Many items are generous enough to be shared.  The giant menu allows everyone to find something that they like.  If you have any room left after your meal you can share a slice of cheesecake or take one to go! We visit both this location and the one at the Biltmore often and both are nice.  Even though the restaurant is quite large, there can still be a wait.  So reservations or call-ahead dining would be a nice addition. Here are some of my favorites from their menu - it's always hard to choose just one. Luau Salad  Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich  Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta Low Carb Cheesecake is delicious too!  They use crushed walnuts instead of graham crackers for the crust. I've rarely ordered something that I didn't love."
