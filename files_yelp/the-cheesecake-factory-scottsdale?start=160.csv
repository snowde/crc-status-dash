Trish B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",53,113,113,3.0,11/7/2013,"Meh.  My over all review can be reduced to ""Meh"".  The garlic noodles with shrimp had spaghetti not spaghettini, the shrimp was over over over cooked, and the asparagus was woody.  Flavor is fine.  Grey Goose dry martini is good.  Not watered down.  Server is pleasant. Side note:  after voicing my concerns to Marissa, our waitress-who is really good- made sure to address them to my surprised satisfaction.  So, based purely on Marissa's customer service - revise my review from 2 stars to 3 Stars."
Werner B.,"Denver, CO",4,84,32,4.0,4/17/2016,"It has been ages since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. My last experience at the Chandler Mall location wasn't all that great, had no desire to go back. Yesterday I ended up however at the Kierland location. Arrived close to 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday and it wasn't busy yet (there was a line when we left). The service was perhaps the best we've ever received at this chain. The young lady was attentive, friendly and always there with a refill before we needed it. We ordered the Veggie Melt and the Four Cheese Pasta dish. The Veggie Melt was delicious and massive. It was 1 1/2 sandwich. I could only finish 1/3 of it, took the rest home. The Four Cheese pasta dish was a good classic you can't really mess up all that much. Sadly no room for cheesecake after. I ordered fries with my sandwich and they were a disappointment. I always think you are going to get the Yard House style fries here, but you get a pretty average bland fry. Not horrible, just average. I'd be back."
Liz B.,"Chandler, AZ",4,35,,4.0,5/18/2014,"Very good service for a group lunch.  Food is good and lots of menu choices, regardless of your diet type.   and of course.... great cheesecake!"
Erich B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",88,183,81,4.0,3/1/2014,This is a review for the cheesecake only. My wife loves cheesecake. She loves it. She days the red velvet is the best she had ever tasted. We come here mostly for just this. Call ahead fir takeout it us easier than fighting the crowds.
Hannah C.,"Tempe, AZ",77,236,790,5.0,10/19/2013,"Love this place! Food is great and so is the cheesecake! During the weekend the wait for a table can be pretty long and i'm not sure if they take reservations or not. Staff is nice and always ask you if they can get you something else. The portions are HUGE! I ordered a salad off of the ""skinny"" menu they have and it was still humungous! Food isn't the best for you but it is really good. The menu is huge here so if you are a picky eater than this place is the best place for you since there is so many items to pick from! Always have a good experience every time I come here!"
Neka D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,128,34,5.0,11/1/2014,"This is by far my fav location in Arizona.  The location is awesome and the food never disappoints.  I'm a little farther away from it now but it's worth the drive.  Great food, service, and location! What more can you ask for?"
Jennifer B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",192,56,336,3.0,4/3/2015,"Cheesecake Factory, I've come to three different locations thinking maybe it's just the location but so far I'm unimpressed with the food and staff, it's always a long wait to be seated. Once you're seated they ask about drinks then 15 minutes later they arrive and again with the wait but longer for your food. Each time I've eaten food here I've been sick the rest of the evening. But I will say their deserts are amazing I'm now only coming for desert pick up because it's so delicious!"
Jackie G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I have always enjoyed dinning here, but tonight was an exception. My salmon was overcooked and very dry, with veggies cold. The server returned again with my same plate so hot and food all overcooked. The server had poor attitude and pretty much ignored us. Manager offered a new meal after guest finished eating their meal. Forget this place server said we were lucky to be comped."
S J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,,2.0,10/10/2016,"We have visited this Cheesecake factory location several times and the food has always been ok, service a little slow.  On our most recent visit, my daughter and I both ordered the White Chicken Chili (which I order almost every time I visit) and it arrived looking very different than usual.  It tasted like they had dumped a whole bottle of chili powder in our bowls and I asked the server if they had changed the menu recently, because the White Chicken Chili is usually WHITE, not dark red.  I also told her that it tasted pretty bad and I wasn't able to finish my meal because the spice they used was overpowering.  Our server said she asked the manager and the kitchen what they had changed and came back to our table and told us that they had left an ingredient out of the recipe in error and that is why it tasted that way.  Really? No offer to make it right - just substandard tasting food at full price.  Because I had eaten about half my meal and so had my daughter, we didn't feel right asking for a refund - but I can tell you that we won't be returning to this location.  To cap off our lunch we waited almost 20 minutes for our server to run our card before we could leave."
Dave C.,"Van Buren, OH",1,39,1,4.0,3/15/2015,Typical good experience at Cheesecake Factory. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was spicy and very good. My wife had the Herb Salmon and loved it. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the nice Arizona weather. Only bad thing was  we didn't leave room for desert since portions were so large. Only downside was it took awhile for food to be cooked
Debi C.,"Gilbert, AZ",18,45,3,1.0,9/28/2014,"In this day and age, how is it possible that a restaurant a nationwide restaurant no less has no Wi-Fi for their customers?   Food is always average but a good location but not if you plan a working breakfast or lunch.  They have to be missing out on a lot of business clients."
Teehee O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",6,62,7,1.0,2/18/2013,"I came here with my family yesterday (group of 5). It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/ Our waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was. The menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt.  My MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took. By the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed  with the entire experience.  Save your cash for a place with better food, better service, perhaps less sweaty servers."
Sara C.,"Bellevue, WA",246,362,89,5.0,1/16/2014,No matter where or when this restaurant is always great for a simple meal. Something for every mood on the menu and everything is always good.  You can be as healthy or glutinous here. It's all there.
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,3.0,11/28/2013,I love the Cheesecake Factory. I can always count on really good food. We went on a Friday night and had a fairly large party be were seated within 15 minutes. We had a wonderful server who was very attentive and kept our drinks filled. Everyone loved their meal and were definitely full. You can not go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.
Ryan C.,"Phoenix, AZ",544,99,110,3.0,12/28/2014,"Loses a star right off the bat due to no wifi. Bar guy took good care of me. Said it was because they like to promote family (he guessed).  If that's the case and we are shoving family values down our throats, why not clean up the menu a bit and only serve healthy well balanced meals? Oh, and while we're at it, let's make it a little more affordable for a family to eat here rather than 15 dollars a dish? Family values also shouldn't promote drinking so close the bar too; unless that's the kind of family you come from.  Anyway, can I have the wifi password now please so I can download your app, or possibly communicate with other without my data plan being charged.  The wifi keeps our annoying kids busy so we can eat in peace.  Way to go corporate suits.  Besides that, food is good. ;-)"
Nicole O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,7,,2.0,2/8/2015,"Not very good service.  Maybe they are busy but we have been coming here for many years and it has been getting worse.   The table is still dirty and bathroom is also not clean.  I can't stand that. The manager at this location doesn't know how to say ""I am sorry"".   They seem to feel that responding to customers is a waste of time.  That's it! I am done here.  We should have stopped coming a while ago but kept giving them the benefit of the doubt since we had been coming here for so many years."
Rick T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,8,,4.0,4/18/2015,"Great service, nice seating outside. Friendly staff. Would visit again. Came for appetizers."
Msrpyxa R.,"Cicero, IL",5,18,63,3.0,1/2/2014,"I love their service I give them 5 stars their food is very good but their desserts are delicious. Favorite has to be the milkshakes, and the fish. We do enjoy coming here when we come to visit Arizona. Recommended by a big eater."
Debra A.,"Goodyear, AZ",282,31,,4.0,12/29/2014,We stopped in here for Dinner and were able to get a seat right away on the patio! There are heating lamps out there so was not chilly at all. We had the crab cake appetizer and Loved it was cooked crispy and delicious. I had my favorite salad Which is the Luau Salad and is a huge portion! Haley had the club sandwich and was excellent as well.
K B.,"Phoenix, AZ",86,66,4,4.0,9/26/2013,"I was taken out to the Cheesecake Factory tonight, & hadn't been in quite some time. The last time was at a different location...Biltmore. That was an awful trip & between that and a sexual harassment lawsuit at the chain around that same time, I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever go back. Well, tonight I did and I'm glad I gave it another shot. Lets get the negative things out of the way first:  The hostess was not very friendly & made me worry that it had been a mistake to go back. The bartender seemed like he was not happy to be there or to talk to us about drinks. It was a little cold in the dining area, but seemed to warm up as the evening progressed. Now for good things: Of course, I got the chicken madeira because I ALWAYS get it and it's ALWAYS delicious. I think the portions are getting a bit smaller these days, but I still had leftovers. Drinks were...meh. I would love if they had a better draught beer selection myself. None of the beers were too exciting so I got a martini and it was...drinkable...maybe. For those prices I'd expect better. Calamari was decent. Cheesecake is always great.  Food was good, but what made tonight's trip overcome the few negatives and past experiences and warrant a 4 star rating was the service. Mandy was great...very friendly and not snooty like some servers in the Scottsdale area can be. She also did not flirt with the guy I was with hoping to get more tips. I hate when servers do that.  There was one mistake by the kitchen where peas were added to a dish that was requested without them, but they realized before it even came out and Greg (who I can assume was the manager on duty) came over to apologize personally and offer a soup or salad while we waited. We appreciated it but declined the offer. Mandy was attentive and was taking good care of us so we really didn't feel like anything was much of a wait. She mentioned that she is fairly new, but had she not told us, we wouldn't have guessed.  Overall a great trip. I will likely put the Cheesecake Factory back on my list of restaurants to choose from on a regular basis. I recommend it. Ask for Mandy...she's good. :)"
