Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1367,1367,6002,5.0,7/21/2013,"I would never rate any Cheesecake Factory under five stars and this one, being a bit smaller than any other that I've visited, stood up to the five stars. The wait was under 10 minutes around 6pm on a Saturday. I had the avocado egg rolls for the first time and just like everyone else says on yelp, they're awesome."
Mar C.,"Miami, FL",0,54,,1.0,6/22/2014,"Okay food but horrible service by rude and cynical waitress. In less than an hour the waitress managed to deride both my husband and me multiple times but she topped it when she withdrew my husband's plate and asked if he wanted to have it packed. I was just starting to eat my lunch and she is already removing plates and thinking about packing leftovers for us?  At the end of our lunch I reminded her that it is not in good form to withdraw one person's plate and ask about taking it home before his companion is finished. She asserted that she was following her bosses' instructions. Again, I said that it is not in good form. She then asked, ""where are you from."" Really? Don't sit at Jessica M's table if you want proper service. Better yet, stay away if their managers support rude waitresses behaviors."
Atyaf S.,"Southwest Anaheim, CA",5,2,12,5.0,1/3/2015,service was great. Ive been to multiple cheese cake factory restaurants but this one had the best service. We got fried calamari appetizer that was amazing.  Their pastas are pretty good too. This time I had the shrimp and chicken jambalaya which was  a little bit spicy but really good. Overall we had a great dinner. Oh and for desert the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was to die for.
Bryant D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,44,17,3.0,11/7/2014,Bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive.  At the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone. Blah.
Kole S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,7,,5.0,3/2/2015,I love the cheese ale factory and I Recently took my friend who had never been and she was easily over whelmed by the large menu. Thankfully our server was more then helpful in narrowing it down for her and she was stoked with all her choices. We of course had left overs and of course we got cheesecake to go. Over all awesome meal!!
Jessica C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,33,19,5.0,12/15/2014,"I have actually had very negative experiences at this Cheesecake Factory location in the past. I went back very hesitantly last night and I am happy to report I had a wonderful experience and good food. We sat outside by two warm heaters and had a very nice waitress who was very tolerant of my son. I wish I would have got her name because she deserves kudos on giving us excellent service. The dinner plate I got was very filling and now I have lunch for today, all for a reasonable price. I still hate their parking situation but it would not stop me from going back."
Ender W.,"Littleton, CO",0,27,2,2.0,7/22/2012,"First time experience. Tried turkey burger from the skinyalicous menu. Burger was ok but greasy. They served me a salad that has gone bad.  You donot serve a salad with rotting vegetables. Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."
Patrick H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",30,1140,1109,3.0,7/28/2010,"Sat at the bar for lunch.  Watched sports on the TV and talked with the bartender to keep entertained. The factory burger and fries are always a good call.  In fact, the fries are definitely above average. You'll never leave this place hungry!"
Tanda M.,"Los Angeles County, CA",134,437,102,4.0,4/12/2013,We had the best server ever. I wish to GodI could remember his name. I think it was Ryan. WE got there on Easter Sunday night... The place was empty. Our food was AWESOME. Our service was AWESOME. SUPER Attentive! I went home full and happy! Would certainly return!
Kristin R.,"Peoria, AZ",58,23,1,5.0,1/21/2015,"My husband and I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory for 12 years. This is the only Cheesecake Factory we will go to in AZ. Great service, food is always on point, prices are ok (but understood), drinks are a little pricey, service is great and always a good environment."
Jenn S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,20,8,1.0,3/22/2015,"By far the worst experience I have ever received in a restaurant.  We went to cheesecake factory on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30 for lunch. My friend and her boyfriend arrived before myself and two of my other girlfriends so they were first seated. So after we arrived, they were waiting for 10 minutes for a server. A total of 30 minutes pass by and still no word from a server!!! We just wanted atleast water to start the night off. We alerted a manager by the name of Adam Paige that we haven't been helped for 30 minutes and he showed absolutely no care that we've been waiting. He just said ""ok"". I was a host for two restaurants and I am fully aware how the restaurant business is. Either the host didn't notify the server or the server didn't know the section. Finally our server came to our table saying ""Sorry, I walked past you guys so many times and didn't even know you were my table"". We didn't know how to take that response so we just said it's okay. We finally got our drinks in and then she came back later to take our orders. Some people from my party ordered off the lunch menu, I myself did not. I ordered a Salmon crusted salad. We waiting for 45 minutes for our food to arrive and finally received it. Everyone enjoyed their food and as did I. When we all were full, the server came and asked if we wanted boxes. One of my friends who finished eating before me had her salad boxed by the server but I don't mind boxing my own salad, I thought my server had better things to do than to box my salad. With the salads being huuge, I only touched half of my plate. As I was putting my salad into a box, I KID YOU NOT, TWO FRUIT FLIES WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY SALAD. At first I thought, WAIT this cannot be right I must be seeing things. So I closed my togo box and told my friends. As I opened it, I had 4 witnesses seeing flies come out of my salad. so I immediately closed it again. At this point, I was so so disgusted. If two flies were still alive, I cannot imagine how many dead ones I ate. Maybe they were in the lettuce packaging when they made the salad, I do not know. But I sure as hell know what I saw. Me and My friend approached Adam Paige to let him know what was in my salad. I still cannot believe how UNPROFESSIONAL he was. I handed the box of food and said there were fruit flies in my salad. All he said was do you want another one..... ANOTHER ONE!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? There was no sincere apology, no I am so sorry, he didn't even offer to comp the salad. The SERVER asked me if he will comp it. I just couldn't believe this experience, and it just manages to get worse and worse!!!! All my friends who ordered off the lunch menu were charged full price. Our food was on one receipt, and the manager kept on entering it incorrectly. Finally after the third try a different manager comes to my table to clarify what happened with the receipt. He knew what happened to my salad because he comped it but didn't even apologize for MY experience, just apologized for changing the receipt so many times. I am still in shock at how horrific the experience was. Just wow."
Michael M.,"Lincoln, NE",9,16,8,5.0,1/11/2015,The waiter was great.  I wish I could remember his name.   The food was out pretty fast.  Had a cheeseburger and it was done just the way I liked it.
Jessica G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,1,1.0,2/2/2015,"Spent $350 PLUS tip for 4 adults 3 kids. Service was meeting the BARE minimum at best. A lot of staff just clustered around the host stand. Had empty glasses for approx. half of our meal. Not at all what we expected for the price. To make me even MORE angry, my husband, my little son and I, were SICK ALL NIGHT.  Upon calling my mom and sister, they were sick as well. Worst, my sister is pregnant and really doesn't need to be more sick than she already is! Whatever it was that we ate yesterday night at the good ol' cheesecake... had our factory's running. Needless to say, we are both at work today, suffering.  We will NEVER go back.  I didn't call management directly, because I have a feeling that they wont care at all. If management is a reflection of the staff that they hire... I don't think that the call would be worth my time. The apology will be half hearted and insulting... and they will probably assume that I am making all this up.  BEWARE OF GETTING SICK HERE!   I don't know how this place makes so much money!! YOU SHOULD BE EMBARASSED."
Cindy T.,"Chandler, AZ",252,160,55,4.0,7/13/2014,"Had a really good meal at this Cheesecake Factory last night.  We went with a large group of ten and our server did a FANTASTIC job of being attentive and keeping everything straight; even keeping track of 4 different checks without a hitch.  I had the miso salmon which I tend to enjoy at most Cheesecake Factorys but last nights was especially good.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Most of our party enjoyed their meals.  There was a small hiccup when one of our meals had what looked like brillo in it but it turned out to be charred corn silk.  The server and manager were very professional and took care of it by quickly expediting a new one as well as taking it off the bill.  Other than that, another good time and meal at the Cheesecake Factory."
Kacee F.,"Rio Verde, AZ",8,202,2,2.0,4/24/2014,"Well, we went here on a Monday night to celebrate a birthday.  We made a reservation for 730pm and waited until 8pm to be seated, they kept telling us they did not have any seats for a party of 5 - their reasoning for the long wait.  They were also under staffed and did not have enough cooks on this day which added to the longer than average wait time for food.  Whitney, our waitress was very helpful and accommodating.   We waited over 30 minutes for our food and by the time we ordered the food, the place was half empty so no real reason why it would take so long except to say the manager should have called in more help, but didn't. The Kale and Quinoa app salad is bigger than small like the waitress said and can be a full meal in itself.  I had to send it back because they first brought it out without any Quinoa and grapes, when I got it back the 2nd time it was loaded with flavor, grapes and Quinoa plus the buttermilk dressing was excellent with it.   Also the incredible egg plant sandwich on brown bread was a hit and actually it was much better eaten alone instead of with the bread.  The Chinese chicken salad was just okay nothing to rave about as was the rest of the food - just ok - fettuccine, market burger, lettuce wraps, just ok nothing wow..  The cheesecakes again were just ok nothing to rave about - the banana cream needed more banana flavor and more cream, the mango key lime needed to be a bit more tart and the guey yellow stuff on top of the mango key lime is terrible and should be taken off.  the only cheesecake which was good was the original.  This place is hit and miss - sometimes everything is amazing and other times well just ok...."
Cherie K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,121,20,4.0,8/2/2014,"They are trying harder, that's evident at half price cheesecake days recently. We had the salmon and sugarless cheesecake. Ryan Lague explained each dish we ordered despite the huge crowd. He was so patient with us snd we were so impressed with his knowledge of the ccf. Paula Cardenas was really doing a great job handling the crowd. She listened to my story about ehat I forgot now and she didn't roll her eyes once!  I'm sure it was appropo to the situation."
Kat R.,"Bellevue, WA",93,113,52,4.0,7/18/2012,"This is your typical large-scale chain American food restaurant that wins on customer service and consistency. A bonus is the portion sizes are large enough for two meals and their amazing desserts.  All the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke.  The service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table. One of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday.  One downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor.  Oh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me.  This a great place for two people or large groups. Bear in mind the noise level can be a bit loud so come later in the day if you want a quiet meal."
Diane F.,"Towaco, NJ",0,4,,1.0,11/24/2014,"Got take out since the restaurant was very busy on Saturday night.  Ordered a burger with salad.  Refrigerated the salad within 10-15 minutes after picking it up to eat the next day and ate the burger, which was fine even if it was cooked medium rather than the well-done requested.  After eating the salad the next evening, I had diarrhea and vomiting a few hours after eating until the next morning. I obviously won't be back."
Daniel L.,"Naperville, IL",18,144,20,4.0,11/22/2012,"Attended a large family party here last night.  Haven't been to one of these places in years, and I was pleasantly surprised by not only the quality of the food, but the service as well! I would highly recommend it.  Portions are ridiculously large, the service was fantastic.  For my main course, I got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and I got the lemon-raspberry cheesecake and it was unbelievably light and flavorful. Definitely worth a trip.  It's not earth-shattering, but it's definitely a very very solid establishment."
Shar B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",154,205,,4.0,6/3/2012,"We were feeling courageous on a Friday night at 6pm to try and have dinner here, as it had been a while.   We were lucky to get in right away, as there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes.   We were seated and promptly served warm bread and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it and she was pleasant, even though the restaurant was PACKED.  The app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced. The bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments. I enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).   Overall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not). For a chain restaurant, this restaurant, especially this location is worth it."
