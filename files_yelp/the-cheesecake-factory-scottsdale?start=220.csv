Maria J.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,19,10,5.0,4/10/2013,"I don't often go to dinner here, but mostly for happy hour, again this mama like to go out but lives on a budget. They have a little good happy hour that I think we should all take advantage of it once it a while. Do no the big fancy building intimidate you, they have cocktails and delicious appetizers for $5.00 each. I am South American so I always go for my MOJITOS!! epa! The bartender, Ryan, a.k.a. Carlos (My friend couldn't remember his name so we decided to call him Carlos and he is ok with it, but it's Ryan) We also order the Avocado eggrolls and the Chinese salad. My friends loves the margaritas, but I am not a tequila drinker (for obvious reasons since I am a light wright). Oh, and my favorite: The Peach Bellinis!!! They are not part of the happy hour menu but they are amazing!!! Please do not leave the restaurant without sharing a piece of cheesecake. The upside down pineapple is amazing!! One day after a movie date with this guy, we went there for late coffee and a cheesecake, it was nice, romantic, and sweet!! Just throwing some romantic ideas for you boys!! (wink, wink...)    If you ever go the Scottsdale location and sit a the bar, ask for Carlos, he will probably have a laugh and will know exactly who and how you know his name LOL"
Chad K.,"Phoenix, AZ",104,25,1,2.0,2/27/2011,"I can't recommend The Cheesecake Factory. When you flip through the menu, you'll see why -- it has too much variety. Variety sounds like a good thing at first, but you've heard the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none,"" right? The Cheesecake Factory is worse than a typical chain restaurant, it's a chain restaurant that has no focus or mission. It's a restaurant that, because of the sheer numbers of dishes it serves, can't possibly concentrate on any of them long enough to make them well. On a menu like this, choice is more a crap shoot than an opportunity."
Brad L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,252,39,5.0,2/17/2014,The food and service were excellent tonight at the cheesecake factory.  Stephanie was excellent over-the-top very attentive to our refills on our sodas.  She would come back every five minutes to check on us.  I love the chicken tacos on the skinny menu
Jessica S.,"Phoenix, AZ",302,82,105,4.0,1/5/2011,"Bring your reading glasses for the menu! It a big chain so not too much to say. Surroundings- Its huge , menu is overwhelming and has advertising with I find annoying. Staff- Some of the best.  Eats- cant complain, I can eat the pizzettes all day long for 4.95 all day long! The ricotta and sausage or the Pear and goat cheese is the best! Have a go , you wont be sorry!"
Jenifer R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",168,192,34,4.0,8/12/2011,"Had a wonderful lunch with my sister and friend yesterday. We ordered the calamari, Oriental salad and the eggplant sandwich. All three were delish. Vanilla bean cheesecake was terrific. We all shared. Our waiter was awesome. Always a great time at the Factory."
John M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,17,,1.0,4/25/2013,"With a huge menu, they still don't have a gluten free desert, and not much else is gluten free. Allergen data is not available. I tried the one cheese cake (Godiva) where only the top layer was supposed to have a tiny bit of gluten, but I got a couple of bites into it before I remembered to take off the top layer. Now I'm sick. That a popular restaurant like this has gluten throughout almost everything, and no information about it, is a slap in the face to those of us with serious gluten allergies."
LuckieMaounds P.,"Coppell, TX",153,594,6,3.0,9/26/2010,They now have smaller lunch-sized portions (which are still enough for two and average 1300 calories). But it's still a smaller portion and a smaller price on top of that.  Service is always excellent - staff bends over backward for you. How nice is that at a chain shop??
Charles S.,"Phoenix, AZ",184,18,69,4.0,8/29/2011,"I have been too this cheesecake factory twice now. Once to have..of course cheesecake, and the other to actually have dinner and a few drinks.  The first experience was great, waitress was there when we needed her and we received our cheesecake in a timely manor and of course was amazing.  The 2nd time there was very limited seating, we had ordered a appetizer and had taken our time with it, the table we were sitting at was big enough for if that, 2 plates. Our entrees had come and we were cramped for room, but as soon as a table opened up, the waiter was happy to seat us in a booth and move our food.  I had the Hibachi steak which was a perfect choice. Rare like i asked, and full of flavor.  overall, i am extremely happy with this place and hope not to have a bad experience!"
Rene B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",190,16,,5.0,2/16/2011,We have eaten here on several occasions and have always loved it. The food and service are awesome.  All of the portions are quite large and always good.  The desserts are extremely good. The menu is quite varied and there is something for everyone; this is our first choice to take company out for dinner.
Paige H.,"Basalt, CO",0,9,3,2.0,11/30/2013,"We use this as a go to safe bet when we are traveling. This was really bad. We ordered salad and the chicken and fish on top was dry and gross. My son had a side of fruit with his meal and there was an onion piece a a corn kernel in his brown soggy excuse for fruit. Then the waiter brought back the same fruit dish when we complained.  The quality here has hit a low. I know it's a chain, but any where else it has been fine, even in Salt Lake City with no bar.  We couldn't wait to get out if there. Didn't even go for dessert."
Angela M.,"Hollywood, CA",8,59,,3.0,6/5/2012,"Threw a friend's baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly. We made reservations well in advance, and it was a small party. I'm not a huge fan of their food but it's always busy so clearly other people don't have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just don't think the cheesecake is that great, I'm sorry! But the apps aren't too bad."
Corey M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,25,,4.0,8/26/2013,"This place is pretty solid no matter which city you are in. The menu is long, which is pretty amazing that they can offer as many different food options they do and they all taste good!"
Joseph L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,14,,1.0,1/2/2014,"Told the server I had a bad allergy, and it still ended up in my food.  Management had the decency to tell me what happened, but comped out just an appetizer and not the whole meal."
Magic M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,130,,3.0,10/20/2014,I like coming here when  I feel like a local night out. Cheesecake factory is a nice way to wrap up dinner and a movie with some coffee and cake. The entree's are ok. Pretty much everything is reheated or deep fried from large frozen bags. The portions are big and the ambience is upscale casual. Stick with coffee and cake out on the patio on a nice night and you can't go wrong.
Ken F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1274,755,8717,4.0,1/4/2011,Cheesecake factory is the definition of corporate american food. But here at least they do a very good job. Very diverse menu with many interesting things to order and try. Usually when a restaurant has 20 different types of food none of them are good. Of course they have great cheesecakes and other desserts. A great place for a large gathering for a party. This staff is well trained very nice and very helpful. They also have a nice happy hour in the bar area. I guess these are some reasons I keep going back.
Kara M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",57,24,7,3.0,8/24/2010,"I'm not a huge fan of their food, but their cheesecake is amazing. Maybe I order the wrong thing?  LOVE the Oreo cheesecake."
J S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,34,,4.0,12/3/2014,"I love the food at cheesecake factory. I can't go there often though because they don't have organic non chemicalized products. If they had non GMO chicken and organic salads i would be back. But because like most restaurants they use the GMO foods now, i have to prepare my own foods at home. Look up GMO. Cheesecake factory should offer a non GMO menu for people who would pay a little less for food that is healthy."
Rachel R.,"Brooklyn, NY",421,637,54,2.0,1/27/2012,"When people say, ""The Cheesecake Factory"", what I hear is ""The Diarrhea Refinery""."
Nicole H.,"Mesa, AZ",55,28,,4.0,4/19/2013,Always a great place to go for lunch. The avocado egg rolls are amazing!
Heather V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",58,50,7,5.0,2/7/2012,FAVORITE restaurant EVER! Lovve the cheesecake flavors and everything I've ever had. I don't feel like this place needs to be reviewed but I had the most amazing meal this weekend and had to rave about it! Delish! Enough said.
