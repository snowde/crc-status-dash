Jackie S.,"Cave Creek, AZ",0,22,,1.0,6/3/2013,"Very disappointed. Our office has gone there numerous times in the past and recently went back after not being there for about a year. The quality has definitely gone down. 2 of the entrees were sent back, my fish tacos were very sparse with no flavor,and the slices of cheesecake that we ordered had gotten alot smaller than they used to be. I don't think our office will be going back there.The only really good thing was our server."
Dame F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,8,2,5.0,6/3/2013,I enjoyed their Brunch Combo. The scrambled eggs were awesome topped with their pico de gallo.
Ed D.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",1244,394,455,3.0,8/19/2012,"Have eaten here several times in the past. Have always been happy with the food quality and the service (try the Memphis Burger!). If you go in the winter, the busy season, be prepared to walk a LONG distance, parking in this plaza BLOWS."
Brooke S.,"Long Beach, CA",164,70,6,1.0,8/22/2011,"I'm usually a fan of cheesecake factory. I've been going since I was a kid. It's usually consistent. This trip however was very different. Appetizer (spinach, artichoke, cheese dip) was good, my little ones grilled cheese was fine, but our chicken chipotle pasta was terrible. The flavor was fine, but the pasta wasn't even near cooked all the way. After we sent it away the manager said that their pasta machine was acting up! Why are they making pasta if the ""cooker"" is broken? Can they not make pasta in an old school pot with water? I didn't ask for anything else. We ordered a key lime cheesecake to go and went home. The cheesecake was the best part of our meal."
Jennifer M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",68,23,13,3.0,4/3/2012,"Normally, service here is excellent. But tonight? FAIL. We're regulars at the Scottsdale location; it's walking distance from home!  Well tonight we waited quite a longer time than usual for our dinner. Even the manager came over to apologize as well as our waitress. No offer of a discount on our bill, free desert, nothing! We're not the type to be verbal, but when both the mgr and waitress are aware of an issue, and does nothing for the customer....thats an even bigger disappointment. :("
D R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,17,1,2.0,3/28/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory seems to have traded quality for quantity to appeal to a different type of diner. I was very disappointed in the meal which was huge and tasteless. It reminded me of Mimi's, another restaurant that i will be sure not to frequent. The desert (cheesecake) was good."
James S.,"San Francisco, CA",11,118,59,1.0,10/14/2011,"Horrible service at the bar. Empty glasses ignored. Never asked if food was ok. Watched the bartender text on his phone. Other bartender Steve had the personality of a lint ball. We were one of two parties at the bar, really?. Fail. In this economy both of these fools should be fired."
Brandie W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,9,,3.0,8/5/2014,Their cheesecake and food is amazing however the service is terrible. Waited 15 min to get my check and then another 15 min for the server to return with my credit card. If you are in a hurry skip this place!
Jana S.,"Chicago, IL",175,126,1,4.0,1/25/2010,"I hate chains...and yes, I admit, we went here yesterday. But you know what? Cheesecake is freakin solid. I've tried hating this place and decided to give up. The five of us ventured here yesterday to indulge. We ordered the following: Ahi Tartare, Calamari, Chicken Marcel, Chicken Teriyaki, Salmon, Cobb Salad, Four Season Pizza, Bloody Mary, AND coffee/espresso... yes we were pigs.  My favorite is the Ahi Tartare. The Ahi is fresh and the dish is just perfect. I also tried the Calamari, and was very surprised. The seasoning was awesome, and the portion was great for us to share. A little on the greasy side, but still very good.  All of the entrees were awesome as well, with plenty of leftovers. And the salads are always yummy.  The service was solid as well.  Do I feel like a corporate chain loving whore? Yes. Is it ok to feel that way at times? Absolutely. My tummy agrees."
Steve B.,"Thompson-Nicola Regional District, Canada",0,41,,4.0,2/7/2013,Haven't been in awhile and on our last vacation took the family. love the surroundings and food although portions are large! Great to to place.
Samantha O.,"Phoenix, AZ",922,337,140,3.0,4/15/2009,I don't really like cheesecake factory. they have an amazing caesar salad but other than that i don't like anything. their strawberry shortcake is made with biscuits. what is that all about? way to ruin strawberries. I do have to agree with Lorena that it is great for groups and the servers are usually pretty awesome
Kelly R.,"Phoenix, AZ",469,243,849,5.0,2/27/2012,"I love this place! Especially this location! I recently went for happy hour to celebrate a late Valentine's Day, and omg! My mouth is still watering from the delish dishes we had! It was definitely a comfort food evening for us, and we were extremely comfortable. We were seated in a corner booth, for privacy, without even having to request so. I wish I remembered our server's name, but he kept both our iced teas full, and he never kept us waiting or looking for him. The buffalo chicken wrap things are my new favorite guilty pleasure food. I can't wait to go back! And the turtle cheesecake! MMMMM!!"
Roma M.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",241,439,157,3.0,3/6/2010,The thing about chains is it's generally the service that makes all the difference. I visited this location as well as the 2402 E Camelback Rd location.  The most notable difference being the amount of people at the other location versus this one. It was startlingly empty for dinner and yet the servers were remarkably busy.  This visit wasn't memorable.
E B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,1,1.0,7/11/2014,"We ate here today for lunch.  Although the food and service is good, the cleanliness procedures are bad.  Flatware is placed directly on table top where people put there dirty elbows, purses, even sit there kids and dirty diapers.  Also, I wanted a refill of diet coke and the waitress asked a customer at a nearby table if he wanted tea refill.  She took both our glasses. When she returned,  my diet coke tasted like tea at the bottom!  She mixed my glass refill with a total stranger!"
Jenna W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",38,124,16,5.0,4/12/2011,"This is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in AZ.  We brought a party of 9 on a Saturday around 6pm, so we were afraid we'd be waiting for hours.  We arrived and were greeted by friendly, organized staff at the front desk.  A manager quickly walked the restaurant and found a section that we could be seated at within 40 minutes.  We expected the wait and waited only about 30 before we were seated.  I had 2 small children and 4 teenage girls...I thought dinner would be mahem.  The waitress was attentive and the food quality was wonderful.  She even came back to make conversation with my daughter and her friends and explained menu items to them.  The value was great too, we fed all 9 people appetizers, dinner and desserts for less than $200."
Kym M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,18,,4.0,5/18/2014,"Even though this is a chain restaurant, I love the vibe. The am also grateful for the new gluten free menu. The service is also great. I only wish they would bring back their beet burger (the way it was made about 8 years ago).  Hint, hint...."
Man-is-h ..,"Carlsbad, CA",2,120,11,4.0,9/6/2011,"The cheescake was standard Cheescake factory fare, so it was above average buy below spectacular. The service, however was amazing. Probably better than any other chesscake factory I ahve been too.  courtisy was spilling over by everyone in the place, from the hostess to the server to the busboys. the manager even came over and asked if everything was OK."
Alex R.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,60,5,1.0,3/25/2012,"Lots of choices but the food always seems to be bland for the price. And more then once I got the orange chicken and it tasted weeeeird. If your in Scottsdale there are so many better places to eat, I can't understand how this place gets so busy."
Nicole L.,"San Antonio, TX",199,168,226,3.0,5/16/2011,"Not a big fan of chain restaurants but my friend convinced me to go and since I developed a bit of a sweet tooth figured I would have a slice of cheesecake. I have to admit, it was not bad. First of all, I love the Kierland shopping area. Nothing beats it in AZ for outdoor shopping. Even though I was not really hungry, I ended up ordering some dinner and then cheesecake. (not much for not being hungry, eh?) I was enticed to order dinner because of their ""special menu"" which was a bit lower priced and only one page. I do not enjoy their novel sized menu so a one sheet menu made finding something sounding tasty easy to find. I typically only order food that I cannot make at home, but tonight I went with the mashed red potatoes, broccoli and chicken cutlet dinner. Not bad and tasted about how I would make it at home, haha. But, let me tell you about the cheesecake I had. The red velvet cheesecake cake. WOW. If you like red velvet cake, and I mean real red velvet cake, not just red dyed cake, you have to eat this. That was by far the most impressive thing I ate here. The food overall is decent and flavorful. Service decent. I would NOT want to wear those all white uniforms to work though! No complaints."
Lori M.,"Mesa, AZ",106,313,73,3.0,4/15/2009,"I pretty much come here with large parties (the tables allow for huge groups) or when I just can't make my mind up on what I feel like eating because this place has a little bit of everything.  I've tried quite a few different things on the menu and it has all been pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either. The Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic (tell them to hold some of the garlic) are among my favorites. And the cheesecake is always good. Lots of different varieties. Snickers, turtle, tuxedo, strawberry, etc. They are all good. But I've never met a piece of cheesecake I didn't devour."
