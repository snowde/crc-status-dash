Sonya D.,"San Diego, CA",1610,651,37,4.0,1/2/2013,"I went here with my parents on a super crowded Friday evening. We had to wait about 40 min, but decided to order a couple of drinks while we waited. Once we finally got seated, I decided to order the Chicken Madeira, which is their most popular dish. It was sooo good! It was a huge portion, but I somehow managed to finish it. I can see why everyone loves it! My dad ordered the Ahi and had to get them cook it more b/c it was practically raw and cold. It was probably supposed to be like that, but he didn't know what he was getting himself into. They took extra care in getting this done - both our waiter and the manager came over to make sure they were on the same page as my dad before cooking it more thoroughly. They also brought my dad a complimentary house salad while he waited. We decided to end our meals by all splitting a piece of their Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. OMG. So good. Most importantly, we found that the service at this location was really good! Our waiter was funny, and rolled with the punches...nothing seemed to phase him."
L C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,2.0,8/25/2011,"It had been a while since our last visit, so we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory.  Every time we leave CF, I seem to end up wondering why we went there in the first place, and of course it all comes back to me once we get home and eat our cheesecake -- which has never disappointed! This trip, I had an Asian-type salad, which did not have enough dressing for my taste, so I asked our server for extra, which she promptly delivered to our table.  The menu indicated that the salad came with chicken, but I kept stirring my salad around, wondering where all the chicken was.  There were a few VERY THIN strips and that's it.  I don't think I would be exaggerating to say it was less than half a chicken breast. My husband had a chicken pasta dish, which he said was flavorful (and smelled good!) but, once again, there was very little chicken hiding in between the ginormous bowl of pasta pieces.   I really have a personal policy to not complain to the manager about things like that, as I don't want to tick off the kitchen staff by sending food  back.  The exception to my rule, of course, is if there is a hair, critter, etc., in the food - - then I send it back and go home without.   Next time, we'll more than likely just be stopping by for take-home cheesecake..."
Chukki S.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,1020,289,4.0,2/28/2011,"Good food, but it's a little pricey.  If you can afford it or go during happy hour, you'll be all right."
Larry J.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,29,,3.0,4/4/2014,"I have eaten there many times and find it to be a ok dinning experience, It is really just a higher class of Denny's with a much larger menu . we find the food to be generally bland and not all that well presented. However the portions are large and the staff very friendly and well trained ."
Christina B.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,105,1,4.0,2/23/2012,"We don't have these in NY, so I go when I travel.  I love their passion fruit iced tea.  I love their brown bread with butter.  I love the cajun chicken jambalaya.  yes, the portions are ridiculous.  I try to never ever finish my entree if I can help it.  The food is not haute cuisine, but it is really good."
Sara B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,152,79,2.0,1/6/2011,"Now I remember why I didn't go back: mediocrity.  I'm not much for chains to begin with, but this place is so strange and I cannot fathom why anyone would wait in line to eat here (or, pick a location, because the menu's are the same). I tried to order the crabcake sandwich and asked the (not-so-nice-fake-smiling) waitress if the brioche had any seeds or nuts on it and she said ""no"". Sure enough, it came with sesame seeds slathered all over the bun (why or why are there sesame seeds on every friggin bun in this country?). I sent it back and the waitress came over and said ""sorry, I didn't know...do you want me to bring it back?"" I've never been asked such a stupid question....ever! My husband had the fish and chips and the fish was greasy, the fries were boring and the cole slaw was good.  Seriously, there are some great places to eat here, so why bother with a chicken on everything, nut on everything, corn on everything mediocre meal?"
Suzanne C.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,29,,4.0,2/27/2011,Food and service great as always. I've never had a bad experience at any of the Cheesecake Factory locations.
Louis N.,"Chico, CA",10,57,11,3.0,1/4/2012,Corn cakes are good. Wontons not so much goopy. Chicken sandwich was good could be spicier spread.
Christopher B.,"Miami Beach, FL",294,571,606,4.0,1/16/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has been a reliable restaurant to me no matter the location.  The menu is diverse, the food is consistently good, and the service is generally solid.  This all rang true for my experience here as well."
Sheila L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",282,451,240,2.0,7/11/2011,"We had the wierdest waitress, she said she had been there for several years but she was really blah about it all. the food is always good here, and they have good green tea."
Tom C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,99,2,3.0,12/31/2011,"I generally enjoy the Cheesecake Factory; I hope this experience turns out to be a ""one off.""   The waiter ""Mike"" was very good, attentive, ""on top of things.""  The appetizers were Corn Fritters (very good), Fried Zucchini (very good but not much on the plate), and Artichoke and Spinach dip, (tasty but very, very oily).  The others ordered Burgers, Salads, Orange Chicken....all generally pleased. My dinner was the Shepard's Pie, very large plate with a large circular dollop of mashed potatoes on top. It looked great....one bite later and all I could taste was ""cumin.""  So overpowering I couldn't eat it. It seems that seasonings come into vogue and pass from the scene every year.  In this case, the current spice of the month, quarter, perhaps year is ""cumin,"" a spice which does wonders in minute quantities, and is ruinous in large doses.  Unfortunately, the cook at the Scottsdale Cheesecake Factory uses a ruinous amount in the Shepard's Pie.  I decided that while I waited for Mike to return to the table I'd eat the mashed potatoes from the the top of the Shepard's Pie....wrong; too salty to eat. If the person who made the mashed potatoes couldn't taste the salt long before it reached that level, there is something seriously wrong with their taste buds; combined with the overwhelming amount of cumin in the Shepard's Pie ( a dish not known for its ""cumin like"" qualities) it leaves you wondering how this person got into a cooking position. Back to Mike....he was ready to make it right...took an order for something else, stayed with it to ensure I got my replacement meal quickly an in general took excellent care of a table of 5 like a pro."
Sarah C.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,62,8,4.0,4/16/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory! I've been to this location several times. The management is very active and concerned with the individual customer and the food is amazing of course. My mom and I were there on wednesday night, it was busy for a weeknight, but the service was good and the waiter took his time with us. We originally were seated at a small table sandwiched between a group of teenagers and a woman that was (literally) screaming in my mothers ear (I believe she had some old-age hearing loss). I went to the hostess booth and requested to be moved outside, and the hostess moved us without problem.  We ordered the Orange chicken and Bellagio chicken and shared both of them. Both dishes were delicious and distinctive. The portions were big enough to have food left over for the following day. We finished off with Godiva cheesecake and Kaluah cheesecake. Everything was incredible. $72 dollars for two people is not what I would call cheap, but it was an amazing meal and well worth it. :)"
Adnan Z.,"Katy, TX",71,53,,4.0,5/17/2011,"I like chains, what can I say I want something predictable. On vacation in Scottsdale we hit up the CF. The misses had the Crab Wontons for dinner. She loves the sauce. The little princess had the kids cheese pizza, that makes her happy. I had the Hibachi steak. The mushrooms, asparagus and wasabi mashed potatos are always filling."
Kaitlin M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2014,"It was my birthday and I went here with my family. We were seated and waited about 10 minutes. A server told us she would be right with us. We waited about another 10 minutes. She brought bread to the table, didn't say a word, and left us again. She didn't bring us water, drinks, or take our order. After waiting about 25 minutes we got up and left. We go to this Cheesecake factory a few times a month and usually have good service, but because of this service it is highly unlikely we will ever return. There were many other servers that we could see were not busy, and not one of them came up when they could clearly see we had been waiting a long time. We then went across the street and received great service from True Food, as expected. Extremely disappointed in our experience at the Cheesecake Factory."
Lauren E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",24,367,,3.0,3/23/2011,"This place is pretty good for a chain, and it's very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own."
Samara A.,"Phoenix, AZ",91,91,1,3.0,3/15/2010,"3 stars because there is no one that can not find something they like on this menu! -2 stars because it makes you remember why yelpers like local business.  This place is overrun by teenage yuppies paying their way through Prada with a part time waiting job.  Other than that, this place is really good; lighting is awesome and actually had a co-worker explain that the lighting 'calmed' him. If lighting in a crowded restaurant can do that, it has succeeded in that way.  Food wasn't overcooked, but portions were way to large-no way even the men in my party could finish theirs.  If we not glutton out on fried macaroni and eat smaller portion sizes, perhaps we can solve this little obesity issue."
sarah s.,"Scottsdale, AZ",27,85,7,2.0,7/26/2010,"I was so excited to go get my cheesecake factory fix for the year and then I remembered why I only go once every 14 months, if that.  :( server was super awkward and not very personable...but I really liked their small plates menu, great way to try a few things, keep on budget and not stuff your face before it's time for a piece of their cheesecake."
Roland W.,"Phoenix, AZ",323,379,15,4.0,6/8/2008,"I almost hate to give The Cheesecake Factory four stars, only becasue it's a chain.  The food isn't that bad and we had a great server, otherwise it would be three stars. She knew everything on the menu by heart and for those of you who haven't been there, it's a huge menu to know. It was easy to make substitutions and the timing was perfect. Could the food have been better, yes but service is a big part of it too! My partner and I were hungry, didn't know what we wanted, didn't have much in the fridge due to my travel schedule and wanted something close to home. I suggested The Cheesecake Factory and he said ""I was just thinking about that"" so off we went. There wasn't a wait (another big plus) and the service as mentionioned above was just right. All in all a good experience. I wouldn't go there on a busy weekend night where I had to wait to eat here, it wouldn't be worth it."
Suzanne B.,"San Francisco, CA",287,490,22,2.0,8/7/2006,Words of advice for large chain restaurants: 1.  Refrain from telling a large party that ordering food and drinks at the same time 'will slow down the kitchen' 2.  Try to hire servers who can tell position one from position six - being able to count is a bonus 3.  Corollary to #1 - Telling us 'most of it will come out cold anyway' is not the way to increase your tip Stars received are for the nice hostess who seated us and the very delicious (and large) salad I ate.  Our waiter receives no stars.
Jim P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5,5,1,4.0,9/19/2011,Amazing menu... Chopped salad is amazing. Great service!
