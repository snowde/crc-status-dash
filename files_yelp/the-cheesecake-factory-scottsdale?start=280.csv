John S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,28,,1.0,7/23/2012,"Have dined there many times. Best chicken piccata around. But got bad Salmon on Sat. night ended up with food poisoning,tasted OK but very sick later. Will avoid the salmon at all cost."
Pucci P.,"New York, NY",15,147,135,5.0,1/11/2006,"Who doesn't love the cheesecake factory?  It's huge booklike menu consists of something for everyone.  Start off with one of their many signature cocktails.  My favorite appetizer is the chicken lettuce wraps.  They offer huge salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees.  Oh yeah and they also serve cheesecake!"
C P.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,6,,1.0,3/23/2014,Horrible experience first the bathroom was nasty with no toilet paper and i let the server know idk if the cleaned it then we ordered and i ordered my steak medium well and it came to me charred on the outside and medium rare in the inside so i sent it back and then the manager came over and apologized and had them make me a new one and gave me a crown and coke for free so i was ok... so i ordered a piece of cheesecake while i waited... the cheesecake was awful it was grainy and not set it should of stayed in the cooler at least another 30 mins to set but they served it instead which shows that they dont care about their products and whether it was good to serve to their customer I had two bites of it and pushed it away then i waited 20 mins and the steak came again and it was medium.... so i sent it all back...again not what i asked for....  so i asked for the manager and he came and i explained what was wrong and what happened and he apologized which was fine and he comped my meal but still i left there the same way I came in which was hungry.... The manager and waitress were nice and tried to fix it but obviously the rest of the staff doesnt care about the product or its presentation to the customer and they take no pride in their work.
Herkemer F.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,37,3,4.0,9/27/2012,"We really like Cheesecake Factory, but eat there only on special occasions since it's so pricey. We also don't have one in Prescott, so we can only eat there when we go down the hill to Scottsdale. This trip we went there for dessert after eating dinner elsewhere. Great cheesecake!"
A B.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,351,,3.0,7/15/2009,"I have found the food and service at this Cheesecake Factory to be consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I have done dine-in and takeout at this location, and have not had any issues. Personally, my three favorite entrées are the Grilled Pork Chops, Beef Ribs, and Miso Salmon. Buffalo Blasts are my favorite of the appetizers. Service is friendly and prompt."
Jack K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,28,2,4.0,1/21/2009,"I had a really great server there who checked back to my table often, and knew the menu very well.  The wait to get our food was longer than expected, and the food was fine.  Very large menu with lots of desserts.  They have some delicious cheesecake, obviously.   When me and my family got there, we didn't have to wait to long (maybe 5-10 min.) and the meal pleased everyone.  The theme is like an ancient Egyptian style with interesting paintings on the ceiling  and good lighting.   Of all the times I've gone there, I've had good servers, and food."
Butterfly W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,41,,2.0,3/29/2010,"Had a sad experience there this past weekend.  Normally I would give it a 4 star review for the fresh strawberry martini, chicken chopped salad , pizettes, Jamaican Shrimp and of course the cheesecake.  However, this last experience was bordering on nightmarish there.  Overpacked as usual on a weekend, we took first available seating which was outside.  A litte chilly, but ok.  The table was slanted on an angle which made things interesting and not in a good way.  Then the heater went out.  We were then gassed by 3 different people trying to light it to no avail, even after we asked them to stop trying as the gas smell was so bad.  They refused to stop and literally left a huge stench of gas which turned our stomachs the rest of the time we were there and the non-working heater also left us in pretty much dark and cold.   We ordered and the appetizer never came until the meals did which took quite a long time.  10 minutes after ordering, the waiter came back to say the item our friend ordered was out and she had to pick something else.  She said ""please give me a minute"" and he stood there.  She said it again, ""I'm going to need a minute ""and he finally went oh, and backed off from looming over her then took quite a while to return.   When meals did arrive, one did not come until 10 minutes after the rest.  My salad had mystery ingredients in it in addition to the normal ingredients (5 black beans and some stuff I had no idea what it was in the dim light).  It tasted funny and the waiter never asked why there were oddities lined up on the side of the bowl or why I did not come close to finishing it.    It was not a stellar night for the staff  or food that evening!"
Kim A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",32,54,,3.0,3/20/2010,"Always one of my favorites, can't go wrong with the chicken Madeira ( my favorite dish there). The chili was great too. One of the only places that no matter how full I am it is a must to get dessert."
Brian C.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",1,5,,4.0,1/17/2013,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in two years.  Wow  I forgot how great this restaurant is.  Went here last night and it was great.  Service was on top of everything.  I ordered off the skinnylicous menu.  I had the Shrimp Creole, it was great huge portion with great flavor.  My wife had the salmon, it was a little dry but she still enjoyed.  We didn't get any desert but I am still thinking about the Oreo Deluxe Cheesecake, it looked amazing."
Stew K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",236,134,42,3.0,9/16/2009,"This is a great place to eat ""except"" they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service. On occasion when my wife and I stop on for lunch, there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another's meal. Given there are 2 of us? That translates to them hitting the mark 50% of the time. The menu selection is awesome. The dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service, try the appetiser salad of pecan, endive and blue cheese. The take out cheese cake cant be beat."
Andrew E.,"Dallas, TX",58,91,6,4.0,4/17/2008,"The best aspect of TCF is the ambiance. The interior of the restaurant is an Egyptian theme (I don't see the connection) and it is perfectly lit and outfitted for a dining experience. The food is so-so, with reasonable prices. The cuisine is a mix of traditional and American. I enjoyed our waiter, who seemed to be a Marketing major at ASU by the way his conversation with us led. I enjoyed myself during the dinner, and obviously loved the cheesecake afterward. I'll be back, but I'm not sure when. It's a bit out of the way from my neighborhood, and the area has a lot of options. I think Mastro's is next...."
Georgia R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",220,708,405,3.0,2/6/2007,"When your menu is 30 pages long (okay, I tend to exaggerate) and filled with Italian, Asian, Mexican, American and so on food choices, you just start to wonder just how good the food's going to be. I think this is exactly the Cheesecake Factory's problem.  With such an extensive menu that offers food from every ethnic group, it's no wonder that they're unable to excel in anything.  I just think they tried too hard to appease everyone instead of focusing one on or two ethnic food groups and ended up with food that is just okay. I wouldn't say that I've had a bad meal here, but I wouldn't say it was good either. The cheesecake on the other hand, is amazing.  They have a huge list, from snickers and reeses to caramel and pumpkin- and they're all equal in their deliciousness.   My advice: Skip dinner and have either apps and dessert or dessert only."
B D.,"Hayward, CA",1,16,,1.0,2/10/2011,Ok this is not a review on the actual location since I have never been to that location.  I had decided last week that I wanted to go there because I wanted a particular cheesecake I had before.  I called them up and asked if they still offered it.  The guy on the phone seemed very rushed but said yes.  So I was planning on going today for dinner and called again.  This time I was transferred to the bakery department.  They told me no that they do not offer that cheesecake anymore.
gb g.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,1,,2.0,3/18/2011,"I've eaten here several times in past years and loved the fare, but recently it's taken a turn for the worse. The deserts will always be great, but you should eat your hot meals somewhere else-- maybe at a different Cheesecake Factory. The portions have shrunk (but the price sure hasn't), and sometimes the food isn't quite what's advertised in the menu (missing ingredients). The service is so-so. That leaves the patron wondering where all the money is going, if it's not showing up in the diner's experience. Very mediocre describes this restaurant."
Ann Marie K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",81,215,17,4.0,6/19/2007,"Any Cheescake on their menu, there is about thirty to choose from, is to die for! I actually can't remember the last time I came here to eat something that wasn't dessert. I find their menu to be to much. The portions on their entrees are huge though if you do eat dinner. I find their food good, but it's not really worth the trip or price. If you want a great cheesecake or any other dessert at a nice place don't hesitate to come here! Their patios are nice and cool at night as well!"
Bil Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",14,212,1,4.0,2/27/2006,"One of the better chain restaurants... not much into cake, but I hear from an impeccable source that theirs is to die for... the menu is huge, with varied selections.  Casual atmosphere..."
