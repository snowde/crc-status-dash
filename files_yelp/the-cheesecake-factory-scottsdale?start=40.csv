Ward R.,"Christiansburg, VA",0,35,2,4.0,10/19/2017,"Delicious as always! We were seated quickly but had to wait a bit on our food and they rush hadn't even hit yet. Our server didn't seem to happy to be there but I've had worse servers, she was attentive. I'd visit again if in the area. If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory the nachos and Chris's outrageous cheesecake are a must!!!"
E Paul L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",55,120,111,4.0,9/21/2015,"After shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter, it's lunch time at the Cheesecake Factory.  Their lettuce wraps with peanut sauce, is TASTY starter.  ALWAYS ONE OF MY FAVORITES..."
Greg B.,"Oceanside, CA",39,139,,4.0,10/16/2016,"I really don't remember when I was at this restaurant last time (it was definitely in NJ), so last Saturday we decided to meet our friend (and she suggested this particular location). At 5:00 PM without reservation we were taken to the table right away (I don't think this was the case for others later). The menu as I remember is a standard Cheesecake menu with a Southwestern twist (tacos, enchiladas, Mexican tortillas, Chili). Ladies ordered  from the SkinnyLicious menu (all selections are at 590 calories and less)  - Veggie Burgers. Truly yours ordered a Tuscan Chicken (also from a SkinnyLicious menu).  One thing which is really a standout  - the service. The waiter was perfect - not rushing with selections, always filling up the waters and the A/C was working full time."
Andrea M.,"Albuquerque, NM",18,7,5,5.0,7/16/2017,"Have not been to Cheesecake Factory in awhile, but was there with friends last night. Ann was out server and did an amazing job. Our food was fantastic and Ann did a great job! Can't wait to go back. Servers make all the difference!"
Georgie M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2925,1212,6397,3.0,3/1/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has a wonderful concept, which accounts for their popularity.  And gift cards from family members are a wonderful idea for places you might not otherwise visit. LOL The three of us came here last night to cash in on one of those gift cards. The suppose fifteen minute wait however morphed into forty minutes. Grrr.  Yet the servers here were all running around, busing tables and dropping off dishes like they were Olympian sprinters. I have never had my/our glasses refilled in such a prompt way before in my life. Incredible! The food (photos) btw is good and I got to finally try Sheldon Cooper's Smokey BBQ Burger. It was great. So too are the cheesecakes.  The best by far is their open fire grilled burgers.  Everything else is just okay.  This isn't our favorite place to dine out.  I've come here a few times by myself just for a burger at lunch. Expensive, but very good and less crazy.  Now I remember many years ago sitting in front of some Kraft employees going home one night on METRA to Northfield, Illinois. They were complaining and laughing on how they couldn't get the cheesecakes that Kraft was thinking of introducing below 1,800 calories per serving. LOL.  In the end, we decided to share the flourless chocolate cake.  Three spoons, three very full diners. Now where's the Lipitor?"
Terrence H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,9,,3.0,3/28/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory.. a large chain restaurant with a massive menu. It's good, nothing crazy. The service was great though. Nice and friendly even on a busy Friday."
Marilyn D.,"Pahrump, NV",8,24,9,1.0,5/21/2017,Our waitress was awesome. Our food was great. The atmosphere however was absolutely insane! We were seated next to a large family with five small children who ran amok screaming at the top of their lungs. The manager spoke to them several times to no avail. Our waitress Victoria took the best care of us and we tipped her generously. Others would be seated in our section and would ask to be moved. We did not get dessert. If you eat here be sure to not sit next to people with small children. If you have small children please don't ruin dinner for everyone near you. Teach your children manners and have respect for those eating around you.
John G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",298,401,861,4.0,7/16/2015,"Cheesecake Factory - pretty much everything I usually avoid in a restaurant choice (trendy/chainy/pricey), but, my visiting Norwegian kids wanted to go there. The bad - 47 page menu - seriously - too many choices! The good - our server was AWESOME!  She had loads of personality, and saved me having to digest the menu by recommending a couple of good options for me.  Two of the kids got the Imperial Chicken - that was a really good dish.  Wish I had ordered it!  One of the gals got the Caesar Salad - it was huge!  My Norwegian daughter got the orange chicken (I prefer Pei Wei's orange chicken, but she enjoyed it).  I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - an Indian themed dish - it was quite good, but next time, I'll get the Imperial Chicken. Then to dessert - cheesecake is a must when you go to the Cheesecake Factory, right?  I got the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake - I'm a dark chocolate fan.  Most everyone got a chocolate, though somebody ordered an Adam's Peanut Butter and we even had someone order a milk shake! Did I mention our server?  She'd toured with one of the Van Zandt brothers, and had some great road stories - great sense of humor - checked in on us just the right amount, and is the reason for 4 stars instead of 3 (did I mention my aversion to big chain restaurants?)."
Joanne B.,"Parker, CO",12,5,,5.0,7/2/2017,"This place is in a beautiful area. The food is FANTASTIC! We ran into a small problem and I don't like to cause attention, I emailed them on their webpage and within minutes a manager contacted me. The small issue was addressed immediately. The customer service is phenomenal.  I was so impressed. I would highly recommend this restaurant and give it the best rating yelp allows. Thanks for taking care of us!"
Jerry F.,"Napa, CA",0,32,3,4.0,6/4/2017,"The quality of the food+service is always good and consistent.  Certainly everything The Cheesecake Factory offers is well above average and satisfying.  The food portions continue to be more than fair.  We noticed that menu prices have moderately increased over the last few years, most likely a result of higher food costs."
Jennifer C.,"New River, AZ",45,1,,2.0,7/14/2016,"EXTRA ""SPECIAL"" INGREDIENT Girl who seated us had a bit of an attitude so I guess the experience kind of started on a sour note, but that's not important enough to be the factor that makes or breaks my dining experience. Food was pretty much as expected, waitress was nice etc. The reason for the 2-star rating was that my husband found a large hoop earring in his salad. Like, large enough that we thought maybe it was a bracelet but it was hard to tell for sure because it was all bent up and slathered in salad dressing. How did they miss that? How did it even get there?! Eww. They were very good about replacing his meal but I don't think we will be returning because I would be worried about what else could have ended up in our food."
Carlos B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",42,20,,1.0,8/20/2016,"I've been to cheesecake numerous times. Mostly out of state. But recently I started to frequent this Scottsdale location. My first time was so so... I believe in second chances do I went ahead and brought my GF and a friend over tonight (7-28-16) at around 10pm.  We walked in and within a minute the host, she was very friendly. We got sat and waited about 10 minutes to get greeted. There were a tons of servers sitting everywhere chit chatting and walking pass us without acknowledging us. I flagged down a server because I had some questions regarding the menu. She was nice but disappeared really fast. Guessing she wasn't our server!!  Our server finally came over and said hi... Honestly she had ZERO energy! Wasn't really attentive, friendly nor recommended any drinks, apps or main courses! She was a order taker and not a waitress!  So we ordered our drinks and then our meals. We ordered the orange chicken, mac n cheese balls and the filet mignon tips which I had maybe 30 times in my lifetime visiting Cheesecake Factory.  Mac was alright, orange chicken was extremely hard to bite into it (overcooked) . That's was my gf meal and she was embarrassed to complain so instead she paid for it and box it up to later throw it in the garbage. I ordered the meat medium and it came out completely raw, literally blood everywhere. The wine sauce was off... Tasted bad... Really bad. Server never came and checked if we were enjoying the meals so I had once again to flag her down. I explained my concern and she offered to take my meal and cook it a bit more. I declined her suggestion and honestly I was a bit offended. After telling her that the sauce tasted bad and the meat wasn't cooked properly, I was expecting a sincere apologies, offered a new meal and not the same one, and lastly the MANAGER never came over to check on us!!! I just felt like you guys didn't care. The server came back after 2 minutes to tell us that indeed the chef wanted to apologize because he forgot one ingredient!?! Really!?! That all I get!? My night is ruined, wasted one hour out of my life and this is the kind of solution you have!?  I worked 12 hours and I was just leaving work and looking forward to eat at my favorite restaurant. Hmm not sure if it still is but I guess I will come back here and there just to buy cheesecake. And ended not eating anything.  I'm extremely upset that after spending one hour at the restaurant I had to go to in n out to get a burger.  But the worst part is that the MANAGER never came over!?! This is unreal and I'm really sad that the Cheesecake Factory is going down on service and quality."
Cyn V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",302,260,7,3.0,1/15/2016,"I have a family of cheesecake lovers! This review is only for the bakery at this location.  I stop by here about 3 to 4 times a year to pick up my order of cheesecake. My dad is obsessed with their low carb cheesecake since he is a diabetic and can indulge in this type of tasty desert once in a while. I'll buy any cheesecake here but it's just so pricey. I'll still keep coming back if the birthday boy or girl sends me a request, but I wouldn't come here voluntarily."
Brian J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",253,1,,5.0,6/15/2017,The dishwasher Daniel Keiser really made sure the plates were extra clean only some poop on mine..
Christopher M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,6,3,5.0,12/24/2016,Love the service excellent food fairly priced drinks and food would come back in a heart beat our waitress is so great!!!!
Latoya N.,"Humble, TX",2,18,13,3.0,5/6/2017,"The Louisiana Pasta left a lot to be desired, but the banana cheesecake more than made up for it."
Shada B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",141,19,3,4.0,2/18/2017,"Always a good choice and with their big menu its easy to find things for everyone. Late hours, good service and options make this place a classic fav of mine."
Leonardo B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",29,10,17,5.0,12/24/2016,Everything was amazing I had the chicken carbonara and my girlfriend had fish and chips and also tuxedo cheesecake we had Evelyn as a waitress and she is a blast definitely recommend her
Richard R.,"Grayslake, IL",0,18,,3.0,2/10/2017,"We have been to Cheesecake many times and have always enjoyed their food. My wife and I decided on Cheesecake for dinner, we are visiting from Chicago. We were seated promptly which is a rare occurrence at 6:00 PM. Our waitress was very nice.  My wife ordered pot stickers and ahi, both of which she enjoyed. I was not so fortunate. I ordered Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The problem with this dish was the shrimp. Instead of whole shrimp the dish had chopped pieces of what appeared to be bay shrimp or scraps.  The shrimp was coated with bread crumbs which turned into a sticky, gooey mess.  The shrimp were not eatable and I had to scrap the coating off to eat chunks of tasteless shrimp."
Liz B.,"Surprise, AZ",0,21,,5.0,5/4/2017,"Can't begin to count the number of times we have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory at Arrowhead nor the number of Cheesecakes in the chain...From Boston to LA and lots of places in between.   Consistency is the name of the game when it comes to this chain.  Always great food, always great locations, always always always great service. In fact we comment that we have never had a bad meal nor have we ever had bad service.  May not be the most creative place but you never go away unhappy on any account."
