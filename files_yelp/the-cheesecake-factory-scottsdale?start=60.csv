Carol M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,131,38,2.0,10/15/2016,Had dinner on a whim here recently.  I had pit beef dip sandwich with a green salad.  Oh so very disappointing.  The fatty sliced beef was generously loaded on a seeded hamburger bun more suited for a hamburger than a dip sandwich.  The small cup of au jus dipping sauce was served on the side.  The green salad was a bowl of lettuce with a slice of tomato.  Really??  Maybe they should just list it more properly as a bowl of lettuce.  Good service from hostess and waitress but that didn't make up for the below average food at above average prices.  I won't be in a hurry to return.
Mack P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,2,5.0,9/20/2017,Decided to try the cheesecake factory in the Scottsdale location and were pleasantly surprised the service was outstanding the portions were very large and quite delicious our waitress was very attentive and spoke to me by name she was knowledgeable of the Linda you and had very helpful suggestions this cheesecake factory location is in a very good location with other amenities within walking distance we will definitely frequent this restaurant again
Matthew B.,"Marana, AZ",22,12,3,1.0,4/26/2017,Worst Cheesecake Factory that I've ever been to. Normally this is one of my favorite restaurants but this one was certainly not up to par. They sat us in a booth and there were flies everywhere buzzing me and my wife's head the whole time we were there. I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. By the time I left I was disgusted. This isn't a McDonalds and we aren't eating $1 cheeseburgers folks. Not good!
Genevieve A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",78,33,5,5.0,9/13/2016,"I'm a long-time lover of The Cheesecake Factory! Even when I lived in California, I was a big fan of my ""regular"" chipotle chicken pasta and caesar salad. I am pleasantly surprised that the food tastes exactly as good here in AZ! However, this visit to the Cheesecake Factory was different than the dozens of other times we've dined here. Mainly because our server made me and my family feel as if we were the guests of honor! Michael, our server, gave us his undivided attention. It was lunch hour (Around 1 PM on Saturday) and even though you could tell that there was a lot of pressure because of the rush, Michael not only managed, but surpassed our service expectations by being quick, responsive, and paying attention to the little details. (Like making sure we were never without refills). It is servers like Michael that make customers come back, not just the amazing pasta. Lol."
Barbara S.,"Bay City, OR",0,2,2,1.0,4/23/2017,Not impressed. First time I've ever had a martini served in a glass tumbler. Said no martini glasses available?  It was warm so was sent back. At $12 not acceptable.
Matthew D.,"Tempe, AZ",898,663,399,2.0,11/25/2015,"Whew, garlic. Been to a CF only twice before--once in Palo Alto, CA, and once in Hollywood. I thought that the food was okay then, but not so much now.  I'm usually a fan of pasta at most restaurants--even at Denny's it's halfway decent.  The spaghetti sauce here had so much garlic in it that it was literally the only thing that I could taste on the pasta.  If I wanted aioli and noodles, I would have asked for it.  The meatballs were pretty good, but were PACKED with onions.  I now reek of garlic and onions and my wife won't get near me.  Thanks guys. Her salad was fairly good, but nothing to write home about.  Nice bread.  Service was friendly.  It was entertaining sitting outside and watching the birds fly in after patrons would leave their tables--they would take bread and raid the sugar packets. Meh.  Not really impressed."
Linh-Nhi H.,"Phoenix, AZ",734,50,92,5.0,9/21/2016,We came here with no reservation and the hostess walked us to the our table right away.  I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta!! It's so delicious! I also love their bread as appetizer. We also ordered the loaded potato tots as appetizer and it tasted alright.  Overall I rate it a 5 stars because of their customer service!
Tim N.,"Boston, MA",666,56,6,1.0,7/12/2016,Food is on par with all other Cheesecake Factory locations. Take out counter is staffed by incompetents. Three times in one week I had to go back and return my order because it was either missing something or it was made wrong. Once is a mistake. Twice is a wake up call to management. Three times is inexcusable.  And that's me. I live next door.  Imagine the people who drive home 4 miles and find out they've been screwed and never even complain.
John B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",304,34,6,1.0,6/27/2016,"Good food, but the table next to me had a small ""service"" dog that was on the table, in the person's lap, on the ground running around, then back on the table....  the server and manager did nothing.  This was a lap dog, with a service best you can buy on eBay...  not a seeing eye dog....  the people sitting on the opposite side even asked if the doug had any special training they said no.   Then they was another dog running around the bar.  Unsanitary, I won't be back into the management places sanitary conditions over running a indoor dog park."
Colleen L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",120,158,218,4.0,12/27/2015,"Huge, overwhelming menu. I recommend ordering something off their Skinnylicious menu & then splurging on dessert. They have a decent number of gluten-free items on the menu, including one cheesecake option (flourless chocolate). I got the almond salmon salad, modified to be gf. I gotta say, it was pretty dang good with the Dijon & ranch mustard. Friendly service."
Zandra P.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,22,20,5.0,2/17/2016,"Great service, yummy food!!  The atmosphere was very nice. I had the Avocado egg roles and they are from heaven. Amazing. The filet mignon was tender and cooked as I asked. Perfection. Best part was the staff. Brionna was polite and very attentive. Thank you."
Yvonne G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",63,406,197,1.0,7/16/2015,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times before at this particular location.  Brought visiting granddaughter here today.  Bad move. Ordered the chicken samosa appetizer, 4 small greasy wontons filled with chicken.  Doesn't anyone know how to fry anymore?  Why so greasy, pray tell? 380 degrees and they will be virtually greaseless.  These, were NOT.  I didn't complain.  Ordered two red sangrias.  Sangrias came out with lots of ice (less Sangria) and very watery tasting.  I know good Sangria--it's in my genes---but this was NOT it.  Have you noticed that they don't give you the pricing on some of the drinks?  Well, my dear readers, these watery sangrias were $9.50 a piece plus tax and tip.  I will pay $15 for a good drink folks, but I hate being taken for a ride.  But I did not complain.  After all, I was taking a lovely guest out.   Ordered one of my favorites, Fried shrimp in the basket with french fries and cole slaw.  Doesn't seem like such a big deal but when shrimp are freshly fried and delicious nothing beats them.  These, were NOT.  Something very strange with these shrimp.  Firstly, two different colors/tones (see photo).  I tasted the darker, flatter one first. Tasted like frozen shrimp from the supermarket, Carnation brand, or perhaps Sea-Pak?  The lighter, curlier shrimp tasted like it was pre chewed--no really.  It's just an expression but what I meant was that it was mushy inside.  Almost like a shrimp paste --they tasted like the precooked shrimp that come in a ring which were battered and then fried.  Very strange.  Granddaughter's theory was that the darker shrimp were leftover from someone else's plate and re-fried and served to me. Yuk at the thought).  I tried to eat them and ate two and then I said, why are you doing this to yourself?.  When our server, Dylan B, came around I couldn't help but to try to describe what the issue was with these shrimp.  I started with... ""I know you didn't cook this, but.....""   Dylan B listened and apologized.   As we were about to leave a man (manager) came by to ask us how everything was.  I explained the shrimp fiasco.  He gave me an ""explanation"" or how when shrimp are fried and they stick together, one gets darker than the other.  Excuse me Mr. Manager, when was the last time you cooked a dinner?  I am quite a cook so Storytime Theatre didn't work for me.  Then he apologized and left.   Gee, everybody loves to apologize. apologies are cheap.  Is that part of their training?  As long as you apologize,  patrons can eat #######.   I got the bill which amounted to $90.  No accommodation for the horrible meal I had or for the fact that I didn't even have dinner.  No small credit for the lousy shrimp, no slice of cake to make up for it nada, Nyet.   So for $90, I had inedible shrimp, coleslaw overridden with mayonnaise, two watery Sangrias and greasy Samosas.   My husband enjoyed his Chicken Marsala and that's why the ONE star.   Not good, Cheesecake Factory, Not good."
Lilly S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",40,79,154,5.0,12/24/2016,"Food is awesome, food is great! I've been here plenty of times and always forget to check in and leave a review. I always enjoy coming here because there's something for everyone on the menu!"
N C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",12,11,1,3.0,3/9/2017,"Food was good, waitress was great BUT when the workers started playing musical chairs and tables right next to me when I was trying to have dinner with my husband it got VERY ANNOYING. Not one worker apologized while putting their asses close to my food. This place seems busy every day of the week so I wouldn't eat there again."
Moon A.,"Chandler, AZ",1,12,9,5.0,7/19/2016,"I went to this location , I will come back only for the best costumer service I got , my server LORLEN , she amazing , she's very classy the way she serve like 5 stars service , The food was very good , will come back for sure"
Michael P.,"Carefree, AZ",2,19,3,2.0,7/20/2017,"Overpriced dinners for average food with huge calorie meals ranging from 1300 to 2200 calories.  Add another 1200 calories if you want a slice of their specialty.  Decor is dated.  Only real positive was the service of our waitress.  For the same price, better off going to Tommy Bahama or True Foods across the street."
KJ H.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",0,13,7,1.0,1/8/2017,"The last time I ate here was over 10 years ago. I actually remember how bad it was then so we have avoided them since. We were recently given a gift card for $25, so we decided to give them another try. After all, it would be free. Ordered calamari as an appetizer and the Fish and Chips for an entrée. The Calamari came in 2 temperatures; very cool and medium hot. It was obvious that we were offered some that had sat a while and some that was made closer to the time we ordered it. The entrée was hot, oily and almost neutral in taste. I ate one piece and called it quits. Our meal and 2 waters ended up $40.00!!! As a retired international airline pilot, I have eaten all over the world and would put this in the bottom 5% of all restaurants I have ever eaten at. The only positive I can say is that they are consistent; bad 10 years ago and just as bad now."
David L.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",232,166,548,1.0,10/2/2015,"Not the cleanest cheesecake factory I've visited. The forks and spoons were very dirty and placed directly on the table. The waitress was a bit mean sounding, not sure what her name was but she had short hair and sounded like she was from London/England. She gave my girlfriend a ton of attitude while she was making her order. I understand that my girl was being a little indecisive and it may have been annoying but you are suppose to have patience when you are a server. I asked for extra bread and was given the hardest bread ever. The first batch of bread was fresh. I ordered 2 sides of mac and cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were cold and seemed like they werent even fully cooked. The mac and cheese was delicious but I found a hair in it so that kind of ruined it for me. This is the worst and dirtiest cheesecake factory I've ever been to. They need to hire a new manager and new servers. If they don't change things up soon I see this place getting shut down in the near future. Don't eat here unless you want to get sick. This place should change it's name to the Germs Factory. To top all of that off. The server decided to leave her shift before we were even done eating. How much ruder can you be? Servers always wait until their customers finish. Horrible service."
Felicity J.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,12,9,5.0,1/1/2017,I ordered from doordash and it was like 45 min wait not bad for New Year's Eve food was awesome
Bruce T.,"Waukee, IA",0,3,,3.0,7/30/2017,"It was the first day that The Cheesecake Factory was observing National Cheesecake Day and it was packed with people waiting inside and outside.  I was by myself and arrived about 5:30 p.m. I was seated in about 10 minutes. My server promptly brought water and bread while I looked at the menu. I ordered the sausage and ricotta flatbread and decided to look at the cheesecakes in the case at the front. I came back and saw a busser taking my water, bread, jacket, and napkin. I yelled at him that I wasn't through. My server heard me and said that she would take care of it. She did. I spoke to a manager who said they would talk to the staff about when to clear a table. My food was OK, nothing special. The sausage was crisp, more like bacon. I recommend the factory nachos and buffalo blasts over the flatbread pizza if you're aren't not counting calories at this meal. The Hershey chocolate bar cheesecake was good, although their Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake are better. My rating considered how busy they were and didn't subtract because I like other cheesecakes better."
