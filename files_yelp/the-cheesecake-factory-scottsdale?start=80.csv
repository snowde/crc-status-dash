Clysta F.,"Boston, MA",0,13,8,5.0,1/23/2017,I had the turkey burger without the bun with a salad and it was great! Perfect option for my diet!
Kay T.,"Phoenix, AZ",378,505,1835,4.0,6/11/2014,"If I want cheesecake, this is the place to go. The decor is nice and the cheesecakes are super nice. They are open a little later than some restaurants too and the staff is friendly. The appetizers were decent and so is the food. For the service and the atmosphere, of course you are paying more. But did I mention cheesecake? Lots of variety of cheesecakes. There's also other desserts as well on the menu. I would have to say this is not the healthiest place to eat since a lot of food is fried and there's an abundance of sugar food available staring at you."
Lisa O.,"Glendale, AZ",16,208,376,5.0,6/11/2015,"Excellent food, great air conditioner blows cold. Clean. Good wait staff and did I say that the food was great!  We had a variety. One had breakfast,  one had cheeseburger, one had pizza and salad and one had salmon dinner. Of course we topped it off with Reese cheesecake.  Just wish the pumpkin cheesecake were not a seasonal thing."
Dwayne O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",242,625,5495,4.0,8/16/2014,"Not into chain restaurants,  been to the original in Marina Del Rey, CA but enjoy coming to this location all the time. This is a couple miles from our house in the Kierland Commons area which is always nice and well kept.  Certainly our late night go to restaurant since it is open late and such a nice high quality clean safe place. One of the most complete menus, the selection is almost to much to choose from the large novel.  When coming in late I enjoy the ""Create your Omelet"". Always prepared well and the potatoes and toast is a full plate of food. The service is always outstanding and there maybe a lot of people waiting but they get you in quickly.  The decor is quirky if you like being in somewhere in Egypt but it is fun. The only issue is it is too dark where you could barely read the menu.  Will come back again and again not only for late night but for lunch and dinner."

Allison B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",20,30,11,4.0,3/22/2016,"Ordered takeout the other night cobb salad (feta instead of blue cheese) and the vanilla bean cheesecake. Salad was fresh, shredded lettuce, crispy bacon, delicious vinaigrette, and huge!  Cheese cake was amazing! Vanilla bean muse added a creamy not too sweet touch of phenomenal!  Had not eaten at Cheesecake in years because I am not big on chain restaurants, but was impressed and excited to return!"
Christopher B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",11,3,,1.0,1/10/2017,"Worst meal ever. Terrible table, terrible service. I was served a fly in my drink, and no one apologized. It took 15 minutes to get a new one. Used my Christmas gift, a Gift card to pay full price for a meal I was too disgusted to eat. Ruined my Valentines day 2016. WILL NEVER RETURN. shame on you for acting like YOU DID NOT SERVE ME A BUG. GROSS!"
Jamie L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,34,60,5.0,11/8/2016,"Our ""go-to"" lunch spot for a great quick lunch. We love coming in at 11am, right when they open because it's quiet and we receive fast service. We love the green tea with mint. I get the Caesar add shrimp or the Cobb no chicken, extra bacon. Both are always delicious and very filling with generous portions for the lunch size. The menu is vast and has a ton of great options that vary in type of cuisine. The complimentary bread & butter is a great bonus and must have. I prefer the pumpernickel and my husband prefers the sourdough, what a perfect pair! Overall, a great lunch with a variety of options!"
Jen T.,"Renton, WA",165,277,133,2.0,2/3/2015,"2 stars only because the food was good. I'm a huge CF fan, at least of the ones I've been to before this one. We came in Sunday night after the Superbowl and received absolutely terrible service. Three tables were sat after us, and all had drinks, bread, and orders taken before our server took our order. She was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes sitting at the table, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender for help. He said he would find her, but didn't. We ended up flagging down another waitress and as she was taking her order our original waitress came by, and that was the last time. She passed us off to the other girl and never looked back. There was also a girl wearing street clothing delivering bar drinks to tables. If you didn't know any better, it would seem as though a random stranger was grabbing drinks off the bar and taking them away. That is completely unprofessional. I even overheard her deliver one to the wrong table. Also, watched the manager thank her for helping, so I guess he had no problem with working an employee off the clock (without a proper uniform).  We had wanted to get some cheesecake to go, but we so displeased and ready to go by the end of the meal we decided against it. Bummer, because I was really craving a piece of chocolate mousse after a bad day. I love the food at CF, the tomato basil flatbread is my go to - it is the perfect size and is fantastic. The kale salad is also fabulous. I've never had an experience like this at a CF either, usually is a very good time, with great service."
Jonathan S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,1,5.0,12/24/2016,Evelyn was by far the best waitress I've had in a very long time I had the ribeye steak rare the steak was cooked to perfection it was absolutely delicious I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory on Scottsdale
Breanna D.,"Duluth, MN",37,3,,5.0,6/20/2017,"Everything was excellent about our dining experience.  Ron, our server, was wonderful. Very attentive and prompt. Our food was served quickly and the steak cooked perfectly."
Austin T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",32,74,9,1.0,1/2/2016,"Place was loud and chaotic.  Oh and not to mention absolutely disgusting. We waited 40 minutes after being told 20.   Table was filthy.  Silverware covered in old, crusted food.  When the server finally greeted us 10 minutes after being seated, we asked  her (I thought very politely) to have all the oatmeal and sauce on the table wiped off.  She told the busser ""these people think the table is dirty"" (it was very obviously dirty).  The table was then wiped off, per our request.  But with an off-color rag that left the table wet and smelling like a septic tank.  More dirty silverware speckled with old food and fingerprints were neatly placed atop the dishwater-covered tabletop.  My date and I blinked at each other, then got up and left."
Cameron N.,"Beaver, UT",0,5,,5.0,12/14/2016,You can never go wrong. Shrimp scampi is great. Steak Diane very good. Louisiana chicken tasted exceptional. All my children and spouse loved their meals. Great service and atmosphere.
Jared L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,10,15,5.0,11/4/2016,The lunch Caesar Salad is bomb. It's a large portion and comes in a chilled bowl filled full of fresh crisp romaine lettuce. They're really good about having lettuce that is not brown or wilted. Perfectly crunchy croutons with tangy garlic dressing. I like to add shrimp but you can add chicken. Also comes with a dusting of grated parmigiana and you can get fresh cracked pepper at the table from the server. Extra fresh cracked pepper is best. Just slide your bowl to the edge of the table otherwise you'll have pepper all over the table and in your lap. Give it a try it's bomb.
Diplekha C.,"Austin, TX",46,125,612,2.0,5/20/2015,"I heard a lot about cheesecake factory before going   was my first time as I am not into sweet indulgence that much.we ordered nachos, garlic noodles, cheesecake factory special lemonade and tiramisu cheesecake. A lot I know.nachos was good.garlic noodles was awful. I don't know why they even call it garlic noodles. No hints of garlic. Lemonade was bad too.too much sweet.may b that's why they call it special.ughhhh.cheesecake was no doubt a good one...anyway I will go there only to have cheesecake, nothing else."
Diana G.,"Chandler, AZ",4,27,4,5.0,9/25/2016,We go here on the regular basis. Only restaurant that I'm not afraid to try different dishes because I never get disappointed. Their ranch is amazing never had anything better. We always leave happy can't go wrong with this company!
Jeff F.,"Tempe, AZ",48,10,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Although our waitress Kristen was awesome, we had a very poor experience dining here this evening in celebration of my wife's birthday and Mothers day.  After ordering, we waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for our food.  Then they forgot to even prepare my wife's dish so she had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for it to be prepared.  Upon confronting the Manager about this she proceeded to get argumentative, make excuses about how busy they were (as if they didn't know they would be) and actually blamed our waitress for the delay in  my wife's dish.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, event though they comped our meal to try and make it up to us."
Courtney B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",175,20,7,1.0,1/4/2016,"As a frequent customer at Cheesecake factory, I am rarely disappointed in my service. However, today I was extremely disappointed in both the service and my meal. For starters I always order fresh strawberries as an appetizer. The waitress looked at me like I didn't know what I was talking about and gave me a look of confusion. Next when the strawberries were served, they were very old looking.  Just looking at them you could see they were mushy and past their prime. I took two bites and pushed the plate to the end of the table. These strawberries should have never been served!!!  I blame the chef for this one and the server saw no problem with them and challenged me when I brought this to her attention.  My salad came next and lacked some very important ingredients such as apples. I blame the chef for this one too.  When the waitress came back to the table and asked how everything was, I informed her that I was not happy with the strawberries, at which time the waitress got very defensive and told me that I didn't order them the correct way and she didn't seem at all concerned.  I also had a take out order I had placed at the beginning of my meal so she could have it ready for when I was done with my meal. When she brought the bill I asked for my to-go-meal and she said she completely forgot! I then, had to sit there for an extra 15 minutes and wait for her to bring me this meal.  I am not one to write bad reviews but I couldn't believe this service and quality of food (strawberries). Not only did she challenge me as a customer but she challenged other customers as well when they weren't happy."
Kristina C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,,5.0,5/21/2017,Thank you to our waiter Habib for making our night great and putting up with our wild family! We were lucky to have him!
Madison S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",57,17,1,1.0,3/18/2017,"The food was fine, nothing spectacular. The service on the other hand was terrible! On top of our waitress being really slow, someone in our party had a food allergy to dairy. While the food was prepared as they requested, the bun had what appeared to be a coat of butter on top. What the person asked the waitress to clarify, she was very rude and defensive and seemed reluctant to find out what the substance on the bun was. The manager came over and explained that it was margarine, but could not verify if their margarine contained dairy or not and also seemed reluctant to find out. He also made a comment about how they would have to remake the whole burger if it was, acting as if it was an inconvenience to him. Ultimately, they told the person they would bring them a PLAIN bun without the margarine on to be safe, but brought out a bun that still had something on it.  The person had to eat their burger with just the bottom bun because they didn't want to go through the  trouble of finding out what mystery substance was on that bun."
