Nick H.,"Puyallup, WA",29,8,8,4.0,12/28/2017,"Was skeptical to go back because when I think about an event dinner out before a 7:30 theatrical show, I think about all the wonderful places in downtown Seattle to eat and one of the last places I would attend is a chain restaurant! ... and yet our guests wanted nothing more than to go CF and I didn't want to pout ... so I obliged ! I was pleasantly surprised and admit I studied the novel (I mean 'menu') and all the reviews so I wouldn't waste my time with some subpar dish. I was set to order the egg roll sampler and one of the Asian dishes to compliment.  Wait was less than what the hostess said (30 mins), I wasn't super hangry and I was inspired by the word creamy and sausage and so I ordered a creamy pasta with sausage, pepperoni, bacon marinara sauce from the small portions menu which was soooo tasty and loved the creamy, tomatoey, rich spicy flavor and could not eat the whole thing after eating off my wife's plate which was the chicken lettuce wraps (plus I was saving room for cheesecake). My wife's review of the lettuce wraps were that the 3 sauces were wonderful but the chicken was ""ok"". (She said my chicken lettuce wraps are better). The plate was arranged beautifully and the bib lettuce was perfect for wrapping and although the chicken looked to be well-grilled, I know how chunks of chicken breast can be dry if not done well or allowed to sit out. I loved the sweet pickled cukes and roman noodles as a topping.  My dish came late and I was told it went to another table and then the manger came later and told me ""it didn't have the presentation that they would like""  and he offered me salad or soup - no thanks - I will eat more bread!  The Waitress was attentive, refilled drinks without prompting, asked if we had a time schedule for an evening show and was very sweet. We were cutting it close for time when my meal arrived so my wife and I ordered one lemon rasp cheesecake that was absolutely perfect  after a heavy spicy dish! Our guests ordered theirs to go because we were just going to make our show and then our bills came and they were messed up ""I guess I shouldn't have trusted the computer!"" was the response . So we waited about 5-10 more minutes and got our new bills!  I would come back if all the Stars and Planets were aligned and we had die-hard Cheesecakers in our group again! I was overall very pleased!"
Elsa L.,"Akiachak, AK",1,7,,5.0,11/19/2017,"I've never liked The Cheesecake Factory.  I don't live in the area, but I've been to this location a couple of times. Omg!  The food and service was excellent.  We arrived right before shift change, but our server, Anthony, and his replacement, Gregory, took great care of us, even coming around to let us know about the shift change and recalling our orders for his replacement. I got the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp and it was sweet, savory, and much different than expected. A+++ would visit again."
Teressa L.,"Newcastle, WA",87,543,467,3.0,11/1/2017,"Were in the area and decided to grab a snack before walking around downtown more.  We did get a table right away but service was slow.  I didn't figure out why but some tables had huge water glasses.  We had smaller plastic jugs with a handle for water.  Which we emptied quickly and had to wait for refills multiple times.  We quickly ordered a chicken taquito appetizer which was delicious but tiny.  Like it arrived and we all laughed at how small it was.  The photo up front must have been the biggest zoom lens ever. However, the flavors were amazing and we all liked it.  We ordered nachos with the spicy chicken as well.  Apparently they burnt the first one but by the time a manager came over to say this we had been waiting a long time.  Eaten 2 baskets of bread(waited awhile on the 2nd one) and were wondering if the order had ever been placed.  It finally arrived...edges were still questionably brown.  However, it was good.  Chicken was tender and flavorful, the guac/salsa/sourcream plentiful and the chips were crispy, but slightly greasy.  We then shared 2 cheesecakes, lemon raspberry and chocolate tuxedo.  The cheesecake here is always excellent but I notice the specialty cheesecakes have so little cheesecake in them now and lots of other things instead.  It's a nice mix, but I really wanted cheesecake and should have just ordered a basic one I guess to get a lot of that cheesecake filling.  No discount or free item for the food delay which is disappointing.  We were nice about it.  Seems like people who act out get free stuff.   Anyway, server was nice but hard to find.  Water was rarely refilled.  While food was good, service and delay of food was disappointing."
Victoria S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",195,6,,1.0,1/3/2018,"The workers are fucking asssssholes. We purchased $125 in gift cars; Which would equal 5 free slices of cheesecake. We have dinner, order cheesecake, and then  nothing. Our waiter says she can't give it to us because we don't have each individual  code. It was my birthday & I have already had the shittiest Birthday. The manager was being condescending the entire time. They threw out the cheesecakes we ordered instead of working things out. If you care about customer service, then don't go here."
J H.,"Seattle, WA",46,278,613,4.0,10/25/2017,"Think living in Seattle, it definitely makes me appreciate franchises like Cheesecake Factory. So many college memories and occasions spent here. I think over the how many times I've eaten at CF, I've probably tried everything on their menu. My favorites would be: Avocado egg rolls, sweet corn tamales, Luau chicken salad, MEATLOAF, jambalaya (w/rice) & gumbo, and their red velvet cheesecake. Sweet cheap HH and of course the endless brown bread!"
Donna C.,"Lafayette, CO",29,239,25,3.0,10/22/2017,"While not my first choice for lunch, I was meeting a friend with her 6 year old so Cheesecake Factory is perfect - lots of food choices.  The Mexican Salad on the ""skinny menu"" was underwhelming. Too much sauce/dressing (I'm not sure what it was exactly). Strangely the chicken was on the bottom so I didn't notice it was there until half through my meal. My friend got the veggie salad which was fine and there was an order of kids pasta that was eagerly eaten.  We went during the height of lunch rush and waited only 15 minutes. The restaurant was on the loud side. Interestingly, our server was ""on break"" and we had a substitute start us out. I thought that was very odd. What kind of restaurant has their servers take breaks during the peak of meals?  Anyway, it was fine overall. Again, not my first choice for lunch when in Seattle but given the circumstances they did fine."
Robin W.,"Spicewood, TX",71,344,184,4.0,10/1/2017,"Great service! I had the skinnylicious shrimp tacos which were flavored well. My dad had nachos which was to big for him to finish. My hubby had a burger. We had the avocado egg rolls to start and the banana cheesecake to finish.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, however next time I will split something with someone. The entrees are huge so more than enough to share."
Monika C.,"Burnaby, Canada",62,107,240,3.0,6/13/2017,"My husband and I timed our visit so that we would skip the lunch rush. It was still quite busy with a lot of families celebrating graduations present, but we were seated almost immediately. Our server was very friendly and attentive and we enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant.  Having already had lunch, we chose to get dessert instead. I was torn between the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake that I got on my first visit and the Key Lime cheesecake. I opted for the second because I felt like something lighter and more refreshing. My husband got the Adam's cheesecake. Both cakes were served with a generous amount of heavy whipped cream which was delicious and it helped cut the sweetness.  The key lime was tangy and light (relatively speaking of course), almost to a point where it was hard to tell if it really was cheesecake. The crust was a nice crumbly texture and wasn't overly sweet. I still found the whole thing too sweet and I struggled to finish the latter half. The portion was a lot larger than what I was used to as well. My husband's selection was a sugar explosion and I couldn't take more than a bite of it. However, it better retained the richness of cheesecake.  All in all, I would say that the restaurant is worth visiting as a once in a lifetime thing if you're from out of town. The calorie counts alone make it a memorable experience! However, I've had cheesecakes that have better suited my tastes and I would much rather pay for something that I can finish. The novelty has worn off for me and I'd be hard pressed to say that I would visit again."
Emma A.,"Carlsbad, CA",7,24,9,4.0,11/8/2017,"I loved my Vegan Cobb Salad that I got here tonight! Wanted something lighter than your normal Cheesecake Factory dinner, and this was perfect. A great variety of textures and flavors, and the portion size was EXACTLY what a salad should be! The vegetables were fresh and tasty. Will definitely be getting again!"
Edward S.,"Seattle, WA",53,402,540,4.0,8/13/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory several times.  This visit was to the Downtown location near the Convention Center. The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to bring picky eaters (since they have the largest menu you have ever seen) and good dessert.   I was eating at the bar this time.  Service is always quick and friendly.  I had a glass of wine and then ordered the sliders and chopped salad. They not only have a great selection, but the portions are generous.  The slider plate including four of them of pretty good size.  They would have made a good meal on their own.  The slider was good, but the bread was not great. I have had the chopped salad a couple of times--it is really good.  It is truly a chopped salad with romaine salad, corn, bacon, chicken, avocado and more--all with a nice vinaigrette.  It is also a generous portion and every bite is tasty. To avoid too many calories, I try to eat enough to avoid dessert.  However, if you have one my favorite is not a cheesecake, but the Apple Crisp. Everything you need to know about how good this place is can be seen by the lines to get in--and also a good place for groups."
Chris s.,"Orlando, FL",0,18,5,1.0,1/2/2018,"We spent $75 tonight for a delivery that's only 3 minutes walk from the location: $60 Food + $15 fees and tips to D.  Food was delivered without a Single Knife, we ordered the Chicken Bellagio (how could it be done if without knife?) I had to dress up to go downstairs (Deli) to get the utensil: The main reason why we ordered delivery was that someone is sick so we didn't have to walk out of the room. Called the restaurant back, manager didn't sound Apologetic at all, instead he said "" Oh well, why didn't you ask for a room service to bring up the utensil?!"" I have never been so mad with anyone but does it make sense for us to tip the room service on top of $75 we already spent? This could easily be the last time I try Cheesecake Factory! (And again it's the restaurant that forgot to put in the knife, not the driver, Cheesecake Factory is not trying to resolve this)"
Tammy O.,"Arlington, WA",0,6,4,5.0,9/29/2017,"I Went here for the first time and it was delicious. I had shrimp tacos, iced tea and shared a piece of banana cream cheese cake.  The staff was friendly and the service was awesome.  I would definitely recommend going here."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,5.0,6/28/2017,"As we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, this was just around the corner.  We came here once for dinner and once to pick up desserts.   As usual we ordered several of the small plates.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  Service was great!     If you're in the area and want some familiar comfort food, it's a good spot."
Nathan J.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,244,83,2.0,10/18/2017,"Very disappointing. Never have I been to the Cheesecake Factory where the staff lacked enthusiasm and morale seemed low. It's like they were Sears employees about to receive their layoff package. I have been to a dozen different locations and not once was I disappointed. This time, things were different. We were there on a slow Monday night before 6 pm. The place wasn't busy at all.  Not only did the employees appear they didn't want to be there, the food was not up to the usual TCF standards. The main entrées were served lukewarm. Steak and potatoes seemed like were somebody else's order from several hours ago.  My companion's meal was about the same too. I doubt the food met State or County food safe standards. Our server never bothered to check back either after the entrées were served. In fact the food server was nowhere to be found until we were finished our meals. The only good thing was the dark honey bread. The white was quite hard. It appeared stale from the day before or lunch time.  I feel there seems to be issues with management. Look at the other negative reviews. There's a theme building if you dismiss the rosey or sugar coated positive comments.   The business manaer's response (below) is far from adequate. Their focus seems to be on the lack of attentiveness by the food server when it's obviously more than that. The food temperature and freshness are big issues that need addressing...but it seems that's not going to happen. This location seems to survive only because of location. In my opinion, it leaves a bad impression of the chain to others, especially foreigners.  Oddly there's no wifi at such an expensive establishment.  I just realized that at the time of writing.  We won't be returning to this location. We're beginning to have doubts on this chain whether or not they're having financial difficulties."
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1416,1110,17405,4.0,5/29/2017,Typical Cheesecake Factory. Busy location. Fried mac and cheese is the way to go. Snickers Cheesecake and Linda's Chocolate Cake are a great way to end your meal here. Service is good.
Janelle J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",922,393,925,4.0,6/3/2017,"I really enjoyed this Cheesecake factory location. I came here twice in a 20 hour span! Came for dinner and ordered the Asian chicken salad (which was great!) and the next morning for brunch I ordered the club sandwich. My favorite of the two items was the club sandwich. This is normally served on a buttery croissant, but I opted for sourdough bread instead and it is so much better. Of course for appetizer, we ordered the famous avocado egg rolls which are now a whopping $11.95. The dipping sauce that comes with the avocado egg rolls is great! I love how they serve you complimentary sweet molasses baguette and also sourdough baguette. The service here was good! Our server was very attentive. The hostesses were great at giving accurate wait times. At first when they said 10 minutes, I thought no way there is so many people waiting, but it ended up being less than a 10 minute wait. This location is a large restaurant and they have a lot of tables and booths. You can also have a drink or appetizer in the open seating bar while you wait for your table. Last but not least the Cheesecake! We opted for the lemon raspberry and requested to have it drizzled with raspberry sauce. That was a great idea because it came out looking beautiful and also tasted amazing with a refreshing flavor. When everywhere is packed for brunch on Saturday and Sunday, come to Cheesecake Factory!"
Jessica S.,"Seattle, WA",189,223,183,4.0,10/3/2017,"This place is pretty consistent with any other Cheesecake Factory location you go to. I came here for lunch while I was at an event at the convetion center and there was no wait in the bar. Our server was really nice and greeted us right when we sat down with waters. I ordered a turkey pesto sandwich and it was a little soggy sauce, but excluding that it was pretty good. The cheesecake for dessert was really good, so this is a great place if you're in the area."
Trisha F.,"Seattle, WA",263,397,801,2.0,3/22/2017,"I know, I know, it is a chain restaurant, but I got a gift card and the kiddo LOVES cheesecake, so we came with a group of friends. We ordered a wide variety of dishes, but most alarming are the flatbread and pizza. They are served on wooden pizza paddles, and if you know anything about wood in the kitchen it is that it can't be soaked. This wood is most definitely soaked somewhere. The pizzas/flatbread all tasted like detergent. Kid wouldn't even eat it. Gross, probably against some health code violation, and really upsetting.  Two stars cause the cheesecake is on point."
Katherine T.,"San Antonio, TX",91,508,37,4.0,11/29/2017,"Well I love Cheesecake Factory. I don't know if it's safe to say that as a self appointed foodie but the portions, prices, sweet brown bread and gaudy decor are fine by me. Regardless of all that the $10 a slice cheesecakes are highly crave-able. We were lucky enough to come on a slow night and were promptly served at the to go cheesecake counter. I normally call in orders ahead but there was no need to today and the waiter was humorous and jolly. Plus the ability to now eat cheesecake for breakfast is pretty non beatable."
Casimier S.,"Shoreline, WA",44,18,22,4.0,10/13/2017,"This is always a great place when you're wanting a flavorful pasta dish. I don't go there for anything else. Oh and the bread that comes before every meal is a nice addition making you feel as if you're at a fancy expensive restaurant. I always enjoy the ambiance of this place. All in all this restaurant is quite consistent, I've gone a couple of times now I'm treated equally as good and the food doesn't differ much between visits. I love the chicken bellagio and the Louisiana pasta."
Yazmin S.,"Culver City, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/27/2017,"Frequent visitor! For a chain restaurant, it is always on par with the Cheesecake Factory brand. Food is always a hit and service is fast. Best bang for your buck!"
Kelly N.,"Vancouver, Canada",30,40,151,5.0,9/22/2017,We absolutely love coming to the USA  and getting our Cheesecake Factory fix!!! The portions are huge and you get bang for you buck!  Service is always good ;)
Shanda O.,"Woodland, CA",34,69,35,1.0,8/8/2017,"The hostess here is awful! We wanted to eat here, but she couldn't handle a party of 10. She gave us a waiting beeper and said she would find from the manager how long the wait would be since we have ""such a large party"".  20 min with no response i asked if she knew how long. I showed her my beeper and She said 10 more min that they were getting our table ready. I went to the bar and got my kids some water, when i came back to my group she was telling us i had given her the wrong name (even though i had not told her a name, i had showed her my beeper) and that her manager said it would be at least an hour and a half before they could seat us. Not even apologetic about giving me the wrong info moments before.  We went across the street (to the Daily Grill) and were seated within 15 min. They were not over whelmed by our group of 10. In a city this big cheese cake factory should male sure their location and staff are ready for larger groups."
Long P.,"Kent, WA",1,13,2,1.0,9/25/2017,If I could give this place no Stars I would... worst place and customer service. We went in during lunch to get a friend a cake... we called in advance to make sure they had it but when we showed up they said they they no longer have it... the thing that made us mad was no apologies and just acted Like we were in the wrong... no other recommendations nothing...
Jerry C.,"Rainier, OR",0,57,138,4.0,8/16/2017,It's the cheese cake factory all the food is good.  We have had cheese cake factory before and I honestly don't think I've ever had bad food.  We never have room for desert so we specifically went for desert which was a great idea.  I highly recommend it!
Keshi N.,"Seattle, WA",3,40,22,3.0,8/30/2017,"Went here for work lunch, good times. Food was decent, but deserts were awesome. Server was very attentive and obviously good at what she does."
Tony C.,"Seattle, WA",270,27,13,3.0,10/28/2017,"We stopped by after seeing a play at the Paramount nearby. Got seated in the bar area right away, but maybe because it was 11pm on a Tuesday. The strawberry cheesecake was without surprises - delicious and reliable, but we really picked it because everything else was in the 4 digit calorie range :o Didn't eat anything else due to the time of day, but they do have a more calorie light menu now that has some more reasonable entree options!"
Melissa D.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,2,,1.0,12/19/2017,"The worst experience of my life!!!! Had to ask the host team if we were going to be seated TWICE after they had already seated literally every table that came after us. Once we finally were seated not ONE server approached us. Both tables beside were asked twice if they were doing ok and in that time STILL no server. I had to ask an expo for assistance and still no server came. The hostess Jordan was extremely rude, she rolled her eyes as she was setting our menus down. She even had the audacity to mock my mother behind her back thinking the rest of my family wouldn't see. The manager Wes didn't do anything, actually kind of felt as if he really did not care about my family being there. Literally the biggest waste of my time. Seriously guys do yourself a favour and go somewhere better‍"
Kristina D.,"South Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"My experience at the Seattle location and the e-mail I was told to write because there was no upper management ""available"":  My family and I visited your Seattle location on Sunday, December 17. We arrived for lunch with a party of 5 and I am extremely upset with how we were treated. When we arrived it wasn't busy and it was quite slow compared to what I've seen when I have visited in the past. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. We had to complain 2 times before getting seated because there were 5 other parties  that arrived after us and got seated within minutes, this also included a party for 4 and 5. After finally being seated I asked the hostess (I was told her name is Jordan) if I could speak to a manager. She rudely replied with an okay and didn't show us to our table properly. We spoke to the MOD (he told us his name Is Wes) he apologized and said he would make sure we were taken care of, we were also told that they had ""forgotten"" to put our name down. Which extremely confusing because we asked 2 times when we would be seated?? After waiting another 10 minutes at our table we  had no server help us. We had to ask a busboy if we could get a server. At this point we decided to leave and the hostess (Jordan) rudely made first gesture to my mother. How is this acceptable??  I frequently travel to Seattle just to visit your restaurant and now I will never return. I am appalled that this how you train your staff to behave. As someone who works in the food industry, I can't see how this is acceptable. The manager (Wes) acted as if we were in the wrong and that we deserved this type of treatment. Thanks to your Seattle location and the hostess (Jordan) I don't have any future plans to visit any of your locations."
Batul A.,"Arlington, TX",344,40,35,3.0,12/31/2016,Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory but this location is amazing. We got a seat right in front of the huge windows towards the front and it was absolutely stunning at night (we like to people watch so this was awesome).  Ordered the guacamole and chips - always great.  Everyone else order the soup - claim chowder - can't go wrong with that.  All and all we liked our vis
Kelsy L.,"Rainier Valley, Seattle, WA",76,36,60,5.0,10/26/2017,"This place never disappoints me, from their customer service to their food! We always come here for their egg rolls sampler, witch is the best with multiple of different diversity of sauce from americanize to Asian. Hands-down for the spicy chipotle chicken pasta!!! Never disappointing me. And the best deal ever was the combo steak and salmon dish that they have. And friendly, romantic place for couple, or also for birthday celebration with families and friend"
Linda Z.,"Seattle, WA",22,106,36,1.0,7/18/2017,"I haven't been here for a while since my last take out experience was terrible. I get the same dish that I get every time and it was way off. The chicken was cold and it looked like they picked off some chicken from someone else's and tried to make it work. I got two small pieces when its usually three or four big pieces. The pasta was cold and not cooked. Overall, not worth what I paid."
Conner S.,"Columbus, IN",49,9,1,1.0,5/21/2017,"I was really disappointed on our last visit here. We waited for 30 minutes for a table, and nearly an hour for our food. The pasta quality seemed to decline (or my memory did) from last visits here and the overall service was poor. We felt like a burden to our waiter, who seemed overworked and rushed. The manager asked how everything was, but we were too polite to be truthful.  This used to be one of our favorite date places but for $100 for salad, dinner and dessert, I expect much better. I will not return again given this poor experience. Such a shame because their cheesecake is always good, but there are many other options downtown for this price range with better service and food quality."
Vishal D.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,2.0,5/21/2017,"I have had cheesecake in boston and it is soo much cheeseir. But the ones here are very different. Chains should maintain their taste. The cakes were not bad though, but it lacked the cheesy part. Whats special about eating cheese cake from the  cheesecake factory if the cake lacks the cheesy taste."
Lauren C.,"Lewisville, TX",0,22,,4.0,11/1/2017,"The food was underwhelming but our server was very sweet. The food did take forever to get to us though, over thirty minutes. But nothing beats their cheesecake, aka, to die for."
Caroline C.,"San Diego, CA",2,24,3,1.0,10/13/2017,Hmmmm.  I really thought you could go to any Cheesecake Factory and expect the same product.  I learned today this is not true.  Worst service I've had and least attention to detail.  Can only imagine it only survives based on location.  Don't bother
Jess A.,"Blocksburg, CA",32,6,1,1.0,10/26/2017,Pretty sure our bar tender hated his job.  His nonstop complaining which consisted of many f-bombs was extremely off putting. The servers actually looked like they were afraid of him.  Sorry your vanilla ice cream was empty but pretty sure it wasn't the surrounding customers fault.  Maybe would have been more bearable if our alcoholic beverages actually had alcohol in them.  I advise not going at 1 pm on a Thursday if that's usual shift.
Rachel M.,"Seattle, WA",236,106,212,3.0,11/26/2016,"Went here on a Friday night, with a party of 8. We only had to wait 45 minutes which I guess is good for the location. We were going because of the large menu for the family with vegans, vegetarians, children and meat eaters. Everyone seemed satisfied with their available choices. And our staff was very kind, and didnt rush us even though it was busy there.  I had the falafel salad. It was fine, the falafel was a bit salty and I didnt finish it. But it was a large salad and I was full at the end of dinner. Possibly because of the bread we had before too. My husband had a pizza and he said it was fine. It was also very large and he had a hard time finishing this too.  I guess this is all to be expected from the cheesecake factory. I usually would order just a pasta dish but I was put off by the prices. Nearly $20 for any pasta dish seems pretty outrageous since we're not even at a nice Italian place.  This restaurant did do the job of satisfying our large party, and everyone was able to eat what they wanted. The place was clean and the staff was nice."
Naomi N.,"Bellingham, WA",37,7,1,3.0,7/2/2017,"This was my first time to this chain. My husband took me for my birthday. The service was good and friendly. We went on Saturday night, so it was busy. We were expecting that. I asked for the Baja Tacos without cilantro because I can't eat it and my order came back full of cilantro on and in everything. Apparently they can't exclude cilantro from the items that have it and the waiter didn't know that when he took my order. They kindly let me order something different although I was somewhat disappointing because I was hoping for something Mexican and all of the Mexican food on the menu is full of cilantro.  The new dish I ordered (the Madeira Chicken) was good and they brought it out quickly, which I appreciated. The waiter also brought us complimentary tea for the extra wait, which was a nice touch. In terms of the food, I found it ok. It's not a critique of this location in particular, but I suppose for the chain in general. We did feel that it was expensive for the quality. We enjoyed the dinner, but not overly so. Hubby ordered a piece of Linda's chocolate cake and I ordered the peanut butter cheesecake to take home. Neither one could finish our cakes because they were way too sweet and we both felt sick this morning. I don't know. I don't think my digestive system can handle it again. I guess turning 36 this year makes me too old. Ha!"
Rick W.,"Blue Bell, PA",0,4,2,1.0,5/12/2017,"I ordered the avocado egg rolls which were very good and promptly served. I also asked for the Kobe burger, medium rare, and after a long delay, it came out, quite well done. It was a Friday night and there was a wait to get the table so it was busy. The side salad was a bunch of greens with a piece of tomato.  The tomato that was served with the burger was mostly green/white - I opted not to put it on my burger. I also ordered a seltzer and was shocked to see that I was charged $3.75 for it! Service at the bar was great. Unfortunately while sitting at the bar, I watched a server stick a straw in a drink just made at the bar and taste the drink from the straw. He then proceeded to serve the drink to the customer. That's nasty. The only positive, besides the avocado egg roll, was the bartender took the charge for the kobe burger off my bill."
