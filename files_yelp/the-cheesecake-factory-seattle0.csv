Kellen C.,"Seattle, WA",421,285,265,4.0,7/7/2015,"Came here for digestif everyone had cheesecake, so obvious, and I had the Caramel Royal Macchiato which is a big hot drink. Food was good, Service was excellent sat outside no issues there. Usually this place is busy but on a Monday night we walked right in. #SEATTLE"
Sara T.,"Muskegon, MI",25,144,1072,5.0,6/26/2014,"Not much to say other than I LOVE their cheesecake. The location is kind of a pain in the butt, but I'm not from the area either so maybe it's just me."
Alex T.,"Seattle, WA",1849,632,222,4.0,2/15/2015,The Sunday wait during brunch is ridiculous! They don't take reservations. Good thing the food is plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Santa fe salad with extra dressing making my meal 2000 delicious calories. Goodbye sexy pants.  I'm a huge fan if their rye bread.  Service is OK. I always hope I'll get jb but he hasn't been around lately. It's the new Sunday zoo...Seriously.
Mimi G.,"Woodinville, WA",22,14,,2.0,12/6/2016,dinner was delicious. service was incredibly slow. my server was justin. :( very disappointed- he practically ignored us the entire time.
Jenn S.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,24,4,2.0,10/25/2016,"First...I love Cheesecake Factory.  I know exactly what to expect and order the same thing almost every time.  We were visiting from out of town and decided to grab a late dinner around 8:30 pm on Sunday October 23rd.  I ordered the crab and artichoke dip which I have eaten a dozen times.  It came out luckwarm and runny  Not the normal dip consistency.  I thought it was odd but let it pass.  Then came our entrees.....Fettuccine Alfredo and the Herb crusted Salmon.  Again, both sauces where very thin.  Disappointing.  Service was also very slow and inconsistent.  We arrived during our servers break.  No biggie but when I asked to order the appetizer from who I thought was our server I was told she was just covering for minute. (She did put in the order though).  When our sever officially took over our table service did not improve.  At one point I tried to flag him down to order dessert and his response was give me minute and then I will be more available.  We ordered Cheesecake to go and after some wait he returned and said ""Sorry.  They were backed up so I had to actually get them myself"".  Maybe it was an off night but the whole experience left us disappointed!"

Matt M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/21/2016,"Would give 0 stars. First and last time here. Horrible service, restaurant forgot several items in my take out order and after walking back a mile for them the employees were no where near sympathetic or apologetic for their mistake. Pretty upsetting after hearing good things."
The J.,"Ferndale, WA",0,3,4,5.0,4/11/2015,"Great Service. Fantastic food. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta because of other reviews here on yelp abs it did not disappoint! Very good portion and great flavor. My wife who isn't s fan of spicy things jokingly called it one of the best dishes I've ordered! She was jealous. Not to spicy, very rich flavor. Topped it off with raspberry lemon cheese cake, great choice."
Peter S.,"Silverdale, WA",0,4,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Extensive menu, but the kitchen's attention to detail is questionable. When taking the restaurant's high volume into consideration, a few blemishes here and there are excusable and depending on their standards, somewhat passable. The servers are well trained and knowledgeable, but recent visits have left a lingering, rather briny taste in my mouth. I'm a young adult and certainly look younger than I am, but I've been in the industry for a long time and tend to tip quite generously. On more than one visit, I have felt that my server, to their demise, has misjudged me as a small spender and cheap tipper and neglected my party as a result. I have sat at tables with empty drinks for 20+ minutes and by the time my server checks up on me, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. My last visit more than assured that I won't be back anytime soon. My girlfriend and I came in on a Monday evening around 8pm, so we were seated right away. Our server greeted us right away, but didn't return to take our drink order for 10minutes. We ordered some drinks, a small plate to share, and our entrees when she returned. Our drinks and appetizer arrived fairly quickly; however, our small plate arrived without the sauce that I had requested and was left on our table rather abruptly by a food runner that failed to ask if we needed anything else. With the exception of the initial delivery of our drinks, we didn't see our server again until our entrees arrived. We had hardly touched our appetizer because we were waiting to ask for the sauce. For the main course, my girlfriend ordered a chicken dish without onions and received an entirely different menu item. Upon realizing she had sent the wrong dish through, our server quickly scurried away with the plate without saying another word. I didn't touch my plate, which had greasy finger prints around the rim, because I assumed they had just brought the wrong dish and that her food would be brought right out or at least cooked on the fly. A few minutes later, the manager came to our table and sincerely apologized for the inconvenience. He was the highlight of our dining experience. He seemed sincerely apologetic and assured us her food would be right out. I took advantage of his presence and asked for the sauce that never arrived for our appetizer as well as another cocktail. My empty glass had been sitting on the edge of the table for 15-20minutes at this point. He came straight back with another drink and came back shortly after with my girlfriend's dinner. We thanked him for taking care of us and he made sure we were totally set before leaving the table. My girlfriend bit into her entree and found green onions in her first bite, even after specifically ordering and re-ordering the dish with no onions. She has an onion allergy that causes swelling and numbness in her throat and mouth, but has the potential to cause respiratory problems, so it's extremely important that she doesn't consume them. The server came around again after the entree came out and I immediately showed her the green onions on the dish. She responded, ""oh my god,"" proceeded to roll her eyes and scurry back to the kitchen again. The manager came back and again, was sincerely apologetic. He told us that her entree was on the house and even bought her a piece of cheesecake for dessert. By this point, my untouched food sat cold on our table for 30minutes and I had lost my appetite. I ordered another cocktail while he was at the table because our server never stuck around long enough for me to ask. By the time my girlfriend's third entree had arrived, we were both ready to leave. Our server finally came to our table to apologize and see if we needed anything, but we were ready for boxes. We won't be back."
Bryan D.,"Vancouver, WA",0,15,,2.0,11/19/2016,"We had dinner on a Friday night as we were staying across the street (convenient).  Reasonable wait for table.  Service and food was fine.  The noise ruined the experience and meal.  We were seated closer to the kitchen.  I was wondering if the cooks and bus-service was a combination between the Seahawks and Green Bay Packers because there was a lot of noise, dishes smashing breaking, clanging for 45 minutes to an hour.  I ordered a second martini to cut the headache but sadly, it didn't work. While I wasn't expecting dinner at Dowton Abby, the staff could use some lessons in placing a stack of dishes versus dropping.  No, I probably won't go back as there are a million other options."
Jakie S.,"Issaquah, WA",31,318,209,5.0,4/25/2015,"There were 18 of us from work, and the restaurant was very accommodating to us.  I had the salmon salad, dirty Tito martini, and all was delicious! I'd recommend the place."
Angelika O.,"Silverdale, WA",0,3,,5.0,11/14/2016,"Cheesecake factory. You're doing an awesome job. Everything from the friendly staff to the décor is just amazing. Jessica U has no idea what's she's talking about and I will not let anyone like her spoil your reputation. I don't know the server personally, but he's waited on me before and was courteous and respectful the whole time."
Frank G.,"Queens, NY",6,6,,5.0,11/25/2016,"Love this place. The atmosphere, food, deserts, drinks, servers....Everything! BBQ chicken salad and the egg roll sampler are my favorite appetizers, miso salmon is one of the best salmon dishes I've had, chicken Bellagio and Madeira are absolutely delicious. Oh and don't forget the cheesecake, can't go wrong with this one, all are delicious. Definitely recommend for any occasion, starting from a casual lunch date to a classy birthday dinner. They need to expand to all parts of NYC."
Kelsey M.,"Marysville, WA",34,43,4,2.0,4/8/2016,Server recommended the orange chicken and it ended up being terrible. Not to mention the rice was beyond dry like it had been made days prior. Two stars for service being good and always attentive to empty water glasses or bread basket.
Pauloes B.,"University District, Seattle, WA",126,4,70,5.0,7/30/2015,"So I couldn't make it out w/ my coworkers for National Cheesecake Day this year, but I was still able to enjoy my delectable strawberry cake thanks to my amazing coworker, who while everyone else was sitting down waiting for their cheesecake slices to come to the table, was standing in a long line at the front of the restaurant so that my cheesecake would be on a separate to-go check (so that a tip wouldn't be added to the total and so that I wouldn't feel responsible to pay her back for a tip-- she was trying to keep the cost of the cheesecake as low as possible). And delivered it to my desk while I was out for lunch. I was so surprised to see it on my desk and am in the middle of eating it right now. It's f-cking lit . She's f-cking lit . And I love cheesecake"
Suryaprakash V.,"San Jose, CA",75,5,,5.0,6/28/2015,Had the eggplant parmesan. It was mouth-slurpingly delicious! Couldn't eat the entire dish. Had to box some of it.  Amazed by the variety of food they have. Will surely go there again!
Annie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",145,974,6899,2.0,5/24/2012,I know they're always busy and at least  1/2 hour to an hour wait on the weekend.  We're waited for 45 mins and got seated. The service was horrible!!  We were waiting over 20 mins for our server to order and almost 30 mins for food. I expected the food quality and taste should be standardized.   Thai chicken pasta - it's so soaky. Spicy chicken penne - the penne so hard and dry. Kid meal (mini burger) - Tasted gamey and parched!! Weird!!  Tiramisu cheesecake - just ok!! Taste the same.
Bruce F.,"Milton, WA",69,632,210,4.0,12/18/2013,We were in Seattle with the two older grandkids Christmas looking and shopping when we decided to stop in for dessert.   Last year we took them for dinner and initially our Granddaughter protested thinking the food would be too fancy (lovely looking restaurant) but as we left after a great meal - she agreed it was fun and tasty. Today we just had dessert - each a different flavor of cheesecake and enjoyed tasting all of them.    I did not enjoy the corner table but overall we had a great time - and yes it is on the expensive side but - the ambiance and great service makes it worth it.
Brad D.,"Shoreline, WA",5,67,106,4.0,1/2/2015,"I still like this place!  I took my family here on December 20th before Santa pictures, and once again, my family of six had a great time! Very friendly staff, great menu choices, especially for folks with special dietary needs.  Treats for the kids without breaking the bank. Getting there at opening (11 a.m. I believe) was helpful.  You're not going to wait for a table and you can free up the rest of your day for shopping downtown."
Em B.,"Olympia, WA",4,25,11,5.0,4/27/2014,"My friend took me here on a Friday night. It was super crowded, so we had to wait 30 minutes for the table. We were too busy talking to each other so we didn't feel like the wait was that long. I had the lemon herb roasted chicken, and it was très délicieux.  The foods came out pretty fast. I also had my regular Banana cream cheesecake. Everything was lovely. As a matter of fact, I drove all the way from Olympia and ate here 3 days in a row."
