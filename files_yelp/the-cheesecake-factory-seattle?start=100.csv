Abbygail E.,"Seattle, WA",36,36,26,3.0,9/8/2016,"Pros:  * the staff at all the locations I've been to have always been great - friendly, attentive * portions are huge  Cons: * absolutely flavorless food. I leave full but never satisfied because there never seems to be enough seasoning to go around  * pricey for what it is"
John J.,"Seattle, WA",1,2,1,4.0,10/29/2016,I go here every so often for lunch and dinner when im downtown. Their service is always delightful and friendly. I had one bad meal the shepards pie that was way too salty for me. I told the waitress and she said she could take it back and would either tske it off the bill or let me order a new item which was nice.  The cheesecake is always good if I have enough room for desset becausw their entrees are always huge. I would recommend fish tacos!
Talexi A.,"Central Business District, Seattle, WA",0,3,,5.0,4/24/2017,"The best cheesecake I had ever had! I had the special item for dinner which was an orange chicken, with vegetables and it was so yummy!! For desert I had an Oreo cheesecake it was so good I had to order another one for a late night snack. Perfect customer service, our server was very friendly and always checking up on us. For the amount of busyness they were we got our food in less then 15 minutes. It was really good! I very recommend"
Molinda K.,"Renton, WA",216,211,278,3.0,1/26/2016,Food: Sweet corn tamales was yummy!  Service: Great! The only thing I would note is the wait. The later in the day you go the more you will realize that seats empty up quite fast.
Philip P.,"Lynnwood, WA",15,143,,3.0,9/2/2016,"Came here for dessert a couple nights ago with my friend and they were about to close. Luckily we made it in time and got some slices of cheesecake. I ordered their Oreo Extreme and it definitely a cookies and cream type of cheesecake. I was surprised with how much of it I ate since I'm not much of a sweets person. But I'm trying tolerate it more since a lot of the girls I know tend to go to places with lots of sweets. The cheesecake was pretty good, but it definitely also felt like it was refrigerated for a good amount of time. Hard to say if that's a good thing or a bad thing since I ended up eating the majority of it still. I also ordered a long island ice tea. That tasted like it had very little alcohol in it. Oh well. The service was quite good since it was close to closing, so we were attended to pretty well. In the end, my experience was quite good. Dessert.... it's hard to say since it's a commercialized chain that serves cheesecake that's most likely refrigerated."
kat b.,"King, WA",0,54,3,1.0,2/21/2017,"Please remove your restaurant on Postmates because your customer service is just horrible!!! This is the 3rd time we ordered, thinking that it will improve but it keeps getting worse.  Orders are not complete, packaging sucks, and the delay time is horrible because it takes you 30 minutes to let us know that you are out of food from the menu.  It would've been nice if there is  some sort of courtesy ""discount"" when you guys messes up your order. But no, you guys are snobs as your hostess in the restaurant and people you talk to on the phone.  Zero stars!!!"
Bobs Y.,"Allentown, PA",0,5,1,5.0,4/13/2017,"Nice decor, very friendly staff. Clean. I had the spicy chicken sandwich  with buffalo  sause and fries. I was emotionally  unprepared for how good it was. Just a delicious,  well balanced plate."
Al C.,"Seattle, WA",19,112,16,4.0,9/8/2016,"The last time I ate at Cheesecake Factory 2 years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised that this chain restaurant offers a VERY large menu selection (asian fusion, American, pasta/italian, etc). They allso offers skinnylicious"" menu where calories are not as high (less than 600 kcal a dish or so). Our waiter was Russell, a very cute looking young guy! He was really nice and friendly and provided us great wait service. My friend and I ordered firecracker salmon, shrimp angel hair pasta (WARNING: humongously large portion), french country salad (mixed green, goat cheese, beets, vinaigrette) and shared a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake. The total came to $52 w/o tip, so it was really reasonable... I would recommend Cheesecake Factory as a place to go if people in your group want to eat different types of food. The only downside to this restaurant (and probably a big one) is the wait time. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so one person in your group has to come in  early to check in and get the wait alarm machine thingy so that you can be on their wait list. During peak dining time, the wait can be greater than 1 hr...ugh...sometimes this kind of wait is not worth it, especially for eating at a chain restaurant..."
Dawn L.,"Seattle, WA",4,9,,1.0,12/26/2016,"After waiting 40 mins for a table, then had to wait an hour for food.  we realized he forgot to put our order in.  Said he would send the manager over - no one came for another 25 mins.  Apologized for the delay but the bill came and nothing comp'd.  We won't come back."
Jaclyn H.,"Seabeck, WA",0,15,9,3.0,2/27/2017,"The ONLY reason to ever go here is for the cheesecake. The food was worst than McDonalds but more expensive. Their cheesecakes are amazaballs, but please don't get your meal here. Just don't."
Lena M.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,21,4.0,3/31/2017,"Every time I've eaten here, I always have a good experience and the food is really good.  The only thing that keeps me from coming more often are the long lines, but I guess that's a sign of a good restaurant so I can't complain."
Amy L.,"Marysville, WA",0,2,,2.0,8/22/2016,"I was in Seattle for a concert with some friends yesterday, and they all wanted to go to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner. My objection: ""We're in Seattle, do you guys really want to go to a chain restaurant?""  ""Yes!"" And so against my initial (and valid) reservation, I went with them. I ordered the Little House Salad with vinaigrette to start and the Lemon Garlic Shrimp from their Skinnylicious menu as my entrée. The salad was a good size for $5.50 and the greens looked fresh, but the salad came tossed in the dressing and was absolutely soggy. Gross. I went on hoping for a better entrée, but the quality only got worse.  I have never had more over cooked shrimp in my life. Imagine shrimp so overcooked it has the texture of steak, and dry enough to resemble an old biscotti. They served my shrimp with asparagus, but they included the stalky part of the asparagus, so I couldn't eat several pieces of it. The only redeeming part of the entrée was that the sauce had a balanced flavor. However, as relayed above, the execution was horrible.  I ended the meal by splitting a piece of Strawberry Cheesecake with a friend. It was the best part of the meal. Still, I can definitively say that I've had better cheesecake, homemade and store-bought.  Bottom line: I would try a different location of this chain again, but I'm certainly not going back to this one."
Patricia M.,"Tacoma, WA",97,11,,2.0,9/25/2016,"Two stars because of how clean the place was. Typical overpriced cheesecake factory food. Husband ordered gumbo, I ordered teriyaki chicken, and we shared some soup. They brought out a super burnt chicken. I sent it back and it took almost 20 minutes for a new one to come out. The manager came by and offered me soup while I was waiting, but I had already had soup, I didn't want more. Our group was finished by the time my food came. I ended up eating off my husband's plate -by the way, if you order gumbo, you're apparently ordered a giant clump of rice with some gumbo on the side. Twenty dollars for that? What a rip. I ended up taking my food home, and not even eating it as my husband and I had gotten food poisoning from his gumbo. Giant $50 disappoint. Will not return."
James M.,"Salem, OR",2,233,982,5.0,10/11/2015,"Delicious! Went on a Sunday night at 8:00pm, and the restaurant is slammed!  30-minute wait for a table for two in the dining room, but we were able to be seated immediately in the bar -- I love that the full menu is available. Our server, April B., could not have been nicer or more attentive. I had Steak Diane ($19.95). My wife had several small plates: Asian Lettuce Wrap Tacos, Cuban Spring Rolls, and Crispy Crab Bites (each $6.95). I have to say, the employees did an amazing job, and it was interesting to watch them taking care of business amid the milling chaos of the crowded lobby.  A solid Four-Star meal, and an additional Star for the hard work of the exceptional Cheesecake Factory Staff!"
Tessa F.,"La Center, WA",0,14,1,4.0,3/18/2017,Less than a 10 minute wait and great service! I got the Sheperd's pie and it was wonderful. Husband got a chicken and shrimp with pineapple fish. The portion size was a bit small for the price. And of course the cheesecake is delicious!
Julia A.,"Seattle, WA",279,117,296,3.0,10/6/2015,"What can I say about Cheesecake? Cheesecake is one of my favorite casual restaurants to go to, whether that's for lunch or dinner.  Because this one is in downtown, I would always expect lines.  Whenever I go here for lunch during the week, I have never experienced a line then.  But I have noticed that service does tend to lack.  Every time I have gone here for dinner though, that's a different story.  Lines are pretty long.  I would expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes before you get seated.  I would say the service in general at this Cheesecake location is just average.  They don't exactly pay close attention to you but at the same time they do their job.  I have seen much better service at other Cheesecake locations.  But overall, food is the usual - delicious and the portion sizes are super generous with each entree.  I always find myself packing 2 slices of cheesecake pieces to go no matter how full my stomach is."
Julia N.,"Seattle, WA",15,2,,1.0,3/15/2017,"Don't think guest services comment means anything, I did this weeks ago and heard nothing"
Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",383,471,35,4.0,7/5/2015,"I was in town for a convention and had to get here a day earlier than the rest of my crew. Rather than order a $30 meal from room service I'm sure would be dry and overcooked, I decided to walk straight over after my seminars and have a drink and wait for some take out.  I went up to the take out counter and of course it took me several minutes to decide what I wanted because the Cheesecake Factory menu is enormous. If you're a ""BigBang Theory"" fan you now have sympathy for Penny. I decided what I wanted and told the friendly takeout guy and he was more than happy to help me, and gave me crap for not ordering cheesecake in a light way. I told him I would wait at the bar for the 20 minutes and if they could bring it to me over there, that would be awesome.  I went over to the bar and asked for the wine list. True to restaurant style, there are fewer by the glass than bottle. No big deal but I'm just a pain because I prefer French and Italian wines and California wines are much more mainstream in America. Nonetheless-had a glass of Chardonnay and had some good chitchat with the bartender about the area and the spots to see.  What was mildly annoying is that the lady sitting next to me sat down and ordered food and it was brought out almost instantly, so I had to go check and see where mine was. Turns out mine was done but nobody brought it to the bar like I asked. No big deal-I had closed the bar check and went up and grabbed it and was good to go. Food was hot, delicious and I had more than enough for two meals since they have a ton of food in each portion. This location seems to have friendly staff which I appreciate, and while it may be chain food, it doesn't disappoint."
Reagan R.,"Everett, WA",2,7,1,2.0,2/14/2017,"I went last Saturday, for a friend's birthday dinner around 8:15, and we were told it would be a hour, but it was a hour and a half. AND our waiter was not very friendly, he spilled a drink, never offered to clean it, we did it. He messed our bills up, and it took like another 30 minutes to get it fixed. Not a fun night, we were there for 3 hours, thought we might never leave"
Shane M.,"Lynnwood, WA",20,297,39,4.0,11/21/2015,"Corporate dining. Nationwide chain. Huge menu.  Usually these are bad things - not here. This downtown location is centrally located and pretty glammed up.  The service is very professional.  Personable, too.  The prices at first glance seem slightly high until you see that each entree is really two meals.  Then it seems like a stellar value.   I prefer this location to Bellevue square.  It's a little prettier.  There is something for everyone. Beverages galore.  I really enjoy this place."
