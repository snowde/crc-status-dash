James W.,"West Hollywood, CA",2665,1908,8066,4.0,3/18/2016,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory. Their food and cakes are all good. This location is right across from the convention center on Pike so it's very convenient. Also open late.  I tried two of the cheesecakes here, one with caramel on top, the other just red velvet. Both were really delicious. Cheers to consistency and really great cheesecakes!"
Kylie B.,"Portland, OR",181,68,56,4.0,8/6/2015,"Came here for my birthday dinner and was lucky to catch happy hour in time. The drink I got was delicious, but no way in hell would I pay double (the regular menu price)  for that cup of mostly ice and some vodka.  It was open seating which was fine,  but you could hear everything the poor couple next to me was talking about.  They shouldn't be together.   The food was good,  however everything I ordered was a little too sweet. Avocado egg rolls, sounds delicious?!  Super sweet and super hot. It was strange. I didn't hate it, it was just an interesting combo of flavors and temperatures. I also ordered the Da Vinci which was really tasty, but also super sweet for a pasta dish. I would order it again, but I would never pair it with the same appetizer again.   My fiancé ordered his dish of parmesian chicken... He loved it. Only bummer,  we got our check only to find he was charged and additional 4 bucks for parmesian crusted chicken rather than the regular chicken, which already had an upcharge.  A total of 6 bucks for chicken we were unaware of, and wished the server would have mentioned when we ordered.  Kind of a bummer, and maybe we'll come back, maybe we won't.  All in all,  my birthday was fantastic, I just wish the dinner flavor matched the price tag."
Addele W.,"Shoreline, WA",2,26,1,3.0,11/25/2016,"Picked up a pumpkin Cheesecake for Thanksgiving desert.  The cake is wonderful, great flavor and texture.  However, $53 for a Cheesecake is highway robbery.  Won't do this again."
Carlita Q.,"Poulsbo, WA",125,65,16,5.0,1/8/2016,"Yes yes yes!!! I always receive great service here. And their food selection is amazing.  My appetite can't keep up with my eyes. Everything I've had here is great... Cajun pasta, meatloaf, egg roll sampler (especially their avacado egg rolls), and my fav is their Godiva cheesecake.  If you're somehow at the Cheesecake Factory, and you're not in the mood for cheesecake... Try their apple crisp.  You won't regret it."
Lance T.,"Seattle, WA",0,17,,4.0,2/20/2017,Yum yum yum! Great food and dessert! The drinks are to die for! My server was so sweet a true light to the day. She was blonde I can't remember her name. This place rules!
Smiling I.,"New Westminster, Canada",0,41,,2.0,7/30/2017,"It was ok.  Service was good, food was good, and I would say good value generally, the draw back for me was that there was no wi-fi.... really?  Also, make your menu shorter, and simpler, way too much stuff on the menu, focus on your strengths.  Good that they seem to focus on the calories in the meals, surprising how many calories are in some foods, especially on the kids menu... shows why we have a problem.   But seriously, get wi-fi, it's 2017."
Leslie S.,"Everett, WA",0,4,,1.0,3/2/2017,Bad service ... Sunday we waited almost 30 mins for just the 2 of us to eat... then had a drink and ordered my food it took over over 30 mins just to get my food?  Haha didn't even get to order dessert. :(
Melissa S.,"White River Junction, VT",33,12,3,2.0,3/25/2016,"I usually avoid chain restaurants in order to sample more local fare. However, for a business lunch, my team chose The Cheesecake Factory. I was the only American, and one of our company had eaten in this chain in many states, so it was kind of a ""I know what we'll get."" We weren't looking for a ""dining experience"", so in that regard, I was not disappointed.  As we were going for a late lunch, there wasn't a line, which was nice. The tables are very close together, which is NOT nice when you have a wheelchair user in your party. We had to ask several people to move in order for us to make our way.  The service was below average. Everyone was pleasant, but there was no engagement, just a crew of employees going through the motions. Our menus were dirty (mine had two of the many pages stuck together by some kind of pastry-creamy-substance... perhaps cheesecake?), our water glasses were dirty (we had to have everyone's glass replaced), and the napkins were stained. It just seemed like a dive restaurant where no one really cared.  Our food was edible and forgettable. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything to recommend. Since the food was, for better or for worse, the best part of the experience, I have refrained from giving ONE star. The prices are fair for the area.  If you are at the Convention Center and want to go outside for a meal without thinking too much about it, then yeah, it's an option.  HOWEVER, there are SO many great places to get AMAZING food in Seattle. It would be a shame to settle for this one."
Eddi H.,"Bellingham, WA",2,27,19,5.0,6/18/2016,"The bread they give you right before the appetizers and entre is THE BEST PART about The Cheesecake Factory!!! Everything else is an added bonus! If the server asks if you want another round of bread, SAY YES... When they ask if you'd like to have the bread basket removed from your table to make room for your entre, SAY NOO! Hold onto your breads as if it was your own, feed it lukewarm butter that you warmed up in your pockets... yes... ask for a to-go box for your breads... Never leave The Cheesecake Factory without the savory breads!!!"
Sarah H.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,,2.0,1/25/2017,"I used to LOVE Cheesecake Factory. I love the ""skinny menu"" and the atmosphere in general. My boyfriend had never been there before and after much talking up, I convinced him to take me. He was pretty overwhelmed by the long, intimidating menu and settled on a BBQ ranch salad with with chicken. When it arrived at our table he discovered sharp, hard plastic in it and he cut his tongue on it!! They comped it after he sent it back but I will never be able to convince him to go back."
Donovan H.,"Puyallup, WA",0,14,,2.0,7/27/2016,Staying in Seattle for the night and my wife wanted to get Cheesecake.  She wanted us to split so we each ordered different ones to take back to the hotel we were staying at.  We were handed our order and off we went on our 15 minute walk back to our hotel to only find out that we were given the wrong order.  Mistakes happen but we had to make a 30 minute round trip walk to get the correct order. The part that disappoints was no apology or anything.  Just told they would get me the right order with no emotion or anything.  Really soured my taste for this business.
Sarah H.,"Tacoma, WA",1,1,1,5.0,1/22/2017,This place is awesome!  The wait is a little long but luckily you have the whole mall to hang out in while you wait :)  our server was Tom and he totally rocks!!!! Best service we've had in a long time!
Michael S.,"Tracy, CA",0,7,,3.0,12/26/2016,"This place is too corporate now. But, i still love the cheesecake. So good. And the fried macaroni is off the hook!"
Lee A.,"Seattle, WA",187,728,644,3.0,8/5/2015,Stopped by to pick up dessert on a Sunday evening around 9:30PM. The place was insanely busy. I was really shocked to see that people were waiting for tables and that there was a huge line at the dessert counter. The dessert counter seemed to be responsible for filling to go orders as well and someone had just ordered a massive one. It was about ten minutes before we could order a slice of cake and 15 minutes before the slice was taken from the counter and put in a to go container.  The cake slice (chocolate fudge) was massive and cost $8.50. I split it with my husband and we couldn't finish it. It was still good the next day.  If you plan to go you should probably call ahead to find out how busy they are or you could end up hungry and waiting for awhile.
Song K.,"Redmond, WA",49,319,140,5.0,8/3/2015,"Believe me! I am not a fan of chain restaurants but.... I have to give it 5 stars because of how consistent it has been as well as variety. I believe they have found a magic way to keep things consistent which is a rare thing in life. This place is busy for a reason and for many years too. I have been here several times recently and I'm starting to develop a habit of when to go, where to sit, and what I want. I want a menu! I have been eating different things on each visit since the variety of foods have been amazing so far. It's almost as vast as their types of cheesecake! The happy hour is a great deal here btw, so keep that in mind! Many people know this so you would have to fight the after work crowd if you want to catch it at the bar. The place is pretty well staffed with many workers walking fast back and forth, delivering foods, cleaning up, getting drinks, etc. It's a pretty well oiled machine with lots of experience throughout the years ushering in hundreds of people per day, I'm sure. Keep it up Cheesecake Factory!"
Victoria L.,"Seattle, WA",298,132,55,2.0,1/31/2016,"Man, it's so hard to write reviews for places like The Cheesecake Factory. I consider this the American staple restaurant that you go to when you absolutely can't decide on anywhere else because they have just a little bit of everything.  For starters, it's kind of dark in there. If you plan on seeing your date, your friends, whoever you come with, I wouldn't, because it's so dimly lit that you can hardly even see the menu. Furthermore, while it's one of the things that make it what it is, the menu is insanely large. There are about 5 million things on it, and definitely something for everyone who comes here. Of course, I generally always stick with the (sort of?) winning combination of pasta and a cheesecake. The service every time I've been here as well has been extremely subpar. It's so frustrating in general to be treated with little respect just because you are young. I will continue to come here when my friends want to because in all fairness, though it's a bit expensive, the portion sizes are huge and you get what you pay for. Though here's my tip: Don't get the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (I thought it was horrendous). I really would give this place a 3 stars but my cheesecake has been slightly frozen every time I've come. Do they not regularly serve banana cream pie???? It's really a travesty for a place named ""The Cheesecake Factory"". If nothing else, your cheesecake should be out of this world."
Gustavo M.,"Seattle, WA",184,116,305,2.0,4/30/2015,"I had avoided this place for a long time. Not this location, but any Cheesecake Factory. Last time I went, a few years ago, I remember thinking that the food was SO incredibly unhealthy that each visit was probably deducting a week of my life... Yet, I flaked out last night. After going to the movies, I was feeling the munchies, and I thought, ""why not? Dessert at CF can't be that bad!"" But it was. Lemme first make a note about the service. Everyone, from the host at the door, to the guys behind the dessert displays, to our waitress, were extremely nice and efficient. This review is negative, but it's not about them. It's not their fault they work for this food franchise. Back to the food. All I had was the Godiva Brownie Sundae, and a cup of coffee. The sundae description made it sound delicious. I'm not snobbish enough to pass on Godiva chocolate (even though a lot of folks consider it too commercial and too sweet). I don't care much for vanilla ice cream, but it's passable when complemented by other flavors (as in a sundae). And while brownies aren't my favorite dessert, a chocolate overload is just what I was in the mood for. A few minutes after placing my order, the brownie arrived. As I saw our waitress approach with it, I thought the sundae looked good--even if the ice cream scoops were topped by the awful fluff of whipped cream. I forgot to request to skip it. Oh, well! Without further delay, I proceeded to grab a fork, and dig into the brownie slice closest to me. First off, I was shocked to notice how hard it was (that's what she said!). I thought, ""that's a thick brownie!"". And I was right--partially. The dough was thick, but it was also very cold. It seemed as it had just been removed from a freezer. While not be best dough, it would've been incredibly better had it been warmed up. The vanilla ice cream tasted like Dairy Queen. While I enjoy DQ as much as the next guy on a hot summer day, I expect a little higher quality when specifically going out for ice cream.  The Godiva name was justified via 2 squares of milk chocolate, unfortunately, also cold. Chocolate, in my humble opinion, is better at room temperature, when it's perfectly solid, but you can easily melt it in your mouth. Not when frozen to the point that you have to bite like you do with stale crackers. The best part of the sundae was the caramel. Unfortunately, the plate had about 1 tablespoon of it, which added insult to injury. Overall, an awful experience. I now truly have no reason to ever go back to CF. And now, you've been warned. Enter at your own risk."
Puneet P.,"Fremont, CA",96,6,4,4.0,10/4/2015,"I always wanted to visit The Cheesecake Factory and finally one day I dined here for a meal full of CALORIES. Well you can burn the extra calories next day, so don't worry about the calories and simply enjoy your meal when you are at the cheesecake factory. The restaurant is huge and a large number of patrons can dine here. During weekends the lines are huge. My server was friendly & attentive and the food came out fast. I visited CF with my brother. We ordered Avocado egg roll, crispy crab bite, cajun jambalaya pasta and kahula cocoa coffee cheesecake. Egg roll was crispy and from inside it was soft as butter. I simply loved it!! Although the pasta is described as very spicy it wasn't that spicy. However, the portion was huge and it was delicious too.  By the time we ate all the dishes we were full and had little space left in the tummy for dessert. When you are at CF one should definitely order cheesecake no matter how much space is left in the stomach. We ordered kahula cocoa coffee cheesecake and decided to share it. Cheesecake was out of the world. I was totally blown away. Kahula cheesecake is highly recommended. Food: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 4.5/5"
Linda L.,"Bellevue, WA",105,1,,1.0,12/15/2016,I have now sat here for 15 mins at the table and not one wait person has approach me to see if I wanted anything.  I didn't even get a glass of water.
Mg L.,"Cupertino, CA",17,17,17,5.0,10/16/2015,"Dan is the best waiter I never met!!  Good service, great food :)!  Nice experience"
