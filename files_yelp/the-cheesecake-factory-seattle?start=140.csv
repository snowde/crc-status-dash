Susie C.,"Forest Park, IL",106,496,254,3.0,1/19/2016,My team of 10 and I came here for lunch before our conference started. All of us were from out of town.. it didn't take too long to seat us even though there were many big parties there as well. Saw a lot of Concurians there as we were all there to eat. I had their lunch size bbq ranch salad and it was HUGE. I wonder how their regular size salad would be like. I also had their mexican tortilla soup which was super salty. I couldn't finish it at all.
Heather H.,"Vancouver, WA",0,30,,5.0,11/20/2016,"After a very disappointing and frustrating dining experience at a different restaurant, we decided to get a drink and desserts at the cheesecake factory.  We walked in and they were super busy.  We sat in the bar and Alexis was our server.  She was attentive, sweet, efficient, and took great care of us and all of her tables.  She is very, very good at her job.  Drinks were great, cheesecake was also delicious  ( my husband loves the pumpkin cheesecake).  Thanks for turning our night around!"
Jay V.,"Seattle, WA",2,151,99,5.0,4/8/2016,Not a chain restaurant can typically.  However just across from the Washington convention center and emerald city comicon is going on. Sitting in window booth with my wife and daughter makes the people watching and eating here worth it.  The waiter was extremely accommodating and let us sit and watch the world go by. Food portions too large (that's my problem not theirs).  Food good value. Service great. View spectacular for people watching.
Wheres H.,"Federal Way, WA",0,3,,1.0,5/7/2017,"For the second time in a row I ordered a burger before my lunch break was told it would take 15 to 20 mins.  So I finished my project and left 15 mins after I ordered got there and was told another 5 mins, that was fine,  then told over 7mins later it will be 10 mins later and then in told the order was put in 7 mins before I showed up. So no lunch for me I  this 12 hour day.  Had to leave to get back to work time."
Camille L.,"Edmonds, WA",76,252,490,4.0,12/5/2015,"Dessert anyone?  Yes!!! Love this place for desserts.  As soon as you walk in, Boom!  Desserts! Even when I'm starving to death, I just wanna jump right in and do ""desserts""! No, not really.  Usually, I save the best for last and I'm referring to this ""sweet"" stuff.  However and strangely, I do crave sweets once in a while and this is when I show up here. I don't have a sweet tooth by all means or whatever ppl call it but their ""Strawberry Shortcake""?  My goodness God of strawberries! You want more??? Great food, large large menu and reasonable. Gotta check this place out.  Mind you, it's pretty crowded but Always?  Really? Could it be bcs of this super Yummy dessert???  IDK. Parking on the streets or park in a garage nearby.  Whatever... I come here all the time esp. when I go to see shows at the Paramount Theater.  This is my stop."
Mark E.,"Whittier, CA",56,150,11,4.0,12/21/2015,"I travel for work and therefore often dine alone. Service can be hit or miss when dining alone, usually depending on the place and how busy the restaurant is. Rarely do I walk away with an outstanding experience. I'm happy to say that when I had dinner here while in Seattle for work, I was promptly seated and attended to despite it being quite crowded. One waiter approached and explained that - while he wasn't MY waiter he saw me sitting there and didn't want me to feel ignored since my waiter was currently busy - so he took my drink order. Perfect! My glass of wine was delivered by another waiter and a third one brought me warm bread and butter. Finally Eric, my waiter, appeared and took my order. I had the Steak Diane, which was cooked to perfection. Basically beef medallions smothered in a mushroom sauce and served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Delicious! I passed on dessert but the selections were tempting. The staff's attention to me was much appreciated."
Michael C.,"Seattle, WA",1861,1246,6539,4.0,12/28/2015,"Chicken N' Biskets make me happy, so does their spectacular service. If you're just visiting - try a local Seattle restaurant!!! If you're a local - an occasional chain won't kill you."
Peter R.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,1,2.0,11/2/2016,"the worst cheesecake factory location I've been too. same dishes as the other places but executed poorly. I got the Cajun jambalaya and it came with 2 kind of pasta. one green, the other was a regular pasta color. the regular pasta came out clumped together, with clumps of around 20 noodles stick together on one end. And there were 2 rather large pieces of onion skin in it. it came with chicken and shrimp, the shrimps had the back cut open, but the veins were still in half of them.  but as cheesecake factory always does, big portions, alright service."
Jason N.,"Seattle, WA",1,2,1,2.0,5/2/2017,"The food was excellent but the service not so much. Our sever took over after our food was already severed, he was slow on water and bread refill and didn't even refill my water. So we didn't tip him that well. As we were waiting for uber by the door I could see him, kind of just standing by the door staring at us. As I left, opening the door this guy went out of his way to open the door when I already opened it and was kind of in our face saying ""it was nice to have you, come again"" in a passive aggressive tone. I didn't appreciate he felt like he had to go out of his way to make us feel uncomfortable, it didn't make us feel welcome or good in any way."
Gavin C.,"Arlington, WA",96,203,113,3.0,2/10/2016,"Hanging out in Seattle waiting to hit up the Paramount, we hit up the Cheesecake  Factory. Nothing really special other than the huge menu. The crab bites were good and the cheese steak sandwich was solid. Service could be a little more upbeat and as big as the menu is, provide a run down of the enormous menu."
Glynn G.,"Vallejo, CA",17,22,,2.0,10/2/2016,New to Seattle Wa!!!  I went here thinking that it was going to be like the one in SanFrancisco... Nope!!  My husband and I went there for our anniversary recently.. The waiters a sooo sweet!! But the food was cold.. I had him take my food back twice.. I ordered four cheesecakes to go but they only put two in my bag!! Don't play with my cheese cake!! $126 for cold food and missing pies... I will always be a Cheese Cake Factory fan... BBUUTTTTTT.. Not in Seattle...
Erica W.,"Ridgefield, WA",67,4,3,3.0,10/17/2016,"The grilled chicken tostada salad was delicious! Service was good, huge variety on the menu, the lights were a little dim but overall experience was satisfactory."
Raymond R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,5.0,10/17/2015,"I usually avoid this CF location because it is usually SO crowded. Tried it today (Saturday) before 12:00 noon and it was not so bad....our waiter was Daniel P. He was AWESOME (and kinda a cutie). I wanted something that wasn't on the menu, and he checked to see if it was something they could do. Daniel P approached us with warmth and interest. His table side manner was relaxed/pleasant and playful when we thought we were being funny. Customer Service is HUGE for me....so many servers have to be taught to smile/seem interested/make sure needs are being met....Daniel P. Seemed to effortlessly do all of these tasks as if he had waiting tables for years. I would come back to this CF location specifically because Daniel P was working. I hope to run into him again."
Sandra N.,"Kent, WA",61,169,322,5.0,2/15/2015,"Went out to eat here on valentine's day and I must say: best service of my life.  I'm so sad I didn't get the waiter's name, he was the nicest person ever. He's hilariously funny, a little sarcastic, yet he always keeps a straight face. If you've had him, you know who i'm talking about.  Anyways he was always attentive with asking what we needed: replaced the soda when it was looking flat (so nice right!) got us extra fries and noticed how much I loved the wheat bread that he gave me an entire loaf to take home at the end of the night saying ""it's really the little things that will make our days. have a happy valentine's day!"" To say I was happy would be an understatement, this was flawless service. hands down the best service and food yet. Please give him our thanks, it definitely made our night."
Cher P.,"Oceanside, CA",56,41,9,2.0,12/21/2015,"I came here twice for lunch during my trip home for the holidays. The first trip was with my mom for lunch. When we walked in the waiters and managers (whoever were standing at the desk) just stood there and waiting for us to ask for a table. The hostess who took us to our table didnt talk to us. The server was more outgoing and actually seemed interested in us being there. The food was overall delicious though, as always.  The second trip was with my friend for lunch as well. When we walked in the SAME thing happened. The employees just stared at us and eventually asked if we wanted a table. The girl who took us to our table didn't say one word to us. I tried to make a joke about how there were so many plates at our table and she kind of smirked and removed them and left. Our server was okay she was more outgoing just like last time. However she didn't offer to bring us any complimentary bread. All my other visits they had just brought the bread to us, this time we had to ask. I would not recommend going to this location I just did not feel welcomed at all."
Adithya V.,"Seattle, WA",1,24,31,5.0,3/23/2016,This restaurant has never disappointed us. Love the food here and surely will keep coming back.  Defn. order their avocado egg roll & chipotle chicken pasta. The only down side to this restaurant is the long wait lines. Have to wait a lot before we get seated and they often do not take any reservations.
Pearl B.,"Pinole, CA",11,118,310,4.0,10/24/2015,"Visited while in Seattle and it was delicious and worth the 40 min wait(peak dinner hour6:30pm). I had been to other Cheesecake factories but the service from our waiter was by far the best ever. Our table had the Jambalaya Shrimp and chicken , Spaghetti and Meatballs , Parmesan crusted chicken , everyone enjoyed. I would definitely recommend to friends and family."
Lilly S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",40,79,154,5.0,5/30/2016,"Took the family out for an early dinner, they loved it. Great food great service. A little on the pricy side but hey, you want good food beautiful environment, and great service!"
Robyn A.,"Bothell, WA",0,1,,4.0,4/8/2017,"I would give a 5 star because who doesn't love something if not all on their gargantuan menu? However, when you receive your bill and they give a suggested tip % (calculated for you), this is calculated from the total amount INCLUDING tax. Who tips on the tax?"
Nicole G.,"DuPont, WA",21,19,,4.0,7/9/2016,"Fresh strawberry cheesecake . Strawberry daiquiri . My husband and I shared a bacon cheeseburger. It was great. Service was not bad. Room for improvement for sure. Our server was extremely nice, just very forgetful. We were deciding between this restaurant and the Hard Rock. The panhandler outside said we wouldn't be disappointed."
