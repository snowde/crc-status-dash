Chelsie G.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,2.0,7/8/2016,"I will never come here to celebrate with a large group, ever again. On July 7th 2016 I came in with a group of 13 friends, including 2 toddlers, for my 30th Birthday. My husband called ahead to let the staff know (because you don't take reservations) and a good friend came in early to get our spot. All the rest of the guests came in at 6:30 or a little after. We were seated with no problems, all seemed great so far... A waiter took our drink order and an additional waitress, who later became our only server, came to get appetizers going.  Neither of them asked ANYONE what the occasion was, if we were celebrating anything, or if separate checks would be needed. Ok, our group was made up almost EXCLUSIVELY of couples. - it was pretty obvious who belonged with who. So we let it go, thinking... they got this, it's not that difficult. Big mistake. Food came, all was good. The reason I chose to come to CF for this occasion is because I felt the menu was large enough to accommodate most everyone and of course... the cheesecake!  We wanted to order a whole cheesecake to share for dessert. Our waitress unfortunately returned to tell us that the whole cheesecakes were so frozen that it would be 1 1/2 hours before it would be thawed. Ok, We can order slices. No biggie. The cheesecake was great... the lemon raspberry is a must, so is the Reeses peanutbutter cup with layers of chocolate cake!! So delicious!!  But the real problem came with the splitting of the check... or lack of ability to do so by our waitress.  She became very short with us, rude at times and made the act of TRYING to pay for dinner very awkward for everyone! At one point she told us, ""I don't know what all of you ordered"" and ""this has become very confusing"", which was true... the first waiter took half of our orders and she took the rest. But... WE DIDN'T MAKE IT CONFUSING!!! You guys chose to do things that way. We ended up getting a bunch of tickets with the whole table's order on them and each separate check/couple, needed to circle what they wished to pay for. Ridiculous but we cooperated. She left to take payment of one couple's dinner and didn't return for quite some time. My husband saw her and went to her asking if she could please let us pay, we needed to leave because our toddler was having a meltdown.  She snapped at him that she had to go find her manager so she could ""breakdown"" our check. Omg. At this point I became livid and told her as much. She quickly started apologizing and saying how confused and frustrated she was... NO KIDDING?! I really hope a member of management will read this and address the mistake that were made from the beginning. This could have easily been avoided if our servers had asked a few simple questions. It ruined our dinner and my birthday. I don't think our servers even knew, or cared that it was someone's birthday. If I could get back those 3 hours, I would have spend them somewhere else receiving better service and not being made to feel like an inconvenience by staff that wasn't capable of handling a not so complicated dinner party."
Aubrey B.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/18/2016,Long wait but great food and service. Our waiter was attentive and had no problem carrying out special requests.
Heather K.,"Seattle, WA",179,650,115,3.0,12/22/2014,"Meh, this is a refined Denny's.  Ultimately, the food was pretty good (not amazing). Prices were $14-$20 during lunch but the portions were HUGE. You can order anything you're in the mood for (asian, mexican, italian, burgers, etc).  Cheesecake was also pretty good with some amazing selections."
Tiffany Valentine W.,"Seattle, WA",178,89,175,3.0,10/17/2014,"I love the variety of the Cheesecake Factory's entree and dessert menus. This place has basically everything you could ever ask for, and it's all pretty tasty. I've tried the chicken burger with avocado, steak and mashed potatoes, Mac and cheeseburger, cookie dough cheesecake, red velvet cake, chocolate milkshake and more. Everything I've ever tried here has been delicious. The only downside is it's quite commercialized, and usually the lines are huge, and the meals are a bit pricey for the quality of the food. Everything is a bit basic (nothing that artistic or unique). You need reservations for a large party  on weekends, otherwise you may have to wait close to an hour to be seated."
Sara B.,"Wheaton, IL",12,1658,13,3.0,12/9/2014,"I think this is one of the few chains the MR and I go to. Why? B/c it is stable...the same across the country.  Short on time and such, hit up this place and it will be exactly what you expected."
Tracey D.,"Burnaby, Canada",0,9,,1.0,3/11/2017,"I was disappointed with this restaurant, I was a little put out because the prices for the cocktails were not listed. (Wine and beer prices were listed). When we asked the server how much the drinks were, he didn't know, however he did go and check, but why should we even have to ask? I ordered a $10.00 Margarita and it was very sweet, I mentioned this to the server and he brought me some lime to try and offset the sickly sweetness, it didn't help and he didn't bother to come over to ask if it was any better. The food was mediocre at best. After my experience as a first time customer, I am unlikely to return."
Beth H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",287,892,1038,4.0,10/29/2013,"Visited on a very busy Saturday night.  Had to wait about an hour for a 2-top, as they do not take reservations.  Thankfully, the weather was perfect.  Portions were huge, the dining area was massive, as were the cheesecake slices.  Packed up two slices to go since we were so stuffed from dinner.  I loved the Carlton salad but with any fresh ingredients there is a chance for stowaways.  I found a dead fly in among the veggies, covered in dressing.  The manager promptly visited, apologized and comp'ed my salad.   The waiter was very attentive and efficient.  Very loud and a lot of birthday parties going on around us."
Addie C.,"Boston, MA",165,401,3,3.0,11/26/2015,"Of course it's a big chain restaurant so there is not much variance across the country. That said, I do like the pasta and chicken dishes (chicken piccata) and clearly, the cheesecake. I'd classify it as a date restaurant but this one is right next door to Gameworks - I admit, have definitely binged here on cheesecake and then danced some DDR next door. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered. Solid 3."
Hannah H.,"Vancouver, Canada",660,216,1239,4.0,6/12/2014,"When my boyfriend first told me that he wanted to have dinner here my response was ""I don't want to eat dessert for dinner! who eats cheesecake for dinner!?!?!"" Clearly my life was not complete before the discovery of cheesecake factory lol. I Love this place - totally worth the two hour drive from Vancouver for us! I've also been to the one in Bellevue, a few in Portland, and the one in Caesars at Las Vegas. I definitely have to commend this chain for consistency - it doesn't matter which location I am in I can always expect the same deliciousnesssss. Here is my list of favourites: 1. Beets with Goat Cheese Salad - this is a small little long plate green apple, beets, arugula, pecans 2. Ahi Tartare - tiny serving but presentation is on point! 3. Stuffed Mushrooms - these little guys are amazing! It's like a medley of cheese baked inside the mushrooms in an herbs and wine sauce 4. Crispy Crab Wontons - these are so delish, i think it's imitation crab inside these deep fried wontons, the sauce is like a vinegar/fish sauce 5. Thai Lettuce Wraps - these are classified under appetizers but it's actually a full meal for me. It can be kind of messy so if you don't want to get your hands dirty and do some work then probably not a good choice for you. The chicken is soo good it's marinated in sauce and sprinkled peanuts on top - this dish comes with cucumbers, cabbage, diced carrots, bean sprouts and some noodles. There are three dipping sauces to choose from which is awesome if you're a diverse sauce person haha 6. Fish and Chips - the fish is never dark brown which I love because it tells me how old the oil is that they're deep frying in. Generous servings for sure - a little on the salty side but no regrets  7. Chicken Marsala - love this one, chicken is tender, a little heavy on the sauce for me but overall super tasty. 8. Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - love this asian dish, again a little on the salty side but lots of flavour 9. White Chicken Chili - good for cooler days - not too much rice which my boyfriend appreciates (he hates rice). We tried the Vietnamese Summer Rolls once  - omg TERRIBLE. I might be biased because I grew up eating home made vietnamese salad rolls but these are gross - I don't know if it's because it has mushrooms in it or if it's just the combination of stuff inside..... Now for my favourite cheesecakes: 1. 30 year anniversary cake  - if you like tuxedo, or chocolate, or just plain heaven in your mouth this is the one!!!!! 2. Oreo Dream Extreme - it's got real oreos in it.....embedded in the cheesecake.... enough said! 3. Craig's Crazy Carrot - I'm a carrot cake enthusiast so this one really hits the spot for me, it also doesn't contain raisins/cranberries which is a plus for me I feel like these just ruin the carrot cake haha 4. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - this one is definitely on the sweeter side for me (obviously they're all super rich and sweet) but I think it's the white chocolate that makes this one even sweeter. Still delicious but I'm more of a chocolate person than fruit. Also love the dinner rolls they bring out before your meal - I always have to remind myself not to get full off of these. There's the regular white bread and then there's this magical ""chocolate"" bread.  Would recommend everyone trying this if you're in DT Seattle - you will be hooked! Just don't read the nutritional information otherwise you won't be able to eat anything here hahah"
Ice'Shay P.,"Marysville, WA",118,26,,4.0,8/14/2016,"Food was wonderful, love their steak Diane! Staff were extremely friendly and eager to offer recommendations from the menu."
Matt G.,"Union Gap, WA",1,5,,5.0,2/11/2017,As always the consistency of Cheesecake Factory amazes me. Doesn't matter what city or state your meal or drink will be consistent. Of all the restaurants I have ever eaten at it blows my mind how big of a menu they have and how consistently amazing the food is. Their operations must be one of the most efficient out there.
Jessica U.,"Seattle, WA",3,5,,1.0,10/17/2016,"I decided to have a birthday dinner here with a group of about 13 people, and since Cheesecake factory doesn't take reservations we figured it'd be a good idea to come early. My party arrived around 5 pm and were told the wait would be about 2 hours (somewhat understandable given the large party) I didn't want everyone to starve so we were going to sit at the bar but be a little bit separated. The host asked us if we were all 21 and up, which we said yes. He then says ""you all will have to show your ids, US ids."" Might I add our group consisted of mainly Asian Americans and we were shocked. Actually, I was pretty pissed. First of all, even if we international that doesn't mean they shouldn't be serving us. And second, this isn't my first racist experience encounter at cheesecake factory. A friend of mine spoke to the manager who said they ask everyone that question. From my knowledge, no one is ever asked that and I doubt a group of white Americans would be asked that either. The host was completely rude about it and rolled his eyes at our group. If that really was the case that they ask everyone that, they could have at least worded it more appropriately and asked that we show valid ids. Thanks for ruining my birthday cheesecake factory."
Eric F.,"San Diego, CA",340,373,2006,4.0,7/29/2014,Came here for dinner with family and friends and this chain is pretty consistent no matter what city you're in. Or so it seems to me. It was a rainy gloomy Seattle day and I wanted comfort food and got the meatloaf and potatoes with gravy and it did a great job of warming me up and filling me up. Service was great as usually is but like any cheesecake location u have to be patient cuz it can take awhile to get a table. Good thing they have pagers.
Joe B.,"Seattle, WA",87,30,36,3.0,8/21/2016,Not such a big deal... Cheese cake ... Fine but not exceptional. Too much waiting... Love the salads though.
Mimi M.,"Olympia, WA",0,3,,3.0,1/28/2017,"The food was amazing....but we were very disappointed with the wait. They told us 1 hour, 20 mins but we waited almost 2 hours...not acceptable."
Rashawnda H.,"Seattle, WA",86,6,83,4.0,1/2/2015,I LOVE this location in downtown. The chef is magnificent and puts love into every dish. The servers are professional on every level.  When it's busy depending on how many is in your group. Mines is two the longest you have to wait is 15-20mins.
Michelangelo S.,"Sacramento, CA",3917,2322,60086,5.0,8/4/2012,"Mom's Bday was a Smashing Success! SITREP A wonderful place to host mom's birthday celebration last night! SETUP We got the outside patio which was great since the boys were rambunctious and loud, but we did not feel self-conscience at all. THE MENU The bread came out in ongoing ample qualities and the sourdough and the black bread were both delicious smother in butter. My spicy Louisiana Parmesan crusted-covered chicken on pasta was delectable, even the leftovers that I had left for tonight.  I couldn't finish it because the bowl of clam chowder was fantastic (and I ate all of IT, sopping up every bit with the aforementioned delicious breads!).   Mom had a great Tuna-Fish sandwich that was grilled and included a lot of delicious veggies.  Everyone elses' pasta and meat dishes were great, including the boy's corn dogs apparently. DESSERT The wait staff & serves came out with a large piece of cheesecake all aflame with some candles and sang my Mammasita ""Happy Birthday"".  And then there was some more cheesecakes and Brownies with Ice cream for us to chow down on!  Loved it all THE LOWDOWN A fantastic birthday celebration for my mom!"
Brian C.,"Seattle, WA",66,264,172,1.0,10/8/2015,"Take out orders are not a priority here. Order was placed during slow part of day (2:00) pizza was sitting on the refrigerator case when I arrived. The refrigerator case. They forgot the salad, and ""Anthony"" or ""Antwon"" or whatever name he mumbled at me stood around acting surly instead of plating the desserts, which he left to someone else. Feckless, careless service from a company supposedly renowned for service. Disappointed. How is it this guy has this job?"
Alyssa O.,"Kirkland, WA",21,43,49,5.0,11/22/2015,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory ever. The Seattle location is way better than the one in Bellevue because it's a lot bigger, but I do wish they have more seats in the waiting area. If you plan to come here during the holidays, good luck to you all, especially on Valentines Day. This place would be packed and a lot of people would be waiting outside in the cold waiting for their buzzer to buzz them. Be prepared to wait for an hour or more during the holidays. Anyways, this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location because not only their seats are bigger and there's a lot more, but because they have a lot of friendly staff. Their food tastes the same from all of the locations. I always get the Louisana Chicken Pasta and the cheesecakes are always good too. My favorite cheesecakes are the Godiva and Oreo cheesecakes. Definitely recommend this location than the one in Bellevue and Tukwila!"
Megan R.,"Seattle, WA",37,53,425,4.0,7/1/2014,"I like the cheesecake factory. Do I love it? No. But I like it and I have no complaints about this place.  The bee/friend and I usually stop in here, before a concert @ the paramount. We grab a few appetizers and drinks. I really like their strawberry martini. It's sweet, but not too sweet and strong but not too strong. A perfect balance between the two :)  Plus, what's not to like here?? They have a HUGE menu!! I'm sure everyone, can find at least one thing, they will like here. The have small bites, then appetizers, salads, burgers, steaks, pastas, seafood and dessert and moooore I'm sure. We usually stick to small bites and appetizers b/c those are usually plenty, if you get two or three.  Today we were in Bellevue, looking to watch the end of the USA vs Belgium game. So we parked at Bell-Square and there was Cheesecake so we walked right in and took a seat at the bar. We were greeted right away and got our drinks started. Usually, food takes a minute (on our part) but we were pretty hungry so we ordered the boston salad and miso salmon. We have ordered both these items in the past, and have been pleased. Today the salad was a little light on the dressing, so it either needed more dressing or salt BUT the lettuce is soooo good!! So fresh and so green! I love that in a salad. BUUUUUT the best part, was definitely the miso salmon. It just melts in your mouth and the sauce, compliments it just perfectly. I would definitely recommend ordering this! Soooo why do people not like this place? I don't know, it is a chain, servers are just servers, with not much personality and the food is just basic. BUT hey, they get the job done, in a good way! I've never had bad service here, the food is good! I don't have HIGH expectations but for the most part, I always leave satisfied here annnd don't even get me started on that cheesecake. I am not one to order dessert but 9 out of 10 times, I will order strawberry cheesecake here and it is just amazing. Today was that one time, that I didn't but normally I would.  Soooo if you want to come somewhere with a HUGE menu, amazing dessert and good service, then I would recommend coming here. I've never had a bad experience here and will continue coming in the future :) :)"
