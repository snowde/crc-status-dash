Jennifer O.,"DuPont, WA",3,10,,1.0,1/12/2017,Food was horrible.  Service was extremely slow.  Server took over 30 mins to return our checks with cards.  There were only 10 people at my table.
Ati B.,"Seattle, WA",315,87,140,4.0,4/16/2014,"I know that this place is the Red Robin of upper-class dining but it really is consistent. The menu is daunting but that just means there is something for everyone. My meal did come out cool- not hot. I just feel that if I'm paying $20 for a plate of food, it should be steaming. I told my server (Julia G. was awesome!) and before she walked away with the plate the manager was at our table. They comped my dish and a beer. There were lots of apologies which was perfect.  I am very interested in coming back for their happy hour. There are a ton of options for $5 and increasing to no more than $6.95. Well done Cheesecake Factory!"
Kry O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2016,"When we got our appetizers there was a blackened and burnt fry in the hot spinach and cheese dip that put bluntly looked like a poo. When we asked what that was our server said it was a burnt fry since they cooked the chips and fries in the same ""thing"" and walked off with his hands in his pockets. After appetizers we were asked about desert despite having ordered entrees. They completely forgot about it. After another half an hour we got our entrees and they had mistaken an item in my combo for another. I told my waiter about it and he just stood there until I asked if there was anyway to fix it. He walked off and later brought the right item. My dates fries tasted as if they had to reheat them after forgetting about the entrees, my steak was overcooked, and the salmon they left on the plate was dried out. Overall dining experience took 2 hours."
Christopher S.,"Seattle, WA",204,137,12,2.0,3/12/2015,"Are you looking to get your entire Recommended Daily Allowance of calories in one sitting?  Is your blood pressure or cholesterol dangerously low?  Are you trying to speed up the progression towards type-2 diabetes?  Well sheesh, do I have the place for you! It's entirely possible (and I am not exaggerating here) to consume upwards of 5,000 calories in a single meal at the Cheesecake Factory without even feeling like you're taking part in a competitive eating event.  On a diet?  Want to avoid Saturated Fats?  You might want to try a kale salad from Whole Foods... as many of the Cheesecake Factory's entrees have upwards of 100g of saturated fat, which is around TEN TIMES the recommended daily value.  It's nothing if not impressive - I'm simply amazed at how much fat (I mean flavor?) CF can pack into their dishes. Let me put this in perspective for you... a healthy, active, adult male needs between 2,200 and 3,000 calories a day to maintain weight.  This means that I (a healthy, active adult male who exercises) could conceivably eat at the Diabetes (I mean Cheesecake) Factory once every two days in between CrossFit workouts and consume enough calories (and WAY too much sugar and fat) to stay at his weight. The food isn't great but it isn't bad, either.  The pasta is usually overcooked and dry (too long under a heat lamp makes the noodles hard again, chef CF) and everything is fried and stuffed with cheese.  Now this isn't a bad thing, but if I'm going to shoot the moon on my caloric, fat and sugar intake, I'm going to do it somewhere where the food is absolutely TO DIE FOR.  Why waste a heart attack on mediocre food? I will say their cheesecake is REALLY, EXTREMELY tasty.  At 1500+ calories a slice, you'll be paying the price.  But if good cheesecake is wrong, I don't want to be right. For someone with a crazy metabolism like me who can eat Phelpsian amounts of food (entire pizzas, pints of ice cream) without putting on an ounce, this place is fine.  There are just so many other fun and reasonably priced restaurants downtown (if you need the familiarity of a chain, just go to Ruth's Chris)... I don't know why you'd go to this one."
Angela M.,"Spokane, WA",0,24,,4.0,9/29/2015,"I visit Seattle once a year, every year and The Cheesecake Factory is always a stop for me to refuel after a long day at a comic convention.  They have a spectacularly diverse menu and prices (the menu is HUGE), some of those prices may be a touch on the high-end but you will find something guaranteed. They even have lots of healthy options for those on special diets, and the healthy options are tasty and filling. Everything is seasoned well and not too salty. The waitstaff is friendly always and never pushy, every single time I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory it has been high dinner hour where the place is packed. Even then the waitstaff is friendly, on point and accurate and always available. The wait time for a party of 3 for dinner too is always tolerable as well, the maximum time we have ever had to wait during peak dinner hour is probably 20 minutes.  Their cheesecake is delicious and perfect to take to your hotel and keep in a fridge for later. The slices are HUGE and filling and can be a meal in of itself. Trust me, you will want to wait to order dessert because you may not be able to finish your dinner AND have cheesecake too.  The dinner portions are large, unless you are really really hungry you will not be able to finish it all so be prepared for a to-go order."
Kelsey L.,"Kenmore, WA",16,3,1,3.0,12/3/2014,"Ahhhh the Cheesecake Factory in downtown Seattle is the most breathtaking restaurant I have ever eaten at! The beautiful chandeliers and gorgeous paintings give me the urge to go to Greece or somewhere European-like.  Although, since this is a downtown restaurant, often times this setting can be very intense/packed by events and tourists which means you have to wait standing up to be seated, and sometimes you may have to wait up to an hour depending on how busy they are and what day you choose to go on. When I came here for dinner I came at a very hectic time since there was an event just ending across the street at the Washington State Convention Center. The wait took about 45 minutes, and we had to stand and wait since all the seats were taken. There were a lot of pushy and impatient people that night since so many people were also waiting to be seated so that they could eat. The service from our waiter was absolutely awesome! He was very enthusiastic and put a positive spin on our very hectic surrounding.  For the food, I ordered the Miso Salmon for$19.95, which is an average price when eating at the Cheesecake Factory. My order comes with fresh marinated miso salmon served with snow peas, white rice and a delicious sweet miso sauce. The salmon was super delicate and tender, it melted right in my mouth! The miso sauce gave the salmon a sweet soft hint to it and the snow peas and white rice were a great combination with the taste of this particular salmon. I would have to say I indulged myself with the flavors of the salmon and Id go back anytime and order the same thing.  I overall give this particular Cheesecake Factory a 3 out of 5 because their service definitely adds some classiness to this busy restaurant yet their wait time and hectic surrounding was a little too much for me and is not the place I would go if I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal."
Ori M.,"Beaverton, OR",13,27,2,4.0,10/14/2015,"We got take-out from here, to take back to our hotel room, and overall it was pretty fantastic. We ordered some apps and cheesecakes over the phone and then came to pick it up about 15 minutes later. Everything was ready and they efficiently handled us impulse buying a couple additional slices of cheesecake to add to our order when we got there. The one unfortunate thing was that we'd ordered a California Guacamole Salad and got back to the room to find that they'd misheard us and put just an order of guac & chips in the bag... which was still tasty but not quite what we wanted. The cheesecake was delicious across the board, though, as always. I actually got a slice of carrot cake instead of cheesecake to mix it up, and that was great, too. Lots of nuts (it actually might have been like 50% nuts, but I like nuts). We had enough left over to have cheesecake for breakfast, too, which is an easy way to make your entire morning awesome."
Annie T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,38,1,4.0,5/29/2016,"Dined here recently & wanted to know what the buzz was all about.  Dined here on a Saturday & surprisingly got a table for a party of 3 in less than 2 minutes. It was a little busy as well, so I was expecting to wait a while.  Service was excellent! Our server was very friendly, patient, & gave off positive vibes.  I'm all about great service & it was met at this location. The food is decent & the prices are fair. Also, they have so many options to choose from but it can be a little overwhelming. However, that's the fun part of it. I ordered the mushroom burger & it was alright. I feel like it wasn't the best choice to eat there. I wanted to play it safe but I regret nothing. Also, while I was there I tried their cheesecakes since they are known for that. I had the slice of Chris Outrageous Cheesecake (recommended by our server) & my goodness it was heavenly. Just try it!"
Orlene C.,"Seattle, WA",74,318,6,5.0,3/25/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory amazes me every time on how they can offer such a large menu filled with delicious items.  It is my favorite chain restaurant!  It seems that anyone can find something to satisfy their cravings.  My mom who is very health conscious always orders off the SkinnyLicious health menu their Tuscan chicken (Grilled Chicken Breast with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers, Fresh Basil and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Served Over Fresh Vegetables and Farr).  I usually order Chicken Bellagio (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad) which is one of my favorite pastas of all time!  Although, on the occasion that I feel like something less rich overtime I have tried other items off the menu, and I have never been disappointed.  My aunt and I who both love sauteed mushrooms now view their mushroom burger with meat patty covered with sauteed mushrooms, onions, melted fontina, swiss cheese, and mayo as one of our favorite burgers.  Whenever she visits from London, we have to make a stop at Cheesecake for our burger cravings.  My husband and I have found that we also enjoy their Louisiana Chicken Pasta with Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce.   Their white and wheat bread are both addictingly tasty that I can get full just from their bread!  It is really hard to save room for their cheesecakes!  We tend to take a cheesecake slice to go.  My favorites so far are the both peanut butter versions (still deciding btw Adam's & Reese's), key lime, and the OREO cheesecake.  Definitely need to go on a day diet the day after a visit to Cheesecake Factory unless ordering off of the SkinnyLicious menu, but such a satisfying taste bud experience every visit!"
Linda L.,"Seattle, WA",40,52,,2.0,5/25/2016,"The food is just okay, certainly not worth the price or the wait. The cheesecake is actually quite good and there are so many choices. This is a convenient place to go if you're downtown. Just don't go on a Friday or Saturday night unless you want to wait hours."
Anaher B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,148,,3.0,11/12/2016,"The food here was okay! Service was good, I've never been disappointed with their food but this location could have done better. In any case the service was good, and other than that it was a regular cheesecake factory."
Matt W.,"Bangor, ME",0,15,,4.0,6/26/2016,The wait to get in was 30 minutes but it was a Saturday night.  The server was excellent and was quick and attentive coupled with a if sense of humor.  The plates we had were both very good although the portions were huge.   I wanted to save room for some awesome looking cheesecake but there was no way I could.  I'll have to go back just for desert!
Eugene L.,"Seattle, WA",111,104,192,5.0,7/4/2015,"Despite the name, the Cheesecake Factory has a lot of food choices besides cheesecake. In fact, the menu is huge, with a selection of foods ranging from American to Tex-Mex to Italian to Chinese to Japanese to Mediterranean. The menu appears doubly huge because every other page is an ad (for non-sequiturs like clothing and jewelry). For a large party the wide ranging menu makes it easy for everyone to find something they like. It's easy to fill up on the meal without leaving room for cheesecake, so take note! Some of the appetizers alone would pass for entrees at other restaurants. As required by local law, this Cheesecake Factory provides calorie information about every dish on their menu, which can be terrifying to the uninitiated. Don't worry; the portions are very large so the high counts are often covering multiple meals' worth of food on a plate. That said, this ain't health food. And the large numbers aren't limited to the ""calories"" column; prices are above average. My favorite dish here (in fact one of my favorite dishes ever) is the chicken marsala. It's a heaping portion of bow tie pasta with tenderized chicken breast, mushrooms, and an unusually sweet, dark marsala sauce. An order will provide you with 1.5 to 2 meals worth of food. I like it so much that I'm always the first one in our friend group to suggest a trip to the 'factory. The Da Vinci chicken is pretty much the same dish, but with less for your money and less deliciousness. Don't go for that sucker's bet. The miso salmon is also really good. It's served in a bed of white rice, surrounded by snap peas, then smothered in a creamy white sauce that makes you want to lick your plate clean. Despite the salmon and white rice this dish is not healthy. And because healthiness tends to be inversely proportional to tastiness, this dish is mighty tasty! The chicken potstickers are a great appetizer and a staple of mine when I'm not planning on having dessert, or planning on overeating. :) I've been with people who order some kind of salad as an appetizer and end up with a bucket of greens the size of their head, so heads up, so to speak. Also, what are you doing ordering a salad at the Cheesecake Factory? Wait times on weekend evenings are geological. You can skip the line by finding bar seating, which is first come first serve. Note they serve the entire menu at the bar!"
Marlo B.,"Vancouver, Canada",25,70,1,4.0,11/2/2015,"First time at this location in Seattle, was seated right away, roughly 10PM.  Ordered the Calabrian pizza, menu says ""mildly spicy peppers"" but they were extremely hot for me, I wasn't expecting it and couldn't finish the pizza. Lovely interior. Good service."
Sarah O.,"Mukilteo, WA",0,2,,5.0,6/24/2016,"I've eaten at The Cheesecake Factory in downtown a couple times and so far I've had only great experiences! The staff greet you kindly when you walk through the door and the food is amazing. I ordered the four cheese pasta and was not disappointed! However, since the restaurant is located in a busy part of Seattle it might take a while to get a seat depending on the day, etc."
Matthew E.,"Republic, MO",0,8,4,5.0,11/30/2016,I had visited many Cheesecake Factory across United States or can you say they're all the same but they're all very good had Godiva chocolate cheesecake this time and it was absolutely wonderful the Chicken Costoletta is a great and one of my favorites next to the Factory meatloaf
Lena R.,"Vancouver, Canada",8,130,50,3.0,8/20/2015,"A co worker recommended this place to me when she heard I was visiting seattle. I ventured here for dinner with the boyfriend. The menu is more like a novella. It took a good fifteen minutes to decide ehat to eat for dinner as there were so many options! I ordered a veggie flatbread which was ok. A little on the burnt side which was unenjoyable. We got strawberry cheesecake for dessert and it was perfection! The best cheesecake I have ever had! I feel like they should narrow down their options for their food menu. It's hard to remember everything on there and you shouldn't have to go through it more than twice. If you're not up for dinner, at least stop by for a slice of cheesecake. You won't regret it."
Yvonne D.,"Renton, WA",577,957,2935,4.0,6/8/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory always provides solid foods. I usually say when a menu is too long it shows that the restaurant is a jack of all traits and masters of none. This is kind of the case with Cheesecake Factory but because it's a chain store, everything is always a decent quality. Why is it a 4-star? The staff is great even when the restaurant is packed (and it often is since it's so close to the convention center). There is a GREAT happy hour menu and the drinks are strong. (Also, these days it seems like pina coladas are hard to find so this is my go-to guilty pleasure spot.) Note: lunch portions are the way to go - it's still a huge portion and you will be full! Some of my favorite dishes include: + Chinese Chicken Salad + Avocado Eggrolls + Guacamole Made-To-Order + Buffalo Wings + Cajun Jambalaya Pasta + Meatloaf (not sure it it's still on the menu but it use to be one of my favs)"
Mark S.,"Portland, OR",107,135,33,4.0,3/11/2015,"5 stars for staff, 4 stars for food, 3 stars for price. Short wait for a Sunday dinner around 5:30pm.  We had the Grilled Rib Eye steak, it was done to perfection and a salad. The bad part is that I was so full after the steak I didn't have room for any cheese cake. Looking at the selections on the way in and out, you could not go wrong with any of their deserts. Oh well maybe next time I wont be a pig and save room for desert."
Vanessa V.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2016,"such a horrible place to dine. took over 20 minutes to get my drink, after a long wait we  got our food but not only was the chicken hard (seemed like it was old) but something gave me foo poisoning the next day. don't go there"
