Erica C.,"Seattle, WA",221,176,78,4.0,11/24/2013,"The downtown Cheesecake Factory is always packed! I definitely recommend making reservations just so that you can go straight inside without having to wait.  The atmosphere is a little bit crazy at times because it was get so busy and the waiting area around the lobby is pretty small. Service is pretty good for how busy and chaotic they get.  This is great if you have a group of people with you, or just celebrating it with you or a significant other.  The food is great! I like their pasta menu, but they also have a ton of different things to choose from. And of course, the cheesecake... you can never go wrong! You HAVE to have one if you are eating there... I mean... its the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. They have a ton of flavors, whether is be seasonal or the classic cheesecake! This is one of my go-to's when I don't have a clue of where to eat! Can't go wrong!"
Kirsten M.,"Escanaba, MI",0,26,,5.0,10/1/2016,"Everything we ordered was delicious! Had a blood orange margarita, the egg roll sampler, chicken madeira, and the mango key lime cheesecake for dessert. Nothing disappointed - food came out quickly, our server was friendly and attentive, and we had a great time"
Cindy F.,"Seattle, WA",117,273,930,4.0,2/23/2014,"Asked the waitress if they had anything with capers and was not disappointed with the recommended Chicken Piccata.  Large dishes, be prepared to not be able to finish."
Yurit L.,"Renton, WA",1,12,5,1.0,9/11/2016,I went to go eat there yesterday and I had one of the worst experiences I've ever had there before! The service was terrible! Our food took more than 50 minutes!! My tab came out to $250.00 and I was very disappointed. Never again will I ever go back! Step your game up and be more aware of your customers thank you!!!
Chelsea Lynn B.,"Vallejo, CA",8,19,14,4.0,1/20/2015,"if you come on a weekend or after a very big event, expect a long wait. I can't stand how some of these reviews talk about a long wait on a weekend. helloooooo dummy!!!!! it's SUPPOSED to be busy. smh. anyway, each time I've came to Seattle to visit my boyfriend, the Cheesecake Factory was always the spot. every time we come in, it's pretty good. nothing to complain about. we come in, tell them our names, and it's usually 5-10 minutes until we get seated. unless it's the weekend, I would expect 15-20. maybe 30. we're pretty lenient. anyway, once we get seated, the waiter/waitress asks what would you like to drink, comes back with the drinks and some bread and asks you what would you like to eat. my boyfriend and I always get the calamari. the last one we went (January 17, 2015), the calamari came out and it was super fresh and hot and delicious!!! I love their calamari, especially with fresh squeezed lemon on top.  my boyfriend orders a shrimp scampi and a steak Diane medium rare and I order a steak Diane medium well. see? no wonder why we're together. anyway, the food comes out and is cooked to perfection. I love my steak with A1 sauce but even without it, the sauce on the steak Diane is pretty good itself along with the mashed potatoes. I'm more of a baked potato girl, but the mashed potatoes that come with the entrée is delicious! oh and the strawberry lemonade is always on fleek. if I feel like munching on some cheesecake, I'd go with the original. sucks that it's the closest to the New York cheesecake, but hey. I can't change the menu. the only reason for the four stars is because I hate when waiters/waitresses switch in the middle of helping us. ugh, if you're gonna go on your break or whatever while you're helping us, don't bother serving us at all."
Daniel B.,"Seattle, WA",215,2,,1.0,3/26/2016,Ordered it to go order. Waited for 50 minutes. Only to find out that my food has been ready for almost 25 minutes and it was sitting on their shelf getting cold.
Michael C.,"Denver, CO",449,783,81,4.0,12/1/2014,This location was fast and efficient.  The food is all spot on for Cheesecake factory.  My server was super helpful and the food came out fast.
Marje B.,"Burnaby, Canada",205,682,3965,4.0,7/17/2013,"Im usually not a fan of big chain restaurants but Cheesecake factory is my guilty pleasure.  1. We dont have it in Canada so when I come to Seattle I often drop by 2. The portions are Enormous and price is decent 3. Cheesecake heaven.  4. Lots of options to choose from (for some this can be a negative, the menu is a novel). 5. Good place to go with a big group.  Once you finally get seated, most of the time there will be a wait during lunch and dinner rush, service is alway fantastic.  Located in downtown Seattle on Pike north of Pikes Market.  You're served yummy warm bread before you can even say ""What should I drink"" my fave is the brown one.    My go to meals: bang bang chicken and shrimp yummy coconut thai style dish, Santa Fe salad when I'm wanting something ""lighter"" this is my go to but don't be fooled its big and you never finish it!  If Im really hungry Lemon herb roasted chicken.  Lots of the appys are also delightful.   Most of the time I never have room for dessert but you dont go  to a place called Cheesecake factory and not have cheesecake!  My faves are: red velvet, Godiva chocolate, dulce de leche.. Yummy but I haven't meet a cheesecake I haven't like here."
Rachel S.,"Eugene, OR",6,13,,3.0,6/6/2015,"Okay, the cheesecake IS delicious. My friend pre-ordered a cake for her birthday. We went in and ordered it, she paid, they said it'd be ready the next day and to come in and just give them our name... Next day rolls around and I go to pick it up. The guy tells me that they have it, and he has a receipt that says it's paid for...but won't give me the cake, because I have no proof of purchase....what?! If that's your protocol, please let everyone know ahead of time! The manager came over and we got the cake, but it was just a hassle and didn't have to be. We were late for our dinner reservation, so thanks for that. The dude at the cheesecake counter was an ass, when he didn't have to be. Guess I'm learning that customer service means something different here in Seattle. My tip, if you're pre ordering a cake...keep the receipt on you!"
Linda P.,"Carnation, WA",0,13,,1.0,10/3/2016,Very disappointing.  I had the Skinilicious Shrimp Spring Rolls with peanut sauce.  The shrimp tasted old - fishy tasting and the peanut sauce was so spicy I could not eat it.  2 in our party had the French onion soup - 1 with bread on top and 1 without - the one without bread was so greasy the grease had to be spooned off the top ... the other just tasted greasy.  The salad was limp and soggy - not at all fresh as expected.
Antonio H.,"Ayase, Japan",43,82,3,2.0,11/8/2015,"Way to crowded, and food took way to long .... 2   took them 15 minutes to get me a glass of water. well..seems to be upscale but the service other than the wait wasn't bad. I won't repeat unfortunately all that waiting for food that's not really that good isn't worth it."
Donna N.,"Surrey, Canada",109,96,48,5.0,11/4/2015,Originally from canada vancouver when i went the lineup was long and we waited like 30 minutes by that time i was starving they have a buzzer that lets u know when your table ready and the servers are always on top of things which i really liked .i ordered the carbonara and it was delicious like i cant stop thinking about it the best ive ever had. And their steak dont even get me started. I bought the oreo cheesecake for when i went home and when i got home i devoured it all. It was THAT good. Best cheesecake ever  the carbonara was 15$ with chicken and cheesecakes are about 7$ each
David O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",127,1282,937,4.0,11/9/2013,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory.   I would've thought that this place, though, would be the last place I'd visit when exploring a new city.   Exploring a new city with a 4-year old, however, puts a completely different perspective on things, and I was just looking for a place that would be so absolutely loud that the little monster could have a tantrum and I would utterly and completely ignore him while sipping on my well-mannered Martini.   See, kid?   My Martini is better mannered than you are! Well, I found my solace at the Cheesecake Factory.   Even though the wait was 30 minutes to get a table, that gave me the opportunity to grab a couple of martinis.   For lunch, I went with the Buffalo Blasts and a blue cheese and pear flatbread.   All in all, it was a perfect dining experience and I didn't need to stress incessantly about my kid acting like a brat. You known what they say, right?   If you thought the Terrible Twos were bad, wait until you experience the F***ed up Fours!"
Andrew W.,"Wheaton, IL",4,1128,,4.0,10/26/2014,"Is what it is. They work fast, get you anything you need or want and do it with a smile. Very dependable when you are short on time or options."
Diane S.,"Seattle, WA",84,399,12,2.0,5/13/2013,"You now cheese cake factory good if you have a large group of friend who all can't decided what to eat. But this isn't my first choice to pick if I am just going out with one or two other people I always struggle because there are not many great vegetarian options. Other than the veggie burgers you can pick a salad, which most have chick or bacon in it. So you have to ask it with no meat, which they forget to take out every time I go there.  Also, they are  a little slow to get all the food out. I know with large groups its hard to time these things But at a place like this I expect them to have a better system. And they  is always a huge wait for any group of any size on the weekend. Whats nice is the freed bread (especially the brown bread). Always nice to snack on before dinner. I dunno I hope there are better place for large groups, but good if your in a group of indecisive eaters,"
Pui S.,"Amboy, WA",240,633,11655,5.0,10/16/2011,"It's cheesy but in the best possible way! :) I can't pick just one thing to talk about it, I love them all.  Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom"
James S.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,31,,4.0,3/1/2017,"We were down in Seattle last week and it has been awhile since we went to the Cheese Cake Factory downtown.  We went with a few friends and this place seemed to be the logical choice given the menu variety.  Unfortunately we did have to wait over 45 minutes for a table but given it was a weekend, no issues with me. Service was good as our server was both friendly and accommodating.  I ordered the steak and others ordered pasta and chicken.  The steak came to me blue when I ordered it medium-rare.  They quickly brought it back to the kitchen...this time it came back more like medium-well.  The manager was very apologetic and we switched my order to a pasta dish.  What triggered this review was when the pasta came out, there was a small steak on the side (as a teaser I presume proving they can cook a steak).  They didn't charge me for the pasta dish and they took the original steak off the bill....not that I was looking for a free meal, but this gesture certainly made me feel that the restaurant wanted to make it right and have me feel good about my dining experience there."
David E.,"Des Moines, WA",46,343,,5.0,12/25/2014,"I know that Seattle does not like chain restaurants, but there are some good things about some of them and Cheesecake Factory deserves a write up for their happy Hour alone.  We went there the other day after being disappointed with a Happy Hour I was looking forward to.  The Happy Hour menu here is great, everything was good and portions were amazing.  Add that to the great cocktails and I will be back chain or no chain.  Did I mention the bartender was excellent?"
Alisia R.,"Oak Harbor, WA",10,1,,1.0,9/17/2016,"The google maps directions states that they take reservations. When I called to make one they say they don't take reservations. This is frankly some bullshit. They rude as f too on the phone telling us that they don't take reservations. 10/10 would not recommend, food may be bomb but service ain't."
Kimberlie L.,"East Bay, CA",451,378,1901,4.0,2/23/2013,"This review is based solely on the cheesecakes. ***I have never tried the food here.*** So this is my go-to place for cheesecake. I am not a huge cake or cheescake person, but invite me to cheescake factory and we will have a date! I absolutely love it here because the cheesecakes aren't overly sweet and its just so.. Cheesy and delicious.  Must tries- key lime, Godiva chocolate (for the chocolate lover)... and the more decorated ones such as chocolate chip cookie dough and Oreo."
