Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",300,735,895,3.0,12/8/2014,"How I heard of this place: The first time I learned of the Cheesecake Factory was from my sister, Mojgan, years ago. It became my go-to spot in Seattle when the Cheesecake Factory first opened downtown, because of the plethora of options and variety of foods available for large parties with differing tastes. Type of cuisine: A typical chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America, etc. Ambiance: Usually a large establishment, with high ceilings, this downtown Seattle restaurant is no different. Booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found in dark wood with glass ornamentation throughout the venue. Music plays in the background, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. What I ordered: On this trip, four of us dined at the restaurant and shared three dishes, in addition to the free bread and butter served to us upon seating. The two, large appetizers we selected were the hot spinach and cheese dip, made with spinach, artichoke hearts, shallots, garlic and a mixture of cheeses, served bubbly hot with tortilla chips and salsa. The Factory nachos, crisp tortilla chips covered with melted cheeses, guacamole, sour cream and salsa with spicy chicken. For something a little healthier, yet large enough to serve four, we enjoyed the barbeque ranch chicken salad served with avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber and romaine all tossed with barbeque ranch dressing and topped with crispy fried onion strings for crunch. What I loved: I loved the sourdough bread, the hot, very cheesy spinach dip and the flavorful salad. The crispy onion strings added texture and taste, as they were prepared with thin red onion slices. Why I loved it: The portions are huge and the food consistently good. You know what you are going to get at the Cheesecake Factory, where everything tastes the same from Seattle, to Las Vegas, from Orange County to Bellevue. Cost: Average to high ($9-$20 per entree)"
Tl W.,"Seattle, WA",2,31,2,4.0,10/24/2014,I love cheesecake and what better place to get the best cheesecake than at the Cheesecake Factory! I've now been here several times just for a decent place to enjoy a dessert with a friend of mine and is totally worth it every time. The cheesecake came quickly and was delicious! we both had the white chocolate blueberry cheesecake and it was amazing as always! I will definitely be back when in downtown and in the mood for dessert again. I highly do recommended this place.
Tsedenbal A.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,,5.0,2/20/2016,"I love their steak. Because I grew up in Mongolia, beef is one of the important part of our traditional food. And this place really reminds me back of my hometown beef. Very good. Also their cheesecake s are very delicious although their food is little pricey it is worth it."
Kimberly F.,"Long Beach, CA",0,20,4,5.0,2/5/2016,Loved it here! Andre Grey was very pleasant and funny. Don't get enough of that customer service now days. Thanks Andre!
Peggy R.,"Lynnwood, WA",255,420,93,2.0,7/21/2014,"My son and I came here for lunch on a weekday. The restaurant itself is gorgeous - well-decorated and a nice atmosphere. Service was friendly -- we were greeted by a super sweet hostess and our waiter was amazing.  That's where the goodness ended and mediocrity ensued. I started out with an appetizer of spring rolls. They arrived and were rubbery on the outside with very little flavor. The dipping sauce was okay, but didn't make up for the cold mess that was those rolls. I also ordered a turkey burger that was yummy, but too small for the price.  My son ordered a Mac & Cheese burger; but he didn't like it at all. He ended up giving it to a homeless guy. He ate two bites of it and said it made him feel sick.  We may come back for dessert, but I think regular food is not going to happen."
David H.,"Vancouver, Canada",46,44,14,4.0,1/19/2015,"We visited the Cheesecake Factory on a very busy day.  There was a big football game happening that day (Seahawks won) and so we knew anywhere we went would be a wait.  We were told it would be 40 mins, it ended up being just around 30mins.  We have been to a Cheesecake Factory (Las Vegas in Caesar's Palace) before so we knew what to expect. Our eyes beat out our stomachs so we ordered an appetizer, breaded (and fried) zucchini, avocado and portabella mushroom.  It came with 2 dipping sauces, mayo/chipotle and a ranch sauce.  The flavor of the veggies was ok, but a little greasy. If you follow me you will know we are vegetarian and one of my pet peeves is that we usually have to order a boring salad, veggie burger or pasta with tomato sauce.   Although our choices were in those line the flavor combinations were not boring. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with Portabella Mushroom (grilled) instead of Chicken.  The salad came out cool and crisp but the mushrooms nicely grilled and warm  The size of this salad was HUGE! Very tasty!! I could not finish the entire thing and even shared some with my partner. My partnered ordered the Evelyn Everything Pasta.  I had a few bites and we both found it delicious! I cannot remember the name of the pasta shape, but they looked like trumpets or even flowers...  We did not order desserts although tempted... our eyes had caught up with our stomachs.   Our order came to $40... it was a great deal!"
Amy B.,"Dallas, TX",322,672,474,4.0,10/8/2013,"Great service, convenient location (for the convention center), and great service. We received our food pretty fast- we were in and out within an hour. The chile relleno burger is insane! I had to eat it open faced or I would make a fool of myself. 4 stars because the bloody mary didn't taste like it had any alcohol whatsoever."
Maria G.,"Seattle, WA",112,900,4028,4.0,9/28/2011,"Ive only been here once and I liked it! Its a good restaurant and I love cheesecake! The food isnt cheap but the portion is huge! I barely eat half of my plate and even so -- I can barely finish the cheesecake afterwards! They have a variety of cheesecake selections! The restaurant is rather really spacious, compared with other major restaurants in Seattle!  I think they only take 5pm reservations for groups so no reservations for two people."
Sara W.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,5.0,8/11/2016,Great service at the Cheescake Factory today. Eric was totally outgoing and customer oriented.  Very enjoyable meal!
Alexandra G.,"Silverdale, WA",12,33,38,4.0,12/16/2015,Visited again on buy one get one free cheesecake day and it was super busy but they did good for that busy day! Good food and a pleasant wait!
Derrick M.,"Federal Way, WA",4,3,,2.0,1/27/2016,"We visited with a party of six for two special occasions, a birthday and anniversary.  Arrived about 5:30 PM on a Tuesday night.  Two menu items we requested were unavailable.  The dinner items were much like bar happy hour quality.  It was hot however; as witnessed by myself because my hand was burnt by the plate being passed to me.  Not the best of experiences."
Kenneth N.,"Richmond, Canada",2246,6663,9576,3.0,3/26/2013,"Though I go to Seattle at least half-dozen times a year, i try to pop by at least once, more for the atmosphere & marvel at how popular it still is, judging from the insane lineups. The secret instead of waiting for close to an hour, is to ask to sit in the bar/lounge---it's a lot faster & frankly, my time's precious lol."
Shannon L.,"San Francisco, CA",5,9,8,4.0,1/16/2015,"Shout out to Taylor for being one of the best waiters ever, and indulging our indecision and silly questions.  Also, as a vegetarian, I love the variety of options. The warm asparagus and egg salad is my go to favorite. And their free bread is an excellent addition. :)"
Julie O.,"Seattle, WA",118,7,,4.0,1/24/2016,The service was welcoming as was our wonderful server.  She was knowledgeable and aware of our needs at all times.  The main course usually takes around 25-35 minutes to reach the table but presentation is everything.  The filet was cooked to proper temp as it melted in my mouth.  The atmosphere was chill and pleasant.  Another visit will be in order soon.
Joop V.,"Seattle, WA",220,815,503,4.0,1/13/2013,"The last time I ate at Cheesecake Factory 2 years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised that this chain restaurant offers a VERY large menu selection (asian fusion, American, pasta/italian, etc). They allso offers skinnylicious"" menu where calories are not as high (less than 600 kcal a dish or so). Our waiter was Russell, a very cute looking young guy! He was really nice and friendly and provided us great wait service. My friend and I ordered firecracker salmon, shrimp angel hair pasta (WARNING: humongously large portion), french country salad (mixed green, goat cheese, beets, vinaigrette) and shared a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake. The total came to $52 w/o tip, so it was really reasonable... I would recommend Cheesecake Factory as a place to go if people in your group want to eat different types of food. The only downside to this restaurant (and probably a big one) is the wait time. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so one person in your group has to come in  early to check in and get the wait alarm machine thingy so that you can be on their wait list. During peak dining time, the wait can be greater than 1 hr...ugh...sometimes this kind of wait is not worth it, especially for eating at a chain restaurant..."
Jay M.,"Washington, DC",118,120,18,4.0,9/13/2014,"The service was great. Our server (Maria H) was VERY attentive and helpful. I can say that I typically always have a good experience when visiting CF locations.  Iced tea 2.95 Mac & Jack  African Amber 7.25 Chicken and mushroom lettuce wrap 5.95 Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp 17.95 (excellent dish, my fave)  $34.10 + tax"
Joan S.,"Seattle, WA",15,139,12,5.0,11/30/2014,Tonight I went with my friend Cindy to the cheesecake factory at 5 PM the hostess sat us  In a booth . The waitress her name was Sarah she had only been serving people for two weeks and she was as sharp as tack! She was extremely friendly not pushy followed up with us to were three times what we had our dinner She explained the food offered us bread and butter and was a complete joy I had the barbecue salad with fried chicken and my friend had the pizza and both were delicious I would go back in a second. I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal at the cheesecake factory Joan
Tara A.,"New Hyde Park, NY",42,24,,2.0,8/27/2015,"I have eaten at a cheesecake factories before and this was the worst experience.  We wait over 2 hours for a table to celebrate. Friends birthday. We had two toddlers in tow who waited well enough.  We got to our table and  the got us drinks quick enough. Then we order food ...and waited ....and waited....and waited. The table of two next of us had dinner and desert by the time our dinners arrived! When we received our food there was two entrees missing. The waiter explained they were finishing cooking them and would be right out.  Turned out he forgot to put them in with our order and the manager was out to our table a few times. It took another 20minutes to get the last meal out to our table.  At this point we had some cranky, tired, out of control toddlers who had to be taken outside. We were comped a few slices of cheese cake and the late meals taken off the menu."
Marisa G.,"Seattle, WA",2,8,,1.0,3/27/2014,"I suppose I should start by saying that the service, food and the cheesecake really should be rated separately.  To start with dessert, the cheesecake is delicious. There is a huge selection of varying sizes and sweetness, and I almost always go for the tuxedo cheesecake. A little pricy, but worth it. Solid 4 stars I'd say. Next, the food is pretty much average. There is an overwhelming number of choices, though I usually get some form of pasta. Every dish I've ordered there (plus the bites stolen from friend's plates) have all been tasty, but not mind blowingly so. Honestly, it's just what you would expect from a chain restaurant that specializes in dessert. Pricy, and not entirely worth it. 3 stars. The service is generally polite, yet slow. Considering how busy they get, I can't really blame them (expect at least 30 minute waits, depending on when you go). The atmosphere and decor is rather tacky for my taste (I refuse to make and ""cheesy"" puns), even for downtown. Again, 3 stars. So where does the 1 star rating come from? I've got 2 words for you:  Food poisoning. Long story short, it was my boyfriend's first time here, so I told him to arrive hungry so he would have room for dessert. I know he didn't eat much during the day besides some snack food at his house, and he felt fine when he met my friend and I at the restaurant. When we got our menus, he then preceded to make fun of the ""Pasta with Meat Sauce."" Just what kind of pasta was it? More importantly, what kind of mystery meat? There was no description. He ordered it simply to tempt fate, and sure enough it was simply spaghetti with ground beef in marinara sauce. He claimed it was tasty, but got full about half way through. That was a first for him. Then we ordered cheesecake because, well, cheesecake. By the time we left, he started to mention the stomachaches, and at least he managed to make it home before the mystery meat sauce decided to make its way back up again. It's a shame that was his first and last time there for dinner. At least he still talks about wanting to return sometime for cheesecake."
Ruth T.,"Honolulu, HI",2,71,17,5.0,10/19/2014,"We saw the Cheesecake Factory outside our hotel window and decided to give it a go. Our dinner experience was epic! We started with the Chinese chicken salad. It was huge, most important, it was incredible. The dressing was so tasty. For pupus, we had the potato tots and crispy crab bites. The potato tots were a surprise, filled with a cheesy cream and bacon filling. The crab bites are real crab:). For our entree, we shared the chicken piccata. OMG it was really good! I love chicken piccata and this one was done to perfection. The chicken was moist and tender. The sauce was so tasty with the capers and lemon. Hats off to the chef and our server, Leelee who provided the best service and atmosphere. We had an amazing experience and will definitely return!"
