Julia C.,"Atlanta, GA",1,33,1,3.0,6/13/2015,Typical American restaurant for the most part. The cheesecake? Pretty delicious. So i'd recommend heading over for dessert after you grabbed a better dinner elsewhere.
Joanie D.,"Lahaina, HI",16,48,11,5.0,6/13/2014,Omg a whole novel full of different kind of food and then there is the cheese cake just saying its all soooooo yummy but be prepare for a very long wait for dinner line was about 45 min
Irving W.,"Northampton, MA",50,167,31,4.0,8/30/2014,In a nutshell: really good food for a touristy restaurant. The hot wings were spicy and savory. The pizza had a crisp crust and fresh ingredients for toppings. The Greek salad was authentic (no lettuce). Even the bread they brought was soft and fresh.  The cheesecake was off the chart decadent. They had at least 20 different ones to choose from. I splurged and shared the Oreo one with me son and it was delicious.
Fares A.,"New Orleans, LA",39,74,57,4.0,7/28/2014,My group of coworkers chose to do this for lunch. I've been to this chain in another city and really enjoyed it. Similar to other locations the food was great and the service was excellent.
Nancy t.,"Spokane, WA",0,83,13,5.0,9/22/2015,I love this place.  Have been coming since it opened.  I am constantly amazed at their menu and how well they are able to pull off so many different dishes.   Generous (too?) portions and the cheesecake is enormous.  That's why I never get any.  I wish they sold bites -I would certainly have a bite or two.  Today I had the soup of the day - a tortilla type soup and it was delicious.  Along with a kale salad.  Loved them both.
Jennifer N.,"Seattle, WA",480,700,37,4.0,6/4/2012,"Yummy yummy!  Mmmm I do love Cheesecake Factory, but I never actually go because it is impossible not to get the cheesecake and 1 slice has all the calories I want to eat in a day!  But it was my husband's birthday, so we went anyways. We started with the fried mac and cheese balls - OMG good.  We actually eat these everywhere, and Cheesecake Factor has, by far, the best fried mac and cheese balls. For my entree I had the crusted chicken romano.  I love the chicken, the pasta is OK.  I usually just eat the chicken part which is really good.  I wish they would serve it with more sauce though as the sauce is only on the pasta. My husband had the burger with fried mac and cheese on it.  He loves it lol.  It's such a ridiculous idea but hey, it works. For desert I had the red velvet cheesecake - SO GOOD!  I just finished eating it actually lol.  I would highly recommend.  My husband had the reeces peanut butter cheesecake - he loved it as well. Service was good, but it bothered me that they ""ran out of bread baskets"" so we didn't get bread until halfway through our meal when I saw him give bread to a table sitting across from us that sat down after us.  But they were a table of 6, and we were a table of 2, so they got the bread.  LAME! Still good though.  We will go back for other birthdays.  Be warned they do not give you free cheesecake on your birthday."
Michael H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",12,82,137,4.0,9/18/2014,"This location did not disappoint. On a Friday night, we walked in and were seated immediately with no wait. Our waiter was friendly and vigilant in refilling our drinks and bread supply.  The atmosphere and food were the expected Cheesecake Factory quality. I would visit this restaurant again should we return to the Downtown Seattle area on vacation."
William P.,"Tumwater, WA",0,29,15,5.0,12/28/2014,"Only complaint is there are way too many choices. Not a bad problem to have. This was my first time here, not what I expected. Very nice decor, the food was great. We sat by the window and people watched. Our waiter was Brad K. He was fantastic, treated us like family, the good family way:-) This is the first time I've seen Shepard's Pie on the menu. The lunch portion was huge. I was told the regular serving is much bigger! I can't imagine! Also had the caramel pecan turtle cheese cake. Best cheese cake I've ever had. I will definitely be back!"
Jasmine C.,"Seattle, WA",3,5,2,3.0,12/28/2014,I love the variety of the Cheesecake Factory's entree and dessert menus. Favorite dish so far is the salmon with mash potatoes(: I recommend this place to dine in. Service was ok.
Rachael R.,"Chicago, IL",3,14,8,1.0,4/26/2014,The worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to.  The food is subpar and the manager did nothing to accommodate for the poor service and food quality.
Kayla W.,"Everett, WA",16,82,24,5.0,8/30/2015,I am always pleasantly suprised by the cheese cake factory. It's expensive but they give you big portions. I got an appetizer of nachos and it looked like a big meal for a group of people. Seating is fairly quick even if they are super busy. Waiters are quick to the point. I'm always going to come back.
Daryl E.,"Arlington, VA",98,1,,2.0,2/6/2016,"Normally, I like The Cheesecake Factory, but not this branch.  The service was was almost non-existent.  When I was asked about the wifi, our server responded as if I how dare I bother him with such a stupid request.  Of course they have no wifi for paying customers.  It took forever for the soup or salad to come, and when the entree arrived, it tasted microwaved at best."
Katherine L.,"Oneonta, NY",63,182,473,4.0,8/3/2012,"As a restaurant with regular dinner food, I would give this place 3 stars. For the cheesecake menu and variety, 4 stars. My friend and I came here after dropping my little sister off at SEATAC and before we had our epic drive back to Vancouver. It was already 9:30pm and we had never really been around downtown seattle so we weren't sure where to eat. Many places were already closed as well. I had been to Cheesecake Factory years ago and remembered liking it, and so we came again.  It's also open til 11pm which was a perk. First thing. Service was pretty good, our waiter was very nice, humorous, and on top of everything. I like the old school decor and lighting, although it was largely a family atmosphere it could easily be turned into a romantic atmosphere. For example, newly dating couple sitting right next to us, romantic, cute, he shakes the ketchup, the cap flies off and hits our tables, he's hugely embarrassed and red as we laugh. The girl is laughing but reassuring. Come on, that's pretty cute, romantic, first date material. Second thing, the menu is HUGE. It took us a while to finally decide on what we wanted to eat as we were reading the novella. I like that there's a large selection of food to eat, but at the same time it was overwhelming. Third thing, YES! Dessert menu, also large, but we knew that if we ate anything, we were definitely getting some cheesecake.   As tiramisu is my favourite cake, I got the tiramisu cheesecake, my friend got the pineapple cheesecake. Although we were disastrously full from our entrees and the waiter joked around and asked us if we needed boxes, we finished our delicious cheesecakes and walked out of that restaurant like a couple of pregnant ladies!"
Rocket H.,"Seattle, WA",97,140,13,2.0,6/4/2015,Way too salty for me. I have been here twice and both times the food was too salty. To be honest their food isn't mine kind of food anyway. However I know a lot of people like heavy  food. And large sugary desserts.
Monica B.,"Seattle, WA",556,1032,2831,2.0,9/19/2012,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory today to pick up a cheesecake for a birthday dessert. The man at the counter was very informative and helpful in picking out the right cheesecake and giving me instructions. My review of 2 stars is due to the service he offered later. He took my order, accepted payment, and asked me to kindly step aside so he could serve the other customer in line. I thought that was a good idea. After he served the only other customer in line, he fiddled around a little bit then called in my order. What! When he asked me to step aside, I moved away from the counter and checked in on Yelp. I didn't realize he didn't call in my order.  What really burns me is I tipped him 20% on a $21.00 cheesecake. The customer behind me, exact change and no tip. There is no justice in the world."
Alison M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",223,1102,3407,5.0,12/4/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory. The food is always good - you get A LOT for the price you pay - and servers are usually pretty good.  I have a Cheesecake Factory in my back yard in Virginia beach and have eaten there dozens if times but while in Seattle for business I found this place was one block up from my hotel and I was too tired and hungry to explore so I went with an old faithful that I knew would be great.  Walked right in - sat in the bar area as I was by myself. My server was VERY polite, attentive and friendly. Much better service than I'm used to getting at the bar anywhere.  This time I tried the fried corn tamale cakes. YUM!  Amazing. They're sweet but with a little spice. Topped with sour cream and some mustard sauce with a really yummy sweet sauce on the sides. I ate them like they were going to run away. Mmmmmm. New fav.  I was so full I didn't get my peppermint cheesecake and caramel macchiato. Oh well, theres always next time!  Great food, close to my hotel and lots of fun shopping, and great service. This location has my vote!"
Ari B.,"Seattle, WA",132,4,,3.0,5/1/2015,My husband dine here and there.. the server was ok. He gave us what we wanted. But we barely saw him and my husband's rice mold was hard as a rock - stale. But that's a kitchen issue. Every employee that walked passed us was not happy it was on their face including the female manager as she stomped back and forth passed us. Except the hostess staff they were extremely nice and warm and welcoming.. cudos to the bartender who made my Georgian Peach.. saved the entire dinner.. it made up for the burned club. Over salted fries that was enedible and rose my blood pressure later that night which brings me here writing this review... this cheese cake is ok. Wished had a better experience. It's one of the few chain restaurants my husband and I can stand to eat at/in..
Simone T.,"Seattle, WA",1,31,8,5.0,9/14/2015,"Best happy hour in the city. Hands down! Had the chicken sliders, SW egg rolls and the potstickers; all were phenomenal. Price was very reasonable for what we got. Drinks were great priced as well. I will be back next time I'm in the city."
Marilyn E.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,6,2.0,10/8/2015,"2 stars simply because the staff here was friendly.  1 star for quality of the food.  I spent way too much for 2 burgers, 2 sodas and 2 desserts...wow.  Should have gone to a privately owned restaurant for that price, where I know the chefs are creating their own dishes, and not following a franchise menu."
Laura T.,"Hayden, ID",39,10,3,4.0,9/5/2015,"Good service, good food. I don't tend to gravitate toward chain restaurants but this one was within walking distance from our hotel so we decided to give it a shot. Our server was friendly and attentive. I had the combo with the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi. It wasn't traditional but it was still delicious. My favorite were the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we had as an appetizer. The portions were big so we didn't try the cheesecake. I would definitely go back."
