Jay H.,"Bremerton, WA",46,26,7,4.0,2/25/2014,"Not a big fan of large chain restaurants, I'm rarkey impressed by the service and sense of entitlement from staff. But I'll was close to our hotel. I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised during this visit. Kyle our server was very attentive and really hustled to take care of his customers. I had the chicken and shrimp gumbo, good balance of spice and heat. It really warmed the body after a day of urban exploration in on a typical rainy day in February in Seattle. Given the chance again, I would look for something a more mom and popish and little more farm to table fresh."
Annette L.,"Palm Springs, CA",40,225,324,4.0,5/30/2014,"The wait can be a bit much on the weekend but the location is great for downtown activities. Get something to share and your money will go further and your waistline will thank you. Great service, great atmosphere every time."
Bridget C.,"Concord, CA",11,40,,5.0,4/4/2015,"This is one of the better locations we've been to, as they seem exceptionally skilled at handling heavy traffic due to their location straight across from the convention center.  We wandered in and hoped for the best, as it was the busiest day of Comicon and the place was absolutely packed. We got a buzzer but somehow managed to slip in at the bar. We were able to order from the full menu and even though it was slammed our food came out hot and in decent time. And even though the wait staff were swamped they were still friendly and good natured, this location is always a pleasure to go to and the food is always good."
Danielle M.,"Seattle, WA",298,445,257,5.0,1/1/2014,We went here after a movie and it was fantastic! They had a large menu selection and the service was quite fast even though the place was very crouded. THey also had a nice wine list! The food was very tasty and they served large portions...
Jess M.,"Seattle, WA",32,37,27,3.0,8/3/2014,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a handful of times and appreciate it as a place with enough variety to take a large party and to get a decent meal for a good price.  While the prices could be considered high, you get about two meals for a regular (i.e. non-light) portion.   Food: Again, great on variety.  I brought my extended family, which comprised of three adults, 2 kids (ages 8 & 10) and two babies.  Everyone was able to find something to eat and in a decent amount of time (sometimes it takes an extra minute to peruse the enormous menu). Service: The staff was very accommodating to a large party that didn't necessarily purchase a lot (i.e. kids don't eat that much).  I was sure to tip the standard ""baby"" tip (20% for cleaning up after the little ones).   We also visited on national cheesecake day, which got us 50% of all of our cheesecakes!"
Yvonne L.,"Seattle, WA",5,4,,2.0,8/22/2015,"Normally Cheesecake Factory has excellent food and service. This time food quality was awful. I ordered a Pear Endive salad. It had no pears and and the lettuce was wilted. My raspberry lemonade was too sweet. My husband ordered a Cobb salad. He received a chopped salad that looked like it had been prepared hours ago. The lettuce was wilted, it had no crunch at the lettuce looked almost grey. On a positive note we told our server we were in a hurry and she was able to get our food out too us quickly."
Dorothy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,5.0,12/11/2016,"I love that you always know what you're going to get at the Cheesecake Factory! This location is spectacularly located and really has everything going for it... An unpretentious establishment with consistently delicious and reasonably priced meals. This Cheesecake Factory is an oasis in the madness of downtown Seattle and is a great way to wind down an evening of shopping and/or movie-watching. I recently had a super hot date with my bestie here and it was a really great, affordable, AMERICAN meal. I had a yummy kale salad with almond crusted salmon which was positively divine. My friend is a meat lover but she had a veggie burger and was very pleased with it. My meal was complemented by my FIRST EVER whiskey sour (their interpretation of this classic beverage seemed to have a bit of seltzer water as well as some wine in it) and I couldn't have been more pleased. It was a total match made in heaven and this iteration of the whiskey sour is the only drink that I'm interested in having from here on. Not a huge dessert fan, but my bestie and I split a slice of Nutella cheesecake and left two very happy campers. I love it!"
Colin S.,"Seattle, WA",16,89,2,2.0,6/28/2014,"Stopped in after work with a friend the other night.  I ordered a crown royal and coke from the bar. The coke was super flat. So I asked if they wouldn't mind making me another one. Again, super flat. Ugh.  Anyway, ordered a burger and it took us ages to get our food. It wasn't even busy so we didn't understand why it took so long.  Our waiter was nice but not super attentive.  Don't really think I'll be back."
Dori C.,"San Diego, CA",4,26,19,2.0,7/26/2015,"I wish I could give more stars, since this was my birthday dinner gift. I would have left if I judged the whole restaurant by the greeter. I am a new Grand-mother, so I was very happy to take my 1mo old grand daughter out for the first time. We told the very smug greeter we had a party of four. She was trying to look over the counter to see what we were carrying and asked if we had a baby. Yes...okay?  Rolled her eyes and informed us that we had a party of five and that the wait would be two hours...long pause and cold stare...""Do you want to wait?""   Me: Yes (mimicking her cold stare). She handed me an electronic buzzer or pager? That was fine but her attitude wasn't. She obviously does not like her job or customers. The sitting area was packed. There were people waiting outside. We sat at the tables outside, which I'm assuming are for outside diners but has turned into an outside waiting area? It's not an attractive area to say the least. homeless people begging in front of the restaurant with trash laying around them, loud traffic everywhere, and customers who obviously look impatient.  My daughter went in to use the bathroom and came out to inform us that there were several bussed tables but they weren't calling on anyone.Two ladies walked passed us and commented with disgust the same thing my daughter had just told me. I was hoping the wait would be worth it.  Our name was called after an hour of waiting. Our host was running a marathon to our table as we followed. He was there and then he wasn't...no pleasantries and a rushed smile. He wasn't rude or anything...just very rushed. I got the feeling of being cattle herded. Our server was really nice. I wish I got her name. She was very pleasant, and yet there was still the sense that it was busy and the staff was stressed out.  The food: I ordered the jambalaya Cajun shrimp and chicken. It was delicious...tender chicken and shrimp over spinach mixed with regular fettuccine pasta. Our server checked on us appropriately and seemed to be more relaxed. She brought me out a birthday desert and the staff sang ""Happy Birthday"" with some customers chiming in. Our server really made my experience pleasant for the moment. I would categorize my experience a bummer due to: The greeter The noise and wait experience outside The hustle hustle get these customers in and out experience Would I visit again?  Probably not. It's not my favorite place. The Cheesecake Factory in San Diego, CA is better. This location was kind of a disappointment. I think the staff can do more by adding some better customer service skills."
Amber A.,"Oak Harbor, WA",12,13,2,2.0,2/15/2015,"I am disappointed our visit today. J loved her burger but I found bacon in both my VEGGIE BURGER and garden salad. They comped a dessert, which was nice. They were super busy so everything took a very long time. 2.5 hrs total, wait time to get a table was under 10mins though. Not worth it to us to go back, sorry guys."
Renard L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,1.0,3/26/2015,"Worst cheesecake Factory ever, after my meal and my chocolate cheesecake 10 to 20 minutes later I was throwing up everywhere. I have not thrown up in  10yrs. My wife said it was probably food poisoning or a very old cheesecake. Don't waste your $ only if you want to get sick."
Ashleigh M.,"Lynnwood, WA",18,20,26,5.0,7/17/2015,"Do I even need to explain??? Pasta, cheesecake...it's all perfect! Could I love this place anymore? Im aaaaaalways satisfied!!"
Alfred L.,"Richmond, Canada",0,12,6,3.0,8/30/2014,"Didn't hate it nor were we impressed...  Bad planning on our part because of huge Pax gaming convention this weekend as our dinner outing was at the same timing when a mass exodus of gaming people filtered out to all the nearby restaurants resulting in many places like CCF to be at capacity. We waited for about 40mins+. Definitely plan ahead to find out if any major events are occuring!!! Worth the extra effort if travelling with baby and toddlers cause you never know when their tolerance will snap before parents go into salvage mode for the remaining evening.  Note sure if all locations are setup the same as marble floor felt greasy to walk on, even though my wife an I with baby in tote wore rubber soled shoes,u almost slipped walking towards back of restaurant. Not a reassuring thought considering the added responsibility of a baby in hand!!! Shortly being seated, patrons that walked by mumble the same thought to only confirm our uneasy feeling. Definitely a safety concern for EVERYONE working there and eating there.  Waiter was attentive with him taking our order within minutes however, missed the standard bread basket they promptly give you while waiting for the main dishes arrive. I always look forward to this so, was disappointed they neglected this part. Could haveme asked it although, by the time we noticed several other tables receiving the status quo treatment our food arrived.  Literally, the dishes are severed on big dishes to make you feel like you're getting a big portion. Can you imagine if it was four adults with a 2-course meal each and drinks and water plus CCF's standard tableware arrangement... Chaos for space!!! JMHO though. As for the food... was not bad as we ordered Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp & Chicken Lettuce Wrap tacos. Even my baby daughter liked her Farfalle bowtie pasta in Alfredo sauce; portion was big for cost to what she ate before I attempted to eat some to avoid wasting food. Such a shame to see restaurants to this day overdue their portions especially for baby/toddlers that can be finicky with food or just testing out new foods groups. Either way,  it was messy watching her eat it yet, a bonus in my view that she ate it all and that CCF had such to offer."
Karen L.,"Seattle, WA",297,904,341,5.0,1/17/2012,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is an exception. We sort of have a love affair. Their pastas are delicious (as they should be--do you know how much calories one pasta entree packs??). And their cheesecakes are oh-so-heavenly. I've had the bistro shrimp pasta here--perfection. I've also had the tiramisu and Oreo cheesecakes. I'm not a big fan of Oreos in general, but the tiramisu was absolutely heavenly cheesecake goodness. And the service at every Cheesecake Factory I've been to has always been great! They've definitely got it all down!"
Kittiya P.,"Seattle, WA",116,154,250,4.0,3/7/2012,"I love Cheesecake factory. I always get their cajun pasta, but substitute the pasta with angel hair.  No matter how full I feel, I always make sure I get at least 5 bites of cheesecake before leaving the place. Oh, and I always ask for extra whipped cream. DELICIOUS. Their carrot cake is great too.  Last time I was there, though, I never got my bread. I don't know why. The table next to mine got their's. I love their wheat bread, so I was a little annoyed by that.  I would definitely give them 5 stars if they take reservations. It sucks having to wait forever for a table when you go for dinner as a big group. Plus, their waiting area is not that big."
My N.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,63,18,1.0,11/10/2013,"Food; good.  Not great, just good.  Service; Outstanding.  But having to send back two (2) knives.  Both dirty. Makes me wonder what else is unsanitary."
Lauren D.,"Seattle, WA",5,21,,2.0,1/26/2015,Convenient but very chain restaurant feeling. Their food is decent but I would highly recommend looking for menu items that require fresh ingredients.
Felisa D.,"Seattle, WA",139,278,80,1.0,10/13/2011,"Came here about a year ago. I hope I'm not being unfair in just writing this now but honestly after that experience, I was left with no desire to come back here at all.  I came here with a pretty big party for a birthday... And I was very unimpressed to say the least. The ""most popular"" dish (the Chicken Madeira which I ordered) was mediocre at best and the staff was not that great (understatement). Our waiter clearly didn't like serving large groups. He basically scolded the birthday boy for moving around to mingle with this guests. He had no carefulness in the way he served us and just plopped our dishes hurriedly in front of us. Not only was he brisk when dealing with us, he was also never around to check up on us. AND he had the nerve to explicitly state that he knew what he was doing and that he was a great waiter... Really? It wasn't until the end of the night that I found out that the tip was a flat fee for larger parties which, I think, explains the demeanor of our wait staff towards us...  It was overall a very disappointing experience."
Jean W.,"Vancouver, Canada",26,151,,3.0,3/12/2014,"I go to Seattle for everything unhealthy! American food being notoriously packed with ingredients not even legal in Canada, it sure makes for some tasty (and bloating) day trip! Thanks to American Pop Culture, I have heard of the Cheesecake factory. Coming down to Seattle, I wanted one thing only: Cheesecake! Holy Selection!  My friends and I may or may not have been already bloating and stuffed from meandering around Pike Place Market, but we still had room for cheesecake! (There's ALWAYS Room for Cheesecake!) Restaurant Deserts = Yay!"
Maria Y.,"Seattle, WA",64,262,72,4.0,7/5/2012,"I had never been to the Cheesecake Factory before this year's Sakuracon (last April.) But I had wanted to try it, and after a day at the con several of us wanted a drink and a nicer meal than Subway, so we crossed the street to CF. It was quite crowded (both with what I assume is the ""normal"" Friday evening crowd, and congoers) but we managed to snag a table at the bar right away.  The menu is huge. Exhaustingly huge, when you're indecisive like I am. I eventually ordered the Chicken Bellagio because someone at the next table over had it and it looked amazing. And it was really good. Drinks were good too. I enjoyed the experience. We actually tried to come back the next night too, but the wait was incredibly long for the restaurant section, and we waited for a bar table to open up for a while but people would always rush in and ninja the tables, so we gave up. I really want to try the Macaroni and Cheese Burger, I have to admit... I love burgers, and I love mac and cheese, so why not put it ON a burger? It could be good or really gross, but I want to try it... Even though we didn't get dinner here that night, I did come back later in the evening for a piece of cheesecake... I was actually kind of disappointed by the cheesecake itself. I had a chocolate raspberry piece, and while it was good, it wasn't amazing. I thought the texture was weird. I actually prefer the cheesecake from QFC...  which is also more reasonably priced."
