Bec P.,"Seattle, WA",186,217,1,3.0,1/14/2014,"I wanted to hate it..but it's standard decent food round the country.  I was about to fly out and was staying at the Grand Hyatt so many choices, I did not have. This is at the end of the block from the hyatt and it was open at 10a on Sunday. Believe it or not, they have a pretty decent sunday brunch selection. I got a spinach/tomato/bacon egg benedict. It came with potatoes and wasn't bad. Just right portions and cooked well. My friend got the pancake breakfast and she was impressed with the quality of the pancakes--not from just mix/water--and was a crispy golden brown with a bit of crunch on the edges.  I was out the door for about $15 (no booze for me that day) and it was just what i needed before a 4hr flight."
Crystal S.,"East Palo Alto, CA",1,10,109,5.0,6/16/2014,Jambalaya pasta is good. I really like their free honey wheat loaf. You can also buy them in the store!!!
Archana B.,"Mountain View, CA",153,20,12,3.0,5/24/2015,"Great ambience!! Better than other outlets I've been to. Loved the cheesecake of course. Very inspiring vegetarian burger with a brown rice patty - but not as tasty as we expected. The flatbread was good but I've had better for the price. The wait for our seat was also very acceptable - 15min, but the waiting area could've been better."
Shirley C.,"Burnaby, Canada",37,144,177,4.0,3/8/2014,"This is a great place for casual Smerican food. There's a large selection to suit everyone and even have gluten free and sugar free options. It's a popular place so best time to go is around 5:30, early but since the portions are large you'll have a chance to walk around downtown and check out the excellent shopping.  I had the seared ahi tuna tataki salad and it was excellent! The boys had pulled pork sandwiches and a love beef burger. Everything came quickly and it was still hot. We finished off with a sugar free cheesecake with strawberries and the boys had the key lime one. Both were great just a little skimpy on the strawberries though. Other than that the service was great.  I do have one or two observations to share and that is the wait staff should never put their fingers into the actual dishes while putting them on the table!! That and sleeves need to be rolled up so it doesn't brush up against the food and the floors need to be mopped more often as they are a lawsuit in the making...greasy stone floors...! Just a heads up if management is  reviewing!!"
Mike B.,"Surrey, Canada",0,33,6,5.0,8/17/2015,Honestly maybe the busiest place I have ever seen. Wow lineups over an hour but the food never disappoints.
Daniel M.,"Portland, OR",6,10,,2.0,6/6/2014,"I've been eating a CF for years, and this was the first time I had a negative experience. I ordered a lunch portion of the orange chicken for takeout, and it did not live up to the CF standards. My first piece of chicken was actually just a crusty little ball of batter. Sure fooled me. Next the entire dish was drenched in oil. I'm used to a little on their snap peas, but my dish was swimming.  Maybe it was a bad day or the ""B Team"" was working."
Christopher Z.,"Seattle, WA",48,35,2,4.0,9/15/2013,"Pros: - Pretty much the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. Nothing really stood out. - Decent quantity of food for the price paid. - Great cheesecakes. Really can't find anything that rivals these. - Lunch isn't busy so come then. Even on Fridays since they have a lot of seating area. However, dinner is very crowded. - Huge menu selection. Their menu is at least 20 some pages. It can be a bit overwhelming for a new customer but having the many options is great. Cons: - Quantity over quality. It's a bit too much food per entree (even for a big eater like me) but I would prefer a slightly better quality dish than a ton of mashed potatoes and steamed veggies for instance."
Jacqueline C.,"Vancouver, Canada",23,20,42,2.0,10/25/2014,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience I've ever had. I mean overall I know that people travel all around to eat here but it has honest gone down. We waited 1 hour, understandable since it's the weekend. Upon being seated down the server greeted us right away. We were ready to order as soon as we were seated since we were hungry. Already a bit upset with the wait, it got a lot worst. The bread took about 20 minutes to get to our table, as it is ""cooking"" stated the server. We ordered a steak and chicken combo and pasta. They were both extremely salty and tasted really bad. The pasta was dry, and over salted. The steak was not even cooked properly, and every bite seemed like it had more salt than the last. We thought by adding some gravy to it, it'll make things better but it make it worst. We told the server the situation but instead of acting upon it all he knew how to say was ""sorry"". He did not offer the items to be remade or anything. Feeling upset at that point, we got up, paid the bill and left.  Now being that a few hours have passed since our horrible, salty meal.. I'm feeling gross and sick. I don't think he brought this up to the attention of management. Such a big chain should be able to cook proper food and provide better customer service. Maybe the chef was having a bad day or dropped the whole container of salt in but I'm definitely never coming back to this location or any other Cheesecake Factory locations. I do not want to die before I turn 20."
Albert S.,"Ankeny, IA",0,55,1,5.0,4/19/2016,"Everything this chain does is top notch and this location is no exception. Drinks or food, fish or beef, they do it all."
Elyn Z.,"Seattle, WA",149,49,,4.0,4/22/2013,"I would agree with some other yelpers that this is more of a 3.5 than a 4. Sometimes, you just need a rather simple dining experience  and The Cheesecake Factory works for that.  If you go in with limited expectations then you will probably be satisfied.   If you try to be a healthy eater, then you need to be careful as so many dishes are absolutely packed with sodium and fat.  If asked, they will provide a listing for the nutritional breakdown for all entrees , sides, and desserts. Be prepared to be shocked. I have generally found that the salmon entrees with vegetable side will be the most healthy choices. And, the salmon is good. Not great but good."
Liz O.,"Seattle, WA",678,808,67,4.0,9/1/2011,"Could it be that I've finally found an item at TCF that I like?! Yes it's true!!! The Steak Diane & Chicken Madeira Combo is FTW!  Came here at the tail end of a very busy convention weekend, with TCF being located directly across from the convention's main entrance, so naturally the restaurant maintained a lonnnng line full of gamer geeks getting their meals on.  I walked in alone, true loner style, and sat myself at the bar.  At this point I'm hesitant to even be at TCF because of former experiences, but convenience did a number on me.  It wasn't a minute later when I was greeted by the bartender & handed a menu. So far, so good. As always, I tried something new, since the three various items I'd had at other TCF locations before were pretty weak in flavor.  Their (soft & warm) bread held me over until the meal arrived, which was surprisingly quick given their busyness. It was seriously like fireworks going off when I had a bite off the Steak Diane.  I was so ridiculously relieved to finally be eating a meal from TCF that is actually REALLY appetizing!  All the hype about this restaurant didn't make sense to me before, but now I'm okay coming here because this combo rocked it and I will order it from here on out!  Steak Diane were pieces of steak in a warm glaze/gravy with mushrooms - a ton of flavor! Mashed potatoes in the center, and then the Chicken Madeira on the other end.  Chicken covered in cheese and asparagus.  HUGE portions, I ate half and saved the other half for later.  Then I decided to splurge on my weekend vacation and try a slice of cheesecake to go.  I didn't realize how EXPENSIVE their cheesecake is though (-1 star).  As delicious as it was (banana cheesecake, YUM!), and the little touches (like banana slices), it is still not worth $7!  But all in all, everything tasted great and I got what I needed, when I needed it from the servers :)"
Laura F.,"Seattle, WA",50,7,6,5.0,5/16/2015,We had the best experience today. Leanna S was our server and she was absolutely incredible!! All of our meals were perfect and we did not have a want for anything at all. She really took care of us and I would love to come back and have her wait on us again and again!!
Jason P.,"Somerdale, NJ",36,166,,3.0,5/29/2013,"Usually a trip to the Cheesecake Factory will earn a 4 star visit, but during my trip to Seattle definitely didn't leave me with a 4 star experience.  I walked in and asked if I could sit at the bar.  I sat down and wasn't greeted for a decent 5-10 minutes.  I picked up my own menu and started browsing they overly expansive menu.  I went with their cajun pasta and called it a day.  I was asked if I wanted bread, I said yes of course.  What they didn't tell me is that it cost extra.  Not that I minded because I wasn't paying, but if you are going to up sell you absolutely need to tell your customers so they aren't blind-sided when they are handed the bill.  Big no-no. The entree came out promptly after the bread came out.  The pasta was cooked nicely and had an over-abundance of chicken and shrimp.  That is a great thing.  All the veggies in the dish were delicious and was very satisfied with the dinner. I waited for what seemed like a good 10-15 as my plate was pushed up to the edge of the bar.  I guess I expected the bartender to ask me if I was finished, but not until I put cash on the tab in the glass did he come over.  He was far too concerned with watching TV than actually checking up. Overall when the food is prepared well and tastes as good as it is, it can overshadow the shoddy customer service."
Yumi K.,"Richmond, Canada",11,51,449,5.0,5/30/2011,"The food was good, the service was EXCELLENT... may I recommend a waitress, named ""Stephanie""? I think thats her name. despite my picky-ness, she served me VERY well. Thank you :-)"
Theo A.,"New York, NY",17,90,152,4.0,8/25/2013,"A hidden treasure in downtown seattle, not very easy to discover, and notice in that area of downtown.  Ambiance is very impressive, sophisticated, very spacious inside, and an ideal meeting place for socializing with friends/family, getting some restaurant meals, and extremely decadent, full of flavor dessert items, especially unique cheesecakes such as white chocolate raspberry. Desserts in Cheesecake Factory is worth that price, even if expensive.  This Cheesecake Factory location must be very original compared to other locations of that same company, and feels like an independent business for visually stimulating, very unique ambiance inside, even if technically part of that chain store company. It would be nice if there was wireless internet. Then again, not every place is able to offer internet, more of a place to completely enjoy eating, having dessert, and socializing with friends/family/acquaintances. There is already enough café bars with free wireless internet with seattle."
Shawn G.,"Moccasin, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/5/2015,"Very polite people. Professional waiter. Food was very good ate so much i felt like i was going to explode. I had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and shrimp, it was cooked very well. Had some cheesecake after the meal of course to top it all off. I left stuffed and satisfied."
Chris O.,"Seattle, WA",367,315,904,3.0,4/1/2011,"Boy, what were we thinking showing up with a party of six to eat dinner here on a Friday night?!  I think the wait was around 1-1.5 hours, but it went by relatively quick. Aside from the wait, another thing that will prolong your meal is trying to decide what you order.  Cheesecake Factory's menu has a pretty good variety and I think I went through it 3x before I decided, and I finally landed on the farmhouse cheeseburger. What made this burger a little different from the rest was that it included a fried egg and grill pork belly ON TOP of the burger patty.  Talk about calorie overload, but oh so good!   But, there's always a 'but"", the sweet potato fries suck.  Out of every single sweet potato fries I've eaten  anywhere, these were the worst in terms of taste."
Alisha W.,"Dallas, TX",220,126,144,3.0,9/3/2013,"This place is outrageous. I recognize that I came here on a really busy night (Sunday night of PAX weekend), but there was a 15 person line for the to-go cheesecake line and a handful of people behind the counter cranking out orders. They were clearly hard working and really trying to go fast. BUT, the guy taking orders, was also the same guy taking payments, and bagging the cheesecake orders as they came up, and delivering the cake to the 10 more people waiting for their order. What's up with that?? Talk about bottleneck! I really appreciate their efforts, but I ended up waiting 30 minutes just for two slices (that were waiting on the counter for 10 minutes).  Redeeming factor to justify 3 star rating: Cheesecake was delicious - I had lemon raspberry and kahlua and both were MONEY. But questionable whether they were worth it for the long unpleasant and crowded wait"
Brendan C.,"Tampa, FL",246,123,4,4.0,6/28/2013,"For a Cheesecake Factory, this one isn't bad. The restaurant has issues with long lines and waits, but its not a bad wait.  A couple times they messed up our order but politely fixed it, not bad! There's not much else to say if you're a regular of Cheesecake Factory - large menus, vibrant decor, lots of people. Variety, easy eats, cheap eats to expensive entrees, cheesecake is the only place that can get away with a huge menu. This Seattle location is across the street from a regal theater - not a bad dinner/movie place."
Chrissie S.,"Seattle, WA",349,41,66,5.0,1/25/2015,"So, this is the 3rd time I've eaten at this specific Cheesecake Factory & it has been wonderful every time. There is really nothing on the menu that you could go wrong with. I am partial to the pastas & a yummy slice of cheesecake to end my meal with. The service is friendly & as others have said, on busy or event nights, you should expect a little wait. I will continue to go here for sure :)"
