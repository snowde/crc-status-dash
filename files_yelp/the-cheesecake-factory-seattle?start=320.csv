Lena L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",32,150,152,2.0,8/1/2011,"A chain restaurant, so expect the usual chain type food quality. The dessert is what its famous for. The inside of the building was great, very beautiful.Excellent lighting for an evening romantic dinner. My date and I had a great time hanging out and the server was a nice guy who suggested a few more places for us to venture to. As every other place in Seattle serves, the Cheescake in Seattle also serves sourdough bread, but thank goodness for the brown pumperknickel bread that is sweeter. I love buttering my dinner bread, so this is important to me. The bread for a 3 out of 10 for me.  I have to mention that the crab and artichoke dip was nasty. it tasty bland, overly cream cheesy, and i needed to add quite a bit of pepper to continue eating it. The one very cool thing was the building and location. it must cost a mimllion to lease out that property in the middle of downtown Seattle."
Caitlin H.,"Coquitlam, Canada",0,2,,1.0,11/12/2014,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE CELIAC OR HAVE TO EAT GLUTEN FREE! My boyfriend wanted to take me to the cheesecake factory when we visited Seattle for our anniversary weekend because a) he knows cheesecake is one of my weaknesses and b) we found out they had a gluten free cheesecake (yes, only one but fair enough). After waiting over an hour to get in, I asked them about their gluten free menu. The dish I ordered actually sounded really good so my boyfriend decided to order it as well. Twenty minutes later, we were informed that the order did not go through because they were out of chicken. The only option left for me was gluten free pasta. I should have known when it was hard to tell it was gluten free but in all honesty, I'm so used to some of those pastas now that I really cannot tell the difference especially if you get a good corn-quinoa-rice mix. Next time I will be sure to ask to see the packaging because I was out of commission following that meal.  I know it was not the cheesecake (which was actually quite good) because I tried the remaining bit on Monday night as a test to see what had made me sick. It was definitely the pasta."
Bree M.,"Sumner, WA",0,37,11,4.0,5/29/2014,This place seriously has everything on the menu it was hard to choose what I wanted. That might bother some people but I really like a variety to choose from. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. He was always filling our waters and keep our bread basket full. I got the chicken katsu with brown rice and grilled veggies. It was absolutely delicious. My girlfriends got the macaroni cheeseburger which looked a bit messy for me but tasty. My sister ordered the four cheese pasta she enjoyed and that was really yummy when I tasted it. The food was overall really great! Unfortunately we were going to a concert after so we couldn't bring our leftovers. Also was too full for cheesecake I'll have to try that next time.
Vincent N.,"Vancouver, Canada",138,97,97,4.0,3/17/2013,"This is the third time that I've been to the Cheesecake factory. First off I really do enjoy the cheesecake here because it's a much higher quality than what you can get in Vancouver, B.C. So I always make a point to drop by and grab a slice. This time I had the red velvet cheesecake, and everything was extremely balanced, with the exception of the white chocolate being quite sweet (as it was to be expected).  I had the shrimp angel hair pasta. The marina sauce was fresh, tangy, with some citrus, but not overpowering. The pasta is a solid 4 stars and has a nice texture, but don't expect it to be gourmet Italian, but definitely a cut above any family restaurant. The pasta was a solid 3.5 stars.  Our server was nice and attentive, and always had a great smile on her face. Overall all the staff were great. Would I return. You betcha."
Chelsea J.,"Seattle, WA",643,1094,96,4.0,4/4/2011,"One of the big pluses about the Cheesecake Factory is its dependability. It also has good food and the cheesecakes and other delectables are delicious! You always know what to expect and the food tastes the same whether you are at the Seattle restaurant or one anywhere in the country.  As others have mentioned, the wait is a pain. There is always a wait to eat here, especially on a weekend night. They have a huge menu so you are likely to find something even the pickiest eater would enjoy, including kids. I love their cheesecakes. Although a bit spendy and maybe not as unique as an independent bakery's creations, the cheesecake tastes darn good and is a great way to cap off an afternoon of shopping at Westlake or Pacific Place."
Jakob M.,"Houston, TX",36,36,,4.0,2/16/2015,"I've always left here satisfied with the price, portions, and palatability. It's always hoppin, and every time I've gone, there's been a wait of usually 20 minutes or more. There's not a lot to do that's within range of their buzzer thing while you're waiting other than the bar, although that's usually busy too. The atmosphere is aesthetically pleasing and the staff is really friendly. Ironically enough, while I'm a huge fan of cheesecake, I'm not too keen on this restaurant chain's recipe."
Emily D.,"San Mateo, CA",24,33,,2.0,8/12/2014,"I've been to several CF locations, Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, and somewhere in Southern California. In my opinion, the food is overpriced, incredibly unhealthy for you, generic, and simply not THAT great. The cheesecake is all incredibly rich and sweet, I couldn't even finish one slice that I split with my boyfriend. What I really don't get about this place is that it's pretending to be some upscale, fancy restaurant. Faux-fancy decor, high prices, tourist-central location, but there's ads in the menu, you get butter in little wrapped packages with your bread, and the food is just slightly above average. If I'm paying $16-$20 for an entree, I shouldn't have to unwrap my damn butter. Come on. The thing is, there are tons of great restaurants near the Seattle CF location. For the same price range, you can get much better food that represents PNW fare, and support a local business. Why oh why would you go here to feel sick and bloated afterwards AND be out $30+ for a standard drink, entree, dessert combo?  Do yourself a favor and go to any of these other awesome restaurants in downtown Seattle: Blue Acre, Le Pichet, Dahlia Lounge, Sitka & Spruce, Steelhead Diner, Etta's, etc."
Tina L.,"Richmond, Canada",0,38,38,4.0,7/1/2012,"Oh Cheesecake factory how I love thee. First time at the downtown Seattle location, but its awesome as usual. We had sunday brunch. I had the baja chicken hash, yummmm. The BF had the breakfast enchilda, tortilla something like that, can;t remember as i was mowing down on my brunch. And then of course had to have cheesecake. On my quest to eat all cheesecakes offered, todays treat was caramel turtle cheesecake. It was cheesecake heaven. Our waiter was great, super friendly and attentive.  Totally worth driving 2 and a half hours in the rain"
Samantha L.,"Renton, WA",135,362,145,3.0,10/28/2013,"The prices are high, the service is great - sweet, and attentive, the food is solid - but oh boy are those prices high for what you are getting. We were here for my husband's work dinner, which is the only reason why I even remembered that this place was here. Regardless, it should be noted that the mojitos are delicious. I ordered Bang Bang Chicken (sans Shrimp) and my husband ordered their Mushroom Burger. Everything was good, my dish was delicious, but my husband's burger was like eating a salt-lick. An over-done salt-lick. We'll only be back if other people request it - there are just an incredible number of local mom and pops nearby that I would definitely prioritize over this place. But if you're looking for Americana with a touch of ethnic flair, then this is definitely your place to be."
Bobby L.,"Silverdale, WA",51,28,5,1.0,9/1/2014,"Food so generic I think it came from a microwave. We had 2 buffalo wings10 in an order 2 pizzas very small, crab won tons, 4 pieces of Cheesecake. 128 dollars. Food bland and thoughtless. You can do better than this place keep looking. You can get better wings and pizza from domino's. The crab wontons were ok but the sauce tasted like a vinaigrette and it didn't really go together. Generic generic generic Cheesecake was very good, everyone loved it but 7 dollar a slice it should be..."
Mark M.,"Delta, Canada",0,15,1,4.0,3/17/2015,"Menu is huge. You'll spend 30min just looking through it. I've been a bunch of times and the food is good.  I haven't found a dish that I love (yet), there's just too much to go through. Well priced for what you get. Great for families. I haven't found a dish that I love (yet).  The cheesecake is awesome though (as expected). Service has always been great."
Ninette C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",403,1418,172,3.0,9/7/2011,"I have been here a few times.  Most recently, my boyfriend and I came here for a weekday lunch. There was still a bit of a wait which set us back which sucked considering I was on my lunch hour break. I ordered the fettucini e with sundried cream sauce and mushrooms instead of chicken.  My boyfriend has the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a corn, pepper mix thing.   It was kind of our faults for being dumb.  We both said we wanted lighter meals and ordered that.  Seriously though, my pasta was so so oily.  I barely touched it.  I ate it again for dinner that night and that lunch portion was the only thing I ate all day (sans a few celery and apple slices back at the office later).  My boyfriend said his meatloaf was kind of weird too. I should give this place 2 stars based off of this experience, but every once in a while, the Cheesecake Factory hits the spot.  I've had good fried mac and cheese bits, Eveleyn's pasta and strawberry cheesecake here.  This location isn't as bad as Bellevue in terms of oil, but still, if you want a light meal, don't go to the Cheesecake Factory!"
Paula C.,"Rio Vista, CA",0,13,,5.0,2/20/2016,Always consistent and very quick service even when they are busy.  This restaurant is especially busy since it right across from the convention center.
Vicky L.,"Seattle, WA",21,88,47,4.0,10/12/2011,"I have already written about a Cheesecake Factory but this one is in downtown, so yeah. This particular Cheesecake Factory always make me feel like I am on a date. Or if not on a date, then I feel like I am squinting. Why? Because of the lighting. It's always a bit too dim unless you're there when it's day time. I went here with my sister recently and we were seated at the corner, face to face, next to a couple planning their wedding...it was hard to enjoy the meal with a straight face. And Beyonce's ""If I Was A Boy"" was also playing in the background. It's an odd song to hear at a restaurant.  So, if you want to trick someone into going on a date or feel like the ""hanging out"" is a date then this is the place to go. Besides that, the food and the service here have yet to disappoint me. I l-o-v-e their mash potatoes. It can't be beaten."
George C.,"Washington, DC",30,624,18,3.0,8/7/2011,"Nothing special going on here but also not bad either. The menu is 15 pages long.  It's out of control!  This place has something for everyone but maybe that's why they can't really master one dish either.   The portions are HUGE so come hungry.  I ordered the cheese quesadilla, a Boston salad, corn cakes and a slice of turtle cheescake.  Everything was decent. Our server was on point.  She knew what she was doing and made sure we were happy with everything.   The service and cheesecake were the best things about our experience.  Is it worth a long wait?  Probably not.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. It's worth eating here once just to say you did."
Elyse M.,"Seattle, WA",3,46,5,4.0,12/10/2014,"I hate the cheesecake, it's too sweet.  That being said, on the list of places that treat me right, this is at the top.  They are so good to me at the end of a long day.  The service is extraordinary. The food is genuinely good.  Get the fried mac & cheese.  You really have no idea what you are missing.  I love this location.  FIVE STAR SERVICE.  Five to my bartender who is always so nice.  I'm not a tourist.  I'm not after dessert.  If you find yourself tired at the end of a long day, let them be good to you too."
Franklin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",361,781,166,4.0,10/5/2013,"I was at the bar here, no dining in this review. The beers were served in an efficient manner, the televisions at the bar had the proper ratio of sports channels to news channels, and staff was great.  Next time, food."
Jared D.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",0,13,3,1.0,8/11/2016,Absolutely horrible. I am a 25 year restaurant industry veteran and understand how a restaurant should work. I called to order take out and was transferred over. After waiting on hold 5 mins i called back and was told the bakery was full and i was the second call. I waited another 5 min on hold and then staying on my phone started walking to the restaurant. Upon arriving (still on hold) i saw they were on about a 10 table wait and had 2 groups at the takeout counter. The patio was not seated at all and it did not have a busy feel in the restaurant. A male manager was just standing next to the togo counter doing nothing at all. I had been on hold 15 min but he was obviously too busy to answer a phone or to be aware of his surroundings. Just as i reached the counter the to go waitress picked up the phone and treated me like i had waited 30secs. Still waiting on my food but i dont expect much.
Becky G.,"Poulsbo, WA",73,225,21,4.0,10/7/2012,"My husband and I try to stick with locally owned, non- chain restaurants. However, my mother was visiting, and she really enjoys The Cheesecake Factory, so we took her.  For a restaurant that offers so, so many things on their menu you would think that the food would be mediocre. It is surprising very tasty. My mother order the crab cake sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese....mac and cheese is so deliciously gooey and cheesy! My husband ordered the macaroni and cheese burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed. And, I ordered the chicken salad sandwich.....huge! And, very delicious with almonds and capers. Of course while at The Cheesecake Factory, you need to order cheesecake! Raspberry lemon cheesecake...delicious. Chocolate mousse cheesecake....not too rich, velvety smooth! Dutch apple crumble cheesecake....devoured. Definitely good for a chain restaurant. Waitress was very attentive and friendly."
Opal D.,"Seattle, WA",156,1419,163,2.0,4/26/2013,"Mediocre food, absurdly large portions, in a stale atmosphere. I like to pick up cheesecake to-go, but prefer not to eat there."
