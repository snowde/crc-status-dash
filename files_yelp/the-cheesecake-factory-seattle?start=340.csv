Diana F.,"Seattle, WA",6,7,,4.0,8/8/2016,"We've been here a couple of times since moving to Seattle area. Our first visit was about a year ago. We had to wait about 35 minutes to be seated , the restaurant was clean, service was good but the food was mediocre. We'd decided it wasn't worth the wait and hadn't returned but in July family flew in and wanted to eat here. We told them about our first experience and decided mediocre isn't horrible and 35 minutes to wait during dinner hour is about the norm so  maybe a second chance might be in order. We arrived with a party of 8 & waited for what seemed like about an hour to be seated so if u have a large party  be sure to get an early start.  We had part of our group actually leave after checking in and go shopping, we told  them we'd call them when it was time to be seated but we were still waiting to be seated when they returned. I think the hostess actually forgot about us,  we never received a pager. She was telling me the manager had to handle our party from the get go but he/she never showed their face to us and we had to remind her we were there a couple of times. She actually started to seat another large party that arrived after us before us.  Then she said OH your still here, obviously not doing her job. Once finally seated our server was friendly,  fast and very patient in answering our questions regarding menu. Restaurant was clean food was excellent, maybe they hired a new chef.  We would've given them 5 stars  if the wait hadn't been so long. An hour wait with little ones can be a bit trying. When checking in the hostess  immediately said she'd get the manager to speak with me about seating,  I assumed due to our party size but after waiting for the manager 15 minutes I had to remind the hostess we were still there.  I thought it was odd she was getting a manager in the first place. Several minutes go by and again we tell her we hadn't heard from anyone.  She'd given pagers out to other patrons but we never received one.  She actually started to seat another large party that came in after us before us and then seen we were still in the waiting area.    It makes one want to spend their money else where when you see  more than 50 people seated before you that came in after you.  Be prepared to wait an hour to be seated. Looking past that we'd recommend Cheesecake as a decent place to eat."
Laura N.,"Vancouver, WA",0,7,2,1.0,7/10/2014,Worst service I have ever received.  It took forever for someone to seat is in an empty restaurant. Our server disappeared for the majority of our stay so I had to get up and find to go boxes at the cheesecake counter. Also asked for a side of ranch that never made it. Drinks were never checked and stayed empty for the entire second half of the evening. AVOID this shithole.
Stacia M.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,,1.0,2/5/2016,"So disappointing! Had a cheeseburger for Saturday lunch and it was awful. Sourdough bread too crunchy as a ""bun"", cheese not melted, a sad tomato slice but no lettuce or anything else. Just bad. My husband enjoyed his lunch but after $80 (for lunch!?!!) I walked out hungry. Ridiculous."
Akshay S.,"Issaquah, WA",95,29,54,4.0,11/14/2013,"Well its a cheesecake factory! The cheesecakes are hands down winner. Their complimentary wheat bread is one of its kind.  I am not a big fan of their food, I have observed their mexican food is better than any other entree offerings. Chicken enchiladas are my favorite. Appetizers are good! Crispy crab bites, chicken samosas, tex-mex egg rolls top my favorite list."
Leslie W.,"Seattle, WA",0,28,1,5.0,5/14/2013,"We were at a conference at the Convention Center across the street and stopped in for lunch.  We showed up right at the peak of lunch hour and the front was pretty full of people waiting for tables, so we were fully expecting that lunch was going to take us a while.  The hostess informed us that there was open seating in the bar area if we saw any open tables.  There were quite a few, so we picked one and sat down.  Within a few minutes, all of the 7 tables that were empty in the bar area when we sat down were full, meaning our waiter would be slammed.   Nonetheless, our service was exceptional.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  He kept our iced teas nice and full and we didn't have to wait long to order, and our food came out in quickly as well.  We were so satisfied that we returned the next day, and received equally exceptional service.  Our iced teas NEVER got less than half full.   On the third day, we didn't sit in the bar area, and our service wasn't as amazing, but definitely not bad by any means.  I think maybe we just got spoiled by our first two expereinces. Now let's talk about the food.  On all 3 days, we got different food items and we were not disappointed with any of them.  Definitely ""comfort food""  aka probably not very healthy but oh so yummy."
Jered L.,"Leavenworth, KS",77,45,28,4.0,9/23/2012,Do not waste your time with the Skinnylicious menu!  If you have weight issues you should steer clear from the factory.  Everything else on the menu is spectacular.   Enjoy!
Stacy J.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,37,4,2.0,1/20/2015,"I came into this location to order food to go to the movie theater.  I was directed by the nice host to visit the dessert bar to make an order. The wait wasn't long to get to the front. I went there for the Tex Mex egg rolls as they are to die for but when I ordered them they were out. I hate when a large restaurant runs out of things...makes me feel like they aren't doing their inventory often enough. The cashier then suggested the Avocado Egg rolls...ok...but then she told me those were also sold out. I ended up ordering a chicken quesadilla, fire cracker shrimp, and a piece of raspberry truffle cheesecake with no whipped cream. The order came up pretty quickly but when I got to the theater to eat... the cheesecake was smothered in whipped cream. It's annoying. I know they're busy...but they need to more put together...especially on a Friday night."
Shekinah S.,"Saint Paul, MN",212,789,283,3.0,7/14/2010,"So I find The Cheesecake Factory somewhat amusing. The decor is just plain ridiculous. I fail to see the connection between towering ceilings, huge pillars, vaguely Greco-Roman paintings and overpriced American comfort food at a chain restaurant. It kinda reminds me of Vegas.The menu is also ridiculous. Literally a spiral bound book, though if you took out all the ads it would be half the size. The portions -- also laughably massive. If you don't leave here with leftovers you've got a problem. The menu is schizophrenic as well, featuring items from all over the world. I'm sorry, but you just can't do pizza and tacos and pad thai and seafood right all in one place. That being said, I've never had anything terrible at CCF. Not memorable -- except the grease and huge portions -- but nothing I hated.  The service and the wait can vary. I've had OK/good service, and also slow, annoying servers. I've been seated as soon as I walked in, but other times seen a crowd waiting outside. The Cheesecake Factory is huge and always busy, so it's a gamble if you will be waiting for a table or not. Your server will probably be working too many tables, but it doesn't really matter since this is one of those places where you get served by like ten different people over the course of the meal. I'd never suggest eating here, but once every year or two I end up at CCF with a work group or something like that and it's OK with me.  I think this place could satisfy kids and picky or unadventurous eaters.  I don't understand why tourists would go here though since you can find CCF anywhere.  I've never tried the cheesecake because I think cheesecake is gross."
Taylor G.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/9/2016,"I am extremely disappointed with the service of this restaurant. After arriving for lunch with my Mother, and Brother, we were ushered over to a nearby table after approximately 20 minutes of a wait. Though the server was prompt in taking our order, and delivering our food, we found that our dishes were especially salty. After speaking with the manager about the mistake, there was no bill modification. That's right, full price. I will not be visiting this 1 star s***hole again."
Susie S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",37,158,36,5.0,7/11/2012,"As a Canadian, I am slightly ashamed to announce that I learned of the existence of this restaurant franchise from the popular sitcom, The Big Bang Theory. I am, however, very glad I investigated. Around 8 on a Saturday, we had to wait for around 30 minutes. Once we got inside, we were taken care of right away, and once we ordered dinner it arrived about 5 minutes after our drinks! That is what I call premium service (unfortunately I can't remember our waiter's name). It is an absolute waste to come eat here and not get cheesecake, but obviously it's very filling. I'd recommend sharing a factory dinner (it's basically a 1.5 dinner - one side with 2 half entrees) with someone and then get your own slice of cheesecake - it ends up being about the same as having a whole meal. I had the Dutch Apple Streusel Cheesecake. Delicious, but whatever you choose will probably be amazing."
Jaime Y.,"Seattle, WA",3,105,,2.0,12/9/2015,"Well. It's basically become a Denny's. I noticed tonight with a friend of mine (we caught their happy hour) that their cheesecake slices had been reduced a bit a in size, and it seemed the portions weren't very big. I'm not sure if we'll be back or not.  I also really didn't like the service we received either."
Jason H.,"Seattle, WA",1,18,11,4.0,2/13/2014,"I mean, My God.  So good:  we jay stopped in for desert and the servings are so big it is hard not to be impressed (and I'm a guy!!). I had the chocolate fudge cake...took three days to take that bad boy down.  Between is, there was a strawberry, a red velvet and a chocolate cake.  All delicious.  If you are downtown (or anywhere with a Cheesecake Factory) stop in for some desert...it's hard to imagine you won't smile a little bit!!"
Rose K.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,6,,5.0,7/19/2014,"Let me tell you about the best service I've had IN MY LIFE.  How good was it? I went in April and I STILL remember her name.  Lauren was the hit of night when we went to go to the cheesecake factory in Seattle. We normally go each time we go for our convention and it's so conveniently located right next to the convention centre, that we always end up going. The food is always pretty good, but oh man, they've won me over forever just for going back just for that service, I can't even explain it. Loren was so funny, kind, and talked to us like we were people, not just a stiff robotic server that we normally get.  Got the Pasta Da Vinci, so good.  Ended with a HUGE slice of some kinda peanut butter cup cheesecake and that was even better, and I don't even like cheesecake. Will be back next time I'm in the Seattle area."
Michelle M.,"Tacoma, WA",1,11,,4.0,7/19/2014,"Two words: Buffalo Blasts! Best stuff ever!  I also had the pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. It was so good. I even had enough go take home for dinner later. They have huge portions (I had almost a gallon of strawberry lemonade!) and excellent service. The only drawback is that the closest one to my house is forty minutes away. Also, you would think the food would not be that good since their menu is so huge (only slightly smaller than 'War and Peace'!), but it is delicious!  I definitely will go back, though and also highly recommend it."
Savitri N.,"Kirkland, WA",98,20,113,5.0,9/16/2012,"I rarely go here for the cheesecakes. My visit is mainly triggered by my cravings for: 1. THE COMPLIMENTARY BROWN BREAD. Oh my. The sweet brown bread and the butter make a good start! I always have to resist myself from eating too much of it. 2. MISO SALMON OVER RICE. The salmon's texture is perfect, but I'm more impressed with the sauce. Can I just say for the record that the sauce is soooo heavenly-creamy-groovy? I can't find a perfect adjective to describe the taste, so my attempt to hyphenate these words ain't enough to justify my experience. Y'all need to go and taste it for yourself. And of course, being Asian, the fact that the miso salmon comes with RICE completes it all! 3. CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA. This is an interesting marriage between Italian and Southern flavors. The peppery spicy cajun sauce is very distinctive and rich. I usually can't take a lot of spicy food, but the spiciness level is balanced. Been to Cheesecake Factory a few times, and never once have I gotten an inattentive service. I'm definitely a fan!"
Paul S.,"Campbell, CA",413,28,,4.0,4/7/2014,"This place gets 4 stars because of chad. Its the chad. Chad is the man. He is the best waiter ever. Look, you know what you're getting when you come to the cheesecake factory. But its waiters like chad that make it awesome. I am coming back because of the Chad."
Grindy S.,"Tacoma, WA",0,267,11,4.0,12/28/2014,"Large portions, wide selection, friendly staff. You can't go wrong here. Even the light lunch options will get you good-sized portions."
Jacklyn-Kate C.,"Lynnwood, WA",353,117,246,4.0,3/14/2014,"3 words: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. and some more words:  service is always great and every dish I have tried at the Cheesecake Factory were great! They are always so busy - I'm always here when the wait time is more than 15 mins.  But once you get seated, situated and had that first bite from your dish... You'll see why a lot of people come here!!"
Vicki K.,"Farmington, MN",22,17,12,5.0,7/6/2014,"We were here on July 4th,2014, Rami was our waiter and he is fabulous!  Wonderful sense of humor, great recommendations!  Try the J W Pink Lemonade(alcohol ). Tasty!  I had the southwest chicken sandwich, loved it and my hubby had the chowder and fish and chips.   He said the chowder was better than the chowder at the Bell Street Diner.   When we go back to Seattle, we will be back!"
Steven C.,"Tacoma, WA",5,8,1,5.0,11/24/2014,This is a great place to go out and eat! Our server was great and continually checked up with us and cracked lots of jokes throughout the entire meal. I really enjoy the selection and variety of their menu. And the caramel apple streusel cheesecake was the best part!
