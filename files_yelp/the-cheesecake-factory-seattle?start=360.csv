Henry K.,"Seattle, WA",4,32,9,2.0,10/11/2013,"Went here to celebrate a special anniversary.   We got our seat in less then few minutes and things seemed going good.   But then things went a bit downhill from here.   Ordered an alcoholic drink to celebrate but told me they ran out.  (Didn't know they ran out as I assume a big chain like this would have plenty) Didn't mind so skipped the drink and ordered our meals.  After waiting about 30 minutes server tells me that he forgot to put our order in, and told us to wait a bit longer.   Got a free soup while waiting, which was nice.   Finally our meal came out, but now filling our empty stomach with free bread and the soup we weren't that hungry and ended up takin majority of the meals to go.   One more thing... Got our check, paid but realized the server short changed me.  Glad I checked and notified the server who gave me the correct change afterward.   The whole dinner night here wasn't what I expected but in the beginning the server told me he was new and was very apologetic to us throughout, which I understood but still...."
Corinne M.,"Tacoma, WA",488,532,119,4.0,11/22/2012,"The star rating is mostly on the cheesecake itself. I love love love their cheesecake. I live closer to the Southcenter  location, so we don't frequent this one often, and usually when we do, they are way too busy to seat us.  Apparently they are not too keen on people ""sitting down"" to eat just cheesecake. I know that our server works hard all night for good tips, but we will be in and out, and I should not have to eat my cheesecake outside with my 8 year old son. Regardless, you could tell that the server was not too happy to take a small order, yet he still treated us very good, so kudo's to him. I'd also like to note, that I don't like soda, and neither do my kids, so when we order water with out meals, or desserts, please  do not assume that we are ordering water to be cheap, and that it does not mean that we are cheep tippers, impress me, and I'll take good care of the tip.  Everyone who I dealt with personally tonight was really nice, however, there was this one guy, who really set off a a bad vibe. In a mocking tone, he was talking poorly about another customer, talking about how they wanted their food right now, he was negative, and drama filled, I go out to get away from all of that, so please keep your bad mood to yourself, it just made me feel uncomfortable, and put me in a bad mood, yeah I think that I'll pass on that, hoping for a better visit next time."
Nash S.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,4.0,1/24/2015,"Not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory but it is a lot better than the Applebee's, Olive Garden and TGIF kind of chains.  Wait time isn't too long.  Service is a hit or miss.  I like their huge portions and variety of cheesecakes."
Hong N.,"Pierce, WA",2,34,39,4.0,10/7/2012,"I must admit that I love the Cheesecake Factory's food, but unfortunately my waistline doesn't. Thankfully, we do not live too close to one so our visits occur during our visits to Seattle. When it comes to eating out, I am very much a creature of habit. If i like a particular dish, that is what I will order every time I go there. I am very reluctant with changing up my entree choices. However, at Cheesecake Factory, I have several go to dishes! For appetizers, we usually do the Thai lettuce wrap or the Tex-Mex Eggrolls. The Thai lettuce wrap is sooooo good as well as quite healthy. The chicken is grilled and everything else is fresh (bean sprout, carrots, cucumber, lettuce, and rice noodles). You get to put together your own wrap and then choose to dip it in one of three sauces included: Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. All three sauces have their own unique, yet tasty flavor so I usually dip one wrap in each sauce. The Tex-Mex eggrolls on the other hand, is not so healthy, but still super good. They do have a kick to it, but not what I would consider spicy. As far as entrees, I love the Steak Diane! It comes with mash potatoes, but we usually add a side of veggies to it. The steak strips are always cooked to our liking and very tender. The mushroom wine sauce is rich, but not overwhelming. I have also had the Grilled Salmon which was nice and flaky and well seasoned.  I must admit I am not a big dessert person, but when I do get dessert, the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake is my best friend!  I have also tried their Carrot Cake, but found the icing to be too sweet for my liking, although the cake itself was quite good. My husband is a huge cheesecake fan and every cheesecake he has tried, he has loved! Pricing is fair, particularly since you get quite the allotment of food for what you pay for, not to mention, VERY GOOD food! My husband and I tend to share an appetizer and entree when we go. The wait staff has always been very attentive, but the only downfall is they don't take reservations which is inconvenient when you try to go with a group or trying to reserve for a special occasion."
Samantha L.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,45,12,5.0,9/21/2014,"Daniel & Chaily the bartendere are awesome. I came in, they acknowledged me and served my drink before I even sat down."
Laura F.,"Marysville, WA",7,7,1,5.0,7/22/2014,"This is what customer service should be like everywhere...  My husband and I got these AMAZING fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer that we get every time I highly recommend, then of course they bring the delicious bread out. So I have to stop eating or I won't eat the Lemon crusted salmon and steak I ordered. I ate all the steak it was pretty good but I didn't care for the salmon at all, I took one bite and that was it. Our waitress asks if she can take my plate I tell her oh yes please. She sees I didn't touch my salmon and asked if I didn't like it, I told her I didn't care for it but it was okay. She asks if I got enough food, if she could get me anything else. I tell her oh no... It's okay, I'm fine, I'm stuffed trust me! No worries. She goes on her way, next thing I know the manager is at the table apologizing for the salmon, I told her oh no it's fine, I tried something new I didn't care for it, it's okay I'm full. I wasn't complaining about my meal what so ever but they were clearly concerned. I told her I was totally fine not to worry. Next thing I know My husband is paying the bill, and they took $10 off my $20 plate!!! My husband and I were shocked. My husband says you never complained about the food. Let's just say our waitress got a big tip tonight we put the $10 back on top of her tip.  This is customer service at its finest, they were trying to right something that we felt wasn't even wrong in our eyes!! AMAZING JOB Cheese Cake Factory!!!"
Steve P.,"Seattle, WA",7,61,57,4.0,7/23/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory's specialty is in its name- the cheesecake.  The chain has a lot going for it.  It has a huge menu (maybe too huge for the decision-impaired) and a wide variety of foods.  The waiters and waitresses I have found to be very pleasant, engaging and willing to answer questions.  The portions are gigantic, so there is plenty to take home.   The inside is crazy and ostentatious, like something you would see in Vegas.  If you look at the calories, you may have a heart attack without even taking a bite.  Cheesecake Factory is a great splurge- its not particularly cheap on the wallet or the diet.  The menu is packed with ads, which is either slightly annoying or an amusement depending on your type of person.   The quality of the food is good.  They do a number of dishes well, but not outstandingly.  Their strength is the variety of cheesecakes they provide, and the patience and attentiveness of the wait staff."
Daren D.,"Seattle, WA",684,1691,1042,4.0,5/26/2012,"I forgot they have such awesome bread! I prefer the dark bread over the sourdough so perhaps one can make a preference? Perched up at the bar prior to Marc's UYBC for some nibbles - as in some chicken samosas, the bread and a M&J's. In other news, I was watching the bartender make some sort of spiked shake with crushed mini pretzels. Interesting."
Kimberly P.,"Vancouver, Canada",24,284,48,2.0,8/28/2012,"When will American restaurants realize that more doesn't necessarily mean better? The copious amount of food I received was a bit off-putting, I mean who needs that much food at one sitting? My tostado salad was okay, the sangria was watery and the floors were dirty. Why not 1 star only then? Well, the flour-less Lady Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake was good, I mean really good. My suggestion? Don't eat a meal here, grab some cheesecake to go!"
Nikki I.,"San Francisco, CA",248,335,1255,4.0,2/23/2009,Great location! Great food! Great experience! The fried macaroni and cheese was amazing.  This chain really needs to reconsider their lighting scheme...too dark!
Yingsu H.,"Seattle, WA",146,3,,3.0,10/23/2014,The servers were really nice but the pasta da Vinci I ordered had too much sause... but other pasta is good
Karen D.,"Renton, WA",53,347,,4.0,2/1/2013,"This is the favorite lunch location of most of my co-workers for birthday lunches, so, I eat here about 4 times per year, at least.  In the past, I thought it was just ""ok"".  I've tried many of the menu items, and I thought they were average at best.  But things seem to have changed recently at Cheesecake Factory.  We went there for a birthday lunch a couple of weeks ago, and it was much better than in times past.  Why?  Well, for one thing, I noticed that they updated their plating to a more modern style.  The food really looks more appetizing, and well, the old saying ""you eat with your eyes first"".  I was especially jealous of my co-workers who ordered the salmon entree, because the plates were downright beautiful.  Same thing with the Asian chicken salad, it was very dramatic-looking, lovely.  I ordered my old stand-by, which is the personal pizza and salad lunch, and it was delicious.  Though I will say that I wish they still put grated beets and grated carrots into their salads; they have stopped doing that; and it was a unique touch that I always enjoyed.  But the balsamic dressing was delcious, as was my caprese-style pizza.   We all ordered cheesecake slices for dessert and tasted each others' choices...I thought the 30-year anniversary signature Hersheys one that I ordered was just meh.  However the key lime and the tiramisu versions that I tasted were fab.  I would definitely order the tiramisu cheesecake in the future, and I'm picky about tiramisu. Service was also right-on, even better than it's usual ""good"".  I'm sure we'll be back soon, celebrating someone else's birthday, and I'm actually looking forward to it now!"
Krista E.,"Sunland Park, NM",10,67,,4.0,3/31/2014,"Ate here while I was in town for Emerald City Comic Con, and YUM! Their Buffalo Wing Burger was amazing, as was the Reece's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. Would visit again, for sure, despite the wait!"
Nikki F.,"Chicago, IL",59,40,1,4.0,9/17/2014,Great service! The restaurant was packed but the noise level was mild on comparison and we received our food and drinks incredibly fast! The jambalaya was large enough to split between myself and a friend. The dish had lots of spice and flavor with a mild hotness. I'd say its pretty good!
Trang N.,"Belltown, Seattle, WA",5,1,,3.0,3/29/2014,"As I thought, giving one star is not fair, the food is great, I love the environment, BUT the waiter named JV or whatever is one of the rudest person ever, it seems like he doesn't love his work at all. One time we have a party of 3, and shared 4 lunch dishes together, when we done order he said ""that is a lot of food for 3 of you!"" Rude omg, I mean we order what we want, not any of his business. I love the restaurant but I just hate that waiter"
Brian D.,"Hinesburg, VT",0,83,1,4.0,6/26/2013,"Never been to one of these before and when our friends suggested meeting there my wife said ""oh god, please""! Well, she ended up saying that her meal was one of the best pasta dishes she'd ever had. I had the carbonara and a caesar salad which were both pretty much perfect. We all split a massive, $7.95 piece of caramel, chocolate nut cheesecake with whipped cream which was so good, I had to overeat!  I can only imagine what it takes to pull off the menu in this place based on the size and the seating. They know how to do it! High regards for this restaurant."
Carla R.,"Dunn, NC",40,238,782,4.0,5/30/2014,I have to say I am not a fan of Cheesecake Factory . I went in here this evening to get a slice of cheesecake for someone . The people in there were very nice and it was clean in there from what I saw. I really cannot comment on food or service beyond that . I would absolutely go try it if you have never been or if you are a Cheesecake Factory fan because this one seems nicer than some that I have been to.
Jenn P.,"New Westminster, Canada",2,38,1,4.0,9/5/2012,"My husband and I kind of have a ""Cheesecake Factory tradition"" every time we come to Seattle for PAX (a summer gaming convention). This year we kept up with it! For purposes of weekend dining, especially when there's a big event going on, we decided to eat early so there wouldn't be a huge wait. Lucky we did because it was a 30-minute wait when we went in at only 5:15! Not really surprising so we were prepared for that. Our waiter was fantastic, especially since it was pretty busy there. Very friendly, and apparently he had tried to go to the very convention we were at but was stuck working, so he was a kindred spirit of sorts, ha. Very knowledgeable about the menu and even warned me one of the drinks I ordered ran SUPER sweet. I appreciated that since that could have been disastrous if I didn't like sweet things! The food itself this time around was good. The portions were just right for me coming in there very hungry, and both my husband and I left super full from delicious menu choices! We even ordered some cheesecake to go to have some fabulous dessert to snack on later on that night. Another great experience yet again, and we'll be returning next year!"
Steven L.,"Everett, WA",0,10,,3.0,12/5/2015,"The food was good. The service was fine, except for the wait to be seated. People in our party arrived at 5:00 pm but it was 6:45 pm before the party was seated. There were 16-17 in our party and seating was refused until everyone had arrived. We had a couple arrive late due to traffic. It turned into a long wait for the rest of us."
Nancy S.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,43,,5.0,5/9/2015,I had dinner there one evening. The food and service was great. They served the best bleu cheese salad dressing I have ever had. Would definitely eat there again and whole heartedly recommend it.
