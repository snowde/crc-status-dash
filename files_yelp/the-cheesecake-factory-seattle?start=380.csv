Krystal A.,"Bremerton, WA",84,27,26,4.0,10/18/2012,"We came to the cheese cake factory as our final dinner before deployment. My one friend ordered the filet mignon. It was very tender, lightly spiced and very juicy. As a side, she had the mashed potatoes, which had a good layered taste. Also, the rockin' rocky road shake tasted good and the liquor was strong. One and she was done.  My other friend had the salmon with Diana steak. The potatoes were tender and fluffy and presented a lot of flavor. The sauce was a little bit strong on the steak, but overall the steak was good and tender. The salmon on the other hand was a little dry and had too much cream sauce. Less tasty than expected.  The buffalo blasts, when they arrived on the table were not at all what we were expecting. They looked like a piece of fried chicken, but on first bite, we realized they were a sort of buffalo chicken pastry. As for the flavor, it was excellent. It was like Emeril's ""bam""! It took buffalo chicken to a new level. Get some for appetizers and then get some to go.  I ordered the Mac and cheese burger. I can't say the burger was great nor bad for when I bit into the burger, it left me in a state of confusion. The favors didn't pop, but blended together. All of us had different opinions on trying it, so this may be something you need to judge for yourself. The fries were awesome.  As a side note, when it comes to the service, it's either good or it's  not. It's the cheese cake factory: you love it and then you hate yourself later."
Akvile H.,"Paso Robles, CA",602,621,495,4.0,12/3/2010,"I enjoy an occasional trip to the Cheesecake Factory because I have a huuuuge sweet tooth! Not only is Cheesecake one of my favorite treats, but they also have AMAZING tiramisu..my oh my! It's oOh soO good! The place is usually always packed, so try to avoid it weekend evenings but the food is good, servers have always been friendly, and the prices are alright, but a bit on the more expensive side. For a huge chain restaurant, it's really good and I haven't had anything bad off of the menu, but yet again, their menu is massive, it's like a book, full of advertisements, lol, so I can say that the small fraction of food I have tried, it has been good. I recommend it if you haven't been before or want to try some amazing desserts! Try and save some room after dinner for them or share with a friend! Good portion sizes."
Kelly J.,"Lynnwood, WA",27,28,26,4.0,2/25/2013,"Okay, this is the  first time I sat at the bar. WOW I'm sold. I had always had a good experience here with the service and food except the long dreadful wait. But at the bar, no wait, same menu, friendly funny chatty bartender, why not?"
Yulong T.,"Seattle, WA",3,11,,5.0,11/9/2014,"Heads up before you come here: It's a REALLY busy place, so make sure you're willing to wait at least an hour to be seated. The lighting and colors inside are incredibly relaxing. It's a really nice place to take a date or go to celebrate a friend's birthday. The waiters are all really nice and INCREDIBLY friendly. They make sure you feel very welcome and will do whatever it takes to satisfy you. The food was very good as well. I had a Chicken Bellagio, and everything about the dish was amazing! I couldn't actually finish it, as it was too much for me but it was nice sitting in there chatting with my friends."
Taylor W.,"Tukwila, WA",6,4,,5.0,9/29/2014,"Amazing service! We've gone there multiple times after work. My friend had called earlier in the evening, she had left her card at home and wanted to know if there was any possible way they could take her card number with her drivers license. They said yes, which surprised us. When the time came to pay for our meals, she gave them said card number and was informed that they couldn't accept that. However, the manager said since she had been misinformed he would pay for her meal! Love seeing customer service at its finest. We will definitely be spending a lot of time here!"
Alison V.,"Albany, NY",316,793,336,4.0,12/7/2009,"So this is obviously a chain.  However, it's one of my favorite chain restaurants to go to.  The service I receive here is usually pretty great.   To start, I love the bread I get while waiting.  They never seem to mind bringing me a second basket which is good since sometimes the wait can be quite long.  The menu is expansive and I can always find something I'm in the mood for.  Usually the real problem is limiting my options.  However, the pasta da vinci is one of my favorites.  Also, the cheesecake options are great and perfect for someone like me who isn't a big fan of ""plain"" cheesecake. So what makes this Cheesecake Factory different?  A few things.  First, the wait.  You're almost always in for a long wait during any sort of peak time.  Luckily there are some interesting characters on the sidewalk out in front usually which can provide entertainment should you require.  Second, the service.  I've been here on numerous occasions and almost always had a server who was extremely attentive each time.  The one time a friend and I ended up waiting what seemed too long for our meal, a manager overheard us talking about how long it had been and gave us each a free slice of cheesecake without us even complaining.  Lastly, the location.  It's a good place downtown and when you have a group of out-of-towners who want food they're familiar with or they're chain restaurant type folks this is a pretty good place to go."
Kayla H.,"Seattle, WA",201,767,129,4.0,1/23/2012,"I don't know what is not to love about this place. If you can't decide as a family where you want to go for dinner, or what you are in the mood for, this is the place I go because they have EVERYTHING!!  Or server was a nice guy, and he was really attentive to our needs which was nice.  And of course because we came here I had to take a piece of my favorite GODIVA CHEESECAKE because it is simply to die for (especially with a glass of red wine!)"
Debbie H.,"Gretna, NE",90,415,17,4.0,10/2/2012,"Took my daughter in law here for her birthday (at her request).  She had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta while I opted for the Chicken Marsalla and my son went for the Herb Encrusted Salmon, Shrimp & Mashed Potato.  Everything was delicious but the portions were huge (we took half of each meal home) and I really couldn't believe the calorie counts.  Wow!!!!  It was good - just not 100% sure it was THAT good.  While my son went for the apple crisp and ice cream, the girls had cheesecake.  I really wanted the Pumpkin one I saw on my menu but when I ordered it, I was told it was not yet available.  My second choice was the Vanilla Bean and I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed with it.  Ash's white chocolate raspberry truffle WAS good."
Ayona D.,"Seattle, WA",5,19,15,3.0,7/13/2012,"My daughter and I were downtown shopping when we decided to hop in for dinner before heading home. My last Cheesecake venture was back in Cincy so I was curious if the seattle store would compare nicely.  Very clean and cozy. Had the same ambient feeling as the rest of the store but the constant traffic, foot and vehicle, that we watched out the windows seem to take something from the experience. The food was excellent but our waiter, while accommodating, took too long to see to our needs even though the place was far from full. This is about as much energy I want to give to an review about a chain restaurant."
Nicole C.,"Arlington, WA",9,6,,1.0,3/2/2014,My boyfriend and I went there for a date and we were extremely disappointed. The waitress helped everyone in her section before us. The table beside us sat down after us and had their drink & food order taken before we had even received water! The waitress was extremely demeaning. We got the vibe that she though we were stupid young teenagers. We are actually both in our 20s and very well off. We went just for the dessert and we were so upset and offended we didn't order any. Very rarely do we not leave a tip but unfortunately this was one of those occasions and we will never go back to this location.
Sarah L.,"Seattle, WA",33,86,35,3.0,10/5/2012,"As my coworkers and I stuffed our faces at lunch today, my boss mentioned that the Cheesecake Factory had two of the top five fattiest entrees among restaurants across the country.  I'm fairly certain mine was one of them.  ;)  And don't even get me started on the dessert! The Cheesecake Factory actually has really good comfort food.  Many different options for different tastes, so there's a little something for everyone.  It's a chain restaurant, so it's just like all the other CFs across the country, and it's almost always busy.  The portions are HUGE, so it's guaranteed that you'll never leave hungry.  I used to order a chicken appetizer as a meal and would still be stuffed. A-okay is my vote.  Nothing super special, but everyone will walk out satiated, that's for sure."
Shierly M.,"Providence, RI",0,31,1,4.0,3/17/2013,"I think I have always been a big fan of the factory. For a long time, I went with the Shrimp and Angel Hair pasta because it was always fresh and light. Today, I tried out the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and shared the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake. Definitely coming back for the cheesecake (as always!) though I wished the Jambalaya would have been spicier and more savory. The pasta definitely did not feel like it connected with the sauce as well as it could have.  Nonetheless, I will always be back in the Cheesecake Factory! Always a good pick when you have no idea what you want to eat! Best for lunch, as portions are more manageable and it is cheaper!"
Manolito Daniel M.,"Seattle, WA",22,10,20,1.0,1/12/2014,"What I submitted to the website via comments:  ""My partner and I went to cheesecake factory for the 1st time yesterday.  Our experience in just over ten minutes:  Upon entering we were quickly taken to a booth toward the rear of the restaurant. On the way we were lead up a long narrow walkway where a congregation of employees, mostly management, stood in a cluster and blocked the way, we literally had to squeeze by them.  No one even bothered to try moving.  After being seated we perused the menu. Overwhelming at best, the menu was much too long, had advertisements on each page, was dirty, too many options frankly and yes, that's a bad thing.  One couldn't tell what you specialized in aside from cheesecake.  While reading our novel, our server presented us with water glasses, really just extremely battered plastic mugs.  I noticed the rim was dirty so I used my napkin to wipe it and was left with smudges of large brown and distinct lipstick red.  Now, appetite on the brink of ruined, I would need a new glass and napkin, even before finishing the menu!  Bad dishwasher?  Why didn't the server notice before serving me with it?  He took so long to come back (who could blame him considering the size of the menu) I couldn't get a replacement.  The lights began to adjust, I assume for lunch to dinner transition, and over the course of 20 seconds got much brighter then darker and darker and darker... darker than we'd started.  By the time the bar erupted in cheers for the football game being broadcast in there we were pretty much done.  We decided to leave.   We never even got to the last pages of our menu. UPDATE 2/15/14 I received a call from corporate as well as a $20 gift card to try them again, at least the desserts if we chose.  I am still concerned with cleanliness but will certainly consider trying the dessert case sometime."
John G.,"Lafayette, CA",813,843,87,4.0,11/16/2011,One of the better of the chain I have ever visited. Nice ultra-modern design.  Entered for lunch and was seated promptly. Was visiting Seattle attending a convention and this location is only one block from the convention center.  We both ordered salads.  I had the cobb while my colleague had the vegetable. My salad was very good.  Crisp and tasty with generous sprinkled blue cheese.  Yum.  Recommended for all to check out.
Matthew B.,"Royal Oak, MI",317,388,17,1.0,8/1/2011,"I only come here when there's an event. It's hard for me to come up with a positive for Cheesecake Factory. Nutrition: Consistently worst dishes in the country (most over 1,500 calories each.) Service: We came for a birthday dinner, and were bringing a group. They STILL will not take a reservation. One person even arrived 1.5 hours early to ensure we were first on the list... we still had an hour wait for a table. Quality of food: This can best be described as ""meh."" They have so many options, yet they don't exceed your expectations in any of them. Even the cheesecake is simply a slice of lard and sugar. There are many, many better options through the city."
Piglet Y.,"Penticton, Canada",0,6,,3.0,8/30/2014,"I wouldn't say that Cheesecake factory offers the best cheese cake I ever had, The cheese cake are generally good, I actually like its' environment and overall setup more and will show it to my mom when I go back again this labour's day ;)"
Ross M.,"Seattle, WA",334,34,,3.0,2/5/2012,"The entree I ordered (Caramel Chicken) was the smallest I have ever received at Cheesecake.  The bread was not fresh. My major complaint is that the wait staff and bartenders are not friendly.  Customers are an intrusion on their visiting time with each other: talking about the Super Bowl, shopping, etc.  Even their manager was spending her time chatting with the waiters - who were all watching and betting on the Super Bowl.  I'm sorry I was wasting their time.  Next time I won't tip 20%!"
Katinka R.,"Lynnwood, WA",8,173,,4.0,5/8/2014,"I brought my daughter and her friend here for lunch during their spring break. The Seattle Center Armory was holding their annual Whirligig bounce house festival. After bouncing a bit, we took the monorail over to Westlake mall and walked a couple of blocks to the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated almost immediately. Our waiter was awesome with the girls, funny and charming. They have awesome lunch deals... and the portions are still crazy-big. I had the soup and salad. The girls had sliders and chicken strips. Everyone was happy and full. The bill was under $40 with a tip and a piece of cheesecake to take home to Dad."
Jonathan S.,"Sunnyside, WA",0,15,,5.0,8/11/2014,Very clean although if you love good food then you will love the cheesecake factory the only problem was that we had  a 45 minute wait but still the food made up for it and I do recommend the Alfredo
Matthew R.,"Winter Springs, Orlando, FL",31,36,20,4.0,5/31/2014,"Got some good tai lettuce wraps, beef kabobs and buffalo wings. The food was pretty good. It took a little bit to get our food but they kept our drinks full and bathrooms clean. The mango key lime and lemon raspberry cheesecakes were very good."
