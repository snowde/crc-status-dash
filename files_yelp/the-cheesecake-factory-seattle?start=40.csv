Camila B.,"Evanston, IL",0,2,,2.0,8/4/2017,"I really like the food! Is one of my favorite restaurants if you want a good food and fair price. However, my last experience was not good.  We order for delivery through Doordash and when I opened my food ( combination stake diane and shrimp) both sauces were mixed.  the fault wasn't the delivery guy  but the one who set the place.  Conclusion: I ate mixed sauce, and didn't taste good. If you want eat the cheesecake factory food go to the restaurant."
Kelly G.,"Cabot, AR",6,28,,4.0,10/11/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a win in my book. I hate to go to a national chain when I travel, but since we don't have Cheesecake Factory in Arkansas, I couldn't resist. I had the skinnylicious steak medallions, and they were delicious! The lower-calorie entree made me feel less guilty about indulging in some carrot cake cheesecake--YUM!!!"
Michelle B.,"Enumclaw, WA",14,113,231,4.0,4/4/2017,"EXCELLENT service with our large group today at The Cheesecake Factory!  The service was spot on with our extra large group today.  We went in to celebrate a co-worker and the service was incredible.  We didn't have to wait too long for drink orders,  then meal orders. The food came out hot and in the order it was taken.  It seemed pretty organized to us. The food was good. I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad. The dressing was super good with great flavor. The chicken was a little dry and slightly overcooked but all in all was pretty good. With our large group we half expected them to balk at the idea of separate checks and add the tip to our bill. They not only gave us separate checks they didn't add on the tips at the end. Hopefully our crew rewarded the service because it was a great experience and impressive.  The wait staff was friendly,  attentive and professional.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Poornima B.,"Seattle, WA",65,116,307,4.0,11/8/2016,"I toook a to go from cheese cake factory over the last weekend. Our order consisted of Biscuits and gravy and an Egg roll sampler. First of all I would like to mention how big their portion size. Thank goodness we had decided to split it.  I loved the gravy , the biscuits were fluffy . The gravy was a great complement to the chicken breasts. What I may not have liked is the mess of the mashed potatoes. Yes! I am aware of how mashed potatoes are done but the consistency could have differed. This was a lumpy goo . Boo! The egg roll sampler was a great buy .They had all their versions of egg rolls in here, each with different meat. I preferred the one with salmon . They serve upto four condiments with the samplers, each adding a new dimension to the flavor. All in all my husband was a fan . I am more inclined to the biscuits and gravy though. The above cost us close to 35$ +-. The service was great. We did not have to wait too long. This place is forever crowded. I had wished we could have had our meal here but there was no scope for that."
Jordan N.,"Renton, WA",71,127,165,4.0,4/1/2016,"I only eat at this location whenever it's convention season since it's conveniently located right across the street from the Washington State Convention Center... This is probably the location I eat at the most. I feel like even though there are a lot of tables to sit at, all of the locations can be busy on the weekends during peak hours, but this one will definitely be busy during convention season, and don't be surprised if you see people in costume during that time! Wait time can be more than half an hour. I love how you are first served with warm bread, I really enjoy the honey and oats bread! I usually come here around lunch and I get the Fettucine Alfredo (lunch sized). It's super cheesy but really good! I ordered a Typhoon Punch once, that was a nice blend of juice and alcohol. I even tried the Bacon-Bacon burger one time also, it was a lot bigger than I thought, I couldn't finish it, but really juicy and flavorful. There's a variety of cheesecake to choose from! Sadly most of the time I eat at any of their chains, I get too full to eat a cheesecake. I tried some though, especially some of the chocolate ones and they're really yummy! Maybe one day I should just take one to go to really enjoy it. It can be a bit pricey here and busy but worth trying. This location I probably won't go to often but will definitely come back when I'm around the area and I'm hungry, especially during a convention."
Kim E.,"Bakersfield, CA",29,27,27,5.0,7/3/2017,"Don't have a Cheesecake Factory anywhere near our home, so visiting one is always a treat! This one is in a nice downtown shopping area. And, of course, the cheesecake was delicious!"
Alan D.,"Gilbert, AZ",47,306,119,4.0,10/30/2016,"The cheesecake Factory is *really* one of the better chains out there, as fair as chains go.   You really can't go wrong with the food.   We were at a convention this weekend, and we ate here twice, and it was delicious both times.    I had the steak Diane and a Caesar salad, with a Dulce de Leche caramel cheesecake both times and enjoyed the hell out of them.      Yeah, its a chain, but its sure as hell not Dennys.     The food is good here.    I gotta give em props."
Timothy A.,"Charleston, SC",204,561,989,4.0,3/14/2017,"I have yet to find the factory where they make the cheesecakes, but I'm glad that they do.  We came here for an early dinner, and I'm glad we didn't wait, because this place filled up fairly quick in most areas.  I ordered the spicy Thai lettuce wraps, and the plate was huge with lots of various toppings to fill my lettuce with.  The chicken was grilled and seasoned nicely.  We ordered cheesecake to go, because trying to eat cheesecake after we ate our meal was going to be quite a task.  Once I got back to the hotel and rested though, the cheesecake didn't stand a chance.  My only negative was that the hostess seated another couple right next to us, and the tables were so close that they were almost on top of us, with at least seven tables lined up to the left of us that were open.  The couple didn't seem too comfortable either because their table was in a corner and they looked a little cramped.  I'm sure it had to do with who was waiting which table, but still made things a little cramped."
liza u.,"Groton, CT",0,7,1,2.0,10/7/2017,"The slider buns were incredibly greasy and the app has no real flavor. Also, I shouldn't have to look for a random waiter to ask fornketchup with my burgers. The cheesecake was ok."
John K.,"Ocala, FL",0,5,1,1.0,4/10/2017,"It was dirty, no bread offered, had a table next to me with baby crying non stop and throwing food on the floor, and no one cleaned it up, this included a fork. The waiter stepped over it, didnt make sense. There are bums stationed outside of resteraunt, I know they they can't control ""somewhat"" but food everywhere on sidewalk around bums pan handling.  I was looking forward to my meal, ordered the Sheila Avocado salad it was good, but this Cheesecake Factory wasn't like others.   Crowd packed at entrance inside waiting for tables, blocking doors. Also fire alarm went off for 10 minutes, no fire but just added to the chaos...1 star for the salad."
Amanda G.,"Tri-Cities, WA",0,27,,4.0,9/23/2017,We have been numerous times and try to beat the dinner rush when we go. We had one not so great experience however the manager comped us an appetizer without us even asking. We have eaten there subsequently and always had wonderful service and food!
Christine M.,"Anchorage, AK",9,68,229,1.0,9/1/2016,"I am a Cheesecake Factory fan! But this location had the worst customer service--from the hostess to our waiter--out of all the locations we experienced in CA, OR, DC, TX, CO, and NV! I know my Cheesecake Factory!  I'm highly disappointed because besides the delicious food, we kept coming back because the service has been great! Skip the Seattle location."
Taranjeet I.,"Seattle, WA",10,13,46,4.0,3/6/2017,"Great place and great food. Oh I would so come back again and again just for the love of cheesecakes. A fair warning though, before you savour the good food you have to wait at least for 20-30 mins to get a table. But then as they say good things come to those who wait  This is one of my favourite places to dine."
Gabe Q.,"Mililani, HI",1,56,23,1.0,8/4/2017,"First time here at this location and walked in to place a takeout order. Th host says you need to go over there, and points to the cheesecake counter. As I walk over the cashier ask do I know what I want. So ask for the menu and she points to the host stand. So i walk back and pick up a menu and walked back. Then she says ""you ready"" and I just ordered Neapolitan pasta and asked for a kids mac & cheese. She took my order and said it will take 20 mins. After when I got my order, I took it back to my hotel and was very disappointed. Pasta was over cooked and meat was charred. I ended up eating just half of it and threw the rest away. The mac and cheese was good so I ended up sharing it with my child. What a waste!"
Cherish B.,"Snoqualmie, WA",51,8,,4.0,9/23/2017,This was our first time to any Cheesecake Factory! I got shepards pie and my SO got the mac and cheese burger! We both highly recommend trying both of these items if you ever visit a Cheesecake Factory.
Hannah C.,"Seattle, WA",20,219,63,3.0,9/19/2016,"This standard CF is typical in appearance and menu, and while the food is consistent, the service is truly slow and sometimes completely inadequate.  This location is centrally located downtown near the convention center, so they are always packed! Servers are always running, trying to take care of their tables, but I have found that two people are often forgotten in the chaos. I would return for the consistently good food, but I wouldn't try to be quick with my dinner or dessert."
Judy T.,"West End, Vancouver, Canada",176,3,,3.0,9/3/2017,Just a hype about this place. Not the best entrees served. Cheesecake was fairly decent. Overall OK.
Joette H.,"Mills River, NC",1,25,2,4.0,8/5/2017,"Typical cheesecake factory restaurant... always delicious, noisy, crowded. They were out of tuna while we were there."
Lala L.,"Downtown, Portland, OR",7,7,9,4.0,6/4/2017,"Honestly very happy with this location. Had a good dinner. Good came out fast, the waiter was nice. It was a good atmosphere! The only thing was our table was very small and barely fit all our food. And we were seated so close to the table next to us it was like we were eating with them. Otherwise the food was good and it hit the spot. The side salad was pricy for just lettuce"
Tinamisu P.,"Seattle, WA",20,2,,4.0,11/12/2017,"Our waitor was very nice. I ordered Carne Asada, the meat and portion was great except it was a bit too salty."
