Deena S.,"Melbourne, FL",27,57,21,3.0,7/14/2013,"Knowing ahead that I was throwing my baby shower at the establishment and having an hour advanced notice, no action was taken. I understand that a table for 20 people is a lot, but not making Any effort on their behalf to have us seated in a timely manor is ridiculous.  I called at 2pm to give them a heads up. I was told to come early and talk to the manager, but it shouldn't be a problem. I went in about 240/245 expecting the party to show about 315 (half an hour). They told me it would take about twenty minutes, but to let them know when half of the party showed up. By 315 we had about 8people. I was told the tables weren't ready. 325 rolled around and I started just opening my baby gifts right there in the entry way. We weren't even offered a drink service. I am seven months pregnant and they were about to make a lot of money off of us.  Finally we were seated at 335. Almost a WHOLE FREAKING HOUR and they Were Not busy. I was so embarrassed that part of my family couldn't even eat with us, but had to Stand in the waiting area for a half hour. The food was good and came out in a timely fashion. The bill was kept organized with the exception of my guests being charged for their aps, which i requested be put on my bill about 3 times.  So, yeah. Avoid Sundays for large parties. And stick to the bar when possible. Great food, good drinks and nice wait staff. Front of house needs to get their S together though to make it a better experience."
Romero M.,"Seattle, WA",24,47,,5.0,9/24/2013,The oreo cheesecake is to die for! A lot of sinfully delicious food and the service is really great.  Pretty much everything is monstrously large so anything makes a good split.
Heather J.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",192,643,278,3.0,5/15/2013,"This seems to be a favorite of many people visiting downtown Seattle and often ends up being our stop off before or after and event. The menu is huge, making it hard to decide what to eat, but usually something can be found for everyone. Many people come just for the cheesecake, but the food is decent as well. It can be very crowded and service often takes longer than expected, so be forewarned if you are in a rush. I almost always end up spending more than I intend to, but I do appreciate the free bread with dinner. I'm a huge fan of sourdough and the brown bread is delicious as well which is slightly sweet. I much enjoyed my white bean hummus, but would have appreciated knowing in advance that the flatbread had parmesan on it. Grilled artichokes were tasty as well, but there is another local place whose I enjoy more. My friends Asian style tacos looked pretty tasty as well. While I don't ever actively seek this place out I don't mind eating here when others suggest it. I appreciate that it has later hours than some of the other places in the neighborhood."
Craig L.,"Anchorage, AK",0,96,1,3.0,5/11/2015,"Not fine dining but going in, you know what to expect.  Big portions, good service, a little pricey. High end of the chain restaurants.   We had a garden salad with bleu cheese dressing - it was ok.  Had an order of buffalo wings that were better than ok.  Wife had the pork chop, green beans, and sweet potato fries.  I had bang-bang chicken and shrimp which looked great and tasted good.  Big piece of towering chocolate cake for dessert - the best part.  Though on the way home (with lots of leftovers), wife said her meal wasn't served hot and I admitted mine wasn't either.  Restaurant wasn't crowded nor was our server's section full so not sure why our meals came out luke warm.  With an appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert it was certainly in the $31-$60 price range."
Yuen Tung P.,"Seattle, WA",173,123,96,1.0,7/5/2011,"Came here on Sunday 7/3 and the place was PACKED, since there was a Lion convention thing here too. Either way, the wait was about a hour, and we told the host that there would be 4 instead of 5, but they still sat us in a 6-people-table. The server/waitress Carlee was on break, so this other dude was taking over for now. Usually they'll come and ask us for drinks, and then come back and ask us what we want, but he came back after like 3 minutes wanting to know if we were ready to order. Uh no. I ask for lemon for my water, didn't get it. And after we finish our initial serving of bread, we ask for more because we love the brown wheat bread. Again, they forgot, and I had to ask them a second time for both the bread and the lemon. We ordered, it came. Calamari was good. I order the Chargrilled Steak as I've previously ordered the many times I go to cheesecake factory. Last time I went, I had ordered medium, and they told me since they grilled the steak, medium steak usually turns out to be like a medium well steak. So they suggested me to do Medium Rare since that usually turns out to be medium. So this time I order medium rare because of my past experiences. It was fine until I got to the last part of my steak. It was RED, and seem more like is undercook than anything. I don't like meat as red as that. That isn't the way it was suppose to be. I complain, and Carlee looked at me like, ""what you want me to do about it?"" Is your restaurant, is YOUR job, what are YOU suppose to do for your customers, huh?"" Manager came and offer to reheat this TINY LITTLE PIECE, I said no thanks, because I KNOW if they reheat it, is going to be WELL DONE. They were like, we do it by temperature. I don't care how you do it, all I care about is the condition of my meat.  and this girl Carlee keeps trying to rush us off. My friend was still poking at her food, and she comes and go, can i box it for you? We're not even done yet. Same thing happened to my other friend. Oh and throughout the ENTIRE dinner, they only came and fill our water ONCE, and thats AFTER I ask them to come fill our water.  We didn't leave them tips. It was the worst experience I had at Cheesecake factory, EVER."
Sonya L.,"Kent, WA",752,1280,239,2.0,5/26/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is overrated, in my opinion.  I'm really not a huge fan of this place.  I guess I don't see the point in waiting at least 30 minutes (usually much longer) for huge portions of overpriced, mediocre food.   True, the menu is filled with page after page of food options (even the pickiest person on earth could find something here), but everything I've ever eaten here has been just disappointing.  I'd rather they have less items that tasted better. I had the crab cake sandwich last time, which was okay but very dry.  Tarter sauce was supposed to accompany the sandwich, but the cup on the side of my plate instead contained honey mustard, which I never had the opportunity to swap for the appropriate sauce.  I ate the sandwich sauceless, which is likely why I found it to be so dry.  The fries were fairly good (with the addition of plenty of salt), but that's about it.  The price of around $14 seemed a bit high to me, but that's probably because I was so disappointed. The cheesecake here is fine.  I've never been disappointed, though I haven't eaten it very many times.  I do like that they have lots of choices of cheesecake, although that makes it harder to choose which to eat! Overall, I don't ever come here unless someone else suggests it or my group of friends is going here.  It's just not a place I seek out."
Manasa N.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,4.0,7/9/2014,"I love this place. We ordered bbq salmon dish,baja chicken taco and stuffed mushrooms. I liked the taste of bbq salmon and of course the chocolate tuxedo cream cheescake was so yummy!!! :) :)"
Leonard H.,"Kirkland, WA",85,95,239,4.0,4/25/2012,"I have been a longtime fan of the Cheesecake Factory and I think they always do a pretty good job. Most recent visit was after a night of ""Cats"" at the nearby Paramount Theatre and the restaurant ambience naturally seemed to carry on the after show excitement level. The shrimp/steak Diane was delicious and the filet mignon was decent. The service was prompt and attentive as expected."
Jenny T.,"Everett, WA",3,9,,5.0,5/24/2014,"Yummy!  Good food, pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff.  We had a great time here!"
Michael R.,"Seattle, WA",58,163,23,3.0,3/2/2014,"Yes, this place is a chain but my experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory has been good. They have good service and the food here is pretty good for a chain restaurant. I love cheesecake and you can go here to get that craving taken care of with a big variety to choose from."
Dana D.,"Seattle, WA",77,86,223,4.0,4/5/2012,"I hate to admit it, but I do like this place. I'm not a fan of franchise restaurants, or large menus BUT, the food is great and reasonably priced."
Heather L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,60,12,4.0,4/27/2012,"Loved there new skinnylicious menu.  The lettuce wrap tacos are amazing and the flatbread with pears, pecans, cheese and rucola was to die for.   Waiters are very busy and not always attentive, but the place is pretty packed."
Bryan C.,"Bellevue, WA",77,30,,3.0,7/20/2011,"Prices are a bit high for the quality of the food. Is it pretty darn good? Yes it is. Is it GREAT? I wouldn't say so. A lot of times the pasta sauces are not that great (especially the Jambalaya, it would be very oily, or the red sauce pastas would be ""under-sauced"" if you know what I mean). Deserts are good though. Cheesecakes are INCREDIBLY RICH!!! The chocolate cake is nice too.  The 3-star rating should be a 3.5-3.75 star rating if that was an option; lost stars due to pasta quality and prices (basically their prices indicate they think their food is better than it really is)."
Lilly A.,"Seattle, WA",18,148,,2.0,8/2/2011,"I rolled into the cheesecake factory yesterday with my boyfriend. I have never been to one before, but I have heard such a huge variety of reactions, good and bad. The wait for our table was not too bad, and our server was very nice! But man, the menu is just pages upon pages upon pages.... can't you condense this? Maybe focus on less? It was a tad overwhelming... by the time I hit the 21st page, I think I forgot everything from the previous pages. I ended up ordering the garlic pasta with shrimp (which may I add, ended up being 4 pieces of shrimp for 4 dollars more.... which I think is ridiculous), which was alright... but there was nothing special about it. Was the experience truly worth it for a plate of pasta that must be over 1,500 calories? I'm not quite sure, however, my boyfriend has gotten a good kick out of devouring his burger and then telling everyone how he ate over 1,300 calories in one meal. Also, what seems to be a theme: one of the hostesses dropped a plate on the ground and then picked it up and put it back in with the stack of plates in the cabinet, which I thought was strange......ly gross."
Wendy L.,"Seattle, WA",218,19,1,4.0,6/24/2015,"Service was very friendly and attentive! Came here last night with a friend. My four cheese pasta was good, but not a standout dish. Also ordered a whisky smash which was delicious albeit a tad sweet (no complains from me though, I love a sweet cocktail). All in all, would suggest this place for a date as it does have that ambiance."
Atta F.,"Seattle, WA",5,26,17,5.0,5/15/2014,"We visit Cheesecake Factory on a weekly basis with the family. Either this location or south center location. Most of the lunch staff remembers us now so we have become the family with 4 orders of shrimp scampi with 2 the sauce on the side, Chinese chicken salad, 4 mango smoothies, etc. we love it here! One of the best chain American restaurants out there."
Rachel G.,"Seattle, WA",143,332,97,3.0,3/14/2011,"Yeah. I went there. I happened to have a gift card and thought if nothing else I could get boozed up and sugared out. The problem was, I was actually hungry. Their menu is 21 pages long, makes absolutely no sense AND has advertisements in it. What the ??? The problem with this place is that there are literally way to may options. And I always think that when there's so much to choose from, they can't possibly do any one thing well. Also, all of their entree salads have meat on them. They don't have one salad option without meat, which I thought was pretty bizarre. Alas, you can order any salad without the meat but don't you think that is just crazy? Whatever, it is what it is and next time I will just stick with the booze and desserts.  Also, the vibe is really weird in there. That is all I have to say about that."
Linda J.,"Seattle, WA",1,34,24,5.0,3/10/2015,"Went there for dinner the other night. Lovely service and great waiter. Our food came fast and was delicious, will definitely be coming back soon!"
Tori G.,"Stanwood, WA",0,4,,5.0,11/23/2012,It was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory and I was very happy with my dinner and dessert.  The menu is a literal book and the selection is amazing. There is so much to choose from and the server was very friendly and knew her stuff. I definitely would try it out if you are in Seattle and looking for a yummy treat. :)
Daniel E.,"Seattle, WA",17,51,9,3.0,11/21/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is just as it sounds. They are mass-produced and staffed. It is ok and the wait-staff may be excellent. But you do feel like you're in a giant machine. Don't go here for a special occasion.  Kids work well here (in fact, we took our first child here on her first night out from the hospital)."
