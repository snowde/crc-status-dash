Sharon T.,"Seattle, WA",29,35,,4.0,6/28/2012,"I work downtown and love it for lunch or dinner.  Always good food and a really large menu with lots of variety.  HUGE portions -  great for leftovers or share a dinner.    My favorite is the ""homemade"" meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes ... yummm!    I've always had good service - friendly, attentive, and they know their menu (which is quite a feat since it's so large).   And of course ... the cheesecake is fabulous.  Again ... so many choices.  I always think I'll have dessert, but seldom have room for it after the big dinner.   So it's my go-to place downtown for dessert after an event.  The ambiance with their lighting is especially lovely in the evenings."
Joy B.,"Hope, Canada",0,29,14,2.0,9/25/2013,"I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory before this visit. I was very unimpressed! The atmosphere was so weird -- like they're trying to be fancy, but has to decorate with cheap stuff. Our server was great! Our food was meh. Way overpriced for the quality! My husband's burger was really inconsistently cooked with parts super pink and parts really charred. My chicken burger was HUGE! But bland and had way to much breaking. The fries were tasty. We tried a key line cheesecake that was pretty sweet, but not bad. Overall, not worth the visit and definitely not worth what we paid!"
Jen G.,"Kelowna, Canada",0,22,21,5.0,8/7/2012,"We Love this place!!!! We came in for lunch, and returned that night for dessert for dinner!!! The staff are amazing - the food was amazing - we loved it!! Have the MEATLOAF - omg - to die for"
JoAnn A.,"Bellevue, WA",80,319,32,3.0,1/31/2012,"I've been to this place only a few times, but I've never really had a terrible experience every time I've gone. The last time I came here I was just picking up cheesecake but it was mighty tasty. I like that the Cheesecake Factory offers so many different options of food for your taste buds. I don't go to this location a lot because I don't live in the area really. The wait can be a little bit long, which can be a turn off, but  it's not a bad place to go to once you're seated I think."
Angel E.,"Tacoma, WA",48,18,15,4.0,7/27/2011,"Avocado Eggrolls..with Tamarind dipping sauce. OMG Its the best thing on earth. I don't even care that there are a million calories in them. Ill eat the the entire plate if someone does not wrestle one away from me. There just THAT good. The menu is huge as are the portions. If you have even an average appetite plan to share or take a lot home with you. If you are there during the dinner hours and are shocked by prices on what you know you wont be able to finish, you can ask for a lunch portion which is slightly smaller and less expensive.  I know its the Cheesecake Factory and I do love cheesecake but  I almost never get a slice. Its so expensive ($8.00+) and in my opinion the food is whats good here not the cheesecake. They do have a ton of choices to choose from but im a classic cheesecake person and their classic is not dense enough for me. Its not a NY cheesecake its softer and almost jelly like.  Lots of vegetarian items to choose from. Always a plus in my book :)"
Polly C.,"Vancouver, Canada",69,148,7,4.0,12/25/2011,"Had the avocado egg roll (fried) - there were about 5-6 pieces...lots of avocado and the sundried tomatoes. Great combination of flavors! Great appie! Again, had to get the jalapeno pasta - smaller portion and felt that this time's order was spicier compared to last time. Really full after and didn't have time for dessert. Must try different cheesecakes next time!"
Sarah P.,"Tacoma, WA",57,3,,1.0,3/14/2016,"One of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in my life! I picked this restaurant to eat at with my boyfriend while we stayed in Seattle to celebrate our anniversary. We went out to eat around 7 & sat in the bar, the place was busy but the bar was not. We ordered chicken nachos with guac & sour cream in the side, the waiter never once wrote our order down; so when the nachos came no chicken. Not a big deal. For our main courses I ordered the California cheesesteak with no mushrooms and a salad, as well as a side of the grilled asparagus. Once again our waiter never wrote down our order. We patiently waited for our food, & as it arrived no asparagus. When our waiter checked to make sure the food was ok after a bite or two was taken I had told him my sandwich had mushrooms on it & my asparagus was never brought out. He insisted that he put no mushrooms on the ticket & that my asparagus would be put shortly & took my plate with him as well. When he came back he apologized again & said the asparagus was cooking & his manager was going to come speak with us. After another wait he walked over with our check & a man behind him & said my whole meal was being comped, the asparagus still never came! & the 'manager' barely said two words. Needless to say, we will never be going back which is unfortunate since it was our first time there & everyone rants about how great the place is."
Chad Y.,"Honolulu, HI",1056,1234,446,2.0,4/14/2009,"Ok, Cheesecake Factory often get's rave reviews from people for their cheesecake. Don't get me wrong..it is definitely good (just don't look at the calorie content)! That being said, I don't like to frequent places that has long waits and won't take reservations. Also, their menu is huge! We are talking BIG! They have a few good menu items such as the deep fried macaroni and fish tacos. Other than that the menu lacks creativity and flavors. It also has HUGE portions, so plan to take some home or have a huge appetite! The service is usually good and is it's one saving grace for me. The servers generally know the menu's well and can help you when you don't know what to get. Also, they are pretty attentive and notice when things are lacking. I think it is a decent place to check out, but personally I'd rather stop by someplace else (preferably with less than an hour wait)!"
Susan W.,"WA, WA",125,620,1484,4.0,11/13/2009,"Brought husband here today for his first visit, my third.  Service was excellent.  Restaurant beautiful!   I had the fish tacos.  Delicious.  Hubby had the grilled shrimp club sandwich, also delicious.  We each had a beer and got a piece of their pumpkin pecan cheesecake to go.  Total bill was $50.  A great deal for the good amount of food served in a nice atmosphere.   Will go to the Southcenter location next to see how they compare."
Shandiin G.,"Renton, WA",181,56,44,3.0,1/13/2012,Ohhhhh Cheesecake Factory!!!! So This particular location is the downtown Seattle one! For me its a love/hate relationship. Love as in I love cheesecakes and hate as in every time I go to this place there is a long LONG wait! I happened to go there one a Tuesday evening and again I had to wait about 20 minuets to get my table by the door and it was quite the chilly evening!! The service I got there this evening was sorta 50/50. Some people were friendly and some were just wishy washy and I didn't like that. My biggest beef with this Cheesecake Factory is that the floors are always slippery. I thought it was the shoes I ware but its a different pair of shoes every time???? what the hay? One of these days I'm gonna hit the deck on my quest for some cheesecake!  Now as for the food. I love the food. I order the same things every time I'm there (I'm boring like that sometimes) this time me and my friend said that we were going to go outside the box and order something different. It was pretty good. I had the chicken and sundried tomatoes. I will have to say that the quality of food is always pretty good. Don't get me started with the cheesecake... particularly the Red Velvet! Oh my lab that this is so good and so worth the money! So basically I dig Cheesecake Factory. there are just a few things about it that I wish would change. I'm just glad the food is good!!!
Liz M.,"Seattle, WA",101,454,9,4.0,1/26/2013,"Probably more of a 3.5 but I like The Cheesecake Factory for certain things, so I'm rounding up. First, it's a chain with all the good and bad that that signifies.  Is there better food available? Of course.  Better cheesecake? Yes, that too.  Nicer restaurants at the same price point? Indeed.  Are the portions so big as to be absurd? Definitely.  But, if you are willing to accept The Cheesecake Factory for what it is, you can have a nice meal here. I came with a friend for lunch, as their lunch menu prices are pretty reasonable, especially for downtown.  The menu is ridiculously large.  I usually only read a page or two of it and make my choice from there, or I'd spend the entire lunch hour just flipping back and forth.  I chose a flatbread pizza which was all right (although not well-cut so I ended up having to try to saw it apart with a table knife) and a 'cup' of clam chowder that would be considered a pot's worth anywhere else.  The soup was tasty, as were my friend's crabcake bites.  She also ordered a beet and goat cheese salad which was good.  We got the usual complimentary bread basket which is nice for fending off starvation pains while you wait, although the wait was not long.  Service was on top of things, although the restaurant is so big that they 'lost' my friend who had arrived before me and it took a few minutes before we figured out which table she was at. Despite its large size, the place gets full quickly, especially around dinner and I don't think they take reservations, or at least they only take them by phone, day of.  However, it wasn't busy when we were there and the noise level was perfectly manageable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here or wait more than a few minutes for a table, but for a reliable, tasty, not overly expensive meal, it will always make my list."
Gigi K.,"Downey, CA",66,25,4,3.0,2/10/2014,'Nuff said. Its busy a lot because of the location to the convention center. I would recommend that you make reservations for any meal if there is a convention. Prices are high in comparison to other nearby options
Kyla C.,"Washington, DC",11,359,65,3.0,8/6/2011,"So I've been to Palomino a million times and since we were going downtown for a movie, we decided to mix it up and go to the Cheesecake Factory instead...weird choice for me but cheesecake is one of my weaknesses I must admit.  I haven't been here in years and was disappointed to find their thousand page menu still in rotation.  Who needs every menu item they could ever think of??  It's just overwhelming and not necessary.  And the portions are gigantic!!  Thanks for contributing to America's obesity problem Cheesecake Factory!   The food is nothing to rave about.  My husband and I split some appetizers and salad (salad was good, corn cakes were smothered in way too much sauce!)  The cheesecake is still in the fridge because we were full from splitting 3 things but I'm sure it will be delish.   Overall, go here for the cheesecake, eat in the bar (unless you like waiting in line for 30+ minutes for a table, ridiculous!!), don't expect much from the food and try not to look up, the atmosphere is just weird and doesn't make sense.  I think I've had my fill of this place for the next decade or so!"
Daniel H.,"Rochester, WA",1,13,15,4.0,3/26/2013,"Food was EXCELLENT.  I had the Navajo, simple, delicious.  My wife had the Pasta DaVinci and it was outstanding.  My daughter said her steak was the best she's ever had.  With cheesecake all around (there is no better cheesecake, anywhere), the bill was a bit steep, but for one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant lately and excellent service on a busy evening, overall really wonderful."
J K.,"Seattle, WA",136,1457,3029,1.0,1/11/2009,"I had a couple good experiences here when it first opened, then I had a few bad experiences recently -- and I'm not one of those biased people who hates chains. The food is terrible. I'm sorry to say that. I don't want to be mean. But it is. The menu looks good, the food looks good, but the food does not taste good."
Kylie R.,"Seattle, WA",1,3,,4.0,9/16/2014,"Once you walk in you're immediately greeted by the hostess, which was very welcoming! Our waiter, Jesus, was very friendly and attentive, like how a waiter should be. Great service! We ordered the lunch sized fettuccine alfredo. It was absolutely delicious and worth the price. Glad I ordered the lunch portion of the pasta because it was enough to fill me up! If you want a lunch special, make sure to get there and order before 5pm."
Cristelle J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,226,20,3.0,1/12/2011,"Red Velvet Cheesecake = love After watching another riveting episode of true life the roommates and I headed downtown to get dinner at the cheesecake factory. Now I guess I should of expected the type of food being served here since it is a chain, and a chain that makes it's employees wear khaki pants and white t-shirts (uhm were not in the Hamptons people!). We ordered the blue cheese pear pizza, crab cakes, onion rings and a plethora of cheesecake. The cheesecakes were delicious especially the red velvet as for the entrees they were banal. nothing too exciting nothing above what i expected."
S. Alicia S.,"Burbank, CA",2046,670,3300,5.0,1/15/2011,"It is my personal belief that the most significant meals are those that transpire on the first day of the year. It sets the stage for the year ahead. So I decided to go health conscientious at a mass-market food chain. The Cheesecake Factory - Seattle on New Years Day was packed. And it seemed that a lot of people had the same mindset. The waitress told me the Salads, Weight Management and Pasta menu items seemed to be top sellers of the afternoon.  I went for a simple vegetarian meal for dinner with Coke Zero. The Incredible Eggplant Sandwich came with sweet potato fries. And instead of getting a small house salad, the side dish of snow peas sounded really good.  That side of snow peas was the best idea ever. It came sauteed in sesame oil with julienne carrots and zucchini. Dinner as a whole looked and tasted so fresh and luxuriant. I was shocked happy. And I was too full to even think about cheesecake. But it was the first day of the year spent at the Cheesecake Factory. So I got a slice of Banana Cream Cheesecake to-go for a late dessert at home. Utterly divine."
Arjayne E.,"San Jose, CA",107,4,1,4.0,11/28/2013,I definitely fell in love with the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheese cake. A little pricey for dinner but great service and ambiance!
Glenn C.,"Cincinnati, OH",887,887,858,3.0,6/28/2011,"Same menu as the rest of the chain.  Was surprised the seafood is not local.  Dishes were less spicy than the same chain in LA, DC or Cincinnati.  My wife had the white bean chili soup which she had before.  This had lots of rice and little taste; totally different than previous occasions.  I had the Chicken Madiera which was right on but the potatoes were definitely lacking in flavor; again different than other locations.  Caesar salad was OK at best; again disappointing since we expected it to be like the rest of the chain."
