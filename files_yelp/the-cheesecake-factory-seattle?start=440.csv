Michael M.,"Tacoma, WA",273,70,37,1.0,11/13/2010,"Wow...two meals here in two days...wanted to give them another chance.   What a disaster.  Wretched service both times, management was ineffectual...food was cold.  Don't get me wrong, I love The Cheesecake Factory, have been to 7-8 locations all over the country traveling and have sponsored several business meals at various locations.  Based on my experience here, I doubt I'll go to any other of their locations again.  It was that bad. Epic Fail. [Addendum: Guests during the Seattle Marathon weekend really, really wanted to go to TCF...I set my teeth and smiled...I swear, I must be on a poster in the breakroom to ""Give this man and his party the wrong food and terrible service until he refuses to return.""]"
Sarah D.,"Seattle, WA",173,975,638,2.0,9/20/2010,"Blech. This is corporate schlock food at it's best. There was way too much food and none of it had much flavor at all. Funny enough, we were thinking the same thing as a previous reviewer, that the menu was like a place on Kitchen Nightmares. I think Gordon Ramsey has a good take on this - less on the menu and do it really well. Service was ok and cheesecake itself was ok (cheesecake is like pizza and sex, even when not that good, it's still good). The price was also pretty steep for the quality. They could make way less food and have better ingredients and the prices would still cover their costs."
Dee D.,"Burnaby, Canada",62,61,4,4.0,9/15/2011,"While I normally get Evelyn's Pasta - I decided to try something new: the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It had strips of parmesan crusted chicken (which was very crispy!) served with mushrooms, peppers and onions in a ""spicy New Orleans sauce"". While I can't quite put my finger on what constitutes a spicy New Orleans sauce, I know cajun plays a big part of it. I love the Cheesecake Factory pastas because they are never drowning in sauce. It is a bit of a pet peeve of mine when I go to restaurants and my pasta resembles soup. I also loved the bowtie pasta used partially because it held the flavour of the sauce and veggies well but also because it's really cute."
Alice C.,"Seattle, WA",116,560,107,2.0,9/10/2008,"While I went with a group of tourists who gagged at the thought of eating sashimi and really good sushi, there is a reason for the kind of mild disgust that awashed over me upon entering. The interior made me think of a mall food court- cheesy, half assed with weird lighting and some neon.  Staff was nice and friendly enough (I mean, come on. Anyone doing customer service-food relations at the Cheesecake Factory probably isnt going to be the happiest, right?), the fact that I saw the same waitress (not mine) adjust food with her bare hands on her way to several tables made me sick. I work in the food/service industry... I know how much crap comes into contact with your hands... Viewing this made me swear to never come again.  Portions are huge, food is mediocre, and the cheesecake made me wish I was on my way to the Big Apple to get some of the real stuff (the stuff that two teenagers and a grown man couldnt put a dent in)."
Mike V.,"Port Orchard, WA",102,190,18,2.0,8/27/2013,"After seeing a matinee at the Paramount, we stopped in for some cheesecake. The wait seemed to be around 30 minutes. I spotted an open table in the bar and grabbed it. After about 7-8 minutes,a waiter came over and dropped off menus. Then came back a few minutes later to get a drink order. We ordered drinks and the cheesecake and fudge cake at that point. The cakes were incredible but the waiter was just horrible. Rude, unfriendly, and seemed bothered. Kinda ruined the whole experience."
Lindsay P.,"Lake Stevens, WA",209,310,19,3.0,4/8/2011,"Cheesecake from the Cheesecake factory: ALWAYS GOOD Appetizers from the Cheesecake factory: AMAZING- really recommend the avacado egg rolls and the crab and cream cheese wontons. SOOO GOOD. Dinners from the Cheesecake factory: not worth your time. Their menu is MASSIVE so if you have a hard time making up your mind you are going to spend at least an hour perusing the menu. I went here with my husband and Mother and law and it was a disaster because she can't eat anything; she's not eating meat, can't have sesame oil, can't have anything with small bits when digested... and can't have soy. So you mean she can't eat anything? Pretty much. The servers don't know what is in the dishes so they have a hard time directing you; she ended up getting a salad where the dressing had sesame oil in it, as well as edamame (which is soy beans, if you weren't aware) on it. She had to send it back and didn't realize the dressing was sesame until it came back without the edamame.  Usually when I come here my husband and I share two or three appetizers and get a piece of cheesecake each to take home- the cheesecake usually lasts for at least two or three days.  Bill when we have appetizers and chesecake- about $50 if we don't drink. I haven't been here since I've turned 21 and been able to get a drink so I don't know if they have a good happy hour or not. Bill when we have dinner and cheesecake to take home? Nearly $100, even without soda.  Great place to drop in for the appetizers and cheesecake to take home, but you're going to wait at LEAST 30 min if not more, so make sure you're not on a time limit.  Great thing is too, if you don't want to sit around and wait, and all you want is cheesecake, you can order it in their front bakery to go, without a wait for a table."
Sean K.,"Lodi, CA",49,76,5,2.0,1/30/2011,"What do I have to do to not have the waiter say ""that's a lot of food, you sure you want that?"" Seriously... everything at cheesecake is a lot of food! I had a beet salad, and a burrito. It's a lot of food. I get it. The beet salad is tiny, but what can I do about the burrito?  PS, I finished it all.    Loved when he said ""you going to have some desert"", and I said no. He responds by saying ""I didn't think so"".  Hey, save me the commentary, and just me dinner. Thanks!"
Christopher M.,"Mercer Island, WA",587,100,131,5.0,8/15/2013,Always a fan. They made me a blended drink that is actually from Red Robin for me and didnt overcharge.
Mamata P.,"Jersey City, NJ",23,7,1,3.0,12/14/2014,"We are regular customers at cheese cake factory and it has been our best dining place until yesterday. We had been to this place to celebrate a friend's birthday last night. One of my friends had ordered Mediterranean flatbread sandwich (vegetarian). Since this dish is usually served with beef, she had explicitly asked them to serve it with vegetarian tikki instead, which the waitress said is possible. However to our surprise they served it with beef. Unfortunately all of us tasted it. Not having tasted beef before we took a while to realize the blunder they made. The waitress apologized and we ordered 2 vegetarian quesadilla without chicken instead. And boy, it was served with chicken and my friend had quite some of it before he realized this.The manager came to us and apologized for it, which is a nice thing to do. But I wish they had been more careful at least the second time  because now 2 of my friends have pledged not to go there again. Since they are hard core vegetarians they were feeling very bad for having had beef and chicken just because of the restaurant s carelessness."
Lala L.,"Seattle, WA",21,59,5,3.0,3/27/2011,"Stopped by on a Saturday night around five (I'm usually not this stupid) with my husband and two cousins, nine and four to celebrate the four year old's birthday. After a wait of 45 minutes, along with one meltdown, we were seated. Our waitress was a gem, she was super friendly, and went the extra mile to give the four year old some extra attention. It was really nice to see that they've added a kid's menu, as this is definitely a family restaurant.  As most know, the portions are big and tend to be salty, so be sure to have tons of water on hand, and don't try to take it all down in one sitting. We ordered pizza and chicken tenders for the kids, the caramel chicken for my husband, and I had the pear and blue cheese pizzette. The thing about The Cheesecake Factory is that they rock at doing a thousand different dishes at a mediocre level. So I can say the adults full but not so satisfied.  We also ordered a slice of fudge cake that the staff delivered with a candle while singing happy birthday.The four year old FLIPPED out and love that.  Tips: The  pizzette's are an EXCELLENT value at a little under $5 and are more than filling as a dinner portion. Great place to take loud toddlers and kids as the overall noise level with drown out any foolishness that may be going on at your table."
Helen N.,"Seattle, WA",1,18,,3.0,1/14/2012,"I went with a few friends on a Saturday afternoon and they were decently packed and well staffed. We didn't make any reservations and we only had to wait a little while for a booth. The service was pretty good, appropriately timed the a waitress came for drink orders and then for our food order. Although there was one awkward moment when Parmesan was shredded into my water. The food was nothing to brag about. I had a medium factory burger and it took me a few second to realize it was mine when it came to the table. It was pretty red and medium rare at best (perfect after two minutes of microwave at home) and my friends noticed it too. Eat the fries were like McDonald fries; eat it hot and now. I shared a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake, that at least was good. Overal, I can't complain, there was cheesecake involved."
Dan B.,"San Francisco, CA",4996,595,383,2.0,6/5/2008,"I've never been so glad to see The Cheesecake Factory before. Lost. Hungry. And in desperate need of food and somewhere to sit.  The problem was we didn't know where to go and were afraid of trying some random place.  At the same time, we didn't want to settle for some fast food place.  So we compromised. The lunch was so so. The Pasta Da Vinci was bland and needed more sauce. The Cuban sandwich suffered because of inferior mustard and funky fast food pickles.  It's too bad since the rest of the sandwich was pretty tasty and came with addicting McDonald's type fries. Thank goodness for the fresh strawberry cheesecake.  It made this luncheon worthwhile: sweet strawberries, light cheesecake with hints of vanilla, nice graham cracker crust, and airy whipped cream. The Mondavi Cab was also a good find: medium body and good nose. Next time, I'm only ordering desserts and drinks."
Sarah A.,"Seattle, WA",12,7,,1.0,1/3/2014,"Anticipating a long wait for a table for dinner I called today to try to make a reservation for a larger group of us. Was rudely informed that they don't take reservations and was promptly hung up on. Super annoying considering that one in our group is 38 weeks pregnant and we will be with small children. We'll still give it a try, and hopefully the wait won't be long, but seriously? Customers should be allowed to make reservations."
Angela N.,"San Francisco, CA",10,82,1,4.0,12/19/2010,"SURPRISE, their fish + chips are actually pretty delicious! Would order it again. I also really like their country garden something-or-the-other salad; super fresh veggies all cut into tiny chopped-salad sizes.  Service, while not particularly memorable, is always polite and prompt and willing to give me infinite minutes for reading their novel of a menu. Speaking of which, I actually LIKE that their menu is gigantic -- the Cheesecake Factory is not supposed to be some magical fine dining experience, it's comfort food at reasonable prices. Nothing screams comfort louder than a menu that offers you just about everything your little heart desires. For the longest time I was a devout fan of the classic + fresh strawberries, but I was recently persuaded to try the raspberry lemon... love. Lovelovelove. Even my adamantly-against-all-forms-of-cheese sisters love the raspberry lemon cheesecake, WOAH. My new favorite cheesecake.  Things I recommend you avoid:  -the mini corndogs (I've no excuses): I've had better storebought-frozen-then-nuked versions. Somehow these tasted a little... sour... ???? Happy thoughts happy thoughts happy thoughts. -their fruit daiquiris (strawberry and mango, particularly): This is neither fruit nor daiquiri. You deserve better. -french toast napolean (brunch item): Sort of tastes like a cross between a bad birthday cake and box-mix pancakes (lots of strawberries though). -broccoli cheddar soup: Powdery texture and mehhhh flavor.  List to be updated as my wreck of a ""ooh that sounds good"" train continues chugging through the menu."
bernard f.,"Seattle, WA",2,65,5,2.0,7/3/2010,"Typical corporate chain mentality on display here. Ordered a Manhattan rocks, comes with *waaaay* too much vermouth, bartender tries to convince me that I don't know how my favorite drink is made. Right, after ten years of ordering this, he thinks he is the first one to get it right? If I am overpaying (and you definitely are here) I expect to at least get adequate service.    The extra star is because they do their edemame well."
Logan V.,"West Richland, WA",59,73,1,3.0,7/19/2011,"Uninspired American food, long wait times but a generally nice atmosphere. Watch out for 9:30pm, when they turn the lights down low (extra romance?). Great for groups, because they are built to handle it. The extra star comes from the de-freaking-licious cheesecake. My favorite is Lemon Raspberry Cream, which is light (for cheesecake!) and has a tart raspberry sauce that is delicious with the cheesecake. I'm not a chocoholic, but their Blueberry White Chocolate cake is very good, as well."
Boop B.,"Mill Creek, WA",271,142,8,4.0,6/21/2011,"Came here for lunch with a group of friends around 2PM.  The place looked jammed, and we were told it would be about 5 minutes. 2 minutes later, we were seated with the waitress asking us what to drink. Drinks came immediately, and she proceeded to ask us if we were ready.  Orders for 4 people took about 15 minutes, with each other coming one at a time in 1 ~ 2 minute intervals. Before that, bread came nice and warm.  I expected the atmosphere to not be as nice as this, seeing that we were just a bunch of teenagers anyway... But they served us well and were attentive with refills.  I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It was alright. The spiciness is only because of the Tabasco sauce in the sandwich... Nothing more. The meat wasn't crispy. It was soft and a bit dry. Overall, an okay burger for $12.  The service was excellent. Love the atmosphere, but we had a booth behind the kitchen which was kind of loud. A few plates broke in the back, and there were just a lot of fuss.  But being that we focused in our own conversations, it was alright."
Douglas K.,"Belleville, IL",74,495,138,5.0,4/6/2013,"I know it is a chain restaurant, but this is my favorite chain-type dinner spot.  We always do backwards day when we go here and get our cheesecake first then split appetizers and a meal.  The servers are always great and never give us any hassle about splitting a dinner.  It is great for us because their portions are so large and when you ask them to split it, it come out on two plates that are more than enough for two."
D.J. Y.,"Shoreline, WA",356,948,826,4.0,4/28/2008,"I wanted to be the 60th person to Yelp Ye Olde Cheesecake Factory, TA-DA!!! Personally, I like this place, while I don't like the prices or the fact I have to pay for parking.  The environment, if you come early, is nice enough, much better than the Bellevue location in my opinion. The menu cracks me up, it so extensive that they have ads in it!  By the way, if your menu is getting advertising supplements shouldn't your prices reflect that??  Just say'n.... The faux decor kinda makes me feel all gooey inside, I mean, I have to pay for parking and drive all the way into Downtown Seattle, heck, I'd better get some kind of eye candy to make the trip worth while. Food-wise, it's always been solid, nothing amazing, I tend to stay away from the ""burgers"" but my Pops has had a few and he enjoys them here.  My personal favs are the pasta dishes and I had a French dip recently.  It wasn't as good as my mom's, but really who could live up to that!!  ;-) Service has always been attentive, but again, we ALWAYS go early on the weekends, for brunch/lunch, so I can't speak to the other horror stories I've  read here on Yelp.   It's Downtown, you pay for parking, did I mention that?  And you'll have a nice slice of cheesecake to take home.....well, for a price...."
Art C.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",0,19,5,5.0,9/22/2013,"Awful awful awful.  Service horrible, food mediocre.  I should've known better."
