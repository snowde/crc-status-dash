Amanda W.,"Seattle, WA",23,118,18,3.0,4/26/2011,"Able to get a party of 4 with no reservations in 5 minutes on a Friday night at 6pm, unheard of.  I always have a great time at the cheesecake factory. I had the pizza margarita and my hubby had the pad Thai pasta. Both of our meals were very good. The cheesecake is always good and the waiter was always refilling our water glass.  Was this the best food I had, nope. However, it is good for big groups and the prices vary so even your frugal friends can find something here."
l b.,"Jacksonville, FL",23,188,48,3.0,5/11/2011,"Wow! Very surprised that a chain restaurant had such unique and delicious food! We went on weekday evening so there was no wait. The ambiance is a bit more upscale than I'm used to, yet I was still comfortable. The server was attentive, not annoying, and helpful. The food presentation was aesthetically pleasing. We started with 2 appetizers which were plenty to fill us both up. I've had better Crab Wontons so I recommend against them here. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes should not be missed! These are to die for. They are not traditional Southern style as I expected and thank God seeing as how I don't even like corn bread. They were sweet and garnished with a avocado, sour cream and a distinctive green salsa.   Being that my date had eyes bigger than his stomach we had an entree still to come despite our full bellies. I wasn't even considering eating any of it because I was uncomfortably full at this point, but after trying one bite I couldn't not eat a few more bites. It was a spaghetti pasta with a light white wine sauce with shrimp and peas.  Overall, a great restaurant if you're okay with the big and glamorous atmosphere."
Kristin C.,"Issaquah, WA",312,689,30,3.0,4/4/2011,"Overall I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I just HATE this location. Its always busy, and they don't take reservations. So you can't get in on a Saturday night, cuz its like a 2 hour wait. For anyone who has read my previous reviews, I hate waiting for food. Well, for anything really.  The food is good though. I am not a fan of how huge the menu is though. There are just way too many choices. For a first timer, a menu this size is just daunting. And I have always thought that less is more. At least that's what Food Network tells me.  My favorite is the spicy chicken sandwich. It is huge, greasy, and delicious! When first looking at the menu you would think they are expensive, but based off the amount of food you get, its actually really cheap.  I would definitely not suggest going for desserts and drinks though, that can get a bit pricey. I love their cheesecake too. My boyfriend and I can never decide on a piece to share though, so we just order 2 pieces and take home left overs. Its like 3 desserts in 1. Luckily, we both love the chicken sandwich, so we can share that, which justifies ordering cheesecake."
Michael K.,"Seattle, WA",299,631,40,4.0,3/31/2010,"I know a lot of people have a problem with the inevitable waits at the Cheesecake Factory, but I confess that I enjoy the food enough to really not mind so much.  Also, while it is sort of lame that they don't take reservations, depending on who you deal with, and at least in my experience how friendly you are, they will make exceptions.   Now the biggest difficulty in eating here is somehow making it through the short story that is the menu without your stomach leading and armed rebellion against your teasing.  For the sake of being as annoyingly elaborate as said menu, I will briefly describe EVERYTHING that I have tried here.  Feel free to stop reading at this point, if you haven't already :-) Appetizers (as if you need them with the portions of the main courses and the inevitable cheesecake to follow) - Avocado Egg Rolls - I really like how light and flaky these are, and the avocado was delicious and perfectly ripe.  The sauce was a bit on the sweet side but wasn't really necessary to begin with due to all the flavors involved. Also, anything with sundried tomato wins in my book. Fried Calamari - Satisfactory: Nothing special but good.  Firecracker Salmon Rolls - These are decent although I would recommend trying them at C.I. Shenanigans if you want a really amazing experience.  Like the calamari, they are decent and yummy. Viet Shrimp Summer Rolls - Very good if you're looking to avoid the fatty, fried selections.  Would be better with whole shrimp instead of the baby shrimp meat, but still had a good flavor.  Main events: Spicy Cashew Chicken - My absolute favorite; An enormous bowl filled with enough chicken, rice and delicious cashews to easily feed two people (or me).  The sauce has a very good kick and the onions are always crunchy and delicious (havent had soggy ones as of yet).  I now ask them to add broccoli to the dish, which I've only been charged extra for one of three times.   Chicken and Biscuits - Homestyle comfort food.  The biscuits tasted like butter with a side of flour (which is a good thing).  The mashed potatos were almost certainly not made in house but they were still ok.  The chicken was a touch on the dry side so I asked for extra gravy to apply generously.  All in all it was ok.  Wouldn't reorder but no real complaints.   Mahi Mahi Mediterranean - Croikey! Second favorite: The mahi was delicious, flaky, and perfectly prepared, although I feel like this may have been due to the odd hours we visited on this particular occasion.  I get the feeling on a busy night, this one could get messed up pretty easily.  The artichoke was delightful too, not tough at all, and for some reason the mashed potatos tasted totally different and more homemade with this dish.  I am too hungry to continue - on to the cheesecake: Red Velvet - Makes me want to curl up in a ball and watch Disney movies.  Not sure if that gets the point across that its' AWESOME. Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Truffle (etc. I can't remember it had a ridic name) - Four Nom's out of Five. It's like slamming your face into a pillow case full of candy and cheesecake.  Don't get dinner if you're going to have this one. Tiramisu - 1/2: The first time it was unbelievably great, the second time it tasted like French Silk Pie... Which is good but not what it should have tasted like.  Not sure what happened there. I think the one thing that disappoints me about the Cheesecake Factory is the identity crisis that it seems to be going through on a regular basis.  The lighting and dress of the staff suggests an expensive 4/5 star place, and yet the menu is that of an upscale Friday's.  Much like turkey pastrami and turkey bologna, it simply needs to learn how to be itself."
Vince N.,"Renton, WA",415,781,339,3.0,2/9/2009,"""Long lines for much of the same""  Cheesecake factories are always the same, always consistent, always busy, always looking like a Vegas buffet.  The food is a step above your average chain restaurant. The menu offers and endless array of food.  If you are not sure of where to eat,you are downtown, afraid to try something different and unique and need a bite for a decent price this place is not a bad choice."
Stella Y.,"Seattle, WA",36,37,19,2.0,3/11/2010,"For being rude on the phone when I was asking about reservations. Okay, you don't take reservations.  But you don't have to be nasty about it."
Fernando G.,"Honolulu, HI",28,141,80,4.0,5/23/2013,"the assembly lines continues ... and with it, the style of service.  not sure if i could say good things about the feel of quality customer services regards this particular outlet.  what i do know is that the dynamics of service is so monotone and unpolished that i may one day just order my food to go.  food is amazing tho ... as is the cheese and as are their drinks.  enough said!"
Steven S.,"DuPont, WA",63,17,5,5.0,6/24/2013,I never have a problem with this establishment. Always fast and nice people people. I sat at the bar for the first time at this Downtown spot and they were working fast and with a purpose. The bartender was even nicer when she found out I was military. Great place!
J C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,18,4,1.0,10/7/2012,"I ordered two cheese cakes to go. The cashier was rude and unfriendly. She forgot to put forks in my bag, (not even ask me if I need one.) I returned to the store and asked for forks. She handed me spoons. I said I need forks instead of spoons. She said "" I don't have a fork"" in a bitchy way. It seems like she is not happy working there and treated customers badly. It was her on Friday night as well when I ordered caked.  Both experiences were TERRIBLE!!!!!.. I saw the name on the receipt.. Her name is Mandy J.... I was so disappointed about her service!!!!!"
Shasta L.,"Seattle, WA",62,123,23,3.0,8/4/2010,"I legitimately like The Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain. I order the same things every time, and while that might seem really boring...OK, it is really boring, but whatever. It's not like I go here for extraordinary cuisine or something. The menu is HUGE. They have burgers, pastas, steaks, fish, salads, pizzas, not to mention over two dozen kinds of cheesecakes. This is a place you can take the pickiest eaters to because they will be able to find something they want from the vast menu. This particular location can have over a 2-hour wait for a table, so I avoid it at all costs on the weekend. The service isn't memorable, in a good or bad way, but I'm only here for the crab wontons, crusted chicken romano, and Kahlua cheesecake every few months."
Janelle B.,"Houston, TX",22,29,26,4.0,4/16/2008,"I don't like chain restaurants.  They are impersonal and rarely special.  Everything has that mass-produced feel to it.  And, in the heart of Seattle, surrounded by so many unique local flavors, it seems to especially be a travesty to waste your limited stomach space and dining hours on such a generic choice. With that said, however, the Cheesecake Factory actually isn't so bad, as chain restaurants go.  If you must dine at such a place, better Cheesecake Factory than, say, a place like Olive Garden.   Cheesecake Factory is one of the few restaurants that gets pasta right.  Almost without fail, whenever I order a pasta dish from any other restaurant, they find a way to mess it up.  But I've ordered pasta at Cheesecake Factory several times, and it is always delicious and flavorful.  This alone justifies the venture into generic chain-dom. I like their lunch menu.  Cheesecake Factory dinners are huge, I never finish them.  So, the smaller lunch portions are perfect (and usually still too large to be finished), and they are also much more affordable. The server was inattentive.  He forgot my water, spilled food on someone else, and messed up our bill.  But, what are the chances you'll get the same server as me?  Not that great.  Don't let it dissuade you. Just...you're in Seattle...there are so many other, better choices nearby!  Why go for the safe and familiar, with so many better options waiting to be sampled? (of course, this begs the question - why did *I* choose the 'safe and familiar' when I could have gone somewhere more local?  Well, because that's the location my friends chose to meet up.  'Nuff said.)"
Nichole A.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,59,2,4.0,7/25/2013,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory since it opened even though it always seems to be busy. Even though it is busy, I have yet to get poor service. I like that they have a pretty large menu so that I choose different things each time if I want to. My meal is always great, and of course, they have amazing cheesecakes!"
Inger L.,"Seattle, WA",12,21,2,4.0,10/5/2012,"Went for my husband's birthday (our daughter's favorite restaurant). Bread was super. Waiter was great; loved the French accent! Chicken and sun-dried tomato pasta dish was OK. Others in the group liked their food; bang-bang chicken/shrimp and barbecue hamburger. Atmosphere is nice and it is clean, which really matters to me. Watch the floor if you are in heels.....the tile is slick!"
Thomas J.,"Seattle, WA",44,11,1,4.0,9/12/2013,"The serving sizes were large, couldn't finish the whole meal. Food was good. The service was excellent. Great place for a date or meeting. The atmosphere is very nice and creative. Can't wait to go back."
Roma M.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",241,439,157,2.0,3/3/2010,"I make it a point to visit as many Cheesecake Factory locations as I can, this visit wasn't by choice, since I really don't understand why anyone would come here when they live somewhere like Seattle.  Seattle is famous for great, independent restaurants.  We unfortunately had nowhere else to go on Christmas Eve. Of course, it was insanely busy, but which Cheesecake Factory isn't? (Even on a normal weeknight.)  We had two different servers for the night. Confusing and inefficient as hell. Our server took forever with our order, and kept trying to upsell us. I had to request even the most basic things as ketchup for my fries. I thought ketchup and fries were like bread and butter. I've never had a server at CF not ask if we wanted extra bread. I usually don't touch the bread at restaurants, but CF has fantastic bread. I usually accept extra and here I had to ask for it, when they usually bring a new batch anyway. Then within 3 minutes of receiving the next batch, another staff member grabbed the basket(still full) without asking us if we were done with it.  Despite the server constantly trying to upsell, he wasn't terrible. I think the management needs to just reassess their entire approach to customer service instead of herding in wallets like cattle."
Banana M.,"Seattle, WA",3,118,81,5.0,3/2/2011,"I love cheesecake and where better to get the best cheese cake than at the Cheesecake Factory! I have been 2 different Cheesecake factory and both times were great!  There was a bit of a wait for a table, but the good food and dessert was totally worth the wait.  I got the Ahi tuna and my boyfriend got a pasta dish.  The food came quickly and was delicious!  When dessert came, we got the peanut butter cheesecake and it was amazing! Definitely want to come back here when I get a chance!  Highly recommended."
Sterling H.,"Seattle, WA",0,103,2,1.0,12/25/2013,"We arrived there and in the party were six people and one three-month baby.  We were told there was going to be a 30 minute wait and it turned out to be a lot longer than that, more like 60 minutes. I was given a pager like always before.  We stood outside because there was no room inside to stand, at one point my niece had to take the baby inside because it was getting extremely cold outside. At about 35-40 minutes, I walked in and asked where we were in the process and I was told that the pager had gone off and my name had been called.  First of all not everyone can fit who is waiting in the restaurant, that is simple not possible.  Second, there was a significant amount of people outside waiting. Third, at not one time did the pager ever flash so right off the bat we have an issue with a defunct pager and a process of getting people fairly in to a table not working.  When I complained I was told that someone phone called me.  That would have entailed someone asking for my phone number from the get go and that did not happen.  Nor did anyone walk outside to ask people or call out any names.   What makes me mad?  Defunct pager?  Or one of your staff outright lying or having to stand outside with a three month old baby.   Here is my suggestion: 1. Have a process if you do not have a customer come up within 1 minute of having their pager go off, call out their name inside and outside. 2. Take a cell phone number if the above fails. 3. Test your pagers once a month to make sure they are still working. This has left a very bad taste in our mouth and probably will not be back again.  Having said that your food was awesome and the waiter was outstanding."
Mike C.,"Bellevue, WA",0,4,,4.0,11/30/2014,One of my favorite restaurants. I enjoy that they are able to always give awesome service and good tasting food. Thanks again Cheesecake Factory for running such a highly productive franchise around the country.

Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, WA",105,499,248,3.0,7/8/2008,"Thursday, July 24, 2008: My second visit to the Cheesecake Factory because one of my friends had convinced me that I probably went on a bad day.  It was really busy today -- long waiting line. Waited 20 (or so) minutes to get seated. Not that big of a deal. :) I didn't get a chance to order because the server assumed my friend ordered for me when in fact he ordered a bunch just for himself. I wasn't too terribly hungry, so I only ordered the tiramisu (hopefully this time it would be better).  Guess what? I'm having diarrhea right now. :( =============================== I humbly entered the tall-ceiling restaurant last Sunday with two peers. It was my first visit to the o'famous Cheesecake Factory. We approached the counter where the host wrote one of our names on the board. ""It'll be around 10 minutes,"" he said, then looked away. We walked ourselves to the waiting area and waited. I looked around. We're the only people waiting! Oh! I see empty tables there and there and there and there! No idea. Five minutes past. Ten minutes past. Fifteen minutes past. Huh? We went to the counter and discovered the host was gone! ""Have you guys been helped,"" said a lady behind us.  ""No. We've been waiting for almost twenty minutes and the host said it would only be ten. Now, he's no where to be found,"" one of my friends said. The lady checked the board and told us it would be another ten minutes. We waited...another fifteen minutes. ""Chris!"" a man cried. I've waited so long that I've forgotten my friend's name. Well, even he couldn't remember his own name when it was called. Luckily, we remember just in time before the host made us wait another 30 minutes.  We were seated in one of the empty tables that I spotted earlier. :) Our server took our order, brought us our drinks and food, asked how we were doing, gave us the bill and a togo box. YaDaDa! Nothing interesting there. Our food took a while. It was only lukewarm when it finally came out. My friends ordered a pizza and I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. The pizza looked cold and the cheese was not melty like when it comes out of a pizza box. My pasta looked dry. Not very appetizing and surely continued to ruin my experience. For that place to be called Cheesecake Factory, I really expected more to their cheesecakes and not just more whipped cream. The cheesecake I ordered was somewhat bland AND grainy. The tiramisu made one of my friends sick. I had a bite and tasted alcohol! I couldn't taste any of the goodness and yumminess that you should get from a tiramisu. All I tasted was alcohol.  Great first impression. :("
