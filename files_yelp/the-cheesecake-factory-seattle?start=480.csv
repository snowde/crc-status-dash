Jerry L.,"Seattle, WA",141,125,,1.0,12/26/2009,"Ok.. Class..Repeat after me.  ""I will not go to The Cheesecake Factory!"" Yes. I went to The Cheesecake Factory for a going away party. The place was full of tourists and people who just don't know any better. The place was big, crowded and reminded me of a place in Vegas with the faux art. I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon and boy.. was it herbie. Herbie to a point that I couldn't taste the salmon. The food was mediocre and pricey ($19.95). The service was good and that was the only good thing about this place.   Ok.. Class is dismissed."
Katelyn C.,"Portland, OR",0,9,,1.0,9/25/2013,"Recieved a chicken lettuce wraps with raw (pink, partially frozen) chicken. It took me a few bites to realize. I showed them and they took it away.... and subsequently they acted like it was a huge favor to not charge me for the dish. I was very disappointed in their service."
Amy C.,"Marysville, WA",0,19,,2.0,9/18/2013,"Pros: Cheesecake. Cons:  -Waited for 45+ minutes -99% sure the ""turkey burger"" we ordered was defrosted from being frozen... -Switched waiters/waitresses every single time I've been there (4) which isn't a big deal but every time? Basically... this place is not worth going to. The decor of the restaurant is misleading in that it leads consumers to believe it's a classy place with high class food. Wrong. Just get cheesecake..."
J T.,"Bothell, WA",0,29,,5.0,11/10/2014,Breakfast here on the weekends is amazing. Been here many times and love the breakfast option most in downtown Seattle.
Eric C.,"Burnaby, Canada",117,61,,3.0,11/21/2010,"Impossibly large menu with too many options.  I rarely complain about having options, but it's always tough making a decision on what to eat because of the menu's expansive menu. Everything they make is decent, but I have yet to try something that made me want to come back for any particular reason. It's never been my first option when choosing a place to eat. A warning for light eaters... The portions are enormous. Oh and if you thought that dark and flavourful bread had chocolate in it, you were mistaken. It's made with molasses. Trust me, I asked."
Mike L.,"Seattle, WA",53,17,,5.0,2/10/2012,"Love this place... Try the chicken and biscuits, it doesn't disappoint!"
Adelina W.,"Vancouver, Canada",32,249,85,4.0,5/16/2010,"I was really surprised by the food here.  I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory and have been avoiding it in my travels to the states.  I ordered a chicken burger and it was delicious.  It was piled so hight I had difficulties eating it.  The fries were SO good.  There was the perfect crunch to potato ratio and it was well seasoned.  My dining companion had a burger and that was really good as well.  Their house salad is just average.   Service was average.  We were there just after the lunch crowd and it was difficult to get the attention of our server.  I think we tried to get the attention of our server for at least 10 minutes before someone noticed and directed him our way. Portions are huge and I couldn't finish it.  I was so stuffed and couldn't order any dessert.  Next time I'm in the city, I'm so there to try their cheesecake!"
Alli D.,"Seattle, WA",90,487,20,2.0,10/24/2009,"Oh ick.  First of all, don't get me started on how my friend, who was entertaining a first-time-Seattle-visitor-from-England, decided to take him HERE. I mean, really, there wasn't a more original option to choose? And don't get me started about the uncomfortably awkward server, who would unnerve you by repeating everything you said, and being waayyy too formal for a glorified Red Robin. And I can't even talk about the novel-slash-menu, filled with enticing-sounding dishes, but when you looked at the nutrition information you didn't even want to order a salad.  Three days later, I'm still finding it difficult to form words due to the oil slick made in my mouth by the pasta I had. This is maybe the first time ever when I had three days worth of leftovers but haven't wanted to revisit the experience.  And don't ask about the over-packaging they do when you have a doggie bag or order cheesecake to go. Huge containers, plus a plastic back to carry i home in? Not necessary. With all this stuff I can't talk about, there's not much I can say about the Cheesecake Factory. Err...the bathroom was nice?"
Jasmine T.,"Burnaby, Canada",66,366,95,5.0,10/21/2010,"I want to live here... not near here, but here! The interior is beautiful and we got to sit in a huge booth. We got a seat pretty quickly, but we had to wait for our server forever... it must a been a busy night. He did bring water and bread eventually. I love it when restaurants have warm bread. The breads were wonderfully soft. Since we had gorged on seafood earlier, I was only here for cheesecake. Each of us got a different cheesecake, so I got to sample a few. I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake... when the heck am I ever gonna see that kind again? My fiance got the Dulce de Leche one, one friend got the Tiramisu one and another got the peanut butter one.  The Red Velvet one was a layer of cake, a layer of cheesecake, another layer of cake, another layer of cheesecake and a thick layer of icing. This was good... Everything just worked so well together! The cake was the right colour and moist. The icing was different from the cheesecake. I made a huge mistake of reading the Nutritional List... eeps, I will have to do serious diet penance for this one.  Dulce de Leche was awesome! The cheesecake is how I always imagined perfect cheesecake to be with a hint of caramel. The whip cream with nuts makes it even better. I could only eat half. My fiance could only eat half. There was no way I was wasting this, so I scooped it into the takeaway container and brought it back to our hotel. I even got some forks. I should have set my alarm so I could eat it in the middle of the night."
Sarah M.,"Issaquah, WA",260,1036,,3.0,9/18/2008,"I'm not sure why but I keep receiving gift cards to come to this place. From friends, from family...everyone seems to think that I love this place when reality, it's really...meh.  They've got one of the hugest menus I've ever seen in my life! It looks like a freaking novel! I've had some random things there before...thai pasta with chicken, some kind of stew or goulash, among a few other things. It's nothing to write home about...it's a chain restaurant that produces ridiculous quantities of food...what do you expect? It's edible though and usually pretty accomodating for large parties.  If you are a cheesecake fan, I'd go there just for cheesecake. Or take the cheesecake home and box it up. One way or another, with the gigantic portions, there's no way you'll be able to consume a meal and cheesecake."
Maxi G.,"Blue Ridge, GA",0,29,,2.0,3/22/2013,"My husband and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night and while the staff was very nice the food was only ok.  I had the salmon special, which came in a wine sauce and had some veggies and mashed potatoes on the side.  It tasted better than my husband's fried shrimp platter, which seemed to be the processed shrimp that you find in the frozen food isle.  Both entrees were around $20.   One thing that really bothered us both, was that the silverware is placed directly on the table, instead of on a napkin or plate that keeps it off the dirty table surface.  While tables are wiped down between customer use, don't fool yourself, there is no disinfecting going on with that process.   The cheesecake was delicious."
Jando S.,"Queens, New York, NY",2562,3285,14346,3.0,6/2/2007,"Chain ridden, fat driven establishments like these were the reason why I avoided the Portland location for the longest time, but it wasn't until someone lured me into the Seattle location that I decided to sell my soul to the cheesecake devil.  The big restaurant is spacious and full of a wait staff who are cringing to serve you. My first impression was how amazed I was over the eclectic menu that had a little bit of everything from Italian specialties to Spanish tapas to phad thai.  Clearly they're looking to appease just about everyone and I've been most pleased with their Sunday Brunch and Hungarian Beef Goulash.  Prices are about as spendy as a Caribbean resort.  I could've purchased a new furniture set for the living room for our group with the high price tags per meal item.  At least the $10 quesadillas taste good. The highlights are always the dessert as it is their main specialty.  Clearly the West Coast version of Junior's Cheesecake has the upper hand as the vanilla bean cheesecake was one of the best I've had!  It was creamy, had an amazing texture, was extremely fresh and probably would've killed me if I had another order."
J. A.,"Bothell, WA",0,7,,5.0,7/29/2013,"We had a very good time, great service, fantastic food, not too loud, fast serve, prices not too high, everything was good. The service lady was happy and bubbly and went way beyond expectations.  We had a service dog with us and she brought a bowl of water for her.  A small amount of leftovers were discarded by mistake (we had asked for a bag), so they cooked the whole dish again and gave us an entire second entree serving to take home! The Seattle store is a neat place.  Lavishly decorated. Could not have been better.  The cheesecake fulfilled our expectations. It was our first visit to this restaurant. Oh, they do not take reservations, despite what it says on Yelp's profile.  We got there at 5 pm on a Monday and did not have to wait long.  Later on, there were a lot of people waiting."
Victoria T.,"Louisville, KY",305,827,31,2.0,2/1/2008,"I can not be bothered to wait for a table at The Cheesecake Factory.  I do not like the cheesecake.  It's not my thing.  I do, however, like the garlic noodles.  I will order them from the take out counter.  That's it. That mob of suburbanites in the city to party down at the chain restaurant before heading over to the AMC theater is just too much for me to handle."
Vincent V.,"Seattle, WA",63,44,,3.0,4/29/2010,"This restaurant has a very dark mood lighting. Which would be great if I was a guy trying to get a hand job under the dining table and get away with it.  I was on a first date with a deaf guy who was also blind in one eye. Can you imagine that for a second, trying to use sign language in the dark with someone who's basically Helen Keller!? But that's not why i'm giving this place 3 stars.  The food was okay. The waitress acted like Kate Middleton. The creepy trailer park couple sitting across from us kept staring. Children throwing straws. Teenagers being retarded and using words like ""YOLO,"" a cramped 2 seater table with no arm or leg room for someone my size at 6'2'' and the general lack of swiftness. Perhaps if it's taking 65 minutes to serve and dismiss each table you should hire more kitchen staff and wait staff. Just an observation.  After the check I grabbed my coat and ran out like I was trying to escape a burning building, almost forgetting about the guy I came with.  I would go here again with a reservation, knowing what I wanted to order in advance, sitting in a booth not a table, and perhaps with someone who can speak loudly.  The Godiva cheesecake was nice at least."
Lor B.,"Seattle, WA",46,393,28,4.0,8/17/2012,"Yes. I'm dining at a chain. and I actually like it. ALOT. I've dined here just a few days ago - but was also here last month. It was consistently good. Here's what we found best:  Salisbury steak (tastes better than it sounds on the menu), meatloaf (good if you are craving this,  bistro shrimp pasta -(light and a nice twist with the battered shrimp), ask to keep the cream light.  the best part of the experience was the kid's menu --  my son goes to town with the bow tie pasta in alfredo sauce - there are other options to choose as well - but he loves this.  (they come in big servings, so you'll have enough for lunch the next day).  Cheesecake in my opinion was too sweet (we had the snickers).  the place is packed and full of groups.  It makes sense when you have a book of a menu!  I'll be sure to update when I find more dishes that are noteworthy.  Service was swift and drinks are big. I don't know how any one can NOT bring a home a doggie bag here??  I'm a fan. a closet-one. but a fan nonetheless :)"
Sarah B.,"Seattle, WA",640,688,424,4.0,10/4/2009,"Oh no a chain!  Well yes, indeed, you are correct.   But they are actually quite good for what they are.  And this is coming from someone who really doesn't care for cheesecake.   We came over as a group during PAX, which meant a wait of course but seriously, a 15 minute wait during a conference and at peak hours was not bad.   Our server was perky and polite.  But the menu, it's as insane as everyone as commented!  Truly it's a task to make sense of it or to find something you would like.  Then you need to be concerned about sizes.  Since everything here is based on the scale that you are a 10 ft giant with a super fast metabolism.  Yeah.... right..... And then you have that whole menu of cheesecake.  Thankfully I can just skip that since it invokes nausea.  The food however does not.  Ordering the smaller sizes and appetizers was the way to go. Plenty to share and not too many leftovers. Overall, a good experience when you are stuck downtown.  But expect tourists and waits."
k e.,"Mercer Island, WA",0,22,,5.0,6/14/2011,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory?  Well, beside the wait. The miso salmon is the best!"
Claudia M.,"Everett, WA",24,31,11,5.0,1/21/2011,"What can be said about cheesecake factory that hasn't been said yet? Great place, great food, most of the times excellent service, cakes and cheesecakes to die for, and gooood drinks! Love the place! Recommendations? For appetizer get the avocado rolls, dessert? the black out cake if you are a chocolate lover, drink? mojito!, breakfast? carne asada, the orange chicken and the three cheese pasta are excellent, don't order ribs 'cause they're not good."
Michelle W.,"Marysville, WA",11,131,17,5.0,9/29/2012,"Excellent downtown foodie delight, right next to the theater, so enjoy both. Tall ceilings, glass everywhere, just a lot of fun for not too much money. Loved the pizza between the three of us and a scrumptious cheesecake each to enjoy. Ambience was amazing. Just a beautiful restaurant."
