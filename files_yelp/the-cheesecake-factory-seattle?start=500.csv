Joshua H.,"Seattle, WA",2,10,,5.0,3/4/2011,"""Jim Beam on the Rocks w/ a splash of water and a Cobb Salad with no bleu cheese please"" *smile I love this place... I can read a book, eat a great tossed salad, drink my Jim Beam and be at peace... the food is great, or at least the salads are; I tend to stick to what I like.  AND it's entertaining listening to the staff put up with the convention people... I felt horrible the day it was a convention for Baptist Women's something another... the whole place filled with middle aged ladies and big hats. Or the Animation Conventions... I've lived in Seattle my whole life and it's pretty diverse here, but some of the kids coming out of those conventions... do their parents know they wear that? Cheesecake Factory I show you some love... & ""no, I won't be having a cheesecake, but thank you"""
Ashley P.,"Tacoma, WA",1,24,,4.0,3/2/2013,"My daughter and I just got back from this location. She had alfredo and I got a few of the small plates. Ahi tuna tartar, chicken samosas, and crispy crab cake. With a drink and 2 desserts it came out to 54$. It was worth it. The menu is ridiculously large and it took me about 15 min to actually read through it all. It was loud and super crowded due to comicon but our server was attentive and the rest of the staff was very friendly. Going back soon."
K A.,"Sacramento, CA",168,83,,3.0,2/17/2010,"After a week of decadent eating, my boyfriend and I decided to stop at the downtown Cheesecake Factory for a casual meal. We got seating near the big windows, with great natural light and perfect for people watching downtown. Our waiter, Jed, was friendly and attentive, and our food came out fast.  This CCF was clean, fast and friendly, so I would definitely visit again. The scariest part was the nutritional guide they left on our table with the menus. Some on the calorie counts can really ruin your meal!! Needless to say, we didn't order any actual cheesecake."
Charlotte S.,"Seattle, WA",104,7,,2.0,3/17/2012,Normally I don't have an issue at cheesecakes factory however today my mother and I waited a longer then average amount of time for our drinks. Our food was also late out due to being taken to the wrong table. There was a shift change in the middle of our meal at which time we discovered that our original waitor hadn't notified our new waitress of a to-go order we had placed so it never got started. When she retook the order she told is we couldn't have onion rings which the original waiter neglected to tell us and when I finally got home across town and my boyfriend open his container we discovered someone else's order. Which was also not very tasty. I'm very disappointed in today's experience and probably wont be back for awhile.
Elizabeth B.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,1.0,9/27/2009,"In general, I would give Cheesecake Factory about 3 stars, but this location has disappointed me one too many times to deserve any more than 1 star. My biggest pet peeve is that they can't seem to grasp the basic concept of bringing the appetizer BEFORE the entree. I usually get between 0-2 minutes to eat my salad before trying to squeeze the next plate onto the table. Complaints have been met with a unconvincing ""sorry,"" a blank stare, and my favorite, ""You told me you wanted them at the same time"" (when I hadn't even been asked). Next time I was at the Bellevue location, I actually asked if the CF policy had changed to bringing apps and entrees at the same time, and was met with a horrified, ""That should never happen."" But sure enough, yesterday, in Seattle, I had only a minute to eat a salad before the pasta came. To be fair, I think the server forgot to put in my order, since everyone else in my party got their appetizers some minutes earlier and I had to ask him where my salad was. No matter how good a meal is (and CF's are usually decent, if not great), when you're made to race through an appetizer to keep your entree from getting cold, it's never a good meal experience. The servers at CF are normally very friendly and helpful, but yesterday we had a very rude waiter. He aggressively pushed us to order more food for every course, acted like he'd been slapped when my friend chose ""no dressing"" on her side salad, and then argued with me for several minutes about my friend's raw apple crisp. She didn't want to make a fuss about the fact that her dessert had huge globs of runny, uncooked dough in it, and so I finally decided to let it go, but I've never had a waiter be so unhelpful and combative. My friend's husband had a nice philosophy for tipping him, though: For bad service, never stiff a waiter on the tip; they'll just think you're a jerk. Instead, give them a really small tip; then they'll now it was because THEY were a jerk."
Ferdmeister V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,135,73,4.0,4/22/2012,"This place never disappoints me, always a sure thing when you eat here.  The food is great no matter which one you go to.  Within walking distance from the hotels in downtown so not a bad walk after a large dinner."
John L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",6,196,5,1.0,9/13/2011,"I had the factory burger it is a simple burger with grilled onions cheddar cheese and tomato. How you serve a burger with cheese and not melt the cheese is just wrong and how about toast the roll while you are at it so it is a cold roll a cold tomato and a cold piece of cheese and a soon to be cold burger and another thing I hate the service by committee I don't want one person to take my order another to bring my drink the none English speaking busboy brings my food and my waiter coming by later with ""is everything ok"" I am thinking who the hell are you? I am over this place and the chain thing in general later."
Evan D.,"Vancouver, Canada",4,148,,1.0,8/27/2012,Gigantic menu but the food was blah. Under our table was lots of food from the previous customers. Serving staff were eccentric.  No prices on the menu for mixed drinks.
Christine R.,"Bremerton, WA",235,338,183,3.0,6/7/2010,"This is a review for the bar area only. Drink service is quick and efficient and since we ordered their namesake, they did it justice!!! My girlfriends and I ordered the Oreo Cheesecake, vanilla bean cheesecake and their red velvet cheesecake. They were so delicious- although my favorite Cheesecake hales from Juniors Cheesecake from NYC- and thank goodness they now deliver!! I'm only giving it 3 starts because, at times it did seem they had forgotten us, and again- we were sitting in the bar- it seemed our waitress wanted to shoo us away and get it set up for other dinners.  Overall cheesecake was good- not mouth watering, tonguetasmic tasting- but if you're in the area worth trying- not sure the long waits would warrant a visit here, but def worth a visit."
Eunice K.,"Seattle, WA",22,29,12,2.0,8/12/2008,"I don't know what to say about this place. I've had good and bad experiences with it. But the good experience was because my boyfriend went to high school with our waiter, so she was really nice to us. This was probably awhile ago, actually, it was I think March when I went. I was hanging out with my friend and her two other friends. They're really picky eaters so we decided on the cheesecake factory. My God. I was incredibly pissed that night. We waited 15 minutes for a table, not too bad. We were sat down, then another group of people sat down next to us about 5 minutes later? We had the same waitress, but for some reason she gave the group next to us their water first and took their order first. I flipped one when this happened. Shouldn't it be first come first serve? When we finally received our waters, I asked for a straw. It never came. The service was horrible. I'm not too sure whether to say it was because we were young looking (we were all 21, but we often get mistaken for 16-18) Or whether the quality of customer service has gone down. The only redeeming factor is my mom loves the cheesecake here. I will never ever come back here again. Except to get my mom some cheesecake to go whenever she craves it. Hahahahahaha"
Amber A.,"Eugene, OR",0,68,,4.0,8/4/2014,We waited in line outside for 40 minutes.  The front desk was friendly and the wait staff was very nice.  The food was okay but the price of the food was spendy for what it was!
Rudy W.,"Oakland, CA",54,367,48,3.0,5/1/2012,great place in downtown Seattle. not sure why Cheesecake always attract many patron. the food is not all that great and their prices is not all that cheap either. the decor is nice.
Ema C.,"Seattle, WA",85,339,69,5.0,8/15/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory was able to make the grilled portabella mushroom sandwich with no cheese/dairy and it was still tasty! Granted, I've never had a slice of cheesecake here but their mushroom sandwich and french fries are YUMMY! With my lactose intolerance, I find it awesome that I can eat here because they were still able to make a delicious sandwich dairy-free! :) If you're over 21 and it's packed as hell, you can get a seat in the bar area and still order food there. Just make sure it's for a party of 2 at the most."
Denis B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",35,55,3,3.0,3/10/2013,Normally I like the CCF but not ths one. they served my fish with missing veggies and lemon sauce. They fix it but I have to wait agaın and fish was raw.
Tallon C.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,3,,5.0,1/4/2013,"You don't go for the food, it's the cheesecake you go for. They have the absolute best cheesecake ever I swear. This particular Cheesecake Factory is usually packed with people though. The food is good, but for the prices I guess could be better. I am in it for the cheesecake."
Lanny K.,"Spokane, WA",105,225,12,2.0,2/9/2009,"Um... APPARENTLY it's now the LAW to provide patrons with a nutritional guide. WHAT THE HELL?! I do NOT want to know that my more-than generous helping of mediocre pasta is 3400 calories. I just DON'T. NOR Am I interested in the fun fact of how many calories is in that slice of cheesecake I am now NOT going to get (by the way, it was 1400) If I'd eaten all my food and cheesecake, I would have had a five THOUSAND calorie dinner. That's fucking gross. I'm never eating here again. It was fine to indulge when I was oblivious and could pretend it was all calorie free. There's nothing left. The food isn't worth it.  I really hate chain restaurants, but I stopped in for convenience. Forgive me food gods, I have sinned. P.S. I saw Derek Jeter here once last summer. He is a megadouche. So... there you go."
T.L. T.,"Anchorage, AK",4,174,10,2.0,4/6/2012,"Nice appetizer selection, but it's not great tasting. For a chain restaurant it's ok in the entree dept.  Buy a cookbook, you'll do better and your stomach will too.  Don't bother with the salmon, it's farmed which means no taste and gross texture. Ugh!  The food doesn't really live up to description on the menu.  Stick with the cheesecake, that's what the creative genius' in the kitchen should have done. On a high note, the servers are wonderful, and very attentive."
C B.,"Everett, WA",0,118,3,3.0,4/5/2012,"Our first venture in to this ""iconic"" restaurant.  The place itself is very ornate and well maintained.  The first thing you see is the huge cheesecake display...who cares about eating real food at that point!  But, we did have lunch.  My son enjoyed the herb-crusted salmon with asparagus and said it was very tasty.  His only complaint was that, here we are in the Pacific NW, heart of the best salmon in the world and this place serves what appears to be Atlantic salmon.  Not nearly as much flavor as our terrific Pacific salmon choices.  I enjoyed a ""skinny menu"" meal, the Mexican Chicken/tortilla salad, sans sour cream.  It was huge and at only 590 calories, was both delicious (loved the guacamole sauce) and filling.  Consequently, we had no room for cheesecake, but the table next to us was enjoying several flavors.  We heard everything from ""too sweet"" to OMG... The price was reasonable for the area, though $33 for two lunches could be considered excessive to some."
Joshua B.,"McKinney, TX",90,236,329,4.0,1/26/2012,Besides the long wait to be seated I love the huge variety of choices on the menu. Great food especially the avocado eggrolls.
Mary M.,"Seattle, WA",138,313,7,2.0,2/27/2011,"I love The Cheesecake Factory but just not on a crowded Saturday night. Wait was about 30 minutes since we forgot to make reservations. Server was awesome. Loved the buffalo blast but our cajun jambalaya pasta didn't taste like the the past 5 times I've had it. It was just lacking sauce, spice and maybe too much pasta or water in the pasta? We informed the server and he brought out more sauce which turned it from bad to eatable. The cheesecake is always amazing so we shared a slice of that. So I would recommend coming during the non peak hour where the cooks are not rushed and can put some TLC in your food."
