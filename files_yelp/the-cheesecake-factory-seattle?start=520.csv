Tierra K.,"Olympia, WA",73,13,,5.0,4/23/2012,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory last weekend. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and it's probably one of the best dishes I've ever had. I'm pregnant and since we got back home all I can think about is this pasta! I can't wait to go back! The Key Lime cheesecake is to die for. Now if they'd just put a Cheesecake Factory down in Olympia I'd be all set!"
Gary K.,"Vancouver, WA",1,20,2,3.0,2/23/2014,The cheesecake and the service were good. The food was mediocre and overpriced. With all that money they're pulling in on overpriced food you'd think they would splurge on some water glasses which for some strange reason comes in a beer mug that's seen better days.
Mindy H.,"Seattle, WA",220,27,,4.0,2/27/2010,"I came here for my birthday. I went on a weekday, so it was a lot less crowded than usual. If you're going to go on a day that's often busy, I don't see why you're going to complain about waiting long unless it's your first time there and you didn't know. You chose to go there, and I'm betting you knew it would be a long wait. Boo hoo. The service was friendly and quick. Our first server went on break, and the replacement was horrid. She didn't smile and she was snappy, but the other two servers we encountered and our original were just awesome. There was one specific dude who was just freakishly funny. The food came fast. Selection is nuts, but I feel like everything in each category is about the same just altered slightly. The only thing that bothers me is that their Cheesecake menu doesn't list prices of each cake slice, only a range at the very end. I hate cheesecake,but I quite liked theirs. Now, for a nutrition freak like me, I about died when I saw the nutritional menu. Most of my friends and I only finished about half the plates though. And when you're eating out, what do you really expect? The cheesecake is the real thing you have to worry about in terms of nutritional value. Those slices are huge. And they are so, so bad for you. I shared one and I still felt so guilty. Price was average for the size and considering that it is dinner and you are eating out. The interior works for both casual and dressy. You could go in there with jeans and a tee shirt or in a dress (like we all did) and you'd still fit right in. And since it was my birthday, they gave me a little sundae. It was absolutely delicious. And they sang a song. It was embarrassing, but the waiter that I absolutely adore? He made me laugh so hard during the song with his unique personality, it was worth it. The waitress also gladly gave us separate checks, and remembered what all nine of us each ordered. I don't know if she wrote it on her pad or not, but if she didn't, maaaaaan what is she doing waiting tables with that kind of memory? I can pretty much say that when I get a legit job again, I will be coming here more often than just a couple times a year. Oh, and the leftovers taste delicious. Just .. don't get the four cheese pasta if you're expecting to take it home and eat it the next day. My best friend did, and she slept over. She microwaved it to eat and the cheese was just ... a disgusting clump."
Vicki K.,"Everett, WA",2,84,,4.0,12/27/2009,"Even on an early Monday evening, the wait was LENGTHY.  Everytime a new group came in - regardless of the size - the hostess chirped ""about fifteen minutes"", which must be standard protocol here.  We waited at least thirty minutes.  The food is predictably good and remarkably quick given how busy they are.  Our server, ""Daniel"" was speedy and accomodating. The avocado egg rolls are a stand-out and, in general, all the portions ginormous.  My best advice: Get the yummy appetizers but split entres with another person if you cannot take your leftovers with you. (theater tickets prevented taking anything with us) Sure, it's a chain but if you're going to go to one - and feel like spending 80 bucks on lunch - this is the one to go to."
JP P.,"La Habra, CA",4,81,15,3.0,2/16/2009,Huge portion. hard to finish a plate. And what's the deal with cheesecake?  Maybe it's me I'm just not a big fan of it. Wait is always long... too long for a decent plate of meal but I like the atmosphere... won't hurt to visit once a while.
Stephen J.,"Port Orchard, WA",4,156,,4.0,2/16/2009,"I was here on Sunday for lunch and I had one of the best meals of my life. I ate the grilled salmon with mash potatoes and broccoli along with whole wheat and french bread. It was fantastic. I washed it down with a drink, I forget the name, from the cocktail menu. Every was excellent. It was crowded so I sat in the lounge.  It was my fourth time eating here and I have had no complaints. It can get crowded so be patient. While waiting they will give you a pager that goes off when your table is ready.  The prices can get high and the cocktails are overpriced, but very good. I don't drink very often, usually only once or twice a year, but I was pleased with the drink I had. Oh and the waiters are very nice and friendly."
Anne M.,"Seattle, WA",1,16,1,2.0,1/12/2011,"Came here tonight for me and my fiances anniversary. Food was fine, service sucked. Our server was pretty rude (Brian I think his name was?) totally disinterested in anything that was going on, rolled his eyes at us a few times...boo to poor service."
A ..,"Seattle, WA",173,43,12,2.0,9/10/2008,"Okay I can't even believe I'm reviewing this but it was a pretty funny night. Went here with a bunch of friends before going to see Cloverfield across the street. The giant try-everything group appetizer was good as were the drinks, except the mint julep only because my tongue doesn't like Whiskey...yet. We should have stopped there. But no, we all ordered food and out of the five of us two of our meals were completely inedible. Mine was a freakin salt lick and it was just chicken pasta, one of the easiest things in the world. eww. Anyways so the food sucked and made us all feel sick but we stumbled to the theater and the sign at the box office pretty much read: Due to the nature of this movie's blair witch-esque filming techniques, If you are sensitive to motion sickness, pregnant, old, blahblah do not see this movie. Basically if you've eaten too much bad food and washed it down with tons of cheesecake for the love of god do not see this movie. Of course we accepted the challenge and OH GOD. I wanted to explode like that girl in the contamination tent. Point being: Cheesecake factory as bad as Cloverfield. Do not combine due to risk of explosive stomach."
H C.,"Seattle, WA",1,271,66,4.0,12/20/2011,"One of the better chains for sure. The menu is huge and there is something for everyone, but because of this the wait is sometimes really long. Get the Farmhouse burger - it's to die for. The strawberry lemonade is also really yummy!"
Joshua S.,"Seattle, WA",39,183,27,3.0,9/7/2009,While convenient if you are at the convention center it is probably the least imaginative option for eating out. Beer selection could be a lot better. The food is good and the service is good like you would expect from any Cheesecake Factory. If you are looking for something familiar then this is the place to be.
Matt R.,"Edmonds, WA",169,264,84,3.0,7/30/2008,"Plus 5 stars for awesome cheesecake.  Expensive?  Yes.  Regardless of cost, I dare you to not find a good flavor on their extensive cheesecake menu.  If you can't find one, we have to talk. Minus one star for the wait.  Their dinners and meals aren't that good.  Definitely not worth an hour-plus wait.  Eat somewhere else and get a slice of cheesecake to go. Minus yet another star for their menu.  I'm a fan of variety, but their menu is overkill.  You've got fish tacos, pasta, salad, steak, Thai, and burgers all duking it out on the same menu.  And those few foods I listed are just the tip of the iceberg.    I always doubt myself after I order.  ""Did I do the right thing?  That other meal a couple pages after what I got sounded pretty good also.""  Seriously, their menu is like an excessively long (and bad) short story with no satisfying ending in sight."
James S.,"Seattle, WA",608,40,4,4.0,3/8/2011,"Loved the building and the enviroment.. It felt like a vegas restaurant, a short wait followed by a descent meal.. Meatloaf was ok but the 3 slices made me feel like it was worth it.."
Kat F.,"Seattle, WA",170,351,1,3.0,4/1/2009,"In theory, I really hate the cheesecake factory.  Chain restaurants with giant menus generally underwhelm and when I was dragged here, on the verge of kicking and screaming, I didn't expect to have much of a time to remember.  To be fair to my initial opinion, there are still a dozen places that I'd rather eat on a given day.  But to be fair to CF (I'm a libra, it's all about the fairness with us) I haven't had a bad meal here.  The portions are HUGE.  Now, I generally eat my own weight in food each day, but at CF I eat until I am full and then usually have enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  I'm a fan of the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (eggplant and sundried tomatoes, among other things) and the fried mac n cheese appetizer (cheesier than the Icon Grill version.)   The cheesecake itself is never a bad idea, but I prefer to split a piece because even a half is enough to make me worry about a diabetic coma.   The waiters here are fine.  Some are nice, helpful, professional; others are nowhere to be found and seemingly reluctant to answer questions about the menu.  Whatever, it's what I expect from a chain."
Carolina R.,"Seattle, WA",0,18,,2.0,10/23/2013,"every time i come, it gets worse. experience one:  server doesnt bring bread, we had to ask for it she takes it after we tell her we were still eating it food took long and she didnt say why.. it wasnt that packed drinks were horrible, too light for the price cheesecake was good food was mediocre, and very very dry experience two: server brings bread but not water after we asked for it only brings half of us water forgets half the order and half of that half wasnt even written down my beverage came out half filled, like actually with all the ice and liquid in this cup it only got to half the cup itself.  food comes out an hour after we order cheesecake comes out half hour after we asked for it took twenty minutes to get the tab, another 25 to get our card back.  and the food was worse than before, i got the same plate. taste is not consistent here. which is a shame because you would expect it, for the size and location, to be better at this. the bellevue location is by far the best cheesecake factory i have been to"
J C.,"Seattle, WA",10,226,41,2.0,9/18/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a different story every time I try it someplace new.  Here, it's not that great.  In Denver, it's fantastic.  In Kansas City, it's amazing... maybe it's just me.  The location of this one BLOWS, too, if you're not gonna walk to it."
Dusan S.,"Seattle, WA",36,82,,4.0,6/15/2011,"Reading these reviews I'm starting to think I was extremely lucky coming here. It was not busy at all and we got seated right away. We got bread and butter, and I particularly liked one of the breads. OK, the menu is kinda huge. It's like a freakin' book. I wasn't hungry so I skipped right to the cheesecake and that helped. My friend ordered some sort of Vietnamese tacos, and I had a bite. They were very good.  I got the raspberry truffle cheesecake and she had the Lemoncello cake. Mine was heavenly. And huge. Sure it's kinda pricey but it's like two slices in one. The Lemoncello cake which I also had a bite of was good but not excellent.  I decided to get a slice of the peanut butter cheesecake to go (not the Reese's but the other kind). It too was just pure amazing. Our server was helpful and friendly, although maybe a tad too friendly. This was all on a weekday in the middle of the day, so I think we were lucky enough to avoid all the craziness I hear about. That being said, I'm sure I'll be back but I'm gonna make sure it's not rush hour :)"
Brad F.,"Seattle, WA",101,89,4,3.0,9/27/2008,"The cheesecake is the best outside of New York City.  And if you ever go to New York City, do yourself a huge favor and go to Junior's near Times Square. I like the food here too, but it is SO overpriced for the quality.  I am not impressed with the service there, and the waits are really, really long.  This is obviously not the restaurant's fault, but be aware of it before you go. Your best bet is to get some cheesecake to go from the counter at the front of the restaurant."
Binks P.,"Seattle, WA",3,20,6,1.0,8/2/2008,"I have no beef with the cheesecake.  It's good.  And on Wednesdays, it's only  $1.50!  Totally a great deal. The food, however, is crap.  (I've been dragged to Cheesecake Factories on both U.S. coasts, and my stomach is full of rocks for a full day afterwards.)  It's all really bland, to say nothing of the fact that it's overpriced.  I can't cook worth beans, but I've made a better pasta and marinara sauce out of a can than what I've had at the Cheesecake Factory. Also, it's always really crowded, and every time a friend drags me there (hey, I do things I hate for my friends), it's always been at least a 20 minute wait.   The mixed drinks are not very strong (as well as overpriced), so the wine, beer, and straight liquor are the safest bets. Go for the $1.50 cheesecake on Wednesdays.  The cheesecake menu is phenomenal. Nothing else is. * * * There's better, cheaper food at a ton of restaurants within walking distance! * * *"
alfred i.,"North York, Canada",75,44,2,5.0,8/4/2011,My favorite Cheesecake Factory. And I never had run for desert!
Kristina L.,"Seattle, WA",32,259,9,2.0,6/2/2009,"My family LOVES the Cheesecake Factory.  Needless to say, whenever they are in town, guess where we go?  I'm not a huge fan of this place, but it's not horrible, I would in fact call in alright.  Since I've been there so many times I've tried lots of dishes, I will say I dislike more than I like, but here are some suggestions. Thai Lettuce Wraps - these are very good.  It's bib lettuce served with grilled chicken, noodles, carrot, bean sprouts, cucumber and three sauces, spicy peanut, cilantro and another one that's kinda like teriyaki (but not really).  They are messy though, be sure to ask for a moist towel when you're finished. BBW Ranch Chicken Salad - Entirely TOO BIG, but good. It actually reminds me of a southwest salad because of the ingredients but--don't let it scare you, its served with a BBQ ranch.  I wasn't sure about this at first, but the server recommended it, and I'm a fan now. Baja Chicken Tacos - this portion size isn't as enormous as other dishes.  It's served with three tacos on corn tortillas.  Not the most authentic in terms of mexican but I do enjoy them on occasion. Grilled Chicken Medallions - The chicken has a balsamic glaze and it's pretty tasty.  The chicken has been dry a few times.  This portion is king-sized as well. Other than that, their strawberry lemonade is pretty good.  I had the Godiva cheesecake and between my bf and I, we had maybe three bites--in their defence, we aren't desert people and it was way too rich, like cheesecake is!  The chocolate coconut, dulce de leche and white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecakes are good.  They serve bread with dinner - an oatwheat and sourdough.  Service can be lacking at times.  Most of the time there's a long wait, once we were told to wait 30 minutes, we ended up waiting 1.5 hours (several people who came in after us were sat before us, both small and large parties).  I eventually spoke with the manager and a table magically appeared to us, but no apology, most places at least give you a free dessert, or something, but not here.  I felt incredibly neglected."
