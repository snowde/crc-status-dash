Shannon E.,"Everett, WA",62,63,15,2.0,6/25/2010,"Ok, this place is overrated. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because obviously, it's well known for it's million delicious flavors of cheesecake. The food is insanely mediocre for how large the portions are and how expansive the menu is. The only thing I've ever liked when I came here were the avocado egg rolls, and the cheesecake. Their food doesn't stand out at all. I have to say the wait is horrendous. No matter if you have a reservation or not. The only credit I'll give them for this is because it's in the heart of downtown Seattle. When in Seattle, pass this up. If your going to be touristing this city especially, don't go eat at a chain restaurant that you can eat no matter where you're at. Try some of Seattle's other prized restaurants."
Stas G.,"Seattle, WA",65,28,2,4.0,6/3/2011,"About as commercial as it gets and every savory dish is loaded with sodium but it is consistently delicious, very reasonably priced, serves large portions, and compared to the rest of Seattle it is open late. Fills you up and never lets you down!"
Yang Y.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,5.0,10/22/2011,"Almost zero walking distance if you stay in Sheraton Seattle. Spectacular ambiance compared a few other CCF I have been to, good service, reasonable priced menu(including skinny menu). The cheesecake really makes you happy! You will get every penny of your money well spent."
Tiffany M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,196,164,4.0,6/5/2009,"Ok i love this place! The Good: The potstickers and cream cheese wontons are amazing The banana cream cheesecake is almost as good as moms! The portion are completely sharable!  The pizzas are even yummy! The Bad: They remove amazing items off thier menu too often.  I loved the pesto chicken pasta dish!! ate it all the time. but they removed it. Then i ate the maple-glazed pork something or other(i dont eat pork much but this was good!!) and they removed that as well. There was a few dishes that my BF loved that have since gone too :(  The prices are high, mostly on drinks, if you are wanting water you are good, but if you feel like a mudslide you are paying thru the nose.  you could make a dozen mudslides for what they charge for just one :)"
Mike B.,"Seattle, WA",6,83,4,2.0,5/5/2009,"This review is based solely on the cheesecake. I've eaten at one in Boise; been to one, been to them all. It's higher on the scale than Applebees I guess, but playing in the same league. I love cheesecake. I love key lime pie even more. They have a key lime pie cheesecake I've been meaning to try. Only after waiting in the cheesecake line for 25-30 minutes did I get a slice. It was ok. Nothing fancy or spectacular. Now, I wouldn't turn away a free slice, but you won't find me standing in line for another one. On a side note, Seattle has so many places with tons more character and food within the same walking distance. Why are so many people going to this big-box store version of a restaurant?! If you're stuck in on the Eastside, sure. But Seattle?"
Evan A.,"Seattle, WA",161,4,,5.0,10/8/2011,Yes I know its a chain but when I made a simple suggestion on the Green Chili Cheeseburger they took me serious and sent me out a gift card! I will always be loyal to Cheesecake! The food is amazing and you never ger bored!
Carey T.,"Seattle, WA",93,151,127,3.0,4/3/2011,"Im a creature of habit.  When I find something that is delicious, thats what I go back for.  At Cheesecake factory, I always order the scampi & the casear salad.  Its dynamite!  The food is always on point, but the service can be hit and miss depending on who you get.  The last two times I visited, we had great service one time and less then stellar the other time.  Of course, the time it was not good was a busy Friday night.  However, it was a special occasion for us, so that made our visit and the chunk of change I plunked down to take my niece and another friend out less than worth it."
Tom Y.,"Kirkland, WA",9,116,3,4.0,6/2/2010,"mmm, cheeeesecake.  Beyond just the namesake foods here, Cheesecake Factories are a smorgasbord of everything. Really, you can find literally dozens of entrees, from salads and sandwiches to seafood and wraps. If you haven't been to one of these before, at least go once just to look at the sheer selection.  Depending on when you go and if you have a reservation, waits can be anywhere from zero seconds to 30 minutes. It's to be expected though, as this location especially, is in the heart of downtown. Don't cry about the wait if you didn't plan ahead enough to reserve a place. I will say that sometimes, you'll indeed get bumped on your reservation, but I haven't had that happen yet personally.  The food is usually of very high quality, though how it's put together may leave something to be desired. AKA, the ingredients are great and fresh, but the combination of ingredients that make an entree isn't always great. However, the portions are generous, so you'll never end up leaving hungry.  Rounding out the meal with cheesecake is always a good idea. It used to be that they had just a few flavors, but now they have many more choices, including apparently low carb cheesecake (if you're going for a cheesecake for crying out loud, don't worry about 100 extra calories :)).  It's a great place to go for groups, whether it's for a special occasion, or you just happened to be hungry and walking by. The mood inside is always festive, and because of the sheer amount of staff they have on hand, you're always guaranteed fast service. Average food, good quality, and a great location."
Michelle K.,"Seattle, WA",11,7,2,4.0,6/21/2011,"I love this place. Everything i've tried has been good and big portioned at a reasonable price. Some of my favorites are the chicken maderia, habachi steak, and the luau salad. Of course you can't come here and not try a chreesecake. Absolutely the best red velvet cheesecake ever!!!!! Only downfall I would say is good luck if you ever get a table on the weekends at the Bellevue location. Sometimes it is over an hour wait. We hardly ever go there, we always go to the downtown Seattle location."
Don M.,"Seattle, WA",31,98,54,4.0,5/23/2010,This place is great. U must have the deepfried macoroni balls. The jumbolia is very good and so is the caramel chicken. Well let's be honest it was all good food I was impressed. But I ain't cheap lol. So bring your wallet with ur appetite. And save room for desert cuz that is the best part
Sea A.,"Seattle, WA",0,13,,5.0,7/4/2013,"Caesar is great, and HUGE.  firecracker salmon (appetizer) was fantastic and authentic.  It came with an amazing sauce and a pile of red cabbage that just soaked it up.  But I'm writing this because of the Hibachi Steak. C'mon!  Nothing is that good. I can't even describe how good it was. The meat was so tender and flavorful. The asparagus tempura was awesome and the wasabi mashed potatoes were really creamy.  I just can't say enough good things about our meal. Crazy good."
Frazier Y.,"Seattle, WA",153,18,2,4.0,8/27/2011,"The best place to grab food, very convienent, and there is everything around the area. You can watch a movie down the street, there are a couple of bars too."
Ian M.,"Seattle, WA",25,13,,1.0,10/22/2007,"Want to know a nice and simple way to ruin a weekend with food poisoning?   1. Eat Phad Thai at the Cheesecake Factory on a Friday around 6pm with some family and friends for a late lunch/early dinner.  Take left over Phad Thai home. 2. Have a nice Friday night hanging out watching movies with friends, eat left over Phad Thai, thus making Cheesecake Factory Phad Thai the only thing that you've eaten for the day.   3. Go to bed. 4. Wake up at 1:45am and proceed to expel mostly undigested Phad Thai from most of your major orifices, at high velocities.  For 4 hours.  In the shower. 5. Wearily realize you've been watching the same Mung Bean Sprouts swirl around the shower drain for 15 minutes in the dazzling rays of the new dawn and that the pain, while not gone, is more a numb post-prolapse kind of pain rather than a para-prolapse kind. 6. Sleep as long as possible to give your body enough time to recover from the spice and acid burns it received on its various soft tissues/membranes. 7. Feel your ass pucker every time you see/hear the name Cheesecake Factory. The End."
Betsey S.,"Seattle, WA",218,296,18,1.0,5/31/2007,"I hate the Cheesecake Factory.  Why do people wait hours to eat here?  Why, when there are so many fabulous, unique, quality restaurants in the neighborhood?  The prices are way too high, the portions are ridiculous (I know most Americans probably adore this aspect of the Cheesecake Factory, but to me it's just gross), it's louder than Qwest Field during a Raiders game, and the service is spotty at best.  Do not get me started on the decor.  The place needs a hit from a huge spray can of Sconce-B-Gone.   On top of all that, I got food poisoning from a salad here, but hey, it WAS a truly large salad, containing probably two full heads of romaine, so maybe I shouldn't complain since I received so much food for my money and agony."
Koizumi Y.,"Beaconsfield, United Kingdom",143,160,42,5.0,9/25/2006,"It'd be easy to nosebleed and give this less than five stars for being a chain without white linen and china. After all, I've only been here once or twice, and solely given its proximity to the Convention Centre when I've been in town for a conference.  It is large, vibrant, friendly -- and with a menu almost too extensive given the plethora of good choices one could make. I mean, really.... avocado egg rolls, Thai lettuce wraps, my very own bowl of Edamame . Am I the only one sliding off the chair here? Yum.  There is a decent wine and cocktail offering, and the entrees were actually delicious, though heavy on the portion side.  And then there's cheesecake. I'm not an ardent fan, but one cannot go here and skip the chance to lick the rim of another patrons crust. Besides, the selections are positively evil. Chocolate Oreo, tiramisu, Kahlua cocoa, Snickers???? Thank goodness I went with four other colleagues. They graciously escorted me out the door stretcher style. Leave the attitude at home and live a little."
Nicole K.,"Seattle, WA",15,80,,1.0,10/4/2007,"I think their strategy here is to give you so much bad food that you think that you are getting a good deal (a super-size me restaurant). The problem is: no matter how much bad food you eat, it still tastes like doo and thus it is not money well spent. I have been forced to come to this place a couple of times (family). The salads are blah, the veggie choices are few (they used to have a decent veggie burger, but no more), and the cheesecake is nothing write home about.  I won't bother remarking on the atmosphere, as it is a chain restaurant."
Sean D.,"Edmonds, WA",622,503,85,4.0,6/27/2007,"I never really liked the Cheesecake Factory till I tried their guacamole. Its AMAZING. You can have it as hot as you want and if you tell them you like it HOT they really bump up the temperature.  I'm giving this place three stars for that alone and one more star because of the nice drink selection.  The reasons I don't like it: 1. Its ALWAYS super busy and filled with tourists. The wait on a weekend for a table is usually over an hour and I wont even wait that long for a free meal. (Free drinks, yes. Free Food, no). 2. The menu is way too big. You can tell its too big because they have to insert advertisements into the menu to make sure your paying attention. 3. The staff is either way to friendly or they want nothing to do with you. All I want is for them to check on my once in a while and bring me what I ask for. Does it always have to be the opposite extremes? 4. Were is the factory? Were is all the smoke and pipes and stuff? I see the cheesecake for for god sake, if your going to call your self a factory have some cool gears turning at least."
Katie H.,"Larkspur, CA",74,603,28,4.0,1/11/2008,"I don't want to like the cheesecake factory, but I do.  The wait can be loooong so snag a table in the bar if you can. Portions are HUGE so be prepared for lots of leftovers, or spilt an entree with your dining companion.  I love their ceasar salad. It's slathered in dressing and is very garlicy, plus the portion is about the size of my head. The pizzas are really good and the spinach dip is also really tasty. I've actually never had anything there that I didn't like, except for some kind of ginormous deep fried chicken things I had once at a location in Florida. The cheesecake is good, and packs a 2,000 calories punch, so again share with multiple friends or be prepared to run a marathon to burn off the calories.  Drink prices are on the high side, but the bartenders are friendly and know their stuff. Plus it's one of the few places I can order a strawberry pina colado (their are really good) with no fear of ridicule."
Yue Z.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/11/2010,"The food here r pretty good. I order grilled salmon with mashed potato and French fries on the side. Salmon was ...ummm...just taste like a salmon. Nothing impressive .  But the two side dishes are really good. Although I was super filled up, I just can't stoping eating. One good thing about this restaurant is, orders r super huge! I hate those fancy place serve huge plate with little tiny food. However, their beverages r not as good as their food, lemonade r super super super super sweat( super 100 times) . Coffee is sucks too. The last but not the least, have lunch in 40 dollars with just 2 people is little expensive."
Nancy C.,"Federal Way, WA",311,1257,64,2.0,1/19/2009,"I promised the little one cheesecake - so after our show, I got 3 pieces to go - it took about 10 minutes to get it and it was $23!  The cheesecake was just ok - I'm sure I could have bought a whole one somewhere that was fantastic for less than that.  Actualy, Trader Joe's has a pretty good one for less than $10.   I've always found their food to be overpriced and not so good.  The only thing I actually like is the Chinese Chicken Salad which isn't to bad."
